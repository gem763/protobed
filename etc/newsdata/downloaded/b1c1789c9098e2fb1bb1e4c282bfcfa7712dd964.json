(Karen Pulfer Focht/Reuters)\n\nShe denies or ignores the huge price tags that should be attached to her proposals.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been having trouble finding someone to walk your dog, don\u2019t worry. Any day now, Elizabeth Warren will announce \u201ca plan for that.\u201d It will undoubtedly be comprehensive, detailed, and replete with subsidies for lower- and middle-class dog walkers and underserved breeds. It will cost tens of billions of dollars and will receive widespread positive notice from the media. However, to judge by her other recent plans, the one thing it won\u2019t include is any discussion of how she plans to pay for it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Massachusetts senator has challenged and possibly overtaken former vice president Joe Biden as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, largely based on having a plan for the government to tackle every problem facing this country, no matter how big or how small, from issues with military housing to Puerto Rican debt to climate change.\n\nThe price tag for this massive expansion of government is enormous. Much of the attention in recent weeks has been focused on Warren\u2019s embrace of Medicare for All, which she refuses to admit would require an increase in middle-class taxes. Even Vermont senator Bernie Sanders has conceded that such proposals, which would cost $30\u201340 trillion over 10 years, cannot be financed without tax hikes. Warren\u2019s refusal to address this obvious fact makes her look less like a would-be policy wonk and more like a typical politician.\n\nBut even setting aside Medicare for All, Warren\u2019s plans are likely to dump oceans of red ink onto our growing national debt. Her non-health-care spending proposals already total some $7.5 trillion per year over the next 10 years. Although these are not quite Bernie levels of government largesse, her proposals would still require nearly double our current levels of spending.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo pay for all this, Warren proposes a variety of tax hikes, mostly designed to hit corporations or high-earners: higher payroll taxes for those earning more than $250,000 per year; a 7 percent profits tax on companies earning more than $100 million; a 60 percent lobbying tax on firms that spend a million or more on lobbying, and so forth. But the biggest chunk of money would come from Warren\u2019s proposed \u201cwealth tax,\u201d a 2 to 3 percent levy on net worth above $50 million. Warren estimates that this wealth tax will pull in more than $2.75 trillion over ten years. It won\u2019t.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst, there is the slight problem that a wealth tax is probably unconstitutional. Of course, constitutional constraints are quaint notions in the Age of Trump. Regardless, it is worth noting that the Constitution permits the federal government to impose only \u201cdirect taxes,\u201d such as a property tax. That\u2019s why it required a constitutional amendment to enact the federal income tax. Many constitutional scholars warn that a wealth tax is neither a direct tax nor income tax.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven if Warren can find a way around the constitutional guardrails \u2014 perhaps by something such as a retrospective wealth tax in which you wait until a taxpayer sells assets or passes away \u2014 a wealth tax is unlikely to raise anywhere near the amount of money she predicts.\n\nSimply look at Europe\u2019s experiments with wealth taxes. At one time, a dozen European countries imposed wealth taxes. Today, all but three have abandoned those levies. Among those repealing their wealth tax are the Scandinavian social democracies that Warren admires, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden. Norway retains a wealth tax but has significantly reduced it in recent years. Additional countries abandoning the tax include Austria, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. Other countries, such as Great Britain, have considered wealth taxes and rejected them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey did so because wealth taxes are administratively complex and difficult to enforce. Also, they significantly reduce investment, entrepreneurship, and, ultimately, economic growth. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, European wealth taxes raised, on average, only about 0.2 percent of GDP in revenues. By comparison, the U.S. federal income tax raises 8 percent of GDP.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo groups, however, would benefit substantially from a wealth tax. The tax would be a full-employment opportunity for the tax-preparation industry and for lawyers. After all, we would now have to determine fair market value for everything from homes and vehicles to artwork and jewelry to family pension rights and intellectual property. The other big winner would be lobbyists, who could be expected to descend on Washington en masse seeking exemptions and exceptions for their clients. If you think the tax code is a mess today, just wait until D.C. is done with Warren\u2019s plan.\n\nThere is an old Yiddish proverb that goes \u201cMann tracht, un Gott Lacht,\u201d or \u201cMan plans, and God laughs.\u201d It is all well and good that Senator Warren has a plan for everything. But until she actually figures out how to pay for everything without crippling our economy, such plans really don\u2019t add up.", "description": "Elizabeth Warren's plans would cost trillions of dollars, and she has no realistic idea for how to pay for them", "authors": ["Michael Tanner", "Zachary Evans", "Kevin D.
