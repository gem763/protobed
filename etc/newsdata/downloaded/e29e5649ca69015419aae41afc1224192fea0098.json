(AP Photo/Elise Amendola, File)\n\nSteve Nash took one last run at an NBA title with the Los Angeles Lakers before closing his 18-year career in part due to back and knee injuries. The Lakers\u2019 superstar team never did win that title together, instead proving a disappointment.\n\nNash, a two-time MVP and Naismith Hall of Fame inductee, discussed the 2012-13 Lakers\u2019 faults with Bill Simmons on his podcast for The Ringer this week when he mentioned he\u2019s still experiencing the ramifications of breaking his knee two games into being a Laker.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nNash \u2018wasn\u2019t quite the same\u2019 after leg fracture\n\nNash joined the Lakers in 2012 and two games into the season collided with Portland Trail Blazers then-rookie Damian Lillard. He was diagnosed with a fracture in his left leg. The following season he left a game with nerve irritation in the same leg.\n\nThe eight-time All-Star told Simmons he broke the joint of the tibia and fibula in his knee, known as a \u201ctib-fib\u201d fracture. He said he\u2019s \u201cstill not the same\u201d from the injury.\n\n\u201cHonestly, since that break, my body\u2019s different just the way it responds to everything. ... I wasn\u2019t quite the same [and] wasn\u2019t moving great forever more.\u201d\n\nCoupled with his back issues, he said it created what\u2019s known as a double crush syndrome. It\u2019s a \u201cdistinct compression\u201d at two or more spots along the peripheral nerve that coexist and \u201cincrease symptom intensity,\u201d according to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons.\n\nNash, 45, retired after playing 15 games of the 2013-14 season and is now a commentator for soccer and the NBA on TNT.\n\nNash explains why Lakers fell short\n\nThe 2012-13 Lakers were a championship contender that flamed out short of expectations. Nash told Simmons it was a \u201cgreat idea,\u201d but not a \u201cgreat fit.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cYou add it all up, I don\u2019t know if it ever would have worked. It just, it was doomed.\u201d\n\nNash experienced his broken knee two games into the year. He told Simmons that Pau Gasol was exhausted after spending his offseasons playing for Spain, Dwight Howard was coming off back surgery and Metta World Peace \u201cwasn\u2019t quite the same,\u201d either.\n\nHe acknowledged Kobe Bryant was playing at a high level, but doesn\u2019t think it would have been a title team.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just the pieces. It was such \u2014 a lot of old dogs, new tricks. And you know, we already talked about how temperamental a chemistry is on a basketball team in particular of all the sports in a sense. That balance looking back on it now, I\u2019m not sure it ever would have worked.\u201d\n\nThe Lakers have not won 40 games in a season since that campaign. Howard and Anthony Davis joined LeBron James in L.A. this year for another title-contending run in L.A.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Steve Nash fractured his leg two games into his initial season with the Los Angeles Lakers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/42a_X9gtXkIINFTBWoZ8hg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD0xMDE1LjQ2NjY2NjY2NjY2Njc-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Mgxf8zx14OwaBR6KMR8cZw--~B/aD0xNjY2O3c9MjEwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/5ac234d0-d0d1-11e9-befb-c6a536a775d4", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
