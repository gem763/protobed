He initiated the conversation,\u201d Hinch said Wednesday before Game 2. \u201cWe followed up today with a personal meeting and walked through the different scenarios.\u201d\n\nThe play in question occurred in the eighth inning with Houston trailing 5-3. With Kyle Tucker on second base and one out, Springer had a deep drive to right-center field.\n\nSpringer - who earlier had homered in a record fifth straight World Series game - took about a half-dozen hops out of the batter\u2019s box while watching the ball sail, possibly for a tying home run. Instead, it hit off the glove of leaping right fielder Adam Eaton, and Springer ended up with an RBI double.\n\nKnown for his hustle and aggressive play, Springer didn\u2019t begin running hard until getting to first base. There was speculation he could\u2019ve gotten a triple if he\u2019d broken fast from the box - that became magnified when Jose Altuve followed with a flyball that might have been long enough for a sacrifice fly.\n\n\u201cHe just wanted to talk about the play,\u201d Hinch said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a malicious play where he was disrespecting the game. He wasn\u2019t disrespecting his teammates.\n\n\u201cI think George got caught up in the moment of the play, in the anxiousness to see if the ball was leaving. It wasn\u2019t an egregious showmanship kind of pimp job, as they call it. It was a delay in reading the play correctly,\u201d he said.\n\nThe ball caromed off Eaton\u2019s glove, hit the wall and rolled toward center field, where Victor Robles retrieved it and threw it in.\n\nTucker had gone back to second base to tag up, in case the ball was caught. Once it dropped, he scored easily.\n\nSpringer said he was watching Eaton the whole way.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of those things where I don\u2019t want to necessarily run as fast as I can, because for some reason, if (Tucker) tags or whatever the case and I run by him, it\u2019s not good. So I was just kind of watching the outfielder,\u201d he said after the game.\n\nSpringer also said he wouldn\u2019t have made it to third base.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t go to third right there because the guy on second had gone back to tag,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I had gone to third, I\u2019m out.\u201d\n\nHinch called it \u201can honest mistake.\u201d He said he felt no need to tear into Springer on their late-night call and that \u201cwas important for me so he could sleep at night.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll in all, I\u2019ve been around George, I know how hard he plays. I know he leaves it all out on the field,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if the play ends any differently, but everybody understands the look when it\u2019s a late entry into a play like that.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Before going to sleep, George Springer wanted to put to bed what happened on the bases.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ben Walker"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/22/world_series_nationals_astros_baseball_79563_c0-127-3079-1923_s1200x700.jpg?49972fc8bb4400f5d4638a22a8734ea837027582", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
