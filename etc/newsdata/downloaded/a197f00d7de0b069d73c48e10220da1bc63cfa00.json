I lost my whole life there,\u201d 71-year-old Wade Hoefer told AFP as he surveyed the ruins of his painting studio at the historic Soda Rock Winery destroyed by the Kincade Fire.\n\n\u201cAll I have is my clothes on my back,\u201d he said, adding that he was now living in his car.\n\nDozens of other fires have broken out throughout the state in recent days, fed by strong winds, low humidity and high temperatures.\n\nThe wildfires come as California is still reeling from the aftermath of the most destructive wildfire in state history \u2014 the Camp Fire, which destroyed the town of Paradise and killed 86 people last year.\n\nSimilar blazes in northern California, including in the Napa and Sonoma wine regions, killed 44 people in 2017 and destroyed thousands of structures.\n\nFire authorities determined that PG&E transmission lines caused the Camp Fire. The utility, which filed for bankruptcy earlier this year, has been held responsible for a number of other wildfires in recent years.", "description": "Los Angeles (AFP) \u2013 California braced on Tuesday for the most powerful winds this season that threaten to spread destructive fires raging in the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/29/4efff0_firefighters-gather-hoses-destroyed-homes-north-tigertail-road-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
