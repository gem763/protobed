I would expect us to support that.\u201d\n\nHowever, when Corbyn was asked on Thursday whether Labour would support such a bid, he suggested his first priority was to vote down Johnson\u2019s deal. \u201cWe are unhappy with this deal and as it stands we will vote against it, although obviously we will need to see all of the last details of it,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the deal more broadly, he told Sky News: \u201cFrom what we\u2019ve read of this deal, it doesn\u2019t meet our demands or expectations, it creates a border down the Irish sea and it leads once again to a race to the bottom in rights and protections for British citizens and a danger of the sell-off of our national assets to American companies.\u201d\n\nAsked whether he had given up on his plan to negotiate a Labour Brexit deal, he insisted: \u201cNot at all: a Labour government elected in a general election would within three months negotiate an agreement with the EU around the five pillars \u2026 and then within six months we would put that to a referendum.\u201d\n\nThat was the policy agreed after a debate at last month\u2019s Labour conference in Brighton \u2013 but Corbyn has been under relentless pressure ever since to make fresh moves towards opposing Brexit.\n\nOpposition parties at Westminster are expected to meet later on Thursday to discuss how best to respond to the news that Johnson has secured a deal with the EU27.\n\nThe Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, said: \u201cThe fight to stop Brexit is far from over. When this deal comes to parliament we will use every possible opportunity to give the public a \u2018people\u2019s vote\u2019 on the Brexit deal that includes the option to remain in the European Union.\u201d\n\nWith the precise wording of the government\u2019s motion not expected to be published until Saturday, it is unclear as yet exactly how any referendum could be appended to it.\n\nCorbyn expressed caution last weekend about the idea that Labour could support any Johnson deal in exchange for a referendum.\n\nThe original plan advanced by proponents of a \u201cconfirmatory vote\u201d, including Labour MP Peter Kyle, was that MPs would pass an amendment, making the Brexit deal conditional on a referendum \u2013 and then once it was amended, vote with the government for the deal.\n\nBut a number of Labour MPs have concerns about anything that would appear to be offering support to Johnson, albeit conditionally.\n\nAnd a potentially larger group have concerns about supporting a referendum at all. When Labour recommended that its MPs back the idea of a referendum in the so-called \u201cindicative votes\u201d process earlier this year, 27 rebelled to vote against it. Several more abstained.\n\nThe shadow Cabinet Office secretary, Jon Trickett, told the Guardian last week he would not be in favour of a referendum that pitted Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal against remain, without offering leave voters in his constituency what he called a \u201cLabour Brexit\u201d.", "description": "When asked about plan by MPs to force vote on latest Brexit deal, Labour leader says first priority is to vote it down", "authors": ["Heather Stewart", "Rowena Mason"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb91a4fc342d891e5512c12a271ecadb1d7e2fb8/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cecbd2a16deff3012ea1ed389004a508", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
