She always held herself so well and she always had such grace and she's such a strong actor that you never seemed like a child.\"\n\n\"You've also maintained -- which I think is almost unheard of in this business -- such sweetness and gratitude for the job and for every minute and for everybody,\" Jolie added with a smile.\n\nAddressing her interview with Tatler, Fanning explained that she's always felt a pressure from the press to try and compete with other actresses, especially her older sister, Dakota Fanning.\n\n\"From a young age, my sister is in the business, and always interviews would always be about asking me, 'Oh, well, you guys must be really jealous of each other,'\" Fanning recalled. \"Interviewers would want to pit women against each other, so there's this stigma of, 'If you guys work together there's jealousy on set,' and it's just so not true.\"\n\n\"Because I've only had great relationships with actresses,\" Pfeiffer shared.\n\nFor Jolie, she said that her desire to support other actress, and actors alike, \"comes so naturally,\" and Pfeiffer concurred.\n\n\"I don't really think about it,\" Pfeiffer explained. \"Then, people ask about it, and then you feel this pressure to come up with some answer when there's not one.\"\n\n\"There's so much that [is just] natural. The older a woman grows, there's that maternal desire to nurture,\" Jolie shared. \"Especially when you're on set, or you're in any situation, you want to nurture. You want to look after your colleagues or the people who are younger on set. It's fun.\"\n\nJolie, Fanning and Pfeiffer star in Disney's Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, which hits theaters Oct. 18.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nAngelina Jolie Gushes Over Son Maddox After Sending Him Off to College: 'I'm So Proud of Him'\n\nAngelina Jolie Says She's Rediscovering Herself as a Mother of Teenagers\n\nElle Fanning Reveals She Was 'So Nervous' to Meet Angelina Jolie Before Filming 'Maleficent' (Exclusive)\n\nElle Fanning Assures Fans She's OK After Fainting at Cannes Dinner Party\n\nRelated Articles:", "description": "The actresses opened up to ET on Sunday.", "authors": ["Zach Seemayer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/JHqSxC8YPHYsTjMxzakWMw--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/e3681ccc71a8a00d01b9ba06807e6a4b", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
