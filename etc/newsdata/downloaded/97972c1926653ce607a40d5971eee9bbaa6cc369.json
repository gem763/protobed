In an interview with the BBC Monday, Johnson was asked multiple times how he plans to execute Brexit at the end of October without breaking the law, if there is no deal. Johnson has been warned he could be jailed if he refuses to delay Brexit.\n\n\"I will uphold the constitution, I will obey the law, but we will come out on 31 October,\" Johnson said in response.\n\nThe prime minister insisted his first priority was still trying to reach a deal with Brussels, but he also refused to explain how he would reconcile his plans with parliament's latest legislation if he did not.\n\nWhen asked again whether he was \"looking for a way around the law\" to make sure the U.K. leaves the EU even if there's no deal, Johnson responded: \"Well, you know those are your words. What we're going to do is come out on 31 October deal or no deal. And staying in beyond 31 October [is] completely ... crackers.\"\n\nHe later said he was \"cautiously optimistic,\" about finding agreement with Brussels, but added: \"I'm not counting my chickens. And it is absolutely vital, it's absolutely vital for people to understand that the U.K. is ready to come out with no deal if we have to.\"", "description": "Staying in the EU beyond Halloween deadline is \u2018crackers,\u2019 PM says.", "authors": ["Emma Anderson", "Ma\u00efa De La Baume"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1167766679-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
