Nancy Mumby-Welke of Gratiot County, Michigan, heard a loud crash outside her farmland home this weekend and discovered a large object in her backyard. \u201cUnbelievable look what just fell out of the sky and 911 is baffled and it\u2019s caught up in our tree,\u201d she posted to Facebook along with a photo.\n\n\u201cWe realized it had fallen from the sky,\u201d Mumby-Welke told NBC News. \u201cIt looked like a satellite.\u201d The device carried both a Samsung logo and that of South Dakota-based high-altitude balloon manufacturer Raven Industries, which eventually came to collect the crashed apparatus.\n\nOh my look what fall out of the sky Posted by Nancy Mumby-Welke on Saturday, October 26, 2019\n\n\u201cNo injuries occurred and the balloon was subsequently retrieved,\u201d Samsung said to NBC. \u201cWe regret any inconvenience this may have caused.\u201d The company claims the landing was \u201cplanned\u201d and happened in a \u201cselected rural area.\u201d\n\nAs PR stunts go, this one was over the top even by Samsung\u2019s standards. The \u201cSpaceSelfie\u201d program involved a photo of Cara Delevingne that was taken on a Galaxy S10 Plus and was supposedly \u201cthe world\u2019s first selfie sent to space.\u201d Users could then upload their own photos to a website for a chance to see them displayed on the screen of a Galaxy S10 5G on board the balloon.\n\n\u201cOur relentless pioneering spirit continues to show that amazing things happen on Samsung screens \u2013 even from the stratosphere.\u201d Samsung Europe CMO Benjamin Braun said at the launch event. \u201cOur ethos is Do What You Can\u2019t and the Samsung SpaceSelfie is just that. We continually break the boundaries of what is possible with innovation and tonight\u2019s SpaceSelfie launch is no different.\u201d", "description": "\"911 is baffled.\"", "authors": ["Sam Byford", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TMgJbctNCis2jqBAH4EV3CBtgko=/0x232:2048x1304/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19324319/74335862_2607906735935374_6240615647483527168_o.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
