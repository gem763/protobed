If they had gotten to Damascus... there would be a possible caliphate throughout this whole region,\" Stone said. \"Mr Putin doesn't have the oil interest in mind. He has the concept of keeping a balance and respecting the sovereignty of these countries.\"\n\nIn 2017, Stone put Putin in U.S. living rooms by broadcasting interviews with the Russian leader.\n\n\"The Putin Interviews\" was the product of 12 conversations between the Russian leader and Stone between July 2015 and February 2017, divided into four one-hour programs.\n\nPutin clearly exercises fascination for Stone, who at one point tells him: \"You are an excellent CEO of a company. Russia is your company.\"\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "American filmmaker Oliver Stone on Wednesday hailed Russian President Vladimir Putin as a \"stabilizing force\" in the Middle East, particularly in war-ravaged Syria.
