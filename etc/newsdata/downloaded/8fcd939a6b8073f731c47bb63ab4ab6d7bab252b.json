As Trysta Krick details, Washington is brink while the Astros are one game away from a classic comeback. USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 After having one of the greatest rookie seasons in major league baseball history, Yordan \u00c1lvarez of the Houston Astros had gone cold in the postseason.\n\nHe struggled through 1-for-22 performance in the American League Championship Series, and as the World Series came to Washington, he had been relegated to pinch-hitting duties.\n\nBut a return to the Astros starting lineup in Game 5 Sunday night was just what Alvarez needed to get back on track. Only, he wasn\u2019t the first one to know.\n\n\u201cAll my teammates were saying today is your day. Today is your day,\u201d \u00c1lvarez said after going 3-for-3 with a home run in the Astros\u2019 7-1 victory.\n\nJose Alvarez celebrates his second-inning homer with teammate Jose Altuve. (Photo: Patrick Smith, Getty Images)\n\nShortstop Carlos Correa and backup infielder Aledmys Diaz were the most vocal ones, giving the rookie encouragement as he spent past several days working on making the necessary adjustments to get out of his October slump.\n\n\u201cI just told him that what great players do when they struggle is try to figure out a way to contribute to the game,\u201d Correa said. \u201cHe went to the cage. He spent time in the cage. He put in his work. And he told me he was feeling great.\u201d\n\nDespite not getting a call to the majors until early June, \u00c1lvarez still hit 27 home runs, collected 78 RBI and put up a .313/.412/.655 slash line. Those numbers have made him the prohibitive favorite for AL Rookie of the Year honors.\n\nAnd with good reason. Among players with at least 350 plate appearances, no rookie has ever had a higher slugging percentage. No rookie has ever posted a higher OPS (1.067). Even adjusting for era, ballpark factors and offensive environments, only Jose Abreu in 2014 has been able to equal Alvarez\u2019s 173 OPS+.\n\nWHAT IF:Nationals have to live with iffy calls in Game 5\n\nGAME 5: Nationals on the ropes after third straight loss\n\nWORLD SERIES: Fans were ready for President Trump's visit\n\nWith such a stellar resume, \u00c1lvarez, 22, hadn\u2019t really experienced failure the way he did in the ALCS against the New York Yankees. Then with the World Series moving to the National League park, the Astros\u2019 everyday DH during the regular season found himself on the bench for Games 3 and 4.\n\n\u201cThings didn\u2019t go as well as he wanted to, but he had a great season,\u201d said first baseman Yuli Gurriel. \u201cSo I always give him the advice to keep your spirits up, keep working. And we saw what happened tonight.\u201d\n\nAstros manager A.J. Hinch had said earlier in the series he wanted to get \u00c1lvarezinto a game in the outfield, even though he only made 10 appearances there during the regular season. With Gerrit Cole \u2013 who led the majors with 326 strikeouts this season \u2013 on the mound, Game 5 was the perfect opportunity.\n\n\u201cYou want to talk about feeling like you did the right thing is just put Yordan in the game and have him have three incredible at-bats,\u201d Hinch said. \u201cHe\u2019s done this the whole year, but this postseason as he\u2019s tried to find his way it was nice to see him stay within himself.\u201d\n\nHe even made a nice catch in the field on Trea Turner\u2019s sizzling line drive in the third inning.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest reason the Astros are so optimistic heading back home to Houston with a chance to wrap up their second World Series title in three years isn\u2019t that they\u2019ll have their co-ace Justin Verlander on the mound in Game 6. It\u2019s that they\u2019ll have their rookie slugger \u2013 now clearly back in the groove \u2013 back in the lineup for good.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s huge to see him swing the bat like that because now we go back home and then he\u2019s our DH at 22 years old for a reason,\u201d Correa said. \u201cHe\u2019s young and he\u2019s powerful and he\u2019s a great hitter. So we believe in him and we know he\u2019s going to keep doing it.\u201d", "description": "\u00c1lvarez had 27 home runs in 87 regular-season games, but hadn't gone long in the postseason \u2013 until Game 5.", "authors": ["Steve Gardner", "Published A.M.
