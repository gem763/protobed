It changed its name from Danish Oil and Natural Gas and dumped its fossil fuel assets two years ago.\n\nBy the numbers: About 30% of the federal offshore wind leases that the Interior Department has auctioned to date are tied to the oil industry (Equinor and Shell), according to BloombergNEF data.\n\nWhy it matters: These companies have deep pocketbooks and global reach. If they make big bets on offshore wind, which accounts for just 0.3% of global electricity today, the growth of this carbon-free energy source could exceed current expectations.\n\nThe IEA predicts it\u2019ll increase at least 15-fold in the next 20 years.\n\nin the next 20 years. \u201cThe technology of offshore wind has made a real move forward , I would say, over the last four years,\u201d BP CEO Bob Dudley told me in a recent interview. \u201cWe would be natural investors in that if the economics were acceptable.\u201d\n\n, I would say, over the last four years,\u201d BP CEO Bob Dudley told me in a recent interview. \u201cWe would be natural investors in that if the economics were acceptable.\u201d BP operates some onshore wind farms, but no offshore ones. Dudley said the company is looking at several countries around the world, including the U.S., but declined to offer specifics.\n\nThe big picture: Big oil and gas companies are under pressure from shareholders, lawsuits and the public to more readily acknowledge their role fueling climate change and more fully embrace a global, albeit uneven, transition to cleaner energy sources.\n\nBetween the lines: An increasing trend among these companies is to buy stakes in separate developers already focused on clean energy, such as solar and electric vehicle charging.\n\nBut because of the significant crossover between offshore oil and wind, the producers are more likely to make it part of their internal portfolios.\n\nGo deeper: Troubles lurk for America\u2019s emerging offshore wind boom", "description": "European oil and gas majors are leading the way.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/zk8JkZKOn2OvnzK08uOUEu-diU8=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/10/29/1572374343344.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
