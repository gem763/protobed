Featuring game-changing design, performance and strength only found in the RZR Pro class, the PRO XP 4 lineup sets a new industry standard for four-seat performance.\n\nAvailable in three trim levels, the PRO XP 4 offers unprecedented value, while the PRO XP 4 Premium features interior upgrades, a full lighting package, multi-point harnesses, premium paint finishes, and a completely new storage system. Riders looking for a fully loaded machine can opt for the PRO XP 4 Ultimate, complete with steering wheel controls for DYNAMIX 2.0, Ride Command and a Rockford Fosgate premium audio system. Each PRO XP 4 machine is equipped with front and rear half doors, adjustable sliding driver and passenger seats, expanded fuel capacity, enhanced rear passenger sightline and stock 30-inch Maxxis Carnivore 2.0 tires.\n\n\u201cIndustry standards were shattered with the introduction of the RZR PRO XP platform, and to continue that trend, we\u2019re excited to introduce an all-new standard for four-seat performance side-by-sides,\u201d said Chris Musso, president of Off Road for Polaris. \u201cOf course the driver is at the heart of all the action, but we saw an opportunity to revolutionize the four-seat category with thoughtful design aimed towards passengers. The PRO XP 4 delivers on this without sacrificing any of the industry-leading performance or durability riders expect from the RZR Pro class.\u201d\n\nVisionary Design: Built from the Inside Out with Every Passenger In Mind\n\nJust like the RZR PRO XP, the new four-seater keeps the driver at the center of everything \u2013 with a lower seating position, improved adjustability and thoughtful interior design that delivers perfect ergonomics. The PRO XP 4 adds to that industry-leading design with even more advancements specifically designed for the rear passengers. Slightly elevated rear seating creates best-in-class sightlines for rear passengers, while four more inches of shoulder room and three more inches of leg room delivers unmatched comfort for a full day of riding.\n\nBoasting the same menacing look as the PRO XP, the PRO XP 4 offers interior and exterior LED lighting and blue LED accent strips that line the cockpit for improved nighttime visibility. The PRO XP 4 is complete with dash storage and a latching center console, as well as the industry\u2019s first rear \u201cfold flat\u201d storage. The new design allows riders to fold down the backseats to create additional storage behind the driver and front passenger offering over 16 cubic feet of storage space.\n\nPro Performance: A New Standard for Four-Seat Performance\n\nWith 181 horsepower, the PRO XP 4 is fitted with a larger turbo to create more boost, and a power band focused on snappier acceleration between 20 and 50 miles-per-hour. The all-new 64-inch PRO XP 4 machines debut with an industry-leading 22 inches of usable suspension travel, comparable to the RZR XP 4 Turbo S.\n\nThe chassis of the RZR PRO XP 4 is on a level of its own. With a 125-inch wheelbase, the longest of any RZR ever created, the supreme length not only delivers unmatched comfort and storage, but delivers next-level stability through high-speed whoops and dune transitions. Fuel capacity was also increased by two gallons, for a 13-gallon tank.\n\nAs the top-of-the-line four-seater, the RZR PRO XP 4 Ultimate features an entirely new calibration for DYNAMIX. Paired with upgraded FOX\u00ae 2.5 Live Valve Shocks, DYNAMIX 2.0 is easy to operate and includes conveniently placed steering wheel controls. The DYNAMIX \u2018X\u2019 button sends the system to full firm to prevent bottoming out in high-speed surprise events. All in, this machine transfers weight faster, is more agile and keeps the vehicle flatter \u2013 increasing confidence and comfort for all four riders.\n\nBrute Strength: Stronger & Tougher Than Any Other Four-Seater\n\nThe PRO XP 4 is stronger in every area that matters. Suspension components are upgraded with tubular diameters that match that of the RZR XP Turbo S. The 64-inch machine\u2019s high-clearance suspension in the front and rear provides a best-in-class 14.5 inches of ground clearance. Additionally, the PRO XP 4\u2019s 30-inch Maxxis Carnivore 2.0 tires are the largest to come standard on a machine of its size.\n\nEquipped with the same PRO XP drivetrain, with eight-times stronger axles that twist up to 300 degrees, the PRO XP 4 is the strongest four-seater ever created. Additionally, a revamped transmission delivers 39% more durability, while a three-times stronger front drive on the toughest one-piece chassis translates to fewer broken parts and a more reliable ride.\n\nWith more test miles than ever before, the quality and durability of RZR PRO XP 4 is truly taken to the next level and is made to devour whatever is thrown its way.\n\nThe RZR PRO XP 4 lineup can be pushed to the limits while maintaining its all-encompassing premium driving capabilities in the toughest terrains. Pricing for the RZR PRO XP 4 starts at $25,699, while the PRO XP Premium begins at $27,999 and the PRO XP Ultimate at $32,299. The RZR PRO XP 4 lineup is now shipping to Polaris dealers around the country.\n\nMore information about Polaris Off-Road and Polaris Engineered Accessories can be found at RZR.Polaris.com.
