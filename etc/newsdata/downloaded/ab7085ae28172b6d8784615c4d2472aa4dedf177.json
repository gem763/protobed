The group believes \u201cintensive animal production poses material risks to the global financial system and hinders sustainable development.\u201d\n\nFor instance, McDonald\u2019s has a target to reduce 31% of greenhouse gas emissions across its supply chain by 2030. Yet according to FAIRR, three-quarters of major meat, fish, and dairy producers suppliers do not measure emissions.\n\n\u201cWhen we took a deep-dive look into the actual producers, we didn\u2019t see these public commitments and we didn\u2019t see the public available data or information,\u201d said Maria Lettini, Director of FAIRR on YFi PM.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s up to us there and the investor market to connect the dots there to ask the producers and sellers to see if they\u2019re actually aligned with the commitments we\u2019ve seen,\u2019 said Lettini.\n\nFor example, Walmart commits to zero net deforestation in its supply by 2020, but suppliers such as Sanderson Farms (SAFM) do not have expressed commitments to reduce deforestation, FAIRR pointed out.\n\n\u201cThese companies urgently need to address issues such as climate risk, deforestation and antibiotic use to future proof their own business models,\u201d Coller said.\n\nIn doing so, these companies should \u201cprevent the commitments of their customers, the high-street brands, from becoming nothing but fake promises,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrete Suarez is producer at Yahoo Finance for YFi PM and The Ticker.
