In a rare move, many of the major altcoins are making large gains independently of their big brother. Ethereum is still going strong but XRP and XLM are today\u2019s top performers.\n\nXRP On A Roll\n\nRipple\u2019s token has been on the floor for most of 2019. It has been one of the worst-performing altcoins this year and has been lulling around a yearly low for most of this month. Spurious token movements by the San Francisco based fintech firm have angered the community as fears of mass liquidation intensified.\n\nXRP has dumped to a yearly low of around $0.25 since the summer\u2019s altcoin rally. Over the past few hours, however, the cross border payments token has seen one of its largest moves this year with a pump of almost 20% to top out over $0.31. Daily volume has surged from $850 million to almost $2.5 billion and this one is clearly leading the pack at the moment.\n\nForbes is barking up the wrong digital tree, as usual, attributing the movement to a proposed hard fork from the community. What is likely to be driving it are rumors of a tie-up between Ripple and Coinbase though nothing official has been announced.\n\n\u201cBreanne Madigan drops some crumbs at minute 9:37; it seems like Coinbase is an xRapid exchange and it\u2019s currently originating MoneyGram flows into Mexico.\u201d\n\nxRapid scouts \u2014 I summon you. Breanne Madigan drops some crumbs at minute 9:37; it seems like Coinbase is an xRapid exchange and it's currently originating MoneyGram flows into Mexico. Should be interesting to track.@tenitoshi@hmatejx@hallwaymonitor2https://t.co/CFV5uFe1pE \u2014 XRP Research Center (@XrpCenter) September 15, 2019\n\nAlso getting a good dose of FOMO today is Stellar Lumens which has traditionally moved in tandem with XRP. The payments token has been flat for most of this year but woke up today with a 14% movement to reach $0.066.\n\nEthereum Still Climbing\n\nETH is building on its weekend momentum as it pushes above the $200 barrier to top out at $215 a few hours ago. Ethereum has made over 18% since the weekend and is currently trading at around $212. There has been a lot of fundamental goodness for the world\u2019s second-largest crypto-asset which has been in a weak state for a while now.\n\nThe next major resistance target for Ethereum is around $230 and at the moment it appears on track to reach that. There are a couple of other altcoins grabbing a double-digit gain today and they are Tron and Tezos.\n\nThe big market movement has come at the expense of bitcoin which has dropped below 70% dominance for the first time in six weeks.\n\nHas altseason finally begun?
