What's new is that it is now exhibited in @zoodeparis which is really great as it is a species you would not usually expect to meet in a zoo. \u2014 Audrey Dussutour (@Docteur_Drey) October 17, 2019\n\nThe new area within the Paris Zoo dedicated to the blob will open to the public on Saturday.\n\nToday 'hui le @zoodeparis inaugurates the #Blob zone in partnership with the @CNRS.\n\nThe public has an appointment next Saturday (19/10) to discover this species that fascinates scientists, as @Docteur_Drey.\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f https://t.co/P74RCEYaOG #80ansCNRS #RDVSauvage #5AnsZoodeParis pic.twitter.com/XIRcnOfMvR \u2014 Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique \ud83c\udf0d (@CNRS) October 16, 2019", "description": "The fascinating yellowish blob will be on display in a new exhibit at the Paris Zoo.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/General/blob-paris-zoo-rt-aa-191017_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
