This is what they should be protesting about, campaigning against stupid decisions like this would get them sympathy instead of stopping trains that carry hundreds of people.'\n\nThe usual route along the road takes less than two seconds to cover while traveling at the 30mph speed limit. The council's diversion is estimated to take around an hour to complete\n\nThe council argued the diversion had to use A roads, and said locals would be likely to ignore the diversion and use smaller roads to get around the work.\n\nA spokesman for the council said: 'The closure has been requested to allow Dorset Drainage Services to make a sewer connection within the highway.\n\n'The official diversion has to be suitable for the type of traffic that would normally use the closed section.\n\n'This is an A road so we have used other A roads for the diversion.\n\n'Smaller local traffic will undoubtedly use lower classified roads to bypass the closure.", "description": "Locals have hit out at Dorset County Council for putting a 41-mile diversion around a 65ft-stretch of the A352 in Godmanstone, which will be closed for several days.", "authors": ["Amie Gordon For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/12/20081456-0-image-a-2_1571831593946.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
