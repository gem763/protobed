EM ASIA FX-Most Asian currencies firm on dollar weakness, trade hopes\n\n(Adds text, updates prices)\n\nBy Patturaja Murugaboopathy\n\nOct 17 (Reuters) - Most Asian currencies strengthened on\n\nThursday due to overnight weakness in dollar after a fall in\n\nU.S. retail sales, while lingering hopes of a Sino-U.S. trade\n\ndeal also lent support to the export-reliant regional units.\n\nThe Taiwanese dollar TWD=TP led the gains in the region,\n\nfollowed by the South Korean won KRW=KFTC and the Malaysian\n\nringgit .\n\n\"We still see some net risk-on sentiment supporting the\n\nAsian currencies in general. We have positive news coming out\n\nfrom Brexit. And in Asia, regarding the Sino-U.S. trade\n\nsituation, it is still very much on the holding pattern,\" said\n\nTerence Wu, a currency strategist at OCBC Bank.\n\n\"Even though people are starting to reach some suspicions\n\nover whether a deal will be signed eventually in the APAC\n\nmeeting, at this point there are no clear signals that it is\n\nbreaking up.\"\n\nThe dollar index was trading flat at 98.005, hovering\n\nnear a four-week low of 97.898 it touched in the previous\n\nsession.\n\nAnalysts said regional currencies also firmed on rising\n\nexpectations on an interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve\n\nthis month. The bets further strengthened after data released on\n\nWednesday showed U.S. retail sales falling for the first time\n\nseven months in September.\n\nIndian rupee INR=IN and the Indonesian rupiah IDR=ID ,the\n\ntwo high yielding currencies, also strengthened on the day due\n\nto a sharp fall in U.S. bond yields.\n\nOn the other hand, China's yuan CNY=CFXS edged lower\n\nagainst the U.S. dollar after the central bank set a weaker\n\ndaily reference rate for the currency.\n\nINDIAN RUPEE\n\nThe Indian rupee INR=IN rose 0.16% against the dollar on\n\nThursday helped by weaker oil prices, lower U.S. bond yields and\n\nstrong domestic equities.\n\nHowever, some analysts said falling real yields of Indian\n\nbonds could affect the rupee, along with other concerns such as\n\nfiscal deficit and lower liquidity in the banking system.\n\nIndia's real yields have fallen nearly 200 basis points\n\nsince the start of this year, according to Refinitiv data. Real\n\nyields are nominal yields adjusted for inflation.\n\n\"Rupee could suffer the double whammy of growth dent as well\n\nas pressures from capital pulling out of equities in response to\n\ndownbeat growth prospects,\" said Vishnu Varathan, head of\n\neconomics and strategy for Mizuho Bank in Singapore in a note.\n\nThe following table shows rates for Asian currencies against\n\nthe dollar at 0513 GMT.\n\nCURRENCIES VS U.S. DOLLAR\n\nChange on the day\n\nat 0513 GMT\n\nCurrency Latest Previou Pct\n\nbid s day Move\n\nJapan yen 108.75 108.75 +0.00\n\n0\n\nSing dlr 1.369 1.3700 +0.11\n\nTaiwan dlr 30.664 30.722 +0.19\n\nKorean won 1186.4 1187.8 +0.12\n\n00\n\nBaht 30.365 30.39 +0.08\n\nPeso 51.420 51.51 +0.18\n\nRupiah 14160. 14164 +0.03\n\n000\n\nRupee 71.400 71.44 +0.05\n\nRinggit 4.186 4.1935 +0.18\n\nYuan 7.098 7.0950 -0.04\n\nChange so far in\n\n2019\n\nCurrency Latest End Pct\n\nbid 2018 Move\n\nJapan yen 108.75 109.56 +0.74\n\n0\n\nSing dlr 1.369 1.3627 -0.42\n\nTaiwan dlr 30.664 30.733 +0.23\n\nKorean won 1186.4 1115.70 -5.96\n\n00\n\nBaht 30.365 32.55 +7.20\n\nPeso 51.420 52.47 +2.04\n\nRupiah 14160. 14375 +1.52\n\n000\n\nRupee 71.400 69.77 -2.28\n\nRinggit 4.186 4.1300 -1.34\n\nYuan 7.098 6.8730 -3.17\n\nIndia real yields https://tmsnrt.rs/31kNwa2\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n\n", "description": "EM ASIA FX-Most Asian currencies firm on dollar weakness, trade hopes", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEA6Q08X_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
