It roams on its own,\" he said, according to a transcript released Sunday by his office.\n\n\"That's myasthenia gravis. It's a nerve malfunction. I got it from my grandfather,\" he added.\n\nThe condition causes muscle weakness, and can result in drooping of eyelids, blurred vision as well as weakness in one's extremities, according to the US National Institutes of Health.\n\nThe condition can generally be managed with treatment, but up to 20 percent of people who have the disease experience at least one \"crisis\" that requires them to use a ventilator to help breathe, the NIH said.\n\nDuterte gave no indication as to whether he has had any serious incidents as a result of the disease.\n\nHis administration gives out very little information about his health and consistently says the president is in good shape.\n\nDuterte himself, however, has discussed his ailments in his frequent, rambling speeches. In October 2018 he told an audience how he was awaiting the results of a cancer screening.\n\nHis comments sparked immediate concern and speculation, but days later he said the tests had come back negative.\n\nDuterte has also said previously that he suffers from daily migraines and ailments including Buerger's disease, an illness that affects the veins and the arteries of the limbs, and is usually due to smoking.\n\nHe has cited his ill health as the reason for skipping events during summits abroad.\n\nThe president, known for his deadly crackdown on drugs, also revealed in 2016 that he used to take fentanyl, a powerful painkiller, because of a spinal injury from motorcycle accidents.", "description": "Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has disclosed that he suffers from an autoimmune disease that can potentially have serious complications, the latest...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/13/wire-19360934-1570365470-466_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
