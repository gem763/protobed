(AP/AP)\n\nA powerful typhoon swept through Tokyo and the nearby coast early Monday, forcing airlines to cancel more than 100 flights and disrupting the morning commute for millions of people.\n\nTyphoon Faxai was the strongest storm to hit the Japanese capital in years, broadcaster NHK said, causing one death and more than 30 injuries across the region. A woman in her 50s died in Tokyo, police said, with a security camera capturing her being blown off her feet and into a wall, Kyodo news reported.\n\nA blackout left more than 900,000 people without power in two areas surrounding Tokyo, according to Tokyo Electric Power Co. East Japan Railways canceled commuter trains into the capital, while some Shinkansen bullet train services were also disrupted.\n\nTraffic was snarled, schools were closed, and 5,000 people were ordered to evacuate their homes, many of them in the tourist city of Kamakura south of Tokyo, for fear of landslides.\n\nMany flights from Tokyo\u2019s Haneda airport were canceled from Sunday evening. Members of Australia\u2019s rugby team, due to fly in for the Rugby World Cup beginning later this month, were among those forced to delay their travel plans. Scaffolding outside a multistory parking lot at Haneda airport collapsed, while a woman in her 20s was seriously injured when nets and posts at a golf driving range collapsed.\n\n\n\nCommuters wait for train platforms to open at Shinjuku Station on Monday.

The storm brought 17 inches of rain to the city of Izu in Shizuoka prefecture in 24 hours through early Monday, with more than four inches falling in an hour.\n\nBy late Monday morning, the skies had cleared, bringing heat and humidity. Tokyo temperatures were forecast to reach 93-95 Fahrenheit.\n\nTyphoons \u2014 known as hurricanes in the western hemisphere \u2014 regularly form over the Pacific in the late summer and fall months, posing a threat to East Asian population centers.\n\nA separate typhoon struck the Korean Peninsula over the weekend, killing three people in South Korea and five in North Korea, according to local media reports. Typhoon Lingling left 13 people injured in South Korea Saturday and more than 160,000 people without power, according to official reports.\n\nThe storm then struck North Korea, where it left 460 houses and 15 public buildings destroyed or damaged and large amounts of farmland buried or inundated, the official Korean Central News Agency reported.\n\n\n\nPedestrians struggle against strong wind and rain generated by Typhoon Faxai on Monday.
