Microsoft says US presidential campaign accounts targeted by Iran hackers", "language": "en", "text": "A \u2018threat group\u2019 believed to originate in Iran has attacked some 241 email accounts, including some associated with a US presidential campaign and current and former US officials, according to Microsoft.\n\nThe hacking group, dubbed \u201cPhosphorous,\u201d used personal information gathered by researching the targets, including phone numbers, to game password reset and account recovery features and gain entry into their email accounts, Microsoft reported on Friday.\n\nWhile the attacks were \u201cnot technically sophisticated,\u201d they still managed to compromise four of the targeted accounts - though not, Microsoft stressed, any of those associated with presidential campaigns or government officials.\n\nAlso on rt.com Pompeo claims Iran is transferring oil off Syrian coast, calls for international response if cargo is delivered to Damascus\n\nBetween August and September, Phosphorous made over 2,700 attempts to identify targets\u2019 email accounts and then attacked 241 of them, Microsoft claims. In addition to government figures, they went after journalists and prominent Iranian expats. The amount of personal information used suggests the hackers are \u201chighly motivated and willing to invest significant time and resources\u201d gathering information, the company warned.\n\nMicrosoft believes Phosphorous is connected to the Iranian government, though the company did not explain how it reached that conclusion, and that they are operating from within Iran.\n\nAlso on rt.com Iran says it foiled ASSASSINATION plot against elite Quds brigade commander Soleimani\n\nThe company also took the opportunity to advertise its AccountGuard software, which monitors sign-in efforts and password resets, and its \u201cDefending Democracy Program,\u201d including ElectionGuard - a \u201ccybersecurity toolkit\u201d developed in partnership with a defense contractor owned by the Pentagon to \u201csecure\u201d democratic elections. The latter has raised eyebrows from privacy advocates who don\u2019t believe the Pentagon has any business \u201cprotecting\u201d the vote.\n\nEven before specific information about whose accounts had been targeted emerged, Twitter\u2019s blue-checks were already blaming President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cTrump's open invitation to foreign government intelligence services that they should interfere in our elections has been received loud and clear,\u201d smirked one user. \u201cInterference in our elections is OK only when President Trump personally invites it\u2014at least that\u2019s the message we\u2019ll soon be hearing,\u201d sneered another.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee circulated an alert warning that Phosphorous may \u201ccreate believable spear phishing emails and fake LinkedIn profiles as primary tactics\u201d and warned officials to beef up their security.\n\nHere's the security alert the DNC sent out to all presidential campaigns about a hacking attempt Microsoft says was tied to Iran. pic.twitter.com/0XrDLBdl5j \u2014 Donie O'Sullivan (@donie) October 4, 2019\n\nThe US has targeted Iran with cyberattacks of its own for nearly a decade, starting with the Stuxnet virus developed in conjunction with Israeli intelligence that was used to knock out Iranian nuclear centrifuges in 2010 and allegedly including attacks on rocket launch pads and other infrastructure. Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif warned Washington last month that while the US may have started the cyber-war, \u201cit won\u2019t be able to finish\u201d it.\n\nIf you like this story, share it with a friend!", "description": "A \u2018threat group\u2019 believed to originate in Iran has attacked some 241 email accounts, including some associated with a US presidential campaign and current and former US officials, according to Microsoft.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5d9778eb2030275a145b76d3.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
