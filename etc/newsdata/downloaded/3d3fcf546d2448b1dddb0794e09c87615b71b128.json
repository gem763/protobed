The company is currently pushing every single carrier to move to RCS from SMS \u2014 a much-needed upgrade \u2014 and that will have a significant impact on your texting, selfie-sending, and GIF-blasting going forward. Here's everything you need to know.\n\nHow To Manually Enable RCS On Android Right Now It\u2019s been a while since Google announced plans to push RCS adoption so that Android users could finally move on from the outdated SMS technology, but most users are stuck waiting for their mobile carriers to flip the switch at some point in 2020\u2014that is, unless you decide to take matters into your own hands and flip those switches yourself. Read more\n\nWhat is RCS?\n\nRCS (short for Rich Communication Services) is the next iteration of carrier text messaging technology, but it\u2019s actually been around in one form or another since it was first proposed in 2007. The originally agreed-upon RCS standard, known as Universal Profile, included a number of enhancements over SMS messaging:\n\n8,000 character limits per message (versus SMS\u2019s 160 limit)\n\nSupports read receipts and displays when the other person is typing\n\nWeb-based chat and cross-platform message syncing\n\nUses WiFi and mobile data to send messages\n\nGroup chat\n\nNative audio messaging support\n\nEnd-to-end message encryption\n\nWhile those features might look like standard offerings in today\u2019s most popular messaging apps, they\u2019re a massive upgrade over SMS \u2014 basically, bringing an iMessage-like service to the ancient format.\n\nUnfortunately, adoption of RCS by mobile carriers, developers, and phone manufacturers hasn\u2019t really taken off due to the network and software updates required to implement it. Since RCS recently received an enthusiastic backing from Google \u2014 mighty arbiter of Android OS, a phone manufacturer, and a service provider itself \u2014 change is coming, but Google\u2019s version of RCS differs a bit from Universal Profile.\n\nIntroducing the \u201cChat\u201d Protocol\n\nYou may have seen Google\u2019s new text-messaging technology referred to as \u201cChat.\u201d Despite the name sounding like a dedicated app, Chat is actually the RCS protocol developed by Google in cooperation with several other manufacturers and carriers. It\u2019s basically identical to Universal Profile, save for one major difference: Chat does not support end-to-end encryption (though messages sent through Universal Profile-based services/apps will be, provided users meet the requirements).\n\nThe lack of end-to-end encryption is a glaring omission, but it\u2019s not that surprising. Google has been axing or repurposing its first-party messaging apps with encryption, including Allo and Hangouts, and instead suggesting that users migrate to the the Chat-based Android Messages app. Additionally, Android Messages will soon be the standard texting app on all Google phones and many other Android devices.\n\nHow to Use RCS\n\nIn order to send and receive RCS messages, all participants in the conversation must be using:\n\nAn RCS-supported phone on an RCS-supported network(s)\n\nThe same Chat- or Universal Profile-based texting app\n\nIf either requirement is missing, your messages will be converted to SMS instead.\n\nIf you need to know whether your carrier supports RCS messaging \u2014 or your favourite app \u2014 we recommend bookmarking this handy guide that a number of Redditors from /r/UniversalProfile have been working on. It\u2019s a great way to see, at a glance, what you need to do to get RCS messaging working on your device/carrier/app combination (if it does).\n\nFinally, a quick word on Apple\u2019s RCS support. iOS cannot currently support RCS. However, iMessage includes many of the same features as RCS, but (obviously) only works when you\u2019re texting between Apple devices. Apple has recently signalled an interest in future RCS support, but the company\u2019s timeline for rolling it out (if it does) is anyone\u2019s guess right now.", "description": "Google has officially adopted the next-gen \u201cRCS\u201d text messaging protocol - and you can get it on your phone right now.
