He\u2019d known nothing but victory against the Welsh since his test career began in 2009. He had 11 straight wins over them until the 9-6 defeat in Cardiff on a late Dan Biggar penalty.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the only time I\u2019ve lost (to them),\u201d he said on Tuesday in Tokyo. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t changed my mindset heading into the game (this weekend) and I hope that\u2019s the case for the rest of the guys because we\u2019ve had plenty of success against them.\u201d\n\nGenia, who has two tries against the Welsh, said the key to victory against them was patience and perseverance.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re happy to play without the ball for long periods of time. They back their defensive system, and back their workrate and fitness,\u201d he said. \u201cIn terms of breaking them down it\u2019s going to take patience, going to take holding on to the ball for long periods of time, and sort of being smart about how we attack as well.\u201d\n\nThe veteran scrumhalf said the Welsh were very disciplined in their approach to the game, with or without the ball.\n\n\u201cVery, very good defensive side, so it\u2019s going to be very hard to break them down with ball in hand,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re also a very good kicking team, very good aerially, so they\u2019ve got a lot of the fundamentals covered really well.\n\n\u201c(But) we\u2019re coming at them with a strategy that we think will expose any chinks we see.\u201d\n\nGenia\u2019s faith was such that he didn\u2019t bother, on his day off Monday, to watch live the Wales-Georgia match, in expectation of seeing enough video analysis this week.\n\nHis last match against Wales was his 99th cap, and he started the next week against England for his 100th. But since then, he has mainly backed up Nic White, and it\u2019s a role the Wallabies\u2019 starting scrumhalf through the 2011 and 2015 World Cups is content with.\n\n\u201cWhether I play five minutes, 10 minutes, 60 minutes, I\u2019m more than happy,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t mind.\n\n\u201cI enjoy the working relationship with Nic White. We see the game in a very similar way, and that\u2019s good because it\u2019s not much of a change for guys around us.\u201d\n\nHis experience has also helped him watch the game from the stands and see what\u2019s working and what isn\u2019t. Last Saturday in Sapporo, he and the reserves noticed their forwards were gaining in ascendancy on Fiji while they were trailing on the scoreboard. Genia replaced White in the 51st minute with the Wallabies still five points behind. Genia said they needed to attack through the forwards more, and it worked. They scored two tries from mauls within the next 10 minutes and turned the game around. Australia won 39-21 from 21-12 down.\n\n\u201cA lot of people say, \u2018You\u2019re backed in a corner,\u2019 but we have complete trust in how we play the game, and have trust in the individuals who are out there as well to adapt on the run,\u201d Genia said. \u201cThe whole team adapted pretty well.\u201d\n\nThe same in the 2015 World Cup, when Australia played Wales in a pool decider at Twickenham. Genia was yellow-carded in the 56th minute for a cynical foul and didn\u2019t return. Australia was leading 15-6 at the time. Another yellow card dropped Australia to 13 players but they held on.\n\nApart from the disappointment of being sin-binned, Genia said his memories of that game were of awe.\n\n\u201cJust an immense defensive effort,\u201d he said, recalling how Welsh winger George North was held up over the line, \u201cthen a couple of plays later they had a six-on-three and we snuffed it out and got a penalty.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust patience \u2026 patience with the ball and without,\u201d he said, reiterating his theme. \u201cWe speak about that being a strength for them but it\u2019s going to be something that we have to have come Sunday as well.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "In his last match against Wales, he lost.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Foster Niumata"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
