They want to stay and fight, but in Syria there is no sustainable victory to be had. The President has said since he was a candidate that we would destroy the territorial caliphate and leave. He is fulfilling his obligation to the American people who put him in office. That is who our obligation is to, not the Kurds.\n\nThe fighting spirit of our servicemembers is what makes our military strong and reflects the best of our nation, but without sober, pragmatic civilian leadership, this mentality is the essential recipe for endless war. The President, in his own bombastic way, has returned civilian leadership to the military that has been absent for a long time.\n\nThe other major issue that pundits are missing concerns the larger strategic fight against Russia and Iran in the region.", "description": "", "authors": ["Joe Kent", "Cnn.Com Opinions Syria-Kurds-Trump-Withdrawal-Kent Index.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
