Cult-favourite products from the brand appear in miniature form, such as the lip gloss shade \u201cfu$$y\u201d and the liquid body highlighter \u201cwho needs clothes?\u201d, alongside four new shades of the \"gloss bomb\" lip gloss formula, a new liquid lipstick and a highlighter.\n\nWe got our hands on some of the products from the new collection to help you decide if any of them should make your Christmas list this year.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews. We may earn commission from some of the retailers, but we never allow this to influence selections, which are formed from real-world testing and expert advice. This revenue helps to fund journalism across The Independent.\n\nThe \u201cglosse posse\u201d lip gloss set features five minis that come in a cute tin which isn\u2019t too festive, so you can use it after Christmas. Aside from \u201cfu$$y\u201d, a dusty pink shade that is already a best-seller, the four new colours are varied, from the iridescent opal shade, \u201cconfetti\u201d, to a hot fushia pink, \u201cpretty please\u201d.\n\nThe shades are less daunting on the lips than they seem in the bottle. We were expecting a bit more colour pay-off from the brown shade, \u201cchocolit\u201d, but we love the orange one named \u201ccheeky\u201d.\n\nThe new minis have the same great qualities as previous shades: they aren't sticky, have a subtle shimmer and feature the brand's signature peach-vanilla scent. At \u00a333 for five 5.5ml lip glosses, the set is good value, considering one standard sized gloss is \u00a316.\n\nNext up is a mini \u201cstunna lip paint\u201d in a new deep burgundy shade, \u201cunderdawg\u201d. This is our favourite packaging from the collection as you can hang it on your Christmas tree, genius.\n\nThe longwear matte lipstick would look great on all skin tones and is the perfect dramatic, dark shade for the winter months. It stays put all day too. Again, this is a decent size for a mini at 2ml and the packaging is just as luxurious as the originals.\n\nArguably the best kind of product to buy in a miniature version is the new travel-sized body lava, a gel-based body highlighter that is another firm favourite from the Fenty collection, perfect for taking on holiday.\n\nThis launch features \u201cwho needs clothes\u201d, a rich gold shimmer that looks great on everyone and it\u2019s less yellow toned than the brand\u2019s other \u201ctrophy wife\u201d highlighter shade. Stock up for summer 2020 ladies.\n\nThe verdict: Fenty Beauty tinsel $how collection\n\nAll in all, we\u2019re impressed with this launch \u2013 the packaging is sparkly enough to pay homage to the festive season without being tacky, while the minis are good value. The new shades are diverse so there\u2019s something for everyone here, standouts are the \"gloss bomb\" lip gloss in the shade \u201ccheeky\u201d and the new \"lil stunna\" lip paint in the shade \u201cunderdawg\u201d\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
