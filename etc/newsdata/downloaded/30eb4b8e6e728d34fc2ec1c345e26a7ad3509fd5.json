But he said he would \u201creluctantly endorse\u201d a face mask ban as an alternative to a general curfew, an idea recently suggested by some pro-Beijing hard-liners.\n\nJasper Tsang, the founder of the biggest pro-Beijing political party and the president of the legislature until 2016, said that there had been deep divisions at the highest levels of the Hong Kong government for many weeks on whether to go ahead with the ban.\n\n\u201cThe government has been weighing the pros and cons, and those who are against it argue it wouldn\u2019t help much,\u201d he said, while adding that advocates for the idea saw it as a possible way to curb violence.\n\nOpponents of a face mask ban made two arguments, Mr. Tsang said. One was that it could be hard to enforce. France has such a ban, but it has not prevented many so-called yellow vest protesters from wearing them anyway.\n\nImposing a face mask ban could also hurt the government\u2019s effort to persuade Hong Kong\u2019s public, its tourists and the international business community that most of the city is safe most of the time, he said.", "description": "The chief executive used her emergency powers to bypass the legislature, a step long feared by opposition lawmakers and some observers.", "authors": ["Keith Bradsher", "Daniel Victor"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/04/world/04hk-emergency-1/04hk-emergency-1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
