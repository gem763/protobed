Should Wales defeat South Africa in the other semi-final, Welshman Owens would likely be precluded from officiating in the final.\n\nFrench referee Jerome Garces will take charge of Sunday's semi-final between South Africa and Wales, with England's Wayne Barnes and New Zealander Ben O'Keeffe as touchline officials and New Zealander Ben Skeen as TMO. Garces handled the England-Australia quarter-final on Saturday.\n\n'These are the best of the best, supported by a superb team, and we now look forward to compelling semi-finals,' World Rugby chairman Bill Beaumont said.", "description": "World Rugby has sidelined Jaco Peyper from officiating at any of the World Cup semifinals and appointed Nigel Owens as referee of the knockout game between New Zealand and England.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/09/19967754-0-image-a-4_1571731972850.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
