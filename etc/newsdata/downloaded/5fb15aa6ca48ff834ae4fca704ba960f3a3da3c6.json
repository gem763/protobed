Photo: David Giesbrecht/Netflix\n\nSpoilers ahead for The Politician and the New York State constitution.\n\nThe Politician is a truly bonkers show. A show so bonkers that by the time Judith Light shows up in the season finale as Dede Standish, the Speaker of the New York State Senate, flanked by her chief of staff Bette Midler, you\u2019re just nodding along like, Yes, this is happening. Sure! As the finale reveals, a Democratic senator-elect from Texas has invited Standish to join his yet-to-be-announced presidential campaign as vice-president. Okay! Which means she\u2019s not putting any muscle into running for reelection for her current position, leaving space for a young, unknown challenger full of ideas and charm to wedge his way in there.\n\nEnter Payton Hobart (Ben Platt), the politician of The Politician, who ends the season announcing his campaign for Standish\u2019s State Senate seat. After an hour-long finale in which we learn he ended up at NYU after Harvard rescinded his acceptance, he\u2019s since developed a drinking problem, and he spends his nights playing piano at Marie\u2019s Crisis. Sure!!! Oh, and did I mention Hobart\u2019s friends-slash-advisers have uncovered what they believe to be Standish\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel \u2026 her secret three-way marriage. See? This show is the definition of a lot.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m spiraling. Back to Hobart\u2019s run for State Senate. If The Politician occurred in a world even remotely resembling our present reality, his political aspirations would already be dead in the water. When he opens the episode vamping at Marie\u2019s about what it means to be a New Yorker, he mentions he moved to the city three years earlier. (Then he does a full-on performance of \u201cVienna,\u201d which I will be discussing with my therapist imminently.) Assuming he filed his paperwork immediately upon moving from California to New York \u2014 and, let\u2019s be honest, Payton Hobart would be the kind of person to get a new license within that required 30-day window after you move \u2014 this means three years is the maximum length of time he\u2019s been a resident of the state. A spokesperson for the New York Board of Elections told me that would disqualify Hobart from running.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to comment on a TV show I have not seen, but for New York State Senate, which is different from United States senators, you have to be a citizen, you have to be 18 years of age, and you have to be a resident of the state for five years and a resident of the district for 12 months immediately preceding election,\u201d she said, noting the requirements are the same for the New York State Assembly. \u201cPart of that comes from the New York State Constitution and the other part is the Public Officers Law.\u201d (She also asked if I\u2019d recommend The Politician. \u201cUh, it\u2019s definitely an insane show,\u201d I answered.)\n\nHobart does meet some of the requirements. Being a citizen? Being 18? Being a resident of the district where you\u2019re running for 12 months immediately preceding the election? Check, check, and check, since I\u2019m going to assume Hobart isn\u2019t changing his residential status to go home to California for the summer. Given that his billionaire father disowned him in favor of Hobart\u2019s twin brothers who tried to commit patricide and that his mother, Gwyneth Paltrow, is finding her bliss in, uh [checks notes], Bhutan.\n\nBut that still leaves the problem of the five-year-minimum residency rule. It appears to already be an election year. When Hobart\u2019s perpetually suit-clad friend McAfee arrives at Standish\u2019s office for an internship, she is tasked with mailing out flyers. \u201cThe election is November 6 and we want these in the mail the first week of October,\u201d she\u2019s told. \u201cYou\u2019ve got time.\u201d It seems unlikely that a candidate like Dede Standish, who has faced no real competition in years past, would bother putting in a years-early effort for the election. But when during election year is it?\n\nAlas, the scenery and wardrobe choices in the finale aren\u2019t totally indicative. In the first few scenes, there are no leaves on the trees and the sidewalks have a damp glisten. The cast is clad in coats and hats and turtleneck sweaters. When Hobart visits Harvard, again wearing a scarf and light jacket, the campus still has green grass. During a walk in the park, everybody is wearing coats, it\u2019s drizzling, and the trees are dotted with distinctly brown and dead leaves. Which leaves us a few options. Either it\u2019s late spring of election year, which seems unlikely given even the most incompetent intern wouldn\u2019t need six months to affix labels to 300,000 mailers. Or \u2026 it\u2019s September. (But September in a world where September is still autumnal and temperatures aren\u2019t consistently 90 degrees and wearing wool is not a painful thing to do.) Either way, it\u2019s impossible for Hobart to hit the five-year residency mark and make his run legitimate.", "description": "In the final episode of The Politician, Ben Platt\u2019s character Payton Hobart announces he\u2019s running for New York State Senate.
