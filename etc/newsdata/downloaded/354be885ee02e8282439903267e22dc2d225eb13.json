Or he could labor in the prison\u2019s kitchen to earn money to buy extra food at the commissary.\n\nCruz went to work. But his $1-a-day salary at the privately run Adelanto Detention Facility did not stretch far.\n\nA can of commissary tuna sold for $3.25. That is more than four times the price at a Target store near the small desert town of Adelanto, about two hours northeast of Los Angeles. Cruz stuck with ramen noodles at 58 cents a package, double the Target price. A miniature deodorant stick, at $3.35 and more than three days\u2019 wages, was an impossible luxury, he said.\n\n\u201cIf I bought that there wouldn\u2019t be enough money for food,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nTuna and deodorant would seem minor worries for detainees such as Cruz. Now 25, he sought asylum after fleeing gangs trying to recruit him in his native Honduras, a place where saying \u201cno\u201d can mean execution.\n\nBut immigration attorneys say the pricey commissary goods are part of a broader strategy by private prisons to harness cheap inmate labor to lower operating costs and boost profits.\n\nImmigrants and activists say facilities such as Adelanto, owned by Boca Raton, Fla.-based Geo Group Inc (GEO.N), the nation\u2019s largest for-profit corrections company, deliberately skimp on essentials, even food, to coerce detainees to labor for pennies an hour to supplement meager rations.\n\nGeo Group spokesperson Pablo Paez called those allegations \u201ccompletely false.\u201d He said detainees are given meals approved by dieticians, the labor program is strictly voluntary, and wage rates are federally mandated.\n\nThe company said Geo Group contracts with outside vendors to run its commissaries, whose prices \u201care in line with comparable local markets.\u201d It also said Geo Group makes a \u201cminimal commission\u201d on commissary items, most of which goes into a \u201cwelfare fund\u201d to purchase recreational equipment and other items for detainees.\n\nRelatives can send money electronically to fund their loved ones\u2019 commissary accounts, for fees that can reach as high as 10 percent of the amount deposited, some families report. But for many immigrant detainees, scrubbing toilets or mopping floors is the only way they say they can earn enough to stay clean and fed.\n\nYou \u201ceither work for a few cents an hour or live without basic things like soap, shampoo, deodorant and food,\u201d detainee Wilhen Hill Barrientos, 67, said in a class-action lawsuit filed last year by the Southern Poverty Law Center against Nashville-based CoreCivic Inc (CXW.N), the nation\u2019s second-largest for-profit prison operator. In the complaint, Barrientos said guards told him to \u201cuse his fingers\u201d when he asked for toilet paper at the Stewart Detention Center, located in rural Lumpkin, Georgia.\n\nDetainees are challenging what they say is an oppressive business model in which the companies deprive them of essentials to force them to work for sub-minimum wages, money that is soon recaptured in the firms\u2019 own commissaries.\n\n\u201cThese private prison companies are profiting off of what is essentially a company-store scenario,\u201d said the SPLC\u2019s Meredith Stewart, a lead attorney on the class action.\n\nImmigrant rights groups have filed similar lawsuits against CoreCivic and Geo Group in California, Colorado, Texas and Washington.\n\nGovernment watchdogs and lawmakers are taking notice too.\n\nIn November, 11 U.S. senators, including 2020 presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, sent letters to Geo Group and CoreCivic lambasting the \u201cperverse profit incentive at the core of the private prison business,\u201d which has benefited from a crackdown on illegal immigrants under U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nThe senators cited a December 2017 report from the U.S. Office of the Inspector General documenting problems at lockups contracted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The inspector general found spoiled, moldy and expired food, and cited detainees\u2019 complaints that hygiene products were \u201cnot provided promptly or at all,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe lawmakers have demanded Geo Group and CoreCivic respond to allegations of detainee mistreatment.\n\nGeo Group said a comprehensive, detailed response is underway. The company told Reuters that Geo Group has \u201calready taken steps to remedy areas where our processes fell short of our commitment to high-quality care.\u201d\n\nCoreCivic spokeswoman Amanda Gilchrist said the company disagrees with the senators\u2019 assertions, and that it provides \u201call daily needs\u201d of detainees.\n\nShe said CoreCivic follows all federal standards for ICE-contracted facilities, including management of the outside vendors that run its commissaries, prices for commissary products, and fees charged to families for depositing funds into detainees\u2019 commissary accounts.\n\nBULL MARKET IN IMMIGRANT DETENTION\n\nThe U.S. for-profit prison industry has exploded over the past two decades. In 2016, 128,300 people - roughly 1 in 12 U.S. prisoners - were incarcerated in private lock-ups. That is an increase of 47 percent from 2000, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics.\n\nGeo Group and CoreCivic together manage over half of U.S. private prison contracts, with combined revenues of nearly $4 billion in 2017. ICE is the No. 1 customer by revenue for both companies.\n\nTrump\u2019s immigration polices have been a boon for the industry, which spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on his election and inauguration. In fiscal 2019, the number of people in ICE detention has averaged 45,200 daily, according to agency spokesman Vincent Picard. That is up nearly 19 percent from fiscal 2017.\n\nBoth Geo Group and CoreCivic have added hundreds of immigration detention beds over the past year. Stock prices for the two companies are up about 30 percent since Trump\u2019s election.\n\nThe government pays private prison companies fees ranging from roughly $60 to $130 daily for the care and feeding of each detainee.\n\nAt CoreCivic\u2019s Stewart Detention Center in Georgia, which houses about 1,700 undocumented immigrants, ICE pays a per diem of $62.03 for each detainee housed there. CoreCivic\u2019s revenue from Stewart alone was $38 million last year, court records show.\n\nDetainee Barrientos, the lead lawsuit plaintiff, said in court documents he worked 7 days a week at the facility in order to purchase hygiene products and phone cards to call family members in Guatemala.\n\nThose basics can add up. Reuters viewed a copy of the center\u2019s commissary price list. It shows detainees are charged $11.02 for a 4 oz. tube of Sensodyne toothpaste, available on Amazon.com for $5.20.\n\nDove soap priced at $2.44 at the commissary is available for just over a dollar at Target. A 2.5 oz tube of Effergrip denture cream that sells for $4.99 at Walmart is $7.12 at the commissary.\n\nFees are pricey too. Vioney Gutierrez, a former detainee at Geo Group\u2019s Adelanto facility in California, said 10 percent of the money her family spent to fund her commissary account was consumed by fees.\n\n\u201cWhen my daughter put in $40, I got $36,\u201d said Gutierrez, 37. A native of Mexico, she said she spent six months at Adelanto in 2018 after asking for asylum at a port of entry. She is currently out on bond and staying with family in Oregon while she awaits the outcome of her deportation case.\n\nGeo Group said its inmate commissary account services are provided by a third-party vendor, and that it does not profit from those transactions.\n\nAt Adelanto, Gutierrez said it cost $1 a minute to make calls to Mexico, and even more to places further afield, prices that keep many detainees from communicating with their families.\n\nGeo Group said ICE contracts with a third-party telecom vendor and that the company plays \u201cno role whatsoever in communications services.\u201d\n\nFILE PHOTO: Immigrants sit in a cell for incoming ICE detainees at the Adelanto immigration detention center, which is run by the Geo Group Inc (GEO.N), in Adelanto, California, U.S., April 13, 2017.

But for immigrant detainees, many of whom borrowed money or drained savings to reach the United States, the prices are particularly prohibitive.\n\nCruz, the Honduran detainee, spent eight months at Adelanto last year before an immigrant rights organization paid the $10,000 bond for his release. He is now in Texas awaiting the outcome of his case.\n\nIn his final months at Adelanto, Cruz said he resorted to bartering, trading shoes he wove out of plastic bags for ramen and cookies.", "description": "Detained in a California lockup with hundreds of other immigrants seeking asylum, Duglas Cruz faced a choice.", "authors": ["Michelle Conlin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190118&t=2&i=1347288018&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF0H0AN", "published_at": "2019-01-18"}
