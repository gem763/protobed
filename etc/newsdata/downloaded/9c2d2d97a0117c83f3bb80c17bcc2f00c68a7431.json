It\u2019s not our fault. It\u2019s not our problem,\u201d Pippen says in the episode. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to get to the bathroom and get in someone\u2019s business.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy does it personally offend you that I care that someone is upset in the bathroom?\u201d Howard asks, to which Pippen responds, \u201cYou don\u2019t even know the story.\u201d\n\nWhen clips of the heated exchange made it to Instagram, fans shared their views on Pippen\u2019s apparent lack of empathy.\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t she mind her business with Jordyn?

They also have called me told me things about my situation and that\u2019s what friends do!!! But I\u2019m in another country watching a couple fight all night long like what does that have to do with us. We\u2019re drinking enjoying my friends bday trip. The house I wanting us to go to was my longtime friends house.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Larsa Pippen Claims There Were \u2018Situations\u2019 with Jordyn Woods, Tristan Thompson Before Scandal\n\nAnother commenter took issue with Pippen and wrote, \u201cI\u2019m sorry but I\u2019m the caring friend, [if] I see someone crying I\u2019ll be the first to ask them if they are ok.\u201d\n\nPippen then replied to the user and said, \u201cRight a friend!!! If I knew them I would have. They were arguing all night like I\u2019m not in Turks to counsel anyone I don\u2019t know. And we were all drinking so who knows how the night could have ended.\u201d\n\nFurther explaining her actions, on Sunday, Pippen tweeted, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to be dismissive to Sarah I just didn\u2019t think we should be getting involved in any type of domestic situation when we\u2019re out of the county #KUWTK.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t mean to be dismissive to Sarah I just didn\u2019t think we should be getting involved in any type of domestic situation when we\u2019re out of the county #KUWTK \u2014 Larsa Pippen (@larsapippen) October 21, 2019\n\nI know that @larsapippen is a great friend to Kourt and she has a great heart.
