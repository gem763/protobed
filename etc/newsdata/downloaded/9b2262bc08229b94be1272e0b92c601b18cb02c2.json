I remain confident that our mission will be successful and appreciate the support of millions of citizens who support our effort to preserve unborn life.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, which has been active in lawsuits against the many states that have passed abortion restrictions in recent months, tweeted that the decision means \u201cnone of the state abortion bans passed earlier this year are in effect\u201d and listed Georgia, Missouri, Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Ohio and Utah as having similar laws that have also been blocked.\n\nAlabama: BLOCKED \u2696\ufe0f\u2705\n\n\n\nGeorgia: BLOCKED \u2696\ufe0f\u2705\n\n\n\nMissouri: BLOCKED \u2696\ufe0f\u2705\n\n\n\nArkansas: BLOCKED \u2696\ufe0f\u2705\n\n\n\nKentucky: BLOCKED \u2696\ufe0f\u2705\n\n\n\nOhio: BLOCKED \u2696\ufe0f\u2705\n\n\n\nUtah: BLOCKED \u2696\ufe0f\u2705\n\n\n\nPoliticians, listen closely: We have a constitutional right to abortion. If you try to ban it, we will see you in court. \u2014 ACLU (@ACLU) October 29, 2019\n\nThe Alabama bill was tumultuous from the start, with an argument breaking out during one of its introductions. The bill, which did pass 25-6, is even more restrictive than prior state-level abortion laws, and it includes a penalty of up to 99 years in prison for doctors who perform abortions. Six of the Senate\u2019s Democrats voted against the bill \u2014 one abstained \u2014 and they staged a filibuster late into the night in May after debating the bill for more than four hours. The divide included hundreds of protesters outside the Montgomery Capitol, including women who had given birth after rape and incest and supported the bill. Some abortion rights advocates dressed in \u201cHandmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d red robes, with one captured in a viral photograph giving the middle finger to the building as senators debated inside.\n\nBoth sides reacted with similar passion on Tuesday to U.S. District Court in Middle Alabama Judge Myron H. Thompson\u2019s decision to issue an injunction against the law going into effect.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, which has more than 1,200 chapters on college and high school campuses, accused \u201cthe abortion industry\u201d of \u201cusing the judges in their pocket to usurp the will of the voters.\u201d Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey said in a statement that she signed it into law \u201cas a testament to Alabamians\u2019 long-standing belief that every human life is sacred\u201d and said she is trusting the attorney general to do \u201ceverything he can to challenge today\u2019s ruling and obtain a just result.\"\n\nAmanda Reyes, executive director at Yellowhammer Fund, a grass-roots organization that helps low-income women pay for abortions, said that while she is relieved to learn that abortion will remain legal in Alabama, \u201cthis changes nothing when it comes to the crisis marginalized communities have faced and will continue to face when it comes to accessing a termination.\u201d\n\n\u201cConservative lawmakers hope that the American public will forget about our state and those who remain unable to easily, quickly and affordably access safe abortion care even with the total abortion ban being put on hold,\u201d Reyes said. We will \u201cnot allow their needs to go unmet or their struggles to be forgotten.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Alabama's near-total ban, set to take effect Nov. 15 but now blocked, included no exceptions for rape or incest and made performing abortions a felony.", "authors": ["Ariana Eunjung Cha", "National Reporter", "Emily Wax-Thibodeaux", "National Reporter Covering Breaking News", "Social Movements."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/nQOFROKw8P4jIhxadB4oEpPXlZA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TYUGSBD4FAI6TMPTWIZ74WAR54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
