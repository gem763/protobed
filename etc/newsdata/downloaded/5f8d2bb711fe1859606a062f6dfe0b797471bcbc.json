Lee Merritt, an attorney who handles civil rights cases that involve police misconduct allegations, said his office was representing Atatiana\u2019s family.\n\n\u201cBefore law enforcement goes about their pattern of villainizing this beautiful peaceful woman, turning her into a suspect, a silhouette, or threat, let me tell you about [her,]\u201d Mr Merritt wrote.\n\n\u201cShe was a premed graduate of Xavier University. She was very close to her family. She was the auntie that stayed up on Friday night playing video games with her 8-year-old nephew.\n\n\u201cHer mom had recently gotten very sick, so she was home taking care of the house and loving her life.\n\n\u201cThere was no reason for her to be murdered. None. We must have justice,\u201d Mr Merritt wrote.\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\nMr Smith, who has lived on the street for 50 years, said he feels as though the shooting was his fault \u2013 even though he was just trying to be a good neighbour.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m shaken. I\u2019m mad. I\u2019m upset. And I feel it\u2019s partly my fault,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf I had never dialled the police department, she\u2019d still be alive.\u201d\n\nMayor Betsy Price called on Fort Worth to support Atatiana\u2019s family following the shooting.\n\n\u201cWriting a statement like this is tragic and something that should never be necessary,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cA young woman has lost her life, leaving her family in unbelievable grief.\n\n\u201cAll of Fort Worth must surround Atatiana Jefferson\u2019s family with prayers, love and support.\u201d\n\nPolice say they are completing \"an extremely thorough investigation.\"\n\nThe officer in question has been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome.", "description": "Police were called to the Texas home of Atatiana Jefferson at around 2.30am on Saturday after a neighbour noticed her front door wide open and became concerned", "authors": ["Amber Hicks", "Image", "Facebook"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20571738.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Atatiana-Jefferson.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
