The joke was that it was all Sharon and Ozzy\u2019s doing.'\n\nHe went on to suggest that because she wan't on the panel anymore, she got her rocker husband to send the bats over to 'disrupt the show'.\n\nMeanwhile, former popstar Sinitta, who was also present during the audience, revealed she feared the flying beasts would take off with Simon's beloved dogs.\n\nShock: Famous faces including the stars of Love Island descended upon the music mogul's luxury abode to audition for him and fellow judges Louis and Nicole Scherzinger\n\nCausing trouble?

I was worried they might take Simon\u2019s dogs Squiddly and Diddly off in their beaks.'\n\nMailOnline have contacted representatives of the X Factor for comment.\n\nMeanwhile, Simon recently revealed exactly why he decided to revamp the much-loved show to do a celebrity version.\n\n'It just felt so obvious to do a celebrity version', he explained. 'The only condition was I couldn\u2019t know who was going to be on it.\n\n'I said to the team, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to find some acts who you believe can sell records off the back of this, because if you don\u2019t do that it won\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nUh oh: Reports suggest that things at the auditions got off to a shaky start as bats swooped down over the guests at Simon's home, forcing producers to halt filming\n\n'So that was the deal and we stuck to it. I swear to God I didn\u2019t have a clue who any of the acts were. I did walk away thinking, \u201cIf we\u2019re smart, we have artists here who could actually sell records off the back of this\u201d. So I thought that was fun and very exciting for the show.'\n\nThe music boss also shared how he felt about holding the auditions in his own back garden.\n\nHe said: 'When we filmed it that night it didn\u2019t feel like work. I loved every second of it. I said to the producers, \u201cIf this really doesn\u2019t work, we will have to re-audition for the show. That\u2019s the deal.\u201d\n\n'So the fact that I felt we didn\u2019t need to was just great. I found it interesting and fun, and doing this version of the show has also given me the chance to do All Stars. I\u2019ve wanted to make the best of the best version of The X Factor for a long, long time. It\u2019s been brilliant. I\u2019ve loved every minute.'\n\nX Factor: Celebrity starts Saturday at 8.40pm on ITV.", "description": "X Factor: Celebrity was thrown into chaos as BATS disrupted filming at Simon Cowell's luxury LA villa, with Louis Walsh blaming former judge Sharon Osbourne.", "authors": ["Niomi Harris For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/09/19621988-0-image-a-22_1570870708608.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
