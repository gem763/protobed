He was sentenced to detention and \u00addismissed from the service with disgrace. Donaldson, who later said he did it \u201cfor a laugh\u201d, got five years.\n\nYesterday, prison sources stressed Cook had received \u201cnot a custodial \u00adsentence but a military sentence\u201d.\n\nA Ministry of Justice spokesman said: \u201cAll Prison Service staff undergo \u00adrigorous checks and will only be employed after a full risk-assessment.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE:Christopher Cook spent 15 months in a military detention centre following a degrading stunt on a fellow recruit and now Justice sources say he has been 'rehabilitated'", "authors": ["Dan Warburton", "Image", "Solent News", "Swns", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20732129.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-PROD-Christopher-Cook-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
