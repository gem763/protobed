You might be dating one \u2013 and you don't even know it\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t deal in base desires such as social media. I pursue beautiful women and even more beautiful poetry.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve dreamt of you in colors that don\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy parents live in Hoxton. But I live in the moment.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever sent or received a message similar to this, you may already know what a softboi is. If not, you\u2019re probably thinking it\u2019s a meaningless new dating term I\u2019ve just made up (after all, I\u2019ve done it before). But you\u2019d be wrong.\n\nSoftboi behaviour is nothing new, but the term itself has rapidly grown in popularity in recent years. The most notable example in recent popular culture can be found in Kyle Scheible, the love interest played by Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet in Lady Bird. As well as playing bass in a band called L\u2019Enfance Nue, he has lines such as \u201cWhat you do is very baller. You\u2019re very anarchist.\u201d\n\nTo learn more \u2013 and see just how extensive the trend is \u2013 the Instagram page Beam Me Up Soft Boi is the best available resource. It has amassed more than 200,000 followers since being set up last year to document softbois, and receives up to 300 submissions a day. I spoke to Iona, who runs the account and recently wrote an A to Z guide to softbois, to get to the bottom of it.\n\nHi Iona. For anyone unfamiliar with the term, what is a softboi?\n\nThere\u2019s a softboi spectrum. At one end, it\u2019s just anyone who has any unique or alternative interests that make them feel superior to other people. At the other end is quite hardcore emotionally manipulative men who use these interests to really mess about with women or men. But there\u2019s so many people in between on the spectrum so there\u2019s no one real definition.\n\n\n\nWhat are three terms you\u2019d use to describe a softboi?\n\nAlternative. Superiority complex. Emotionally exploitative.\n\nYou can assign those qualities to a lot of people, but you\u2019re saying it\u2019s the alternativeness that gives the bois their soft edge?\n\nYeah, exactly. Softbois have alternative interests and come across like they\u2019re being very open about their emotions, which is a really good thing for men to do. But it then twists into \u201cand you should therefore sleep with me because of this\u201d.\n\nAnother common thing with softbois is that they turn quite emotionally messed up when they get rejected. For example: one guy [featured on the account] messaged a girl on Tinder saying \u201cdon\u2019t be sad life is wonderful\u201d, and when she didn\u2019t reply he wrote \u201clol you must be one of those emotionally distraught women who hasn\u2019t figured out their purpose yet\u201d.\n\n\n\nBut still, how do you tell the difference between a softboi and someone who is in touch with their feelings, and genuinely into \u201cnon-mainstream\u201d things?\n\nThe difference between the softboi and a decent guy who\u2019s in touch with his emotions \u2013 and may just have a passing interest in Lou Reed \u2013 is that the softboi would try to lord his nicheness over people. They have blind faith that the people they want to impress will fall at their feet simply because they\u2019re different, and if they don\u2019t he will likely throw his toys out of the pram.\n\nWhat\u2019s the best example of a softboi that you\u2019ve been sent?\n\nThis is the most softboi series of messages I have ever seen.\n\n\n\nHe says he\u2019s an outsider, which is straightaway a softboi move. But he doesn\u2019t enjoy Shrek because there are much better films. That\u2019s obvious, isn\u2019t it? And then \u201cplease tell me you\u2019ve watched Pulp Fiction\u201d is just the greatest sentence ever.\n\nIs there a female equivalent to a softboi?\n\nThere\u2019s definitely such a thing as a softgirl, and people always tell me to set up an account for them, but I\u2019m not sure it would be as funny. If someone sent me a really funny screenshot from a girl I\u2019d post it and say it\u2019s a girl. That\u2019s why I spelt it boi not boy, because it can be fluid. But also, a soft girl already sort of exists in the form of a manic pixie dream girl.\n\n\n\nHypothetically speaking, if I was now terrified that I\u2019m a softboi, how would I know? Is there a checklist I can look at to find out?\n\n\u2013 Do you have the name of a band in your dating app bio?\n\n\u2013 Have you had a pair of Vans or Dr Martens that you\u2019ve treated like children and tell everyone how you\u2019ve had them for years?\n\n\u2013 Do you exclusively shop at Urban Outfitters?\n\n\u2013 Do you find yourself ranting about how terrible your life is to someone you\u2019re trying to pursue and saying \u201cbut you can help me feel better\u201d?\n\n\u2013 Have you ever asked someone back to your flat under the premise of taking \u201cartistic\u201d photos with your 35mm?\n\n\u2013 Is your ideal woman a manic pixie dream girl?\n\n\u2013 Do you romanticise drug use? (\u201cCan we sniff lines and watch The Notebook?\u201d is a real message featured by the account)\n\nWhat\u2019s your advice to someone dating a softboi?\n\nThink: is it worth it? You know, if he keeps bringing up Thom Yorke while you\u2019re trying to have sex. There are plenty of boys who aren\u2019t softbois who you can go for but, that said, there are also plenty of softbois who are harmless and really great, so don\u2019t worry too much.", "description": "They have alternative interests and come across as very open with their emotions, but there\u2019s a dark side", "authors": ["Max Benwell"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23a21bb6e549df157554edd5b005ec7a87182741/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=22311488416bf0cba4993609720058ed", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
