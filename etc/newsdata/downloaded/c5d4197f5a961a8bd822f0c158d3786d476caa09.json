It was taken in the old Art College on Eleanor Street.\u201d\n\nHe said \u201cit all started off as a laugh\u201d and he didn't notice anything out of the ordinary until looking back at his photographs the next morning.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe took pictures with the lights on and lights off. We were just messing around and I was taking a load of pictures. I woke up the next morning and had a look at what I had taken.\n\n\u201cI was really taken back by what I saw. I have been into the paranormal since being a child. I\u2019m no longer scared of it. I thrive on it, to be honest.\n\n\u201cWhen zoomed in, you can see facial features of the first boy. He\u2019s sitting down, besides three or four others, crossed legged and with his right arm to his right knee.\n\n\u201cYou can see more on the boy standing up. His facial features are much clearer. These were taken somewhere near the old swimming pool.\u201d\n\nThe second photograph, taken by Tara, is said to show a \u201cfigure\u201d in \u201cfull spectrum\u201d again near the swimming pool area.\n\nGraham said: \u201cMy partner took this image, which is in full spectrum, in the same location. It was taken further away and is harder to make out.\u201d", "description": "Paranormal investigators ventured into the rotting Education Offices and Art College in Grimsby, and came away with two \u2018supernatural\u2019 shots", "authors": ["Paige Freshwater"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20572747.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_DJI_0010JPG1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
