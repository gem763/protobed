The list, released annually during the foundation\u2019s run-up to November\u2019s prestigious National Book Awards, recognizes \u201cfive fiction writers under the age of 35 whose debut work promises to leave a lasting impression on the literary landscape.\u201d Each honoree was selected by a writer previously honored by the foundation. (Which is to say these are highly praised authors offering high praise for authors who will be getting a lot more in the future.) \u201cOur 2019 5 Under 35 honorees are new authors of extraordinary promise, but their debut books are remarkable achievements for writers at any stage of their career,\u201d said David Steinberger, chairman of the National Book Foundation\u2019s board of directors.\n\nOn this year\u2019s list, which consists of three novels and two short-story collections, you\u2019ll find stories about Houston, Texas, and unconventional women pursuing happiness; stories about politics, LGBTQ issues, and addiction; a work of autofiction about life in the wake of a suicide; the imagined life of a young man in post-WWI Palestine and a fictionalized autobiography of a half-Swedish, half-American teacher working with refugees. Here are the honored up-and-comers:\n\nHonoree: Anelise Chen, So Many Olympic Exertions\n\nDescription: Part memoir, part sports writing, part self-help book, So Many Olympic Exertions tells the story of a graduate student, Athena Chen, who has recently learned a friend has died by suicide and the emotional journey that follows.\n\nChen on writing autofiction: \u201cI think I was suffering from what others have called novel nausea, or the sudden inability to read \u2018made up\u2019 stuff. I was drawn to two things at the time: watching sports and reading diaries. SMOE was the weird slurry that resulted from what I was consuming back then. A diary is this raw, unfiltered space, and you can be there in real time with a mind as it struggles to process something, some event that just occurred, some idea, some ungraspable emotion. That struggle really interests me. Then I started noticing that there was a natural pattern and flow to these diaries, how there were \u2018conventions\u2019 to the form as well. I\u2019m still interested in blending fact and fiction. I wrote something resembling a fake diary with SMOE, but my next book will probably be an autobiography written as a fairy tale.\u201d\n\nSelected by: Dana Spiotta, 2006 National Book Awards finalist for Fiction\n\nWho picked it because: \u201cAnelise Chen writes with gorgeous precision and brilliant wit. Her elliptical, subversive, and stylish novel builds moments of doubt and failure into something beautiful: a modern (but tender and true) rendering of our human condition.\u201d\n\nHonoree: Isabella Hammad, The Parisian\n\nDescription: Midhat Kamal leaves his Palestinian home in 1914 for France to study medicine during WWI. When he returns, he finds his native land, now under British command, and his life have been forever changed.\n\nHammad on her work\u2019s relevance in 2019: \u201cThe book depicts Palestine before 1948, following the lives of ordinary people living in Nablus under Ottoman and British rule, and the beginning of the Palestinian struggle for freedom. So it has a very specific resonance for the present day in the sense that this struggle is ongoing. But it\u2019s also a personal story about one particular man, and, I hope, speaks more broadly of the importance, for Palestinians as for everyone, of storytelling for survival \u2014 as individuals, in our communities \u2014 and the trouble we run into when the bits don\u2019t seem to fit together, or when we have no one to tell, or when no one seems to be listening.\u201d\n\nSelected by: Viet Thanh Nguyen, 2016 National Book Awards finalist for Nonfiction\n\nHonoree: Johannes Lichtman, Such Good Work\n\nDescription: Jonas Anderson is a 28-year-old teacher who moves to Sweden for both his work and his sobriety, launching a novel about addiction and the refugee crisis. The New Yorker describes Such Good Work as \u201cwary of affectation or grandstanding; it works small, as if from a sense of modesty, a reluctance to presume; it cuts sincerity with the driest of humor.\u201d\n\nLichtman on writing about addiction: \u201cI wanted it to be an all-consuming problem that the narrator had to deal with before he could be consumed by more interesting problems. It was an obstacle to be overcome, but it was never meant to be the focus of the book. Addiction itself is pretty boring. Jade Sharma, who sadly passed away earlier this year, starts out her novel Problems \u2014 one of the best portrayals of addiction I\u2019ve read \u2014 with the line, \u2018Somewhere along the way, there stopped being new days.\u2019 Which sums it up pretty well. Breaking out of addiction, and the things that can happen when it stops being the most important thing in a person\u2019s life, can be very un-boring.\u201d\n\nSelected by: Garth Greenwell, 2016 National Book Awards Longlist for Fiction\n\nWho picked it because: \u201cJonas, the protagonist, is young, smart, wounded, and desperate to do good, which is as perfect a recipe for disaster as I can think of. The book is better on what it means to engage meaningfully with the world than anything else I\u2019ve read in recent years: like the good liberal he is, Jonas sees through his own pretensions and is aware of all the ways in which any engagement he can imagine will be problematic. And then, instead of withering into cynicism or inaction, he does the very best he can. Such Good Work is one of the best \u2014 one of the most beautifully written, one of the most thoughtful \u2014 novels I\u2019ve read in the past several years.\u201d\n\nHonoree: Bryan Washington, Lot: Stories\n\nDescription: A collection of stories that, according to NPR, \u201cpaints an unforgettable picture of Houston and the people who call it home.\u201d\n\nWashington on writing when a city is a central character: \u201cI probably sound like a broken record at this point, but it\u2019d be impossible for any one person to offer a comprehensive look at Houston. We\u2019re the most diverse city in the States, so that\u2019s just not happening. Nor would I want it to. But what I think you can do \u2014 and what I\u2019m trying to do \u2014 is attempt to show very specific experiences of the city through the eyes of very particular folks; and the first step to that, I think, is making them human, and giving them humanity, with their respective hopes and dreams and losses and pleasures. Because that\u2019s what will determine their experience in this city, with all of its ceilings and all of its lows. And that\u2019s pretty fucking difficult enough, at least for me \u2014 but loads of fun, too.\u201d\n\nSelected by: Nafissa Thompson-Spires, 2018 National Book Awards Longlist for Fiction\n\nWho picked it because: \u201cThe stories devastated me \u2014 scalpel sharp, impeccably paced, and devastating, they announce, with ferocity, the writer\u2019s dual talents of incisive observation and deep empathy.\u201d\n\nHonoree: Ashley Wurzbacher, Happy Like This\n\nDescription: Ten stories exploring the lives of women, from dancers to plant physiologists, who are living their somewhat unconventional lives and looking for happiness. (Spoiler: They do not all find it.)\n\nWurzbacher on writing about women: \u201cI\u2019ve been as swept away by love for other women \u2014 maybe more so \u2014 as I have for any man. It\u2019s a love that\u2019s as intellectually intriguing to me as it is emotionally rewarding. There has always seemed to be something at the core of that love that\u2019s deeper and more mysterious than romantic love, and that \u2018something\u2019 is part of what I explore in the stories in Happy Like This. Many of my characters feel uncertain what they\u2019re \u2018supposed\u2019 to be doing with themselves and their lives, they feel burdened by the weight of their choices, and their uncertainty drives them toward other women who seem to have figured things out and found some form of happiness. They fall in a kind of love with each other. They try to understand and respect both other women\u2019s choices and their own, and sometimes they succeed and sometimes they fail in that effort. Perhaps what matters is that they bother to make the effort at all.\u201d\n\nSelected by: Brandon Hobson, 2018 National Book Awards finalist for Fiction\n\nWho picked it because: \u201cHappy Like This, is an intelligent and moving glimpse into the lives of women searching for happiness. Each story pulses with electric writing, often humorous, but always full of authenticity and compassion. I can\u2019t wait for people to read this book.\u201d", "description": "This year\u2019s National Book Foundation 5 under 35 honorees are Anelise Chen, Isabella Hammad, Johannes Lichtman, Bryan Washington, and Ashley Wurzbacher.", "authors": ["Madison Malone Kircher"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/20/books-five-under-35/20-books-five-under-thirtyfive-lede.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
