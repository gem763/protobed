Why Are They So Common?", "language": "en", "text": "Moreover, a blaring alarm might scare off a first-time joyrider, but they\u2019re a non-issue for most professional thieves, who can clip a few wires and silence an alarm with ease. Indeed, one 1997 analysis found that cars with alarms \u201cshow no overall reduction in theft losses.\u201d\n\nWorse, car alarms may be affecting the health of the people around them when they go off. A report from Transportation Alternatives, a bicycle-advocacy organization, estimated that New York\u2019s car alarms lead to about $400 to $500 million per year in \u201cpublic-health costs, lost productivity, decreased property value, and diminished quality of life.\u201d An estimate from an organization whose stated goal is \u201cto reclaim New York City's streets from the automobile\u201d should be taken with a grain of salt, but the point still stands that car-alarm sounds are stress-inducing and sleep-interrupting.\n\nSo if car alarms don\u2019t work, how did they become ubiquitous in the first place? While the first car alarm was developed about a century ago and more or less resembles the alarms still in use today, the technology didn\u2019t become truly widespread until the \u201860s and \u201870s, a time when, according to Phillips, neighbors might have been more likely to come to the aid of a besieged vehicle. Over time, though, people grew to ignore them, especially in the \u201880s and \u201890s, when urban crime rates increased and even more drivers started installing them. From around that time, there is even an account of a thief using a siren to cover up the sound of a car\u2019s windows getting shattered. Nowadays, the streets are still teeming with older cars whose loud, obnoxious anti-theft measures reflect the eras during which they were built.\n\nToday, very few cars roll out of factories equipped with car alarms. For example, a spokesperson for Toyota, currently the world\u2019s largest automaker, says that alarms are not standard in their cars. (Currently, the federal government doesn\u2019t require carmakers to take many anti-theft precautions, other than mandating that they differentiate the key combinations for different vehicles and mark various parts of their cars with vehicle identification numbers.)\n\nThat said, many drivers today still elect to purchase car alarms separately from aftermarket vendors, so they are not exactly dying off. Further, one of the car-security experts I spoke to told me that most alarms are purchased aftermarket, only to email me shortly afterward saying that he actually wasn\u2019t sure if they were being installed in factories\u2014demonstrating a confusion about alarms\u2019 provenance that does not bode well for ridding the world of them.\n\nAnother thing keeping them around is that they\u2019re cheap. At their cheapest they cost about $20 to $30, which is far less expensive than the more-sophisticated immobilization systems that are built into most cars today. Those can cost around $500, and make sure that the engine won\u2019t start unless a vehicle\u2019s key is inserted. (Digital chips are embedded into these keys, which is why many car keys are so expensive to replace.)", "description": "Car alarms don't deter criminals, and they're a public nuisance.
