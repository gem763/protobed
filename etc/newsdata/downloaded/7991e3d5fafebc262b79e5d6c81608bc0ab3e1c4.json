However, that will be sadly overshadowed as the incident promises to reverberate around the game.\n\nElectricity courses through ANZ Stadium as Roosters stand up to intense pressure | Matt Cleary Read more\n\nWith the scores level at 8-8 with eight minutes to go, Jack Wighton hoisted the ball in the air and it came down in a crowded pack of players. As it bounced backwards into the Raiders\u2019 grasp, Cummins waived his hands in the air, to signal a new set, and could be heard saying \u201csix again\u201d.\n\nHowever, when the call from his assistant referee Gerard Sutton that the ball had in fact deflected off a Raiders\u2019 player, he quickly changed his call. He could be heard saying \u201clast tackle\u201d on five occasions, however the Raiders were oblivious. Wighton, who believed that it was the zero tackle, was rounded up by the Roosters defence.\n\nFrom the ensuing set, the Roosters scored a brilliant team try with fullback James Tedesco sealing the game.\n\nNRL head of football Graham Annesley said that ultimately, the right decision was made because he ball had bounced off the Raiders, however he conceded that the Raiders attackers were left confused.\n\n\u201cDoes that initial decision affect the way Canberra play out that tackle, yeah I\u2019m sure it does? But if they had not and the Raiders had scored, I\u2019d probably be sitting here telling you that a try had been scored off an incorrect decision,\u201d Annesley said.\n\nAnnesley offered to speak to Ricky Stuart post-game but the Raiders coach declined the invitation. Despite being outspoken of his criticism of the referees throughout his career \u2013 and fined on 10 occasions for a total of $125,000 \u2013 Stuart he refused to comment on the issue. He said when he got on the field post-game, he made a beeline to the referees to congratulate them on their game.\n\n\u201cNo one goes out there to make a mistake,\u201d Stuart said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got tough jobs. It was a really good game of football tonight, we could\u2019ve won it, we didn\u2019t. And it\u2019s a very empty feeling losing a grand final.\u201d\n\nHowever the criticism of the decision was widespead \u2013 Wally Lewis described the call as \u201ccrazy\u201d while fellow Queensland great Johnathan Thurston said he was \u201cdumbfounded\u201d. Souths co-owner Russell Crowe took to twitter to describe it as a \u201chorseshit result\u201d.\n\nRoosters deny Raiders in NRL grand final to claim successive titles Read more\n\nBut Roosters coach Trent Robinson took issue when questioned on it, saying it was only being scrutinised because this side took advantage of the opportunity. He said the decision to sin-bin Cronk was just as controversial, however his side held their line for 10 minute.\n\nAnnesley said the six-again incident did not form a basis for the the reintroduction of a one-referee system.\n\n\u201cIf we had one referee tonight we would have got the decision wrong,\u201d Annesley said. \u201cBecause they would have awarded six again. The fact is that play and the contact from the kick did not warrant the awarding of six more tackles.\u201d\n\nAnnesley said he was also comfortable with Cronk\u2019s sin-binning. And he the said decision to give the Roosters a scrum feed after the ball hit the club\u2019s trainer Travis Touma, was the correct application of the rules.", "description": "Referee Ben Cummins\u2019 six-again blunder blighted the Sydney Roosters\u2019 14-8 win over Canberra in the season decider at ANZ Stadium", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3eea22b0a34f4bc3b68fdf9db5e1f7ea69e3a150/0_397_3964_2379/master/3964.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7d6d3352cc920af6d9ced224d7901ff7", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
