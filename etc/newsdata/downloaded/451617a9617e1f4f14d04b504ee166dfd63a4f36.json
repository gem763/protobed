To a large extent, President Trump kept his word. Trump is pictured October 12 in Washington DC\n\nThree days after Trump had announced the US would be pulling its small number of troops from northeast Syria, Erdogan did what he\u2019d threatened to do for several years and invaded Syria. Pictured: Turkish soldiers in tanks in Syria on October 14\n\nUS forces did indeed \u2018bomb the hell\u2019 out of ISIS, destroying its caliphate in Syria and Iraq, and neutering much of its very dangerous global threat in the process.\n\nIt would be a stretch to claim, as Trump has done, that ISIS is finished, because they\u2019re demonstrably not in places like Afghanistan.\n\nBut since the successful dismantling of the caliphate, there has been a massive reduction in major ISIS terror attacks around the world.\n\nPresident Trump is thus perfectly entitled to take credit for largely delivering on his promise.\n\nYet in one spectacularly ill-judged phone call, he\u2019s now unleashed a horrendous can of worms that seems likely to undo all of that deserved kudos.\n\nNobody knows exactly what was said when Trump spoke to President Erdogan of Turkey last Sunday, but we\u2019re all now seeing the gruesome consequences of that conversation.\n\nThree days later, after Trump had announced the US would be pulling its small number of troops from northeast Syria, Erdogan did what he\u2019d threatened to do for several years and invaded Syria.\n\nHe said he was launching Operation Peace Spring to \u2018neutralize terror threats\u2019 and \u2018establish a safe zone\u2019.\n\nIn reality, Turkish forces promptly attacked Kurdish forces \u2013 a historic foe - with savage brutality.\n\nThese are the same Kurdish forces who heroically helped the US defeat ISIS in the first place, and who\u2019ve since been guarding thousands of captured Islamic State fighters.\n\nAnd amid the chaos, hundreds of these fighters are now reported to have escaped.\n\nNobody knows exactly what was said when Trump spoke to President Erdogan of Turkey (pictured October 14) last Sunday, but we\u2019re all now seeing the gruesome consequences of that conversation\n\nSo ISIS is back on the loose in Syria, free to re-group, re-arm, and re-launch its terrorism.\n\nIt gets worse.\n\nAs Turkey has rampaged through Kurdish territory, its forces have also killed many civilians and displaced over 130,000 from their homes, in what many horrified observers are describing as \u2018ethnic cleansing\u2019.\n\nSome of the TV news interviews with devastated Kurdish women and their wounded or dead children are absolutely heart-breaking.\n\nLet\u2019s be blunt: America has betrayed the Kurds in horrifying, despicable fashion.\n\nAs the carnage unfurled - carnage that many experts predicted would happen \u2013 Trump warned Turkey its assault was a \u2018bad idea\u2019 and threatened on Twitter to destroy Turkey\u2019s economy if it continued to wipe out the Kurds.\n\n\u2018If Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits,\u2019 said Trump, with unedifying arrogance given the gravity of the situation, \u2018I will totally destroy and obliterate the economy of Turkey!\n\nBut Erdogan, having brazenly called Trump\u2019s bluff, has shown no sign of being remotely deterred by such warnings, ruling out any mediation with the Kurds saying Turkey wouldn\u2019t negotiate with \u2018terrorists\u2019.\n\nAs a result, the appalled and terrified Kurds are now fleeing into the gleeful arms of Syrian dictator Bashar Al-Assad, the man America wants ousted, and the man who is supported by two major U.S. rivals, Iran and Russia.\n\nThe Syrian government has offered to support the Kurds against Turkey\u2019s invasion, a shift in alliances that could help Assad achieve total victory in the long-running Syrian conflict, and by association, achieve a victory too for Iran and Russia.\n\nWhat an absolute shambles!\n\nThere can be few things more sickening than such cold-hearted betrayal of men and women who\u2019ve risked their lives, and in many Kurd cases GIVEN their lives, to fight with another nation in battle.\n\nThe Kurds did that for America, to defeat ISIS and to make the world a safer place.\n\nErdogan said he was launching Operation Peace Spring to \u2018neutralize terror threats\u2019 and \u2018establish a safe zone\u2019. In reality, Turkish forces promptly attacked Kurdish forces \u2013 a historic foe - with savage brutality. Pictured: Turkish troops and Turkish-backed Syrian rebels gather outside the border town of Ras al-Ain, Syria, on October 12\n\nFor President Trump to now throw those same Kurds to the Turkish wolves is an unforgivable act of treachery that may have very serious ramifications for the security of the United States.\n\nThe Kurds are under no illusion what\u2019s happened to them.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that a Kurdish commander who had spearheaded the fight against ISIS stormed out of a meeting with Americans shouting: \u2018You sold us!\u2019\n\nTop U.S. military personnel feel the same way.\n\n\u2018There is blood on Trump\u2019s hands for abandoning our Kurdish allies,\u2019 retired four-star Marine general John Allen told CNN.\n\nYes there is.\n\nThe only question now is how much blood, and what if anything America can do to stop it now the near-genocidal genie is out of the bottle?\n\nSending U.S. troops back into the area seems pointless.\n\n\u2018I can\u2019t see why you would leave U.S. forces there now,\u2019 a senior military source told Fox News. \u2018How would you get other partners? What would give them a reason to trust us?\u2019\n\nWell, exactly.\n\nAs even Trump loyalist Senator Lindsay Graham put it before the invasion began: \u2018If we abandon them (the Kurds) good luck getting anybody to help America in the future with Al Qaeda and ISIS. You may be tired of fighting radical Islam, but they\u2019re not tired of fighting you.\u2019\n\nGeneral Allen added: \u2018This is what happens when Trump follows his instincts and because of his alignment of autocrats.\u2019\n\nSadly, this withering assessment is hard to argue.\n\nTrump has regularly played footloose and fancy-free in his dealings with despotic foreign leaders.\n\nBut by letting himself get played by President Erdogan in this way, he has exposed America to the very worst kind of accusation: that it will ditch its allies when it suits them.\n\nTrump, of course, doesn\u2019t accept he\u2019s done anything wrong.\n\nThere can be few things more sickening than such cold-hearted betrayal of men and women who\u2019ve risked their lives, and in many Kurd cases GIVEN their lives, to fight with another nation in battle. Pictured: Syrian Arab and Kurdish civilians flee October 10 after Turkish bombardment on Syria's northeastern town\n\n\u2018Very smart not to be involved in the intense fighting along the Turkish border, for a change,\u2019 he tweeted. \u2018Those that mistakenly got us into the Middle East Wars are still pushing to fight. They have no idea what a bad decision they have made.\u2019\n\nHmmm. I think the President needs to look closer to home when it comes to bad decisions.\n\nI applaud Trump\u2019s desire not to wage further war in the Middle East.\n\nBut I don\u2019t applaud him for what he\u2019s done to the Kurds.\n\nIt\u2019s not \u2018great and unmatched wisdom\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019s dumb, dangerous and disloyal.\n\nThe U.S. military has always operated under a sacred rule: \u2018No man left behind.\u2019\n\nIt is imbedded into the psyche of everyone in the American forces.\n\nThe U.S. Army Rangers creed states: \u2018I will never leave a fallen comrade to fall into the hands of the enemy.\u2019\n\nWhichever way Trump tries to spin this, the truth is that America just left its Kurdish comrades to fall into the hands of the enemy.\n\nAnd that is a bloody disgrace.", "description": "For President Trump to now throw the Kurds to the Turkish wolves is an unforgivable act of treachery that may have very serious ramifications for the security of the United States.", "authors": ["Piers Morgan For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/13/19692468-0-image-a-15_1571056924210.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
