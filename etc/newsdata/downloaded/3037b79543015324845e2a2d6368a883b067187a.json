The account has videos of anti-vaccine protests that took place Friday at the Capitol.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nCalifornia Highway Patrol officers cleared the floor and investigated the incident, which occurred around 5:15 p.m., surrounding the area with crime scene tape. A hazardous materials team was en route as senators voiced concerns that it was human blood.\n\nFriday marks the final night of session as lawmakers face a deadline to send legislation to Gov. Gavin Newsom. The Assembly resumed session shortly after 7:30 p.m., but the Senate remains in a holding pattern.\n\nLawmakers believe the activist was part of the anti-vaccine protests that have continued throughout the week after Newsom signed legislation Monday cracking down on medical vaccine exemptions. Anti-vaccine protesters have been a mainstay in the legislative galleries, holding U.S. flags upside down.\n\nNewsom spokesman Nathan Click said the governor's office condemns the act and called it \"despicable.\"\n\nThe liquid appeared to hit at least two legislators, including Sen. Melissa Hurtado (D-Sanger) and Sen. Nancy Skinner (D-Berkeley). A splotch was also visible on Sen. Holly Mitchell's (D-Los Angeles) desk.\n\nSen. Steve Glazer (D-Orinda) tweeted a picture of what appeared to be a menstrual cup with red liquid inside. He said that Hurtado, Skinner, Mitchell, Sen. Cathleen Galgiani (D-Stockton) and Sen. Susan Rubio (D-Baldwin Park) were hit by the liquid.\n\n\"I'm told a person has been arrested,\" Glazer said on Twitter.\n\nSenate President Pro Tem Toni Atkins immediately called for a Democratic caucus.\n\n\"California\u2019s legislative process, as well as our doors, should remain open to all who wish to observe or speak out on a variety of issues, but we cannot allow anyone to endanger others,\" she said in a statement. \"The behavior that occurred in the Senate Chamber is unacceptable and has been dealt with by Capitol law enforcement. We will continue to do the people\u2019s important business.\u201d\n\nSenate Republican Leader Shannon Grove said her caucus condemns \"the violent and unacceptable behavior that took place at the State Capitol this evening. Regardless of differences of opinions, there is no place for this in our America.\"\n\nState Sen. Richard Pan (D-Sacramento), author of the main medical exemption bill, CA SB276 (19R), criticized the anti-vaccine movement. The incident came three weeks after he was shoved by an anti-vaccination protester, Kenneth Austin Bennett, near the Capitol. Bennett was arrested on an assault charge.\n\n\"Like Mr. Bennett, this incident was incited by the violent rhetoric perpetuated by leaders of the antivaxx movement. As their rhetoric escalates, their incidents of violence does as well. This is an attack on the democratic process and it must be met with strong condemnation by everyone,\" Pan said in a statement.\n\nA Voice for Choice Advocacy, which hired lobbyists this year to oppose Pan's legislation, said in a statement on Twitter that it \"does not now & never will support, encourage or condone this repulsive behavior. Civil discourse is the basis of a democracy and this behavior is repugnant, harms our democratic process & the protesters own cause.\"\n\nAnti-vaccination protesters gathered outside the Capitol tonight, with a group of activists carrying small boxes depicting small caskets.\n\n\"Do not kill our babies,\" and \"enough is enough\" they chanted as they marched the small boxes around the Capitol. Some lawmakers observed the protest from a balcony as session remained on hold.\n\nAsked earlier in the day what they hoped to accomplish, protesters said they want Newsom and lawmakers to heed their request to undo the legislation signed into law Monday. Three activists filed paperwork this week for a referendum on the two bills Newsom signed.\n\nMackenzie Mays contributed to this report.", "description": "California Highway Patrol officers cleared the floor and investigated the incident, surrounding the area with crime scene tape.", "authors": ["Angela Hart"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/91/1e/390f4ed24971b30cd6260961e3a3/image-2018-12-11-6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
