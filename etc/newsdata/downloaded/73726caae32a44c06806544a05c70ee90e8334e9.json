The star: a pine cone, to which someone has attached googly eyes, Popsicle-stick arms and a string. An unseen force tugs on the line, and the pine cone (his name is Willy) ascends spiraling heavenward, to the gushing chorus of Josh Groban\u2019s \u201cYou Raise Me Up.\u201d\n\nThe video is 11 seconds of perfect idiocy. I have laughed every time I watched it; I am laughing as I type this out. It\u2019s absurd and low-tech and parodic but also \u2014 can an inanimate seed cluster be joyful? Well, this one is. The clip is like the climax to an inspirational movie no one will ever make.\n\nThis, I discovered after recently downloading TikTok for the first time, is the beauty of the platform. Like Vine before it, it\u2019s all climaxes. It\u2019s all punch lines and dance outbursts and dramatic (or comedic) reveals.\n\nAs a professional TV watcher in 2019, I\u2019m immersed in maximalist video \u2014 Netflix binges, \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d Yet what we often take away from these giant entertainments are the moments: the \u201cNeverending Story\u201d singalong in \u201cStranger Things,\u201d Arya Stark leaping out of the dark at the Night King.\n\nTikTok gives you nothing but the singalongs and leaps. It is not a 21-course meal. It\u2019s a bottomless gumball machine, serving up ephemeral treats. Flick \u2014 hamster eating a tiny pancake! Flick \u2014 guy vacuum-sealing himself into a garbage bag!\n\nThis is not \u201cTV\u201d as recognizable to anyone who grew up when televisions were furniture. It\u2019s what TV becomes when it\u2019s something you pull out of your pocket, standing on a cashier line, sitting on a bus.\n\nSo fittingly, it belongs creatively to people who were holding a screen since they could make a fist. Videos are set in teenage bedrooms, classrooms, suburban living rooms. A girl dances to audio of her mom arguing with her boyfriend (#someonegetmymomagoodman), an unsettling slice of dark irony. A group of friends creates an \u201cAvengers assemble\u201d tableau by jumping backward into a swimming pool, then reversing the video. A dancer busts an intricate set of moves to a Drake song in front of a kitchen island, while an older man \u2014 her dad? \u2014 wanders into the frame in the background, unnoticed.\n\nIt\u2019s easy for An Old on TikTok \u2014 certainly this middle-aged viewer, maybe anyone north of 20 \u2014 to feel like the wandering dad in the hallway, an interloper in an impenetrable hangout of references, Billie Eilish memes and comedy bits about homework, driver\u2019s ed and #dormlife.\n\nBut the more time I spent with the app, the more I realized that any feeling of exclusion I had was my own baggage. The pervasive feeling I got from TikTok was inclusion. It wasn\u2019t, like Instagram, trying to persuade me of its users\u2019 happiness, or, like Twitter, of their rightness. Instead the vibe is: Look at this cool thing I did. What can you do?\n\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve developed a new habit; my streaming and TiVo backlogs have too great a hold on me. But the beauty of this new relationship is how little commitment it demands. TikTok is there, whenever I want to be raised up, for 11 seconds at a time.", "description": "The video app offers an endless scroll of creativity and goofing off, told in 15-second snippets. What did five critics see when they went down the rabbit hole? Art, artistry and a lot of dancing.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/13/arts/13TIK-TOK-cover-new-10/13TIK-TOK-cover-new-10-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
