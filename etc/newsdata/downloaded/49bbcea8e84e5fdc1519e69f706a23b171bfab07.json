And after some persuasion from his fellow prisoner Abe, David will arm himself with scissors and confront the man who almost destroyed his life forever.\n\nWith violence all around during the riot and the red mist descending, will David make a mistake that could cost him his entire future with his family?\n\nTeasing the episodes, Jack P Shepherd said: \u2018They say Josh needs teaching a lesson and in a riot you can get away with anything, there\u2019ll be no witnesses and they\u2019ll bring Josh to him. David finds himself swept up in their plan, the thought is certainly there and when he\u2019s presented with the scissors I think he\u2019s capable of anything.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRyan Clayton added: \u2018Josh\u2019s safety is at risk and he can\u2019t play the cards he used to play anymore. But he knows he still can use control over David and he does. He is full of bravado but the second he is alone with David you really see how scared and panicked he is.\u2019\n\nHe won\u2019t win much sympathy from viewers but one thing no-one wants is David serving a life sentence due to taking revenge on Josh \u2013 can David stop himself from striking? As reports have already indicated that Josh will be stabbed, it is not looking good for David \u2013 and Shona is left fearing he won\u2019t be home for their wedding day.\n\nIs it all over?\n\nJosh\u2019s return scenes kick off on Friday 18 October while the riot airs from Monday 21 October.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "David seeks revenge in Corrie.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/david-and-josh-riot-47ad_1570907900.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
