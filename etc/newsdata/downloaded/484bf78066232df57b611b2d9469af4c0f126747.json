That's the only way to live life.\" She has no regard for consequences or the position she puts others in. She was unstable when I was a kid because of this. We were often homeless or crashing with her friends.\n\nNow that I'm in my 30s, it bothers me in new ways. She spends ALL her money and then doesn't have enough for medication, food, living. I'm afraid she's going to have to live with me. She has a medical condition, but eats exactly what she shouldn't eat and then ends up in the emergency room. I have to go take care of it. I can't just keep taking off work!\n\nI have no sympathy anymore. I know that sounds harsh, but 90 percent of her plights are of her own doing. Yet she has no one else.\n\nI've cut down what I do for her to the minimum, to make sure her needs are met. But I'm still so resentful she does this to me! She thinks she's just living her life while I think we should all try our hardest not be burdens on others.\n\n\n\n(Nick Galifianakis/for The Washington Post)\n\n\u2014 Resentful\n\nResentful: Oh my.\n\nDeciding \u201cI\u2019m going to do what I want\u201d when it exposes one\u2019s children to homelessness is not a philosophy; it\u2019s neglect and/or abuse.\n\nAnd feeling responsible for your mother when she was/is so careless with you? That, again, isn\u2019t about philosophy or workday logistics. That\u2019s the enduring emotional legacy of her neglect.\n\nPlease stop carrying this all by yourself. Get help from a good therapist trained to navigate complex family systems.\n\nAsk yourself, too: What would she have to do if you lived overseas/had your own crisis/hadn\u2019t been born? The fallacy of indispensability snares a lot of us, not just the ones with tough parental legacies like yours.\n\nSee it for what it is and release it.\n\nI\u2019m not saying to cut Mom off \u2014 though you may decide to eventually, after weighing your options \u2014 but instead to see that anything you feel forced to do is fertile soil for resentment.\n\nYou do have choices, your mom isn\u2019t forcing you, and no one is a burden whom you don\u2019t allow to be so.\n\nShe\u2019s presenting you with unappealing choices, yes \u2014 but they\u2019re still choices. Please start making them from a position of action vs. reaction, with or without the professional help.\n\nTo: Resentful: Please do try to get some actual physical distance from her so she can't guilt trip you into behaving as she wants.\n\nMy father was like this, so I moved out at 17 and never lived within 1,000 miles of him after that. It really helps. I can still do some things from afar, but I'm not on the same emotional cycle as my sibling.\n\nAnd the more we've cut him off, the more he's figured things out on his own.\n\nThe consequences of his self-sabotage are not my fault, and, quite frankly, I could never save him from himself. Save yourself. Boundaries are really a matter of survival.\n\n\u2014 Anonymous\n\nAnonymous: Bravely done.
