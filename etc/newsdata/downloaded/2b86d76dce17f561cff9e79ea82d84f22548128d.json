REUTERS/Toru Hanai/Files\n\nThe flag, a centuries-old symbol that was also used by Japan\u2019s military during World War Two, is the latest diplomatic football in a worsening feud between South Korea and Japan over the bitter legacy of their shared past.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s Sports Ministry this week asked the International Olympics Committee to prohibit any use of the flag, which it likened to the Nazi\u2019s use of the swastika.\n\nTokyo 2020 does not anticipate banning the \u201cRising Sun\u201d flag, spokesman Masa Takaya told Reuters.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018Rising Sun\u2019 flag is widely used in Japan and we think the display of the flag is not a political statement,\u201d the Tokyo 2020 organisers said in a statement, echoing the committee\u2019s previous stance.\n\nThe statement added that, as had been done at past Games, it was considering designating non-participating countries\u2019 flags as among items that cannot be brought into venues. Takaya said this was a general statement, not a reference to the \u201cRising Sun\u201d flag.\n\nTies between Washington\u2019s two Asian allies have deteriorated to their worst level in decades after South Korea\u2019s Supreme Court last October ordered some Japanese firms to compensate Koreans forced to work in their wartime mines and factories. Japan says the matter was settled by a 1965 treaty.\n\nThe feud has since jolted trade and security ties.\n\nMany Koreans resent the \u201cRising Sun\u201d flag as a symbol of Japan\u2019s 1910-1945 colonisation of the peninsula, but its use has become more controversial as relations with Japan chilled.\n\nLONG, COMPLEX HISTORY\n\nThe \u201cRising Sun\u201d flag - a sunburst with 16 rays - is separate from Japan\u2019s \u201cHinomaru\u201d flag that was legally made the national flag in 1999. Domestic critics at the time opposed the move because of its association with wartime militarism.\n\nJapan\u2019s Olympic team uses the \u201cHinomaru\u201d flag, a red disc on a white background.\n\nThe \u201cRising Sun\u201d flag, flown by Japanese feudal warlords, was adopted in 1870 as the flag of the Japanese Imperial Army. In 1889 it became the navy ensign.\n\nIt was then adopted as the ensign of the Maritime Self-Defence Force, as Japan\u2019s navy is known, when the MSDF was established as part of Japan\u2019s Self-Defense Forces in 1954.\n\nLast year, Japan called off its plan to take part in an international fleet review in South Korea after Seoul asked it not to fly the flag on warships - although it had done so without objections in fleet reviews in 1998 and 2008.\n\nChina, which also shares a bitter wartime history with Japan, did not complain when a Japanese naval vessel flew the \u201cRising Sun\u201d ensign during an April visit to a Chinese port.\n\nFootball\u2019s governing body FIFA, however, has banned its use and in 2017 the Asian Football Confederation sanctioned Japan after Japanese fans flew the flag at an AFC Champions League.\n\nThe \u201cRising Sun\u201d flag is a favourite of Japan\u2019s ultra-right, but it is also used on commercial products and is a corporate logo of the liberal Asahi newspaper.\n\nSome experts said comparisons to the Nazi swastika were overdone. \u201cThe swastika is indelibly linked to the Gestapo, the Holocaust and the horrors of Nazism,\u201d said Jeff Kingston, director of Asian studies at Tokyo\u2019s Temple University campus.\n\n\u201cThe Japanese view this as a flag with a long tradition extending well beyond Japanese colonialism,\u201d he said. \u201cFor Korea, it symbolises unresolved grievances of the colonial era.\u201d", "description": "Tokyo Olympic organisers said on Friday that the display of Japan's \"Rising Sun\" does not constitute a political statement and a spokesman said there were no plans to ban the controversial banner, as demanded by South Korea.", "authors": ["Linda Sieg", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429394011&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C0R8", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
