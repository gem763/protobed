It can reorient its military, prioritizing deterrence and defense over power projection. It can stop the obscenity that America sends more weapons into the world than does any other country. It can reserve armed intervention, and warlike sanctions, for purposes that are essential, legal and rare.\n\nShrinking the military\u2019s footprint will deprive presidents of the temptation to answer every problem with a violent solution. It will enable genuine engagement in the world, making diplomacy more effective, not less. As the United States stops being a party to every conflict, it can start being a party to resolving conflicts. President Obama\u2019s nuclear agreement with Iran and, to a lesser extent , President Trump\u2019s opening with North Korea suggest that historical enmities can be overcome. Still, these steps have not gone far enough to normalize relations and allow us to get on with living together in a world whose chief dangers \u2014 climate change, disease, deprivation \u2014 cross borders and require cooperation.\n\nHawks will retort that lowering America\u2019s military profile will plunge the world into a hostile power\u2019s arms. They are projecting, assuming that one rival will covet and attain the kind of armed domination that has served America poorly. Russia, with an economy the size of Italy\u2019s, cannot rule Europe, whatever it desires. China bears watching but has so far focused its military on denying access to its coasts and mainland. It is a long way from undertaking a costly bid for primacy in East Asia, let alone the world.\n\nIn any case, local states are likely to step up if the American military pulls back. The world conjured by the Washington establishment is an empty space, a \u201cpower vacuum,\u201d waiting passively to be led. The real world is full of people ready to safeguard their freedom. Today a world with less American militarism is likely to have less militarism in general.\n\nHawks also warn that restraint will produce chaos, dooming the \u201crules-based,\u201d \u201cliberal international order.\u201d Ambassador James F. Jeffrey, President Trump\u2019s envoy for Syria , recently told a version of this tale when he pounded the table in anger at Americans\u2019 objections to \u201cendless war.\u201d \u201cLiterally scores and scores of American military operations,\u201d he said, \u201cundergird this global security regime and thus undergird the American and Western and U.N. values system.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s a reason no one can connect the dots from unceasing interventions to a system of law and order. After decades of unilateral actions, crowned by the aggressive invasion of Iraq, it is U.S. military power that threatens international law and order. Rules should strengthen through cooperation, not wither through imposition.\n\nIn truth, the largest obstacle to ending endless war is self-imposed. Long told that the United States is the world\u2019s \u201cindispensable nation,\u201d the American people have been denied a choice and have almost stopped demanding one. A global superpower \u2014 waging endless war \u2014 is just \u201cwho we are.\u201d", "description": "First, America has to give up its pursuit of global dominance.", "authors": ["Stephen Wertheim"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/15/opinion/sunday/15wertheim/15wertheim-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
