I mean, he did serve well, credit to him, but just wasn\u2019t pleased with the way I played.\u201d\n\nAsked if the seventh-ranked Tsitsipas has the potential to be number one, Djokovic replied: \u201cHe definitely has, yes.\u201d\n\nAfter a dreadful start, Tsitsipas found his feet in the second set, winning on a tie break, then went 3-1 up in the decider when Djokovic planted his forehand wide on the third break point.\n\nIt was a double celebration for the young Greek, who has also confirmed his place in the prestigious season-ending ATP Finals.\n\nHe did so after fourth-ranked Medvedev tamed self-styled \u201cwild horse\u201d Fabio Fognini 6-3, 7-6 (7/4) to canter into the semi-finals. Fognini was vying for a place at the Finals.\n\nDjokovic said that he is fully recovered from a shoulder injury.\n\nHe did not drop a set in winning the title in Tokyo and had carried that ominous form into Shanghai \u2014 until he came across Tsitsipas.\n\nMedvedev \u2014 another of the next generation \u2014 sent down 12 aces to help see off Fognini and said: \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened, my serve was crushing it.\u201d\n\nThe Russian has a 12-0 record in quarter-finals this year and Djokovic this week described him as \u201cvery complete\u201d player.\n\nFederer, the 20-time Grand Slam champion, faces young German Alexander Zverev later Friday in his quarter-final.\n\nThe other match is between Austria\u2019s Dominic Thiem, who beat Tsitsipas to the China Open title on Sunday, and Italy\u2019s Matteo Berrettini.\n\nUS Open champion Nadal is not in Shanghai because of a wrist injury.", "description": "Shanghai (AFP) \u2013 World number one Novak Djokovic was stunned in the Shanghai Masters quarter-finals by young Greek Stefanos Tsitsipas in three sets", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/11/a217f5_seventh-ranked-tsitsipas-recovered-losing-opening-games-in-minutes-shock-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
