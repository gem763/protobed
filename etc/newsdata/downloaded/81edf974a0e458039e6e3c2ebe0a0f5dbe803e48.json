It\u2019s an excellent asset in the sense that we can control it a lot better,\u201d Oil Search Managing Director Peter Botten told Reuters in an interview.\n\nPNG JEWELS\n\nOil Search has parlayed its years in Papua New Guinea into a 29% stake in the PNG LNG project, led by Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), and a 23% stake in the Papua LNG project, led by Total SA (TOTF.PA), and has been a key player behind a plan to unite the two projects and double the country\u2019s LNG exports.\n\nThe projects are considered among the best in the world, blessed with low costs, high quality gas, existing infrastructure and proximity to Asia markets, factors that have long made Oil Search subject to takeover speculation.\n\nTo begin production at the planned expansion by 2024, Oil Search\u2019s partners need to give the go-ahead next year on the two projects.\n\nOne hurdle was resolved last week when the state backed down from a bid to overhaul terms with Total, but talks with Exxon to develop the P\u2019nyang gas field, which the companies had hoped to seal by June, are yet to happen.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d think they\u2019re likely to get there quicker on Alaska than they do on PNG at this stage,\u201d said Andy Forster, a portfolio manager at Argo Investments (ARG.AX), which more than doubled its holding in Oil Search in the year to June 2019.\n\nALASKA PIVOT\n\nIn Alaska, Oil Search has spent $850 million buying a 51% stake in the Pikka prospect on the assumption it holds 500 million barrels of recoverable oil.\n\nWith Spain\u2019s Repsol (REP.MC), it aims to produce 30,000 barrels a day of oil by as early as 2022 to start generating cash, then ramp up to 120,000 bpd in 2024.\n\nBeefing up its small staff in Alaska, the company has hired a Trump administration official who oversaw oil and gas drilling on U.S. federal lands as its external affairs head.\n\nIt is hoping to prove up reserves closer to 750 million barrels over the next six months, find more oil around its Nanushuk field and sell part of its stake to help fund the project.\n\n\u201cI think the development schedule we\u2019re working up right now is one that\u2019s very doable,\u201d Botten said.\n\nConsultants Wood Mackenzie like the project but are more skeptical about the timing because drilling in Alaska is restricted to the winter months, and delays of a month or two can set work back by a whole year.\n\n\u201cAlaska as a region is quite prone to delays,\u201d said Wood Mackenzie analyst Rowena Gunn. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very high cost, it\u2019s a remote, tough environment to work in, and there\u2019s a lot of environmental regulations.\u201d\n\nStill, the breakeven costs on the project were competitive with other big oil projects, given it is onshore and close to existing infrastructure.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really big, and it\u2019s oil,\u201d said Calgary-based Gunn, adding there was potential to tie discoveries into existing infrastructure.\n\nTAKEOVER TARGET?\n\nOil Search company spurned an $8 billion approach from Australia\u2019s Woodside Petroleum Ltd (WPL.AX) four years ago, but its shares have since fallen due to a glut of LNG and uncertainty in PNG, making it potentially vulnerable.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\n\u201cIn the global sector they\u2019re a small company but have material interests in global scale assets. That will always leave them having corporate appeal,\u201d said Adrian Prendergast, an analyst at stockbroker Morgans, noting the PNG assets.\n\nA banker suggested the Alaskan assets are an unlikely fit and may be sold by any potential suitor, but Botten disagreed.\n\n\u201cIt only makes the company much stronger,\u201d he said. \u201cI absolutely don\u2019t see it as a poison pill.\u201d", "description": "With a giant gas project expansion in the tropical highlands of remote Papua New Guinea bogged down by politics, the country's biggest company, Oil Search , is turning for growth to the other side of the world in Alaska's frozen wilderness.", "authors": ["Sonali Paul", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1427767785&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8800U", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
