It would be a great system, so long as only the Phillies could use it.\n\nI thought of that idea on the night of November 8, 2016, when Hillary Clinton won the popular tally by 2.86 million votes but lost the Electoral College, 306 to 232 (putting aside the 7 faithless electors who cast their support to someone else, which would presumably never stand if it swayed the outcome).\n\nThe 2016 election hinged on three states: Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. They were worth 46 electoral votes, and went to President Trump by a combined 77,744 ballots. These three states are so often mentioned in the same sentence as one monolithic bloc of disappointment for Democrats that we really ought to start calling them \u201cPennsylconsigan.\u201d\n\nIf both candidates had been allowed to deposit their surplus votes from runaway states into a \u201cvote bank\u201d to draw from in close states, the election would have gone to Clinton by a healthy number of electors. Her combined surplus margin of victory in the 21 states she won (including D.C.) was 11,226,150, compared to Trump\u2019s 8,357,682 in the 30 states he won, giving her plenty of capital to both shore up the Rust Belt and defend narrow victories in states like Minnesota and New Hampshire.\n\nHere\u2019s the secret: There actually is a vote bank. It\u2019s just a special kind of bank that never tells you your balance and has a strange, laborious way of reallocating funds. It\u2019s called campaigning. And if the eventual 2020 Democratic nominee invests wisely, it very well could decide the outcome.\n\nThe biggest challenge facing Trump\u2019s eventual opponent is not popular support. It\u2019s a distribution problem. A large percentage of reliably liberal voters live in a small number of states like California and New York. As I noted last week, the 2.4% of eligible voters who move every year further complicates the problem, since some states export more desirable demographics for either party than they import. While both campaigns are expected to wage aggressive registration and turnout efforts, nothing short of mass state-to-state migration will change this fact. (Reporter Alec MacGillis told \u201cyoung hipsters\u201d to move west in October 2016, if more for the sake of Congress, noting that the \u201chyper-concentration of Democratic votes has long hurt the party in the House and state legislatures.\u201d)\n\nFor the Democratic candidates, the best way around this challenge is to play the \u201cvote bank\u201d strategy, focusing all of his or her energy on ginning up support in the fewest places where electoral return on investment is the highest, at the cost of reallocating \u201cfunds\u201d \u2014 time spent campaigning and advertising \u2014 from places that need them less.\n\nOn the face of it, this doesn\u2019t sound much different from setting up shop in swing states, the way all candidates do. But this plan involves finer tuning. The smart campaign will make its best guess as to the handful of states where the smallest growth in support will generate the largest boon in the Electoral College, spend as little time and money as possible everywhere else, and hope for the best.\n\nIt\u2019s a gamble, yes \u2014 akin to an investor making a small number of high-risk bets on a few companies rather than diversifying their portfolio through interest funds and the like. But the current electoral map is sufficiently baked against the Democrats that it could be their only path to victory.\n\nFor example: If Democrats were to cede \u201cPennsylconsigan\u201d (which could easily flip back on its own) and put all their chips on Texas (which, depending on who you believe, could in fact go blue), that single victory would provide precisely the 38 electoral votes that Hillary Clinton needed to get to 270 and become President.\n\nSound reckless? Consider this, with the benefit of hindsight: The 2000 election will always be remembered for the 537 votes that divided Al Gore and George W. Bush in Florida, which were worth 25 electoral votes at the time. The final score was 271 to 267 after Bush v. Gore came down. (There was one faithless elector, so sometimes Gore\u2019s tally is listed as 266.) Gore also lost New Hampshire, which went to Bill Clinton twice, by a mere 7,211 votes. Had he ceded Florida to Bush ahead of time and redirected his substantial Florida campaign to the Granite State, those four electoral votes would have made the difference \u2014 and saved us a lot of bellyaching over American democracy.", "description": "Democratic voters live in clusters \u2014 but there's a way to take advantage of that", "authors": ["Chris Wilson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5tiHWfsbRgrWJZq3m1ovWw--~B/aD0xNjAxO3c9MjQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/f5288d46060f50c9c61bef1061b041a2", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
