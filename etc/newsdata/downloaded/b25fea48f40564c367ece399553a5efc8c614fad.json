Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., announced Tuesday she is endorsing former Vice President Joe Biden in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary -- choosing her former longtime Senate colleague over Kamala Harris, her fellow California Democratic senator.\n\nFeinstein\u2019s endorsement, the first major Democratic endorsement by a top legislator this campaign season, comes as Biden has been losing ground in the polls in the wake of the impeachment inquiry into President Trump and a series of high-profile gaffes while on the stump. But the longtime California senator praised the former vice president for his long tenure in Washington and his work on gun control.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked closely with Vice President Biden and I\u2019ve seen firsthand his legislative ability, his statesmanship, and most importantly his moral fortitude,\u201d Feinstein said in a statement. \u201cDuring his time in Congress and in the White House, Joe Biden has been a tireless fighter for hard-working American families.\u201d\n\nSTAGE IS SET FOR RECORD-BREAKING DEMOCRATIC 2020 DEBATE\n\nShe added: \u201cBy making gun reform one of the pillars of his campaign and policy platform, Joe Biden demonstrates that he clearly recognizes what is needed to keep Americans safe. And I know, as president, he will continue the fight to restore the soul of the nation from the Oval Office.\u201d\n\nFeinstein\u2019s endorsement of Biden may seem like a snub to Harris \u2013 a first-term senator and former California attorney general \u2013 but it hardly comes out of left field, as just last week she held a fundraiser for the former vice president in her home in San Francisco. Also back in January \u2013 following Biden\u2019s campaign launch \u2013 Feinstein said that \u201che brings a level of experience and seniority which I think is really important,\" according to the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nThe endorsement from Feinstein \u2013 a longtime liberal lawmaker who was first elected in 1992 \u2013 comes as Biden is struggling to hold on to his role as Democratic frontrunner. An average of recent polls compiled by Real Clear Politics has Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren virtually tied at the top of the Democratic race.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWarren, however, has surged in recent months in the polls, while Biden has dropped, and far surpassed him during the most recent quarter of fundraising.\n\nHarris, meanwhile, sits in a distant fifth in the Real Clear Politics average, behind Vermont Sen.
