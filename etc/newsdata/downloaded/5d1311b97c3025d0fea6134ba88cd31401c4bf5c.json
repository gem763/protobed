McClay.\n\nThe University of Oklahoma professor\u2019s goal for his then-upcoming book was to be the \u201cantidote\u201d to Howard Zinn\u2019s \u201cA People\u2019s History of the United States\u201d (1980). In his view, Mr. Zinn\u2019s leftist book had been \u201cgreatly oversimplifying the past and turning American history into a comic-book melodrama in which \u2018the people\u2019 are constantly being abused by \u2018the rulers.\u2019\u201d\n\nPrevious accounts were \u201cunedifying and lacking in larger perspective,\u201d he told Mrs. Schaefer-Riley, which meant \u201cZinn\u2019s sweeping melodrama looks good by comparison. Zinn\u2019s success is indicative of our failure. We have to do better.\u201d\n\nTo Mr. McClay\u2019s credit, he does just that \u2014 and more.\n\n\u201cLand of Hope: An Invitation to the Great American Story\u201d is a literary triumph on the rise of the American phoenix as a champion of democracy, liberty and freedom. The author explains in his introduction, \u201cHope has both theological and secular meanings, spiritual ones as well as material ones.\u201d\n\nReaders shouldn\u2019t be surprised \u201cto discover that many of our heroes turn out to be deeply flawed human beings,\u201d and a \u201cland of hope will also sometimes mean being a land of dashed hopes.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, he feels \u201cnothing about America better defines its distinctive character than the ubiquity of hope,\u201d and \u201c[e]ven those who are bitterly critical of America, and find its hopes to be delusions, cannot deny the enduring energy of those hopes and are not immune to their pull.\u201d\n\nThe rich, detailed moments of U.S. history will be familiar to academics and enthusiasts alike. What\u2019s remarkably refreshing is the author\u2019s ability to describe these events with honesty, integrity and, in the appropriate moments, hope and opportunity.\n\nThere have been moments of darkness in America\u2019s path to greatness, including racism and a bloody civil war that tore apart families. Mr. McClay doesn\u2019t varnish the truth, but shows how Americans were able to overcome these obstacles, learn from past mistakes and ultimately march on the right path.\n\nIn chapter after chapter, history is depicted through a clear lens rather than rose-colored glasses.\n\nFor instance, the French and Indian War was won by the British in 1763, but the \u201cwaging and results had produced a surge of pride among American colonials.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the \u201cshared experience of war generated in many of them the first stirrings of American national sentiment, the feeling that there was something more than just their shared British language and cultural heritage that bound them together.\u201d\n\nMr. McClay notes that \u201cSlavery is as old as human history.\u201d It was a horrible practice, but \u201cnot exclusively a southern phenomenon\u201d since it was once permitted in every state. He acknowledges the huge contradiction in Thomas Jefferson and George Washington owning slaves, and correctly notes the former \u201cagonized over his complicity with slavery\u201d until he opposed it late in life. Why did this happen?\n\nIn the historian\u2019s view, \u201ceach of us is born into a world that we did not make, and it is only with the greatest effort, and often at very great cost, that we are ever able to change that world for the better.\u201d\n\nThe Old South is portrayed as a \u201cdeeply baffling picture.\u201d While it had \u201cmany elements of beauty and graciousness, learning and high culture, piety and devotion,\u201d the problem was the mixture also included \u201celements of ugliness and brutal dehumanization.\u201d\n\nHe also puckishly includes the prominent pro-slavery Virginian apologist George Fitzhugh\u2019s assessment that capitalism and liberalism were bad for American society, and \u201cslavery is a form, and the very best form, of socialism.\u201d\n\nThere are many other fascinating assessments in \u201cLand of Hope.\u201d\n\nAbraham Lincoln is described by Mr. McClay as an \u201cuncommon common man born to humble frontier circumstances who rose in the world by dint of his sheer determination and effort.\u201d There\u2019s admiration for immigrants and the \u201cenormous courage, or desperation, to make the step into something completely unknown.\u201d\n\nHe praises the Great American Songbook, \u201cwhich would be, with jazz, one of the surpassing musical achievements of American culture.\u201d He suggests calling the United States \u201cisolationist\u201d during World War II wasn\u2019t accurate, but rather it was \u201creverting to a traditional policy of acting selectively and unilaterally, with the national interest foremost in its mind.\u201d\n\nThe American essence has been brilliantly captured and portrayed with wit, charm and elegance in Mr. McClay\u2019s book. Hence, it\u2019s a welcome replacement for Mr. Zinn\u2019s tired, negative apologia that has incorrectly defined the United States for too long.\n\n\u2022 Michael Taube is a frequent contributor to The Washington Times.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nLAND OF HOPE: AN INVITATION TO THE GREAT AMERICAN STORY\n\nBy Wilfred M.
