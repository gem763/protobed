I had to stop because it hit me hard and this year will be the same, but we will continue to do it for her.\n\n\u201cThis week all I have done is wish her wee beautiful face would come bouncing into the living room, most probably giving me the last minute changes to her birthday presents or asking is she\u2019s getting a birthday cake.\n\n\u201cI wonder what she would have wanted this year if she was still here - no doubt something so bizarre like last year. She had her list in well before she passed and she wanted a full gymnastics set in her bedroom, the mats, poles - the lot.\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s only been a year but it honestly feels like forever since I last saw her face, heard her voice and cuddled her.\n\n\u201cI sit and think about how much she would have changed over the year and how grown up she would be now.\u201d\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nGeorgina, her partner George Horn and her daughter Courtney, five, faced the first painful birthday without Alesha just three months after her death on July 2 last year, reports the Daily Record.\n\nShe had been abducted from her bed at her grandparents\u2019 home on the Isle of Bute, where she had been staying with her dad for the start of the summer holidays.\n\nAlesha\u2019s body was found nearby in woodland that morning after her grandmother reported her missing. She had been raped and murdered by warped teenager Aaron Campbell , who was just 16 at the time.\n\nIn the year that has passed the family has seen Campbell convicted of Alesha\u2019s murder following a trial at the High Court in Glasgow in February, during which he lied on the stand and tried to pin the crime on Alesha\u2019s dad\u2019s girlfriend.\n\nCampbell later confessed his crime to a psychologist and social worker and was sentenced to detention without limit of time, with a minimum sentence of 27 years to be served before he could be considered for parole.\n\nBut the family were dealt a further blow last month when his minimum prison term was slashed to 24 years following a successful appeal.\n\n(Image: Daily Record)\n\n(Image: Georgina Lochrane)\n\nGeorgina said: \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not gotten any easier since last year, if anything it\u2019s harder.\n\nAlesha should really should be here to celebrate her birthday, not having a vigil in her memory. But as long as I live on this earth Alesha will never be forgotten and I doubt her sister will let it happen after I\u2019m gone.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s already keeping her sister\u2019s memory alive in her own little way. She\u2019s only five and still doesn\u2019t understand why her sister can\u2019t be here, why we\u2019re releasing balloons instead of having Alesha here and celebrating it with her, but she\u2019s so excited for the vigil.\u201d\n\nAlesha's vigil will be held in Airdrie\u2019s Coatdyke Park on Sunday.\n\nThose who attend are invited to gather across the road from the war memorial from 7.30pm.\n\nAll are welcome to bring a candle and a pink balloon, to be released in Alesha\u2019s memory at 8pm.", "description": "Georgina Lochranes aid she longs to see Alesha bouncing through the house excited about her upcoming birthday - but instead will stand at her graveside playing her favourite songs and singing to her", "authors": ["Abigail O'Leary", "Image", "Daily Record", "Pa", "Georgina Lochrane"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article14133553.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_VSP_SDR_110319Georgina_55JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
