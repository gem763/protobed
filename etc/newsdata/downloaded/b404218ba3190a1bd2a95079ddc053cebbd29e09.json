The auditions were a scheme to provide Studio 4\u2019s partners with a pool of female actors of whom they could take advantage.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nTither-Kaplan and Gaal joined the school in 2014, according to the New York Times, where they paid a monthly tuition of about $300. The school offered \u201cmaster\u2019s classes\u201d for as much as $2,000, including a $750 class for sex scenes where prospective students were required to audition on videotape and sign away their rights to the recordings.\n\nIn auditions and classes, the women said they were asked to step out of their comfort zones and that they were denied industry-standard protections that dictate how actors can be portrayed in nude scenes. For example, the lawsuit claims Franco removed plastic guards that covered actress\u2019 private areas while he simulated oral sex on them.\n\nFranco opened the school, which has locations in Los Angeles and New York, in 2014 with then-business partner Vince Jolivette, who is also listed as a defendant in the suit. It closed in 2017. The school\u2019s general manager, Jay Davis, is named in the suit as well.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nThe plaintiffs are seeking monetary damages, the return or destruction of any video recordings and class-action status so that women with similar experiences can join.\n\nThis is not the first time Franco has been accused of sexual misconduct. In 2014, the actor admitted he tried to \u201cpick up\u201d a 17-year-old girl after Instagram messages between the two were shared online.", "description": "The suit claimed Franco\u2019s acting school \u201cengaged in widespread inappropriate and sexually charged behavior.\"", "authors": ["Shawn M.
