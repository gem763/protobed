He declined to elaborate on potential targets but said financial institutions had been put on notice.\n\nTurkey has also been told 'not allow even a single ISIS fighter to escape' from captivity, he announced from the White House podium at a short-notice briefing.\n\nDespite the warning, he said Erdogan's invitation to visit the White House on November 13 remained intact.\n\nThe White House announcement was intended to mollify Republican lawmakers threatening to revolt over the president's decision to remove U.S. troops from Syria, in what they decried as an abandonment of Kurdish allies who helped defeat ISIS, and turn over control of imprisoned terrorists to Erdogan's army.\n\nSens. Lindsey Graham and Chris Van Hollen have vowed to sanction Turkey over the incursion.\n\nMnuchin told DailyMail.com the president has it handled, and Congress should stand down.\n\n'Secretary Pompeo has been speaking to them daily. I\u2019ve been speaking to the Secretary multiple times a day. I think the message to Congress is -- I know that people were contemplating sanctions. We\u2019re on top of sanctions. The President will use them when necessary.\n\nScroll down for video.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin fired a warning shot at Turkey on Friday, saying the president is ready to impose sanctions, if President Recep Tayyip Erdogan steps out of line\n\nOn Friday it was reported that a hundred thousand terrified civilians fled northern Syria as Erdogan's troops continued to advance. Ankara claimed it had killed 342 Kurdish fighters.\n\nAir strikes, artillery bombardments and small arms fire raged throughout border settlements along the 75-mile front for a third day, with Foreign Minister Hulusi Akar today announcing Turkey's forces had 'neutralised' hundreds of 'terrorists.'\n\nThe United Nations estimated 100,000 people had fled, piling trucks and cars high with their possessions as shells decimated their hometowns, in a grim echo of how they sought refuge from marauding ISIS fanatics only a few years before.\n\nFrance said EU sanctions 'were on the table' today, amid widespread international condemnation for the invasion, with Emmanuel Macron warning Turkey risked 'helping Daesh (ISIS) rebuild a caliphate.'\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who pulled his Kurd-backing forces out of Syria earlier this week, declared last night the US was faced with three options: 'Send in thousands of troops and win Militarily, hit Turkey very hard Financially and with Sanctions, or mediate a deal between Turkey and the Kurds!'\n\nTrump's tweet follows backlash from within his own Republican ranks over the perceived betrayal of the Kurds, who were pivotal in defeating ISIS in Syria earlier this year.\n\nFurthermore, the Kurds have been guarding some 10,000 ISIS prisoners and Russian President Vladimir Putin joined British and US politicians today in expressing fears that they might escape.\n\n'I'm not sure whether the Turkish army will be able to take this under control - and how soon,' Putin said in televised remarks.

The area is rich in fertile lands and encompasses oil fields in the far northeast\n\nKurdish forces announced camps packed with 20,000 displaced people, including the wives and children of ISIS fighters, were to be evacuated south after they were hit by Turkish shelling.\n\nMeanwhile, at the Al-Hawl camp further south, notorious for housing British ISIS bride Shamima Begum, rioting and escape attempts were reported as news of Erdogan's offensive reached the facility.\n\n'Hey EU, wake up. I say it again: if you try to frame our operation there as an invasion, our task is simple: we will open the doors and send 3.6 million migrants to you,' Erdogan said in a speech to parliament in Ankara on Thursday\n\nDoctors Without Borders said it was forced to shut down a hospital, which served more than 200,000 people, because of the spreading violence.\n\nDespite the global outrage, Erdogan yesterday threatened Europe he would 'open the doors' for 3.6million refugees to flood into the continent if his incursion was defined as an occupation.\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk responded to the threat today, warning Erdogan the EU would never bow to such a threat.\n\n'Turkey must understand that our main concern is that their actions may lead to another humanitarian catastrophe,' Tusk said in Nicosia. 'And we will never accept that refugees are weaponised and used to blackmail us. President Erdogan's threats of yesterday are totally out of place.'\n\nUS Defence Secretary Mark Esper told Turkey to halt its advance, with the Pentagon warning it could have 'serious' and 'irreparable' consequences for Ankara.\n\nEsper told his counterpart Akar that the military actions 'place at risk' the progress made to defeat ISIS.\n\nOn Thursday, Syria's Foreign Minister Faisal Maqdad called the Kurdish-led forces traitors and said they had given Turkey an excuse to violate his country's national sovereignty.\n\nMaqdad rebuffed suggestions made by the Kurds earlier this week that talks could be re-opened with Damascus, saying these 'armed groups had betrayed their country and committed crimes against it.\n\n'We won't accept any dialogue or talk with those who had become hostages to foreign forces ... There won't be any foothold for the agents of Washington on Syrian territory.'\n\nThis afternoon an explosives-laden vehicle detonated and killed at least three civilians and wounded nine more in a busy neighbourhood of Qamishli, a stronghold of the Kurdish militia in northern Syria, SDF officials said.\n\nThe attack, which Kurdish officials said caused several casualties, came as Kurdish forces were trying to hold off a massive cross-border assault by Turkey and its proxies.\n\nOn Friday morning, Turkish jets and artillery struck around Syria's Ras al Ain.

Gunfire could also be heard inside the town, a Reuters journalist in Ceylanpinar said (pictured: a soldier watches on as armoured vehicles head to the front)\n\nTurkey announced today its first soldier had been killed in the Syrian incursion, with another three injured as Ankara claimed it had killed 342 Kurdish fighters (pictured: Turkish Army's armored vehicles are dispatched to reinforce border units from Turkey's Sanliurfa province last night)\n\nSmoke rises from the Syrian town of Tal Abyad, in a picture taken from the Turkish side of the border in Akcakale on Thursday on the second day of Turkey's military operation against Kurdish forces\n\nThe United Nations said 70,000 people have been displaced so far in the towns of Ras al Ain (known as Sari Kani in Kurdish) and Tel Abyad, where the most intense fighting has been focused\n\nA convoy of 20 armoured vehicles carrying Syrian rebels entered Syria from Ceylanpinar on Friday.

Video taken at the camp - where British ISIS bride Shamima Begum is among the detainees - shows panic as guards go running towards a group of burqa-clad women, who then sprint in the opposite direction. The camp is home to some 70,000 people - mainly ISIS wives and their children. Among them are 11,000 foreigners, including Briton Shamima Begum (pictured) Al-Hol is the largest prison camp in Syria and holds some 70,000 people, largely wives and children of ISIS fighters. Some 11,000 of the prisoners are foreign-born. British jihadi bride Shamima Begum - who fled east London to join ISIS in 2014 and has since begged to be allowed to come home - was once kept at the camp. It was here that she gave birth to a son who has since died of pneumonia. It is thought she is still at the camp. Further to the north, the Kurds have also warned that two camps and a prison holding ISIS fighters have come under direct attack from Turkish forces in what they described as a deliberate attempt to free the detainees. Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces said a camp sheltering more than 7,000 displaced people at Mabrouka, close to the Turkish border, is to be evacuated. Talks are underway about moving a second camp for 13,000 people, including around 800 relatives of Islamic State fighters, at Ain Issa, further inland. It comes a day after the al-Chirkin prison, in the town of Qamishli, was also struck by shelling. Explosions had damaged Chirkin prison where jihadi militants from some 60 countries are being kept, Kurdish jailers said. 'These attacks on prisons holding Daesh (ISIS) terrorists will lead to a catastrophe the consequences of which the world may not be able to handle later on,' the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces said in a statement. Reporting by Chris Pleasance\n\nAt least seven civilians were killed by Turkish airstrikes and sniper fire today, the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported, some in strikes on Tel Abyad and others by small arms fire around the town.\n\nA total of 17 civilians have been killed on the Syrian side since the start of the assault, according to the UK-based monitor.\n\nMeanwhile, Turkey today reported two civilians were killed when a shell hit a house in the town of Suruc, adjacent to Kobane across the border in Syria which is under the control of the Kurdish YPG. The fatalities increased the death toll of civilians killed in mortar attacks on Turkish border towns to nine.\n\nTurkey's Defence Ministry said that in overnight operations the Turkish military and its Syrian rebel allies killed 49 Kurdish militants. It says it has killed 342 militants in total.\n\nThe ministry said one Turkish soldier was killed in a clash on Thursday during the offensive, which is targeting the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), led by the Kurdish YPG militia.\n\nThe SDF said Turkish air strikes and shelling had killed nine civilians. In apparent retaliation by Kurdish-led forces, six people including a 9-month-old baby were killed by mortar fire into Turkish towns, Turkish officials said.\n\nThe Kurds claim to have successfully repelled the Turkish army and their allies in the Syrian National Army.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has contradicted Ankara's claims of 342 Kurds killed, saying 41 Kurdish fighters had died since the start of the conflict.\n\nIt added that six fighters from the Turkish-backed Syrian rebel group, the Syrian National Army, had been killed.\n\n'There is heavy fighting between the SDF and the Turks on different fronts, mostly from Tal Abyad to Ras al-Ain,' the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.\n\nIt said the Turkish forces and their Syrian proxies - mostly Sunni Arab former rebels - were deploying air strikes, heavy artillery and rocket fire.\n\n'The SDF are using tunnels, trenches and berms' in their defence operations, the Observatory said.\n\nKurdish counter-attacks overnight led to the retaking of two of the 11 villages they had lost since the start of the Turkish-led assault on Wednesday.\n\nThe Observatory and a Kurdish military source said several Arab families in the border area had sided with Turkey, raising sleeper cells to attack from behind SDF lines.\n\nAn AFP correspondent in the Ras al-Ain area said new units of Syrian former rebels were being brought in to break Kurdish resistance.\n\nRas al-Ain, Tal Abyad and other border towns between them have been almost emptied of their population in a huge wave of displacement.\n\nMost of the 70,000 people the United Nations confirmed had been displaced travelled east towards the city of Hasakeh, which has not been targeted by Turkey.\n\n'What does Erdogan want from us?,' asked one woman, referring to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan as she and her family settled in a school the local authorities had turned into an emergency shelter.\n\n'Is it all simply because we are Kurds?'\n\nPro-Turkish Syrian fighters gather along the Turkish side of the border as they prepare to roll into northern Syria in armoured trucks on Friday\n\nNight vision footage shows the green flare of gunfire as the 'hero' commandos move through the rural Syrian border after the artillery and war planes decimated positions\n\nA convoy of armoured vehicles drives towards the border to cross into Syria from Turkey on Friday morning\n\nExplosions in Syrian border towns of Ras Al Ain and Tel Abyad are seen from Ceylanpinar, Turkey on Friday morning as Erdogan's assault on the border continues\n\nPeople look out from an apartment building which was damaged by a rocket fired from Syria, in Nusaybin, Turkey on Thursday\n\nTerrified residents were seen fleeing on foot, by car and piling rickshaws high with their possessions as they left their homes -

Turkish officials said the Kurdish militia has fired dozens of mortars into Turkish border towns the past two days, including Akcakale.\n\nOn Thursday morning Turkey-backed Syrian rebel fighters were cheered as they rolled towards the border in armoured vehicles, heading for battlefronts where Kurdish fighters have dug in.\n\nThe Kurdish-led SDF said Turkish warplanes had caused 'huge panic' when they attacked the Kurdish-held territory, and claimed the bombardments had killed and wounded civilians.\n\nSDF spokesman Mustafa Bali said on Twitter: 'Turkish warplanes have started to carry out air strikes on civilian areas.'\n\nPictures and video footage from the ground appeared to show civilians desperately fleeing the area as clouds of smoke rose from the positions targeted by Turkish jets.\n\nThere were signs of terror in the streets of Ras al-Ayn- one of the Syrian towns under attack with residential areas close to the border.\n\nNear the town of Qamishli, plumes of smoke rose from an area close to the border after activists reported explosions nearby.\n\nBali reported yesterday morning that the SDF had repelled Turkish forces ground attacks.

I have to say if the Turkish plan involves the creation of a so-called safe zone, don't expect the European Union to pay for any of it.' NATO NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Wednesday Turkey had 'legitimate security concerns' and had informed NATO about its attack against Kurdish fighters in Syria. 'I count on Turkey to act with restraint and ensure that any action it may take in northern Syria is proportionate and measured,' he said after meeting Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. 'It is important to avoid actions that may further destabilise the region, escalate tensions and cause more human suffering.' Israel Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned Turkey's actions and warned of an 'ethnic cleansing' against the Kurds. He said Israel is prepared to extend humanitarian assistance to the 'gallant Kurdish people.' Germany German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said Turkey's operation would lead to further destabilisation of the region and could strengthen Islamic State. He urged Turkey to end the operation. France France's European affairs minister Amelie de Montchalin said France and Britain would call a U.N. Security Council meeting over the Turkish offensive. France, Germany and Britain are finalising a joint statement condemning the advance. Italy Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said the operation risked destabilising the region and harming civilians. Denmark Danish Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod tweeted: 'Deeply concerned about Turkish military operation in Syria. In my view, this is a regrettable and wrong decision, which can have serious consequences for civilians and the fight against ISIL (Islamic State).' Russia Russian President Vladimir Putin urged his Turkish counterpart President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to 'think carefully' before taking any action. Erdogan for his part told Putin that the offensive 'will contribute to Syria's peace and stability and ease the path to a political solution'. Netherlands 'I call on Turkey not to follow the path it has chosen,' Dutch foreign minister Stef Blok said. 'No one can benefit from the potentially terrible humanitarian consequences. The operation can trigger new refugee flows and harm the fight against IS and stability in the region.' UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said he had 'serious concerns' about Turkey's military action. He said: 'This risks destabilising the region, exacerbating humanitarian suffering, and undermining the progress made against Daesh which should be our collective focus.' Iran Iran on Thursday called for an 'immediate halt' to the Turkish Syria offensive. India India's foreign ministry issued a press release Thursday saying it is 'deeply concerned at the unilateral military offensive by Turkey in north-east Syria.' It cautioned that Turkey's actions can undermine stability in the region and the fight against terrorism. Its action also has the potential for causing humanitarian and civilian distress.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Turkish troops tried to push ahead on several fronts under the cover of airstrikes and artillery shelling but made no tangible progress.\n\nThe Observatory said that since Turkey began its operation, seven civilians have been killed.\n\nCNN Turk broadcast video showing a crane overnight removing a concrete block from the border wall and commandos moving in single-file alongside the barrier.\n\nIn the Turkish border town of Akcakale, around 30 vehicles carrying Syrian rebels, many pick-up trucks mounted with anti-aircraft machines drove along the main road along the Turkish side of the border from Syria's Tel Abyad.\n\nThey were accompanied by some 10 Turkish military armoured vehicles. It was not clear where they were heading. Earlier, a witness in Akcakale said volleys of rockets were fired from there across the border.\n\nTurkish forces shelled targets near Ral al Ain on Thursday morning, and SDF fighters responded, a witness said.\n\nThe Turkish border town of Akcakale was quiet for much of the morning after sporadic gunfire and the sound of tank movement were heard in the early hours, Reuters journalists said. Explosions just over the border had rocked the town of Tel Abyad earlier in the night, they said.\n\nTurkey regards the Kurdish militia as a terrorist group because of its links to Kurdish PKK militants waging a decades-old insurgency in southeast Turkey.\n\nTroops have entered Syria at four points, two of them close to Tel Abyad and two close to Ras al Ain further east, according to Turkish media reports. Air strikes killed at least five civilians and three SDF fighters, while dozens of civilians were wounded, the SDF said.
