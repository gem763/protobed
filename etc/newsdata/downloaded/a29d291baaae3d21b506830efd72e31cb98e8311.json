The app, however, will continue to function as usual on Windows.\n\nThe Cupertino-based tech giant fixed the zero-day vulnerability on October 7 with its release of iTunes 12.10.1 for Windows and iCloud for Windows 7.14 immediately after it was responsibly disclosed.\n\nAccording to Morphisec, adversaries exploited an unquoted path vulnerability in Bonjour helper utility packaged along with iTunes to install the ransomware on computers of an unidentified enterprise in the automotive industry.\n\nGiven the fact that Bonjour remains installed even after uninstalling iTunes, it\u2019s recommended that the software is manually removed from the vulnerable workstations, or the latest version of iTunes is installed to plug the flaw that\u2019s present on an older version of Bonjour.\n\nAs the name indicates, the flaw occurs when the path to the location of a service isn\u2019t enclosed in quotations, resulting in Windows looking for the service in every folder along the path until it finds the actual file.\n\nIn other words, if a program is located in c:\\program files\\sub folder 1\\sub folder 2\\program.exe, an attacker could exploit the lack of quotes surrounding the path string in a piece of code to execute a malicious program of their own present in another folder: c:\\program files\\sub folder 1\\malicious program.exe.\n\nCredit: Morphisec The BitPaymer ransomware disguised as a \u2018Program\u2019 exploiting the unquoted path vulnerability\n\nNotably, this path hijack flaw can be abused to gain elevated privileges, especially if the service is running as a SYSTEM user (or admin), thus making it possible to install all kinds of malware \u2014 the BitPaymer ransomware in this case.\n\nThe ransomware itself was named \u2018Program\u2018 and didn\u2019t come with an extension such as \u2018.exe\u2019, Morphisec CTO Michael Gorelik noted, thus allowing the program to evade exposure and bypass antivirus protections. However, there were no privilege escaltions as a result of the flaw.\n\nBitPaymer (aka iEncrypt) is known to be an aggressive variant of ransomware that encrypts not just the data files but also the apps and program files, while stopping short of tampering with the operating system.\n\n\u201cThe BitPaymer/IEncrypt group exhibits an advanced innovative spirit,\u201d the researchers concluded. \u201cThe group must have performed serious reconnaissance research to consistently stay one step ahead of the defenders.\u201d\n\nRead next: Want to succeed as an entrepreneur?
