REUTERS/Costas Baltas\n\nVancouver-based miner Eldorado has two operating mines and two development projects in northern Greece and its planned investment is viewed as one of the biggest in the country in years.\n\nThe projects have, however, repeatedly stalled over licensing delays and environmental concerns.\n\nThey have become flagship schemes for Greece\u2019s new conservative government, which took office in July with a pledge to unblock foreign investments and help boost economic output crimped by a quarter through years of financial turmoil.\n\nEarly this month, the government issued installation permits for Eldorado\u2019s Skouries project.\n\n\u201cWe want to move ahead with a contract which, on the one hand, will send a business-friendly message, and on the other hand, a contract that will secure more jobs, more royalties and clear environmental protection for the region in line with European standards,\u201d Hatzidakis told Reuters.\n\n\u201cThere are negotiations right now. What we have told Eldorado Gold is that we don\u2019t want these negotiations to slow down, but it also depends on the proposals they will present. We cannot reach an agreement at any expense.\u201d\n\nOne standoff between the previous leftist-led administration and Eldorado was over the company\u2019s plan to build a metallurgical plant to process ores mined in Skouries. The government had said that plan was deficient.\n\nNew Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has said that the government could revise the contract to possibly include a new investment by Eldorado in another Greek region.\n\nGAS UTILITY SALE\n\nMitsotakis has also been keen to speed up privatizations in the energy sector, including natural gas utility DEPA, which is 65% state-owned.\n\nThe previous government passed a legislation which split DEPA operations, with the aim to sell a 50.1% stake in its commercial business and a minority stake in its distribution networks across Greece.\n\nHatzidakis said that he would soon amend that law to allow for the sale of majority stakes both in DEPA\u2019s retail operations and its distribution grid.\n\n\u201cWe have indications that there will be strong (investor) interest.\u201d\n\nHatzidakis, 54, a former European Union parliament member, has been tasked to work on a rescue plan for state-owned Public Power Corp (PPC) which has been struggling with 2.7 billion euros ($2.99 billion) of unpaid bills from customers unable to pay during the country\u2019s financial crisis.\n\nAuthorities increased electricity rates and reduced discounts offered to customers who paid on time in September in an attempt to plug a cash shortfall estimated at more than 900 million euros.\n\nHatzidakis also pledged that the state would settle subsidies owed to PPC in return for providing cheap electricity to vulnerable customers and remote islands.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about 200 million euros and will be paid in the coming months,\u201d he said.\n\nUnder its post bailout commitment with its international lenders, Greece has agreed that PPC will sell power to its peers at below-cost prices to help open up the sector via the so-called NOME auctions. Hatzidakis says this has cost the utility about 600 million euros and the NOME auctions would be scrapped.\n\nThe government has been discussing with its lenders alternative structural measures for PPC and the energy market, which included the gradual decommissioning of coal-fired plants and the partial privatization of the power distribution grid, Hatzidakis said.\n\n\u201cNOME will be scrapped and the auction which is scheduled for October will not take place,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe government needs to have finalised structural measures for the energy market and PPC by the end of October, mid-November\u201d.", "description": "Greece is in talks with Canada's Eldorado Gold to secure higher royalties from its mining development projects and new jobs, Energy Minister Kostis Hatzidakis said on Monday.", "authors": ["Angeliki Koutantou", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430413410&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F0O7-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
