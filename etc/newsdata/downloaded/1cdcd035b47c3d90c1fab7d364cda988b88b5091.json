In the past year alone, there has been a 12 per cent rise.\n\nMinisters have previously warned that universities which hand out soaring numbers of unconditional offers are undermining the credibility of higher education and urged them to rein in the practice. Universities have been accused of acting in a \u201ccompletely irresponsible\u201d manner by handing out so many unconditional offers.", "description": "Students who are given unconditional offers are more likely to drop out of university than those who are forced to earn their place with grades, research shows.", "authors": ["Camilla Turner", "Education Editor", "Allister Heath", "David Goodhart", "Judith Woods"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/education-and-careers/2019/07/19/TELEMMGLPICT000203064981-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
