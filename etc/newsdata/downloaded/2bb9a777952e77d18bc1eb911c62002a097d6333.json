There might be one in the Senate. There\u2019s some line of argumentation that you can start to see Republican senators start to get freaked out about the very durability of the country\u2019s interests being vouch-saved about the man in charge of it that might make them more open or more willing to break with Trump on other things. Do you think that is true?\n\nSTEVE SCHMIDT: We haven\u2019t seen it so far. This is the first instance. Because [of] the incompetence of the decision and the consequences of that decision, we have hundreds of ISIS fighters who have escaped from prison. They\u2019re not going to go to community college. What they\u2019re going to do is they\u2019re going to kill people and they\u2019ll kill people in western capitals. We see a foreign policy disaster really of unprecedented dimensions.\n\nThe consequences of that disaster will be felt for years. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. We don\u2019t know how any of this will play out, other than to say Trump has unleashed vast quantities of human suffering, he has destabilized the most destabilized region in the world, and he has harmed deeply the national security interests of this country.", "description": "Steve Schmidt said President Donald Trump \"unleashed vast quantities of human suffering\" by withdrawing U.S. troops from northern Syria.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/08/McCain-Trump-.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
