But the US senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s deadpan response when quizzed about same-sex marriage during a TV debate drew applause and widespread admiration.\n\nDuring the CNN forum on LGBT issues on Thursday, Morgan Cox, the chair of the Human Rights Campaign board of directors, asked Warren how she would react to a supporter who said: \u201cI\u2019m old-fashioned and my faith teaches me that marriage is between one man and one woman.\u201d\n\nWarren replied: \u201cWell, I\u2019m going to assume it\u2019s a guy who said that. And I\u2019m going to say, then just marry one woman. I\u2019m cool with that. Assuming you can find one.\u201d\n\nCNN's Chris Cuomo apologizes for joke about gender pronouns Read more\n\nThe Democratic candidate\u2019s popularity in the polls has been rising steadily and she is now considered a serious challenger to Joe Biden, the early frontrunner to be the party\u2019s 2020 presidential nominee.\n\nBefore the event, Warren put forward a plan to further secure LGBT rights and declared her support for the Equality Act, which is backed by most Democrats. If passed, the bill would add LGBT protections to federal anti-discrimination law.\n\nShe also promised to elevate LGBT concerns by appointing a special envoy at the state department.\n\nWarren later reflected on how faith has an influence on many people\u2019s views about the LGBT community, and recited the first song she remembered learning as a child in Oklahoma.\n\n\u201cThey are yellow, black and white. They are precious in his sight. Jesus loves all the children of the world,\u201d she sang.\n\n\u201cThat was the basis of the faith I grew up in,\u201d she said, growing more serious. \u201cIt truly is about the preciousness of each and every life. It is about the worth of every human being.", "description": "Increasingly popular candidate for US presidential race deals smartly with tricky question", "authors": ["Sarah Marsh"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5dadc680e8c6674122ddd6f7556e880fa3a77f9/0_14_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=692e6757ae408676444ba4fb13af06c5", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
