Speaking in New York, the president insisted he did not take the threat of impeachment seriously and tried to turn the accusations against him back on his opponents, saying Biden was \u201ccorrupt\u201d and the media \u201ccrooked\u201d.\n\nWhistleblower scandal. The House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, has so far resisted calls to begin impeachment proceedings against Trump. Adam Gabbatt explains why the Ukraine scandal may be serious enough to change her mind.\n\nPlayground taunts. The president\u2019s playground tactic of redirecting accusations of misconduct back at his accusers has proven disappointingly effective in the past, says Tom McCarthy.\n\nTrump mocks Greta Thunberg\u2019s emotional climate speech\n\nPlay Video 0:18 Greta Thunberg stares down Trump as he arrives for UN climate summit \u2013 video\n\nTrump appeared to mock the teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg on Monday, after she made an impassioned speech at the UN climate summit, excoriating world leaders for their \u201cbetrayal\u201d of young people by failing to tackle the climate crisis. Thunberg\u2019s angry address was widely shared, including by the US president, who tweeted: \u201cShe seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!\u201d\n\n\u2018You are failing us.\u2019 Thunberg\u2019s criticisms of world leaders looked prescient after Monday\u2019s summit. Trump only fleetingly attended the climate event, China failed to put forward any new climate measures, and Brazil skipped the summit altogether.\n\nMissing targets. Just one in five of the world\u2019s largest businesses are expected to to meet the targets agreed in the Paris climate agreement, according to an analysis by the investment data provider Arabesque S-Ray.\n\nHow the FBI targeted environmental activists\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An indigenous activist at a 2017 protest in Washington against the Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines. Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters\n\nMore than a dozen environmental activists who campaigned against fossil fuel extraction in North America were identified in domestic terrorism-related investigations by the FBI, according to hundreds of pages of the bureau\u2019s files that were obtained by the Guardian through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit. The investigations were opened in 2013-14, at the height of opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline, and characterised non-violent protesters as a potential threat to national security.\n\nKeystone XL pipeline. In 2015, in a victory for campaigners, the Obama administration rejected the Keystone XL pipeline project. The Trump administration has since reversed that decision.\n\nBoris Johnson calls for new \u2018Trump deal\u2019 with Iran\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Johnson hailed the US president as a \u2018very, very brilliant negotiator\u2019. Photograph: Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nThe UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, has hailed Trump as a \u201cvery, very brilliant negotiator\u201d and called on him to forge a new \u201cTrump deal\u201d with Iran, after siding with the US president on the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement, which Johnson described as a \u201cbad deal\u201d. Johnson\u2019s remarks, in an interview with NBC, were a departure from previous UK rhetoric on Iran, apparently designed to emphasise his personal relationship with Trump at the expense of the UK\u2019s European allies and co-signatories to the deal.\n\nProroguing threat. The British supreme court is set to rule on Tuesday as to whether Johnson\u2019s recent suspension of parliament was lawful, but Johnson has nonetheless refused to rule out using the same tactic again.\n\nAmerican friend. Johnson\u2019s close friendship with an American businesswoman \u2013 who was granted \u00a3126,000 in public money during his time as London mayor \u2013 is under scrutiny, as Matthew Weaver and Simon Murphy explain.\n\nCheat sheet\n\nMust-reads\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Migrant families detained at an overcrowded US Border Patrol processing centre in McAllen, Texas.

Forty years ago, the system didn\u2019t even exist. In this investigative multimedia report, The Marshall Project\u2019s Emily Kassie tells the story of America\u2019s staggering immigration detention boom.\n\nI \u2018stormed\u2019 Area 51 and it was weirder than I imagined\n\nIn June, a college student created a Facebook event, which suggested \u201cstorming\u201d Area 51, the secret air force base where the US government is rumoured to be hiding evidence of aliens. Soon the joke event had more than a million RSVPs. J Oliver Conroy went to the Nevada desert to see what happened next.\n\nGirl in a box: the mysterious crime that shocked Germany\n\nOn 15 September 1981, 10-year-old Ursula Herrmann set off for home on her bike from a cousin\u2019s house. She never made it. Almost four decades later, her case remains contentious \u2013 and, Ursula\u2019s brother believes, unsolved. Xan Rice reports.\n\nKen Burns\u2019 Country Music celebrates the outsider\n\nThe celebrated documentarian Ken Burns\u2019 latest opus is a 16-hour history of country music, a genre long seen as viewing outsiders with skepticism and hostility. Yet as an outsider himself, Burns presents an image of country far more diverse than its stereotype would suggest, says Jonathan Keefe.\n\nOpinion\n\nChanel Miller, the victim of the convicted Stanford rapist Brock Turner, has waived her right to anonymity by publishing a memoir and giving her first TV interview. In speaking out, sexual assault survivors can stop the media\u2019s victim-blaming, and shift focus away from the feelings of perpetrators, says Kristine Ziwica.\n\nAs Miller so powerfully demonstrates, victims who speak out can fundamentally change how we understand sexual assault, the culture that enables it and, most importantly, who should be held accountable. Hint: never the victim.\n\nSport\n\nThe USA World Cup winner Megan Rapinoe has spoken out about racism, homophobia and soccer\u2019s gender pay gap after being named player of the year at Fifa\u2019s The Best awards in Milan. Lionel Messi was named men\u2019s player of the year, while the USA coach, Jill Ellis, and Liverpool\u2019s manager, J\u00fcrgen Klopp, won the coaching prizes.\n\nThe World Anti-Doping Agency has given Russia three weeks to explain apparent inconsistencies in data from its Moscow drug-testing laboratory or face the possibility of being banned from the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.\n\nSign up\n\nThe US morning briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.
