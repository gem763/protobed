My journey abroad hasn\u2019t succeeded.\u201d\n\nVietHome said it has passed the photographs it has received on to Essex Police to help the process of identifying the dead currently taking place.", "description": "The families of as many as 20 Vietnamese migrants fear they were among those who perished in a refrigerator unit found at an industrial estate in Essex.", "authors": ["Patrick Sawer", "Senior News Reporter", "Charlotte Lytton", "Juliet Samuel", "Rowan Pelling", "George Carey", "Nicky Morgan", "Charles Moore"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/26/TELEMMGLPICT000214115787-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwWPw2b5__oFarkj5WlWIJuI.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
