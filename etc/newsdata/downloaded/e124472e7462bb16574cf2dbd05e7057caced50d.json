You can ruin your political career and immolate your party by imposing a ruinous new sales tax, a gargantuan income tax hike or a surtax on corporate income that would wreck thousands of businesses.\n\nThis is the cost of bold plans.\n\nSupporters of Medicare for All, the huge, single-payer government health plan backed by Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and several other Democratic presidential candidates, say it\u2019s time to think big and move to a health plan that covers everyone. Getting there is a bit tricky, however. A variety of analyses estimate that Medicare for All would require at least $3 trillion in new spending. That\u2019s about as much tax revenue as the government brings in now. So if paid for through new taxes, federal taxation would have to roughly double.\n\nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) has done voters a favor by spelling out what kinds of new taxes it would take to come up with that much money. Warren justifies many of her programs by saying all it would take is \u201ctwo cents\u201d from the wealthy. That\u2019s a reference to her 2% wealth tax on ultra-millionaires. But Medicare for All would be so expensive that if you taxed top earners at 100%\u2014that\u2019s right, if you took all the income of couples earning more than $408,000 per year\u2014you\u2019d still fall far short. And everybody getting taxed at 100% would obviously stop working.\n\nOkay, that won\u2019t do it. So what will? CRFB outlined a variety of options. A 42% national sales tax (known as a valued-added tax) would generate about $3 trillion in revenue. But it would destroy the consumer spending that\u2019s the backbone of the U.S. economy. A tax of that magnitude would be like 42% inflation, wrecking consumer budgets and the many companies that depend on them, from Walmart and Amazon to your local car dealer.\n\nFILE - In this July 30, 2019 file photo, Sen.

Or, the government could cut 80% of spending on everything but health care, which would include highways, airports and the Pentagon. Or here\u2019s a good one: Just borrow the money and quadruple Washington\u2019s annual deficits.\n\nThe best idea might be charging every enrollee in the new program $7,500 per year, so they\u2019d be paying directly for the coverage they\u2019re getting. Some people pay more than that now for health care, by purchasing insurance outright or sacrificing pay raises in exchange for employer coverage. It would still be a nifty trick to propose that to voters.\n\nThe upside to these impossibly draconian scenarios is that nobody would pay anything for health care, except in the $7,500 example. And it\u2019s possible that Medicare for All would cover health care for more people at a lower total cost than we spend now, meaning the average cost per person would go down. The problem is transitioning from what we have now to whatever Medicare for all would be. And it\u2019s a giant problem, like crossing the Mississippi River without a bridge or a boat. The other side might look great but you\u2019ll die before you get there.\n\nWarren, Sanders and others tout the virtues of this magical health care program without explaining what it would cost. Sanders has at least suggested some possible ways to pay for it, including premiums paid by enrollees, a wealth tax on millionaires and income tax rates as high as 52%. Warren has been cagier, saying only that under her plan \u201ccosts\u201d would go down for middle-class families. Under pressure to explain, Warren has pledged to come up with a financing plan soon. Now, maybe she doesn\u2019t have to.\n\nRick Newman is the author of four books, including \u201cRebounders: How Winners Pivot from Setback to Success.\u201d Follow him on Twitter: @rickjnewman.
