If only he could revert to his former promising style of leadership", "language": "en", "text": "Although recent events haven\u2019t been too kind to Boris Johnson or shone a positive light on his leadership skills, there was a time in the not too distant past when he was the candidate that united the Conservative Party.\n\nThrough his seemingly solid \u201cdo or die\u201d promises and ability to appeal to different groups within his party, Johnson was elected as the leader of the Conservatives which, in itself, is no piece of cake. During his tenure as prime minister so far, Johnson has lost his majority, ousted a number of his MPs, and then returned to these very MPs and asked for their support.\n\nYet, there have been times where he has shown glimpses of his leadership skills and initiative.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nJohnson started his 18-year political career as the MP for Henley, and his rise to prime minister has required him to be patient and resilient \u2013 but he has often fallen quickly into brash, churlish behaviour. Even though some may not like his style of leadership, it\u2019s difficult to deny that he has achieved what Theresa May failed to do three times: get the EU to agree on changes to the Brexit deal. We are therefore in the throes of defining the path forward. Is this a result of good leadership? Or simply a man driven by his own quest for glory?\n\nIn such uncertain political times, members of the Conservative Party chose Johnson because he was confident, assured and unrelenting in his promises \u2013 particularly his promise to leave the EU by October 31st, with or without a deal. While this style of direct leadership may be effective in times of chaos, in Johnson\u2019s case it has proven to be unnerving for others and in the end has been the undoing of initial support that he was able to garner. Just look at the number of Tory MPs who have defected since his term began.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

He has won very few votes in the house and suddenly it seems that maybe Johnson doesn\u2019t have what it takes to do the very job he\u2019s worked his entire career to attain.\n\nFor leaders in any sector, whether it be business, politics or education, making sure you don\u2019t become a victim of believing your own hype, or overstretching your assertiveness and urgency, such that it conveys a sense of panic and chaos, is the key point to take away from Johnson\u2019s start to life as prime minister. Although the almost militant-level of controlling leadership may work in terms of pulling people in your chosen direction during times of uncertainty, it is anything but sustainable.. Your leadership style should change and evolve \u2013 something Johnson has yet to learn.\n\nWhen being pressed in the House of Commons recently on a variety of issues Johnson responded: \u201cBritain needs sensible, moderate, progressive Conservative Government,\u201d \u2013 something which quite clearly contradicts his current style of leadership.\n\nFor leaders around the world, there are just a few things people really care about and look for: do they care about me; can I trust them; and will they get the job done?\n\nWhen it comes to leading a group of people, whether it\u2019s a group of employees, a football team, or an expedition to the tip of Mount Everest \u2013 your followers must be able to answer at least two, and preferably three, of these questions with: \"yes\".\n\nPeople want an honest leader who is culpable for their own actions. No one finds it easy to trust someone who tries to shift the blame elsewhere.\n\nFor people across the UK, even those who identify as Conservatives, it\u2019s hard to answer any of these questions with \u201cyes\u201d when it comes to Boris Johnson. Time after time he has deflected blame away from himself by distracting the press with inflammatory stories and indeterminate statements. The public has long had a distrust in the government, and it is currently at an all-time low because of Johnson\u2019s behaviour. His refusal to address the accusations of having an affair with an honest, open and explicit response is testimony to this.\n\nJohnson positions himself as a leader who wants to get things done, and someone who is always in complete control.\n\nBut the truth is that Johnson is a hubristic leader who seems to believe that his actions will have no consequence, and that his way is the only way. His lack of compromise and willingness to accept defeat was shown in his refusal to sign the extension request to Brussels this week. These are extremely dangerous values for a leader of a country, especially in such uncertain times. Britain needs a poised, trustworthy and seasoned negotiator to lead them out of this difficult time \u2013 Boris Johnson is not that man.\n\nRita Trehan is CEO of global transformation consultancy Dare Worldwide", "description": "Although recent events haven\u2019t been too kind to Boris Johnson or shone a positive light on his leadership skills, there was a time in the not too distant past when he was the candidate that united the Conservative Party.", "authors": ["Rita Trehan"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/25/08/boris-johnson-point.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
