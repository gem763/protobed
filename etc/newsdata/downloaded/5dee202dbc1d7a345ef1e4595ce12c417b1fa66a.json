Ultimately we're trying to do the best for the team in our roles.\"\n\nHooker Dane Coles, however, described the Barrett trio as very different people.\n\n\"Jordie's a psycho because he's been bullied by Scooter (Scott). Scooter's the one who's nice and calm,\" he said.\n\n\"Baz (Beauden) is in between, he does lose it now and again but he does have that calmness about him.\"\n\nColes immediately jumped back in on Jordie: \"We play a bit of darts in the team room, and Jordie loses the guts if he throws a bad dart, he's a psycho, a psycho!\"\n\nAll three Barretts were named in Steve Hansen's side to face England in Saturday's World Cup semi-final in Yokohama, with Beauden and Scott starting while Jordie is on the bench.\n\nJordie admitted that their father, Kevin 'Smiley' Barrett, a former Hurricanes and Taranaki lock/flank, would likely try to pass on some top tips to Scott, picked at blindside.\n\n\"I'm sure he'll try to add his 10 cents in the next couple of days,\" Jordie Barrett said.\n\n\"As long as he doesn't follow some of dad's tactics from 1998 - you probably can't get away with now!\"\n\nBeauden Barrett roomed with Jordie last week, but has found himself with Scott this week, for the first time since 2002.\n\n\"He's a bit bigger since the top bunk he slept in - he probably wouldn't fit! I was on the bottom bunk back in 2002,\" he said.\n\n\"It's great to room with him, he's clearly got his rugby head on because the other night he was sleep-talking and was calling out line-out moves.\"\n\nWith Richie Mo'unga starting at flyhalf, Beauden Barrett has slotted into a free-roaming fullback role such is his versatility, an attribute obvious in all the Barretts.\n\n\"As a back the skill sets required from a 10 or 15 are pretty similar,\" Beauden said.\n\n\"As for Jordie, he can cover the midfield too probably because of his size and physicality.\"\n\nScott is the biggest of the three and is usually a second-row forward.\n\n\"Because of his skill set, his good handling skills and ball carrying ability, he can probably play six (blindside flank) well too,\" said Beauden.\n\n\"We take a lot of pride every opportunity we get to put the black jersey on. We're lucky to get another one this weekend and obviously it's a pretty big game.\"\n\nThe Barretts have had to contend with the death of their grandfather Ted into the run-in to the quarter-final last week, saying it was good timing to have their father out in Japan for mutual support.\n\n\"Last week was a tough week for him (father Kevin) and for ourselves,\" Beauden Barrett said, adding that it was \"awesome\" to share the victory over Ireland with him.\n\n\"He's called 'Smiley' for a reason. That grin of his comes out quite often, it's always good to see. He's a proud dad.\"\n\nTurning to Saturday's semi-final, Barrett said it was all about the feel-good factor.\n\n\"We have to remind ourselves before the game as the pressure comes on to take a moment to realise where you are, that you're playing a game you love. Enjoying those moments is so important,\" he said.\n\n\"If we play well it helps with that factor but at the end of the day it's just a game and we're out there giving it our best and hopefully having fun doing so.\"\n\nTeams:\n\nNew Zealand\n\n\n\n15 Beauden Barrett, 14 Sevu Reece, 13 Jack Goodhue, 12 Anton Lienert-Brown, 11 George Bridge, 10 Richie Mo'unga, 9 Aaron Smith, 8 Kieran Read (captain), 7 Ardie Savea, 6 Scott Barrett, 5 Sam Whitelock, 4 Brodie Retallick, 3 Nepo Laulala, 2 Cody Taylor, 1 Joe Moody\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Dane Coles, 17 Ofa Tu'ungafasi, 18 Angus Ta'avao, 19 Patrick Tuipulotu, 20 Sam Cane, 21 TJ Perenara, 22 Sonny Bill Williams, 23 Jordie Barrett\n\nEngland\n\n15 Elliot Daly, 14 Anthony Watson, 13 Manu Tuilagi, 12 Owen Farrell (captain), 11 Jonny May, 10 George Ford, 9 Ben Youngs, 8 Billy Vunipola, 7 Sam Underhill, 6 Tom Curry, 5 Courtney Lawes, 4 Maro Itoje, 3 Kyle Sinckler, 2 Jamie George, 1 Mako Vunipola\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Luke Cowan-Dickie, 17 Joe Marler, 18 Dan Cole, 19 George Kruis, 20 Mark Wilson, 21 Willi Heinz, 22 Henry Slade, 23 Jonathan Joseph", "description": "Fraternal rivalry between Beauden, Scott and Jordie Barrett has been shelved as they look to help New Zealand claim a third successive Rugby World Cup.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7870/57a7cac8a8504eab912d207b56f0d541.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
