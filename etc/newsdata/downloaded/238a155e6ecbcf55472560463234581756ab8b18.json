I dare you!\n\nThe 24-year-old model dressed up in a costume inspired by the 1976 horror classic Carrie on Tuesday while out and about in Los Angeles.\n\nNo doubt she was getting ready to hit up a Halloween party as she was covered up in faux blood.\n\nIn the spirit: Ireland Baldwin dressed up in a costume inspired by the 1976 horror classic Carrie on Tuesday while out and about in Los Angeles\n\nClassic: Sissy Spacek in the 1976 film Carrie\n\nShe donned a white long-sleeved mini dress along with strappy black heels.\n\nHer make-up was fully done including a swipe of shiny pink lip as she had two bloody streaks running down from her eyes.\n\nIreland's brunette tresses were put in a bun as she walked along with her cell phone in hand.\n\nOut and about: No doubt the 24-year-old model was getting ready to hit up a Halloween party as she was covered up in faux blood\n\nWow factor: She donned a white long-sleeved mini dress along with strappy black heels\n\nThe model also covered up some of her many - 24 to be exact - tattoos that she has covering her body.\n\nHer left arm carries a majority of the tattoos with numerous small designs tatted around her entire arm.\n\nShe also has a large red lotus flower along her waist.\n\nThe blonde bombshell recently made headlines last month when she went on The Comedy Central Roast of Alec Baldwin.\n\nInteresting: Her make-up was fully done including a swipe of shiny pink lip as she had two bloody streaks running down from her eyes\n\n'Dad, I'm Ireland.
