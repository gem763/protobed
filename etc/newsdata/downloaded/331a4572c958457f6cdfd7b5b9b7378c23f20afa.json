Reports concerning Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, role in sitting on the board of a Ukrainian gas company first appeared in May.\n\n\u201cIn our conversations dealing with this issue, I never heard the president say the words Biden,\u201d he told Hewitt. \u201cI never heard the word Biden mentioned, not from him, not from staff, not from the EU ambassador [Gordon Sondland], not from [former U.S. special representative for Ukraine] Kurt Volker. Never one time was that said.\u201d\n\nPerry was not asked nor did he address his involvement as one of the \u201cthree amigos\u201d that a top U.S. diplomat told congressional investigators Tuesday amounted to \u201can irregular, informal channel of U.S. policymaking with respect to Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThe testimony from that diplomat, William Taylor, painted a damaging portrait showing that Trump sought to withhold critical military aid to Ukraine and refuse a White House meeting with the country\u2019s president unless he pursued politically motivated investigations into Trump\u2019s rivals.\n\nThe former Texas governor defended his decision to not comply with the Congressional subpoena seeking information in a separate interview on Fox Business.\n\n\u201cThe president did absolutely nothing wrong,\" he said. \"I was in those meetings. He never said the word Biden in any of them and there is no quid pro quo going on here like the Democrats would like to make you think. We\u2019re not going to participate in an unlawful effort. When the Congress follows the precedent in this impeachment effort, then I\u2019ll be happy to go but not until they have a vote, not until they follow the law.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/b0/6e/a333936847148d3f198353d1b9ea/191023-rick-perry-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
