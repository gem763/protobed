Petey is hot on the heels of Joey the Rescue, a surf veteran who retired after last year\u2019s event with a cabinet full of medals at 13 years old. This year, Petey will be riding the waves solo, launched by his handler, who\u2019s been training him in Huntington Beach over the summer. When he\u2019s not surfing, you\u2019ll find him hanging out in the westie tent with his fluffy entourage.\n\nGidget the pug\n\nAn unlikely looking champ, at first glance Gidget may appear to be a nonplussed pug sporting a Barbie-pink baseball camp and wetsuit, but in fact she\u2019s one of this year\u2019s hottest contenders, and is such a good surfer that she even surfs backwards, performing 360-degree spins along the way. Gidget\u2019s owners first picked up on her surf skills when the former agility dog hopped on a paddleboard and cruised her way across the ocean. With stable legs and a serious core, they realised they had an athlete on their hands. This year the tiny pug will be competing in the \u2018under 20 pounds\u2019 category.\n\nSkyler the Queensland heeler\n\nAll eyes are on Skyler Valentine Henard, who\u2019s back in the shredder division following a string of wins over the last few years, including 2nd place in the shredder division in 2018 and 1st place in the tandem dog and human division in 2017.\n\nThe red Queensland heeler first got into surfing when her owner, Homer, took his paddleboard out on the harbour and Skyler jumped right on. In surf events, you\u2019ll find her out back riding the big waves instead of sticking to the white water, all while raising awareness for several surf-therapy organisations, including Waves of Impact, Ride a Wave and Walk on Water.\n\nCherie the Frenchie\n\nCherie the Frenchie has made quite a name for herself, not just as a pro four-legged surfer but as an Instagram star. With over 30,000 followers and counting, when the eight-year-old pooch isn\u2019t out in the ocean you\u2019ll find her promoting healthy snacks and shampoo, enjoying massages on the beach and raising money for the French Bulldog Rescue Network. The fashion-focused Frenchie takes her clothes as seriously as her sport \u2013 catch her in pink bikinis, Metallica t-shirts, flower garlands and neon-pink shades. This year, she\u2019ll be going for gold in the owner launched category of the competition.\n\nRothstein the bulldog\n\nWave-loving bulldog Rothstein will be travelling up from San Diego for this weekend\u2019s event, in a bid to be hailed surf king of Huntington Beach. When he\u2019s not competing, you\u2019ll find him out on the waves at Pacific Beach, bonding with his owner John Garcia and capturing up-close Go Pro footage of his weekend surfing action. And when he\u2019s not on the water, he\u2019ll be cruising the streets in his Hawaiian shirts, or watching the San Diego Padres, his favourite baseball team.\n\nThe Huntington Beach Surf City Surf Dog Event is free to attend this Saturday 28 September 2019.", "description": "What do you get when you cross California\u2019s official Surf City with a beach-load of excitable four-legged wave lovers?
