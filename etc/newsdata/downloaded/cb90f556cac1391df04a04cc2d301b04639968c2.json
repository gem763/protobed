Ottawa would have to pass legislation and negotiate federal transfers with the provinces and territories. Those provinces and territories would have to pass their own regulatory changes. A national drug agency and a formulary would have to be established before negotiations with drug manufacturers on prices could commence.\n\n\"If we believed as a council that you could implement pharmacare next year, we would have recommended it,\" said Hoskins.\n\nThe council suggested phasing in pharmacare over a period of eight years to allow all partners an opportunity to adjust along the way.\n\n\"My caution to the NDP would be, look, we've been waiting for pharmacare for more than 50 years,\" Hoskins said. \"The risks of getting it wrong are enormous when you are talking about people's access to prescribed medicines.\"\n\nSome measures to prepare for a pharmacare program were included in the Liberals' spring budget, including $35 million to work with the provinces, territories and stakeholders to create a Canadian Drug Agency over four years. This agency would create a national list of covered medications and deploy bulk purchasing to negotiate lower drug prices.\n\nGreen Party Leader Elizabeth May says her party's pharmacare plan is designed to give provinces and territories an \"incentive\" to come to the table. (Evan Mitsui/CBC)\n\nThe Green Party also has promised universal pharmacare and committed to spending $26.7 billion in the program's first year. It's the biggest single expense in the Green platform.\n\nThe platform says that by 2024-25, the Greens' plan would cost $31.3 billion, but by that point the provinces would be required to contribute $17 billion.\n\n\"The Green Party shares what I would describe as overly ambitious intent to start in 2020. Which I think is fraught with challenges, if not risk,\" Hoskins said.\n\nHoskins said the provinces and territories are now spending between $13 billion and $15 billion a year on drug coverage.\n\n\"They (Green Party) would assume the full cost of what is currently being paid by the provinces and territories toward prescribed medicines,\" he said. \"And that's not what we would recommend.\n\n\"The council felt that was unnecessary, that if the federal government simply were to pay the incremental costs, that would be what's important to the provinces and territories.\"\n\nContacted by CBC News, Green Leader Elizabeth May issued a statement saying she \"agreed\" with Hoskins' statement that the \"costs to provinces could have been deducted.\"\n\n\"But the PBO did not do this \u2014 and they explicitly noted so,\" she said. \"We did not change the PBO estimate even though we agree it is likely too high.\n\n\"However, we did assume contributions from the provinces and territories in years three and four, set at a level less than they are currently expected to pay under the status quo system ... By budgeting to cover years one and two entirely, we bring a large incentive to the table for the provinces and territories and buy ourselves some buffer time on negotiating their contributions.\"\n\nConservative Leader Andrew Scheer has not committed to a national pharmacare plan. Instead, Scheer has said the federal government should focus on filling in the gaps in the existing, largely private-sector drug coverage system.", "description": "The man tasked by Justin Trudeau's government with coming\u00a0up with a plan\u00a0for a national\u00a0pharmacare\u00a0program says the federal Liberals aren't pledging enough money in their election platform to make it happen.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5173204.1570472127!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/pharmacare-20190612.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
