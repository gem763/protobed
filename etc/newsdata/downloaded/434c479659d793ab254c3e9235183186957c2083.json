Firtash paid the lawyers $1 million to uncover dirt on Joe Biden and to win help in his legal case from Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, according to Bloomberg News.\n\nSolomon was the first to report on an affidavit obtained from Firtash by his lawyers, Toensing and diGenova, who are also Solomon\u2019s lawyers.\n\nThe lawyers\u2019 son, Brady, joined DOJ\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel in June as a senior counsel.\n\nThe privilege issue came up most recently in a New York court on Wednesday, when a lawyer for the recently indicted operative Lev Parnas said the White House might invoke executive privilege over evidence collected in the campaign finance investigation. That is because Giuliani was representing Parnas and Trump at the same time, said the lawyer, Edward MacMahon Jr.\n\n\u201cHe was working for Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Giuliani was working for the president of the United States,\u201d McMahon told the judge, U.S. District Court Judge Paul Oetken.\n\nSolomon, a former op-ed columnist and executive vice president for The Hill who recently left to launch his own outlet, has written extensively about Hunter Biden\u2019s activities in Ukraine and about Marie Yovanovitch, the veteran ambassador who was abruptly recalled in May amid a campaign by Trump\u2019s allies\u2014including Giuliani\u2014to remove her. DiGenova and Toensing have appeared frequently as guests on Hill TV.\n\nA series of articles Solomon published about Ukraine were mentioned in an anonymous complaint by an intelligence community whistleblower, which characterized Solomon\u2019s work as part of the \u201ccircumstances leading up to\u201d Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. In that call, Trump asked Zelensky to investigate the Bidens and \u201cget to the bottom of\u201d Ukraine\u2019s alleged interference in the 2016 election.\n\nSolomon, who is now a Fox News contributor, also featured in documents the State Department\u2019s Inspector General gave Congress earlier this month that revealed a campaign to smear Yovanovitch and the Bidens.\n\nIncluded in the roughly 50-page packet was an email from Solomon to Toensing, diGenova, and Parnas previewing an article he\u2019d written that was not yet published. The story claimed that the Obama administration had directed Ukrainian prosecutors to drop an investigation into a group \u201cco-funded by both the Obama administration and the liberal megadonor George Soros.\u201d\n\nAfter that email became public, Solomon claimed he was simply fact-checking the piece before it was published. But Toensing, diGenova, and Parnas are not mentioned in the article, raising the possibility that the trio, who had been working to find evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens in Ukraine, had been working directly with Solomon on the story.\n\nUkrainian interference in the 2016 election and corrupt pressure by the Obama administration on Ukrainian prosecutors are not the first unsubstantiated theories pushed by Toensing and diGenova that Solomon has advanced in his columns.\n\nSolomon also wrote extensively about the Uranium One controversy, which alleged a link between a 2010 sale of U.S. uranium supplies and donations to the Clinton Foundation.\n\nIn October 2017, Solomon was the first to report on an informant who accused former secretary of state Hillary Clinton of helping a Russian company improperly obtain uranium mining rights\u2014an informant being represented at the time by Toensing.\n\nIn 2017, then-attorney general Jeff Sessions appointed U.S. Attorney John Huber to look into the Uranium One matter under public pressure from President Trump, but he has yet to produce any findings.\n\nDiGenova\u2019s ties to William Barr, Sessions\u2019 successor as attorney general, go back years.\n\nIn a striking moment from one of his HillTV appearances, diGenova defended Barr\u2019s handling of the report by special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\n\u201cDon't you dare suggest that Bill Barr is a liar,\u201d told the host. \u201cI\u2019ve known him for 30 years. He's one of the finest lawyers this country has ever produced.\u201d\n\nDuring his first stint as attorney general, Barr tapped diGenova -- who was then a former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia -- as an independent counsel to review allegations that State Department officials improperly accessed Bill Clinton\u2019s passport records.\n\nIn 2017 Barr, before his return as Trump\u2019s attorney general, shared his view with New York Times reporter Peter Baker that \u201cthe predicate for investigating the uranium deal\u201d -- a reference to the Uranium One controversy promoted by diGenova and Toensing -- \u201cis far stronger than any basis for investigating so-called \u2018collusion.\u2019\u201d\n\nThose ties can apparently only take the lawyer pair so far, however. According to a recent account in the Washington Post, diGenova and Toensing met with Barr to discuss Firtash sometime after becoming his attorneys.\n\nBarr declined to intervene in the Firtash case, the Post reported.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/12/38/352c923042c399f3ecb8ed3cda2e/191024-john-solomon-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
