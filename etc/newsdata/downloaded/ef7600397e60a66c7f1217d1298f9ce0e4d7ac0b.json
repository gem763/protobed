Deakins insisted on all the low-wattage bulbs on one of the most famous bridges in the city being replaced because he needed more light. He went to great lengths to make sure the fake snow seen fleetingly from a hotel window fell over the city in just the right way.\n\nYou won\u2019t find many more picturesque films this year than The Goldfinch, but that hasn\u2019t helped it at the box office. \u201cThe Goldfinch bombs hard\u201d, \u201cone of the worst openings ever for Warner Bros\u201d, \u201cfaces losses of up to $50m (\u00a340m)\u201d and \u201cGoldfinch heads for crash landing\u201d were just some of the headlines that followed the film\u2019s US release, earlier this month.\n\nThe film, which has the backing of both Warner Bros and Amazon Studios, was released on over 2,500 screens, but after its opening weekend, posted revenues of only $2.6m on a reported budget of over $40m. Critics savaged it. It was, according to one reviewer, \u201ca lifeless film that doesn\u2019t consist of scenes so much as it does an awkward jumble of other, smaller problems stacked on top of each other like kids inside a trench coat\u201d. Another called it \u201cutterly flummoxing\u201d and \u201ccompletely fake\u201d, more like \u201ca Pinterest page or a piece of fan art\u201d than a proper movie.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nSuch animosity betrayed the disappointment that many felt about a title expected to be a surefire Oscar contender. It had a respected director, John Crowley, whose other credits include the excellent Brooklyn (2015). Nicole Kidman, normally a guarantor of quality, was in the cast, and the film also starred Ansel Elgort from Baby Driver and The Fault in Our Stars. You would have thought there was enough in the mix to appeal to older and younger cinephiles and literary fans alike.\n\nHowever, the film\u2019s commercial failure underlined a home truth that producers are loath to recognise \u2013 namely that literary bestsellers rarely make decent movies.\n\nFilmmakers have always been dependent on literature. From Harry Potter to James Bond, from It to Fifty Shades of Grey, books are behind most of Hollywood\u2019s biggest recent successes. Teen novels, literary romances, horror, dystopian sci-fi and gangster stories have all been successfully translated to the screen.\n\nAs the demand for content increases, links between publishing and the film industry are drawing yet closer. Every self-respecting film festival now has its own \u201cbook into films\u201d event at which big publishing houses and leading literary agents turn up to promote their authors to producers and distributors.\n\nNonetheless, this doesn\u2019t mean that those rarefied, multi-layered literary novels, with stream of consciousness narrative styles and stories that flit back and forth in time, lend themselves any easier to screen adaptation.\n\nScan down the winners of the Booker Prize over the last 30 years. One or two obvious exceptions apart (The English Patient, Schindler\u2019s Ark and The Remains of The Day), you won\u2019t find many that have been turned into memorable movies.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 35 great films that bombed at the box office Show all 35 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Rex Features\n\nThere are as many misses as hits when it comes to the movies of Ian McEwan novels: Atonement was an Oscar-winning hit but more recent adaptations like On Chesil Beach and The Children Act failed to replicate its box office success, while the screen versions of Martin Amis\u2019s work, such as The Rachel Papers, Dead Babies and London Fields, have generally turned out woefully.\n\nWhen was there last a decent film version of an Iris Murdoch novel? The 1970 film version of Murdoch\u2019s A Severed Head directed by Dick Clement (writer of The Likely Lads and Porridge) is one of the oddest, most absurd British movies of its era. The deeply eccentric drama stars Richard Attenborough as an unctuous, over-sexed psychiatrist, Claire Bloom as a Clytemnestra-like Oxbridge academic and middle-class, well-spoken London folk behaving as if they\u2019re on leave from a Greek tragedy.\n\nLikewise, AS Byatt\u2019s Booker prize-winner, Possession \u2013 which flitted between present-day academia and the Victorian literary world \u2013 was too rich and too densely layered to be boiled down into a 100-minute feature film. Trade paper Variety summed up the problems facing its filmmaker Neil LaBute when he tried to customise the book for the screen. \u201cDefies comprehensive cinematic adaptation. The book\u2019s most distinguishing quality, its wizardry with words and form, remains untranslatable.\u201d\n\nGenerally, the stronger the author\u2019s voice, the more difficult it is to adapt a novel for the screen. JD Salinger may have influenced the work of filmmakers from Wes Anderson to Woody Allen, but no one yet has made a decent movie from one of his books. Saul Bellow and John Updike were titans of 20th-century American literature but that didn\u2019t mean Hollywood paid much attention to them. Apart from The Witches of Eastwick (1987), which took considerable liberties with its source material, Updike\u2019s fiction spawned no major screen successes.\n\nRobin Williams gave one of his best non-comic performances as a struggling salesman whose life is coming apart in a 1986 adaptation of Bellow\u2019s novella, Seize the Day, but that remains one of the few screen adaptations from Bellow\u2019s work \u2013 and was made for TV anyway.\n\nThe 1992 made-for-TV version of Norman Mailer\u2019s The Executioner\u2019s Song, about the murderer Gary Gilmore, scripted by Mailer himself, seemed to buck the trend of literary novelists slipping up whenever they went anywhere near the screen. It boasted a searing performance in the central role from Tommy Lee Jones. The film, though, was based on a true story and had a clear narrative trajectory. It dealt with the final months in the life of its troubled anti-hero, in the lead up to his execution after the reinstalment of the death penalty in the US in 1976.\n\nRichard Brooks\u2019s 1967 adaptation of Truman Capote\u2019s \u201cnonfiction\u201d novel In Cold Blood (1967) likewise followed its two delinquent anti-heroes, the drifters who had murdered the Clutter family in Kansas, on their way to death row. It had a documentary-like quality that was easy to follow on-screen. Audiences didn\u2019t have to worry about unreliable narrators or interior monologues. Both films were reassuringly straightforward true crime stories, which have always been a staple of Hollywood storytelling.\n\nWhen literary novels do work on screen, it is generally because filmmakers treat them in a cavalier fashion. Blake Edwards\u2019s proudly superficial 1961 film of Capote\u2019s novella Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s offered glamour in abundance, Audrey Hepburn in Givenchy gowns and glittering jewellery and the wonderfully syrupy song, \u201cMoon River\u201d. It was the opposite of the heavyweight literary adaptation that takes itself very seriously.\n\nTartt\u2019s novel is over 700-pages long. It is a beautifully written meditation on grief, mother love, explosive coincidences and the enduring power of art, but The Godfather it isn\u2019t. You don\u2019t read it for the plot. The film adaptation begins promisingly and mysteriously with Theo Decker (played as a young adult by Elgort) in a hotel room in Amsterdam. We hear him in voiceover talking of a dream he had of the mother he lost. The story, though, soon begins to lurch in alarming fashion. One moment, it seems like a modern-day Dickensian tale of an abandoned boy making his way in an uncaring world. The next it turns into a half-hearted art heist thriller. Between times, characters listen to Beethoven and meditate on art, beauty and the impermanence of life.\n\nThe Goldfinch suffers from some of the same problems as the 2011 film adaptation of Jonathan Safran Foer\u2019s novel Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close, about a boy struggling to cope with his father\u2019s death during the 11 September attacks in New York. The films were caught between the desire to remain faithful to their source material, while also trying to make their stories accessible to a big mainstream audience. In both cases, it might have been wiser either to have made the films as more intimate, lower budget art-house dramas or have gone down the mini-series route. The box office failure of The Goldfinch follows on from that of Ewan McGregor\u2019s 2016 screen adaptation of Philip Roth\u2019s American Pastoral, another prize-winning novel that just didn\u2019t click at the box office.\n\nHollywood is bound to continue making heavyweight literary adaptations. Film versions of Booker or Pulitzer Prize winners have a cultural prestige already behind them that can be leveraged when it comes to awards recognition. Actors are far more likely to get Oscar nominations for appearing in screen versions of Cold Mountain and The Reader than they are for taking roles in Dumb and Dumber and The Hangover. That, though, doesn\u2019t mean the films will work out well.\n\nThere is a famous letter that Salinger wrote in 1953 to an admirer, Hubert Cornfield, who wanted to make a movie adaptation of The Catcher in the Rye. \u201cI see my novel as a novel and only as a novel,\u201d Salinger told Cornfield. \u201cShould I change my mind in the future \u2013 which is extremely doubtful \u2013 I very probably would take on any casting and directing chores myself. Thank you for your interest but please take this as absolutely final.\u201d Sixty-six years later, Salinger\u2019s decision seems more sensible than ever.\n\n\u2018The Goldfinch\u2019 is released in the UK this week", "description": "When renowned cinematographer Roger Deakins was shooting new movie The Goldfinch (adapted from Donna Tartt\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel) in Amsterdam, the Dutch crew was astounded by his extreme perfectionism and attention to the minutest detail.
