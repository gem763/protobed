The meeting comes on the heels of the president\u2019s recent Twitter attacks on the company and its CEO. On Friday, the president tweeted the following:\n\nGeneral Motors, which was once the Giant of Detroit, is now one of the smallest auto manufacturers there. They moved major plants to China, BEFORE I CAME INTO OFFICE. This was done despite the saving help given them by the USA. Now they should start moving back to America again? \u2014 Donald J.

Despite beating expectations on both the top and bottom lines, investors were spooked by Slack\u2019s admission that sales growth would decelerate during the second half of this year.\n\nOne of the main concerns surrounding Slack is the competition from companies like Microsoft (MSFT).\n\n\u201cThis increased focus from Microsoft and the compelling traction seen in their Teams solution, combined with a deceleration in billings growth over the last couple of quarters vs. FY19, has investors asking the question, \u2018Can Slack succeed given this level of competition from Microsoft?\u2019 We believe the answer is still \u2018Yes,\u2019\u201d Credit Suisse wrote in a note Thursday.\n\nECON: U.S. private sector job gains beat expectations\n\nJob growth in the U.S. private sector was better than economists\u2019 expectations in August, according to a new report from ADP Research Institute and Moody\u2019s. The U.S. private sector added 195,000 positions in August, higher than the 148,000 positions Wall Street was predicting.\n\nJuly\u2019s figure was revised down to 142,000, from the 156,000 positions that was initially reported.\n\n\u201cIn August we saw a rebound in private-sector employment,\u201d Ahu Yildirmaz, vice president and co-head of the ADP Research Institute said in a statement. \u201cThis is the first time in the last 12 months that we have seen balanced job growth across small, medium and large-sized companies.\u201d\n\nMark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics, added, \u201cBusinesses are holding firm on their payrolls despite the slowing economy. Hiring has moderated, but layoffs remain low. As long as this continues recession will remain at bay.\u201d\n\nThough the ADP report is not always a reliable indicator of what the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) report will illustrate, it does provide a bit of insight into the health of employment in the U.S.", "description": "Stocks surged Thursday after positive U.S.-China trade developments pumped optimism back into the markets.", "authors": ["Heidi Chung"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_C7xKNsv3Atw42NubXf8.A--~B/aD0zMDU5O3c9NDU4OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/47d558b0-cfe7-11e9-bdff-f9eb6d54e470", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
