Of course, you can experiment with the whole nine yards of sheer elegance, by adding your own individual contemporary twists. This Diwali, you can stay off the beaten track by going for a variety of modern sari draping styles. Still feel confused? Here are some tips from celebrity sari draping artiste Dolly Jain to help you stand out from the crowd.\n\nThis particular draping style is suitable for all body types. Basically, you need to drape a sari in such a way that the lower portion looks like a skirt - just make two pleats in the front. For the mermaid draping style, pick a sari with a heavily embroidered pallu and embellished borders.\n\nYou heard it right. You can wear a sari with a dupatta as well! Jain says that a dupatta drape adds a lot of drama. So, how do you add the dupatta? Wear your sari in the conventional fashion, and tuck one end of the dupatta on the right side of your waist. Then pull it from under your left arm and throw it over your right shoulder like a pallu.\n\nThis can be an ideal Indo-Western look for Diwali. Get a pair of jeggings, a crop top and a pair of high heels. Start by pleating one end of the sari, as you would normally want to drape it, pinning it up and tucking it into your pants at the centre and then the other end can be draped as a chunni across the shoulders. You are now set to turn some heads!\n\n\n\nPhotos: Instagram\n\n", "description": "If you want to try something new with sari draping this Diwali, these tips will come in handy.
