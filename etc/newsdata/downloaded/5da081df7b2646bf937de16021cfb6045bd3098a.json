Last week, the CDC recorded 530 cases of vaping-related lung disease in total across 46 states, but that number jumped 52 percent to 805 cases by Sept. 24. While the majority of sufferers have eventually been released from the hospital, the respiratory illness has now been linked to 13 deaths.\n\nIn an attempt to seek answers, NBC News decided to do its own investigation into the possible contaminants found in vaping cartridges. NBC tapped the accredited THC testing facility, CanaSafe, and provided them with a small sample of THC vape cartridges \u2014 18 in total \u2014 obtained from both legal distributors and unlicensed, black market dealers.\n\nTesting the vaping cartridges from both sources yielded some \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d results, according to NBC News. The three from legal dispensaries in California were all free from pesticides, heavy metals, and vitamin E acetate (which New York State is currently investigating as one possible cause of the vaping-related lung damage seen across the U.S.). But the black market cartridges contained several contaminants \u2014 namely, pesticides (10 out of 10 cartridges tested came up positive) and vitamin E (in 13 out of 15 black-market cartridges).\n\nWhat\u2019s more concerning: The lab found that all of the black market cartridges contained myclobutanil, \u201ca fungicide that can turn into hydrogen cyanide when burned,\u201d according to NBC News. A California teen was recently put in a medically-induced coma for nine days after using a marijuana vape pen reportedly laced with hydrogen cyanide.\n\n\u201cThere is extensive literature on the adverse health effects of inhaling pesticides and fungicides,\u201d Ilona Jaspers, PhD, deputy director of the Center for Environmental Medicine, Asthma, and Lung Biology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cModifying these compounds through thermal oxidation, which is what would occur during the vaping process, could generate additional reaction products that would be harmful to the lungs.\u201d\n\nWhile the results are noteworthy, some experts are concerned about news outlets conducting their own testing.\n\n\u201cI am concerned that news organizations are hiring laboratories to do their own testing, especially if these labs are not independent, GLP-certified labs that do not have an obvious conflict of interest,\u201d Jaspers tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cCanaSafe does appear to be a California-accredited cannabis testing lab, which is reassuring. However, while I am all for having additional independent data on this issue, I am worried that this could confuse the work that is currently being done by federal and state agencies.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, while investigations continue, the CDC and the FDA are urging people to stop vaping. \u201cWe have absolutely no idea what the long-term consequences are of vaping either THC, CBD, or nicotine-containing products,\u201d says Jaspers. \u201cNone of these have been rigorously tested for long-term safety.\u201d\n\nShe adds: \u201cI would recommend stopping immediately.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "NBC News hired a lab to test THC vaping pens from both legal distributors and black market sources.
