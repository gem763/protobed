The pace of the rollout will depend on how quickly Whole Foods is able to install it and train employees on how to use it, sources said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t comment on rumors or speculation,\u201d an Amazon spokesperson said.\n\nWhile a regular card transaction typically takes between three and four seconds, Amazon\u2019s new technology can process the charge in less than 300 milliseconds, a person familiar with the project said.\n\n\u201cRetailers have always been interested in faster checkout,\u201d Majd Maksad, founder and CEO of Status Money, a personal finance site, told The Post. \u201cYou only have to walk into Whole Foods to see the massive lines of people waiting to check out. It\u2019s a massive friction point.\u201d\n\nIf successful, the technology also could help encourage consumers to spend more when they visit Whole Foods, he said.\n\n\u201cPeople tend to spend more when they don\u2019t have the experience of touching something tangible like money,\u201d Maksad said. \u201cThe utility of money becomes more ephemeral.\u201d\n\nAt Amazon\u2019s budding chain of \u201cGo\u201d convenience stores that launched last year, customers use a phone app to check in at a turnstile. They can then fill their bags and carry them out without ever passing a register thanks to computer vision and an array of sensors all over the store.\n\nWith the new, hand-based tech, shoppers won\u2019t even have to bring their phones. Nevertheless, experts say it\u2019s unclear whether customers will be enthusiastic about scanning their hands at Whole Foods.\n\nStephanie Hare, an independent researcher who specializes in technology ethics, noted that countries with robust surveillance programs like China already use biometric checkouts in some stores and noted that Amazon appears to have made a decision to not use facial recognition.\n\n\u201cI think they probably made a judgment call that Americans are probably not going to want to pay with their face, but they\u2019ll be fine to pay with their fingerprint or their hand,\u201d she said. \u201cThat feels less like a mug shot.\u201d\n\nConsumers should avoid giving up their biometric data, Hare says, pointing out that, if a company gets hacked, it can take six or more years for consumers to unwind the data theft.\n\n\u201cWhy would you give them that data? People don\u2019t understand the risk, and they\u2019re oversold the benefits,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have a couple of nation states that are really good at stealing data right now.\u201d\n\nThis story originally appeared in the New York Post.", "description": "Forget the titanium Apple Card \u2014 Amazon\u2019s latest payment method uses flesh and blood.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/05/WholeFoodsIstockl.png"}
