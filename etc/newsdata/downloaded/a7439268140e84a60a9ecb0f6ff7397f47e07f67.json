Here's how to stay on top of your game and get to that final job offer.\n\nAsk the right questions\n\nThere's one question you can pretty much guarantee a job interviewer is going to ask: Do you have any questions for me?\n\nHere's your time to shine.\n\nYou should come prepared with insightful questions to learn more about the role and to make sure the company is a good fit.\n\nAsking astute questions shows engagement and tells an interviewer you are listening and genuinely interested in the position.\n\nSneaking away for job interviews\n\nJob hunting while employed can feel a bit like cheating -- sneaking away to take phone calls, coming up with excuses to go on interviews.\n\nJob hunting at your current place of employment is a no-no since employers can review activity done on company-issued devices. So how do you pull it off?\n\nFor starters, set boundaries. Job hunting can take over your life, so it helps to designate a specific time.\n\nSigning off at your old job\n\nCongratulations! You successfully interviewed and landed a new job. Now you have to resign from your current position.\n\nWhere do you start? Your boss.\n\nYour immediate supervisor should be the first person you tell about your decision to leave the company. Even if you don't get along with your boss and they're the reason you sought a new job, make that your first stop.\n\nWhen it comes to divulging information about your new gig, experts advise keeping it very top level -- if you can.\n\nNew hires: Don't do this\n\nThe job market is so good that some new hires are flaking on their employers before they even start\n\nSome candidates are getting multiple job offers and don't show up on their start dates, without giving the employers a heads up.\n\nNo-show hires are expensive for employers: they have to start the interview process over and it can take a toll on employee morale.\n\nBut deserters beware: The job market it won't always be this good. So protect your brand and avoid burning bridges.", "description": "It's still a worker's job market.
