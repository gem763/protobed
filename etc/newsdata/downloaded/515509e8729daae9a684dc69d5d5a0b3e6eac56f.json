(Photo: Sophie Giraud, Hulu)\n\nThe story of Gilead will continue. Hulu and MGM have signed on to adapt Margaret Atwood\u2019s The Testaments, the upcoming sequel to The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, a fresh look at life both in and out of Gilead that stars two new protagonists... along with a very familiar face.\n\nFirst reported by Time and confirmed by Gizmodo, American streaming service Hulu and MGM Television are currently working on plans to adapt The Testaments, with The Handmaid\u2019s Tale showrunner Bruce Miller involved in talks about how to do so.\n\nWe reached out to Hulu on whether this will be rolled into the existing series, or developed as its own show or perhaps even a theatrical film, here\u2019s what they had to say:\n\nMGM and Hulu are currently in discussions with Handmaid\u2019s showrunner Bruce Miller about how the upcoming novel can become an important extension to the immensely popular award-winning series The Handmaids Tale. The Testaments picks up fifteen years after the original Handmaid\u2019s Tale novel.\n\nThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale, which recently finished its third season and has already been renewed for a fourth one and Hulu pointed out this will be the \u201cthird collaboration between Atwood and MGM Television.\u201d\n\nIt seems possible (even likely) that The Testaments could be added to the existing series, given how the timeline and characters could improve the series, which has started to stagnate.\n\nThe third season ended on a pretty strange note, with June (Elisabeth Moss) succeeding in getting dozens of kids out of Gilead, while still being stuck there. It\u2019s hard to tell where things could even go from here, or how long the show can justify keeping June in Gilead. Even Atwood agreed that June\u2019s time in Gilead is running its course.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t keep Offred in Gilead for many more seasons, or a certain amount of wheel spinning will be going on,\u201d the author told Time. \u201cThey have to move her along \u2014 and I\u2019ve given them lots of ways of how that would happen.\u201d\n\nIf they brought the sequel into The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, changing it from June\u2019s story to these new protagonists, the wheel could turn more efficiently. The Testaments takes place 15 years after the events of the first book, which ended (much like the first season of the show) with Offred boarding a mysterious van to destinations unknown, which means she\u2019s no longer a first-person protagonist.\n\nInstead, the story is being shared by three women. According to Time, two of them are new characters \u2014 a young women raised in Gilead and a Canadian teenager \u201cwho learns she was actually born there\u201d \u2014 and one of them is eerily familiar. It\u2019s Aunt Lydia.\n\nAnn Dowd, who plays the terrifying but complex character on The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, has reprised her role for the audiobook of The Testaments, joining Bryce Dallas Howard and Mae Whitman as the protagonists of the sequel.\n\nHulu wouldn\u2019t confirm whether Dowd would continue as Aunt Lydia in The Testaments, no matter what form the adaptation takes, but Dowd did tell Time that she hopes to see the story from The Testaments brought into The Handmaid\u2019s Tale... as it provides even more context and complexity for the character than we got in her season three backstory.\n\nEither way, she said this new insight into the character will definitely inform her performance.\n\n\u201cIt gives a clear indication from the creator of this story of where she will end up and what will happen \u2014 and that affects the approach, in terms of where her mind is going,\u201d Dowd said. \u201cShe\u2019s very savvy, very much a player and knows the politics. She\u2019s always thinking, always planning, always assessing. In the end of the last season, you know we\u2019re in trouble, because how many of those young girls got out? That is a massive, massive catastrophe. And the fact that Lydia was not onto it in a meaningful way, she\u2019s got some work to do.\u201d\n\nThe Testaments book comes out on September 10, with the audiobook debuting the same day. We\u2019ll bring you more on the adaptation as we know it.", "description": "The story of Gilead will continue.
