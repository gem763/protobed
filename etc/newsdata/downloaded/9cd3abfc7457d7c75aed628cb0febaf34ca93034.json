Stem cells are a basic type of cell that can change into another type of more specialised cell through a process known as differentiation. Think of stem cells as a fresh ball of clay that can be shaped and morphed into any cell in the body - including bone, muscle, skin and more. This ability means they have been the focus of lots of medical research in recent decades. They grow in embryos as embryonic stem cells, helping the rapidly growing infant form the millions of different cell types it needs to build before birth. In adults they are used as repair cells, replacing those we lose through damage or ageing.\n\n'In my experience with clinical trials and evaluating dogs with debilitating arthritis, I've seen first-hand how cell therapy can change lives,' said Dr. Linda Black, Chief Scientific Officer at Gallant. 'I'm committed to developing therapies that dramatically improve the quality of life for dogs.'\n\nMore than 1 million pets are spayed or neutered each month, and the American Pet Products Association estimates that pet owners will spend $18.9 billion on vet care in 2019.\n\nRegenerative medicine is often more cost effective than traditional treatments such as surgeries, which can cost thousands of dollars.", "description": "California-based Gallant has opened the doors to the first stem cell bank for dogs.
