There\u2019s businesses that rely on passing trade.\u201d\n\nIt sits on the dwindling lower Darling River, about 100 kilometres south of Menindee. Menindee has become a symbol of the dire state of the river system, after millions of dead fish washed up over summer.\n\nPooncarie\u2019s drinking water comes from a bore, but raw water for toilets and outdoor use has been trucked in by the Wentworth Shire council since September.\n\nThe only thing as certain as drought in Australia is the stupid call to build new dams | Maryanne Slattery Read more\n\nThe council says that with little to no rainfall over winter, the \u201czero flow\u201d river conditions will linger.\n\nVisitors are curious to see a drying river first hand.\n\n\u201cUntil you see it yourself, you wouldn\u2019t believe what it looks like. It\u2019s generally a pretty little town, but everything is dying off,\u201d Sheard says.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A tinnie sits high and dry in the river bed of the Darling River on sheep farmer Wayne Smith\u2019s property near Pooncarie, 14 February 2019.

Kids [usually] use the river in summer, but you can\u2019t swim there now.\u201d\n\n\n\nNyngan is one of many towns serviced by Burrendong dam, which is on the Macquarie River and is sitting at below 5%.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Burrendong dam (water supply for Dubbo), 30 kilometres south-east of Wellington. As of 9 September, capacity was 4.5%. Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian\n\nThe Bogan shire mayor, Ray Donald, says Nyngan and surrounding villages have been assured of water supplies from the river until at least the middle of 2020.\n\nWater authorities are raising the Warren weir to divert flows, and the town will have access to deep water storage pumped from the dam.\n\nThe council is also exploring potential bore sites for underground water.\n\nThe shire is on level 3 water restrictions, which mean residents can only use water outdoors during certain hours.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a situation that hasn\u2019t occurred before, so we\u2019re going into uncharted territory and it\u2019s very stressful,\u201d Donald said. \u201cBut if [the worst case scenario] does happen, it\u2019s not going to happen next week.\u201d\n\nFive hours east of Nyngan sits Tamworth, a regional city home to more than 60,000 people.\n\nTamworth\u2019s Chaffey dam is below 20% and residents are urged to use no more than 150 litres of water per person per day.\n\nLevel five water restrictions ban lawn and garden watering, and the council suggests residents take short showers, and use washing machines for full loads only.\n\nElva Shumack, from the Country Women\u2019s Association, says only one previous drought rivals this one.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Elva Shumack waters the plants in her Tamworth garden with greywater. Photograph: Steve Gonslaves Photographics/The Guardian\n\nThe 80-year-old can still picture the Macdonald River running dry on her family farm near Tamworth in the 1940s.\n\nToday, she says the view from her window in town is depressing.\n\n\u201cTrees in the streets are starting to die. If you look up on the skyline, you can see through trees that you could never see through before.\u201d\n\nShumack says neighbours are having to let go of their gardens, an important part of country living.\n\n\u201cI find they\u2019re a bit of joy in your life. It\u2019s civilised living if you\u2019ve got a bit of a garden.\u201d\n\nBut, she says brightly, her lavender is surviving surprisingly well on reused washing water.\n\nTamworth regional council has assured residents the city \u201cwill not have a day zero\u201d.\n\nIt points to temporary weirs being built on the Peel River and the construction of a pipeline linking Chaffey dam to the smaller Dungowan dam.\n\nTamworth\u2019s famed country music festival will go ahead in January. Council data shows there is not a significant impact on water consumption during the 10-day event, as some locals leave to rent out their houses to visitors.\n\nThe city hopes the usual crowd of 50,000 people per day will flock in and add $50 million to the economy. Locals say that support is needed more than ever.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely, we\u2019re telling people \u2018please come\u2019,\u201d a council spokeswoman says.\n\nIn other large regional centres identified as \u201chigh risk\u201d, local governments are trying to calm fears about water.\n\nOrange, in the central west, relies on a number of dams, creeks, and a pipeline to the Macquarie River.\n\nThe city\u2019s total storage has fallen to 30%. Level five water restrictions ban most outdoor water use, and authorities implore people to take three minute showers, and one shallow bath per household per day.\n\nA stormwater harvesting system, which collects rain from roads, car parks and roofs, adds water to the supply when potential run-off is lost to parched paddocks.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A drought-affected paddock on the outskirts of Dubbo, Australia in September.

Dubbo will tap into bore water if the Macquarie River stops flowing next year.\n\nIt is looking into stormwater harvesting, and recycled water.\n\nResidents will move onto tough level four restrictions in November for the first time in the city\u2019s history, but they\u2019ve been warned households are still using too much water.\n\n\u201cDubbo regional council would like to think this is the beginning of a behavioural change period for our community that will serve us well into the future,\u201d the council says.\n\nAfter eight decades of rural living, Shumack sees the persistent drought as one of many challenges for people in regional areas.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s not drought, it\u2019s probably floods, or fires, or a price slump in the livestock market, or there\u2019s health issues if you can\u2019t get to a good hospital.\n\n\u201cAll these things need steadfast perseverance and resilience.\u201d", "description": "After water restrictions and emergency infrastructure, the final drought strategy is sheer perseverance", "authors": ["Stephanie Gardiner"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8dbd2a7ffaf19cf6b56942423562c282b2750be/283_0_4872_2923/master/4872.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6021af887a56dec041998028fa592f42", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
