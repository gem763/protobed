But it wasn\u2019t clear until Friday that roughly $1 million of that ad buy would be concentrated in Iowa, South Carolina, New Hampshire, and Nevada, in a naked attempt to prevent Biden from securing the Democratic nomination.\n\n\u201cVoters should know about the self-dealing, influence-peddling Bidens as the campaign season progresses,\u201d Tim Murtaugh, a Trump 2020 spokesman, told Politico Friday.\n\nThe Biden campaign had already made a $6 million ad buy in those same states with the aim of countering Trump\u2019s Ukraine allegations. But if this exchange of fire turns into ad war of attrition, the former vice-president could be in trouble: In the third quarter of this year, Trump\u2019s campaign and the Republican National Committee collectively raised $125 million; Biden, meanwhile, raised a mere $15 million (which was considerably less than the socialist candidate and mayor of South Bend had each mustered).\n\nNone of this seems ideal for a candidate who was already losing ground to Elizabeth Warren before his son\u2019s legal (but shady) employment on the board of a Ukrainian gas company became a fixture in the headlines. Polls suggest that Democratic primary voters prize \u201celectability\u201d in their nominee above all else. And the former vice-president\u2019s strong showing in surveys of a hypothetical Trump-Biden election had helped to give his candidacy an aura of safety. But Biden\u2019s egregious ineloquence at the first Democratic debates put a dent in that aura. Now, Trump\u2019s ad campaign threatens to persuade Democrats in early states that nominating Biden would, in fact, mean reliving \u201cbut her emails\u201d all over again.\n\nOn the other hand, it\u2019s hard to imagine stronger evidence for the claim \u201cDonald Trump is more afraid of facing Biden than any other candidate\u201d than the Trump campaign taking out a multimillion-dollar ad buy aimed at sparing the president the hassle of facing Biden. Thus, it\u2019s conceivable that Uncle Joe can use the president\u2019s ad blitz (and monstrous abuse of power) to his own benefit.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is interfering in our party\u2019s primary election to destroy my campaign with proven lies. Are you going to let him win?\u201d seems like a potent message (if Biden can deliver it without going off on a tangent about phonographs, or the time Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in the late 1970s, anyway).", "description": "The Trump campaign will air $1 million worth of Ukraine-themed, anti-Biden ads in the early primary states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina, in a naked bid to prevent Joe Biden from winning the Democratic nomination.", "authors": ["Eric Levitz"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/04/04-trump-biden-ad.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
