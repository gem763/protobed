Analysis of a 74-year-old A. sligoi specimen that once lived at London Zoo revealed its distinct genetic code and it is this species that is thought to be the largest of the three.\n\nSixteen other specimens collected in the early 20th century were also examined.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing in this day and age that it took until now to work out what the world\u2019s largest amphibian is,\u201d the study\u2019s lead author Samuel Turvey, a conservation scientist at ZSL, told National Geographic.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Habitat loss and poaching also pose severe threats.\n\nWhile millions are now kept on farms, these appear to overwhelmingly be members of the most common species, while wild populations are at great risk of extinction.\n\n\u201cThese findings come at a time where urgent interventions are required to save Chinese giant salamanders in the wild,\u201d said Melissa Marr, a PhD researcher at the Natural History Museum.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Zookeepers hope to one day introduce another animal to Professor Lew as a mate.\n\nScientists believe that in light of the recent study, published on Monday in Ecology and Evolution, future conservation efforts could involve screening farmed giant salamanders to determine their species before encouraging them to mate and reintroducing them into the wild among their own species.\n\nDr Turvey added: \u201cWe hope that this new understanding of their species diversity has arrived in time to support their successful conservation, but urgent measures are required to protect any viable giant salamander populations that might remain.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by PA", "description": "Scientists have discovered a new species of giant salamander, believed to be the world\u2019s largest amphibian.
