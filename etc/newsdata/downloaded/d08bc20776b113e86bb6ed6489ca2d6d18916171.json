If you left a message, chances were good you\u2019d get a return call the same day.\n\nIn those days, when a contractor or service tech told you they\u2019d show up between 2 and 3, it was better than even odds they\u2019d be there.\n\nI can remember when a doctor\u2019s or dentist\u2019s appointment for 10 am meant you were in the exam room by 10:05 instead of cooling your jets in a crowded waiting room.\n\nI\u2019m even old enough to remember when you could buy a major appliance and count on it lasting five years or more.\n\nOh, the good old days. What\u2019s happened?\n\nNow a machine answers the phone, runs you through a huge number of menu options, offers no chance to speak with a real human, and often no chance to leave a message. Even when you do leave a message, you often never hear back.\n\nNow, we\u2019re given a 4 to 7 hour window when to expect someone and very often they still don\u2019t show when they\u2019re supposed to.\n\nIn today\u2019s world we all know the doctor or dentist will very often keep you waiting 30 minutes or more and never offer an apology.\n\nAnd that South Korean fridge with the $2,000 price tag\u2026 within 2 years you can expect to pay some repairman a huge fee to tell you it\u2019s a piece of junk he wouldn\u2019t be caught dead owning.\n\nIf any of this sounds familiar, welcome to the year 2019. You can be sure it will get worse before it gets better.\n\nTwo articles recently in the Wall Street Journal make the point.\n\nThe first explains how businesses track rude or complaining customers. The fact they even do so suggests they know their service will cause trouble and rather than improve it, they punish you for being secure enough to complain about it.\n\nAnd nevermind their service gives you a \u201cmad as hell, not going to take it anymore\u201d attitude. They insist you be nice to the incompetent it\u2019s taken you 30 minutes or more to get on the phone.\n\nThe second article talks about a scoring system many businesses use to rank their customers. Spend enough money, and even though you\u2019re regularly grumpy, you get high-end treatment. Don\u2019t spend enough, and even infrequent grumpiness goes unexcused. You\u2019ll end up in voicemail hell where you\u2019ll be asked to press one to take a short survey about your customer service experience. Beware when pressing the 1 that starts the survey? Oops, you get disconnected.\n\nI suppose it\u2019s hard to blame them. These days people seem more rude, quarrelsome, difficult, and mannerless than ever before.\n\nOn the other hand, people have more reason to be frustrated than they\u2019ve ever had before. Sales clerks often couldn\u2019t care less. Very few days go by I don\u2019t receive 10 or more robo calls from someone trying to sell me something I don\u2019t need or want. Banks, credit card companies, and online retailers are regularly giving notice they\u2019ve been hacked and your private information has been compromised.\n\nLet\u2019s be honest. Much of what passes for customer service cannot by any honest reckoning of the language be called service. And many of the products these days move from home, to garage, to yard sale in record time.\n\nWhen I find a company that thinks they\u2019re doing me a favor when I buy their products, or penalize me for attempting to solve a problem by calling them, I simply stop doing business with that company. They don\u2019t deserve my money, and I try to make sure they know why they\u2019re losing a really good customer.\n\nDon\u2019t reward bad service with good money; trust me, it won\u2019t get better with a second chance.", "description": "It wasn\u2019t all that long ago you called a business .09/02/2019 3:19:14AM EST.", "authors": ["John Philip Sousa Iv", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2016/46/2b6f4631-7133-412f-8a50-309f8c21756b.jpg"}
