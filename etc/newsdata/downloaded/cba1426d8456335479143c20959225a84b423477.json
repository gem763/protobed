Amateur footage is available (5:00 in).\n\nWhen Neil Young released his anthemic track \u201cRockin\u2019 in the Free World\u201d off 1989\u2019s Freedom, the song quickly became a rallying cry in post-Reagan America for \u201cAmerican values\u201d and the fall of communism. With George H. W. Bush still settling into his presidency, Young criticized the president\u2019s ideology, specifically referencing Bush\u2019s \u201cthousand points of light\u201d comment and blasting Republicans for what he felt was a disregard toward the lower-class.\n\nMore than 25 years later, Republican Donald Trump, announcing his run for president Tuesday at Trump Tower, used the track as part of his kickoff, sparking condemnation from the rocker.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump was not authorized to use \u2018Rockin\u2019 in the Free World\u2019 in his presidential candidacy announcement,\u201d a spokesperson for the rocker\u2019s Lookout Management said in a statement. \u201cNeil Young, a Canadian citizen, is a supporter of Bernie Sanders for President of the United States of America.\u201d\n\nWhen reached for comment, a spokesperson for the Trump campaign told Rolling Stone that the candidate was a fan of Young\u2019s music, despite their differing views, and that the track was used legally. \u201cThrough a license agreement with [performance-rights organization] ASCAP, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign paid for and obtained the legal right to use Neil Young\u2019s recording of \u2018Rockin\u2019 in the Free World\u2019 at today\u2019s event,\u201d the spokesperson tells Rolling Stone. \u201cMr. Trump is a huge fan of Neil Young and his music and will continue to be regardless of Neil\u2019s political views.\u201d\n\nAccording to an ASCAP document called \u201cUsing Music in Political Campaigns,\u201d for a song to be used properly, \u201cthe campaign will need to contact the song\u2019s publisher and possibly the artist\u2019s record label to negotiate the appropriate licenses with them.\u201d It\u2019s unclear whether the Trump campaign contacted Young, his management company or record label to use the track. (Editor\u2019s Note: As The Hollywood Reporter notes, that usage applies only to the use of a song in a campaign ad. A representative for ASCAP declined to comment when asked for details about the case.)\n\nYoung shares a co-writing credit on \u201cRockin\u2019 in the Free World\u201d with Crazy Horse guitarist Frank \u201cPoncho\u201d Sampedro through Young\u2019s Silver Fiddle Music and Sampedro\u2019s Poncho Villa Music, according to ASCAP.\n\nASCAP addresses artists\u2019 legal rights and criticisms in their document on political campaigns under the question, \u201cCan the campaign still be criticized or even sued by an artist for playing his or her song at an event?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. If an artist does not want his or her music to be associated with the campaign, he or she may be able to legal action even if the campaign has the appropriate copyright licenses,\u201d ASCAP says. \u201cWhile the campaign would be in compliance with copyright law, it could potentially be in violation of other laws, including \u201cRight of Publicity\u201d and \u201cFalse Endorsement.\u201d\n\nThe use of Young\u2019s song is just the latest in a perpetual controversy that comes around every presidential cycle, with politically minded artists coming out against specific campaigns and parties. In 2012, Mitt Romney used Silversun Pickups\u2019 \u201cPanic Switch\u201d at at least one event, causing the band to issue a letter through their lawyer refuting any endorsement of the candidate. Four years earlier, after Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin used Heart\u2019s \u201cBarracuda\u201d during her campaign, the band issued a statement noting that they \u201cdid not and would not authorize the use of their song at the RNC.\u201d\n\nMore recently, Massachusetts punks Dropkick Murphys tweeted at Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker asking him to stop using their song \u201cI\u2019m Shipping Up to Boston.\u201d \u201cPlease stop using our music in any way,\u201d the band wrote on Twitter. \u201cWe literally hate you!!!\u201d\n\nIronically, this is not the first time Trump and Young have crossed paths inside the the politics-music venn diagram. In 2006, Trump attended a Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young show at the Theater at Madison Square Garden during the group\u2019s Freedom of Speech tour. At one point, Trump and author Salman Rushdie stood up and sung along to the 2006 song \u201cLet\u2019s Impeach the President,\u201d written and produced by Young.", "description": "Music, Film, TV and Political News Coverage", "authors": ["Jason Newman", "News Director", "Jason Newman'S Most Recent Stories", "Future", "Pharrell Williams", "Artist", "Festival Founder", "Former Aeg Exec Adam Lublin Charged With Second Sexual Abuse", "Peter Fonda", "Easy Rider"], "top_image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rs-199880-GettyImages-471203294.jpg", "published_at": "2015-06-17"}
