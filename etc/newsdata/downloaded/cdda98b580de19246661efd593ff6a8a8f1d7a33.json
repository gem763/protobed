It uses 3D printing for custom fitted headphones ... they send off the scan and get your earphones that afternoon ... then they can move down to teeth and other body parts.\"", "description": "Melbourne billionaire Paul Little is ramping-up his switch from investing in property to early stage start-ups because he sees a big gap in the market.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4112%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_215%2C$y_92/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/5581849fd3e212ce7a879b711e419f8efd8882c9", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
