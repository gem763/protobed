a fresh, lively and elegant cuvee that serves the dish beautifully.'\n\nMs Leong was excited to try the mushroom crostata - a traditional Italian tart - (right) curated by executive chef Josh Smith-Thirkell in Canberra\n\nAPPLE CRUMBLE\n\nIn the dessert category chef Andy Harmer pulled off a a souffl\u00e9 in a 'great apple crumble' in Melbourne.\n\n'Featuring local St David Dairy's luscious cream, the dessert alone is spectacular, but when paired with the very extravagant Belle Epoque 2006, it's a whole other ballgame,' she said.\n\n'It's a sophisticated glass of red fruit, pomegranate and apricot, and the combined textures harmonise beautifully.\n\n'The fact that this isn't an overly sweet dessert means that the elegance of the Champagne isn't lost\u2026and as one of the rarer bottles of Perrier-Jou\u00ebt you're likely to find, the last thing you'd want is not to taste it properly.'\n\nIn the dessert category chef Andy Harmer pulled off a a souffl\u00e9 in a 'great apple crumble' in Melbourne\n\n'Featuring local St David Dairy's luscious cream, the dessert alone is spectacular, but when paired with the very extravagant Belle Epoque 2006, it's a whole other ballgame,' she said\n\nMARRON\n\nIn homage to all things Western Australia Ms Leong was given marron to try while dining in Perth with chef Nic Wood.\n\nDescribing them as her 'favourite crustaceans to eat in the state' the self-confessed foodie enjoyed the seafood 'simply'.\n\n'Nic quickly kissed the Marron on the wood grill, then topped it with vibrant tomatoes, quickly smoked, as well as basil and lemon butter,' she said.\n\n'Smoke can really kill Champagne, so it's a show of skill to produce a dish that respects the bubbles, while showcasing such spectacular Western Australian produce.\n\n'Marron being freshwater and not saltwater, means the delicate flavours pair beautifully with the mineral-driven, floral and very, very energetic Blanc de Blanc.'\n\nYou can watch the mini series on the QT Hotels website here.", "description": "Masterchef judge Melissa Leong has travelled around Australia to decipher which Champagnes should be paired with which top-quality dishes.", "authors": ["Matilda Rudd For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/00/20229170-0-image-a-167_1572131494409.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
