Armstrong Roberts/ClassicStock\n\nFor something you use every night, pillows are surprisingly easy to forget to refresh. If it feels a little lumpy at bedtime, by morning you\u2019re probably more focused on your coffee than last night\u2019s sleep. But when exactly should you replace your pillows? The sleep specialists we reached out to had varied opinions. Dr. Joshua Tal, a psychologist who specializes in sleep disorders, told us he has heard that anywhere between two and seven years is a good time frame for pillow life expectancy. Dr. Janet Kennedy, a clinical psychologist and founder of NYC Sleep Doctor, said you can expect a basic poly or down-alternative pillow (also known as fiber pillows) to last only six months to a year. And Dr. Michael Gelb, a TMJ and sleep specialist, told us fiber pillows usually last one to two years. All agreed that down pillows last a bit longer \u2014 \u201cthree or more\u201d years, says Gelb \u2014 but can be difficult to clean, which can, according to Kennedy, lead to \u201callergies, congestion, and even snoring.\u201d\n\nIf the varied time frames are a bit confusing, you can always try what Tal calls the \u201cshoe test,\u201d coined by sleep specialist Michael Breus. \u201cWhat you do is you fold your pillow in half, put a shoe on the back side of the pillow, and then let go of the pillow,\u201d says Tal. \u201cIf the pillow folds back into shape and flings the shoe off of it, you\u2019re good. If it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s kind of lost its ability to hold your head up properly.\u201d (Just be sure to use a substantial shoe and not, say, a flip-flop.) Tal also told us about a test he uses with his patients: \u201cI advise clients to stand up against the wall, as if you were sleeping \u2014 so a back sleeper would stand with their back to the wall, a side sleeper would stand with their side \u2014 and then rest your head on the wall and notice how far it has to go to do that; then put your pillow in between where you\u2019re resting your head and see if you\u2019re standing up straight. That\u2019s the key: You should be standing up straight if you have a good pillow.\u201d A tired-out, flat pillow just won\u2019t do the job.\n\nGenerally speaking, though, it comes down to personal comfort. \u201cIf you cannot get comfortable in any position, it might be time to get a new pillow,\u201d says Gelb. He notes that when a pillow is on its last legs, it will \u201cfeel lumpy, as the materials inside shift and deteriorate, and lose its loft and ability to support you properly.\u201d It will also flatten faster, resist fluffing, and begin to stain and discolor from sweat and air pollutants. If that sounds like your pillow, read on for some Strategist-approved pillow picks that might just help you get a better night\u2019s sleep.\n\nThe Strategist\u2019s Most-Stood-Behind Pillows\n\nFiber pillows\n\n\n\n\n\nLangria Luxury Hotel Collection Bed Pillows Plush Down-Alternative Sleeping Pillow (Set of 2) This fiber-filled pillow was included in our list of the best pillows on Amazon according to reviewers.
