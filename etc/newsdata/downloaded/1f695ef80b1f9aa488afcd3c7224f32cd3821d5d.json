REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke/File Photo\n\nThe comments came in a report prepared by EU member states on cybersecurity risks to next-generation 5G mobile networks seen as crucial to the bloc\u2019s competitiveness in an increasingly networked world.\n\nThe authors chose to ignore calls by the United States to ban Huawei\u2019s equipment, drawing a welcome from the Shenzen-based company after it faced U.S. accusations that its gear could be used by China for spying.\n\n\u201cAmong the various potential actors, non-EU states or state-backed are considered as the most serious ones and the most likely to target 5G networks,\u201d the European Commission and Finland, which currently holds the rotating EU presidency, said in a joint statement.\n\n\u201cIn this context of increased exposure to attacks facilitated by suppliers, the risk profile of individual suppliers will become particularly important, including the likelihood of the supplier being subject to interference from a non-EU country,\u201d they said.\n\nHuawei, which competes with Finland\u2019s Nokia and Sweden\u2019s Ericsson, said it stood ready to work with its European partners on 5G network security. It has always denied its equipment can be used for spying.\n\n\u201cThis exercise is an important step toward developing a common approach to cybersecurity and delivering safe networks for the 5G era,\u201d a Huawei spokesman said.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased to note that the EU delivered on its commitment to take an evidence-based approach, thoroughly analyzing risks rather than targeting specific countries or actors.\u201d\n\nTom Ridge, a former U.S. secretary of homeland security, took a different view of the report. He said Huawei\u2019s close ties to the Chinese government meant it would have to comply with legislation requiring it to assist with intelligence gathering.\n\n\u201cIf countries needed more reason to implement stricter security measures to protect 5G networks, this comprehensive risk assessment is it,\u201d said Ridge, a member of the advisory board of Global Cyber Policy Watch.\n\nFifth-generation networks will hook up billions of devices, sensors and cameras in \u2018smart\u2019 cities, homes and offices. With that ubiquity, security becomes an even more pressing need than in existing networks.\n\n\u201c5G security requires that networks are built leveraging the most advanced security features, selecting vendors that are trustworthy and transparent,\u201d a Nokia spokesperson said, adding that the company was the only global vendor capable of providing all the building blocks for secure 5G networks.\n\nEU members have differed on how to treat Huawei, with Britain, a close U.S. ally, leaning toward excluding it from critical parts of networks. Germany is meanwhile creating a level playing field in which all 5G vendors should prove they are trustworthy.\n\nOVER-DEPENDENCE\n\nThe report warned against over-dependence on one telecoms equipment supplier.\n\n\u201cA major dependency on a single supplier increases the exposure to a potential supply interruption, resulting for instance from a commercial failure, and its consequences,\u201d it said.\n\nEuropean network operators, including Germany\u2019s Deutsche Telekom typically have multi-vendor strategies that they say reduce the security risks that might arise from relying too heavily on a single provider.\n\n\u201cThe Commission\u2019s 5G assessment recognizes security isn\u2019t just a supplier issue,\u201d said Alex Sinclair, chief technology officer of the GSMA, a global mobile-industry trade group.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A logo of the upcoming mobile standard 5G is pictured at the Hanover trade fair, in Hanover, Germany March 31, 2019.
