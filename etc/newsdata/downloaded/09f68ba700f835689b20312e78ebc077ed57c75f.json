(Steve Helber/AP)\n\nDominion Energy has filed a plan with the state to spend $594 million over the next three years modernizing Virginia\u2019s electrical grid, which it says would cost customers an average of a little more than $1 per month.\n\nThe State Corporation Commission (SCC) denied a similar plan earlier this year, saying the utility had not demonstrated that the costs were \u201creasonable and prudent.\u201d\n\nDominion spent several months refining the plan, creating cost-benefit estimates and interviewing stakeholders about priorities. It submitted the new version, which is slightly less costly than the original, on Monday.\n\n\u201cWe believe that these investments are very important for our customers and our commonwealth,\u201d Ed Baine, Dominion senior vice president for electric distribution, said Monday in an interview.\n\nEnvironmental groups had lauded the goals of the original plan but said the company needed to demonstrate that it was a good deal for consumers. Dominion has come under criticism from consumer advocates who say the utility finances costly projects on the backs of its customers while maximizing value for shareholders.\n\n[Costco, Walmart and other big retailers try to break Dominion Energy\u2019s grip on Virginia]\n\nThe plan spells out the first three years of a 10-year road map for modernizing Virginia\u2019s power grid. A major component is installing \u201csmart meters\u201d for all of the utility\u2019s customers, a process that would take six years and involve 2.1 million new meters across the state.\n\nSuch meters \u2014 which are already being tested in Alexandria, Herndon and Charlottesville \u2014 allow the company to interact with individual customers online. Instead of sending technicians out to take usage readings every month, Dominion can read the meters remotely.\n\nThe technology would give users more flexibility, Baine said. If someone was moving out of an apartment, for instance, Dominion could switch the account over to a new occupant online without having to go through a lengthy physical process, he said.\n\nThe plan also would create an online platform for customers to interact with the utility, replacing 12 separate systems now used for various aspects of the business, and it would improve Dominion\u2019s telecommunications network.\n\nAnother major part of the plan filed Monday involves \u201chardening\u201d the grid to help it survive storms. \u201cThe weather threats, as we\u2019ve seen across the nation, continue to get more severe,\u201d Baine said.\n\nWith people relying on constant Internet access, and with Virginia hosting more and more data centers that provide the backbone of the Internet, customers require increasingly reliable service, he said.\n\nThe updated grid would also allow for wider use of alternative energy sources that send power back into the network, such as solar and wind farms. Dominion, which recently announced plans for the nation\u2019s biggest wind farm off the coast of Virginia Beach, has said it supports Gov. Ralph Northam\u2019s goal of getting 30 percent of the state\u2019s energy from renewables by 2030 and being carbon-free by 2050.\n\n[Dominion Energy plans major offshore wind farm near Virginia Beach]\n\nThe new plan proposes increasing the infrastructure available for charging electric vehicles and making it easier for owners to charge them during off-peak hours. \u201cWhat we want to make sure is that we encourage the proliferation of electric vehicles but do it in such a way that we manage the impact on the grid,\u201d Baine said.\n\nVirginia passed a sweeping overhaul of utility regulation last year, setting alternative energy as a priority and giving Dominion leeway to plow profits into project investments instead of returning excess payments to customers.\n\n[Coalition of unlikely allies calls on state to break up utilities, deregulate energy]\n\nUnder that law, Dominion has to submit a 10-year transformation plan to the SCC, which it did in January. The commission accepted parts of the plan that involved improving cyber- and physical security and updating some telecommunications projects, totaling about $150 million over the next three years.\n\n\u201cWhile we find the Plan elements related to Cyber and Physical Security are well-conceived, well-supported and cost-effective, we find that the remaining Plan elements, which will cost customers hundreds of millions of dollars, are not,\u201d the SCC judges wrote at the time. \u201cDominion has failed to include in its Petition a well-developed and comprehensive plan to maximize the potential\u201d of new technology, they wrote.\n\nThe SCC left the door open for the company to take another swing at the plan, showing more detail about benefits and explaining how it would educate consumers to understand all the changes.\n\nDominion said it hired outside firms to help survey customers and stakeholders over the summer and to conduct cost-benefit analyses of its proposals. It said that the study showed that consumers would see about a dollar\u2019s worth of benefit from every dollar spent and that the plan would take Virginia from middle-of-the-pack in grid technology to a leadership position.\n\nDominion pledged to undertake a massive public education campaign that includes the use of social media, email, bill inserts and public events.\n\nThe SCC has six months to review the plan, take public comment and issue a ruling.\n\nRead more:\n\nFeds reconsidering permit for power lines near historic Jamestown, but there\u2019s a hitch: They\u2019re already built.\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "The $594 million, three-year proposal filed Monday aims to answer concerns from state regulators.", "authors": ["Gregory S.
