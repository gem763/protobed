It\u2019s a policy that works, but does mean that the annual unveil at the watch industry\u2019s spring trade fair, Baselworld, is a focus on very slight evolutions in design.\n\nThe single biggest story this year was that there was a new \u2018Batman\u2019 version (ie blue/black bezel) of the GMT-Master II, to join the upgraded \u2018Pepsi\u2019 (red/blue) of last year. So, when Rolex does reveal something that feels genuinely new, it\u2019s almost unsettling.\n\nThe Yacht-Master 42mm, rolling out across stores this month, is only new in Rolex terms \u2013 there have been 36mm and 40mm predecessors \u2013 but it isn\u2019t really the case shape, movement or functions that catch the attention . Instead, it\u2019s the combination of the white-gold case, black dial and strap that is so monochromatic as to give the watch a stark, deliberate character, which the smaller, rose-gold versions just don\u2019t have.\n\nPart of the effect comes from the contrast between the matt of the bezel inserts (Rolex\u2019s patented ceramic, Cerachrom, since you ask) and the synthetic-rubber Oysterflex strap with the gloss of the hands and case. All far more directional than you would ever expect from this brand. 18ct-white-gold Yacht-Master 42, \u00a321,400, rolex.com", "description": "Rolex doesn\u2019t really do big new designs, and hardly needs to.", "authors": ["James Gurney"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/luxury/2019/10/29/19_09_2019_Telegraph_Rolex110-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq4eIgCE9EMMtoqrTYg7-3gd_Tg39rPyTCrA_wgL1SnIg.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
