While brother Andy skipped Flushing Meadows to build up his fitness ahead of his return to top-level singles after hip surgery, Jamie made sure some silverware would be going back to Scotland.\n\nThe 33-year-old claimed his seventh grand slam doubles title, and fifth in mixed, with a 6-2, 6-3 victory over top seeds Chan Hao-ching and Michael Venus. He also won the men\u2019s doubles title at Flushing Meadows in 2016.\n\nA break of the Venus serve, courtesy of a stunning Mattek-Sands return, gave the UK-USA alliance the early initiative. Murray\u2019s instinctive volley then secured the double break and the opening set was wrapped up in 27 minutes.\n\nMattek-Sands\u2019 presence had ensured the backing of the home crowd on Arthur Ashe, and they roared with delight when her backhand return whizzed past Venus on championship point. The colourful American whipped out her phone to take a selfie with her partner as they celebrated a dominant win.\n\nMurray, who also won this title in 2017 with Martina Hingis, said: \u201cWe played amazing the whole two weeks, a lot of great tennis. It\u2019s easier playing on the big courts, I know Beth loves it, playing in front of lots of people and she played an amazing match. She says I\u2019m the yin to her yang. We\u2019re really happy to win again.\u201d", "description": "Jamie Murray ensured some success for his family at the US Open by defending the mixed doubles title with America\u2019s Bethanie Mattek-Sands", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e818c391ddee74e0da3b87cbfc39e5f1d7ef9255/0_80_3550_2132/master/3550.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=067bd1e654ceb5762d32b6b679bf8deb", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
