His campaign is focusing on getting corporate money out of U.S. politics.\n\nHe has worked for years on climate change and voter engagement and donated about $170 million since 2015 to his independent political action committees, Need to Impeach and NextGen America.\n\nDuring the 2017-2018 election cycle, he was the second-largest donor to Democratic and liberal candidates and causes, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nSteyer did not qualify for the third debate, which will take place in Houston this week with the top 10 candidates.", "description": "U.S. Democratic presidential hopeful Tom Steyer, a billionaire environmentalist and political donor, said on Sunday he has qualified to participate in the fourth Democratic debate in October, putting him on stage alongside the leading contenders for the first time.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190908&t=2&i=1427663954&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF870V4", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
