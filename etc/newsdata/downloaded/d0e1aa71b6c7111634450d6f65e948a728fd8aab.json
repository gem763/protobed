It\u2019s very important for people to know that.\n\n\u201cIt is completely understandable that \u2018stay put\u2019 advice has been questioned, but we are talking about buildings that fail, rather than advice that fails and there is no clear alternative, which is why this research is needed.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nMs Cotton was asked what needed to be done to keep building owners honest, to which she said: \u201cI absolutely think it\u2019s a role for government, that they should be the ones enforcing this.\u201d\n\nShe said it was the responsibility of the owners and managers of a buildings to ensure they are safe \u201cand, more importantly, that the building is not wrapped in flammable material with a gap behind it that allows fire to spread so rapidly\u201d.\n\nMs Cotton was not in operational command but defended the policy when she appeared before the inquiry last year.\n\nMatt Wrack, FBU general secretary, said: \u201cWe\u2019re glad that the London Fire Brigade (LFB) has joined our call for a national review of evacuation procedures when \u2018stay put\u2019 fails and for urgent changes to building safety legislation. \u201cCentral government\u2019s neglect of fire safety does not just go back 20 years; every government from Thatcher onwards has wreaked untold damage on the UK fire and rescue service.\n\nChair of the London Assembly Fire, Resilience and Emergency Planning Committee, Andrew Dismore said: \u201cNo fire brigade could cope with the wild west of building regulations that has been allowed to develop.\n\n(Image: SWNS)\n\n\u201cFire regulation also needs to be updated to ensure that all buildings have the correct fire safety measures.\n\nA Government spokesman said it was taking \u201curgent action to ensure residents are safe in their homes and we never see a devastating tragedy like the fire at Grenfell Tower again\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis includes introducing the biggest reforms in building and fire safety in nearly 40 years and making sure unsafe buildings are identified and significant steps are taken to protect those who live there.\u201d", "description": "Dany Cotton, London's fire chief, is urging the Government to undertake urgent research into 'stay put' advice following report into post-Grenfell response", "authors": ["Matthew Young", "Image", "Daily Mirror", "Pa", "Getty", "Swns"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article19830398.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_AGP_MDM_14062017FIRE_003.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
