The victim felt this was a threat to her life.\"\n\n(Image: Action Images)\n\nChair of the magistrates' bench, Peter Fisher, has prohibited the former footballer from entering her home and city centre coffee shop, under the terms of a 12-month restraining order.\n\nJeffers was fined \u00a3625 and ordered to pay \u00a385 court costs and a \u00a362 victim surcharge.\n\nDefence lawyer Jeremy Hawthorn said: \"He is a man of hitherto good character. He has a sporting career as his main achievement and he passes on that experience to the next generation as a full time coach.\n\n\"At the end of May there was a bit of a break down, on one evening he sees her in the company of another man, and tempers that had probably been bubbling away and would have come to a head, erupts and he sends those messages that he regrets.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: Action Images)\n\nJeffers came through the ranks at Everton as a teenager, making his senior debut at the age of 16.\n\nHe developed a \"fox in the box\" reputation and moved to Arsenal in 2001, but failed to live up to expectations in north London.\n\nThe ex-striker, who also won one England cap, returned to Goodison Park briefly on loan and also had spells at Sheffield Wednesday and Charlton - as well as stints in Australia and Malta.", "description": "Francis Jeffers, 38, sent vile Whatsapp messages to estranged partner Lucy after seeing her with another man", "authors": ["Jonathan Humphries", "Liam Prenderville", "Image", "Liverpool Echo", "Action Images", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20756788.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screen-Shot-2019-10-30-at-123913.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
