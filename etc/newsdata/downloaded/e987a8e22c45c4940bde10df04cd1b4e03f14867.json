The government declined immediate comment.\n\nBREXIT CHAOS\n\nMore than three years after the United Kingdom voted by 52%-48% in a referendum to leave the European Union, the future of Brexit remains mired in confusion, with options ranging from a turbulent no-deal exit to abandoning the entire endeavour.\n\nThe country is deeply divided and the court ruling was eagerly awaited, from pro- and anti-Brexit protesters gathered outside parliament to people watching on television in homes and offices.\n\nJohnson\u2019s reaction to the damning ruling could be crucial. He now faces a hostile parliament and the EU which says his proposals for a Brexit deal are far too meagre for a proper divorce deal.\n\nParliament was suspended, or prorogued in the formal term, from Sept. 10 to Oct. 14. The prorogation was approved by Queen Elizabeth, Britain\u2019s politically neutral head of state, on the advice of the prime minister. Buckingham Palace had no immediate comment.\n\nJohnson, who took office in July after Theresa May stepped down over her failure to win pariament\u2019s support for a withdrawal agreement, had claimed the suspension was necessary so that a new legislative agenda could be laid out and that it had nothing to do with thwarting opposition to a no-deal Brexit.\n\nHis lawyer had told the court he might even prorogue parliament again. However, after the ruling, opposition lawmakers demanded Johnson\u2019s resignation.\n\n\u201cI invite Boris Johnson, in the historic words, to \u2018consider his position\u2019,\u201d Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn told delegates at Labour\u2019s annual conference in Brighton.\n\nA Labour spokesman would not comment on whether the party would put forward a vote of no confidence in Johnson.\n\nLiberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson said Johnson was unfit to rule and that she would return to Westminster to fight to stop Brexit altogether. Scotland\u2019s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said if he did not resign he should be forced out.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\nFormer Conservative Prime Minister John Major, who joined anti-Brexit campaigners and opposition lawmakers in the legal challenge against the prorogation, said parliament should be recalled to receive Johnson\u2019s \u201cunreserved apology\u201d.\n\n\u201cNo prime minister must ever treat the monarch or parliament in this way again,\u201d he said in a statement.", "description": "The United Kingdom's Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday that Prime Minister Boris Johnson's decision to shut down parliament in the run-up to Brexit was unlawful, a humiliating rebuke that thrusts Britain's exit from the European Union into deeper turmoil.", "authors": ["Estelle Shirbon", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433351577&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N16Q", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
