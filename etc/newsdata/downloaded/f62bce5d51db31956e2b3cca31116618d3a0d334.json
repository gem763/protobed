Lauren hopes her story can help others avoid similar pain. For privacy, she asked The Atlantic not to use her full name, and her ex asked not to be named at all.\n\n* * *\n\nThey met when Lauren, her middle name, was in her mid-20s and her ex was nearly 30. He was her first serious boyfriend. They had run in the same circles for years, but when he moved to New York for work, they reconnected. He was of medium height, and balding, but cute. With degrees from prestigious universities, he looked great on paper. Lauren was fresh off a string of disastrous dates. He made a move; she went with it.\n\nAt first, he made Lauren laugh and impressed her friends. He even planned a romantic weekend at the beach and took Lauren to Costa Rica.\n\nBut before long, Lauren said, he began making obnoxious comments, boasting about his ex-girlfriends and saying things like, \u201cI could walk down Central Park West and get any girl I wanted,\u201d Lauren said. (Her ex denied this.)\n\n\u201cI sort of let it slide because I was so happy to be in a relationship with someone who I thought was otherwise right for me,\u201d Lauren told me. \u201cIn retrospect, they were harbingers of worse to come.\u201d\n\nWhat was to come, according to Lauren, was a gauntlet of near-daily put-downs about everything from her appearance to the way she poured water into the sink. As her self-confidence evaporated, she found herself wondering if she could do any better.\n\nLauren thought if she just worked harder, she could fix the relationship. Relatively early on, the couple was clashing over trivial things, like gifts. When he won an award, Lauren coordinated a surprise party for him. To her ex, it was thoughtless, she said. She should have realized that his friends, who didn\u2019t win the award, would feel bad attending such a party. Indeed, he told me, he wasn\u2019t thrilled about it, although he did appreciate other gifts she gave him, and he told her so.\n\nAnother time, Lauren signed up for dance lessons to surprise him. Her ex had told her, \u201cI\u2019m bad at following,\u201d she wrote to one friend over Gchat. \u201cI keep trying to lead, or at least do my own thing. Damn independent streak of mine.\u201d When she told him about the lessons, she claims he said she should have been at work instead.\n\nFor their second anniversary, Lauren devised a game in which they would each say what they loved about the other person. Her ex said he loved that Lauren was always trying to improve herself.", "description": "He said she was oversensitive.
