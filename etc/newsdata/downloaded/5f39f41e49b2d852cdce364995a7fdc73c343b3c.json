He said he also intended to negotiate with the animal rights and environmentalist People-Animals-Nature party.\n\nLeaders of the two far-left parties both said they had no objections to Costa being nominated as premier and were ready to negotiate if he committed to improving the lives of workers and boosting public investment, especially in healthcare.\n\nAnalysts say the president is likely to demand assurances from the parties that they agree an arrangement that will last.\n\nCosta\u2019s minority government has received praise from Brussels and at home for combining fiscal discipline with measures to promote growth after recession and the austerity of Portugal\u2019s 2010-14 debt crisis.\n\nAna Andrade, an analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit, said a political alliance on the left was likely, with Costa probably having to make some concessions on public spending. She also saw room for Costa to seek support on a case-by-case basis from the opposition PSD for some policy measures.\n\nStill, \u201cit is likely to be a more unstable term than in 2015, not least because of the less favourable macroeconomic backdrop\u201d, she said. Economic growth has been slowing down, weighed by global trade tensions and concerns over Brexit.\n\nBut ratings agency DBRS Morningstar, which lifted Portugal\u2019s credit rating last week, said the election outcome \u201cpoints to broad continuity of domestic policies\u201d. It expected an alliance similar to the one that enabled Costa\u2019s first government.\n\nWith most votes counted, the Socialists led by a wide margin with 106 seats, 20 more than in 2015. They can still win some of the four seats yet to be assigned, but not a full majority of 116 in the 230-seat assembly.\n\nIn the streets, people were cautiously upbeat that a stable government will be possible, but many urged caution.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see what happens from now on,\u201d said Marcelina Castela, 65, a post office worker in Lisbon. \u201cIt would be great to have a more cohesive and consistent alliance, but on the other hand maybe it will create more bickering between them.\u201d", "description": "Portugal's president will consult the main political parties on Tuesday so as to have a prime minister-designate in place without delay to tackle issues such as Brexit following the Socialists' victory in Sunday's election, his office said.", "authors": ["Andrei Khalip", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1438042159&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF960OR", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
