The protesters, who said they were from Freedom House, held up signs reading, \u201cShame the NBA,\u201d \u201dSouth Park was right\u201d and \u201cMemo to the NBA: Principles over profit! No censorship! USA loves Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nThe problems between the NBA and China began after Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey posted a tweet last week that showed support for anti-government protesters in Hong Kong.\n\nThe NBA has not apologized for Morey\u2019s remarks.\n\nA Freedom House spokeswoman said some members were planning to protest inside during the game. A spokeswoman for Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation said the group was planning to hand out T-shirts inside the arena during the game in various sections close to the court.\n\nInside the arena, there were a handful of disruptions in the crowd.\n\nAfter the playing of the Chinese national anthem, one fan shouted, \u201cFreedom of expression! Freedom of speech! Free Hong Kong!\u201d Another fan shouted for a free Hong Kong from the second level during the second quarter.\n\nMinutes later, security approached one fan holding up a \u201cFree Tibet\u201d sign and another holding the Tibet flag. Security tried to take the sign, and the fan refused to give it up. Security then followed them from their seats and out of the lower bowl.\n\nWizards coach Scott Brooks said that he heard one protester at the end of the Chinese national anthem.\n\n\u201cOther than that, I didn\u2019t hear it,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cI was focused on the game.\u201d\n\nBrooks said he didn\u2019t hear any of his players talk about the protests and he never mentioned it to his players.\n\nA Wizards spokesman said in a statement: \u201cThe building security staff removed signs tonight in accordance with Capital One Arena\u2019s long-standing signs, banners, posters and flag policy. No fans were asked to leave the game.\u201d\n\nA similar scene played out in Philadelphia on Tuesday during a game between Guangzhou and the 76ers. Two fans were removed by arena security for holding signs and chanting in support of Hong Kong.\n\nCJ Harris had 25 points in the loss for the Chinese team.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Stephen Whyno in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "Protesters handed out T-shirts and held up signs in support of Hong Kong on Wednesday night when the Washington Wizards hosted a team from the Chinese", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/09/2359f9_loong-lions-wizards-basketball-46001-activists-hold-up-sign-an-nba-exhibition-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
