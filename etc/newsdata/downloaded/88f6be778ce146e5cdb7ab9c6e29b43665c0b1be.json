President: \u2018Ideological Fascism\u2019 Rampant on Campus", "language": "en", "text": "Former Oklahoma Wesleyan University President Dr. Everett Piper appeared on Fox News on Wednesday to discuss the rise of \u201cideological fascism\u201d on college campuses. Dr. Piper decried the \u201cthought control\u201d rampant on campuses across the nation.\n\n\u201cWhat we have today is thought control rather than the premise of thoughtful debate. It\u2019s ideological fascism,\u201d Dr. Everett Piper said in an interview on Fox & Friends on Wednesday morning. Piper, the former president of Oklahoma Wesleyan University, makes the case that the left would rather control speech on campuses than have open and honest discussions.\n\n\u201c\u2018You will think like us. You will look like us. You will talk like us. And, if you don\u2019t, we will crush you. We will crush you. We will silence you,'\u201d Piper said during the interview.\n\nPiper pointed out that commentators across the political spectrum agree that universities will flourish only when students can civilly disagree.\u201dYou have people like Adam Carolla and Van Jones and Bill Maher and Dennis Prager and Dave Rubin\u2026and then conservative Christians\u2026agreeing that what we\u2019re creating today on our campuses is a monster \u2014 rather than academic freedom and intellectual liberty,\u201d Piper said on Wednesday.\n\nPiper argued that American academia should reawaken the classical liberal traditions that molded the university into a free marketplace of ideas. \u201cYou don\u2019t go to college or university to be indoctrinated,\u201d Piper added. \u201cI think if we recognize this is an opportunity to go back to the classic liberal arts institution, where you teach liberty and you teach freedom, rather than teach fascism, then we can have a correction in the right direction.\u201d", "description": "Former Oklahoma Wesleyan University President Dr. Everett Piper appeared on\u00a0Fox News on Wednesday to discuss the rise of \"ideological fascism\" on college campuses.
