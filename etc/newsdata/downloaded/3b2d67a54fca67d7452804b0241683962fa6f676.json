Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker had called on countries not to nominate fill-in commissioners, saying their entitlements would be a waste of taxpayers' money, and pledged not to give any fill-ins a portfolio.\n\nThe EPP group in the Parliament had called for Pa\u0219cu's nomination process to be stopped, but Pa\u015fcu told POLITICO's Brussels Playbook: \u201cMy government submitted my candidature, it is for my government to withdraw it.\u201d\n\nPa\u015fcu said his pension wouldn\u2019t exactly break the EU bank: \u201cThe basic amount for a mandate of more than one month but less than two months is \u20ac68 per month, possibly minus a sickness insurance contribution of \u20ac49 a month.\u201d\n\nPa\u0219cu was the last man standing for a fill-in job in the Juncker Commission, after Estonia withdrew its nomination of Kadri Simson to replace departed Commissioner Andrus Ansip, who also quit to take up an MEP seat. Simson is Estonia's commissioner-designate for Commission President-elect Ursula von der Leyen's College of Commissioners.", "description": "Ioan\u00a0Mircea Pa\u0219cu was the last man standing for a fill-in job in the Juncker Commission.", "authors": ["Florian Eder", "Carmen Paun"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/h_53898038-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
