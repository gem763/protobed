Prosecutors said that, among other things, the pair made campaign contributions with the intent of lobbying U.S. politicians to oust the country\u2019s ambassador to Ukraine. At the time, Giuliani was trying to get Ukrainian officials to investigate the son of Trump\u2019s potential Democratic challenger, Joe Biden.\n\nCorreia is accused of conspired with the other defendants, including Ukrainian-born U.S. citizen Andrey Kukushkin, to make political donations to local and federal politicians in New York, Nevada and other states with the aim of trying to get support for a new recreational marijuana business.\n\nAll four defendants were expected to appear Thursday in federal court in Manhattan.\n\nA lawyer for Correia is not yet listed in court records.\n\nGiuliani has said he had no knowledge of illegal donations and hadn\u2019t seen any evidence that Parnas and Fruman did anything wrong.\n\nCorreia is listed as the registered agent for a Florida corporation tied to a series of wire transfers prosecutors allege was part of an elaborate effort to hide the true source of funds used to make the donations.\n\nHe posed with then-Rep. Pete Sessions in a 2018 photo taken inside the Texas Republican\u2019s Capitol Hill office that Parnas posted on social media with the caption \u201cHard at work !!\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press reported last week that Sessions fits the description in the indictment of a congressman who prosecutors allege was part of a coordinated effort to remove the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/80/ab/33afd35244e495dfc4187e3bf555/20191016-rudy-giuliani-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
