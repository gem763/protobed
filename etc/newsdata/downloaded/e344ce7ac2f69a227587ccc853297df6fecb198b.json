They obviously scored not long after and we didn't move it as quickly as we normally do.\n\n'We weren't fighting, we weren't pressing as much as we normally do. In the second half (we were) a little bit better, we had a couple of chances to put the game to bed and we didn't.'\n\nHarry Kane had given his side the lead after converting a spot kick after an early foul\n\nThe Czechs came back to win and stop England qualifying for the Euros in 2020 on the night\n\nKane was mindful that the loss means England go to Bulgaria under greater pressure than they had hoped.\n\n'Every away game in Europe is difficult,' he said.\n\n'They had the crowd behind them, maybe the pitch isn't as great and as easy to play on. But there's no excuse, we've played in these games before and we have to do better than tonight.\n\n'It's a bit of a wake-up call, of course we're still in a good position so there's no need to panic. We obviously have to win the game on Monday but, for sure, we've still got stuff to work on.'", "description": "The Three Lions went to Prague knowing a win would have them at Euro 2020, and they were halfway there when Kane opened the scoring from the spot early on, but failed to hold on.", "authors": ["Ollie Lewis For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/22/19608828-0-image-a-7_1570829565940.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
