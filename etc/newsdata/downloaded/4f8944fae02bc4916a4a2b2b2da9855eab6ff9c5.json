His response was short but all-telling: \u201cHell no.\u201d He added:\n\n\"Nothing within Libra had to be a cryptocurrency to do what they wanted to do.\"\n\nReacting to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's speech at Georgetown University, Dorsey said that a lot of Zuckerberg's comments seemed to be based in American tradition.

Dorsey said that he prefers the use of existing open standards like Bitcoin (BTC):", "description": "Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey says \u201cHell no\u201d to the question of whether Twitter would ever join Facebook\u2019s Libra project", "authors": ["Joeri Cant"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy8xOWNiZDc5NjAxMDExODBhM2M3ZGVjMmUwZjE0MTVmNy5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
