REUTERS/Lim Huey Teng\n\nKUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia may have to pass a law forcing its companies to tackle fires on land they control abroad, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Wednesday, as forest fires in neighboring Indonesia spread haze across the region.\n\nSoutheast Asia has suffered for years from dry-season bouts of smoke caused by fires, many in Indonesia, set to clear land, raising worries about health and the impact on tourism.\n\nThe smoke, or haze as it is known, has been particularly bad over recent weeks leading to accusations and angry responses among the neighbors.\n\nIndonesia\u2019s Environment Minister Siti Nurbaya Bakar told Reuters last week that some of the fires in her country had been spotted on palm oil plantations operated by at least four subsidiaries of Malaysian companies.\n\nMahathir said his government would call on the Malaysian companies to put out the fires.\n\n\u201cBut of course, if we find that they are unwilling to take action, we may have to pass a law which will make them responsible for fires in their property, even if its outside of Malaysia,\u201d Mahathir told reporters.\n\nTeresa Kok, Malaysia\u2019s minister in charge of palm oil, said last week any report of fires on land controlled by Malaysian companies was a \u201cserious accusation\u201d.\n\nContacted last week, two of the companies identified by the Indonesian minister said they had small fires on their land but they had been extinguished.", "description": "Malaysia may have to pass a law forcing its companies to tackle fires on land they control abroad, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Wednesday, as forest fires in neighboring Indonesia spread haze across the region.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431142954&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H0HT", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
