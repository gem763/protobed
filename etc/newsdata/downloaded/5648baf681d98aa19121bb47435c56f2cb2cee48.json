Their bodies were found in their destroyed Coongbar home on Thursday some two days after fires roared through the region.\n\nOn Sunday a second contingent of firefighters from South Australia were set to head to NSW to help their colleagues battle a string of fires.\n\nFifty-two personnel, including two paramedics, were scheduled to leave Adelaide on Sunday to be deployed in the north of the state. They were set to replace a similar-sized group that joined the fight about a week ago.", "description": "Crews battle to contain fires at Busbys Flat and Drake in state\u2019s north as weather warning looms", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03d26fac86abbead36403a0ace75fb29ab776225/0_295_4986_2992/master/4986.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fdce0b950aa7f6d77728a24a110abe20", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
