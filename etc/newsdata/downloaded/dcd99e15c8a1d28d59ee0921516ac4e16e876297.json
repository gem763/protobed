These are endless wars,\u201d he said Monday, in an apparent reference to the continuing U.S. troop commitments in the Middle East, Afghanistan and elsewhere. And yesterday, Trump falsely claimed that U.S. forces have been fully removed from Syria. Roughly 1,000 troops are deployed there.\n\nAlong with other deployments over the spring and summer \u201cin response to Iranian provocations,\u201d the new wave of units will push the total number of U.S. troops the Pentagon has added to the Middle East since May to 14,000, Esper noted.\n\nThose earlier deployments included Air Force bombers, early-warning radar planes, drones, construction engineers to build up airbases, and warships. Some of the units deployed to existing U.S. bases in the region, while others, starting in July, reestablished an operational U.S. military presence at an airbase in Saudi Arabia. The Pentagon had pulled out of that airbase, leaving only an advisory presence in the kingdom, after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.\n\nAn Air Force headquarters unit will also head to Saudi Arabia in the latest wave, the Pentagon noted in a statement. U.S. Central Command, which oversees operations in the Middle East, requested the new deployments.\n\nEsper has also delegated authority to move forces within the region to Gen. Frank McKenzie, who heads Central Command, added Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley.\n\nThe purpose of the deployment is to \u201csend the message to the Iranians, do not strike another sovereign state, do not threaten American forces,\u201d Milley said.\n\nEsper, meanwhile, described the move as an example of \u201cdynamic force employment,\u201d a term the Pentagon has recently introduced for short-notice deployments around the world, either in response to crises or to flex the military\u2019s muscles in training.\n\nBut the timing of the new orders suggests they are aimed at filling an airpower gap as the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike group prepares to depart the region. Esper\u2019s predecessor ordered Lincoln and its accompanying aircraft and warships to Middle Eastern waters in May, reversing a Pentagon initiative meant to free up carriers from their longstanding Middle East mission.\n\nEsper wouldn\u2019t comment on the aircraft carrier issue today, saying he wouldn\u2019t \u201cspeak about operational deployments particularly with regard to assets like carriers.\u201d But Esper has not signed an order authorizing an extension of the Lincoln\u2019s deployment, Capt. Brook DeWalt, a Pentagon spokesperson, said.\n\nThe deployment of Lincoln's replacement, USS Harry S. Truman, has been delayed until next month due to problems with the ship's electrical system, USNI News reported.", "description": "The Pentagon is sending a fresh wave of troops to Saudi Arabia to help defend the kingdom against Iran, despite President Donald Trump\u2019s repeated pledges to end the U.S. military's commitments in the Middle East.  \u201cI have ordered the deployment to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia of two additional fighter", "authors": ["Wesley Morgan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GboCO3iUG2ubow3cfKH4Qg--~B/aD03NzM7dz0xMTYwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/politico_453/dbe8f98bb9b3e2042c2be96f6d049d31", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
