She can't get anybody else,\" Abdelaziz told TMZ Sports. \"He's irrelevant. You heard what Justin Gaethje said \u2014 he's not a good person. The trainer has left him, we don't want to talk about Conor honestly.\n\n\"Khabib had such an amazing night on Saturday night, he fought a really great fighter, he beat a world champion on Saturday. This is what we should be talking about.\n\n\"Conor \u2014 who cares? For what? We already beat him, we already whooped his ass.\"\n\nRead more: Khabib Nurmagomedov said he'd fight Conor McGregor if he ever ran into him because he's not afraid of going to jail\n\nThe fight between Nurmagomedov and McGregor last year was embroiled in controversy.\n\nDuring the buildup to the brawl, McGregor attacked a bus carrying Nurmagomedov in New York, while the pair also exchanged un-pleasantries on social media, with Nurmagomedov calling McGregor a rapist, and McGregor describing Nurmagomedov's wife as \"a towel\" in a now-deleted tweet.\n\nThe feud came to a head after Nurmagomedov beat the Irishman, when he jumped the cage and launched an attack on McGregor's ringside friend Dillon Danis.\n\n\"Conor made it ugly. This is the only thing he can do, promote ugliness,\" said Abdelaziz.\n\n\"We don't promote ugliness, we Muslims, we promote peace. We fight in a violent sport, but at the end of day, you see what Khabib and Poirier did, it was nothing by respect.\n\n\"We don't want to go through this Conor bulls--- again.\"\n\nRead more: From professional wrestlers to MMA fighters: 12 wrestlers who made the jump to mixed martial arts\n\nTony Ferguson is most likely the next opponent for Nurmagomedov, who recently said he wants his next fight to be a charity bout in Africa.", "description": "Khabib Nurmagomedov's manager has ruled out the possibility of a rematch with Conor McGregor, saying there is \"0.00%\" chance they'll fight again.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5c5ae012e43f40798323aef7-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
