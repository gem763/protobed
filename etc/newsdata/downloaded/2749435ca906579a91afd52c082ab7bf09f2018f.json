Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase.\n\nGraphite Maze on Steel and Graphite Dash on Steel sheets Brooklinen\n\nBrooklinen makes my hands down favorite bed sheets, and I've tried lots of different sets.\n\nThey're comfortable and responsibly made, come in a bunch of fun prints and solid colors, and hold up well to frequent washings.\n\nBrooklinen's Hardcore Sheet Bundles are also affordably priced for everything that comes with them.\n\nInsider Picks has ranked Brooklinen as the makers of the best luxury sheets, the best sateen sheets, and the best duvet cover on the internet in our buying guides.\n\nI've waxed poetic on why everyone should own a high-quality set of bed sheets before. They look great, they feel even better, and they can genuinely offer you a better night's sleep for the third of your life you spend doing just that.\n\nThe only real argument to be made against them is their price.\n\nLuxury bedding doesn't come cheap. Even in the direct-to-consumer space \u2014 which is leaps and bounds more affordable than traditional retailers like Frette, which marks up its sheets by as much as 220% \u2014 finding genuine \"deals\" and \"good values\" is next to impossible. You still end up spending somewhere around $300 or $400 on a new set of sheets from startups like Parachute and Boll & Branch. The missions of these companies are steps in the right direction, and their products are excellent, however, their price points are still pretty high for most shoppers.\n\nBrooklinen is different.\n\nLaunched on Kickstarter in April 2014 by husband-and-wife team Vicki and Rich Fulop, Brooklinen is quickly gaining a reputation for its high-quality products and reasonable price points.\n\n\"The outcome of the [Kickstarter] campaign was extremely successful,\" Vicki Fulop told Business Insider. \"We set our goal at $50,000, and we wound up selling $237,000 in sheets. It was surreal \u2014 we couldn't believe it.\"\n\nThe company pulled in $2.5 million in 2015 \u2014 it's first full year in business \u2014 $25 million in 2016, and is on course to do more than $50 million in 2017. And what's more, 20% of Brooklinen's customers (myself included) also reorder from them.\n\nThat's the kind of meteoric success you just can't argue with.\n\nThe reasons for Brooklinen's quick rise in the bedding industry are simple: Customers love their sheets \u2014 how they feel and how they look \u2014 and they love the value they're getting from them even more. As someone who's been sleeping on their sheets for two years now, I'm comfortable saying they are hands down the best sheets I've ever put on my bed. Perhaps more importantly, they didn't cost me a small fortune either.\n\nBlack Maze on Cream and Black Dash on Cream sheets Brooklinen\n\nI like Brooklinen's Luxe Hardcore Sheet Bundle (from $198) since it comes with everything you need to make your bed: a duvet cover, a fitted sheet, a flat sheet, and four pillowcases. Brooklinen also sell a Classic Hardcore Sheet Bundle from $168 and includes the same items if you're not looking to spend as much.\n\nBelow are the specifications for Brooklinen's Luxe Hardcore Sheet Bundle according to its website:\n\nSheet set includes: 1 duvet cover, 1 flat sheet, 1 fitted sheet, and 4 pillowcases\n\n480-thread-count sateen weave is guaranteed to provide a better sleep experience with each use\n\nMade from 100% long staple cotton that is Oeko-Tex certified to be free of harmful chemicals\n\nFitted sheet features a 15-inch-deep pocket that fits most mattresses\n\nPrice aside, it's the look that really sold me on them. Vicki Fulop says it best: \"The sheets are simple, classic, clean, and timeless.\" I don't know about everybody else, but that's exactly what I want in my sheets. Brooklinen's plain whites, grays, and navys look mature and understated. Even their playful \"Maze\" and \"Dash\" prints look sophsicated.\n\nI'm also happy to report that after two years of use, my Smoke Stripe and Window Pane sheet bundles (these are both primarily white) have yet to yellow in the wash; they're still as crisp white as they were the day they were shipped to my door. They've only gotten more comfortable over time, too.\n\nFurther, Brooklinen's practices sit right with me.\n\n\"We do not have a storefront, we don't pay slotting fees, licensing fees, or distribution fees, and we are trying to put as large a percentage of the cost into the materials and construction of our sheets as possible,\" Vicki Fulop told me. \"We have also chosen to work with partners who are located in developing countries that have free trade agreements with the US. This enables us to avoid paying tariffs on the sheets we import, while also ensuring that our partners manufacture responsibly and treat their workers fairly.\"\n\nI'm of the mindset that it's small businesses with values (and products) like Brooklinen that we, as customers, should be supporting. But that's just me.\n\nSky Blue sheets Brooklinen\n\nIf your bed sheets could stand to be upgraded (and they probably can), head over to Brooklinen and have a look. Your living space should complement the thoroughly grown-up achievements of your daily life, and this brand is a good value every way you look at it.\n\nBrooklinen's bedding is available for twin, twin XL, full, queen, king, and California king-sized mattresses. My recommendation is to go for one of the company's all-inclusive sheet bundles, but you're also free to buy just a duvet cover or couple of pillowcases.\n\nThis article was originally published on 5/5/2016 and has been updated.", "description": "Brooklinen's sheets are hands down the best ones I've ever put on my bed, and they didn't cost me a small fortune.", "authors": ["Ellen Hoffman", "Insider Picks"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5728be3e9105842b008c062b?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2017-05-06"}
