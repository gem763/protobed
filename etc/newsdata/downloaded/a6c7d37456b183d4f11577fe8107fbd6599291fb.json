You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nWhy do I need home insurance?\n\nEssentially, home insurance will cover the cost of sorting out your home and the things in it if something goes wrong.\n\n\u2018Something\u2019 could be anything from vandalism to a flood and everything in between, which means there are two types of home insurance \u2013 buildings cover for the property itself and its permanent fixtures and fittings, and contents cover for everything you put in your home. You can buy standalone policies or a single combined policy.\n\nMoneySuperMarket data shows that the average cost of a combined home insurance policy in July 2019 was around \u00a3145.\n\nHome insurance may not be compulsory in the same way as car cover, but if you have a mortgage your lender will almost always demand that you have adequate cover in place to cover most eventualities, including landlords with buy-to-let borrowing.\n\nHome insurance for tenants and students\n\nAs a tenant, the responsibility to fix the building if it becomes damaged stops with your landlord, the same could sometimes be true if you own property on a leasehold basis like a flat.\n\nBut the contents of your home will only ever be your problem so its worth getting proper cover for your stuff.\n\nThe average annual cost of contents insurance for tenants is around \u00a359, rising to just over \u00a363 for a typical student.\n\nHome insurance for small or large properties\n\nThe cost of home insurance for buildings and contents insurance will be influenced by your location, risk \u2013 like flooding or chances of being burgled, and of course the value of your home and contents.\n\nIt means that while a combined insurance policy for a bungalow comes in at an average of \u00a3125, rising to \u00a3143 for a house, a typical bedsit might set you back \u00a3350 in annual cover, MoneySuperMarket warns.\n\nHow to choose a home insurance policy\n\n\u201cFirst, make sure you know the value of what you are insuring - check the amount of overall cover for your buildings and contents,\u201d says Brian Brown, head of insight for Defaqto.\n\n\u201cThis should be high enough to cover the cost of totally rebuilding your home and replacing all your contents if they were destroyed in say a fire. If you don\u2019t know how much to insure your buildings for the valuation for a recent mortgage should tell you, or you can use the rebuilding costs calculator provided by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS).\n\n\u201cMany insurers now provide very high fixed sums insured (typically \u00a3500,000 for buildings and \u00a350,000 for contents). For most homes this removes the need to estimate the amount you want to insure, but make sure these amounts are enough for your needs. If you insure your home for less than it is worth and you have a big claim the insurer might reduce the amount they pay you in proportion to the amount you are underinsured.\u201d\n\nCheck individual limits for things like high risk items (TVs, jewellery, etc.) and make sure the policy will cover you properly for all your belongings.\n\nConsider whether you want cover for accidental damage \u2013 this will cost more, but can be worth it in the long run, especially for home contents like TVs, carpets, furniture and the like. And think about insuring valuables you regularly take out of your home, like jewellery and tech.\n\nBear in mind that some home policies will cover mobile phones for accidental damage or theft, and cover can be much better than offered by some mobile phone policies.\n\n\u201cLook for policies which give you extra add-ons such as home emergency cover, and annual travel insurance,\u201d Brown adds.\n\n\u201cSometimes these add-ons are included at no extra cost. If you buy one of these policies make sure you know how to use the home emergency service. If it includes annual travel insurance make sure you check to see who is covered.\n\nWhere should I buy home insurance?\n\nAs with any insurance policy, the right policy, provider and price will be based on your unique circumstances, but researchers like Defaqto and Fairer Finance rate providers overall based on customer experience as well drilling down to pick out the individual policies they think are worth buying.\n\nFor example, Fairer Finance has most recently awarded Ecclesiastical, Nationwide, NFU Mutual, HSBC, Santander, Hiscox, Direct Line, Tesco Bank and LV= their five star rating for customer experience while specific policies from Age UK, M&S, Bank of Scotland, NatWest/RBS, Swinton, Saga and TSB all get five stars.\n\nWe may earn some commission if you click on a link in this article and buy a product or service, but we never allow this to influence our coverage.", "description": "It\u2019s autumn.
