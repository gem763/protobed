Financial markets are pricing in a 99% chance that Frontier will file for bankruptcy over the next two years, according to the letter, which was signed by portfolio manager Douglas Ormond and copied to Citrone, founder of the investment firm.\n\nClick here for full text of letter\n\nFrontier faces dwindling liquidity as \u201ccracks begin to appear in the U.S. credit markets,\u201d and could be in danger of violating terms of its debt, Discovery wrote. The firm represents longtime investors in Frontier.\n\nFrontier declined to comment. The company and the hedge fund are both based in Norwalk, Connecticut.\n\nRisk Factors\n\n\u201cNormally haste makes waste, but in this instance we believe haste limits waste,\u201d Ormond said in the letter. \u201cThe further the delays in addressing the balance sheet and state of the business in a court-supervised process, the greater the risk to the corporation, operating assets, employees and surrounding Norwalk.\u201d\n\nIncreasing subscriber losses and turnover, combined with limited financial guidance, will only lead to further deterioration in the business, according to the letter.\n\nDiscovery\u2019s stance puts it at odds with the position taken in June by Mark Brodsky\u2019s Aurelius Capital Management LP, which called for Frontier to pursue an out-of-court debt exchange and said there\u2019s no \u201cdefensible basis\u201d for the company to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Creditors have been pushing the company for talks about reworking its $17 billion debt load.\n\nA spokesman for Aurelius declined to comment on whether Aurelius is still involved in Frontier.\n\nAdvisers for the creditors have signed non-disclosure agreements, but substantive negotiations have yet to begin.\n\nFrontier is one of the biggest targets for investors in deeply distressed companies at a time when such candidates are relatively sparse. The company ranks as the largest issuer of performing debt with yields above 20%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. At least half a dozen sets of its notes trade for less than half of face value.\n\nThe last time Frontier posted an annual profit was 2014, with cumulative net losses topping $8 billion, including more than $5 billion this year. Still, the company reported $786 million of liquidity and operating free cash flow of $300 million as of June 30. It\u2019s scheduled to report third-quarter earnings on Nov. 5.\n\n(Updates with Aurelius declining to comment in the eighth paragraph)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Allison McNeely in New York at amcneely@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Rick Green at rgreen18@bloomberg.net, Dawn McCarty\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Frontier Communications Corp. should file for bankruptcy sooner rather than later to get ahead of deterioration of the business and \u201ccracks\u201d in U.S. credit markets, according to Robert Citrone\u2019s hedge fund.Further delays as the telecom company tries to organize creditors will erode cash", "authors": ["Allison Mcneely"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.nEoTZdKp974lo5QHPEMnQ--~B/aD0xMTA0O3c9MTcyMjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/18d598ed4fc223463cc526e7e76e23d2", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
