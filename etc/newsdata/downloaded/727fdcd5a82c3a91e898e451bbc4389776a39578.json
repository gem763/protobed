Of course it is, but the reality is we can't control the weather,' he said.\n\n'Do we charge on and put people's lives at risk or do we lead and make a decision that's around making sure people are safe?\n\n'It's a no-brainer. The man from America could even have made this decision.'\n\nHe showed sympathy for the Italians, though, who are now knocked out, while backing the decision to play the tournament in Japan during storm season.\n\n'There's a lot of sympathy for Italy,' Hansen added.\n\n'But the right decisions are being made, because it's all about safety.\n\n'It's always a risk at this time of year with the typhoons, but this is when we play the Rugby World Cup.\n\nHansen addressed the media beside his captain Kieran Read at a press conference in Urayasu\n\nNew Zealand (top) were supposed to face Italy on Saturday but will now wait until quarter-final\n\n'If you play it earlier, you run the risk of people dying on the footy field because it'll be 40 degrees.\n\n'If you play it later, then that's when we are finished for Christmas so you'd have Santa Claus giving us the World Cup.\n\n'What are we going to do on Saturday? Probably stay inside would be a good idea, I reckon.\n\n'Sunday, we'll see what the weather allows us to do. And then Monday, hopefully we can get back into training and get ready for a quarter-final.'\n\nHansen said players will 'probably stay inside' on Saturday, and then hopefully train on Sunday\n\nSonny Bill Williams runs through drills during an All Blacks training session earlier in the week\n\nHansen hopes the Japan v Scotland match goes ahead too.\n\n'Sport's so unpredictable at times that you would think the way Japan have been playing that they would win the game but you've got another team (Scotland) who have a really emotional reason to win it because they have to,' he concluded.\n\n'It could go any way. All I hope is they get to play and it's a really wonderful game of rugby because it'll make something positive out of a weekend that hasn't been so positive.'", "description": "WILL KELLEHER IN JAPAN: Steve Hansen gave a typically dead-pan assessment after New Zealand's game against Italy was called off - saying even Donald Trump could have made the right call.", "authors": ["Will Kelleher For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/10/19531646-0-image-a-17_1570699794082.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
