Dozens of civilians and fighters have been killed on both sides.\n\nOn Instagram, the Turkish Football Federation also posted an image of the Turkey players and trainers saluting in the dressing room, along with the message:\n\n\"At the end of the road lies the championship! After seven matches we continue our leadership in the Euro 2020 Qualifying Group H. We give this win to all our hero soldiers.\"\n\nUefa spokesman Philip Townsend told Italian news agency Ansa the Turkish salute \"could seem like a provocation\".\n\n\"I can guarantee that we will examine this situation, let me check,\" he said.\n\nUefa's disciplinary rules prohibit \"the use of gestures, words, objects or any other means to transmit a provocative message that is not fit for a sports event, particularly provocative messages that are of a political, ideological, religious or offensive nature\".\n\nTwo Turkish-origin internationals who play for Germany - Ilkay G\u00fcndogan and Emre Can - posted likes in response to the Instagram photo of Tosun and his saluting team-mates. But G\u00fcndogan and Can later removed their posts.\n\nIn May 2018 G\u00fcndogan - a Manchester City star - and Mesut \u00d6zil of Arsenal were criticised by the German Football Federation (DFB) for posing in photos with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.", "description": "Players salute their nation's troops fighting in Syria during an international match with Albania.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0F02/production/_109224830_turkeyplayers11octgetty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
