Rebecca Sheppard is one of the strike\u2019s organizers\n\nSince late last year, a group of workers within Amazon have been organizing to push the company to radically reduce its carbon emissions. Yesterday, they announced a major new action: on 20 September, Amazon workers around the world will walk out of their offices to join the Global Climate Strike. So far, over 1,000 workers have pledged to participate. The organizers have three demands. They want the company to commit to zero emissions by 2030, to have zero custom cloud computing contracts with fossil fuel companies, and to spend zero dollars on funding climate-denying lobbyists and politicians.\n\nSilicon Valley revolt: meet the tech workers fighting their bosses over Ice, censorship and racism Read more\n\nI spoke to one of the walkout\u2019s organizers, a 28-year-old Amazon employee in Seattle named Rebecca Sheppard. We spoke about the origins of climate organizing within Amazon, the goals of the walkout, and how the campaign connects to the wider tech worker movement.\n\nWhat do you do at Amazon?\n\nI\u2019m a senior product manager for Amazon Air. I work out of the Seattle headquarters, and I\u2019ve been here for nearly three years.\n\nWhat is Amazon Air?\n\nIn 2013, Amazon had an issue with third-party carriers getting packages to people\u2019s homes in time for Christmas. So the company began building its own cargo airline, Amazon Air. We currently have 40 airplanes, and the plan is to expand to 70 by 2021.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s CEO, in January 2018.

But eventually I became frustrated, because no matter how efficiently you\u2019re using the aircraft, the aircraft itself remains the same. It\u2019s still burning fossil fuels. Planes today are still unsustainable even if you\u2019re trying to use them as efficiently as possible. And sustainability is a very personal issue for me.\n\nHow so?\n\nI grew up in Wilmington, North Carolina. It\u2019s a coastal town so I\u2019ve been watching hurricanes roll in my whole life. My very first driving lesson my dad had me drive through a hurricane. I grew up acutely aware of the climate crisis, because I watched the hurricanes in my hometown get worse.\n\nHow did you decide to take action on climate within Amazon?\n\nLast year, I was feeling hopeless, unmotivated and frankly ashamed of the role I was playing at Amazon Air enabling carbon emissions. I have a beautiful three-year-old nephew, and I was afraid of what his world was going to look like in 50 years, given how much worse it had gotten in my 28 years.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rebecca Sheppard: \u2018As soon as Greta Thunberg called for a global climate strike, we wanted to know how we could help.\u2019 Photograph: Courtesy Rebecca Sheppard\n\nThen I heard about the shareholder resolution for Amazon to take climate action. In late 2018, a group of Amazon employees announced they would bring a resolution to the next shareholder meeting that would commit the company to develop a plan for transitioning off of fossil fuels. As employees, they had received equity in Amazon, so they had a right to submit a resolution as shareholders. This is the group that became Amazon Employees for Climate Justice (AECJ).\n\nWhen I heard about the resolution, I was inspired.\n\nWhat was the response from management to the announcement of the resolution?\n\nAECJ members met with Amazon leadership in early 2019. At the first meeting, employees asked leadership when Amazon was going to publicly commit to reduce its emissions and share its carbon footprint. They said they had no plans to do either of those things.\n\nThat\u2019s when AECJ began drafting the first version of our open letter to Jeff Bezos. The week after leadership found out this letter was being circulated internally, Amazon announced Shipment Zero, our company\u2019s first ever commitment to reduce shipping emissions. This was a total U-turn, and it was clearly done in response to our letter. The very next day, management asked AECJ to withdraw our shareholder resolution because of Shipment Zero.\n\nShipment Zero commits Amazon to making 50% of its shipments net zero carbon by 2030. Shipment Zero only applies to the emissions associated with delivering packages, not with the many data centers run by Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nA lot of people don\u2019t realize the strength they can wield in their workplace. I certainly didn't\n\nIn the very same week that Amazon announced Shipment Zero, we learned from an investigative piece at Gizmodo that AWS is creating custom solutions and entering into custom contracts with oil and gas companies to use our cloud services to identify new fossil fuel reserves and to facilitate faster extraction. In other words, management told us they cared about the climate at the exact same time as they were doing deals with the fossil fuel industry.\n\nBecause of this, we refused to withdraw the resolution. Instead, we updated our open letter to Bezos to include commentary on the oil and gas contracts, and urged him to take action on the issues outlined in the resolution. We released this letter publicly in April 2019, and so far over 8,300 Amazon workers have signed it.\n\nIn May 2019, AECJ members brought the climate plan resolution to the annual shareholders meeting in Seattle. The resolution did not receive enough votes to pass, but AECJ members delivered a speech at the meeting and held a press conference. Tell me about that experience.\n\nAll of us stood up while our coworker from AECJ presented our resolution. She addressed Bezos directly and asked him to come onstage, which he declined to do. She read our request for Amazon to commit to a carbon plan and to release its carbon footprint. Then she asked everyone who supported the resolution to stand up with us. Almost everyone in the room did, not just the Amazon employees. It was a very emotional moment in what is typically a very unemotional space.\n\nThe walkout\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Amazon Spheres, part of the company\u2019s headquarters, are seen from 6th Avenue in Seattle. Photograph: Lindsey Wasson/Reuters\n\nYesterday, AECJ publicly announced the next step in its campaign: a walkout by Amazon employees all over the world to join the youth-led global climate strike on 20 September. How did you put this action together?\n\nAs soon as Greta Thunberg called for a global climate strike, AECJ members wanted to know how we could help. We also needed to escalate our campaign. We\u2019ve been seeing management listen but we haven\u2019t seen management understand. They\u2019re not giving us concrete commitments. They\u2019re not feeling the urgency.\n\nWhy do a walkout? Why did you choose this tactic?\n\nWalking out is a symbol of employees coming together. It\u2019s also a way of celebrating how large AECJ has become, and signaling to management and to one another that this has gone on for too long. That business as usual is not cutting it.\n\nThe response so far has been incredible. Since we first announced the walkout internally last Wednesday, over 1,000 Amazon employees have pledged to walk out. And the number is growing fast.\n\nYou said that systemic change requires collective action. How does the walkout demonstrate that idea?\n\nA lot of people don\u2019t realize the strength they can wield in their workplace. I certainly didn\u2019t.\n\nAmazon is not Jeff Bezos alone. Amazon is Amazon because of the workers who work for it. It needs all of us to function, from the people in the offices writing software to the people in the warehouses packing boxes. When you realize that, you realize the power is not at the top. It\u2019s at the bottom, collectively, with all of the people working together to keep the company running.\n\nThe statement that AECJ released yesterday to announce the walkout puts forward three climate demands for Amazon. Let\u2019s start with the first one: you want the company to commit to zero emissions by 2030.\n\nThis is our number one request. The scientific consensus is that we need to cut global emissions to net zero by 2050 to limit global temperature rise to 1.5C. But in the US and global north, we need to cut our emissions even faster. Why? Because we have been polluting more than our fair share and we have a responsibility to take more aggressive action. We also have the resources to develop the new technologies that will be needed to facilitate the transition and to make such technologies readily accessible around the world.\n\nYour second demand is for zero custom AWS contracts for fossil fuel companies.\n\nScientists have told us that the amount of oil and gas that we can safely continue to extract is zero. The fact that Amazon is not only using these fuels but partnering with companies to help them accelerate extraction and find new sources of oil is really alarming.\n\nAnd your third demand is for the company to stop funding politicians and lobbyists who deny the science on climate change.\n\nI was shocked to learn that Amazon funds climate denial. The most egregious example is the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), a thinktank that has long challenged climate science. Moreover, Amazon donated to sixty-eight members of Congress in 2018 who voted against climate legislation 100% of the time.\n\nThe Tech Worker Movement\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Demonstrators hold images of Bezos near their faces during a Halloween-themed protest at Amazon headquarters over the company\u2019s facial recognition system last year. Photograph: Elaine Thompson/AP\n\nClimate isn\u2019t the only issue that Amazon workers are organizing around. Since last year, workers have been pushing the company to stop selling AWS services to Palantir and other firms who enable US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), as well as to stop selling facial recognition software to law enforcement \u2013 a campaign now known internally as We Won\u2019t Build It. Meanwhile, workers at Amazon warehouses in Minnesota have conducted three different strikes for better working conditions this year. What is the relationship between these actions and the work that AECJ is doing?\n\nAll of these fights are connected. I have a lot of respect for the We Won\u2019t Build It campaign \u2013 I proudly wear its pin to work. And I have an immense amount of respect for the Minnesota workers.\n\nWhen you see workers at other companies taking a stand, you want to take a stand yourself\n\nWhen the workers at the Shakopee, Minnesota, fulfillment center announced they would be striking on Prime Day, AECJ gathered statements of solidarity from Amazon employees in corporate offices around the world. AECJ members then brought these statements to Shakopee personally to show their support.\n\nIf we didn\u2019t have fulfillment workers, then I couldn\u2019t do my job. Our work is completely dependent on theirs. And it takes a whole lot more bravery for them to speak up than it does for people like me.\n\nWhat about the relationship of the AECJ to the wider tech worker movement that has emerged over the past year or two?\n\nTech workers at a number of companies are organizing to oppose contracts with Ice and US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) under the banner of #TechWontBuildIt. Last year at Google, workers forced management to cancel its contract with the Pentagon for Project Maven, a program that uses machine learning to improve targeting for drone strikes. Then came the Google walkout, a global work stoppage by 20,000 Googlers to protest sexism and discrimination in the workplace. How does AECJ and your upcoming walkout fit into this broader picture?\n\nI\u2019ve been incredibly inspired by the Google walkout and the #TechWontBuildIt campaigns. It\u2019s like there\u2019s been an awakening. Previously, people might\u2019ve been comfortable looking the other way or putting their head in the sand. Not anymore. More and more people are standing up and saying, \u201cThis isn\u2019t right.\u201d And if one person says that, and then finds someone else who agrees with them, that\u2019s all you need to start a movement.\n\nWhen I hear about actions at other tech companies, I\u2019m inspired. It\u2019s a reminder that we have power. And that our power comes from standing together in solidarity. Moral fortitude is contagious. When you see workers at other companies taking a stand, you want to take a stand yourself.\n\nIf other tech workers are reading this conversation, what would you say to them? How would you persuade them to get involved?\n\nBeing a tech worker doesn\u2019t insulate you from climate impacts.\n\nThe fulfillment workers in Minnesota are striking for bathroom breaks. We\u2019re not asking for bathroom breaks because yes, we have bathroom breaks. Actually, most of us love our jobs. What we\u2019re asking for is a future.\n\nLast year, I lived on Bainbridge Island outside of Seattle. I would take a ferry into work every morning. And at one point, the wildfires were so bad I couldn\u2019t breathe. Everyone was wearing face masks. That isn\u2019t the world I want to live in, where we\u2019ve poisoned the air so badly that it poisons us.\n\nI remember learning about global warming in school. I remember thinking that all these problems would be fixed by the time I graduated from college because we have leaders. I grew up waiting for them to fix this. They didn\u2019t. Then I changed how I thought about who leaders are. Greta Thunberg is a leader. The over 8,300 Amazon workers who signed the open letter to Bezos, those are leaders. Those of us who are walking out of our offices on 20 September, we are leaders.", "description": "On 20 September, more than 1,000 Amazon staffers will walk out of their offices to demand action.
