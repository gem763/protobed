Stop the crimes against people of faith. Release prisoners of conscience. Repeal laws restricting freedom of religion and belief. Protect the vulnerable, the defenseless, and the oppressed,\" Trump said. \"We must all work together to protect communities of every faith...Approximately 80-percent of the world\u2019s population live in countries where religious liberty is threatened, restricted, or even banned.\"\n\n\"True tolerance means respecting the right of all people to express their deeply-held religious beliefs,\" he continued. \"We ask the governments of the world to honor the eternal right of every person to follow their conscience, live by their faith, and give glory to God.\"\n\nThis was the first time a U.S. president has hosted an event solely focused on religious freedom at UNGA, which is consistent with the Trump administration's work on the issue.\n\n\"As President, protecting religious freedom is one of my highest priorities,\" he said. \"Our Founders understood that no right is more fundamental to a peaceful, prosperous, and virtuous society than the right to follow one\u2019s religious convictions.\"\n\n\n\n\"America will always be a voice for victims of religious persecution everywhere,\" he continued.\n\n\n\nPastor Andrew Brunson, who was held hostage for his Christian beliefs in Turkey for two years, was in attendance. Vice President Mike Pence attended and gave remarks before the President's speech.", "description": ".09/23/2019 15:09:33PM EST.", "authors": ["Katie Pavlich", "Guy Benson", "Cortney O'Brien", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/57/a7a051b8-13bf-4f28-8bb1-ec7f87342a40.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
