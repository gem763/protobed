(NOAA/RAMMB)\n\nHUNTSVILLE, Alabama \u2014 The acting administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Neil Jacobs, defended his agency at a major weather industry conference on Tuesday morning in an emotional speech, as controversy swirls over how agency officials responded to President Trump\u2019s inaccurate claim on Sept. 1 that Alabama \u201cwould most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated\u201d by Hurricane Dorian.\n\nJacobs defended the agency\u2019s unusual, unsigned statement released on Sept. 6, which backed Trump\u2019s false claim about Alabama and admonished the Weather Service\u2019s Birmingham division for speaking \u201cin absolute terms.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have the utmost respect for what you do because I understand how difficult numerical weather prediction is, and how even more complicated conveying risk to the public is. The purpose of the NOAA statement was to clarify the technical aspects of the potential impacts of Dorian,\" Jacobs said. \"What it did not say, however, is that we understand and fully support the good intent of the Birmingham weather office, which was to calm fears and support public safety.\u201d\n\nRegarding impacts from Hurricane Dorian, Jacobs said, \u201cAt one point Alabama was in the mix, as was the rest of the Southeast.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt one point the Gulf states were at greater risk than the Atlantic coast,\u201d Jacobs said.\n\n[NOAA staff warned in Sept. 1 directive against contradicting Trump]\n\nThe NOAA statement on Sept. 1 resulted in part from pressure that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross brought to bear on Jacobs in an early morning phone call on Friday from Greece, where the secretary was traveling for meetings, according to three people who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nAccording to a federal official with knowledge of the matter, Ross wanted NOAA to issue a statement backing the president\u2019s contention that Alabama was forecast to be impacted by the hurricane, even if it was outside the official forecast cone. NOAA is a Commerce Department agency.\n\nRoss\u2019 involvement in the statement was first reported by the New York Times.\n\nAccording to two people, Jacobs initially resisted issuing such a statement and also tried to block the inclusion of a paragraph that called out the Birmingham Weather Service office for its tweet that many perceived as correcting Trump. The acting NOAA head lost both those arguments.\n\nTrump has maintained that he was correct in saying Alabama was at direct risk of significant impacts from Dorian, despite the lack of evidence to support his claim. At the time of his first tweet mentioning Alabama, the NWS\u2019s forecast guidance showed only a very small risk (about 5 percent) of tropical-storm-force winds for a small portion of Alabama. However, Alabama was not in the storm forecast track or \u201ccone of uncertainty\u201d from the National Hurricane Center, which showed Hurricane Dorian skirting the East Coast far away from Alabama.\n\nThe NWS\u2019s Birmingham office quickly set the record straight, stating Alabama \u201cwould NOT see any impacts\u201d from the storm. NWS Director Louis Uccellini said Monday that the Birmingham office was responding to an influx of calls from concerned residents that began after Trump sent the tweet, but that the Alabama forecasters only learned that Trump\u2019s tweet was what instigated the calls after they sent their tweet.\n\nJacobs seemed to dispute some of the reporting about the Trump administration pulling strings to get NOAA to correct its forecast, thereby putting politics above science.\n\n\u201cThere is no pressure to change the way you communicate forecast risk into the future. No one\u2019s job is under threat: not mine, not yours,\" Jacobs said. \"The Weather Service team has my full support and the support of the department.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is hard for me. This is hard for my friends and this is hard for my family. I want to thank everyone who has known me and supported me. I\u2019m the same Neil I was last Thursday,\u201d Jacobs said, referring to the day before NOAA issued its statement, which many meteorologists interpreted as throwing the Birmingham Weather Service office under the bus.\n\nDr Neil Jacobs, NOAA Acting Administrator, delivered the keynote at #NWAS2019 today. You could hear a pin drop. He is a good man placed in a horrible situation. I have real compassion for him and his family. https://t.co/qoWW6c8cRw pic.twitter.com/rBeyc7Yuxn \u2014 James Spann (@spann) September 10, 2019\n\n\u201cWeather should not be a partisan issue. I\u2019ve known some of you for more than 25 years. I haven\u2019t changed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you for the job you do and thank you for the lives you saved,\" he said.\n\nHinting that NOAA was not involved in briefing Trump on the potential path of Hurricane Dorian, which may have led to the president perceiving a far greater threat to Alabama on Sept. 1 than there actually was, Jacobs said: \"Moving forward from Dorian: What did I learn over the last week? From now on, the National Weather Service should be at the table with emergency managers and FEMA at all briefings. This is critically important if we are going to be analyzing the forecast outlook. We need somebody there who understands how to interpret it.\u201d\n\nJacobs took no questions, and was ushered out of the room by security guards.\n\nDr. Neil Jacobs just spoke at #nwas19 morning keynote. Addressed the #Dorian messaging issue between NWS and NOAA statement. It was a difficult speech to deliver to a room full of meteorologists....steady cadence, but emotion in the words spoken... pic.twitter.com/8EwGjcAQKf \u2014 Alan Holt (@AlanSHolt) September 10, 2019\n\nKevin Laws, the head of operations for the Birmingham National Weather Service forecast office at the heart of the firestorm said he appreciated Jacobs\u2019 comments, and his willingness to address the controversy.\n\n\u201cI think it took a lot of courage for him to stand up there today,\u201d said Laws, who said he has known Jacobs since college. \u201cIt could not have been easy. He\u2019s a scientist, and he\u2019s been in our shoes.\u201d\n\nJacobs took to the stage one day after NWS Director Louis Uccellini used broke ranks with NOAA leadership, issuing a strong defense of his employees, particularly those at the Birmingham forecast office, during a speech at the same conference.\n\n[NOAA\u2019s chief scientist will investigate why agency backed Trump over its experts on Dorian, email shows]\n\n\u201cThey did what any office would do,\u201d Uccellini told the crowd of hundreds of meteorologists. \u201cWith an emphasis they deemed essential, they shut down what they thought were rumors. They quickly acted to reassure their partners, the media and the public \u2014 with strong language \u2014 that there was no threat.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey did that with one thing in mind: public safety,\u201d Uccellini said. \u201cAnd they responded not knowing where this information was coming from. Only later, [when] the retweets and the politically based comments came into their office, did they learn the source of this information.\u201d\n\nUccellini noted the strong relationships the Birmingham office has with local emergency officials, particularly in the wake of tornadoes that killed 23 in the region in March. He said these emergency officials praised the Birmingham weather team\u2019s speed in quashing the false information.\n\n\u201cLet me be clear: The Birmingham office did this to stop public panic,\u201d he said, and \u201cto ensure public safety.\u201d\n\nCalls for investigations\n\nOn Tuesday, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) wrote to the Commerce Department inspector general\u2019s office seeking an investigation into violations of NOAA\u2019s scientific integrity policy.\n\n\u201cI am deeply troubled that NOAA is politicizing weather prediction critical for the protection of life and property in contravention of internal operations services and policy directives,\u201d Shaheen wrote. She is the ranking Democratic member on the Commerce, Justice and State Appropriations Subcommittee, which oversees NOAA\u2019s budget.\n\nShe wrote that the NOAA statement was \u201creleased... to defend the President\u2019s position, while ignoring the best available science.\u201d\n\nThe agency\u2019s scientific integrity policy includes a provision prohibiting \u201cany NOAA official\u201d from asking or directing other NOAA employees to \u201csuppress or alter scientific findings,\u201d Shaheen\u2019s letter states.\n\nOn Sunday, acting NOAA chief scientist Craig McLean sent an email to colleagues announcing the opening of an investigation into whether the agency\u2019s Sept. 6 statement, as well as previous emails to NWS staff, violated the agency\u2019s scientific integrity policy. McLean said the Sept. 6 statement and other actions prioritized politics over NOAA\u2019s mission.\n\n\u201cThe NWS Forecaster(s) corrected any public misunderstanding in an expert and timely way, as they should,\u201d McLean wrote in an email to NOAA employees that was obtained by The Post. \u201cThere followed, last Friday, an unsigned news release from 'NOAA\u2019 that inappropriately and incorrectly contradicted the NWS forecaster. My understanding is that this intervention to contradict the forecaster was not based on science but on external factors including reputation and appearance, or simply put, political.\u201d\n\nIn response to McLean\u2019s email, NOAA spokesman Scott Smullen stated: \u201cNOAA\u2019s policies on scientific integrity and communications are among the strongest in the federal government, and get high marks from third party observers. The agency\u2019s senior career leaders are free to express their opinions about matters of agency operations and science. The agency will not be providing further official comment, and will not speculate on internal reviews.\u201d\n\nMatt Lanza, a meteorologist who co-authors a Houston-based weather blog called Space City Weather, described a strong sense of solidarity among all of the forecasters present at the conference.\n\n\u201cMeteorologists are a small, tightknit community, and so if you come after one of us, you come after all of us,\u201d Lanza said. \u201cYou know we all have differing beliefs, but when it comes to getting the science right, and getting the forecast right, there\u2019s no ambiguity there. It\u2019s gotta be right, and it\u2019s gotta be the best information at the time.\u201d\n\nJuliet Eilperin and Jason Samenow contributed to this article.", "description": "Amid a controversy over his agency\u2019s response to President Trump\u2019s tweet, Neil Jacobs assures the audience full of meteorologists that no one\u2019s job is at risk.", "authors": ["Kate Harrison Belz", "Andrew Freedman", "Editor Focusing On Extreme Weather", "Climate Change", "Science", "The Environment.", "September At Pm", "Andrew Freedman Edits", "Reports On Weather", "Extreme Weather"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/kQCso98jOGkmOTc9hfSlGydUsOM=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/D2RJSBBJSJHILN2XJ3O5GQIKBA.png", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
