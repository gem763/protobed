Eastern hognose snakes live in North America. Average adults reach 28 inches in length. They scare off predators by striking or pretending to be dead. Its venom is not fatal to humans.\n\n'Once I began to pick him up, he started to play dead by rolling over,' Mr Brower said.\n\n'When I flipped him right side up he would roll back over onto his back again. He was also leaving his mouth open with his tongue hanging out.'\n\n'While playing dead they also secrete a musk-like smell and spit up a bit of blood.'\n\n'This guy did both, but it isn't really visible in the video.'\n\nIn the footage captured by Mr Brower, the snake\u2019s faked death throes last a full 15 seconds before it finally stops squirming.\n\nThen, when he picked the snake up and put it down again, the reptile next agonised for nearly 50 seconds before playing dead.\n\nMr Brower used to work in the reptile house at Washington DC's National Zoo and ha some knowledge of eastern hognose snakes and how they behave.\n\nPhil Brower, 41, encountered the eastern hognose snake near his home in Poolesville, in the US state of Maryland, while hunting for deer\n\n'When he first saw me he did in fact try to get away. This is usually their first choice if possible,' said Mr Brower.\n\n'Playing dead is another form of defence for the snake. They usually only do this if they can't escape.'\n\n'The idea is to look dead and smell bad in hopes that whatever is bothering them will go away.'\n\nThis species known to play dead when it feels threatened, rolling onto its back with its mouth agape and tongue hanging out\n\nThe snake found by Mr Brower appeared to precede its 'demise' \u2014 which it acted out twice \u2014 with death throws that were borderline operatic\n\n'I'd say I'm pretty impressed with its acting abilities,' Mr Brower said.\n\n'It certainly throws a lot into the act to try to persuade a would-be predator to go away.'\n\n'[I] don't think it's over dramatic, considering [snakes] only do it when they feel their life is in danger.'", "description": "Phil Brower, 41, encountered the eastern hognose snake near his home in\u00a0Poolesville, in the US state of Maryland, while hunting for deer.", "authors": ["Ian Randall For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/14/20035706-0-image-a-25_1571749951169.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
