This will work in a similar way to how we target child sexual exploitation material by working with online content hosts to find and remove harmful content,\u201d Ardern said.\n\nChristchurch massacre: defence lawyers drop request to move trial away from city Read more\n\nThe package is the main domestic component of Ardern\u2019s Christchurch Call \u2013 a global voluntary pledge to eliminate terrorist and violent content online devised in the wake of the attack.\n\nThe country\u2019s worst ever mass shooting was livestreamed on Facebook, and the video was shared on Twitter, YouTube and Facebook-owned apps Whatsapp and Instagram.\n\nArdern said the online world must be a force for good where users can \u201cexchange ideas, share technology, and maintain civil liberties\u201d but \u201cwe need to meet that challenge as a country and as a global community,\u201d.\n\nMinister of internal affairs Tracey Martin said the \u201cease and speed\u201d with which the video of the 15 March massacre spread online showed the government needed better systems in place to protect New Zealanders online.\n\nSome of the funding would also be directed to the office of the chief censor to enable his team to assess and make faster decisions about harmful content.\n\nIn the long-term, the government would also strengthen the current laws to ensure it responds more swiftly, and explore how online providers should be regulated.\n\n'It brings everything back': Christchurch despairs over white supremacist attacks Read more\n\nLast week Ardern said the Christchurch Call was already having an impact, citing the contained spread of the recent German shooting livestream video.\n\nMore than 50 companies and countries have signed the Christchurch Call, including Amazon, Google, Facebook and Twitter.\n\nThe pledge does not contain any enforcement or regulatory measures, and it is up to each individual country and company to decide how it would honour its voluntary commitments.", "description": "Jacinda Ardern says government will double its investigative operation and track down content in a similar manner to child abuse material", "authors": ["Eleanor Ainge Roy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe7006651b5eecca32b8fc35193f486f5ba293b4/0_156_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7646a93389abcba83a128f58be3a345e", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
