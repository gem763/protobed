And he has delivered, winning three NBA championships and four NBA MVP awards, among many other accolades. He\u2019s also capitalized on his success as much as any other athlete today, realizing that with his fame and wealth he could do more than just invest in others.\n\nIn the recently published biography of James, LeBron, Inc.: The Making of a Billion-Dollar Athlete, ESPN\u2019s Brian Windhorst, who has covered James since he was a high-school freshman, outlines the biggest financial wins of LeBron James\u2019s career.\n\nBy making timely investments and leveraging his influence, James, 34, has become one of the wealthiest athletes in the world. According to Forbes, James was the world\u2019s 8th highest-paid athlete last year, when he made $89 million \u2014 $36 million from salary and $53 million from endorsements. And he\u2019s estimated to have a net worth of $450 million.\n\nHere are James\u2019s four most successful investments.\n\nChoosing Nike over Reebok\n\nCatherine Steenkeste Lebron James presenting a new Nike shoe in Paris.\n\nAs the most hyped young basketball player in decades, James was drafted first overall In the 2003 NBA Draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers straight from high school. Shoe companies were eager to ink James to one of the biggest endorsement contracts ever.\n\nTo illustrate just how famous James was as a teen, celebrities attended his Catholic high school games, and he was on the cover of Sports Illustrated at 17-years-old. Shoe executives were desperate for James to wear their brand\u2019s logos.\n\nAmong the companies offering him a contract were Adidas ADDYY, +0.48% at $60 million, Nike NKE, -0.78% at $87 million and Reebok at a whopping $115 million, per Brian Windhorst.\n\nIn 2002, Nike was the leading shoe brand in the NBA coming off a lucrative partnership with Michael Jordan. James had dreams of wearing the swoosh, but to do so meant passing up an extra $28 million.\n\nReebok wanted to add James to its collection of star athletes that included Shaquille O\u2019Neal, Allen Iverson and Venus Williams. After a long period of pitch meetings and private jet rides for him and his friends, James chose to accept the lower offer from Nike. Brian Windhorst wrote that James sided with who he thought would be a better long-term partner in Nike over a higher initial offer from Reebok.\n\nAnd James clearly made the right decision. His most recent contract with Nike (while the exact terms are not fully known) is reportedly a lifetime deal that could exceed $1 billion. Meanwhile, as of 2019, Reebok doesn\u2019t currently sponsor any NBA players.\n\nAsking for an ownership stake in Beats by Dre\n\nJesse D. Garrabrant LeBron James and two teammates wearing Beats headphones that James gifted to members of Team USA at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\n\nIn 2006, music mogul Jimmy Iovine and his friend Andre Young, more commonly known by his rapper name Dr. Dre, started a headphones company called \u201cBeats by Dre.\u201d Iovine and Dre wanted to partner with James in an effort to boost sales. But Beats had a hard time gaining momentum in the mid 2000s.\n\nJames, a hip-hop junkie, was interested in working with the brand, according to Windhorst. But instead of just securing a typical sponsorship deal with Beats where he could be seen wearing the headphones in public, James and his team went another route.\n\nJames and his business manager Maverick Carter secured a partnership that included elements of a traditional deal (commercials, etc), but also included an ownership stake in the company. This would become a common thread of James\u2019s business dealings over the years.\n\nCarter, who never graduated from college but frequently claims he got a degree at the \u201cUniversity of Nike\u201d after an internship at the company, didn't see James as just a basketball player, but as a brand.\n\nWindhorst details that through James\u2019s influence, Carter was able to befriend high-profile businessmen like Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway BRK.A, -0.64%, who only added to Carter\u2019s already savvy business acumen.\n\nCarter and James didn\u2019t just want to be used by large corporations to promote products. They wanted to be partners \u2014 and they wanted ownership. James knew his brand was so strong that leveraging his influence for an ownership stake would see the most returns. James eventually agreed to a deal where he would promote Beats in exchange for a small piece of ownership.\n\nOne major factor in the ascension of Beats was the 2008 Beijing Olympics. While Beats was not an official sponsor of the Olympics, Carter and James deployed a one-of-a-kind marketing campaign in China.\n\nWindhorst writes that Carter was acutely aware that athletes, especially basketball players, had a virtual fashion runway when they moved in and our of venues, not unlike Hollywood celebrities. Knowing the Team USA basketball team were the biggest celebrities in Bejing, Windhorst claims it was Carter who told James to gift each of his teammates a pair of Beats headphones.\n\nFor the entirety of the Olympic games, these fifteen extremely tall and famous men strolled around Olympic village and parts of China with the headphones around their neck.\n\nBeats eventually was purchased by Apple AAPL, -0.13% for $3 billion, netting James an estimated $50 million from the sale, according to Windhorst.\n\nInvesting in Blaze Pizza\n\nVince Talotta Blaze Pizza employees making customized pizza.\n\nFast food brands have been endorsing athletes for decades. Big chains like McDonald\u2019s MCD, -0.64% have famously made commercials featuring NBA stars Michael Jordan and Larry Bird, and tennis\u2019 Williams sisters, among others.\n\nJames too had been in a number of McDonald\u2019s commercials \u2014 he was their top athlete for many years. According to Windhorst, when his latest McDonald\u2019s contract was set to expire in 2017, James declined a lucrative $15 million extension to fully commit to his 2012 investment in pizza chain start-up Blaze Pizza.\n\nSimilar to his agreement with Beats, James was interested in an ownership stake. James was able to buy into the company at a heavily discounted rate in exchange for his influence, per Windhorst. James\u2019s initial investment amount is unknown, but Windhorst writes that James was also given ownership of two franchise locations. According to Forbes, he now owns 21 franchises.\n\nBlaze Pizza soon became the fastest growing restaurant chain of all time, according to Forbes. As of 2017, James\u2019s investment in Blaze Pizza was reportedly worth \u2018at least\u2019 $40 million, per ESPN.\n\nJames later said of his investment, \u201cI was like, \u2018Who doesn\u2019t like pizza?\u2019 I don\u2019t know a single person in the world who doesn\u2019t like pizza.\u201d\n\nAcquiring a 2% stake in Liverpool F.C.\n\nAndrew Powell LeBron James and business partner Maverick Carter watch a Liverpool F.C. match in Liverpool, England.\n\nJames has openly spoken about his desire to own an NBA team one day, but current NBA rules prohibit active players from owning any part of NBA franchises. Because James\u2019s hunger to own a sports team cannot currently be satisfied by the NBA, he looked towards Europe.\n\nIn 2011, James acquired a minority stake in Liverpool F.C., an English Premier League soccer club. James \u2018acquired\u2019 his 2% stake in the soccer club rather than \u2018purchased\u2019 it because James was able to work out a deal with the club majority owners (Fenway Sports Group) where he didn\u2019t actually have to risk any money.\n\nFenway Sports Group (FSG) and James made a deal where the NBA star agreed to be added to their official client list that they used to recruit new clients. James also agreed to allow FSG to pitch him other business deals where they would earn a commission. In exchange, James and his business partner Maverick Carter were given a 2% stake in Liverpool.\n\nFSG wanted so badly to be in the LeBron James business, they gave up equity in their team for what amounted to commission checks on partnerships they got for James that included Dunkin\u2019 Donuts and the Swiss watchmaker Audemars Piguet, according to Windhorst.\n\nSince the agreement, Liverpool F.C won the UEFA Champions League tournament and is now worth upwards of $1.9 billion, four times what FSG paid for it. James and Carter\u2019s stake in the club is valued at over $30 million.\n\nAfter the deal with Liverpool was reached, James traveled to England to watch a Liverpool match. James met with all of the players and gifted them a pair of special edition Beats headphones.", "description": "A look at the 4 best financial decisions LeBron James has made.", "authors": ["Weston Blasi"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ319_lebron_ZG_20190828142017.jpg"}
