REUTERS/Ints Kalnins/File Photo\n\nDanske Bank (DANSKE.CO), Denmark\u2019s biggest bank, is under investigation over suspicious payments totaling 200 billion euros ($220 billion) which were moved through its Estonian branch. It was ordered to close the branch earlier this year.\n\nThe scandal has tarnished the reputation of the Baltic state, known as a hub for digital innovation, prompting government reform pledges last October which have yet to result in new legislation.\n\nIn April, Estonian Prime Minister Juri Ratas entered a coalition with the country\u2019s far-right EKRE party, whose popularity rose in elections. The EKRE party\u2019s Martin Helme, who is anti-immigration and a eurosceptic, became finance minister.\n\n\u201cBefore the election, the finance minister was very vocal about money laundering,\u201d said Kaja Kallas, the leader of the center-right Reform Party. \u201cIn reality, he has done nothing.\u201d\n\nMaris Lauri, the deputy chairman of the Estonian parliament\u2019s finance committee and a former minister of finance, said reform was delayed and blamed Helme.\n\n\u201cHis position is that Estonia should not adopt EU rules,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is very clearly anti-EU and that stance is the reason for the delay in the money laundering rules.\u201d\n\nHelme told Reuters that seeing through money laundering reforms was a priority that he took \u201cvery seriously\u201d.\n\nEU-WIDE REFORMS\n\nEstonia, like other EU members, is obliged to adopt a raft of European-Union-wide reforms by January to make it easier to combat money laundering by sharing intelligence internationally and showing who really owns companies and trusts.\n\nBut lawmakers in Estonia believe that time is running out to sign off on the rules in time because the parliament in Tallinn has yet to see much of the proposed legislation.\n\nOther EU countries have also been slow to tackle the problem, but Estonia is under particular pressure to act because money laundering happened on its doorstep.\n\nSome of the changes have wide support, such as introducing higher penalties for money laundering related offences.\n\nA central element of reform, requiring bank customers to prove money is honestly earned rather than ask authorities to prove it was not, is contested and is set to be shelved for the time being.\n\nHelme said he planned to introduce the EU law on time and make fines steeper but said he had first done a legal analysis to make sure the legal changes were \u201chigh quality\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are making Estonian law more effective to better counter money laundering and increasing the capabilities of the authorities,\u201d he said.\n\nAivar Kokk, who, as chair of the Estonian parliament\u2019s finance committee plays a central role in passing the law, acknowledged that the new finance minister had needed time to get up to speed.\n\n\u201cWhen you go to a new field ... maybe you are a bit more skeptical,\u201d said Kokk. \u201cIt is said that a good leader will get up to speed in six months. This six months is coming up soon.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\n\u201cWe will transpose the European Union law,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we cannot guarantee that the bill will be adopted by January or February. There is a new government who wants to review all the bills again.\u201d\n\nThe EKRE party will tread cautiously, aware that many of its supporters are eurosceptic.\n\nAnti Poolamets, a prominent member of Helme\u2019s EKRE party, said: \u201cIt is important for Estonia to maintain sovereignty for ourselves ... and not hand over all these powers to the European institutions.\u201d", "description": "Estonia's far-right finance minister has been criticized by lawmakers for holding up financial reforms promised after the Baltic state became the focus of Europe's biggest money laundering scandal.", "authors": ["John O", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444901367&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O1AN", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
