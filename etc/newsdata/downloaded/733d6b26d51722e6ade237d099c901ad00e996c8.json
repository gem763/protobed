In an uncomfortable press conference following a meeting in Dublin, he indicated his full support for Johnson over Brexit.\n\n\u201cLet me be clear: the US supports the UK decision to leave the EU in Brexit,\u201d he told Varadkar in a prepared statement. \u201cBut we also recognise the unique challenges on your northern border.\n\n\u201cAnd I can assure you we will continue to encourage the United Kingdom and Ireland to ensure that any Brexit respects the Good Friday agreement.\u201d\n\nBut instead of an expected anodyne statement designed to ensure his upcoming meeting with Johnson was not undermined, he went on to emphasise the US\u2019s clear support for the UK\u2019s position.\n\n\u201cAs the deadline for Brexit approaches we urge Ireland and the European Union, as well, to negotiate in good faith with Prime Minister Johnson, and work to reach an agreement that respects the United Kingdom\u2019s sovereignty and minimises the disruption to commerce,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe United States will look to play whatever hopeful role we can play.\n\n\u201cAs President Trump announced last week, when Brexit is complete, the United States will have a new trade agreement with the United Kingdom.\u201d\n\nHe went on to ask the taoiseach for his \u201ccontinued support for a new free trade agreement with the EU\u201d, reminding him: \u201cWhen Brexit is complete we will have a new free trade agreement with the UK.\u201d\n\nThe vice-president and the taoiseach held talks and had lunch with their families over an hour and a half at Farmleigh House in Dublin.\n\nVaradkar told reporters they had had a \u201cmarvellous meeting earlier\u201d but urged him to return to Washington with the message that peace was at risk in Northern Ireland.\n\nPlay Video 1:13 Irish PM Leo Varadkar: 'We will stand our ground over backstop \u2013 video\n\nHe told Pence that Brexit risked being \u201cdeeply disruptive especially for the people in Northern Ireland\u201d, and would risk creating barriers to free movement of people, north-south co-operation and peace.\n\n\u201cThe UK\u2019s decision to travel a different course to ours risks being deeply disruptive, especially for the people of Northern Ireland, where most people voted to stay in Europe.\n\n\u201cDivergence between the UK and the EU means that the return of a hard border on this island is a very real risk.\n\n\u201cThat is why we must stand our ground on the withdrawal agreement, an agreement which was carefully negotiated to overcome all these risks.\n\n\u201cAnd so Mr Vice-President I ask that you bring that message back to Washington with you. This is not a problem of our making,\u201d Varadkar told him.\n\nPence refused to take questions from dozens of assembled reporters.", "description": "US vice-president urges taoiseach and EU to negotiate with UK \u2018in good faith\u2019", "authors": ["Lisa O'Carroll", "Tom Kibasi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f666e3b2b819d89de867d10591e589d8c6f93c5a/0_27_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=46ba910873e5da71da4d6143d00f6e5c"}
