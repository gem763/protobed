Clearwater is home to one of the Church's most important bases, a campus called Flag (above), which Scientologists across the globe make pilgrimages to\n\nAnd Clearwater is home to one of the Church's most important bases, a campus called Flag, which established Scientologists from across the globe make pilgrimages to. Flag is run by the church\u2019s notorious full-time workforce, the Sea Org, whose members sign billion-year contracts.\n\nScientology founder L. Ron Hubbard called Clearwater its spiritual headquarters.\n\nThe Church's celebrity members Tom Cruise and John Travolta are known to have estates near Clearwater as well.\n\nBut just how has the church expanded at such an alarming rate? The reason lies in rising tensions between the church and the Clearwater City Council.\n\nScientology proposed a major redevelopment project meant to lure in new business to the empty stores in the city\u2019s waterfront area and near the church\u2019s headquarters, but the council interfered, botching plans for a land deal that the church wanted for its expansion plan.\n\nEver since then the church stopped communicating with the city, and the rapid land grab commenced.\n\nScientologists began to purchase properties through limited liability companies which are required by law to disclose their operators but not their owners. In this way Scientologists were able to buy properties without companies knowing they were behind it.\n\nOddly enough, half of those properties weren\u2019t on sale and half of the sales went for more than double the property\u2019s actual value. In six cases, buyers made four times the property\u2019s value deemed by the county property appraiser.\n\nBefore: This map shows the extent of Scientology owned property in downtown Clearwater Florida in 2016\n\nAfter: By 2019 the Church had greatly expanded, doubling its footprint and covering 101 acres of land\n\nThe Scientology Flag Building in Clearwater, Florida pictured above in 2013\n\nScientology's response to taking over Clearwater The Church of Scientology provided the following statement to DailyMail.com: 'The Times article is simply the latest in its continuing and unending obsession with Scientology and is little more than self-serving propaganda intended to give the appearance of objective reporting without reporting the actual facts to the reader. Were she in Utah, would the Times intrepid reporter have headlined that 'Mormons are buying up property in downtown Salt Lake City!' That point is brought home in an editorial ('One Community, Many Good People' ) in the new edition of our Freedom Magazine. 'The true story of downtown development is presented in an article in that Freedom, 'Who Is The Real Block To Downtown Revitalization?' You will discover the facts for yourself when you read that article; it provides the real answer as to what has happened with downtown revitalization\u2014and how that revitalization was torpedoed by the Times.' Freedom Magazine is a Scientology produced publication\n\nBut many of those purchased properties remain shuttered or in disuse. Walking through Clearwater people will find vacant lots, an empty former jewelry store, an dead laundromat and an abandoned Walgreens.\n\nThe Church has not revealed any motive behind their domination of downtown Clearwater.\n\nThe Church told DailyMail.com: 'The Times article is simply the latest in its continuing and unending obsession with Scientology and is little more than self-serving propaganda intended to give the appearance of objective reporting without reporting the actual facts to the reader.'\n\nScientology boasts 10million followers, but surveys and accounts from former members suggest there are no more than 30,000 worldwide. It's not clear how many followers are based in Clearwater.\n\nThe church\u2019s influence comes from its massive wealth, estimated around $3billion in cash and assets, collected from devoted followers.\n\nThe Church did however slam the Times for its reporting for having a 'preconceived agenda to present every Scientology story in a false and unfavorable light.'\n\n'There is nothing unnatural about Scientologists wanting to live in the same city that houses the international spiritual headquarters of their church,' a letter signed by Scientology attorney Gary Soter to the Times said.\n\nPeople arrive for the celebration of the opening of the new Scientology Flag Building on November 16, 2013 in Clearwater\n\nScientology boasts 10million followers, but surveys and accounts from former members suggest there are no more than 30,000 worldwide. Scientology hasn't answered directly why they've taken over the Clearwater area, but skeptics say it's to keep the public away. Scientology leader David Miscavige pictured above\n\n'The Church was unaware of the significant number of properties owned by Scientologists in the Clearwater area and are delighted you provided the information,' the letter added.\n\nThe Church didn't comment on whether Scientology orchestrated or paid for any of the real estate sales.\n\nThough most of the representatives of the 32 companies who purchased the downtown real estate in the past few years, few gave comment on their purchase and claimed Scientology wasn\u2019t a factor in the land buy.\n\n'I don\u2019t mix my personal business with other areas in my life,' Terri Novitsky, a Scientologist who manages a company that bought two office buildings on Chestnut Street in 2017, said.\n\nThe Church's celebrity members Tom Cruise and John Travolta are known to have estates in Clearwater not far from the Scientology headquarters\n\nThe few that chose to speak on selling their property said they were approached by a Scientologist who made offers and paid in cash.\n\nCity officials are suspicious that the church could be planning to do something with the land they now posses.\n\n'The logical conclusion is Scientology must have some sort of a game plan in mind, but they\u2019re not public with what it is,' City Council member Hoyt Hamilton said. 'Typically, when people buy commercial real estate, they move forward with construction or redevelopment. That\u2019s not happening with almost any of these properties.'\n\n'Ever since I\u2019ve been here, and ever since I\u2019ve dealt with Scientology officials, I have heard the leaders articulate that they want to see a vibrant downtown,,' Longtime City Manager Bill Horne, who wanted to turn downtown into a mall and entertainment center, said. 'However, it hasn\u2019t always been clear to me as to just what does that actually mean.'\n\nCritics of the church say that the Scientology bought the downtown properties to keep the public at bay.\n\n'They\u2019ve got one intention, and one intention only. Buy up as much property as they can for the church \u2014 whether they use it or not, whether they let it sit there and rot \u2014 so no one else can be there,' Tom De Vocht, a former Scientology executive who oversaw the church\u2019s property in Clearwater from 1996 to 2001, said.", "description": "The Church of Scientology doubled its footprint in Clearwater, Florida in a matter of just three years, after shelling out $103million to control 101 sweeping acres of the city's downtown.", "authors": ["Marlene Lenthang For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/08/20023562-0-image-a-56_1571728169812.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
