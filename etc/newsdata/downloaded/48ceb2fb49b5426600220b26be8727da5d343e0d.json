DoubleLine Capital LP is adviser to the Fund.\n\nDoubleLine Logo (PRNewsfoto/DoubleLine) More\n\nThe Fund's investment objective is to maximize total return through investment principally in income-producing securities. The Fund seeks to achieve this objective by investing in a portfolio of income-producing instruments selected for their potential to provide a high level of current income, capital appreciation or both. The Fund is benchmarked against the Bloomberg Barclays US Aggregate Bond Index.\n\nThe Fund constructs a portfolio principally of structured product securities, also referred to as fixed income securitizations, with attractive yield and duration characteristics relative to those of corporate debt instruments. The structured product securities targeted by the fund will include residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, other asset-backed securities and collateralized loan obligations (CLOs).\n\nIn normal conditions, the Fund portfolio will comprise lower credit-quality and unrated debt instruments. The Fund may invest in securities of any credit quality and may invest without limit in securities rated below investment grade (securities rated Ba1 or below by Moody's and BB+ or below by S&P and Fitch Ratings, Inc.) and unrated securities.\n\nThe co-portfolio managers of the Fund are Morris Chen, Andrew Hsu and Ken Shinoda. They have served on the investment team of DoubleLine Capital since the firm's founding on December 14, 2009. Mr. Chen heads the Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities and Commercial Real Estate group at DoubleLine. Mr. Hsu heads the firm's Global Infrastructure and Asset-Backed Securities group. Mr. Shinoda heads the firm's Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities group.\n\nThe three co-portfolio managers of the Fund also serve as permanent members of the Fixed Income Asset Allocation and Structured Products committees at DoubleLine.\n\n\"Structured product credits often offer attractive yields relative to their interest-rate risk, and provide a diversification away from corporate credit,\" noted Ron Redell, president of the DoubleLine Funds. \"Those traits can be advantageous in most environments, but perhaps even more so today given the extended rally in corporate bonds. The investment team at DoubleLine has a long history of enhancing the potential of this large, diverse sector of the fixed income universe through active management.\"\n\nAbout DoubleLine\n\nDoubleLine Capital is an investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.
