When graphically depicted with deviation bands, Bitcoin historically has tested band levels below its median prior to halving years.\n\nCrypto analyst PlanB wrote an article in March 2019, applying Bitcoin to the stock-to-flow model used in the traditional business world, previously applied to commodities such as gold and silver.\n\nUsing gold as an example, the stock-to-flow model addresses the metal\u2019s scarcity as it lines up with its supply and the amount of new gold made available each year, the article noted.\n\nPlanB used this information to plot a Bitcoin chart depicting its stock-to-flow ratio and making a case for Bitcoin to reach a price tag of $55,000 after its 2020 halving.\n\nMeanwhile, programmer Rob Wolfram, also known as @hamal03 on crypto-Twitter, took this pool of data and added it to a separate chart with deviation bands, revealing previous Bitcoin dips prior to halving events.\n\nBTC USD stock-to-flow with deviations. Source: Rob Wolfram (@hamal03)\n\nBitcoin stock-to-flow deviation data\n\nAccording to Bitcoin\u2019s price \u2014 depicted as the red line on the chart \u2014 BTC price has reached comparatively higher separation above its median during bullish periods than the times it dropped below its median during bearish periods. Bitcoin also has followed its median line, leading to higher prices in conjunction with halving events.\n\nAfter its halvings in 2012 and 2016, Bitcoin followed the median upward trend but rode that trend mostly below the median line until large bull run spikes drove its price high above the median.\n\nAdditionally, prior to the 2012 and 2016 halvings, Bitcoin appears to have experienced bear market drops, spending time near the bottom of the dark blue deviation band.\n\nA similar bear market period near the bottom of the dark blue deviation also occurred after 2018, but appears to have happened comparatively earlier than the other two pre-halving bearish periods.\n\nWolfram also suggested an interesting observation, pointing to reversion and decreasing highs.\n\n\u201cAt both halvings I see the price overshooting the model price and then coming back down,\u201d Wolfram told CoinTelegraph. \u201cIt does seem that the overshooting becomes less though.\u201d\n\nNotably, the above chart is an updated version using past information, in contrast to the one originally posted on Twitter, which used future data predictions. Wolfram also developed this chart before Bitcoin\u2019s 42% spike on Oct. 25.\n\nDeviation chart inception\n\nWhile listening to Stephen Livera interview Trace Mayer on a podcast, Wolfram heard Mayer explain that \u201che buys and sells Bitcoin if it's one standard deviation below or above the predicted price,\u201d Wolfram said.\n\nPartial to PlanB\u2019s work with stock-to-flow, Wolfram saw the opportunity to blend the two concepts. He explained:\n\n\u201cI thought that was a great idea to visualize and that is what is represented by the blue areas, one (dark blue) and two (light blue) standard errors (the 2D version of standard deviation) above and below the predicted price.\u201d\n\nWolfram said he decided to work on this endeavor to evaluate Bitcoin\u2019s Oct. 23 price fall to $7,300. Looking at his chart, he concluded the decrease in price to be of little significance.\n\nAs Bitcoin moves toward its 2020 halving, one might wonder at what point such a graph would face invalidation. Wolfram explained that he is not positive, but time will tell.\n\n\u201cIf the price stays on this level (below 10,000) more than a year after the halving, then I think the model can be said to be invalid,\u201d he said.\n\nWolfram also referred back to Plan B\u2019s lofty expectations.\n\n\u201cHe says that the price should have hit 100,000 at least once by the end of 2021 or the model fails,\u201d said Wolfram. \u201cHe is the professional guy here so I think we should listen to him.\u201d\n\nDescribing his own experience, Wolfram denotes, \u201cI'm not a trader, not an economist and most definitely not an econometrist,\u201d adding, \u201cI'm an IT guy who uses DuckDuckGo a lot.\u201d\n\nCurrently sitting near $9,300 at press time, Bitcoin still has quite a bit of ground to cover to reach its predicted $55,000 and $100,000 price targets.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed here are solely those of (@benjaminpirus) and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.
