Late on Monday, the body renewed its count and said that with 95% of votes counted, Morales led 46.41% to Mesa\u2019s 37.06%.\n\nBolivia elections: President Evo Morales may have to face second round Read more\n\nUnder Bolivian law, Morales would need a 10-percentage point advantage over Mesa to avoid a second round in December. The official final count is not due for seven days.\n\nIn a statement the Organisation of American States (OAS) expressed its \u201cdeep concern and surprise at the drastic and hard-to-explain change in the trend of the preliminary results revealed after the closing of the polls\u201d and urged for calm.\n\nOpposition groups have not heeded that call. Mesa, who had warned that the vote could be manipulated to avoid a runoff, called on Bolivians \u201cto conduct a battle in defense of the vote.\u201d\n\nPolice opened fire with tear gas as protesters clashed with government supporters outside local offices of the electoral tribunal in the capital La Paz, and the cities of Oruro, Potos\u00ed and Cochabamba.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Supporters of the Bolivian opposition candidate Carlos Mesa of Comunidad Ciudadana party burn ballots during a protest in La Paz.

In Camiri, the centre of Bolivia\u2019s lucrative gas industry, videos showed protestors attacking the offices of the national oil company.\n\nIn Santa Cruz, opposition figures called for an indefinite country-wide strike starting tomorrow while supporters chanted \u201cno tenemos miedo, carajo!\u201d (\u201cWe aren\u2019t scared, dammit!\u201d).\n\nStoking the protestors\u2019 anger were videos shared widely on social media which purportedly showed highly irregular electoral processes, including boxes of ballot papers lying abandoned in a La Paz street and piled high in a warehouse in Potos\u00ed.\n\nThe interior minister, Carlos Romero, accused the opposition of trying to create trouble, warning that \u201cthey have to take care of the violence they\u2019re generating\u201d.\n\nRodrigo Riaza, a research analyst for Latin America and the Caribbean at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said: \u201cIf Morales wins outright in the first round, the opposition will double down on their claims of fraud, which they have built up throughout the campaign.\u201d\n\nThe US acting assistant secretary of state for the Western Hemisphere, Michael Kozak, tweeted: \u201cThe US rejects the Electoral Tribunal\u2019s attempts to subvert #Bolivia\u2018s democracy by delaying the vote count & taking actions that undermine the credibility of Bolivia\u2019s elections.\u201d\n\nChile on edge as worst unrest in three decades claims 11 lives Read more\n\nMonday\u2019s clashes came amid fresh street violence in neighbouring Chile, and after mass protests in Ecuador and Haiti.\n\n\u201cThe region is convulsing. In Bolivia so far there have been tensions but we could go from tension to convulsion if Morales tries to force a victory in the first round,\u201d said Bolivian political analyst Franklin Pareja.\n\nBeing forced into a runoff would be \u201ca sharp blow to Morales, whose political success has been impressive and who seemed confident of a first-round win,\u201d said Michael Shifter, head of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based thinktank.\n\n\u201cMorales\u2019s failure to achieve a first-round victory reflects growing concern about a slowing economy, corruption scandals and his determination to pursue a fourth term in defiance of a national referendum and the Bolivian constitution. Many Bolivians are simply weary. If re-elected, Evo will be in office nearly two decades.\u201d\n\n\u2018Democracy in Bolivia has two faces\u2019: ambivalence as Evo Morales seeks fourth term Read more\n\nBolivia under Morales has remained a rare example of stability and growth. The economy has grown by an annual average of about 4.5%, well above the regional average, and the International Monetary Fund predicts it will grow at 4% this year.\n\nBut Morales has also faced growing dissatisfaction, especially over his refusal to accept a referendum on limiting presidential terms.", "description": "Top electoral authority stopped releasing election returns Sunday, prompting fears officials were trying to help Morales avoid runoff vote", "authors": ["Mat Youkee"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2aa4f1f0bbd2e845474e29687f7a8af0d5a258e6/0_148_5039_3023/master/5039.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c972e7a181e1f9c88ccfbb8e4d4dbc98", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
