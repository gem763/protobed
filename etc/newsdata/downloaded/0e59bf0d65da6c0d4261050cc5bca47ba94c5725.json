He saw it in The Independent several times last week, \u201cnone of them in the original blackjack sense\u201d. I know little about the card game, so I looked it up, and doubling down means doubling your bet and asking for a single extra card. It can be a bluff, trying to convince other players that you have a better hand than you do. But the essential point is that it is a refusal to \u201cfold\u201d and a raising of the stakes.\n\nSo I think its use as a metaphor is justified. It is generally used to refer to conduct that adds to the offence originally caused. In an editorial last week, for example, we said the prime minister was \u201cunrepentant about using intemperate language, doubling down on describing the Benn Act \u2026 as the \u2018surrender act\u2019\u201d.\n\nIf you were being pedantic \u2013 perish the thought \u2013 you might say that Boris Johnson was merely repeating a phrase that annoyed people, rather than raising the stakes by adding new inflammatory material.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

In a rugby report, we said: \u201cFour years on from their iconic, historic win over South Africa, Japan showed that they remain a force to be reckoned with.\u201d This adds nothing to the word \u201chistoric\u201d \u2013 in fact, by trying too hard, it might even take something away.\n\nRoll out the metaphor: I have written about hurricanes barrelling before. But they are still doing it. We reported last week: \u201cMeteorologists have warned of wet and windy conditions as Lorenzo continues to barrel towards the UK.\u201d\n\nThanks to Mick O\u2019Hare for pointing out, again, that this is the wrong metaphor for a hurricane, because the axis of rotation of a barrel is horizontal, whereas that of a storm is vertical.\n\nStill, it\u2019s just a metaphor, isn\u2019t it, so perhaps it doesn\u2019t matter. I am more offended by \u201cwet and windy conditions\u201d. What we mean is rain and strong winds, so why don\u2019t we say that?\n\nPiped musicians: In an article about Zimbdancehall, a spinoff of Jamaican dancehall music, we wrote about a studio called Chillspot Records. \u201cChillspot has enabled a steady pipeline of Zimdancehall rappers, including Mamhare, to escape their rough neighbourhoods through achieving national fame.\u201d In this sentence, Chillspot is the pipeline, and the rappers are a steady flow of talent passing through it.", "description": "A reader has been in touch about the phrase \u201cdouble down\u201d.
