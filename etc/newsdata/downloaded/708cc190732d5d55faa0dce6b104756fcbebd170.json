There was an element of luck. Anyone who gets to the top of most things in life, if they don\u2019t admit they\u2019ve had a certain amount of luck, they are either being dishonest or delusional.\n\nThe fourth thing, which is talked about less, is intellectual curiosity and a commitment to lifelong learning. Education never finishes. To this day, I am still learning.\n\nDavid Morgan with his wife Ros Kelly in 2001. \"Choosing the right life partner is a big deal,\" he says. Laura Friezer\n\nWhat have been your key lessons from corporate life?\n\nHubris is a cancer. I\u2019ve seen it infect CEOs in particular. You have a lot of people kissing your tail as CEO and you can start to believe in all that stuff. You need to keep some humility, which I\u2019m not sure I did as well as I might have, frankly. But that\u2019s important.\n\nAnd the last lesson is around luck. There\u2019s a random element to luck, but I also recall [Roman philosopher] Seneca\u2019s words: \u201cWhen luck meets preparation, that turns into opportunity.\u201d\n\nWhat were some of the mistakes you made and what did you learn from them?\n\nI had buckets of 360-degree assessments that I collected on myself. And I had two days of someone reading them verbatim to me. They were from the boards down. It was quite a searing experience. I realised how I\u2019d really neglected the people side of things. I\u2019d been brought up saying: \u201cIf you just bring enough hard work and intelligence to a task, it\u2019ll be fine. You come up with the right answer and people will just follow you up the mountain.\u201d\n\nWell, no. You\u2019re born with IQ. You\u2019re not born with EQ [emotional intelligence]. And I had to change there. I learnt a lot from my wife, Ros Kelly, who has wonderful EQ skills.\n\nI think you can\u2019t change yourself inside out, but you can be a better version of yourself. You can be yourself with more skill. I really needed to be. I was too full of myself, and too unaware of my own shortcomings in the way I dealt with people. People do things for their reasons, not my reasons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I was in Treasury, 80 per cent of the task was to work out the right solution to a problem and 20 per cent was convincing people. When I got to Westpac, about 20 per cent of the time I was working out the right thing to do and 80 per cent of the time I needed to be getting 37,000 people to follow me up the mountain.\n\nI was a very slow learner on that. And it really took this searing, searing experience.\n\nI also feel I\u2019ve made mistakes as a father. For the first 14 months of my grandson\u2019s life, my son \u2013 who\u2019s smarter than me and a better leader than me \u2013 comes home at 6.15 and bathes his son every night. In 1985, my first full year of my son\u2019s life, I took four Sundays off. And that\u2019s all. I was a pretty crappy father.\n\n\"Hubris is a cancer. I've seen it infect CEOs in particular.\" David Rowe\n\nI think I was lucky to have a really good board and three really good chairmen at Westpac. But I probably underinvested in that relationship. When I was at Westpac, I was offered board roles and I thought: \u201cNo. I\u2019m being paid this ridiculous amount of money to spend all my time [here].\u201d I wish now I had, because I would have treated my board better and got more out of them.\n\nWhat advice do you have for other CEOs or those who aspire to be one?\n\nThe CEO role is unique. Before I was appointed CEO, I\u2019d run the retail bank, I\u2019d run the wealth management, I\u2019d run the corporate bank. And now I was just running the whole company, right? Wrong. You have a whole lot of new constituents to manage that you don\u2019t at that operational level. You\u2019ve got to step back from taking all the individual decisions that got you there.\n\nSecond, people and processes matter much more than the individual decisions. You can\u2019t make all the decisions, but you need to put the people and processes in place. Third, you\u2019ve got to devote much more attention to culture.\n\nHow do you create good culture? You can only touch so many people in the organisation.\n\nWhen I talked about the leadership at Westpac, I really talked to about the top 2000 people who led the other 35,000. Most of those 35,000 would listen to their immediate leader much more than they would listen to David Morgan. So, one thing was ensuring we had leadership forums where my executive team and I would go out for at least two weeks a year with the top 2000 leaders in each of the capitals, and just spend a full day talking and getting feedback from them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow important are information flows?\n\nSomething I tell the CEOs I mentor is to stay close to the front line. You get bullshitted a lot. And use your investors wisely. There are some very smart investors out there, who invest for the long term. They really do their homework on a company and know about competitors as well.\n\nMost weaknesses are overdone strengths. Hard work\u2019s great as long as it doesn\u2019t exhaust you or impair your health or relationships. Ambition is strength, unless it\u2019s too sharp-elbowed or too self-centred. Empathy really matters and is a strength, but you\u2019ve still got be able to walk in and fire somebody. Leadership is not one thing. It\u2019s a question of balance.", "description": "Sure, do something you like, says former Westpac CEO David Morgan.
