He later hired her as a trainer.\n\nAccording to the Times report of the lawsuit, a filing that represents only one point of view, Mr. Brown exposed himself and kissed her without consent and then, a month later, masturbated while standing behind her as she was watching TV at his home.\n\n\u201cBrown bragged about the incident in profane text messages that are copied in the lawsuit,\u201d the Times wrote.\n\nThe lawsuit claims that Ms. Taylor cut off their training relationship after the second incident but came back when the receiver, then with the Pittsburgh Steelers, apologized and assured her there would be no repeat incidents.\n\n\u201cThen, the lawsuit says, on May 20, 2018, Brown forced her onto a bed, pushed her face into the mattress and \u2018forcibly\u2019 raped her. She tried to resist him, screaming and repeatedly shouting \u2018no\u2019 and \u2018stop,\u2019 the lawsuit says, but Brown refused and penetrated her,\u201d the Times wrote.\n\nIn a statement to the Times, Mr. Brown\u2019s attorney Darren Heitner said his client \u201cdenies each and every allegation in the lawsuit.\u201d\n\nThe Times reported that it was not clear whether Ms. Taylor reported any of the incidents to the police at the time.\n\nShe issued a statement Tuesday evening saying she would cooperate with the NFL in any investigation of the receiver.\n\n\u201cAs a rape victim of Antonio Brown, deciding to speak out has been an incredibly difficult decision,\u201d Ms. Taylor said in her statement. \u201cI have found strength in my faith, my family, and from the accounts of other survivors of sexual assault.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit is the latest and most severe twist in a bizarre offseason for Mr. Brown, who was dumped by the Steelers as a troublemaker on the Oakland Raiders for far less than his trade value. The Raiders last week released him after further locker room disruptions and his Twitter demand to be released. He then promptly signed with the Patriots.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
