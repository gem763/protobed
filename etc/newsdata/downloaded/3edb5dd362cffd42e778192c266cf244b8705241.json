But until that point, no power can stop us.\u201d\n\nThe comments come as heavy fighting continues in northeastern Syria for an eighth straight day, after President Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw troops sparked Turkey\u2019s military action to crush Kurdish-led forces. Erdogan says that once the \u201csafe zone\u201d is established, it will be repopulated with millions of returned Syrian refugees.\n\nTrump scrambles\n\nSince the conflict began on Oct. 9, at least 71 civilians have been killed, including 21 children, according to the Syrian Observatory of Human Rights, a U.K.-based monitoring group. In addition, 135 Kurdish-led fighters, 122 pro-Turkish fighters, and eight Turkish soldiers have died.\n\nTrump has been scrambling to halt the carnage unleashed by his decision to withdraw the troops, which virtually greenlit the Turkish assault in northern Syria. He has asked Turkey to declare a ceasefire and offered to facilitate mediation with the Kurdish forces.\n\nBut Erdogan told reporters on a flight from Baku on Tuesday: \u201cWe can never declare a ceasefire,\u201d adding he would \u201cnot negotiate with a terrorist organization.\u201d\n\nREAD: Trump is scrambling to undo the chaos he unleashed in northern Syria\n\nOn Monday, Trump slapped sanctions on Turkey, promising that he is \u201cprepared to swiftly destroy Turkey's economy if Turkish leaders continue down this dangerous and destructive path.\u201d\n\nBut Erdogan appears unfazed, telling reporters Tuesday that Ankara is \u201cnot concerned by the sanctions,\u201d and reiterating his position that the military offensive will only end when all Kurdish forces are removed.\n\n\u201cWe are determined to continue the operation until the end, without paying attention to threats. We will absolutely finish the job we started. Our battle will continue until ultimate victory is achieved,\u201d he said in a speech in Baku on Tuesday.\n\nErdogan digs in\n\nIn a bid to resolve the crisis, a White House a delegation led by Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is on its way to Ankara. The pair were scheduled to meet Erdogan on Thursday to discuss a possible ceasefire, but Erdogan told Sky News on Wednesday that he will no longer meet with Pence or Pompeo. The Turkish strongman said he would only speak to Trump when he visits Turkey.\n\n\u201cWhen Donald Trump comes here, I will talk to him,\u201d Erdogan said.\n\nHowever, one journalist subsequently suggested there had been some mistranslation, as Erdogan had said moments earlier that he did plan on meeting Pence and Pompeo.\n\nTrump has been facing significant backlash from fellow Republicans, and from the media, for his decision to withdraw troops from Syria. But Erdogan urged the U.S. president to ignore the media criticism. \u201cYou are now under their influence. Don\u2019t listen to them, you are a strong leader,\u201d Erdogan said Tuesday.\n\nWhen asked about Trump\u2019s habit of using Twitter to announce foreign policy shifts, the Turkish leader told reporters it was difficult to keep up. \u201cWhen we take a look at Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter posts, we can no longer follow them. We cannot keep track,\" he said Tuesday.\n\n\n\nMoscow fills the vacuum\n\nAs the U.S. has withdrawn, Russia has seized the opportunity to cement its position as a key powerbroker in the region: abandoned by the U.S., Kurdish forces have turned to the Russian-backed Syrian regime of Bashar Al Assad for support. Moscow has also deployed troops to the town of Manbij in a bid to keep advancing Turkish troops and Syrian troops apart.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov blamed the U.S. on Wednesday for pushing \u201cthe Kurds toward separatism and confrontation with Arab tribes.\u201d\n\nREAD: Trump\u2019s betrayal of the Kurds is as incoherent as it is dangerous\n\nErdogan spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the phone on Tuesday, and said he did not mind the Russian-backed Syrian troops being deployed to the region, as long as Kurdish fighters leave.\n\n\u201cI told this to Mr. Putin. If you are clearing Manbij of terrorist organizations, then go ahead, you or the regime can provide all the logistics. But if you are not going to do this, the people there are telling us to save them,\" Erdogan told reporters on Tuesday.\n\nCover: Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan addresses the World Turkish Business Council meeting, in Baku, Azerbaijan, Monday.
