REUTERS/Pablo Sanhueza\n\nSANTIAGO (Reuters) - In 2016, Chilean 14-year old girl Catalina began to identify with friends and family as Alexis, a boy. It took Chile\u2019s conservative, Roman Catholic legal system far longer to come around.\n\nAlexis, who was born an identical twin with his sister Maria Ignacia, two weeks ago changed his name and sex in the civil registry, as well as on his birth certificate. The changes paved the way for him to this week request his first government-issued ID.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy because I\u2019m the first boy to change his gender legally,\u201d Alexis said.\n\nChile\u2019s center-right President Sebastian Pinera late in 2018 signed into law a bill allowing people over the age of 14 to change their name and gender in official records.\n\nThe law marked a historic shift in the traditionally conservative, predominantly Roman Catholic country.\n\nChile legalized divorce in 2004, making it one of the last countries in the world to do so. And the country\u2019s ban on abortion, one of the strictest in the world, was lifted only recently, in 2017, though for special circumstances only.\n\nThere are no official statistics for the number of trans people in Chile.", "description": "In 2016, Chilean 14-year old girl Catalina began to identify with friends and family as Alexis, a boy.
