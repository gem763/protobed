Milenio broadcast a photograph that it said showed Ovidio Guzman in detention.\n\nPresident Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told reporters his security cabinet would give information about the situation in Sinaloa later on Thursday.\n\nState police confirmed to Reuters that several prisoners escaped from a prison during the chaos, which lasted for hours.
