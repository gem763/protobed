He was also later hospitalized for a knee infection.\n\nHis wife Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, chairwoman of the Maryland Democratic Party, said in a statement Thursday that her husband was an honorable man who served his district with \u201cdignity, integrity, compassion and humility.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe worked until his last breath because he believed our democracy was the highest and best expression of our collective humanity and that our nation\u2019s diversity was our promise, not our problem.
