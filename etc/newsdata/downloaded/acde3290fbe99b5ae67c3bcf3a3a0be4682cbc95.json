She was saying that her body has not belonged to her for the past decade. Not in a bad way, in a positive way \u2014 her body has been designated to create life and now it\u2019s hers again and she\u2019s going to make it fantastic in a really enjoyable way.\u201d\n\nJESSICA SIMPSON SHOWS OFF BABY DAUGHTER, BIRDIE, IN ADORABLE NEW PHOTO\n\nPasternak says that he\u2019s worked with Simpson for 12 years and helped her get her body back in shape after giving birth to daughter Maxwell, 7 and son Ace, 6.

So the majority of the weight loss actually came from everything she did outside of the gym, and then everything in the gym is about toning and tightening,\u201d he told People.\n\nSimpson showed off her results in an Instagram post on Tuesday with a photo of herself rocking an all-black outfit.\n\n\"6 months. 100 pounds down (Yes, I tipped the scales at 240 \ud83d\ude1c),\" she wrote.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cMy first trip away from #BIRDIEMAE and emotional for many reasons, but so proud to feel like myself again,\" Simpson said. \"Even when it felt impossible, I chose to work harder. \ud83d\udc9a\"", "description": "Jessica Simpson\u2019s trainer revealed the secrets behind her 100-pound weight loss after the star\u00a0gave\u00a0birth to daughter Birdie Mae six months ago.", "authors": ["Tyler Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/simpson.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
