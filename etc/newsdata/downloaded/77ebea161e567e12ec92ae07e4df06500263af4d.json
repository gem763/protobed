The\n\npan-European Stoxx 600 rose 0.3% to its highest since\n\nMay 2018. Germany's DAX wasn't far behind and the euro,\n\nalthough a shade lower, was consolidating its 2.1% October\n\nadvance at $1.1130. .\n\nWall Street futures were higher, Asia had cheered a one-year\n\nhigh for Tokyo's Nikkei and MSCI All World index\n\n, which tracks nearly 50 countries, was at its\n\nhighest since late July. .T\n\n\"Draghi is in a situation where bond yields are higher and\n\nthe collapse we saw over the summer is reversing, the euro has\n\nsteadied itself and everything is fine, except for the PMIs of\n\ncourse,\" said Societe Generale's Kit Juckes. \"And he's handing\n\nover an empty monetary policy toolkit.\"\n\nThe ECB's statement brought little new news. The bank said\n\nlast month it would restart stimulus. But the focus was firmly\n\non Draghi's 1230 GMT final wisdom, seven years on after his\n\n'whatever it takes' promise, calmed the euro debt crisis.\n\nThere won't been any champagne in Frankfurt though.\n\nInflation remains well below the ECB's target and the purchasing\n\nmanager data had shown business activity in the euro bloc\n\nstagnating again in October.\n\nGermany's export-dependent manufacturing sector also\n\nremained in contraction, suggesting a third-quarter slowdown in\n\nEurope's largest economy could stretch into the closing months\n\nof the year.\n\n\"Things are really not getting any better yet. A slight\n\nimprovement in October PMIs can't mask the fact that growth has\n\nalmost stalled. The overall picture is one of a feeble economy,\"\n\nsaid Bert Colijn at ING.\n\nThe data had also knocked the wind out of the euro after it\n\nhad started the day brightly, but bond yields were broadly\n\nsteady and there were plenty of other things going on too.\n\nThe Swedish crown rose 0.7% after its central bank stuck\n\nwith plans to raise its interest rates in December. Its gains\n\npulled the Norwegian crown higher as well, despite a relatively\n\ndovish message from the Norges Bank which left its rates\n\nunchanged.\n\nTurkey was the real mover though. It slashed its rates 250\n\nbasis points to 14% from 16.5%, a day after U.S. President\n\nDonald Trump lifted sanctions on Turkey following a ceasefire in\n\nnorthern Syria. DREAMS\n\nOn Wall Street third-quarter earnings reports remained\n\ncenter stage with investors trying to gauge the fallout from a\n\nprolonged U.S.-China trade war, which has already shown up in\n\nthe domestic economy.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Dow and the Nasdaq added\n\n0.2% each and the S&P 500 gained 0.3% Tesla\n\nshares jumped 21% in after-hours trading after the\n\ncompany reported an unexpected third-quarter profit.\n\n\n\nMicrosoft was looking good too after posting\n\nforecast-beating profit and revenue numbers after the closing\n\nbell, although the outlook was darkened by slower-than-expected\n\ntake-up of its Azure cloud services.\n\nShares of Boeing Co BA.N and Caterpillar Inc CAT.N\n\nmeanwhile had ended about 1% higher each despite big earnings\n\nmisses. \"We have been down this road before with CAT,\" RBC Capital\n\nMarkets' chief economist Tom Porcelli said in a note titled\n\nStill Waiting For Recession. \"If you keep saying a recession is\n\nhere, it is a mathematical certainty that at some point you will\n\nbe right. Maybe try again after CAT's next quarterly earnings\n\nreport.\"\n\nSo far, results from about 125 of the S&P 500 companies are\n\nout with analysts expecting earnings to have declined 2.9%\n\nyear-over-year, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nBREXTENSION\n\nSterling paused at $1.29 after rising 0.3% on\n\nWednesday. After more than three years, Britain appears closer\n\nthan ever to resolving its Brexit conundrum but still has\n\nhurdles to clear.\n\nEU member states on Wednesday delayed a decision on whether\n\nto grant Britain a three-month Brexit extension. Prime Minister\n\nBoris Johnson said if the deadline is deferred to the end of\n\nJanuary, he would call an election.\n\n\"The Brexit battle looks like it will drag on,\" economists\n\nat ANZ wrote in a note, summing what most weary Westminster\n\nwatchers were feeling.\n\nWith the euro EUR=D3 treading water, The Japanese yen\n\nwas 0.1% higher at 108.6 per dollar and the Australian\n\ndollar AUD=D3 was weaker at $0.6842.\n\nThe dollar index was lower at 97.452 against a basket\n\nof six major currencies, heading for its worst month since\n\nJanuary 2018.\n\nIn commodity markets, oil steadied above $61 a barrel on as\n\nconcern over the demand outlook offset a surprise drop in U.S.\n\ncrude inventories and the prospect of further action by OPEC and\n\nits allies to support the market.\n\nBrent crude was unchanged at $61.17 a barrel, having\n\njumped 2.5% on Wednesday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI)\n\ncrude was down 10 cents at $55.87 and gold barely\n\nbudged at $1,491.50 an ounce.
