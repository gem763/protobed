Saudi Arabia will meet obligations to suppliers by running down reserves as state oil company Saudi Aramco works toward bringing back all the 5.7 million barrels a day lost after the giant Abqaiq processing plan was set ablaze.\n\nFollowing the strike, Brent crude futures jumped 19% on resuming trade Monday, the market\u2019s biggest move in 28 years and traded back above $70 a barrel for the first time since May. West Texas Intermediate crude surged as much as 15.5% to a high of $63.34 a barrel.\n\nAlthough supply into the global market won\u2019t be disrupted in the short term, prices are likely to jump when they open for the week as traders digest the attack. Claimed by rebels in Yemen, but blamed on Iran by the U.S., the assault shows the vulnerability of the very heart of the Saudi economy and how Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s more aggressive foreign policy could threaten his push for economic modernization.\n\nBefore the attack, Saudi Arabia was pumping about 9.8 million barrels a day, almost 10% of global production. Aramco could consider declaring itself unable to fulfill contracts on some international shipments -- know as force majeure -- if the resumption of full capacity at Abqaiq takes weeks, people familiar with the matter said, asking not be identified before a public statement.\n\nIf the disruption is \u201cprotracted it could be a big challenge for the oil markets,\u201d Mele Kyari, chief executive officer of state producer Nigerian National Petroleum Corp., told Bloomberg Television on Sunday.\n\nIran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen claimed responsibility for the attacks, but U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo blamed Iran directly, without offering evidence for that conclusion. Iran\u2019s Foreign Ministry described Pompeo\u2019s remarks as \u201cblind and fruitless accusations.\u201d\n\nThe attack, said by the Houthis to have been carried out by a swarm of 10 drones, is the most serious on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil infrastructure since Iraq\u2019s Saddam Hussein fired Scud missiles into the kingdom during the first Gulf War. The kingdom\u2019s benchmark stock index tumbled as much as 3.1% on Sunday in Riyadh.\n\nThe Houthis, who are fighting Saudi-backed forces in Yemen, have claimed responsibility for most of the strikes against Aramco installations.\n\n\u201cWork is under way to restore production and a progress update will be provided in around 48 hours,\u201d Amin Nasser, Aramco\u2019s president and chief executive officer, said in a statement on Sunday.\n\nCrude Reserves\n\nAramco will be able to keep customers supplied for several weeks by drawing on a global storage network. The Saudis hold millions of barrels in tanks in the kingdom itself, plus three strategic locations around the world: Rotterdam in the Netherlands, Okinawa in Japan, and Sidi Kerir on the Mediterranean coast of Egypt.\n\nInstead of supplying some customers with the usual crude oil grades of Arab Light or Arab Extra Light, the company may offer them Arab Heavy and Arab Medium as a replacement, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nA satellite picture from a NASA near real-time imaging system published early on Sunday, more than 24 hours after the attack, showed the huge smoke plume over Abqaiq had dissipated completely. But four additional plumes to the south-west, over the Ghawar oilfield, the world\u2019s largest, were still clearly visible.\n\nWhile that field wasn\u2019t attacked, its crude and gas is sent to Abqaiq for processing. The smoke most likely indicated flaring, the industry term for what happens when a facility stops suddenly and excess oil and natural gas is safely burned off.\n\nFor the global oil market, the 5.7 million barrels a day Saudi halt is the single worst sudden disruption ever, surpassing the loss of Kuwaiti and Iraqi petroleum supply in August 1990, when Saddam Hussein invaded his neighbor. It also exceeds the loss of Iranian oil output in 1979 during the Islamic Revolution, according to data from the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\nGovernment Action\n\nThe U.S. government said it\u2019s prepared to dip into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve if necessary to offset any market disruption. The International Energy Agency, which helps coordinate industrialized countries\u2019 emergency fuel stockpiles, said it was monitoring the situation.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Arabia will probably restore almost half the oil production lost after this weekend\u2019s devastating drone strike as early as tomorrow, though a full resumption from the world\u2019s biggest crude exporter may take weeks.That\u2019s according to industry consultant Energy Aspects in a note sent", "authors": ["Nayla Razzouk", "Javier Blas"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/wpsbEYrjz_m6SAAStjnQog--~B/aD03MTA7dz0xMjk2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/b1a73f050ac629647885d86c4cb49dbd", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
