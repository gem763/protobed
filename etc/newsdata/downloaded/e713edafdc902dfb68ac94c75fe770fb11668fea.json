But farmers here say they are still angry at Trump for destabilizing agriculture markets, a move they say cost some farms hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump has irritated me and cost me so much money with all of these policies,\u201d said Tim Burrack, who farms 2,000 aces near Arlington, population 402. \u201cThis is not what we signed up for when we voted Trump in.\"\n\nLast week\u2019s announcement was designed to appease farmers like Burrack who have been fuming for months after the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in August exempted 31 small refineries from adding the biofuel to their product \u2014 an order that came directly from Trump.\n\nThe August news was a catalyzing moment for Iowa farmers, who were promised by Trump just two months earlier that he would reevaluate the waivers \u2014 something farmers hoped would stem the tide of waivers that had increased under the Trump administration.\n\nThe exemptions were viewed as betrayal in the corn belt, prompting a backlash among farmers, though perhaps none were as vocal as those in Iowa, who were not shy about exerting political pressure in a crucial 2020 state.\n\nAt a press conference later that month, numerous corn farmers said that while they voted for Trump in 2016, they were unsure if they would do so again.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrump\u2019s trade wars drove down profits from corn and soybeans, they said, and then the waivers diminished demand for ethanol and biodiesel.\n\nTrump is now trying to blunt that damage, telling reporters Monday, \u201cThey should like me out in Iowa.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s a divide between the trade groups and farmers on the ground.\n\nMany Iowa farmers say Trump\u2019s proposal from last week is short on details of how it will ensure larger refineries blend in the ethanol others were exempted from adding \u2014 something the EPA has failed to do in the past.\n\nThe new thresholds also won\u2019t kick in until next year, meaning they won\u2019t undo the 31 waivers affecting 1.4 billion gallons of ethanol.\n\nThings were differing during the Obama years on the waiver front.\n\nThe Trump administration has given 85 waivers to small refineries since January 2017, while the Obama administration gave out under 10 such waivers over eight years.\n\nWhen Sen. Amy Klobuchar Amy Jean KlobucharSenate Intelligence report triggers new calls for action on election security Krystal Ball: Yang campaign a 'triumph of substance over the theatre' Fifth DNC debate to be held Nov. 20 in Georgia MORE (D-Minn.) made a presidential campaign stop at an Iowa biodiesel plant the day Trump made his announcement, she slammed the proposal as \u201ctoo little too late.\u201d\n\nJames Broghammer, CEO of Homeland Energy Solutions, shared half of that sentiment.\n\n\u201cIt may not be too little, but it might be too late for some ethanol plants,\u201d said Broghammer, whose ethanol plant is the largest in Iowa.\n\nTrump\u2019s proposal in many ways mirrors a rule already on the books from the George W. Bush administration. It calls for blending a minimum of 15 billion gallons of ethanol into fuel annually, one of the escalating targets laid out in current law that has never been met.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just resetting the table,\u201d said Broghammer, adding that while he hopes to see the law enforced, he wishes Trump would have laid out a more ambitious goal.\n\nLike many others, his plant has lost money this year. But he's weathering the storm.\n\nAt least 15 ethanol plants have closed nationwide, according to the Des Moines Register.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think [Trump] is going to win the farm vote this year, I really don\u2019t,\u201d said Jeff Samuelson, whose family farm is near Tipton, Iowa. \u201cThis gets pretty personal when this affects our bottom line.\u201d\n\nSamuelson estimates he\u2019s lost between $75,000 and $100,000 due to a decrease in demand for his corn.\n\nThat number is even higher for Burrack, who says he\u2019s lost about $265,000 between the effects of the trade war with China and the refinery waivers.\n\n\u201cI had to borrow a lot of money to keep going,\u201d Burrack said. \u201cThat was a horrible, horrible thing I had to do.\u201d\n\nPayouts to farmers from the administration were meant to soften some of the financial blow of the trade war, but Burrack said they are a fraction of what he would normally earn.\n\nTrump\u2019s ethanol proposal also requires the EPA to ensure the same number of gallons of ethanol is blended into fuel, regardless of how many waivers are granted.\n\nBut that\u2019s already required under law, and critics say there\u2019s little to assure farmers that this time around will be different, particularly in an administration known for reversing major policy decisions.\n\n\u201cIowans should be careful about taking another [renewable fuel standard] promise at face value. It is very much in question whether this gets done by 2020,\u201d Tim Gannon, an Iowa farmer and former USDA official, said in an email to The Hill.\n\n\u201cEvery time the president makes a promise on the RFS, his EPA administrator manages to roll it back for Big Oil, and a lot of the important details will be determined by EPA,\u201d he said, referring to the renewable fuel standard. \u201cThe question now is: Will this time be any different?\u201d\n\nThe proposal still has to go through a public comment period, and the fossil fuel industry has made clear they aim to sway the president.\n\n\u201cNext week [Trump will] talk to the oil people and give them what they want, I\u2019m afraid. His track record isn\u2019t good,\u201d Samuelson said.\n\nEven with all the skepticism, some say it\u2019s important to recognize Trump\u2019s efforts to fix a problem of his own making.\n\n\u201cIf you make him mad, you don\u2019t have access,\u201d Burrack said. \u201cOnce you get your door closed, it's hard to get back in. Most of these organizations still need his help. And now that he's finally done something positive, we're going to praise him, because they may need to continue to go in to make sure that what he said was going to happen, will happen.\u201d\n\nStill, Burrack said, it\u2019s taken too long to get here.\n\n\u201cIt is so sad that we've got to go through this much political effort; spend this much political capital; make people lose so much money out of their business, out of their lives, out of their retirement; have people lose their jobs, just to get back to the law,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's frustrating.\u201d", "description": "ARLINGTON, Iowa \u2013 President Trump faces an uphill battle in his effort to win\u00a0back Iowa farmers who have been hit hard by his trade and energy policies.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/farm_iowa_100319rb_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
