Nike, one of Ronaldo\u2019s biggest sponsors, have said they are \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d by the accusations while Juventus saw their shares drop sharply in the wake of the claims.\n\nBut what exactly do we know so far? What are we faced with? Where exactly will this case go? And what comes next for Ronaldo?\n\nSo, what do we know?\n\nKathryn Mayorga, 34, has accused Ronaldo of raping her in a penthouse suite at the Palms Casino Resort in June 2009 shortly after they met in a nightclub. At the time, the Portuguese had just completed his \u00a380m move from Manchester United to Real Madrid, making him the most expensive player on the planet.\n\nAfter keeping quiet for almost a decade, Mayorga has now gone public with her story and last month filed a lawsuit against the footballer.\n\nMayorga\u2019s legal team is also seeking to void a 2010 non-disclosure agreement she signed as part of an out-of-court financial settlement with the player. In a press conference held earlier this month, it was revealed by Mayorga\u2019s lawyers that, according to a psychiatrist\u2019s medical opinion, her psychological injuries made her \u201cincompetent\u201d to legally agree to the settlement at the time.\n\nThe lawsuit adds that Mayorga was manipulated and put under pressure by Ronaldo\u2019s \u201cfixers\u201d to agree to the 2010 settlement, which saw the American receive a $375,000 pay-off. Ronaldo\u2019s lawyer acknowledged the existence of this settlement but said it was \u201cby no means a confession of guilt\u201d.\n\nPolice in Las Vegas have also said that they have reopened their investigation into the alleged assault from 2009.\n\nWho is Kathryn Mayorga?\n\nAt the time of the incident, the American, then 25, was a budding model and, according to Der Spiegel, \"one of her jobs was to hang out with other young, beautiful women in front of bars to lure in guests.\" She had been working before she met Ronaldo, and later went partying at the Rain nightclub where she first crossed paths with the footballer.\n\nUntil recently, Mayorga worked as a teacher at a primary school. But she quit, she says, \"because I need all my strength now.\"\n\nAs of now, her location is not known and it's understood she has left Nevada to get away from the intense glare of the media spotlight.\n\nMayorga is being represented by Stovall & Associates, a legal firm based in Las Vegas.\n\nWhat have Ronaldo and his lawyers said?\n\nTaking to Twitter this month, Ronaldo said: \u201cI firmly deny the accusations being issued against me. Rape is an abominable crime that goes against everything that I am and believe in.\n\n\u201cKeen as I may be to clear my name, I refuse to feed the media spectacle created by people seeking to promote themselves at my expense.\n\n\u201cMy clear conscious [sic] will thereby allow me to await with tranquillity the results of any and all investigations.\u201d\n\nRonaldo\u2019s lawyer has also said that documents which appear to substantiate Mayorga\u2019s claims of rape have been altered. \u201cThe documents that allegedly contain statements by Cristiano Ronaldo and were reproduced in the media are pure inventions,\u201d Peter Christiansen said last week.\n\nChristiansen adds: \u201cWhat happened in 2009 in Las Vegas was completely consensual.\u201d\n\nWhat have Juventus said?\n\nThe Serie A side has strongly backed its player. In a statement released via Twitter, the club said: \u201cRonaldo has shown in recent months his great professionalism and dedication, which is appreciated by everyone at Juventus.\n\n\u201cThe events allegedly dating back to almost 10 years ago do not change this opinion, which is shared by anyone who has come into contact with this great champion.\u201d\n\nWhere do Ronaldo\u2019s sponsors stand?\n\nSo far, none of the player\u2019s partners and sponsors have cut ties with him \u2013 but this hasn't stopped them from expressing their concern at the allegations.\n\nSave the Children, for whom Ronaldo has served as an ambassador since 2016, was the first to speak publicly about the accusations. The charity told The Independent: \u201cWe are disheartened by the news report we\u2019ve seen and are working to get more information.\u201d\n\nNike, too, said it is \u201cdeeply concerned by the disturbing allegations and will continue to closely monitor the situation\u201d while gaming firm EA Sports, who feature Ronaldo heavily in their Fifa 19 video game, say they \u201cexpect cover athletes and ambassadors to conduct themselves in a manner that is consistent with EA\u2019s values.\u201d\n\nAt the beginning of February, the Portuguese was dropped as the cover star of Fifa 19, with Kevin De Bruyne, Neymar and Paulo Dybala sharing the spotlight in his place.\n\nUefa, meanwhile, told The Independent they are monitoring the situation surrounding the player.\n\nDAZN, another of Ronaldo\u2019s sponsors, said: \u201cWe take allegations of this nature extremely seriously and continue to monitor the situation closely.\u201d\n\nHaven\u2019t we been here before?\n\nTo a certain extent, yes. In April 2017, Der Spiegel published a report entitled \u2018Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s secret,\u2019 which detailed an allegation of rape made against the footballer. Except, at the time, the publication did not name Kathryn Mayorga as the accuser.\n\nNot yet ready to come forward with her story, and fearing the imposing power of brand Ronaldo, the American kept herself at a distance from the report. While the player continued to shine on the pitch \u2013 notably hitting a brace in the 2017 Champions League final \u2013 the accusation subsequently faded into the background.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Getty Images\n\nIt\u2019s a different story this time round, though. Now, unlike with 2017, Mayorga has come forward, citing the emergence of the MeToo movement as one of the reasons for doing so. More than this, the 33-year-old\u2019s attorney has filed a lawsuit against the Portuguese while police have reopened their 2009 investigation into the alleged sexual assault case. Given the depth to this story, and the legal dimensions it has adopted, there\u2019s little chance of it drifting into irrelevance.\n\nWhat comes next on the legal front?\n\nIn all likelihood, a long and drawn-out legal battle.\n\nAs it stands, Mayorga\u2019s position is weakened by the non-disclosure agreement she signed in 2010. Under this \u2013 Ronaldo\u2019s lawyers will claim \u2013 the American contractually relinquished her complaints against the footballer. If Mayorga\u2019s lawsuit is to advance, she will first need to convince a Las Vegas court to invalidate the settlement.\n\n\u201cSettlements, however, are usually approved, absent a compelling reason to reject it,\u201d Michael McCann, an associate dean at the University of New Hampshire School of Law and legal analyst for Sports Illustrated, told The Independent.\n\nFor numerous reasons, which can be explored in McCann\u2019s legal assessment of this case, courts are usually reluctant to void a settlement. Indeed, if it was easy to do this, then parties involved in a legal battle would never agree to such a settlement in the first place.\n\nAlthough Mayorga faces a major legal obstacle in this sense, a number of rationales that permit the nullification of the settlement have been invoked in her lawsuit, according to McCann.\n\n\u201cThe first rationale Mayorga cites is her lack of capacity to enter into a binding contract,\u201d he says. \u201cThe second rationale \u2026 is undue influence and duress\u201d while the third \u201cis her contention that Ronaldo fraudulently procured the settlement.\u201d\n\nNaturally, Ronaldo\u2019s attorneys will contest each one of these \u2018rationales\u2019. They will argue that Mayorga was more than capable of understanding the terms of the agreement she signed in 2010 while insisting they were obliged to pursue strategies that benefited their client at the time.\n\nMayorga\u2019s lawsuit also claims that she is excused from the settlement on account of Ronaldo himself breaching it. As part of the 2010 non-disclosure, it was agreed that the footballer would read a letter sent by Mayorga detailing her emotional and physical traumas in the wake of the alleged rape. Whether or not Ronaldo did read this letter has not been established \u2013 this is something for the court to decide.\n\nIn January 2019, the Wall Street Journal reported that the LVPD's investigators had issued a warrant for Ronaldo's DNA. Ronaldo's representatives and the Las Vegas Police Department have declined to comment on the story.\n\nHow long will this legal process take?\n\n\u201cIn the coming weeks, attorneys for Ronaldo will answer the complaint and in doing so almost certainly deny the core allegations,\u201d says McCann. \u201cThereafter the legal process will proceed and attorneys for Ronaldo will argue the case should be dismissed.\"\n\nAccording to McCann, it can take months and even years to reach a decision on whether to uphold or void a settlement\n\nIf the settlement is nullified, Mayorga\u2019s lawsuit will advance and the additional details of her account further scrutinised. This, too, would take months, with both sides required to share evidence and give testimony.\n\nWhat about the police investigation?\n\nAccording to McCann, the greatest worry for Ronaldo will be whether criminal charges of sexual assault are made against him by Las Vegas police. If this were to happen \u2013 and that\u2019s a big \u2018if\u2019 \u2013 US authorities would demand the extradition of the footballer.\n\nMcCann believes the likelihood of him being charged for an incident that occurred in 2009 is low. Given the nine years that have passed since the alleged rape, witness recollections and evidence are unlikely to be as persuasive as they would have been in the immediate aftermath of the incident, McCann says. In addition to this, he explains, the fact police did not chase up Mayorga\u2019s claims in 2009 suggest there may be elements to her account which don\u2019t stand up and, as a result, would be knocked down in court.\n\nNonetheless, Ronaldo and his team will have cause for concern, according to McCann. That Las Vegas police feel justified in reopening a case from 2009 suggests they\u2019re following up on Mayorga\u2019s information and may now have access to new evidence. What could this be? At the moment, we don\u2019t know. But given Der Spiegel claims to possess the damning documentation in which Ronaldo admits to raping Mayorga, there\u2019s every chance the German publication has handed over this content to the relevant authorities.\n\nWhether or not a court of law and police investigators will be able to use this apparent material \u2013 given the manner in which it was acquired by Der Spiegel, via Football Leaks, and its possible breach of attorney-client privilege \u2013 adds another complex layer to the case.\n\nWhere does Ronaldo fit into all of this?\n\n\u201cRonaldo has leverage in terms of cooperation [with the police] because he cannot be compelled to appear in Las Vegas at this point,\u201d McCann told The Independent. \u201cIf he cooperates he might only agree to do so by video conference and by answering questions in writing. He might also be willing to share electronic evidence.\n\n\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t cooperate, the police could take a negative inference from his lack of cooperation,\u201d he adds. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean he would be charged with a crime, but lack of cooperation can make law enforcement more suspicious about a person.\"", "description": "It\u2019s a story that has the potential to shake the sports world to its core: Cristiano Ronaldo \u2013 a five-time Ballon d\u2019Or winner and one of the greatest footballers of our time \u2013 has been accused of rape.
