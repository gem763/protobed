Since Warby Parker shook up the eyeglasses industry back in 2010, numerous direct-to-consumer (DTC) companies have cropped up. Many send items in beautiful boxes and envelopes that eliminate the need for you to do anything more than peel yourself off the couch and walk to the mailbox.\n\nBut would you be just as excited to open a box of cleaning supplies, razors or toothbrush heads? A crop of companies, including Quip (electric toothbrushes), Billie (razors), Grove Collaborative (cleaning products), Skura Style (kitchen sponges) and Chewy (pet supplies), deliver the more mundane necessities to your home.\n\nSeveral come in colorful but minimalist packaging seemingly inspired by Glossier, the makeup and skin-care company whose simple aesthetic is often seen as the paragon of millennial-targeted advertising. The companies advertise on Instagram and podcasts popular with one of the global economy\u2019s most valuable customer groups. Research from Accenture projects that spending by people between ages 20 and 40 will reach $1.4 trillion annually and will represent 30 percent of all retail sales in the United States by 2020. So what speaks to this demographic?\n\n[Your phone and laptop probably won\u2019t make you sick (but you should still clean them)]\n\nSome of the popular boxes are curated to suit the customer\u2019s needs, while some \u2014 such as Quip, Skura Style and Billie \u2014 replenish items that need to be replaced regularly. (The American Dental Association recommends replacing toothbrushes and toothbrush heads every three to four months; the American Academy of Dermatology advises people change razor blades after five to seven shaves.)\n\nLiz Cadman, founder of subscription box review company My Subscription Addiction, has seen an increase in the number of replenishment boxes on the market. Her team of reviewers assigns ratings to boxes of products ranging from underwear to cleaning supplies, based on factors such as price and ease of delivery. She says the boxes that typically draw high marks from reviewers and customers deliver these variables plus something extra.\n\n\u201cCustomers want a good value, a brand they can trust, quality products, and some element of delight,\u201d she said in an email. For example, Billie eliminates the \u201cpink tax,\u201d an added cost in some states to women\u2019s care products such as tampons and razors, and Grove Collaborative sells only sustainably produced cleaning products with plant-based ingredients.\n\nHowever, Sucharita Kodali, an analyst at research firm Forrester, says that for products to survive competition, they generally have to perform as well as or better than the main competitors in their category at a similar price point. \u201cUltimately I think the challenge with these products are the same problem that Diane von Furstenberg had with her wrap dress. Everyone just starts to copy it,\u201d she says. \u201cTarget or Walgreens can easily mimic the style attributes of these DTC companies in their private label offerings if they want to.\u201d\n\n[How charcoal escaped the grill and ended up in your toothpaste and your face cream]\n\nCompanies in the home industry have to overcome a major hurdle: Many of their products are similar in price and quality to their competitors, Kodali says.\n\n\u201cThe pool of people who are in the market for toothbrushes is much bigger than the pool of people who are in the market for luggage at any point in time,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, the challenge is, do you have a pain point right now that you\u2019re experiencing in your soap or your toothbrush or any of these commodity purchases that demands that you go to this particular product?\u201d\n\nShe adds that because most products in the home category are impulse purchases in physical stores, brands generally need to deliver extras such as free shipping, admirable company values or appealing packaging to initially entice customers. Because these items tend to be relatively cheap compared with other consumer goods, consumers might feel more at ease trying them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the whole package of their offerings,\u201d Kodali says. \u201cPeople like to try new things and they often like the story, the quality of the product is decent, they have good customer service, they allow returns, so they take a lot of the friction out of buying. But are they the only brand that you will buy in that category again?\u201d\n\nSome brands have expanded into traditional retail stores. Alana Bracken, a 24-year-old writer who lives in Manhattan, heard about Quip through advertisements on social media but purchased her electric toothbrush when she saw it at Target for $30. She\u2019d been using a manual toothbrush before and now gets refills from Quip delivered to her house every three months for about $5.\n\nFor Bracken, price is a major factor that influences her subscription choices. When she was in college, she received a Birchbox subscription as a gift, but she canceled it after about six months because she couldn\u2019t justify the price point and \u201cdidn\u2019t feel like it was improving my quality of life.\u201d She\u2019s had her Quip for nine months and said she will probably continue using it barring a major increase in price. \u201cIt\u2019s frankly a great toothbrushand I feel like it cleans your mouth a little better than a manual, and I really like having two minutes counted out because I\u2019m not going to sit there with a timer on my phone.\u201d\n\nShe doesn\u2019t see herself subscribing to a box for cleaning supplies, however, because it\u2019s easy for her to run to the store when she needs to buy more. \u201cEven if you\u2019re barely adulting, you can go down to the drugstore and pick up a bottle of Windex when you run out,\u201d she says. \u201cWith a toothbrush, you\u2019re not keeping track on your calender when the three months is up and it keeps me accountable to my oral health \u2014 whereas I don\u2019t see the value for me with cleaning supplies.\u201d\n\nShumaisa Ahmed, a 23-year-old consultant who lives in the District, subscribes to Billie. She wasn\u2019t tied to a specific razor brand previously and would sort through the options at Target and CVS mostly based on what appeared to be high quality at a good price. She says she\u2019d spend between $10 and $15 but wasn\u2019t replacing her razors often and sometimes had trouble matching the reusable blades to the handles.\n\nShe signed up to get a refill every three months and has so far only received one round, but she\u2019s happy with the product. \u201cI like it and I think it\u2019s a good razor, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s revolutionary or anything,\u201d she says. Although she heard about the product on a podcast, she says the company\u2019s advertisements aren\u2019t the main factor that drove her purchase and that she is aware of the brand\u2019s marketing tactics. \u201cI do think these are all part of a bucket of digitally-native brands that target millennials and I don\u2019t want to be manipulated by them,\u201d she says. \u201cMainly I like it because it\u2019s a good razor, it ships to me and it looks nice in my shower.\u201d\n\nHeather Comeau values the convenience services that brands such as Chewy provide. The 48-year-old Alexandria, Va., resident pays $49 every two or three months to get cat litter delivered to her door (she adds other items such as cat food to reach the $49 minimum for free shipping). She pays about $9 for 20 pounds of Tidy Cats litter through Chewy \u2014 about the same as store price. Before becoming a Chewy customer, she bought litter for her two cats, Billy and Chirpy, mostly at Harris Teeter but had trouble lugging the bags up to her third-floor apartment. Now the delivery person does it. She says she wouldn\u2019t continue the service if the company stopped delivering right to her door. She also likes a side benefit: \u201cThe box becomes a toy for the cats,\u201d she says.\n\nIn many cases, Kodali says, what drives consumers to purchase goods comes back to the price. \u201cThere needs to be something that gives you a compelling reason to try it and that it\u2019s at least priced similarly to what you\u2019d get otherwise, or you at least get some feature like more refills that could be valuable.\u201d", "description": "A wave of direct-to-consumer companies want to eliminate the need for you to do anything more than peel yourself off the couch and walk to the mailbox.", "authors": ["Helen Carefoot", "Helen Carefoot Is A Writer", "Editorial Aide For The Washington Post'S Features Section.
