His two-day visit includes a meeting with the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, who arrives Sunday with a U.N. Security Council delegation.\n\nThe delegation is expected to encourage progress in the peace deal signed a year ago but fraught with delays.\n\nBoth Kiir and Machar will meet with the delegation Sunday, government spokesman Michael Makuei said.\n\nThe opposition has said Machar won\u2019t return to South Sudan for good to form the government by the Nov. 12 deadline unless security arrangements are in place.\n\nThe U.S. has said it will reevaluate its relationship with South Sudan if that deadline is missed.\n\nThe civil war killed almost 400,000 people and displaced millions.\n\nBefore Machar\u2019s return a unified army of 41,500 opposition and government soldiers needs to be ready along with a 3,000-person VIP protection force.\n\nBut so far there are only 1,000 unified soldiers and security arrangements won\u2019t meet the deadline, deputy opposition spokesman Manawa Peter Gatkuoth said.\n\nThe previous Machar-Kiir meeting focused on speeding up the screening and reunification of forces, but parties left the talks with differing views.\n\nDeputy chairman for the opposition Henry Odwar called the meeting \u201clukewarm,\u201d while Makuei called it \u201chighly successful\u201d and said everything was on track for next month\u2019s deadline.\n\n___\n\nFollow Africa news at https://twitter.com/AP_Africa", "description": "JUBA, South Sudan (AP) \u2014 South Sudan opposition leader Riek Machar returned to the country Saturday to meet with President Salva Kiir less than a month", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/19/9e8742_south-sudan-67854-south-sudan-opposition-leader-riek-machar-left-is-greeted-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
