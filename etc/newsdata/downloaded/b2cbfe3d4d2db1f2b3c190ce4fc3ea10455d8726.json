The countdown is on!\"\n\nSharp was released from jail after serving just three months of her one-year term for stalking two former friends, creating fake social media profiles while tormenting them.\n\nWhen she was sentenced at Livingston Sheriff Court in July, she wept in the dock and a judge blasted her for her \"disgraceful and wicked\u201d terror campaign against Maggie Paton, 58, and her husband Steve.\n\nSharp sent emails to the couple\u2019s workplaces with false claims they were involved in criminal activity, including dealing drugs to kids.\n\n(Image: Daily Record)\n\nMr Paton, 60, hit out at Sharp following her release, telling the Daily Record: \u201cThere is a total lack of remorse for what she put us through.\n\nThis obsession she has with champagne is sad but we won\u2019t be intimidated by her.\n\n\u201cIt seems ridiculous that Sharp was sentenced to 12 months but only served three and is out before Christmas.\n\n\u201cBut the whole world now knows what she did after she admitted it in court.\n\n\"She is the type to just keep squirming and denying everything but even her friends and family know she is an obsessive stalker and fantasist.\n\n(Image: Daily Record)\n\n\u201cShe may have got out of jail early but her reputation has been destroyed forever by what she did to us.\n\n\"She is a laughing stock at Ibrox and you would have to be off your head to believe she is innocent after all the details emerged in court.\u201d\n\nAfter her release from jail Sharp reactivated her Facebook account and posted the snaps of her and Hale celebrating with champagne.\n\nThe couple both still live with their parents.\n\nIn one photo, they are seen wearing matching Rangers pyjamas.\n\nBut fans have made it clear they are not welcome at old haunts such as the well-known Rangers pub the Louden Tavern.\n\nOne wrote on Twitter : \u201cAll joking aside, disgraceful those two maniacs still think it\u2019s acceptable to post the stuff they do.\n\n\u201cWelcome Home balloons, the lot, knowing the fact it\u2019ll get a reaction and she will be bold enough to flaunt herself in the Louden the next home game.\u201d\n\nIn the comments under Sharp's Facebook photos, her friends wrote \"welcome back\" and one even joked \"where did u disappear to\", which Sharp responded to with a laughing emoji.\n\nOne friend wrote: \"Good to see you with the rangers top back on.\"\n\nSharp replied: \"Thank you very much! It sure feels good lol!\"\n\nDuring Sharp\u2019s sentencing, Sheriff Douglas Kinloch said she \u201csucceeded\u201d in ruining the Patons\u2019 lives, leaving them on medication and unable to work for lengthy periods.\n\nRelated video:\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nHe said he had considered calling for a psychiatric assessment of Sharp in a bid to shed light on her behaviour.\n\nBut he didn\u2019t believe such a report could explain her \u201cdeliberate and malicious\u201d crimes, which showed a \u201chigh degree of planning\u201d.\n\nIn February 2017, it was reported that Sharp had stalked a man who was a complete stranger to her.\n\nShe created a fake second life using photos Graham McQuet and his fianc\u00e9e Marianne Stirling had posted on social media.\n\nSharp copied their movements so she could be pictured in places they had visited, then posted loved-up snaps online..\n\nShe set up a fake Twitter page for her \"boyfriend\" and sent romantic messages between them, as well as explicit details of an imaginary sex life.\n\nIain Smith, defending, told the court: \u201cShe takes no pleasure in what she did.
