And how did the landing clap, as some call it, evolve in the first place?\n\nPicture this: You\u2019re 31. You just married your soulmate and are on your way to your beautiful honeymoon.The plane lands in Bora Bora, as it touches the ground your wife begins clapping. She\u2019s an airplane clapper. You get on a plane right back to America and you never speak again. \u2014 gregg (@Gregggyboy) May 24, 2018\n\nLet\u2019s take the second question first: No one seems to know. The subject has been thoroughly debated on message boards and sites including Quora, Reddit and Airliners.net. Everyone has an opinion. There is no clear origin story, though there are a few common scenarios for clapping: at the end of a particularly harrowing flight or long delay; in celebration of a return to one\u2019s homeland; or in continuation of a tradition that started who-knows-when-or-why.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s two different constituencies: the fearful fliers and the happy nationalists,\u201d says Daniel Levine, a travel trends expert. \u201cAnd those two converge in an airplane.\u201d\n\nSlate explored the topic two years ago and came to the questionable conclusion that plane clapping does not happen \u2014 and when it does, the smatterings of applause are merely \u201cfreak events.\u201d Digging into the furthest reaches of flight history, the story quotes David McCullough\u2019s biography of Wilbur and Orville Wright and finds that the earliest exhibitions of flying were greeted with zero fanfare.\n\n\u201cThere were no spectators and no applause save the booming of the surf and the startled cries of the sea birds,\u201d the book says, according to Slate\u2019s report.\n\n[Checking a bag vs. carrying on is the great debate of airline travel]\n\nIn its own dive into the phenomenon in 2017, Mic discovered, through the work of the Museum of Flight, that the first recorded case of landing and clapping came in a Cincinnati Enquirer article in 1948. The article described an American Airlines flight with a malfunction that involved the landing gear. The flight ultimately landed safely, and \u201call of the passengers clapped their hands in thankful relief,\u201d according to the article.\n\n\n\n(Laur\u00e8ne Boglio for The Washington Post)\n\nClark McPhail, who taught sociology at the University of Illinois and studied collective actions, said he frequently encountered that type of clapping in turbulence-plagued travels to both coasts.\n\n\u201cMy impression was that when we were on a bouncy flight, when the pilot finally landed the plane, people were relieved,\u201d said McPhail, who now lives in Virginia. \u201cAnd they were applauding the pilot\u2019s skill in getting them from point A to point B and getting there safely and putting an end to the suspense of, \u2018Is the next turbulence we hit going to be the one that brings us all to an unanticipated ending?\u2019 \u201d\n\nSome travelers responding to a query about clapping from the Points Guy, a travel website, said they had witnessed it at airports that make for notoriously difficult (or difficult-seeming) landings. That gets us back to the scorn-heaped-upon clappers, who may be seen as untraveled rubes.\n\n\u201cMy guess is those people are veteran fliers and they\u2019re saying, \u2018You\u2019re wimps,\u2019 \u201d McPhail said. \u201cThis is part of traveling by airplane.\"\n\n[The completely correct guide to getting off a plane]\n\nLevine wrote about the \u201cseemingly spontaneous ovation that often accompanies an aircraft\u2019s safe return to terra firma\u201d in 1997 for the International Herald Tribune and did not praise the practice.\n\n\u201cTo me the display suggests a lack of sophistication that only serves to identify the infrequent fliers on board,\u201d he wrote.\n\nLevine, who flies about every two weeks for work as a keynote speaker, said he spots plane clappers regularly, usually on international flights \u2014 and still admits to a bit of snobbishness about it: \u201cI\u2019ve never been caught dead clapping.\u201d\n\nOthers, including frequent travelers, take the opposite approach. Earlier this month, \u201cHamilton\u201d creator Lin-Manuel Miranda tweeted a video of himself giving a round of applause as soon as a plane landed with the message: \u201cHow you find out if you\u2019re the only Latino on the flight.\u201d\n\nHow you find out if you\u2019re the only Latino on the flight. pic.twitter.com/jvhu7ZaYSN \u2014 Lin-Manuel Miranda (@Lin_Manuel) September 4, 2019\n\nResponses suggested Miranda might have had company from travelers who were German, Romanian, Italian, Portuguese, Jamaican, Polish, Israeli, etc., especially if they were landing at their home airports. Although few claimed to be clappers themselves, many said they were familiar with the practice from their own travel history.\n\nAirlines also acknowledge the phenomenon. Last year, JetBlue released a video celebrating the tradition of the landing clap in Puerto Rico. And a spokeswoman for Israeli carrier El Al told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel in 2013 that clapping upon touchdown was \u201cpart of the spirit of the airline.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople get very excited as they\u2019re about to land, and one way of showing that enthusiasm is to applaud,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s owned by anybody,\u201d Levine said. \u201cI think it is a universal expression that can be shared cross-culturally. In that way, it\u2019s kind of nice. It\u2019s one of those things that you don\u2019t need language to understand.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nCelebrities have a thing for sanitizing airplane seats.
