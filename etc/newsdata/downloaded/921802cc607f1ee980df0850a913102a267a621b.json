When the family assembled at the dinner table that evening, the new household manager could hardly restrain his enthusiasm. Laughingly, he said to his wife: \u2018See now, Mary, what I have done. Ten cakes. Ten! When you were running the house we had only one, or two at most. Ah, the logical, orderly, efficient brain of a man is needed even in the kitchen, that sacred province of woman. In one day I have revolutionized the business of cooking, and have put it on a sound basis.\u2019\n\nThe cakes were good, and the family ate almost a whole one with relish. They were persuaded to finish it. But there were still nine left. By good salesmanship the industrialist-turned-cook induced the family to eat another, which they did to please him, but they had no relish for it. At this point Mr. Jones found himself confronted with the same problem which he had to face every day in his business \u2014 he would have to sell more. Inventory would have to be reduced, unit costs slashed. That could be done only by stimulating demand and increasing consumption. So he employed the cash rebate system, offering small William a dime to place his order for a large section of the third cake. William saw that it was a consumer\u2019s market; he knew that such wonders are unnatural and impermanent, and could not resist stocking up. In the end, by using every known trick of the salesman\u2019s art, Mr. Jones coaxed, wheedled, and bribed the family to dispose of the third cake. By this time everybody had arrived at a stage of acute discomfort and complete indifference to further entreaties, and he recognized the symptoms of a saturated market.\n\nThat night the family physician kept busy ministering to varying degrees of indigestion from mild to acute. The care with which Mrs. Jones had nurtured the family stood them in good stead, however, and all were fairly well recovered by morning.\n\nAt breakfast Mrs. Jones said to her husband: \u2018Of course you realize the doctor\u2019s fees will have to come out of your budget. It was all your fault.\u2019\n\n\u2018But I have no reserves set for that,\u2019 replied Mr. Jones. \u2018You know that before we changed places I always paid the doctor. His bill shouldn\u2019t be charged against the household budget.\u2019\n\n\u2018Just the same,\u2019 said Mrs. Jones, \u2018I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll have to add it to your production costs. Then next time you\u2019ll know better than to glut the market.\u2019\n\nFor once Mr. Jones had nothing to say, and his wife continued: \u2018Fortunately, we shall not want any more cake for a long time to come. But when we do, you can bake ten, if you must, and then throw away nine. You can\u2019t object to that. I understand that such methods are common in your economic world. \u201cMaintaining the market,\u201d \u2014 isn\u2019t that what you call it? It won\u2019t be the first time food has been destroyed to maintain the market. And, of course, you manufacturers are constantly producing goods that go to waste because of lack of demand. So I shouldn\u2019t dare suggest that you bake only one cake merely because that is all we need. That would be heresy. It would be inefficient. It would be criminal failure to take advantage of \u201cplant capacity.\u201d The gas stove will easily hold ten cakes, and the same gas that will bake one will bake the others too. The electric mixer also represents an investment. You should not let it stand idle, for the overhead will ruin us. So go ahead with your plans, John. I just know you are going to do remarkable things in increasing and cutting unit costs \u2014 but don\u2019t forget to dispose of your surplus.\u2019", "description": "\u201cI am tempted to think that the perplexed businessman might discover a possible solution of his troubles if he would just spend a few days in his wife's kitchen.\u201d", "authors": ["Helen Keller"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/2018/01/2770/facebook.jpg?1523978060"}
