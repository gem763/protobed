We don\u2019t really know if it\u2019s an animal, if it\u2019s a fungus or if it\u2019s something between the two,\u201d\n\n\u2013 Can it think? \u2013\n\nLong considered a fungus, the blob was reclassified in the 1990s in the group of myxomycetes or slime moulds, a subcategory of the amoeba family.\n\n\u201cIt is capable of memory, it is capable of adapting its behaviour, it is capable of solving problems, of moving around a labyrinth, of optimising solutions, of behaving a little like an animal. So it\u2019s a very curious being, a very curious living being,\u201d said David.\n\nOn its website, the zoo marvels at the blob\u2019s \u201csurprising abilities\u201d.\n\n\u201cEven though it has no mouth, stomach or eyes, it can detect the presence of food and ingest it\u2026 Cut into pieces, the blob will self-heal in two minutes! It does not have two different sexes, but close to 720, so reproduction is not a problem,\u201d it explains.\n\nThe creature can procreate on its own.\n\nBut as with most other species, survival is boosted by genetic diversity, which in the blob\u2019s case happens by two genetically-diverse organisms meeting and fusing into a new, single blob.\n\nA study published in 2016 redefined our understanding of intelligence by concluding that the blob, a creature with no central nervous system, can \u201clearn\u201d from experience and change its behaviour accordingly.\n\nIn lab experiments, scientists observed the slime adapt its route over a narrow bridge to a food source after they introduced an unpleasant, though not harmful, obstacle.\n\n\u2013 Hard to kill \u2013\n\nSloth-like propulsion does not make it an obvious crowd-puller, but the zoo has come up with a plan, setting up an interactive display that includes a speeded-up video of the blob advancing by extending finger-like protrusions called pseudopods.\n\nIt may move painfully slowly, but in ideal conditions, the blob can grow at breakneck speed \u2014 doubling in size every day.\n\nAnd it is hard to kill: when exposed to danger it goes into hibernation and dries out.\n\nIn this vegetative mode, \u201cit is nigh immortal,\u201d blob specialist Audrey Dussutour of France\u2019s CNRS research institute told AFP.\n\n\u201cYou can even put it in the microwave for a few minutes\u201d.\n\nBut just add a few drops of water, and \u201cvoila!\u201d the blob comes to life again, looking to feed and procreate, which it does by producing and releasing spores that grow into new, baby blobs.\n\n\u201cBlobs of any size can be created, there is no known limit\u201d, said Dussutour.\n\nBlobs up to 10 metres (33 feet) wide have been grown in the lab.", "description": "Paris (AFP) \u2013 The Paris zoo\u2019s latest attraction is a brainless, eyeless, single-celled organism with no limbs or stomach but more than 700", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/17/2370e9_paris-zoo-latest-attraction-is-strange-creature-brainless-eyeless-single-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
