Don\u2019t listen to Rand Paul,\u201d Graham said at a press conference, later doubling down on the point.\n\n\u201cListen to your commanders. General Paul is not a very good general,\u201d he added.\n\nGraham\u2019s salvos were risky, particularly since Trump is known for punching back hard at his critics \u2014 Democrats and Republicans alike.\n\nThat propensity was on display Wednesday when Trump accused Graham of wanting \u201cto stay in the Middle East for the next thousand years with thousands of soldiers fighting other people\u2019s wars.\u201d\n\nGraham pushed back on that attack Thursday during a press conference by rolling out legislation to sanction Turkey for its recent attacks on the Kurds.\n\n\u201cHe made a remark about me \u2014 I want to be there a thousand years \u2014 no, I want to be there long enough until we\u2019re safe,\u201d Graham said.\n\n\u201cI have been in war zones. I\u2019ve spent 33 years in the military and I\u2019ve had some friends killed. So this is no casual thing for me. I don\u2019t love war. What I crave is security,\u201d he added, his voice rising, in a possible reference to the fact that Trump did not have to serve in the Vietnam War because of academic deferments and bone spurs.\n\n\u201cMr. President, if you don\u2019t understand that ISIS is coming back, you\u2019re missing a lot of good advice. If you don\u2019t understand these bastards would kill us all if they could, you\u2019re not listening to what they\u2019re saying,\u201d he said, looking directly into the TV cameras.\n\nGraham said he is less worried about his friendship with Trump than the threat his foreign policy could reverse years of hard-won gains against ISIS, the group that supplanted Al Qaeda as the biggest terror threat facing the U.S.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not worried about anything other than our national security. People in South Carolina trust my judgment or I wouldn\u2019t be here. People in South Carolina believe know what I\u2019m talking about but more importantly people in South Carolina respect the military and hope the commander-in-chief would follow good advice,\u201d he said.\n\nIn an interview with Greta Van Susteren, Graham later downplayed the tension with Trump and declared \u201che\u2019s got the thickest hide I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou work with him one day, fight with him the next. I don\u2019t agree with what he\u2019s doing in Syria. I want him to be successful and I think he sees that,\u201d Graham said.\n\nGraham argued he merely wants Trump to follow the advice of his top military commanders, who reportedly opposed the decision to pull U.S. troops out of key positions, giving Turkey an easier path to attack Kurdish forces.\n\nThe Trump-Graham feud hit a boiling point Wednesday after Graham blasted the decision to shift troops, calling it \u201cthe biggest mistake\u201d of Trump\u2019s presidency and warning it would put the United States at risk.\n\nGraham slammed the president for \u201cnot listening to his advisers\u201d and characterized Trump\u2019s belief that the Kurds are better off without U.S. intervention as \u201cunbelievable.\u201d\n\nHe also warned that Trump\u2019s Syria policy could wind up being \u201ca disaster worse than President Obama\u2019s decision to leave Iraq.\u201d\n\nTrump didn\u2019t take kindly to the critiques. He suggested Graham butt out of the foreign policy debate altogether and said he \u201cshould focus right now on judiciary,\u201d referring to Graham\u2019s role as chairman of the Senate Judiciary panel.\n\nUpon being informed of Trump\u2019s comments, Graham said, \u201cI will not ever be quiet \u2014 I will not ever be quiet about matters of national security.\"\n\nGraham has a history of clashing with Trump and later patching things up.\n\nHe blasted Trump ahead of the 2016 GOP presidential primary as a \u201crace-baiting, xenophobic, religious bigot\u201d after Trump announced his proposal to ban people from certain predominantly Muslim countries from traveling to the United States.\n\nHe also warned Republicans would \u201cget destroyed\u201d and \u201cdeserve it\u201d if they nominated Trump for president.\n\nBut Graham walked away from those criticisms after Trump defeated Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonJill Stein: 'I am not a Russian spy' Trump criticizes Clinton for suggesting Jill Stein was Russian asset Graham: I'm seeking to make Trump successful 'but not at all costs' MORE. He later became one of the president\u2019s golfing buddies and a close adviser, regularly chatting with him over the phone.\n\nWhile the two publicly feuded over Syria, they still kept in contact.\n\nGraham noted that he was on a phone call between Trump and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan on Tuesday, when the Turkish leader promised to stay away from a Kurdish area of Syria.\n\nHe said he spoke a day later with Trump and Erdo\u011fan, adding they had a \u201cpretty good\u201d roadmap for stemming the fighting between Turkish and Kurdish forces.\n\n\u201cWe had a pretty good plan in place,\u201d Graham said, noting that Tuesday\u2019s phone call laid the groundwork for peace talks Thursday between Erdo\u011fan, Vice President Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Michael (Mike) Richard PompeoErdo\u011fan got the best of Trump, experts warn Graham: I'm seeking to make Trump successful 'but not at all costs' Ex-Watergate prosecutor says evidence in impeachment inquiry 'clearly' points to Trump MORE.\n\nGraham on Thursday received a heads-up from Trump about the agreement for Turkey to suspend military activity in Syria to give Kurdish forces a chance to withdraw.\n\n\u201cSounds like we may have made real progress regarding a cease-fire and hopefully a sustainable solution that will prevent the reemergence of ISIS and the abandonment of our ally, the Kurds,\u201d Graham tweeted after Trump called him with the news from Air Force One.\n\nSen.
