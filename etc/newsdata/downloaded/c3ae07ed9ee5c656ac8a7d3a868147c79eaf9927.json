(ABBV) rose more than 2% on Thursday amid an upgrade and positive comments from analysts at Citigroup.\n\nCiti upgrade AbbVie to \"buy\" from \"neutral\" and raised its price target to $90 from $87 amid a positive view of the biopharmaceutical company's pending $63 billion takeover of Allergan Inc. (AGN).\n\nThe analysts said they expect AbbVie will extract significant shareholder value from Allergan's franchises, adding that the deal dilutes AbbVie's exposure to loss of U.S. patent exclusivity for its blockbuster Humira, the world's biggest-selling drug.\n\nCiti also said the market underappreciates the revenue potential of AbbVie's Skyrizi and Rinvoq.\n\nShares of AbbVie were recently up 2.2% to $73.67.\n\nWrite to Colin Kellaher at colin.kellaher@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 26, 2019 12:04 ET (16:04 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
