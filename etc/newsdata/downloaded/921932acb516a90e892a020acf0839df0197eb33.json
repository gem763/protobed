Claudia Tenney got swept out of Congress in 2018 on an anti-Trump wave. But she thinks the president could bring her back next year.\n\nThe one-term congresswoman lost to freshman Rep. Anthony Brindisi (D-N.Y.) by less than 2 points in the last election. But in 2016, this upstate New York district went for Donald Trump by more than 15 points.\n\nAnd with Trump back on the ballot in 2020, Tenney and her supporters see a chance to make her comeback.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a good year,\u201d Tenney said in an interview. \u201cIn a presidential year, I think we\u2019ll be able to get some of those gains back.\u201d\n\nAnd she\u2019s not the only one. A series of ex-Republican lawmakers who lost narrowly in Trump strongholds in 2018 are plotting rematches next year with dreams of riding on the president\u2019s coattails.\n\nParticularly amid an impeachment debate that has polarized the country, the former lawmakers think a juiced-up Trump turnout will lift them past their Democratic opponents and potentially help Republicans win back the House.\n\n\n\nFormer GOP Rep. David Young is running against freshman Democrat Cindy Axne in a district that includes Des Moines, Iowa \u2014 a repeat of the tight 2018 race. Former GOP Rep. Karen Handel is seeking a rematch against Rep. Lucy McBath, a Democrat representing suburban Atlanta.\n\nAnother former Republican congressman, Rod Blum, could be eyeing a challenge to freshman Democratic Rep. Abby Finkenauer in northeast Iowa; he protested outside Finkenauer\u2019s office this month at a Trump campaign-sponsored event to condemn impeachment. And former Republican Rep. Mike Bishop has yet to publicly rule out a run against Democrat Elissa Slotkin in Michigan.\n\n\u201cIt was a tough year, just not a great environment for Republicans,\u201d Tenney said of 2018. \u201cI think the environment now is different.\u201d\n\nBut Tenney and other the congressional alumni may not be able to count on Trump. His approval ratings are near historic lows for presidents heading into a second term, and freshman Democrats have worked hard to win over independents and moderate Republicans.\n\nPublic support is also growing for impeachment, with 45 percent of independents now backing it, compared to 32 opposed, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll this week.\n\nKaren Handel lost to Lucy McBath in the Atlanta suburbs in 2018 but will be trying to win the seat back. More\n\nStill, Trump holds a grip over the Republican base that seems unshakable, even amid the ongoing investigation into alleged efforts by the president to withhold military aid unless Ukraine publicly investigated his political rivals.\n\nTrump\u2019s most ardent supporters have already begun organizing in Brindisi\u2019s district, more than a year out from the next election. Pro-Trump groups staged protests outside the freshman Democrat\u2019s office and at some of his public events \u2014 including a town hall here in October \u2014 to rally local support in New York\u2019s 22nd Congressional District.\n\nMany of those who have picketed, including Mount Vernon, N.Y. resident Gilda Ward, have focused squarely on Democrats\u2019 impeachment push. And it doesn\u2019t matter to them that Brindisi, one of the most vulnerable freshmen, remains one of seven holdouts in his caucus who oppose the impeachment inquiry.\n\nIf he did come out in favor, Ward predicts, \u201cIt would be a death knell.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am totally opposed to any kind of impeachment,\u201d she said in an interview after attending a Brindisi town hall. \u201cIt really bothers me, and it bothers many of us who voted for Trump.\u201d", "description": "Former Rep.
