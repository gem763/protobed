It felt like a nightmare. It changed everything for me, I felt it in my day to day, in my moods.\u201d\n\nFernandez, who is seen as more of a centre-left moderate than his running mate, was the cabinet chief to deceased president Nestor Kirchner. He served briefly in the government Fernandez de Kirchner, Nestor\u2019s wife, before the two parted ways in a dispute over farming tariffs.\n\nHe maintained a relatively low profile until May, when Fernandez de Kirchner shocked observers who had assumed she would run for president, by instead tapping Fernandez to lead the ticket under the banner Frente de Todos (Front for All). Fernandez de Kirchner, who is dogged by allegations of corruption, remains a divisive political figure in Argentina, but commands a strong political block.\n\nA photo of former president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner and running mate of presidential candidate Alberto Fernandez amid a crowd of supporters. [Ricardo Moraes/Reuters]\n\nReality bites\n\nThe Fernandez Fernandez ticket beat Macri by 16 points in the presidential primaries in August, making it seem like an inevitable return to power for Peronismo, a political movement that has come to represent the working class and is named after Juan Domingo Peron, a military leader who ruled in the 40s and 50s, and then again in the 1970s.\n\nFernandez officially assumes office on December 10.\n\nIn the meantime, he will be staring down the grim economic indicatorsthat have been eating away at the third largest economy in Latin America. Poverty is up 8 points in the last year, at more than 35 percent. Unemployment has grown, thousands of small businesses have shuttered and inflation, a chronic problem in Argentina, is expected to hit 55 percent by the end of the year.\n\nHe didn\u2019t see the reality that people were living Sandra Suarez, voter\n\nMacri, who adopted neoliberal policies throughout his term like cutting subsidies and liberalising the market, was blamed for the deteriorating economic situation. After his striking defeat in the primaries, he focused his campaign on shoring up his base with more right wing rhetoric.\n\nFernandez has talked about encouraging small businesses to open by reducing tariffs, about boosting pensions for retirees, and about renegotiating a record $57-billion pact with the International Monetary Fund so that it is less onerous on average Argentines.\n\nAnalysts agree that Fernandez will not have a lot of room to manoeuvre economically speaking, and he will not be given a lot of time by the electorate that is desperate for things to improve.\n\nLast week, the Central Bank continued to pour hundreds of millions of dollars from its reserves into shoring up the value of the local currency that was weakening as uncertainty loomed over the results of the election. The official peso closed at 65 to the US dollar, and it was trading higher on the black market.\n\nThe economic crisis was a key issue for most people. The placards, from a demonstration last month, read: \"Macri, stop\" and \"IMF\". [Agustin Marcarian/Reuters]\n\nHope for revival\n\nFernando Crudo, 80, and his son, also Fernando Crudo, 48, both voted for Fernandez. They have a family business that manufactures laboratory equipment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been two years where things have been very, very tight,\u201d said Crudo, the elder, on the steps of his home in Buenos Aires. \u201cEverything is at a standstill. It is very, very obvious.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Peronists have always been about manufacturing and the average worker,\u201d said the younger Crudo, who hopes Fernandez will be able to stimulate consumer spending. \u201cAt least this is something different. Let\u2019s hope Alberto can revive things.\u201d\n\nVoters who supported Macri said while they did not expect to emerge victorious, they hoped a strong showing would remind the new government that they would be watching.\n\nVoters like Sol Szpryngier, 24, who does not consider herself loyal to any particular party, but supported Macri.\n\n\u201cAll things considered, I think his government was transparent. Yes they made mistakes, many mistakes,\u201d she said, but she doesn\u2019t agree with the vision presented by Fernandez and Fernandez, and she worried about corruption taking root in the government.\n\nSandra Suarez, 58, voted for Macri in the last election but felt deceived by his economic performance, and opted for Fernandez this time.\n\nShe said she is not struggling economically, but she fears for her grown children and the uncertainty that has submerged the entire country.\n\n\u201cEverything Macri said he would do, they either didn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t deliver,\u201d said Suarez. \u201cHe didn\u2019t see the reality that people were living. There are a lot of people living in extreme poverty.\u201d", "description": "Economic crisis secures vote for left-leaning Fernandez, but quick fix to country's woes unlikely.", "authors": ["Natalie Alcoba"], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/28/e779aaabc03e4c85ad02720e379bf134_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
