Biden on Monday of enabling his son to profit from foreign connections when he was vice president, while the Biden campaign countered that Mr. Trump is trying to distract from his efforts to pressure Ukraine for dirt on the 2020 rival he most fears.\n\nIn the media spotlight of the annual United Nations gathering in New York and through his attorney, Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president blasted Mr. Biden and son Hunter as \u201ccorrupt.\u201d They said the younger Mr. Biden raked in millions of dollars from a Ukrainian gas company and more from a venture in China during his father\u2019s eight years in office.\n\n\u201cHis son took money from Ukraine, his son took money from China,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters.\n\nThe president declared later in the day, \u201cJoe Biden and his son are corrupt.\u201d\n\nMr. Giuliani, a former U.S. attorney in New York, took to the airwaves and social media to call on Democrats to investigate the Bidens for \u201cbig money selling public office.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Dem party doesn\u2019t call for an investigation of Bidens\u2019 millions from Ukraine and billions from China, they will own it,\u201d Mr. Giuliani tweeted.\n\nThe Biden campaign responded that the president is lashing out in desperation against the former vice president. Mr. Biden\u2019s top spokeswoman, Kate Bedingfield, also said Mr. Trump is trying to obscure his efforts to pressure Ukraine\u2019s president for damaging information about the Bidens, allegedly in return for U.S. military aid.\n\n\u201cWhat we have here is the president of the United States trying to pressure a foreign country to make up stuff about the political opponent at home that he fears the most \u2014 Joe Biden,\u201d Ms. Bedingfield said on MSNBC.\n\nIn Washington, the Democratic chairs of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Oversight and Reform, and Foreign Affairs committees sent a letter Monday to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo demanding documents related to the accusations that the president and Mr. Giuliani pressured the Ukrainian government to investigate the Bidens.\n\n\u201cSeeking to enlist a foreign actor to interfere with an American election undermines our sovereignty, democracy, and the Constitution, which the President is sworn to preserve, protect, and defend,\u201d wrote Democratic Reps. Adam B. Schiff of California, Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland and Eliot L. Engel of New York. \u201cYet the President and his personal attorney now appear to be openly engaging in precisely this type of abuse of power involving the Ukrainian government ahead of the 2020 election.\u201d\n\nThe story has gained in intensity and partisan fury since last week, when a government whistleblower\u2019s complaint came to light over Mr. Trump\u2019s phone call in late July with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The administration has refused to turn over the complaint to congressional Democrats, but an inspector general who reviewed it has deemed the matter \u201curgent.\u201d\n\nIn the call, Mr. Trump reportedly urged the Ukrainian leader to investigate the Bidens. At the time, the U.S. was debating whether to release $250 million in aid for Ukraine, which it later did, and added $140 million.\n\nThe president denied Monday that he pressured Mr. Zelensky in exchange for U.S. aid.\n\n\u201cI did not make a statement that \u2018You have to do this or I am not going to give you aid,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that. I put no pressure on them whatsoever. I could have.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump said his conversation with the Ukrainian leader was \u201ca very honorable call.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was no pressure put on them whatsoever,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could probably, possibly have been OK if I did, but I didn\u2019t put any pressure on them whatsoever. You know why? Because they want to do the right thing, and they know about corruption. And they probably know that Joe Biden and his son are corrupt. They probably know that. Joe Biden and his son are corrupt.\u201d\n\nSen. Mitt Romney, Utah Republican and a frequent critic of Mr. Trump, said Monday that such disputes about the conversation\u2019s details indicate that the administration should release the transcript of the call to Congress.\n\n\u201cWhat has been alleged by some news sources is that the president asked for an investigation into Mr. Biden. That would be in my view very inappropriate and a very serious allegation itself, so let\u2019s find out what exactly what was said,\u201d Mr. Romney said Monday. He added that \u201cit would be very helpful\u201d to see the transcript.\n\nThe president and Mr. Giuliani are calling for investigations of Hunter Biden\u2019s pocketing of at least $3 million \u2014 $50,000 per month \u2014 for a job on the board of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma Holdings. He got the job in 2014 shortly after he was discharged from the Navy Reserves for testing positive for cocaine. His father was playing a prominent role in the Obama administration\u2019s foreign policy.\n\nHunter Biden, now 49, left the post in April when his term expired.\n\nThe $3 million was wired to Hunter Biden through accounts in Cyprus and Latvia, according to reports that The Washington Times did not independently verify.\n\nIn 2016, Mr. Biden visited Kyiv as vice president and threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees unless the country\u2019s leaders fired Ukraine\u2019s top prosecutor for alleged corruption. The prosecutor also was looking into the gas company, although Hunter Biden apparently was not a target.\n\nThe Bidens also have been implicated in a billion-dollar deal in China.\n\nIn his book \u201cSecret Empire,\u201d Peter Schweizer described a trip Mr. Biden and his son took to China in 2013 aboard Air Force Two. Less than two weeks later, Hunter Biden\u2019s law firm made a $1 billion deal with a subsidiary of the Chinese government\u2019s Bank of China. The deal later swelled to $1.5 billion, according to the book.\n\n\u201cA lot of money from China,\u201d Mr. Trump said Monday. \u201cChina would love nothing they\u2019d rather see than Biden get [elected]. Because they would take this great [trade] deal that we\u2019re about to make and they would really have themselves a deal.\u201d\n\nMr. Giuliani asked on Twitter how President Obama allowed the Bidens to make \u201cbig money selling public office\u201d and whether the Democrats will continue to condone and enable \u201cthis kind of pay-for-play.\u201d\n\nMr. Biden has said he did nothing wrong and that he never discussed the business deals with his son.\n\nInvestigative journalist John Solomon unearthed a stream of bank documents that showed over $3 million flowing from Burisma Holdings to Rosemont Seneca Partners LLC, a hedge fund run by Hunter Biden and his business partner, Devon Archer.\n\nRosemont received regular Burisma transfers of more than $166,000 a month in 2014 and 2015 while Mr. Biden was Mr. Obama\u2019s point man on Ukraine and as Russian troops were tormenting the country, according to those reports.\n\nThe fired prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, told Mr. Solomon that Hunter Biden was on a list of board members who would be interrogated in the Burisma corruption investigation.\n\nIn a speech last year at a Washington think tank, Mr. Biden boasted of threatening Ukrainian leaders in 2016 to fire the prosecutor.\n\n\u201cI looked at them and said, \u2018I\u2019m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money,\u2019\u201d Mr. Biden recalled telling then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko.\n\n\u201cWell, son of a bitch, he got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time,\u201d Mr. Biden told the Council on Foreign Relations event, insisting that Mr. Obama was aware of the threat.\n\nMr. Trump said he is the target of another \u201cDemocrat witch hunt\u201d with the whistleblower\u2019s complaint about his phone conversation with the president of Ukraine.\n\n\u201cHere we go again. They failed with Russia, they failed with recession, they failed with everything, and now they\u2019re bringing this up,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThe one who\u2019s got the problem is Biden. Biden did what they would like to have me do, except there\u2019s one problem \u2014 I didn\u2019t do it. What Biden did was wrong.\u201d\n\n\u2981 Rowan Scarborough and Tom Howell Jr. contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
