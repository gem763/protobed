Carriers like UPS and FedEx now deliver seven days a week, but the latter has severed most of its ties to Amazon to make itself available to other large customers expanding their e-commerce presence.\n\nWhere promises for two-day delivery could largely be handled by truck, the guarantees for speedier shipping necessitate the use of more air cargo capacity. Walmart and Target have been notable Amazon rivals that are successfully meeting the demand for faster delivery times, and while in-store pickup for online orders is a preferred method for same-day fulfillment, the need to get packages from warehouse to customer means air freight capacity is going to be a premium service.\n\nLike in the U.S., Amazon is the primary online shopping destination for Canadian consumers. A survey of the e-commerce market by the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) says 85% of Canadian consumers have made a purchase on Amazon compared to just 32% at runner-up Walmart. Amazon has quadrupled its same-day or one-day delivery reach within the country since 2015. Earlier this year, Amazon added 13 additional cities in Canada eligible for one-day Prime delivery.\n\nMarket dominance\n\nCargojet already completely owns the air freight market with a 95% share of the domestic overnight cargo business. While the carrier doesn't break out its e-commerce business separately, RBC says the segment was wholly responsible for Cargojet's rising total volumes over the past three years, which grew 7% in 2016 and 14% over the last two years, and there's more room to grow.\n\nCargojet had 100% on-time delivery rates during Amazon's 48-hour Prime Day event this year as it handled over 1 million pounds more than it does during a typical week while operating 23 additional flights.\n\nWhich helps explain why Amazon is buying into Cargojet. Under the agreement, the carrier will issue warrants to Amazon in two tranches. The first one gives the e-commerce leader the right to acquire a 9.9% stake in the company over six years at 91.78 Canadian dollars per share, but it's conditioned on Amazon increasing its usage of Cargojet's network up to CA$400 million in business volume (about $301 million). The second tranche gives Amazon warrants for an additional 5% of the company if it uses an additional CA$200 million worth of business volume after the first tranche vests at a price to be determined.\n\nAnalysts believe the agreement suggests Amazon doesn't want to establish its own air fleet in Canada as it has here. Amazon leases aircraft in the U.S. from Air Transport Services Group and Atlas Air Worldwide for its Amazon Air fleet, but after starting out with a small ownership position in the U.S. air freight carriers, it now owns a third or more of their stock.", "description": "This time it's the leading Canadian air freight carrier.", "authors": ["Rich Duprey", "The Motley Fool"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/hRcLzebfWStB4lXCZYXMaA--~B/aD0zNzk7dz03MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/motleyfool.com/0af6006b1e1287a6a1ad79ee82b6893a"}
