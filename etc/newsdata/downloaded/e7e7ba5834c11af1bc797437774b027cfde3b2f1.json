School has begun. Entire kindergarten classes are practicing how to duck and cover. Soon, your sons will learn the quickest way to hide beneath a desk.\n\nYou raise kids in America because you were born here, and you learned to love this country the hard way. You remember to lock doors. In the presumed safety of your home, you read \u201cBloomland,\u201d a debut novel by John Englehardt, whose narrator speaks to you directly about what matters today.\n\nYou don\u2019t remember when you started to fear the lone gunman. Now you\u2019re hoping your kids make it to college. It\u2019s the American Dream. When they get there, you worry that \u201cthis is what happens instead. A student\u201d \u2014 a young white man, most likely \u2014 \u201cwalks into the library during finals week with a modified Chinese-type SKS assault rifle, then opens fire, killing eleven students and an instructor.\u201d\n\nSuch is the existential command of the second-person perspective of \u201cBloomland,\u201d whose narrator reveals himself to be a college professor, a well-trodden trope. But like Don DeLillo in \u201cWhite Noise\u201d and R.O. Kwon in \u201cThe Incendiaries,\u201d Englehardt finds ample material on a fictional campus, this time in Arkansas at Ozarka University, driving distance from rural communities where four-wheelers flatten the blackberries between diaper middens. Trailer park country, birthing a dying idea of America, where security is just out of reach, \u201clike growing up with an ocean outside of your bedroom window that disappeared when you looked at it.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cyou\u201d of \u201cBloomland\u201d feels self-reflexive \u2014 a character talking to himself \u2014 but it is not. The \u201cyou\u201d in this book keeps changing. Sometimes it\u2019s the professor Eddie Bishop, whose wife Casey was the first to die. Other times, it\u2019s the tornado survivor and sorority pledge Rose. And, finally, the \u201cyou\u201d is the shooter, Eli, who lost his mother as a child, a tragedy that media accounts seize upon in collective desperation to find an individualized explanation for recurrent mass murder.\n\nCycling between these characters observed and addressed, \u201cBloomland\u201d juxtaposes the proximate with the predator, intermingling their perspectives until the flickering becomes a bloody tapestry of our beleaguered nation. The \u201cI\u201d of this commentary is Dr. Bressinger, Eddie\u2019s friend and colleague, from whose perspective emerges frankly impossible knowledge of his fellow protagonists\u2019 lives. But Bressinger acts as a kind of arbitrator, a humanistic \u201cI\u201d that softens the gaze of the reader even while invoking the aftermath of violence.\n\nEli\u2019s dissociation produces an overwhelming compulsion \u201cto understand something by destroying it,\u201d whereas Rose recovers from a childhood in foster care, after losing her grandmother and brother in a tornado and her mother to addiction, by making it into a sorority where she can perform the happiness she always wanted. Triggered by the shooting\u2019s effect on campus, Rose falters in her newly forged community but nonetheless finds a way to embrace the unheralded misfortunes of being born.\n\nWinner of the Dzanc Books Prize for Fiction, \u201cBloomland\u201d details a void in Eli that is also present in Rose, even before she is made to suffer the weight of male entitlement. After, \u201cit doesn\u2019t seem like anything terrible has happened, even though everything is wrong.\u201d\n\nCan there be a surer way to describe living in the numbed embrace of the modern news cycle of massacres \u2014 more mass shootings than days thus far this year \u2014 \u201cgetting soaked by death and never drying off completely,\u201d hoping that \u201cin time you will learn how to cope?\u201d\n\nWe must heal ourselves in real life. The beauty of literature teaches \u201cthat the trauma you go through can, if anything, prepare you to understand someone else.\u201d But there are risks to empathy, not the least of which is the uneasy sensationalism of a shooter whose sole contribution is the destruction of other people\u2019s futures.\n\n\n\nThe author John Englehardt. (Katharine Toombs)\n\nIn \u201cThe Source of Self-Regard,\u201d Toni Morrison demanded that we \u201cknow the difference between fever and the disease.\u201d Speaking to Eli, and through him, to the reader, Bressinger narrates, \u201cAnd if there\u2019s any way I can avoid sounding like your apologist, it\u2019s to say the one thing that will enable your ambush is how deeply normal it is, this mask you\u2019ve been taught to wear.\u201d\n\nIn this framework, shooters are the fever, and the disintegration of our familial and community connections is the disease.\n\nSad? Soldier on. Take a selfie. Such are the encouragements of rampant individualism.\n\nThat facade \u2014 \u201cevidence of a rift\u201d \u2014 haunts the face of every character in \u201cBloomland,\u201d including Eddie, who grieves the double loss of Casey \u2014 first to the long decay of their marriage and finally to Eli\u2019s depraved actions.\n\nLike his former student, Eddie longs for \u201can era of comfort and connection, before the people he loved turned into long corridors he was told not to enter. It makes you wonder if, all this time, maybe you and Eli were missing the same thing. Maybe you\u2019re different from each other only in degree, not in kind.\u201d\n\nAs a country, we wait with enforced resignation for \u201can absence that lives,\u201d our entire electorate complicit in that \u201cmoment in the library when the first cell phone started ringing, then another,\u201d whole campus buildings \u201cbuzzing with parents and friends calling these kids who weren\u2019t going to answer.\u201d\n\nScroll through the headlines and read about the next preventable massacre. Watch the hopes and prayers and guns flow freely.\n\nYou can hear those cellphones ringing. You hope you\u2019re not the one who dials.\n\nKristen Millares Young is the author of \u201cSubduction,\u201d a novel forthcoming from Red Hen Press on April 14, 2020.", "description": "John Englehardt\u2019s use of the second-person perspective creates an aching immediacy.", "authors": ["Kristen Millares Young", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/BgxVxQD7QWcrSk0q7GeryAaCV8s=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Y73TNDGTDYI6TE2DIDNVPT3KXU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
