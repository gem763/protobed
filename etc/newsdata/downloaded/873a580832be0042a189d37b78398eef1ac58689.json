Tourists may be unaware Japan IMPORTED Ebola in preparation for 2020 games\n\nThis particular \"defective variant\" of the virus the team uncovered lacked even the limited protein container found in other viruses, and instead merely had \"flanking genes\" in its structure. This means that the virus would not be able to invade a host on its own, which begs the question: how on Earth does it survive?\n\nThe team suggests that this virus, and any potential copycats it might have out there in the natural world, might exploit other viruses to do the heavy lifting of both transporting it around and helping it to infect host targets.\n\nA lot more research is required to fully understand what is going on here, but the discovery could upend our understanding of viruses in general while blasting open new doors of research into combatting some of humanity's greatest biological threats.\n\n\u201cWe may be facing an entirely new system of viral evolution,\u201d Mizutani says.\n\nWe are wondering how this new virus came to be, how it infects cells or how it develops a viral particle. Our future work will be on solving this mystery of viral evolution.\n\nAlso on rt.com DNA \u2018echoes\u2019 of ancient viruses could help to kill cancer, new research finds\n\nLike this story?
