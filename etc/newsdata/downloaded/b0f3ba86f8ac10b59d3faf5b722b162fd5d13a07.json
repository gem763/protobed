Outside of novelty acts like the International Sweethearts of Rhythm, which she joined in her youth, it was especially unusual for a woman to play the trumpet, which was considered a \u201cman\u2019s instrument.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf I was a piano player or just a singer, I would have no problem,\u201d Ms. Bryant later told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cBut when you start putting that iron to your mouth, you run into problems.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWith talent, persistence and a solid technique, she forced her way onto the male-dominated bandstand, setting an example for younger women in jazz.\n\nMs. Bryant arrived in Los Angeles from Texas in 1945, when the bebop innovations launched by Gillespie and Parker \u2014 a trumpeter and alto saxophonist, respectively \u2014 were taking hold in jazz.\n\nToo young to enter the nightclubs that lined Central Avenue in Los Angeles, Ms. Bryant stood outside, trumpet in hand, captivated by the new sound. She followed the musicians to after-hours jam sessions, where she sharpened her skills, often as the only woman in the room.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAt first I\u2019d hear the musicians say, \u2018She plays like a woman,\u2019 \u201d she told the Times. \u201cBut after a while, they said I played like a man \u2014 whatever that means.\u201d\n\nNotable deaths in 2019: Ric Ocasek, Valerie Harper, Ross Perot, Toni Morrison, and others we have lost this year share Share Email this link Share on Pinterest Share on LinkedIn View Photos View Photos Next Image Cokie Roberts | Cokie Roberts, a journalist and political commentator who became one of the most prominent Washington broadcasters of her era and championed young women in media during a long career with NPR and ABC News, died Sept. 17 in Washington. She was 75. Read the obituary (Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post)\n\nCritic Don Heckman, writing in JazzTimes magazine in 2007, called her \u201cthe world\u2019s best-known female jazz trumpeter,\u201d and she was featured in several books and films, including Judy Chaikin\u2019s 2014 documentary \u201cThe Girls in the Band.\u201d Chaikin called her \u201ca true original\u201d in an email. \u201cPerhaps her greatest contribution was to encourage and pave the way for the current generation of great young female jazz artists.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nExcept for two years in New York in the 1950s, Ms. Bryant made Los Angeles her base and came to be recognized as one of the city\u2019s outstanding trumpeters \u2014 or as she preferred, a \u201ctrumpetiste.\u201d She persevered through derision, unwanted sexual advances and a male-dominated musician\u2019s union.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThose male trumpet players guard those positions like a bulldog on a bone,\u201d she told NPR in 1993.\n\nShe led small combos and played alongside dozens of leading performers, including singer Billie Holiday, drummer Max Roach, pianist Hampton Hawes and saxophonists Dexter Gordon and Wardell Gray. She was appearing at a club in Hermosa Beach, Calif., in the early 1950s, with Parker in the audience.\n\n\u201cHe came in there and went up to the bandstand and asked if he could borrow a tenor [saxophone],\u201d Ms. Bryant told the Los Angeles Times in 2002. \u201cI almost wet my pants.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThey played one of Parker\u2019s tunes, \u201cNow\u2019s the Time.\u201d\n\n\u201cCharlie took that tenor and played the rim off of it,\u201d Ms. Bryant recalled decades later. \u201cMy knees were weak all while we were playing.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nShe is believed to be the only female horn player to have performed with Parker.\n\nIn 1957, Ms. Bryant met Gillespie, who became such a close friend that her children called him \u201cUncle Diz.\u201d The same year, Ms. Bryant made her only recording as a leader, \u201cGal With a Horn\u201d (1957), which featured both her sizzling trumpet solos and her husky singing voice.\n\nWhile working in Las Vegas in the 1950s and early 1960s, she did a vocal and trumpet impersonation of Armstrong.\n\n\u201cWell, one night I was up there doing my act, doing Louis, when I heard this sound coming from the casino,\u201d she told JazzTimes. \u201cAnd here comes Louis with his whole band, all of them. . . . They marched right up onstage and did my whole act, but for real. It was great.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nClora Larea Bryant was born May 30, 1927, in Denison, Tex. Her father worked at a hardware store, among other jobs, and she was 3 when her mother died. She said her father raised her and two brothers during the Depression on $7 a week.\n\nMs. Bryant began playing her older brother\u2019s trumpet because her family could not afford to buy another instrument. She received lessons in high school and, by 15, was performing at dances in Texas and Oklahoma.\n\nShe was part of an all-female band at what is now Prairie View A&M University in Texas, then moved to Los Angeles and studied at UCLA. She left school to join the International Sweethearts of Rhythm.\n\nLater, in another all-women band, the Queens of Rhythm, she also played drums \u2014 sometimes drumming with one hand and playing trumpet with the other. In the 1950s and 1960s, she worked in groups with singer Billy Williams and with her brother, singer Mel Bryant.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the 1980s, Ms. Bryant returned to UCLA to complete her degree and, when not performing, taught music and jazz history in high schools and colleges.\n\nHer marriage to musician Joe Stone ended in divorce. They had two children, and she had two sons from a later relationship with musician Leslie Milton. In addition to her four children, survivors include nine grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.\n\nIn 1988, inspired by a Moscow performance by Dave Brubeck, Ms. Bryant wrote a letter to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, addressed simply, \u201cKremlin, Moscow, U.S.S.R.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I was young, my father always said nothing ventured nothing gained,\u201d she wrote, \u201cso I am venturing.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nShe was hoping to become \u201cthe first lady horn player to be invited to your country to perform, and maybe a friendship will blossom, because it seems that now is the time to try to open our hands and our hearts to each other.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe Kremlin extended an invitation and, in 1989, Ms. Bryant embarked on a two-week tour of the Soviet Union, joined by two of her sons and a film crew.\n\n\u201cPeople embraced her with open arms,\u201d her son Darrin Milton, a singer, said in an interview. \u201cThey partied with us and treated us like royalty. Mom had a ball.\u201d\n\nShe had to quit playing the trumpet in 1996, after heart surgery, but continued to make occasional appearances as a singer and as a lecturer. In 2002, she received the Mary Lou Williams Women in Jazz Award at the Kennedy Center in Washington.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMusic has been the thing that has sustained me over the years,\u201d Ms. Bryant said in 2002. \u201cThat\u2019s what helped me to see a lot of things through \u2014 through people misusing me and abusing me \u2014 all of it. Despite all I\u2019ve been through, it\u2019s still worth it. I guess it\u2019s because music is in my skin.\u201d\n\nRead more Washington Post obituaries\n\nBarbara Probst Solomon, writer who chronicled Franco\u2019s rule in Spain, dies at 90\n\nLeslie H.
