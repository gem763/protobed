And there are no right or wrong investment strategies. Today, however, we are going to focus on one of the quickest and best gauges of how effectively management runs a company: Return on Equity.\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE helps investors understand if a firm\u2019s executives are creating assets with investors\u2019 cash or burning it. ROE shows a company\u2019s ability to turn assets into profits. Put another way, this vital metric measures the profits made for each dollar of shareholder equity.\n\nROE is calculated as net income / shareholder's equity. For example: if $0.10 of assets are created for each $1 of shareholder equity that would equal a ROE of 10%.\n\nOverall, Return on Equity is a great item to use regardless of what type of investor you are since it provides insight into management\u2019s ability to create value and keep costs under control. Plus, if ROE slips, it can alert us to potential problems. And this metric could become even more important amid the current market volatility and global economic environment, as investors look for companies with strong management teams that don\u2019t waste money.\n\nWith all that said, let\u2019s take a look at this screen\u2019s parameters and see the companies proving they can return value to shareholders instead of churning through their cash.\n\n\u2022 Zacks Rank equal to 1\n\nThe Zacks Rank looks at upward earnings estimate revisions, among other metrics, in order to find companies that are projected to see their earnings get stronger. In fact, beginning with a Zacks Rank #1 can be a great starting point because it boasts an average annual return of over 25% per year during the last 30 years.\n\n\u2022 Price greater than or equal to 5\n\nToday we ruled out any stocks that are trading for less than $5 a share because they can be more volatile and speculative.\n\n\u2022 Price/Sales Ratio less than or equal to 1\n\nOn top of that, we are looking for a low price to sales ratio. Today we went with 1 or below as this range is usually thought to provide better value since investors pay less for each unit of sales.\n\n\u2022 % (Broker) Rating Strong Buy equal to 100 (%)\n\nIn this screen, we decided to go with companies that brokers are fully on board with since ratings are typically skewed strongly toward \u2018buy\u2019 and \u2018strong buy.\u2019\n\n\u2022 ROE greater than or equal to 10\n\nLastly, but most importantly for today\u2019s screen, we got rid of any companies with Return on Equity of less than 10 because the median ROE value for all of the stocks in the Zacks Universe is under 10.\n\nThis strategy comes loaded with the Research Wizard and is called bt_sow_roe.und.
