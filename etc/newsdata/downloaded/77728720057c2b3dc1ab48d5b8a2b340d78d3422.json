Gasol scored 14 for the winners, who never trailed and added this crown to the one it claimed in 2006.\n\nFor Gasol, it was historic.\n\nThe Toronto Raptors centre becomes the second player to win an NBA title and a FIBA world gold medal in the same year, joining Lamar Odom \u2014 who did it for the Los Angeles Lakers and USA Basketball in 2010.\n\nGasol is also the 19th to win either an NBA or WNBA crown along with a gold medal, either of the Olympic or World Cup variety, in the same year. And he's the first to accomplish that feat while representing a nation other than the U.S.\n\nWhen Spain won its first title in 2006, it was Pau Gasol \u2014 Marc's older brother \u2014 leading the way. This time, it was the not-so-little brother who led his nation to gold, hoisting the World Cup trophy three months after getting his hands on the NBA's Larry O'Brien Trophy for the first time.\n\nGabriel Deck scored 24 points for Argentina (8-1), which got off to a slow start and played uphill the rest of the way. Luis Scola was held to eight points, shooting 1 for 10 from the floor.\n\nSpain led 43-31 at the half, riding the strength of two big runs.\n\nSpain ran out to a quick 14-2 lead, only to have Argentina answer with an 11-0 spurt. But when that ended, Spain came back with a 17-1 run and took what was then its biggest lead at 31-14.\n\nScola, even at 39 years old still Argentina's best player throughout the tournament, didn't get on the scoresheet until he made a pair of free throws with 2:57 left in the third. But they only cut the Spain lead to 19, and by then the Argentinian fans \u2014 who stood in the stands a few rows from their team's bench, singing and chanting for much of the game \u2014 were relatively quiet.\n\nThey probably had a good idea what was coming.\n\nThere was one last gasp from Argentina, an 11-4 run to open the fourth quarter and cut Spain's lead to 12 with 6:30 left. But Llull's three-point play on the next Spain possession pushed the lead back to 15.", "description": "Spain has captured its second World Cup championship, defeating Argentina 95-75 on Sunday to give Marc Gasol a rare double-title year.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5284381.1568557497!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/china-basketball-world-cup.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
