(AP) \u2014 For three quarters, Kyle Trask saw the overthrows and ineffective runs, the penalties and missed assignments. He knew something had to change.\n\nIt finally did.\n\nTrask threw three of his career-high four touchdowns in the final period Saturday to rally the No. 9 Gators to a 38-27 win at South Carolina.\n\nTrask, sensing the game slipping away, told his teammates: \u201cThis isn\u2019t us.\u201d He then helped the Gators (7-1, 4-1 Southeastern Conference) avoid a second straight loss after falling at No. 2 LSU 42-28 last week.\n\n\u201cWe found our identity and started making plays,\u201d he said.\n\nThis season, the identity of Florida\u2019s offense is very much in Trask\u2019s hands. The redshirt junior, starting because of an injury to Feleipe Franks, has led the Gators to their best start since 2015.\n\nAfter a week off, Trask will bring Florida to a final, defining stretch with games against No. 10 Georgia, Vanderbilt and SEC East-leading Missouri in the chase for a spot in the SEC title game.\n\nThings didn\u2019t look promising through the third quarter. South Carolina (3-4, 2-3) held Florida in check and took a 20-17 lead in trying for its second consecutive win over a top 10 opponent after beating then-No. 3 Georgia in double overtime last week.\n\n\u201cWe have a very resilient team,\u201d Trask said. \u201cWe\u2019re never going to panic, no matter the situation.\u201d\n\nThat was evident in the second half.\n\nAfter Trask\u2019s interception deep in Florida territory led to Tavien Feaster\u2019s 21-yard TD run to put the Gamecocks up 17-10, Dameon Pierce answered with a 75-yard scoring run on Florida\u2019s next snap to tie it.\n\nIn the final period, down 20-17, Trask faced fourth-and-3 on South Carolina\u2019s 34 before scrambling from pressure to pick up the first down with a 9-yard pass to Kyle Pitts. Trask followed with the go-ahead 25-yard touchdown throw to Lamical Perine.\n\nFlorida\u2019s defense also came through down the stretch after the Gators took the lead. Defensive end Zachary Carter sacked Ryan Hilinski, who fumbled as nose tackle Kyree Campbell recovered.\n\nFlorida linebacker David Reese said the players were intent on not letting the LSU loss affect them.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t let one loss turn into another,\u201d he said.\n\nTrask, who completed 21 of 33 passes for 200 yards, finished the series with a 5-yard TD pass to Pitts before a final scoring pass of 5 yards to Trevon Grimes.\n\nSouth Carolina looked poised once more shuffle the SEC East race with an upset. But like a year ago, when Florida rallied from 31-14 down to defeat the Gamecocks 35-31, South Carolina could not hold.\n\n\u201cGet the lead in fourth quarter, got to make some plays. We didn\u2019t do that,\u201d South Carolina coach Will Muschamp said.\n\nHilinski, who sprained his knee in the Georgia win, was not sharp for most of this game. The freshman completed 17 of 35 throws for 170 yards.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to find a way to throw the ball better,\u201d he said.\n\nFeaster, the Clemson graduate transfer, ran for 175 yards for South Carolina, which was outscored 21-7 in the final period.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nFlorida: The Gators now have time to recover from injuries and recoup from a two-month stretch of football. Florida gets next week off before starting a run of three straight SEC East games.\n\nSouth Carolina: The defense gave the team a chance at another stunner. But inconsistency on offense sent South Carolina to its fourth loss to Florida in five years.\n\nINJURED GATORS\n\nFlorida was missing two key defenders, both out with ankle injuries \u2014 end Jabari Zuniga and linebacker Jonathan Greenard. Greenard entered the game leading the Gators with four sacks. Zuniga has three. Gators coach Dan Mullen was optimistic the two would be able to practice entering the Georgia game in two weeks.\n\nANGRY MUSCHAMP\n\nSouth Carolina\u2019s Will Muschamp had grown so frustrated with officiating, he drew an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty. He was angrier still the flag was thrown far from where he stood, saying it was a \u201cgutless\u201d move.\n\n\u201cThe guy ran 40 yards away and dropped a flag. I have no idea. I\u2019d rather him drop it on my feet,\u201d the coach said.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nFlorida is off next week before facing No. 10 Georgia in its annual rivalry game in Jacksonville, Florida, on Nov. 2.\n\nSouth Carolina heads to Tennessee on Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: http://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25", "description": "COLUMBIA, S.C.
