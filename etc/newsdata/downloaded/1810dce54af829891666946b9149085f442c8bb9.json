He was eventually released but returned to the U.S. in a vegetative state and later died.\n\nDoctors in Cincinnati said Warmbier had suffered severe brain damage, although they weren't sure what led to it. North Korea denied mistreating him, saying he fell into a coma that resulted from botulism and a sleeping pill.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell was expected to join the dinner on Saturday evening.\n\nTrump said in 2017 that Warmbier was \u201ctortured beyond belief\u201d by the North Koreans, but drew criticism earlier this year for saying he took dictator Kim Jong Un \u201cat his word\u201d when he said he wasn\u2019t involved in Warmbier\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cI believe something very bad happened to him,\u201d Trump said in February. \u201cI don\u2019t think leadership knew about it.\u201d\n\nFred and Cindy Warmbier released a brief statement restating that the regime was indeed responsible for their son\u2019s death:\n\n\u201cWe have been respectful during this summit process. Now we must speak out. Kim and his evil regime are responsible for the death of our son Otto. Kim and his evil regime are responsible for unimaginable cruelty and inhumanity.

Otto and his family have become a tremendous symbol of strong passion and strength, which will last for many years into the future. I love Otto and think of him often!\u201d he tweeted.\n\nFox News\u2019 Eric Shawn and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "President Trump on Saturday will have dinner with the parents of Otto Warmbier - the American college student who died in 2017 after being held captive in North Korea for more than a year.", "authors": ["Adam Shaw"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/04/27/694940094001_6030623429001_6030628973001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
