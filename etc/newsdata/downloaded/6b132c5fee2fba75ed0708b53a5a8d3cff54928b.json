They also recently met with a non-governmental group that offered the tribe drones and GPS devices to track the encroachers in exchange for harvesting wood sustainably. And like their ancestors, they plant trees to teach their children the value of preserving the world\u2019s largest rainforest, which is a critical bulwark against global warming.\n\n\u201cI tell my children: I planted for you, now you have to plant for your children,\u201d Cidalia Tembe said in her backyard at the Tekohaw village, where she grows fruits, vegetables and medicinal herbs.\n\n\u201cThese are our home remedies,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t go to pharmacies in the city, we make our own medicines. We have more faith in what\u2019s ours.\u201d\n\nShe also proudly pointed to four sugarcane plants - each tended by one of her children - and avocados, coconuts, lemons and acai, the Amazonian berry that\u2019s a vitamin-packed breakfast staple in Brazil.\n\n\u201cThis is paradise,\u201d her husband Muti Tembe said. \u201cYou don\u2019t see any smoke from cars that pollute because we don\u2019t have any. In the city, at midday it gets too hot. \u2026 Here, you\u2019re at ease and you don\u2019t hear the noises. Only the calls of birds,\u201d he said as birds chirped on trees.\n\nOne of the trees was planted by Muti\u2019s grandfather, a Tembe chieftain and Tekohaw founder. For generations, members of the tribe have extracted a black dye from that Jenipapo tree in the couple\u2019s yard to paint their body during celebrations.\n\nDuring the rite of passage that can last for days, tribe members also hunt monkeys and birds that they later cook, while the young who come into adulthood jump, sing and mimic bird sounds with other members of the tribe inside a communal hut to banging of feet on the floor and the shaking of rattles.\n\nAbout 2,000 Tembe live in their 1,080-square-mile (2,766-square-kilometer) Alto Rio Guama homeland, which can only be reached after long journeys on boats or on dirt roads. Villages along the Guama and Gurupi rivers that divide the reserve can range in size from a few dozen people to hundreds. The indigenous reserve is officially protected, but it\u2019s constantly under siege by loggers who illegally try to extract prized hardwood.\n\nThe Amazon, 60% of which is in Brazil, is also home to 20% of the earth\u2019s plant species, many of which are found nowhere else.\n\nSatellite data from the Brazilian Space Agency has shown a sharp increase in deforestation and forest fires in the past year. In August, the agency issued an alert that fires in the Amazon had increased 84% in the first seven months of this year, compared with the same period in 2018.\n\nConcern about the Amazon\u2019s rainforest, has heightened since far-right President Jair Bolsonaro took office this year with calls to loosen protections for nature reserves and indigenous lands.\n\n\u201cWe have to fight for the trees that allow us to breathe,\u201d said Gleison Tembe of the small village of Ka\u2019 a kyr, which in their native tongue means Green Jungle.\n\n\u201cThe Amazon, nature, is my mother, because it raised me. The animals that it takes care of give us strength. My children only eat natural food and it all comes here from the forest, he said. \u201cSo, why deforest?\u201d\n\nIn a corner, he dried fish in the blazing sun on a grill held by bricks. Inside his home, some of his children and nephews gathered around a cellphone on a purple hammock to watch a children\u2019s cartoon on YouTube. Later, during a short forest trek, his 7-year-old daughter Emilia climbed on a fallen tree that had burned and pointed a bow and arrow that she made with branches.\n\n\u201cThis part used to be a native forest. This was primary jungle. But the fire arrived and it cleared the land,\u201d said Emidio Tembe, Emilia\u2019s grandfather and the Ka\u2019 a kyr chieftain who named the village.\n\n\u201cOur concern here is the food, the cutting of wood, the fires,\u201d said Emidio, who recently traveled to the state capital of Belem to sell his wooden handcrafts at a book fair.\n\n\u201cThey worry us because we feed ourselves with fish, birds, what we hunt from the forest. So, for us, it\u2019s extremely important to remain in the forest, listening to the sounds of birds, the calls of the animals.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "They hunt with bows and arrows, fish for piranhas and gather wild plants, while some watch soap operas on TV or check the internet on phones inside thatch-roof huts.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Luis Andres Henao"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/01/brazil_amazon_tembe_daily_life_27299_c0-87-2083-1301_s1770x1032.jpg?3acbd130b544b91ce041fb7a62ff8c7ea3ec20e6", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
