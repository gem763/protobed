Comcast previously charged subscribers $5 a month for Xfinity Flex.\n\n\"Everyone has realized the living room is too important and the big boys ... with massive leverage are likely to make ROKU growth much more difficult,\" Wlodarczak added.\n\nRoku's stock slid 5.8% in premarket trading from its previous close of $133.76. Pivotal has a $60 price target on the stock.\n\nAfter running up over 330% this year, Roku shares have cooled in September. The stock is down 14.9% for the week, on pace for its worst week since December.\n\nWlodarczak noted that Roku \"deserves a lot of credit\" for building its business and getting its devices into about 31 million households, with the majority in the U.S. The analyst added that Roku did that in spite of facing competition directly from Amazon, Apple, Google-parent Alphabet and even Facebook. The latter technology giant announced on Wednesday that it would begin offering a new device, Portal TV, that can TV shows.\n\n\"The problem going forward, however, is that while the large Internet players have realized the importance of control of the mostly video pipe into the living room, now the players that actually control the dominant data pipe into the household in the U.S. (Comcast, Charter, Altice) have as well,\" Wlodarczak said.\n\n\u2013 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.\n\nDisclosure: Comcast is the owner of NBCUniversal, parent company of CNBC and CNBC.com.", "description": "Pivotal Research Group began coverage of Roku with a sell rating on Friday", "authors": ["Michael Sheetz"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105839207-1554740286113gettyimages-181766434.jpeg?v=1554740304", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
