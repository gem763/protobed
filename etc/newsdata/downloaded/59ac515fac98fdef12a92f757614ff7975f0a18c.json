But shampooing constantly isn\u2019t the answer either. Like oily skin, oily hair is a result of hyperactive sebaceous glands, which, aside from genetics and hormones, can be caused by the overuse of astringent shampoos and other styling products. \u201cThough everyone\u2019s initial reaction is to wash their hair at the sight of oil, truth is it\u2019s best to wait,\u201d says Eric Torneros, a stylist at the Karcher salon in Greenpoint. \u201cThe longer you can wait, the more your scalp will get used to not having to overproduce. Washing too much makes the scalp freak out and go into protection mode, producing more oil.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is one of those myths we\u2019ve been conditioned to believe: to have squeaky clean hair,\u201d says Chelsey Pickthorn, owner of Pickthorn Salon in Bushwick, Brooklyn. \u201cInstead, we should allow our natural oils to find their balance, and then they will really stop overproducing over time.\u201d While it may seem counterintuitive (and impossible), one way to fight oily hair is by cutting back on how often you shampoo your hair. According to the experts we consulted, limiting washing your hair to one to three times a week is ideal if you\u2019re trying to control oil production.\n\nTo help you choose the right product, we consulted five hairstylists about their favorite shampoos and washes for bringing your hair back to a less-greasy, more balanced state. While our experts recommended a range of products, they all agreed that the most effective shampoos are ones that can remove excess oil build-up without stripping hair of its natural oils. Pickthorn notes, however, that the process could take \u201canywhere from four to six weeks\u201d and that the oil in your hair will get worse before it gets better. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna go through a pretty crappy stage where it is just gonna try to get all the excess out, and then it will definitely reset itself.\u201d\n\nBest shampoos for oily hair\n\nDavines Naturaltech Rebalancing Shampoo According to Pickthorn, factors like stress, lifestyle, and how often you color or otherwise process your hair can also affect how greasy it is. For those with more chronic issues, she recommends incorporating a rebalancing shampoo, like this one from Davines\u2019s Naturaltech line, into your hair-care regimen. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t necessarily be something that you\u2019re using every shampoo, but more as a treatment-based kind of situation,\u201d she says. It contains lemon phytoceuticals, which she says is \u201cbasically vitamin C,\u201d and that helps to rebalance the pH levels of your scalp by deep-cleaning excess oil without stripping your hair\u2019s natural moisturizer. Matt King, hairstylist and director of education at Fox and Jane salon in Manhattan agrees, saying that Davines\u2019s rebalancing shampoo \u201cis a great option for people who are looking to handle an oily scalp without drying out their hair.\u201d He also appreciates the fact that Davines uses natural ingredients as often as possible and sustainable packaging. $32 at Amazon Buy $32 at Amazon Buy\n\nAccording to Stephanie Louis, owner of Stylebox Salon in Brooklyn, it\u2019s \u201cnot so much how often you shampoo your hair, but with what.\u201d For those with super oily hair, she recommends sticking with a once-a-week shampoo regimen using her go-to combination of Euforia\u2019s Urgent Repair Shampoo, and Verb\u2019s Reset Clarifying Shampoo. They\u2019re \u201cnot too harsh, which can strip away the sebum from the scalp, causing the sebaceous glands to kick into overdrive and make more sebum, or too weak, so that they don\u2019t really do much to clear any oil build-up.\u201d She notes that they\u2019re both primarily water-based cleansers, meaning they won\u2019t add extra oil to your hair. Kyriakos also likes Verb and says that it works well on curly hair. \u201cIt adds a lot of shine and really helps control an oily scalp.\u201d\n\nInoar Divine Curls Shampoo The weight of your hair can also play a role in how greasy it can appear, according to hairstylist George Kyriakos at Honey Artists. \u201cVery fine hair can be washed in the morning and look greasy and limp by mid-day,\u201d he says. \u201cOily hair is a bit easier to conceal with thicker, coarser hair. You can get away with washing your hair every day, but could dry the scalp, causing excess dandruff.\u201d In either case, \u201cthe more often you wash your hair, the more oil the scalp produces in order to compensate for the dryness from over-washing.\u201d For fine hair, Kyriakos recommends \u201calternating between a regular foaming shampoo and a dry shampoo every couple of washes,\u201d and for coarser hair, \u201cwashing every three to four days, rinsing with water, and perhaps rotating in a dry shampoo in between washes.\u201d His go-to shampoo is Inoar\u2019s Divine Curls Shampoo, which he says \u201cdoesn\u2019t have the harsh detergents that most shampoos contain.\u201d Although it\u2019s meant for curly hair, he notes that it works on all hair textures. \u201cIt also doesn\u2019t lather, which may take some getting used to, but your hair will feel clean and your scalp will thank you.\u201d $12 at Inoar Buy\n\nAct+Acre Cold Processed Hair Cleanse \u201cThis is a cold-processed shampoo and conditioner that is just really nice and balanced,\u201d says Pickthorn. \u201cWe get into these patterns and cycles of thinking, \u2018Oh, my hair is oily, it\u2019s flat, it\u2019s this,\u2019 and so then we go for a volume shampoo, or something for texture, but a lot of the time, volume shampoos can be very alcoholic or acidic, which basically roughs up the cuticle. You\u2019re just compounding the problem.\u201d Rich in antioxidants, it contains natural ingredients like ylang ylang, vetiver, rosemary, lavender, and amaranth oil that help protect your hair from damage. \u201cI like what they\u2019re doing with the product. It\u2019s not too one-way or another,\u201d she adds. $28 at Amazon Buy $28 at Amazon Buy\n\nEvo Normal Persons Daily Shampoo King says that when there\u2019s a buildup of product in your scalp, its natural oils can\u2019t spread through your hair. But washing it too often causes irritation to the scalp, which secretes more oil to protect itself. In addition to washing oily hair a couple of times a week, he suggests using a clarifying shampoo like this sulfate- and paraben-free one from Evo once a week to get excess product off the scalp. Even though it\u2019s deep-cleaning, \u201cit doesn\u2019t feel like your hair is stripped after.\u201d It also won\u2019t affect your hair color if it\u2019s processed, and it doesn\u2019t require an intensive conditioner. King suggests following up with a dry shampoo, and also recommends Evo\u2019s Therapist shampoo for when your hair needs moisturizer, or Mane Tamer if your hair is frizzy. $22 at Amazon Buy $29 at Evo Buy\n\nIles Formula Haute Performance Shampoo Pickthorn also recommends this sulfate- and paraben-free product from Iles Formula. \u201cIt has a root vegetable extract that basically buffs the actual cuticle of the hair,\u201d she says, \u201cbalancing the scalp and stripping out any impurities and gunk.\u201d $35 at Amazon Buy $35 at Amazon Buy\n\nK\u00e9rastase Specifique Bain Divalent Shampoo This silicone-free shampoo from K\u00e9rastase is specifically formulated for oily hair and roots. Kyriakos recommends it, saying, \u201cThis is a hypoallergenic shampoo that calms the scalp, reduces dryness, and promotes over all good scalp health.\u201d $24 at Amazon Buy $33 at Sephora Buy\n\nAveda Scalp Benefits Balancing Shampoo Here\u2019s another recommendation from Kyriakos: \u201cThis Aveda Scalp Benefits works well on balancing your scalp\u2019s pH, which can help reduce the overall production of oil.\u201d It works by cleaning the hair down to the roots, removing excess sebum and other build-up. $32 at Amazon Buy $24 at Aveda Buy\n\nBest washes for oily hair\n\nTorneros recommends incorporating a wash or rinse into your weekly regimen. \u201cRinses cleanse the scalp without using detergent a.k.a. soap. They get the hair feeling clean but not fully stripped of all your natural oils,\u201d he explains. His favorite washes for rebalancing oil production are both apple cider vinegar\u2013based cleansers that, according to him, \u201chelp remove excess oil and product without over-stripping the hair of its natural oil, leaving hair clean and shiny but not overly dry.\u201d (Vulture\u2019s literary critic Molly Young is also a fan of Hairstory\u2019s shampoo replacement.) \u201cThough totally ditching shampoo isn\u2019t for everyone, I think using this a few times in between shampoos is a great additive for excessively oil hair,\u201d says Torneros. He suggests shampooing once a week and using a rinse two or three times throughout the week. \u201cBut if eventually you can fully let go of actual shampoo, even better. Eventually your scalp with acclimate and be less oily.\u201d Writer Garret Munce is also a fan of dpHue\u2019s rinse, saying that it\u2019s his \u201c\ufeffgo-to product when I feel a little too oily and need a little reset.\u201d\n\nBest dry shampoos for oily hair\n\nR+Co Death Valley Dry Shampoo Three of our experts \u2014 Kyriakos, Pickthorn, and King \u2014 recommend using a dry shampoo in between washes as a way to control oil production. They all like R+Co\u2019s Death Valley dry shampoo, which Pickthorn says \u201cabsorbs the oil on the scalp and hair. It smells refreshing and sprays vigorously.\u201d Kyriakos agrees, saying that it \u201csmells great and gives you a lot of texture and volume.\u201d Still, they all have slightly different ways of incorporating a dry shampoo into a weekly regimen. Kyriakos, for instance, suggests switching between a regular shampoo and dry shampoo during the week. \u201cOn the days you use dry shampoo, simply rinse your hair with water. Once your hair is dry, use the dry shampoo to remove excess oils,\u201d he says. King suggests using Death Valley the day you wash your hair, as its great for immediately counteracting any oil that could show up. $18 at Amazon Buy $18 at Amazon Buy\n\nKlorane Dry Shampoo with Oat Milk For Pickthorn, it\u2019s a little more complicated. \u201cI go back and forth [about whether to use dry shampoo], because some products tend to use a ton of alcohols, and it\u2019s just masking the problem, but I really love Klorane. It\u2019s just super light and doesn\u2019t have a lot of product to it. It\u2019s not too powdery, so you\u2019re not suffocating your scalp,\u201d she says. She suggests using it the second day of the week: \u201cShampoo the first day, go through the whole night, and then apply the next morning. Ideally, you don\u2019t want to keep reapplying in hopes that it\u2019ll hold through.\u201d She also recommends using your fingertips to disperse it around your scalp. Pickthorn also likes Davines\u2019s Hair Refresher. $20 at Amazon Buy $20 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest brush for oily hair\n\nMason Pearson Popular Mixture Nylon & Boar Bristle Brush \u201cOily hair means oily scalp,\u201d says King. \u201c\u2019Brush your hair every night\u2019 is my No. 1 tip.\u201d He recommends using Mason Pearson\u2019s boar bristle nylon combo brush from your scalp to the ends of your hair \u201cto drag the oil through hair and condition it so that the oil is not sitting at the scalp.\u201d Kyriakos also recommends using a Mason Pearson brush, but to brush dry shampoo through your hair once it is applied. $240 at Nordstrom Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
