When we put a doorstop on one of the legs of an ordinary chair we create something unexpected \u2013 an interruption,\u201d says Abloh.\n\nBut, with space a premium for many young buyers and renters, each piece has been designed to be 100 per cent functional as well as fashionable.\n\nThe stand out piece from the collection is the quirky monochrome rug, priced at \u00a375, designed to look like an IKEA receipt.\n\nThere's a wooden day bed, priced at \u00a3175, and a cheeky light-up framed Mona Lisa print for \u00a365.\n\nA white clock has no numbers on the face but is emblazoned with the word \"Temporary\", while bedlinen in neutral colours features orange labels with gallery-style text on them and an orange toolbox is labelled \"Homework\".\n\nThe most expensive item is a wooden dining table priced at \u00a3250.\n\nBut there's a catch. You won't be able to walk into any IKEA store to purchase the collection.\n\nEager customers can sign up for a limited number of tickets via Eventbrite. Tickets will be released at 10am October 18 to visit IKEA Dublin, Wembley and Croydon.\n\nIf they're lucky enough to win tickets, customers have to be available November 1, 2 or 3 to shop until they drop \u2014 or pick up their five pieces they're allowed to purchase.\n\nAccess to the stores will be granted on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\nScroll through the gallery above to browse the full collection.", "description": "Swedish furniture giant\u00a0IKEA has joined forces with Louis Vuitton\u2019s menswear artistic director, and founder of OFF-WHITE, Virgil Abloh to create a stylish new range MARKERAD, designed with young people furnishing\u00a0their first home in mind.", "authors": ["Sophie Warner"], "top_image": "https://static.homesandproperty.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/09/10/ikea1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
