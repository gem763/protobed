Kyrsten Sinema speaks during an event hosted by the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry on May 17, 2019, at the Arizona Biltmore in Phoenix.\n\nA group of Arizona Democrats are demonstrating why President Donald Trump will more than likely be a two-term president.\n\nThe party\u2019s liberal wing simply cannot resist the temptation to shoot itself in its Birkenstocks.\n\nWitness the liberals riding in on their unicorn, hoping to censure the first Arizona Democrat elected to the U.S. Senate in 30 years.\n\nIt seems Sen. Kyrsten Sinema is just not Democratic enough. So the party's progressive caucus is asked the Arizona Democratic Party to censure her on Saturday. The party has decided to push the vote to it's annual meeting in January.\n\n\u201cWe really support Kyrsten Sinema, we want her to succeed, we want her to be the best senator in the country,\u201d Dan O\u2019Neal, state coordinator for Progressive Democrats of America, told The Republic\u2019s Yvonne Wingett Sanchez. \u201cBut the way she is voting is really disappointing. We want Democrats to vote like Democrats and not Republicans.\u201d\n\nSinema won because she's a centrist\n\nThe problem is, that\u2019s not what the people who decided last year\u2019s Senate race \u2014 the ones who quite likely will decide next year\u2019s presidential race \u2014 want.\n\nSinema won last year because she ran as a centrist, one who could appeal to moderates who are sick to death of the long-running, never-ending trench war between the Republican and Democratic parties.\n\nWhy government needs to pop our bubbles: My social media feeds look different from yours and it's driving political polarization\n\nShe won GOP-rich Maricopa County, as moderates saw in Sinema someone who would abandon the fox holes and go in search of that rare earth called middle ground.\n\nBut the progressives complain she\u2019s too quick to throw in with Republicans. They cite her vote to confirm William Barr to be U.S. attorney, among other things.\n\nIndeed, Sinema was one of three Democrats to vote for Barr\u2019s confirmation.\n\nBut she also has voted against Trump\u2019s positions 81% percent of the time this year, according to the FiveThirtyEight Trump Tracker.\n\nIn June, she voted yes on a bill to provide $4.5 billion in emergency humanitarian aid to migrants on the U.S-Mexico border. In March, she voted to block Trump from declaring a national emergency in order to divert funds on the border wall.\n\nThis is no way for Democrats to win\n\nDuring last year\u2019s campaign, Sinema made no secret of her desire to be seen as independent. She\u2019s more pragmatist than party loyalist.\n\nThat was the secret sauce that allowed her to defeat Martha McSally, who hopped into Donald Trump's hip pocket on the day she announced for the Senate.\n\nDon't play into his hands: Trump wants you to think he's racist so you won't notice he's corrupt and killing jobs\n\nRather than taking a lesson from Sinema\u2019s success, the Democratic Party nationally seems determined to do a reverse-McSally, embracing candidates who have pushed even its centrist candidates to the left.\n\nRemoving criminal penalties for illegal immigration, Medicare for all, the Green New Deal, free college, free child care, mandatory gun buybacks, slave reparations and impeachment impeachment impeachment.\n\nDemocrats seem determined to hurtle left, right over the cliff.\n\nJust don\u2019t expect Kyrsten Sinema to follow them.\n\nLaurie Roberts is a columnist for the Arizona Republic, where this column originally appeared.
