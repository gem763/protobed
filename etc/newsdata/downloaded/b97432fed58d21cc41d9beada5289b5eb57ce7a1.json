Biden \u201cin a heartbeat\u201d if it came down to the former vice president and President Trump in the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cCould I vote for a Democrat? Hell yes,\u201d Mr. Weld, the former governor of Massachusetts, said during an interview at CNN\u2019s CITIZEN conference, The Associated Press reported. \u201cIf it\u2019s Trump against Joe Biden, I\u2019m with Biden in a heartbeat.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a lunch-pail Democrat,\u201d he said of Mr. Biden. \u201cHe\u2019s a good guy. He\u2019s a centrist, and Trump is not going to be able to play the socialism card against him.\u201d\n\nMr. Weld declared that he would never vote for Mr. Trump \u201cunder any circumstances\u201d and would even consider supporting far-left candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren it came down to it.\n\n\u201cI suppose I\u2019d rather have her, with a couple of modifications in her platform,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Weld was joined onstage by former South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford and former Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh, who are also seeking the Republican presidential nomination against Mr. Trump. They, too, agreed that Ms. Warren is a good candidate.\n\n\u201cI think she\u2019s articulate and bright and quick,\u201d Mr. Sanford said, AP reported.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s got the energy and the fire,\u201d Mr. Walsh said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
