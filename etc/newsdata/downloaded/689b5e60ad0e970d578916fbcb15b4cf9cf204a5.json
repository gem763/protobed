It is time for a carbon abolition movement | Eric Beinhocker", "language": "en", "text": "Human-induced climate change is a moral wrong. It involves one group of humans harming others. People of this generation harming those in future generations. People in the developed world harming those in the developing world. Each of us is emitting carbon that is harming those caught in climate-driven superstorms, floods, droughts and conflicts. And there\u2019s the greatest moral wrong of all \u2013 the mass extinction event we have triggered that harms all life on Earth.\n\nYet until recently, climate change has not been argued as a moral issue. Rather, it has been presented as a technocratic problem, a cost-benefit problem, where the costs of action must be weighed against the benefits of avoiding disaster. The debates have been around taxes, jobs, growth and technologies. While such debates are important \u2013 there are better and worse ways to tackle the climate crisis \u2013 the effect has been decades of inaction, denial and delay. When something is a moral wrong, particularly a deep, systemic moral wrong, we don\u2019t wait around debating the optimal path or policy; we stop it.\n\nClear deadlines would give businesses and investors certainty that the fossil economy is coming to an end, and catalyse a historic boom in innovation\n\nLooking back in history, the climate movement can draw inspiration from another effort to right a deep moral wrong: the slavery abolition movement. There are clearly important differences between slavery and climate change, and I\u2019m not drawing a moral equivalence between the two; slavery was a unique moral horror and climate change is immoral in its own terrible way. But the climate community can find inspiration in the 19th-century abolitionist movement\u2019s courageous efforts to make slavery illegal around the world.\n\nThose who fought against slavery did not agonise over the costs and benefits. Their goal was morally righteous and powerfully clear: abolish slavery, make it illegal. It is time to do this for climate change: to make human carbon pollution illegal in every country in the world. It is time for a \u201ccarbon abolition\u201d movement, to put an end to emissions.\n\nThis is exactly what the science tells us we must do. In order to contain warming to 1.5-2C we need to bring global human carbon emissions to net-zero between 2030 and 2050. Not just reduce it. Stop it. This principle is enshrined in the Paris agreement, although few signatories have grappled with its implications.\n\nA set of firm deadlines, enshrined in international law, would force countries to immediately begin enacting the policies required to meet them, and force companies to start changing their business models. Some will protest that these laws would kill jobs and growth. But such clear deadlines would finally give businesses and investors certainty that the fossil-fuel economy is coming to an end, and catalyse a historic boom in innovation \u2013 bringing to life a new clean-energy economy.\n\nWe are not yet doomed: the carbon cutters determined to save the world Read more\n\nGetting every country in the world to enact carbon abolition laws seems a distant dream today. But things must have looked similarly bleak to slavery abolitionists in the early 19th century. But then, after years of campaigning and civil action, Britain made slavery illegal in 1833, France in 1848, the US in 1865, followed by numerous other countries and international bans in 1890 and 1926.\n\nWhat set the cascade of change going was the development of abolition as a mass social movement. History tells us that mass social movements such as women\u2019s suffrage, civil rights and gay rights have always used moral arguments to change politics. I can think of no mass movement that was sparked by a cost-benefit analysis.\n\nThe climate movement is finally finding its moral voice. The school strikes, the global climate strike, Extinction Rebellion and growing support for a Green New Deal suggest that, at last, a mass social movement is rising that could tip our politics into action.\n\nBut to catch fire this campaign needs a clear, simple demand, a rallying cry that everyone can share. \u201cStop climate change\u201d is too vague and abstract, while the cacophony of narrower demands \u2013 \u201cStop fracking\u201d, \u201cBuild more solar\u201d, \u201cEat less meat\u201d \u2013 is too confusing. These are all crucial issues, but many people are unsure of what to make of it all. Instead, by clearly showing the immorality of carbon pollution, we can activate people\u2019s moral emotions and then focus those emotions on a specific action: making it illegal.\n\nThe climate crisis isn\u2019t just causing extreme weather. It\u2019s fuelling extreme politics, too | Nick Lowles Read more\n\nWe have a starting point: Britain recently joined the Nordic countries, France, New Zealand, the US state of California and 19 cities around the world in adopting net-zero targets, and the EU is considering a 2050 target. The next step is to shift these soft targets into hard carbon abolition laws.\n\nThe 19th-century abolitionists were brave enough to demand that a system built on the immoral enslavement of fellow human beings be stopped. Today, are we brave enough to demand that a system built on the immoral destruction of life on Earth be stopped?\n\n\u2022 Eric Beinhocker is professor of public policy practice at the Blavatnik School of Government, University of Oxford, and executive director of the Institute for New Economic Thinking at the Oxford Martin School.
