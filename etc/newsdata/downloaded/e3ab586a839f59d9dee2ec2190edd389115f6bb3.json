It\u2019s not hard to see why Fox executives may have wanted to bring him aboard. Solomon\u2019s work has underpinned the entire cascade of lies the White House and Trump in particular have pushed over the past few weeks.\n\nSolomon\u2019s writings\u2014including those most recently at The Hill, where he worked until last month\u2014are drenched in innuendo and mischaracterizations, all in service of attacking Trump\u2019s political opponents. Solomon is already a regular Fox News fixture. He appeared on Fox News\u2019s The Story show last week to claim that he was being victimized by \u201cMcCarthy-like\u201d attacks. As Mother Jones noted on Solomon\u2019s hiring\u2014which coincided with Giuliani claiming that the man deserves a Pulitzer\u2014Solomon\u2019s \u201calliance with pro-Trump forces\u201d is now \u201cofficial.\u201d\n\nLeaked Memo: Colleagues Unload on John Solomon, the Journo Who Kicked Off Trump\u2019s Ukraine Conspiracy\n\nFor many, Solomon remains far from a household name: a relatively obscure journalist who worked until recently at a relatively obscure outlet pushing relatively obscure stories about relatively obscure countries. But for those who\u2019ve followed his work (which includes a long-ago stint at Newsweek and The Daily Beast), his role in the entire unfolding national nightmare\u2014and the fact that he provided a willing platform to lies and half-truths coming out of Ukraine\u2014wasn\u2019t a surprise.\n\nThis is a man, after all, about whom the Columbia Journalism Review wrote not one, not two, but three separate takedowns. (One headline: \u201cJohn Solomon Gives Us Less Than Meets the Eye \u2014 Again\u201d). The most recent topped out at nearly 5,000 words, highlighting Solomon\u2019s \u201chistory of bending the truth to his storyline,\u201d as well as his \u201chyping [of] petty stories\u201d and his outsized habit of \u201cmassaging facts to conjure phantom scandals.\u201d\n\nComplaints from colleagues tailed Solomon wherever he went; as one former co-worker said about Solomon\u2019s work, \u201cFacts be damned.\u201d Small wonder that, as The Daily Beast reported last week, staffers at The Hill were \u201cenraged\u201d by his presence at the publication.\n\nPhoto Illustration by The Daily Beast/Getty More\n\nBut there was one kind of friend on whom Solomon could always count, and who could always count on Solomon\u2019s support in return: post-Soviet officials, oligarchs, and lobbyists looking to launder their image and spin their narrative.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this most clearly over the past few months, as Solomon\u2019s coverage of Ukraine has gained a national audience\u2014and completely fallen apart under the most basic scrutiny. To take one example, Solomon\u2019s writing lent credence to the notion that the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, had given a Ukrainian prosecutor a \u201cdo-not-prosecute\u201d list. One problem: there\u2019s no evidence the list ever existed, and the prosecutor himself eventually walked back the claim entirely.\n\nBut the damage was already done: The White House this year canned the ambassador, who\u2019s since been personally targeted by Trump as some kind of henchman in former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s machinations. (For good measure, Solomon this weekend described Ukraine\u2019s successful 2014 revolution to oust corrupt strongman Viktor Yanukovych as a \u201ccoup.\u201d)", "description": "Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/GettyOver the weekend, Fox News announced that it had made a new hire: John Solomon, the self-proclaimed journalist at the heart of the unfolding scandal involving Ukraine, Rudy Giuliani, and the impending impeachment of Donald Trump.
