AFP via Getty Images 2/16 1. James Slipper (Australia) Ninety-three Tests had come and gone for the Wallabies loosehead, but it was 94th-time lucky for the Queensland-born prop as he finally scored his first international try in Australia\u2019s 45-10 victory over Uruguay. Getty Images 3/16 2. Mbongeni Mbonambi (South Africa) Mbonambi was excellent at the lineout, finding his jumper on every occasion, but it was his work around the pitch that really stood out in the win over Italy as he bagged himself a try in the process. PA 4/16 3. Angus Ta\u2019avao (New Zealand) The rookie All Blacks prop was thrust into the contest against Namibia early when his team were struggling to break down the African side following Nepo Laulala\u2019s yellow card, but not only did he settle straight into the match, he immediately bagged himself a try that convinced Steve Hansen to leave him on for the rest of the match. Getty Images 5/16 4. Wimpie van der Walt (Japan) The uniquely-named lock led Japan\u2019s defensive charge against Samoa and was dominant in the aerial battle with a 100 per cent lineout effort alongside James Moore, which was made all the more impressive as he didn\u2019t start either of their opening matches. AFP via Getty Images 6/16 5. Sam Whitelock (New Zealand) Captained New Zealand in the absence of Kieran Read and led by example. Whitelock bagged a try himself, didn\u2019t panic when New Zealand were clawed back in the first half and contributed well with the ball in hand. His aggression in kicking for the corner early on paid off with a 71-point return. EPA 7/16 6. Rhys Ruddock (Ireland) Ireland may have been criticised for a drab performance in their victory over Russia, but Ruddock proved the silver lining with a man-of-the-match display that could thrust him into the side for the big contests. AFP via Getty Images 8/16 7. Sam Underhill (England) Another flanker named man of the match, Underhill was England\u2019s defensive heartbeat against Argentina, but also an emphatic carrier who helped set up George Ford\u2019s bonus point-clinching try. PA 9/16 8. Kazuki Himeno (Japan) The Japanese No 8 was one of their top performers against Samoa, carrying well and showing a deft touch with his ability to offload from the tackle. Earmarked as a real star of Japanese rugby, he looks to have real captaincy potential. AFP via Getty Images 10/16 9. Frank Lomani (Fiji) A livewire showing as the beating heart of a Flying Fijian side back at full strength and firing on all cylinders. Scored a try himself and delivered the quick ball that the Pacific Islanders crave to play their unique brand of rugby. AP 11/16 10. Jordie Barrett (New Zealand) Stepped out of the shadow of older brother Beauden to play a starring role in the demolition of Namibia. Scored a try himself but it was the in which he created Anton Lienert-Brown\u2019s score that really stood out, combining power, vision, passing ability and athletic determination to send the centre over. Getty Images 12/16 11. Semi Radradra (Fiji) The star of the side this week. When Radradra is playing his best rugby he is simply unstoppable, and so he proved last week. The Bordeaux back scored twice against Georgia and led pretty much every attacking stats list as the European side failed to shackle is delightful talent. AP 13/16 12. Anton Lienert-Brown (New Zealand) His form is keeping Sonny Bill Williams out of the Test side when New Zealand play their crunch fixtures, but on the weekend\u2019s evidence it was easy to see why. Two tries, the first an eye-catching mazy run from halfway, secures him the No 12 shirt this week, and probably for the All Blacks in the quarter-finals. Getty Images 14/16 13. Timothy Lafaele (Japan) Kicked off the performance against Samoa with their first try, starring with teammate Kotaro Matsushima to tear the Pacific Islanders apart early on and pave the way to their bonus-point victory. AFP via Getty Images 15/16 14. Cheslin Kolbe (South Africa) How do you stop him? The answer is yet to be found, with Kolbe\u2019s low centre of gravity, stunning footwork and Habana-like pace leaving team after team in knots \u2013 this time Italy \u2013 with two tries to kick-start his tally at this World Cup. AFP via Getty Images 16/16 15. Elliot Daly (England) Possibly his best performance for England in the No 15 shirt to date, Daly linked up superbly with Jonny May \u2013 who is hard done by not to make the side this week \u2013 and Anthony Watson in what was a scintillating first half for the English back three.

Getty Images\n\n\u201cI like the way they play with their attacking mindset - and off the back of that you always get chances when they do play. They always have a few things up their sleeve that you don't expect so it is importune that we prep for that.\u201d\n\nThere is one particular moment that sticks in the 30-year-old\u2019s mind. Foley had already set up one try and scored the second to put Australia in front of England when he delivered the crushing final blow. Making a late dash from the shortside, he received the ball on the run from Will Genia and provided it up for Kurtley Beale on his inside shoulder to dart through, with the full-back then returning the favour for Foley to score his second. Through the entire move, not a single English hand gets to a Wallaby.\n\n\u201cThat was one where they came up with a play we had never seen before; Foley comes around and plays back inside. You think they are going to do one thing and they do something completely different. That is why I think we have to be so on it against Australia.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, we haven\u2019t shown a huge amount in any of our games yet. Against USA and Tonga we kept it pretty low key, against Argentina we had a bit more in the playbook but didn\u2019t need to show our hand. We will make sure we are right and ready to go and have things we haven\u2019t had to use yet.\u201d\n\nEngland are already the bookmakers\u2019 favourites for the clash in Oita next weekend for reasons that Youngs\u2019 own record explains. In 10 starts against the Wallabies, he has only been on the losing side one, only it was the most important one between the two sides.\n\nPart of the preparation for England has been finding the right level of confidence in themselves during this extended build-up, with the cancelled pool game against France on Saturday meaning Eddie Jones\u2019s side have a 14-day preparation for their knockout encounter.\n\nHaving not reached the business end of the tournament four years ago, there are few brains to draw upon in the squad to provide that experience of what cut-throat rugby really means, but Youngs is one and he believes that part of the problem in 2011 \u2013 and the solution now \u2013 is to not over-believe in your own abilities.\n\n\u201cI was thinking the other day about when we played France in the 2011 quarter finals,\u201d said Youngs, who experienced the defeat against a French team written off after a civil war with their own coaches. \u201cAt that stage they were deemed to be in turmoil - my experience is that you can't read into what happens in the past or even day-to-day.\n\n\u201cLooking back \u2013 don't believe your own hype as a side. Just take every day as it comes. Don\u2019t think about what happens before when you play each other. It is just about there and then.\n\n\u201cI remember that France game, we got off to a dreadful start and France raced ahead with two early tries, so you need to have that ability to get hold of the game early and to control it.\n\n\u201cIt is just about that 80 minutes - we will make sure we are aware of it. You have the belief and know that certain areas of the game are strong against them. You think about how they might potentially play, but as a whole, it gives you belief but we won't read too much into it.\u201d\n\nWhen the squads were announced, Australia head coach Michael Cheika named the most-experienced 31-man team in terms of caps out of all 20 nations at the World Cup. In contrast, England ranked in mid-table, but Youngs believes the squad now has an invaluable core of big-game experience running through it to make up for the dearth of World Cup knockout experience.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve got enough guys that have played internationally and club rugby,\u201d he added.. \u201cYou look at the Sarries boys, the number of them dotted within the team, they\u2019ve played some huge fixtures in Europe and stuff and they\u2019re used to big games.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done a lot of work off the field, we\u2019ve done a lot to make sure that we don\u2019t do that and I think the guys in the positions that they are will allow the team to feel relaxed and go out there to play how we play and not feel that tight about it or let the occasion get to us.\u201d", "description": "Ben Youngs believes England\u00a0have learned a few tricks from Australia\u00a0ahead of their Rugby World Cup quarter-final showdown, with the experienced scrum-half insisting they have something special up their sleeve for the Wallabies.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/13/08/ben-youngs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
