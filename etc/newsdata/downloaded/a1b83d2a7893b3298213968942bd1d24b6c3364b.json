It shows Nat, a 47-year-old member of Britain\u2019s Secret Intelligence Service (MI5), revealing his career choices to his daughter. As she picks away at his beliefs, Nat admits to serious reservations about the idea of England \u201cas the mother of all democracies\u201d, describing the country as in freefall, with \u201ca minority Tory cabinet of 10th-raters \u2026 Labour no better. The sheer bloody lunacy of Brexit.\u201d\n\nLe Carr\u00e9\u2019s editor at Viking, Mary Mount, said that the novelist \u201cdoesn\u2019t pull his punches\u201d when it comes to Johnson.\n\n\u201cThe thing about Le Carr\u00e9 is that he\u2019s always been as much at home in Europe as Britain. A man with his experience of the cold war could not walk away from the divisions in Britain, and between Britain and Europe \u2026 After the referendum, there was no choice for him except to look at where we are now,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is incredibly prescient, and a very emotional book in terms of how connected he feels to the history of Britain and Europe. There\u2019s no looking away, he addresses the very current political crisis.\u201d\n\nLe Carr\u00e9 has long been a critic of Brexit, putting his name in May to an open letter in which authors urged readers to support the EU. But he has always been clear that \u201cstory and character must come first\u201d in his novels \u2013 although he told David Hare in 2001: \u201cI am now so angry that I have to exercise a good deal of restraint in order to produce a readable book.\u201d\n\nFrom cold war spy to angry old man: the politics of John le Carr\u00e9 Read more\n\nIn Agent Running in the Field, Nat plays badminton regularly with an introspective young man, Ed, who hates Brexit and Trump and, said Mount, is \u201cseeking a way to fulfil his ideals\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not bleak because Le Carr\u00e9 does believe in the young in this book \u2026 there\u2019s a sort of faith in certain kinds of idealistic people, so I definitely don\u2019t think it\u2019s his bleakest book. I think it\u2019s ferocious about the political establishment, that\u2019s where he puts real force,\u201d she said. \u201cHe understands people\u2019s motivations. He\u2019s always been very good at human frailty. The thing I find most exhilarating is the way he sees through people, not just in a political sense. He gets to the nub of what people\u2019s motivations are. And it\u2019s very thrilling.\u201d\n\nExclusive extract from Agent Running in the Field by John le Carr\u00e9\n\n\n\n\u2018Steff, there\u2019s something about me that your mother and I feel it\u2019s time you knew.\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019m illegitimate,\u2019 she says eagerly.\n\n\u2018No, but I\u2019m a spy.\u2019\n\nShe too is staring ahead of her. This wasn\u2019t quite how I meant it to begin. Never mind. I say my piece as drafted, she listens. No eye contact so no stress. I keep it short and cool. \u2018So there you are, Steff, now you have it. I\u2019ve been living a necessary lie, and that\u2019s all I\u2019m allowed to tell you. I may look like a failure, but I do have a certain status in my own Service.\u2019 She doesn\u2019t say anything. We reach the top, uncouple and set off down the hill, still nothing said. She\u2019s faster than I am, or likes to think she is, so I let her have her head. We meet up again at the bottom of the lift.\n\nStanding in the queue we don\u2019t speak to each other and she doesn\u2019t look in my direction, but that doesn\u2019t disconcert me. Steff lives in her world, well now she knows I live in mine too, and it\u2019s not some knacker\u2019s yard for Foreign Office low-flyers. She\u2019s in front of me so she grabs the T-bar first. We have barely set off before she asks in a matter-of-fact voice whether I\u2019ve ever killed anyone. I chuckle, say no, Steff, absolutely not, thank God, which is true. Others have, if only indirectly, but I haven\u2019t. Not even arm\u2019s length or third flag, not even as the Office calls it, deniable authorship.\n\n\u2018Well if you haven\u2019t killed anyone, what\u2019s the next-worst thing you\u2019ve done as a spy?\u2019 \u2013 in the same casual tone.\n\n\u2018Well, Steff, I suppose the next worst I\u2019ve done is persuade chaps to do things they might not have done if I hadn\u2019t talked them into it, so to speak.\u2019\n\n\u2018Bad things?\u2019\n\n\u2018Arguably. Depends which side of the fence you\u2019re on.\u2019\n\n\u2018Such as what, for instance?\u2019\n\n\u2018Well, betray their country for starters.\u2019\n\n\u2018And you persuaded them to do that?\u2019\n\n\u2018If they hadn\u2019t persuaded themselves already, yes.\u2019\n\n\u2018Just chaps, or did you persuade female chaps too?\u2019 \u2013 which if you\u2019d heard Steff on the subject of feminism is not as light-hearted as it might otherwise sound.\n\n\u2018Largely male chaps, Steff. Yes, men, overwhelmingly men,\u2019 I assure her.\n\nWe have reached the top. We again uncouple and descend, Steff streaking ahead. Once more we meet at the bottom of the lift. No queue. Until now she has pushed her goggles up on to her forehead for the ride. This time she leaves them in place. They\u2019re the mirrored kind that you can\u2019t see into.\n\n\u2018Persuade how exactly?\u2019 she resumes as soon as we set off.\n\n\u2018Well, we\u2019re not talking thumbscrews, Steff,\u2019 I reply, which is pilot error on my part: Humour at serious moments is simply an escape route as far as Steff\u2019s concerned.\n\n\u2018So how?\u2019 she persists, gnawing at the subject of persuasion.\n\n\u2018Well, Steff, a lot of people will do a lot of things for money and a lot of people will do things for spite or ego. There are also people who do things for an ideal, and wouldn\u2019t take your money if you shoved it down their throats.\u2019\n\n\u2018And what ideal would that be exactly, Dad ?\u2019 \u2013 from behind the shiny goggles. It\u2019s the first time for weeks that she\u2019s called me Dad. Also I notice that she is not swearing, which with Steff can be a bit of a red warning light.\n\n\u2018Well, let\u2019s say, just for instance, somebody has an idealistic vision of England as the mother of all democracies. Or they love our dear Queen with an unexplained fervour. It may not be an England that exists for us any more, if it ever did, but they think it does, so go with it.\u2019\n\n\u2018Do you think it does?\u2019\n\n\u2018With reservations.\u2019\n\n\u2018Serious reservations?\u2019\n\n\u2018Well, who wouldn\u2019t have, for Christ\u2019s sake?\u2019 I reply, stung by the suggestion that I\u2019ve somehow failed to notice that the country\u2019s in free fall. \u2018A minority Tory cabinet of tenth-raters. A pig- ignorant foreign secretary who I\u2019m supposed to be serving. Labour no better. The sheer bloody lunacy of Brexit\u2019 \u2013 I break off. I have feelings too. Let my indignant silence say the rest.\n\n\u2018Then you do have serious reservations?\u2019 she insists in her purest tone. \u2018Even very serious. Yes?\u2019\n\nToo late I realise I have left myself wide open, but perhaps that was what I wanted to achieve all along: to give her the victory, acknowledge I\u2019m not up to the standards of her brilliant professors, and then we can all go back to being who we were.\n\n\u2018So if I\u2019ve got this right,\u2019 she resumes, as we embark on our next ascent, \u2018for the sake of a country that you have serious reservations about, even very serious, you persuade other nationals to betray their own countries.\u2019 And as an afterthought: \u2018The reason being that they don\u2019t share the same reservations that you have about your country, whereas they do have reservations about their own country. Yes?\u2019\n\nAt which I let out a merry exclamation that accepts honourable defeat while simultaneously asking for mitigation: \u2018But they\u2019re not innocent lambs, Steff! They volunteer. Or most of them do. And we look after them. We welfare them. If it\u2019s money they\u2019re after, we give them a pot of it. If they\u2019re into God, we do God with them. It\u2019s whatever works, Steff. We\u2019re their friends. They trust us. We provide for their needs. They provide for ours. It\u2019s the way of the world.\u2019\n\nBut she\u2019s not interested in the way of the world. She\u2019s interested in mine, as becomes apparent on the next ride up: When you were telling other people who to be, did you ever consider who you were?\u2019\n\n\u2018I just knew I was on the right side, Steff,\u2019 I reply.", "description": "Agent Running in the Field, due out next month, reflects \u2018the divisions in Britain, and between Britain and Europe\u2019 \u2013 read the extract here", "authors": ["Alison Flood"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4cc98160107d05c1296a91eb825f50c9442e9f4/1205_781_2451_1471/master/2451.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8aaf985d664cf9f2f9c5c7e2fd87a429", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
