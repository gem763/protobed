Recent surveys conducted by CNN, Rasmussen Reports and Monmouth University all confirm voters cringe over the idea. Here comes another one.\n\n\u201cJust 37% of voters say Congress should begin impeachment proceedings compared to the 50% who oppose it. This issue largely falls along party lines: seven in 10 (70%) Democrats support beginning impeachment proceedings, while 87% of Republicans oppose it,\u201d reports a Politico/Morning Consult poll conducted Sept. 13-15 and released Wednesday.\n\n\u201cInitiating impeachment proceedings against President Trump remains a popular move among the Democratic base, but it won\u2019t necessarily help them win voters across the aisle,\u201d advises Morning Consult vice president Tyler Sinclair.\n\nMore numbers in the Poll du Jour at column\u2019s end.\n\nTHE GOP WAR CHEST\n\nThe Republican Party brought in a record-breaking $23.5 million last month, the largest off-cycle August haul in history for either national party committee. The total raised so far is an eye-opening $141.4 million, and Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel credits Democratic antics for the surge.\n\n\u201cThanks to boycotts from Hollywood liberals and the Castro brothers doxxing private citizens who support President Trump, the RNC\u2019s fundraising hit record levels in August. The more Democrats demonize President Trump and his supporters, the more boots we can put on the ground to reelect him. Between the president\u2019s accomplishments and our grassroots infrastructure, Republicans are going to be unstoppable in 2020,\u201d Mrs. McDaniel says.\n\nNEVER A DULL MOMENT\n\nDemocratic presidential hopeful and billionaire Tom Steyer arrives in the nation\u2019s capital Thursday for a two-day visit. Curious? Mr. Steyer will appear at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute\u2019s \u201cFamilias Unidas\u201d awards gala, a \u201cGlobal Climate Strike\u201d in a city park and the Georgetown University Climate Forum.\n\nMr. Steyer, who founded a nonprofit group that combats climate change and promotes social justice, has also made a public call to impeach President Trump. He also backs the largest peacetime expansion of public service in U.S. history, and says he has qualified to participate in the next Democratic debate in October.\n\n\u2018ALL HYSTERIA, ALL THE TIME\u2019\n\n\u201cI rarely watch cable news anymore. It\u2019s all hysteria, all the time,\u2019\u201d writes veteran newsman John Stossel.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad my favorite magazine, Reason, cuts through the gloom and tells us the truth: There is less war and more food. We live healthier and longer lives. HIV will soon be history. We are increasingly free to be whoever we are and love whom we want. Even work has become more pleasant,\u201d notes Mr. Stossel, who produces video features for the publication.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a surprising message, since most journalists tell us everything\u2019s terrible,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re wrong,\u201d Reason editor-in-chief Katherine Mangu-Ward tells the columnist.\n\nMs. Mangu-Ward says all the media negativity is related to evolution \u2014 which wired humans to detect \u201cbad\u201d in the world.\n\n\u201cIf you are a caveman who hears a little rustling in the weeds and you say, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s probably fine\u2019 and the other guy says, \u2018It\u2019s probably a tiger,\u2019 that\u2019s the guy who lives. That guy was our ancestor,\u201d she advises.\n\n\u201cSo today, as life gets better, my profession wins clicks and ratings points by hyping whatever makes us afraid. Reporters ignore gradual improvement and, sometimes, miracles,\u201d Mr. Stossel observes.\n\nAPPLAUSE FOR ROBERT O\u2019BRIEN\n\nOne observer is delighted with President Trump\u2019s decision to appoint Robert C. O\u2019Brien as national security adviser.\n\n\u201cI can honestly say it\u2019s an outstanding choice,\u201d says Harry J. Kazianis, a senior director at the Center for the National Interest who has worked with Mr. O\u2019Brien for a decade.\n\n\u201cO\u2019Brien is known in the national security community as someone who saw the rise of China \u2014 especially its naval aspirations \u2014 as a key challenge to the U.S. in Asia. He was years ahead of the curve in calling out Beijing as a major threat to U.S. interests and was criticized heavily for it. However, it seems clear that through China\u2019s aggressive actions in recent years, O\u2019Brien was proven correct,\u201d says Mr. Kazianis.\n\n\u201cRobert has been someone who has been very vocal about the challenges the U.S. Navy faces in terms of taking on new threats from Russia, Iran and North Korea who are building advanced military assets to damage Washington\u2019s force projection capabilities around the world. O\u2019Brien has advised countless U.S. presidential hopefuls on U.S. foreign policy over many years \u2014 from Mitt Romney to Scott Walker to Ted Cruz \u2014 and he will serve President Trump well,\u201d he notes.\n\nPOLL DU JOUR\n\n\u2022 50% of U.S. voters say Congress should skip impeachment proceedings against President Trump; 87% of Republicans, 50% of independents and 18% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 81% of conservatives, 46% of moderates and 23% of liberals also agree.\n\n\u2022 37% of voters overall say Congress should begin the proceedings; 6% of Republicans, 31% of independents and 40% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 13% of conservatives, 39% of moderates and 67% of liberals also agree.\n\n\u2022 12% of voters overall are undecided, including 6% of Republicans, 31% of independents and 40% of Democrats.\n\nSource: A Politico/Morning Consult poll of 1,994 registered U.S. voters conducted Sept. 13-15.\n\n\u2022 Helpful information to [email protected]\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
