His playing career as a gnarly centre-half is enough to tell us that. But Tottenham haven\u2019t looked terribly settled in that department this season. They surrendered a two-goal lead in midweek against Olympiacos, and now have just one clean sheet in their past six games after this 2-1 defeat by Leicester.\n\nToday they showed little sign of improvement. Spur\u2019s defence is largely comprised of players who weren\u2019t settled in the summer: Toby Alderweireld looked a certified departure at one stage given his low asking price, Danny Rose has been linked with moves for two summers now, and Jan Vertonghen was mysteriously left out at the start of the season by Pochettino.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Could it be time for a changing of the guard in Tottenham\u2019s defence in search of stability?\n\n2) VAR isn\u2019t just a decision changer\n\nJust past the hour-mark of this game, Spurs had scored a goal, until they hadn\u2019t. Serge Aurier\u2019s strike was disallowed for offside in possibly the most pedantic VAR check we\u2019ve seen so far this season. Moments later Spurs\u2019 frustration would only grow.\n\nLeicester\u2019s right-back Ricardo Pereira was wheeling away just minutes later having scored an equaliser. Defensive frailties may have played a part, Jamie Vardy\u2019s brilliant movement and assist helped, but was the VAR call moments before still lingering in Tottenham minds?\n\nIt can\u2019t be understated just how psychologically compromising it must be to think you have a two-goal cushion, only to find out 60 seconds later that you don\u2019t. VAR calls looks to be just as impacting on the psyche of players as a sudden red card, abrupt injury to a key player or a crowd-buoying tackle.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

For the last couple of seasons he sacrificed any ambitions of being a talisman for Spurs, instead serving Pochettino as a nuisance to opponents, a physical, industrious entity whose task is simply to disrupt the other team\u2019s flow and make space for teammates to capitalise on.\n\nToday however, it was Lamela who expressed himself, and indeed, it is what he\u2019s been doing since the start of the season. In the first half, Lamela filled the boots of Christian Eriksen at number 10 admirably, playing a key pass in the build up to the first goal and creating even more from that point onwards.\n\nFears going into the season surrounding Eriksen\u2019s future left many worried Spurs would become dependent of Son Heung-min and Harry Kane. Lamela, if he continues in this vein, could become one of the surprise packages of the Premier League season.\n\n4) Harry Maguire replacement needed?\n\nFor all Leicester\u2019s superb business in the transfer market, losing Harry Maguire without bringing in a replacement could be the ceiling that blocks the Foxes from European football.\n\nKane\u2019s goal was a work of art, but his breaching of the defence was only possible after he drifted past Caglar Soyuncu whose shove didn\u2019t have the force needed to keep Kane away from goal.\n\nThe Turkish international has by no means looked out of place in Brendan Rodger\u2019s side, but you feel a more physical defender \u2013 of Maguire\u2019s mold- may be needed alongside him to provide the robustness required in the Premier League.\n\n5) Kane and Maddison show possible partnership\n\nThe first half saw two Englishmen star. James Maddison caused absolute havoc for Spur\u2019s defence coming close twice in quick succession. Then up the other end, Harry Kane scored a goal that made no sense given that he more or less in the fetal position when struck the ball.\n\nImagine what would happen if the pair played for the same team? This is an image that apparently hasn\u2019t entered Gareth Southgate\u2019s mind just yet.\n\nMaddison hasn\u2019t made a senior appearance for England just yet. It\u2019s a mystery as to why, the former Norwich midfielder was beating Lionel Messi and Eden Hazard for chances created at one stage last season. Today he was the decisive player with a sublime finish.\n\nThere\u2019s few players on Earth who benefit more from chance creation than Harry Kane. This may be a simplistic formula, but Maddison and Kane proved today that they are two of England\u2019s most talented players, and would surely benefit from each other on international duty. Go on Gareth, give Maddison a go.", "description": "1) Time to refresh Tottenham\u2019s defence? There are few things on which Mauricio Pochettino prides himself more than defensive prowess.
