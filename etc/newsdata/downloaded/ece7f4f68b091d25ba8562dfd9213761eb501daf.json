I left a lot of my approach shots below the hole and was able to be pretty aggressive.\u201d\n\nEven though players were allowed preferred lies, the course dried remarkably well after being deluged with six inches (150 mm) of rain on Friday.\n\nThe par-four 10th, however, was shortened to 140 yards because much of the fairway was under water at the start of play. The hole was still designated a par-four, though it played shorter than any of the par-threes.\n\nThe third round and the first part of the final round are scheduled for Sunday, with the remainder of the final round set for Monday morning.\n\nSpectators will be allowed back in on Sunday and most of the sell-out crowd of nearly 20,000 will no doubt have eyes for Woods, playing in Japan for the first time since 2006.\n\nThough the course was closed, several hundred people \u2013 TV crews, photographers, writers and officials -still gathered around the first tee to watch.\n\nThe 15-times major champion certainly noticed the unusual atmosphere. \u201cI made a couple putts today and I went to put my hand up and I\u2019m like, \u2018don\u2019t put your hand up, there\u2019s no one clapping\u2019,\u201d Woods said.\n\nThe only sign of Tiger-mania occurred at the fourth hole, where a high wire fence serves as a boundary of the property. Several hundred fans gathered along the adjacent road, though their view was blocked by trees and bushes.\n\nOne couple peeking through the fence said they had come from Taiwan and had decided that catching a glimpse of Woods was better than nothing.", "description": "Silence was golden for Tiger Woods as he carded a second straight six-under-par 64 to grab a two-shot second-round lead over Jeff Woodland at the Zozo Championship on Saturday.", "authors": ["Andrew Both", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191026&t=2&i=1445208921&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9P0FI", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
