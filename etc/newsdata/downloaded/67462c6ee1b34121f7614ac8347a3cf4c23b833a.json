What he didn\u2019t expect was the effect it would have closer to home.\n\nAs a consequence of that appearance and inspired by his brother for having had the \u2018balls\u2019 to do it, Chris\u2019s older brother Ben checked himself for the first time, found a lump and was diagnosed with testicular cancer. Prior to an operation to have his testicle removed, Ben went to freeze his sperm for potential use after the operation. It was during this process that he discovered his sample didn\u2019t contain any sperm at all.\n\nBen\u2019s cancer diagnosis has brought the fertility issue into focus for both brothers. Chris previously had a health scare due to a problem with his testicles and has subsequently undergone several operations. His last sperm test was six years ago and he is long overdue another test.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the Hughes brothers who are struggling with fertility issues. Studies show the sperm count of western men has more than halved in the past 40 years and is currently falling by an average of 1.4% a year. There is no definitive understanding of the reason why.\n\nBen\u2019s scare combined with the fact that both brothers are in new relationships has inspired the boys to tackle the issue head on. The film features both brothers\u2019 partners, including Chris\u2019s girlfriend Jesy Nelson, whose recent BBC Three documentary, Odd One Out, had huge impact.\n\nIn the same vein of spotlighting personal, impactful stories Me, My Brother and Our Balls will bring a fresh and authentic take to the largely unexplored but highly topical issue of male fertility.\n\nChris Hughes says: \u201cWhat started as an attempt to shed light on an issue that affects so many men turned into an incredibly personal journey for me and my family and has brought me even closer to my brother, Ben. I also learned things about male fertility that really surprised me, so hopefully people will find the documentary educational. Fertility is often a subject that guys don\u2019t consider until it might be too late, so I\u2019m hoping this documentary will raise awareness and help men who might be struggling with these issues.\u201d\n\nMe, My Brother And Our Balls is a 1x40\u2019 for BBC Three.
