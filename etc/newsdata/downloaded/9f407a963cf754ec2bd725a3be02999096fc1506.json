Guys who have been on (British and Irish) Lions trips as well and won important games in those series,\" Jones told reporters.\n\n\"If you look at this group, they've been through a lot of must-win matches. Grand Slams as well. So we're well-blessed in that department in the sense the guys are used to tough knock-out rugby,\" added Jones.\n\nWing George North said this semi-final had \"a better feeling about it\" than the 2011 match against France where Wales went in as \"a bit of an unknown\".\n\n\"This time, it feels like we've earned our place.\"\n\nRugby Championship winners South Africa have twice lifted the Webb Ellis Cup - in 1995 and 2007 - and are hoping that the 12-year pattern between trophies will continue.\n\nBut Wales have had the better of recent encounters between the two sides, winning the last four Tests - after losing all but two of the first 31 fixtures.\n\nHowever, they lost 23-19 to South Africa in the 2015 Rugby World Cup quarter-final, with current Springbok flyhalf Handre Pollard kicking 18 points.\n\nJones said he was expecting a kick-heavy game based around forward domination, with Springbok coach Rassie Erasmus again naming a replacements' bench including six huge forwards and two backs.\n\n\"It's a very, very physical game every time you play South Africa,\" he said.\n\n\"We expect the ball to be kicked a huge amount to us. It's making sure we deal with that threat and when we have the ball, being smart with it,\" said Jones.\n\nHe stressed that centre Jonathan Davies, who is returning from injury, was \"100 percent fit and raring to go\" to continue his midfield partnership with Hadleigh Parkes.\n\nAnd while the loss of Liam Williams was \"disappointing,\" Jones again pointed to the experience that replacement Leigh Halfpenny would bring to the match.\n\n\"We've got Leigh Halfpenny with 85 caps, two Lions tours, played in the semi-final of a World Cup. He's a wonderful player. Brings a different dimension to the back line,\" said Jones.\n\nThe winners on Sunday face either defending champions New Zealand or England - who play later on Saturday - in the final on November 2, also in Yokohama.\n\nTeams:\n\nWales\n\n15 Leigh Halfpenny, 14 George North, 13 Jonathan Davies, 12 Hadleigh Parkes, 11 Josh Adams, 10 Dan Biggar, 9 Gareth Davies, 8 Ross Moriarty, 7 Justin Tipuric, 6 Aaron Wainwright, 5 Alun Wyn Jones, 4 Jake Ball, 3 Tomas Francis, 2 Ken Owens, 1 Wyn Jones\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Elliot Dee, 17 Rhys Carre, 18 Dillon Lewis, 19 Adam Beard, 20 Aaron Shingler, 21 Tomos Williams, 22 Rhys Patchell, 23 Owen Watkin\n\nSouth Africa\n\n15 Willie le Roux, 14 S'bu Nkosi, 13 Lukhanyo Am, 12 Damian de Allende, 11 Makazole Mapimpi, 10 Handre Pollard, 9 Faf de Klerk, 8 Duane Vermeulen, 7 Pieter-Steph du Toit, 6 Siya Kolisi (captain), 5 Lood de Jager, 4 Eben Etzebeth, 3 Frans Malherbe, 2 Bongi Mbonambi, 1 Tendai Mtawarira\n\n\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Malcolm Marx, 17 Steven Kitshoff, 18 Vincent Koch, 19 RG Snyman, 20 Franco Mostert, 21 Francois Louw, 22 Herschel Jantjies, 23 Frans Steyn", "description": "Wales are hoping the experience of \"must-win\" Test rugby in their squad will make the difference when they take on South Africa in their semi-final.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6049/0e910dae3aef4db2a36ffeafa560abab.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
