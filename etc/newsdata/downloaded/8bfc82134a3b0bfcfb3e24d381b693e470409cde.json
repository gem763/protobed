Thomas was inactive for Week 1 against the Pittsburgh Steelers while dealing with a hamstring injury.\n\nHead coach Bill Belichick wasn't afraid to deal the receiver within the division, making a deal with the Jets for the first time in his tenure:\n\nThomas had been released following the preseason but re-signed with the Patriots after providing the team with more cap room.\n\nWhile he is still recovering from a torn Achilles suffered at the end of the 2018 season, the 31-year-old looked good in the preseason when given a chance. He finished with seven catches for 87 yards and two scores in the Week 4 preseason game against the New York Giants.\n\nHe now gets a chance at more playing time while reuniting with Jets head coach Adam Gase, who was the Denver Broncos' offensive coordinator in 2013-14 and receivers coach when Thomas entered the league in 2010.\n\nThe four-time Pro Bowler had his best seasons with Gase running the offense, totaling 203 catches for 3,049 yards and 25 touchdowns in two years.\n\nProviding Sam Darnold with another proven receiving option could also help the development of the young quarterback.", "description": "The New York Jets have acquired veteran receiver  Demaryius Thomas  in a trade with the New England Patriots, sending a 2021 sixth-round pick to the AFC East rival, per  Adam Schefter  of ESPN...", "authors": ["Rob Goldberg"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/827/486/hi-res-e1d797fe7a2afe3e82f15132a9fc6dd2_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
