Finally, some playing time opened with the Arizona Diamondbacks this spring.\n\nWith each passing homer, it\u2019s obvious the 28-year-old has seized his opportunity.\n\nWalker hit two homers, including his first career grand slam, to lead Arizona over the San Diego Padres 6-5 on Saturday night.\n\n\u201cI feel like that I\u2019ve proved to a certain point that I can help this team win,\u201d Walker said. \u201cA lot of that has to do with the guys around me, the staff and everyone from top to bottom. It means a lot.\u201d\n\nThe first baseman continued a breakout season with his 28th and 29th homers. He came into the year with 88 career at-bats over four seasons and an uncertain future, but has found a home in the middle of the Diamondbacks\u2018 lineup this season.\n\nArizona manager Torey Lovullo said Walker had been \u201claying in the weeds\u201d while waiting for regular playing time at the big-league level.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great player development story,\u201d Lovullo said. \u201cIt\u2019s a story of perseverance, waiting for your chance and making the most of it. He\u2019s done a tremendous job earning every single special moment this year.\u201d\n\nThe Padres lost for the 14th time in 16 games. They had a 5-1 lead in the seventh inning, but Arizona rallied with five runs, including Walker\u2019s grand slam deep into the left-center seats off San Diego\u2019s David Bednar (0-2).\n\nSan Diego hit three homers, including solo shots by Luis Urias and Eric Hosmer and a two-run blast by Manny Machado.\n\nHosmer has 99 RBIs this season and could reach 100 RBIs for the second time in his career in Sunday\u2019s final game.\n\nGarrett Richards started for the Padres and gave up just one run over 3 1/3 innings. He struck out four and walked four.\n\nThe 31-year-old Richards is trying to get back to his 2014 and \u201815 form, when he was one of the up-and-coming pitchers in the American League with the Los Angeles Angels. Injuries have limited him to just 31 starts over the past four seasons.\n\nHe had Tommy John surgery in 2018 and then hurt his shoulder when trying to come back earlier this year. He made his first start of the season on Sept. 16 and is signed through the 2020 season.\n\n\u201cI think these were great, great starts to build off of moving into the offseason,\u201d Richards said.\n\nArizona\u2019s Robbie Ray gave up four runs over six innings in his career-high 33rd start of the season. He struck out 10.\n\n\u201cIt was more of a fist fight for him to get through those six innings,\u201d Lovullo said. \u201cBut he did.\u201d\n\nJimmie Sherfy (1-0) earned the win after giving up one run in one inning of relief.\n\nKevin Ginkel earned his second save.\n\nLOTS OF HOMERS\n\nIt\u2019s been a record setting season for homers across the majors and the Diamondbacks are among the teams leaving the yard with regularity.\n\nThey\u2019ve hit 220 homers this season, matching the franchise record in 2017.\n\nBETTER THAN BEFORE\n\nThe Diamondbacks already have 84 wins this season, which is more than the 82 they finished with in 2018. That\u2019s somewhat surprising considering the team lost a few stars to free agency (A.J. Pollock, Patrick Corbin) and two more to trades over the past several months (Paul Goldschmidt, Zack Grienke).\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nD-backs: RF Adam Jones left the game in third inning because of a tight right hamstring. Jones hit into a fielder\u2019s choice in his only at-bat on Saturday. \u2026 Ray took a hard line drive off his left hip/backside area in the fourth inning. He limped around for a few moments but stayed in the game.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPadres: San Diego will start RHP Michel Baez (1-1, 3.25 ERA). It\u2019ll be his first start of the season after 23 relief appearances. He has 24 strikeouts in 27 2/3 innings pitched.\n\nDiamondbacks: Arizona RHP Taijuan Walker will make his season debut after missing most of the past two seasons because of Tommy John surgery and then a shoulder injury. Walker has a 31-31 career record and a 3.96 ERA.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Christian Walker crushed Triple-A pitching for the better part of four seasons, wondering if he'd ever get the chance to do the same thing in the big leagues.
