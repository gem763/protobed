Talk radio in its current format, with its heavy tilt toward conservative provocateurs, did not develop until the 1990s. In Nixon\u2019s day, cable news was still a few years away and the most popular hosts on the radio talked about subjects like extraterrestrial activity.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s allies repeatedly invoke the special counsel investigation into his campaign\u2019s dealings with Russia during the 2016 election, which failed to produce the smoking gun-type revelations that many on the left had predicted. The president\u2019s critics, they say, are once again engaging in a smear campaign to declare him guilty before all the evidence is out.\n\nAs Mr. Savage said on Wednesday, \u201cHe is already in the hay wagon on the way to the guillotine because of the fascist vermin in the media.\u201d\n\nThey also appear to have learned an important lesson about how Mr. Trump and his attorney general, William P. Barr, managed the narrative of the release of the special counsel report: They are moving fast to tell the story on their terms. And that is a story in which Mr. Biden and his son Hunter Biden \u2014 not Mr. Trump \u2014 have covered up wrongdoing involving their Ukrainian interests.\n\nMr. Hannity, whose radio show each day begins with an announcer declaring that he is \u201cFighting the Trump-hating liberal media one day at a time,\u201d called the Biden angle \u201cthe real story.\u201d\n\nMr. Limbaugh told listeners, \u201cJoe Biden may be the most corrupt politician in Washington bar none.\u201d Then he offered a novel theory of the origins of the Ukraine-Trump investigations. \u201cThis effort going on here is actually a twofer,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cIt is designed by the Democrats to take out both Trump and Biden and clear the way for anybody else, probably Elizabeth Warren.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump has also characterized the investigations as a Democratic conspiracy to weaken his standing, which he said is formidable. \u201cDemocrats feel they\u2019re going to lose,\u201d he said on Wednesday, pointing to Rasmussen numbers that had his approval rating at 53 percent, which he insisted was too low. \u201cThey say you could add ten to it. A lot of people say you can add more than ten to it,\u201d Mr. Trump said.", "description": "The pro-Trump media has wasted no time constructing their own version of events about Ukraine.", "authors": ["Jeremy W.
