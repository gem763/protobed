We need to wait to communicate because I think he has suffered a big problem with his arm.\n\n\"It was a massive impact. I think it was after three minutes and we never recovered after that massive impact.\n\n\"It was a massive, massive emotional impact for the team. To concede and to lose a very important player for us.\n\n\"And after the first action for our new keeper after 30 minutes we concede 2-0 down. We tried to find a solution and a different way to play and it was impossible and of course a tough moment. But we need to keep going.\"", "description": "Tim Sherwood has been criticised for his brutal joke about Huge Lloris after the Tottenham goalkeeper suffered a gruesome injury", "authors": ["Rich Jones", "Image", "Twitter", "Action Images Via Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20523070.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screen-Shot-2019-10-06-at-131100.png", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
