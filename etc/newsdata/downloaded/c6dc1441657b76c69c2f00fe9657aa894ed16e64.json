We save a lot, but invest less. So, yes, monetary policy does have an impact, but it is definitely not the dominant factor.\u201d", "description": "Interest rates in the euro zone look set to stay low for a long time, Dutch central bank governor and ECB board member Klaas Knot said in an interview published on Monday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1432849145&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M0CA", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
