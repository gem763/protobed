He was offended particularly by Mr. Snowden\u2019s several references to the U.S. Constitution.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be lectured by a traitor who speaks from a land that doesn\u2019t have a constitution,\u201d Krauthammer said.\n\nLike Krauthammer, I don\u2019t want to be lectured by Mr. Snowden, and I don\u2019t think I would glean any insights from a self-aggrandizing book by this liar, fraud, sneak thief and traitor.\n\nThe former CIA employee and NSA contractor stole and subsequently released to journalists in 2013 more than 1.5 million classified documents. The broad and largely unfiltered intel dump endangered American lives worldwide, and he no doubt gave much more damaging material to his hosts and protectors, the Chinese and the Russians.\n\nRather than reading Mr. Snowden\u2019s suspect memoir, I reread the 2016 House Intelligence Committee\u2019s bipartisan and unclassified report, \u201cReview of the Unauthorized Disclosures of Former National Security Agency Contractor Edward Snowden.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report\u2019s executive summary, Edward Snowden perpetrated the largest and most damaging public release of classified information in U.S. intelligence history. In August 2014, the chairman and ranking member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence directed committee staff to carry out a comprehensive review of the unauthorized disclosures.\n\nThe two-year extensive review offered a number of unclassified findings. According to the report, \u201cthese findings demonstrate that the public narrative popularized by Snowden and his allies is rife with falsehoods, exaggerations, and crucial omissions, a pattern that began before he stole 1.5 million sensitive documents.\n\n\u201cSnowden caused tremendous damage to national security, and the vast majority of the documents he stole have nothing to do with programs impacting individual privacy interests \u2014 they instead pertain to military, defense, and intelligence programs of great interest to America\u2019s adversaries,\u201d the report stated.\n\nThe review also stated that the secret materials Mr. Snowden handed over protected American troops overseas and provided vital defenses against terrorists and nation-states. The report also states that Mr. Snowden\u2019s disclosures diminished the intelligence community\u2019s capabilities to collect information against legitimate foreign intelligence targets, while others resulted in the loss of intelligence streams that had saved American lives.\n\n\u201cSnowden insists he has not shared the full cache of 1.5 million classified documents with anyone,\u201d the report stated. \u201cHowever, in June 2016, the deputy chairman of the Russian parliament\u2019s defense and security committee publicly conceded that \u2018Snowden did share intelligence\u2019 with his government.\u201d\n\nMr. Snowden\u2019s public disclosures are available to America\u2019s adversaries, including Russia, China, Iran, North Korean and terrorist organizations via the Internet.\n\nAs for Mr. Snowden\u2019s shady character, the report noted that he infringed on the privacy of thousands of government employees and contractors, and he obtained his co-worker\u2019s security credentials through deceit and abused his access as a systems administrator to search his co-worker\u2019s personal drives.\n\nThe report further states that before Mr. Snowden began his mass downloads, he was reprimanded for engaging in workplace disputes with NSA managers and was repeatedly counseled about his behavior at work. This evidence points to his motivation as an ego-driven, disgruntled worker rather than a principled whistleblower. And the report flat-out states that Mr. Snowden was not a whistleblower, as by law, publicly revealing classified information does not qualify someone as a whistleblower.\n\nContrary to his public claims that he notified numerous NSA officials about what he believed to be illegal intelligence collection, the report notes that there is no evidence that Mr. Snowden took any official effort to report any legal or moral concerns to any U.S. government oversight officials.\n\n\u201cSnowden was, and remains, a serial exaggerator and fabricator,\u201c the report concluded. \u201cA close review of Snowden\u2019s official employment records and submissions reveals a pattern of intentional lying. He claimed to have left Army basic training because of broken legs when in fact he washed out because of shin splints. He claimed to have obtained a high school degree equivalent when in fact he never did. He claimed to have worked for the CIA as a \u2018senior advisor,\u2019 which was a gross exaggeration of his entry-level duties as a computer technician. He also doctored his performance evaluations and obtained new positions at NSA by exaggerating his resume and stealing the answers to an employment test. In May 2013, Snowden informed his supervisor that he would be out of the office to receive treatment for worsening epilepsy. In reality, he was on his way to Hong Kong with stolen secrets.\u201d\n\nIn my view, Edward Snowden\u2019s true permanent record is one of lies, betrayal and aid and comfort to totalitarian regimes and terrorist organizations.\n\n\u2022 Paul Davis covers crime, espionage and terrorism.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
