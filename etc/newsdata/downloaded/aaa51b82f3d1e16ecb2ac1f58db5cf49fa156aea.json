(AP) \u2014 Joe Biden said Saturday he is undeterred by the ascendancy of Democratic rival Elizabeth Warren, noting that some of his supporters are already treating the primary campaign as a general election contest between him and President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t affect my strategy, period,\u201d the former vice president said in an interview with The Associated Press before a town hall meeting in South Carolina, home to the South\u2019s first primary next year. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not being facetious. I think she\u2019s a fine person, a good candidate, but I didn\u2019t get involved in deciding to run because of polling or a particular strategy.\u201d\n\nHe also acknowledged that outside groups are considering running ads to support him, a move that comes amid concerns within his campaign that his fundraising efforts have lagged.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s two things we know for certain: one, (Russian President) Vladimir Putin doesn\u2019t want me to be president, according to Facebook taking down the Russian ads going after me. And two, surely Trump doesn\u2019t want to face me,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWhat I\u2019m told is, there are people out there who want to take these ads on, take him on now, because it\u2019s a general election, me versus Trump, in their minds right now. But I\u2019ve had no conversations with them.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s standing in early-voting states such as Iowa and New Hampshire has been eroded somewhat by the rise of Massachusetts Sen. Warren and other challengers in the 2020 primary. Still, he finds himself in a strong position in South Carolina, where his support among the critical voting bloc of black voters could form the bulwark for his candidacy.\n\nBiden emphasizes his deep ties to the state, including relationships with two late and long-serving senators, Republican Strom Thurmond and Democrat Fritz Hollings. Some in his campaign have suggested that the state could provide an electoral firewall for him if he were to lose in Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to do very well in both those states,\u201d Biden said, saying a victory in South Carolina could \u201ccatapult\u201d him to wins across the South, and that losses in the other early states wouldn\u2019t hurt him there. \u201cThis is a marathon. Even if I knew I was going to win every other state, the Lord came down and told me that, I\u2019d still be in South Carolina.\u201d\n\nTo do that, Biden\u2019s campaign would need ample resources. This past week, his campaign said it was rolling back opposition to an independent political action committee that would allow wealthy individuals and corporations to boost his candidacy. It was a move that Biden had previously opposed.\n\nPart of that notion, Biden said, comes from outside groups treating the primary contest as essentially a general election contest between Biden and Trump, and seeking the opportunity to raise money to help Biden counter combative tactics from Trump and groups that support him.\n\nBiden trails his top primary rivals, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Warren, in total fundraising and cash-on-hand.\n\nAt 76, Biden is the second-oldest candidate among the Democratic candidates. The oldest, Sanders, 78, had a heart attack earlier this year. Asked if age matters among the candidates, Biden said he understands any questions on behalf of voters but he reaffirmed that his own health is robust and his age is not an impediment.\n\n\u201cRight now it\u2019s a legitimate question to ask, just like it was legitimate to ask me when I was 29 years old running for the Senate, did I have enough judgment to be a senator,\u201d Biden said. \u201cRight now, my age has brought with it a significant amount of experience in government and hopefully wisdom and some sound judgment.\u201d\n\nAsked whether he would pledge to only serve one term if elected, Biden said he wouldn\u2019t make such a promise but noted he wasn\u2019t necessarily committed to seeking a second term if elected in 2020.\n\n\u201cI feel good and all I can say is, watch me, you\u2019ll see,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean I would run a second term. I\u2019m not going to make that judgment at this moment.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMeg Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP", "description": "FLORENCE, S.C.
