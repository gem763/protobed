State-owned news agency Xinhua has reported 16 foreign teachers were arrested in July, while China Daily reported in August that thousands of teachers may be working in the country illegally.\n\nIt also comes shortly after the State Department imposed new rules on Chinese diplomats operating in the U.S., requiring them to notify the U.S. if they hold meetings with local American officials or visit educational or research institutions. The U.S. said this was a \u201creciprocal\u201d measure to level the playing field with how U.S. diplomats operate in China and said it was \u201cnot directly linked to any other part of the relationship.\u201d\n\nChina has lashed out at the new rules, saying the restrictions violate the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations. In the foreign ministry briefing on Thursday, China\u2019s Geng urged the U.S. to \u201ccorrect its mistake\u201d and withdraw the new rules.\n\nGeng added that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t see\u201d how the detentions could be related to trade tensions. Chinese authorities alerted the U.S. consulate in Shanghai and arranged consular visits with U.S. diplomats for the two American citizens, he said.\n\nHarlan in 2004 founded China Horizons, a business that helps bring teachers to China, and has been going back and forth between the U.S. and China since at least 2002, according to the company\u2019s website.\n\nPetersen is listed as an assistant director who has spent the last eight years \u201cjumping in and out of China\u201d as a volunteer and China Horizons employee.\n\n(Updates with additional context from fourth paragraph)\n\nTo contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Dandan Li in Beijing at dli395@bloomberg.net;Iain Marlow in Hong Kong at imarlow1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Brendan Scott at bscott66@bloomberg.net\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The Chinese foreign ministry said it has detained two American citizens who run an English-teaching business in China, a development that comes amid rising diplomatic tensions and a broader trade war between the two countries.Jacob Harlan and Alyssa Petersen were detained in the eastern", "authors": ["Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
