Mandatory Credit: Matt Kartozian-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe NFL announced Burfict\u2019s punishment for the helmet-to-helmet hit that prompted his ejection from Sunday\u2019s 31-24 victory over the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nThe league released a portion of the letter sent to Burfict from NFL vice president of football operations Jon Runyan:\n\n\u201cThere were no mitigating circumstances on this play. Your contact was unnecessary, flagrant and should have been avoided. For your actions, you were penalized and disqualified from the game. Following each of your previous rules violations, you were warned by me and each of the jointly appointed appeal officers that future violations would result in escalated accountability measures. However, you have continued to flagrantly abuse rules designated to protect yourself and your opponents from the unnecessary risk.\u201d\n\nBurfict has three days to appeal, which his agent Lamont Smith confirmed on Monday afternoon would take place this week. According to Pro Football Talk\u2019s Mike Florio, the suspension will likely be reduced upon the appeal. Two years ago, Burfict had a five-game suspension reduced to three games on appeal.\n\nSmith told NFL Network\u2019s Ian Rapoport that Burfict is returning home from London, where he traveled with the Raiders for Sunday\u2019s game against the Chicago Bears and where he was when he learned of the suspension.\n\nAny appeal would be heard by either Derrick Brooks or James Thrash, who are jointly appointed to hear appeals of on-field player discipline.\n\nBurfict\u2019s helmet-to-helmet hit on tight end Jack Doyle, who was on one knee near midfield after catching a 5-yard pass, took place Sunday with 11:34 left in the second quarter.\n\nBurfict has amassed more than $4 million in on-field conduct fines during a turbulent seven-year stretch with the Cincinnati Bengals from 2012-18.\n\nThe 29-year-old Burfict was suspended by the NFL to start both the 2016 and 2017 seasons for violation of player-safety policies, and again in 2018 for violating the league\u2019s policy on performance-enhancing drugs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough decision, it\u2019s a tough call. I think it was a flag,\u201d Raiders coach Jon Gruden said of the play in question on Sunday. \u201cIt was very well-documented that the league was going to review those plays this year in New York City. So, that\u2019s what happened and I\u2019ll wait to hear what their reasoning was. But it was a penalty, he went in there with his head down, it was called and, unfortunately for us, it was an ejection.\u201d\n\nBurfict has recorded 18 tackles in four games with the Raiders since signing a one-year, $5 million contract in March.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Oakland Raiders linebacker Vontaze Burfict was suspended for the rest of the 2019 season on Monday for repeated violations of unnecessary roughness rules.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435597917&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T17F-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
