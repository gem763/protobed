Now the tables are turning, and rivals are struggling to contain their glee.\n\n\u201cHappy birthday to me, happy birthday to me,\u201d sang a senior executive of another co-working company who asked not to be identified.\n\nIn the aftermath of WeWork\u2019s scuttled initial public offering, rivals such as IWG Plc, Convene, Industrious and Knotel are pitching themselves as more stable providers of flexible office space for landlords across New York, Toronto and Los Angeles with WeWork leases.\n\nThree large U.S. landlords have reached out to Novel Coworking in the last week to gauge the company\u2019s interest in either buying buildings leased to WeWork or managing their space if it becomes necessary. Novel, which has 34 locations across 26 cities, has taken over co-working spaces from other operators in the past, Chief Executive Officer Bill Bennett said in an interview. Unlike many of its competitors, Novel shuns leases, preferring to own real estate.\n\n\u201cEveryone is having conversations behind closed doors,\u201d Bennett said in a phone interview. \u201cPeople are trying to find their plan B and plan C.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a contrast to the days when WeWork employees would visit competitors\u2019 spaces posing as prospective customers, photograph their tenant lists, then contact all of them with offers of incentives to move. Sometimes they\u2019d set up outside rivals\u2019 offices with games and couches and pitch clients as they passed by. Through this summer, WeWork was adding more than a million square feet a month, according to Jones Lang LaSalle Inc., and had become the biggest private-sector tenant in London, New York and Washington.\n\nA WeWork representative declined to comment for this story. At two Manhattan locations, several WeWork members said they hadn\u2019t even heard of the company\u2019s IPO woes. Clients say that their day-to-day feels normal: Offices are still stocked with free coffee and beer, and the company still intersperses the workday with events for members.\n\nJust a month ago, New York-based WeWork was the fastest-growing co-working firm in the world with a highly anticipated IPO expected to unlock cash for growth. Now, its plan to go public has collapsed, co-founder Adam Neumann has stepped down as CEO and it could run out of cash as soon as next spring given its current pace of spending.\n\nThe uncertainty is weighing on landlords, investors and tenants with ties to the company. Deals for two large London office buildings leased mostly to WeWork are on the ropes, and the firm has pulled out of an agreement to rent space in a Dublin office block. In New York and London, WeWork\u2019s most concentrated markets, landlords are bracing for any drop in demand.\n\nWeWork, which leases and owns spaces in office buildings and then rents desks and rooms to customers, has raised more than $12 billion since its founding nine years ago and has never turned a profit. The company had been targeting a share sale of about $3.5 billion in September, people familiar with the matter have said. The withdrawal ends a turbulent process that turned one of the most hotly anticipated debuts into a cautionary tale of the public market\u2019s reticence to pay up for an unproven business model.\n\nFor rivals, it\u2019s the perfect opportunity to grab market share.\n\n\u201cWeWork was a competitor vying for space in Nashville, San Francisco, London and Boston but since filing their S-1, they\u2019re no longer in the mix,\u201d Ryan Simonetti, CEO of New York-based Convene, which specializes in flexible meeting, events and office space. \u201cThis has created a tremendous opportunity for us to tell our story and show not just existing landlord partners, but potential ones, how different our model is.\u201d\n\nFlexible Space\n\nIWG, formerly known as Regus, has been through many recessions and is publicly-traded with far less debt behind its growth. New York-based Industrious has pivoted to only using management agreements with landlords instead of outright leases, sharing in the profits. And Knotel only focuses on large enterprise clients.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question it\u2019s a good thing for Industrious,\u201d Jamie Hodari, the company\u2019s CEO, said. \u201cWeWork is still going to be a big formidable business, but they\u2019re going to be a big formidable business that behaves more accordingly to the typical confines of how businesses behave, as they\u2019re trying to march toward profitability and trying to sign prudent deals.\u201d\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- On its way up, WeWork poached customers with free rent and rich broker commissions, trampling on less wealthy and aggressive competitors to gain a seemingly dominant position.
