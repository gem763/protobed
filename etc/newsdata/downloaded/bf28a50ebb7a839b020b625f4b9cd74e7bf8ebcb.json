[Fox News] should go all the way LEFT and I will still find a way,\u201d Trump said in a series of tweets on Wednesday. \u201cThe New @FoxNews is letting millions of GREAT people down! We have to start looking for a new News Outlet. FOX isn\u2019t working for us anymore!\u201d\n\nDespite his regular cheerleading of the network, and continued support from reliable Fox acolytes like the hosts of Fox & Friends, as well as Sean Hannity and Jeanine Pirro, President Donald Trump has noticeably soured on Fox News as of late.\n\n\u201cFox is a lot different than it used to be,\u201d he noted last week. \u201cThere\u2019s something going on at Fox, I\u2019ll tell you right now, and I\u2019m not happy about it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe added that he didn\u2019t understand why there were negative polls about him on Fox News, or why the network was \u201cpivoting\u201d to the Democrats by hiring former DNC Chair Donna Brazile and broadcasting town halls featuring Democratic presidential candidates.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re making a big mistake because Fox was treated very badly by the Democrats. Very, very badly. Having to do with the debates and other things,\u201d Trump went on. \u201cI think Fox is making a big mistake because, you know, I\u2019m the one who calls the shots on that \u2014 on the really big debates.\u201d\n\nTrump has insulted specific Fox News anchors, including \u201clow ratings Shep Smith\u201d and the \u201cpathetic\u201d Juan Williams who is also \u201cnasty and wrong.\u201d\n\nJuan Williams at @FoxNews is so pathetic, and yet when he met me in the Fox Building lobby, he couldn\u2019t have been nicer as he asked me to take a picture of him and me for his family. Yet he is always nasty and wrong! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 18, 2019\n\nBut Trump isn\u2019t the only one irate about his deteriorating relationship with Fox. On Wednesday, Carl Cameron, who was Fox\u2019s chief political correspondent until 2017, told CNN that Trump\u2019s conflation of Fox\u2019s opinion section with its news section made him and other reporters at Fox \u201csick to their stomachs.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat he really means is, \u2018I need to have more opinion people who espouse more opinions,'\u201d said Cameron, now a correspondent for a progressive site, Front Page Live. (Joe Romm, the founder and editor-in-chief of Front Page Live, is also a reporter at ThinkProgress.) \u201c[Trump\u2019s tweets are] the kind of thing that makes the news department at Fox News, where I worked for a number of years, sick to their stomachs.\u201d\n\n\u201cNews people don\u2019t like to hear that stuff,\u201d Cameron continued. \u201cThe entertainment side, one the other hand, is vastly different and it\u2019s a threat to them. And Trump is basically challenging the Sean Hannitys of Fox News to beat up on their journalists. That\u2019s not going to work either.\u201d\n\nBut Trump needs to be careful with his attacks on Fox News. The president is performing poorly in polls that match him up against potential Democratic challengers in the 2020 election, and that could become more problematic if the U.S. creeps into a recession.\n\nAs a USA Today and Suffolk University poll shows, in a mock 2020 matchup Trump earns more than half his support from those who trust Fox more than any other network. Among those who \u201cstrongly approve\u201d of Trump, 60% prefer Fox to any other outlet.\n\nAll of that means that there\u2019s a significant overlap between Trump supporters and Fox News viewers, and no other conservative network comes close to matching the reach that Fox has. So, for Trump to marshal his base to win reelection, he\u2019s going to need all the help from Fox that he can get.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-825587596.jpg?w=1920&h=1080&crop=1"}
