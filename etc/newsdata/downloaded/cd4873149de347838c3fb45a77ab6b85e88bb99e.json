The law was in effect for two weeks until a judge overturned it\n\nThe sale and misleading marketing of flavored nicotine vaping products was banned in Michigan but the ban has since been overturned\n\nAdditional vaping deaths have now been confirmed in Texas, Utah and Massachusetts, bringing the national toll to 28 fatalities across 23 states (red) in the US\n\nJudge Cynthia Diane Stephens of the Michigan Court of Common Claims said that vaping was a public health concern, but agreed with the retailers that there was likely no basis for the governor to use her emergency powers\n\n'There is no serious dispute with respect to whether a vaping-use crisis exists among youth,' the judge wrote.\n\nHowever, she said, the data cited by the governor in ordering the ban had been available since at least February, undercutting the claim that it was emergency.\n\nStephens' ruling is a preliminary injunction, meaning it will remain in effect while the retailers and the state continue to litigate the dispute.\n\nWhitmer's office had no immediate comment.\n\nLast month, the Democrat governor ordered the state health department to issue emergency rules prohibit the sale and misleading marketing of flavored nicotine vaping products.\n\nAt the time, Whitmer said her number one priority was to keep kids safe and that she wants to stop companies using candy flavors to 'hook children on nicotine.'\n\nMichigan is one of several states, including Massachusetts, New York and Rhode Island, that have moved to restrict sales of flavored e-cigarettes on the grounds that they pose a health risk to teenagers.\n\nA New York court earlier this month blocked that state's ban from taking effect.\n\nGov Whitmer says her number one priority was to keep kids safe, and she wants to stop companies that are using candy flavors to 'hook children on nicotine'\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Juul was sued in federal court in San Francisco by a Florida woman who said her son, Daniel Wakefield, died in his sleep at age 18 as a result of Juul use. The mother, Lisa Vail, is seeking unspecified damages.\n\nVail's lawsuit is the first wrongful death case to be brought against Juul, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe company already faces a growing number of lawsuits by young adults and parents of teenagers against Juul and, in some cases, its parent company, Marlboro maker Altria Group.\n\nMost of the lawsuits say only that users became addicted to nicotine as a result of using Juul, but some allege serious health consequences.", "description": "A ban on flavored e-cigarettes in Michigan has been overturned two weeks after the emergency law came into effect.
