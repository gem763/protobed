If you make a purchase by clicking one of our links, we may earn a small share of the revenue. However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA TODAY\u2019s newsroom and any business incentives.\n\nWhether you just like the idea of letting a robot handle cleaning up your floors or you just don't like to vacuum, a robot vacuum cleaner can be a real help. But with so many companies making robot vacuums, how do you know if any of them are actually worth the money?\n\nLuckily, we've done the hard work for you. We have a specially built obstacle course in our labs that tests how well robot vacuums pick up dirt, navigate around ytour furniture, and deal with floor types from hardwood floors to low- and high-pile carpets.\n\nAfter testing nearly every major robot cauum on the market, we think the best is the iRobot Roomba i7+. It does the best job of handling a wide variety of tasks, works with Alexa and Google Assistant, it will keep your space tidy, and it can even empty itself so you don't have to. There are cheaper robot vacuums out there, but it's the best we've tested.\n\nHere are all our favorite robot vacuums ranked in order:\n\n1. iRobot Roomba i7+\n\nThe iRobot Roomba i7+, our pick for the best overall robot vacuum. (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar)\n\nThe iRobot Roomba i7+ is the first robot vacuum that can empty itself. A vacuum in the charging base suctions everything out of the bin into a sealable bag. That means you don't have to see, touch, or smell what your robot vacuum picks up.\n\nAlso for your convenience, the i7+ has a whole host of smart features, like Alexa and Google Home compatibility so you can give it voice commands. The i7+ can make virtual maps that can track cleaning cycles and even keep be told to stay out of individual rooms.\n\nFancy tech aside, the i7+ picks up quite a bit of dirt. On average, its main and side brushes picked up 10 grams of debris, so in a week it can keep save you the trouble of basic, manual cleaning until you have time to do a deeper clean. The i7+ is expensive, but every penny is accounted for in the large number of features and its excellent performance. If you are looking for a slightly cheaper alternative, you could look at the older Roomba 960, which runs less than $600 these days.\n\nGet the iRobot Roomba i7+ on Amazon for $999\n\n2. Eufy Robovac 11S\n\nThe Eufy RoboVac 11s, our pick for best value robot vacuum (Photo: Reviewed / Jonathan Chan)\n\nOur runner-up and pick for the best value robot vacuum is the Eufy Robovac 11S. This is the heir to the much-loved Robovac 11 and a sister model to the older Robovac 30c. This robot vacuum does its predecessors proud, offering excellent, strong suction and improved navigation. The slimmer design allows the S to get its brushes into more places, meaning less dirt for you to clean up later.\n\nWhen we tested, the 11S picked up around 11.6 grams of dirt per run, more than what most iRobot models manage. We also noted that during operation, the 11S was quiet, rarely making enough noise to interrupt a conversation. The combination of good dirt pickup and quiet operation make the 11S one of our favorite robot vacuums.\n\nGet the Eufy Robovac 11S on Amazon for $239.99\n\n3. Neato Botvac Connected\n\n#3 Neato Botvac Connected (Photo: Reviewed / Jonathan Chan)\n\nThe Neato Botvac Connected has both brains and brawn. In addition to a navigation system that lets it find dirt, and powerful brushes that clean it up, the Connected can be controlled remotely via an app for your smartphone. This app can set cleaning schedules and even directly control the unit. All in all, the Neato Botvac Connected presents high-end technology in a relatively affordable package.\n\nGet the Neato Botvac Connected on Amazon for 239.99\n\n4. Neato Botvac Connected D7\n\n#4 Neato Botvac Connected D7 (Photo: Reviewed / Jonathan Chan)\n\nThe Neato Botvac D7 Connected stands as a milestone in robot vacuums. It's the first robot vacuum you can tell when, how, and where to clean\u2013all from your smartphone. With its innovative No-go lines feature, you can draw lines on virtual maps, that the D7 creates, to prevent the unit from going near sensitive areas. While the No-go feature is cool, Neato also made a robot vacuum that cleans well.\n\nGet the Neato Botvac Connected D7 on Amazon for $699.99\n\n5. Ecovacs Deebot Ozmo 930\n\n#5 Ecovacs Deebot Ozmo 930 (Photo: Reviewed / Jonathan Chan)\n\nWe think the Ecovacs DeeBot Ozmo 930 sits ahead of most of the competition. Most smart vacuums let you start, stop, and schedule from your phone. You can create virtual barriers\u2013lines you don\u2019t want the 930 to cross. The opposite is also possible. With a single swipe, the app tells the 930 to go over a certain area multiple times. This feature works really well with high-traffic locations in your home.\n\nGet the Ecovacs Deebot Ozmo 930 on Amazon for $489.99\n\n6. Eufy RoboVac L70 Hybrid\n\n#6 Eufy RoboVac L70 Hybrid (Photo: Reviewed / Jonathan Chan)\n\nEufy is a company better known for making affordable robot vacuums. However, the L70 Hybrid is clearly a high-end model. It has laser navigation and forward-facing sensors so it can navigate the most cramped rooms with ease. The L70 also has next-level smart features. With the app, you can see a digital map of your home in which you can draw zones where you want your Eufy to focus on or completely avoid.\n\nWhile the L70 is loaded with smart features, it also knows the fundamentals well. Our testing showed that it picked up 10.8 grams of dirt on average, enough to keep up with a full-sized vacuum over the course of a week. If you\u2019re looking to upgrade to a top-tier robot vacuum, the L70 Hybrid is a solid choice.\n\nGet the Eufy RoboVac L70 Hybrid on Amazon for $549.99\n\n7. Ecovacs Deebot N79S\n\n#7 Ecovacs Deebot N79S (Photo: Reviewed / Jonathan Chan)\n\nThe Ecovacs Deebot N79S is an amazing value. However, that doesn't change the fact the N79S is the most basic model in this roundup.\n\nThe smart app basically transfers the functions from the N79S's remote control onto your smartphone. You can also control this robot vacuum via Amazon Alexa.\n\nPutting the N79S to the test, we found it cleaned well\u2014but sometimes skipped under furniture and shied away from throw rugs. There's no way to keep it out of a room, either. However, the smart functions worked well. Setup was a breeze\u2014just remember you need a 2.4GHz connection.\n\nGet the Ecovacs Deebot N79S on Amazon for $249\n\n8. Neato Botvac D3 Connected\n\n#8 Neato Botvac D3 (Photo: Reviewed / Jonathan Chan)\n\nNeato was the first robot vacuum company to introduce Alexa compatibility and the D3 is the most affordable model with this feature.\n\nWe like the D3 Connected because it's both capable and affordable. Like all Neato vacuums, its D-shaped design allows a wider brush to get right up against walls, and it does a good job cleaning. Neato robot vacuums also have sensors mounted on top that give them a clearer view of the room. In our tests, Neato is one of the few brands whose robots can consistently make the transition from bare floors to atop high-pile carpet, and back down again.\n\nThe D3 Connected's added smart features allow you to start, stop, and schedule cleanings from a smartphone app or through Alexa, Google Home, or Facebook Chatbot.\n\nGet the Neato Botvac D3 Connected on Amazon for $399.99\n\nHow we tested\n\nMost of the tests involve our robot obstacle course. The area contains analogs for furniture legs, shelves, and thresholds. Each robot vacuum has three chances to prove itself. The first two runs, we placed cork pellets under the shelves and between the furniture legs.\n\nWhen we let the robot vacuum loose, we look for how long a cleaning cycle takes in the various cleaning modes, what obstacles it was able to clean around thoroughly, and overall debris pickup. For the final test run, we replaced the cork with pet hair and run another test run.\n\nWhat You Need to Know about Robot Vacuums\n\nAfter testing dozens and dozens of robot vacuums, we think the name is a bit of a misnomer. A robot vacuum\u2019s ability to pick up dirt pales in comparison to that of a full-sized vacuum and can only really compete over the course of a week. We found that consumers experience the most satisfaction with their robot vacuums when they view them as floor maintainers in between manual cleanings. It can keep your place from looking dusty and grab bits here and there, but you'll still need a full-size vacuum.\n\nWe should also point out that most robot vacuums are designed for bare and hardwood floors and medium carpet. If you have throw rugs taller than \u00bd inch, your robot vacuum might not be able to climb atop it or may get stuck if it gets up there. This fact is vital for pet owners because pet beds can quickly become the bane of your robot vacuum's existence.\n\nAvoiding Robot Vacuum Pet Mishaps\n\nOver the years, three technologies have developed to help keep robot vacuums from running amok: magnetic strips, virtual barriers, and app-based barriers. All three of these methods have their pros and cons.\n\nMagnetic strips: These are the simplest. You lay them on the floor and they create a barrier that designated robot vacuums will not cross. While they don\u2019t require batteries, magnetic strips are cumbersome. Most robot vacuums that included them only ship with one, so you have to cut them if you want to cover multiple entryways.\n\nVirtual barriers: The next step up are virtual barriers. These battery-powered devices emit an infrared line that tells robot vacuums to turn back. Some specialized barriers, like iRobot\u2019s lighthouse, can create a \u201chalo\u201d or a circle barrier to encompass a piece of furniture or a pet bowl, but most work by line of sight, meaning you'll need several to block multiple doorways.\n\nApp-based barriers: The final method, aside from shutting doors, involves specialized apps. New mapping technologies allow robot vacuums to actually map out and navigate your home like a person might. They can then send that information to your phone, letting you designate where the vacuum should and shouldn't go. Companies like iRobot, Neato, and Ecovacs all produce robot vacuums were you can draw lines on virtual maps to create these barriers.\n\nRobot vs. Vacuum\n\nLike most modern tech with limited power and a mobile (in this case, literally) design, robot vacuums typically have to make a fundamental tradeoff: are they a good robot, or a good vacuum?\n\nA good robot can navigate its surroundings expertly, learning where to go and avoiding getting stuck on obstacles. Not only does this lead to a more consistent clean, there are fewer times you'll have to actually go \"rescue\" your robot from your high pile carpet. However, being a good robot often means drawing power away from the brushes and to the wheels, sensors, and CPU.\n\nIn our experience, the robot vacuums that clean well tend to do so aggressively (not unlike people, actually). They cover a lot of area, but they also ram into your furniture. A robot vacuum can\u2019t clean where its brushes haven\u2019t been, so this in some ways actually allows them to get closer to the dirt that lesser vacuums miss. They also tend to be noisier as more power is drawn to the motor to create more powerful suction.\n\nThe basic rule of thumb is that the more a robot vacuum costs, the better robot it is. In our experience these better robots also tend to pick up less dirt. We\u2019re talking about a 20 percent difference between the best navigators that never get close to a chair leg and a robot vacuum that scuffs everything in your house. The most exceptional robot vacuums do both and they tend to win our Editor\u2019s Choice and Best of Year awards.\n\nDifferent Types of Navigation\n\nRobot vacuums tend to have two different types of navigation, infrared and optical (or a combination of both). Infrared sensors shoot out beams that reflect off surfaces to let the vacuum tell how far away things are. Optical navigation involves cameras, usually mounted on the top of the unit. Typically, these cameras utilize contrast and landmarks to decipher where they are.\n\nWe've seen excellent navigators use both methods, but they're not equal. Robot vacuums that rely on optical navigation cannot work in a pitch black room, for instance, but infrared may miss certain objects or surfaces in your home.\n\nHow long do robot vacuums last?\n\nThis is a very tricky question. However, we find that the battery is the shortest-lived part of a robot vacuum. Both nickel and lithium batteries have hard limits on the number of times they can recharge. Nickel batteries suffer from a limitation known as memory loss\u2014basically, over time, they lose the ability to recharge fully.\n\nThe cathodes of lithium batteries tend to wear after a few years. As a rule of thumb, you can expect to buy a new battery pack for your robot vacuum after two to four years of use, depending on how often you run your device.\n\nEither way, you can expect most robot vacuums to handle a small cleaning and attempt to return to charge themselves at their base station. Though some models boast better battery life than others, in most cases you'll get more utility out of a robot vacuum that is smart, navigates rooms well, and doesn't get stuck over one that has a little bit extra life per charge.\n\nAre robot vacuums worth the money?\n\nIf you\u2019re a pet owner, a robot vacuum helps get at balls of fur that are everywhere. As a floor maintainer between manual cleanings, they can save a lot of time and energy.\n\nThe way to get your money\u2019s worth is to set a robot vacuum to automatically run every day. Getting one with an app is also a bonus for those times you need to give your floors a once-over before coming home to any last-minute surprise guests.\n\nOverall, we think they're a good investment for someone that doesn't like having to sweep up little debris everyday. Some of our favorite robot vacuums for the money cost just a couple hundred dollars, and over a year or two those time savings could really be worth it to you.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/reviewedcom/2019/10/16/best-robot-vacuums-irobot-roomba-eufy-neato-and-more/3985206002/", "description": "Looking for the best robot vacuum?
