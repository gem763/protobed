Thankfully we now know the answer, due to his perplexing decision to do just that.\n\nIn the audio version of his new book Catch and Kill \u2013 which exposes the methods used to protect serial predators \u2013 Farrow not only reads the text himself, but does the voices of a variety of people, as discovered by TV writer Craig Rowin.\n\nSo while the book contains a wide variety of scoops and unreported revelations, it also contains (at least) the following seven accents.\n\nAustralian\n\nThis should never have been attempted, but you have to admit it becomes quite good by the end. The opening is the most distressing, with the halted, breathy start to \u201cI have\u201d veering into what sounds like a Bostonian accent on \u201cpretty hard\u201d.\n\nCraig Rowin (@CraigRowin) \u201cHoward: The Australian Surveillance Dude\u201d pic.twitter.com/tFDhgrPTEs\n\nFrom there, Farrow\u2019s impersonation of Australian journalist Dylan Howard \u2013 who, in an unrelated matter, has threatened him with defamation \u2013 veers into The Simpson\u2019s Bart Visits Australia, before finding redemption.\n\nEnglish\n\nWavering between plummy and cockney, Farrow\u2019s English accent wanders from upstairs to downstairs and never finds a place to sit. It\u2019s the indecision that kills it, enabled by a quote so long it gives him the time to lose belief.\n\nCraig Rowin (@CraigRowin) \u201cFriedman: Cockney Man Interested in Book\u201d pic.twitter.com/o3RoYgTkFb\n\nEastern European\n\nBy far the worst. Truly terrible. Not only is the voice a complete caricature, but it really springs into your ears with urgency. You need a line break and a long intro for something like this.\n\nCraig Rowin (@CraigRowin) Is anyone else listening to Ronan Farrow\u2019s audiobook of \u201cCatch and Kill\u201d and baffled by his decision to do voices? Important reporting/audition for SNL showcase? This is his \u201cTough Ukrainian Guy.\u201d pic.twitter.com/ULGGtNPAWe\n\nNew Zealand\n\n\n\nWithin this accent, Farrow actually finds the elements of a good Australian, English and, if he ever needs one South African.\n\nThe A\u2019s are good, and spot-on Kiwi. \u201cAll costs\u201d and \u201cin hindsight\u201d could pass for English. And \u201cAt the time,\u201d is a brilliant Australian. At other points he seems to just be using his regular voice.\n\nCraig Rowin (@CraigRowin) His \u201cPeter Jackson.\u201d (Thanks to @mandamels for the heads up) pic.twitter.com/KR0FtJMd9F\n\nDonald Trump\n\nHow can an American do a New York accent this poorly? This sounds like me trying to say \u201cHey I\u2019m walking here\u201d.\n\nCraig Rowin (@CraigRowin) His \u201cTrump\u201d pic.twitter.com/aSMiS8cKQG\n\nUnclear female European\n\nHaving chanced his arm at race and age, why add gender into the mix? Nobody would have blinked if he simply hired a female voice actor. Instead we get an awkward trifecta.\n\nCraig Rowin (@CraigRowin) \u201cAnna: The Refined European\u201d pic.twitter.com/nct4W3I6gr\n\nItalian\n\nThe thing is, a lot of real audio of Italian model Ambra Gutierrez, who helped expose Weinstein\u2019s sexual abuse, exists.
