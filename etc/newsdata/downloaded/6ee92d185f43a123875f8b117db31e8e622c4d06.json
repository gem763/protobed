Mike Folmer was arrested and charged Tuesday night, the state attorney general\u2019s office said. Investigators allegedly found two images of child pornography on Folmer\u2019s cellphone after they executed a search warrant at his house in Lebanon County and asked him to turn it over.\n\nIn February, the social media site, Tumblr, sent a complaint to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children that a user had uploaded at least one image that contained suspected child pornography in December 2017, according to court papers provided by the attorney general\u2019s office.\n\nA message left at Folmer\u2019s listed home telephone number wasn\u2019t immediately returned Tuesday night, and neither were messages for a lawyer said by a Senate official to be representing Folmer.\n\nHe was charged with possession of child pornography and criminal use of a communication facility, both felonies.\n\n\u201cMichael Folmer stated that he had been dealing with some personal problems/issues and that he had received child pornography through his Tumblr blog,\u201d an agent of the attorney general\u2019s office wrote in the court papers.\n\nAttorney General Josh Shapiro revealed the arrest in a statement after 9 p.m. Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI will continue to say it - no one is above the law, no matter what position of power they hold,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201cI will continue to work to protect children and hold those who abuse them accountable.\u201d\n\nBail was set at $25,000, but it was not immediately clear if Folmer had posted it, the attorney general\u2019s office said.\n\nFolmer, a 63-year-old Republican, was elected to a fourth four-year term in November and chairs the Senate State Government Committee, where he has spent considerable time recently working on election reform bills.\n\nLong considered one of the chamber\u2019s most conservative members, Folmer was crucial to helping swing Republican votes behind a bill to legalize medical marijuana in 2016. He routinely pulls a miniature copy of the U.S. Constitution from his breast pocket when speaking publicly to emphasize a point.\n\nFolmer was first elected in 2006, knocking off the Senate\u2019s then-sitting Republican majority leader in that year\u2019s anti-pay raise backlash.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A Pennsylvania state lawmaker is facing child pornography possession charges after authorities say a social media website told them the user had uploaded an image using their service.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Marc Levy"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/17/AP_17305616576302_c0-0-4928-2873_s1770x1032.jpg?cafdcf567370115721cd408b01a99f895f2e3496", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
