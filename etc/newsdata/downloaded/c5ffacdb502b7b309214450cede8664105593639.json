Ghani was reportedly not harmed in the bombing; the Taliban says it is responsible for the attack.\n\nThe Taliban also said it was behind a second smaller attack, in which a suicide bomber blew themselves up in Kabul, in an area near the U.S. embassy and other official buildings. No casualties have been reported from that incident.\n\nThe attack on Ghani's campaign rally came during a somewhat rare personal appearance by the president \u2014 due to security concerns, he has often addressed crowds by video, speaking into a laptop in his office as he seeks reelection. But the rally's location in Parwan, a province north of Kabul that includes Bagram Air Base, was deemed safe enough for the president to visit in person.\n\nA local official says the bomb was planted in a security vehicle. Images from the scene showed a green police truck, a crumpled motorbike and other vehicles that had been mangled and scorched by the blast, in what appears to be a parking area for the political rally.\n\nWith presidential elections scheduled for Sept. 28, the Taliban has condemned the vote, threatening related activities and warning Afghans to stay away.\n\nAfter Tuesday's bombing, Ghani released a statement saying, \"By continuing to commit atrocities, the Taliban demonstrates that they don't have the will for peace or stability of Afghanistan,\" according to TOLO News.\n\nDuring his reelection campaign, Ghani has been to a few rallies with his running mate, Amrullah Saleh \u2014 whom the Taliban tried to kill in a high-profile attack in Kabul in July, on the first day of campaigning. Saleh survived that suicide bombing, but 20 people died.\n\nThe U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan says that targeting the campaign rally shows \"despicable disregard for civilian life [and the] fundamental human right to participate in democratic process.\" It adds, \"Such attacks, with scores of civilian casualties, are a violation of international law. \"", "description": "The attack at President Ashraf Ghani's campaign rally came during a rare personal appearance by the president.
