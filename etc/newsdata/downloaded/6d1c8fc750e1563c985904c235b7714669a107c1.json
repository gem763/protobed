Have some decorum.\n\nMel is facing off against Holly Willoughby as the new team captain on the x-rated ITV2 series, which has proven in the past to laugh in the face of propriety.\n\nThe show puts celebs in some seriously awkward positions which often have sexual innuendo built in as standard.\n\nSometimes though, it\u2019s all in the name of gross-out humour \u2013 with Mel nearly being sick as James Blunt downed a pint of cottage cheese last week.\n\nMore: Mel B Mel B 'had wild fling' with James Arthur after meeting on America's Got Talent Holly Willoughby shoved fist in Mel B to win savage Celebrity Juice game James Blunt attempts to crawl through naked man's legs but bumps into his manhood\n\nMel and Holly have proven to be worthy adversaries over the past couple of weeks, and speaking to Metro.co.uk leading man Keith admitted that things sometimes get nasty as they\u2019re both so competitive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018They\u2019re so competitive, both of them, so competitive, but that\u2019s what makes great TV. And me just winding up Mel B all the time,\u2019 Keith said, adding that one test game called Box Mountain ended up with Holly Willoughby\u2019s fist in Mel B\u2019s mouth.\n\nCelebrity Juice airs Thursdays at 10pm on ITV2.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
