Getty\n\nWho of us is to say if the questions chosen were \u201creally difficult\u201d? \u201cWhat are you going to do about homelessness?\u201d was one of them. Homelessness we would learn, is really bad. We wouldn\u2019t learn much about the fact it is roughly eight times badder than when the Conservatives came to power nine years ago, but then why would we?\n\nWe can but wonder whether the unmediated questions, mediated by Mr Johnson\u2019s mediators, had been deliberately mediated so as to choose only the \u201creally difficult\u201d ones. If that is the case, it will have to remain one of life\u2019s great mysteries why some of the following really difficult ones just didn\u2019t make the cut:\n\n\u201cWhy did you lie to the Queen? Neil Rowlingson, Postmaster, Burwell.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you agree that it is wrong that anyone who stands in contempt of parliament to hold a role in government, such in the capacity of a special advisor? Simon Sleath, Teacher, Bristol\u201d\n\nFor some reason, none of Mr Johnson\u2019s mediators let this really difficult question slip unmediated on to the prime ministerial iPad. It is tough to understand why.\n\nOne possible explanation is that it refers explicitly to Dominic Cummings, who likes to fire government staff that don\u2019t actually work for him and then have them marched out of 10 Downing Street by armed police.\n\nWhich, of course, is not to say that none of the unmediated questions, mediated by the Downing Street mediators, were not really difficult.\n\nNor is it to say that 14 full minutes of a sham that would be too shameless for the Kim Jung dynasty to bother with, should not count as proper public scrutiny.\n\nBut it is, perhaps, worth noting that by the time the farce began, Mr Johnson should have faced 40 minutes of actual, unmediated questions at the despatch box of the house of commons at prime minister\u2019s questions.\n\nAfter that, he was due to face at least 90 minutes of questions from all of the heads of the House of Commons various select committees, something prime ministers are compelled to do at least twice a year.\n\nBut none of those things happened, because Mr Johnson has suspended parliament, a course of action that, on Wednesday morning, was declared unlawful by the Scottish High Court, a verdict which the government is now appealing.\n\nStill, at least there\u2019s Geraldine. \u201cAre you planning on signing us up to staying in the EU after 31 October which will leave this country in even more debt than it already is?\u201d Geraldine wanted to know.\n\n\u201cGood point, Geraldine!\u201d says the prime minister, jabbing his finger at the camera.\n\nGeraldine\u2019s unmediated question, unmediated by Mr Johnson\u2019s mediators, just so happened to chime exactly with Mr Johnson\u2019s current Brexit lie.\n\nThat staying in the EU is costing the country \u201c\u00a3250m a week\u201d (down from \u00a3350m a week), and so we must leave now or saddle ourselves with debt.\n\nThe fact that the no deal Brexit that is his current plan will, according to the government\u2019s own analysis, shrink GDP by at least five per cent, around twenty times this amount, is not something Geraldine is allowed to know, because he continues to refuse to publish the documents.\n\nBut that, of course, is why he has shut down parliament, in favour of sitting in his office like a tragic Colonel Gaddafi tribute act, avoiding MPs, avoiding questions, and lying down somebody else\u2019s smartphone.\n\nThese are the times in which we live. These are our politics. They are the bleakest they have ever been.", "description": "Fully 12 seconds had elapsed before the prime minister began lying, which might not seem like much, but he smashed his personal best.
