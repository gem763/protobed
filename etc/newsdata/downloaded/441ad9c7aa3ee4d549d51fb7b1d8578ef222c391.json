Ahead of Monday's U.N. climate summit in New York, Miguel Arias Ca\u00f1ete, the European commissioner for climate action and energy, declared: \u201cThe EU has a strong story to tell \u2014 we are global climate leaders.\u201d\n\nEuropean Commission President-elect Ursula von der Leyen has promised to set a 2050 climate neutrality goal for the EU and to raise the bloc's 2030 emissions reduction target to at least 50 percent from 1990 levels.\n\nThe plans to spend more on private jets also stand in sharp contrast to remarks by Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, who has highlighted his use of commercial flights. \u201cWhen I was talking to Donald Trump, I was constantly looking at my watch so that I wouldn\u2019t miss my flight home,\u201d Juncker told German newspaper Bild am Sonntag earlier this year. \"Trump kept saying, \u2018Your \u2018plane can wait!\u2019 He didn\u2019t realise that I didn\u2019t have my own aeroplane.\"\n\nIn response to questions from POLITICO, a spokesperson for the Commission said that Juncker had taken 25 flights on private planes in 2018, the same number as in 2017. In 2016, he took 18 private flights, compared to 21 in 2015.\n\nJuncker has come under criticism in the past for taking \"air taxis\" to short-haul destinations like Strasbourg.\n\nThe Commission said that private jets are only rented when there are no other options, and noted that the president's travel expenses are published on a regular basis.\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk follows similar guidelines on the use of private aircraft, the Council\u2019s press office said.\n\n\u201cThe president always takes chartered flights in line with the existing rules for that,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cMore concretely, chartered air transport can only be considered when commercial flights are not available to reach a destination, when they cannot fit with the diary commitments of the president or the members of the College [of Commissioners] or for security reasons.\u201d\n\nThe spokesperson added that \u201cwhen the president takes a chartered flight, he is accompanied by a delegation so the cost of the flight has to be divided by the total number of people traveling with him \u2014 an average of nine.\u201d\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk follows similar guidelines on the use of private aircraft, the Council\u2019s press office said. It said that if no commercial flight was suitable, the Council president could use private aircraft or a plane provided by the Belgian air force.\n\nTusk took 23 \"air taxi\" flights in 2018 (five of them provided by the Belgian air force), the Council said. That compared with 29 such flights in 2017, a total of 20 in 2016, and 26 in 2015.\n\nThe European Parliament did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe EU's original contract stated it was for the \"provision of air-taxi transport services (chartered jet aeroplanes) for use by the President or other members of the European Commission, for the European Parliament Presidency, for the President of the European Council, for the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, and any accompanying persons, mostly in the European Union.\"\n\nThe amended contract just provides a guarantee that the threshold will be sufficient to cover the needs of the EU institutions for the remaining period of the contract\u201d \u2014 European Commission spokesperson\n\nThe initial contract was awarded for an estimated 871 flight hours, with planned frequent destinations including Strasbourg, Berlin and Stuttgart. The top officials, according to the contract notice, were expected to primarily use jets carrying 7-9 passengers.\n\nBut the officials appear to have been using private jets more than expected: Earlier this month, the new notice was published stating that an \u201canalysis of expenditure during the period already elapsed has led to the conclusion that this threshold will not be suffice [sic] to cover the needs of the European institutions until the expiry date of the contract i.e. 30.4.2021\u201d and that as a result in March \u201cthe Commission launched a negotiated procedure to increase the overall maximum threshold of the contract.\u201d\n\nThe Commission spokesperson said: \u201cThis does not mean that the total amount under the contract will be spent. The amended contract just provides a guarantee that the threshold will be sufficient to cover the needs of the EU institutions for the remaining period of the contract.\u201d\n\nThe three winning contractors \u2014 Masterjet, Unijet and Abelag \u2014 all belong to the Luxembourg-based Luxaviation Group. In 2015, China Minsheng Investment bought a 33 percent stake in the Luxembourgish company.\n\nJoshua Posaner contributed reporting.\n\nThis article is from POLITICO Pro: POLITICO\u2019s premium policy service.
