The company has formed a joint venture with Pfizer's (N: ) consumer health division for over the counter products, which include Sensodyne toothpaste and Panadol painkillers.\n\nGSK's leaner structure has also helped the company focus more on its pharmaceuticals business and build a newer pool of treatments, including its shingles vaccine, Shingrix.\n\nWalmsley said she was delighted with the vaccine's performance, which had exceeded the drugmaker's expectations.\n\n\"Shingrix will be a material contributor to the company's growth for some time,\" she told reporters.\n\nGSK has at times struggled to keep up with demand.\n\n\"Obviously it (Shingrix) has performed ahead of our initial expectations, which is why we have been working extremely hard on improving and accelerating our supply,\" Walmsley said.\n\nSales of the vaccine, launched in 2017, jumped 76% to \u00a3535 million, zooming past analysts' estimate of \u00a3464 million, driven by sales in the United States where doctors are recommending immunisation more often for patients.\n\nThat performance helped sales at GSK's vaccines business to increase 15% to \u00a32.31 billion in the third quarter, above consensus.\n\nShingrix sales have already reached \u00a31.24 billion in the first nine months of this year and it looks on course to exceed analysts' \u00a31.52 billion sales forecast for 2019.\n\n(For an interactive graphic on Shingrix, click here https://tmsnrt.rs/34hfghk)\n\nThe company said its new profit forecast also reflected operating performance, increased investment in research and development as well as a lower expected effective tax rate of around 17% for the year.\n\nGSK's joint venture with Pfizer reported sales of \u00a32.53 billion, boosted by U.S. drugmaker Pfizer's older brands.\n\nOn Brexit, the British drugmaker said it had been preparing for a no-deal divorce between Britain and the European Union for some time now.\n\n\"Any difference between the preparation for the risk of a no-deal scenario and an ordered planned one in January is de minimis because that all happened over the last couple of years,\" Walmsley said.\n\nTotal group sales of \u00a39.39 billion surpassed a company-compiled consensus https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/investors/analyst-consensus/analyst-consensus of \u00a39.02 billion. This is the drugmaker's sixth consecutive quarterly sales beat, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.\n\nGSK shares were up 1.7% at 1,769 pence at 1317 GMT.", "description": "GSK raises profit forecast after shingles vaccine sales boost", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9T0YX_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
