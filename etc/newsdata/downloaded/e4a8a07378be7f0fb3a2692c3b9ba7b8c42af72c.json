He had learned the first aid procedure for heart attacks only a week before, as part of his training to become a St John Ambulance Cadet.\n\nThe third Young Hero award of the night went to two teenage brothers aged 15 and 16 who went to the aid of a neighbour they had never met after he tried to take his own life. Gabriel Walker, who learned St John Ambulance first aid at army cadets, performed chest compressions, while his brother, Jack, relayed information to and from the emergency services.\n\nThese inspirational young people were celebrated for their bravery, courage and lifesaving skills at the annual Everyday Heroes event. This honours individuals, volunteers and teams who step forward in their communities and in the moments that matter to help loved ones, colleagues, customers or even strangers in need.\n\nThe awards were hosted for the second time by Reverend Richard Coles, celebrity vicar and one half of 80s band The Communards.\n\nRichard Coles said \u201cI was honoured to be invited to host the Everyday Heroes awards again this year and had no doubt that I\u2019d hear another set of amazing stories \u2013 I certainly haven\u2019t been disappointed.\n\n\"The young people commended have really stood out and I believe the future of our communities is in good hands if they are anything to go by. I hope their stories will inspire many others to volunteer, learn new skills and be confident to help when it really matters.\u201d\n\nAs well as recognition for young people, Everyday Heroes also rewards the kindness of strangers, colleagues and St John volunteers in three other categories: Community Hero, Workplace Hero and Volunteer Hero.\n\nSt John Ambulance\u2019s Chief Executive, Martin Houghton-Brown congratulated all the award winners, saying: \u201cLast night I had the honour of celebrating with the truly incredible ordinary people whose moments of extraordinary heroism allow us to put their humanity, care and courage in the spotlight.\n\n\u201cMany of these are young people, who are the healthcare professionals and community leaders of the future, and their courage is just what our communities need and want. St John has been equipping people like this for 140 years and I am delighted that we can honour this long history with a celebration of our Everyday Heroes.\u201d\n\nYoung Hero\n\nWINNER Logan Chatfield \u2013 11-year-old Logan gave first aid to his Grandad who was having a heart attack, just one week after he learned how to do it at St John Ambulance Cadets.\n\nWINNER Jack and Gabriel Walker \u2013 brothers who went to the aid of a neighbour who had attempted suicide.
