Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s and Sen. Bernie Sanders-style socialized medicine.\n\nThe proposal empowers government bureaucrats to set the prices of the top 250 prescription medicines. If a manufacturer does not agree with this price or refuses to \u201cnegotiate,\u201d the government will hit it with a 75 percent excise tax on the gross sales of a drug from the previous year \u2014 not a 75 percent tax on profits, but a 75 percent tax on sales.\n\nThe pan would also impose foreign price controls on American drugs by forcing manufacturers to calibrate prices of lifesaving medicine to those of half-a-dozen nations from Australia to Germany.\n\nThe bill would impose a retroactive inflationary penalty for drugs covered under Medicare Parts B and D. This retroactivity (which goes back to 2016) is particularly egregious because it would punish manufacturers for past decisions made, the U.S. Constitution\u2019s prohibition on ex post facto laws be damned.\n\nThe Pelosi plan does not constitute a good-faith effort to negotiate lower prescription drug prices. Instead, the proposal represents a giant step toward government controlling the means of production within the pharmaceutical industry \u2014 a textbook example of state socialism.\n\nMedical innovation only exists because manufacturers are able to invest significant time and money in research and development. This is especially important to senior citizens, whose quality of life is often governed by access to lifesaving medicine.\n\nOn average, it takes more than a decade to bring a new drug to market. Of all the experimental drugs under development, 90 percent do not receive approval from the Food and Drug Administration and never come to market. In 2016 alone, American drug companies invested $90 billion for therapy research and development of drugs, more than three times the R&D money spent by the National Institutes of Health.\n\nThis process is inherently risky \u2014 more than 150 experimental Alzheimer\u2019s therapies have been tried over the past 20 years. Despite these challenges, American innovators continue striving toward a cure for Alzheimer\u2019s. This persistent search for a cure contributes significantly to the estimated $300 billion in annual costs associated with the disease.\n\nPrescription drugs comprise just 14 percent of health care spending. Hospital services comprise 30 percent of health care spending, and is growing at a faster rate than pharmaceutical care.\n\nThe United States is a world leader and accounts for almost 60 percent of medical innovation in the world.\n\nThis innovation means more lifesaving and life-preserving medicines, and contributes to a strong U.S. economy and supports high-paying jobs across the country.\n\nMrs. Pelosi\u2019s plan to impose punitive taxes, foreign price controls and retroactive penalties would cause research on drugs to fight Alzheimer\u2019s and other diseases to come to a screeching halt.\n\nMrs. Pelosi\u2019s plan helps achieve the left\u2019s real goal \u2014 complete government takeover of the nation\u2019s health care system. If Mrs. Pelosi and the left succeed in passing this bill, it will not be the last health care measure they pass that will dramatically increase spending and taxes, limit choice and access, and put control of personal decisions in the hands of bureaucrats. Over time, they will try to take employer-provided health care away from over 150 million Americans. The majority of House Democrats already support this step.\n\nSpeaker Pelosi\u2019s draft plan for prescription drugs is an unabashed attempt to impose greater government control on the health care system. The Pelosi plan will wreck scientific innovation and ultimately harm the people who rely today or tomorrow upon new drugs to save their lives and those of their loved ones.\n\n\u2022 Grover Norquist is the president of Americans for Tax Reform.
