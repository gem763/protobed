The research found that the average adult child living at home costs parents \u00a3414 a month \u2013 just under \u00a35,000 a year \u2013 in food, drink, bills and handouts.\n\nA study of 1,000 parents found that sons tend to stay at the family home until they are 26, when they finally rent their own place or get a foot on the property ladder. Daughters fly the nest at the average age of 22\n\nSome parents said they even dipped into their pension pot or worked extra hours to help pay for bills racked up by their adult kids.\n\nA spokesman for pensions firm Portafina, which conducted the study, said it was harder for youngsters to leave home because of high property prices, given that many were saving for a deposit.\n\nThe study also found that 20 per cent of parents refused to take any money from their children to help pay the bills.\n\nPortafina managing director Jamie Smith-Thompson said parents should be \u2018wary\u2019 of dipping into their pensions to subsidise their children.\n\nHe added: \u2018It\u2019s only natural for parents to have good intentions of helping adult children who remain in the family home.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve no doubt that children who are welcomed back home after university or who live at home while they save for a house deposit are thankful. Even if they don\u2019t always show it!\n\n\u2018Worryingly, some parents are working longer or altering their lifestyle to cover the extra costs.\n\n\u2018While pensions do offer more flexibility than ever\u2026 using the money to help family could leave you with less to live on when you need it. A parent withdrawing \u00a3200 a month from a pension pot between the age of 55 and 60\u2026 could be left nearly \u00a314,000 worse off compared to leaving the money invested in their pension.\u2019", "description": "A study of 1,000 parents found sons tend to stay at the family home until they are 26, when they finally rent their own place or get a foot on the property ladder.
