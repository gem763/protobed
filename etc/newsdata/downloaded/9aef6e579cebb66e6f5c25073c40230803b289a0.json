But in all three countries, significantly fewer were willing to do so if the currency were issued by Facebook than by a generic tech firm.\n\nTalking Point Consumers in emerging markets are significantly more willing to use money issued by a tech company than those in the U.S., according to a new paper from the Riwi Group and the FinHub at the University of Toronto\u2019s Rotman School of Management. But the survey found that Facebook has a serious image problem that could make its Libra currency less popular than offerings from its competitors.\n\nThe findings suggest that while there is a market for digital currencies like Facebook\u2019s Libra, which is scheduled to launch in the first half of 2020, suspicion of the social media giant may present an opportunity for competitors\u2014especially in developing economies.\n\nDanielle Goldfarb, Riwi\u2019s head of global research, said North American consumers are less eager to adopt tech firm-created currencies because they already have access to well-established financial and banking systems. \u201cWe experience fewer frictions in Canada and the U.S. \u2026 than people in emerging markets,\u201d she said, citing \u201clong-established legacy payment mechanisms like credit and debit cards.\u201d\n\nHowever, she said, \u201cthe test of the Libra project is really whether there\u2019s a demand in emerging markets.\u201d\n\nSince it was announced in June, Libra has been plagued by controversy. It will be governed by the Libra Association, a Geneva-based non-profit, which was supposed to include 28 founding members. Last week, however, all the major payment firms involved\u2014including Visa, Mastercard and PayPal\u2014dropped out following pressure from members of the Senate and the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s inquiries about the companies\u2019 respective anti-money-laundering practices.\n\nAs Libra Association members quit, \u201cincreasingly it looks like Facebook is still in charge, and it always was,\u201d Goldfarb said.\n\nThe association still aims to grow to about 100 members before Libra launches. The sole current Canadian participant is the Creative Destruction Lab, a startup incubator headquartered at Rotman and one of four founding \u201csocial impact partners.\u201d\n\nThere is a particular opportunity for digital currencies in emerging markets, where economic and political volatility can make new financial technologies like Libra more attractive to consumers, said Goldfarb, who co-authored the paper with Andreas Park, an associate professor at the University of Toronto Mississauga\u2019s management department. In India, mobile-wallet app downloads and transactions soared after the government suddenly removed high-value banknotes from circulation in November 2016, although some users have since gone back to cash.\n\n\u201cPlaces like Nigeria have basically skipped over this credit-card, debit-card period,\u201d said Goldfarb. \u201cThey\u2019re leapfrog economies, and they\u2019re really moving toward some of these newer payment systems.\u201d According to the World Bank, there were 4.1 credit cards per thousand adults in Nigeria in 2015, compared to 172.5 e-money accounts\u2014prepaid wallets, often offered through mobile services.\n\nCalibra, Facebook\u2019s new financial services division, is also building a mobile wallet that it will integrate with its Messenger service and its subsidiary WhatsApp to allow users to transfer money at lower rates and to make purchases within the apps. The firm is already working on payments infrastructure in emerging markets\u2014WhatsApp plans to launch a service in India by the end of 2019.\n\nA white paper published by the Libra Association cites high remittance fees as another problem the digital currency is supposed to address.\n\nThe study asked half of the participants whether they were willing to use money issued by a tech company, and the other half about a digital currency issued by Facebook specifically. In each of the three countries, the survey found fewer participants were willing to use the Facebook-issued coin. The company has a \u201cvery significant image problem,\u201d the report states.\n\nThe gap was largest in India. Facebook\u2019s reputation in the country remains damaged by its attempt to launch Internet.org, which gave users access to a limited number of apps and websites separate from their mobile-data allowances. The Indian government banned the service in February 2016. In the Riwi-Rotman survey, more Indian respondents listed dislike of Facebook as their main concern about using non-traditional money, rather than worries about data privacy; among Nigerian and American respondents that finding was reversed.\n\nOverall, consumers were most concerned about what the firms developing digital currencies would do with their personal information. Far fewer believed the coins would not retain their value, or that only governments should have the power to issue money.\n\nShare the full article! Send to a friend\n\nLoading... Thanks for sharing!

EU governments have expressed \u201cstrong concerns\u201d that digital currencies could undermine their sovereignty; in September, Calibra head David Marcus tweeted to clarify that Libra is not meant to replace national currencies after he faced questions from the representatives of 26 central banks.\n\nAcross all three countries in the study, \u201cthere\u2019s quite a bit of a backlash against Facebook,\u201d Goldfarb said. The authors found that was true even for respondents who already had a Facebook, Instagram and/or WhatsApp account\u2014they were 1.5 times more likely to be willing to use a currency issued by a generic tech company as users asked about one from Facebook.\n\n\u201cIf Facebook doesn\u2019t succeed, there still is demand that others could tap into for improvement to how global payments take place,\u201d said Goldfarb.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nMethodology:\n\nRiwi surveyed 5,068 respondents in India (3,040), Nigeria (1,200) and the U.S. (828). Half the respondents answered questions about whether they would pay for products and services with a Facebook-issued currency, and the other half about a currency from a technology company in general. The survey did not ask specifically about Libra because the \u201cname does not yet enjoy widespread awareness,\u201d the report states.\n\nParticipants were also asked which of four concerns about using such coins was their highest priority: data privacy; the money failing to keep its value; a dislike of Facebook or technology companies; and the idea that only governments should issue money.", "description": "Survey shows stronger demand in emerging markets than U.S. for non-traditional money", "authors": ["Murad Hemmadi"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/David_Marcus-Facebook_Calibra-P_Andrew_Harrer_Bloomberg-GettyImages-1156154775.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
