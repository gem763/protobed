But I can say one thing: Congress would sure be a helluva lot more fun if the U.S. adopted a couple of Parliament\u2019s traditions here.\n\nUpheaval in Parliament commanded global headlines the past few weeks as it wrestles with Brexit - arguably the greatest existential threat to the United Kingdom since World War II.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson fought with fellow conservatives and even banished a few from Parliament, including Winston Churchill\u2019s grandson. Retiring Speaker Jon Bercow has emerged as an internet sensation. I mean, could you imagine House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) bickering with her members the way Bercow does?\n\nOne wonders if Pelosi could verbally incinerate a heckling backbencher with a rhetorical projectile worthy of Bercow\u2019s sermons.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not remotely interested in your pettifogging objections!\u201d sneered Bercow from the Speaker\u2019s chair at one Member of Parliament (MP). \u201cI don\u2019t give a flying flamingo.\u201d\n\nTo the uninitiated, \u201cpettifogging\u201d is the act of placing undue emphasis on picayune details. And for the record, flamingos usually only fly at night. One also can\u2019t envision Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) telling Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) he doesn\u2019t \u201cgive a flying flamingo\u201d about his views on legislation. That said, Schumer did exclaim \u201cShame! Shame on him!\u201d the other day regarding McConnell. This came after McConnell characterized a Democratic press conference on gun violence with Dayton, OH Mayor Nan Whaley (D) as \u201ctheatrics.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Democratic party ought to tell its presidential contenders that the first candidate to dispatch one of their rivals with the \u201cflying flamingo\u201d retort at the next debate will claim the nomination by acclamation.\n\nThe British House of Commons, like most parliamentary assemblies around the world, have a mace. The mace is essentially a physical symbol of the power of each legislative body. In ancient Rome, the mace was a battle weapon. In the case of Great Britain, the mace is a five-foot silver rod, festooned with roses and stems winding around a crown at the top. It\u2019s believed the British mace dates back to King Charles II and the 17th Century. There was a dramatic moment late last year when one MP swiped the mace from its resting space in the chamber in an act of protest and bolted for the exit.\n\n\u201cOrder! Put it back! No, no!\u201d admonished Bercow.\n\nThe House of Representatives also has a mace kept in the office of Sergeant at Arms Paul Irving. It\u2019s nearly four feet tall and bound with silver strands. Only House officials ever handle the mace \u2013 and then, with white gloves to protect its integrity. House officials always escort the mace into the dais in the chamber when the body meets each day. But its not unheard of for the House to present the mace in front of a member if they get out of line. The last known instance came in 1994. House officials nearly brandished the mace in front of Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) after a verbal altercation on the floor.\n\nOne wonders if a House member here might ever consider trying to abscond with the mace the way the Labour MP did some months ago. It might not do much for parliamentary decorum. But it would certainly stir a fuss in Congress.\n\nNothing against the mace in the House of Representatives. But the House might consider upping its mace game and follow the lead of two Canadian maces. We\u2019re not even talking about a mace in Ottawa. Try Iqaluit, Nunavut, the most northerly territory in Canada, and, Edmonton, the provincial capital of Alberta.\n\nThe mace for the legislative assembly in Nunavut features a typical \u201ccrown\u201d on the top to respect the British monarch, a two-and-a-quarter carat diamond and even an insignia reminiscent of a fleur-de-lis. But the body of the mace is covered with narwhal tusk, jutting out from the sides like a weapon straight out of Game of Thrones.\n\nThe original mace in Alberta was a real piece of work \u2013 and an afterthought. When Alberta became a province in 1905, the assembly realized it lacked a mace. So they scrambled together to construct a homemade mace. Officials taped together a plumbing pipe, brass knobs from a bed, the handle of a shaving mug and, to top it all off, the round float from a toilet tank. Alberta used that mace for decades.\n\nBut without question, the most fascinating tradition in the British Parliament which Congress should appropriate is the role of the Black Rod.\n\nYes. There is an official from the House of Lords actually called the Black Rod.\n\nThe Black Rod sounds like an archvillain from \"The Avengers.\" Think the Green Goblin or the Red Skull. Perhaps Natasha Romanov can get involved somehow. After all, she\u2019s the Black Widow.\n\nAnyway, the Black Rod is kind of an \u201cusher\u201d who dresses like the character on a bottle of Johnnie Walker scotch. Kind of a British version of Colonel Sanders. The Black Rod carries, surprise, a rod. When Parliament meets, MP\u2019s deliberately slam the door in the face of the Black Rod. He or she then knocks three times on the Parliament door for admission. MP\u2019s shut the door to symbolize an independence of Parliament from the Monarch.\n\nAnd when Parliament ceases to meet, the Black Rod appears in the chamber to escort the the Speaker out of the chamber. Sarah Clarke currently serves as the Black Rod. Bercow didn\u2019t initially accompany Clarke out of the chamber this time, considering the strife in Parliament and the imbroglio over Brexit. But after firing off a few snide remarks from the Speaker\u2019s chair, Bercow finally stood down and Parliament was finished for a few weeks.\n\nNo one could imagine a Black Rod in the U.S. House escorting Pelosi anywhere.\n\nFor the record, when Congress finishes its session, it\u2019s said the House and Senate adjourn \u201csine die.\u201d That\u2019s Latin for \u201cwithout a future date.\u201d It\u2019s pronounced \u201csigh-nee-DY.\u201d When Parliament adjourns, such is the case now, it\u2019s called \u201cprorogation.\u201d That\u2019s alright. It\u2019s just as hard to pronounce as sine die.\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAdopting a few customs from other parliamentary systems would certainly make Congress a little more intriguing. Debate on the House and Senate floor is sometimes rather stale. Dialing things up a notch or two in the Bercow model would at least make it more amusing.\n\nAnd if you don\u2019t like the suggestions, I don\u2019t give a flying flamingo.", "description": "I don\u2019t claim to be an expert on parliamentary procedure and precedence in the British House of Commons.
