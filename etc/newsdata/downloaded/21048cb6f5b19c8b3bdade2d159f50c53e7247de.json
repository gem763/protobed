It is expected to make landfall again on Saturday in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia.\n\nLife-threatening storm surges and dangerous winds are still expected in Virginia and other north-eastern states.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Dorian continues to hit the Carolinas\n\nThree storm-related deaths have been reported in Florida and another in North Carolina. All four people died while preparing their homes and shelters for the storm.\n\nIt has also caused severe flooding and widespread power failures in Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina.\n\nIn the Carolinas, more than 900,000 people were ordered to evacuate their homes, but it was unclear how many had complied.\n\nForecasters said 10 inches (25 cm) of rain had fallen between the coasts of Charleston in South Carolina and Wilmington 170 miles away in North Carolina.\n\nWhat is the damage to the Bahamas?\n\nDorian hit the Bahamas as a category five hurricane with winds reaching 185mph (298km/h). It matched the highest ever recorded at landfall, and stayed over affected areas for two days.\n\nIn its wake, at least 70,000 Bahamians needed immediate humanitarian relief.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Great Abaco has been rendered virtually uninhabitable\n\nThe International Red Cross fears 45% of homes on Grand Bahama and the Abacos - some 13,000 properties - were severely damaged or destroyed.\n\nParts of the Bahamas received up to 35in (89cm) of rain, leaving vast areas of it flooded.\n\nThe Island of Great Abaco is virtually uninhabitable, with bodies piled up, no water, power or food, and militias formed to prevent looting, local media report.\n\n'Everything is gone'\n\nBy Matt Morrison in Abaco\n\nEveryone who experienced the storm here on Abaco has a story to tell. Whether it is one of dramatic survival, or the loss of a loved one, every life has been affected.\n\n'It was like being in a tornado for hours on end,' one Marsh Harbour resident told me. 'Everything is gone'.\n\nDriving down the streets one sees destruction in every direction. Homes and businesses have nearly all been levelled.\n\nThose that are left standing have broken windows and caved in walls. There is an eerie silence, as the few residents around survey the damage.\n\nAbout 5.5 miles off shore, Britain's Royal Fleet Auxiliary has stationed an aid ship, the Mounts Bay.\n\nThe 179-meter vessel had been in the area as the storm approached, and the scene onboard is one of urgency and focus. Aid is being loaded onto floating platforms to make the two-hour journey to shore.\n\nThe crew are on day three, and will continue here until they move on to the next disaster area.\n\nAerial images over the Abacos showed mile upon mile of destruction, with roofs torn off, scattered debris, overturned cars, shipping containers and boats, and high water levels.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Survivors of the hurricane say there is utter devastation\n\nThe only international airport in Grand Bahama was also devastated. As a result, it could not be used for evacuations or aid deliveries.\n\nFlood waters have reportedly rendered the Grand Bahamas' main hospital unusable, according to the Associated Press news agency.\n\nWhat is the latest on the aid effort?\n\nThe Bahamas' government has signed an emergency declaration giving tax exemptions to medicine, building supplies and other goods that can be used for relief efforts.\n\nInternational aid operations have been primarily focused on Grand Bahama and the Abacos, which were hit worst.\n\nSearch-and-rescue teams have been combing the worst-hit communities looking for any trace of survivors and bodies. As of Friday, the US Coast Guard said it had rescued 205 residents.\n\nInteractive Marsh Harbour, Great Abaco September 2019 October 2018\n\nMeanwhile, efforts to deliver aid are being ramped up. Planes and helicopters have been flying in emergency supplies to help the estimated 76,000 people in need of food and shelter.\n\nThe UK has committed $1.84m (\u00a31.5m) to fund aid being delivered by the Royal Navy vessel RFA Mounts Bay and help coordinate the wider aid effort.\n\nEight tonnes (8,000kg) of ready-to-eat meals, storage units, generators and other emergency suppliers are to be flown in from Panama, the UN World Food Programme said.\n\nA $5.4m (\u00a34.3m) budget has been allocated to the UN agency for a three-month emergency operation in the Bahamas.\n\nIs climate change making hurricanes worse?\n\nAccording to the NHC, a \"hurricane season\" runs in the Atlantic Ocean between 1 June and 30 November.\n\nThe term denotes a period when most of the year's tropical cyclones take place in the Atlantic, though it typically peaks in the late summer.\n\nScientists cannot say whether climate change is increasing the number of hurricanes, but the ones that do happen are likely to be more powerful and more destructive because of our warming climate, says BBC Weather's Tomasz Schafernaker.\n\nHere's why:\n\nAn increase in sea surface temperatures strengthens the wind speeds within storms and also raises the amount of precipitation a hurricane will dump\n\nSea levels are expected to increase by one to four feet over the next century, bringing the potential of far worse damage from sea surges and coastal flooding during storms\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Hurricanes and climate change\n\nUse our guide to see how these deadly storms form, their devastating effects and how they are measured:\n\nHurricanes A guide to the world's deadliest storms Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.\n\nWarm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. \"Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face.\"\n\nFlorida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017) The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.\n\nThis eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land.\n\nThese storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. \"Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye. MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!\"\n\nTweet from the National Hurricane Center The size of hurricanes is mainly measured by the Saffir-Simpson scale - other scales are used in Asia Pacific and Australia. Winds 119-153km/h\n\nSome minor flooding, little structural damage.\n\nStorm surge +1.2m-1.5m Winds 154-177km/h\n\nRoofs and trees could be damaged.\n\nStorm surge +1.8m-2.4m Winds 178-208km/h\n\nHouses suffer damage, severe flooding\n\nStorm surge +2.7m-3.7m Hurricane Sandy (2012) caused $71bn damage in the Caribbean and New York Winds 209-251km/h\n\nSome roofs destroyed and major structural damage to houses.\n\nStorm surge +4m-5.5m Hurricane Ike (2008) hit Caribbean islands and Louisiana and was blamed for at least 195 deaths Winds 252km/h+\n\nSerious damage to buildings, severe flooding further inland.\n\nStorm surge +5.5m Hurricane Irma (2017) caused devastation in Caribbean islands, leaving thousands homeless \"For everyone thinking they can ride this storm out, I have news for you: that will be one of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life.\"\n\nMayor of New Orleans Ray Nagin ahead of Hurricane Gustav, 2008 Click arrow to proceed Loading ...
