One of them is an architect and licensed general contractor, one has a successful painting business, and I\u2019m a chief financial officer with a CPA background. Plus, I had a lot of construction experience as a young man. I know you\u2019re not a big fan of business partnerships, but how do you feel about a family business like this?\n\nDan\n\nDear Dan,\n\nGoing into business with family isn\u2019t my big concern here. I\u2019ve said many times that partnerships are the only ships that won\u2019t sail, and I\u2019m a firm believer in that philosophy. I would encourage you guys to set up a situation where one of you is the owner, then figure out a plan where the other guys get paid off the bottom line\u2014as if they were owners. Trust me, anything with three heads is going to end up being a monster at some point.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing about family businesses. When everyone understands their role and has the best interest of the company in mind, family businesses can be a lot more fun and more successful than non-family businesses. Statistics show the average family business lasts 60 years, while the average publicly-traded company lasts about 15 years.\n\nSo, there\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with the family part of the equation. It\u2019s the partnership aspect I\u2019d stay away from.\n\n\u2014Dave", "description": "Dear Dave,My two brothers-in-law and I have been thinking about .10/02/2019 13:04:45PM EST.", "authors": ["Dave Ramsey", "Katie Pavlich", "Cortney O'Brien", "Julio Rosas", "Guy Benson", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png"}
