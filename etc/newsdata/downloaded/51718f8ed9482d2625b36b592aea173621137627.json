Photo: Courtesy of the retailer\n\nSeptember has been a big month for stripes here at the Strategist. As senior editor Simone Kitchens (who wrote about her new stripes in the latest edition of the Strategist Haul) noted, we went deep both in print and online on the pattern\u2019s enduring appeal. Today, we close out the month by going even deeper \u2014 specifically, into the bowels of J.Crew\u2019s website, where a bunch of striped tees for women, men, and kids are up to 63 percent off amid the retailer\u2019s 5 Days of Deals Event (during which certain new items are 30 percent off, and other on-sale items are eligible for an additional 30 percent off). The striped T-shirts we found deals on today include versatile long-sleeved styles that would look great on their own or under a fall jacket or cardigan, as well as some short-sleeved tees you can layer much the same way (anyone who lives or works in a space where you can\u2019t control the heat knows short sleeves can be necessary even in winter). Note: Some of the shirts require entering the code MONDAY at checkout to get the full discount; we\u2019ve noted exactly which on the list below. And because J.Crew promises new things for each Day of Deals, we think these prices won\u2019t last long and suggest acting fast on anything you like (some styles already are not stocked in full sizes).\n\nWomen\u2019s\n\nPerfect Fit Turtleneck in Navy/Ivory Stripe $30 (was $43, now 30% off) $30 at J.Crew Buy with code: MONDAY\n\nJ.Crew Essential T-shirt in Venice Stripe Shale Blue $11 (was $20, now 45% off) $11 at J.Crew Buy\n\nJ.Crew 365 Stretch Long-Sleeved T-shirt in Stripe $28 (was $40, now 30% off) $28 at J.Crew Buy with code: MONDAY\n\nSlim Perfect Long-Sleeved T-shirt in Phoebe Stripe $28 (was $40, now 30% off) $28 at J.Crew Buy with code: MONDAY\n\nMen\u2019s\n\nEssential Crewneck T-shirt in Blue Stripe $14 (was $30, now 53% off) $14 at J.Crew Buy with code: MONDAY\n\nEssential Long-Sleeved T-shirt in Deck Stripe $24 (was $35, now 31% off) $24 at J.Crew Buy with code: MONDAY\n\nEssential Crewneck T-shirt in Thin Stripe $14 (was $25, now 44% off) $14 at J.Crew Buy with code: MONDAY\n\nKids\n\nKids' Pocket T-shirt in Aqua Stripe $15 (was $37, now 59% off) $15 at J.Crew Buy with code: MONDAY\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
