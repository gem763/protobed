That every institution we uphold has racist roots that are sometimes difficult to catch and even harder to fight against. This phenomenon affects our voter ID laws, state testing and, yes, even our federal dietary guidelines. But how can our health guidelines, a system meant to be built upon scientific fact alone, have racist messages? Where there is a deep-rooted tradition to suppress an entire race\u2019s existence, there\u2019s a way.\u201d\n\nAnd yes, it all comes down to milk.\n\n\u201cThe federal endorsement of milk in American diets contributes to the problem by uncritically pushing people to drink milk, despite the potential detriment it has on non-white people\u2019s health,\u201d Ms. Diaz wrote. \u201cOur current federal dietary guidelines urge people to drink three cups of milk a day, according to the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The main health benefit of milk is to guard against osteoporosis, a disease that weakens your bones \u2014 hence the \u2018stronger bones\u2019 rhetoric. While this is a very practical health benefit, osteoporosis affects Africans at a significantly lower rate than it does most Americans.\u201d\n\nThereby, milk may do a white person\u2019s body good, but it doesn\u2019t a black body, thereby it\u2019s racist.\n\nIf you think Ms. Diaz analysis comes out of left field, you\u2019d be wrong. Last month, online news publication Mic.com wrote an article titled: \u201cMilk is the new, creamy symbol of white racial purity in Donald Trump\u2019s America.\u201d\n\nWhy you may ask?\n\nWell, because an anti-Trump installation at the Museum of the Moving Image in New York City featured a live-stream of neo-Nazis drinking milk by the gallon.\n\n\u201cAmid all the tattoos of Third Reich iconography bouncing around, one thing stood out: The neo-Nazis were all drinking milk,\u201d Mic wrote. \u201cThey spat it out as they danced, letting it dribble down their chins.\u201d\n\nIt continued: \u201cSome white supremacists think white ethnic identity has a geographic, historical correlation with the body\u2019s tolerance for milk \u2014 specifically, the production of the lactase enzyme that allows humans to break down lactose.\n\nOn 4chan, the internet\u2019s hate speech hit factory, one anonymous poster laid this thesis out using the following graphic from a study in Nature, showing hotspots of where certain populations have higher milk tolerances,\u201d the online magazine reported.\n\nOh wow.\n\nBut left-leaning news organizations are leaning in on this argument.\n\nLast year, Mother Jones contemplated whether the U.S. dietary guidelines on milk were racist, concluding: \u201cThe medical community has yet to frame its questions in ways that investigate whether foods that have been culturally labeled as \u2018good for you\u2019 have deleterious consequences for minorities.\u201d\n\nAnd this month, in an interview with the Los Angeles Times, \u201cGet Out\u201d director Jordan Peele explained the link between milk and hate, and how he depicted it in his movie on racial bigotry in the modern age.\n\nIn the scene, an actress sits in her bedroom, with her headphones on listening to the theme from \u201cDirty Dancing,\u201d snacking on Fruit Loops and drinking milk through a straw.\n\nAs the Times explains: \u201cMilk, it has been argued of late, is the new symbol of white supremacy in America, owing to its hue and the notion that lactose intolerance in certain ethnicities means that milk-absorbing Caucasian genetics are superior.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something kind of horrific about milk,\u201d Mr. Peele told the Times. \u201cThink about it! Think about what we\u2019re doing. Milk is kind of gross.\u201d\n\nSo there you have it. Got Milk? Then you\u2019re probably a Nazi.
