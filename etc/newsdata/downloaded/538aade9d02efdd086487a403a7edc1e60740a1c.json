I don\u2019t believe it! I\u2019m crying and laughing! Oh my god!\u201d he said through tears.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t believe it! I\u2019m speechless. I can\u2019t believe this has happened to me.\u201d\n\nmedia_camera The Sydney man is now $50 million richer.\n\nThe winning numbers in Oz Lotto draw 1339 were 5, 32, 22, 13, 20, 25 and 42, while the supplementary numbers were 21 and 23.\n\nHe said he was at work when he googled the winning numbers and saw they matched with his own.\n\n\u201cI still wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d won, so I called my daughter and asked her to check the numbers and she said to me \u2018oh my god dad, I think you\u2019ve won!\u2019,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs soon as she said that I just walked out from work. I didn\u2019t say anything. I was just thinking \u2018oh my god\u2019.\n\n\u201cI just can\u2019t believe this. I need to go home, have a sit down and just calm down.\n\n\u201cGosh I have a good life!\u201d\n\nAlong with helping out his friends and family, the winner said he wanted to retire and spend his days fishing.\n\n\u201cThis is just so much money. I want to help all of my family, my wife\u2019s family and my friends,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI am definitely not going to work. I want to buy a house by the beach and spend all my days fishing and golfing.\n\n\u201cBut money is not everything to me. My friends and family mean more to me than money, so I want to use it wisely and I want to share it with them.\u201d\n\nThe winning ticket was bought from Leumeah Newsagency, with the shop owner, Ben Van Cao, saying he was ecstatic the winner had come forward.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fantastic news and we\u2019re very happy. This is a small community. We look after them and they look after us\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt means a lot for a big prize like this to land in our community. People here work hard and they deserve to win.\n\n\u201cIt has been such a busy day as everyone has been coming in to check their tickets, hoping it was them. It has been a while since we\u2019ve sold a division one winning entry, so we did feel we were overdue. What an amazing winning ticket to sell!\n\n\u201cWe wish our winner all the very best with their prize. Congratulations!\u201d\n\nThis is the 10th division one winning entry in Oz Lotto so far this year.
