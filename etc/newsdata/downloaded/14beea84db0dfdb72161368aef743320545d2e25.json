The mother's insistence on the alternative, unproven treatment has whipped up a storm of controversy.\n\n'On the other hand, information coming from social media can be very inspiring. We do much better when we have a social support for what we\u2019re doing, and social media can be very motivating,' said Dr Hyman.\n\nAmong those who'd found wellness inspiration on social media, 18 percent had changed up their fitness regimen.\n\nAnother 18 percent had tried a new diet or changed the diet they were on.\n\nThe trendiest diets were intermittent fasting, tried out by 36 percent of those who tried online-inspired changes, followed by plant-based diet and the Keto diet praised by celebrities like Kim Kardashian West and LeBron James, but panned by many doctors.\n\nEncouragingly, cutting the amount of sugar they ate - a move well-demonstrated to help lower obesity, diabetes and heart disease risks - was a top dietary priority for 72 percent of respondents.\n\nThe study also found that Americans are more than open to virtual medicine, with 22 percent saying the would gladly consult a doctor via video chat.\n\nThe findings could signal an opportunity for more health care professionals to jump into the influencer mix and give their patients access to vetted health information on the platforms they already trust.", "description": "Americans spend far more time on their smart phones than in doctors' offices and often try new natural remedies, diets and workouts from social media, a Cleveland Clinic and Parade sujrvey found.", "authors": ["Natalie Rahhal Deputy Health Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/15/19590282-0-image-a-3_1570804954686.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
