(AP) - Addison Shoup\u2019s 36-yard touchdown scramble to open the fourth quarter staked Lehigh to a 10-3 win over Merrimack on Saturday, breaking a 3-game losing streak.\n\nThe Mountain Hawks (1-3) survived four turnovers, all interceptions, gained just 75 yards on the ground and were outgained 303-280 in total offense.\n\nMerrimack (2-3), a Division II school transitioning to D-I and membership in the Northeast Conference, took a 3-0 lead into halftime only to be held to four punts in the third quarter while Lehigh fought back. The Mountain Hawks tied the game 3-3 on Austin Henning\u2019s 40-yard field goal, salvaging a drive that went seven yards in reverse after Shoup was sacked.\n\nThe came Shoup\u2019s game-winning scramble. He escaped a collapsing pocket and sprinted toward the left sideline, picked up a key block from Alex Snyder at the 20 and ran untouched to the end zone.\n\nMerrimack had one final chance, driving to a first down at the Lehigh 22, but turned the ball over on downs with less than a minute to play.\n\n_____\n\nhttps://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Addison Shoup's 36-yard touchdown scramble to open the fourth quarter staked Lehigh to a 10-3 win over Merrimack on Saturday, breaking a 3-game losing streak.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
