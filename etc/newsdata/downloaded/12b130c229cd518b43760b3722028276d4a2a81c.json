Get the news out on the telegraph wire, Mabel.\n\n\n\nBack then, before the forward pass had been popularized, the quartet of 6-0 teams was Minnesota, Michigan, Illinois and Chicago, the last of which would bail on the Big Ten and big-time football 35 years later. Today, the roster of 6-0 teams is Ohio State, Penn State, Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s great for the league to have three teams in the Top 10 (the Buckeyes, Badgers and Nittany Lions). It\u2019s easier to push undefeated teams for College Football Playoff consideration than teams that take turns beating each other. It\u2019s also nice to have a rising program (the Gophers) off to its best start since 2003, and one win away from its best start since 1960.\n\n\n\nBut what about the other 10 members of the richest league in college football? How are they doing?\n\n\n\nNine of them are simmering caldrons of anger, and one is levitating between pleased and apathetic. Even with four unbeatens at this advanced stage of the season, crabbiness is outpacing happiness by a long way.\n\nMichigan Wolverines head coach Jim Harbaugh before the game against the Iowa Hawkeyes at Michigan Stadium. (USA Today)\n\nHow unbalanced has the Big Ten become this season? Take a look at the point spreads for this week\u2019s games involving unbeaten teams:\n\n\n\nOhio State is a 28-point road favorite at Northwestern on Friday night.\n\n\n\nWisconsin is a 31-point road favorite at Illinois.\n\n\n\nMinnesota is a 28.5-point road favorite at Rutgers.\n\n\n\nEven in the game of the week, Michigan at Penn State, the Nittany Lions are nine-point favorites.\n\n\n\nLas Vegas doesn\u2019t see a lot of competitiveness in those contests. Nor when Iowa hosts Purdue as a 17.5-point favorite. The only spread that is less than a touchdown is Indiana favored by 5.5 at Maryland.\n\n\n\nThe Buckeyes have won every Big Ten game by at least 24 points, with an average winning margin of 35.3 points. The Nittany Lions\u2019 average winning margin in league games is 30.7, Badgers\u2019 is 22.7 and the Gophers\u2019 is 19.\n\n\n\nMaybe the top of the league is simply that good. But it seems every bit as likely that the middle and bottom is simply that bad.\n\n\n\nA quick look at the various stages of discontent beneath the Big Four:\n\n\n\n\u2022 Bewilderment over the hero alum\u2019s lack of progress. At Michigan, they were expecting much more from Jim Harbaugh by now. At Nebraska, the same can be said about Scott Frost, albeit with a smaller body of work. Both were hired amid great fanfare and at high salaries after success elsewhere, beckoned home to restore a traditional power to prominence. Specifically, both Michigan and Nebraska were trying to dial back the clock to 1997, when they shared a national championship \u2014 the last one either team won.\n\n\n\nHarbaugh has won 74 percent of his games \u2014 but zero percent of his games against Ohio State, and barely better than that against other high-level opponents. Frost is 8-11 since arriving in Lincoln last year, likely extending the expected timeline of his rebuild by at least a full season \u2014 if not indefinitely.\n\n\n\nScores of their games against the Big Four: Wisconsin 35, Michigan 14; Ohio State 48, Nebraska 7; Minnesota 34, Nebraska 7. (The last of those scores is especially sobering when you consider that the Cornhuskers blasted the Gophers by 25 last season.)\n\n\n\n\u2022 Fatigue with the status quo. Three schools are led by the winningest coaches in program history, all of whom are mired in an offensive malaise that is dragging down their teams. Kirk Ferentz at Iowa, Mark Dantonio at Michigan State and Pat Fitzgerald at Northwestern are a combined 3-7 in league play, while presiding over the Nos. 94, 98 and 128 scoring offenses in the nation, respectively.\n\n\n\nIn the big picture, all three head coaches have earned the benefit of the doubt \u2014 but the doubts are gaining strength here in 2019. They are proud, loyal and stubborn, aligning themselves with longtime assistants and basically daring anyone to call them on it.\n\n\n\nFitzgerald has had the same offensive coordinator, Mick McCall, for 12 years now. Last year, with a four-year starting quarterback, the Wildcats were 124th nationally in yards per play. This year, they\u2019re 130th and dead last, and their lone victory is over UNLV. They have not ranked higher than 84th in yards per play since 2011. The Fitz formula has worked well for a long time \u2014 but why not try to energize the offense and aim even higher? Why not try to reach the level where Notre Dame currently operates, and where Stanford did for several seasons earlier this decade?\n\n\n\nDantonio infamously refused to fire staff members after last year\u2019s 7-6 season, in which the Spartans fielded the No. 117 offense in the nation. He tinkered instead of overhauled, and the results reflect that: a 4-3 record, with successive embarrassing blowouts against Ohio State and Wisconsin. If Dantonio attempts a similar Nobody Tells Me What To Do stance after this season, he may lose a fan base that once idolized him.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nStory continues\n\nMichigan State Spartans head coach Mark Dantonio stands on the field during the second half of a game against the Western Michigan Broncos. (USAT)\n\nWhen Iowa offensive coordinator Greg Davis retired in 2016, Ferentz kept the job in the family. Quite literally. He promoted his son Brian, who had played for and coached under his dad. Brian Ferentz wasn\u2019t exactly a nepotism hire, having been part of Bill Belichick\u2019s staff at New England for four seasons before coming back to Iowa City in 2012. But when the offense flails as badly as Iowa\u2019s did the past two games against Michigan and Penn State, producing a total of 15 points, a coordinator with a different last name might be feeling some heat. If Iowa continues to struggle on that side of the ball, would anything change? Probably not.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Dead coach walking. That would seem to be Lovie Smith at Illinois, an outside-the-box hire in 2016 who hasn\u2019t improved the product. Per the Champaign News-Gazette, Smith has the fewest wins (11) and most losses (31) of any still-employed FBS coach who came aboard during the 2015-16 hiring cycle.\n\n\n\nAthletic director Josh Whitman mouthed some non-committal support for Smith during a radio appearance Monday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got half the season left to play, and we\u2019ve still got an opportunity to write a pretty significant chapter for Illinois football here, and we need everybody to be a part of it,\u201d Whitman said. \u201cMy plan is to stand behind them and give them everything I\u2019ve got to get them going, and I hope all of our fans will do the same thing.\u201d\n\n\n\nPlans can change if the wins don\u2019t come.\n\n\n\n\u2022 The injury mulligan. Purdue was 1-4 before ambushing Maryland on Saturday, with a plague of injuries playing a major role in that. But even before the roster fell apart, the Boilermakers started the season by blowing a game at Nevada, a stunning loss that quickly undercut the excitement of keeping coach Jeff Brohm from bolting for Louisville last winter.\n\n\n\nIf this season doesn\u2019t improve, it can be chalked up as a do-over \u2014 especially with several recruiting victories increasing optimism in the direction of the program. But eventually Purdue is going to expect a breakthrough season for the $5 million it is paying Brohm annually.\n\n\n\n\u2022 The false euphoria. Maryland coach Mike Locksley began his tenure 2-0, with a preposterous scoring margin of 142-20. Since then he is 1-3, with the only victory over the worst Power Five team in America (which we will get to). Getting blasted by injury-depleted Purdue was the worst sign yet, and it\u2019s possible the Terrapins won\u2019t be favored in another game this season.\n\n\n\n\u2022 The basketball school. Indiana is 4-2, with a schedule that holds out a flicker of hope for its first eight-win season since 1993. Will anyone notice once the Hoosiers open hoops season on Nov. 5?\n\n\n\n\u2022 The hopeless case. This is Rutgers, the previously mentioned worst Power Five team in the land. The Scarlet Knights have already fired their coach, the useless Chris Ash, but the season shows every sign that it will only get worse. They\u2019re already being outscored by 24.2 points per game, they\u2019ve been shut out in three of four league games, and they haven\u2019t even played Minnesota, Ohio State or Penn State yet.\n\n\n\nSo go ahead and enjoy the once-a-century rarity of having four 6-0 teams, Big Ten. But for every fan base that is giddy over the way the season has started, two more fan bases are appalled.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "If you\u2019re wondering the last time the Big Ten standings looked like they do right now at the top, you have to stretch back more than a century.", "authors": ["Pat Forde"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/JnbKAu1GFbHXb6oHIj86GA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/qBm4glEtlS37FIsX.Rfisg--~B/aD0zNzQ1O3c9NTYxNztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/c10dc1a0-e78d-11e9-b8df-ec39a570770a", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
