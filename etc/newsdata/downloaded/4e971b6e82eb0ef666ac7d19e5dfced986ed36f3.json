It follows the launch of new designs for the 10, 20, 50, 200 and 1,000 franc notes over the past three years.\n\nJordan said he did not think the latest bank note series - Switzerland's ninth - would be the country's last despite the rising popularity of alternative payment methods.\n\n\"We are in the middle of technological changes and it is very difficult to look into the future,\" Jordan told a news conference. But he added:\n\n\"The reason why we still have cash is still there, it is a very useful means of payment. It is detached from other infrastructure and functions even if electricity does not work.\"\n\nThe 100, 200 and 1,000 franc notes are potentially affected by hoarding, according to an SNB study. Between 8% and 16% of the 100 franc notes are used for hoarding by people wishing to avoid negative rates charged by the central bank to ward off interest in the franc.\n\nJordan said the SNB had not noticed a \"significant\" change in demand for cash since the bank introduced negative rates.\n\n\"There has been a certain increase but not a radical shift in demand,\" he said, citing the costs of keeping physical money safe.
