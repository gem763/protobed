If we're going to have a night out, it alleviates that feeling because sometimes you do need to go out and spend time with each other.'\n\nOpen: The singer said that despite the guilt she finds that working makes her a 'better mum' as she stunned in a feminine shoot for the publication\n\nTogether: Sophie has been married to husband Richard Jones since 2005, and they have five sons together\n\nSpeaking about juggling life as a working mum, Sophie said: ''A lot of working mums end up trying to be all things to all people. In our house, if I say I'm working, at least two of the kids get really cross with me, like, ''Why don't you tell them you can't sing?'' I say, 'You have to stop punishing me for what I do. I love what I do.''\n\n'I don't want to make it about money. I say it's good for feeling purposeful, for giving me something I love to do. Working definitely makes me a better mum.'\n\nAs well as her youngest son Mickey, nine months, Sophie is also mum to Sonny, 14, Kit, nine, Ray, six, and Jesse, two.\n\nSince becoming a mum again, Sophie joked that little Mickey has become the 'mascot' for the family, saying: 'Mickey\u2019s like our family mascot. He just sits there in his highchair, grateful whenever anyone makes eye contact.\n\n'But now he\u2019s nine months, and I\u2019m back to work properly and not always bringing him with me everywhere, it\u2019s like, ''Okay, logistics.'' But, it\u2019s doable. It\u2019s fine. We\u2019ll make it fine. He\u2019s here now.'\n\nStunning: Sophie explained that since giving birth to her fifth child Mickey in January, the tot has become the 'family mascot'\n\nAhead of the festive season, Sophie also said that Christmas is nothing short of chaotic in her household, with all manner of family members coming to her home for the annual occasion.\n\nShe said: 'It\u2019s big! A big family thing, usually held at our house. My mum, stepdad, brother, sister, brother\u2019s girlfriend, Richard\u2019s folks, his brother, they all come to us.\n\n'And some stragglers, too. We always do a conga around the house, chanting, ''Here comes the Christmas pudding,'' to the tune of For He\u2019s A Jolly-Good Fellow.'\n\nThe December issue of Red is on sale from 30th October\n\nSophie also reflected on her illustrious music career during the interview, saying: 'I thought, when I was in my first band, that I was just going to have a good story to tell my kids, you know, ''Oh, I was once in a band.''\n\n'I never thought I'd be lucky enough to maintain a long career because if I'd learned anything by the time I was 20, it's that you don't always have a say in what goes on!'\n\n'Not long after I signed my solo deal, I was working with [Blur bass player] Alex James, who I did some writing with, and I remember him saying that no one's career is a straight trajectory up, it's always peaks and troughs.\n\n'It was such a good thing to hear. It allowed me to not lose my head when things didn't go as I wanted.'\n\nThe December issue of Red is on sale from 30th October.", "description": "Sophie Ellis-Bextor has revealed she struggles with 'guilt' as she struggles to find time for her marriage to husband Richard.", "authors": ["Laura Fox For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/18/20342152-0-image-a-9_1572375265482.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
