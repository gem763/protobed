REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke\n\nFRANKFURT (Reuters) - Daimler is hiring computer programmers to create games that encourage electric and hybrid vehicle owners to drive more efficiently, the company\u2019s research chief Markus Schaefer said on Tuesday.\n\nMercedes vehicles have enough graphics processing power from their use of stereo cameras to also power sophisticated graphics, he said at the Frankfurt autoshow.\n\n\u201cWe have lots of employees from the gaming industry working on user interfaces,\u201d Schaefer said. \u201cThe key task is to bring about a change in consumer behavior.\u201d\n\nSchaefer added that Mercedes can now engage drivers with a graphics-based scoring system based on how efficiently they brake and accelerate.\n\nThe Mercedes interface displays a floating ball that needs to be kept within a circle. Aggressive acceleration results in the ball moving off target and a lower score.\n\n\u201cOur Asian clients love these gaming aspects,\u201d Schaefer said.", "description": "Daimler is hiring computer programmers to create games that encourage electric and hybrid vehicle owners to drive more efficiently, the company's research chief Markus Schaefer said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428311209&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8912Q", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
