The deployment came after Palestinians in Gaza started launching incendiary balloons and kites over the border fence, causing fires in southern Israel.\n\nThe IDF portrayed the move as precautionary after a ceasefire with Hamas had been agreed to on Saturday, July 14. However, that ceasefire did not hold, with skirmishes continuing and escalating further on July 20.\n\nAccording to left-leaning Israeli daily, Haaretz, almost 200 such projectiles had been fired into Israel before the now-failed ceasefire was reached on Saturday night. The report added that \u201ca number of rockets\u201d were fired from Gaza in the early hours of Sunday and some Palestinians continued launching the \u201cairborne firebombs\u201d later that day.\n\n\u201cYesterday\u2019s attack was not strong relative to the Air Force\u2019s capabilities,\u201d a senior Israeli Air Force official told Haaretz of the retaliation on Saturday.\n\nStill, the same official warned: \u201cWe have prepared a large number of targets that will surprise Hamas, targets such as terror tunnels, the Beit Lahia battalion in which we attacked some 20 buildings and a multi-story building in the center of the Gaza Strip that served Hamas as a training facility with a tunnel underneath it.\u201d\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Israel lives in a dangerous neighborhood.", "authors": ["Zachary Keck"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/i6HKK8OXnzhd8Kf7zTloDg--~B/aD05ODE7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/d8981a256c8a4f9fb5be2aa92722f51e", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
