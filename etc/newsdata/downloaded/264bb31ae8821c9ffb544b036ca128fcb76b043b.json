It\u2019s an iconic scene you might know \u2014 the blood rave from Blade. \u201cIt\u2019s a track from my first album,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a very aggressive breakbeat track, and it plays when all that blood comes out of the ceiling.\u201d The track worked so well, that he \u201creally got interested in pursuing [movie scoring] myself.\u201d\n\nEven if you\u2019re not familiar with the name Tom Holkenborg, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ve heard his music. He\u2019s a Hollywood go-to for blockbuster action flicks, composing the scores for Deadpool, Mad Max: Fury Road, Tomb Raider, Mortal Engines, and Alita: Battle Angel, among others. Now, he\u2019s working on scoring the upcoming film Terminator: Dark Fate. Holkenborg\u2019s style is a complete departure from the golden era of orchestral film scores, combining everything from hardware analog synths, digital workstations, and classic amps to Frankensteined homemade instruments and the twinkling rainbow of Eurorack modules that fill an entire wall of his studio.\n\nSure, he also works with orchestras, but he\u2019s not bound by their traditional sound. He can also make, as he describes the sounds of Deadpool, \u201cFrankie Goes to Hollywood and Miami Vice, but then on acid.\u201d\n\nHe describes the \u2018Deadpool\u2019 score as \u201cFrankie Goes to Hollywood and \u2018Miami Vice,\u2019 but then on acid.\u201d\n\nWalking through Holkenborg\u2019s home in Los Angeles is like touring a Smithsonian collection. There\u2019s a room stacked with drool-worthy synths, like an ARP 2600 clone, which he used for the dark, wobbled timbres of Deadpool. Classic amps line the living room hallways, including a set by Orange used to grunge up the flame-throwing electric guitar in Mad Max: Fury Road. A garage is filled to the ceiling with all sorts of hand drums, including a custom-built set used for Tomb Raider to get very specific sounds from various parts of the Pacific. Then, of course, there are hundreds of analog and semi-analog modules surrounding us in his main studio, which get swapped out on a regular basis when new toys are delivered. He hasn\u2019t thrown out a single item since he started collecting in the \u201880s.\n\nFor decades, directors relied on orchestras and big bands to provide a film\u2019s musical drama. But that\u2019s been shaken up as things like synthesizers, soundtracks, and music production software have come into play. Some films still go with an orchestra, but Holkenborg says they\u2019re being used less and less in favor of a hybrid of methods. \u201cFor a lot of people,\u201d he says, \u201cthey feel that the orchestra sounds old-fashioned and therefore not applicable to a certain type of film score.\u201d\n\nHolkenborg represents a new generation of film composers who can kind of do it all. He\u2019s as comfortable patching together old analog gear as he is with sound design, computers, playing multiple instruments, creating effects, and writing traditional arrangements. He has scored movies in weeks, although he admits that kind of time crunch is not ideal. And it makes him as adept at making the extreme, ominous tones of 300: Rise of an Empire as he is at crafting the delicate, uplifting strings in Alita: Battle Angel. A composer in 1960 wouldn\u2019t have this array of knowledge, and now Holkenborg is rewriting the rules.\n\nHolkenborg represents a new generation of film composers who can kind of do it all\n\nHis style comes down to the fact that he loves to make music with his hands. \u201cThe physical aspect is very important,\u201d he says, gesturing to the cables and knobs and strings around us. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons why this room and all the other rooms where I work look more like a music sandbox where kids love to play for hours on end than a very stylistic, clean, writing, scoring environment with just a piano and a paper and a pencil.\u201d\n\nAlthough he\u2019s now known for movies, Holkenborg rose to fame under the moniker Junkie XL in the \u201890s and \u201800s. He was a mainstay in the electronic music scene, performing across the globe and releasing chart-topping hits, including a remix of Elvis Presley\u2019s 1968 single \u201cA Little Less Conversation.\u201d He credits this background in dance music with his ability to be a bit more 360 in the studio. It gave him a predilection for experimenting with twisting and chopping up sounds, making his scores immediately stand apart from the current landscape.\n\nWe walk into a room with one of his altered creations: it\u2019s an upended piano with the wood hacked away, exposing the wires inside. He slaps on the ropes of spring steel, and it lets out a thunderous, unsettling boom. It\u2019s the same sound that can be heard throughout 300: Rise of an Empire, and Holkenborg calls this thing the \u201cpiano from hell.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe picture is now in flux until the very, very last day.\u201d\n\nHolkenborg might be extreme with his obsessive curiosity, but overall, he notes DIY is a trend that\u2019s accelerating with newer people getting into scoring. DJ Le Castle Vania has scored for two John Wick movies, and DJ Kill The Noise has scored for movies like Captive State and XXX: Return of Xander Cage. Both created the electronic tracks in these films without the help of orchestras or big, professional studios. \u201cThat\u2019s the benefit of the younger, newer composers that get into this business,\u201d he says. \u201cThe younger the people get, the more they do themselves.\u201d\n\nDIY doesn\u2019t mean fewer people are involved in a film\u2019s score. \u201cI would say it has gone up,\u201d he counters. Holkenborg has a small horde of assistants that help find instruments, record samples, or pull up project files. And he still deals with orchestras, which can have upward of 150 musicians.\n\nIt all sounds daunting, and Holkenborg knows this. To help others learn about the new landscape of movie composition, he runs a YouTube channel filled with tutorials and \u201cask me anything\u201d sessions. He also runs a program called SCORE Academy that admits two students a year and teaches them how to become a film composer for free. \u201cI strongly believe,\u201d he says, \u201cthat it\u2019s critical to a society that the information of things like science and music theory and tricks and tips that people have found out to do certain things should actually flow more freely.\u201d\n\nComputers have both made things easier and more time-consuming for composers like Holkenborg. \u201cMore things can go wrong,\u201d he explains. \u201cSo now you need technicians that help you keep these computers straight. You need more assistance because the picture is now in flux until the very, very last day.\u201d\n\nMovies used to be finished months ahead of their release date and then handed to a composer to work on music. But the advent of digital in both film and audio now means things can be tweaked or completely changed right up until a few days before a movie hits theaters. Holkenborg says it\u2019s not uncommon to have to write multiple scores for different endings or be \u201csubjected to dramatic changes in the cut that you thought yesterday were staying in permanently.\u201d\n\nDIY is a trend with newer people getting into movie scoring\n\nOn the upside, this fluidity means there can be more of a collaborative relationship between director and composer. Holkenborg recalls an emotionally charged scene from Mad Max: Fury Road where Furiosa finds out the Green Place no longer exists. The orchestra asked to play it slower than what Holkenborg intended, and director George Miller liked the result so much he re-cut the scene to make it line up with the recording. In the past, these back-and-forth edits would have been impossible.\n\nHolkenborg\u2019s fascination with combining electronic elements and organic elements, old music and new, is not only his signature flair, but it\u2019s a view into the open future of movie scores. \u201cIf you say, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m going to combine \u201850s orchestral music with heavy metal stoner rock and 20 blaring drums,\u2019\u201d he grins, \u201cpeople look at you like, \u2018That\u2019s impossible.\u2019 But that became the Mad Max: Fury Road score.\u201d\n\nMake sure to check out other episodes of The Future of Music here.", "description": "In the second episode of The Future of Music season 2, Dani Deahl visits the studio of top latin pop producers Mauricio Rengifo and Andr\u00e9s Torres, most famous for their hit Despacito, to see how they make and use samples to create music.", "authors": ["Dani Deahl", "Aug"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XvJjacDwETK1RR0x4_44KHKpCYw=/0x38:1920x1043/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19120588/Grabs.00_03_39_04.Still003.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-27"}
