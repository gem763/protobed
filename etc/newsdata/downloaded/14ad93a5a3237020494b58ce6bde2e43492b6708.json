Hurwitz said. \"You lose the case unless you do. A hundred times out of a hundred.\"\n\nThe album version of \"Taurus\" is far more similar to \"Stairway to Heaven\" than the sheet music, which Malofiy said was a poor transcription.\n\nJUSTICE DEPARTMENT BACKS LED ZEPPELIN IN COPYRIGHT SUIT\n\nLED ZEPPELIN FACES RETRIAL FOR 'STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN' COPYRIGHT SUIT\n\nWhile the 1909 copyright law that covers \"Taurus\" protects the sheet music as deposited with the U.S. Copyright Office, Malofiy said legal precedent allows a \"look to other evidence, the best evidence, better evidence,\" and that a song's recorded version can be considered.\n\nSome judges felt that he was trying to use a backdoor to get the recording to be considered part of the copyright and played at trial.\n\n\"I'm asking you a question: 'What work in your view is entitled to copyright protection?' It should be simple,\" said Hurwitz, who often hounded Malofiy during the hearing and demanded yes-or-no answers when he thought the lawyer was being evasive.\n\nDID LED ZEPPELIN RIP OFF 'STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN' FROM ANOTHER SONG?\n\n\"I don't think it's the sound recording that's copyrighted, I think it's the composition embodied in the sound recording,\" Malofiy said.\n\nThat prompted Judge M. Margaret McKeown to ask, \"You want to take the sound recording and essentially reverse engineer what would be the sheet music for the sound recording?\"\n\nMalofiy answered, \"I think you could look at it that way, yes.\"\n\nAt issue is the classic introductory riff to \"Stairway to Heaven,\" constantly played by amateurs in guitar shops for nearly 50 years, which leads into the opening lyrics, \"There's a lady who's sure, all that glitters is gold, and she's buying a stairway to heaven.\"\n\nMalofiy told the court that Page, who wrote the riff, said he does not even read music, so it's ridiculous to merely consider the paper version of \"Taurus.\"\n\nJIMMY PAGE REFLECTS ON LED ZEPPELIN'S LEGACY\n\n\"Why are we looking at this artificial analysis that never happened in the real world?\" the lawyer said. \"It's wrong, it's artificial, it's imaginary. What we do know, and what we proved at trial, is that Jimmy Page has five of Spirit's albums in his record collection.\"\n\nLed Zeppelin attorney Peter Anderson argued that Malofiy was trying to bring up an entirely new and irrelevant issue with talk of the sheet music and recording.\n\n\"At no point in this case,\" Anderson said, \"did the plaintiff ever take the position that the deposit copy was in error.\"\n\nThe U.S. government also weighed in on the case, siding with Led Zeppelin.\n\nGovernment attorney Daniel Tenny said at Monday's hearing that the \"Taurus\" recording could be considered under more recent copyright legislation, but under the 1909 law that applies, only the sheet music matters.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"It's clear that copyright owners were told ... that all you're getting protection for is what you deposited with us,\" Tenny said.\n\nLed Zeppelin's trial win stood in contrast to other recent high-profile cases. Jurors decided in a 2015 trial that Robin Thicke's \"Blurred Lines\" copied Marvin Gaye's \"Got to Give It Up,\" and a jury earlier this year found that Katy Perry's hit \"Dark Horse\" copied from a Christian rap song.", "description": "A group of federal judges aren't sure all that glitters is gold, and they don't seem to be buying that a new trial is necessary in the copyright fight over the Led Zeppelin song, \"Stairway to Heaven.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/01/zeppelin-getty-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
