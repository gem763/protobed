Will robots take our jobs? Others focus instead on threats to the quality of employment\u2014the replacement of middle-class occupations with lower-skill, lower-wage ones; the steady elimination of human discretion as algorithms order around warehouse pickers, ride-hailing drivers, and other workers.\n\nWhat\u2019s less understood is that artificial intelligence will transform higher-skill positions, too\u2014in ways that demand more human judgment rather than less. And that could be a problem. As AI gets better at performing the routine tasks traditionally done by humans, only the hardest ones will be left for us to do. But wrestling with only difficult decisions all day long is stressful and unpleasant. Being able to make at least some easy calls, such as allowing Santorini onto Kickstarter, can be deeply satisfying.\n\n\u201cDecision making is very cognitively draining,\u201d the author and former clinical psychologist Alice Boyes told me via email, \u201cso it\u2019s nice to have some tasks that provide a sense of accomplishment but just require getting it done and repeating what you know, rather than everything needing very taxing novel decision making.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Fred Benenson", "Theatlantic.Com Ideas Archive Artificial-Intelligence-Will-Make-Your-Job-Even-Harder"], "top_image": ""}
