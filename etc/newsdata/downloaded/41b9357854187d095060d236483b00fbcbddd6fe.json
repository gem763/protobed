(ABC) is trading up strongly Wednesday on the heels of reports of a potential settlement on over 2,000 lawsuits brought by state and local governments over the opioid epidemic. Let's check out the charts of ABC to see if this price strength is sustainable.\n\nIn the daily bar chart of ABC, below, we can see that prices had been moving sideways to lower from early August until a few days ago when it started to rally. Prices have surged above the declining 50-day moving average line Wednesday. The daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) has been improving all month and suggests a shift from aggressive selling to aggressive buying.\n\nThe trend-following Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator has just crossed to the upside for a cover shorts buy signal. The indicator is just below the zero line so further price strength in ABC should soon generate a cross of the zero line and an outright buy signal.\n\nIn the weekly bar chart of ABC, below, we can see that prices have been stuck in a sideways trading range the past three years. Prices are above the rising 40-week moving average line.\n\nThe weekly OBV line shows improvement from April and the MACD oscillator is above the zero line and narrowing toward a possible fresh buy signal.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of ABC, below, we can see Wednesday's strength and an upside price target of $105. A decline to $79.05 would weaken the chart.\n\nBottom-line strategy: Traders could go long ABC on any intra-day dip or temporary pullback. Risk below $80 and the $102 area is our first price target.", "description": "AmerisourceBergen (ABC) Stock Has Begun a New Leg Higher...ABC", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "It'S As Simple As A-B-C", "Amerisourcebergen Has Begun A New Leg Higher", "Here'S How To Play The Stock Now.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Jim Cramer", "Mark Sebastian", "Timothy Collins", "Bob Lang", "Doug Kass"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/952591f9-a77c-11e7-a524-117073331fe0.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
