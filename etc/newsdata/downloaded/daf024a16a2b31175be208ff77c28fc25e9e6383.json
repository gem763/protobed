It appears to show Trudeau with his face and arms covered in black makeup, raising his hands in the air while laughing and sticking out his tongue.\n\n\"We can confirm that it is him and it's from the early 1990s,\" said a Liberal Party spokesperson in a statement.\n\nNDP leader Jagmeet Singh says it will be 'tough' to shake Justin Trudeau's hand after a photo surfaced of the Liberal leader in brownface. 0:42\n\nConservative Leader Andrew Scheer later confirmed the video had been sent to his team originally, which then passed it on to Global for \"verification.\"\n\nA Liberal source says Trudeau held a conference call with his candidates Thursday morning to apologize. He will address the media at 2:15 p.m. ET in Winnipeg before flying to Saskatoon.\n\nThe photos have disrupted the Liberals' campaign plans. Until now, Trudeau has had morning events on every day of the federal election campaign.\n\nFor the first time during the campaign, Trudeau and his team stayed at a different hotel than members of the media Wednesday night.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on his campaign plane Wednesday night in Nova Scotia, Trudeau apologized for his actions, saying he now recognizes they were racist.\n\n\"I shouldn't have done that. I should have known better, but I didn't and I'm really sorry,\" he said. \"I take responsibility for my decision to do that. I shouldn't have done it. I should have known better.\n\n\"It was something that I didn't think was racist at the time, but now I recognize it was something racist to do and I am deeply sorry.\"\n\nTrudeau's apology based on 'a lie': Scheer\n\nThe story dominated the other leaders' campaign events today.\n\nScheer said the emergence of the video shows Trudeau's Wednesday night apology was based on \"a lie.\"\n\n\"I believe Canadians might have been able to accept his apology if he had been truthful and open, if he hadn't based that apology on a lie,\" Scheer said during a stop in Saint-Hyacinthe, Que.\n\nConservative Leader Andrew Scheer spoke to reporters in Saint Hyacinthe, Quebec on Thursday 2:11\n\n\"He was specifically asked if there were other instances where he engaged in that type of racist behaviour and he indicated there was only one other instance. Now we know there [were] at least three.\"\n\nAsked today if he's ever dressed in any way that would be deemed offensive, Scheer said he has not.\n\n\"I'm not perfect and I don't claim to be a saint, but nothing would come up to that level,\" he said.\n\nDuring an interview with John Moore, host of Newstalk 1010 in Toronto, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh was asked if he'll smile and shake Trudeau's hand at the first leaders' debate.\n\n\"It's going to be tough,\" he said. \"To be honest with you, I don't really know how to react. This is someone who so casually mocked the reality for so many people and has hurt a lot of Canadians with this.\"\n\nReactions to a photo of Justin Trudeau in brownface from a 2001 gala at a Vancouver school ranged from questioning the Liberal leader's judgment to one person worrying instead about the bigger issues. 1:33\n\nWhere the leaders are:\n\nYou can watch streaming video of available live events on this page throughout the day.\n\nAll times are Eastern Time, unless otherwise noted.\n\nNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh:\n\n7:20 a.m. Media appearance on Newstalk 1010's Moore in the Morning in Toronto.\n\n8 a.m. Media appearance on CTV's Your Morning in Toronto.\n\n10 a.m. Announcement about small businesses in Hamilton.\n\nLiberal Leader Justin Trudeau:\n\n2:15 p.m. \u2013 Trudeau will hold a media availability in Winnipeg\n\n8 p.m. \u2013Trudeau will deliver remarks in Saskatoon, Sask.\n\nConservative Leader Andrew Scheer:\n\n10:30 a.m. Announcement and media availability in Saint-Hyacinthe, Que.\n\nLocal brewery visit in Granby, Que., with Conservative candidate Nathalie Clermont.\n\n5 p.m. Campaigning with Conservative candidate Dany S\u00e9vigny in Sherbrooke, Que.\n\nGreen Party Leader Elizabeth May:\n\nNoon (9 a.m. PT) At the B.C.
