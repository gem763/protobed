It can power the equivalent of up to 13,500 four-room Housing Board flats annually.\n\nBBR Greentech was one of the companies that had participated in the PUB and Economic Development Board floating solar PV test bed on Tengeh Reservoir to study the feasibility of floating solar PV technology here.\n\nAs for the floating solar PV systems at Bedok and Lower Seletar reservoirs, PUB said on Wednesday that they will be deployed on the reservoir surface next to Bedok Pump Station and the Lower Seletar Pump Station.\n\nTaking up just 0.5 per cent of Lower Seletar Reservoir and 2 per cent of Bedok Reservoir's surface areas, they will not affect the operational and recreational uses of the reservoirs, PUB said.\n\n\"Solar power is a viable source of renewable energy in sunny Singapore,\" said the agency. \"While the majority of solar PV systems are deployed on land or rooftops, water bodies such as reservoirs, with their large surface areas, can also be used to harness solar energy.\"\n\nThe award of the tender for the two reservoirs comes amid a shift towards solar power, a renewable source of energy, even as global awareness on how fossil fuels are contributing to climate change is growing.\n\nBy 2030, Singapore wants to ramp up its solar capacity by more than seven times from current levels, and increase the current 260 MWp of installed solar capacity to 2 gigawatt-peak.\n\nThis is enough to meet the annual power needs of some 350,000 households in Singapore, or about 4 per cent of Singapore's total electricity demand today.\n\nThe new 2GWp target for Singapore was outlined by Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing on Tuesday at the opening of the Singapore International Energy Week at the Sands Expo and Convention Centre.\n\nTHE STRAITS TIMES", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Energy & Commodities - [SINGAPORE] Floating solar panel systems that harness the sun's energy to generate electricity will be operational at two reservoirs by the middle of next year. .
