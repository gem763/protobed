(Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nWorrying signs first emerged two years ago in this Muslim pocket in China\u2019s heartland. Calls to prayer, once broadcast from local mosques, fell silent. The Koran, banned from sale, vanished from bookstores.\n\nMembers of the Hui minority, who number 10 million, hoped that the state crackdown would not arrive here, in the fertile valleys and loess hills of Gansu province, as it had in Xinjiang, the homeland of the other major Muslim ethnic group in China, the Uighurs.\n\nHope faded in April. Government cranes began appearing ominously over Hui mosques. A video surfaced on social media showing workers taking apart the Gazhuang mosque\u2019s gold dome, then smashing it into the prayer hall. Local Hui saw an unmistakable metaphor: the Communist Party, which once handled religious life here with a light touch, now ran roughshod over it.\n\n\u201cWomen were crying; others, like me, couldn\u2019t believe what was happening,\u201d said Ma Ha, a 40-year-old owner of a noodle shop. \u201cWe had 40 years of religious freedom. The winds are changing.\u201d\n\nUnder its leader, Xi Jinping, China\u2019s government has intensified efforts to assimilate ethnic minorities and curtail religions, such as Islam, that it considers carriers of foreign influence. For two years on the Xinjiang frontier, China has sent hundreds of thousands, possibly millions, of Uighurs in what it calls reeducation centers, where they are taught to renounce their religion and culture and embrace new state-prescribed identities as secular Chinese.\n\nThat tide of \u201cSinicization,\u201d as Chinese policymakers call it, is surging nationwide. A recent, unescorted trip through Gansu, a corridor that once ushered Silk Road caravans and Islam into imperial China, revealed an accelerating campaign to assimilate another Muslim minority, the Hui, a Chinese-speaking people with no recent record of separatism or extremism.\n\n\n\nThe campaign targeting the Hui does not feature mass internment or pervasive digital surveillance, the most striking aspects of the Xinjiang crackdown. But it is a purge of ideas, symbols, culture, products \u2014 anything deemed not Chinese. It permeates life, in ways existential and mundane.\n\n[Chinese database tracks apps, car location and even electricity usage in Muslim region]\n\nDomes and minarets are lopped off mosques and replaced with curving Chinese roofs. News broadcasts are forbidden to show pedestrians wearing traditional Hui skullcaps or veils. Arabic script is outlawed in public spaces, so practically every restaurant has a sun-beaten facade with dark traces where the word \u201chalal\u201d has been scraped off.\n\nStrict new quotas throttle religious education to the degree that some Hui intellectuals predict their people could become largely irreligious, like most of China, in two or three generations.\n\nPressures are mounting against the Hui, the distant descendants of Persian traders, at a moment when the Communist leadership is stoking nationalism among the ethnic majority Han to bolster popular support. In officials\u2019 speeches, on television and across billboards, one frequent refrain is the \u201cChina Dream\u201d \u2014 Xi\u2019s vision of restoring China\u2019s historic power and wealth, its culture and its pride.\n\n\u201cThe great rejuvenation of the Chinese people is actually a narrow-minded, xenophobic kind of nationalism,\u201d said Li Yunfei, an imam from eastern China and one of the last dissident Hui writers. \u201cAnything that is defined by them as coming from abroad, they strive to eliminate through administrative means.\u201d\n\n\n\nAn April 2018 Communist Party directive obtained by the Germany-based World Uighur Congress advocacy group showed the party\u2019s central leadership instructing local authorities to reverse what it deemed to be growing \u201cSaudi\u201d and \u201cArab\u201d influences in architecture, clothing, religious practice and language.\n\nAlthough the contents of the directive were confidential, government offices nationwide have issued general statements confirming they were implementing its orders.\n\nThe 22 million followers of Islam are not the only people touched by China\u2019s assimilation drive. Christian church steeples and crosses have been taken down across the country. When party bosses inspected Tibetan regions in August, they told local officials to implement Xi\u2019s \u201cimportant words on religious work,\u201d tighten control over monasteries and \u201cfocus efforts to Sinicize religion.\u201d\n\nAmbitious social re-engineering will be seen as one of Xi\u2019s legacies, said Vanessa Frangville, a professor of Chinese studies at the Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles in Belgium.\n\n\n\nBy curbing religion, the party \u201cremoves potential opponents to power,\u201d Frangville said. \u201cTo control the whole population through technology and ideology \u2014 it\u2019s what leaders dream about.\u201d\n\n\n\n'We've regressed 40 years'\n\nFor centuries, Gansu was a land of transition. In the hills where the Tibetan highlands flatten into prairie, sprawling Tibetan monasteries exerted a greater gravity than the emperors of faraway Beijing. In the Daxia River valley, Sufi preachers and devout warlords had turned an old Silk Road hub called Linxia into a Hui bastion decades before communists swept through in 1949.\n\n\n\nToday, Beijing wants to make its influence felt.\n\n\n\nA Hui Muslim man rides past a mosque in Linxia in 2018.

(Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nOn a recent morning, a local imam ushered a visitor past a flagpole with a flapping red Chinese banner that officials insisted on installing earlier this year. Along a courtyard wall, propaganda bulletins reminded worshipers of their foremost loyalty: the communist state before Allah.\n\n\u201cIslam has been in China 1,300 years. Other than 10 years of the Cultural Revolution, it\u2019s always been passed down generation to generation without a break,\u201d said the imam, who, like almost everyone in Gansu, spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of government retribution. \u201cWe\u2019ve regressed 40 years to the Cultural Revolution.\u201d\n\nSitting in his classroom, where the number of religious students had plunged 90 percent in one year as new quotas took effect, the imam spoke about how the Koran was banned from sale and local publishers who printed the hadith \u2014 collections of the prophet Muhammad\u2019s sayings \u2014 were jailed.\n\n[Angry over campus speech by Uighur activist, Chinese students in Canada contact their consulate, film presentation]\n\nMost destabilizing, the imam said, was the sense of foreboding.\n\nHui officials felt unsure about how to please the central government, so they erred on the side of caution, the imam said. Everybody else \u2014 from wealthy Hui businessmen to poor farmers \u2014 felt \u201ccompletely paralyzed,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Xinjiang policy is already being implemented here. At least we\u2019re moving in that direction,\u201d the imam said. \u201cWe\u2019re born and raised Chinese. Our passports are Chinese. Our forefathers are Chinese. How do you want us to be more Chinese?\u201d\n\nDown an alley from Linxia\u2019s Binhe mosque, one of at least three in the city facing what officials euphemistically call \u201crenovation,\u201d a day laborer named Ma Junyi seemed strained as he spoke about the shifting sands.\n\nResidents were uneasy about new restrictions that cut the madrasa\u2019s class sizes down to 30 \u2014 a quota enforced by random checks, Ma said. Youngsters under 18, such as his 9-year-old daughter, were forbidden from setting foot inside the courtyard.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe know leaders have their reasons,\u201d Ma said. \u201cBut how can we pass on our traditions? It feels like we\u2019re going extinct.\u201d\n\nA American model\n\nIn 2008 and 2009, China was rocked by race riots in Tibet and Xinjiang that left hundreds of Han, Uighurs and Tibetans dead.\n\nIn the following years, a remarkably open discussion about China\u2019s ethnic policy flourished on campuses, in journals, even on television. Two of the most influential voices were Hu Angang, a conservative intellectual at Tsinghua University in Beijing, and Hu Lianhe, a midcareer official who later soared through the Communist Party ranks.\n\nIn 2011, the two Hus, who are not related, teamed up to publish essays critiquing long-standing policies that recognized China\u2019s 56 ethnic minorities, offered them preferential treatment on matters such as college admissions, and carved out regions where peoples such as Uighurs and Tibetans lived with some autonomy.\n\nThe Hus pointed out that religious and ethno-nationalist impulses played a role in the demise of the Soviet Union \u2014 a cautionary tale that the Chinese Communist Party studies obsessively. They called for an \u201cupgrade\u201d of the policies and pointed to a model that they thought China should consider: the United States.\n\n\u201cThe early melting pot policy . . . was a powerful \u2018Anglo-Saxonization\u2019 policy, mainly assimilating other ethnic groups into Anglo-Protestant groups,\u201d they wrote in a paper that traced waves of U.S. immigration from Southern Europe and later Latin America. \u201cAlthough the norms of pluralism have become very strong in recent years, the fact remains that ethnic differences are tending to disappear.\u201d\n\n[China celebrates \u2018very happy lives\u2019 in Xinjiang, after detaining 1 million Uighurs]\n\nThe articles sparked controversy in China. But today, they are the most-cited papers on the subject, said Hu Angang. They helped propel Hu Lianhe to become a top official; last year, he defended China\u2019s Xinjiang policy before a United Nations panel in Geneva.\n\nIn an interview and in emails, Hu Angang said his ideas were often misunderstood in the West. He did not espouse forced assimilation, he said, but the wisdom of China\u2019s ethnic policies was proved by data showing the standard of development in Xinjiang and Tibet outstripping neighboring countries stricken by poverty and chaos.\n\n\n\n\u201cEthnic harmony and social stability are the greatest, most important public good, but invisible and intangible like fresh air.\u201d\n\nA quiet demise\n\nWeeks after Linxia was stunned by the video of grieving worshipers wailing next to their crushed Gazhuang mosque, a retired village party secretary sat in a nearby farmhouse picking at a plate of stewed chicken.\n\nWas China cracking down on Islam? Nonsense, he said.\n\nFirst, he said, the Linxia government is paying to rebuild the Gazhuang mosque \u2014 with a Chinese-style roof. Workers did drop the dome, but it was an accident. And the video that went viral was uploaded by mischievous young Hui who have since been punished with 24-hour detention and released. The party was not only beneficent, he said, but also lenient.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy is a dome so important?\u201d the official said as he shuffled to a coat rack and removed his Hui skullcap in favor of a sun hat. \u201cI can swap out my hat. You can swap out a dome. The government\u2019s not saying you can\u2019t be Muslim, or forcing you to be Buddhist or Christian!\u201d\n\nResidents have voiced worries about the direction things were headed, he conceded, but quickly dismissed the thought. \u201cI tell the people they need to trust me, we are not in danger,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the people trust me.\u201d\n\nThe bottom line was that China had the right to do things its way, he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cHow can Americans possibly lecture China about religious freedom?\u201d he said. \u201cHow many Muslims has America killed in Iraq and Afghanistan? If you ask the Muslim world if they prefer America or China, I believe they would say China.\u201d\n\nIn a high-rise near Linxia\u2019s modest downtown, Suleiman, a 30-something public-sector employee, said local government officials and Communist Party members, most of whom are Hui, were caught in a particular bind.\n\n\n\nParty members and civil servants are prohibited from making Hajj pilgrimages, the obligation of every Muslim, according to Suleiman. Linxia city employees cannot be seen praying, and Hui contractors are asked to take off skullcaps when they meet officials for city business.\n\nSuleiman said the government policies seemed almost mild compared to rhetoric on Chinese social media, where popular Han nationalist accounts often sound warnings about sharia law, halal food and other alleged Islamic conspiracies corrupting Chinese society.\n\nChinese Christians are also under pressure from the state, Suleiman said, but there seemed to be no widespread antipathy toward Christians, no explosive potential.\n\n\n\n[In Central Asia\u2019s forbidding highlands, a quiet newcomer: Chinese troops]\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid someday there will be mass movement against Muslims,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m terrified, because China has been easily gripped by mass movements since ancient times.\u201d\n\nTo journey through Linxia, where eight great mosques, a bazaar and warlord estates once comprised the center of Hui life, is to see the Sinicization campaign unfolding with a meticulous logic.\n\nAlong the highway approaching the city, a wall of black tarp perfectly blocks drivers from seeing the Jiajianan mosque\u2019s minarets being pruned in the distance. On the main commercial avenue, officials covered up Islamic arches with stone slabs featuring a Chinese motif, chrysanthemum flowers. In a government-run museum, curators removed skullcaps and headscarves from mannequins in an exhibit on Hui culture.\n\n\n\nIn the next room, an exhibit on local history celebrates how the region\u2019s mosques were rebuilt during the 1980s. It omits a piece of context: Many were razed earlier, in 1957, by communist zealots during a mass frenzy whipped up by Chairman Mao Zedong.\n\nThe Hui in Gansu today do not suffer violence, only a quiet demise, Suleiman said: \u201cThey\u2019re slowly boiling us like frogs.\u201d\n\n\n\nRead more:\n\nChina celebrates \u2018very happy lives\u2019 in Xinjiang, after detaining 1 million Uighurs\n\nChinese database tracks apps, car location and even electricity usage in Muslim region\n\nChina defends its \u2018people-oriented\u2019 Muslim reeducation program as job training\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "The Hui minority, a mostly Islamic people who speak Chinese, face increasing restrictions on religious observance, raising fears of Xinjiang-style oppression.", "authors": ["Gerry Shih", "China Correspondent", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/AMe76Vl_xMWs09rAw3vjB8497OQ=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6BFFEPW3YII6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
