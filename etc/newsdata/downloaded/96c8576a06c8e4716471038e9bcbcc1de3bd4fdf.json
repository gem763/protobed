AFP/Getty\n\nIn a haunting distress call apparently made from the Conception and recorded by a Ventura County marine radio channel, a man yells, \u201cMayday! Mayday! Mayday!\u201d Through the distortion and crackle of the radio call, the man\u2019s fear is apparent. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe!\u201d he screams.\n\nRescue crews scoured the waters south of Santa Barbara and west of Los Angeles throughout the day Monday, hoping that they might find survivors from the Conception, which had been on a three-day holiday excursion to the Channel Islands, part of a national park encompassing rugged, pristine coves in the Pacific.\n\nThe remains of four victims were recovered by rescue teams Monday, according to Sheriff Bill Brown of Santa Barbara County, and an additional four had been located \u201con the ocean floor in close proximity to the vessel\u201d, he said. There were six crew members aboard and 33 passengers.\n\nAs of Monday afternoon, Coast Guard boats were still conducting search and rescue operations.\n\nA Coast Guard spokeswoman, Monica Rochester, said during a news conference late Monday that the search would continue through the night. But she said the crew members were the only known survivors from the Conception. \u201cIt\u2019s a very tragic event, and we will search all the way through the night, into the morning,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think we should all be prepared to move into the worst outcome.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Narrow staircases from the sleeping quarters and showers led to the galley.\n\nIt remains unclear what started the fire. But Mr Brown said that \u201cyou couldn\u2019t have asked for a worse situation\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou have a vessel in the open sea that is in the middle of the night,\u201d he said. \u201cThe sleeping compartment was on the bottom deck of the ship. They would have been sound asleep when this fire started.\u201d\n\nIt was too early Monday to say whether negligence had played any role in the fire. \u201cThe vessel has been in full compliance,\u201d Rochester said at a news conference. The boat was equipped with a fire suppression system in the engine room. The vessel also had an onboard, built-in barbecue, according to the website.\n\nAfter picking up the mayday call at about 3.15am, the Coast Guard dispatched two helicopter crews and several boats to the scene, where they were met by other law enforcement agencies.\n\nAt the time of the fire, the Conception was moored in Platts Harbour, north of Santa Cruz Island. At sunrise it was smouldering but still afloat, according to a photograph posted by the Santa Barbara Fire Department. It sank later that morning, around 20 yards from shore.\n\nThe Hansens\u2019 account testified to the panic in the initial moments after the fire struck.\n\nThe crew members who escaped the fire had reached the couple\u2019s boat on an inflatable tender boat.\n\nThe Hansens gave clothes to the crew members and helped dry them off. One appeared to have broken his leg, evidently during the escape, and was in tremendous pain. Two other members of the crew went back out toward the Conception to look for passengers who may have made it off the boat; they found no one.\n\n\u201cThe fire was too big; there was absolutely nothing we could do,\u201d Bob Hansen said. \u201cYou never anticipate something like this. We just felt so helpless.\u201d\n\nRecreational divers in California said Truth Aquatics had a good reputation and appeared careful about safety.\n\nBill Zhang, owner of Ocean One scuba, which has offered scuba trips on the Conception for the last three years, estimated that there were 15 to 20 diving boats in Southern California and said that the three owned by Truth Aquatics were the largest in the Los Angeles area.\n\n\u201cThey are the biggest company in California \u2014 they should pass everything very easily,\u201d Mr Zhang, 35, said. He noted that there would have been two captains on board the Conception because it was on an overnight trip.\n\nCommercial boats of the Conception\u2019s size must pass Coast Guard inspection annually to renew their licenses.\n\nGary Pilecki, a Bay Area-based member of a club that has chartered annual lobster-fishing trips on Truth Aquatics boats since 1982, said that the company\u2019s vessels were always clean and well maintained.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re always doing something to it,\u201d Mr Pilecki, 65, said. \u201cEvery time I go by Santa Barbara, I stop and say hello to them, and they\u2019re working on the boat. They\u2019re replacing pipes and repairing things.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s beyond me,\u201d Mr Pilecki said of the fire. \u201cI\u2019m surprised to hear about this.\u201d\n\nAlong Santa Barbara Harbour on Monday, residents and visitors alike were speculating about the cause of the fire. Michael Gaffney, 62, who lives across the street from the harbour, said he had seen tourists from all over the country and even the world line up for the scuba trips. \u201cIt\u2019s horrible,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re trapped down below, there\u2019s nowhere to go.\u201d\n\nPromotional materials for the tours hung throughout the dock, featuring photographs of the company\u2019s three boats: Vision, Truth and Conception in the middle. On Monday afternoon, Truth sat alone in the harbour.\n\nChannel Islands Harbour in Oxnard, California, where the local Coast Guard unit is headquartered, was covered in fog Monday morning. Despite the tragedy offshore, business continued largely as usual along the harbour; out on the water were recreational boats, kayakers and paddle boarders.\n\nSanta Cruz Island, in Santa Barbara County, is one of five islands in Channel Islands National Park, according to the website for the National Park Service, which owns and manages about a quarter of the island. The other three-quarters is owned and managed by the Nature Conservancy. California\u2019s largest island, at about 96 square miles, Santa Cruz Island is about 20 miles from Ventura, the website said.\n\n\u201cOur hearts are with the families and loved ones affected by this tragic incident,\u201d Governor Gavin Newsom said on Twitter. \u201cWe are eternally grateful for our heroic emergency medical workers that are on site \u2014 working to ensure every individual is found.\u201d\n\nAuthorities have not released the names or nationalities of the dead or missing.\n\nNew York Times", "description": "The frantic knocking came well before dawn and jolted Bob and Shirley Hansen awake on their 60ft fishing boat, The Grape Escape, moored for the night off the coast of Southern California.
