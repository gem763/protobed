Alongside typical Day of the Dead observances, such as the construction of altars, locals pour into squares and parade down streets dressed in intricate attire and carved wooden masks. A carnival atmosphere abides and regional dances are a given, although each town has its own unique set of Xantolo rituals.\n\nFestival de Barriletes Gigantes in Santiago Sacatep\u00e9quez, Guatemala\n\nDuring the appropriately named Giant Kite Festival on 1 November, Mayan tradition and the Catholic feast of All Saints combine as brightly coloured and bamboo-framed kites dip and dive through the air with surprising grace above Santiago Sacatep\u00e9quez and nearby Sumpango. Each kite \u2013 which can be more than 30ft wide and decorated with folkloric, religious, or political designs \u2013 serves as a way of communicating with the dead.\n\nD\u00eda de las \u00d1atitas in La Paz, Bolivia\n\nNot strictly a Day of the Dead celebration, Bolivia\u2019s D\u00eda de las \u00d1atitas (Day of the Skulls) falls a week later. Many Bolivian Aymaras keep the skulls of their deceased loved ones enshrined in the home as a symbol of good luck. However, it\u2019s on 8 November when Catholic influence and Andean tradition converge and these skulls \u2013 often decorated with floral crowns, cigarettes, and coca leaves \u2013 are transported en masse to the General Cemetery in La Paz as a sign of gratitude for the fortune they\u2019ve brought to the living.\n\nFestival de la Luz y la Vida in Chignahuapan, Mexico\n\nOn 1 and 2 November, thousands of candles, lamps, and torches light the way for living and dead alike, casting an orange glow over the inky night sky as crowds make the pilgrimage from the centre of Chignahuapan, Puebla to the Almoloya Lagoon. There, the Festival of Light and Life begins in earnest with a folkloric performance, sound and light show, as well as fireworks.\n\nHanal Pix\u00e1n in Pomuch, Mexico\n\nSituated in the often-overlooked state of Campeche, Pomuch is a tiny town with one of the Mexico\u2019s most fascinating and unusual November rituals. During Hanal Pix\u00e1n, the Mayan name for what many would call Day of the Dead, living relatives unearth the bones of their deceased \u2013 who must have been dead for at least three years \u2013 before carefully cleaning them one by one, replacing their embroidered shrouds, and placing them in boxes to be displayed in the niches which line Pomuch Cemetery.\n\nFestival de Calaveras in Aguascalientes, Mexico\n\nJos\u00e9 Guadalupe Posada, the creator of the Day of the Dead\u2019s most iconic image \u2013 a satirical engraving of La Catrina, a skeleton bedecked in colonial finery \u2013 was born in Aguascalientes. As such, he\u2019s honoured annually during the week-long Festival de Calaveras (Skull Festival), which brings together live theatrical and musical performances, swathes of visitors bedecked to look like La Catrina, regional foods, and more.\n\nFestival de la Calabiuza in Tonacatepeque, El Salvador\n\nYou\u2019d be forgiven for thinking you\u2019d stumbled onto a zombie film set were you to visit Tonacatepeque on 1 November. In actuality, the streams of people painted white with horror-movie make-up or dressed as Central American folklore figures like La Siguanaba and her son Cipit\u00edo are celebrating the Calabiuza Festival. Developed out of the trick-or-treat-esque tradition of asking for ayote en miel (sugared pumpkin), the tradition has experienced a resurgence in El Salvador\u2019s post-war years.\n\nFet G\u00e9d\u00e9 in Port-au-Prince, Haiti\n\nFete G\u00e9d\u00e9 (or Fh\u00eate Ghede), a typically Haitian celebration of deceased ancestors observed by vodouisants across the country, shares a date with D\u00eda de Muertos and is often likened to Mardi Gras. One of the biggest and best Fet G\u00e9d\u00e9 festivities takes place in the Port-au-Prince Grand Cimeti\u00e8re, where the living dance, drum, feast, and pay homage to the dead at their gravesides.", "description": "Fluttering papel picado (bunting), bright orange cempasuchiles \u2013\u00a0also known as Mexican marigolds \u2013 and sugary hunks of pan de muerto (\u201ddead bread\u201d) adorn altars across Mexico and beyond on the nights of 1 and 2 November, as families gather not to mourn their dead, but to remember them in life.", "authors": ["Lauren Cocking"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/30/12/xantolo-slp-8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
