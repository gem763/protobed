Mike DeWine (R) on Friday signed into law legislation that will increase cyber protections for election systems and enhance the overall cybersecurity posture of the state.\n\nThe legislation, which had bipartisan support, requires post-election audits by county boards of elections to ensure the accuracy of the vote count, while also creating a \u201ccivilian cyber security reserve\u201d that can be called into duty to protect state and local government entities against cyberattacks, including those involving elections and those against critical infrastructure\n\nThe bill gives the Ohio secretary of state a seat on the Ohio Homeland Security Advisory Council and creates a chief information security officer position within the secretary of state\u2019s office to increase attention on election security issues.\n\nOhio Secretary of State Frank LaRose (R), the top election official in the state, said in a statement on Friday that the legislation will give local officials \u201cthe support they need\u201d to combat foreign cyber threats.\n\n\u201cImagine looking out the window and seeing foreign paratroopers parachuting into your town,\" LaRose said. \"We wouldn\u2019t tell a community, \u2018you\u2019re on your own \u2013 your sheriff department can fight off that threat.\u2019 Well likewise, in the online world, we can now respond with Ohio\u2019s best cyber warriors so these counties and cities have the support they need.\u201d\n\nLaRose originally sponsored the legislation when he was a member of the Ohio state Senate prior to being elected secretary of state in 2018. Ohio state Sen. Theresa Gavarone (R) was the primary sponsor of the legislation signed into law on Friday.\n\nThe new law comes after LaRose issued a directive in June that required Ohio county boards of elections to take steps to increase the security of their election systems, including requiring counties to accept free cybersecurity assistance from the Department of Homeland Security and training all staff annually on cybersecurity.\n\nElection security has been in the spotlight this year following the release of the report on Russian interference tactics in the 2016 election by former special counsel Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) Swan MuellerFox News legal analyst says Trump call with Ukraine leader could be 'more serious' than what Mueller 'dragged up' Lewandowski says Mueller report was 'very clear' in proving 'there was no obstruction,' despite having 'never' read it Fox's Cavuto roasts Trump over criticism of network MORE, and the release of two out of an eventual five volumes on the bipartisan investigation by the Senate Intelligence Committee into the same issue.\n\nVolume One of the committee\u2019s investigation concluded that Russian actors \u201cattempted to intrude\u201d in the voting infrastructure of all 50 states in the run-up to the 2016 election, although were not successful in changing any votes.", "description": "Ohio Gov.
