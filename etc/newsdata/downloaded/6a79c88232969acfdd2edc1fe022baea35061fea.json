So I felt I had to do something.\"\n\nCharlie is now launching a charity called The Detransition Advocacy Network, with their first meeting set to be held in Manchester at the end of the month.\n\nSky News went to meet one person who has contacted Charlie's network for help.\n\nShe does not want to be identified so we have changed her name.\n\n'Why I decided to detransition'\n\nRuby is now 21 but first began identifying as male at 13.\n\nAfter taking testosterone her voice got a lot deeper, she grew facial hair and her body changed.\n\nShe had been planning to have surgery to remove her breasts this summer.\n\nHowever, in May, Ruby voiced the growing doubts she had been harbouring and made the decision to come off testosterone and detransition to identify as female.\n\nImage: Ruby is now 21 years old but first began identifying as male at 13\n\n\"I didn't think any change was going to be enough in the end and I thought it was better to work on changing how I felt about myself, than changing my body,\" says Ruby.\n\n\"I've seen similarities in the way I experience gender dysphoria, in the way I experience other body image issues.\"\n\nRuby explains she has also had an eating disorder but she does not feel that issue was explored in the therapy sessions she had when she went to gender identity services.\n\n\"When I was at my gender clinic to get referred for hormones, we had a session where I went over my mental health issues and I told them about my eating disorder and they didn't suggest that that could maybe connected with my gender dysphoria,\" says Ruby.\n\n\"For everyone who has gender dysphoria, whether they are trans or not, I want there to be more options for us because I think there is a system of saying, 'okay here's your hormones, here's your surgery, off you go'. I don't think that's helpful for anyone.\"\n\nThe Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust offers gender identity services for children under 18, with some patients as young as three or four years old.\n\nThey now have a record number of referrals and see 3,200% more patients than they did 10 years ago - with the increase for girls up by 5,337%.\n\nWith referrals at a record high, it suggests cases of detransition will rise too.\n\nIn a statement, a trust spokesperson said: \"Decisions about physical interventions made in our care are arrived at after a thorough exploration process. While some of our patients may decide not to pursue physical treatment or drop out of treatment, the experience of regret described here is rarely seen.\"\n\nGender transition has positive outcomes for many people and even talking about detransition is viewed by some as transphobic.\n\nBut some believe further research and more discussion is needed in treating people with gender dysphoria, as well as more options for them than gender transition.", "description": "A woman who detransitioned in 2018 says there are many people who have had gender reassignment surgery who wish they hadn't.", "authors": ["Sally Lockwood", "North Of England Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://e3.365dm.com/19/10/1600x900/skynews-detansition-lgbt-trans_4795577.jpg?20191004233451", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
