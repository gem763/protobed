Courts have rejected several appeals for his release during the campaign election.\n\nInterim president Mohammed Ennaceur \u2014 filling in since the death of Beji Caid Essebsi in July brought forward the vote for head of state \u2014 warned Friday that Karoui\u2019s detention could have \u201cserious and dangerous repercussions on the electoral process\u201d.\n\nWhile the presidential race may have overshadowed the legislative contest, parliament is responsible for tackling the main challenges facing Tunisian society.\n\nA strong showing for Qalb Tounes could bolster Karoui\u2019s campaign and supporters say it could make a case for him to take over as prime minister if he loses to Saied.\n\nThe socially conservative professor has not come out in support of any party.\n\n\u2013 New movements vie for vote \u2013\n\nWith the electorate fed up with political manoeuvring and failure to improve living conditions since the ouster of late longtime autocrat Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, new movements have been vying for votes.\n\nAich Tounsi, which calls itself an \u201canti-party\u201d, has emerged from the civil society movement, while Islamist populist lawyer Seifeddine Makhlouf\u2019s Karama aims to take seats from Ennahdha, which has been weakened by past alliances with political elites.\n\nWith the plethora of parties and movements in contention, the stage is set for complex and rowdy negotiations before any side emerges with the minimum 109 seats needed to head Tunisia\u2019s next government.\n\nIn the runup to the vote, Qalb Tounes and Ennahdha have officially ruled out forming an alliance.\n\nParliament will have two months to agree on the formation of a new government in a country hailed as the Arab Spring\u2019s sole democratic success story but straining to meet the revolution\u2019s other demands of \u201cwork and dignity\u201d.\n\nWhile it has succeeded in curbing terrorist attacks that rocked the key tourist sector in 2015, Tunisia\u2019s economy remains hampered by austere International Monetary Fund-backed reforms.", "description": "Tunis (AFP) \u2013 Tunisians headed to the polls Sunday for the third round of legislative elections since the country\u2019s 2011 revolution, weeks", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/06/2c659a_tunisians-vote-sunday-in-country-parliamentary-election-2011-revolution-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
