But TrialSpark's partnership with 23andMe could be a game-changer, as 23andMe's users can be funneled into studies that fit with their medical history and are close enough to their geographic location.\n\nThis partnership is a win-win for both 23andMe and TrialSpark:\n\nThe partnership could increase user engagement on 23andMe's clinical research platform, giving its customers a reason to keep coming back to the company's ecosystem. For context, 8 million of 23andMe's 10 million customers are considered by the company to be engaged research participants, and over 75% of customers complete at least one medically related survey issued by the company, according to STAT. Providing new ways for 23andMe's most invested users to engage with and take proactive steps to improve their health could transform casual survey takers into a more powerful revenue stream, which could be critical if Illumina's gloomy outlook on the future sales of DTC genetic testing proves correct.\n\nMeanwhile, leveraging 23andMe's stout user base should help TrialSpark address a major pain point for clients: finding participants. For its part, TrialSpark already boasts faster recruitment times than traditional methods: It claims its speed to screen is six weeks, a huge improvement over the 3-8 months it says is average for traditional contract research organizations (CROs). And now that it's teamed up with 23andMe, TrialSpark is capable of improving upon traditional clinical trial outreach in terms of scope, speed, and volume: Setting up local physician practices as sites for clinical research helps bring groundbreaking medical research from urban medical centers to patients in farflung locations around the country, and funneling those folks into studies that line up with their medical history should decrease the amount of time it takes for trials to meet a minimum viable participant threshold. That could be a game changer for clinical research, considering a recent study showed that 56% of cancer patients are unable to participate in research because there isn't a trial available to them at their local point of care.\n\nAnd 23andMe isn't the only big-name company tackling clinical trial recruitment: Apple is using telehealth and remote patient monitoring tech to recruit participants and expand patients' access to studies. The Apple Watch is fast becoming a go-to clinical research tool, with major studies from Stanford and others exploring the potential of previous generations of the tech to deliver actionable clinical data: Results from the Stanford study were mixed in terms of the data's value to doctors, but the incredible speed and size of the research cohort made-capable by Apple Watch's ubiquity in the consumer market was undeniably impressive.\n\nFor instance, Stanford researchers relied on patient data provided by users through the Apple Health app, telehealth consultations, and the heart monitoring feature of the Apple Watch to amass 400,000 participants in approximately eight months' time. And now that the tech behemoth announced a dedicated Apple Research app and three new health studies launching alongside it, Apple is making all the right moves to establish its flagship wearable as a promising medical research platform.\n\nWant to read more stories like this one?
