(It\u2019s Yuri Gagarin, Neil Armstrong, and Roald Amundsen who respectively achieved those feats.)\n\n\n\nWomen have never been given the opportunity to go out there and achieve great things. When Esther Duflo jointly won the Nobel Prize for Economics along with her husband Abhijit Banerjee and another colleague, she became only the second woman to win the Nobel in Economics in 118 years.\n\nSo, it is a big deal that today is the day that an all-female spacewalk will finally take place. NASA is calling the historic first all-female spacewalk \u201cHERstory\u201d as astronauts Christina Koch and Jessica Meir gear up to perform the feat. It\u2019s great that NASA chose to highlight that even a study of the past is named taking into account only the male perspective--\u201cHIStory\u201d\n\nSpace travel has been a male-dominated space\n\nThe all-female spacewalk was actually scheduled for March this year but had to be scrapped because NASA did not have enough suits for women. Yes, it was scrapped because there weren\u2019t adequate basic resources for female astronauts.\n\nA Twitter thread in July exposed the inherent sexism in the field of space exploration, where the issue of women peeing in space came up. Basically, nobody thought of how women could go to space and pee, while a method had already been figured out for men.\n\nLet's talk about peeing in space.\n\n\n\nSeveral people, in response to my NY Times essay, have said that women couldn't go into space because we lacked the technology for them to pee in space. \u2014 Mary Robinette Kowal (@MaryRobinette) July 19, 2019\n\nAs of yesterday, the number of men who have spacewalked stood at 213, while the number of women stood at 14. Today, that will increase to 15.\n\nJessica Meir, a marine biologist who arrived at the orbiting lab last month, will be the 15th female spacewalker as this is her first ever spacewalk. Christina Koch, an electrical engineer, has already done three spacewalks before this. Christina is also already seven months into an 11-month spaceflight, which will be the longest by a woman. It looks like she is well on her way to being a space veteran.\n\nIn fact, just last week, Christina and a male crewmate had installed new batteries outside the International Space Station (ISS). The battery charger ended up failing. So this time, all four men aboard the ISS will remain inside, while Christina and Jessica go out to replace the broken battery charger.\n\nNASA is making sure that this historic feat raises awareness about women in space, especially amongst school-going children, by asking schoolteachers to share photos of their students celebrating \"HERstory in the making.\" The pictures might just end up on the spacewalk broadcast so be on the lookout.\n\nHere\u2019s to having more women not just in space but in every other professional space possible!\n\n\n\n", "description": "The first ever all-female spacewalk takes place today after a seven months delay due to lack of suits for female astronauts.
