Spicy Italian sausages made from pork, chicken or turkey, fresh chorizo or merguez, will give the dish a kick, while milder sausages like chicken and apple, bratwurst or Weisswurst make for a gentler meal. Serve this on a bed of polenta or mashed potatoes, or with some crusty bread to sop up the vinegary, sausage-rich pan juices, and a green salad on the side. If you want to halve this recipe, reduce the oven temperature to 425 degrees; otherwise the smaller amount of food in the pan might get too brown.\n\nFeatured in: Sausages, The Busy Cook\u2019s Best Friend.", "description": "You can use any kind of sausages in this cozy, autumnal dish, filled with roasted sweet grapes and vinegar-spiked onions Spicy Italian sausages made from pork, chicken or turkey, fresh chorizo or merguez, will give the dish a kick, while milder sausages like chicken and apple, bratwurst or Weisswurst make for a gentler meal Serve this on a bed of polenta or mashed potatoes, or with some crusty bread to sop up the vinegary, sausage-rich pan juices, and a green salad on the side", "authors": ["Melissa Clark", "Colu Henry", "Alexa Weibel", "Kiera Wright-Ruiz", "Angela Dimayuga", "Kim Severson", "Martha Rose Shulman", "Julia Moskin", "Claire Saffitz"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/23/dining/18apperex/18apperex-articleLarge.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
