I put a lot of pressure on myself, and I\u2019m always looking for work on the field and to try and do more. I just think it is better for me to keep on playing.\u201d\n\nKolisi says South Africa do not know Canada as well as their regular opponents in the Rugby Championship and Europe and so must concentrate on getting their own systems and execution right.\n\n\u201cIt comes down to what we have been doing every week. We always look at the previous game and see where we can improve,\u201d he said. \u201cYou do look at the other team, their attacking players and how they kick.\n\n\u201cBut we don\u2019t really know what to expect from their individuals, so we will do our own preparations.\u201d\n\nKolisi is the first black test captain of the Springboks, a hugely significant appointment for a team that was once seen as an iconic symbol of white South Africa during the Apartheid years.\n\nWhile he acknowledges his role as an inspirational figure for young black players he said he did not feel his race should be a factor in how people view him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just very happy to be captain, being the first black captain is not something that I keep in my mind the whole time,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIt is a privilege, as it would be for anybody that comes from my community, and I just want to represent them well.\u201d\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s players will be given two days off after the Canada match to spend time with their families having already been in Japan for five weeks, and for Kolisi it is a chance to reunite with his wife Rachel.\n\n\u201cAlmost all our families, wives and girlfriends are out here. I\u2019m pretty excited to have my wife and children out watching the game,\u201d he said.", "description": "South Africa are expected to breeze past Canada in Tuesday's Rugby World Cup match but while the Springboks see the game as a chance to rest key players ahead of the knockout stages captain Siya Kolisi is happy not to have been left on the sidelines.", "authors": ["Nick Said", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1437939974&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF96074", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
