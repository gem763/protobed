They rewrite their own history.\u201d\n\nHirtle pointed to the 2013 referendum in the Falklands where 99.8 percent of islanders voted to remain British.\n\nOf the 1,517 voters, only three said \u2018No\u2019, while one ballot was invalid.\n\n\u201cIn Argentina, I\u2019m sure there are plenty of people who\u2019d like to see an island have their own freedom and the right to their own self determination, but there are other people who don\u2019t want that,\u201d said Sally Heathman, 25, a communications and media assistant for the Falkland Islands government.\n\nBritain has claimed the Falklands since settling the West island in 1765, while Argentina says it inherited the archipelago from former colonial power Spain, which invoked sovereignty in 1767 after purchasing a French settlement on the East island.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Saber rattling\u2019 \u2013\n\nUnder Kirchner, South America\u2019s third biggest economy made threatening noises regarding the Falklands\u2019 main link with the outside world: their weekly flight to and from Chile\u2019s capital Santiago, which uses Argentine airspace.\n\nWith a second weekly flight from Sao Paulo in Brazil due to begin in November, a change of administration in Buenos Aires could put that at risk.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be at all surprised if there was \u2026 a problem with the second flight,\u201d said Keith Heathman, 76, a driver for Battlefield Tours.\n\nThe flight from Santiago, through Punta Arenas on Chile\u2019s southern tip, is operated by LATAM, which will organize the Sao Paulo fight.\n\nSally Ellis, 48, is the Falklands agent for LATAM and says the Chilean-based company won\u2019t allow any mention of the islands in its inflight magazine.\n\nShe said in the past there has been pressure to stop the flight but branded it \u201csaber rattling.\u201d\n\nMany Argentines, such as 50-year-old Walter Goncalves, visit the Falklands to pay their respects at the Argentine cemetery near Darwin.\n\nGoncalves braved the biting cold, wind, sleet and snow to hike key battlegrounds such as Mounts Longdon, Tumbledown and Two Sisters.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to die without seeing them,\u201d he told AFP.\n\n\u201cMalvinas is a battle that isn\u2019t over for an Argentine,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a battle in which an Argentine will always try to have them recognized as Argentine, because they are Argentine.\u201d\n\nOnce a month, the Santiago flight stops off in Rio Gallegos in Argentine Patagonia, while the new Sao Paulo flight is due for a monthly stop in Cordoba \u2014 Argentina\u2019s second biggest city.\n\n\u201cIt would be cutting off their nose to spite their face,\u201d if Argentina impeded those flights, said Ellis.\n\n\u2013 \u2018They asked for a bribe\u2019 \u2013\n\nSome, though, fear for the future if the liberal, market-friendly Macri loses the election.\n\nAustralian Darrel Day, who runs an adventure tourism company out of Stanley, said that under the Kirchner administration he had a yacht seized in Argentina and had to pay a $186,000 bond in cash to release it.\n\n\u201cThey openly asked for a bribe,\u201d said the 49-year-old. \u201cMacri got on top of the corruption. Dealing with Aduana (Argentine customs) is a lot easier\u201d now.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m so worried about\u201d Fernandez winning the election.\n\nFalkland Islanders are a resilient bunch, though, and know how to manage hardship.\n\nOccasionally the boat carrying food supplies is delayed due to bad weather.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re running a bit low on your food stores and you think: oh it\u2019s OK, I can get it from a tin or there\u2019s meat in the freezer or something along those lines,\u201d said Sally Heathman.", "description": "Stanley (Falkland Islands) (AFP) \u2013 Argentina is going to the polls on October 27 with a Peronist politician backed by former president Cristina", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/18/c40fd0_war-memorabilia-on-1982-falkland-war-battle-fields-is-displayed-globe-tavern-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
