WiseTech shares dropped by about 10% to A$30 (US$20.56) on the release of the J Capital allegations. One Australian dollar equals about 69 U.S. cents.\n\nWiseTech is a major logistics software company. The software company has a market cap of about A$9.5 billion and has over 12,000 logistics company customers in more than 150 countries. Its main product, CargoWise One, executes over 51 billion data transactions annually.\n\nIn reporting on the story, it is necessary to summarize the allegations made by J Capital and WiseTech's response. We do not ourselves make, or support, any allegation against either company or any of the individuals involved.\n\nJ Capital's Allegations\n\nIn an aggressive note and research report, J Capital makes an estimation in which it alleges that WiseTech overstated profit by up to 178$ in the three years since the company listed. It also alleged that the company's underlying organic growth was 10% and not 25% as stated by the company. J Capital claimed the estimated 80% of the top line growth was from purchased revenue. J Capital makes a variety of further allegations namely that European revenues were overstated, that subsidiaries are shielded from audit; that the auditors \"aren't looking at the numbers closely enough\"; that the increase of profit growth post-IPO is \"suspect\"; that its core product \"is held in low regard\" by clients; that the company is manipulating its accounts and that \"insiders are cashing in on the story that WiseTech is pushing out to investors\".\n\nWiseTech Fires Back\n\nReferring to the J Capital report, WiseTech responded late yesterday with a detailed denial of the allegations made against it. WiseTech stated that the J Capital report \"contains many claims and allegations that are untrue. WiseTech rejects entirely the allegations of financial impropriety and irregularity contained in the [J Capital] document. The Report was published without prior inquiry to WiseTech\".\n\nThe software company noted that J Capital is a short seller and that it had disclosed it could benefit from a decline in the WiseTech share price.\n\n\"We are very concerned that the allegations in the document may mislead and manipulate the market to the detriment of WiseTech's business and its shareholders, large and small. Our financials, our revenue, our profit, our growth rates and our product have all been verified comprehensively and form part of the external independent audits conducted annually,\" the software company said in a statement.\n\nStory continues", "description": "The last couple of days took a dramatic turn with U.S. short seller J Capital making explosive allegations that global logistics software behemoth, WiseTech \u2013 a A$9 billion (US$6.2 billion) company, has been seriously misleading investors.
