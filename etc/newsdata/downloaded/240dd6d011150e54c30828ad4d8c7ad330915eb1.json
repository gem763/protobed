By the end of the video, the man had killed two people in the eastern Germany city of Halle and attempted to enter a synagogue using homemade weapons, before being arrested.\n\nOnly five people were watching the Twitch stream at the time but thousands more saw the archived version before it was eventually taken down. Copies of the footage soon spread to other platforms, with an estimated 15,625 people viewing clips through public channels on the messaging app Telegram.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

In the months since the Christchurch attack, technology firms have been working hard to prevent the spread of distressing content and violent propaganda across social networks and video-sharing sites.\n\nIn a series of tweets following the attack, Twitch explained how it \u201cworked with urgency\u201d to remove the content and permanently suspend any accounts found to be sharing it. It took just 30 minutes for the original video to be flagged and taken down, and unlike the Christchurch video, the video did not continue to pop up on sites like YouTube and Twitter thanks to Twitch sharing the underlying code by which the footage can be immediately identified and removed.\n\n\u201cOnce the video was removed, we shared the hash with an industry consortium to help prevent the proliferation of this content,\u201d Twitch said. \u201cWe take this extremely seriously and are committed to working with industry peers, law enforcement, and any relevant parties to protect our community.\u201d\n\nWhat remains an issue is the spread of such content through messaging apps like Telegram and WhatsApp. Sharing the video through a private message means the data is encrypted and therefore cannot be identified by the apps in the same way.\n\nIt is only if the content is shared through public channels, such as those found on Telegram, that the content can be flagged and removed.\n\nMegan Squire, a professor at the Centre for Analysis of the Radical Right, found that a manifesto file believed to come from the German attacker was also spreading on Telegram. Her analysis of the live stream's spread on Telegram found that it reached more than 10 public channels before being removed.\n\nThe Christchurch shooting was first broadcast to Facebook, before being uploaded and shared on sites like Twitter and YouTube.\n\nAt the time, online moderators described attempts to remove the footage as similar to a game of whack-a-mole. While this approach has become more effective through the sharing of video hash identifiers, it remains reactive.\n\nFacebook is already working on the next step, which is to proactively recognise the videos as they are being live streamed. In order to do this, the technology giant has been training artificial intelligence algorithms to recognise videos of shootings as they are happening.\n\nFootage captured on police body cameras during training exercises are being used to help train these algorithms, in the hope that future shootings will be instantly flagged or removed by this AI moderator.\n\n\"The technology Facebook is seeking to create could help identify firearms attacks in their early stages and potentially assist police across the world in their response to such incidents,\" said Neil Basu, the UK's top-ranking counter terrorism police officer.\n\n\"Technology that automatically stops live streaming of attacks once identified, would also significantly help prevent the glorification of such acts and the promotion of the toxic ideologies that drive them.\"\n\nFacebook is working with law enforcement agencies in both the UK and US to develop these strategies, which could eventually find their way onto other platforms like YouTube and Twitch.\n\n\"We'll need to continue to iterate on our tactics because we know bad actors will continue to change theirs,\" Facebook said in a blog post at the time. \"But we think these are important steps in improving our detection abilities.\"", "description": "Staring down the lens of a camera, a man with a high-pitched, heavily-accented voice introduced himself as \u201cAnon\u201d and began a hate-filled\u00a0rant. \u201cI think the Holocaust never happened,\u201d he stated, before stammering into an incoherent tirade against feminism. \u201cThe root of all these problems is the Jew,\u201d he concluded. \u201cWould you like to be friends?\u201d", "authors": ["Anthony Cuthbertson"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/09/17/Germany-shooting.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
