You must be brave, even if you are s**t-scared.\n\n'You have no idea who you are facing and that is why it's so hard to make a measured response that's in line with the threat you face.'\n\nDespite being cleared, Mr Schwartz now regrets giving up his his passport in a show of good faith, which he didn't get back from police until September, seven months after the incident.\n\nMr Schwartz said he was blown away grateful for the support from his employer and his community in recent months.\n\nHe added he was super-conscious of and still feels for Soper's family and friends.\n\nAt his funeral, the personal trainer and amateur weightlifter was remembered as a 'good and kind' person.\n\nHis School of Strong Instagram account shows him competing in various Strongman competitions around the world and was crowned 'Asia's Strongest Man' in 2017.\n\nSoper's last post a month before his death was footage of him deadlifting 250kg for 14 reps at a strongman competition in Goa, India, where he came third.\n\nDevastated family and friends were shocked to hear of Soper's actions leading up to his death.\n\nAfter the fatal home invasion Mr Schwartz spent ten hours being interviewed by police before he was released\n\nIt's understood Soper's mental state went downhill several months earlier after a break-up with girlfriend Kaisha Gambell.\n\n'He hadn't taken it well at all, he still had a broken heart,' his father Raymond Soper told Daily Mail Australia at the time.\n\n'They had been going out for well over 12 months, I'd say. We met her and she was a very nice girl.'\n\nHe was at a loss for words as to why his son entered and ransacked Mr Schwartz's home in a 'zombie-like state'.\n\n'All I can say is it was all out of character for Bradley. We feel that he's had some sort of a breakdown or something,' Mr Soper said.\n\n'There's no way he would go into anyone's place intentionally, there's just no way.'\n\nJoe Williams, a former NRL player, professional boxer and close friend of Mr Soper, said he knew nothing of the 35-year-old's troubles.\n\n'He was a decent guy mate. I'm shocked at the circumstances,' Williams said at the time.\n\n'Breaking into someone's house? That's not the Brad I knew. That's not how we want to remember him.\n\n'It's completely out of character... it's hard to believe it's actually him.'", "description": "A man who confronted an intruder fuelled by drugs is still traumatised by the deadly\u00a0home invasion in Sydney's south-west eight months on and says he can't put the chilling incident behind him", "authors": ["Kylie Stevens For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/16/19658582-0-image-a-7_1570979722903.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
