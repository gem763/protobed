Investors worried about a potential slowdown pushed the S&P 500 earlier this week to its first back-to-back drops of 1% of the year.\n\nBut the index is now on track to end the week with a modest 1.3% loss after rebounding Thursday and Friday.\n\nThe broad stock market index ticked up 0.7% Friday on broad-based gains. Only the index's energy sector traded lower on the session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 183 points, or 0.7%. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.7%. All three indexes are on track for their third consecutive week of losses\n\nThe U.S. economy added 136,000 jobs in September, the Labor Department said Friday. The jobless rate dropped to 3.5% in September from 3.7% in August, marking a 50-year low. Economists had predicted an increase of 140,000 jobs and a steady unemployment rate at 3.7%.\n\n\"It continues to show that the U.S. economy is a jobs machine,\" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. \"We continue to be the healthiest place to be,\"\n\nAs investors bought stocks Friday, they dumped traditionally safe assets like gold, which slumped 0.2%.\n\nEarlier this week, new data showed that U.S. factory activity contracted for a second straight month and hit a 10-year low. Meanwhile, the pace of growth in the services sector has slowed as well.\n\nTowering concerns about U.S. and global growth have led investors to ramp up bets this week that the Fed will slash rates again this year after two cuts in the third quarter.\n\nDespite a strong jobs report Friday, the recent disappointing data will likely keep open the prospect of an interest rate cut at the Fed's October meeting. Even though the U.S. economy has been more resilient than some others around the world, surveys of manufacturing and service-sector activity have hinted at future weakness that could eventually trickle into the labor market.\n\nThere were also other moderating factors, like wage growth. Wage growth continues to be tepid, hinting at a possible decrease in demand for new labor, as growth in average weekly earnings also cooled.\n\nAt a Wall Street Journal event in New York on Thursday, Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida said the central bank will do what it takes to keep the longest period of U.S. economic expansion going. He added that the central bank takes each policy meeting \"one at a time.\"\n\nLater Friday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will speak at a Fed Listens event in Washington.\n\nEsty Dwek, a strategist at Natixis Investment Managers, said recent optimism that the global economy would pick up was fading. \"The world has had, if not expectations at least hopes, that we would see a bottom, \" Ms. Dwek said.\n\nHP shares dropped 9% after the computer hardware company said late Thursday that it would slash up to 9,000 jobs as part of its restructuring plan.\n\nElsewhere, the Stoxx Europe 600 added 0.6%, after suffering heavy losses earlier in the week.\n\nIn Asia, Japan's Nikkei gained 0.3%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 1.1% after the city's chief executive said a ban would be implemented on wearing masks at public gatherings, with penalties of up to a year in jail and a fine.\n\nThe ban could escalate tensions between the government and protesters, leading to more violent confrontations, according to Francis Lun, chief executive at Geo Securities. \"Investors should avoid Hong Kong-related stocks amid worsening social unrest,\" he said.\n\nStock markets in mainland China were closed.\n\nJoanne Chiu contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Gunjan Banerji at Gunjan.Banerji@wsj.com and Avantika Chilkoti at Avantika.Chilkoti@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 04, 2019 11:02 ET (15:02 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
