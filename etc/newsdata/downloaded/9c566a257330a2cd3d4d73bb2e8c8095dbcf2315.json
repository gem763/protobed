One-in-10 have also been victims of fraud.\n\nIt is not just cyber security risks that people who view or host pirated streams face. Several UFC fans have been hit with major fines after inadvertently breaking the law, with one man from Bradford fined \u00a345,000 for sharing a broadcast last year.\n\nWaqas Rasheed claimed he had accidentally created the streams while watching a free online stream.\n\nAnother man who broadcast part of the pre-fight coverage of a pay-per-view fight on Periscope on his phone also received thousands of pounds worth of fines.\n\n\u201cI went round to my friend\u2019s house to watch a pay-per-view boxing match and while we were waiting for the fight to start I started scrolling through Periscope,\u201d Josh Mellor told The Independent last year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d heard in the pub, and from friends, that you could watch free live streams of the fight and wondered how as we\u2019d paid to watch it. Whilst on Periscope, I saw a number of streams and while exploring I clicked the \u2018Go Live\u2019 button. I streamed the pre-fight coverage from my mate\u2019s TV for a few minutes before quitting the app.\u201d\n\nMr Mellor said he had no idea he had broken the law. He said: \u201dI think there are a lot of people out there who don\u2019t understand that digital piracy comes with some very real risks. There are laws around it and the implications can be huge, from large fines to actual jail time.\u201d", "description": "Lightweight world champion Khabib Nurmagomedov is set to return to the Octagon on Saturday night for UFC 242, in a title unification bout with interim champion Dustin Poirier.\u00a0 The highly-anticipated fight sees Khabib as the overwhelming favourite, having beaten former lightweight champion Conor McGregor in his previous match-up last year.", "authors": ["Anthony Cuthbertson"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/10/03/18/rtr1gq8y.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
