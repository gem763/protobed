(Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Redskins fired Jay Gruden on Monday, five games into his sixth season, which is longer than any head coach has lasted in Washington since owner Daniel Snyder bought the team in 1999. For that, Gruden deserves some credit, even if his final record \u2014 35-49-1 \u2014 was, in the words of Steve Spurrier, one of the seven head coaches of the Snyder era who preceded him, \u201cnot very good.\u201d\n\nAs interim coach Bill Callahan takes over an 0-5 team that appears destined to miss the playoffs for a fifth straight year, here\u2019s a look back at how Gruden\u2019s tenure compares to the other Redskins coaches who combined for two postseason wins over the past 20 years. Trigger warning: Bad memories ahead.\n\n[A visual guide to Daniel Snyder's 20 years of Redskins ownership]\n\nNorv Turner (1999-2000)\n\n\n\n(John McDonnell/The Washington Post)\n\nRecord: 17-12 | vs. NFC East: 7-7 | Division titles: 1\n\nPoint differential: 105\n\nStarting QBs: Brad Johnson, Jeff George\n\nPlayoff appearances: 1 | Playoff record: 1-1\n\nBest regular season win: Johnson\u2019s 33-yard touchdown pass to fullback Larry Centers in overtime gave Washington a 26-20 win over the 49ers at 3Com Park and clinched the Redskins\u2019 first NFC East title since 1991.\n\nWorst regular season loss: The Redskins outgained the Cardinals, 422-178, on Nov. 5, 2000, but lost anyway, 16-15.\n\nThe inevitable end: After a 9-7 loss to the Giants dropped the Redskins\u2019 record to 7-6, Turner, who had been on the hot seat since Snyder assumed control of the team, waited nearly two hours for a meeting with the owner that never occurred. Snyder ultimately offered the job to passing game coordinator Terry Robiskie the following morning and called Turner, who was 49-59-1 during his seven seasons in Washington, into his office at Redskins Park at 11 a.m. to deliver the news.\n\n\u201cAs far as Coach Turner being fired, we\u2019ve been hearing that since Mr. Snyder got here,\u201d Redskins wide receiver Albert Connell said at the time. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to think about it. It\u2019s in the back of your mind.\u201d\n\n[Who will be the Redskins' next head coach? Here are a few names that might get consideration.]\n\nTerry Robiskie (2000)\n\n\n\n(Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)\n\nRecord: 1-2 | vs. NFC East: 1-1 | Division titles: 0\n\nPoint differential: -27\n\nStarting QBs: George, Johnson\n\nPlayoff appearances: 0\n\nBest regular season win: The Redskins beat the woeful Cardinals, 20-3, on Christmas Eve to finish 8-8 and give Robiskie his only win.\n\nWorst regular season loss: Robiskie\u2019s debut was a 32-13 defeat at Dallas that effectively ended Washington\u2019s playoff hopes.\n\nThe inevitable end: Snyder wanted a high profile name to replace Turner, and Robiskie, an assistant for his entire coaching career, wasn\u2019t it.\n\n\u201cMarty Schottenheimer knows how to win, and that\u2019s what Redskins fans demand in a coach,\u201d Snyder said in a statement after hiring the former Chiefs and Browns coach, who spent the previous two seasons as an ESPN analyst, in January 2001. \u201cI believe we have a solid player foundation at the Redskins. We\u2019re now pairing that with a coach who understands what it takes to be successful in the NFL.\u201d\n\nMarty Schottenheimer (2001)\n\nRecord: 8-8 | vs. NFC East: 4-4 | Division titles: 0\n\nPoint differential: -47\n\nStarting QBs: George, Tony Banks\n\nPlayoff appearances: 0\n\nBest regular season win: Washington limited the Eagles to 186 total yards in an ugly 13-3 triumph that evened the Redskins\u2019 record after an 0-5 start.\n\nWorst regular season loss: In a game that was postponed one week by the Sept. 11 attacks, the Redskins lost, 37-0, on \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d at Lambeau Field to fall to 0-2.\n\nThe inevitable end: \u201cI think Marty is a fine coach,\u201d Snyder said after Schottenheimer\u2019s team rallied to finish 8-8, but still miss in the playoffs, in his only year at the helm. \u201cI wish we could have worked it out. But it became clear that the Redskins and Marty had irreconcilable differences.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a philosophical dispute over whether Marty should continue with the final say over all personnel matters as well as coaching,\u201d Schottenheimer\u2019s agent, Tom Condon, said.\n\nBy the time Snyder fired Schottenheimer in January 2002, he had a tentative agreement in place with Steve Spurrier, who had abruptly resigned as the head coach at Florida 10 days earlier, to become the next coach of the Redskins.\n\n[ESPN's Scott Van Pelt says Daniel Snyder's Redskins are on 'a treadmill to nowhere']\n\nSteve Spurrier (2002-2003)\n\n\n\n(John McDonnell/The Washington Post)\n\nRecord: 12-20 | vs. NFC East: 2-10 | Division titles: 0\n\nPoint differential: -143\n\nStarting QBs: Shane Matthews, Danny Wuerffel, Patrick Ramsey, Tim Hasselbeck\n\nPlayoff appearances: 0\n\nBest regular season win: The Redskins\u2019 20-17 win over Tom Brady and the Patriots in Week 4 of the 2003 season improved Washington to 3-1 and was one of two losses the eventual Super Bowl champions suffered all year.\n\nWorst regular season loss: Tim Hasselbeck was 6 for 26 with four interceptions in a 27-0 home loss to the Cowboys on Dec. 14, 2003.\n\nThe inevitable end: Spurrier, whose plan to build his offense around a bunch of former Gators was a colossal failure, resigned after two seasons.\n\n\u201cThe whole thing wasn\u2019t working,\u201d Spurrier told The Washington Post after the Redskins went 5-11 in his second year.\n\nSnyder replaced Spurrier with Joe Gibbs, 11 years after the three-time Super Bowl champions retired for the first time.\n\n\u201cJoe Gibbs helped define what the Washington Redskins stand for \u2014 integrity, hard work, determination, winning and championships,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cWho better to set our strategy and lead the Redskins back to championship glory?\u201d\n\nJoe Gibbs (2004-2007)\n\n\n\n(Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)\n\nRecord: 30-34 | vs. NFC East: 10-14 | Division titles: 0\n\nPoint differential: -4\n\nStarting QBs: Mark Brunell, Patrick Ramsey, Jason Campbell, Todd Collins\n\nPlayoff appearances: 2 | Playoff record: 1-2\n\nBest regular season win: There are plenty of candidates, but the \u201cMonday Night Miracle\u201d at Dallas in Week 2 of Gibbs\u2019s second season takes the cake.\n\nWorst regular season loss: In their first game after the death of Sean Taylor, the Redskins lost to the Bills, 17-16. In an effort to freeze Buffalo kicker Rian Lindell before his game-winning field goal attempt, Gibbs called consecutive timeouts, which resulted in a 15-yard penalty.\n\nThe inevitable end: Citing a desire to spend more time with his family, Gibbs retired for a second time after a playoff loss to the Seahawks in January 2008.\n\n\u201cYou can never replace Joe Gibbs,\u201d Snyder said of his most successful hire, who led Washington to a pair of postseason berths in his four seasons.\n\nSnyder replaced Gibbs with Jim Zorn after fans reacted with outrage to a report that former Giants Coach Jim Fassel was the leading candidate for the job.\n\nJim Zorn (2008-2009)\n\n\n\n(Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)\n\nRecord: 12-20 | vs. NFC East: 3-9 | Division titles: 0\n\nPoint differential: -101\n\nStarting QB: Campbell\n\nPlayoff appearances: 0\n\nBest regular season win: Zorn led chants of \u201cHip Hip Hooray\u201d after the Redskins\u2019 23-17 win at Philadelphia improved Washington to 4-1 in his first season.\n\nWorst regular season loss: The \u201cSwinging Gate\u201d game, a 45-12 defeat to the Giants on \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d in Week 15 of his second year.\n\nThe inevitable end: Zorn was in over his head from the start, when he referred to the Redskins as the \u201cmaroon and black\u201d in his introductory news conference. Snyder fired Zorn after the final game of the 2009 season.\n\n\u201cThis has been an extremely difficult season for our organization and for the fans,\u201d Snyder said in a statement after the Redskins finished 4-12, their worst record since 1994. \u201cBruce Allen spent many hours examining the football operations, and we are both determined to do whatever it takes to build a championship team. That process begins today. \u2026 I certainly accept responsibility for mistakes that I have made. I am hopeful that our fans will accept my commitment and pledge to deliver a franchise that can compete in the NFC East every season.\u201d\n\nSnyder, who hired Allen as the Redskins\u2019 GM a couple of weeks before Zorn was fired, announced Mike Shanahan as the team\u2019s new coach in January 2010.\n\nMike Shanahan (2010-2013)\n\n\n\n(Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)\n\nRecord: 24-40 | vs. NFC East: 9-15 | Division titles: 1\n\nPoint differential: -250\n\nStarting QBs: Donovan McNabb, Rex Grossman, John Beck, Robert Griffin III, Kirk Cousins\n\nPlayoff appearances: 1 | Playoff record: 0-1\n\nBest regular season win: Behind rookies Robert Griffin III and Alfred Morris, the Redskins beat the Cowboys, 28-18, on \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d in the 2012 regular season finale to clinch their first NFC East title since 1999.\n\nWorst regular season loss: The Eagles\u2019 59-28 bludgeoning of the Redskins on \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d in Shanahan\u2019s first season, which came on the same day that Washington announced a five-year contract extension for McNabb, remains the worst defeat of Snyder\u2019s tenure.\n\nThe inevitable end: Washington fired Shanahan after a 3-13 season in 2013.\n\n\u201cRedskins fans deserve a better result,\u201d Snyder said in a written statement. \u201cWe thank Mike for his efforts on behalf of the Redskins. We will focus on what it takes to build a winning team, and my pledge to this organization and to this community is to continue to commit the resources and talent necessary to put this team back in the playoffs.\u201d\n\nLess than two weeks later, the Redskins hired Gruden, who spent the previous three years as the offensive coordinator for the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nJay Gruden (2014-2019)\n\n\n\n(Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)\n\nRecord: 35-49-1 | vs. NFC East: 12-21 | Division titles: 1\n\nPoint differential: -317\n\nStarting QBs: Griffin, Cousins, Colt McCoy, Alex Smith, Mark Sanchez, Josh Johnson, Case Keenum\n\nPlayoff appearances: 1 | Playoff record: 0-1\n\nBest regular season win: Washington clinched the NFC East title with a 38-24 win over the Eagles at Lincoln Financial Field on Dec. 26, 2015.\n\nWorst regular season loss: The Redskins needed to beat the Giants, who had nothing left to play for, in the 2016 regular season finale to clinch a second consecutive playoff berth for the first time since 1992. Washington lost, 19-10, after Kirk Cousins threw a crucial late-game interception.\n\nThe inevitable end: Allen said the decision to fire Gruden after Sunday\u2019s 33-7 loss to the Patriots was \u201cdifficult, but necessary.\u201d Only the first part of that phrase applies to being a Redskins fan these days.\n\nRedskins Coaches Under Daniel Snyder (Since 1999)\n\nCoach Record (vs. NFC East) Playoff Record Point Differential Norv Turner 17-12 (7-7) 1-1 105 Terry Robiskie 1-2 (1-1) 0-0 -27 Marty Schottenheimer 8-8 (4-4) 0-0 -47 Steve Spurrier 12-20 (2-10) 0-0 -143 Joe Gibbs 30-34 (10-14) 1-2 -4 Jim Zorn 12-20 (3-9) 0-0 -101 Mike Shanahan 24-40 (9-15) 0-1 -250 Jay Gruden 35-49-1 (12-21) 0-1 -317 Total 139-185-1 (48-81) 2-5 -784\n\nRead more on the Redskins:\n\nBill Callahan wants the Redskins to focus on the run.
