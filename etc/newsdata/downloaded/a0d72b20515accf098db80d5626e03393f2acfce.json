(Tom Nicholson/Reuters)\n\nThe so-called \u201cExtinction Rebellion\u201d protests \u2014 about which NR\u2019s John Fund has written a first-person account \u2014 are international demonstrations organized by environmentalists hoping to secure radical changes in climate policy.\n\nLondon has been particularly hobbled by the protests: Activists in the English city have climbed atop trains, blocked traffic, and glued themselves to buildings, bringing the city to a standstill as police remove protesters who block the organs of public transit. Commuters, many late to their jobs on account of the protesters, were furious with the delays, as Fund reported, occasionally seeking to displace the protesters themselves without consulting law enforcement. Vigilante justice, sure, but justice nevertheless.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Evening Standard reports that London spent roughly \u00a321 million on policing to quell Extinction\u2019s \u201cAutumn Rebellion.\u201d Perhaps that money could have gone toward environmental causes if the protesters didn\u2019t insist on being such impetuous brats.\n\nMaybe \u2014 a cynical thought, I know \u2014 being impetuous brats is the point.", "description": "The \"Extinction Rebellion\" protests are international demonstrations organized by environmentalists hoping to secure radical changes in climate policy.", "authors": ["John Hirschauer", "Tobias Hoonhout", "Robert Verbruggen", "Andrew C.
