Britain's worst driver, 24, is still on the roads despite racking up 78 points", "language": "en", "text": "Britain's worst driver is still on the road despite having racked up a whopping 78 points over the last four years.\n\nThe 24-year-old man from Bradford in West Yorkshire, who has not been named, tops the list of more than 10,000 drivers who are still behind the wheel despite repeated driving endorsements.\n\nThe second worst driver who is still behind the wheel is a 48-year-old man from Faversham, Kent who has 66 points.\n\nThe country's worst female driver is a 33-year-old from Burnley who has clocked up 49 points.\n\nBritain's worst driver has been revealed to be a 24-year-old man from Bradford in Yorkshire (stock image above)\n\nDrivers are usually banned if they receive 12 points on their licence, despite this 10,858 motorists across Britain have that tally or more - and are still able to drive.\n\nOf those, 261 have a whopping 20 or more points, according to Department for Transport figures.\n\nThe oldest repeat offender is an 81-year-old woman, who is still allowed to drive despite having 25 points on her licence.\n\nThe youngest is a boy, 17, who has racked up 19 points in less than a year of being on the road.\n\nDrivers are usually banned if they receive 12 points on their licence, despite this 10,858 motorists across Britain have that tally or more - and are still able to drive\n\nEndorsement codes and penalty points When driving in the UK you can receive penalty points for various offences. According to the DVLA endorsements stay on your driving record for 4 to 11 years depending on the offence. In certain circumstances defendants convicted of offences like drink driving may be able to have any mandatory period of driving disqualification significantly reduced or totally avoided due to 'special reasons'. Special reasons could include, driving while in an emergency and driving a short distance when the offences were committed. Another example could include the driver having being pulled over for drink driving, having been unaware that their drink had been spiked.\n\nMotorists receive penalty points for a variety of offences, including speeding, dangerous driving and not having insurance.\n\nThe vast majority of offences stay on your licence for four years, apart from causing death or injury by driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n\nThis means it's likely that Britain's worst driver has racked up his 78 points in the last four years.\n\nThe highest number of penalty points a motorist can be slapped with is 11, for causing death by driving under the influence.\n\nThe unnamed worst offender must have committed at least eight driving offences in a four year period - but most likely more.\n\nMotorists can tot up huge points totals - and still be able to drive - if their offence was dealt with by a banning order or prison sentence in court.\n\nAfter serving their time, drivers can reapply for their licence which will still have all of the points they have racked up.\n\nDangerous drivers can also dodge bans by convincing magistrates they will face 'exceptional hardship' if they lose their licence.\n\nIf the motorist or a family member will be seriously affected by a ban, magistrates can waive it.\n\nDo you know the man with 78 points?
