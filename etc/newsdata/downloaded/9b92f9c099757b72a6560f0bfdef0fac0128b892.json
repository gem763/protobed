It showed in the way she moved in the layup line Tuesday night before her Sun defeated the Los Angeles Sparks, 84-75, in Game 1 of their WNBA semifinal series.\n\nShe danced to a song playing over the arena loudspeaker, drawing a laugh from Sun assistant coach Brandi Poole. She went back to perfecting her midrange jump shot, then rushed over to her father, Don, for a hug.\n\n\u201cI love basketball,\u201d Williams said after the game.\n\nHer totals in the box score \u2014 15 points, seven rebounds, five assists, two steals and a block \u2014 don\u2019t make sense from a 5-foot-8 player until you watch her. Even then, the stats underrate her.\n\nJonquel Jones is the Sun\u2019s best player by conventional measure, at 6-6 the team\u2019s leading scorer and the league\u2019s leading rebounder and shot blocker during the regular season. Power forward Alyssa Thomas is the highly skilled facilitator and rebounder. Jasmine Thomas is the veteran playmaker who seemingly always knows where to go with the ball.\n\nWilliams, though, is the show, \u201csince always,\u201d Don Williams said of his daughter, whose jersey is the most popular among fans in the Mohegan Sun Arena stands. \u201cAlways making sure she was best, too.\u201d\n\nThe Sun, seeded second in the eight-team playoffs, has been pointed toward 2019 as its breakthrough year since Curt Miller arrived three years ago as its head coach and general manager. Most on the team speak of the project in careful, clinical terms. But Williams, who ranked second on the team in scoring (13.2 points per game) and assists (3.8) during the regular season, will tell anyone who will listen that the Sun is going to win it all. She is certain of it.\n\n[Barry Svrluga: With a place to call home, these WNBA playoffs could be different for the Mystics]\n\nShe appears set on recruiting believers. The dancing comes first. Tuesday, she darted here and there before the game, taking pictures with fans in the first row on one side of the court, then the other. By the time she left one group, they were moving to the music. The Sun bench was, too, Natisha Hiedeman and Bria Holmes swaying as Williams clapped her approval.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something that\u2019s so magical about her personality, and it\u2019s her positivity,\u201d Miller said. \u201cYou know, every single day she walks in the building, she is going to be positive. And no one loves to play more than her. She just loves the game. And so, you know what is going to happen when you get in between the lines with her. In practice, in games, she just loves the game. And she brings the positivity, which is really important around this team.\u201d\n\nThe belief extended to the game. Williams missed her first four shot attempts. Doesn\u2019t matter, Jasmine Thomas explained. If she had missed her first six shots, she would still be confident she could make the seventh.\n\n\u201cWe feed off that energy,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cAnd I think the fans, our fans, the league, they know that\u2019s the type of person she is. When she\u2019s feeling good and feeling like herself, she gives that energy to us.\u201d\n\nOut of halftime, the Sun trailing 40-37, Williams was all positivity. \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d she shouted, and the Sun complied, hitting a trio of three-pointers, two of them when Williams found Shekinna Stricklen. Williams is a fine scorer, capable of rising above defenders and getting her shot anywhere on the floor, but she has improved her playmaking skills this year as well, with a career-best assist rate of 23.2 and a turnover percentage that has decreased from last year to 10.8.\n\nBut the numbers themselves understate the Courtney Williams effect. Her sense of timing increases her impact, as when, with the score tied at 53 in the third quarter, she hit a baseline jumper at one end then blocked 6-2 Nneka Ogwumike\u2019s shot from behind on the other, forcing Sparks Coach Derek Fisher to take a timeout.\n\n\u201cMan, my teammates want to put the ball in my hand, I\u2019m going to deliver,\u201d Williams said with a smile, her legs splayed in her corner of the Sun locker room. \u201cI\u2019m going to deliver. I mean, that\u2019s all it is. Look, I\u2019m out here trying to win games. Put the ball in my hand, I\u2019m going to do my best to go get a bucket, I\u2019m going to do my best to get a rebound, get a stop. Whatever I\u2019ve got to do for us to win, that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d\n\nShe was at the center of another key moment with about five minutes left and the Sun leading by two, rising among the Sparks\u2019 bigs to grab a rebound at one end and curling around a screen to bury an 18-footer at the other end for a 70-66 advantage. The Sparks would not get as close again.\n\nIn the final minutes with the Sparks hanging tough within 76-70, Williams took the ball up the floor herself and drilled an 18-footer over Riquna Williams to bring the crowd to its feet.\n\nAt the other end, she corralled a Los Angeles miss and drew a foul, then rushed to high-five a fan before heading to the free throw line. Dad was dancing. The fans in the front row were dancing. Everybody was dancing, it seemed.\n\nAfter the horn sounded, Williams was being interviewed on the court, her team five wins away from fulfilling her prediction.\n\n\u201cWe just doing what we do!\u201d she explained, and the crowd roared. She yelled once more: \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d", "description": "The team\u2019s playoff opener was a showcase for the charismatic guard even before the opening tip.", "authors": ["Howard Megdal", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/luNJhDFvFrGwoS5Km2-XlIgq7bQ=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VIHYATG2LYI6TLDDGALHCFKD7Y.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
