He said both Ator and the company called 911 after being fired Saturday but that Ator was gone by the time police showed up. FBI special agent Christopher Combs says Ator\u2019s statements on the phone were \u201crambling.\u201d\n\nAuthorities said Ator killed seven people and injured at least 22 others Saturday before officers killed him outside a busy movie theater in Odessa.\n\nOnline court records show Ator was arrested in 2001 for a misdemeanor offense that would not have prevented him from legally purchasing firearms in Texas, although authorities have not said where Ator got the \u201cAR style\u201d weapon he used.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott tweeted Monday that \u201cwe must keep guns out of criminals\u2019 hands\u201d \u2013 words similar to his remarks that followed another mass shooting in El Paso on Aug. 3, when he said firearms must be kept from \u201cderanged killers.\u201d But Abbott, a Republican and avid gun rights supporter, has been noncommittal about tightening Texas gun laws.\n\nHe also tweeted that Ator failed a previous gun background check and didn\u2019t go through one for the weapon he used in Odessa. He did not elaborate, and a spokesman referred questions to the Texas Department of Public Safety, which didn\u2019t immediately respond for comment.\n\nAuthorities said those killed were between 15 and 57 years old but did not immediately provide a list of names. Family and employers, however, said that among the dead were Edwin Peregrino, 25, who ran out of his parents\u2019 home to see what the commotion was; mail carrier Mary Granados, 29, slain in her U.S. Postal Service truck; and 15-year-old high school student Leilah Hernandez, who was walking out of an auto dealership.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Police say gunman called police and FBI after being fired from his job and shortly before mass shooting in West Texas.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/02/aptopix_shooting_texas_50039_c0-202-4838-3022_s1770x1032.jpg?f4ceb50fac8ce02aed05849c2835265d5a47d60c"}
