Matt Gaetz.\n\nOne of these kangaroos is not like the other.\n\nAs Democrats press forward with their impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, one of his top allies in Congress on Tuesday likened House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff to a sinister version of the classic children\u2019s-television character:\n\n\u2018What we see in this impeachment is a kangaroo court and Chairman Schiff is acting like a malicious Captain Kangaroo.\u2019 Rep.

Schiff also said Tuesday that Sondland\u2019s failure to testify was \u201cstrong evidence of obstruction\u201d by the administration.\n\nTrump didn\u2019t use a children\u2019s-television-character nickname for Schiff but has frequently mocked the congressman and even suggested he be arrested.\n\nNow read: How one liddle\u2019 tweet from Trump turned into a viral, real-time grammar lesson", "description": "As Democrats press forward with their impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, one of his top allies in Congress on Tuesday likened House...", "authors": ["Robert Schroeder", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS880_captai_ZG_20191008125801.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
