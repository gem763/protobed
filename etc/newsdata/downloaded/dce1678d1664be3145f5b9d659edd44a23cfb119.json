They say Abu Walid was the head of the organization Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISIS-GS), which claimed responsibility for the attack on Oct. 4, 2017, against a joint U.S.-Nigerien patrol near the village of Tongo Tongo.\n\nThe State Department is offering $5 million for information leading to Abu Walid and another $5 million for information leading to the arrest or conviction in any country of any individual who \u201ccommitted, conspired to commit or aided or abetted in the commission of the 2017\u201d attack.\n\nU.S. State Department\n\nStaff Sgt. Bryan C. Black, Staff Sgt. Dustin M. Wright, Staff Sgt. Jeremiah W. Johnson and Sgt. La David Johnson died during the ambush. The soldiers were accompanying a platoon of Nigerien soldiers when they were attacked by a group of about 120 ISIS-affiliated fighters close to the border with Mali.\n\nA military investigation previously found that the mission in Niger was not approved by the proper authorities and that the soldiers there were not trained for that specific mission.\n\n\u201cI take ownership for all the events connected to the ambush of 4 October,\u201d said General Thomas Waldhauser, the commander of U.S. Africa Command at a May 2018 Pentagon news conference. \u201cAgain, the responsibility is mine.\u201d\n\nGaston De Cardenas/AFP/Getty Images\n\nEarlier this year, families blasted the decision to not punish higher-ranking officers in the Niger ambush after learning there would be no further disciplinary action for Army officials other than letters of reprimand.\n\n\"I don't see how people in the direct chain of command are being promoted when it was their decision to override the ground commander (who) was instrumental in my son's death,\u201d Arnold Wright, the father of Green Beret Staff Sgt. Wright said.\n\nABC News' Conor Finnegan and Luis Martinez contributed to this report.", "description": "The State Department is offering up $10 million for information on the leader of the terrorist group responsible for the 2017 attack in Niger.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/niger-gty-er-191005_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
