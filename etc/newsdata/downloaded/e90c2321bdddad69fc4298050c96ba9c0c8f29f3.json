Plastic pollution has become so widespread that we may be inhaling up to 130 tiny pieces a day, research found. Fibres from fleece and polyester clothing and particles from urban dust and car tyres are the biggest sources of so-called microplastics in the air. Microplastics are small plastic pellets ranging in size from 0.5 millimetres that have accumulated in the marine environment following decades of pollution. They include polyester fibres generated from laundry The tiny specks are lighter than air and could cause asthma, heart disease and auto-immune conditions, the research, published in December 2017, found. The study, a review of a number of recent plastics studies, revealed washing a single polyester garment can produce 1,900 plastic fibres. Plastic pollution has become so widespread that we may be inhaling up to 130 tiny pieces a day, research found (stock image) This plastic pollution is on the rise as more and more synthetic clothing is produced. While only people working with plastic fibres are known to develop respiratory problems, experts say the pollution is so widespread that it may now pose a risk to everyone's health. The study's author, Dr Joana Correia Prata, of Fernando Pessoa University in Portugal, said: 'The evidence suggests that an individual's lungs could be exposed to between 26 and 130 airborne microplastics a day, which would pose a risk for human health, especially in susceptible individuals, including children. 'Exposure may cause asthma, cardiac disease, allergies and auto-immune diseases.'\n\n\n\n", "description": "Experts found large volumes of tan, yellow and green bands among pellets regurgitated by birds on the rocky outpost off the Cornish coast.", "authors": ["Colin Fernadez For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/00/wire-20060248-1571785590-406_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
