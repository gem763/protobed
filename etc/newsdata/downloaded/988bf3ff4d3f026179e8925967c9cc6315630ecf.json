Argentina, a two-time semifinalist, is now an established force and has only improved since joining the Rugby Championship in 2012 and having a team - the Jaguares - in Super Rugby. France, a three-time finalist, is typically inconsistent but has talented players throughout the side.\n\nHere\u2019s a closer look at Pool C, which also features Tonga and the United States:\n\nARGENTINA\n\nCoach: Mario Ledesma\n\nCaptain: Pablo Matera\n\nBest RWC Performance: 2007: Beat France in the bronze-medal playoff.\n\nLast 5 RWCs: 2015-SF, \u201811-QF, \u201807-3rd, \u201803-Group Stage, 1999-QF.\n\nOutlook: The run of the Jaguares - a team featuring the bulk of the Argentine national team - to the Super Rugby final for the first time points the growing cohesiveness of the Pumas\u2019 class of 2019 and should be a concern for England and France. Sprinkle in the talents of Niolas Sanchez at flyhalf and there is a chance they can go deep at the World Cup. Argentina has finished in last place in seven of eight editions since it joined the Rugby Championship, however, indicating that the team should still be considered an outsider.\n\nPlayers to watch: Pablo Matera wears the armband and is a hulking presence in Argentina\u2019s fearsome back row with plenty of power, great hands and a super offload. Sanchez, one of just three European-based players in the squad, masterminded the Pumas\u2019 run to the semifinals in 2015 with his ball-playing skills at 10 and is the country\u2019s leading scorer. Juan Manuel Leguizamon, a 36-year-old loose forward, will become the fourth Argentine to play in four Rugby World Cups.\n\nENGLAND\n\nCoach: Eddie Jones\n\nCaptain: Owen Farrell\n\nBest RWC Performance: 2003: Beat Australia in extra time in the final.\n\nLast 5 RWCs: 2015-Group, \u201811-QF, \u201807-F, \u201803-W, 1999-QF.\n\nOutlook: Until last year, England looked to be New Zealand\u2019s biggest rival heading into the World Cup, but the last 18 months have asked some questions of Eddie Jones and his style of management. Some big-name players have been discarded over the past year - Chris Robshaw, Dylan Hartley and Mike Brown, for example, have fallen by the wayside - but Jones appears to have found some new blood to strengthen the team and warm-up wins over Wales and Ireland were encouraging. The English have the ability and strength in depth to be world champion again, but are they strong enough mentally? Even Jones isn\u2019t sure.\n\nPlayers to watch: England usually struggles when Owen Farrell isn\u2019t on his game, so the team\u2019s fortunes might hinge on the goal-kicker who will play at center if Jones decides to select George Ford at flyhalf. Lock is a strong suit for the English - they have four top-class options in that position - and the marauding Maro Itoje is the best of the bunch. Billy Vunipola gives England go-forward in the loose and will be a critical member of the pack, provided the injury-plagued No. 8 can stay fit.\n\nFRANCE\n\nCoach: Jacques Brunel\n\nCaptain: Guilhem Guirado\n\nBest RWC Performance: 1987, \u201899, 2011: Runners-up.\n\nLast 5 RWCs: 2015-QF, \u201811-F, \u201807-4th, \u201803-4th, 1999-F.\n\nOutlook: France\u2019s World Cup record is extraordinary - the team has only failed to get beyond the quarterfinals in two of the competition\u2019s eight editions - but it will be a struggle for the French to even get out of the group stage this year. Now ranked a lowly No. 8, they haven\u2019t finished higher than third in the Six Nations since 2011 and Jacques Brunel will depart after the World Cup after one of the more forgettable coaching tenures. A lack of discipline and an inability to cope under pressure, especially in tight game, are the biggest problems facing the French, who start and finish against Argentina and England, respectively.\n\nPlayers to watch: Can Romain Ntamack be the answer to France\u2019s long-time woes at flyhalf? The son of Emile Ntamack, one of the finest wingers France has produced, the 20-year-old Romain has great composure for a young player and is both a good tackler and kicker while offering a better running game than Camille Lopez. Ntamack can also slot in at center. In a powerful pack, Jefferson Poirot is one of the best looseheads in the world.\n\nTONGA\n\nCoach: Toutai Kefu\n\nCaptain: Siale Piutau\n\nBest RWC Performance: Eliminated in the pool stage in all seven appearances.\n\nLast 5 RWCs: 2015-Group, \u201811-Group, \u201807-Group, \u201803-Group, 1999-Group.\n\nOutlook: Tonga has never advanced from the pool stage in seven attempts at the World Cup and it looks beyond the team this year. The \u2018Ikale Tahi\u2019 have never beaten Argentina or England, although hopes of defeating France will be raised by two previous wins over the French, including in Wellington at the 2011 World Cup. Under former Australia No. 8 Toutai Kefu, Tonga has beaten Italy away since the last World Cup but a recent 41-7 loss to Japan in Pacific Nations Cup does not bode well for next month.\n\nPlayers to watch: Fullback Telusa Veainu, a former New Zealand under-20 international, is the star among the back division and was voted the best player in the English league in 2018 following performances for Leicester Tigers. The captain, Nasi Manu, was diagnosed with testicular cancer in October last year and missed the rest of the season for Italian club Benetton Treviso to undertake chemotherapy. He was given the all-clear to start physical activity again in April and Tonga\u2019s pool opener against England will mark his return to international rugby.\n\nUNITED STATES\n\nCoach: Gary Gold\n\nCaptain: Blaine Scully\n\nBest RWC Performance: Eliminated in the pool stage in all seven appearances.\n\nLast 5 RWCs: 2015-Group, \u201811-Group, \u201807-Group, \u201803-Group, 1999-Group.\n\nOutlook: The 2019 World Cup might be another learning experience for the Eagles, who have arguably the toughest pool and will be without one of their star players of the past decade following the shock recent international retirement of flanker Samu Manoa. After losing all four pool match in 2015, the U.S. team has a record of three wins in 22 World Cup matches and looks capable of only winning one of its four games in this edition - against Tonga in Osaka on Oct. 13.\n\nPlayers to watch: Flanker Ben Pinkelman and winger Martin Iosefo were members of the United States\u2019 sevens squad that recently qualified for next year\u2019s Olympic Games, also taking place in Japan, and are making the step-up to 15s for the World Cup.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "With England, Argentina and France seemingly battling it out for the two qualification spots, Pool C of the Rugby World Cup is only group in the tournament featuring three of the sport's heavyweight teams.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steve Douglas"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/13/france_macron_rugby_96168_c0-229-5472-3419_s1770x1032.jpg?6f9ce78ee1a3a25672569ab4bf84dc3559d8855e", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
