Most of Puerto Rico\u2019s defunded projects were related to hurricane recovery at military bases.\n\nOther big losers are Virginia, where two warehouses for hazardous materials and a ship maintenance facility are on the list of cuts; New York, where an engineering center and a parking structure at West Point will take a hit; and New Mexico, where an information systems facility and a special operations center are on the chopping block.", "description": "Trump has treated the Pentagon budget as sacrosanct, unless he can raid it to pay for his wall.", "authors": ["The Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/09/opinion/09pentagon-print/076pentagon1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
