In New York, the protests began at Foley Square with the marchers eventually making their way to Battery Park. We asked the photographer Bryan Thomas, who has covered the effects of sea-level rise in his home state of Florida, to document the event and he decided to set up a mini studio in the heart of the protests in downtown New York and photograph and speak to the young people marching. These are the results.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Bryan Thomas/The Guardian\n\nErin McGrath\n\nAge: 17\n\nWhat scares you most about climate change?\n\nRising sea levels. We joke on Long Island that eventually we\u2019ll be have no place to live but we don\u2019t want it to happen too soon.\n\nWhy are you marching?\n\nI recently realized how important it is to participate. I wanted to make my voice heard even in this small way.\n\nBridget Williams\n\nAge: 30\n\nWhat scares you most about climate change?\n\nThe future. We are in a frightening place. I fear the most for the animals.\n\nWhy are you marching?\n\nDoing the most that I can do as an individual that can impact change. It\u2019s inspiring. I always wanted for there to be a massive impact and change. To see the youth have the will to do it is inspiring.\n\nRachel Zimmerman-Diaz\n\nAge: 18\n\nWhat scares you most about climate change?\n\nIn the system where we live now, we don\u2019t feel any of the externalities of the products we are consuming. It\u2019s okay to be ignorant until you know the harm that our consumption yields and then there\u2019s no excuse. If you do nothing, then you are seeing yourself as above someone.\n\nWhy are you marching?\n\nI have the choice to be here, when there are people that don\u2019t, that can\u2019t speak for these issues even though they are the ones being most adversely effected by them. If I care about this and I don\u2019t come here, what is the point?\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Bryan Thomas/The Guardian\n\nStella Grossenbacher and Danielle Rembert\n\nAge: 9 and 48\n\nWhat scares you most about climate change?\n\nDanielle: Plastic. Plastic is something that never disappears. Almost everything else is biodegradable. Plastic breaks into small pieces. It gets into our body. It destroys the ecosystem of the world. I fear plastic more than the heat because I can visualize it.\n\nWhy are you marching?\n\nDanielle: Because we know it\u2019s a very urgent problem. I don\u2019t think marching solves the problem but it gives you energy and a sense of community. I don\u2019t think it will change anything fundamentally. If everyone does something little every day that can help more than marching.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Bryan Thomas/The Guardian\n\nCecilia Innis\n\nAge: 19\n\nWhat scares you most about climate change?\n\nWe are already seeing the effects. Poor black and brown communities are already affected the most. It is hurting marginalized people. The people that can\u2019t leave when hurricanes come for them.\n\nWhy are you marching?\n\nThere is power in numbers. Personally, I can\u2019t be an advocate for social justice and not be a part of this.\n\nOzi Hidalgo Balareco\n\nAge: 28\n\nWhat scares you most about climate change?\n\nThe possibility that a lot of people will be left without homes and have no place to go. And there\u2019s very little empathy from people in a position to help.\n\nWhy are you marching?\n\nIt\u2019s important to be present. It\u2019s important to be part of the movement. And if you believe that climate change will effect all of us, you need to make your voice heard.\n\nUma Natarajan\n\nAge: 23\n\nWhat scares you most about climate change?\n\nThe fact that my children won\u2019t be able to have the same opportunities that I had. We are already experiencing the effects of past generations\u2019 actions. I\u2019m afraid that my future children won\u2019t be able to have like access to clean water and being able to have three meals a day.\n\nWhy are you marching?\n\nI\u2019m angry. We\u2019ve been feeling the effects of climate change. There are no policies to make a difference. Politicians can say whatever they want, but they don\u2019t have policies to back those actions. There is no plan.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Bryan Thomas/The Guardian\n\nKaity Jia\n\nAge: 21\n\nWhat scares you most about climate change?\n\nWe are in a nightmare scenario right now. If we don\u2019t act fast, there will be a lot of chaos and people suffering. I don\u2019t want us to have to fight for our lives.\n\nWhy are you marching?\n\nThis is something that I\u2019ve supported my whole life: preserving the environment. A lot of young people who share this sentiment are now the ones who will be seeing the effects of climate change. We are young. We will have to live through this. We will have to live through natural disasters and rising sea levels. It\u2019s already happened in Puerto Rico and the Bahamas. Scientists have predicted this and there will be storms coming.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Bryan Thomas/The Guardian\n\nMichael Gibbons\n\nAge: 19\n\nWhat scares you most about climate change?\n\nThe fact that the effects will be catastrophic and happen in our lifetime.\n\nWhy are you marching?\n\nTo be a part of this change. To be with other people, to get the word going out. When you see other people that have the same mindset as yourself, it will inspire you to impact people who aren\u2019t so aware.\n\nAngelina Tromcoso\n\nAge: 17\n\nWhat scares you most about climate change?\n\nWe are just sitting here and doing nothing. If we don\u2019t say anything it\u2019s just going to get worse and worse. I don\u2019t even think there will be a world.\n\nWhy are you marching?\n\nI was moved when I saw the buzz on social media. Then the school was encouraging us. When my teacher told me that, \u201cthe future is in your hands\u201d, I was really moved by that.\n\nNora Diede\n\nAge: 17\n\nWhat scares you most about climate change?\n\nThe fact that our entire world is going to completely die. It\u2019s petrifying to think about. Our children won\u2019t be able to experience he same things we had.\n\nWhy are you marching?\n\nI\u2019m marching because the youth need to take over. The adults aren\u2019t failing us, but they aren\u2019t doing everything they could. It\u2019s important to fight for this cause.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Bryan Thomas/The Guardian\n\nSeren Roberts\n\nAge: 10\n\nWhat scares you most about climate change?\n\nIt\u2019s that people and animals will get hurt if we don\u2019t make a change. And trees will start dying and we need the air.\n\nWhy are you marching?\n\nBecause I don\u2019t want anyone to get hurt.\n\nRaadiya Shardow\n\nAge: 18\n\nWhat scares you most about climate change?\n\nIt will affect everyone. Those who care and those who don\u2019t. The future seems bleak and hopeless but we can create change. This will effect everyone regardless of race, age, socioeconomic status; it is actually very unifying in that way.\n\nWhy are you marching?\n\nI want to be able to tell my kids that I cared. I want to see a future where my grandkids can play outside, drink water, be healthy and happy. If this is destroyed, we have nowhere else to go.\n\nSophie Anderson\n\nAge: 16\n\nWhat scares you most about climate change?\n\nThe effects that we are already seeing. The reality is that we are seeing effects right now. An example is Hurricane Dorian. This is what is happening. These people don\u2019t have a voice; we need to elevate them.\n\nWhy are you marching?\n\nFor the people whose stories aren\u2019t being told. For my future. For my friends\u2019 future.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Bryan Thomas/The Guardian\n\nAidan Aroubas\n\nAge: 15\n\nWhat scares you most about climate change?\n\nNo matter how much we protest it, nothing ever gets done about it. Someone might become vegan or start recycling, but you won\u2019t see a company do something.\n\nWhy are you marching?\n\nI\u2019m taking a stand. If we don\u2019t get a critical mass, there won\u2019t be anything done. It won\u2019t be taken seriously.", "description": "Photographer Bryan Thomas took portraits of the people participating in the climate strike in New York Friday", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a869ee2c0a1fe699ceacdf3b4d1b2541edf6d932/0_55_3048_1831/master/3048.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e8598a8c8563d09c3ef5529681bfa6ba", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
