It was a monkey, a big one,\u201d she told US news outlet KVUE.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. First monkey clones Show all 7 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

However, no visual proof from any authorities. No pictures. No videos.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will continue to treat this as a serious matter unless confirmed otherwise for [the] safety of the residents in the area.\u201d\n\nThe service also issued a checklist for how citizens should respond if they encounter the creature:\n\nDo not approach, chase or try and catch a primate if you have sighted said loose monkey.\n\nTake a picture and call animal control ASAP. The picture is to verify what type of monkey this is. Knowing the type will keep this monkey safe if it needs to be tranquilised.\n\nDo not go searching for the monkey. Extra people looking for this animal is going to cause a risk of someone getting hurt.\n\nA team that is certified in dealing with primates is on the ground now helping us locate the animal. Do not interfere. Do not attempt to help. They are professionals and know what they are doing.\n\nPlease do not call animal control or the police station with false statements you yourself are unable to verify. This is not helpful to the authorities or to the animal.\n\nGreg Boody, a police spokesman, said in a statement: \u201cI\u2019m not saying that there is no monkey, in fact, I\u2019m sure there is one on the loose.
