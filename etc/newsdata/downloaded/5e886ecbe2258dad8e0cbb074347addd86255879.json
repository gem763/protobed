And your silence is supporting him in not standing up,\u201d Amy Haskins, an Iowa resident, said.\n\n\u201cWhere is the line? When are you guys going to say \u2018Enough,\u2019 and stand up and say, \u2018You know what? I\u2019m not backing any of this.\u201d\n\nMs Ernst replied: \u201cThe president is going to say what the president is going to do.\u201d\n\nSome senators, conscious of widespread support for Mr Trump among Republicans, have struck a more cautious note.\n\nMarco Rubio, the senator for Florida, dismissed the president\u2019s China comments as a joke.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a real request or him just needling the press, knowing that you guys were going to get outraged by it,\u201d he told a group of journalists.\n\nThe silence from most Republicans have angered Democrats, who believe the president\u2019s behaviour constitutes a brazen abuse of power.\n\n\u201cMy Republican colleagues\u2019 silence seems unsustainable and inexcusable, given the threat to our national security as well as the integrity of our democratic institutions,\u201d said Richard Blumenthal, the senator for Connecticut.\n\nDuring the Senate stage of an impeachment process, senators conduct a trial presided over by the Supreme Court\u2019s chief justice.\n\nIf two-thirds of senators find the president guilty of impeachable offences, he is removed and the vice president replaces him.\n\nNo US president has ever been removed from office through the impeachment and conviction process.", "description": "Republican senators\u00a0are becoming increasingly unnerved by Donald Trump\u2019s conduct, as national support for impeachment rises.
