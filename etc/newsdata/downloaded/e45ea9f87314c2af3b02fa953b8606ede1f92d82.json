The department announced in July it would relocate the headquarters of the Bureau of Land Management to Colorado, saying it would lead to better decisions and save money, but some retired federal employees dispute that. (Alex Brandon/AP)\n\nColumnist\n\nNearly all of the Interior Department\u2019s Bureau of Land Management\u2019s employees are based outside the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nSo why are agency leaders pushing for more to leave Washington to set up a new headquarters in Colorado?\n\nIs it bureaucratic efficiency or an efficient way to cull federal employees and shrink the government?\n\nThese issues were raised by skeptical Democrats and supportive Republicans at a House Natural Resources Committee hearing Tuesday. Many Democrats were just as skeptical after answers from William Perry Pendley, the bureau\u2019s deputy director for policy and programs, while Republicans welcomed his answers to their leading and sympathetic questions.\n\nPendley acknowledged that 97 percent of the bureau\u2019s employees already work away from the District. But apparently that is not enough for the Trump administration. Relocating hundreds more would result in \u201ca number of significant benefits,\u201d he said, \u201cranging from more informed decision-making to increased efficiency and coordination. This realignment is an important undertaking that is long overdue.\u201d\n\nA total of 550 positions were evaluated for a possible move to the western United States, where most of the agency action is. Of that, 222 employees \u201ccurrently performing headquarters duties\u201d would continue that work, he said, while based throughout \u201cBLM\u2019s western regions and landscapes in order to optimize the BLM\u2019s presence where the needs are greatest.\u201d Another 74 would work in state offices.\n\nTwenty-seven others, including the agency\u2019s director, deputy director of operations and assistant directors, would establish a new headquarters in Grand Junction, Colo. Some positions, such as the agency\u2019s congressional staff, would remain in Washington.\n\n\u201cToday, the BLM faces a stark choice,\u201d Pendley told the committee. \u201cEither it must relocate most of its positions and personnel to state offices and a new headquarters in Grand Junction, Colorado, or it must consolidate into limited and costly space in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area.\u201d\n\nThe costly space in Washington is $50 per square foot, compared to $32.35 in Grand Junction, he said. There also would be lower travel expenses and personnel costs.\n\nBut Democrats see a hidden, more sinister message.\n\n\u201cThis proposal is a continuation of the Trump administration\u2019s effort to \u2018drain the swamp,\u2019 which in reality is an attempt to push out career employees and weaken federal agencies,\u201d said Rep. Paul Tonko (D-N.Y.). \u201cThis is a dangerous move: one that not only disrespects federal employees and their dedication to public service, but also threatens to rid federal agencies of institutional knowledge and devoted civil servants.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not just the talk of a partisan critic. Tonko\u2019s comments follow those by President Trump\u2019s top manager, Mick Mulvaney. He\u2019s Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff and director of the White House Office of Management and Budget.\n\n\u201cIt's nearly impossible to fire a federal worker,\u201d Mulvaney told a South Carolina Republican gathering last month. \u201cI know that because a lot of them work for me, and I've tried. . . . By simply saying to people, \u2018You know what, we're going to take you outside the bubble, outside the Beltway, outside this liberal haven of Washington, D.C., and move you out in the real part of the country,\u2019 and they quit \u2014 what a wonderful way to sort of streamline government, and do what we haven't been able to do for a long time.\u201d\n\nMany did quit the Agriculture Department after it announced plans to move two agencies to Kansas City. Almost 60 percent of Agriculture\u2019s Economic Research Service and more than two-thirds of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture refused their reassignments, according to department information released in July.\n\nRather than \u201ca wonderful way to . . . streamline government,\u201d this represents a loss of talent and institutional knowledge that could harm service to the public for years to come.\n\nRepresenting the District, Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D) has good reason to keep the workforce in town. On Monday, she announced plans for legislation that would require congressional approval for the relocation of federal agency headquarters outside of the National Capital Region, which includes Washington and suburban areas.\n\n\u201cI have already gotten some language in appropriations bills to deter politically motivated moves outside the nation\u2019s capital,\u201d she said. \u201cThese unprecedented moves are not about saving taxpayer money and usually have origins in inaccurate political talking points. In the 1990s, the BLM moved its wildfire staff out West, only to move them back when Congress demanded briefings on new wildfires.\u201d\n\nThe plan to move even more of the bureau from Washington drew strong opposition at the hearing from the Public Lands Foundation, a nonprofit organization comprised mostly of retired agency employees.\n\n\u201cWhile the BLM has encountered several calls for reorganization over more than seven decades, none has raised as much concern for us as this one,\u201d said Ed Shepard, president of the foundation. \u201cWe believe this plan would require the BLM to serve the short-term wants of locally powerful stakeholders to the detriment of all other constituents and the long-term needs of the public lands. The breakup of the Washington office structure would ensure the BLM promotes parochial, local interests, rather than the national interest.\u201d\n\nThe result of the move, Shepard added, \u201cwould functionally dismantle the BLM.\u201d", "description": "The Bureau of Land Management says having more of its employees out west would improve decision-making and save money.", "authors": ["Joe Davidson", "Columnist Focusing On Federal Government Issues", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Pa2BcrkWhvb23t3UA56UjXU9Cws=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/43WNQXGUDYI6TFQQ7NLMKURODQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
