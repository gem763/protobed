At the moment, I think in both counts, business is lagging behind both the rate of change of opportunity and the rate of change of threat, and the risk function has a huge part to play in matching those paces, and accelerating to match those paces.\u201d\n\nKPMG Australia's Zoe Willis. Jeremy Piper\n\nFor Mr Eadie, the traditional view of risk is of \u201cmultiplying probability and impact of a potential event to get the risk effect: if the benefit is greater than the risk, then you do it, and if the benefit is less than the risk, then you don't.\n\n\u201cThat's the traditional view. But the more modern view is that the risk function gives the organisation the insight that allows the business to place the right bet. You have to take the right risk at the right time, in the right place, in the right way and use data to give you the information that tells you what is the right risk, what is the right place, when is the right time, and what is the right way. And you can only do that through data,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut we've only been existing in the data world for a couple of decades.\u201d\n\nZoe Willis, KPMG Partner, Data and RegTech, said the pace of change is demonstrated by what is now commonplace.\n\n\u201cFive years ago, would we have sat here and talked about using facial recognition, and voice analytics? No, but they\u2019re now very relevant.\n\n\u201cWill it be different in five years? Absolutely. As professionals, we always need to think about how do we disrupt ourselves, because we need to be anticipating that change.\u201d\n\nKevin Smout, KPMG global lead, risk strategy & technology and global lead, governance, risk and assurance, said the firm is experiencing this itself, with its risk hub product, which takes in all of the operational data of a business, data on the external environment and factors that affect the business, and uses augmented reality to create a 3D picture of the organisation\u2019s risk.\n\n\u201cWith that 3D picture, you can actually grab hold of a risk as a bubble and squeeze it to make it smaller, or expand it to make it big, and watch that contagion flow,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s taken us six months to have a prototype operating, and with the pace of change in technology and the rate of change, I could see within six months that that will be a market for us.\n\n\u201cAnd in two years, it will be common for people in boardrooms to be having discussions based on the risk hub: for example, a mining client might say, \u2018We're actually focusing on a different mineral now. What does that do to our environment from a risk and opportunity perspective?\u2019\u201d\n\nWhile models are \u201conly as good as what you put in,\u201d Mr Smout sees the risk hub as a decision-making tool.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a way to take the external signals, from an industry perspective and the market, and combine it with the organisation\u2019s own data, and blend them into a live model that informs the experienced executives around the table, and on which they can make decisions.\u201d\n\nThe point, he says, is to get directors, front-line, risk and investment all on the same page, and \u201cenrich the dialogue\u201d around risk.\n\nAnd this is where risk should be, at the heart of the strategic direction, according to Jason Smith, board director at the Risk Management Institute of Australasia.\n\n\u201cI actually think the most successful risk functions don\u2019t use the word \u2018risk\u2019 \u2013 they talk about the opportunity as what really matters, and then, from a risk appetite perspective, is \u2018what is our willingness to lose in this particular strategy\u2019.\n\n\u201cWhen you change that lexicon and change that thinking \u2013 along with harnessing the technologies \u2013 that's when risk can really start to offer value,\u201d Mr Smith concluded.", "description": "The velocity of technological change represents one of the biggest threats to today\u2019s businesses.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3619%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_37/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/672d96714778e4eabd494b6f2edcbb5367039156", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
