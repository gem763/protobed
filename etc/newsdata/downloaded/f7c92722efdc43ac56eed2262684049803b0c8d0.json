I used to think, \u2018When I grow up, I\u2019m a gonna be rich and I\u2019m going to make a lot of money and I could make a lot of 10 cents and a lot of 25 cents.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s made a lot more than that as superstar singer and now fashion and beauty mogul, and with her Clara Lionel Foundation has doled out money around the globe to help support education programs, women\u2019s health and emergency response organizations for people in need.\n\nThe foundation named after Rihanna\u2019s grandparents raised more than $5 million Thursday night. Cardi B and Offset, A$AP Rocky, Karlie Kloss, DJ Khaled, 21 Savage, Pharrell Williams and others came out to support the glittering charity dinner, which even featured an impromptu performance by Rihanna and Williams.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a fan of her energy. She has a beautiful soul,\u201d DJ Khaled said before entering the event at Cipriani\u2019s in downtown Manhattan with his pregnant wife. \u201cIn my book, she keeps it mad real . It\u2019s just a beautiful day, we\u2019re putting beautiful energy out there.\u201d\n\nIt was the second all-star event Rihanna staged this week. Khaled, Halsey and more turned out for her New York Fashion Week show on Tuesday, an extravaganza for her lingerie line Savage X Fenty that featured musical performances along with a catwalk.\n\nThe star wowed on the red carpet dressed in a black velvet turtleneck dress with a flared skirt.\n\n\u201cJust glam. She\u2019s so glamorous, she\u2019s so gorgeous. Anytime I think of Rihanna, I just think of just glam,\u201d said rapper Megan Thee Stallion.\n\nRihanna told the crowd she was \u201chumbled\u201d by the support for Clara Lionel, and noted that her grandmother Clara Brathwaite, who died seven years ago, would tell her helping others is \u201cabout the collective joining forces.\u201d\n\nShe told the AP her connection to her grandparents makes the event a sentimental one.\n\n\u201cSo these things get really personal, emotional, and I just want to expand this every year to a different cause because I don\u2019t feel like people deserve to be left out and that that\u2019s really the core of the foundation,\u201d she said.\n\nInside the event, which started two hours late and was hosted by Seth Meyers, stars mingled in a hall that was decorated with a tropical, colorful motif. A$AP Rocky, recently freed after a legal battle in Sweden that saw him behind bars there for weeks, held court at one table as he chatted with 2 Chainz and others; Cardi B bid a very exact $109,000 for a rare copy of a book on Rihanna, along with a two-thousand pound marble stand designed to hold it.\n\nThe night was not without some controversy: One of the honorees, activist and journalist Shaun King, has been accused of mishandling money he claims he\u2019s received for various causes he supports. The Clara Lionel Foundation was almost immediately met with backlash after it was announced King would be a Diamond Ball honoree, forcing King to release a 72-page report in an attempt to defend himself against the allegations.\n\nThe foundation\u2019s executive director stood by the decision to honor King, who has been a supporter of Clara Lionel.\n\n\u201cWe decided to honor Shaun King for a reason, and we decided to honor Shaun King for that same reason tonight,\u201d said Justine Lucas, executive director of the foundation.\n\nKing, who defended himself on Twitter just before the event, did not address the allegations as he accepted his honor, instead imploring the crowd to work harder to fight injustice: \u201cIt\u2019s not good enough to have good intentions.\u201d\n\nCardi B stood up for King just before the event.\n\n\u201cOne of the main reasons why is so important for me to be here is because Rihanna is honoring Shaun King. A lot of people need to follow Shaun King on Instagram. He protests so much for all minorities, he protests so much for the whole entire world,\u201d said the Grammy-award winning rapper.\n\nAlso honored was Mia Mottley, the prime minister of Barbados, where Rihanna was born. Mottley is the first woman to ascend to the position, and Rihanna personally presented her with an award.\n\nMottley said no matter how global Rihanna is, she always brings Barbados with her.\n\n\u201cRihanna is one of our citizens of whom we are very, very proud,\u201d Mottley said. \u201cWhen you come from 166 square miles and you can produce people who make a global impact, it gives your heart a certain amount of warmth.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Entertainment Writer Nekesa Mumbi Moody contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Like many kids, Rihanna dreamed of someday growing up to be rich, but helping others was at the forefront of her vision.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Gary Gerard Hamilton"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/13/2019_diamond_ball_benefit_gala_87851_c0-162-3875-2421_s1770x1032.jpg?df07c91ebfae60bd13575492ad3867aae8ef3b7e", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
