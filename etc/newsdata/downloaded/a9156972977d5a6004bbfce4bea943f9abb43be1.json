(Eve Edelheit/Bloomberg)\n\nCNN said Thursday that it will not run two Trump campaign ads because they disparage the network\u2019s journalists and make \u201cdemonstrably false\u201d claims while discussing impeachment and pushing unsubstantiated allegations of corruption against former vice president Joe Biden.\n\nThe network\u2019s decisions come as the Trump administration escalates its attacks on congressional Democrats\u2019 impeachment efforts and continues to lash out at media organizations it tries to discredit as \u201cfake news.\u201d CNN\u2019s move brought renewed ire from Trump\u2019s reelection campaign, as communications director Tim Murtaugh called the news network a \u201cDemocrat public relations firm\u201d that \u201cspends all day protecting Joe Biden.\u201d\n\nThe first rejected ad, posted last week to YouTube, suggests that the president is being unfairly scrutinized for pressing Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son Hunter. The ad accuses Trump\u2019s potential 2020 opponent of corruption, continuing a favorite talking point of Trump and his supporters amid an impeachment inquiry and concerns Trump used his office to create trouble for a political rival.\n\n[A quick guide to Trump\u2019s false claims about Ukraine and the Bidens]\n\nThe 30-second commercial claims that Biden promised Ukraine $1 billion to fire a prosecutor looking into \u201chis son\u2019s company.\u201d Hunter Biden sat on the board of energy firm Burisma but does not own it and while Biden was key in the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to remove Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin using U.S. aid as leverage, no evidence indicates that Biden sought to help his son. Widely criticized for his handling of corruption cases, Shokin was eventually voted out of office.\n\nThe ad goes on to criticize another common Trump target, accusing \u201cmedia lap dogs\u201d of aiding Democrats\u2019 impeachment efforts. It depicts prominent journalists bashed by Trump: CNN hosts Don Lemon and Chris Cuomo, White House correspondent Jim Acosta and MSNBC host Rachel Maddow.\n\nCNN said in a statement that \u201cin addition to disparaging CNN and its journalists, the ad makes assertions that have been proven demonstrably false by various news outlets, including CNN.\u201d\n\nMurtaugh maintained that the Biden ad is accurate and was \u201creviewed by counsel.\u201d\n\nAnother 30-second video titled \u201cCoup\u201d and released Wednesday has been rejected as well, CNN said Thursday.\n\n\u201cCoup\u201d decries Democrats\u2019 impeachment efforts as an attempt to \u201cundo the election regardless of facts\u201d and attack Trump \u201cby any means necessary.\u201d It also accuses Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, of fabricating evidence during a discussion of a whistleblower complaint against Trump, a claim also broadcast from the president\u2019s Twitter account (Schiff has said his paraphrase of Trump\u2019s controversial call with Ukraine\u2019s president \u201cwas meant to be at least part in parody\u201d).\n\nThe impeachment push is \u201cnothing short of a coup and it must be stopped,\u201d the Trump ad declares.\n\nCNN cited similar concerns about false statements in declining that newer commercial, saying the spot makes claims about the whistleblower complaint against the president that the intelligence community inspector general has debunked.\n\n\u201cIn addition, it is inaccurate to use the word \u2018coup\u2019 to describe a constitutionally prescribed legal process,\u201d the company stated, echoing critics who slammed Trump\u2019s comparison of impeachment to an opposition group\u2019s violent, illegal overthrow of a government.\n\nTrump\u2019s reelection campaign did not immediately provide comment on CNN\u2019s decision about this second ad.\n\nAnother commercial submitted by Donald Trump for President, called \u201cChanging Things,\u201d has been accepted, CNN said.\n\nNetworks have rejected presidential campaign commercials before. Last year, channels including Fox News \u2014 the president\u2019s favored news network \u2014 nixed an ad that CNN and others called racist for its depiction of immigrants as \u201cdangerous illegal criminals.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nWhite House officials weigh appeal to Democrats in GOP districts to stop impeachment of Trump\n\nMatt Lieberman, son of a former VP nominee, launches Senate run in Georgia\n\nThe Clinton impeachment trial set a standard.
