A new London restaurant opens with a conveyor-belt of cheesy dreams", "language": "en", "text": "... YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE {{item.title}}\n\nSweet dreams are definitely made of cheese.\n\nAnd it's been realised in reality for lucky Londoners, as a new restaurant opens with a sushi-style conveyor belt offering over 25 different kinds of cheese from all over the UK.\n\nREAD: Jaffles, pancake, biltong and cheese: How to eat yourself silly in the Karoo\n\nCalled Pick and Cheese (good one) at the Seven Dials Market in Central London, it claims to be the first of its kind, where each cheesy gouda-ness is paired with individual condiments alongside a selection of small producer wines.\n\nIt's on a first-come, first-served basis with potentially long waiting times, but there are two booths available for booking for a maximum of six people for when the whole crew wants to get their brie on.\n\nWATCH: The silliest cheese race can be found in England\n\nAccording to CNN Travel, the cheese plates are colour-coded so you can snack on whatever catches your fancy, or rather opt for a pre-selected course. You can also order other delightful dishes from the menu, like a whole baked Waterloo with basil stewed blackberries and bread, or blue cheese soft serve.\n\nSome coma-inducing UK delectables that you can expect to find include Stilton, Cornish Gouda, clothbound Cheddar, Yorkshire Pecorino, Red Leicester and Beenleigh Blue. The plates range from \u00a32.95 (about R54 at R18,28/\u00a3) to \u00a36.10 (about R112) per serving.\n\nLet's hope some enterprising individual decides to bless us with this delight in South Africa.\n\nALSO WATCH: Taste the Swiss region of Gruy\u00e8res through its cheese fondues\n\n\n\n\n\nFind Your Escape by signing up for the Traveller24 Weekly Newsletter \u2013 Subscribe here.
