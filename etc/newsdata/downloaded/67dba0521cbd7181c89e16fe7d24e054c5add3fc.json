Each strong characters.\n\nIt was 1992-93 and seeking to end their barren run of 26 years without a top flight title, Sir Alex Ferguson had built a side with players who would tackle, fight and stand up to be counted.\n\nPaul Ince (far left) believes Manchester United are paying the price for a lack of leadership\n\nMan United's current side are enduring their worst ever start to a Premier League season\n\nUnited finished ahead of runners-up Aston Villa by 10 points that season and for Ince, placing individual quality to one side, it came down to one key ingredient: mentality.\n\n'It's all about mentality,' he told Sportsmail, reflecting on those successful years nestled away in a chic lounge in Soho.\n\n'You have to have people and characters. The biggest thing for us was we had a presence.\n\n'In the tunnel we had already beaten most teams before even going out on the pitch.\n\n'We had that presence about us but if you look at United now, teams look at them and think they can get something from them. Not just at home but also when they go to Old Trafford.'\n\nInce won 10 trophies in his six years at Old Trafford, including two Premier League titles, two FA Cups and a League Cup.\n\nInce (front, green hat) was used to winning trophies during his six-year spell at Old Trafford\n\nUnited fans are now adapting to a period of demise where they are slumped in the bottom half\n\nTrophies became synonymous with Ferguson's reign, particularly towards the end when the domination left rivals scratching their heads as to how they could bring it to an end.\n\nSince his departure, the biggest honours have dried up, the feisty derbies have ceased and the leaders have disappeared.\n\nIt's the root of United's problem, believes Ince, but players in the mold of former team-mate Roy Keane are a thing of the past. United have to evolve - and fast.\n\n'The game has changed,' he added. 'There are no (Roy) Keane, (Bryan) Robson, (Steven) Gerrard, (Patrick) Vieira or (Emmanuel) Petit-type players anymore.\n\n'You just don't get them anymore and a lot of those players, a lot of them had tough backgrounds and football has been their life. It was their passion but now football is just a job to some players.\n\n'They get the best of everything financially and the pitches are great so they have that mentality where they are a bit soft. I watched United play Newcastle the other week and I saw them tackled and just rolling over.\n\n'I wanted them to get up and get on with it, they were 1-0 down you know. That mentality we had, these players haven't got that now. You don't get those players anymore and this is the problem United have.\n\n'That time (under Ferguson) has gone and we need to find another way to be successful.'\n\nLeaders and captains like Bryan Robson were the players Sir Alex Ferguson built teams around\n\nThe pressure is mounting on Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ince admits he needs to win on Sunday\n\nInce refuses to say 'I told you do' but when he warned earlier this year not to hand Solskjaer the job prematurely, he was labelled as jealous and a naysayer in the face of undeniable success.\n\nThey beat Paris Saint-Germain away from home in the Champions League, after all.\n\nCalls were deafening for the Norwegian to be handed the job permanently and with win after win after win arrived, chief executive Ed Woodward jumped on the bandwagon and relented.\n\nMAN UNITED'S NEXT SIX FIXTURES Sunday Liverpool (H) Thursday Partizan Belgrade (A) Europa League group stage October 27 Norwich City (A) October 30 Chelsea (A) Carabao Cup fourth round November 2 Bournemouth (A) November 7 Partizan Belgrade (H) Europa League group stage\n\nWhat has since followed has been United's worst ever start to a Premier League season and they have failed to win a single away game since that dramatic late show in Paris back in March.\n\nYoung players like Tahith Chong, Angel Gomes, Scott McTominay and Mason Greenwood have been thrust into the first team set-up due to a frightening lack of depth and there again lies an issue that does not sit comfortable with Ince.\n\nAhead of a match the size of the one on Sunday against league leaders and bitter rivals Liverpool, where are the leaders to help show the teenagers the ropes? Where are the experienced heads to lead the way? The answer: United have no one capable of doing it on the biggest stage.\n\n'You have to get quality and that is something United haven't got,' he continued. 'You can't blame the youth, players like (Mason) Greenwood, (Tahith) Chong, (Scott) McTominay, there are no people around them to get them through these games.\n\n'At least when I was playing when I first started off there was Bryan Robson, Steve Bruce, Mark Hughes and players like that. Then the Class of '92 came in and there was me and (Roy) Keane to look after them. These kids at United just haven't got that.'\n\nInce is in an exclusive club that has - some would say bravely - played for both United and Liverpool.\n\nThe 51-year-old is part of an exclusive club that represented both Liverpool and Man United\n\nJurgen Klopp has turned Liverpool into serious title challengers and European champions\n\nBut on Sunday his loyalties are in no doubt - he speaks with the inclusive pronoun 'we' on the topic of United. While impressed with Liverpool's rise under Jurgen Klopp, the tone is markedly different.\n\n'I remember when I was at United we would always fancy beating Liverpool, always,' he said, a smile etched across his face.\n\n'When I was at Liverpool we always thought they would beat us as United were a better team than us! Now the roles are reversed. Liverpool will expect to beat United and that is where we are at this moment.\n\n'When I watch Liverpool play or Tottenham play I know what they are trying to do, I know their patterns of play and with United I don't see that. Ole keeps saying they are working hard, working hard but I would like to see what they are actually working hard on because I don't see it come gameday.'\n\nAs time in Ince's company draws to a close he looks to add some positivity to a conversation that has been damning of the personalities in United's dressing room now.\n\nA win, he believes, could 'transform their season' but if they are comprehensively beaten, Solskjaer's time in charge could come to a rather abrupt end.\n\nHe still won't say 'I told you so,' though.\n\nNo blame can be placed at the door of young stars such as Tahith Chong (left) and Scott McTominay (right) in the opinion of Ince, because they lack leadership around them to help\n\nLose on Sunday and United risk potentially dropping into the Premier League relegation zone\n\nPaul Ince is a Paddy Power ambassador.
