That\u2019s not the point of life. You\u2019ve got to thrive, you\u2019ve got to feel happy.\u201d\n\nShe went on to say she\u2019s tried for a long time to adopt the British mentality of having a \u201cstiff upper lip.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I think that what that does internally is probably really damaging. The biggest thing I know is that I never thought it would be easy but I thought it would be fair.\u201d\n\nA visibly emotional Meghan revealed that she's 'not ok' in the documentary [Photo: ITV] More\n\nBradby went on to point out that the counter argument is that privilege and power does bring with it scrutiny and asked how the duchess counters that argument.\n\n\u201cWhen things are fair,\u201d she responded. \u201cIf I do something wrong I\u2019d be the first to say \u2018Oh my gosh I\u2019m so sorry.\u2019\n\n\u201cWhen people are saying things that are just untrue and they\u2019re being told they\u2019re untrue but they\u2019re still saying them. I don\u2019t know anyone in the world that would feel that\u2019s ok. And that\u2019s different to just scrutiny. That\u2019s, what would you call that?\u201d\n\nMeghan went on to say that it is hard for people to understand what it is like, but they assume the grass is always greener.\n\n\u201cThe good thing is that I\u2019ve got my baby and I\u2019ve got my husband and they\u2019re the best,\u201d she added.\n\nThe Duchess also opened up about the potential impact of the pressures she is facing.\n\nWhen asked about the impact on her health, she looked emotional as she answered: \u201cLook, any woman especially when they are pregnant, you\u2019re really vulnerable, and so that was made really challenging, and then when you have a newborn \u2013 you know\u2026\n\nStory continues", "description": "\u201cYou shouldn't do it - the British tabloids will destroy your life.\u201d", "authors": ["Marie Claire Dorking"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/vrn9znQa148RrCVMoOqaUw--~B/aD02ODM7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/0de324f0-f3de-11e9-b37f-e2883707881f", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
