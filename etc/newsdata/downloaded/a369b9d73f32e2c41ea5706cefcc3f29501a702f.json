The bid came less than two months after the LSE and its chief executive, David Schwimmer, agreed to acquire Refinitiv for $14.5 billion, with the intention of becoming a fully fledged financial data provider.\n\n\u201cThis is a transformational transaction that accelerates our group\u2019s strategy, positioning us in key areas of future growth as a global financial markets infrastructure leader,\u201d Mr. Schwimmer said.\n\nThe Hong Kong exchange later tried to appeal directly to shareholders before ultimately dropping its pursuit of the U.K. operator.\n\nLSE said that it will undertake a global search to replace Group Chief Financial Officer David Warren, who will continue in the role through 2020.\n\nThe board appointed David Shalders as chief integration officer, the company said. He will join as a member of the executive committee and report to the chief executive.", "description": "LSE Group said its third-quarter gross profit also rose, climbing 14%.Adriano Marchese", "authors": ["Adriano Marchese"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
