(Lucas Jackson/Reuters)\n\nThe NRA\u2019s political action committee had an explosive month of fundraising in September after Democratic 2020 presidential candidates openly backed confiscating legally-owned firearms, according to Federal Election Commission documents.\n\nThe PAC raised $1.3 million in September, a $400,000 increase over previous month\u2019s fundraising total. Donations of under $200 accounted for $981,277 of the total, the Washington Free Beacon noted.\n\nCandidate Beto O\u2019Rourke set off a firestorm in September after vowing to confiscate legally-owned semi-automatic rifles in an effort to prevent mass shootings.\n\n\u201cHell, yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47. We\u2019re not going to allow it to be used against a fellow American anymore,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said during the third Democratic primary debate.\n\nBefore O\u2019Rourke\u2019s comments, the NRA\u2019s PAC was raising roughly $4,627 per day. After the comments, however, the PAC brought in $15,344 per day.\n\nThe PAC currently has $10 million in total, more than three times what O\u2019Rourke possess in his campaign fund and ahead of Joe Biden\u2019s savings as well.\n\nOn October 16, O\u2019Rourke said on MSNBC that gun owners who refused to comply with his proposed mandatory gun buyback program would get a visit from local law enforcement.\n\n\u201cI think just as in any law that is not followed or flagrantly abused there have to be consequences or else there is no respect for the law,\u201d said O\u2019Rourke. \u201cSo in that case I think there would be a visit by law enforcement to recover that firearm and make sure that it is purchased, bought back, so that it cannot be potentially used against somebody else.\n\nDemocratic senators Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey have also voiced support for mandatory buybacks as part of their respective presidential campaign platforms. Former vice president Joe Biden\u2019s proposed gun policies include a voluntary buyback option with a ban on future assault weapons sales.", "description": "Candidate Beto O'Rourke set off a firestorm in September after vowing to confiscate legally-owned semi-automatic rifles in an effort to prevent mass shootings.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Andrew C.
