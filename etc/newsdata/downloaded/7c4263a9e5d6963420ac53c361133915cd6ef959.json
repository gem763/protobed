Hoda Muthana, a young woman from Alabama who joined the ISIS group.\n\nThe United States in February said that Muthana was not a citizen due to her father's former diplomatic status.\n\nThe US Constitution grants citizenship to everyone born in the country - with the exception of children of diplomats, as they are not under the jurisdiction of the United States.\n\nMuthana's father, Ahmed Ali, served at the Yemeni mission at the United Nations.\n\nHe has filed a lawsuit seeking to affirm his daughter's citizenship, saying he had left his diplomatic post several months before her birth.\n\nTinderbox\n\nThe Kurdish administration and aid agencies have warned of deteriorating humanitarian conditions in Al-Hol, where acute malnutrition, pneumonia and dehydration are rife among children in the camp.\n\n\"The situation in the camp is very difficult,\" Sheikhmous Ahmed, an official with the Kurdish administration, told AFP earlier this week.\n\nHe accused the international community of \"neglecting its responsibilities towards the displaced\" in Al-Hol, most of whom were evacuated from the \"caliphate\".\n\nSome evacuees from ISIS areas have been repentant, but others have made clear their allegiance to ISIS remains intact, turning Al-Hol into a tinderbox.\n\nResidents have reported clashes with guards, violent factional quarrels, warning that Al-Hol is emerging as a fresh jihadist powder keg.\n\nIn recent weeks, women in the camp have staged demonstrations demanding better services as well as information on their husbands held by the Kurds, according to the UN's humanitarian office.", "description": "Two American women and six children from families of suspected Islamic State group members have been repatriated to the United States in the latest transfers from a crowded camp in Syria.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8547/95aabe8cc6dc4ae3bfe00b5011443c01.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-06"}
