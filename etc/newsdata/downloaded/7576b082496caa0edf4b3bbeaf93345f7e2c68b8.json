Susan Collins (R-Maine) on Saturday attacked President Donald Trump urging China to investigate political rival Joe Biden as \u201ccompletely inappropriate.\u201d The unequivocal statement makes her the third Republican senator to speak out against Trump\u2019s invitation to a foreign government to become involved in American politics.\n\n\u201cI thought the president made a big mistake by asking China to get involved in investigating a political opponent,\u201d Collins told the Bangor Daily News at a local event. \u201cIt\u2019s completely inappropriate.\u201d\n\nA similar phone call by Trump in July to Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate Biden and his son \u2014 while withholding U.S. military funds \u2014 is now the focus of a formal impeachment inquiry.\n\nCollins would not comment on evidence in the impeachment inquiry. But she said the process should be carried out with the \u201cseriousness that any impeachment proceeding deserves.\u201d\n\n\u201cShould the articles of impeachment come to the Senate \u2014 and right now I\u2019m going to guess that they will \u2014 I will be acting as a juror as I did in the Clinton impeachment trial,\u201d Collins said. Clinton was acquitted in 1999 on perjury and obstruction of justice concerning his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.\n\nCollins faces re-election in 2020 in a state that voted for Hillary Clinton for president.\n\nShe joins only two other Republican senators to date who have criticized Trump\u2019s attempts to involve foreign governments in probing his political opponent.\n\nSen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) slammed Trump\u2019s appeal to China Thursday.\n\n\u201cAmericans don\u2019t look to Chinese commies for the truth,\u201d Sasse told the Omaha World-Herald. \u201cIf the Biden kid broke laws by selling his name to Beijing, that\u2019s a matter for American courts, not communist tyrants running torture camps.\u201d\n\nSen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) attacked Trump invitation to Ukraine \u2014 and now to China \u2014 to interfere in American politics as \u201cwrong and appalling.\u201d\n\nBy all appearances, the President\u2019s brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling. \u2014 Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) October 4, 2019\n\nWhen the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China\u2019s investigation is his political opponent in the midst of the Democratic nomination process, it strains credulity to suggest that it is anything other than politically motivated. \u2014 Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) October 4, 2019\n\nTrump slashed Romney Saturday in a tweet as an \u201cass\u201d and a loser who \u201cnever knew how to win.\u201d Trump also said Romney should be \u201cimpeached,\u201d but named no specific impeachable offenses.\n\nMitt Romney never knew how to win. He is a pompous \u201cass\u201d who has been fighting me from the beginning, except when he begged me for my endorsement for his Senate run (I gave it to him), and when he begged me to be Secretary of State (I didn\u2019t give it to him). He is so bad for R\u2019s! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 5, 2019\n\nI\u2019m hearing that the Great People of Utah are considering their vote for their Pompous Senator, Mitt Romney, to be a big mistake. I agree! He is a fool who is playing right into the hands of the Do Nothing Democrats! #IMPEACHMITTROMNEY \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 5, 2019\n\nIn a sly slap-down China announced it doesn\u2019t plan to \u201cinterfere\u201d in American affairs, so likely won\u2019t be launching an Biden investigation.\n\n\u201cChina will not interfere in the internal affairs of the US, and we trust that the American people will be able to sort out their own problems,\u201d said China\u2019s Foreign Minister Wang Yi, the state-run Global Times reported Thursday.", "description": "\u201cI thought the president made a big mistake by asking China to get involved in investigating a political opponent,\" said Maine's Republican senator.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d991e7621000053033199d0.jpeg?cache=tfls5eszht&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
