Read more\n\nAfter winning the White House in 2016. Trump toyed with the idea \u2013 and in doing so rather cruelly toyed with the man \u2013 of appointing Romney secretary of state.\n\nThe contender for the Republican nomination in 2008 and nominee in 2012 had already called Trump a \u201cphony\u201d. The job went to an oil baron.\n\n\u201cI would not have lasted as long as Rex Tillerson,\u201d Romney told the New York Times.\n\nTillerson was fired by Trump \u2013 by tweet, reportedly while on the toilet \u2013 in March 2018, after a year on the job.\n\nRomney also told the New York Times he thought he would have lasted \u201cmaybe a little longer than Anthony Scaramucci\u201d. That was a reference to the hedge-funder-come-White House communications director who served for less than two weeks.\n\nI\u2019m laying out a path for the party post the president Mitt Romney\n\nTillerson reportedly called Trump \u201ca fucking moron\u201d while he was secretary of state but has largely remained quiet since leaving the administration. Scaramucci is now a vocal critic of the president, touring cable news shows to pontificate on the impeachment inquiry and plead for Trump\u2019s removal or defeat.\n\nRomney is now a senator from Utah and a more subtle but persistent critic. Trump recently called him \u201ca pompous ass\u201d and doubtlessly counted him among the \u201cNever Trumper\u201d Republicans he called \u201chuman scum\u201d in a tweet this week.\n\nThe former Massachusetts governor\u2019s Times interview was part of a media campaign which this week saw him essentially out himself as \u201cPierre Delecto\u201d, a rather more secretive Twitter user than the man in charge.\n\nRepublican critics of the decision to use a pseudonym, a practice formerly followed by Trump nemesis James Comey, generally chose not to comment on Trump\u2019s admitted use of assumed names to praise himself in the past.\n\n\u201cPeople say to me, \u2018If you\u2019re critical of the president you\u2019re hurting the party,\u2019\u201d Romney said. \u201cNo I\u2019m not \u2013 I\u2019m laying out a path for the party post the president.\u201d\n\nTrump might be defeated at the polls next year. Or if as seems likely he is impeached by the House, he might yet be convicted and removed by the Senate. That chamber is held by Republicans guided by Mitch McConnell, the majority leader and a staunch Trump ally. That makes it seem highly unlikely 20 Republicans will vote for Trump\u2019s removal.\n\nBut some leading Republican voices have suggested enough senators could yet decide that defending Trump over his attempts to force Ukraine to investigate his political rivals is not worth their reputations or the cost to the party as a whole.\n\nRomney might then emerge as a figurehead. In accordance with reports McConnell is preparing his party for a trial, Romney told the Times he has been reading the Federalist Papers and other constitutional texts.\n\nAlso on Saturday, Romney told the Washington Post: \u201cI am going to wait to see if impeachment articles come. If they do come, I will review all the facts as they are presented at that point and make a decision which I believe is right.\u201d\n\nBill Weld: Trump faces higher risk of removal if senators go to secret ballot Read more\n\nThe Post detailed Romney and Trump's long relationship and an attempted rapprochement earlier this year. Romney's niece Ronna McDaniel is chair of the Republican party, but she reportedly dropped Romney from her name at Trump's request. According to the Post, it took Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, formerly a fierce opponent of Trump but now a stout ally, to set up a private meeting.\n\nThat went reasonably well, the Post said, but Romney soon publicly expressed his disappointment with Trump over foreign policy issues including Ukraine, China and Syria. Graham told the Post Trump now realises \u201cthe damage has been done\u201d. The senator also said: \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll go into marriage counselling.\u201d\n\nRomney told the Times his wife, Ann, had convinced him to run for the Senate last year in part by asking: \u201cWhat would your dad do?\u201d\n\nGeorge Romney was a Michigan governor who ran for the Republican nomination as a moderate in the age of Barry Goldwater and the party\u2019s lurch to the right.\n\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Romney told the Times, \u201cjust because you weren\u2019t made general doesn\u2019t mean you stop fighting.\u201d", "description": "Utah senator and Trump critic tells the New York Times he wouldn\u2019t have lasted as long as Rex Tillerson", "authors": ["Martin Pengelly"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d60f8c67bc79b517846b50454f8cf447267c40f2/0_89_4903_2942/master/4903.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6fd1f438619d1f0bc0afadd491cc04b4", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
