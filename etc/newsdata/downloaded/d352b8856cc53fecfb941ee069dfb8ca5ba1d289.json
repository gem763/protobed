I hope I don\u2019t sound ridiculous \u2026 Sorry to Keke Palmer, whose previously pristine mind palace has now been sullied with the knowledge of who Dick Cheney is. Last week, a clip of the Hustlers star taking a lie-detector test and admitting she had \u201cno idea\u201d who the former vice-president was went viral. In the full video, posted by Vanity Fair, Palmer is asked if her character True Jackson, from Nickelodeon\u2019s True Jackson, VP \u2014 a show about a 15-year-old who is made vice-president of a high-end fashion company \u2014 was a better vice-president than Cheney. Faced with a picture of Cheney on a plane, Palmer looked taken aback and said, \u201cWho the hell is \u2026 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate to say it. I hope I don\u2019t sound ridiculous. I don\u2019t know who this man is,\u201d she confessed. \u201cI mean, he could be walking down the street, and I wouldn\u2019t know a thing.\u201d Then, pushing the picture with the resigned, pitying energy of someone putting down a sick animal, she concluded: \u201cSorry to this man.\u201d The clip instantly exploded into a meme, and \u201cSorry to this man\u201d became a succinct, tidy way to dismiss someone.\n\nAnd how beautiful for Palmer, that she could move through the world unburdened by the knowledge of the instrumental role Cheney played in leading the United States into the Iraq War, or that time he shot his friend in the face, or the 2018 film Vice. Alas, nothing pure can last, and after her video went viral, Palmer\u2019s mom taught her the way of the world, and of former veeps.\n\nSNL to Shane Gills pic.twitter.com/u5qIe68zTg \u2014 Matthew A.
