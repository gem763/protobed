His protest sparked a movement, with several other athletes following his example.\n\nGetty Images for Roc Nation, FILE\n\nT.I. shared his thoughts on the deal in August as well, toeing the line between both sides in a video posted on Instagram with the caption, \"What I hate most is that the oppressor takes advantage of opportunities like these to divide us and continue on with their operations as usual all too often,\" he wrote. \"I believe in what [Colin Kaepernick] represents as much as I believe in what [Jay-Z] represents [and] I ain't gotta turn on either of them to do it.\"\n\nOn Friday, T.I. said that there are aspects of the NFL \"that definitely need to be addressed, but the greatest journey begins with one step, and I feel like Jay-Z is a person that I trust, knowing his reputation and knowing him personally.\"\n\n\"It could be a step in the right direction, but we have to allow it time to materialize before we become critical,\" he added.\n\nCo-host of \"The View\" Sunny Hostin pushed back on T.I.'s response, asking him if he thought the NFL might be using Jay-Z \"as cover\" for supporting social justice issues after they \"effectively colluded keeping [Kaepernick] out of the league\" for standing for those same issues.\n\n\"Did Jay offer them that cover or did Colin's settlement without having any kind of explanation to the people of what that settlement was and why it happened \u2014 the gag order that came with that settlement \u2014 was that cover enough?\" she asked.\n\nT.I. responded with a criticism of Kaepernick's protests.\n\n\"If we are still in it, what are our demands and requests? What are we in it for? What would we like to achieve? What are our marching orders? If that isn't being done, then I do believe we're just kind of standing fast with no true direction,\" he said.\n\n\"Support for Jay does not mean a lack of support for Kap or vice versa,\" T.I. said later on.\n\nKaepernick has not directly addressed the deal, but a tweet from Aug.18 with a photo of Reid and Miami Dolphins players Kenny Stills and Albert Wilson taking a knee appeared to push back against the deal.\n\n\"\"My Brothers @E_Reid35 @KSTiLLS @iThinkIsee12 continue to fight for the people, even in the face of death threats,\" Kaepernick wrote. \"They have never moved past the people and continue to put their beliefs into action. Stay strong Brothers!!!\"\n\nMy Brothers @E_Reid35 @KSTiLLS @iThinkIsee12 continue to fight for the people, even in the face of death threats.
