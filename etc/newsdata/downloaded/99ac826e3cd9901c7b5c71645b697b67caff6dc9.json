(AP) - A huge key to the Los Angeles Chargers success last season was Philip Rivers taking care of the football.\n\nWith the Chargers dropping two straight and four of their past five, Rivers\u2018 decision-making in key moments is why they are one of six teams in the AFC with a 2-4 record.\n\nRivers committed three turnovers in Sunday\u2019s 24-17 loss to Pittsburgh with two resulting in Steelers\u2019 touchdowns. He has eight turnovers through six games after having 13 last year.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the turnovers. I do believe they are going to stop,\u201d coach Anthony Lynn said on Monday. \u201cHe may be pressing a little bit early. We have to get back to him taking care of the football.\u201d\n\nThe Chargers have trailed by two touchdowns at the end of the first quarter the past two weeks and were blanked in the first half in consecutive home games for the first time in 43 years. If Rivers is feeling pressure to take it on himself, there is some credence. He is playing behind an inexperienced offensive line that is missing its two veteran leaders - left tackle Russell Okung and center Mike Pouncey - while the running game has regressed despite the return of Melvin Gordon.\n\nGordon and Rivers gift-wrapped the Steelers their first touchdown when Rivers threw a backward pass too high that Gordon was unable to grab. Gordon though thought the play was over and watched Devin Bush scoop up the loose ball and run 9 yards for the score.\n\nRivers threw for 320 yards against the Steelers, but 139 came in the fourth quarter when the Chargers trailed 24-0 and Pittsburgh was playing soft coverage.\n\n\u201cWhen you turn it over twice and you get beat, and you only score what we\u2019re scoring, you look for lots of things. Ultimately, we have to find a way to get in the end zone more,\u201d Rivers said. To me, that\u2019s the biggest issue right now that we\u2019re having, offensively. The offense\u2019s job is to score one more point than the other team and we\u2019re not doing that.\u201d\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nThe only way the Chargers were able to move the ball consistently throughout the game were completions on intermediate routes (10 to 20 yards). Rivers was 13 of 17 for 192 yards on those routes, which are his most completions on medium throws since he had 11 against San Francisco in 2014.\n\nMike Williams had his second straight solid game with five receptions for 72 yards. He is averaging 13.3 yards per catch the past two weeks.\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nTackling. Last week it was safety Rayshawn Jenkins who was unable to make an open-field tackle that led to a touchdown. This week it is linebacker Jatavis Brown.\n\nBrown couldn\u2019t wrap up Steelers running back James Conner and limit him to a 1-yard gain. Instead, Conner slipped out of a high tackle attempt and went 25 yards up the right sideline to put Pittsburgh up by three touchdowns.\n\n\u201cWe need to get more hats to the ball. I want to make those tackles in open field but the more hats you get to the ball the easier those tackles are going to be,\u201d Lynn said.\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nHunter Henry set career highs in receptions (eight) and yards (100) after missing the past four games because of a knee injury. The fourth-year tight end, who has been one of Rivers more dependable targets, also had his first multi-touchdown game. He had a 19-yard reception on the first play of the game and then made a nice catch in the back of the end zone for the Chargers\u2019 first touchdown.\n\n\u201cHis production really was unbelievable in his first game back. He probably played more plays than probably everybody anticipated, but it was the way the game went,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cHe\u2019s probably just going to be used more on third downs and a few other things, but when you get behind like we were, we had to roll.\u201d\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nMelvin Gordon has only 49 yards on 20 carries in his two games since returning from a two-month holdout. It is usually difficult to sustain any sort of run game against the Steelers, but Gordon continues to look tentative after getting the ball and is not generating many rushing yards after contact.\n\n\u201cThe passing game looks like it\u2019s working, so we\u2019re going to have to use the pass to open up the run,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cIn some games, the run opens up the pass, but how it\u2019s looking right now, the pass is going to have to open up the run.\u201d\n\nINJURED\n\nThe Chargers for once were able to get out of a game without any new significant injuries. Defensive end Melvin Ingram missed his second straight game because of a hamstring but there is a possibility he could return this week.\n\nLeft tackle Russell Okung is eligible to come off the non-football injury list this week, but Lynn said he wouldn\u2019t be able to update his status until Wednesday.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n49.3 percent - Third-down conversion rate against the Chargers defense which is fourth worst in the league. Pittsburgh came into the game converting only 28.3 percent of its third downs but was 8 of 13 on Sunday night, including making all seven with 4 yards or fewer to go.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nThe Chargers are on the road for three of the next four beginning Sunday against Tennessee. Los Angeles has won six of the past seven over the Titans, including 20-19 last season in London.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A huge key to the Los Angeles Chargers success last season was Philip Rivers taking care of the football.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Joe Reedy"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/14/steelers_chargers_football_91071_c0-92-2219-1386_s1200x700.jpg?2e9494b3dd21757d4ca968f4daf7d9f58e91e728", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
