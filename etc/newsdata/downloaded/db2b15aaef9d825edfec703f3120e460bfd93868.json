We Have.", "language": "en", "text": "Derek Robertson is a freelance writer based in Chicago. Follow him on Twitter @afternoondelete.\n\nSomewhere last weekend, Roger Goodell, the NFL\u2019s ruddy, perpetually beleaguered commissioner, surely savored the opportunity to enjoy a rare moment of schadenfreude at another league\u2019s expense. Adam Silver, Goodell\u2019s counterpart in the NBA, was forced into frantic damage control after a tweet from the Houston Rockets\u2019 general manager voiced support for Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy protests, infuriating the league\u2019s deep-pocketed Chinese partners.\n\nSuddenly, the tables were turned: The NBA, a new-media darling for its social justice advocacy, played the soulless corporate spin machine, while the NFL enjoyed ever-massive ratings, continuing its quiet getaway from the years of bad press incurred by its crackdown on the Colin Kaepernick-inspired national anthem protests.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nFor those unaware of the controversy currently roiling professional basketball, last Friday, Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted an image bearing the message \u201cfight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nHad the message come from the manager of a different NBA team, it might have gone unnoticed. But the Rockets have singular importance in China. Yao Ming, by far the most famous and statistically prolific Chinese national to ever play the game, spent his entire career with Houston, and his success fueled the growth of China\u2019s robust basketball infrastructure, which has come to include deep financial ties to the NBA, a devoted fan base and a thriving professional league of its own.\n\nThe NBA, realizing that the Chinese government sees any speech supporting Hong Kong\u2019s independence as an existential threat, reacted quickly to mend any potential injury to the league\u2019s relationship with China. Its initial statement about Morey\u2019s tweet was meant to placate both sides of the controversy; it had the exact opposite effect. Chinese state television canceled broadcasts of preseason games in Shanghai and Shenzhen, demanding a more explicit apology. At home, Silver\u2019s perceived appeasement of the Chinese accomplished the seemingly impossible: uniting in protest a group of Republicans and Democrats so ideologically diverse that it included even bitter Texas rivals Ted Cruz and Beto O\u2019Rourke.\n\nBut it\u2019s not surprising that those most disappointed by Silver\u2019s fumbling on the China issue are the NBA\u2019s die-hard fans. Since he took over the league in 2014, the new commissioner has built its virtuous reputation to the point where the New York Times\u2019 Bari Weiss was able to justifiably needle \u201cThe World\u2019s Wokest Sports League\u201d this week for its obsequiousness to an authoritarian, borderline-genocidal regime.\n\nWhat the NBA\u2019s demoralized boosters have largely overlooked, however, is a critical truth about its reinvention: Its liberal attitude isn\u2019t just good for its fans\u2019 consciences, it\u2019s good for business.\n\nThe sports world, or at least the NBA, hasn\u2019t changed its fundamental motive: profit. We\u2019ve changed in what we demand as consumers. Over the past decade, Americans have come to expect an unprecedented level of political transparency from our entertainment, whether it\u2019s the endless Trump-era boycotts of insufficiently ethical corporations, the emergence of identifiably partisan dairy products or the baffling furor over the lack of a 2016 presidential endorsement from Taylor Swift (for our purposes, a corporate empire unto herself).\n\nIn the past, multibillion-dollar industries like the NBA have played it safe, conservatively pitching themselves toward as wide an audience as possible. Now, they\u2019ve inadvertently fueled that metastasizing culture war simply by acting in their own economic interest. For the NBA, that\u2019s meant playing up their activism to an increasingly diverse, liberal American majority. By pushing the limits of the league\u2019s tolerance for actual protest, Daryl Morey has inadvertently forced us to confront some uncomfortable truths about what we\u2019ve come to ask from\u2014and the compromises we may have to make with\u2014our corporate and cultural behemoths.\n\nAnd despite a second hack at asserting players\u2019 and coaches\u2019 free speech rights, those questions have only intensified around Silver, leading him to cancel all further media appearances during the league\u2019s current jaunt to China. Trump gleefully took the opportunity to needle some of his longtime critics, mocking the outspoken coaches Steve Kerr and Gregg Popovich in his trademark discursive manner. Deadspin\u2019s Drew Magary wrote in protest, simply, \u201cThe NBA Doesn\u2019t Give a Fuck About People.\u201d The league\u2019s biggest stars have been conspicuously, embarrassingly shielded by flacks from questions about the controversy, and sign-wielding pro-Hong Kong activists have been kicked out of games\u2014in America, in case you weren\u2019t paying attention.\n\nThe China incident is the first controversy of Silver\u2019s tenure to meaningfully pit the league\u2019s \u201cwokeness\u201d against its bottom line, but in prioritizing the latter the commissioner isn\u2019t contradicting the league\u2019s history or spirit at all. The NBA has always threaded the needle between what's economically and culturally expedient, and its desperate juggling act in attempting to preserve its market in China and its reputation at home is no different.\n\n\n\n***\n\nThe NBA, like every other multibillion-dollar industry, hitched its wagon early on to the bullet train of globalization. In a prescient exchange during the 1997 NBA Finals, Chinese basketball pioneer (and state apparatchik) Xu Jicheng joked to then-commissioner David Stern that China could one day become the NBA\u2019s second-largest market.\n\nStern quipped that it should be the first. In 2006, he laid his cards on the table in a remarkably transparent manner, speaking by proxy for most of corporate America when he told veteran basketball writer Jack McCallum that \u201cThe China situation bothers me\u2026 but at the end of the day, I have a responsibility to my owners to make money. I can never forget that, no matter what my personal feelings might be.\u201d\n\nStern presided over an era during which the public had fewer, if any, expectations of progressive leadership from most cultural figures, much less its sports leagues. And his style was accordingly oriented toward the bottom line. The former commissioner shepherded the league out of its moribund 1970s, aligning it with pop culture by staging moments like Marvin Gaye\u2019s national anthem performance at the 1983 All-Star Game, and the Beatlemania-esque international furor over the 1992 Olympic \u201cDream Team.\u201d\n\nHe also aggressively policed players\u2019 personal expression in an era when hip-hop culture and black activism had yet to break into the mainstream, much less become profitable marketing concerns. He instituted a strict dress code for post-game news conferences that drew accusations of racism, and infamously hit Denver Nuggets guard Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf with harsh fines for his anthem protests that predated Kaepernick\u2019s by two decades, all but driving him out of the league.\n\nStern and Silver are clearly different men, raised in different eras, with different ethos. But you don\u2019t get to be the commissioner of a multibillion-dollar industry\u2014or charged with placating 30 fabulously wealthy, notoriously demanding owners\u2014without a level of fundamental trust in one\u2019s economic stewardship. The iron fist with which Stern ruled his players would today be unthinkable, and unacceptable to the young, liberal fans fueling the league\u2019s ascent, but his rule was just as aligned with the league\u2019s economic interests then as Silver\u2019s equivocation with China is now.\n\nThe China controversy has forced both the NBA\u2019s leaders and fans to contend with an uncomfortable truth about \u201cwoke capitalism.\u201d By all accounts, Adam Silver is a well-meaning liberal who believes the NBA\u2019s various social justice initiatives have inherent virtue. Early in his tenure, he booted the notoriously racist former Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling from the league, gave his implicit approval to teams\u2019 continuing boycott of the traditional post-championship White House visit, and has since presided over an era in which coaches like Kerr and Popovich freely launch viral jeremiads against the Trump administration.\n\nBut it\u2019s hard to imagine that he\u2014and perhaps more importantly, the team owners\u2014would be so tolerant if those decisions weren\u2019t conveniently popular with the fans who collectively represent their future revenue.\n\nInconveniently for the league, another massive chunk of that projected revenue is in China, which is why this controversy has become so intractable\u2014and why its burden will ultimately fall on the fans. The NBA is not going to jeopardize a relationship that amounts to reportedly around 10 percent of its net revenue, along with untold future profits, without significant pressure and protest that seems unlikely to materialize.\n\nSo for the first time in the league\u2019s modern era, socially conscious NBA fans will have to engage in the same sordid internal wrangling with their consciences that NFL fans have for years over steroid use, concussions and domestic violence. Silver\u2019s NBA has thus far been remarkably consistent in its politics, and therefore a guilt-free form of entertainment for those with whom it\u2019s aligned.\n\nThe China controversy has made that untenable, but it\u2019s not because of inconsistency on the NBA\u2019s part. If there\u2019s any revelation to come from the league\u2019s heel turn on China, it should be an introspective one\u2014that, no matter how passionately and bitterly one may wage the culture war online, in their personal life or through their pocket book, a compromise will ultimately be required.\n\nIf that seems too much to ask, it may be worth reflecting on how much we\u2019ve asked in the first place of an entity created to sell bobbleheads and cable packages. Politics has always been part of sports, with icons like Muhammad Ali, Serena Williams and, yes, Colin Kaepernick making statements at significant personal risk.\n\nBut with apologies to Mitt Romney, those are people, not corporations. If the NBA is suddenly too much for you to stomach, it may be worth asking, to paraphrase a hoary sports cliche, when you started rooting for the logo on the front of the jersey instead of the name on the back of it.", "description": "The \u201cwokest professional sports league\u201d harshly disappointed its fans this week.
