Fighting peacefully for the government to declare a climate and ecological emergency, to act immediately to halt wildlife loss and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2025.\n\nThis latest movement is scheduled to take place until next week, occupying cities around the world, including Sydney, Islamabad and Quebec, although, as the climate activist group has made clear for over a year now, this is not an issue that will end next week or any other week, until we all start taking action.\n\nAt the same time, on the same day, brothers Francisco and Patricio Norris, and their full-time team of eight, who are the brains behind a small start-up called Zelp, made the trip to their Wandsworth office and continued their bid to neutralise the well-known environmental hazards of livestock farming. Theirs is a movement, and business, that formed in 2017 and has worked tirelessly to get its emission-fighting product to market ever since.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nFlatulent cows have been one of many hot topics called out in climate change discussions as of late, but it seems our black and white friend\u2019s other end, as it were, has been all but forgotten in the plight to reduce the dangerous amount of methane emissions that cows release into the air. Burping cows now produce more methane than the entire world\u2019s transportation put together.\n\nMore than that, methane is 85 times worse for global warming than carbon dioxide and yet according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, demand for beef and dairy products is set to rise by 70 per cent in the next 30 years.\n\nIt\u2019s not all doom, gloom and bodily gases, though. Zelp, which stands for Zero Emissions Livestock Project, has established itself as the unmasked Marvelesque figure assuming the mission of not just reducing the methane that cows emit, which is one of the biggest known dangers for the world\u2019s ozone layer, but actually transforming the contents of their hearty belches altogether.\n\nHow? Facemasks. Wipe the image of burping cows wearing Mudd masks, watching Sex and the City and gossiping about their farmhand, a Yorkshire Mr Big, straight out of your head. It\u2019s not that kind of facemask. Instead, the Norris duo have engineered a removable, non-intrusive mask that attaches onto a cow\u2019s head and filters their burps, allowing methane to be turned into carbon dioxide and water vapour.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

But in the past few years, we faced the reality of the lethal contribution that we, and so many other families making a living in this way, are making to the ongoing climate crisis,\u201d Francisco, an Argentinian native, tells me.\n\n\u201cMy background was in design and engineering, which led me to do a master\u2019s at the Royal College of Art when I moved to London. When I was given a full year to tackle a project of my choosing, I, with my brother, started putting together the research for what is now Zelp: we quickly realised that what we needed to build was something that would oxidise the methane emissions given out by cows.\u201d\n\nThe end product, which Francisco says has had \u201cmore than 15 different designs so far, all of which included their own engineering time, behavioural trial and consumer reaction study\u201d, began as a nose ring, but has now taken the facial mask form. \u201cInitially, a nose ring seemed the most plausible because such a huge majority of cows wear them, but after multiple trials we found that the general attitude towards cows wearing rings is negative,\u201d he says.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

We need appropriate responses to the scale of the climate and ecological emergency, and agriculture is just one of the industries that are involved in that,\u201d she adds.\n\nThere\u2019s an cow-shaped elephant in the room, the obvious issue with Zelp\u2019s product. Luckily, Francisco mentions it before I have to awkwardly broach the topic myself. \u201cI can understand why someone at Extinction Rebellion, or just someone who wants a solution to climate change or perhaps dramatic and immediate change in general, might see what we\u2019re doing as prolonging this issue rather than solving it,\u201d the Zelp co-founder admits.\n\nThe world isn\u2019t ready to stop consuming beef and dairy yet ... so what we can do now is roll out our product quickly and get stuck in \u2013 reducing up to 60 per cent of the methane that cows are currently producing\n\n\u201cBut the truth is, the world isn\u2019t ready to stop consuming beef and dairy yet: the 70 per cent increase in demand expected in the coming decades proves that. So, if that\u2019s the case, what we can do now is roll out our product quickly [Zelp is aiming to be in production and selling by the end of 2020] and get stuck in, reducing up to 60 per cent of the methane that cows are currently producing.\u201d\n\nThe Norrises, who tell me they\u2019re \u201ctotally aware that the most obvious solution to ending harmful gas emissions is to shift consumer behaviour and end the consumption of livestock products altogether\u201d, went to lengths to ensure that Zelp\u2019s product was, and is, positioned to be transitionary: \u201cit\u2019s a transition period\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re the in between of where society is now and where it will be in the informed future, where people are consuming alternative products in the form of plant-based proteins,\u201d Francisco says.\n\n\u201cBut that will take time and right now, as movements like Extinction Rebellion show, we don\u2019t have time. The livestock industry is huge: it employs hundreds of millions of people, it\u2019s worth $2 trillion and it feeds a large amount of the global population \u2013 with that domination, we need to tackle what we can now. That\u2019s what Zelp is all about.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a hard pill to swallow, particularly for someone who\u2019s conscious of the planet\u2019s wellbeing and in complete support of Extinction Rebellion\u2019s three demands, but I understand where Francisco is coming from. Sadly, as is proven by the more than 500 arrests that have already taken place this week in London alone \u2013 as well as our prime minister\u2019s typically Victorian approach to describing \u201crebels\u201d as \u201cuncooperative nose-ringed crusties\u201d \u2013 the world isn\u2019t ready to admit what is glaringly obvious: that Extinction Rebellion is right and we need to act now \u2013 or, in actual fact, that we needed to act some time ago.\n\nUntil then, perhaps Zelp is our best shot at combatting at least one of the many dangers that stands to destroy the world around us. And until governments around the world are ready to admit defeat, and make industries like livestock farming illegal, we should be looking forward to the transition period that Francisco and Patricio not only speak of, but are enabling through their invention.\n\n\u201cIf things keep going the way they\u2019re going, then we should be out there doing what we want to do for the environment by next year \u2013 the sooner the better in our eyes,\u201d Francisco says to me, as our conversation comes to an end. I think I speak for the large majority of us, burping cows included, when I say the sooner the better in our eyes, too.", "description": "On Monday morning at 10am, Extinction Rebellion, along with thousands of protesters, gathered at Westminster to begin its international rebellion in London.
