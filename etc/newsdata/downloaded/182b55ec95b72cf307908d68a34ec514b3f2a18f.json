Ed Crosby of the Petaluma Police Department told The Mercury News. \"It's a great place to hide. It's very narrow. It takes a long time to get through it.\" The Petaluma Pumpkin Patch's website says there's only one way out of the maze.\n\nPolice told The Mercury News that they had documented five previous cases last month in which Watt stalked his former girlfriend, resulting in him being arrested on three occasions. That included him showing up at her home uninvited, going to her son's sports practices, and hacking her social media accounts to track where she was, police said.\n\nThe officers began looking for Watts after she told them he was sending her text messages and calling her to try and convince her to drop the charges against him.\n\nThe Petaluma Corn Maze in 2017. The Press Democrat\n\nAfter running away, police scoured the corn maze in search of Watt. They requested maps, set up a perimeter around the maze (which sits on 4 acres and takes at least 45 minutes to find your way out), and, in groups of two or three, wandered around with guns drawn. A California Highway Patrol helicopter flew above the maze to spot Watts from the sky.\n\nBut after around two hours, Crosby said they began to lose hope: The helicopter was almost out of fuel and officers were feeling dejected.\n\n\"At some point, you have to call it,\" he told The Press Democrat.\n\nThat's when an officer noticed a nearby chicken coop outside of the maze, and decided to take a look inside.\n\n\"And there he was,\" Crosby told The Mercury News. \"We think he hunkered down in the maze and then ran out into the coop.\"\n\nWatts was promptly arrested and jailed on suspicion of violating his restraining order and resisting arrest, among other charges, Crosby told The Press Democrat. He is currently being held on a $250,000 bail.", "description": "A California man who was suspected of stalking a former girlfriend and violating a restraining order tried to evade police by hiding in a corn maze.", "authors": ["Nicole Einbinder"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d93b7b421214c43d614079d?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
