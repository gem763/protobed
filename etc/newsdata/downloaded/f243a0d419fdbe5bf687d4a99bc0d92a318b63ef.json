WoToken Wallet advertises its users will earn between six and 20 per cent monthly while Cloud Wallet suggests users can collect six to 15 per cent, according to a BCSC news release. The other red flag for Muir was that both apps promise bonuses for signing up additional users, a feature he said was common to pyramid schemes.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a pyramid aspect to it and what we mean is people are encouraged to get in and bring other people in as well and what it does is two things: It creates a stream of money into this scheme that causes us some concern, but it also creates an incentive for people to get involved because it\u2019s another method of profit,\u201d Muir said.\n\nA video on Cloud Wallet\u2019s YouTube page explains a basic scenario where a user named \u201cSimon\u201d deposits US$500 into Cloud Wallet \u2014 the minimum to be eligible for what the app describes as a \u201cmatching bonus.\u201d Simon refers \u201cCatherine\u201d to Cloud Wallet and receives a bonus that equals her monthly earnings. The more people Simon signs up, the more bonuses he\u2019s eligible to receive. When his partners sign up new recruits to the app, Simon is eligible to make money from them as well.\n\nAccording to the BCSC, those bonuses are paid in crypto assets that are unique to the apps. Users can then convert those assets into other more commonly traded cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and from there, convert their funds into mainstream currencies.\n\nWhen contacted before publication, a Cloud Wallet spokesperson said they could not immediately get a lawyer to respond to the BCSC concerns. The spokesperson, however, stressed that the app isn\u2019t a \u201cPonzi scheme\u201d and went through a \u201cstrict approval process just to get listed on the Apple App Store.\u201d\n\nThe Post was unable to contact WoToken Wallet before publication.\n\nWe were concerned there might be some harm to the public and people might lose their money\n\nMuir would not say whether users had complained about losing money on the apps, only that the BCSC received information \u201cthat caused us some concern.\u201d\n\nThe BCSC has not charged the companies that run the apps but felt that the information it had about them was significant enough to alert investors about them in news releases.\n\n\u201cWe were concerned there might be some harm to the public and people might lose their money,\u201d he said.\n\nBoth Cloud Wallet, which can also be accessed through Android\u2019s Google Play, and WoToken Wallet, which can be downloaded online, have been in the market for about a year, Muir said. He\u2019s unaware of how many other apps fit the pattern set out by the two examples. Muir also said he\u2019s unaware of how many users are signed up on each.\n\nWhat may have sparked the BCSC\u2019s interest in these two specific apps is that they both have connections to Canada. WoToken Wallet is operated by WoToken Limited, which is connected to another company that was recently registered in B.C. Cloud Wallet, the BCSC said, is currently being advertised in online forums by a person who lives in Canada.\n\nMuir is asking anyone with information about either app to contact the BCSC.\n\nEmail: vferreira@nationalpost.com | Twitter: VicF77", "description": "BCSC suggests people approach two crypto wallet apps it likens to pyramid schemes with 'extreme caution'", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/cryptocurrency.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
