Turkey says its aim is to defeat the Kurdish YPG militia, which it sees as an enemy for its links to insurgents in Turkey.\n\n\"Nobody green-lighted this operation by Turkey, just the opposite. We pushed back very hard at all levels for the Turks not to commence this operation,\" U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper told a news briefing, responding to criticism that Trump had given Turkey a tacit \"green light\" for its attack.\n\nAn explosion occurred near a U.S. military outpost in northern Syria on Friday, but no personnel were reported hurt and the source of the blast near Kobane was unclear, a U.S. official said.\n\nThe Pentagon stressed the need for Turkey to avoid doing anything to endanger U.S. forces inside Syria, who numbered about 1,000 before the incursion.\n\n\"The Turkish military is fully aware - down to explicit grid coordinate detail - of the locations of U.S. forces,\" said U.S. Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nThe Turkish Defense Ministry said it had taken all measures to ensure that no U.S. base was damaged while it responded to harassment fire that originated near a U.S. base in Syria.\n\n\"There was no firing on the U.S. observation post,\" it said. The firing was halted when the U.S. military alerted Turkish forces, the ministry said.\n\n\n\n\n\n'WILL NOT STOP'\n\nErdogan dismissed criticism of the assault and said it \"will not stop ... no matter what anyone says.\"\n\nU.S Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Trump had made the right decision to move U.S. soldiers out of harm's way.\n\n\"Now our mission, the State Department mission, is to do everything we can using economic power, diplomatic power \u2013 all the tools available to us \u2013 to ensure that Turkey doesn't do what Erdogan has said that they just may do,\" Pompeo said in an interview with WKRN TV in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Trump had authorized the drafting of \"very significant\" new sanctions against Turkey, a NATO ally. Washington was not activating the curbs now but would do so if necessary, Mnuchin said.\n\nSanctions have been demanded by Republican congressional critics of Trump's policy but it was unclear how effective they might be when Ankara had already committed troops to the incursion.\n\n\"Turkey is fighting with terrorist organizations that create a threat to its national security,\" the Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement in response to the sanctions threat. \"No one should doubt that we will retaliate ... to any step that will be taken against this.\"\n\nA war monitor gave a death toll of more than 100 from the first days of the assault. The United Nations said 100,000 people had fled their homes.\n\nThe Turkish defense ministry said late on Friday that 399 YPG militants had been killed since the operation began.\n\nThe Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), with the Kurdish YPG as its main fighting element, now holds most of the territory that once made up Islamic State's \"caliphate\" in Syria, and has been keeping thousands of fighters from the jihadist group in jail and tens of thousands of their family members in camps.", "description": "ISTANBUL/BEIRUT (Reuters) - Turkey intensified its air and artillery strikes in northeast Syria on Friday in an offensive against Kurdish militia that has raised the prospect of a humanitarian disaster and questions about U.S. President Donald Trump's policy in the region.
