But regardless of whether you're after a fresh-out-of-the-factory handset like the Pixel 4 or something a little older like a Galaxy S10+, there are plenty of great offers around. With that in mind, we're going to have a look at the best plans for some of the year's best phones.\n\niPhone 11 Pro\n\nImage: Nood Cases\n\nIf you're after an iPhone 11 Pro, Optus has one of the best deals around right now. $99 per month gets you a 64GB iPhone 11 Pro and 100GB of data on a 36-month contract.\n\nThree years might seem like a long time, but a 36-month contract is one of the best ways to make the price of a brand-new iPhone a little bit more palatable. For comparison, here's what Telstra and Vodafone are offering:\n\nSamsung Galaxy S10+\n\nImage: Supplied\n\nTelstra just cut the price of the 512GB Galaxy S10+ by $432, which works out to be a saving of $18 per month on a 24-month repayment plan. That actually makes it cheaper than getting a 128GB Galaxy S10+ through Telstra. Better yet, you'll also get a bonus pair of Galaxy Buds valued at $249 if you grab the phone before November 25.\n\nHere are Telstra's 24-month 512GB Galaxy S10+ plans:\n\nSamsung Galaxy S10e\n\nImage: Supplied\n\nIf you're after a cheaper Samsung smartphone, Optus has a great deal on the Galaxy S10e. You can grab the phone and 30GB of data for just $64 per month. And if you sign up before November 25, you'll nab yourself a bonus pair of Galaxy Buds valued at $249.\n\nHere's a look at how the Optus plan stacks up:\n\n<h2<Google Pixel 4 XL\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nThe Pixel 4 family just hit stores, and there are a few neat bonuses on offer for early adopters. If you grab any Pixel 4 device through Telstra before January 13, you'll get a free Google Nest Hub valued at $199. Our pick is Telstra's $103.29 per month 64GB Pixel 4 XL plan with 15GB of data. This plan is sold on a 24-month repayment plan.\n\nOptus has its own giveaway. All Pixel 4 devices come with a Google Assistant powered Harman Kardon Citation One speaker valued at $299, provided you grab one before December 31. Our pick is Optus' $104 per month 64GB Pixel 4 XL plan with 60GB of data on a 24-month contract.\n\n<h2<Huawei P30 Pro\n\nImage: Supplied\n\nThe Huawei P30 Pro still has one of the best cameras on any smartphone around, especially when it comes to zoom. Better yet, Optus has got it at a killer price. $74 per month gets you Huawei's excellent flagship and 30GB.\n\nIt is of course worth being aware of Huawei's dispute with the US government. Huawei is currently restricted from working with US companies, which effectively cuts it off from Android. Regardless of whether the US situation is resolved, the P30 Pro will still be able to run Google apps and services and Huawei has promised to still provide security updates, but these may get deployed at a slower pace. In addition, an update to Android 10 is still on the cards.\n\nMost importantly, if you buy a P30 Pro, you won't lose any out-of-the-box functionality.\n\nHere's how Optus' plan compares:\n\nAlex Choros is Managing Editor at WhistleOut, Australia's phone and internet comparison website.\n\nFind more great bargains at Lifehacker Coupons.\n\nAs Lifehacker editors we write about stuff we like and think you'll like too.
