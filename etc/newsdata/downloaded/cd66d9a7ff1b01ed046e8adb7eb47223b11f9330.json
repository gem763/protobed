Everyone else is irrelevant.\n\nTrump the predator Read more\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. The entire field is impressive. Every candidate in last week\u2019s debate would make a far better president than the current inhabitant of the Oval Office.\n\nBut let\u2019s get real. Biden, Warren, and Sanders each continue to garner around 20% in the polls while all others are in the single-digit doldrums. The frontrunners also have the money and the organization.\n\nYet eight Democrats have already qualified for the 20 November debate in the Atlanta area, including the senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, the entrepreneur Andrew Yang and the billionaire Tom Steyer.\n\nBy 13 November, the last date for meeting the Democratic National Committee criteria, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the former representative Beto O\u2019Rourke, Senator Amy Klobuchar, the former housing secretary Juli\u00edan Castro and Representative Tulsi Gabbard were also on board.\n\nTrump has never stopped campaigning. His incendiary lies continue to reverberate\n\nThis is nuts. What\u2019s the point of another three-hour marathon? With so many candidates, all we get are soundbites, gotchas and one-liners.\n\nPerhaps someone in the second tier will be picked for vice-president or will end up in the next president\u2019s cabinet, or their exposure will help win a seat in the House or Senate, or a governorship. But this is not enough reason to continue this overly extended beauty contest.\n\nSupport must consolidate soon. Time is wasting. Take out the holidays and by 20 November the caucuses and primaries will be only weeks away. The Iowa caucuses are on 3 February.\n\nIf we were going into a normal general election, the huge field of wannabes wouldn\u2019t be a problem. But this won\u2019t be a normal election. These are not normal times. If you hadn\u2019t noticed, Donald Trump is not a normal president.\n\nImpeachment is sucking huge amounts of oxygen from the political air, and will continue to do so for months.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump\u2019s campaign is in full gear. His fundraising machinery \u2013 the Republican National Committee, Super Pacs, his official campaign \u2013 has raised more than $736m. That\u2019s more than any presidential candidate at this point in a campaign.\n\nTrump has never stopped campaigning. His incendiary lies continue to reverberate through Fox News, rightwing radio and social media.\n\nThe larger the Democratic field, the harder it is for any single candidate or message to break through the cacophony.\n\nAt the same time, second-tier candidates are under growing pressure to take pot shots at the front runners \u2013 planting negative stories, poking holes in their plans, building themselves up at their expense. This may be rational for them but it\u2019s irrational for the Democrats as a whole.\n\nThe old saw that a nominee benefits from having to respond to many other candidates doesn\u2019t apply to this election.\n\nIf you thought the 'swift boating' of John Kerry in 2004 was outrageous, wait until Trump launches his aircraft carriers\n\nTrump will not be debating subtle differences between Medicare for All and Medicare for Those Who Want It. He will accuse the Democrat of being a communist, and worse.\n\nIt\u2019s time to for Democrats to hunker down. The debaters on 20 November should be Biden, Warren and Sanders.\n\nWarren and Sanders should be given a chance to fully explain how their ideas differ. Biden needs to explain why he believes America should return to the politics we had before Trump, when that politics led to Trump.\n\nAll three should have ample time to describe how they\u2019d win over working-class Americans who have been shafted for 40 years.\n\nThey also need room to discuss how they\u2019ll create a multi-racial, multi-ethnic coalition to take power back for the bottom 90%, and how they\u2019ll get big money out of politics and restore our democracy.\n\nAnd they need to address how they\u2019ll take on Trump\u2019s malicious lies and anything-goes tactics. If you thought George W Bush\u2019s \u201cswift boating\u201d of John Kerry in 2004 was outrageous, wait until Trump launches his aircraft carriers.\n\nAmericans deserve a full opportunity to assess these three candidates and decide which should take on Trump. It\u2019s not too late for the DNC to tighten the rules for who gets to debate next.\n\nThe stakes could not be higher. This will be the most important election in modern American history.
