Whilst the overall rise has only been seen this year, and we hope it is not the start of a longer-term trend, it\u2019s crucial to have a better understanding of why there has been such an increase,\u201d she added.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The reality is that mental health services have not been given the funding they need by this government.\"\n\nIt comes after The Independent revealed that people seeking help with their mental health in the UK were being kept on \u201chidden waiting lists\u201d, with more than 122,000 patients waiting more than eight weeks to see a doctor again after their first appointment.\n\nOn 3 August, the prime minister Boris Johnson announced a spending boost of \u00a31.8m for the NHS, but Labour said this fell \u201csignificantly short\u201d of the amount needed to reverse years of government cuts.\n\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cEvery suicide is a preventable death and we are working urgently with partners across government, businesses and communities to tackle this problem. All councils have a suicide prevention plan in place backed by \u00a325m and we work closely with them to ensure they are effective.\n\n\u201cWe are transforming mental health services with a planned record spend of \u00a312.1bn this year and announced a further expansion of mental health services in our Long Term Plan for the NHS, with an additional \u00a32.3bn in real terms by 2024.\u201d\n\nIf you are struggling to cope, please call Samaritans free on 116 123 (UK and ROI), email jo@samaritans.org or visit the Samaritans website to find details of the nearest branch.", "description": "The rate of suicide in the UK has hit a 16-year high after surging in the past year following half a decade of decline, new figures show.
