A Chinese firm dedicated to making thin solar panels has now joined the list of OEMs working towards the same. Hanergy, as it is called, has partnered with a Chinese automaker - Jiangsu Joylong Automobile to come up with the solar powered car.\n\nThe car is currently under testing for efficiency of its solar panels and corresponding range output. From what the companies claim, the test results are turning out to be promising as well. As of now, the car is able to harness enough solar energy through the thin solar panels installed on it to run 20 km per day on a single charge, for 20 days straight.\n\nThe solar car in limelight sunlight\n\nThis is the first of its kind effort by both Hanergy and Jiangsu Joylong Automobile. Strictly focussing on the viability of such a vehicle first, the companies have not gone for a fancy make on the car. Instead, the car under testing is as simple as it can be, a simple four-wheeler that counts as an entry-level electric car for the Chinese masses, only this one has thin solar panels installed on it.\n\nHanergy Solar Powered Car Concept (Image: Hanergy Thin Film Power)\n\nAn interesting analysis by Hanergy mentions that the car is able to generate energy from the solar rays even on a cloudy day. This is contrary to the issue faced by many other such makes, which usually depend on direct sun rays to produce any considerable energy to power the vehicle.\n\nDon't Miss 101 SHARES 206 SHARES 295 SHARES\n\nAs for its tested efficiency, the solar powered car by Hanergy and Joylong can be driven for 30 to 80 km more than the 20 km promised by the solar energy everyday. Throughout the trip, the battery levels stayed around 60% to 80%, if the company data is to be believed.\n\nThe road ahead\n\nThe entire agenda of using solar panels on electric cars is to increase the range of such vehicles as much as possible. Solar energy acts as the cleanest source of energy for humans and if harnessed efficiently, can effectively bring down the carbon impact of any electric vehicle to zero.\n\nConcept solar roof on a car by Hanergy (Image: Hanergy Thin Film Power)\n\nThe idea is not alien to other OEMs as well. Many major auto makers are in the pursuit of such a vehicle. One that can run for long solely on solar energy. Lightyear recently launched its Lightyear One, that runs on solar energy and claims a combined range of 725 km on a single charge. Toyota recently installed solar panels on its hybrid offering - Prius to make for testing the viability of such an arrangement. If and when the technology looks promising, it won\u2019t be long before such solar panels are found to be mainstream in vehicles.\n\nAs for Hanergy, the company will be looking to collaborate with more partners going forward. The idea is to have a similar setup on other vehicles too, in order to increase their range and decrease dependency on a charging infrastructure, as confirmed by the company CEO Lu Tao in a recent report.", "description": "Hanergy, a Chinese firm producing thin solar panels, has recently joined hands with Jiangsu Joylong Automobile to produce a solar powered car.
