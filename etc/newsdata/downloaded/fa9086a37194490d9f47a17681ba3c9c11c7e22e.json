As Jennifer Lopez told us in Hustlers, \u201cThis whole country is a strip club. You\u2019ve got people throwing the money, and you\u2019ve got people doing the dance.\u201d The proletariat is fed up, and even the youth of TikTok are crying outrage at the billionaire class. The popular art of 2019 is responding, too, with privilege-skewering movies like Ready or Not, Us, and this weekend\u2019s critically festooned Parasite parading through our multiplexes.\n\nCentered on a poor family whose members lie their way into the home of a very wealthy one, the latest film from South Korea\u2019s Bong Joon-ho begins, in the words of Vulture\u2019s E. Alex Jung, as \u201ca black comedy about class differences well suited to our season of scams\u201d before slowly contorting itself into a surreal kind of horror story laced with manipulation, murder, and peaches. \u201cThe way Parasite\u2019s story unfolds from there is like a magic trick. It alternately entertains and devastates, like a candy bar with a razor blade tucked inside.\u201d\n\nSo in honor of rage, Vulture has assembled a list of 30 essential eat-the-rich horror movies for your economic 99 percent enjoyment. A note about what\u2019s included below: We wanted to stick with movies in which the rich or the ruling class got absolutely annihilated, shamed, bankrupted, or had their lives utterly ruined. You might say, \u201cBut American Psycho?\u201d To which you\u2019ll be told, \u201cBut in the end, Patrick Bateman gets to keep on keeping on.\u201d Yes that movie makes the upper crust look like a bunch of assholes, but this list is about movies in which the elite actually pay the price for their indulgences. \u2018Tis the season to be petty.\n\nEl Angel Exterminador (1962)\n\nLuis Bu\u00f1uel\u2019s extremely simple tale of a dinner party gone wrong is surprisingly grotesque. A ritzy society couple invites a group of friends over for an elaborate meal, and after retiring to the music room for drinks they are unable to leave again. Nothing is physically stopping them from exiting, but they are still unable to cross the threshold. Likewise, no one from the outside is able to enter and help them. As the days mount up, the party guests start to lose hope, turn on one another, or go mad as conditions break down and they waste away in their palace of excess.\n\nThe Masque of the Red Death (1964)\n\nIn this Roger Corman adaptation of Edgar Allan Poe\u2019s short story of the same name, Vincent Price plays the heinous Prince Prospero, who we see partying in his castle and terrorizing the poor townspeople. But no man is above death, which Prospero will learn when a red masked presence crashes his grand ball. Nicolas Roeg served as cinematographer for Mask, so you\u2019ve got some titans of cinema bringing you this grandiose fall from grace.\n\nFrogs (1972)\n\nIn this eco-horror movie, it\u2019s nature that\u2019s giving the rich their just desserts. The wealthy Crockett family, presided over by a cantankerous chemical baron, is polluting the island where they live on a sprawling estate. With no regard for the flora and fauna around them, local wildlife starts rising up to protect their land. Fear the frogs!\n\nLa Grande Bouffe (1973)\n\nAlternately titled Blow-Out in the U.S., this Italian cult film skewers the excesses of the wealthy by telling the story of four rich men who come together at a lavish villa with the expressed purpose of eating themselves to death. A twist on the horror genre, La Grande Bouffe makes the simple act of eating gross and stressful by the end, as the men continually shovel food into themselves while entertaining various visitors, including a group of students and several prostitutes. Eat lightly before you watch.\n\nZardoz (1974)\n\nZardoz takes place on a future Earth where humans are divided into two groups: the Brutals, who live terrestrially and worship a giant, floating stone head named Zardoz that spews guns out if its mouth, and the Eternals. The Eternals live in the Vortex, and their lives have been rendered dull and mostly meaningless by technologically enabled immortality, and they live off food grown for them by the earthly class. The movie focuses on a Brutal Exterminator named Zed (Sean Connery) who infiltrates the Vortex and proves to the Eternals that their counterparts aren\u2019t so simple and savage as they assume. Also, Sean Connery wears a small red outfit that basically looks like the dance costumes from the 2018 Suspiria.\n\nThe People Who Own The Dark (1976)\n\nA bunch of rich business and military men gather at a castle for some debauched good times when nuclear war breaks out. Though protected from the initial strike inside the manse, those inhabiting the area around them have all gone blind and are scrounging for resources. Your money and status can\u2019t keep you safe when the people who own the dark start closing in.\n\nEmpire of the Ants (1977)\n\nJoan Collins plays a crooked land developer trying to sell idyllic beachfront property to investors in an area that will never actually be turned into anything. While she\u2019s running her scam, however, toxic waste is seeping into the terrain, resulting in a race of giant, angry ants that begin picking off the investors. Mobilize the working class! Take back what\u2019s yours!\n\nHappy Birthday to Me (1981)\n\nThis excellent Canadian slasher is about a group of popular high-school students known as the \u201cTop Ten\u201d who start getting picked off by a mysterious killer. All the action builds up to a birthday-party finale that deserves much more credit as an all-timer in slasher history.\n\nEating Raoul (1982)\n\nThe Wikipedia description of this comedy-horror movie is just too simple and good not to use: \u201cIt is about a prudish married couple (played by Paul Bartel and Mary Woronov) who, in an effort to raise money to buy their dream restaurant, resort to killing affluent swingers and robbing them.\u201d They just wanna rob. And open a restaurant.\n\nEat the Rich (1987)\n\nAt one point in the trailer for British black comedy\u2013horror satire Eat the Rich, star Lanah P politely says to another character, \u201cHi. We\u2019re starting a people\u2019s uprising. Do you fancy joining us?\u201d Lanah stars as Alex, a server at a fancy restaurant called Bastards who gets fired for being rude to the upscale clientele. From there, there\u2019s a terrorist attack, a fascistic government official running for prime minister, secret KGB agents, emergent anarchists, and somehow more. It also features Miranda Richardson, Lenny Kilmister, Jennifer Saunders, Jools Holland, Sir Paul McCartney, and many more. It\u2019s a messy ride, but it does culminate in Alex having her revenge on Bastards and its patrons.\n\nRabid Grannies (1988)\n\nIf you want to go maximum silly, go with a movie that combines Satanic panic with cannibalism. When the devil-worshipping, ostracized nephew of two elderly sisters is not invited to their birthday party \u2014 and also not included in their will \u2014 he sends a cursed gift along that turns the rich aunts into flesh-eating crazies trying to eat their greedy family members. The title says it all, really.\n\nThey Live (1988)\n\nWhat happens when wrestler \u201cRowdy\u201d Roddy Piper discovers a widespread conspiracy on behalf of conglomerations to control the population through subliminal messaging in media and advertising? John Carpenter\u2019s They Live happens, in which Piper goes on a rampage to weed out the corruption and expose the elite as the skinless corpse-looking aliens that they are. Prepare to kiss ass and chew bubblegum.\n\nSociety (1989)\n\nThanks to the twisted stylings of director Brian Yuzna and his frequent collaborator, effects master Screaming Mad George, Society is a singular visual experience. The adopted teenage son of a high-tone Beverly Hills family has never really fit in with the upper crust, but near the start of Society, young Bill Whitney starts thinking something is truly off about the people who raised him. They\u2019ve always assured him that one day he will contribute so much to \u201csociety,\u201d but they don\u2019t mean that in the way supportive parents typically do. If Bill wants to survive he\u2019s going to have to fight, and he\u2019ll have to survive one of the grossest, weirdest, wildest climaxes in movie history.\n\nThe People Under the Stairs (1991)\n\nThis Wes Craven movie follows a young boy named Fool as he breaks into the home of his conniving landlords to swipe some of the rumored fortune they have stashed in their house. Fool and his mom are about to lose their apartment in the city, and the Robesons don\u2019t care, but once inside their locked-down suburban house, he learns they\u2019re even worse than just being a pair of greedy slumlords. The premise of this list pretty much gives away the ending, but that doesn\u2019t make watching the fall of the incestuous, sadistic Robesons any less enjoyable.\n\nFunny Games (1997/2007)\n\nFilmmaker Michael Haneke directed both the original German-language version of this film as well as the English-language remake ten years later. Both follow a well-to-do family on holiday at their posh lakeside home, who have their vacation interrupted by a pair of clean-cut sadists named Peter and Paul. The young men hold the family hostage in their home and toy with them for hours, even breaking the fourth wall at one point to make us, the viewer, complicit in their violence. This isn\u2019t a feel-good \u201cEat the Rich\u201d movie, but sometimes you have to take your medicine.\n\nLand of the Dead (2005)\n\nGeorge Romero kept his Dead universe alive for almost half a century, and Land was an excellent extension of the franchise that came out 37 years after his original. In Romero\u2019s fourth of his six Dead movies, survival outposts have popped up around the country, and the one in Pittsburgh (naturally) is lorded over by a ruthless Dennis Hopper. Zombie conflicts have always been a great cinematic avatar for dissecting society\u2019s woes, but where you were all-in behind Duane Jones\u2019s Ben in 1968, by 2005 we were ready to root for the undead.\n\nHostel (2005)\n\nIn the halcyon days of the torture-horror era, Eli Roth was king, and Hostel was his signature study in over-the-top brutality. A couple of college students go on a trip to eastern Europe and get snatched up by a super-secret group of elites who pay to torture people to death. Humorously, Hostel: Part 2 is ultimately a victory for the ultra-rich over the regular rich, but the first movie is all about every-guy Jay Hernandez killing his way out of a death basement.\n\nYou\u2019re Next (2011)\n\nAlmost every character in You\u2019re Next is an asshole, which makes rooting for their demise at the hands of pig-masked strangers a pretty easy ask. The setting is a family gathering at a spacious country abode, and in addition to cheering hard for Sharni Vinson as the outstanding horror heroine, Erin, you\u2019ll be giving multiple rounds of applause as each of these privileged bastards bites the dust.\n\nThe Purge Franchise (2013-Present)\n\nSome Purge movies hit the Wall Street versus Main Street issue harder than others, but this entire franchise is about the have-nots killing each other to keep the haves in power by annually thinning out the ranks of the 99 percent \u2014 and how the lower classes will fight back to destroy the Man in whatever capacity they can. Do you want to see street justice served to religious zealots, state-sponsored white supremacists, and smug old white men laughing at the poors as their blood is spilled during a night of limitless crime? Plug in for a long Purge marathon.\n\nStoker (2013)\n\nPark Chan-wook\u2019s only English-language movie enters this list through a side door. While there are no members of the proletariat pounding at the door of the Stoker family home to burn the rich folk inside alive, it is like watching an excruciating, slow dismembering of miserable privileged people at their own hands. Director Park is cinema\u2019s foremost purveyor of perverted domestic discord, and Stoker makes antagonists of each of its characters. Money isn\u2019t buying anyone here happiness, but the self-immolation might make us commoners feel better!\n\nSnowpiercer (2013)\n\nWhen the grime-covered steerage dwellers finally start advancing through the caste system of train cars in humanity\u2019s last outpost \u2014 as the train itself speeds on a loop of track around the world to avoid freezing in the subarctic temperatures outside \u2014 you\u2019ll be shouting \u201cLead us to salvation, Chris Evans!\u201d at your screen. (Don\u2019t act like you didn\u2019t already do the same for America\u2019s Ass.) Snowpiercer, a sci-fi film that dips into the horror well, is a bleak affair for basically everyone involved, but at least the ruling class gets a dose of what they deserve. If the repressed class is going down, they\u2019re taking the gluttonous rich with them into hell\u2019s icy ninth circle.\n\nThe Man in the Orange Jacket (2014)\n\nHere\u2019s a rare entry: a Latvian horror movie. After a rich industrialist lays off hundreds of workers, one of the former employees makes his way to the man\u2019s secluded mansion for some street justice. But instead of fleeing the scene, the killer decides to borrow the life of luxury around him. Wearing the robes of the rich, however, also comes with a price, so consider The Man in the Orange Jacket a kind of communist warning about the perils of joining the vanguard.\n\nMaps to the Stars (2014)\n\nIf you\u2019ve followed Mia Wasikowska\u2019s career even a little bit, it shouldn\u2019t surprise you that she appears twice on this list. In David Cronenberg\u2019s set-Hollywood-on-fire drama from 2014, Wasikowska plays a mysterious woman who ingratiates herself to an emotionally frail movie star, played by Julianne Moore. She becomes her assistant, but it\u2019s all a ruse to get closer to the actress\u2019 New Age-y therapist (John Cusack), whom she holds a deep, dark grudge against. Everything about this movie is either sad or sick or uncomfortable or a combination of all three, and Wasikowska is like some ghostly avenging demon sent to knock down people so insulated by their wealth that they become monsters.\n\nHigh-Rise (2015)\n\nFeeling nihilistic? Try this black-hearted drama from Ben Wheatley! Movies about societies organized vertically by status are such a tidy vessel for these kinds of themes. There are dystopian living systems, class structures organized by elevation, opportunities for catastrophic physical destruction of architecture that represents life itself \u2014 and High-Rise has all of those things! Tom Hiddelston plays a doctor who\u2019s just moved into a (mostly) luxury-apartment tower that\u2019s on the brink of civil war. Tensions are rising between the haves and the have-nots, and the building is buckling under the strain. Let it burn!\n\nOffice (2015)\n\nWhen a middle manager at some bland corporate office snaps and kills his entire family and then disappears, a young woman starts work at the same company just as his former co-workers try to piece together the mystery of his psychotic break \u2014 and his unknown whereabouts. Despite her best efforts, the shy woman doesn\u2019t quite fit in at work, and the longer she\u2019s there the more resentful she becomes of her dismissive superiors. She also gets more and more curious about the missing murderer, and develops a dangerous sympathy for what might have driven him to snap. The message here: Always be good to your interns.\n\nMayhem (2017)\n\nDerek Cho (Steven Yeun) is a corporate drone at a large consulting firm whom we meet just as a virus called ID-7 is tearing across the world. It\u2019s not deadly, but it turns the infected into rage monsters acting out their most violent impulses, and it hits Derek\u2019s office the same day he learns he\u2019s the scapegoat for a huge corporate screwup. After being fired, Derek teams with a woman (Samara Weaving) who has just had a loan extension callously rejected by the company, and with the building under quarantine they resolve to make their way to the executive floors to get justice for their unfair treatment. This one is a rager for the working men and women!\n\nThe Killing of a Sacred Deer (2017)\n\nWriter and director Yorgos Lanthimos really thrives in making discomfort cinema. The horror-thriller Sacred Deer showcases the filmmaker\u2019s signature halting, unnatural style of dialogue and centers on a wealthy surgeon (Colin Farrell) whose odd relationship with an even odder teen boy (Barry Keoghan) starts to take a toll on his life. The boy wants a father figure, but when the surgeon is unable to make enough time for him, the young man starts insinuating himself into the rich man\u2019s pristine home and family. And then people start getting severely, inexplicably sick. After Deer, it might be a long time before you\u2019re comfortable eating spaghetti or listening to Ellie Goulding again.\n\nVelvet Buzzsaw (2019)\n\nThere are few cultural enclaves that feel more walled off than the world of fine art, which is saturated with pretension and deep-pocketed connoisseurs. So how better to punish the greedy than having the art itself fight back? The deceased painter who created the works was no angel himself, but he made it pretty damn clear that everything he made should have been destroyed upon his death, and now these high-brow gallery mavens are going to get their comeuppance. There\u2019s also a hobo robot art piece that kills people, so don\u2019t miss out.\n\nUs (2019)\n\nDo you know where your tether is? Do you know what they\u2019re doing now? Have you prepared for the coming overthrow?\n\nReady or Not (2019)\n\nReady or Not is what I like to call \u201cmelee horror,\u201d the kind of genre movie that\u2019s all about lots of people dying in crazy ways and commits as much to action as it does to terror. In it, Samara Weaving plays a brand-new bride forced to participate in an initiation ritual with her new, exorbitantly wealthy in-laws before they fully accept her. She has to pull a card from a deck and whatever game is listed on that card is the one she has to play. Sadly for the bride, she pulls the deadly \u201cHide and Seek\u201d option, which means the family aims to hunt her down and kill her before the sun rises. Weaving has quickly cemented herself as a melee-horror queen, and Ready or Not is the exact sort of cinematic schadenfreude you want on a Friday night.", "description": "Bong Joon-ho\u2019s Parasite joins a grand cinematic tradition of horror movies with bleak views on the rich.
