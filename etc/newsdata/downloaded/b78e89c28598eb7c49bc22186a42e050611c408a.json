Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Kamala Harris of California says President Trump\u2019s Twitter account \u201cshould be suspended.\u201d\n\n\"I think there is plenty of now evidence to suggest that he is irresponsible with his words in a way that could result in harm to other people and so the privilege of using those words in that way should probably be taken away from him,\" Harris said in an interview.\n\nFurther proof that Kamala would make a bad president. Her instinct when faced with something: ban it.\n\nKAMALA HARRIS CALLS FOR SUSPENSION OF TRUMP'S TWITTER ACCOUNT AMID WHISTLEBLOWER TWEETS\n\nReally, she's not going to help herself by \"de-tweeting\" Trump. If anything, that might help him. He'd just launch his own message board, and the media would cover that even more breathlessly.\n\nWithout Trump\u2019s asides, the media would have to start covering real news, which actually takes work. Besides, we'd all resent Harris for taking away one of the most striking phenomena in political history: a leader who communicates directly with the people, cutting out the middleman known as \"us,\" the media.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nObnoxious or not, it\u2019s the most transparent advancement in politics. It\u2019s the opposite of choreographed interviews between politicians and hacks that allowed both phonies to prosper.\n\nNo wonder Harris hates it. She's terrible at being authentic. She's as real as spandex. As credible as a gas station chili dog. I've never seen a candidate so uncomfortable in her own pantsuit. Well, maybe \u2026\n\nThe only person who laughs more at their own jokes is Batman\u2019s Joker.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nThere's a weird reflex among liberals these days not to engage in dialogue, but to simply suppress it. Instead of debating each other, dump the interesting voices. Instead of listening to the other side, call them \"despicable\" or \"deplorable.\"\n\nInstead of accepting an election, resist it and call it illegitimate. What do all these tactics have in common? They only work if you know you're a loser.\n\nAdapted from Greg Gutfeld\u2019s monologue on \"The Five\" on Oct. 1, 2019.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM GREG GUTFELD", "description": "Kamala Harris wants Twitter to suspend PresidentTrump's account.
