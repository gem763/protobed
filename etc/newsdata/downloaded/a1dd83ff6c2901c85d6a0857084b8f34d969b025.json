Shares of 3M Co. MM, -2.70% sank 4.4% after the maker of Post-it notes, Scotch tape and other industrial and health-care products reported third-quarter profit that beat expectations but revenue that missed. The company also cut its full-year earnings outlook. Net income rose to $1.58 billion, or $1.72 a share, from $1.54 billion, or $2.58 a share, in the year ago period. A decline in the Dow component was cutting 50 points from the Dow because a dollar move in any one of the blue-chip index's components equates to a 6.8-point swing. The Dow recently was down 65 points, or 0.3%, at 26,765, while the S&P 500 index was trading flat at 3,005, and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.39% was advancing 0.4% at 8,149.", "description": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average touched session lows Thursday morning, as a key component knocked roughly 50 points from the price-weighted blue-chip index....", "authors": ["Mark Decambre"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
