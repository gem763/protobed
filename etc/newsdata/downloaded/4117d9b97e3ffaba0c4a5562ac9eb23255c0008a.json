(Jim Young/REUTERS)\n\nI agree with every word of Jonah\u2019s post below about Glenn Beck\u2019s truly bizarre endorsement of Donald Trump\u2019s masculinity. But let\u2019s go just a bit deeper. There are theological implications to Trump rationalizations \u2014 especially in a movement so thick with Christian conservatives.\n\nThe redefinition of good character that we so often see on the Trump right reminds me of the powerful words contained in the Southern Baptist Convention\u2019s 1998 resolution on the moral character of public officials. At the height of the Clinton scandals, the Baptists rightly declared, \u201cTolerance of serious wrong by leaders sears the conscience of the culture, spawns unrestrained immorality and lawlessness in the society, and surely results in God\u2019s judgment.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe interesting question is how does tolerance of wrong sear the conscience? The answer lies deep within human nature. It\u2019s easy to justify a one-time event like a vote as a defensible choice between the lesser of two evils, but few people can stomach being a part of a movement that\u2019s simply \u201cless evil.\u201d People want to be a part of something good. We want to be a part of something that we\u2019re proud of, and we\u2019ll go to great lengths to rationalize that movement even when its leaders turn out to be bad \u2014 especially when we see no way to purge those leaders and replace them with better men or women.\n\nOlder conservatives can\u2019t forget the extent to which many Democrats not only defended Bill Clinton on the legal merits of the claims against him, but also the extent to which they attempted to change public attitudes about sexual morality. Having a mistress was suddenly no big deal, and parts of the cultural elite purported to long for the greater sophistication of the European public \u2014 where wives and mistresses could allegedly even know and respect each other. Younger progressives who\u2019ve grown up in the era of heightened awareness of sexual power dynamics would be stunned at the arguments of their parents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis same impulse is now at work on the Right. Republicans want to be proud of their president. They want to believe their movement isn\u2019t just better than the Democrats, but that it\u2019s actually good and decent and virtuous. And so they rationalize Trump. They make excuses. Make no mistake, there are many, many decent Republicans doing heroic work across the country and who see Trump clearly, but there are also too many Republicans who are busy trying to transform Trump\u2019s vices into virtues. They\u2019re rejecting the \u201clesser evil\u201d by redefining it as good, and they\u2019re damaging their credibility and Christian witness in the process.", "description": "There are many Republicans doing heroic work and who see Trump clearly, but there are also too many Republicans trying to turn his vices into virtues.", "authors": ["David French", "Andrew C.
