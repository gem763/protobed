OK, Make that five percent of one percent, because so far, some 1,500 folks . . . let me rephrase that \u2013 \u201ca tiny band of brothers and sisters, consisting of only 1,500 selfless and generous souls\u201d \u2013 have sent in a donation to help NR pay for some of its general needs, and to underwrite our legal costs in National Review v. Mann, the nation\u2019s premier defense (guess who is waging the defense, and we will give a clue: It\u2019s not Mann) of your First Amendment free-speech rights.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf the One Percenters, here are some who not only gave moolah, but also an additional two cents (yes, of wisdom, of encouragement) \u2013 would that their words convince you to join in their select few and enjoy the privileges of conservative camaraderie.\n\nRichard from Riverside, CT drops a healthy 200 bucks on us and points a finger: \u201cKatherine Timpf made me do it. NR has a sense of humor that I would miss if NR didn\u2019t exist.\u201d Yes Kat is funny, very, regardless of the hair extensions, but more so, she is an ace colleague. And you Richard are an ace supporter.\n\nFrom way over in Stockholm, Peter spots us a twenty and hails us for our long-distance value: \u201cKeep up with your good and important work \u2014 important even for us in Sweden.\u201d Can\u2019t wait to visit you Peter and say thanks over a reindeer burger!\n\nLawrence in Montgomery, AL puts down the Websters to donate $100: \u201cReading the broad range of topics and competing opinions presented in NR helps me clarify my thinking and remember vocabulary I seldom hear in my daily life. Thanks for all.\u201d You have our sincere gratitude for your unparsimoniousness.\n\nBig Bad Dave in Gainseville, FL fingers two crisp Ben Franklins in his wallet, extracts them, and sends them our way, along with this message: \u201cBravissimo to the NR Team. You are, indeed, faithfully doing your part to help the people \u2018keeping it a Republic.\u2019\u201d Bravissimoest to you!\n\nRick from Alexandria, VA throws $50 into the till and nails the landing: \u201cConsistently great writing on the most important issues of our time.\u201d\n\nDana from Up North where the Mounties roam sends $100 (U.S.!) and calls on the Big Guy to do some smoting: \u201cSo, so wrong \u2013 the frivolous charge, the money, the time \u2013 may God arrange reform and justice.\u201d Indeed, may He!\n\nStephen from Nampa, ID dodges the rush-hour traffic to send in a very generous $200, plus this can\u2019t-get-much-higher praise: \u201cNational Review Online is the single greatest commentary site in these dark political times. Keep up the good work.\u201d God bless ya Stephen. Really.\n\nThanks in part to the good people cited here, our campaign now nears the $160,000 in contributions received. Jehosephat thanks, but honest to goodness, we could use double that, and then some. We get some more folks \u2013 you! \u2013 to join the One Percenters and we will get there. Your membership in the Band of Brothers and Sisters awaits: Join by donating here.\n\nHey, someone asked: Is that donation tax-deductible? Let me answer with a question: Are your political contributions? We\u2019re in the freedom-defending battle now, the combat is hand-to-hand, the grenades being rolled in our direction, so please, if those thoughts matter to you, make them un-matter. We need your selfless support. Thanks in advance for it, and one last thing: If you prefer to send a check, make one payable to \u201cNational Review\u201d and mail it to National Review, ATTN: 2019 Fall Webathon, 19 West 44th Street, Suite 1701, New York, NY 10036.", "description": "Some 1,500 folks have sent in a donation to help NR pay for some of its general needs \u2014 not quite one percent of our readers, but we're thankful nevertheless.", "authors": ["Jack Fowler", "Ilya Shapiro", "Tobias Hoonhout", "Kevin D.
