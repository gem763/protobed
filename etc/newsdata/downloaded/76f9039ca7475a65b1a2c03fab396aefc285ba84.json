Trump\u2019s argument, injected into him by subordinates who understand that absurdity is his vocation, is essentially that the Constitution\u2019s impeachment provisions are unconstitutional.\n\nThe canine loyalty of Senate Republicans will keep Trump in office. But until he complies with House committee subpoenas, the House must not limply hope federal judges will enforce their oversight powers. Instead, the House should wield its fundamental power, that of the purse, to impose excruciating costs on executive branch noncompliance. This can be done.\n\nIn 13 months, all congressional Republicans who have not defended Congress by exercising \u201cthe constitutional rights of the place\u201d should be defeated. If congressional Republicans continue their genuflections at Trump\u2019s altar, the appropriate 2020 outcome will be a Republican thrashing so severe \u2014 losing the House, the Senate and the electoral votes of, say, Georgia, Arizona, North Carolina and even Texas \u2014 that even this party of slow-learning careerists might notice the hazards of tethering their careers to a downward-spiraling scofflaw.", "description": "", "authors": ["George Will", "Washingtonpost.Com Opinions The-Spiraling-President-Adds-Self-Impeachment-To-His-Repertoire"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
