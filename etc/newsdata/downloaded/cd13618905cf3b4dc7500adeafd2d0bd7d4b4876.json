Especially in comedy, you do stuff six or seven years ago that wouldn\u2019t be okay now for good reason so I only speak for myself but, like anybody, you have to grow,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a good thing. I\u2019m never interested in upsetting anybody.\u201d\n\nGillis\u2019 comments, in which he called Chinese people \u201cchinks\u201d and denigrated Chinese accents, and mocked comedians who have spoken out about mental health as \u201cwhite faggot comics,\u201d were made in September 2018 in two episodes of his podcast.\n\nRob Schneider, another \u201cSNL\u201d alum, weighed in last week to support Gillis, blaming the \u201cera of cultural unforgiveness\u201d for the uproar. Many others, including actor Sandra Oh, who hosted \u201cSNL\u201d earlier this year, said the NBC comedy show was right to fire Gillis.\n\nWatch Hader\u2019s answer to backstage questions at the Emmys above.", "description": "The \"Saturday Night Live\" alum is the latest to comment following the show's decision to fire Shane Gillis for racist and homophobic comments.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8854b52100005b00ea04e8.jpeg?cache=muezhutcuu&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
