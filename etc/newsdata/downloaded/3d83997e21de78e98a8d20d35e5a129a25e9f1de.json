Ten will also announce the launch of real-time ad availability for purchases and dynamic ad insertion, where ads can be targeted based on content and user.\n\n\"It allows end-to-end automation for our advertisers, which takes all the friction out of the transaction, will operate across all our suite of broadcast channels and then the evolution will be that it will go across all our broadcast and digital channels,\" Mr Prosser said.\n\nTen will also unveil a partnership with You.i TV which will add new ad formats into the network's broadcast video on-demand service 10Play, such as ads while credits play and ads while a program is paused. It has also signed new data partnerships with Quantium, Eyeota and Greater Data to help create more targeted ads.\n\nTen, which is owned by US giant CBS, brought its ad sales business back in-house in January this year. Foxtel's ad sales business, now known as Foxtel Media, had run the network's sales since 2015 when the pay-TV business took a 15 per cent stake in Ten.\n\nIn 2017, Ten went into administration and was bought by CBS. In August last year, Ten announced it would bring its sales back in-house.\n\n'Bold moves'\n\nTen will also announce on Thursday the three new judges for MasterChef, after long-time hosts Matt Preston, Gary Mehigan and George Calombaris left the network following a pay dispute.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther programming announcements will include Survivor All-Stars in early 2020. After losing broadcast rights to the Big Bash League Twenty20 cricket tournament in 2018, Ten has restructured its schedule to run prime-time programming 50 weeks a year.\n\n\"At last year\u2019s upfront, we talked about how we would have a 50-week schedule starting very early in January and taking it right through to December. In order to do that and effectively add 10 weeks of prime-time programs to the schedule, you kind of have to make some big bold moves,\" Ten chief content officer Beverley McGarvey said.\n\n\"Some of the moves at the top of the year paid off really well and some of them we kind of need to improve. In this second half, as well as established hits like Survivor, Bachelor and Bachelorette, we\u2019ve added both The Masked Singer and Amazing Race.\"", "description": "There are more than 2 million Australian SMEs, but they have generally shied away from television networks due to the cost of ads.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3077%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_354%2C$y_210/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/20adfc293e614325f38c57106f569d15a106fb3c", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
