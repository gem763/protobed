On Saturday, Biden accused Trump of an \u201coverwhelming abuse of power\u201d.\n\nLeaving the White House for Texas and Ohio before continuing to New York and the United Nations General Assembly, Trump denied wrongdoing and told reporters he was \u201cnot looking to hurt Biden, but he did a very dishonest thing\u201d.\n\nAides and allies attacked more fiercely.\n\n\u201cSwamp media says Biden corruption disproven,\u201d Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor now Trump\u2019s personal attorney, wrote on Twitter. \u201cTypical lie.\u201d\n\nThe claims about Ukraine concern Hunter Biden\u2019s work for a gas company in the country and a visit by the then vice-president in March 2016, in which he pressed for the firing of the country\u2019s top prosecutor, an aim of the US, its allies, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.\n\nAn investigation into the company for which Hunter Biden worked was dormant at the time. In May 2019, the Ukraine prosecutor general told Bloomberg, \u201cWe do not see any wrongdoing\u201d by the Bidens.\n\nGiuliani, who has admitted seeking to pressure Ukrainian authorities to investigate the Bidens, claimed on Sunday: \u201cThree Ukrainian prosecutors on tape saying case fixed and dismissed because of Biden pressure. Tapes available to the Swamp media. But there is much more proof. Witnesses, documents, millions in circuitous wire transfers \u2026 more to come.\u201d\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that in a 25 July call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Trump asked eight times for the Bidens to be investigated.\n\nThe call is reportedly the subject of an intelligence services whistleblower complaint which the White House is refusing to release to Congress.\n\nIt has been suggested that Trump may have threatened to withhold US military aid to Ukraine if it did not accede to his demands. About a month after the call, $250m in military assistance to a country fighting Russian-backed separatists was delayed. The aid was released this month, after the existence of the whistleblower complaint became public.\n\nChris Murphy, a Democrat on the Senate foreign relations committee, told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on Sunday: \u201cThe timing is obviously incredibly suspicious.\u201d\n\nTrump has denied such a move and on Friday the Ukrainian foreign minister said the aid was not discussed in the July call, which he characterised as \u201clong and friendly\u201d.\n\nBut Trump has not denied asking Zelinskiy about Biden and Ukraine. On Sunday he said his conversation with the Ukrainian leader was \u201cperfect\u201d and there was \u201cno quid pro quo\u201d.\n\nThe former vice-president, who in Iowa on Saturday said \u201cTrump is using this because he knows I\u2019ll beat him like a drum\u201d, has called for the transcript of the call to be released. So have allies of Trump.\n\nIt is not certain that the call is the subject of the whistleblower complaint, which Trump\u2019s acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, has refused, against legal precedent, to release to Congress.\n\nBut Adam Schiff, the Democratic chair of the House intelligence committee, told CNN\u2019s State of the Union on Sunday: \u201cClearly [Trump] is afraid of the public seeing such things.\u201d\n\nOn the same show, treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin said even showing the complaint to leaders in Congress \u201cwould be a terrible precedent\u201d, as conversations between world leaders should be confidential and not released after \u201cpolitical complaints\u201d.\n\nMnuchin repeatedly said he did not know what was said on the call between Trump and Zelinskiy, a line followed by secretary of state Mike Pompeo in appearances on ABC\u2019s This Week and CBS\u2019s Face the Nation.\n\nSchiff made unusually strong remarks about the prospects of Trump being impeached over the Ukraine issue, as it meant \u201cWe may have crossed the Rubicon\u201d.\n\nOf Giuliani\u2019s admitted behaviour, he said \u201cbetraying your country \u2026 is one thing when it\u2019s done by the court jester, another thing when by the man who would be king.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats are already exploring impeachment proceedings over Trump\u2019s links to Russian interference in the 2016 election. Schiff cited Senate Republican opposition to impeachment as one reason still to go slow, but said Democrats needed to establish public support.\n\nTrump and Zelinskiy are due to meet on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York next week.\n\nIn his tweets, Giuliani linked to a 2015 New York Times report about Hunter Biden and Ukraine and promised to \u201clay out some of the evidence of Ukraine corruption\u201d on Fox News Sunday.\n\nTrump seemed likely to be watching. On Saturday night, he repeated a Fox analyst\u2019s suggestion that the whistleblower may have been \u201can American spy \u2026 spying on our own president\u201d.", "description": "White House attacks amid whistleblower scandal after Biden strikes back at Trump over corruption claims", "authors": ["Martin Pengelly", "Victoria Bekiempis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/032767d73a204b4a86249f145cd451c6ae594f2f/0_164_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d9df951aa74b5d3dbb8a5f4777086c80", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
