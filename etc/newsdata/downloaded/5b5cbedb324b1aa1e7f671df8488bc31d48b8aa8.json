REEUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann\n\nOpposition to the deal has been growing, with a Reuters survey showing owners of at least 30% of Sunrise shares, including German group Freenet (FNTGn.DE), are set to reject a 2.8 billion Swiss franc equity issue at an extraordinary shareholder meeting on Oct. 23.\n\nSunrise needs a simple majority to back the equity issue, which has been scaled back from 4.1 billion Swiss francs, although the debt component has risen.\n\n\u201cOn balance, Sunrise appears to be overpaying for assets in a transaction that appears to have debatable long-term strategic merit. As such, shareholders are recommended to vote against the transaction at this time,\u201d ISS said in a document seen by Reuters.\n\n\u201cOur valuation analysis suggests a fair value range of 4.6 - 5.2 billion Swiss francs (enterprise value) for UPC on a standalone basis if its performance were in line with that of peer cable operators,\u201d ISS said, adding that operational difficulties including declining revenues made the 6.3 billion franc consideration appear excessive.\n\nSunrise shares were up 2.3% at 1222 GMT.\n\nActivist investor AOC welcomed ISS\u2019s recommendation. \u201cIt confirms our view. It increases the likelihood that the bad deal will fall through,\u201d a spokesman for AOC, which holds a stake of under 3% in Sunrise, said.\n\nBerenberg analyst Usman Ghazi said approval of the deal looked more unlikely now. \u201cThe ball seems to be in Liberty\u2019s court if they want to save the deal,\u201d he said, adding it was not usually Liberty\u2019s style to back down from their negotiation position.\n\nLiberty Global did not return requests for comment.\n\nA Sunrise spokeswoman said the company was examining the details of ISS\u2019s recommendation and would comment in due course.\n\nProxy adviser ISS said it saw \u201cseemingly limited downside risk for Sunrise shares in rejecting the deal\u201d, but shareholders would have to bear the cost of the break-up fee payable in that case.\n\nISS is planning to send out the recommendation to the media on Friday.", "description": "Proxy adviser ISS recommended shareholders vote against a rights issue that will allow Sunrise Communications to finance a 6.3 billion Swiss franc ($6.35 billion) purchase of cable operator UPC from Liberty Global , in a report sent to clients on Thursday.", "authors": ["Oliver Hirt", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439228010&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF990VC", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
