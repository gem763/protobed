Obesity is killing him. Do not serve this man.\u2019\n\nNow, 12 months later and one week shy of his target date, Dibsy, from Middlesbrough, has beaten his aim of losing 20st within a year.\n\nDibsy embarked on the epic weight loss journey last October after doctors warned he was \u2018eating himself to death\u2019 (Picture: Mike Hind/SWNS)\n\nOne of Mike\u2019s first steps was to draft this poster warning Dibsy\u2019s favourite takeaway\u2019s to stop serving him (Picture: Mike Hind/SWNS)\n\nThis time last year Dibsy couldn\u2019t walk up the stairs, wear a seat belt, fit in the bath or travel on public transport (Picture: Mike Hind/SWNS)\n\nSince turning his life around he\u2019s competed in the Great North Run, fought in a charity boxing match and climbed Ben Nevis (Picture: SWNS)\n\nDibsy\u2019s fitness regime saw him burn 3,000 calories a day (Picture: SWNS)\n\n\u2018How can you put into words what has happened?\u2019 Mike said. \u2018Twelve months ago Dibsy was told he was going to die if he didn\u2019t lose weight.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe added: \u2018When I first met him, I couldn\u2019t believe it. He could hardly walk a flight of stairs. He walked up the stairs to my office and he was screaming in pain because he wasn\u2019t used to it.\u2019\n\nSince beginning his weight loss journey Dibsy has won a charity boxing match, completed the Great North Run and found himself a girlfriend.\n\nAnd trainer Mike said it was all down to Dibsy\u2019s hard work.\n\n\u2018I cannot fault Dibsy,\u2019 he added. \u2018He did everything I asked of him and did everything that was expected.\u2019\n\nDuring an appearance on This Morning earlier this year Dibsy said the fitness regime had been \u2018difficult\u2019, but added he was \u2018enjoying it\u2019.\n\n\u2018The training is hard. I lay in bed at night and think it\u2019s going to be hard tomorrow, but I know I\u2019ve got to do it,\u2019 he said.\n\nDibsy at the Masbody Gym in Middlesborough (Picture: SWNS)\n\nAmong his many achievements over the last year is finding himself a girlfriend (Picture: SWNS)\n\nDibsy was due to be officially weighed next week in front of TV crews, but Mike decided to do it early and was astonished at the result.\n\nHe now hopes to raise enough money for an operation to remove his excess skin, left behind by the dramatic weight loss.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve been consulting with plastic surgeons but he is healthy enough to go into an operation and there will be more news on that soon,\u2019 Mike said.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s now got a girlfriend and he\u2019s very happy, he met someone on his journey.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s not just saved his life, he\u2019s changed it for the better.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
