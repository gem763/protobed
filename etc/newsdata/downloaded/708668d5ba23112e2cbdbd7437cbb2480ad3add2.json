It\u2019s weird to think that someone actually hunts those harmless creatures that hang out on your wall.\n\nSugandhi, who goes by one name, is the head of the operation and the principal of his village\u2019s primary school.\n\nHe only got into the business in 2008, but villagers of Kapetakan have been in the gecko trade for much longer. They also dabble in the frog and snake business, but it's geckos that bring in the big bucks.\n\nThrough his business, Sugandhi creates jobs for his neighbours. His hunters are spread out across six villages. After a day of catching geckos, they gather them at Sugandhi\u2019s house every evening. Their methods are simple; they hunt with only a flashlight and a stick smeared with glue. They go around residents\u2019 homes, looking out for the little critters, catching them with the sticks, and depositing them into a basket.\n\nThe geckos are usually dead by the time they reach Sugandhi\u2019s house, where he gives hunters Rp40.000 (US$2.80) per kilogram. The geckos are then rinsed with water and a powdered detergent to remove the slimy film that covers their bodies. Sugandhi\u2019s helpers then roast the geckos for two hours and leave them under the sun until they dry out and turn dark brown.\n\nThe women take over the final step: packaging. Each woman packs between 30 to 40 units a day, each weighing 0.1 kilograms. The geckos are sold in packs of ten at Rp250.000 (US$17.53) per kilogram.\n\nThe geckos are sold as an alternative medicine for itchy skin and allergies, despite little to no scientific evidence. They are also an ingredient in various types of cosmetics. Sugandhi says his biggest buyers are from China and the United States.\n\nScroll down to see more photos of the bizarre gecko-hunting operation:", "description": "Thousands of dead, dehydrated geckos in piles is a surreal sight, but it\u2019s one village\u2019s source of livelihood.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d6581f5c346d60008659669/lede/1566933654099-cicak-8.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.845440881763527xh;center,center&resize=1200:*"}
