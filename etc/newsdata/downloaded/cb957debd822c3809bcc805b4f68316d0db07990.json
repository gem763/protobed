An earthquake struck about 15 miles southeast of the facility some 15 hours before the fire.\n\nContra Costa County Fire District spokesman Steve Hill told reporters Wednesday it\u2019s too early to know what caused the blaze but investigators were evaluating whether the earthquake had anything to do with it.\n\nThe temblor was blamed for flaring at two refineries in Martinez, Calif.\n\n\u201cThe fires that burned yesterday afternoon and well into the evening are both out,\u201d Hill said. \u201cWe are continuing to work to make sure we don\u2019t have a re-occurrence of those fires.\u201d\n\nThe fire at NuStar burned two ethanol storage tanks and charred a third. Vapor was still escaping from unburned ethanol collecting in a containment area, he said.\n\nHill said the blaze injured one firefighter, who was treated at an area hospital.\n\nCounty health officials issued a shelter-in-place order for about 12,000 people nearby, which was lifted late Tuesday, and closed four area schools Wednesday. Officials temporarily closed Interstate 80, causing commuter problems Tuesday evening.", "description": "Oct. 16 (UPI) \u2014 Northern California fire officials said Wednesday that a 4.5-magnitude earthquake could be to blame for an explosion and fire at a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
