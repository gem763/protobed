Nothing could be further from the truth. There was absolutely nothing aggressive about that encounter. Brooke did not do or say anything to object. She certainly did not cry. She was a fully enthusiastic and willing partner.\"\n\n\u2014 Matt Lauer\n\nLauer said Nevils and he had multiple sexual encounters after the Olympics. When he ended the illicit relationship, he said Nevils filed a complaint with NBC \"in an effort to rekindle the affair.\"\n\n\"I attempted to go back to my life and pretend as if nothing had happened. I understand how that must have made her feel. However, being upset or having second thoughts does not give anyone the right to make false accusations years later about an affair in which they fully and willingly participated.\"\n\nNBC said in a statement to Farrow: \"Matt Lauer\u2019s conduct was appalling, horrific and reprehensible, as we said at the time. That\u2019s why he was fired within 24 hours of us first learning of the complaint. Our hearts break again for our colleague.\"\n\nGo deeper: Ronan Farrow's new book accuses Matt Lauer of raping NBC colleague", "description": "In the wake of misconduct claims, Lauer said, \"My silence has been a mistake.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/vAQoMZCrF5ylCS3h8UoyjT4qWKM=/0x59:3000x1747/1920x1080/2019/10/09/1570634498444.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
