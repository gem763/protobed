Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 10, 2019\n\nTrump has repeatedly said in recent days that he would punish Turkey if they cross certain lines, but he has not specified what those inappropriate actions would be.\n\nThe White House announced Sunday night that it would remove its troops from northern Syria. By Wednesday morning, Turkey had begun carrying out a military operation against Kurdish forces in northeastern Syria.\n\nThe U.S. military relied on the Syrian Democratic Forces, which is led by the Kurds, as the local ground force fighting ISIS. But Ankara considers the Syrian Kurds terrorists who are an extension of a Kurdish insurgency within Turkey.\n\nLawmakers have lined up to slam Trump's shift in strategy, arguing it will lay the foundation for a resurgence of ISIS and lead to a potential slaughter of Kurdish forces.
