I've helped retirees create a plan to make their money last, and I've helped young people determine how much to save and invest each month. I've also coached individuals and couples on how to spend less, save more, and get their money to work on their behalf.\n\nThroughout all of that, I've noticed plenty of trends \u2014 and this includes some habits that six-figure earners seem to have. While the job you have definitely plays a role in your income, a lot that goes into earning $100,000 or more each year has to do with mindset.\n\nWant to know what it takes to become a six-figure earner? Here are some habits six-figure earners have that you may want to pick up.\n\n1. They refuse to settle for jobs with limited income potential\n\nNo matter your mindset or work ethic, you aren't going to become a six-figure earner if you accept a job that pays $38,000 per year. High earners know this, so they gravitate toward jobs that offer better pay or even unlimited income potential.\n\nThis usually means finding a job in sales or even becoming an entrepreneur \u2014 but really any type of job with flexible earning potential could be a good fit.\n\nMy job as a financial adviser definitely fits with this \"habit\" and is probably why I ended up in this field to begin with. I distinctly remember earning $19,676 in 2004, which was my first year as a financial adviser. Even though that's a very low salary, the job still came with the potential to earn more.\n\nThat's ultimately why I stayed, then went on to start my own business (including my website, Good Financial Cents). I never wanted my income to be constant and totally dependent on someone else. I wanted to bet on myself.\n\n2. They have a morning routine\n\nSix-figure earners don't normally hit the snooze button five or six times and get to work at the last minute. Instead, they tend to have a \"routine\" that helps them perform at their best. This usually means they get up early, exercise several times per week, meditate, and/or pray.\n\nIf the thought of having a morning routine stresses you out, keep in mind that most high earners with fixed daily routines absolutely love the way their daily actions and habits improve their lives over the long haul.\n\nBy getting up early, taking care of your body, and taking the time to nurture your spiritual health, you may find you're better at your job and happier with your life.\n\n3. They create short-term and long-term goals\n\nAnother interesting quirk you'll find about six-figure earners is that they're always creating new goals \u2014 both for the short-term and the long-term. They don't just let life pass them by, they figure out what they want and take the time to map out plans that will help them get it.\n\nThis is exactly why the wealthy are often way ahead of the game when it comes to retirement savings, paying off their mortgage, and saving for college. Yes, six-figure earners have more money to \"play with,\" but they also create plans that have their money working for them.\n\nA financial adviser can help you figure out your long- and short-term money goals. Use SmartAsset's free tool to find a certified financial planner near you \u00bb\n\nPersonally, I review my income goals every 90 days. This lets me assess where I am and if I'm making progress, which is crucial when you want to take your career to the next level.\n\n4. They are always learning\n\nSix-figure earners usually seem to know that they don't know everything, which is why they tend to be lifelong learners. This could mean they're always taking courses online, but it can also mean they always have their nose in a book.\n\nThe reality is that there is always something to learn. Six-figure earners are constantly on the lookout for new information or skills they can acquire.\n\nAs an example, I have kept myself in the game by pursuing certifications and taking online courses. I went through the trouble to become a Certified Financial Planner, or CFP, for starters. I also buy online courses from other online entrepreneurs and online business experts so I can continue learning new skills I can use to grow my business.\n\n5. They don't let failure knock their goals off track\n\nFinally, six-figure earners know the simple truth that failure is only temporary. Many high earners may try several business ideas or jobs and fail at them all, for example, but they'll always brush their shoulders off and keep on going.\n\nMy own life provides the perfect example. In my career as an entrepreneur, I have failed way more than I have succeeded. I even lost $8,000 on a failed business venture early in my career, and I'll never forget the time I lost over $5,000 on a penny stock investment gone wrong.\n\nBut did I give up? Absolutely not. Instead of letting failure ruin my business plans, I picked myself up and looked for something I could learn each time. And, believe it or not, but there is always something you can learn when you fail at achieving a goal.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nIf you want to become a six-figure earner one day, the most important thing you can do is never settle. Don't settle on a job with limited income potential, and don't settle on an average life that doesn't require you to push yourself to achieve your dreams.\n\nAnyone can earn six figures with the right mindset and skills, but the will to succeed has to come from within.", "description": "Financial advisers see a lot of trends among their clients, including six-figure earners.
