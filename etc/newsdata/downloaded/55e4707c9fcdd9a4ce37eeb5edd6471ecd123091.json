The inner pragmatist in him would have none of it.\n\nSo Rudolph spent the first six quarters of the 2019 season standing on the Pittsburgh Steelers sideline with his helmet on while watching Ben Roethlisberger go to work. And Rudolph didn\u2019t just have it sitting atop his head either. Most of the time he would tug it all the way down.\n\nHe\u2019s aware it looked a little weird. Well, weird for everyone else. Just not for the self-professed football \u201cnerd\u201d who prefers functionality over fashion.\n\nRudolph\u2019s fear of misplacing his lid or wasting valuable seconds sprinting to the bench in a mad dash to find it far outweighed the comfort of a baseball cap.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s fitting for a player committed to the art of being over-prepared, one who suddenly finds himself in the position of helping the Steelers emerge from an early 0-2 hole .\n\nThe 24-year-old will make his first NFL start Sunday when Pittsburgh visits unbeaten San Francisco (2-0), thrust into the starting job for the rest of the season - and maybe longer - with Roethlisberger sidelined by a right elbow injury that requires surgery. It\u2019s a position Rudolph always believed he\u2019d be in, if not in Pittsburgh then elsewhere.\n\n\u201cThat was always the plan,\u201d Rudolph said. \u201cAnd obviously would I have liked to have it happen sooner? Yeah. But God\u2019s got a plan and I\u2019m just trying to, like I said, take it day by day.\u201d\n\nEven if some days have felt longer than others since the Steelers selected him in the third round of the 2018 draft .\n\nPittsburgh made the unusual move of trading up to acquire Rudolph, leading to speculation that the team pegged Rudolph as Roethlisberger\u2019s eventual heir. At least that was the theory. Reality proved differently.\n\nRudolph couldn\u2019t beat out Josh Dobbs for the backup job last season, forcing Rudolph to spend most of his rookie year watching football instead of playing it for the first time in his life.\n\nThe Steelers then gave Roethlisberger a contract extension in the spring that runs through 2021, which also happens to be the end of Rudolph\u2019s deal. Rudolph made it a point to not get caught up in his future prospects and instead focused on improving from one practice to the next. That doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t easy to be a spectator on game days after being made inactive.\n\n\u201cIn the moment you are still kind of, you know, you want to play, you\u2019re (ticked),\u201d Rudolph said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s all short term. I tried to have a long-term mentality and understand that hopefully I will be playing this game a long time and as long as I\u2019m ready for my opportunity, that\u2019s kind of all that matters.\u201d\n\nThat opportunity came last Sunday, when Roethlisberger\u2019s 37-year-old right elbow forced him out of the second half against Seattle.\n\nEnter Rudolph, who set records at Oklahoma State yet slipped to the 76th overall pick in 2018 for reasons that were never made clear to Rudolph. Not that he particularly cares. He\u2019s here. He\u2019s playing. And if he gets a chance to make a point to the teams that passed on him, so be it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always had a chip,\u201d Rudolph said. \u201cThat\u2019s how I was raised. I love football and yeah, I\u2019m passionate about it. I\u2019m going to celebrate. I\u2019m going to have fun. Going to try and be a catalyst for this offense, for this team and that\u2019s who I\u2019ve always been. I\u2019m not going to change for that.\u201d\n\nAnd the Steelers insist their offense won\u2019t change much after going from a quarterback with 218 games under his belt - the second-highest total in the franchise\u2019s 87-year history - to one with two quarter\u2019s worth.\n\nRudolph didn\u2019t look out of place in the second half against Seattle on Sunday, completing 12 of 19 passes for 112 yards and two touchdowns. He hit JuJu Smith-Schuster with a deep ball. He patiently waited for tight end Vance McDonald to get open on a delayed screen that McDonald turned into an 8-yard score. He practically fired the ball through Diontae Johnson\u2019s extended hand on a stop route.\n\nThose were the kind of throws Rudolph made with regularity at Oklahoma State. Yet it wasn\u2019t just his arm strength that won over Pittsburgh\u2019s coaching staff.\n\n\u201cYou saw the ability to lead an organization,\u201d offensive coordinator Randy Fichtner said. \u201cOklahoma State won a lot of football games with Mason Rudolph. You better have winning in your background as well. That\u2019s valuable.\u201d\n\nThe Cowboys went 30-9 during Rudolph\u2019s three seasons as the full-time starter. Two of those came against Pittsburgh, including a 59-21 victory at Heinz Field in 2017, a game in which Rudolph threw for 497 yards and five touchdowns with Steelers general manager Kevin Colbert watching from the press box.\n\nOh, and he did it without throwing a pass over the final 22 minutes after getting pulled in the third quarter with things well in hand.\n\n\u201cHe knows how to throw the ball,\u201d Pitt coach Pat Narduzzi said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t take pressure or get flustered with pressure. So Mason will be fine. \u2026 He\u2019s special.\u201d\n\nThe Steelers stressed they don\u2019t need Rudolph to become Roethlisberger 2.0. Roethlisberger took over for the injured Tommy Maddox in Week 2 of 2004 and never looked back. It\u2019s far too early to heap those kinds of expectations on Rudolph. For now, there\u2019s just Sunday. That\u2019s enough.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been learning from Ben these last two years,\u201d running back Jaylen Samuels said. \u201cI believe in him and I\u2019m sure everyone else in this locker room believes in him. We\u2019ll just keep fighting. We\u2019re 0-2. We still can go 14-2.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Mason Rudolph could have gone the hat and clipboard route, the typical gear of choice for most NFL backup quarterbacks.
