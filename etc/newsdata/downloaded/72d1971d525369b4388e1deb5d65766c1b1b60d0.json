These should have been perfect conditions for the Titanic\u2019s dazzling voyage from Southampton to New York.\n\nBut its debut trip turned into terror after the ship collided with a massive iceberg that ripped a 300ft gash along the vessel\u2019s starboard side.\n\nOn board the fateful ship were 2,224 passengers and crew, among them some of the richest people in the world plus emigrants hoping to start a new life in America \u2013 each of them with their own story.\n\nMore than 100 years on, those tales of the deep are still unfolding.\n\nTitanic: Stories From The Deep airs on Yesterday channel tonight at 8pm. It reveals some of the 5,500 unique artefacts and personal belongings that were lost at sea on that fateful day as a team of researchers recovers some of the treasured objects from the wreck, 12,500ft below the surface.\n\nBut who did these objects belong to? And is there a relative alive today to tell their tale?\n\nThis incredible four-part series sees historians unearth great stories of love, survival, mystery and fate, all found through some of these precious items...\n\nTOP-CLASS TITFER\n\n\n\nThere was a high standard of dress on board the elegant Titanic.\n\nThis collapsible top hat found buried in the Titanic wreck was made primarily of silk from a high-class luxury store called Herbert Johnson, of Bond St in London.\n\nThis item was very fashionable for that era and was likely to be worn by a first-class passenger.\n\nLOVE LETTERS\n\n\n\nThese items were among those found in a suitcase belonging to an upholsterer called Howard Irwin. Inside, one of the love letters featured a woman called Pearl.\n\nNow, Stories From The Deep tells how investigators tracked down her family to reveal their astonishing link to the doomed ship.\n\nAnd Howard wasn\u2019t on the official passenger list \u2013 despite his case being found at the bottom of the ocean.\n\nKITCHEN RELIC\n\n\n\nThis hat was owned by one of the many young men who served food to the third class passengers.\n\nExperts discovered it was a baker\u2019s hat with the name HINE written on it enabling them to trace it to William Hine, originally from London. Hine would have baked daily bread and made desserts for the passengers.\n\nSOLE SURVIVOR\n\nDespite its pretty bow, researchers discovered this shoe was designed for men to wear at formal occasions.\n\nThe item was found to belong to 17-year-old Edgar Samuel Andrew. He had originally been booked to travel on the steamer The Oceanic, but when a coal strike kicked in his ticket was cancelled and switched to the fateful Titanic.\n\nA THORNY TALE?\n\nThese documents found inside a satchel, reveal the story of one couple\u2019s journey around the world \u2013 but it wasn\u2019t as it seemed.\n\nGeorge Rosenshine and Gertrude Maybelle were travelling under the name of Thorne, and weren\u2019t in fact married. Researchers reveal the story behind their apparent deception.\n\nBAG OF CLUE\n\nThis incredibly well-preserved alligator-skin bag was recovered from the wreck site, 3800m down.\n\nStories From The Deep reveals fascinating clues about the life of its owner \u2013 a British woman named Marion Meanwell, and whether she survived or perished.", "description": "Titanic: Stories From The Deep airs on Yesterday channel tonight at 8pm", "authors": ["Dave Masters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20530354.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_crocodile-bag.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
