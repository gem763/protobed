In time-honoured tradition, this moment of pleasure is soon punished by all manner of freaky happenstance, as Ronnie starts bleeding and feels compelled to draw cityscapes of places he\u2019s never been, which of course prove prophetic.\n\nBefore long, he finds himself in Kolkata, to where his mother has urgently returned and where she is now in a coma after a car accident. As Ronnie\u2019s quest entwines with a series of murders, he learns that all of the origin stories his mum told him about himself weren\u2019t true.\n\nBiswas and his crew set themselves a tricky task as they strive to underscore Ronnie\u2019s linguistically challenged, culturally confused footing in his mother\u2019s land, forced to rely on the kindness of strange relatives he\u2019s never met and police agents \u2013 including an attractive forensic photographer (Sayani Gupta) \u2013 he doesn\u2019t know if he can trust. He looks on as squeamish as any prissy, naive westerner at the poverty around him as little kids swarm him for money in the slums, and the whole town feels like a huge twisting alleyway in some kind of perpetual night.\n\nIt\u2019s refreshing to see a film set in India that favours such a dark palette of colours instead of the usual supersaturated pops of \u201cspiritual\u201d orange and poverty-porn pink. Even the obligatory jump scares are finessed in such a way as to make the film feel a little different.\n\n\u2022 Darkness Visible is released in the UK on 18 October.", "description": "A son hunts for his mother after her unexplained return to her home town in this intriguingly inventive horror story", "authors": ["Leslie Felperin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07a4c5b08a3cecdfcfe2a3ab53859ebda0caa49d/414_603_5311_3188/master/5311.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=b4ed09f09c575a37ee0a3016ba52b8dc", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
