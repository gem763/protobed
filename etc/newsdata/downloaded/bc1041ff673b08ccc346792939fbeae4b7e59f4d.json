Kelly was arrested last month on a 13-count federal indictment alleging racketeering, forced labor and, most notably, sexually exploiting children.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nNow, two of his self-proclaimed girlfriends \u2014 Azriel Clary and Joycelyn Savage \u2014 are trying to raise money to get him a good legal team.\n\nAccording to TMZ, the two women are working together to build a defense fund big enough to hire Tom Mesereau, the same attorney who got Michael Jackson acquitted in his child molestation trial in 2005.\n\nOne of the money-raising projects is a book deal in the works, and another is acquiring more media exposure.

We see the support that you guys are showing him all over social media \u2014 Twitter, Instagram, everything.
