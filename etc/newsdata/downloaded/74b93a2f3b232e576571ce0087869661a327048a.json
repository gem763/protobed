He attended Stephen Strasburg\u2019s 14-strikeout debut in 2010 and saw Jayson Werth\u2019s walk-off home run in Game 4 of the NL Division Series two years later, and he believes last week\u2019s \u201cBaby Shark\u201d singalong was the loudest Nationals Park has ever been.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cEverybody did it,\u201d Lundin said. \u201cIt\u2019s a special moment now.\u201d\n\nAnything more wild than a ballpark full of adults and children alike singing \"Baby Shark?\" pic.twitter.com/buK6yJQfKj \u2014 Cut4 (@Cut4) October 16, 2019\n\nThe improbable tale of how an old campfire ditty that was reinvented by the Korean children\u2019s entertainment brand Pinkfong in 2015 and grew into a cultural phenomenon last year only to become the rallying song of D.C.'s first World Series representative in 86 years begins June 19.\n\nWashington was 33-38 and 8\u00bd games out of first place in the National League East. Parra, who was signed by the Nationals in May after he was released by the San Francisco Giants, was mired in an 0-for-22 slump and decided to request a new walk-up song before the first game of a doubleheader at home against the Philadelphia Phillies.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think God send to me,\u201d Parra said recently of choosing \u201cBaby Shark,\u201d a nod to his 2-year-old daughter, Aaliyah, instead of another Reggaeton or hip-hop song like he has used throughout most of his 11-year major league career.\n\nAD\n\nThere couldn\u2019t have been more than 5,000 people in the stands when Parra stepped to the plate to lead off the second inning that day. Neither the Nationals\u2019 TV nor radio broadcasts mentioned the song, which preceded a routine groundout to first base.\n\n\u201cThe day he picked it, my initial response was, \u2018Seriously?' \u201d said Lundin, who, as the father of a 3-year-old, was plenty familiar with the maddeningly catchy tune. \u201cBut it just took off. From there, it just got bigger and bigger and bigger.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBaby Shark\u201d might have been a forgotten, one-day experiment had Parra not doubled in his next at-bat and homered later in the game, a 6-2 Nationals win, to break out of his slump.\n\n\u201cMy girl loves that song,\u201d Parra told reporters afterward. \u201c \u2026 She sings it a lot.\u201d\n\nParra earned a rare start at home four days later, and this time, MASN\u2019s cameras showed pockets of fans clapping along to the song every time he came to bat.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cEvidently that \u2018Baby Shark\u2019 song is sweeping the country,\u201d play-by-play man Bob Carpenter deadpanned.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind it,\u201d analyst F.P. Santangelo replied. \u201c \u2026 I had to listen to Barney with my kids forever, so this is way better.\u201d\n\nParra was in the lineup again July 4 and went 2 for 4 with a pair of doubles. After he fouled off a pitch in the fifth inning, Nationals Park organist Matthew Van Hoose played his own rendition of the song, prompting Santangelo to declare that \u201cBaby Shark\u201d was officially \u201cbecoming a thing.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe knew we had something,\u201d Lundin said.\n\nThe next day, Lundin\u2019s production team conducted a video shoot with Parra, a routine undertaking with newly acquired players, with the purpose of capturing footage to use on the scoreboard and promotional materials throughout the year. When one of Lundin\u2019s colleagues asked Parra whether he would be willing to do the \u201cBaby Shark\u201d dance during the shoot, the outfielder happily obliged.\n\nAD\n\nThe Nationals were six games over .500 and in sole possession of the first NL wild-card spot when they returned from a 10-day road trip after the all-star break to open a series against the Rockies on July 23. As \u201cBaby Shark\u201d began to play after Parra was announced as a pinch hitter in the seventh inning that night, an animated video on the center field scoreboard depicted three images of Parra in uniform, his head edited to be disproportionately larger than the rest of his body, clapping along.\n\nAD\n\nYou've gotta see Gerardo Parra's Baby Shark intro.\n\n\n\nThis is WILD. pic.twitter.com/kjmb6vaoUl \u2014 Cut4 (@Cut4) July 24, 2019\n\n\u201cThe first time he saw it was when it first played, and he definitely had a smile on his face,\u201d Lundin said of the video, which has been used for Parra\u2019s plate appearances since. \u201cThe fans were way into it even before we put that up, but it was just another thing to add to the list of fun.\u201d\n\nParra followed with a bases-clearing single, prompting a second \u201cBaby Shark\u201d singalong. The video was featured on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d the next day.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe all thought it was just going to be a game or two, or a week, but it turned into something cool,\u201d second baseman Brian Dozier said. \u201cAnything to get the fans involved.\"\n\nIt should be noted that Parra was not the first major leaguer to use \u201cBaby Shark\u201d as his walk-up song. A Venezuelan countryman, Texas Rangers shortstop Elvis Andrus, used the song on Opening Day in honor of his 1-year-old son and continued using it off and on throughout the season. The Nationals, though, took \u201cBaby Shark\u201d and made it their own.\n\nAD\n\nAround the same time Parra\u2019s animated video debuted at Nationals Park, he and his teammates began celebrating hits by making the hand motions from the \u201cBaby Shark\u201d music video. After a single, a player would turn toward the dugout and give the baby shark signal by moving his thumb and forefinger together like pincers. Doubles called for the mommy shark, which involves clapping one\u2019s hands with the wrists together. The daddy shark \u2014 flat hands and outstretched arms with a clapping motion \u2014 was reserved for triples. Nationals players in the dugout began responding by making the appropriate hand motion back.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAnything that happens in baseball is never planned,\u201d Dozier said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like, \u2018Hey, you guys want to get a single and let\u2019s do this?\u2019 It\u2019s always something happens, one person does it, and it just catches on.\"\n\n\u201cA couple of times I\u2019ve come out of a game in the eighth or the ninth inning and I\u2019ve been in the dugout and I\u2019ve been able to do it to the guy,\u201d Sean Doolittle said of the hand motions, which relievers don\u2019t normally get to experience from the bullpen. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of fun with that.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOpposing players have gotten a kick out of the Nationals\u2019 \u201cBaby Shark\u201d antics, too. When the Braves visited Nationals Park in late July, Atlanta first baseman Freddie Freeman was curious about the hand signals and asked Howie Kendrick to explain.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2018Baby Shark,\u2019 \u201d Kendrick replied with a smile, showing Freeman the hand motion again.\n\nFreeman smiled and nodded as he returned to his position, but judging by his reaction in the seventh inning when Parra came to the plate as a pinch hitter, he wasn\u2019t prepared for his first full-on \u201cBaby Shark\u201d attack. Freeman covered his mouth with his hand to hide his smile as Parra stepped into the batter\u2019s box.\n\nParra struggled at the plate for much of August and September but caught fire during the Nationals\u2019 final homestand of the regular season and made the playoff roster as a reserve. He had one at-bat at home during the NLDS, and while it came with the Nationals trailing the Los Angeles Dodgers by four runs in Game 3, his appearance led to one of the loudest moments of the night.\n\nIn Game 3 of the NLCS, Parra attached a plush blue shark to the netting in front of the Nationals\u2019 dugout. His Instagram story revealed that he had received a box of toys from WowWee, the Canadian company that produces \u201cBaby Shark\u201d toys for Pinkfong. The plush shark was back for Game 4, and in the sixth inning, it brought Parra good luck after fans, some dressed in shark costumes and wearing \u201cParra Shark\u201d T-shirts, bandannas and hats, serenaded him with the loudest \u201cBaby Shark\u201d singalong yet.\n\n\u201cOf course he was going to get a hit,\u201d analyst Ron Darling said on TBS\u2019s broadcast after Parra delivered a two-out single.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI only put him in the game today to get the fans going again,\u201d Nationals Manager Dave Martinez joked after Washington completed the sweep with a 7-4 win.\n\nOn Sunday, Parra spent part of his day at Children\u2019s National Hospital meeting with pediatric cancer patients and handing out plush baby sharks and Nationals hats.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing, the energy the fans bring to me and to my teammates,\u201d Parra said. \u201cBut I think the more important [thing] is all the kids jumping, clapping, enjoy that. It\u2019s great when I see other guys do that. \u2026 Right now, it\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s working for us.\"\n\nAs the Nationals prepare to host the city\u2019s first World Series game since 1933 on Friday, Lundin said there are no plans to alter the \u201cBaby Shark\u201d routine.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just rolling with what\u2019s working,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s what\u2019s got us here. We\u2019re not trying to change what the fans are doing or what Parra\u2019s doing or anyone else. We just want to help enhance it. It\u2019s been a great ride.\u201d\n\nSam Fortier and Elahe Izadi contributed to this report.\n\nRead more on the Nationals:", "description": "This is how we got from Gerardo Parra using the song to about 44,000 fans chomping along in unison during the NLCS.", "authors": ["Scott Allen", "Reporter Covering D.C.
