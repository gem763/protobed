But he made a story,\u201d said Borkowski, who called the documentary a \u201ccomplete and utter disaster\u201d.\n\nMeghan just wants to be treated fairly by the press \u2013 and I don\u2019t blame her | Jane Martinson Read more\n\n\u201cThe population is split. I think younger people get it and are more attune with it. But the rump of people who are monarchists still probably go out and buy the Daily Express. Those are the people he is not convincing.\u201d\n\nWith William destined to be king and Harry to slide further down the line of succession, their future paths will be different. But Harry\u2019s comments were overwhelmingly interpreted as concrete evidence of a rift, in a blizzard of headlines.\n\n\u201cYou allow the intrusive lens into your life, and you are out of control. No matter how much editorial control they had with their mate, Tom Bradby, he\u2019s caused chaos,\u201d Borkowski said.\n\nThe decision by Harry and Meghan to speak out so openly about their struggles, he said, had a hint of the A-list celebrity Hollywood PR strategy. But the rules were \u201ctotally different for celebrities and royals\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe royal family are a publicly-funded heritage business, and as anybody that has entered in to the royal family has discovered, the rules go out of the window. [Celebrities] don\u2019t have the same responsibility, don\u2019t have the love of the nation to deal with.\u201d\n\nWhile celebrities could demand \u201capproved quotes, approved pictures, playing hardball, controlling photo opportunities\u201d, he said, \u201cwith the palace there is an uneasy relationship with the media and the public\u201d.\n\nThe royal biographer Penny Junor said: \u201cMy instinct is it is best not to tell the entire world about your emotional state. I suppose in a way, it is a generational thing, and everyone will have a different view on it.\u201d\n\nThe documentary was filmed during the couple\u2019s recent 10-day tour of southern Africa, a highly successful \u201ctextbook royal\u201d tour which was then overshadowed by the legal action by Meghan against the Mail on Sunday, over allegations that it printed extracts of a private letter from her to her estranged father, Thomas Markle.\n\nHarry also issued a furious statement railing against the tabloid press, whom he accused of a \u201cruthless\u201d campaign against his wife.\n\nMeghan\u2019s almost tearful gratitude when she was asked in the documentary if she was \u201cOK\u201d and about her struggle with the intensity of tabloid interest, was seen to have parallels with Martin Bashir\u2019s Panorama interview with Diana, Princess of Wales.\n\n\u201cI had a great feeling of deja vu watching Meghan with her face beginning to crumple,\u201d said Junor. She said the film raised concerns over the mental well being of the couple. \u201cI don\u2019t doubt they are finding it very difficult. Fundamentally, all these negative stories, I guess, have taken their toll.\u201d\n\nThe couple have announced they will take six weeks off from royal duties, during which they are expected to travel to the US.\n\nBut the documentary had served only to give everybody more headlines \u2013 and of the wrong sort, Junor believed.\n\n\u201cIt just feeds the media machine, and that is the one thing Harry really hates. This whole documentary has exposed him. In a way it is the very reverse of what he has said he wants for him and his family, namely, privacy.\u201d", "description": "After An African Journey screens on ITV, PR experts say couple are even more exposed to tabloids", "authors": ["Caroline Davies", "Patrick Jephson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d40c8ceb185a6040fdba9e605a712cab7d82628/0_394_2942_1765/master/2942.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=454991d39960e3b79062dca4254ea85c", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
