Both \u201cmiss \u2018ole\u2019 \u2018bamy once again.\u201d\n\nBefore this week, those were the most famous Alabama misses. Then along came President Trump, who made a now-famous call on Hurricane Dorian\u2019s potential storm path, wherein he warned the major storm could hit Alabama, and then used what suspiciously looked like a Sharpie-enhanced series of maps to buttress his point.\n\nMore from Deadline\n\nToday, the debate on storm paths, Sharpies and reality continued as a Category 5, with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) defending President Trump by taking on the Birmingham National Weather Service\u2019s prior claims on the storm.\n\nA NOAA spokesperson issued a statement Friday that Trump\u2019s storm path claims were an accurate reflection of its analysis on Hurricane Dorian\u2019s potential path. The National Weather Service in Birmingham, Alabama previously said that the state would not see any impact from the storm.\n\nNOAA said today that the National Weather Service \u201cspoke in absolute terms that were inconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available at the time.\u201d\n\nTrump was also defended today by Fox Business Network pundit Lou Dobbs, who echoed Sean Hannity\u2019s remarks from Thursday that Trump was right in his storm watch.\n\n\u201cThe national left-wing media went apoplectic over the past few days,\u201d Dobbs said. He put up a clip from CNN on Twitter that noted the cable network itself had said that the storm potentially could have hit Alabama, and noted how other media had jumped up and down to complain about Trump\u2019s accuracy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not exactly a mere loss of the sense of proportion on the part of the left wing fake news media,\u201d Dobbs said. \u201cThis is madness, what we have witnessed over the last few days.\u201d\n\nDobbs mentioned today\u2019s NOAA statement and concluded, \u201cyou mess with a bull, you get the horn.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2026.This nonsense has never happened to another President. Four days of corrupt reporting, still without an apology. But there are many things that the Fake News Media has not apologized to me for, like the Witch Hunt, or SpyGate!
