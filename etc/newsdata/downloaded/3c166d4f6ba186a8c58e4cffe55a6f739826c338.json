Analysts said more information was needed to assess whether these findings could have an impact on Zolgensma's long-term prospects.\n\n\"We need to better understand, what the issues are and whether there really is a read-through to the human trial,\" Vontobel analyst Stefan Schneider said.\n\nNovartis said it was working with regulators, in hopes of having the hold released.\n\nZolgensma, whose $2.1 million list price makes it the world's most-expensive treatment, is already approved for children aged up to two with the deadly muscle wasting disease and is given by infusion into the young patients' veins.\n\nThe medicine had $160 million in sales in its first full quarter on the market.\n\nThe STRONG study is meant to underpin its expanded approval for older children, where Novartis would also compete with Biogen's Spinraza that is already on the market, and Roche's investigational risdiplam that is due to seek approval this year.\n\nRoche shares were up 0.7%.\n\n\"The clinical significance of the DRG inflammation observed in this pre-clinical animal study is not known and was not seen in prior animal studies,\" Novartis said in a statement.\n\n\"We are working with health authorities to confirm further guidance to clinical investigators.\"\n\nThe partial FDA hold halts enrollment of patients getting a higher dose of Zolgensma, also known as AVXS-101, via an spinal infusion, also called intrathecal administration.\n\nLow- and mid-dose portions of the STRONG trial have already been completed, as has presentation of interim results.\n\n\"Of note, we have completed a thorough review of human safety data from all available sources to date and no adverse effects related to sensory changes have been seen,\" Novartis said.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Editing by Deepa Babington)", "description": "U.S. regulators have halted a trial of Novartis's Zolgensma treatment after an animal study raised safety concerns, the company said on Wednesday, in a setback for the drugmaker's plan to expand its use to older patients.
