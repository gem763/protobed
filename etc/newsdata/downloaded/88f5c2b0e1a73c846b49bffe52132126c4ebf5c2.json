Someone in China\u2019s leadership must have read that book, for Beijing has made winning the race to artificial intelligence a national obsession, devoting billions of dollars to the cause and setting 2030 as the target year for world dominance. Not to be outdone, President Vladimir Putin of Russia recently declared that whoever masters A.I. \u201cwill become the ruler of the world.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, the bold promises made by A.I.\u2019s true believers can seem excessive; today\u2019s A.I. technologies are useful only in narrow situations. But if there is even a slim chance that the race to build stronger A.I. will determine the future of the world \u2014 and that does appear to be at least a possibility \u2014 the United States and the rest of the West are taking a surprisingly lackadaisical and alarmingly risky approach to the technology.\n\nThe plan seems to be for the American tech industry, which makes most of its money in advertising and selling personal gadgets, to serve as champions of the West. Those businesses, it is hoped, will research, develop and disseminate the most important basic technologies of the future. Companies like Google, Apple and Microsoft are formidable entities, with great talent and resources that approximate those of small countries. But they don\u2019t have the resources of large countries, nor do they have incentives that fully align with the public interest.\n\nTo exaggerate slightly: If this were 1957, we might as well be hoping that the commercial airlines would take us to the moon.", "description": "We need to stop pretending that Silicon Valley can compete with China on its own.", "authors": ["Tim Wu"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/07/opinion/07Wu/07Wu-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
