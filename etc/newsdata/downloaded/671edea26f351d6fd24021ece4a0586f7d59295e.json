The Journal didn't specify which model of Huawei camera allegedly infringed Oliveira's design.\n\n\"Unlike Mr. Oliveira's single-lens and expandable design, Huawei's camera was non-expandable, featured lenses on both sides designed for panoramic pictures,\" Huawei says.\n\nHuawei's comparison of the two cameras. Huawei\n\n\"It's clear that Mr. Oliveira is taking advantage of the current geopolitical situation,\" Huawei wrote.\n\nThe company is currently locked in a firefight with the US government, which blacklisted Huawei in May on national security grounds, as it claims the company acts as a proxy for Chinese government to spy. Huawei denies this.\n\nHuawei claims that Oliveira sent threatening emails from April 2018 to March 2019 claiming he would go to the media or go through \"political channels\" if Huawei didn't pay out. It claims that he tried to exert pressure through \"senior government officials,\" although it doesn't name names.\n\nHuawei accused the US of trying to recruit its employees as internal spies\n\nIn its statement, Huawei went on to portray Oliveira's allegations against the company as a mutually beneficial scheme for himself and the US government, claiming the US has been using \"both judicial and administrative powers\" to disrupt Huawei's business.\n\nIt then presented a long list of tactics the US has allegedly deployed, including:\n\nSearching, detaining, and arresting Huawei staffers and partners.\n\nLaunching cyber attacks to infiltrate Huawei's intranet and internal information systems.\n\nSending FBI agents to the homes of Huawei employees to try and recruit them to hand over information.\n\nReexamining \"old civil cases that have already been settled\", and \"selectively\" filing criminal charges of technology theft.\n\nHuawei didn't provide any specific examples for any of the allegations. The FBI declined to comment when contacted by Business Insider.\n\nHuawei is already facing intellectual theft charges in the US. In January the Justice Department indicted Huawei for allegedly trying to steal a device-testing robot called \"Tappy\" from T-Mobile.", "description": "The Wall Street Journal reported US prosecutors are following new lines of enquiry into Huawei over alleged intellectual property thefts.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d6e4b8d2e22af02bc5ecae9-2732-1366.jpg"}
