Robart & Co, a Hong Kong-based bullion house that helps high net worth individuals buy, store and transport precious metals.\n\n\"We know at least hundreds of millions worth of gold has left Hong Kong, mostly to Singapore, but some to Switzerland,\" Rotbart added.\n\nIn July, the second month of major protests in Hong Kong, and two months after Beijing imposed import restrictions, China's imports of gold from Hong Kong dropped to 8.085 tonnes. That was their lowest level in at least eight years, according to official Hong Kong records.\n\nHong Kong has traditionally been one of the world's most active physical gold markets, with long-established trade routes through its historic jewelry district making it the Asian hub for bullion banks and dealers.\n\nBut the latest political unrest, fueled by anger over planned legislation to allow extraditions to China, is weakening already faltering trade winds. Hong Kong's share of China's gold imports has dropped to just under 40% currently, from around 70% in 2014, according to consultants GFMS Refinitiv and official Hong Kong data.\n\nGFMS Refinitiv data also shows Hong Kong bullion flows to mainland China plummeted 45% in the first half of this year to 175.7 tonnes, compared with 321.1 tonnes a year ago.", "description": "Long-running and sometimes violent street protests in Hong Kong are helping tarnish its luster as the main physical gateway of gold to China, the world's top bullion buyer.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105705377-1548741627118gettyimages-1041506476.jpeg?v=1564636727", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
