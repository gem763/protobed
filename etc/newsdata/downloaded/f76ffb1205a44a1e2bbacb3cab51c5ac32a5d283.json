We're like Jack and Rose from Titanic.\n\n\"I suppose we should have some tea after that.\"\n\nFans were concerned for Gaga's wellbeing as she lives with fibromyalgia, a rheumatic condition like arthritis that can impair the joints, and cause chronic pain.\n\nIn 2013, she had to cancel her Born This Way tour after fracturing her hip.\n\nBut the singer shrugged off Thursday night's fall, calming the audience as security guards helped her to her feet.\n\n\"Everything's OK,\" she said. \"The only thing that's not OK is we need some stairs for the damn stage so I can get back up.\"\n\nThe star also consoled Jack, who was in tears after the accident.\n\n\"Don't worry, everything's fine. It's not your fault,\" she said, adding: \"Could you promise me something? Could you forgive yourself right now for what just happened?\"\n\n\"She brought him up on stage and asked everyone on the internet to be nice to him,\" observed Reddit user UltimaterializerX.\n\n\"Poor guy was crying most of the time until she cheered him up.\"\n\nLater in the show, Gaga proved the fall had caused no permanent damage by performing an intricate, athletic routine to her signature song, Bad Romance.\n\nSkip Twitter post by @LGMonsterFacts Lady Gaga fell off the stage and then proceeded to kill the Bad Romance choreography like nothing ever happened.
