Sadly demonstrative of the huge problem the party has.\u2019\n\nThe tweet by youth representative on the National Executive Committee Lara McNeill who accused Dame Louise of whipping up 'panic' with the phrase 'what a Corbyn government might mean for Britain's Jews'\n\nIn her letter, she said Mr Corbyn had 'presided over a culture of hatred, fear and intolerance in the Labour Party'\n\nWho is Dame Louise Ellman? MP who dramatically quit Labour Party after 55 years The 73-year-old MP, who serves Liverpool Riverside, was born in Manchester to a Jewish family before going on to study at university in Hull and in York. She was elected to serve on Lancashire County Council in 1970 before becoming the Labour group leader in 1977. At the 1997 general election, she was elected to Parliament to serve the Liverpool Riverside constituency. Since 2008, she has been Chair of the Transport Select Committee. She is the Chair of the All-Party Britain-Israel Parliamentary Group and of Labour Friends of Israel and is Honorary President of the Jewish Labour Movement. Ms Ellman became a dame in 2018 for parliamentary and political services. She also serves as Vice President of the Jewish Leadership Council. On October 16, 2019 she resigned from the Labour party citing concerns over anti-semitism and claiming that Jeremy Corbyn was not fit to lead.\n\nShe outlined her views for leaving in a letter posted on Twitter on Tuesday, in which she slammed the Labour party for 'anti-Jewish racism' and said Mr Corbyn had 'presided over a culture of hatred, fear and intolerance.'\n\nHer comments, in which she also said Labour was 'no longer a safe place for Jews', plunges the party even further into an antisemitism crisis, following criticism of Mr Corybn and his handling of the scandal.\n\nShe added in her letter: 'I believe that Jeremy Corbyn is not fit to serve as our Prime Mimster. With a looming general election and the possibility of him becoming Prime Minister, I feel I have to take a stand. I cannot advocate a government led by Jeremy Corbyn.\n\n'Under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership, antisemitism has become mainstream in the Labour Party. Jewish members have been bullied, abused and driven out.\n\n'Antisemites have felt comfortable and vile conspiracy theories have been propagated. A party that permits anti-Jewish racism to flourish cannot be called anti-racist.\n\n'This is not compatible with the Labour Party's values of equality, tolerance and respect for minorities.\n\n'Shamefully, its anti-Jewish racism is now being investigated by one of the last labour government's proudest creations, the Equality and Human Rights Commission.'\n\nTwitter users responding to the tweet by Lara McNeill, youth representative on the National Executive Committee\n\nAnd with 55 years under her belt in the Labour Party, Ms Ellman has seen a great deal of change within the party - including within its leadership and ranks.\n\nBut some of the change she has seen has not been for the better, she claimed.\n\n'My values - traditional Labour values - have remained the same,' she said. 'It is Labour, under Jeremy Corbyn, that has changed. He has presided over a culture of hatred, fear and intolerance in the Labour Party.\n\nLouise Ellman speaks at the Jewish Labour Movement Rally at Middle Street Synagogue, Brighton during the Labour Party Conference in September\n\nA Labour Party spokesperson said: 'Jeremy Corbyn thanks Louise Ellman for her service to the Labour Party over many years.\n\n'Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party are fully committed to the support, defence and celebration of the Jewish community and continue to take robust action to root out anti-Semitism in the party and wider society.\n\n'Jeremy Corbyn has consistently supported struggles for human rights and justice around the world and made the right calls in the interests of security and peace.'\n\nMr Corbyn is pictured right at the PinkNews awards last week. A Labour Party spokesperson said: 'Jeremy Corbyn thanks Louise Ellman for her service to the Labour Party over many years\n\nIn May, Labour faced one of the most shameful days in its history after a formal inquiry was launched into whether it has victimised Jews.\n\nIn a potentially explosive intervention, the equalities watchdog said it 'suspects' the party has committed 'unlawful acts' in its handling of the anti-Semitism crisis.\n\nOnly once before has the Equality and Human Rights Commission launched a formal inquiry into a political party \u2013 and that was the far-Right BNP.\n\nThe EHRC will investigate whether Mr Corbyn's party has 'unlawfully discriminated against, harassed or victimised people because they are Jewish' \u2013 and whether senior staff responded properly to anti-Semitism allegations against its members.\n\nIf Labour fails to accept its findings, it could be taken to court and be fined.\n\nLabour rejected claims it was institutionally racist.", "description": "Dame Louise Ellman, 73, quit the party on Wednesday night, saying that Jeremy Corbyn was 'not fit' to be prime minister.
