Let\u2019s put it this way: If lavender shadow makes me feel like an ethereal space alien, matte baby blue makes me feel like a modern Andy Warhol muse rising, with a Marc Jacobs S/S 2019 runway model moon. And I\u2019m far from alone in this affinity: Lucy Boynton, Mandy Moore, Gigi Hadid, and Willow Smith are outspoken fans of the look.\n\nHere\u2019s the catch though: It\u2019s really hard to find a good baby-blue eyes shadow. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve purchased a sky-blue shadow that looked beautiful in the pan, only to find that it barely showed up on my lids \u2014 even when I used the best eye-shadow primers in the game (Urban Decay\u2019s and Fenty Beauty\u2019s, my trustiest go-tos, couldn\u2019t even get the job done). Every time I wear my MAKE beauty shadow in Celeste, or ColourPop\u2019s Moonlite, I spend a good 30 minutes on the application \u2014 packing on layer upon layer before it even begins to show up. After complaining about this particular issue to a bevy of industry insiders, including my friend and product developer Alexis Page, I found out that this isn\u2019t just a Me problem \u2014 pale, sheer blue is apparently a particularly tricky color to formulate into an opaque shadow.\n\nBut apparently (and please don\u2019t ask me how), one company managed to figure it out. That company\u2019s name is Kosas, and I decided to buy their baby-blue eye shadow \u201cWaterfall\u201d a couple of weeks ago after trying, and really liking, their cream blush and bronzer palettes. Still, my expectations were low \u2014 science, as I\u2019d recently found out, was not on my side. But the first time I tried it, I knew this was something different. The shadow is a liquid-to-powder formula, meaning, as the name suggests, that it\u2019s super-wet when you apply it. One single swoop gives a totally full-coverage, superbright, bold baby-blue wash of color. From afar or at night, this shade might appear matte, but if you look up close, you\u2019ll note it has a slight satin sheen to it. That sheen, I believe, is what gives the blue more dimension and makes it appear bolder and brighter than any other baby-blue shadow I\u2019ve used before. It saturates the eye.\n\nSince it went on so well, I assumed it would be a giant pain to take off. Happily, I was wrong: One swipe with a cotton pad soaked in Glossier\u2019s Milky Oil and it was off my eyelids, with no stain or residue. (I should note here that it\u2019s super-important that you shake the tube well before you apply it. Since it\u2019s a liquid formula, the pigment can separate a bit between use.)\n\nKosas 10 Second Liquid Eyeshadow in Waterfall $28 at Sephora Buy\n\nI loved the eye shadow so much that I decided to check out a few more Kosas products, and found a couple more hidden gems: The Tinted Faces Oil foundation is like a slightly more full coverage Glossier Skin Tint, and gave my skin the most beautiful, dewy, hydrated-looking finish.\n\nI also quickly fell in love with their mauve-y matte lipstick in \u201cRosewater\u201d (it\u2019s sort of like a deeper-toned Pillow Talk from Charllote Tilbury) \u2014 it has quickly become one of my everyday staples for both daytime and evening.\n\nKosas Weightless Lip Colour in Rosewater $28 at Sephora Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
