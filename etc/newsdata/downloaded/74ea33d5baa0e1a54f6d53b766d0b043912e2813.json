(5681.KU) and chemical processing firm Petronas Chemicals Group Bhd. (5183.KU) climbed 2.8% and 3.2%, respectively in early trade, outperforming the benchmark stock index which was up 0.3%.\n\nThe companies, units of national oil company Petroliam Nasional Bhd. (PET.YY), or Petronas, were among the top 10 gainers on the local bourse.\n\nMarkets in Malaysia were closed Monday for a holiday.\n\nMalaysian Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng told local media Tuesday that Petronas's revenue would increase after the latest surge in crude oil prices.\n\nHong Leong Investment Bank said in a research note that higher oil prices could be a double-edged sword, anticipating negative sentiment in the broader market, but a rise in select petroleum-company shares in the near term.\n\nWrite to Yantoultra Ngui at yantoultra.ngui@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 16, 2019 22:27 ET (02:27 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
