Regardless of whether you\u2019re looking at the past one year, five years, or ten years, XOM stock has been stuck in the mud. You\u2019d have to go back to before the Great Financial Crisis since XOM stock made investors significant money.\n\nExxon Stock Is Very Strongly Positioned for the Long-Term Investor More\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAs is often the case, however, the longer a stock trades sideways, the bigger its next move will be. XOM stock has now traded largely flat for a decade, swinging up and down but generally remaining near the $75/share mark. When it finally gets going again, expect a huge move.\n\nTechnically, Exxon stock is primed to explode upward once it starts accelerating. Here\u2019s why Exxon\u2019s next move will be upward, and probably dramatically so.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nExxon Mobil\u2019s Huge Growth Plans\n\nInvestors tend to think of the oil and gas companies being hunkered down for a long winter, and that\u2019s generally right. As the oil slump has entered year five, many smaller firms are drastically cutting down exploration and drilling expenses. In a world of $55/barrel oil, it doesn\u2019t make sense for small operators to try to increase production.\n\nThis leaves a big opportunity for companies with more scale and cheaper access to capital like Exxon Mobil. The company can, and is, making efforts to greatly improve its production in coming years. Management realizes that the world is going to need more oil. Once the current shale boom loses steam in the U.S., we\u2019ll need another round of fresh supply to replace declining reserves elsewhere.\n\nEnter Exxon, with its multi-billion dollar projects to open new production fields in places like Guyana. In fact, Exxon is getting aggressive. They are aiming to double cash flow and earnings in coming years. With so many other players pulling back their spending, Exxon with its fortress balance sheet will profitably pick up the slack.\n\nOil May Be Peaking, But It Isn\u2019t Going Away Anytime Soon\n\nMany folks seem to confuse Exxon\u2019s (very) long-term prospects with its ability to carry on in coming years. Some analysts project that if current trends hold, by around 2050, we may see renewable energy displace fossil fuels in making up a large portion of the electric grid. And the crossover point for electric vehicles could be relatively sooner \u2014 say in the 2030s. Exxon is well aware of this, and management has invested heavily in research for next-generation energy solutions.\n\nThe fact that renewables will be growing in future decades hardly matters to XOM stock tomorrow, or even ten years from now. By 2040, the 2019 Energy Outlook estimates (see slides 11 and 13) that wind, nuclear, solar, and other renewables will still be less than one-fifth of the world\u2019s global energy supply. Even dirty coal will remain a key though shrinking player, while oil demand will be about flat, and natural gas use will continue to rise.\n\n\n\n\n\nXOM Stock Dividend Is Rock-Solid\n\nXOM stock is currently offering a more than 5% dividend yield. This is the highest dividend that the company has provided in three decades. Even in the Great Financial Crisis, XOM stock paid far less. Also, in the late 1990s, when oil was just $15/barrel, XOM stock only paid a 2-2.5% dividend. Now it pays double that.\n\nThe higher dividend yield is the result of investor apathy, along with many socially-responsible funds dumping their allocations to fossil fuels altogether. Oil and gas appear to be becoming like tobacco stocks in the 1990s, shunned by investors who felt the companies were \u201cobsolete\u201d and harmful morally. Regardless of those concerns, cigarette companies like Altria (NYSE:MO) went on to post world-beating returns while giving off fat dividend yields.\n\nExxon stock could perform similarly going forward. The world will need plenty of oil for at least a few more decades, and Exxon has the balance sheet to keep its dividend secure. At an AA+ credit rating, Exxon is one of the highest-rated companies out there; it could pay off its debt with just a year or two of profits if needed.", "description": "It has been a glum time for ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) shareholders.
