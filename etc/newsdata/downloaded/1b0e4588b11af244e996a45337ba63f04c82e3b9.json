So I think that you don\u2019t necessarily actively have to teach a child that you just lead by example.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Obviously I\u2019ve got a three year old, I do explain those things. My child that knows why not to drop rubbish on the floor, and knows why we put different things in different bins and all that at age three.\u2019\n\nThe Only Love Can Hurt Like This star shares her three-year-old child with partner Leyman Lahcine, and has decided not to reveal the child\u2019s gender or name in public so they are able to live a normal life, rather than that of the child of a celebrity.\n\nPaloma, who performed and was being honoured with the Empowerment Award on the night, is happy that people are now more outspoken about the issues in the world in order to effect change.\n\nPaloma hung out with Melanie Griffith and Eva Longoria on the red carpet (Picture: Rex Features)\n\nShe explained: \u2018It\u2019s great to be part of a room full of very empowered, successful women who are doing their bit to contribute to a better world. God knows we need it right now.\n\n\u2018I think the Zeitgeist at the moment is about being outspoken and being empowered about your views.\n\nShe also made her mark on a mural along with the other celeb attendees (Picture: GoffPhotos)\n\n\u2018And I think that in the name of progress, no progress is going to be made unless we stand side by side and say we\u2019re all human beings, what is the best thing to do for the greater good of the people and not the few?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Because actually, we are in a climate emergency and we\u2019re in, you know, various other crises, humanitarian crises in the world. And actually, the issue really is that there\u2019s a lack of conversation.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not just about standing on your soapbox and saying, \u201cHey, this is what I think. And I\u2019m empowered because I\u2019m going to shout my opinions at you\u201d.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s about actually saying \u201cI need to understand why you oppose my view\u201d. And to me, that\u2019s true empowerment, not just somebody who\u2019s swelling your ears with their opinion.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
