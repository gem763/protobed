Giuliani made, and they are precisely the countries whose judicial systems are least trustworthy. No U.S. president could ever ask Britain or France or Japan or any other deeply rooted democracy with an impartial justice system to investigate an American whom those governments had not already decided on their own to investigate. Much less would such governments be willing to investigate a U.S. president\u2019s political opponents at the president\u2019s behest. The only kinds of countries that would conceivably succumb to such pressure \u2014 and it is to this Ukrainian president\u2019s great credit that he did not \u2014 are precisely those whose judicial systems were already corrupt and easily manipulated for political purposes. Again, how reliable could such an investigation be? Why would we not expect it to produce whatever answer was most conducive to that government\u2019s interests? The U.S. president wants an investigation to prove that his opponent is dirty. Okay. Done. He\u2019s dirty. Now release the aid.\n\nBut that is just part of the problem. Consider what it will mean if we decide that what Trump and Giuliani have already acknowledged doing in Ukraine becomes an acceptable practice for all future presidents. Sending the signal that other governments can curry favor with a U.S. president by helping to dig up dirt on his or her political opponents would open our political system and foreign policy to intervention and manipulation on a global scale. Every government in the world wishing to influence U.S. foreign policy will have an incentive to come to a sitting president with information on his or her potential political opponents.", "description": "", "authors": ["Robert Kagan", "Washingtonpost.Com Opinions If-We-Legitimize-Trumps-Behavior-Itll-Be-Open-Season-On-Our-Politics"], "top_image": ""}
