Roscosmos may soon offer nuclear-powered base on the Moon for rent", "language": "en", "text": "The Russian space agency is reportedly mulls building a sophisticated, nuclear-powered base on the Moon available to anyone who got some extra cash to spend. The multimillion project is set to be unveiled in nine years.\n\nDubbed Patron Moon, the 70-ton facility will house up to 50 people fearless \u2013 and wealthy \u2013 enough to live on the Earth\u2019s satellite, according to files of a Roscosmos subsidiary seen by RIA Novosti. The lunar base, split into three retractable living modules, will get electricity from a small nuclear power plant.\n\nThe $462-million project seems too futuristic at a glance, but the company claims it knows in detail how to make it come true. At the first stage, Roscosmos will ship all elements of the base to the Moon aboard a super-heavy rocket \u2018Yenisei\u2019, named after the great Siberian river.\n\nOnce the Patron Moon reaches the surface, it will dig into the ground. The living modules, a universal docking port and \u201cmulti-function drills\u201d will be put together and connected to the power plant.\n\nAlso on rt.com Russia\u2019s future Moon base will use \u2018local resources\u2019 & 3D-printing \u2013 Roscosmos\n\nTo cover research and development costs, Roscosmos will offer the base for rent, but the bad news is its price \u2013 each space will cost from $10 to $30 million. The good news is that the Patron Moon will only be rolled out until after 2028, giving potential Moon travelers the whole lot of years to make that money.\n\nRussia, along with other world powers, has an ambitious Moon exploration program. Its current lunar plan is to build a new heavy-lift launch vehicle over the next decade and use it to create a permanent base on the surface. Previously, Roscosmos officials shed some light on the future base, telling the press that it will benefit from \u201clocal resources\u201d and make use of \u201cavatar robots.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com Pandora, anyone?
