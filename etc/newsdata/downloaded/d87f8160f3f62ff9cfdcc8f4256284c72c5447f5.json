He wasn\u2019t kidding.\n\nTrump soon stated that \u201cI have the absolute right\u201d to fire FBI Director James Comey. He subsequently proclaimed the \u201cabsolute right\u201d to provide Russia with an ally\u2019s highly classified intelligence; the \u201cabsolute right\u201d to pardon himself; the \u201cabsolute right\u201d to shut down the southern border; the \u201cabsolute right\u201d to fire special counsel Robert Mueller; the \u201cabsolute right\u201d to sign an executive order removing the Constitution\u2019s birthright-citizenship provision; the \u201cabsolute right\u201d to contrive a national emergency to deny Congress the power of the purse; the \u201cabsolute right\u201d to order U.S. businesses out of China; the \u201cabsolute right\u201d to release apparent spy-satellite imagery of Iran; and, most recently, the \u201cabsolute right\u201d to ask other countries to furnish evidence that Joe Biden is corrupt.\n\nRelated: Donald Trump - life in pictures (Photos)\n\nKellyanne Conway asserted Trump\u2019s \u201cabsolute right\u201d to give his son-in-law a security clearance over security professionals\u2019 objections. White House counsel Pat Cipollone said current and former White House officials are \u201cabsolutely immune\u201d from testifying before Congress. As others have noted, Trump has repeatedly said the Constitution\u2019s Article II empowers him \u201cto do whatever I want\u201d and bestows on him \u201call of these rights at a level nobody has ever seen before.\u201d\n\nAt a level nobody has ever seen. Now we see the corrupting effect of this claim of one\u2019s own absolute power:\n\nWithout troubling himself to engage in the usual consultations with lawmakers, allies and military leaders, he ordered a pullout of U.S. troops from northern Syria, setting off a Turkish invasion as well as fears of a massacre of our Kurdish allies and religious minorities (including some 50,000 Christians) and of a revival of the Islamic State. He did it at the request of the repressive leader of Turkey, where Trump has boasted of his extensive business interests.\n\nTrump declared \u201cperfect\u201d his phone call with the Ukrainian president, at a time when Trump was withholding military aid to that country, requesting a \u201cfavor\u201d and asking for damaging information about Biden \u2014 a stark violation of campaign-finance law. He then publicly asked China for the same on the eve of trade talks.\n\nHe responded to the resulting impeachment inquiry in the House with a bizarre letter from Cipollone asserting, essentially, that Trump is exempt from all congressional oversight and won\u2019t participate in this \u201cunconstitutional inquiry\u201d \u2014 even though the Constitution expressly gives the House \u201cthe sole Power of Impeachment.\u201d\n\nRelated: Donald Trump's most outrageous quotes (Photos)\n\nBelatedly, the Syrian situation led some of Trump\u2019s biggest champions to recognize something has gone awry. \u201cThe president of the United States is in danger of losing the mandate of heaven if he permits this to happen,\u201d Pat Robertson warned on his Christian Broadcasting Network.\n\nEvangelical Christians have been among Trump\u2019s most loyal supporters. They have stood with him through the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape and the Stormy Daniels payoff, through public vulgarity and blasphemy, through cruelty to migrant children and abuses of power for personal gain. In exchange, they can point to policies and judges restricting abortion and gay rights and expanding religious freedom.\n\nSuch logic is behind the declaration of religious-right activist Ralph Reed, in a forthcoming book, that evangelical Christians \u201chave a moral obligation to enthusiastically back\u201d Trump in 2020. Reed dispenses this moral advice after a lobbying stint in which he worked with disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff and, after telling Abramoff \u201cI need to start humping in corporate accounts,\u201d reportedly received more than $4 million from Indian tribes in a fight among rival casino operations.\n\nMaybe the Kurdish tragedy will finally make more principled evangelicals rethink their Faustian bargain. Maybe they, and other Trump backers, will begin to see that absolute power, though tempting when wielded for things they like, becomes alarming when used against their wishes.\n\nMaybe they will finally realize that by supporting Trump as he claims absolute power, they are clearing the way for a successor who ignores Congress and inconvenient laws to, say, expand abortion rights, gay rights, gun control and restrictions on Christian schools. Maybe they will grasp that the democratic safeguards they are now letting Trump overrun won\u2019t be there when a future leader claims an \u201cabsolute right\u201d to assault what they hold dear.\n\nDoubtful. But let\u2019s hear no more pseudo-piety about \u201cmoral obligations\u201d from the likes of Reed. The highest moral obligation for all who favor a democratic future is to stop an absolutely corrupted man.\n\nRead more from Dana Milbank\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.\n\n\n\n", "description": "The president has \u201call of these rights at a level nobody has ever seen before.\u201d", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAIDXLb.img?h=201&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=2494&y=2709", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
