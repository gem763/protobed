When they do, they are usually large corporations, like the music streaming service Spotify, which complained to the European Union earlier this year that Apple uses its platform to favor its own music service.\n\nBut times are changing. The biggest tech companies, including Apple, are being scrutinized by lawmakers and regulators for how they wield their market dominance. House lawmakers last month issued sweeping document requests to Silicon Valley giants, including Apple, in hopes of shedding light on their competitive practices. For instance, Apple was asked to turn over information on how it decides which apps and features to copy and why.\n\nSilicon Valley\u2019s new-found scrutiny may be emboldening some of big tech\u2019s smaller competitors.\n\nBlix\u2019s BlueMail launched in 2015 and has been installed by about 10 million users globally, according to the research firm Sensor Tower. In 2017, it was featured in a segment on the Today Show.\n\nBlue Mail also offers the ability to create and use random email addresses. That allows Blue Mail users to email back and forth without the person on the other end ever knowing the actual email address of the person using Blue Mail.\n\nApple\u2019s new sign-in feature offers a similar service. Apple customers can create new internet accounts using their Apple credentials. In the process, they can create randomly generated email addresses instead of sharing their actual addresses with outside companies. Emails to the random address are forwarded by Apple to the real address, and customers can choose to stop receiving mail from the random address. For instance, if there\u2019s too much spam.\n\nBlue Mail doesn\u2019t claim to be the first company to conceive of masked email addresses. There are many other services that offer a similar feature. But it\u2019s accusing Apple of using its patented method for doing it, which Blue Mail says is novel and user friendly.\n\nApple spokesman Fred Sainz declined to comment.\n\nBlue Mail alleges in its lawsuit, filed by law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, that in August 2018, shortly after it launched its \u201canonymous share\u201d feature, its standing in Apple\u2019s App Store began falling.\n\nThe lawsuit doesn\u2019t offer any specific evidence that Apple deliberately hurt its downloads. And according to Sensor Tower, Blue Mail\u2019s popularity, which peaked in 2016, was in decline by 2018. But Blue Mail does offer a possible motive: Apple was planning to announce a similar feature in less than a year.\n\nThen, in May 2019, Blue Mail launched a desktop application for Mac. According to the lawsuit, the app was climbing the rankings in the store before it received an email from Apple, informing Blue Mail that it had violated Apple\u2019s terms of service. The app was spammy, or it was too similar to other apps.\n\nBlue Mail claims in its lawsuit that Apple customers are less likely to install an application on their Mac computer if it\u2019s not available through Apple\u2019s built-in App Store. The suit cites security warnings Apple gives to customers who try to install apps by downloading the software outside the App store.\n\nAccording to correspondence cited in the lawsuit, Blue Mail pushed Apple for more details on why it was being barred from the Mac App Store. Apple responded, citing Blue Mail\u2019s similarity to a different mail client called TypeApp. That one, though, was also owned by Blue Mail\u2019s parent company, and the company had stopped offering it on the App Store.\n\nIn response, Blue Mail asked how it could be too similar to TypeApp, when TypeApp was no longer in the App store.\n\nApple still wouldn\u2019t budge, according to the complaint. \"After further review and consideration we have found that your application is still not in compliance with our guidelines,\u201d the company wrote. Apple removed the app from the store.", "description": "", "authors": ["Reed Albergotti", "Reporter Covering Consumer Electronics", "October At Pm", "Reed Albergotti Is The Washington Post'S Consumer Electronics Reporter", "Taking Readers Inside Powerful", "Secretive Companies Such As Apple", "Shedding Light On The Murky", "Global Industry Responsible For Building The Myriad Devices That Touch Every Aspect Of Our Lives.
