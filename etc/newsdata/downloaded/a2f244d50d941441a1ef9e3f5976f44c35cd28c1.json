Hong Kong is Australia\u2019s 12th-largest trading partner with two-way trade worth about $18 billion last year. Despite the FTA, further growth is now likely to be more stunted than expected.\n\nThe Hong Kong protests are making little headway against China while alienating foreign investors and tourists. Kirsty Needham\n\nChinese companies are pulling back from Hong Kong too, apprehensive about the prospect of attacks on their buildings or representatives.\n\nThe usual flood of international business conferences held in Hong Kong has been dammed up, not least because the organisers are unable to guarantee the security of the participants.\n\nAlarm bell for business\n\nFor businesses, a different form of security alarm sounded back in August with the forced resignation of Cathay Pacific\u2019s chief executive Rupert Hogg after some of the airline's staff participated in the demonstrations.\n\nBut most Western tourists also prefer to avoid any prospect of chaos or violent clashes for their holidays while tourism from mainland China, Hong Kong\u2019s main market, is slumping.\n\nThe number of visitors to Hong Kong has fallen by nearly half while retail sales in August were down by a quarter relative to the previous year. Figures will have declined even more sharply as violence has escalated in recent weeks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMainland Chinese visitors are not only repelled by the risk of getting caught up in confrontations completely alien to the political \u201cstability\u201d of the mainland. They also resent the challenge to Chinese patriotism, particularly when Beijing regularly blames the US for stirring up the protests and encouraging \u201cterrorism\u201d.\n\nOf course, allegations of US interference as well as the protesters\u2019 desperate appeals for support from America are particularly ironic given the repeated willingness of the US President to trade away any backing for democracy in Hong Kong for the prospect of reaching a trade deal with China.\n\nThe result is a domestic economy heading right into recession. But all this would be manageable as a temporary aberration if there was any prospect of a recovery. The more important question is over Hong Kong\u2019s shrinking future as a hub of global trade and financial services.\n\nXi won't be thwarted\n\nAt the time of the handover in 1997, Hong Kong\u2019s leaders proudly assured everyone the future was bright and secure despite concerns about how the territory would fare under China. That assessment has always turned out to be right despite repeated crises and growing economic inequality among Hong Kong citizens, including apartment prices spiralling beyond reach for many.\n\nChina\u2019s extraordinary pace and scale of economic growth since then has propelled cities such as Shanghai and Shenzhen into becoming potential rivals to Hong Kong as financial centres. Beijing has developed a \u201cGreater Bay\u201d policy to link Hong Kong and Shenzhen into a vast megatropolis.\n\nYet Hong Kong\u2019s rule of law, its more predictable regulations, the free movement of capital and its use of English continued to make it attractive as a gateway \u2013 both into and out of China.\n\nThis was not just about global investors feeling more comfortable with the legal protections offered by Hong Kong. Hong Kong is also by far the largest offshore centre for bond sales by Chinese firms, for example, also allowing them to raise funds in hard currency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat hasn\u2019t stopped is China\u2019s tightening political control over Hong Kong. Xi Jinping is certainly not a president to be thwarted by the 50-year framework of \u201cone country two systems\u201d supposedly guaranteeing freedom of speech and assembly and protest.\n\nDissent has become much more difficult if not dangerous since the Umbrella protest movement of 2014. Its leaders were jailed while pro-democracy lawmakers were disqualified from the legislature. But China\u2019s looming dominance and aggressively authoritarian nature under Xi has also become increasingly visible and foreboding in Hong Kong.\n\nWhen the growing economic and political frustrations of a younger generation were ignited by the decision of the Chief Executive Carrie Lam to proceed with an extradition bill with China, it was still hard to imagine five months of mass protests. The stand-off and the violence come with no apparent exit route between mutually exclusive demands.\n\nAccording to a report in the Financial Times, the Chinese government is drawing up plans to replace Lam with an interim leader. Yet neither Lam nor any successor selected by China can ever give the demonstrators what they want. For now, the policy seems to be to rely on the violence and an economy in deep trouble turning off support for the demonstrators.\n\nIt\u2019s hardly a future that Hong Kong \u2013 or Western businesses \u2013 relied on.", "description": "Australia is promoting its free trade agreement with Hong Kong but the protests have greatly accelerated the decline of Hong Kong as a vibrant global financial centre.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3745%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_428%2C$y_15/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/4ea6d9c776585fae2f1dfcf7ba2f40c07eb501b8", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
