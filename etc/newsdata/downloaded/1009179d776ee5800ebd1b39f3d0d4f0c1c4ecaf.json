The recipients included schools in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Israel.\n\nFor decades, the wealthiest members of the family have been behind major philanthropic giving in the worlds of art, medicine and education, often leading to their name being bestowed on prestigious galleries or educational entities. They were listed by Forbes magazine in 2016 as one of the nation\u2019s 20 wealthiest families, with holdings of $13bn.\n\nMuch of their giving has fuelled research in genetics and brain development. Other gifts supported medical schools, student scholarships and faculty jobs. It amounts to a small fraction of universities\u2019 overall fundraising, but schools say the money has been a boon to important programs.\n\nWhen evaluating the ethics of Sackler gifts, some experts argue, it\u2019s important to consider what schools knew about the family and when they knew it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at this through the lens of what people know now,\u201d said Ross Cheit, chairman of the Rhode Island Ethics Commission and a professor at Brown University, which has accepted donations from family members. \u201cMy sense is, during the time period we\u2019re talking about, people\u2019s views about that source of money changed a lot.\u201d\n\nAs opioid deaths, lawsuits and protests have mounted, some schools joined with businesses and museums cutting ties with the family, but none plans to return the money. One school is redirecting unspent donations. Most schools refused to say whether they would accept donations in the future.\n\nThe financial records may not capture all giving by the family. Colleges are not required to disclose donation information, and many refused to provide details to the AP.\n\nRockefeller University accepted more Sackler money than any other school in recent history \u2013 $11m-plus from the Sackler Foundation in Canada. Richard Sackler, a former president of Purdue Pharma, previously taught at the school.\n\nRockefeller, which enrolls about 200 students in graduate science programs, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nBehind Rockefeller was the University of Sussex in England, which received $9.8m, according to tax records. A university spokesman said the school actually received about $4m over the past decade, while another pledge \u201cwas not progressed\u201d. The funding supports Sussex\u2019s Sackler Centre for Consciousness Science, which performs research of \u201cparamount importance\u201d that will continue for years, the school said.\n\nOxford and the University of Glasgow in Scotland each received $5m to $6m, tax records show. Columbia University followed with nearly $5m, while Imperial College London and McGill University in Montreal each received more than $3m.\n\nThe AP contacted all universities that were identified in tax records as receiving more than $1m, along with some that were not listed in tax records but previously publicized major gifts from some family members.\n\nOf those 20 schools, three \u2013 Cornell, Yale and the California Institute of Technology \u2013 said they had made formal decisions to reject future funding from the family.\n\nSome schools said they had no plans to accept Sackler funding for the foreseeable future, including Brown and the University of Washington. Most others refused to disclose their plans.\n\nAt many schools, the money has already been spent. And even if officials wanted to return what\u2019s left, it isn\u2019t simple. There are tax hurdles and legal obstacles that can make it difficult to return gifts from charities.", "description": "Family that owns Purdue Pharma faces lawsuits over opioid epidemic and institutions in Canada and Israel also received donations", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/547931154278994764e1013966be6fb75c8160eb/0_92_4287_2572/master/4287.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=92e0135d71a866ab0e4525ea296d4e5e", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
