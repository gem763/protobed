I shouldn\u2019t be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean yet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you,\u201d said the Swedish teenager, her voice quivering.\n\n\u201cYou have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words,\u201d Thunberg said, adding that the plans that leaders will unveil will not be enough to respond to the rate of the planet\u2019s warming.\n\nThunberg has galvanized a new wave of climate change activism through her weekly Fridays for Future school strikes, which she began with her weekly, solitary protests outside of the Swedish parliament.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had warned governments ahead of the event that they would have to offer action plans to qualify to speak at the summit, which is aimed at boosting the 2015 Paris Agreement to combat global warming.\n\nIn his opening remarks, he tried to capture the urgency of climate change and called out the fossil fuel industry.\n\n\u201cNature is angry. And we fool ourselves if we think we can fool nature, because nature always strikes back, and around the world nature is striking back with fury,\u201d Guterres said.\n\n\u201cThere is a cost to everything. But the biggest cost is doing nothing. The biggest cost is subsidising a dying fossil fuel industry, building more and more coal plants, and denying what is plain as day: that we are in a deep climate hole, and to get out we must first stop digging,\u201d he said.\n\nTRUMP APPEARS\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump, a climate change denier who has undone every major U.S. regulation aimed at combating climate change, made a brief appearance in the audience of the summit along with Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. He did not give remarks but he listened to remarks by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\n16-year-old Swedish Climate activist Greta Thunberg speaks at the 2019 United Nations Climate Action Summit at U.N. headquarters in New York City, New York, U.S., September 23, 2019. REUTERS/Carlo Allegri\n\nFormer New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who serves as the U.N. special envoy on climate action, called out Trump\u2019s stealth appearance before he spoke on Monday: \u201cHopefully our deliberations will be helpful to you as you formulate climate policy,\u201d he said to audience laughter.\n\nMerkel announced Germany would double Germany\u2019s contribution to a U.N. fund to support less developed countries to combat climate change to 4 billion euros from 2 billion euros.\n\nAmong the day\u2019s other initial announcements was one from the Marshall Islands, whose president Hilda Heine said she would seek parliamentary approval to declare a climate crisis on the low-lying atoll, already grappling with sea level rise.\n\nHeine said her country and New Zealand, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and others who form the \u201cHigh Ambition\u201d bloc at U.N. climate negotiations, will commit to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.\n\nOver 60 world leaders and CEOs of energy and financial companies are expected to address the conference and announce climate finance measures and transitioning from coal power.\n\nWith climate impacts such as extreme weather, thawing permafrost and sea-level rise unfolding much faster than expected, scientists say the urgency of the crisis has intensified since the Paris accord was agreed.\n\nThe agreement will enter a crucial implementation phase next year after another round of negotiations in Chile in December. Pledges made so far under the agreement are nowhere near enough to avert catastrophic warming, scientists say, and last year carbon emissions hit a record high.\n\nSlideshow (25 Images)\n\nOver the past year, Guterres has called for no new coal plants to be built after 2020, urged a phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies and asked countries to map out how to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.\n\nWhile some countries have made progress, some of the biggest emitting countries remain far behind, even as wildfires, heat waves and record temperatures have provided glimpses of the devastation that could lie in store in a warmer world.\n\nIn a measure of the gap between government action and the ever-louder alarms sounded by climate scientists, the United Nations Development Programme said that 14 nations representing a quarter of global emissions have signalled that they do not intend to revise current climate plans by 2020.\n\nPope Francis, in a message broadcast to the conference, called for honesty, responsibility and courage to face \u201cone of the most serious and worrying phenomena of our time\u201d.", "description": "Teenage climate change activist Greta Thunberg on Monday opened the United Nations Climate Action Summit with an angry condemnation of world leaders for failing to take strong measures to combat climate change - \"How dare you,\" she said.", "authors": ["Valerie", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1433015303&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M1D0", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
