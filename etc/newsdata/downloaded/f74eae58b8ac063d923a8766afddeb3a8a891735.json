Disability History Month: Barnardo\u2019s unseen 125-year-old photos 1/8 William Large was admitted in 1888, aged around seven and a half. His mother had died of tuberculosis the previous year, and his father was sent to the workhouse. According to records, the father\u2019s \u2018carelessness and cruelty to the child have caused the hip disease with which the little one is afflicted\u2019. William was also deaf and had tuberculosis. He was trained within the print school at Stepney, and was able to secure employment as a printer in 1899 Barnardo\u2019s 2/8 Fred Forty was born in 1875 in Cheltenham, into a \u2018wretched home\u2019. His mother died of tuberculosis, and his father, a shoemaker, was described as \u2018drunken and totally unconcerned with his six children\u2019. Fred had at least two operations on his cleft palate which were unsuccessful, and had only one eye as a result of an accident. He was admitted in 1888, aged 13. Fred died in 1895 and is buried at Tower Hamlets cemetery Barnardo\u2019s 3/8 Kate McLoughlin was born in 1882 in Nottingham, and was admitted to Barnardo\u2019s at the age of seven by the local vicar. Her father had been in prison several times, and was in jail at the time. The family of five lived in one room which the local vicar described as, \u2018the most utter squalor and filth\u2019. It was \u2018the very worst home\u2019 he knew in his parish. Kate\u2019s mother battled alcoholism, and while she was out drinking, her first child drowned in a bucket of water, and another was seriously burnt. When Kate was just a baby, she fell out of her mother\u2019s arms, and subsequently suffered hip disease and deformity. After care and training in the homes, she went into domestic service in 1905 Barnardo\u2019s 4/8 Alfred Smith was born in 1875 in the town of Rugeley, Staffordshire. His father died of diabetes nine years later, leaving seven children. His mother was unable to work due to abscesses on her legs, and was receiving parish relief. Alfred had his right leg amputated when he was just 13. Two years later, he was admitted to the homes, and received an apprenticeship in the Tailors workshop. In 1895, he was working as a tailor in Surrey Barnardo\u2019s 5/8 Thomas Marks was born in Rhymney, Caerphilly, in 1885. He was orphaned at a young age when both parents died as a result of heavy drinking. When Thomas was just eight, he \u2018had both his legs cut off from the trunk by an engine running over him\u2019. Despite this, he managed to scrape a living on the street as a pickpocket until he was admitted to Barnardo\u2019s at the age of 15. He was given an apprenticeship in the tailoring workshop and subsequently found employment as a tailor on leaving the homes. By 1899 he had his own business in Wales Barnardo\u2019s 6/8 Herbert Harris was admitted in March 1892 aged 18. His father died from tuberculosis three months after Herbert was born and his mother remarried a porter who worked at the Millwall Dock Company. Herbert was working at paper mills in Millwall when both his hands were drawn into some machinery. He spent three months in hospital where his arms needed to be amputated \u2013 one above, the other below the elbow. His mother received \u00a350 from Herbert\u2019s employer which was used to stock her shop. The admission report says that it appears that none of the money was spent on behalf of the boy, apart from buying a barrow for him on which he might sell fruit. Herbert\u2019s aunt claimed his mother and her husband brutally ill-treated him, that the husband had severely beat both Herbert and his mother. And in his admissions report, was described as, \u2018civil-mannered\u2019 and \u2018in great fear of his mother and her husband\u2019. Herbert died in August 1896 and is buried in Tower Hamlets cemetery Barnardo\u2019s 7/8 Elizabeth Lines was born in 1884 in Deptford, London. Her father died of tuberculosis three years later. A fall during infancy is believed to have caused abscesses on her knee-joint, which made it necessary to amputate her leg when she was just 19 months old. She was admitted aged eight, and received training which helped her secure work as a dressmaker in Port Talbot by 1905 Barnardo\u2019s 8/8 Alfred Collings was born in November 1895 in Plymouth and admitted in January 1905 aged nine. His father died from pleurisy and pneumonia in 1901, with his mother receiving \u00a310 insurance money. Soon after the death Alfred suffered a fall which led to the bone in his foot becoming diseased. Unfortunately the problem wasn\u2019t identified or treated for a long time and eventually the parish doctor ordered him to the infirmary, where his foot was amputated. The admission report says: \u2018Alfred is of a specially bright, lively and mischievous disposition and has been petted and spoilt by the men in the infirmary. He was perpetually playing pranks\u2019 Barnardo\u2019s 1/8 William Large was admitted in 1888, aged around seven and a half.

He was perpetually playing pranks\u2019 Barnardo\u2019s\n\nHowever, after what happened on a recent journey, I\u2019m beginning to wonder whether I shouldn\u2019t look at that request in a different light. At least it affords me the opportunity to say \u201cno\u201d.\n\nLet me explain. I\u2019d just approached the first rising ground I encounter on my regular route. It\u2019s a short stretch but quite steep. As such, it takes a bit of time and quite a bit of effort to get past. I\u2019ve checked my Fitbit. It registers a satisfyingly sharp rise in my heart rate.\n\nOn this particular morning, I\u2019d put Mark Kermode and Simon Mayo\u2019s podcast on my phone. These two broadcasters are skilled conversationalists. Listening to them snark at each other while opining on the latest movie releases is a real pleasure and an escape given that I spend much of my working week writing about the attempts to rip this country apart by the shameful excuse for a government run by Boris Johnson.\n\nMy focus on the radio hosts made it all the more jarring when I felt hands on my back and the chair taking off like the Road Runner being pursued by Wile E Coyote in one of those classic Looney Tunes cartoons. Except I didn\u2019t feel inclined to say \u201cmeep meep\u201d. I ended up shouting \u201cno, get off, go away\u201d because, excuse the profanity, it scared the s*** out of me.\n\nThink about it. How would you feel if someone suddenly came up behind you, grabbed you, and started pushing you?\n\nMy wife has occasionally said, \u201cYou\u2019ll understand how women sometimes feel,\u201d after some of what I\u2019ve experienced post-accident. If that\u2019s even a taste of what they get, it\u2019s a wonder they\u2019re not an awful lot more pissed off than they are.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just trying to help,\u201d the man responsible for giving me the sort of fright you usually only get from one of those horror films that relies on jump scares shirtily replied.\n\nIt sure didn\u2019t feel like help. It felt more like an assault. Five minutes later I had to stop for the purposes of unleashing a volley of swear words. Think: football fans berating the referee for awarding a dodgy penalty against their team. Another five minutes and I had to stop again for the same purpose.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be grateful of that help one day,\u201d a friend once piously declared.\n\nNo, I damn well will not. I\u2019m never going to be grateful to have someone barrelling up behind me without so much as a by your leave, however infirm I might get.\n\nSometimes assistance is necessary because London was not built with disabilities in mind, much less the rest of the UK. Where it is needed it should be provided without fuss (which regrettably doesn\u2019t always happen).\n\nBut most people are perfectly capable of asking for it when they need it.\n\nDisabled does not mean incapable. In fact, many disabled people deeply resent being constantly treated as if they are.\n\nI understand that people offering assistance do so because they want to feel like they are fully paid up members of the human race. But believe me, unwanted help can be equally as bad as the lack of it when it is needed. And don\u2019t even get me started on the aggressive response you sometimes get when you refuse it.\n\nThe incident I endured was one of those cases. #JustAskDontGrab on Twitter suggests I\u2019m far from alone in experiencing this sort of thing.\n\nThe forthcoming Paralympics \u2013 the build-up for which is just starting to crank up \u2013 will feature a lot of very capable disabled people.\n\nPerhaps it could facilitate a real discussion about this. It\u2019s sorely needed.", "description": "Using a wheelchair for exercise has its trials.
