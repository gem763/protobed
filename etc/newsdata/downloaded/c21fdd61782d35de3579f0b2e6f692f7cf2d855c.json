Authorities have blamed \u201cunidentified snipers\u201d.\n\nBut human rights advocates and the growing numbers of Iraqis who have been able to access social media via channels bypassing restrictions in the country or from abroad, disagree.\n\nThey hold security forces responsible for the bloodshed: either by firing themselves or not protecting protesters from snipers who infiltrated the demonstrations.\n\nSo far, authorities have accepted responsibility for two incidents.\n\nThey have acknowledged that the military had used \u201cexcessive force\u201d in the Shiite bastion of Sadr City in Baghdad and say anti-riot police were responsible for the killing of a protester in Babylon south of the capital.\n\nBut overnight Friday, authorities ordered the creation of two new investigatory commissions.\n\nOne is led by Iraq\u2019s military command and expected to shed light on the deaths and wounded as well as attacks on public buildings and raids by unidentified gunmen on media.\n\nThe other, composed of representatives from the armed forces, parliament, the human rights commission and the judiciary will investigate and bring to justice soldiers who acted illegally.\n\nThis comes after a failed attempt in parliament on Thursday by lawmakers from former premier Haider al-Abadi\u2019s Victory Alliance to garner enough votes to summon Prime Minister Adel Abdel Mahdi.\n\nDuring his sermon on Friday, Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani, spiritual leader for Iraq\u2019s Shiite majority, upped the pressure on authorities.\n\n\u201cThe government is responsible when, under the eye of law enforcement, protesters are fired on illegally and media are beaten or attacked to terrorise their employees,\u201d he said.\n\nSistani, who wields significant power to influence the government, gave authorities \u201ctwo weeks\u201d to release the findings of the promised investigations.\n\nThe prime minister\u2019s office said the creation of the commission set to investigate military personnel, comes \u201cin response to Grand Ayatollah Sistani\u2019s sermon\u201d.", "description": "Baghdad (AFP) \u2013 Iraqi authorities, under pressure from the streets as well as political and religious forces, on Saturday increased the number of", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/12/0ad34f_thousands-iraqis-demonstrated-in-capital-baghdad-south-country-demanding-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
