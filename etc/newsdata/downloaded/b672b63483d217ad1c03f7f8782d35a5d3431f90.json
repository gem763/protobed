Schumer had forced the vote, calling it a key showdown on climate change.\n\n\u201cTime is running out for the United States to meet the existential threat posed by climate change,\u201d the New York Democrat said.\n\nBut he couldn\u2019t keep all his Democrats in line, much less win over Republicans, and saw his effort doomed on a 51-43 vote that saw several Democrats join the GOP in opposition.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, cheered the vote, saying it saved the country as many as 125,000 jobs, and prevented double-digit increases in energy costs.\n\n\u201cLow-income and minority populations would be hit hardest by the double-digit electricity bill increases in four of every five states,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. McConnell said that was too much pain for the promised benefits \u2014 one-hundredth of a degree less warming by 2050.\n\nEven if the resolution had passed, it was headed for a White House veto, and there was little chance of mustering the votes to override President Trump.\n\nMr. Schumer, though, has said he plans to force a series of votes on Trump administration rules in order to make senators take a stand on key issues, using the Congressional Review Act.\n\nThat law gives Congress the power to review, and try to overturn, new regulations issued by an administration. The law gives even the minority party in the Senate the power to force votes.\n\nMr. Schumer said last week that other upcoming votes will deal with health care and a Democratic attempt to roll back part of the GOP\u2019s 2017 tax cut law. Curiously, in that case, it\u2019s Democrats who are arguing for a tax cut to largely benefit wealthy homeowners in high-tax states.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
