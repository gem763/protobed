That\u2019s on top of a salary package which could be worth up to $4.8 million a year.\n\nThese are big numbers, to be sure. But there\u2019s argument to be made that Fahour is exactly the right sort of chief executive to take Latitude, which was formerly part of global conglomerate GE, from private to public.\n\nIn many ways, this is the story of a company shifting from a background player \u2013 providing white-label solutions to run other people\u2019s brands \u2013 to a true consumer business, with recognisable brands and a strong, visible presence in the Australian financial services market.\n\nNo matter what you think of Fahour, he is a leader with the personality and experience to front the show.\n\nNote that the prospectus doesn\u2019t include any pictures of Latitude\u2019s former pitchman, Hollywood star Alec Baldwin \u2013 Fahour\u2019s own star power will need to help carry this deal.\n\nSelling points\n\nThere are three key points that Fahour and his advisers will be looking to sell ahead of the float, scheduled for October 23.\n\nThe first is that Latitude is perfectly placed to fill the gaps created by the banking sector\u2019s deliberate or forced retreat from key sectors, particularly consumer lending.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the 12 months since Fahour arrived, the big banks have reduced consumer lending by about 30 per cent; Latitude\u2019s market share in this sector has risen from 9 per cent to 13 per cent, making it number three in this market, behind Commonwealth Bank and Westpac, but ahead of NAB and ANZ.\n\nThe second key point is that Latitude can provide investors with exposure to old-school, profitable consumer finance \u2013 cash profit is tipped at $287.6 million in the year to June 30 2020, up from $248.4 million in the 2018 financial year, before Fahour arrived \u2013 overlaid with exposure to booming technology-driven sectors such as smaller scale buy now, pay later transactions.\n\nTrue, Latitude\u2019s business in this end of the buy now, pay later sector is small, but the surging share prices of Afterpay, Zip and Flexigroup underline the consumer shift towards these types of payment models.\n\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, this is a float backed by private equity giant KKR, and the prospectus suggests there\u2019s more than a bit of growth left in the tank.\n\nIt\u2019s really not that long since Latitude was fully extracted from GE. What the company called its Latitude 2.0 strategy is still quite young.\n\nIn the past 12 months, Fahour has rebranded his credit card business and pushed into that smaller end of the buy now, pay later sector through the acquisition of New Zealand business, Genoapay. But the company\u2019s board has just approved a five-year plan that will see Fahour push on with building up these new areas, and rebranding products across his portfolio..\n\nThe Latitude camp reckons its share of its addressable market across Australia and New Zealand is somewhere around 2 per cent. The argument is that if Fahour can get to 4 per cent in the coming years, profit should more than double, given improved operating leverage.\n\nThere are risks to this, of course. Getting consumer brands to resonate isn\u2019t easy. While the banks are in retreat, the economy is fragile. And recent floats haven\u2019t exactly set the world on fire.\n\nAs always with Ahmed, this will be fascinating to watch.", "description": "Ahmed Fahour stands to win big from Latitude's float, but he's also arguably the right man to steer this business from the shadows onto centre stage.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7811%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1ebdc7031c00410efa9c3fd2f10fa34eea05288a", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
