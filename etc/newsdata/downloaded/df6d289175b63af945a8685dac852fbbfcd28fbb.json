General Assembly in New York.\n\n\u201cI think we had good phone call, it was normal, we spoke about many things,\u201d Mr. Zelensky said.\n\n\u201cNobody pushed me, yes,\u201d he added.\n\nMr. Trump said he did not try to force Mr. Zelensky to dig into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, as Democrats investigate whether there was a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d at hand in exchange for aid money.\n\nThe president said he doesn\u2019t want Mr. Zelensky to stick it to Mr. Biden, though did say he wants Ukraine to fight \u201ccorruption.\u201d\n\nHowever, the president then raised questions about Hunter Biden, suggesting he might have benefited from his father\u2019s position to get money through business deals in Ukraine and China.\n\nHe also defended his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, for poking around Ukraine in search of information related to the 2016 campaign, Hillary Clinton\u2019s lost emails and how the Russian-meddling probe enveloped the Trump campaign.\n\n\u201cRudy\u2019s looking to also find out where the phony witch hunt started, where it started,\u201d Mr. Trump said, vocally defending the former New York City mayor. \u201cWhere did it start? How come it started?\u201d\n\nMr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky also took swipes at President Obama during the sit-down.\n\n\u201cAs you remember, you lost Crimea during a prior administration,\u201d Mr. Trump said, blaming Mr. Obama instead of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who forcefully annexed the region of Ukraine.\n\nMr. Zelensky said Mr. Trump is welcome to visit Ukraine, saying his predecessor \u201cdidn\u2019t find time.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump reiterated his frustration with Democrats in Congress, saying House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has \u201clost her way\u201d and has no interest in fighting gun violence.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s no longer the speaker of the House,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
