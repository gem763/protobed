He said he worried there would be even less ice next time someone attempts the comparison, as global warming continues to melt the glaciers\n\nWalter Mittelholzer, a pilot and photographer from Switzerland, took his own picture from a biplane 100 years ago\n\nThen they took a helicopter to revisit the site and recreate the photo themselves.\n\nThe resulting photograph shows glaciers named Argentiere, Mont Blanc Bossons and Mer de Glace.\n\nAnd the change in the shading on their surfaces shows how much ice has been lost since the end of the First World War.\n\nDr Baxter added: 'Mittelholzer played a key role in popularising commercial air travel in Switzerland, an industry which ironically came to contribute to the warming of the climate and the detriment of the alpine landscapes that the pioneering pilot knew and loved.\n\nThe recent photographs showed the Argentiere, Mont Blanc Bossons and Mer de Glace glaciers and plainly showed how ice was retreating fro the lower slopes of the mountain\n\nDr Kieran Baxter (pictured) said: 'The scale of the ice loss was immediately evident as we reached altitude but it was only by comparing the images side-by-side that the last 100 years of change were made visible'\n\nIn the older photos there is obviously more ice on the glaciers, while in the modern pictures the earth appears green and brown as the foliage and rocks beneath show through\n\n'When working at these heights there is currently no viable emission-free alternative so airtime is kept as brief as possible and careful planning goes into getting the most out of a photography flight like this one.\n\n'Luckily, clear weather allowed these repeat aerial photographs to be taken on the centenary of the originals.\n\n'Unless we drastically reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, there will be little ice left to photograph in another hundred years.'", "description": "Researchers from the University of Dundee have exactly recreated a photograph taken by a Swiss pilot in 1919 and show the loss of ice from glaciers on the French mountain.", "authors": ["Sam Blanchard For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/10/19581148-0-image-a-7_1570786836283.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
