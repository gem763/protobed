A public version of such reports is typically released after those involved in the report have had a chance to comment.\n\nMr. Horowitz\u2019s report is examining the basis for FBI surveillance of Carter Page, who served as a foreign-policy adviser for the 2016 Trump campaign. Surveillance of Mr. Page was authorized by the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in October 2016, shortly after Mr. Page left the Trump campaign. The court subsequently renewed the warrant on Mr. Page three times, keeping him under surveillance through much of 2017.\n\nIn its surveillance warrants, which have since been partially declassified and released, the government said it suspected that Mr. Page was the subject of \u201ctargeted recruitment by the Russian government.\u201d\n\nMr. Page has never been charged with a crime and has long said there was no basis for putting him under surveillance. Special counsel Robert Mueller \u2019s report concluded: \u201cThe investigation did not establish that Page coordinated with the Russian government in its efforts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election.\u201d\n\nThe surveillance of Mr. Page has become a lightning rod for criticism from Mr. Trump and his allies, who say the warrants against him had been improperly sought and were evidence of wrongdoing by the FBI.\n\nAs part of a bid to obtain a warrant against Mr. Page, the government cited the work of Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence agent whose work was paid for by the Democratic Party. Law-enforcement officials have defended that decision, saying Mr. Steele was a well-regarded researcher who had assisted in other law-enforcement matters.\n\nThey say they disclosed the potential conflict of interest over the Democratic funding of Mr. Steele\u2019s work to the court, which didn\u2019t see it as a hindrance to approving the surveillance on Mr. Page.\n\nMr. Horowitz\u2019s team has been asking questions critical of law-enforcement decisions around the handling of Mr. Steele, according to people familiar with the matter. The inspector-general team has asked why the FBI continued to cite Mr. Steele as a credible source in the renewal applications, the Wall Street Journal has previously reported.\n\nAttorney General William Barr has also launched a separate inquiry into what he termed \u201cspying\u201d on the Trump campaign, language he said was benign but that echoes Mr. Trump\u2019s frequent criticisms of the investigation. That probe is separate from Mr. Horowitz\u2019s investigation, but the two men have talked, and Mr. Barr said the inspector-general\u2019s office would be working closely with his staff on the review.\n\nJohn Durham, the U.S. attorney for Connecticut, has been tapped to lead the attorney general\u2019s review.\n\n\u2014Natalie Andrews contributed to this article.", "description": "The Justice Department\u2019s independent watchdog has completed a draft of a highly anticipated report on the FBI surveillance of a one-time associate of President Trump during the 2016 campaign, raising the prospect that the report will be released to the public in the coming weeks.", "authors": ["Byron Tau", "Byron.Tau Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107198/social", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
