Risk avoidance, in handling other people's money, drives that money to a less uncertain place.\"\n\nWith financial services accounting for about one-fifth of Hong Kong's GDP (gross domestic product), any disruption will have a real impact on the economy, which is already slipping as tourists desert the city and retail sales slump.\n\nThe possibility of Hong Kong's legal system changing earlier than the scheduled deadline of 2047 is another cause of angst among family offices, according to IQ-EQ Group executive chairman Serge Krancenblum.\n\nThe city operates a legal system derived from British common law under the One Country, Two Systems principle. A failed attempt to introduce extradition laws that would expose citizens to prosecution in mainland China sparked the protests and the imposition of colonial-era emergency powers have also shaken investor confidence.\n\n\"If you're an investor, even a non-local one with Hong Kong structures as a family office, how can you base your future on a system that may not be there as long as you thought it would be?\" Mr Krancenblum said. \"This is a very big problem. Investors, and families, care about stability.\"\n\nThe instability may already be having an impact, with Goldman Sachs Group Inc estimating that there has been an outflow of Hong Kong dollar deposits of between US$3 billion and US$4 billion to Singapore.\n\nHedge funds\n\n\"We've seen some of our Hong Kong-based managed clients that have said they want to move their assets from Hong Kong-based banks to Singapore-based banks,\" said Steve Knabl, chief operating officer of Swiss-Asia Financial Services Pte, whose platform hosts hedge funds and wealth managers. \"So the move is clearly there, especially from private clients.\"\n\nWhile many hedge funds are seeking advice from lawyers, accountants and migration agents, few are actually moving, and Mr Knabl said he didn't expect an overnight shift in staff from Hong Kong to Singapore.\n\nEurekahedge Pte data shows assets under management by Hong Kong hedge funds reached a record high US$92.1 billion in September.\n\nThis is partly because the months-long process needed to get a licence in Singapore can be a deterrent to moving. Hong Kong also remains a better gateway for hedge funds seeking to profit from mainland China without the downsides of living there.\n\nBLOOMBERG", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Banking & Finance - [SINGAPORE]\u00a0 Service providers to some of Asia's wealthiest families say they are fielding a rising number of calls about shifting away from Hong Kong, with some already moving money to Singapore-based banks. .
