But I didn't know either. I tried to reach him and his cousin, but that was in vain.\n\n'They were both unavailable for three days. Somehow I had guessed at the time that he was no longer in Dortmund at all, so I went to his house and found out that he had gone to France with his mother in the morning.\n\nDembele played for Dortmund for a year, but it did not end amicably for him in Germany\n\nDembele has played 68 times since joining Barcelona but has been hampered by injuries\n\n'Ousmane was really gone overnight and I was the only one who had contact with him later.\n\n'I told him that he should come back, so that we could talk about things and he could understand BVB, that he must behave professionally. But it was already too late for that.'\n\nDembele has since played 68 times for Barcelona in the two seasons he has been there, but has also missed 46 through a series of injuries.", "description": "Dembele's \u00a396million transfer to the Nou Camp was one of the biggest deals of summer 2017, and the Frenchman did not leave Dortmund in the best light.", "authors": ["Ben Nagle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/16/19303548-0-image-a-182_1570203120196.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
