With sustained winds of 185 mph Sunday afternoon and evening, the Category 5 storm has risen to the top of the charts among the most powerful tropical systems ever observed in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nIt\u2019s the strongest storm on record to occur east of Florida in the Atlantic and so far north. After striking the northern Bahamas, it matched the 1935 Labor Day hurricane for the strongest winds of any storm making landfall. These are just a few of the incredible feats Dorian has already accomplished, and more may be ahead.\n\nLet\u2019s walk through some of the more impressive statistics.\n\n\n\nHurricane Dorian\u2019s winds compared with the maximum winds in the hurricane database by a one-degree grid. (Ian Livingston/The Washington Post)\n\nStrongest landfall winds (tie): Hurricane Dorian\u2019s 185 mph (160 knots) sustained wind at landfall on Great Abaco in the northwest Bahamas this afternoon tied for the strongest winds at landfall on record in the Atlantic Ocean. The only other storm with wind speeds that high at landfall is the similarly timed Labor Day hurricane of 1935. Dorian may have produced gusts as high as 220 mph.\n\n#Dorian hit #GreatAbaco Island in the #Bahamas with sustained winds of 185 mph, tied for the strongest landfall anywhere in the Atlantic -- the #LaborDay Hurricane of 1935 was the other (the tie only applies to wind speed, not central pressure). pic.twitter.com/XsK3Y7VpuD \u2014 Brian McNoldy (@BMcNoldy) September 1, 2019\n\nTied for second when it comes to maximum winds in the Atlantic. Dorian\u2019s 185 mph sustained winds are second only to Hurricane Allen (1980) in the record that dates to the 1850s. Allen topped out at 190 mph sustained. Hurricane Dorian\u2019s 185 mph sustained puts the storm in company with Hurricane Wilma (2005), Hurricane Gilbert (1988) and the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935.\n\n#HurricaneDorian now has max winds of 185 mph - tying it for the 2nd strongest Atlantic hurricane since 1950:\n\n\n\nAllen (1980): 190 mph\n\nGilbert (1988): 185 mph\n\nWilma (2005): 185 mph pic.twitter.com/jv8CxNPMZc \u2014 Philip Klotzbach (@philklotzbach) September 1, 2019\n\nStrongest storm on record for the Bahamas. This may go without saying given the bullets above, but it\u2019s worth repeating \u2014 and zooming in on the hardest-hit places in the northwest parts of the island nation. Before Dorian, its worst storm was the 1932 Bahamas hurricane, which passed by with 160 mph winds as a Category 5. Hurricane Andrew in 1992 also passed just south of Dorian\u2019s Bahamian landfall zone but wasn\u2019t nearly as strong as Dorian.\n\nRecent 500 m GOES-East visible satellite imagery of Category 5 Hurricane Dorian making landfall in The Bahamas.

(Ian Livingston/The Washington Post)\n\nGaining strength at record speed: Dorian underwent what\u2019s known as rapid intensification between both Friday and Saturday and Saturday and Sunday. Rapid intensification refers to an increase in wind speeds of at least 35 mph in 24 hours. Dorian entered rare air for this metric, too. In a space of just nine hours on Sunday, its peak winds increased from about 150 mph (130 knots) to 185 mph (160 knots) \u2014 a rate of intensification never before observed for a storm this strong:\n\nIn the last 24 hour, Hurricane #Dorian intensified from 130kt to 160kt ... in fact it did this in under 9 hours.\n\n\n\nRapid intensification is an impressive enough feat, but becomes extremely rare from high initial intensities. From 130kt, it is unprecedented in the Atlantic. pic.twitter.com/Fi2e0y7EJo \u2014 Sam Lillo (@splillo) September 1, 2019\n\nFirst time with four consecutive years featuring Category 5s in the Atlantic: 2019 became the fourth straight year with a Category 5 in the Atlantic, the longest such streak on record. Dorian became the fifth Category 5 hurricane to form in the past four years in the Atlantic following Matthew (2016), Irma (2017), Maria (2017) and Michael (2018). No matter how you count it, the overall trend in such powerhouse storms is upward.\n\nFour straight years.\n\n\n\nFive category five hurricanes.\n\n\n\nFive incredible eyes. pic.twitter.com/LeD1nnbRZb \u2014 Dakota Smith (@weatherdak) September 1, 2019\n\nAs you may have gathered following our storm coverage, Hurricane Dorian isn\u2019t going anywhere fast, so we could see more records set.\n\nThe unusual strength of Dorian and the rate at which it developed is consistent with the expectation of more intense hurricanes in a warming world. Some studies have shown increases in hurricane rapid intensification, and modeling studies project an uptick in the frequency of Category 4 and 5 storms.", "description": "Dorian has risen to the top of the charts among the most powerful hurricanes ever observed in the Atlantic Ocean.", "authors": ["Ian Livingston", "September At Pm", "Ian Livingston Is A Forecaster Photographer", "Information Lead For The Capital Weather Gang.
