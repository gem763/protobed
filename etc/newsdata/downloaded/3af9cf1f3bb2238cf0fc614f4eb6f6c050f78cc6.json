REUTERS/Aly Song\n\nForeign portfolio inflows into stocks in the world\u2019s second largest economy have slowed dramatically. Stocks exposed to overseas markets and a weaker yuan have seen sustained selling while companies in the consumer and technology sectors have seen share prices rise as Beijing boosts domestic consumption and seeks technological independence.\n\nGRAPHIC: Foreign inflows decreased significantly amid trade tensions - here\n\nInflows in January-August via the Stock Connect scheme with Hong Kong were about 120 billion yuan ($16.92 billion). That topped the year-earlier number, but was a fraction of the 600 billion yuan of 2019 inflows the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) expressed hope for at beginning of the year.\n\nGlobal index provider MSCI is quadrupling the weighting of Chinese mainland shares in its global benchmarks this year, while FTSE Russell began adding China A-shares to its main emerging markets index in June.\n\nBut industrial profits have slowed since 2018\u2019s second half as economic growth slipped to a near 30-year low.\n\nGRAPHIC: China's industrial profits under pressure amid economic slowdown - here\n\nShares in machinery, electronics and home appliances firms, seen as vulnerable to trade tensions given their reliance on overseas markets, have been under selling pressure.\n\nBOE Technology (000725.SZ) is an example.
