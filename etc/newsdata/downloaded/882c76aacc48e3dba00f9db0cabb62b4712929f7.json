Perhaps predictably, the participants judged the doctor\u2019s decision far more harshly if they were told the patient subsequently died than when they were told that the patient lived \u2013 even though the benefits and risks were exactly the same in each case.\n\nThe outcome bias is so deeply ingrained in our brains that it\u2019s easy to understand why they would feel that the doctor should be punished for the patient\u2019s death. Yet the participants\u2019 reasoning is not logical, since there would have been no better way for the doctor to have weighed up that evidence \u2013 at the time of making the decision there was every chance the operation would have been a success. Once you know about the tragedy, however, it\u2019s hard to escape that nagging feeling that the doctor was nevertheless at fault \u2013 leading the participants to question his competence.", "description": "The outcome bias erodes your sense of risk and makes you blind to error, explaining everything from fatal plane crashes to the Columbia crash and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.", "authors": ["David Robson"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/7p/tl/p07ptlq4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
