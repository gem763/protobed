(AP) - A public meeting is scheduled on a bill to redesignate the New River Gorge National River in West Virginia as the New River Gorge National Park and Preserve.\n\nThe Wednesday morning meeting at the Canyon Rim Visitors Center Auditorium will be hosted by U.S. Sens. Joe Manchin and Shelley Moore Capito and U.S. Rep. Carol Miller. Manchin and Capito introduced the bill.\n\nThe Charleston Gazette-Mail reports the redesignation was sought because rebranding as a national park increases visitation without raising costs. It says visitation increases due to the assumption that national parks provide high-quality recreation experiences. The bill would redesignate up to 6,000 acres of the federal land\u2019s 72,808 acres as a national park competent, where hunting wouldn\u2019t be allowed. Hunting would still be allowed in the national preserve component.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A public meeting is scheduled on a bill to redesignate the New River Gorge National River in West Virginia as the New River Gorge National Park and Preserve.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
