Isabel Infantes/PA Wire\n\nBut the clothes themselves rebelled against such anxieties, with trends that sparked joy rather than sense and gargantuan gowns worthy of a wayward Disney princess.\n\nHere is our round-up of the key talking points from this season\u2019s London Fashion Week.\n\nBilly Porter stole the Frow\n\nWhen it came to this season\u2019s front row guests, no star shone brighter than actor Billy Porter, who was a loyal attendee at all of the best shows and arrived wearing a different ensemble to each. A high point was spotting Porter step out of his chauffeured car for designer Richard Quinn on Monday evening dressed like the Wizard of Oz, only to be greeted by a sizeable queue because the show was running late.\n\nVisibly bemused by the very British act of queueing, the Pittsburgh-born performer stood adrift for several minutes until a member of his entourage whisked him inside through a side door. Wizards don\u2019t do queues.\n\nChristopher Kane married sustainability with sexuality\n\nThe British designer\u2019s show was once again all about calling for \u201cMore Joy!\u201d, and maybe a bit more sex as well. The slogan, adopted from the title of 1970s sex manual The Joy of Sex, has featured in Kane\u2019s collections for several seasons now. While the words themselves appeared on nothing other than Kane\u2019s T-shirt when he appeared for the finale, their ebullient message undercut his entire collection. But there was an environmental twist. Dainty florals covered overcoats while leafy prints adorned ruffled skirts, giving an earthy feel that was sexed-up by new slogans, such as \u201cEco Sex\u201d and \u201cMake love to the wind\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about people who love nature,\u201d Kane told Vogue. \u201cMaking love in nature. Being in touch with the earth. Sleeping with the stars! We\u2019ve had a lot of fun coming up with words for it in the studio.\u201d\n\nJW Anderson delivered spangled lingerie\n\nModels were adorned in jewel-encrusted bras (Getty)\n\nThe British designer is better known for his tailored coats and utilitarian accessories than his lingerie. But this season, Anderson styled swirled crystal bras over many of his looks. While we can\u2019t picture ourselves making the same statement in spring, the designer\u2019s unabashed celebration of female sexuality was clear and impactful. There were plenty more wearable options too, from draped jersey dresses to a slick beige overcoat with contrasting white lapels.\n\nLong sleeves and cowboy boots made unlikely returns on and off the catwalk\n\nThis was the season when designers got experimental with sleeve lengths. Perhaps they are anticipating a chilly spring/summer season, hence why so many sleeves extended beyond the wrists and over the knuckles for maximum coverage. We saw such drapery at Roksanda, Victoria Beckham and Margaret Howell to name a few. Meanwhile, Erdem rolled his sleeves so far down this season that the hands of his models were erased entirely.\n\nCowboy boots were another unexpected trend, both on and off the runway. At Christopher Kane we saw them re-imagined with colourful circular patterns, creating an artistic effect. But the classic Western versions proved just as popular among the street style set, who wore their boots underneath pleated skirts and floral tea dresses.\n\nExtinction Rebellion made their voices heard\n\nThe environmental activists, who called for London Fashion Week to be cancelled earlier this summer, began their protesting activities by gluing themselves to the doors of the British Fashion Council\u2019s main show space and pouring fake blood on the pavement. It was quite the statement, one intended to represent the consequences of the industry\u2019s carbon footprint.\n\nThe group continued to protest \u2013 or \u201cswarm\u201d, as they call it \u2013 over the course of the weekend, culminating in a funeral march due to take place on Tuesday afternoon to \u201cshow the industry that enough is enough\u201d.\n\nNotable absences on the line-up raised questions\n\nThis season, fashion fans were disappointed to learn that popular designers including Vivienne Westwood, Shrimps and Ashley Williams, would not feature on the schedule.\n\nSome guests questioned whether their absences were a sign of difficult times, perhaps prompted by anxieties about Brexit or the financial demands that a Fashion Week slot requires.\n\nThe absence of Westwood was particularly noticeable given last season\u2019s spectacle, which featured a lineup of activists (including actor Rose McGowan) protesting about capitalism and Brexit on the catwalk. It was a shame, then, to receive nothing but an email this season about the avant-garde designer\u2019s \u201cdigital launch\u201d for spring/summer 2020. Titled \u201cNo Man\u2019s Land\u201d, the collection is once again focused on tackling social, political and environmental issues.\n\nA statement from the brand suggested that the lack of a catwalk show might have something to do with our \u201crotten financial system\u201d, and directed fans to Westwood\u2019s website to see the new collection.\n\n\u201cWe are using this as an opportunity to show our best clothes,\u201d the statement continued, \u201cthe future is quality not quantity. Less is more sustainable.\u201d", "description": "After a long weekend of sartorial razzmatazz, London Fashion Week has drawn to a close.
