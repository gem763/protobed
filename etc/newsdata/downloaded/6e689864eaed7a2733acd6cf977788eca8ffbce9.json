One month after the Journal report, President Trump tweeted that the U.S. would not grant Apple tariff exemptions, saying, \u201cMake [Mac Pros] in the USA, no Tariffs!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said Friday it would grant tariff exemptions for partially assembled main circuit boards and graphics cards, which contain expensive chips from Intel, Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices. Apple is using Intel\u2019s Xeon processor in the new computer.\n\n\"We believe deeply in the power of American innovation.\" Apple CEO Tim Cook\n\nApple rolled out the redesigned Mac Pro at its Worldwide Developers Conference in June, and it is expected to go on sale this fall. Production in Austin will begin soon, the company said.\n\n\u201cWe believe deeply in the power of American innovation,\u201d Cook continued. \u201cThat\u2019s why every Apple product is designed and engineered in the US, and made up of parts from 36 states, supporting 450,000 jobs with US suppliers, and we\u2019re going to continue growing here.\u201d\n\nPrices for the new Mac Pro start at $5,999. The computers tend to be used for music and video production.\n\nThe announcement is more good news for Austin, which has the most Apple employees of any U.S. location outside its headquarters in Cupertino, California \u2013 6,200 as of December 2018. The company said in December it is spending $1 billion on a new North Austin campus for 5,000 more employees, with the capacity to expand to 15,000 workers.\n\n\u201cMore than a dozen\u201d U.S. companies in eight states -- Arizona, Maine, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas and Vermont -- will supply Mac Pro components, according to Apple, and the value of U.S.-made parts is jumping 2.5 times compared to previous models.\n\nAt a dinner in August, Cook made a \u201cvery compelling argument\u201d that U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports are hurting American companies like Apple, but not its South Korean competitor Samsung, Trump said at the time.\n\nA new round of tariffs will go into effect Oct. 15, and more tariffs will hit Dec. 15.\n\nTicker Security Last Change %Chg AAPL APPLE INC. 218.84 +1.11 +0.51%\n\nAustin Mayor Steve Adler told FOX Business' Stuart Varney that the city offered Apple no tax incentives.\n\nTexas Gov.
