Wednesday: Bloomberg revealed that President DONALD TRUMP urged then-Secretary of State REX TILLERSON to help one of Giuliani\u2019s clients. Today: Two of the men who worked with Rudy on Ukraine were indicted.\n\n-- TURKEY -- a NATO ally -- has essentially gone rogue in the Middle East, invading Syria to fight the Kurds, ignoring the dire warnings of U.S. policymakers and the U.S. military. TRUMP\u2019S response to the Kurds, which helped America battle ISIS for years: Fend for yourself. Veteran Rep. John Shimkus (R-Ill.) says he\u2019s no longer supporting Trump after he abandoned the Kurds. Shimkus is not running for reelection\n\n-- DEMOCRATS are moving steadily toward impeachment.\n\n-- CHINA is in town for trade negotiations, and it\u2019s far from clear a deal will be reached in this round.\n\n-- HIS POLL NUMBERS ARE TANKING, and he\u2019s lashing out at the professional pollsters at Fox News. (See FiveThirtyEight\u2019s presidential approval tracker.)\n\nBREAKING IT ALL DOWN:\n\n-- RUDY\u2019S MESS: WSJ: \u201cTwo Foreign-Born Men Who Helped Giuliani on Ukraine Arrested on Campaign-Finance Charges,\u201d by Aruna Viswanatha, Rebecca Ballhaus and Sadie Gurman: \u201cTwo foreign-born donors to a pro- Trump fundraising committee who helped Rudy Giuliani\u2019s efforts to investigate Democrat Joe Biden were arrested late Wednesday on criminal charges of violating campaign finance rules and are expected to appear in court on Thursday, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\n\u201cLev Parnas and Igor Fruman, two Florida businessmen, have been under investigation by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan, and are expected to appear in federal court in Virginia later on Thursday, the people said. The men\u2019s nationalities was unclear, though both were believed to have been born in former Soviet republics. \u2026 The exact nature of the charges couldn\u2019t immediately be determined.\u201d WSJ \u2026 The indictment\n\n-- ANOTHER D.C. ANGLE: The indictment says Parnas and Fruman committed to raising $20,000 or more in 2018 for a \u201cthen-sitting U.S. Congressman,\u201d whom they also sought help in removing the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. Fruman also donated $2,700 to this congressman, and gave in Parnas\u2019 name. Fruman and Parnas both donated to former Dallas-area GOP Rep. Pete Sessions, who is trying to mount a comeback bid in a Waco-based district.\n\n-- ANDREW DESIDERIO (@desiderioDC): \u201cBREAKING: House impeachment investigators have subpoenaed Giuliani associates Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman.\u201d The letter \u2026 They probably won\u2019t come, and will say they are under indictment.\n\n-- DO YOU WONDER WHY so few Hill Republicans are defending the president? Because they don\u2019t know what is coming -- ever. This episode is a perfect example.\n\nANOTHER BIG WSJ SCOOP -- \u201cWhite House Shifted Authority Over Ukraine Aid Amid Legal Concerns,\u201d by Andrew Duehren and Gordon Lubold: \u201cThe White House gave a politically appointed official the authority to keep aid to Ukraine on hold after career budget staff members questioned the legality of delaying the funds, according to people familiar with the matter, a shift that House Democrats are probing in their impeachment inquiry. \u2026\n\n\u201cWhile career civil servants put an initial hold on the aid, Michael Duffey, associate director of national security programs in OMB, was given the authority for continuing to keep the aid on hold after the career staff began raising their concerns to political officials at OMB, according to the people familiar with the matter. Mr. Duffey also began overseeing the process for approving and releasing funds, called apportionment, for other foreign aid and defense accounts, according to a public document indicating the change.\u201d WSJ\n\nA message from The Coalition Against Socialized Medicine: Nancy Pelosi\u2019s drug pricing proposal would put foreign bureaucrats in control of Americans\u2019 medicine cabinet, lead to access restrictions for America\u2019s patients, and stifle innovation, threatening the cutting-edge treatments and cures of tomorrow.

They have been fighting forever. We have no soldiers or Military anywhere near the attack area. I am trying to end the ENDLESS WARS. Talking to both sides. Some want us to send tens of thousands of soldiers to....\u201d \u2026 \u201c....the area and start a new war all over again. Turkey is a member of NATO. Others say STAY OUT, let the Kurds fight their own battles (even with our financial help). I say hit Turkey very hard financially & with sanctions if they don\u2019t play by the rules!

Mr Pillsbury\u2019s comments to the FT came after he revealed on Fox Business that he had raised the issue of the Bidens during a visit to China a week ago. \u2026 Mr. Pillsbury declined to say whether he was asked to raise the issue by the president.\u201d FT\n\n-- SCHIFF THROWS SHADE \u2026 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE\u2019S TAL KOPAN: \u201cThe prominence of the impeachment inquiry has brought an outsized glare from Republicans. \u2026 [House Intel Chairman Adam] Schiff brushes off the attacks, saying [House Minority Leader Kevin] McCarthy has \u2018no independent judgment\u2019 outside of the president and that Trump is simply goading him out of desperation.\n\n\u201c\u2018I do my best to tune them out,\u2019 Schiff said. \u2018The president needs an adversary, and he would like nothing better than for me to engage him.\u2019\u201d SF Chronicle\n\n-- \u201cAnti-Trump group launches $1 million in swing-state impeachment ads,\u201d by Maggie Severns: \u201cThe Democratic-aligned digital group ACRONYM is launching a $1 million ad campaign in five swing states focused on impeaching President Donald Trump, answering a barrage of ads from Trump and allies condemning Democrats over the impeachment push.\n\n\u201cOfficials for the nonprofit described the $1 million campaign as a large-scale testing effort to see how to best persuade voters to support impeaching the president. \u2026 The campaign will begin in five states with 2020 electoral votes up for grabs: Arizona, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. But after the initial run, ACRONYM will consider expanding the spending into a bigger national campaign.\u201d POLITICO\n\nTRADE WARS -- THE PRESIDENT TWEETS at 9:49 a.m.: \u201cBig day of negotiations with China. They want to make a deal, but do I? I meet with the Vice Premier tomorrow at The White House.\u201d\n\n-- ADAM BEHSUDI on the CHINA DEAL: \u201cHow a U.S.-China trade deal could get more complicated\u201d: \u201cHuman rights sanctions and fallout from raging unrest in Hong Kong would have made a banner week for U.S.-China relations under any circumstances. Now throw in high-stakes trade negotiations as the two countries stand on the brink of another round of tariff escalation that could further rattle the global economy. \u2026\n\n\u201cIt's still unclear whether the two sides will be able to agree on confidence-building measures that would halt additional tariff escalation. The Chinese were hoping to get a reprieve on an Oct. 15 tariff increase, but one person close to the talks said that a delay is unlikely to happen based on what China has offered so far.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- \u201c\u2018An existential political risk\u2019: Trump manufactures a swing-state problem,\u201d by Ben White: \u201cDonald Trump shocked the world and won the White House in 2016 on bold promises to bring greatness back to the industrial Midwest. But his promise now faces a brutal reality: The U.S. manufacturing sector is spiraling into recession, victimized by Trump\u2019s trade wars and sagging confidence among corporate executives who have little idea how to plan for an uncertain economic future.\n\n\u201cUnless Trump can ram his revised North American Free Trade Agreement through Congress and cut a deal with the Chinese to erase historically high tariffs, he may find it difficult to repeat wins in states like Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania that drove him into office in 2016 by the narrowest of margins.\u201d POLITICO\n\nTHE LATEST ON HONG KONG -- \u201cApple, Google Pull Hong Kong Protest Apps After China Uproar,\u201d by WSJ\u2019s Tripp Mickle, Jeff Horwitz and Yoko Kubota: \u201cApple removed from its App Store a crowdsourced map service that allows Hong Kong protesters to track police activity, one day after the Chinese Communist Party-run People\u2019s Daily newspaper lashed out at the iPhone maker, calling the app \u2018toxic software.\u2019 \u2026\n\n\u201cSeparately, Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google unit removed from its Google Play store a mobile game that allowed players to role-play as a Hong Kong protester. \u2026 The swift removal of apps Beijing finds objectionable will likely help lower the two tech giants\u2019 risk of running afoul of the Chinese government and upsetting consumers in the country. But it could also subject them to criticism in the West that they are siding with Beijing in the contentious debate over Hong Kong\u2019s future.\u201d WSJ\n\nTHE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION -- \u201cFor the first time in decades, EPA is overhauling how communities must test for lead in water\u201d\n\nRIPPLE EFFECT -- \u201cParkland and Sante Fe schools disclose devastating after-effects of shootings,\u201d by Nicole Gaudiano: \u201cSubstance abuse and mental health problems surged following last year\u2019s deadly mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., while test scores tanked. More kids are said to be anxious, depressed and cutting school. In Santa Fe, Texas, where eight students and two teachers were killed in May of last year, it\u2019s a similar story, according to documents obtained by POLITICO.\n\n\u201cA growing number of students need support from mental health professionals, and more police and security officers have been called in to cope with increased student misconduct. The devastating turn in mental health, academic performance and substance abuse is revealed in a series of federal aid applications from these school districts. The documents paint the most detailed picture of what really happens to a school after a mass shooting.\u201d POLITICO\n\n2020 WATCH -- \u201cFor Bernie Sanders, His Most Trusted Adviser Is Married to Him,\u201d by NYT\u2019s Sydney Ember and Jonathan Martin in Burlington, Vt.: \u201cIt was [Jane] Sanders who provided a medical update after her husband was hospitalized in Las Vegas last week and had two stents inserted into an artery \u2014 issuing a statement and speaking to reporters outside the hospital. When doctors confirmed to her on Thursday that Mr. Sanders had suffered a heart attack, she said, it was her decision to wait until he was discharged the next day to release that information. \u2026\n\n\u201cMs. Sanders has played a central role in her husband\u2019s political life for decades, acting as his confidante and his closest adviser. Yet as Mr. Sanders weighs the future of his candidacy, never has it been clearer that the two of them are primarily making the calls for his campaign. \u2026 In a rare interview on Wednesday at their home in Burlington, Ms. Sanders said it would be \u2018egotistical\u2019 to call herself Mr. Sanders\u2019s top adviser but allowed that she was \u2018very much a close adviser.\u2019\u201d NYT\n\n-- \u201cPolitical Campaigns Know Where You\u2019ve Been. They\u2019re Tracking Your Phone,\u201d by WSJ\u2019s Sam Schechner, Emily Glazer and Patience Haggin: \u201cArmed with this data, campaigns can track down and segment potential voters based on apps they use and places they have been, including rallies, churches and gun clubs. In some cases, voters might see an ad on their mobile phone. In others, companies can match data to a specific person, allowing campaigns to determine who gets a fundraising call or a knock on the door.\n\n\u201cLast September, the campaign of then-Senate candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke was able to identify some attendees\u2019 mobile device ID numbers during a rally with musician Willie Nelson. A company collected the unique ID numbers of phones that pinged their location while at the event, according to people familiar with the Senate campaign. The company, working with an O\u2019Rourke campaign consulting firm, then matched some of those IDs with contact information, such as email addresses.\u201d WSJ\n\nTHE POLICY PRIMARY -- \u201cHow Cory Booker would help college athletes get paid,\u201d by Bianca Quilantan: \u201cThe New Jersey senator\u2019s plan builds on legislation recently passed in California, which will permit student athletes to receive payment for the use of their likenesses by 2023. In addition, Booker is in favor of closing the gender gap in college sports, giving student athletes more medical coverage and increasing federal funding for states to improve recreation facilities.\u201d POLITICO\n\nCLIMATE FILES -- \u201cThe world needs a massive carbon tax in just 10 years to limit climate change, IMF says,\u201d by WaPo\u2019s Chris Mooney and Andrew Freedman: \u201cA global agreement to make fossil fuel burning more expensive is urgent and the most efficient way of fighting climate change, an International Monetary Fund study found on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe group found that a global tax of $75 per ton by the year 2030 could limit the planet\u2019s warming to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), or roughly double what it is now. That would greatly increase the price of fossil fuel-based energy \u2014 especially from the burning of coal \u2014 but the economic disruption could be offset by routing the money raised straight back to citizens.\u201d WaPo \u2026 The report\n\nMEDIAWATCH -- \u201cHow A.G.
