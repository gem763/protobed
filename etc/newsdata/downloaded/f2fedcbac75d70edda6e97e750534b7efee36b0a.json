Children as young as 12 are suffering racist abuse from adversaries and spectators, according to an independent organisation that collates data on racism incidents.\n\n\u201cThe attention on racism in football has only been noted when it happens in Serie A or B,\u201d said Mauro Valeri, who leads the Observatory on Racism in Football. \u201cHowever, there are many episodes in the youth teams, especially among very young players. The issue is not considered to be a serious problem. But in reality, if you look at the quantity \u2013 in the last two years alone I\u2019ve registered about 80 episodes.\u201d\n\nFifa\u2019s president, Gianni Infantino, urged the Italian football authorities to punish racists on Sunday after a Serie A match was briefly suspended following complaints from the Fiorentina player Dalbert that he was the target of racist chants and monkey noises from Atalanta fans.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have racism in society or in football,\u201d Infantino said. \u201cIn Italy the situation hasn\u2019t improved and this is serious.\u201d\n\nRomelu Lukaku says \u2018we\u2019re going backwards\u2019 in fight against racism Read more\n\nDays earlier the Inter Milan coach, Antonio Conte, noted that racism in Italian football was getting \u201cworse and worse\u201d after Inter\u2019s Romelu Lukaku was subjected to abuse during a match against Cagliari. A high-profile pundit was then sacked after using the word \u201cbanana\u201d when describing Lukaku\u2019s play.\n\nValeri depends on local newspapers to track the prevalence of racism in youth football. In March, spectators yelled racist abuse at a 14-year-old goalkeeper, Eddie Gallinari, born in Italy to Ecuadorian-Italian parents, during a game between local sides in Savona, Liguria. The insults were heard by Gallinari\u2019s mother, Ana Montoya Vera, as she watched her son\u2019s team, Priamar, play Cairese.\n\n\u201cIt was very upsetting and it affected Eddie more at the time because he had just lost his grandad,\u201d said Montoya Vera. \u201cBut he is mature and we spoke about it and challenged it. The problem of racism has grown and if it\u2019s not dealt with adequately then the taunts could lead to something more serious, especially if it happens to a child who is not so strong.\u201d\n\nThe racists were never identified and while Cairese apologised, the club shirked responsibility for its fans.\n\nGallinari\u2019s case received more media coverage than usual following the intervention of Simone Valente, a parliamentarian with the Five Star Movement, who at the time was an under-secretary at the Ministry of Sport.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that the government condemns these acts immediately,\u201d said Valente, who was born in Savona. \u201cBut essentially, confronting racism needs to start in schools. Almost every week you read about a case at youth level, but even if it only happens once a year it\u2019s no different. Racism shouldn\u2019t exist at all.\u201d\n\nCagliari fined for fans throwing bottles but not racist abuse of Lukaku Read more\n\nAccording to guidelines from the Italian football federation, a referee can abandon a match if two warnings, given over the PA system, fail to stop racist chants. Players found guilty of racism face disqualification. But racism is most prevalent among fans, who are more difficult to identify and punish. Cagliari escaped punishment over the alleged abuse of Lukaku because the stadium chants were inaudible.\n\nThe issue is even more difficult to address in youth games as matches are played in stadiums that are not equipped with the technology to record the evidence. Valeri said racist abuse in the stands came from children and parents of rival players. He said it was not taken seriously as people denied they were being racist even when they used racist language.\n\n\u201cThose in positions of responsibility just say that words don\u2019t hurt,\u201d said Valeri. \u201cThe problem is very deep \u2026 Italy has never regarded itself as a multi-ethnic country, and while other countries have seriously addressed racism in football, Italy never has.\u201d", "description": "Youth players targeted with racist insults similar to high-profile Serie A stars, study finds", "authors": ["Angela Giuffrida"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1002702cf170e6582ce2ad6aad025e68080f247/0_214_3738_2243/master/3738.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8a6dde9f12f7a89e37a3f1ce639def60", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
