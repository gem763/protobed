Four years later, his government and Libya\u2019s capital, Tripoli, are under attack by Khalifa Hifter , a dual Libyan American citizen who leads a military force supported by Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and other U.S. allies, as well as Russia.\n\nThe Trump administration has been sending mixed messages about its Libya policy. Even though the State and Defense departments have consistently expressed support for the GNA, President Trump muddied the waters by taking a phone call with Hifter in April in the middle of Hifter\u2019s attack on Tripoli, reportedly at the behest of Trump\u2019s then-national security adviser John Bolton.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLast week, Sarraj traveled to the United Nations and gave a speech calling on the international community to uphold its obligations to support the internationally recognized government. He then came to Washington to try to figure out, for the sake of his country, how to navigate the U.S. capital in confusing times.\n\n\u201cIt is necessary for the U.S. administration to take the Libyan case seriously and cooperate with the U.N. mission to get something done,\u201d he told me in an interview. \u201cIf there is real will to support Libya\u2019s stability, I believe there is a good opportunity for a success story here that could benefit the U.S. administration.\u201d\n\nSarraj\u2019s pitch is threefold. First, he argues that the United States is already cooperating with the GNA on fighting terrorism, with demonstrable success. Second, he says U.S. companies could benefit significantly from opportunities in Libya\u2019s energy, infrastructure and security sectors, if the civil war with Hifter could only be stopped. Lastly, he warns that if America is absent, Libya could turn into a field for other nations to fight proxy wars akin to Syria.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPlus, Sarraj points out, the United States is the only country with any chance of persuading Arab states and Russia to cease fueling Hifter\u2019s war machine, which now includes Russian mercenaries fighting on the ground.\n\n\u201cWe ask the United States, if it believes in a political solution, to stop these countries from providing [Hifter] the money, the equipment and the weapons that has enabled him to continue this,\u201d he said.\n\nSome international leaders have called on Sarraj to re-engage with Hifter diplomatically, but the prime minister says he has already tried \u2014 and his efforts have proved futile. He says Libya\u2019s only chance for success relies on letting Libyans choose their leaders through the ballot box, not at the point of a gun.\n\nAD\n\nSen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) told me he spoke with Trump last month and urged him to drastically increase U.S. attention to the Libya crisis, in support of the GNA. Graham wants Trump to appoint a special envoy for Libya, just as Trump has done for North Korea, Syria and Iran, to focus and organize U.S. international leadership on the issue.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cLibya is strategically important to the United States for a variety of reasons,\u201d Graham told me. \u201cIf we don\u2019t turn Libya around now, we will have a second wave of refugees flowing into Europe, it will become the new Syria, a new safe haven for ISIS types and put a lot of pressure on our allies.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s engagement with Hifter was a mistake that is being overcome, Graham said, but there\u2019s no time to waste in returning the United States to a leadership role.\n\nAD\n\nObama, after leaving office, said his biggest mistake as president was not properly supporting Libya after the fall of Moammar Gaddafi to ensure Libya could succeed. Graham said Trump need not make the same error: \u201cIt is so sad that the Obama administration didn\u2019t follow up after Gaddafi, and it would be equally sad if the Trump administration doesn\u2019t seize the opportunity here to put Libya back together.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAside from finding itself under attack from a warlord, the GNA has many other problems \u2014 including competing militias and a lack of civil society. But it is doubtful that handing the country back to another authoritarian strongman would result in either stability or prosperity there.\n\n\u201cThere are common values that we have with the United States: democracy, peaceful transition of power, elections, the civil state,\u201d Sarraj said. \u201cBut we notice that when it comes to Libya, we see a double standard.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThis is not one of those foreign policy issues the United States can afford to ignore. The lesson of Libya is not that U.S. intervention is bad; the lesson is that when the United States leaves a vacuum, bad actors intervene.\n\nRead more from Josh Rogin\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.\n\nRead more:\n\nJosh Rogin: The Trump administration needs to clean up its Libya policy mess\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: Saudi Arabia\u2019s reckless prince fuels yet another civil war\n\nLetters: America is repeating Vietnam mistakes in Libya\n\nAD", "description": "When America leaves a vacuum, bad actors intervene", "authors": ["Josh Rogin", "Columnist Covering Foreign Policy", "National Security"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/6Go3qN2KmWBbWYTRp4U0uChABIU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NGQBNKHGFEI6TJXIQ5M4LR7WBA.jpg"}
