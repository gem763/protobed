Rodriguez posted a behind-the-scenes selfie of his fianc\u00e9 to Instagram on Saturday writing, \u201cThis woman\u2026\u201d\n\nLopez broke the Internet on Friday when she made a surprise appearance during the Versace runway show in Milan, wearing a recreation of her iconic green Grammys dress from 20 years ago. Lopez spoke to Vogue about how wearing the dress transformed her career.\n\n\u201cThat was a moment that captured people\u2019s imaginations, I think . . . in terms of my career, this dress really marked a moment in time,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if you don\u2019t know my music and you don\u2019t know my movies, people know about that moment and that dress. That was it.\u201d\n\nAnd to think it almost didn\u2019t happen. Back in April, Lopez shared the story behind behind the dress on her YouTube channel, saying that her stylist was pushing for a different option since the Versace gown had been worn on the red carpet before.\n\n\u201cUsually if you come to a fitting of mine, there are tons of dresses and tons of shoes. There's always so many choices. But this day we only really had a choice between two dresses. One was kind of like a white dress and the other was the Versace jungle-print dress,\u201d she said. \u201cI put on the green dress and come out and Benny [Medina] goes, \u2018That\u2019s it. That\u2019s it. Don\u2019t even talk about it. That\u2019s the dress.\u201d\n\nLuckily for us, and Google Images, that was it.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "Along with the rest of the world...", "authors": ["Erika Harwood"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Kr1RbslFwsUYyzw2J5dPjA--~B/aD03MjM7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/marie_claire_447/a72af935205f271f5071042ebce45544", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
