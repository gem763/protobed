REUTERS/Athit Perawongmetha\n\nThe chipmaker\u2019s shares rose 3.5% to $54.08 in extended trading.\n\nThe results came as a relief to the industry after dour forecasts from major chipmakers Texas Instruments Inc (TXN.O) and Xilinx Inc (XLNX.O) earlier this week.\n\nAfter years of acquisitions outside its core area of processing chips under previous leaders, Intel under Chief Executive Bob Swan has reined in spending, slowing investments in areas like memory chips and shedding struggling businesses.\n\nIntel, based in Santa Clara, California, has doubled down on its core markets such as personal computers and data centers, both of which beat analysts\u2019 third-quarter expectations.\n\nChief Financial Officer George Davis said Intel anticipated most of the year\u2019s data center spending would come in the second half because many customers bought chips in 2018 and took time to install them.\n\n\u201cData center came back much more strongly than even we anticipated this quarter,\u201d Davis said in an interview. \u201cCloud customers actually grew year over year, and last year was an extraordinary year.\u201d\n\nCascend Securities analyst Eric Ross said Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (2330.TW), which supplies some of Intel\u2019s rivals, had also forecast strong data center demand, suggesting a broader market recovery.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve finally seen another major semiconductor company that sees the data center returning as a major driver, as we\u2019ve seen in our measurements, and the electronics supply chain sees,\u201d he said.\n\nIntel has also been contending with a U.S.-China trade war that led to tariffs on its chips. About $200 million (\u00a3155.57 million) of Intel\u2019s third-quarter revenue came from Chinese data center owners purchasing chips sooner than they otherwise would have, likely out of trade concerns, Davis said.\n\nBut analyst Kinngai Chan of Summit Insights Group said he suspected much more of Intel\u2019s results were driven by sped-up buying because of tariffs and that could slow sales during the fourth quarter of 2019 and first quarter of 2020.\n\n\u201cWe think this could result in the supply chain inventory digestion\u201d as Intel\u2019s customers work through the chips they have bought, he said.\n\nIntel, which is racing against rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co to make smaller chips, said the move to the newer process, called 10-nanometer, was on track and it would have its next-generation, 7-nanometer, chips by 2021.\n\nSwan also said Intel was \u201cwell down the engineering path\u201d for even more advanced 5-nanometer chips.\n\nRevenue in Intel\u2019s client computing business, which caters to PC makers and is the biggest contributor to sales, fell 5% to $9.7 billion, but still beat FactSet estimates of $9.60 billion.\n\nDavis said revenue could have been higher but Intel was unable to make enough chips for entry-level PCs.\n\n\u201cDemand has just outstripped our ability to add capacity,\u201d Davis said. \u201cIn some ways it\u2019s a good problem to have, but anytime you can\u2019t satisfy your customers, that\u2019s not a good outcome.\u201d\n\nAsked by an analyst on a conference call whether Intel would consider turning to an outside foundry to make central processing units, or CPUs, to alleviate shortages, Swan noted that Intel had used outside suppliers in the past and would evaluate the option.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re investing to recapture process leadership going forward. At the same time, we\u2019re going to be extremely open-minded about, \u2018How do we ensure that we\u2019re building the best products?\u2019\u201d Swan said. \u201cWhere we build them is something that we\u2019ll always evaluate.\u201d\n\nRevenue from its higher-margin data center business rose 4% to $6.4 billion in the quarter, while analysts were expecting revenue of $5.62 billion, according to FactSet.\n\nIntel forecast fourth-quarter revenue of $19.2 billion, and adjusted earnings of $1.24 per share.\n\nAnalysts on average were expecting revenue of $18.82 billion and a profit of $1.21 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nFor the full year, the company expects revenue of $71 billion, up from its earlier forecast of $69.5 billion. That came in above analysts\u2019 estimate of $69.43 billion.\n\nIntel said net revenue was steady at $19.19 billion, beating estimates of $18.05 billion.\n\nExcluding items, the company earned $1.42 per share, above estimates of $1.24 per share.", "description": "Intel Corp on Thursday beat Wall Street estimates for third-quarter revenue and profit and raised its full-year revenue forecast, powered by sales to data centers and easing concerns about slowing demand during the U.S.-China trade war.", "authors": ["Munsif Vengattil", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444619309&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N1XP", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
