The series typically makes casting announcement by sharing images of three sticky notes arranged in a vertical column. The first one features the episode\u2019s date, the second one reveals the host\u2019s name, and the third designates the musical guest.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

The 10 best cold opens on Saturday Night Live Show all 10 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. The 10 best cold opens on Saturday Night Live 1/10 First presidential debate Before Alec Baldwin\u2019s Donald Trump, there was Will Ferrell\u2019s George W Bush. Ferrell\u2019s brashness as the then-presidential candidate, as well as Darrell Hammond\u2019s uncanny portrayal of Gore, are comedy gold. What\u2019s truly amazing, though, is that this skit seems to imply that Bush is too stupid to win the presidency \u2013 which he of course did, a month to the day after the sketch aired. Sounds familiar, right? 2/10 Sarah Palin and Hillary Clinton address the nation Tina Fey\u2019s portrayal of Sarah Palin made history for a reason \u2013 it was perfect in every way and could only be magnified by the addition of Amy Poehler as Hillary Clinton . Under the guise of presenting a nonpartisan message about the 2008 presidential campaign (the skit aired on 13 September, 2008, two months before Barack Obama\u2019s victory), Palin, who was John McCain\u2019s running mate, tries to pitch herself as the perfect candidate for the presidency. Poehler\u2019s Clinton, in turn, exclaims: \u201cNoooo mine!\u201d 3/10 The wolverines SNL\u2019s first skit was also one of its best. In this inaugural sketch, which aired on 11 October, 1975, John Belushi teams up with his fellow original cast member Michael O\u2019Donoghue to play a foreign man trying to learn English, only for his tutor to display an unsettling fixation on wolverines. Both apparently drop dead before a denim-clad Chevy Chase steps in to deliver the now-iconic line: \u201cLive from New York, it\u2019s Saturday night!\u201d Absurd, goofy and slightly odd, this sequence set the tone of the sketch show for decades to come. 4/10 Joint session In March 1991, George H W Bush addressed Congress on the end of the Gulf War, prompting several bouts of rapturous applause in the process. That moment, naturally, was spoofed on SNL that same month with Dana Carvey as a self-congratulatory president and Michael J Fox as his confused vice-president Dan Quayle, who struggles to clap at the right times. 5/10 Steve Martin does a musical Before Alec Baldwin took the record for most appearances as SNL host, Steve Martin held the honour despite never being a regular cast member. As you can see in this cold open, he just wasn\u2019t that bothered about joining full-time. The skit opens in his dressing room where he becomes nostalgic over his old King Tut costume. From there, he bursts into a Broadway-style performance reminisces about the good old days. 6/10 The Bush twins While Will Forte did an admirable impression of President George W Bush, it was Tina Fey and Amy Poehler who stole the show as the Bush twins, who communicate in a secret language by adding the letter \u201cb\u201d to everything. \u201cB-what b-about the b-weapons b-of b-mass b-destruction?!\u201d 7/10 Donald Trump, president-elect press conference He may have hated acting out Donald Trump's creepy, bizarre mannerism, but Alec Baldwin's portrayal of 45 won him an Emmy and plenty of acclaim. For good reason: Baldwin's version of Trump is so good it's actually rather unpleasant to watch. 8/10 Sean Spicer press conference Melissa McCarthy was a better Sean Spicer than Sean Spicer ever was. From the giant stick of gum to the low mutter of \u201coh boy\u201d before trying to read out the name of the leader from \u201ccentral Asia\u201d, she mastered every single tick the former White House Communications Director had. Arguably the best moment is \u201cSpicer\u201d raging at New York Times reporter, Glen. Trying to flog some of Ivanka Trump\u2019s jewellery comes a close second. 9/10 Democratic debate Before he drew acclaim for his portrayal of a pouting, tantrum-throwing Trump, Alec Baldwin nailed his impression of former US senator Jim Webb. He\u2019s not the highlight of this cold open, though. That honour goes to Larry David as Bernie Sanders, who is uncanny in his likeness of the presidential candidate. 10/10 Ford on the phone Chevy Chase\u2019s turn as a fumbling Gerald Ford made such an impact that the real president joined a subsequent episode of SNL on 17 April, 1976. In this 8 November, 1975 skit, Chase\u2019s Ford, while attempting to address the nation and comment on Ronald Reagan\u2019s announcement that he would run for president, presses a full glass of water against his ear instead of his phone handset, struggles to transfer a call, mishandles charts, and takes a momentous tumble over his own desk. Delightful. 1/10 First presidential debate Before Alec Baldwin\u2019s Donald Trump, there was Will Ferrell\u2019s George W Bush.
