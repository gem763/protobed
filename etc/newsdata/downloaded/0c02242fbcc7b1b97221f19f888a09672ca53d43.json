We can stretch the meaning to include illness and pain that we usually consider our enemies, but which might present us with some friendly opportunities to discover more about ourselves and our potential.\n\n\n\nHere are five reasons why illness should be considered our frenemy:\n\n\n\n1 Time, time and more time: As soon as we are sick, we are literally cut off from everything that keeps us busy \u2014 our jobs, offices, schools, colleges, and household chores, for example. It suddenly makes us realise that we have so much time at our disposal every day, when we do not have to go to work or school. The time can be utilised in many productive ways, most of all, reflecting on and prioritising our interests and how we can pursue them if we are determined to do so.\n\n\n\n2 Discipline: The first visit to the doctor that happens once you are sick and you are given a list of things you cannot do, eat or drink.\n\n\n\nOnce you have got that it becomes imperative for you to follow that, otherwise there are chances that you could remain sick for a longer time, just the thought of that gets you in line and suddenly, you become disciplined enough to do, eat or drink the right thing.\n\n\n\n3 Enhances compassion: Once you have tasted those bitter medicines, remained disciplined enough to only eat and drink as per the doctors\u2019 recommendation and felt the pain of being sick, you feel compassion towards other human beings who may suffer the same sickness as you. No amount of technology or training can teach a human to be compassionate towards other human beings but once you have fallen ill, you instantly become compassionate towards other human beings.\n\n\n\n4 Family ties: This one you have definitely experienced but never gave illness enough credit for having family members shower so much love on you while you\u2019re sick. Even your long-lost relatives and friends will call and check if you are fine and if you need anything to make you feel better. It really gets the immediate family members close to each other as everyone becomes a team and works towards one goal \u2014 making you get well soon.\n\n\n\n5 Teaches virtues: It teaches us virtues like love, courage, faith and hope. It ensures we love our caregivers with the same amount of love they have given to us; it teaches us to be courageous and fight this frenemy called illness, and it helps us keep faith in human beings and trust what the doctor says. Last but not the least is hope, we hope to get better from all that we eat, drink, people we talk to and doctors we meet.\n\n\n\nAnd here are five reasons why pain is also our frenemy:\n\n\n\n1 Every kind of physical pain you feel saves you from a bigger loss that you could face in terms of hurt and emotional trauma. Pain strengthens your spirit of endurance.\n\n\n\n2 Pain helps us realise that everything hurts so long as we are thinking of it. If we simply focus on the parts of our life or parts of our body that are not hurting at any given time, the pain is likely to be forgotten. Pain diminishes every time we divert our attention towards bigger things; this helps us focus on what we really want, rather than what is unnecessary.\n\n\n\n3 Pain like all other problems vanishes with time. What we are trying to learn here is that if we give enough time to anything that makes us feel uncomfortable, it passes on and vanishes like all our physical pains do.\n\n\n\n4 Once you become aware of others who are suffering more than you are, you will instantly become grateful not because of their misery but because you are fortunate to not be in their shoes and can hope that your pain, with time, shall pass.\n\n\n\n5 Pain teaches us endurance which can never be learnt otherwise, for the simple reason that you know you have pain and you are taking treatment for it but beyond a point, the control is not with you. The only option you have is to let time pass and endure the pa\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.speakingtree.in/a/749300-1350-420-5/know-your-frenemy.img", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
