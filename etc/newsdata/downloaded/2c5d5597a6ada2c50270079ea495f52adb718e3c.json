She studied why people came to her page by looking at affiliate link data: what her followers were clicking on, shopping for, and at what price points, she said.\n\nThe No. 1 item she would sell through affiliate links year-round was dresses, she said. After meeting with manufacturers and learning about sourcing fabric and design, she decided to launch her own collection.\n\nIt took years to complete, but in early 2018, Engel teased to her Instagram followers, who now number 1.1 million, that Gal Meets Glam had something big coming. Shortly after, in a blog post, Engel unveiled the \"Gal Meets Glam Collection,\" a dress collection that launched in April 2018 and releases limited products every few months.\n\n\"I wanted to have something bigger than myself for our readers,\" Engel told Business Insider.\n\nSince launching, Engel's collection has earned $35 million in revenue, she said.\n\nCourtesy of Gal Meets Glam\n\n'People would be buying the product anyway'\n\nEngel wasn't the first influencer to build a direct-to-consumer brand. Far from it, in fact.\n\nInfluencer-lead DTC brands first began popping up earnest in 2012, with companies like the fitness program, \"EmFitChallenge\"; the phone case company, Wildflower Cases; and the cold-press juice line, Suja, according to a recent report on the state of \"influencer-to-consumer\" brands by the influencer software company Mavrck.\n\nSince then, the space has exploded.\n\nThe No. 1 company doing this type of business is Glossier, which was founded by beauty blogger Emily Weiss. Weiss turned her blog into a $1 billion cosmetics and skincare company.\n\nIn its report, Mavrck ranked the top 25 influencer-led DTC brands. In second place was YouTube creator Jeffree Star's beauty line, Jeffree Star Cosmetics, which has earned $30 million in revenue, according to the report.\n\nEspecially in the fashion and beauty verticals, DTC products have proven to be a lucrative source of income, and a way for influencers to diversify their revenue streams.\n\nOf the top 25 brands in Mavrck's analysis, fashion made up 40% of them, with beauty in second at 36%, followed by fitness at 12%.\n\nAdam Wescott, a partner at Select Management Group \u2014 who manages YouTube creators like Eva Gutowski (mylifeaseva), with 10 million YouTube subscribers, and Lauren Riihimaki (LaurDIY), with 9 million subscribers \u2014 said DTC products are a trending revenue source for top creators in 2019.\n\n\"If you take something that their audience already recognizes them for, and then you add an original innovative product and formula that services a need, people would be buying the product anyways,\" Wescott told Business Insider in a previous interview.\n\nTurning followers into paying customers\n\nBefore launch, Engel teased her collection first to her Instagram followers, posting videos as a way to build buzz for the upcoming products.\n\nThe Gal Meets Glam Collection was set to launch independently on her personal site, Engel said. But Nordstrom, which Engel had previously worked with as a brand sponsor, reached out when it heard she was working on something.\n\n\"They had a huge buying team come in and check out the line,\" she said. \"They loved it, and wanted to be a part of our launch. This really catapulted us to have a much bigger launch than we have initially planned for, for our own site.\" (This February, Engel opened up the collection to other wholesale buyers besides Nordstrom.)\n\nTo transition her readers into customers, Engel also created private content for followers who signed up ahead of time via email, giving them inside access to the design process, she said.\n\nAnd the process of building buzz didn't stop when her line launched, she said. It's a constant process, a sentiment echoed by other industry insiders about DTC products from influencers, who often use a limited release strategy to sustain enthusiasm.\n\nHere are some techniques Engel uses to build awareness and anticipation:\n\nEngel shares each collection's \"look book\" the day before it launches with her followers, as a way for them bookmark the items on Instagram, and shop later when they come out.\n\nOn her personal Instagram, Engel gives her followers exclusive behind-the-scenes content, showing off elements like a look inside the design process.\n\nEngel's dresses are limited edition, and almost always sell out \"immediately after a launch,\" she said. She builds up anticipation on social media days before a collection drops.\n\nThrough years of working together on brand campaigns, Engel has built up strong partnerships with brands like Nordstrom. Nordstrom was the first stores to carry her products on its site, which helped Engel reach new customers, she said.\n\nEngel said she also purchases Facebook and Instagram ads to build awareness, but that the conversion of purchasers on organic posts is higher than paid ones.\n\nFor more on the business of influencers, according to YouTube and Instagram stars, check out these Business Insider Prime posts:", "description": "The \"influencer-to-consumer\" product business is exploding as Instagram and YouTube creators look to diversify their revenue streams.", "authors": ["Amanda Perelli"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db98c1bdee019462d2f2946?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
