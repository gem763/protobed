He wrote the lack of a deal with the season approaching was \"becoming a problem for the team,\" though Falcons owner Arthur Blank said Tuesday the new deal was \"very, very close,\" per Jeff Schultz of The Athletic.\n\nJones also told D. Orlando Ledbetter of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution his agent was in town Aug. 20 to discuss an extension with the team.\n\nThe Alabama product was under contract through 2020 on his previous deal and was set to make a base salary of $9.6 million in 2019 and approximately $11.4 million in 2020, per Spotrac.\n\nJones is still in his prime and has done nothing but produce for the Falcons since they drafted him.\n\nThe six-time Pro Bowler and two-time All-Pro is coming off a head-turning five-year stretch in which he made the Pro Bowl and tallied at least 1,400 receiving yards in each season. He also missed a mere three games during that span.\n\nJones posted 113 catches for 1,677 yards and eight touchdowns in 2018 and was also the go-to receiver during the 2016 season when the Falcons reached the Super Bowl. He finished with 1,409 receiving yards and six touchdown catches.\n\nHis 6'3\", 220-pound size and physicality make him a nearly impossible one-on-one matchup for defensive backs, and he can high-point passes, use his speed to beat defenders deep and routinely shed tacklers when he gets the ball.\n\nAtlanta made sure it locked up one of the best playmakers in the league, keeping Jones with the only NFL team he has known.", "description": "The  Atlanta Falcons  made  Julio Jones  a priority when they selected the wide receiver with the No. 6 pick in the 2011 draft, and they weren't going to change course after he greatly exceeded the already high expectations that were in place...", "authors": ["Scott Polacek"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/783/898/hi-res-092d7a37f76750012da461e3322bf7f0_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
