Published online every Friday morning, Washington Wire will feature exclusive interviews, insights and analysis spanning the Journal\u2019s coverage areas and will anchor the political coverage in Saturday\u2019s paper.\n\nCOULD IOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE SWITCH SPOTS? Iowa Democratic Party Chairman Troy Price is in New Hampshire trying to negotiate an agreement that might allow his state to offer some form of absentee voting as part of the presidential nominating caucuses in February.\n\nMail-in balloting may be on the table, but if Iowa\u2019s caucuses look too much like a primary, New Hampshire may threaten to jump ahead in the calendar. New Hampshire\u2019s Constitution requires it to hold the first presidential primary, so there\u2019s often some tension with Iowa\u2019s prized first-contest status.\n\nThe DNC wants Iowa to allow more people to participate in the caucuses, but security concerns have derailed a plan to allow telephone voting. The party\u2019s Rules and Bylaws Committee will discuss the situation Friday afternoon.\n\nERIC HOLDER says the Obama administration made mistakes in its immigration policies, but Democrats running for president shouldn\u2019t criticize President Obama directly for them. \u201cThat might result in some short-term attention, but I think it does long-term harm\u201d to the eventual nominee, the former attorney general told The Wall Street Journal.\n\nDisavowals by candidates like Cory Booker of the Obama administration\u2019s immigrant deportation policies should be put in the context of the Trump administration\u2019s actions. \u201cMistakes happened,\u201d which were then corrected, unlike the current administration\u2019s approach, Holder said.\n\nMIKE POMPEO returns to his home state for a speech at Kansas State University on Friday. The Republican won\u2019t be making any announcement about a Senate run there, according to a person close to him, but his presence in Kansas keeps the will-he-won\u2019t-he buzz alive. He has until the June filing deadline to decide.\n\nNames floated as possible successors as secretary of state include Stephen Biegun, President Trump\u2019s special envoy to North Korea, and David Hale, a career diplomat and the current undersecretary of state for political affairs, according to several people familiar with the discussions.\n\nTWO TOP WASHINGTON LOBBYISTS await the resolution of an investigation spun off from special counsel Robert Mueller \u2019s Russia probe. Prosecutors have been examining whether Republican Vin Weber and Democrat Tony Podesta violated lobbying disclosure laws in 2012. Their firms registered to lobby for a Ukrainian nonprofit group, though both lobbyists allegedly were told the client was actually the government of Ukraine. Weber\u2019s lawyer denied that account, and Podesta couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.\n\nA related trial that wrapped up this week shows that these cases are far from straightforward. Greg Craig, another lawyer who did work on the Ukraine campaign, was acquitted Wednesday on a false-statements charge after a two-week trial. After such a loss, prosecutors may not have an appetite for another prosecution related to the Ukraine work.\n\nRANSOMWARE is a big threat to the 2020 elections, a top National Security Agency official says. The new leader of the spy agency\u2019s cybersecurity directorate, Anne Neuberger, warns that hackers could lock up voter registration databases or other election systems and demand a ransom in return for restoring access to the files. Neuberger\u2019s new cybersecurity directorate formally launches in October.\n\nGUN OWNERS don\u2019t uniformly support the National Rifle Association, a recent WSJ/NBC News poll finds.\n\nCANDIDATES ON THE BUBBLE look to Latino congressional leaders for a boost. Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, Cory Booker and Juli\u00e1n Castro will make their case to the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute\u2019s annual conference on Monday, ahead of a crucial debate. Showing up and making allies is key, says Arizona Rep. Ruben Gallego, the group\u2019s chairman. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to get leadership support if you don\u2019t have relationships with communities across the country, or if you don\u2019t have a reputation for leading on these issues,\u201d he said.\n\nCELEBRITIES TURN OUT for Democratic presidential candidates. Actor Don Cheadle will co-host a fundraiser for Kamala Harris in Santa Monica, Calif., on Sept. 23. Comedian Russell Brand is featured in a fundraiser invite for self-help guru Marianne Williamson in Hollywood on Sept. 15.\n\nMINOR MEMOS: Mike Pence touts Irish bona fides in Dublin: \u201cI spent weeks cutting turf in the peat bogs.\u201d \u2026 Former Sen. Jeff Flake donates to local Democratic sheriff in Arizona, citing \u201cCounty over Party.\u201d \u2026 Cedar Rapids, Iowa, store sells T-shirts saying, \u201cHi, do you live here or are you running for president?\u201d\n\nWrite to Gabriel T.
