Instead, he claimed he felt obliged to warn the national party against making a huge mistake.\n\nHis intervention comes at a time when Corbyn is under increasing pressure from senior shadow cabinet members to agree to a second referendum before an election, with many of them arguing it is crucial to first get Brexit sorted. The party is trailing in the polls, with the Lib Dems appearing to attract pro-remain voters with their position in favour of revoking Brexit, while Labour continues to refuse to say which way it would campaign in a second referendum.\n\nThe mayor launched a fresh broadside at Labour\u2019s Brexit policy just three weeks after the party\u2019s autumn conference, at which delegates backed Corbyn\u2019s policy of fighting an election promising to negotiate a Labour-backed Brexit deal then putting that to a public vote.\n\nKhan said this position \u201cdoes not make sense\u201d as the party risked losing leave-backing voters to the Tories and Brexit party anyway, while seeing many remain voters go to the Lib Dems. But he also said it was wrong for Labour to be swayed by the argument that some of its heartlands are pro-Brexit, saying the party should take a lead in the same way it has tackled racism in society, championed the NHS and fought for women\u2019s rights.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sadiq Khan photographed at City Hall, 10 October 2019.

Let\u2019s not do it.\u2019\u201d\n\nAsked whether a second referendum should come before a general election, Khan said: \u201cAbsolutely. Let\u2019s resolve the issue of Brexit, give the British public a final say. Leave the EU on terms negotiated by the government or the option of remaining. Once that\u2019s been resolved, have a general election as soon as possible and we\u2019ve got such an exciting policy offer when it comes to the NHS, policing, schools, a Green New Deal.\u201d\n\nKhan\u2019s position mirrors that of Tom Watson, the Labour deputy leader, and Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, also revealed on Thursday she had concerns about an election before Brexit was settled. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, and Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, are also understood to have raised concerns this week that stumbling into a quick general election could be a \u201ctrap\u201d for Labour.\n\nHowever, Corbyn has so far repeatedly made clear that he will vote for an election as soon as no-deal Brexit is off the table.\n\nKhan said he was not necessarily worried about Labour trailing in the polls right now as they \u201cgo up and down\u201d and the party gained ground during the campaign in 2017. But he said he was concerned about the scale of movement to the Lib Dems over Brexit at the European elections.\n\nHe dismissed Corbyn\u2019s argument that the party should decide how to campaign only after Labour has negotiated its own Brexit deal, saying: \u201cThere is no Brexit that is better than remaining in the EU.\u201d\n\nKhan, who is up for re-election in May next year, said he had told Corbyn many times his own position and he believed there was further scope for the party to shift on its Brexit policy.\n\nAs well as the Tory candidate Shaun Bailey and the Lib Dem Siobhan Benita, Khan is facing the independent candidacy of the former Tory MP Rory Stewart. But he said he was also not concerned about the newcomer to the race, who has made a name for himself doing a series of walks throughout the country talking to voters.\n\n\u201cI walk all the time. What I don\u2019t do is walk around London with an iPhone filming my walk,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd what I don\u2019t do is treat Londoners like natives. We aren\u2019t natives. We are people who enjoy walking around our city, whether it\u2019s drinking in pubs, eating in cafes, eating in restaurants without being filmed. We don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything unique about that.\u201d\n\nHe said he looked forward to debating with Stewart if he was still a candidate in six months\u2019 time.\n\nOn climate emergency protesters Extinction Rebellion, who are halfway through their promised two-week period of action in central London, he said he feared they risked losing public sympathy .\n\n\u201cAs somebody who is sympathetic to the cause, you\u2019re in danger of losing public opinion. There is a tipping point where your actions can lead to people rather than being sympathetic to having animosity towards you. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a real dilemma. That\u2019s why the way to win over public opinion and keep it is protest lawfully and peacefully.\u201d\n\nAsked if Extinction Rebellion had reached that tipping point, he said: \u201cI\u2019m not sure of the answer ... but as somebody sympathetic to the issue I do worry about public opinion not being won over but being lost.\u201d", "description": "Exclusive: London mayor says party should back remain to outflank Lib Dems", "authors": ["Rowena Mason", "Kate Proctor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f612b28b3febfb487440d6afd81a201de25d2e24/212_134_5448_3268/master/5448.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bb3e774223bee65409fb483ba13a6bf5", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
