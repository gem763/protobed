The Boston Celtics forward has famously been at odds with the authoritarian regime in his home country of Turkey \u2014 to the point of apparent personal peril \u2014 and his tweets were interpreted by many as reactions to James.\n\nWow dude! \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \u2014 Enes Kanter (@EnesKanter) October 15, 2019\n\nSMH \u2014 Enes Kanter (@EnesKanter) October 15, 2019\n\nThat suspicion only grew when Kanter posted a list of setbacks suffered since he earned the enmity of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan by becoming a follower of Fethullah Gulen, a cleric and prominent critic of Erdogan who has been living in self-imposed exile in the United States. The Turkish government has described Gulen as the leader of a cult and a terrorist group who was behind a failed coup attempt in 2016, and it has reportedly issued a warrant for the arrest of Kanter, who has become fearful of traveling outside of the U.S.\n\nKanter\u2019s claims of fallout from his opposition to Erdogan included the following:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t seen or talked to my family 5 years\u201d\n\n\u201cJailed my dad\u201d\n\n\u201cMy siblings can\u2019t find jobs\u201d\n\n\u201cRevoked my passport\u201d\n\n\u201cInternational arrest warrant\u201d\n\n\u201cMy family can\u2019t leave the country\u201d\n\n\u201cGot Death Threats everyday\u201d\n\n\u201cGot attacked, harassed\u201d\n\n\u201cTried to kidnap me in Indonesia\u201d\n\nHe ended that tweet by declaring, \u201cFREEDOM IS NOT FREE.\u201d\n\nKanter, 27, did not spell out why he made his comments on Twitter, but the hundreds of replies to his list were filled with messages of admiration for his courage. Some took a more snarky route, wryly chastising Kanter for not expressing enough consideration for a certain other NBA player\u2019s \u201cdifficult week.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, James received a noteworthy amount of scorn for his tweets. Here is a sampling:\n\nLet me clear up your tweet: You are upset that the tweet might cost you and the NBA money, and that's all that should be considered when making an opinion about human rights in Hong Kong and for the Muslim Uighurs in Chinese camps right now.\n\n\n\nThe actual substance is for losers. \u2014 Josh Jordan (@NumbersMuncher) October 15, 2019\n\nI promise this guy's week was worse. pic.twitter.com/t1AcO4kE3p \u2014 Going Deep Radio (@GoingDeepLou) October 15, 2019\n\nJames was reminded online of this tweet he posted last year, one that seemed to some to indicate that he was not practicing Monday what he had preached:\n\n-Injustice Anywhere Is A Threat To Justice Everywhere- Our Lives Begin To End The Day We Become Silent About Things That Matter- #ThankYouMLK50 \u2014 LeBron James (@KingJames) January 15, 2018\n\nIn his comments to reporters, James said of his reticence over the past week to speak out on the NBA\u2019s balancing act with regard to China, Hong Kong and issues of free speech, \u201cI think when we talk about the political side, I think it\u2019s a very delicate situation. \u2026 I felt like with this particular situation, it was something that not only was I not informed enough about, I just felt like it was something that not only myself or my teammates or the organization had enough information to talk about it at that point in time. And we still feel the same way.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo judge from the reaction online Monday, more than a few were of the opinion that James should have continued to not \u201ctalk about it,\u201d rather than commit an unforced error by throwing Morey under the bus while failing to apply to China \u2014 and its lucrative market \u2014 the same passion for social justice he has occasionally brought to comments on domestic events. Add in Kanter\u2019s tweets, and the Lakers-Celtics rivalry may have just taken on a new dimension of geopolitical significance.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "James comments on Daryl Morey\u2019s tweet about Hong Kong and his own tweets about having \u201ca difficult week\u201d in China set off a torrent of criticism, while Kanter tweeted about his struggles with Turkey's authoritarian regime.", "authors": ["Des Bieler", "Sports Reporter Covering National Topics", "Including Fantasy Football", "As Well As Supporting Coverage Of D.C.-Area Teams"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/cXXOwqba9ofHxWlgYVVPkJjQMYM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UEGYKYISFJHENAIFDBNBH7TNDI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
