He said they will see how far the government listens to their demands.\n\nEarlier today, Defence Minister Pervez Khattak said the government is not mulling over the option to call in the military in the federal capital Islamabad in view of the upcoming protests of the opposition parties.\n\nWhile addressing a press conference alongside Federal Education Minister Shafqat Mahmood after a meeting of the committee, he rejected speculations regarding the government considering an option to summon the military troops in Islamabad to deal with the forthcoming \u2018Azadi March\u2019 announced by the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam Fazl (JUI-F) supremo Maulana Fazlur Rehman.\n\n\u201cThere is no need to call military here nor the government is considering it. The reports are baseless and it seems that an agenda designed by the anti-Pakistan elements are being followed. I am sure that Maulana will not fulfil the agenda of someone else.\u201d\n\nPervez Khattak also said \u201cI am requesting all opposition parties to talks to us. Anarchy will be spread if the parties don\u2019t bring forward their demands and it will be held responsible. If you will not talk to us then we will definitely perform our duties.\u201d\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "", "authors": ["Web Desk"], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/JUI-contact.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
