It's quite an uncreative hack, really.\"\n\nBut not to worry, she took to Instagram to share how she gave herself a baby bump before her Jetstar flight.\n\nThe first step in the process, Andrews explained, is to start with a stretchy first layer. This is a crucial step to ensure your belongings stay close to your body and in place. Next, bundle up your heaviest objects inside a sweater or shirt \u2014 silk works best, she said \u2014 and stuff it inside your tight layer. Then, layer up in skinny jeans, an oversized sweater, and a jacket to hide any little misplaced bumps.\n\nFinally, head off to the airport and hope you don\u2019t get caught. After weighing your bags head to the bathroom and re-pack your luggage.\n\nThe technique almost worked out for her too.\n\nHowever, Andrews told People, she happened to be the very last person to board the flight, which meant \u201cthe staff was all paying me attention.\u201d\n\n\u201cCollectively, they weighed my bag, and with smiles gave me the all-clear. But as I walked down the gangway, I dropped my ticket and made a noise. So they all looked at me again,\u201d she said. \u201cAs I bent over to pick up the ticket, the shape of my laptop down my back suddenly became apparent.\u201d\n\nSadly, the jig was up and the staff forced her to pay the baggage fee.\n\nA spokesperson for Jetstar told Fox News, \u201cWhile we appreciate the creativity, our team [is] pretty wise to all the tricks...most of our customers find it more comfortable to pay a little bit more for an extra 3 kilos [nearly 7 pounds] of carry-on.\u201d\n\nStill, Andrews thought it was a pretty good trick.\n\n\"Was I embarrassed? Not at all,\" Andrews told CNN Travel. \"I felt like a badass. A hot pregnant badass.\"\n\nWant to avoid paying baggage fees without having to fake a five-month pregnancy?
