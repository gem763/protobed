An autopsy found he had suffered an accidental overdose of fentanyl, cocaine and alcohol.\n\n\"It has become increasingly common for us to see drug dealers peddling counterfeit pharmaceuticals made with fentanyl. As a consequence, fentanyl is now the No. 1 cause of overdose deaths in the United States,\" U.S. Attorney Nick Hanna said in announcing the federal grand jury indictment.\n\n\"These defendants allegedly continued to sell narcotics after Mr. McCormick\u2019s death with full knowledge of the risks their products posed to human life,\" Hanna said.\n\nCameron James Pettit, 28, Stephen Andrew Walter, 46, and Ryan Michael Reavis, 36, had each already been arrested separately on drug charges over the past month and are being held in federal custody.\n\nThe indictment, handed down by a U.S. District Court grand jury in Los Angeles, accused them of conspiring to distribute the fentanyl-laced pills. Walter is also charged with being a felon in possession of ammunition.\n\nWalter's lawyer could not immediately be reached for comment. It was unclear who was representing the other two defendants.\n\n\n\n\n\nCOUNTERFEIT PILLS\n\nAccording to court documents, Miller asked Pettit for 10 \"blues\" - shorthand for oxycodone - as well as Xanax and cocaine, on the night of Sept. 4, 2018.\n\nBut prosecutors say the pills that Pettit gave him were counterfeit, containing fentanyl, a cheap, relatively easy-to-synthesize opioid painkiller 50 times more potent than heroin. Walter is accused of supplying the pills to Pettit, using Reavis as a courier.\n\nMiller was found unresponsive at his home on Sept. 7 and pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nPettit and Walter were scheduled for a post-indictment arraignment on Oct. 10. Reavis, who was taken into custody at his home in Lake Havasu, Arizona, will be sent to Southern California for further proceedings, prosecutors say.\n\nThe Pittsburgh-born Miller won a following as a teenager and topped the Billboard album charts with his 2011 debut album, \"Blue Slide Park.\" He was posthumously nominated for a Grammy for his final album, \"Swimming.\"\n\nMiller dated pop star Ariana Grande for two years before they split in May 2018 and she sings affectionately about him on her hit single \"thank u, next,\" using his given name, Malcolm.
