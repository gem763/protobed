Bundee is upright; you can see both his hands behind the shoulder blades of the player who is just starting to come up.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s all split-second stuff. So we live in hope, and we\u2019ll see what the judiciary decide.\n\n\u201cBut once it\u2019s a red card you sense a loss of control over what happens next, no matter what you try to present. We know it\u2019s a very hard line.\n\n\u201cI certainly feel for Bundee; he\u2019s pretty devastated that any further participation in the tournament is now at risk.\u201d\n\nAsked for his take on Jackson\u2019s pledge to help Aki avoid suspension, Schmidt continued: \u201cI think Steve was a good player himself, he\u2019s coached Super Rugby and for some time, he knows the game well.\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019d both be pretty disappointed if Bundee does get ruled out of the rest of the tournament on the back of that tackle. And I do genuinely say tackle, because that\u2019s what it was.\n\n\u201cBut there is a very hard line being taken and we\u2019ll just have to accept whatever decision is made by the judiciary.\u201d\n\nWhat happens on the field, stays on the field.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s the spirit of rugby \u2618\ufe0f\ud83e\udd1d\ud83c\uddfc\ud83c\uddf8#RWC2019 #IREvSAM #RWCFukuoka pic.twitter.com/BWRi9fyAZA \u2014 Rugby World Cup (@rugbyworldcup) October 12, 2019\n\nJohnny Sexton\u2019s two tries spearheaded Ireland\u2019s charge to the last eight, with captain Rory Best, Tadhg Furlong, Jordan Larmour, CJ Stander and Andrew Conway also crossing.\n\nIreland had to battle for almost 50 minutes a man light though, and Aki would be very fortunate not to see his tournament ended by suspension.\n\nSchmidt\u2019s men will face either New Zealand or South Africa in the last eight, next weekend in Tokyo. Ireland must wait for the conclusion of Scotland versus Japan on Sunday to discover their opponents.\n\nSamoa boss Jackson made an impassioned defence of Aki\u2019s future participation in the World Cup, and will now likely make representations at any World Rugby disciplinary hearing.\n\n\u201cLook, I don\u2019t know if I should really comment on it, but there were mitigating factors again,\u201d said Jackson, of Aki\u2019s red card.\n\nJoe Schmidt, pictured, is holding out hope that Bundee Aki will not be suspended for the rest of the World Cup (Adam Davy/PA)\n\n\u201cAs you all know it\u2019s the toss of a coin at the moment. I think Nic Berry refereed the game very well tonight.\n\n\u201cBundee is a great character, he doesn\u2019t go out there to do that tonight.\n\n\u201cHopefully the powers that be see some sense and he gets to continue on in the tournament.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a great kid and he deserves it as much as anyone.\n\n\u201cBut any contact with the head, people are being penalised. I hope no further sanction comes to him and I hope he can go further in the tournament.\n\nJohnny Sexton, right, celebrates with Andrew Porter, left, after scoring a try in Ireland\u00b4s bonus-point win over Samoa (Adam Davy/PA)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll do everything we can to make sure he gets on the field next week.\n\n\u201cUJ came onto the ball at pace and he only had two or three metres to make the decision on what type of tackle to make.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s being asked of defenders now. We all know that\u2019s extremely difficult, and so we wish him all the best.\u201d", "description": "Ireland thumped Samoa 47-5 in Fukuoka to book their place in the quarter-finals.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/15/wire-19628718-1570891747-920_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
