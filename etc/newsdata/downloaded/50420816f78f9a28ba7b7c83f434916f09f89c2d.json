He never woke up and probably never will, but the hospital has kept him alive for a year to maintain his ratings, a ProPublica report found\n\n'This is very disingenuous, right? It's very unethical,' one of the doctors in that April meeting said.\n\nThe answer, of course, was yes.\n\nWhen that meeting happened, in April 2019, it had already been about seven months since Darryl had had his heart transplant, on September 21, 2018.\n\nDarryl never woke up.\n\nHe was a vegetable from the day of his operation onward.\n\nFor months, his family members came and went, a ventilator breathed for Darryl at night, a feeding tube pumped liquefied nutrients into his stomach.\n\nThere was no meaningful change in his status, according to medical records obtained by ProPublica.\n\nWhat did change was Newark Beth Israel's rating as a transplant program.\n\nThe hospital which had once boasted being the state's premier facility for transplants was seeing poorer survival times.\n\nNewark Beth Israel's ratings have suffered in recent years and the administrators admitted that if Darryl did not survive a year after his transplant, it could cost them millions of dolalrs\n\nNot only do these ratings entice patients to a program, data on survival times is used to help federal government officials decide how much reimbursement transplant programs like Beth Israel's will receive from Medicare.\n\nAnd if their survival times continued to suffer, Beth Israel might have to call in an outside consultant for a sort of audit that could cost the hospital $2 million.\n\nSo, instead, the hospital shelled out the $3,100 a day it took to sustain Darryl in the intensive care unit for a year, according to ProPublica's estimates.\n\nBut that was worth it to protect the program's ratings, apparently, and Darryl wasn't the only patient caught in the twisted crossfire of the hospital and its government funding.\n\nA recording obtained by the publication caught Dr Zucker blatantly acknowledging what the department was doing.\n\n'This is a very, very unethical, immoral but unfortunately very practical solution, because the reality here is that you haven\u2019t saved anybody if your program gets shut down,' he said in a May meeting.\n\nFinally in July, hospital staff spoke to Andrea Young, Darryl's sister and medical proxy who makes weekly visits to the hospital from her home an hour away in Trenton, New Jersey, about the long term prospects for her brother.\n\nPhotographs show Darryl as a younger man and child. His sister said he loved life, and wonders whether he would want to be resuscitated or kept alive as he so far has been\n\nDarryl's sister and health proxy, Andrea, of Trenton, New Jersey, was not asked about her long term wishes for her brother until 10 months after his transplant surgery, she told ProPublica\n\nShe hadn't been given a reason to contemplate this question before - doctors had told her his brain was damaged, but could potentially heal, with time - and was unsure what she wanted.\n\nAndrea told Beth Israel to continue standard of care, for the time being, according to ProPublica.\n\nWhat she wanted, ultimately was for that decision to be up to Darryl, and perhaps for him to at least be returned to his own home before the end.\n\n'I want him to have the wind in his hair and the sun on his face,' she said.\n\n'I want him to be as comfortable as he can.'\n\nAs of one year after his transplant surgery, on September 21, 2019, Darryl was still alive, despite a fungal infection, and no signs that he has or will regain any more brain function.\n\nAnd Beth Israel still has its transplant program.\n\nIn November, a rule instructing Medicare not to consider outcome data in its funding decisions will go into effect, though these survival rate will still be reported.", "description": "Administrators at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center in New Jersey have kept Darryl Young, now 62, alive for year even though he's unlikely to ever awake from transplant surgery in order to maintain funding.", "authors": ["Natalie Rahhal Deputy Health Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/22/19314982-0-image-a-10_1570224014154.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
