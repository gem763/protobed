Though he had lost numerous friends and moneymaking opportunities after two arrests for soliciting sex from underage boys, Marrion Anderson and her son Arthur remained like family to Tilden. Arthur, in fact, was his tennis prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and had practiced with Tilden earlier that day before the Andersons were supposed to meet him for a going away dinner.\n\nWhen Tilden didn\u2019t show up on time, Arthur went to the apartment and found him laying lifeless across the bed, his suitcase packed and ready to go.\n\nBill Tilden, shown in 1930, was the first American man to win Wimbledon and took the U.S. Open title six straight times and seven overall.

But as they\u2019ve been passed down through Anderson\u2019s family, his stepson Gregg Guenther has decided it\u2019s time to share the what\u2019s left of the Tilden memorabilia with the world.\n\nThough Guenther has put three trophies Tilden won in the 1920s up at Heritage Auctions for bidding this week, other items including the suitcase with racquets and clothes packed up in it are in the process of being donated to the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, R.I.\n\nFEDERER'S FUTURE: Roger Federer will decide soon on his plans for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics\n\nFIRST TITLE: Just 15, Coco Gauff tops Ostapenko for 1st WTA singles title\n\n\u201cThis stuff needs to be out there seen,\" Guenther said. \"There\u2019s too many tennis people I know and have played with that really appreciate this stuff. Having it locked up in Burbank isn\u2019t going to help. I could keep it for another 20 years, but what does that do?\u201d\n\nFor hard-core tennis fans and historians, making these items public after so many years is a treasure trove of memorabilia that offers valuable insights into one of the towering sports legends of the 20th century.\n\nTilden officially won 10 Grand Slams, an achievement that isn\u2019t necessarily as appreciated today in the era of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. But tennis was much different in the 1920s. Only amateurs competed in the biggest tournaments, there wasn\u2019t a lucrative tour for professionals and travel overseas wasn\u2019t easy.\n\nTilden\u2019s dominance over that era, however, isn\u2019t in question. He was the first American man to win Wimbledon, took the U.S. Open title six straight times (seven overall) and, according to Bud Collins\u2019 History of Tennis, won 138 of the 192 tournaments he entered during his amateur career.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the most forgotten great athlete in American history, and it\u2019s really a sin,\u201d said Allen Hornblum, who authored the 2018 book American Colossus: Big Bill Tilden and the Creation of Modern Tennis. \u201cPeople have no idea how big of a force he was 100 years ago. He's the Babe Ruth of tennis. But he was bigger than Babe Ruth; Tilden was known all over the world and he was just an incredible majestic figure but he\u2019s been totally washed out from the sport's history book.\u201d\n\nThe erosion of Tilden\u2019s legacy is partly because he competed before the so-called Open Era, which started in 1968 when the Grand Slams allowed professionals to enter their tournaments. But it\u2019s also because of his complex and controversial personal history.\n\nTilden was flamboyant and stylish on the tennis court, and his homosexuality wasn\u2019t particularly a secret, even though it was a taboo topic at that time. But it\u2019s also well-established that Tilden engaged in inappropriate behavior with teenage boys, his sexual proclivities sending him into a self-destructive spiral later that resulted in a 1946 arrest and 7\u00bd-month jail sentence.\n\nThe American public was understandably shocked by those stories, and a humiliated Tilden faded from public view. After another arrest and jail stint in 1949, he emerged a broken man. And because of the cloud surrounding his name, it took decades until Tilden\u2019s accomplishments on the court were properly honored by the tennis community. Only recently, starting when Federer attempted to match Tilden\u2019s six straight U.S. Open titles in 2009 did the conversation about his place in tennis history begin to re-emerge.\n\n\u201cThere are still a lot of people who are fearful and want to stay at arm\u2019s length away from Tilden,\u201d Hornblum said.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Tilden was one reason why his possessions didn\u2019t see the light of day for many years. Some of his big trophies, in fact, were just ornaments in Anderson\u2019s home.\n\n\u201cWe displayed a 3\u00bd-foot U.S. Open trophy in our house. We had six Davis Cups sitting there,\u201d Guenther said. \u201cI had the thrill of seeing his Wimbledon gold medal, which I didn\u2019t even know what it was when I was 14 years old. We had quite an assortment, but nobody knows what they meant except for Art. We took them all for granted.\u201d\n\nIn the early 1990s, Guenther said, Anderson began to auction some of those trophies to help get Tilden\u2019s name back out in the public and rehabilitate his reputation. But a lot of his personal effects, including clothes, tennis racquets, a scrapbook with photographs and manuscripts of plays that Tilden wrote, were boxed up in a storage unit.\n\nAfter Guenther\u2019s half-brother died in November, giving him and his two living brothers possession of the items, he started contacting people who had written about Tilden to start making connections and determine an appropriate place for some of the memorabilia.\n\n\u201cI got an e-mail out of the blue from Gregg, and when I clicked on the photo and saw the suitcase it was like a \u2018holy crap\u2019 moment,\u201d said John Carvalho, a professor and associate director for journalism at Auburn University who has written multiple articles and research pieces on Tilden. \u201cIt was an iconic photo. I immediately got in touch with him and I was like, I imagine a museum want it something like that.\u201d\n\nBill Tilden was packing this suitcase when he died of an apparent heart attack in 1953. (Photo: Gregg Guenther)\n\nNicole Markham, who is the curator of collections for the museum in Newport, said the Hall of Fame has plenty of trophies and hardware to document Tilden\u2019s career but that the clothes he wore and the suitcase he had packed to go out on tour can help paint a more complete picture of his life.\n\n\u201cWe try to collect material that gives above and beyond to tell the fuller story of our Hall of Famers and significant players,\u201d Markham said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t expect to die, so that was his next phase as a teaching pro and working on these tours.\u201d\n\nSaid Guenther: \u201cThe suitcase has his sweater and some undergarments in it and some shorts and almost you can't touch them because they\u2019ll come apart. They\u2019ve been sitting there for 60 some years. But it\u2019s part of history and a big part if you ask me.\u201d\n\nThe three trophies that Guenther is auctioning this week through Heritage could also be of interest to some collectors. One is a silver pitcher from the 1924 Agawam Hunt doubles championship, another is a large sterling bowl from the same tournament\u2019s singles title with Tilden\u2019s name inscribed as the champion in 1922, 1924 and 1925. The third trophy is the Newport Casino Challenge Cup, which resembles the current U.S. Open trophy. Tilden won that tournament five times.\n\n\u201cI want to see it where somebody can appreciate it not where it\u2019s hidden,\u201d Guenther said. \u201cThose three trophies have been in our family the whole time since his death in 1953 and they\u2019re the last three available.\u201d", "description": "Bill Tilden, one of the first sporting icons, is largely forgotten because of having sexual contact with boys.
