Arizona is 5-1 in his starts since acquiring him from Miami on July 31.\n\n\u201cI took a look at the pitch count and I knew it probably wasn\u2019t going to be possible,\u201d Gallen said. \u201cI just tried to get it going as long as I could.\u201d\n\nGallen pitched seven hitless innings in the minor leagues earlier this season, but that was as close as he\u2019d ever been to a no-hitter.\n\n\u201cAnother night of outstanding pitching and it carried us throughout the entire night,\u201d Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo said. \u201cI was probably the most nervous guy in the stadium, because I was trying to figure out how I was going to take him out of a game if he had a certain pitch count.\u201d\n\nMarte\u2019s slam off Luis Perdomo set Gallen up for the victory and gave the surging Diamondbacks their ninth win in 10 games.\n\nMachado broke up Gallen\u2019s no-hitter with a line drive with one out in the seventh. Diamondbacks right fielder Jarrod Dyson set up as if he was going to try to throw out Machado at first base, but he bobbled the transfer.\n\nWith the Chicago Cubs idle Wednesday, the Diamondbacks moved within three games of the second NL wild card.\n\nCraig Stammen (7-7) took the loss after issuing two walks that turned into runs on Marte\u2019s slam, the second of his career. Starter Chris Paddack pitched 5 1/3 scoreless innings and allowed four hits with eight strikeouts.\n\n\u201cIt was a pitching matchup. He was getting guys out. I was getting guys out. It was just kind of who was going to fall first,\u201d Paddack said.\n\nWil Myers homered in the ninth, his 16th of the season, for the Padres\u2018 only run. The Padres got the tying run up to bat in the ninth, but Archie Bradley got Hunter Renfroe on a broken-bat ground out for his 12th save and stranded runners at second and third. San Diego had just three hits.\n\nBradley has converted eight straight save opportunities.\n\nGallen got out of potential trouble in the first inning with help from teammate Josh Rojas. With San Diego\u2019s Greg Garcia on third base after being hit by a pitch and advancing to third on a fielder\u2019s choice, Machado lined out to Rojas in left field. Rojas fired a strike to home plate to get Garcia trying to score.\n\nMarte took Perdomo into the seats in right field to break the scoreless tie. Marte joined Eduardo Escobar (33 home runs) as the first set of NL switch-hitting teammates to reach the 30-home run mark.\n\n\u201cI never thought I was going to have 30 homers,\u201d Marte said. \u201cI just feel good. I feel strong up there and I put my best swing and I\u2019m never looking for the homer.\u201d\n\nOOPS\n\nPadres second baseman Ty France lost his footing as a routine ground ball from Marte reached him in the first inning. France hit the dirt and Marte was awarded a base hit.\n\nIn the fourth, second baseman Wilmer Flores was given an error for dropping Machado\u2019s pop fly in shallow right field.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nPadres: LHP Adrian Morejon (shoulder impingement) isn\u2019t expected to return this season. He\u2019s been on the 10-day injured list since Aug. 8. \u2026 C Francisco Mejia is working his way back from a right oblique strain. He\u2019s been on the injured list since Aug. 30.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPadres: After Thursday\u2019s day off, the Padres send RHP Dinelson Lamet (2-3, 4.24 ERA) to the mound in the opener of three-game series Friday against the Colorado Rockies. Lamet has five or more strikeouts in all 10 of his starts this season.\n\nDiamondbacks: LHP Robbie Ray (12-7, 3.97 ERA) gets the ball at Cincinnati in the opener of a three-game series Friday. The Diamondbacks have six games remaining in the regular season against the Reds, with three more at home.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Even before Manny Machado singled into right field, Zac Gallen knew it wasn't his night to throw a no-hitter.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jose M.
