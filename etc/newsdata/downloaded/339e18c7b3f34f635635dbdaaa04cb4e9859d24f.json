Didn't like the clothes she was wearing. Too short, too revealing. That I was a crap parent, encouraging Meg to go out on Saturday night, the only reason Meg was going out was for sex.\"\n\nHe continued: \"She ranted at me for being a bad parent, calling me f****** useless. Called me limp and useless. Bit embarrassing - we have been having, I have been having, erectile dysfunction. I was not performing very well.\n\n\"Marie was at this point raging, absolutely raging, finger pointing, screaming.\n\n\"She then slapped me across the face.\"\n\nRichard Pratt QC, defending, asked Pomphret: \"Then what happened?\"\n\nPomphret replied: \"Er, I remember reaching out, grabbing her hood and ... I don't remember.\"\n\nMr Pratt asked: \"What's the next thing you remember?\"\n\n(Image: Liverpool Echo)\n\n(Image: Liverpool Echo)\n\nPomphret said: \"I was standing at the side of her body. There was blood on my hands and the crowbar. She was on the floor.\"\n\nThe accused told the jury he had no recollection of attacking his wife with the crowbar.\n\nMr Pratt continued: \"How did you feel, having seen her on the ground?\"\n\nPomphret replied: \"Awful. I had just killed my wife. I was just ... horrified.\"\n\nHe said he then panicked and \"stupidly\" decided to try to cover his tracks, burning his bloodied clothes and throwing the crowbar in a pond before returning home.\n\nDescribed as a \"quiet man\", Pomphret suffered abuse from his wife, who struggled with depression, was having treatment for cancer and had been diagnosed with an autistic personality disorder, the jury has heard.\n\nGiving evidence from the witness box on the sixth day of his trial, Pomphret, from Winwick, near Warrington, Cheshire, admits manslaughter but denies murder.\n\n(Image: Liverpool Echo)\n\nMr Pratt asked him: \"You accept, on the second of November last year, you battered your wife to death. How do you feel?\"\n\nPomphret replied: \"Er, terrible. I killed the woman I love. A horrible thing to do.\"\n\nThe couple met on Mrs Pomphret's 21st birthday and were \"happily married\" with one daughter, Megan, 18, but, over the course of their 22-year marriage, his wife's physical and mental health deteriorated, the jury heard.\n\nPomphret said his wife could go from being happy to depressed \"in minutes\" and become \"very angry, very quickly\".\n\nThe defendant said he and their daughter developed \"coping mechanisms\", removing themselves, or his wife, from a situation and deciding to \"let her rant.\"\n\nThe trial continues.", "description": "Liverpool Crown Court heard David Pomphret beat his 'volatile' wife over the head 30 times after she called their daughter a 'fat slag', called him 'limp and useless' and slapped him across the face", "authors": ["Pat Hurst", "Joseph Wilkes", "Image", "Liverpool Echo"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20531280.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Ann-Marie-Pomphret-murder.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
