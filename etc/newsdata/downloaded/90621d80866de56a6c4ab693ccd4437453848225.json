No woman should be compelled to touch male genitals against her will, irrespective of how the owner of the genitals identifies.\u201d\n\n(Image: Jessica Yaniv / Instagram)\n\nThe tribunal's decision noted that Yaniv had brought most of her 15 complaints against female workers who were from diverse ethnic backgrounds.\n\nIn some cases she had requested waxing of her arms and legs, and in five instances she had requested appointments for pubic hair waxing.\n\nThe decision said the businesses she approached did not provide male genitalia waxing services.\n\nThe decision also highlighted Yaniv's racial animosity both on social media and in her testimony.\n\nIn one tweet, she promised to \u201cexpose\u201d the \u201cbigotry\u201d of Indian women who would not serve her.\n\nIn other tweets, she railed against immigrants to Canada in general, claiming some: \"gawk and judge and aren't exactly the cleanest people.\"\n\nYaniv had brought over a dozen complaints in total, seeking damages in the region of $15,000 (\u00a311,600) each from several beauty salons.\n\nShe was ordered to pay $2,000 (\u00a31,200) to three of the women she complained about, one of whom was forced out of business as a result of the case.", "description": "Transgender activist Jessica Yaniv filed human rights complaints staff at beauty salons in Canada when they refused to wax her male genitalia", "authors": ["Talia Shadwell", "Michael Moran", "Image", "Jessica Yaniv", "Instagram"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20708352.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screen-Shot-2019-10-23-at-103925.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
