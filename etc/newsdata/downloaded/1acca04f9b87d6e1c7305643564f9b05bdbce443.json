You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIt\u2019s been hoarding cash and managed to reduce its debt pile by \u00a3469m to \u00a32.4bn over the six months to 27 July.\n\nThe bonuses paid to employee partners have been sharply reduced. That could be likened to a dividend cut at a shareholder owned plc. But grumbling employees are easier to deal with than the massed ranks of the City of London if you\u2019re straight with them, as this business tries to be. It helps that bosses feel the pain along with staff. They don\u2019t get millions of pounds worth of free shares when the business is stumbling.\n\nThere was more pain courtesy of the closure of the final salary pension scheme. But the funding hole was down during the first half and the measure has further served to enhance the financial flexibility of the business.\n\nWhat hasn\u2019t stopped is the partnership\u2019s investment in its people through training and the like. This is also good business and financially prudent. Recruitment is expensive. High staff turnover impedes productivity. One way of keeping it to a minimum is by investing them. Grocery business Waitrose more or less held its own too.\n\nHere\u2019s the rub: despite all that, the results continue to decline. Take out one off gains and the Partnership recorded a \u00a325.9m loss in the first part of the year compared to an \u00a3800,000 profit last time.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been in business for more than 100 years (155 in fact), and we intend to be in business for another 100\u201d, I was told. We\u2019re making sure the business is fit to cope with a retail market that is in the midst of a reset. When things pick up, we\u2019ll be ready to reap the benefits.\n\nTrouble is, what if they don\u2019t?\n\n\u201cShould the UK leave the EU without a deal, we expect the effect to be significant and it will not be possible to mitigate that impact,\u201d said Sir Charlie Mayfield, who chairs the business. If you don\u2019t believe the government\u2019s Operation Yellowhammer documents, believe retailers that know what they\u2019re talking about (Co-op has said much the same thing). It will be a car crash.\n\nThere is supposed to be a law to prevent that, but the deceitful Johnson government has been equivocal about complying with it and the EU may still say no to an extension.\n\nEven if it doesn\u2019t and shoppers start feeling confident enough to buy big ticket items again (the partnership says they too have been hoarding cash leading to a decline in sales at its department stores), the economic backdrop is set to remain uncomfortable at best. The shake up in retail, meanwhile, shows no sign of settling down.\n\nIt bears repeating that John Lewis, despite its difficulties, is in a position most UK retailers would envy. Because Lewis makes most of its money in the second half of the year, it should still turn an operating profit when the dust has settled.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

This car mightn\u2019t be in the fast lane but it\u2019s still on the road, still passing by the broken down wrecks of its rivals.\n\nThat\u2019s a good thing too. The presence on high streets of such a large, progressive-minded business that is owned by its staff and invests in them, is very welcome in modern Britain.\n\nBut new boss Sharon White faces a baptism of fire. That road is full of nasty looking potholes. Partners bonuses, at 3 per cent of salary, are at their lowest level for decades, and it doesn\u2019t look as if they\u2019ll pick up any time soon.
