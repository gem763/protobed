The group \u2014 which included conservative ringleader Jim Jordan of Ohio, top Trump ally Mark Meadows of North Carolina and Fox News fixture Matt Gaetz of Florida \u2014 stood in front of the cameras and talked to reporters for about 20 minutes to defend the president and take shots at Schiff and the Democrats.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201910/1769/1155968404_6093168535001_6093165840001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\n\u201cThis is not a fair process. We spent more time in the SCIF last time with Ambassador [Kurt] Volker than Adam Schiff did,\u201d Meadows told the large scrum of reporters. \u201cYou may have noticed that he came out here ... and what did he do? He gave this benign thing and then raced off to a fundraiser.\u201d\n\nMeadows and Jordan both belong to the conservative House Freedom Caucus, which is home to some of Trump\u2019s top allies on Capitol Hill. The duo has been active on Twitter and the cable news circuit defending Trump. Meadows said on Fox News that he agreed with Trump calling the impeachment inquiry an attempted \u201ccoup.\u201d\n\nAnd Jordan \u2014 the top Republican on the House Oversight Committee \u2014 has appeared alongside GOP leaders at recent press conferences and made back-to-back appearances on the Sunday news shows since Democrats formally launched their impeachment probe.\n\nThen there\u2019s third-term Rep. Lee Zeldin of New York, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, whose vigorous defenses of Trump have made their way on to the president\u2019s Twitter feed.\n\n\u201cThis is a kangaroo court. Because there has not been a vote to launch an impeachment inquiry. Because the minority does not have any rights for subpoenas. Because the president doesn\u2019t have the right to have counsel present to ask questions,\u201d Zeldin said Tuesday, as a smiling Meadows and Jordan looked on. \u201cThis entire thing is a political charade, is a clown show.\u201d\n\nAlso gathered at the impromptu press conference was Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.), a member of the Freedom Caucus, and Gaetz, a conservative firebrand who has caught Trump\u2019s eye as a frequent guest on Fox News.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just the rank-and-file members who are helping Trump. Top members of House GOP leadership have also taken on a prominent role leading the impeachment defense strategy.\n\nMinority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) are trying to shape the narrative to focus on process concerns and are backing a censure resolution to formally condemn Schiff. And despite some grumblings in the House GOP about McCarthy\u2019s rough performance on CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in late September, where he struggled to answer impeachment questions, Trump has heaped nothing but praise on the California Republican, who has also embraced Trump\u2019s heated rhetoric referring to impeachment as a \u201ccoup.\u201d\n\nAfter McCarthy fired off a letter calling on Speaker Nancy Pelosi to halt the impeachment probe until she answers questions about the process, Trump tweeted back: \u201cLeader McCarthy, we look forward to you soon becoming Speaker of the House. The Do Nothing Dems don\u2019t have a chance!\u201d\n\nAcross the Capitol, Sen. Lindsey Graham \u2013 who has emerged as a close Trump ally, despite some ups and downs \u2013 is also taking aggressive steps to defend the president. The South Carolina Republican on Tuesday even invited Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani to testify in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, essentially giving him a platform to air his unfounded allegations about the Biden family.\n\n\u201cI have heard on numerous occasions disturbing allegations by Rudy Giuliani about corruption in Ukraine and the many improprieties surrounding the firing of former Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin,\" Graham said in a statement. \u201cGiven the House of Representatives\u2019 behavior, it is time for the Senate to inquire about corruption and other improprieties involving Ukraine.\"\n\nKyle Cheney contributed to this story.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/6a/f2/38dd4217442d9b47e433ff03363a/191008-trump-congress-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
