Sometimes people present you with opportunities and no one tells you the potential backlash you could face in return.\u201d\n\nFans of the singer aired their disappointment online, with many calling Lovato\u2019s credibility as an activist into question.\n\n\u201cThis really disappointed me,\u201d one fan wrote. \u201cDemi really should educate herself better on the conflict between Israel and Palestine.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow does Demi call her self an \u2018activist\u2019 or whatever but not have a view point of Palestine and Israel,\u201d another added. \u201cI understand not knowing the situation in detail since it\u2019s very complex, but she\u2019s like \u2018oh, nobody told me about what\u2019s probably the biggest geographical and political conflict in the world.\u2019\u201d\n\nLovato went on to apologize in her post, while noting that many advised her not to speak out on the issue.\n\n\u201cNow I realize it hurt people and for that I\u2019m sorry,\u201d the Disney Channel alum continued. \u201cSorry I\u2019m not more educated, and sorry for thinking this trip was just a spiritual experience.\u201d\n\nShe concluded: \u201cI\u2019d rather get in trouble for being authentic to myself, than staying quiet to please other people. I love my fans, all of them, from all over.\u201d\n\nIn her original posts, Lovato recounted her experience visiting the Western Wall, the country\u2019s Holocaust memorial Yad Vashem, and the disability organization Shalva.\n\nBut she appeared to be most moved by her baptism in the Jordan River, writing that she\u2019s \u201cnever felt more renewed in my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis trip has been so important for my well-being, my heart and my soul,\u201d she wrote at the time. \u201cI\u2019m grateful for the memories made and the opportunity to be able to fill the God-sized hole in my heart. Thank you for having me Israel.\u201d", "description": "The singer said the vacation was a \u201cspiritual experience for me not a political statement\" in a now-deleted post.", "authors": ["Entertainment Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d95fe912100003c02f9ebb8.jpeg?cache=qfnmww0c2t&ops=1778_1000"}
