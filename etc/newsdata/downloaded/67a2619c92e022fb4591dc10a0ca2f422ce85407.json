Xiaomi has released a lot of phones that look and feel very similar this year, and frankly it\u2019s getting hard to keep up.\n\nAnother Xiaomi phone that I\u2019ve been using in recent weeks, the Mi 9T Pro, very much falls into that category. Nothing about its spec sheet particularly stands out even within Xiaomi\u2019s lineup, let alone the Chinese smartphone landscape at large. That I\u2019m only getting around to writing about it this week is down to quirks of Xiaomi\u2019s convoluted naming schemes and global release schedules. But I still think it\u2019s one of the most notable phones of the year.\n\nTo put the Mi 9T Pro into context, allow me to briefly explain the Mi 9 line. First off, the flagship Mi 9 and mid-range Mi 9 SE were announced in February. As is typical for Xiaomi, the Mi 9 paired high-end specs (Snapdragon 855, etc) with an affordable price (\u00a3499 / \u20ac449). I reviewed the Mi 9 when it came to Europe in April; it was good. Then in June, a cheaper \u20ac329 variant called the Mi 9T was also released in mainland Europe.\n\nThe Mi 9T, however, was a completely different phone. It had a slower Snapdragon 730 processor, a notchless display, a pop-up selfie camera, and an all-new design. All-new, that is, if you hadn\u2019t been paying attention to Indian phone launches the previous month, when the Redmi K20 and K20 Pro were announced. The Mi 9T is just a rebranded Redmi K20.\n\nNow here we are in the fall with the \u00a3399 Mi 9T Pro, which is a rebranded Redmi K20 Pro. Why Xiaomi didn\u2019t put this phone out earlier in the year is beyond me, but Europeans shouldn\u2019t sleep on it. It\u2019s even more flagship-like than the Mi 9, at an even lower price.\n\nA true $399 flagship\n\nThe Mi 9T Pro\u2019s spec sheet looks pretty standard if you\u2019re used to following Chinese phones, but drop this thing into an AT&T store and it\u2019d be as high-end as anything else. You\u2019ve got a Snapdragon 855 processor, notchless 6.4-inch OLED screen, in-display fingerprint sensor, pop-up selfie camera, 4,000mAh battery, and triple-rear cameras including a 48-megapixel primary unit alongside telephoto and ultrawide lenses. It\u2019s basically a OnePlus 7 Pro without the high refresh rate screen, except it starts at \u00a3399 instead of \u00a3699. (Conversions being what they are, US residents should think of this as a $399 phone.)\n\nWhat makes the Mi 9T Pro different to Xiaomi\u2019s other high-spec-low-cost endeavors \u2014 take last year\u2019s sub-$300 Pocophone F1, which crammed the fastest parts available into the cheapest body possible \u2014 is that it doesn\u2019t compromise on design. There are lots of neat flourishes here, from the tiny circle in the pop-up camera module that lights up when the phone is charging to the way the holographic rear panel shimmers in response to its surroundings.\n\nThe phone\u2019s price sparked some controversy in India\n\nNow, the Mi 9 remains a sleeker device in a few ways. It has a few flagship-esque touches, like wireless charging and a better haptic engine. It\u2019s also noticeably thinner, although it does have a smaller battery and omits the headphone jack. The design is certainly more understated, if that\u2019s your thing. Overall, though, the 9T Pro feels like a more balanced, capable phone for most people \u2014 not to mention a cheaper one.\n\nThe phone\u2019s price, however, actually sparked some controversy in India when it was released as the K20 Pro. Many Indian tech followers, who are often both very knowledgeable about phone specs and keen to get the best value possible, were disappointed in the K20 Pro\u2019s 27,999-rupee ($395) price point after expecting something more in line with the Pocophone F1. (The $7,000 gold version didn\u2019t help.)\n\nXiaomi found itself having to justify the price in an open letter to Indian fans, pointing out that its features don\u2019t come cheap. But given the Pocophone precedent, those who prioritize price-performance over everything else won\u2019t have been satisfied.\n\nIt's been 5 years in the making. And boy, we are proud of it! #RedmiK20 and #RedmiK20Pro are the Alpha Flagships, the best among the best!\n\n\n\nHere's an open letter from @manukumarjain to all you Mi fans who made this possible! #Xiaomi #FlagshipKiller pic.twitter.com/oDchPNGLqy \u2014 Redmi India for #MiFans (@RedmiIndia) July 18, 2019\n\nIn Europe, though, this is arguably the best-value flagship-class phone around \u2014 and I do call this a flagship-class phone. It\u2019d probably be a big deal in the less competitive US market, too, if Xiaomi had ever figured out how to sell phones there. If you\u2019re looking to buy a phone at around this price point, I can\u2019t think of a better option.\n\nXiaomi releases phones at such an intense pace and in such seemingly random locales that it\u2019s easy to ignore individual models and just think of the lineup as a collective hive mind devoted to being pretty good for whatever the price is. Sometimes, though, the company transcends the sweet spot and delivers something of really incredible value. The Mi 9T Pro, or K20 Pro, is one of those times.", "description": "Europeans shouldn\u2019t sleep on the Mi 9T Pro, also known as the Redmi K20 Pro.
