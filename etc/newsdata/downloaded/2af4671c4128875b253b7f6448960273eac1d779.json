Yovanovitch said she was \u201cincredulous\u201d at her removal, according to a copy of her opening statement obtained by The New York Times.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nYovanovitch\u2019s testimony itself was somewhat of a surprise. Many expected she would not appear after the White House said Tuesday it would not cooperate with the impeachment inquiry.\n\nBut Democrats subpoenaed for Yovanovitch\u2019s testimony, and the diplomat clearly wanted to tell her story.\n\nSeparately, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, said in a statement that he would testify next week. Sondland\u2019s testimony is likely to be friendlier to the White House, but it still has the potential to lead to some damage.\n\nDemocrats also want to talk to other figures in the Ukraine controversy, including diplomat William Taylor, who believed Trump wanted to withhold aid to Ukraine unless it launched an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenFederal prosecutors investigating Giuliani: report Trump lashes out at 2020 Dems, impeachment inquiry In marathon testimony, Dems see an ambassador scorned, while GOP defends Trump MORE.

The two men, both with ties to Eastern Europe, have been accused of violating campaign finance laws. They were arrested at Dulles International Airport near Washington, as they attempted to leave the country.\n\nThe steady stream of new developments has left Republicans wondering what more is still to come \u2014 a dynamic that has hampered the White House\u2019s efforts to marshal party support behind a coherent message.\n\n\u201cObviously there is a ton of bad [news] out there,\u201d said GOP strategist Liz Mair. \u201cIt is getting to be overwhelming. It is getting to the point where a lot of people are getting fed up.\u201d\n\nThe White House had come under criticism, even in Republican circles, for rotating through different justifications for the president\u2019s actions regarding Ukraine since details first emerged last month about a July 25 phone call between him and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nOn that call, Trump pressed Zelensky to open an investigation into Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiTrump lashes out at 2020 Dems, impeachment inquiry In marathon testimony, Dems see an ambassador scorned, while GOP defends Trump Trump accuses Pelosi of 'hating' US over impeachment inquiry MORE (D-Calif.) came out in favor of impeachment proceedings on Sep. 24 but it is only in the past week that the administration appears to have settled on a counter-message: that impeachment is not merely partisan but a de facto coup attempt against Trump.\n\nThe president has made this point in his tweets and it was reiterated in a letter to Pelosi and other top Democrats from White House counsel Pat Cipollone earlier this week.\n\nTrump aide Stephen Miller Stephen MillerTrump says acting Homeland Security chief McAleenan will step down Overnight Health Care \u2014 Presented by Coalition Against Surprise Medical Billing \u2014 Judge blocks Trump 'public charge' rule | Appeals court skeptical of Trump arguments for Medicaid work requirements | CDC offers guidance for treating vaping-related cases Cracks emerge in White House strategy as witness testifies MORE, during characteristically combative exchanges with reporters at the White House on Friday, complained about \u201cthe corruption of the permanent bureaucracy, also known as the Deep State\u201d and \u201cWashington Democrats that are engaged in this scam and witch hunt.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the day, Trump had decried the whistleblower complaint that set the current train of events in motion as \u201ca giant scam.\u201d In fact, the account of the phone call as presented by the whistleblower was confirmed by records released by the White House.\n\nThe spiraling crisis has had a significant effect on the president\u2019s standing in opinion polls. The president took umbrage at a Fox News poll released late Wednesday that showed 51 percent of voters favoring his impeachment and removal from office.\n\nTrump argued on Twitter the next day that, whoever Fox\u2019s pollster was, \u201cthey suck\u201d.\n\nBut there have been a number of polls from other organizations that have also shown public opinion shifting in favor of impeachment.\n\nSupport is higher for an impeachment inquiry now than it was in the wake of the publication of former special counsel Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) Swan MuellerFox News legal analyst says Trump call with Ukraine leader could be 'more serious' than what Mueller 'dragged up' Lewandowski says Mueller report was 'very clear' in proving 'there was no obstruction,' despite having 'never' read it Fox's Cavuto roasts Trump over criticism of network MORE\u2019s report into allegations of collusion with Russia.\n\nTrump allies are hoping they can apply lessons from the Mueller experience to their current predicament, however. Mueller came under sustained attack from Team Trump throughout his tenure, and there is some evidence that this eroded his standing with the public.\n\nIt is plausible that a similarly intense assault on Democrats over impeachment could have a comparable effect. If that occurs, the current opinion polls could represent a high-water mark in terms of support for impeachment.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut such an outcome is far from certain, especially if the drip, drip of bad headlines continues.\n\nSuch news \u201cbecomes an automatic, daily pushback of anything the White House is trying to do,\u201d said Doug Heye, a former communications director of the Republican National Committee.\n\nReferring to Trump\u2019s rally in Minneapolis on Thursday evening, Heye said, \u201cTrump said last night, \u2018Isn\u2019t it better when I go off-script?\u2019 Well, the reality is that all of these things guarantee that the administration stays off-script.\u201d\n\nAsked if the administration could get back on an even keel, Heye demurred.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they ever were on an even keel,\u201d he said, \u201cPart of that was by design. Disruption was always going to be a part of this presidency just as it was during the campaign \u2014 and ultimately the campaign was successful.\n\n\u201cThe challenge for them now is where this goes.\u201d\n\nThe Memo is a reported column by Niall Stanage, primarily focused on Donald Trump\u2019s presidency.", "description": "The drip, drip of revelations from the House Democratic impeachment probe of President Trump is continuing to create bad headlines for the White House.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_101119getty_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
