She was arrested at the hospital.\n\nThe Citizen Group for the Decriminalisation of Abortion (CDFA) says there was no proof that she tried to kill the child, and that she suffered a pregnancy-related complication.\n\nProsecutors want another attempt at putting her back behind bars over what they have branded \u201coverabundant\u201d proof of her criminal responsibility.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to consider her a victim of anything. On the contrary, the only victim is her son,\u201d they said in a statement.\n\nMiscarriages and stillbirths in El Salvador are often treated as suspected abortions, which have been legally regarded as murder since 1997.\n\nLegal cases against women who have experienced miscarriages and obstetric emergencies are forcefully pursued, with women who turn up at public hospitals after a miscarriage sometimes being accused of having killed the foetus.\n\nMs Hernandez called for women such as herself to stop being criminalised after being exonerated last month in the first retrial of an abortion case in the country's history.\n\n\u201cIt is shameful that they insist on criminally prosecuting a woman without evidence that she committed the crime,\u201d her defence lawyer, Bertha Maria Deleon, tweeted after prosecutors announced their appeal in the case.\n\nEl Salvador\u2019s top court overturned the original conviction in February \u2013 concluding the judge\u2019s decision was based on prejudice and insufficient evidence.", "description": "Prosecutors have announced they will appeal against the recent acquittal of a teenage rape victim in El Salvador who was convicted for murdering her child and jailed for nearly three years after a stillbirth.Evelyn Beatriz Hernandez was given a 30-year jail sentence in 2017 for aggravated murder by a", "authors": ["Maya Oppenheim"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/D4nhNUwm242m2qdc6Mikng--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/7a2004e6ecad6a532b922469f2c8e65e", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
