D\u2019Amico and McClure conspired to create a false story to obtain money from donors based on false information.\u201d\n\nThe three gained national media attention, and soon enough around $400,000 had been raised for Bobbitt via GoFundMe -- funds that the former couple said was going towards securing Bobbitt housing, according to prosecutors.\n\nInstead, D\u2019Amico and McClure spent the money on personal expenses over the three months, including significant amounts on gambling, vacations, a BMW automobile, clothing, handbags and other personal items and expenses, officials said.\n\nBobbitt sued the couple for not giving him the money, prompting authorities to investigate them.\n\nJose F. Moreno/The Philadelphia Inquirer via AP, FILE\n\nBobbitt and McClure have both pleaded guilty to federal and state crimes.\n\nMcClure faces four years in state prison and must help repay the $400,000, according to the Associated Press. Her federal sentencing is scheduled for November.\n\nBobbitt was sentenced to five years\u2019 probation in state court and agreed to help repay the money, the AP reported. His federal sentencing is scheduled for later this month.\n\nD\u2019Amico faces up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine on the wire fraud charge, while conspiracy to commit money laundering carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000. Prosecutors have said he was the ringleader of the group, according to the Associated Press.", "description": "Mark D'Amico is now facing federal charges for his role in a GoFundMe scam that raised $400,000.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/mark-damico-file-02-ap-jef-191004_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
