Netflix spent nearly $2 billion last year on advertising and, given its $15 billion annual spending on content, will be continuing to promote its wares aggressively. Technology writ large is a major category for the TV business, helping keep traditional networks\u2019 $75 billion annual ad haul intact despite headwinds from declining ratings to digital rivals of various kinds.\n\nMore from Deadline\n\nDisney is launching its own direct-to-consumer service, Disney+, on November 12. Apple will debut its subscription offering, Apple TV+, on November 1. WarnerMedia and NBCUniversal are readying major streaming outlets for launch next spring. In advance of launching Disney+, the parent company has begun pulling back content it had been licensing out to Netflix and other platforms. The first streaming window of Toy Story 4, Captain Marvel and other recent theatrical releases will be on Disney+ instead of Netflix.\n\nBroadcast networks have been awash in streaming ads lately, as Fox\u2019s broadcast of the Emmys last month vividly illustrated. While the overall number of scripted originals keeps climbing, the growth is being powered by streaming, with linear networks holding steady with their output. ABC has served as a launch pad for many streaming campaigns. Netflix\u2019s first ad for Martin Scorsese\u2019s The Irishman aired during this year\u2019s Oscar telecast.\n\n\u201cThe direct-to-consumer business has evolved, with many more entrants looking to advertise in traditional television, and across our portfolio of networks. While the initial decision was strictly advertising based, we reevaluated our strategy to reflect the comprehensive business relationships we have with many of these companies, as direct-to-consumer is one element.\u201d\n\nIn the tech sector, Apple and Amazon have also been tussling over competitive streaming initiatives. The Amazon Prime Video app disappeared from Apple\u2019s App Store, though that appears to be a technical glitch and not a strategic move, according to numerous reports Friday afternoon.\n\nThe friction over how streaming services are advertised on traditional TV recalls the era of cable programming rising to prominence a generation ago. There was a time when it was shocking to see ads for HBO\u2019s The Sopranos, for example, on broadcast networks, but today such placements are commonplace. Tech firms have become a major category in the $75 billion TV ad business, and Netflix has been a heavy spender on live events like the Super Bowl and ABC\u2019s telecasts of the Academy Awards.\n\nDisney had initially looked to ban all competitive ads, but then reversed course and agreed to accept ads for Apple TV+ and Amazon shows, but kept Netlfix on the no-fly list.\n\n\u201cThe direct-to-consumer business has evolved, with many more entrants looking to advertise in traditional television, and across our portfolio of networks,\u201d a Disney spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cWhile the initial decision was strictly advertising based, we reevaluated our strategy to reflect the comprehensive business relationships we have with many of these companies, as direct-to-consumer is one element.\u201d\n\nA Netflix rep declined to comment when contacted by Deadline.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported on the Disney ban.\n\nSign up for Deadline's Newsletter.
