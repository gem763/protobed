The technology can potentially be used to allow educators to download plans for things and print items to show their classes.\n\nImage: Smithsonian\n\n3D replicas are also available to view online, so even if you don\u2019t have a printer to make yourself a physical copy, you can get a better idea of what something might look like than you would from looking at a traditional photo.\n\nThe Smithsonian notes that only 1 per cent of its collection is on display at a given time, so the 3D replicas also create the opportunity to make more of the collection available to people all the time.\n\nImage: Smithsonian\n\nAnd more and more artefacts are being added to the collection daily. The project has been in the works for a few years now, and new stuff is added all the time, So, even if you\u2019ve checked it out before, it\u2019s worth giving it another look now.", "description": "If you\u2019ve always wanted to own a historic artefact, now you can own the next best thing: a 3D printed replica of one.", "authors": ["Alex Kidman", "Chris Jager"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/lre9sxal6qtzqicpx1jj.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
