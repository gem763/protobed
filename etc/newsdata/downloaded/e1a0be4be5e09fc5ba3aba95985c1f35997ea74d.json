It came after years of complaints from caucus state voters who say they want to vote but, because of work or physical conflicts, have been unable to attend the long and involved events, which often drag on for hours. The virtual proposal was aimed at bringing in those voters, as Democrats hoped to expand turnout in 2020 and pour the maximum amount of grassroots energy into picking a nominee to take on President Donald Trump.\n\nBut two sources close to the DNC discussions said that as the virtual proposals were under consideration, DNC security experts managed to hack into a conference call involving the committee and both Nevada and Iowa parties, raising new questions about security.\n\nOfficials in Iowa, however, say that system was not comparable to the technology under consideration for the caucuses. Democratic leaders in both states expressed frustration that they went to great lengths to craft plans and release them publicly early in the year.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

FBI officials have repeatedly warned that the 2020 elections are just as vulnerable to similar attacks, including from foreign nations.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear just how the caucuses in both Iowa and Nevada will move forward while still fulfilling the DNC-imposed accessibility requirement.\n\nWhile applying for a waiver to skip compliance with the requirement is an option, Price said he doesn't foresee Iowa Democrats going that route at the moment. A Democrat close to the process in Nevada expressed more confidence that the party\u2019s proposal to introduce four days of early voting there would fulfill the accessibility requirement, even with the virtual caucusing scrapped.\n\nMeanwhile, numerous campaigns on Friday called on the DNC to stick to its plan that would increase accessibility.\n\n\u201cThe DNC has disallowed plans to increase participation in the first-in-the-nation caucus state,\u201d Juli\u00e1n Castro said Friday on Twitter. \u201cI strongly urge the DNC to embrace our party\u2019s values and allow absentee voting, either through a virtual caucus, mail-in, or early voting process.\u201d\n\nPrivately, however, aides with several campaigns said they are breathing a sigh of relief. The virtual setup introduced a new counting and reporting system, injecting an element of the unknown into the already complicated caucus process that could have muddied a clear narrative coming out of Iowa next year, the aides said.\n\nIowa Democrats vowed on Friday that the ruling by the DNC would not jeopardize Iowa\u2019s status as the first-in-the-nation caucus state.\n\n\u201cJust know this: On Feb. 3, 2020, caucuses will take place in this state. Iowa will be first,\u201d Democratic Party Chairman Troy Price said during a news conference.\n\n\u201cI am confident that we will find something that will expand accessibility in that process,\u201d Price said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to speculate on what those alternatives are.\u201d\n\nPrice said he spoke on Friday with DNC Chairman Tom Perez, who gave him personal assurances that the ruling would not imperil Iowa\u2019s place on the 2020 calendar.\n\n\u201cThe chairman has assured us that we will be first,\u201d Price said. \u201cWe will be a caucus and we will be first.\u201d", "description": "It's unclear just how the caucuses in both Iowa and Nevada will move forward while fulfilling the accessibility requirement.", "authors": ["Natasha Korecki"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/59/9f/e9eb103d4d1aa8cb17da8edc8826/20190830-tom-perez-dnc-gty-773.jpg"}
