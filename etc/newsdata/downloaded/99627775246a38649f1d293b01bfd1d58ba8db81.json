But the Ukraine allegations are over the top.", "language": "en", "text": "So it appears that the president might have used his official powers \u2014 in particular, perhaps the threat of withholding a quarter-billion dollars in military aid \u2014 to leverage a foreign government into helping him defeat a potential political opponent in the United States.\n\nIf Trump did that, it would be the ultimate impeachable act. Trump has already done more than enough to warrant impeachment and removal with his relentless attempts, on multiple fronts, to sabotage the counterintelligence and criminal investigation by then-special counsel Robert S. Mueller III and to conceal evidence of those attempts. The president\u2019s efforts were impeachable because, in committing those obstructive acts, he put his personal interests above the nation\u2019s: He tried to stop an investigation into whether a hostile foreign power, Russia, tried to interfere with our democracy \u2014 simply because he seemed to find it personally embarrassing. Trump breached his duty of faithful execution to the nation not only because he likely broke the law but also because, through his disregard for the law, he put his self-interest first.\n\nThe current whistleblowing allegations, however, are even worse. Unlike the allegations of conspiracy with Russia before the 2016 election, these concern Trump\u2019s actions as president, not as a private citizen, and his exercise of presidential powers over foreign policy with Ukraine. Moreover, with Russia, at least there was an attempt to get the facts through the Mueller investigation; here the White House is trying to shut down the entire inquiry from the start \u2014 depriving not just the American people, but even congressional intelligence committees, of necessary information.", "description": "", "authors": ["Conway", "Washingtonpost.Com Opinions Trump-Has-Done-Plenty-To-Warrant-Impeachment-But-The-Ukraine-Allegations-Are-Over-The-Top"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
