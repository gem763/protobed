Lerman said the big obstacle is the simple fact that most site search is pretty bad: \u201cThe algorithms that are there today are the algorithms of 1995. It\u2019s keyword-based document search.\u201d\n\nSo if you don\u2019t enter exactly the right keywords in exactly the right order, you don\u2019t get useful results. Yext, on the other hand, has supposedly spent two years building its own search engine, with natural language processing technology.\n\nAs Lerman showed me, that means it can handle more complex, conversational queries like \u201cbroccoli cheese soup recipes in 10 minutes or less.\u201d He also pointed out how Yext has tried to follow Google\u2019s lead in presenting the results in a variety of formats, whether that\u2019s just a straightforward answer to a question, or maps if you\u2019re searching for store locations.\n\nIn addition, Yext Answers customers will get analytics about what people are searching for on their site. If people are searching for a question that the site isn\u2019t answering, businesses can then take advantage of their company\u2019s knowledge base to publish something new \u2014 and that, in turn, could also help them show up in search results elsewhere.\n\nYext Answers has been beta testing with companies like Three Mobile, BBVA USA, IHA and Healthcare Associates of Texas. You also can try it out for yourself on the Yext site.\n\n\u201cYext Answers represents a level of sophistication that elevates our current search into a predictive, insightful tool that provides opportunities to better understand what our patient population is interested in finding on our site,\u201d said Lori Gillen, marketing director at Healthcare Associates of Texas, in a statement. \u201cIt is intelligent enough to understand complex relationships between HCAT-specific facts, like doctors to procedures or specialties to locations, and give insights into what our patients want to know.\u201d\n\nYext Answers is now available in English-speaking countries.", "description": "Yext helps businesses manage their presence on search and across the web; starting today, with the launch of Yext Answers, it\u2019s also helping them provide a better experience on their own websites. \u201cIt lets any company with a website answer a question about their own brand in a Google-like experience on their own site,\u201d CEO [\u2026]", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/howardinterior_blog-1.jpg?w=711", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
