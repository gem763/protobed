The #MeToo movement, which references a Twitter hashtag used by victims to acknowledge experiences of sexual assault and harassment, gained international momentum in October 2017 after dozens of women accused movie mogul Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct.\n\nParker was accused of sexual assault when he was a sophomore at Penn State University. Although he was acquitted, the incident emerged in the press around the release of \u201cThe Birth of a Nation,\u201d a film which many expected to win awards. Parker responded then saying he was \u201cfalsely accused\u201d and had been \u201cvindicated\u201d by the court.\n\nA remorseful Parker was seated alongside Spike Lee, who is supporting the film, and producers Mark Burg and Tarak Ben Ammar hours before his new film premieres at the festival to some 650 people.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still learning and growing and still feeling the need to make films that speak to things that need to change in our country and the world,\u201d Parker said. \u201cAnd this topic was very dear to me.\u201d\n\nThe new film, \u201cAmerican Skin,\u201d stars Parker as an ex-Marine who sees his unarmed 14-year-old son murdered by a police officer during a traffic stop. When the courts fail to hold the officer responsible, Parker\u2019s character Lincoln Jefferson decides to seek justice in his own way. Parker was inspired to write the film after Michael Brown was killed in Ferguson, Missouri.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t had a film that\u2019s affected me this deeply in a while,\u201d said Lee, who offered to help Parker in any way that he could. \u201cThis is a very important film and I wanted to be part of it ... Art can affect people\u2019s behavior good or bad. And it is my hope that this film deals with the very serious problem with police and brown and black people in the United States of America.\u201d\n\nLee said he had no reservations putting his name behind Parker\u2019s.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a move forward. Nate is in here. He\u2019s not hiding. He\u2019s answering all questions,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThis is only Nate\u2019s second feature film, there\u2019s a lot more in him.\u201d\n\nThe producers didn\u2019t hesitate to back a film from Parker either, even considering the fact that \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d fizzled in theaters and didn\u2019t even make back its acquisition price. Next week, they\u2019ll take the film to the Toronto International Film Festival to screen for distributors in hope of securing a release plan.\n\n\u201cIn Europe we didn\u2019t know what was going on with Nate Parker,\u201d Ammar said, who called Parker\u2019s agent after being moved by \u201cThe Birth of a Nation.\u201d \u2033All I cared about is the power of the filmmaker, actor, writer, director.\u201d\n\nBurg added that, \u201cNate is one of if not the most talented director\u201d and that this \u201cwas a story that needs to be told.\u201d\n\nIn the film, Parker brings together all sides to have a \u201creal conversation\u201d between those supporting the police and those feeling persecuted by law enforcement.\n\n\u201cWhat I wanted to do was really force the conversation,\u201d he said. \u201cThis film isn\u2019t about those two sides. It\u2019s about being the bridge between those two sides ... and being able to talk on the level about what they see and what they feel every day.\u201d\n\nHe also hopes that audiences don\u2019t misinterpret \u201cAmerican Skin\u201d as being pessimistic.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my reality,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen Spike and I go home and we get off the plane and get in the car, guess what? We\u2019re not going to be safe.\u201d\n\nParker held back tears when a reporter asked about the legacy he wants to leave.\n\n\u201cI do have a lot of stories I want to tell because I feel like the world is broken,\u201d Parker said, mentioning gun violence, indigenous people, and the plight of women globally. \u201cIt is my prayer that I\u2019ll be able to tell more stories. All I can control is what I can control. And I hope moving forward that I get that opportunity.\u201d", "description": "At the Venice Film International Film Festival, the \"Birth of a Nation\" director apologized for how he responded to a rape allegation from his college days.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6c6b96240000330071c3f9.jpeg?cache=fvd6lmotga&ops=1778_1000"}
