But, having never tried a case in court as a lead or co-counsel, it\u2019s hard to argue that Walker is prepared for a lifetime appointment to be a U.S. District Judge for the Western District of Kentucky.\n\nAnd yet, the Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee made just that argument on Thursday when it voted along party lines to advance Walker to a full vote on the Senate floor. \u201cThis is unquestionably the most outstanding nomination that I\u2019ve ever recommended to Presidents to serve on the bench in Kentucky,\u201d Mitch McConnell tweeted in July, when Walker\u2019s name first came up. However, the Senate Majority Leader made his endorsement to the detriment of the non-partisan American Bar Association, which gave Walker a rare \u201cnot qualified rating.\u201d The ABA suggests that \u201ca nominee to the federal bench ordinarily should have at least 12 years\u2019 experience in the practice of law\u201d \u2014 not zero cases in court under their belt. In addition, Paul T. Moxley, chair of the ABA committee on the federal judiciary, issued the closest thing to an I Don\u2019t Know Her that a lawyer can physically omit: \u201cBased on review of his biographical information and conversations with Mr. Walker, it was challenging to determine how much of his ten years since graduation from law school has been spent in the practice of law.\u201d\n\nDemocrats agreed with the ABA\u2019s concerns over Walker, whose course load includes seminars like Lawyering Skills I and II. \u201cThere have got to be more qualified Republican attorneys in America than the ones we\u2019re seeing before this committee,\u201d said Senate Judiciary member Dick Durbin. Ranking member Dianne Feinstein added a qualitative critique: \u201cHe has opposed the ability of federal agencies to adopt critical health and safety protections for workers and the environment, and he has argued that the FBI should not be independent of the president.\u201d Walker has also been criticized for his defense of Brett Kavanaugh, conducting over 70 interviews in which he challenged the account of Christine Blasey Ford. Civil rights attorney and Obama administration alum Leslie Proll said that Walker got the nomination because \u201che went to bat for Kavanaugh.\u201d\n\nWalker isn\u2019t the first unqualified candidate put forward by the Trump administration. As HuffPost notes, Senate Republicans have confirmed four lifetime federal judges who were deemed unqualified by the ABA, including one guy who just couldn\u2019t write good:\n\nWalker\u2019s passage through the Senate Judiciary on Thursday is a reminder of why establishment Republicans are willing to sit through dueling scandals in Turkey and Ukraine: To remake the federal judiciary in their own likeness for decades to come. As of publication, Trump has appointed two judges to the Supreme Court, 43 to the U.S. Court of Appeals, and 109 to U.S. District Courts.", "description": "37-year-old lawyer Justin Walker passed through the Senate Judiciary, closing in on a lifetime federal appointment despite never having tried a case.
