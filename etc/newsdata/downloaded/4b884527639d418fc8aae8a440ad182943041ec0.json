I think it\u2019s always nice to have a mixture, to be honest.\n\n(Image: Corbis via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cBecause I think old people, despite what most of society think, are actually fascinating. The older you are, the more experience you have to impart.\u201d\n\nNext week will see the semi-finalists battle it out for a spot in the final three.\n\nSteph Blackwell, 28, Alice Fevronia, 28, Rosie Brandreth-Poynter, 28, and David Atherton, 36, are left in the Bake Off tent, all trying to impress judges Paul Hollywood 53, and Prue Leith, 79.\n\nFans have been commenting on how hard it has been to please Paul this year.\n\nAnd Jo, 62, agrees, saying he\u2019s definitely got tougher.\n\n(Image: Love Productions)\n\n\u201cOne thing I think he does, which female presenters find it slightly harder to do, is he can be quite stern and blank people if they are looking to him\n\nfor reassurance.\n\n\u201cI think that comes across as perhaps being mean-spirited, but actually it is all part of the judging procedure and he is not allowed to give people advice on what to do next.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s fair enough, him just staring at the bakers as if he wants to kill them!\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: The comedian - who hosts spin-off Extra Slice - was commenting on the fact this year\u2019s series saw the youngest line-up in the show\u2019s history", "authors": ["Janine Yaqoob", "Image", "Corbis Via Getty Images", "Love Productions"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20655398.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_The-Great-British-Bake-Off.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
