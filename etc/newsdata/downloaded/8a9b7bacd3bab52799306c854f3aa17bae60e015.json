It has been destroyed 37 times, yet each year they put up another one.\n\nLast year it managed to make it out unscathed, according to ABC, but this year an attempt has already been made on its 'little brother', who came away with only a few singe marks.\n\nWATCH: A million lights at Kew Gardens set to get you into the Christmas spirit\n\nThe day before Christmas. ?? I'm celebrating with a throwback from last year when I had company by Santa Claus himself. ??

According to BBC, an estimated 3,6 million Japanese families partake in a KFC meal in a country where traditionally Christmas wasn't celebrated.\n\nKFC saw an opening and now you'd have to book your KFC meal weeks in advance or stand in line for hours on Christmas Day. The meal has also morphed to include cake and wine, while a smiling Santa-clothed Colonel Sanders watches over the festive meals.\n\nWATCH: Robot restaurants, a dildo bar and more cultural surprises in Tokyo (Warning: explicit content)\n\nHaving Rudolph for dinner\n\nSanta better make sure his sleigh crew is safely hidden away. Reindeer steak is a festive main course in places like Finland, Iceland and Alaska in the US, a game meat that's similar to our springbok.\n\nIt's tried to make its way to places like the UK and other parts of US, but people were not too keen on devouring Santa's friends. You can prepare the meat into a burger, tenderloin, sausage or just a well-done steak, though not too sure how it will do on a braai. Just make sure your little cousins don't know what you're serving up for lunch.\n\nMAPPED: A Christmas road trip exploring the culinary delights of Lapland\n\nDon't let Krampus get you\n\nDid you know that Saint Nicholas had an emo brother Krampus? Instead of presents, this anti-Santa likes to beat naughty children and drag them to his lair for some devouring. He's well-known across Europe and featured in traditional parades where people dress up like the demonic alter ego.\n\nHe's normally depicted with two longs horns of a devilish nature, in a big fur coat with goat legs and a demonic face, but it can vary across the regions. He even featured on Christmas cards known as 'Krampuskarten', because who doesn't want to be petrified for Christmas?\n\nWATCH: Gl\u00fchwein and gingerbread - German Christmas markets are a real treat\n\nThe Christmas decoration that will make your grandmother blush\n\nThe Catalonians in Spain are... an interesting bunch. Their traditional Christmas decorations include El Caganer, The Great Defecator. No one knows where this little pooping figurine comes from, but it has been around since the 18th century.\n\nToday, some represent celebrities and other public personalities (of course a Trump one exists) and is mildly tolerated by the predominant faith of Catholicism. So if you're ever in the area, be sure grab your very own pooper for your South African nativity display.\n\nPICS: The renovation of the 'birthplace of Christmas' in Palestine lifts spirits\n\nTreats left for Santa as he jaunts across the world\n\nMost people know that the Big Red Man's favourite snack is cookies and milk, but he seems to have different tastes in different parts of the world. German children prefer to leave letters than snacks, while the Swedes think that all he really wants is some coffee to keep him going through his busiest time of year.\n\nSome parts of Europe and the South Pacific however think that Santa's parched for something a little stronger, like an ice cold beer, and in our summer climate he'd probably prefer that as well - craft though. Dutch kids are more concerned for his reindeer, leaving out carrots for Prancer, Dasher, Dancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner, Blitzen and the spotlight-stealing Rudolph.\n\nHe better watch out for the reindeer eaters.\n\nSEE: Mother City Bakes: Where to get your festive cake and eat it too", "description": "From eating KFC to reindeer, to pooping figurines and trying not to get on the bad side of Krampus, there are some cool and less cool traditions you could try out this festive season.", "authors": ["- Gabi Zietsman"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6879/ea944260146f4c56b1d59c83f8fa5eed.jpg", "published_at": "2017-12-24"}
