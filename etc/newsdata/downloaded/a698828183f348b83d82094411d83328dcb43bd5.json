No team has done better since the New York Yankees won three in a row from 1998-2000.\n\n\u201cWe want to be able to be a dynasty,\u201d Astros shortstop Carlos Correa said. \u201cTo do that we have to win, win, win. We have to go out there and keep doing that.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals had not won a playoff series since 1981, when they were the Montreal Expos. But since relocating from Canada in 2005, they had lost four times in the division series before finally breaking through.\n\n\u201cAll the things in the past, all the failures, and losing in the first round, it just makes it sweet,\u201d said Nationals second baseman Howie Kendrick, the National League Championship Series Most Valuable Player.\n\n\u201cTo see a team like us continue to grind, I think the mixture of people that we do have is what makes us so good. I wouldn\u2019t change anything about the past because this is just unbelievable.\u201d\n\nThe best-of-seven showdown will start in Houston then move to Washington for game three on Friday, the first World Series game in the US capital since 1933, when the Senators lost to the New York Giants.\n\n\u201cThis right here, to me, tops everything I\u2019ve ever been through,\u201d Nationals manager Dave Martinez said. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of the guys. They could have folded. They didn\u2019t. It means a lot to all of us.\u201d\n\nWashington\u2019s original Senators became the Minnesota Twins after the 1960 season while a replacement expansion club relocated to become the Texas Rangers in 1972.\n\n\u2013 Cole comfort for Astros \u2013\n\nHouston Astros star pitchers Gerrit Cole, Justin Verlander and Zack Greinke will be tested against Washington\u2019s starting rotation of Max Scherzer, Stephen Strasburg and Patrick Corbin.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thrilled,\u201d Cole said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have some great pitching matchups. They have a lot of talent. They are going to be a really tough opponent. It\u2019s going to be a fun series for sure.\u201d\n\nHouston game one starter Cole, 3-0 in the playoffs with a 0.40 earned-run average (ERA), is 19-0 in his past 25 starts with a 1.59 ERA and 258 strikeouts over 169 1/3 innings. He went 20-5 this season and led the major leagues with 326 strikeouts. The Astros have won his past 16 starts.\n\nWashington ace Scherzer is 2-0 with a 1.80 ERA in playoffs, allowing one run on five hits and five walks with 18 strikeouts over 14 innings. He lost his only prior World Series start in 2012 with Detroit. Scherzer went 11-7 with a 2.92 ERA this season with a major-league best ratio of 7.364 strikeouts per walk issued.\n\nHouston\u2019s hitters will be ready for the challenge, including clean-up batter Alex Bregman and star second baseman Jose Altuve, the American League Championship Series MVP.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always feeding off each other, helping each other,\u201d Altuve said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re going to the World Series.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Made our own luck\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe teams did not meet in the regular season.\n\nThe Astros boast a deeper bullpen of relief pitchers than Washington but the Nationals have Houston native Anthony Rendon, who has a hit in eight consecutive playoff games, as third baseman.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to catch some breaks,\u201d said Nationals slugger Ryan Zimmerman. \u201cIn the years past, maybe we didn\u2019t catch those breaks. We caught some breaks this year, but more importantly, we took advantage of those breaks. So kind of made our own luck.\u201d\n\nThe Astros defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 2017 World Series but lost to eventual World Series winner Boston in last year\u2019s American League Championship series.\n\n\u201cWe hung a banner two years ago. We want to hang another one,\u201d Astros manager A.J. Hinch said. \u201cWinning drives this team. It\u2019s really all that drives us. The players do an unbelievable job of pushing one another.\n\n\u201cLast year we got (close to) the World Series and that was deemed a disappointment. And that pisses off major league players. And so we came back this year and got back to the World Series and we\u2019re going to try to tack onto the resumes of a lot of these guys.\u201d", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 An upstart Washington Nationals squad will try to end the US capital\u2019s 95-year Major League Baseball title drought when the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/20/9a7670_washington-nationals-ace-pitcher-max-scherzer-try-club-win-world-series-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
