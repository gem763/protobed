The country also recorded the biggest jump in the aggregate wealth of all its people, mainly because of a strengthening Swiss franc.\n\nHong Kong, despite falling into a recession following months of anti-government protests, came second after Switzerland in terms of wealth per person.\n\n\"Hong Kong is the only place where house prices rose faster than equity prices, and the only place where the share of the top one percent declined,\" Credit Suisse said.\n\nWealth levels in the US, China, Japan, India and Brazil all increased.\n\nBut a sharp drop in the value of the Australian dollar saw people Down Under lose a staggering $28,670 in wealth per adult between mid-2018 and mid-2019. However, the country still has one of the highest levels of wealth per adult in the world.\n\nRich China\n\nChina was a key contributor to the creation of wealth in the world.\n\nFor the first time, China surpassed the US to claim the biggest share of the global top 10 percent of wealthy individuals - defined as those with assets of at least $109,403. Credit Suisse's survey showed there are 100 million Chinese in that top rank, compared with 99 million Americans.\n\nAnd in terms of total wealth, China now ranks second behind the US, overtaking Japan as property prices there soar.\n\n\"China's progress has enabled it to replace Europe as the principal source of global wealth growth and to replace Japan as the country with the second-largest number of millionaires,\" Credit Suisse said.\n\nInequality and debt remain problems\n\nDespite the overall growth, global wealth remains concentrated in the hands of the few richest people in the world. The lower half of the global population collectively owns less than one percent of the world's net assets, while the top one percent owns about 44 percent of all wealth, Credit Suisse estimated.\n\nWhile the gap between the world's richest and poorest people has been widening, the inequality between countries has been shrinking over the past century, the bank said.\n\nIt said a key reason for this is that the growth in financial assets - such as cash, stocks and bonds - is slowing. Financial asset growth was a major reason for widening inequality after the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nMeanwhile, an increase in non-financial assets - such as houses - is fuelling wealth creation in emerging economies. Non-financial assets accounted for the bulk of new wealth in China, Europe and Latin America, and almost all new wealth in Africa and India.\n\n\"While it is too early to say that wealth inequality is now in a downward phase, the prevailing evidence suggests that 2016 may have been the peak for the foreseeable future,\" Credit Suisse said.\n\nAnother source of concern is rising debt levels. Globally, debts rose by four percent over the last year, Credit Suisse said.\n\n\"Our estimates indicate that household debt increased in all regions, and at a double-digit rate in China and India,\" it added.", "description": "While wealth inequality remains high, the trend towards greater disparity is easing, says Credit Suisse.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/22/54cf08a5943a4faa9736f7a893507a0f_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
