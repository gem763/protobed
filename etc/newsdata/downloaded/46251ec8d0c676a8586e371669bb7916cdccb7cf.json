Melania never joined.\n\nEarly on in his presidency, Trump had an extremely contentious relationship with Kim and the two leaders frequently traded insults from across the globe - sparking fears of a potentially devastating military conflict between the US and North Korea.\n\nBut Trump softened his tone toward the North Korean leader moving into 2018, which paved the way for the two to meet in Singapore in June last year. Trump and Kim expressed a desire to turn the page in the historically antagonistic relationship between US and North Korea. The leaders signed joint statement pledging to move toward an enduring peace and the complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula.\n\nTrump earlier this year met with Kim a second time in Hanoi, Vietnam, to continue talks on denuclearisation. The summit ended abruptly and without a clear or firm deal in place.\n\nThe president in June met with Kim a third time at the demilitarised zone between North and South Korea. The meeting, which Kim said came as a surprise, was last-minute and orchestrated via a tweet from Trump.\n\nTrump's daughter and son-in-law, White House advisers Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, were present for the meeting in June.\n\nBut the first lady was not present for either of the two summits or the fairly impromptu meeting that occurred in June.\n\nSince transitioning from insulting him with tweets to meeting with the North Korean leader on the global stage, Trump has routinely boasted about his close relationship with Kim.\n\nThe president's ongoing praise for Kim, one of the world's most repressive leaders, has been highly controversial and sparked criticism from politicians on both sides of the aisle.\n\n'We are in the world of missiles folks, whether you like it or not'\n\nNorth Korea has still not denuclearised and in recent weeks has conducted missile tests - including over the weekend.\n\nAt the G7 on Sunday, Trump told reporters he was \"not happy\" about North Korea's missile tests but said Kim was \"not in violation of any agreement.\"\n\n\"I discussed long-range ballistic and that he cannot do and he hasn't been doing it and he hasn't been doing nuclear testing. He has done short-range, much more standard missiles, a lot of people are testing those missiles, not just him. We are in the world of missiles folks, whether you like it or not,\" Trump added during a bilateral meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.\n\nAbe disagreed with Trump's assessment. \"Our position is very clear, the launch of the short-range ballistic missiles by North Korea clearly violates the relevant UN Security Council resolutions.\"", "description": "The White House said that while American First Lady Melania Trump \"hasn't met\" with Kim Jong Un, the president \"feels like she's gotten to know him too.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7723/f6d960523ad04c099a77f0c028397a70.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-27"}
