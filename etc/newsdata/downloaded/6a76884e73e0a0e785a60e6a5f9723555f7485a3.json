Elizabeth Warren, the rising star among Democratic candidates at the moment, laid out her vision for energy production in the U.S. It is so catastrophically misguided that it should disqualify her from holding the office she seeks.\n\nAt Wednesday\u2019s town hall, Democrats tried to one-up each other with various grandiose plans to decarbonize the U.S. economy.\n\nBut it was Warren\u2019s almost offhand remarks about domestic energy production that caught our attention.\n\n\u201cI think the way we get there,\u201d she said, is to force electric utilities to stop using fossil fuels to generate electricity. \u201cWe just say, sorry, guys but by 2035, you\u2019re done. You\u2019re not going to be using any more carbon-based fuels. That gets us to the right place.\u201d\n\nCan Warren possibly be serious?\n\nNot only does she want to eliminate oil, natural gas, and coal as energy sources, she also wants to get rid of nuclear energy \u2013 which, in case you\u2019re wondering, emits no CO2.\n\nWarren says, \u201cIn my administration, we\u2019re not going to build any new nuclear power plants, and we are going to start weaning ourselves off nuclear energy and replacing it with renewable fuels. We\u2019re going to get it all done by 2035, but I hope we\u2019re getting it done faster than that. That\u2019s the plan.\u201d\n\nTo understand how completely detached this idea is from reality, let\u2019s look at the data on energy production today, which are helpfully compiled by the Energy Department\u2019s Energy Information Administration (EIA).\n\nIn June 2019, energy plants around the country produced a total of 352 million megawatt-hours of electricity.\n\nNatural gas-powered plants accounted for 39% of that electricity, coal 22%, nuclear 20%.\n\nHow much did wind contribute? Less than 7%. Solar accounted for a mere 3.3%.\n\nEven if you add in hydroelectric, which environmentalists don\u2019t particularly like either because it involves damming rivers, these \u201cclean\u201d energy sources account for less than 18% of the nation\u2019s electricity.\n\nThe EIA projects that on current trends, renewables will account for 24% of power generation by 2035 \u2013 and that\u2019s assuming all the massive subsidies for solar and wind continue. It projects renewables\u2019 share to have climbed to only 29% by 2050.\n\nSo how, exactly, is Warren going to shift more than three-quarters of domestic energy production over to wind and solar in less than 15 years? How would she finance it? Who would pay for the skyrocketing utility bills hitting working-class families?\n\nWarren\u2019s vision is even more farcical given the fact that wind and solar are unreliable sources. Today, conventional energy must fill in the gaps in power grids that rely on the vagaries of the wind and sun. What happens when that\u2019s been outlawed and energy demand skyrockets on a hot, windless day?\n\nThere\u2019s also the problem of finding enough land to build the turbines and lay out all the solar panels needed for such a massive conversion project. Environmentalists never bother to mention this, but renewable energy is an enormous land hog. A recent study found that solar and wind require about 100 times more land than natural gas-powered plants to produce the same amount of electricity. Biomass is even more gluttonous, requiring up to 1,000 times the land.\n\nThe study found that getting to just 80% renewables would require that 10% of all land in the Northeast be devoted to energy production needed for the region. In Vermont, the share would be 20%. In Warren\u2019s home state of Massachusetts, up to 15% of the land would be needed.\n\nGood luck getting that done in today\u2019s NIMBY age. Particularly when environmentalists themselves are constantly fighting against specific solar plants and wind farms because of their adverse impacts on local ecosystems.\n\nBut here\u2019s the really important question that must be asked: What does it say about a presidential candidate who puts forward a plan she knows will be impossible to achieve, that would cause an economic catastrophe if it were attempted, and that would do nothing to solve the \u201cclimate crisis\u201d the planet allegedly faces?\n\nIn another age, such a candidate would be laughed off the stage as a crackpot, a charlatan, a crazed ideologue. Today, she\u2019s treated as a serious contender to be leader of the free world.\n\n\u2014 Written by John Merline\n\nNote to Readers: Issues & Insights is a new site launched by the seasoned journalists behind the legendary IBD Editorials page.
