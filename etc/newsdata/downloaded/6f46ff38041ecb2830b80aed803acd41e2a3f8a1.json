On some occasions, we earn revenue if you click the links and book, but we never allow this to affect our coverage.\n\nWant to wolf down a cookie with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s face on it? Of course you do. The candy red, maple leaf-shaped shortbread, iced with a hockey-rink white \"Canada\" across its stem, is on sale at French-style boulangerie Le Moulin de Provence in the belly of the city\u2019s Byward Market. Tasty? Yes. Moreish? That too. But also an opportunistic take on the bakery\u2019s \"Obama cookie\", so-named because the former US president once bought two (one for himself, the other for family) when visiting Canada\u2019s capital in 2009.\n\nLately, there\u2019s been a roaring trade for the Trudeau biscuit and it\u2019s not hard to see why. Love or loathe the leader of Canada\u2019s Liberal Party (the recent blackface scandal saw him rocket up the global news agenda), there\u2019s no denying his impact overseas and at home. Indeed, whether he survives this week\u2019s federal election for a second term or not, his political and cultural influence in restlessly modern Ottawa is visible throughout. It may not be the obvious Canadian city for a break, but when you arrive there\u2019s a sense it\u2019s transforming, with the side benefit that it\u2019s the most enlightening place in Canada for discovering where Canada is heading next.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAll Trudeau tours of Ottawa need to begin on Parliament Hill, preferably around lunchtime on a summer\u2019s day, with a square-on view of Canada\u2019s neo-gothic parliament. Around this time, a mass of yogis practice on mats on the legislature lawn and many have spotted Trudeau during the weekly Yoga on the Hill class (free, Wednesday, mid-May to August). It\u2019s a tribute to Canadian politeness that when he\u2019s shown up, with heart beating and lungs puffing, he\u2019s been quietly ignored by locals who\u2019re far too involved in their practice to notice. Should yoga not be your thing, free tours of Parliament marry 19th-century history with here-and-now witticisms about the buildings\u2019 delayed, decade-long rehabilitation and homeless politicians.\n\nInto this picture comes the nearby National Arts Centre (NAC), opened by then Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau (nowadays Trudeau Sr), and this year celebrating its 50th anniversary. You can\u2019t miss its glass lantern design from Parliament Hill or the adjacent Fairmont Ch\u00e2teau Laurier, a turreted castle hotel that makes a show of having once been the haunt of other political luminaries such as Sir Winston Churchill, Charles de Gaulle and Herbert Hoover. Unveiled with an outward-looking tower in 2017 by Justin Trudeau, the NAC\u2019s current line-up celebrates indigenous theatre, a programme which fits with the government\u2019s work and national mood of reconciliation. Perfect for photo ops, it overlooks a concise yet extraordinary segment of the Rideau Canal National Historic Site. Don\u2019t pass up the chance to sail it or skate it when the waterway freezes over, becoming rink-like in winter.\n\nAnother thing that changes with the seasons is the food. Come snowfall, out go the lobster and oyster platters, in come the wood-smoked bagels, pork-and-beef tourti\u00e8re pies and heartwarming bowls of poutine. BeaverTails (\u00a32.60), paddle-shaped sugar and cinnamon fried doughnuts and an Ottawa original, are sold at food trucks and rinks across the city. They\u2019re a delicious piece of history.\n\nThe coat-and-tie dining scene is also hardly stuffy and needs no national apology. A beneficial reminder of political patronage can be found at agenda-setting Beckta, where Justin Trudeau and partner Sophie Gregoire-Trudeau have been spotted. Terms such as organic, seasonal and \"new Canadian\" are thrown around in the kitchen here and the same vibe prospers at Riviera, where European heritage crashes headlong into Asian cuisine. Whatever the origins, entr\u00e9es such as ling cod with maitake mushrooms (\u00a315) and smoked king salmon with rosti (\u00a318) allow everyone from Conservative lobbyists to left-wing commentators to negotiate politics with a full stomach.\n\nNeither restaurant is a one-off. Keep an eye out for Fraser Cafe, near Trudeau\u2019s official residence 24 Sussex in the suburb of New Edinburgh, and Fauna, a small-plates specialist with dishes like bison tartare (\u00a311) and suckling pig (\u00a322) in Centretown. There\u2019s not an exhaustive list of go-tos, but it\u2019s one indication of the Canadian capital\u2019s self-assurance and ability to fuel excitement over where to eat.\n\nTo see more of Trudeau\u2019s Ottawa, you could hop on an open-top Gray Line bus to see his current residence Rideau Hall (24 Sussex, in a state of disrepair, controversially sits vacant). Or go the whole nine yards and trick-or-treat out on the front steps. In previous years, the Governor General has hosted Halloween bashes at the address and Trudeau has come out wearing Han Solo, Sherlock Holmes and Clark Kent costumes. No blackface jokes here please.\n\nIf Ottawa is emerging as the most forward-thinking destination in Canada, it helps that it has the whole outdoors thing packed into the wider vicinity. Trudeau and his family are known to hike in Gatineau Park, an hour north of the city in neighbouring Quebec, and cyclists and runners have turned the centre into a model for sustainable living. For a deeper insight, join Maria Rasouli, Iranian-Canadian founder of Escape Tours & Rentals, for a pedal along the Rideau Canal to The Glebe, where you\u2019ll find an almost provincial collection of sweet-as-table-syrup stores. Post a slab of pumpkin and spice chocolate back home from Alicja Confections, or pick up a bag of hand-rolled, Montreal-style bagels at Kettleman\u2019s. Baffingly, it never ever closes.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Justin Trudeau Show all 8 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch.

Often, they only have the vaguest idea of what their national capital has to offer. But these days they \u2014 and you \u2014 should really pay a visit. Because it deserves to be taken very seriously indeed, whether you\u2019re interested in politics or not.\n\nTravel essentials\n\nGetting there\n\nAir Canada flies from London Heathrow to Ottawa, with fares from \u00a3471 return.\n\nStaying there\n\nWith a prime spot overlooking Parliament, Westin Ottawa has doubles from \u00a3119.\n\nMore information\n\nottawatourism.ca", "description": "The Independent\u2019s hotel recommendations are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
