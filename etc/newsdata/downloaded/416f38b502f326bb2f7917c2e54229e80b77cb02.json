The case, filed July 26 in Hardeman County Court, seeks $3 million in compensatory damages and undetermined punitive damages for the suicide, which Lawler and his attorney say could have been avoided.\n\n\u201cI think everyone will agree that preventable suicides must be prevented and this was a preventable one,\u201d Lawler\u2019s attorney Jeffrey Rosenblum said at a press conference Monday afternoon. \u201cYou put a suicidal man in a cell with shoelaces and bolts coming out of the wall. It doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d\n\nBrian Lawler (from here referred to as \u201cBrian\u201d) was pronounced brain dead on July 29, 2018, after hanging himself in his jail cell the night before. He had been in Hardeman County custody since July 7, 2018, following an arrest for driving under the influence. The lawsuit claims the arrest was unfair, as both a blood test and a breathalyzer showed Brian had no alcohol in his system. When a bond was set at $40,000, his father declined to pay it, electing instead to try and transfer Brian to a rehabilitation center. Brian had been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and had a history of drug and alcohol addiction.\n\nJerry Lawler (from here referred to as \u201cLawler\u201d) claimed that when he visited his son at the jail, Sheriff Doolen had seemed invested in Brian\u2019s welfare. \u201cThat was the first time I even met Sheriff Doolen,\u201d Lawler said at the press conference. \u201cIt was very convincing. He brought Brian into the meeting. He said, \u2018Brian, you need help. If you don\u2019t believe you need help, just go into the bathroom and look at yourself.\u2019 He looked bad. I went into the bathroom with him and he started crying.\u201d\n\nBut Brian did not find much help for his addiction problems in the county jail, according to Lawler. Not long after the first meeting, the wrestler received a phone call from his son. \u201cHe said, \u2018Dad, Sheriff Doolen lied. They haven\u2019t given me any help. They won\u2019t even give me the medicine I\u2019ve been taking,\u2019\u201d Lawler said at the press conference. \u201cThat was one of the last times I spoke with my son.\u201d\n\nWhen Brian was assaulted by another inmate on July 28, 2018, the lawsuit alleges that the jail failed to provide him adequate medical care, \u201cdespite Brian having a significant open wound about his eye and urging jail staff to take him to the hospital because of a suspected concussion.\u201d Instead, they placed him in a solitary confinement cell and left Brian with both his shoelaces and a selection of large bolts protruding from the wall. In the complaint, Rosenblum claims the jail did not assess Brian for suicide risk, even though they knew his medical history and that Brian had attempted suicide twice before in 2013 and 2015.\n\n\u201cNot only does the above set of facts constitute a gross deviation from the accepted standard of care from a healthcare liability perspective,\u201d the filing reads, \u201cbut it also constitutes a civil rights violation on the part of all defendants.\u201d\n\nWhile in solitary, Brian repeatedly cried for help, the complaint states, but was ignored. One correctional officer, William Gonzalez, also named as a defendant in the case, told investigators that he saw what appeared to be Brian with a towel over his head, standing on a concrete bench in his cell under one of the wall bolts. Instead of checking on him, Gonzalez finished taking out the garbage. Minutes later, noticing that Brian had not moved, Gonzalez asked a co-worker to take a look. After two officers peeked into the cell, they decided to open the door, and found Brian hanging from his shoelaces. They cut him down with children\u2019s scissors. He was taken off life support the next morning.\n\n\u201c I think everyone will agree that preventable suicides must be prevented and this was a preventable one. \u201d \u2014 Attorney for WWE Star Jerry \u201cThe King\u201d Lawler\n\nFollowing the wrestler\u2019s death, Tennessee District Attorney General Mark Davidson requested a criminal investigation. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigations, which conducted this investigation, declined to comment for this story, but reportedly shared some of their results with Lawler and his attorney.\n\nRepresentatives for the Hardeman County Sheriff\u2019s Office did not respond to requests for comment. \u201cThey knew it was coming,\u201d Rosenblum said. \u201cThere has been no acceptance of responsibility. There has been no effort to settle this suit.\u201d\n\nLawler, a veteran wrestling Hall of Famer, made a name for himself as The King of Memphis in the '70s and \u201980s. He started out as a \u201cheel\u201d (wrestling jargon for the \u201cbad guy\u201d) before transitioning into a \u201cface\u201d (the \u201cgood guy\u201d), and quickly became a star, racking up more than 200 titles and a long-running fake feud with comedian Andy Kaufman. In 1992, Lawler semi-retired from wrestling to become a commentator, where he became famous for squealing \u201cPuppies!\u201d at female wrestlers with big breasts. Like his father, Brian Lawler was also a professional wrestler, performing first as a masked performer named \u201cNebula\u201d before taking the name \u201cToo Sexy\u201d Brian Christopher, and later, \u201cGrand Master Sexay.\u201d\n\nDuring their wrestling careers, the father and son Lawlers often riffed publicly about their relationship, at times vehemently denying they were related at all; at others, performing a bitter resentment. In one WWE Raw episode from 2011, according to Bleacher Report, Lawler commented on one of Brian\u2019s matches, and took his opponent\u2019s side, calling Brian a \u201cbigger screw-up than Charlie Sheen.\u201d In response, the son marched over to the announcement desk, and slapped his father in the face.\n\nBut at the press conference Monday, the kayfabe was over. The family sat solemnly around the desk of Rosenblum\u2019s law offices, answering questions from reporters. Brian\u2019s mother and Lawler\u2019s first wife, Kay McPherson, speaking softly and deliberately, told the crowd she wanted to help prevent another family from going through what she had been through.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a grieving family and we\u2019re sticking together trying to help each one get through each day,\u201d she said. \u201cI think about him everyday. You think about him when you go to bed at night. You think about him when you wake up in the morning. You think about him all day.\u201d", "description": "Brian \u201cGrand Master Sexay\u201d Lawler died by suicide while in police custody, where a lawsuit claims he was placed in solitary confinement after being assaulted by another inmate.", "authors": ["Tarpley Hitt"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1564470183/190729-hitt-lawler-tease_kgsw1g", "published_at": "2019-07-30"}
