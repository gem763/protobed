It\u2019s a new word for us, also for the Church, but people don\u2019t confess the sins we commit against nature.\u201d\n\nGuimar\u00e3es\u2019s words came during the daily press conference for the Oct. 6-27 Synod of Bishops on the Amazon.\n\n\u201cEverything is interconnected, it\u2019s a chain. For this reason, this synod is important,\u201d the archbishop said. \u201cThe future of humanity also depends on the decisions of this synod.\u201d\n\nThe press conference also featured Cardinal Carlos Aguiar Retes, Archbishop of Mexico; Bishop Joaqu\u00edn Pert\u00ed\u00f1ez Fern\u00e1ndez, of Rio Branco, Brazil; and Sister Birgit Weiler, who works in Peru.\n\nThe call for an integral ecology and the protection of the environment were the major themes discussed by the four synod participants.\n\nWeiler accused international corporations of exploiting the resources of the Amazon region without upholding the rules they would be forced to follow in their countries of origin.\n\nThe nun said that many indigenous peoples in the Amazon count on the Church to help them file civil complaints against foreign companies, and that some progress has been made with companies coming from the United States and Canada, but it\u2019s \u201charder to fight for human rights\u201d with Chinese companies.\n\n\u201cThis requires a joint effort, including also the shareholders, who need to see if their consciences are fine with these [human rights violations in the Amazon],\u201d she said, urging stockholders to demand companies work ethically, respecting the people in the region and the environment.\n\nIf not, Weiler said, it would imply \u201cthe life of a person in Europe, the United States and Canada is worth more than a human life in Latin America, the life of a person from the Amazon or a farmer.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all have the same right as inhabitants of our common home,\u201d she said.\n\nWeiler also said that this moment in history calls the Church to \u201ccome out of itself, live as a prophetic voice, and defend this space that is our planet.\u201d\n\nAccording to Aguiar Retes, an \u201cintegral ecology\u201d is indispensable, because continuing to live what Pope Francis has denounced as a \u201cthrowaway culture\u201d of accumulating wealth for its own sake, is \u201csenseless\u201d and will lead \u201cto an apocalyptic catastrophe that will end our planet.\u201d\n\nOne of the questions posed by journalists had to do with the growing presence of Pentecostal churches in the region.\n\nRELATED: Synod member, weary of married priest debate, rues getting stuck in \u201970s\n\nAguiar Retes said that the proclamation of the Gospel, an element of evangelization some argue is often forgotten in the Amazon, is being discussed during the synod\u2019s small group discussions.\n\n\u201cWe have delegates from fraternal churches, and in my group, the delegate himself told us that we need to take into consideration that, first and foremost, people want the Word of God,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd on this, Pope Francis has given us a very strong testimony in [his apostolic exhortation] Evangelii Gaudium and [the encyclical] Laudato Si.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Francis] very much focuses on the urgency of proclaiming the Word of God so that people can deepen their relationship with God and then get to know the rest as well,\u201d Aguiar Retes said.\n\nGuimar\u00e3es said that there are many reasons that cause people to change churches, and that some might change denominations five or six times in their lives: \u201cIt\u2019s enough for some not to be in agreement with the opinion of the pastor to go found another church,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of the reasons for this church swapping, according to the arhbishop, is the question of being welcoming and the prosperity theology espoused by some Evangelical churches, since it promises happiness or physical wellbeing in regions where access to healthcare is almost impossible.\n\nSpanish-born Pert\u00ed\u00f1ez said that the historical shortage of priests in the Amazon has also contributed to people leaving the Catholic Church, arguing that there are \u201cexistential and religious voids that we don\u2019t occupy. Our peoples are very religious, and when anyone comes speaking about God, promising God, people believe them.\u201d\n\nWeiler spoke about the pope\u2019s call to look deeply into the causes of this situation, while at the same time looking for new paths of evangelization, including being attentive at a pastoral, social, cultural and ecological level.\n\n\u201cWe have to go from a visiting ministry to a ministry of presence,\u201d she said. \u201cFor the indigenous peoples, it\u2019s very important that we are present, that we live with them, that we are with them. It brings up the challenge of a deeper inculturation of the faith.\u201d\n\nFollow In\u00e9s San Mart\u00edn on Twitter: @inesanma\n\nCrux is dedicated to smart, wired and independent reporting on the Vatican and worldwide Catholic Church.
