Six working days later, a senior banking executive said the status quo would continue until conditions improved.\n\n\u201cOnce normalcy is restored, we are very confident that we can resume servicing our customers in full capacity,\u201d Salim Sfeir, head of local lender Bank of Beirut, told Reuters on Thursday.\n\nPreviously, long queues were seen at ATMs as worried consumers attempted to access their wealth. Around 65% of Lebanon is banked, figures say, leaving two-thirds of the country cut off from personal funds.\n\nTaleb: shutdown \u201cmost potent case for crypto\u201d\n\nFor well-known Lebanese statistician, former trader and author of \u201cThe Black Swan,\u201d Nassim Nicholas Taleb, the government\u2019s policy was enough to directly endorse cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cThe most potent case for cryptocurrencies: banks are never there when you need them,\u201d he summarized in a tweet. Taleb continued:\n\n\u201cAnd they are trying to bully the public so they avoid accountability and profit disbursements. Bankers are legal crooks.\u201d\n\nThe anger is reminiscent of other recent episodes of economic chaos, during which states have withheld money for their own purposes. In addition to Hong Kong this year, an infamous example is India, which in 2016 began a series of botched currency reforms which left hundreds of millions of people holding worthless notes.\n\nIndia\u2019s taste for Bitcoin soon increased dramatically, before a hardline policy saw its exchange sector all but evaporated last year.\n\nIt is worth noting that unlike banks, the decentralized Bitcoin network operates 24/7 with 99.98% uptime since its inception, according to monitoring resource Bitcoin-uptime.", "description": "Banks have already been closed for six working days due to civil unrest, with fresh information confirming they would stay that way for an unspecified time", "authors": ["William Suberg"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvNWQwODEwOGM5MDU3MWJlYTA3Y2RmYjY1NWJjNTFiMWMuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
