Perhaps. Medvedev and Tsitsipas have what Zverev called \u201ca weird relationship\u201d.\n\nBut effective? Certainly, because Shanghai was Medvedev\u2019s sixth final in a row.\n\nEven before losing to him for the first time in five meetings on Sunday, the 22-year-old Zverev said that Medvedev was the best player in the world right now.\n\nAnd after losing the final to him in straight sets, the sixth-ranked German gave an insight into what makes the fourth-ranked Russian so hard to beat.\n\nZverev took issue with the \u201cboring\u201d tag.\n\n\u201cI actually think the opposite. Daniil is somebody that plays a way that we have never seen before,\u201d said Zverev.\n\n\u201cThat is not boring to me.\u201d\n\nZverev said the 2019 Medvedev is a wholly different proposition to the one he has repeatedly defeated before.\n\nElaborating on what he meant about Medvedev\u2019s style, Zverev added: \u201cMaybe he doesn\u2019t do huge winners or jumping forehands or anything like that.\n\n\u201cHe plays very flat, he plays with shots that you can\u2019t really do anything with the ball, and that is difficult to play against him in an aggressive way.\n\n\u201cSometimes that\u2019s maybe why it looks on TV or from the outside that players are not playing as aggressive against him as against others, but I feel like he doesn\u2019t let you.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Something clicked\u2019 \u2013\n\nMedvedev has been a known quantity to tennis fans for a while and he won three titles last year. But since this summer the Russian has stepped up to a whole new level.\n\nHe announced himself to the broader sporting public with an agonising five-set defeat to Rafael Nadal in the US Open final in September.\n\nSpeaking on Sunday in Shanghai, Medvedev said that \u201csomething clicked\u201d in the United States, where his run of six finals on the bounce began in July-August.\n\nBut if he knows what it is, he is not saying.\n\n\u201cI maybe started to understand something more about myself, and I\u2019m not really sure what,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the Russian freely admits that his gangly frame does not give him the raw power that many of his rivals possess \u2014 so he tries to play what he called \u201csmart\u201d instead.\n\n\u201cLike even talking about the serve, I improved it a lot. But, for example, I cannot serve 230 (kmh).\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why, but I cannot do it, so I have to play with my game.\n\n\u201cAnd as I say, I started to understand my game much more and trying to mix things up, trying to choose the best shot possible in every situation.\u201d", "description": "Shanghai (AFP) \u2013 Novak Djokovic calls him a \u201cvery complete\u201d player and Alexander Zverev says he has a unique style that makes him the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/13/4a6276_daniil-medvedev-russia-is-homing-in-on-roger-federer-place-in-world-rankings-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
