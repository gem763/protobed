The collapse of bitcoin price brings about the new panic in the bitcoin trading market. Many bitcoin investors are scared of the returning bear market as the early of this year. On the contrary, some of the bitcoin-believer, especially the investor who brought Bitcoin in the height of the price still thought that the bitcoin price will rebound very soon. However, it is no doubt that the early stage of the bear market has been shown up in the past month. Many crypto analysts start to predict the bottom price of this market movement.\n\nHowever, as the market developed, crypto traders have detected more tools to safely pass through the bear market. They realized more ways to avoid the loss of the price decline; moreover, they began to earn profit from the bear market. The key to the tools is the bitcoin futures contracts. We are honored to make an interview with Bex500 senior investor Tom Beck and he introduces the details about bitcoin futures contracts. (Reporter=R, Tom Beck=T)\n\nR: Hi, Tom, Thank you for accepting our interview, Could you introduce yourself?\n\nT: Sure, My name is Tom, I have over 10 years\u2019 trading experience. I am one of the partners of the Bex500 Crypto-funds group. The capital size of this fund is over 8000 Bitcoin (over 60 million US dollars.\n\nR: There a lot of traders are interested in Bitcoin futures contracts, could you tell us more about it?\n\nT: Ok! The bitcoin futures contract is a derivative which is an agreement within buyer and seller to exchange the amount of bitcoin (crypto assets) at a settled price and specific time in the future. The bitcoin futures contract is usually along with leverage. Different from the regular spot trading, the futures contract has the following characteristics:\n\nBidirectional purchase, bitcoin futures contract allows trader to earn profit from both trend of market whether the price is rise or fall. For example, as the price of bitcoin fell from $10000 to $8000, traders can earn profit from the $2000 discrepancy. Leverage, in futures contract, traders usually utilize leverage to expand the trading power to earn profit or hedge the risk. For example, Bex500 exchange provides the maximum 200x leverage to traders. A trader invests $100 to put a short position bitcoin futures contract (predict the bitcoin price to fall in the future) at the price of $1000, after leverage, the value of the bitcoin futures contract has been expanded to $20000, when the Bitcoin price only falls from $10000 to $9950 which is 0.5% decline, the trader can earn $200 from his $100 investment. If the trader previously bought a bitcoin in $10000, even he lost $50 from the decline of the price, he still earns $50 from futures trading. It is the way how the trader hedges the risk from spot trading by futures trading.\n\nIn conclusion, the bitcoin futures contract is the tool to give traders more trading options which can help traders to hedge the risk from the bear market. For the high risk speculators, bitcoin future is a great tool for them to earn multiple profits.\n\nR: Where to trade bitcoin futures contract?\n\nAs I am the senior investor of the Bex500 exchange, I may introduce you Bex500 exchange.
