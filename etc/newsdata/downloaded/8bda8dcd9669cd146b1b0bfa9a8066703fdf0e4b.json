Ilhan Omar (MN), Sen. Chuck Schumer (NY), and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, now a presidential candidate. The ads directed readers to a petition page where visitors were prompted to provide their names, email addresses, and phone numbers.\n\nThe group behind the ads was actually a super PAC called C3 PAC. And within just a few weeks of the commencement of the ad campaign, according to a source familiar with the situation, the Trump campaign reached out to the group and requested that they stop branding themselves as a Trump-aligned organization. The Trump Victory Fund Facebook page has since been deleted entirely.", "description": "Within the first weeks of the ad campaign, the Trump team requested they stop branding themselves as a Trump-aligned organization, a source close to the situation says.", "authors": ["Lachlan Markay"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567699646/190905-markay-trump-pac-distance-hero_eyjvip", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
