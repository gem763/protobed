It said that anti-EU articles about the referendum circulated by Russian-backed media outlets RT and Sputnik had a much wider \u201csocial reach\u201d than similar content posted by official pro-\u201cleave\u201d Brexit campaign websites.\n\nMoscow denies interference in the Brexit process.\n\nFollowing the Brexit referendum and Commons committee investigation, British government agencies started developing plans for tightening polling procedures and instituting controls over election-related social media.\n\nBritain\u2019s Cabinet Office, through which the prime minister and his top aides direct government policy, issued detailed proposals to outlaw intimidation of candidates and require greater disclosures by online campaigners.\n\nOne government official said a key plan was to implement a \u201cdigital imprints regime for online election campaign material\u201d by the end of 2019, with the aim of increasing awareness of disinformation and making elections more transparent.\n\nThe Cabinet Office has also prepared legislation which would create a new offence of intimidating candidates and campaigners in the run-up to an election, the official said. Those convicted would be banned from standing for public office for five years.\n\nURGENCY\n\nHowever, neither of these proposals has been approved by parliament and it is unclear how they could move through the legislative process before the next general election, now likely before the end of 2019, officials acknowledge.\n\n\u201cThe government recognises the seriousness and urgency of introducing these commitments, but it is important that we consult properly and consider the views of others to make sure the regulatory framework is as watertight as possible,\u201d one official said.\n\nA Cabinet Office spokeswoman said Britain had not seen evidence of successful interference in its democratic processes by a foreign government.\n\n\u201cDespite this, we will continue to ensure our electoral system is safeguarded against future threats,\u201d she said.\n\nDuring local government elections last May, Britain\u2019s Electoral Commission, an agency with relatively limited powers, conducted surveys in ten jurisdictions where voters were asked to show identification documentation.\n\nA Commission spokeswoman said that nearly everyone asked to show identification did so without difficulty although it remained unclear how this might work in a parliamentary election.\n\nAcademic experts give the British government credit for at least investigating electoral weaknesses and proposing remedies.\n\nBut Professor Philip Howard of Oxford University\u2019s Internet Institute noted that, among other shortcomings, there is no law barring people from running for office if found guilty of intimidating or abusive behaviour.", "description": "With an election looming, Britain does not have time to implement measures to resist the sort of social media and \"fake news\" campaigns involving suspected foreign actors that have affected some Western nations, officials say.", "authors": ["Mark Hosenball", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
