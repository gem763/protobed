Nevils\u2019 complaint led to Lauer being fired in 2017 amid the Me Too movement. Nevils\u2019 identity was not publicly known then, and it was only reported at the time that Lauer had been accused of assaulting a network staffer at the 2014 Olympics.\n\nLauer wrote that the alleged extramarital affair included a \u201cvariety of sex acts\u201d including vaginal and anal sex, which were each \u201cmutual and completely consensual.\u201d He added that the encounter at the Olympics was the beginning of the alleged affair.\n\n\u201cThe story Brooke tells is filled with false details intended only to create the impression this was an abusive encounter,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNothing could be further from the truth. There was absolutely nothing aggressive about that encounter. Brooke did not do or say anything to object. She certainly did not cry. She was a fully enthusiastic and willing partner.\u201d\n\nLauer goes on to question Nevils\u2019 story further, pointing out that the two continued their affair after the alleged rape.\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for survivors of sexual assault to continue consensual sexual relationships with their abuser. Often, this behavior is due to a power imbalance between the victim and perpetrator.\n\nNevils told Farrow that she did have subsequent consensual sexual interactions after the alleged rape.\n\n\u201cThis is what I blame myself most for,\u201d she told Farrow. \u201cIt was completely transactional. It was not a relationship.\u201d\n\nThe former \u201cToday\u201d show host added that Nevils\u2019 story is \u201cfilled with contradictions,\u201d later pointing out that she is seeking monetary payment from NBC and is trying to write a book.\n\nNBC News responded to Nevils\u2019 accusation in a Wednesday morning statement.\n\n\u201cMatt Lauer\u2019s conduct was appalling, horrific and reprehensible, as we said at the time,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cThat\u2019s why he was fired within 24 hours of us first learning of the complaint. Our hearts break again for our colleague.\u201d\n\nLauer also denied the infamous story that he had a button underneath his desk that locked employees into his office so that he could sexually harass them.\n\n\u201cOne such story I should have confronted a long time ago is an example of why I believe my silence was a mistake,\u201d he wrote. \u201cDespite numerous erroneous reports in the past, there was not a button in my office that could lock the door from the inside. There was no such locking mechanism. It didn\u2019t exist.\u201d", "description": "The former \"Today\" show host categorically denied the allegation that he anally raped a former NBC staffer at the 2014 Sochi Olympics.", "authors": ["Women'S Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9debbd2100003d07acbce6.jpeg?cache=hx9fnwpiyx&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
