Up until election day polls had him neck and neck with Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer.\n\nThe Conservatives won 121 seats but beat the Liberals in the popular vote, taking 34.4 percent to their 33.1 percent. Scheer issued a warning to Trudeau.\n\n\u201cCanadians have passed judgement on (Trudeau\u2019s) Liberal government,\u201d noting that the Liberals shed more than 20 seats.\n\n\u201cWe have put him on notice, his leadership is damaged and his government will end soon and when that time comes, the Conservatives will be ready and we will win!\u201d\n\nThe first test of Trudeau\u2019s future government will follow in the coming weeks with a speech to parliament outlining his legislative priorities and a confidence vote.\n\nFor now he faces the tough task of forming a government, for which he will have to take into account the demands of minority parties.\n\nYves-Francois Blanchet, head of the Bloc Quebecois, a down and out party that scored a big comeback on Monday, said he can work with the new government if the interests of French-speaking Quebec are preserved.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Open minds\u2019 \u2013\n\n\u201cIf what is proposed is good for Quebec, you can count on us,\u201d said Blanchet, whose party will have 32 seats in the next legislature.\n\nJagmeet Singh, the leader of the New Democratic party, promised to be constructive.\n\nThe leftist former criminal defense lawyer is the first non-white leader of a federal political party in Canada, and is now a kingmaker.\n\n\u201cIn the days ahead, I\u2019ll be meeting with my new caucus, to talk about how we will deliver for people,\u201d Singh said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll approach building the new parliament with open minds and open hearts,\u201d he added.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe real winner of this election is not a party or a leader. Canadians sent a clear message: they want a government that works for them, and they are not satisfied with the old ways of doing politics.\u201d\n\nTrudeau, a 47-year-old former school teacher, dominated Canadian politics over the four years of his first term, but faced a grilling during the 40-day election campaign, which he described as one of the \u201cdirtiest and nastiest\u201d in Canadian history.\n\nTrudeau and Scheer exchanged barbs as attack ads and misinformation multiplied.\n\nTrudeau evoked the bogeymen of past and current Tory parties fostering \u201cpolitics of fear and division\u201d while Scheer called the prime minister a \u201ccompulsive liar,\u201d \u201ca phony and a fraud.\u201d\n\nGoing into the election Trudeau\u2019s golden boy image had already been damaged by ethics lapses in the handling of the bribery prosecution of engineering giant SNC-Lavalin. His popularity took a further hit with the emergence during the campaign of old photographs of him in blackface makeup.\n\nSome 27.4 million Canadians were eligible to vote in the election, and the turnout was reported to have been large, at almost 65 percent.\n\nA record 97 women were elected to parliament, including Canada\u2019s first indigenous attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, who ran as an independent candidate after Trudeau kicked her out of his caucus.", "description": "Ottawa (AFP) \u2013 A weakened Prime Minister Justin Trudeau set out Tuesday to secure the support of smaller parties he will need to form a government", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/22/b1848b_prime-minister-justin-trudeau-celebrates-his-victory-his-supporters-palais-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
