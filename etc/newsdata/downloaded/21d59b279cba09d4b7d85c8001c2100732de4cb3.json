You can form your own view.

We are one week away form the European Council summit and just a few weeks away from the date of 31 October\u201d.\n\nMr Barnier earlier briefed EU commissioners at a cabinet meeting in Brussels on the proposals. Gunther Oettinger, Germany\u2019s EU commissioner, told reporters: \u201cOnce again, we discussed the proposal from the British government, and basically, all colleagues agreed with Barnier: namely the proposal from the British government does not represent a satisfactory solution.\u201d\n\nLater Mr Barnier told the European parliament: \u201cWhy are we not in a position to reach a deal yet? The British proposals have led to three serious concerns.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re being asked for in reality is to accept a system that hasn\u2019t been properly developed, that hasn\u2019t been tested: there will be controls spread out across Ireland and it will largely be based on exemptions and derogations on technology that is yet to be developed. Changes to international law through the common transit convention but with none of the guarantees that should be set out in this protocol,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe need to have proper, rigorous checks all along the border of the single market. We need operational, real controls \u2013 credible controls. We\u2019re talking about the credibility of the single market here to consumers, companies, and third countries that we negotiate agreements with.\u201d\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Even if it were to be implemented, every four years they could call this into question.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in the same debate, European parliament Brexit coordinator Guy Verhofstadt let rip at Brexiteers, who he branded \u201cthe real traitors\u201d in response to rhetoric from Boris Johnson\u2019s side that spoke of \u201csurrender\u201d by pro-EU British MPs.\n\n\u201cI will be less diplomatic than Michel Barnier. I think the proposal that Boris Johnson put forward exactly one week ago was not serious at all, dear colleagues,\u201d he told MEPs.\n\n\u201cNot serious at all, because it was in fact \u2013 I call it a virtual proposal \u2013 not a real proposal. It gives a veto to the DUP, it puts customs facilities not on the border but in all the other parts of the islands of Ireland.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
