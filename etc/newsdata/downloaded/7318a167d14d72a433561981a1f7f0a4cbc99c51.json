It allows Tesla owners to press a button in the Tesla app on their phone, and their car will drive itself to their location from a maximum distance of 200 feet, even navigating obstacles. In a tweet last week CEO Elon Musk said the feature was \"improving rapidly.\"\n\nSome owners shared gleeful videos of their cars coming to find them.\n\nHowever, videos and photos started to circulate of summoned Tesla's getting into more precarious situations. One video showed a Tesla almost getting into a crash with an SUV.\n\n\u2014Roddie Hasan - \u0631\u0627\u0636\u064a (@eiddor) September 28, 2019\n\nOne Tesla owner claimed his car got a dent after it drove into the side of his garage, and another photo appeared to show a Tesla which had mounted a curb into some foliage.\n\nA video on YouTube showed a summoned vehicle apparently becoming confused after encountering pedestrians and other cars in a Walmart car park.\n\nTesla says on its website that Smart Summon is \"only intended for use in private parking lots and driveways.\"\n\n\"You are still responsible for your car and must monitor it and its surroundings at all times and be within your line of sight because it may not detect all obstacles. Be especially careful around quick moving people, bicycles and cars,\" it adds.\n\nThe self-driving capabilities of Tesla cars are under scrutiny in the US, as the company is facing multiple lawsuits from the families of people who died in car crashes while their Tesla's autopilot feature was enabled.", "description": "Tesla's Smart Summon feature was rolled out as part of software update 10.0, and allows owners to summon their cars from 200 feet away.", "authors": ["Isobel Asher Hamilton"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d93325c2e22af373260def7?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
