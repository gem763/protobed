Its gross margin was 37.9%, it said.\n\nThe company said revenue increased 18% quarter on quarter. Previously, it had guided for a 15.3% sequential increase in quarterly revenue at the mid-point.\n\nIncreased sales in the imaging, analog, power discrete and microelectromechanical systems segments were largely offset by softness in the digital integrated circuits, automotive and microcontrollers markets, STMicroelectronics said.\n\nLooking ahead, the company guided for a sequential increase in fourth quarter revenue of around 5% at the mid-point, with a gross margin of about 38.2%. Full-year net revenue is expected to be $9.48 billion at the midpoint, with a double-digit operating margin performance.", "description": "Increased sales in the imaging, analog, power discrete and microelectromechanical systems segments were largely offset by softness in the digital integrated...", "authors": ["Carlo Martuscelli"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HM503_stmicr_ZG_20190701065315.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
