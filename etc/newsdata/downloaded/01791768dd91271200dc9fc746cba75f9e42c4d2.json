It was at this time when Trump, with his family by his side, announced his plan to run to become the next President of the United States. In the months that followed, Trump surprised many by gaining in the polls despite his controversial campaign style. By the summer of 2016, Trump was named the GOP nominee at the Republican National Convention. Only a few short months later on Election Day, the former host of \"The Apprentice\" pulled off one of the biggest political upsets in recent history by defying the odds against the favorite candidate, Hillary Clinton, his Democratic Party opponent, to become the new commander in chief.\n\nWhen Donald Trump was sworn into office on Inauguration Day, controversy continued to follow him into the White House. While the new president had his core supporters celebrating the big day, millions took to the streets in Washington and in other cities around the country to protest. Within weeks, Trump defended his policy proposals, executive orders, and other decisions as the leader of the free world, regardless of the backlash from those who opposed him.\n\nOver the last seven months, Trump has become one of the most polarizing political figures to lead a nation, with those who support him doing so at every turn, while his critics take time to push back on a daily basis. Due to Trump's notoriety before launching his career as a politician, a large number of Americans had a preconceived notion about the billionaire real estate mogul, which many believe has led to his low approval rating that is currently hovering around 35 percent.\n\nWhether one is for or against Donald Trump, it cannot be denied that the President of the United States commands attention, not just in America, but also around the world. From domestic issues to those that dominate the world stage, only time will tell how Trump handles himself in office and in what direction he moves the country in the years to come.", "description": "In June 2015, Donald Trump stood on the floor of the world famous Trump Tower in New York City and generated massive media attention.
