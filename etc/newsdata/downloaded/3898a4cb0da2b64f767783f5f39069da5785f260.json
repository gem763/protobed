Fernandez laid out his populist credentials during a visit to Madrid on Thursday, saying local Argentine interests would trump those of creditors and energy investors.\n\nAs distressed debt specialists rushed to buy discounted Argentine paper, Fernandez's economic adviser, Guillermo Nielsen, has held conference calls with the country's foreign creditors over the past week, investors said. Nielsen was the country's chief debt negotiator following a default in 2002.\n\nArgentina's over-the-counter sovereign bonds fell an average 39.4% in August before bargain hunters stepped in this week, pushing prices 7.5% higher on Wednesday and Thursday alone.\n\nMacri, who came to power in 2015 as a free-market champion and critic of interventionist policy, was forced to roll out plans to delay payments on around $100 billion of debt amid default fears and impose currency controls.\n\nThose have stabilized markets, but the economic outlook has dimmed. Economists polled by the central bank raised their inflation forecast for the year to 55% and cut their outlook for the economy, expecting it to shrink 2.5%.", "description": "Argentine markets stabilize after political uncertainty smashes bonds, peso", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXNPEF851CQ_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
