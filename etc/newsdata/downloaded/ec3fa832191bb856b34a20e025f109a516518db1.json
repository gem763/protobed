The annual budget for its Violent Crime Taskforce is \u00a315million.\n\nScotland Yard's figures suggest that so far this year there have been 115 homicides in London, compared with 112 at the same point in 2018. This includes 77 stabbings and nine shootings.\n\nDame Cressida said the policing of the climate change group had put a \"horrendous strain\" on the force, and as a result some of its other investigations were either being done slowly or in the worst-case scenario - not at all.", "description": "Policing the Extinction Rebellion protests has cost Scotland Yard \u00a337million so far this year and has caused other investigations to be closed down.", "authors": ["Gareth Davies", "Asa Bennett", "Tom Harris", "Eilis O'Hanlon"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/22/TELEMMGLPICT000213398951-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqiKRumbr6FEfkgThIrtX0sLSOPRvMtEGlw6t0Npge6i0.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
