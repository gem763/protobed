Four of those shots in the first-quarter barrage were from beyond the 3-point line, where he finished hitting 5-of-7 attempts on the night.\n\nIt\u2019s only the preseason, but it looks like the Heat got a bonafide sharpshooter with the 13th pick in the draft, a tremendous value in a league that emphasizes the long-distance shot. He can create off the dribble too.\n\nYeah, it's just the preseason. But Tyler Herro's shot and scoring ability look ready-made for NBA success. (Getty)\n\nHerro rose up draft boards after averaging 14 points on 35.5 percent 3-point shooting as a freshman at Kentucky, earning All-SEC honors. The 6-foot-5 shooting guard is showing potential well beyond that long-distance shooting number from the college 3-point line in his first bit of NBA action.\n\nWill preseason success translate?\n\nWhile preseason success is certainly no indicator of real success in the NBA, it\u2019s hard to argue with Herro\u2019s form, accuracy and ability to create his own shot. Those aren\u2019t traits that will disappear when the regular season tips.\n\nHe\u2019s gotten the attention of Miami and team leader Jimmy Butler.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a surprise to anybody around here,\u201d Butler told reporters, per The Miami Herald. \u201cBecause he works incredibly hard, and he\u2019s confident each and every day that he steps into the arena. He knows what he\u2019s capable of. He goes out there and he shines, and he\u2019s going to continue to do it.\u201d\n\nIf he keeps this up, he\u2019ll soon have the attention of the NBA.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n", "description": "Yeah, it's just the preseason.
