As the owner of VERY LOW RATINGS @CNN, perhaps they will now put a stop to all of the Fake News emanating from its non-credible \u2018anchors.\u2019 Also, I hear that, because of its bad ratings, it is losing a fortune,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cBut most importantly, @CNN is bad for the USA.\u201d\n\nCNN HAS BAD WEEK AMID APRIL RYAN, CHRIS CUOMO AND DON LEMON NEWS: \u2018IT WAS QUITE EMBARRASSING\u2019\n\nThe president added that CNN\u2019s international division \u201cspews bad information & Fake News all over the globe,\u201d prompting foreign leaders to question why the media hates the country.\n\n\u201cIt is a fraudulent shame, & all comes from the top!\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nBut Trump wasn\u2019t finished attacking the media and sent an additional thread of messages aimed at MSNBC.\n\n\u201cAs bad as @CNN is, Comcast MSNBC is worse. Their ratings are also way down because they have lost all credibility. I believe their stories about me are not 93% negative, but actually 100% negative. They are incapable of saying anything positive, despite all of the great things that this Administration has done,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cThey don\u2019t talk about the great economy, the big tax and regulation cuts, the rebuilding of the Military, \u2018Choice\u2019 at our VA, our Vets, Judges and Supreme Court Justices, the Border Wall going up, lowest crime numbers, 2nd A, and so much more!\u201d\n\nOUTGOING CNN CONTRIBUTOR ELIANA JOHNSON QUESTIONS NETWORK'S DECISION TO SEND HER PACKING\n\nCNN and MSNBC did not immediately respond to separate request for comment.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nCNN executive Matt Dornic appeared to respond on Twitter. \u2018In case you hear differently, CNN is having its most profitable year in history,\u201d Dornic tweeted Monday.\n\nTrump has been a frequent critic of both CNN and MSNBC throughout his administration. Last week, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham mocked CNN on Thursday for inaccurately labeling Alabama as Mississippi in an on-screen graphic.\n\nAs for MSNBC, the network has not publically announced any disciplinary action for Lawrence O\u2019Donnell despite the far-left anchor being forced to apologize and retract a singled-sourced, unverified report last month \u2013 which bypassed the network's standards \u2013 claiming President Trump possibly had loans co-signed by Russian oligarchs.\n\nO\u2019Donnell admitted that he aired information that \u201cwasn\u2019t ready for reporting\u201d and broke NBC News regulations in the process. The retraction and apology came after Trump's legal team sent a harshly worded letter to NBC demanding the apology and retraction for \u201cfalse and defamatory, and extremely damaging\u201d comments made by the MSNBC primetime host.\n\nTRUMP MOCKS CNN\u2019S CHRIS CUOMO OVER VIRAL VIDEO: \u2018I THOUGHT CHRIS WAS FREDO ALSO\u2019\n\nAlthough Trump mocks CNN on a regular basis, he also declared that NBC News has \u201cless credibility\u201d than its liberal rival during a press gaggle last month. NBC News White House correspondent Peter Alexander seemingly annoyed the president by asking about 2020 Democratic hopeful Joe Biden and he attacked the Peacock Network as a result.\n\n\u201cThis guy is the most biased reporter,\" the president said on Aug. 21. \"NBC, you know I made a lot of money for NBC with \u2018The Apprentice\u2019 and I used to like them but they are the most biased. Peter is such a biased\u2026 you should be able to ask a question in a better way. You are so obviously biased.\u201d\n\nTrump said that the public \u201chas no confidence in the media\u201d because of biased reporters.\n\n\u201cNBC News has less credibility, in my opinion\u2026 than CNN. I think CNN has more credibility than NBC News,\u201d Trump said at the time.\n\nTrump has shown that no news networks are off limits for his Twitter tirades. While he goes after MSNBC and CNN on a regular basis, he also took shots at Fox News late last month when he accused the network of \u201cpromoting\u201d the Democratic National Committee by airing an interview with the group\u2019s communications director.", "description": "President Trump attacked the mainstream media in a series of tweets on Monday, declaring that the liberal CNN is bad for the United States but \u201cMSNBC is worse.\u201d", "authors": ["Brian Flood", "Brian Flood Covers The Media For Fox News.
