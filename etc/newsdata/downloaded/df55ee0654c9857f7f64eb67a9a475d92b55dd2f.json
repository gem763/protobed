American manufacturers face tougher times owing to a U.S. trade war with China and a slowing global economy.\n\nThe numbers: American manufacturers posted the biggest contraction in September since the end of the 2007-2009 recession, reflecting a slowdown in the U.S. and global economies made worse by a tense trade war with China.\n\nThe Institute for Supply Management said its manufacturing index fell to 47.8% last month from 49.1%, marking the lowest level since June 2009. That\u2019s when the Great Recession ended.\n\nEconomists surveyed by MarketWatch had forecast the index to total 50.2%.\n\nThe sharp decline in the index raised the specter of recession, wiping out early Wall Street gains and sending stocks lower. Readings over 50% signal business conditions are getting better, below 50% indicates they are getting worse.\n\nPresident Trump quickly took to Twitter to blast the Federal Reserve again, blaming the central bank for keeping U.S. interest rates too high.\n\nAs I predicted, Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve have allowed the Dollar to get so strong, especially relative to ALL other currencies, that our manufacturers are being negatively affected. Fed Rate too high. They are their own worst enemies, they don\u2019t have a clue. Pathetic! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 1, 2019\n\nSome economists also believe interests rates are too high, though they say the ongoing trade war is the biggest culprit.\n\nWhat happened: Production, employment and inventories all declined in September. The index for new orders actually rose a tick to 47.3%, but it\u2019s still at the weakest level in a decade.\n\nAnother bad sign: Only three of the 18 U.S. manufacturing industries tracked by ISM reported growth, down from nine in the prior month.\n\n\u201cChinese tariffs going up are hurting our business. Most of the materials are not made in the U.S. and made only in China,\u201d said an executive at a food and beverages manufacturer.\n\n\u201cEconomy seems to be softening. The tariffs have caused much confusion in the industry,\u201d said an executive at a company that makes electrical equipment.\n\nA three-week strike at General Motors GM, -1.63% likely contributed to the poor index reading, but it\u2019s unclear how much. Comments from executives suggested the manufacturing industry\u2019s weakness goes deeper.\n\nRead: Chicago PMI contracts for third time in four months\n\nA similar manufacturing survey by IHS Markit, meanwhile, registered 51.1 in September.\n\nWhat they are saying? \u201cManufacturing weakness is close to dangerous levels. Historically, readings under 46 are consistent with recession,\u201d said senior economist Chris Low of FTN Financial. \u201cManufacturing is a small part of the economy, but it is a vitally important one, producing income and multiplier effects, especially in the Midwest.\u201d\n\nBig picture: Manufacturers at home and abroad have faced waning demand and more canceled orders as they struggle to cope with a global economic slowdown, exacerbated in part by the trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies.\n\nManufacturing is a much smaller part of the economy than it used to be, but there are signs the industry\u2019s slump is spreading to the larger service sector. So far the damage appears to be contained, but there\u2019s growing worry it will get worse unless the U.S. and China strike a deal or at least ratchet down tensions.\n\nMarket reaction: The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.60% and S&P 500 SPX, -0.45% fell in Tuesday trades, surrendering early gains after the poor ISM report.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD10Y, -2.27% sank to 1.65% from as high as 1.74% earlier Tuesday morning.", "description": "American manufacturing posted the biggest contraction in September since the end of the 2007-2009 recession, reflecting a slowdown in the U.S. and global...", "authors": ["Jeffry Bartash"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS375_ism_ma_ZG_20191001091439.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
