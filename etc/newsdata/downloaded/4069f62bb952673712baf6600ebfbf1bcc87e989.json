Hill has admitted to carrying on a consensual relationship with her female staffer but denies any romantic involvement with the male staffer.\n\n\u201cI know that even a consensual relationship with a subordinate is inappropriate, but I still allowed it to happen despite my better judgment,\u201d Hill wrote in a letter of resignation she posted on her Twitter account.\n\nThe move came ten days after Redstate published explicit photos of Hill with the female campaign staffer. Additional explicit photos were posted by the British tabloid The Daily Mail.\n\nHill and her husband Kenny Heslep are currently going through an acrimonious divorce and Hill has maintained that he provided the nude photos to Redstate in order to harm her career.\n\n\u201cI am saddened that the deeply personal matter of my divorce has been brought into public view,\u201d Hill wrote in her letter, \u201ceven the false allegations of a relationship with my congressional staffer, which I have publicly denied, and I am fully and proactively cooperating with the Ethics Committee.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Matt Gaetz (R., Fla.), a colleague of Hill\u2019s on the House Armed Service Committee, had previously defended the congresswoman.\n\n\u201cThe only person who seems to have a gripe is @RepKatieHill\u2019s soon-to-be ex,\u201d Gaetz wrote on Twitter on October 24. \u201cWho among us would look perfect if every ex leaked every photo/text?\u201d\n\n\u201cI serve on Armed Services with Katie and while we frequently disagree on substance, she is always well-prepared, focused and thoughtful,\u201d Gaetz continued.", "description": "Hill and her husband are going through an acrimonious divorce and Hill has maintained that he provided nude photos to the media in order to harm her career.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Matthew Continetti", "Ramesh Ponnuru", "Rich Lowry", "Ben Shapiro", "Dan Mclaughlin", "Kevin D.
