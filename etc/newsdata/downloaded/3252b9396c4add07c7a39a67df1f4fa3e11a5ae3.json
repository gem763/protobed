This is The Trailer.\n\nPresident Trump arrives at a rally in Lake Charles, La., on Friday. (Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nEvery four years, the third fundraising quarter gives us a presidential primary gut check. We learn who has tapped out their biggest donors, who has succeeded in creating an online donor base, and which candidates are living up, or down, to their hype.\n\nThis quarter offered mixed news for both parties. Most of the Democrats running competitive presidential bids actually raised more than they had three months ago, breaking the old pattern from the days before massive online donations. Republicans, who say that the impeachment push fired up their base, have only a few days of the quarter to reflect that. They're raising less than many Democrats they want to beat, but they're in the hunt. And the left-wing Democrats who changed their party in 2018 have seen everything from breakout fundraising for new challengers to flops that will please the party leaders, who want as little disruption as possible on the way to 2020.\n\nTrump led the field \u2026 but Democrats, combined, continued to outraise him. The president who once eschewed big fundraising events has continued to break records. As his campaign announced weeks ago, the reelection effort and its joint fundraising with the Republican National Committee combined for $125 million; the president's own campaign raised $97.8 million of that. The money has funded an ambitious grass-roots campaign operation, and increasingly it has been going to TV and digital ads designed to attract Trump-friendly (but infrequent) donors and to bash Joe Biden.\n\nBut for the second consecutive quarter, Democrats actually managed to raise more. Combined, the 17 candidates who are not self-funding their campaigns raised $119.3 million over the quarter. Tom Steyer, the self-funder, raised $2 million and put in more than $47 million of his own money. Even as the DNC continues to struggle to raise money, the party and its candidates are competitive with the incumbent president, a departure from what was happening at this point in 2003 and 2011, the last off-years when a president was seeking reelection.\n\nObviously, only one Democrat is going to get this nomination; maybe two of these Democrats will end up on the ticket, as happened in 2004 and 2008. Not everyone who threw a check to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is likely to become an excited Joe Biden donor, and vice versa. But the long legacy of 2016 is a growing number of Democrats ready to chip in small amounts to various candidates. That conditioning, which started after 2016, really matters; there are hundreds of thousands of liberals happily giving online when they see something they like. Sanders's campaign has made the most of it, as it's the only one that got more donors in the quarter than Trump's. Put together, the Democrats lapped the president with small donors.\n\nNot many people are donating to the president's primary challengers. That might not be a surprise. After all, what kind of future in Republican politics awaits someone who donates to an anti-Trump campaign? But the combined fundraising haul for William Weld, Mark Sanford and Joe Walsh, three Republicans all with more than 20 years of political experience, was $647,000. If the three of them were running as a Democratic candidate, they'd be running 16th in the cash race, ahead of Tim Ryan (who raised $425,731) and Joe Sestak (who raised $374,000).\n\nJoe Biden has a war chest problem. The former vice president has been flat in polling for the past few weeks, with little sign that the president's attacks on him have stuck. Why are Democrats increasingly worried about him? Because of his fundraising \u2014 fourth overall for the quarter ($15.7 million) with less cash on hand than four of his rivals. Sanders had $33.7 million left to spend; Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) had $25.7 million; South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg had $23.4 million; and Sen. Kamala D. Harris had $10.5 million.\n\nBiden had just $9 million in the bank, less than anyone who has led in the polls at this point in the recent history of Democratic primaries. Having sworn off \u201csuper PACs\u201d \u2014 a collective Democratic decision that has limited big-money impact on the race \u2014 Biden has no independent air cover as the president attacks him. And he does not have the cushion that Hillary Clinton used in 2008 and 2016 to build robust post-Iowa operations for unexpectedly long primaries.\n\nEmbattled House Democrats are stacking up cash. There are 31 Democrats in the House whose districts were won in 2016 by Trump. Thirty of those Democrats are seeking reelection. Twenty-two of them support the impeachment inquiry. It's those 22 who have been under particular pressure from Republicans, who argue that they cannot run in 2020 saying they tried to find common ground.\n\nBut those 22 Democrats are seriously raking it in. Together they've raised more than $16 million, in districts that range from suburbs trending away from the president ($712,000 for New Jersey's Mikie Sherrill) to largely rural districts that trended away from Democrats in 2016 ($463,631 for Iowa's Abby Finkenauer). None of them got out-fundraised by Republican challengers, though some came close \u2014 possible opponents for Rep. Xochitl Torres Small of New Mexico and Rep. Max Rose of New York raised more than half a million dollars each.\n\nLiberal Democratic challengers are doing well in safe seats \u2014 not swing seats. Left-wing groups such as Justice Democrats started this cycle with a big but strategic goal: Replace as many incumbents as possible in deep blue districts. They've largely filled out that slate, and their star candidates had strong quarters. Ohio's Morgan Harper raised $323,000, besting Rep. Joyce Beatty, who raised $247,323. (Beatty, like every incumbent under fire, leads the challenger in cash on hand.) Texas's Jessica Cisneros raised $310,000, while Rep. Henry Cuellar raised $376,000. Insurgent candidates don't expect to outraise incumbents \u2014 New York's Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was lapped by Joe Crowley, on the way to beating him. But so far, they're competitive.\n\nThe same can't be said for challengers in races that Democrats are nervous about winning. In Colorado, John Hickenlooper raised $2.1 million over the quarter; his closest competitor in the primary, Andrew Romanoff, raised about one-quarter of that. That happens to be one of the states Democrats must win if they're to control the Senate in 2021, and there's not a ton of donor interest, yet, in a competitive primary.\n\nIt's the same story in other competitive Senate races. In Maine, where national Democrats have already endorsed legislator Sara Gideon as their challenger to Sen. Susan Collins, Gideon raised $3.2 million over the quarter. That wasn't just better than Collins \u2014 it was 30 times more than Betsy Sweet, her leading liberal challenger, who raised just $102,000. In Iowa, where Democrats have anointed real estate company president Theresa Greenfield, she raised $1.1 million, actually putting her ahead of Sen. Joni Ernst. Attorney Kimberley Graham, who's running as a Medicare-for-all supporter, raised a paltry $23,116. That's not good for Republicans, who are trying to bloody up Democrats by intervening in their primaries and have actually bought ads on Graham's behalf. (They portray her as \u201ctoo liberal for Iowa,\u201d a common tactic to raise the name recognition of a weak candidate.)\n\nRepublicans are trailing in some key Senate races, with three exceptions. The Republican path to holding or expanding their Senate majority is simple: hold every seat and try to flip Alabama, Michigan and Minnesota. Just one of those states yielded good news, as Michigan's John James, who raised $12.4 million for his 2018 Senate run, raised $3.1 million for the quarter to $2.5 million for Sen. Gary Peters. In 2018, James remained outspent by Sen. Debbie Stabenow; at the moment, Peters has $6.3 million on hand to $3.9 million for the Republican.\n\nBut in Alabama and Minnesota, Sen. Doug Jones and Sen. Tina Smith continued to outpace Republican challengers. In Arizona, Kentucky, Iowa and Maine, Democrats bested Republican incumbents in fundraising. The president's party isn't dominating the Senate dollar chase like Democrats did two years ago, when no incumbent Democrat \u2014 not even the four who lost \u2014 trailed in off-year fundraising.\n\nThe better news for Republicans came in Colorado, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina (three states the party expects to be competitive and one it doesn't), where incumbents kept their advantages. But in Colorado, the combined Democratic field outpaced Sen. Cory Gardner (he raised more than Hickenlooper, but less than all Democrats) and in North Carolina, where Sen. Thom Tillis faces a conservative primary challenge, he only narrowly outraised Democrat Cal Cunningham.\n\nRepublicans remain well positioned to hold the Senate. Several seats that they picked up in 2014 have yet to attract strong Democratic challengers. No Democrats running in Alaska, Arkansas, Montana and South Dakota raised more than six figures. But so far, between House and Senate races, Democrats are showing more desire to spread their money around, and Republicans are focused more on the race for president. That could change as impeachment heats up, but it's not what might have been expected when the crowded Democratic primary began.\n\nREADING LIST\n\n\u201cHow Bernie Sanders scored a coup and won the backing of Ocasio-Cortez and Omar,\u201d by Sean Sullivan and Chelsea Janes\n\nThe backstory of a big endorsement, which involves a Las Vegas hospital bed.\n\n\u201cThe night of the mad moderates,\u201d by Osita Nwanevu\n\nThis wasn't the first debate where centrist Democrats got rowdy, but it was the loudest.\n\n\u201cDemocrats donated more than $700 million in 2019 through ActBlue, officials say,\u201d by Michelle Ye Hee Lee\n\nThe continuing liberal gold rush, up and down ballot.\n\n\u201cBeto O'Rourke 2020 has been worse than useless,\u201d by Eric Levitz\n\nThere's a lot of left-wing and liberal anger about how the Texan's campaign has gone, and this column boils it down.\n\nDEMS IN DISARRAY\n\nPete Buttigieg speaks to supporters at Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa, on Wednesday. (Bryon Houlgrave/Des Moines Register/AP)\n\nSince Tuesday night's debate, when Pete Buttigieg made his most forceful case yet against Medicare-for-all, the mayor's many left-wing critics have been asking what happened. Not onstage \u2014 before that.\n\nButtigieg, who has been rising in national Democratic politics since 2017, had repeatedly suggested that he supported \u201cMedicare-for-all,\u201d in some form or another. In February 2018, he responded to the left-wing People's Summit's Twitter account with a \u201cpledge\u201d of sorts: \u201cI, Pete Buttigieg, politician, do henceforth and forth with declare, most affirmatively and indubitably, unto the ages, that I do favor Medicare-for-all, as I do favor any measure that would help get all Americans covered.\u201d\n\nThis February , shortly after he announced an exploratory committee, Buttigieg tweeted a photo of a restaurant bill that someone had scrawled \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d onto, with another message of his own: \u201cOn it.\u201d And not long after, during the battery of TV interviews that helped turn him into a top-tier candidate, Buttigieg told a skeptical \u201cMorning Joe\u201d panel that one single government insurance plan was really the midpoint between \u201cgovernment-run health care\u201d and the laissez-faire conservative plan.\n\n\u201cThe compromise position is a single-payer system, where you have private doctors, but a public payer,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cWe've got to stop allowing the right to move the goal posts and characterize the center of the debate.\u201d\n\nButtigieg is now one of the primary opponents of the House and Senate's Medicare-for-all legislation, which would replace all private health insurance with a tax-financed, expanded Medicare system. But Buttigieg has also been consistent: He has called single-payer the eventual goal of \u201cMedicare-for-all who want it,\u201d which would create a \u201cglide path\u201d to the system that advocates simply call \u201cMedicare-for-all.\u201d\n\nHow can both positions be true? Because \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d is both a specific piece of legislation and a slogan. Because Medicare is popular, everyone in politics \u2014 from democratic socialists to Republicans trying to dismantle the Affordable Care Act \u2014 have built their arguments around it. And because several different ideas would actually bring more people into the Medicare system, voters \u2014 even attentive voters \u2014 have been liberal in what they consider \u201cMedicare-for-all.\u201d\n\nAdvocates for the legislation have been stricter. Michael Lighty, who spent two decades advocating for Medicare-for-all with National Nurses United, said Buttigieg\u2019s initial statements were encouraging. (National Nurses United runs the People\u2019s Summit, which had that dialogue with Buttigieg.) They came at a time when all sorts of Democrats \u2014 even some who had never supported single-payer health care \u2014 were holding up the banner.\n\n\u201cWe thought at the time that Mayor Pete was part of the effort, or at least the broad movement,\u201d Lighty said. \u201cWe did take him as a supporter of Medicare-for-all.\u201d\n\nAt that time, it seemed like nearly every top-tier Democrat was a supporter. The first Democrats to announce their candidacies for 2020 \u2014 Elizabeth Warren, Kamala D. Harris, Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Tulsi Gabbard, Bernie Sanders and Buttigieg \u2014 had either co-sponsored the Sanders legislation or vocally endorsed the policy. And that was just a few months after Barack Obama lumped Medicare-for-all into the \u201cgood new ideas\u201d coming from his party.\n\nBut over the course of the primary, the sheen fell off. One reason was a multimillion-dollar campaign by the Partnership for America\u2019s Health Care Future, a coalition of insurance groups that ran its first ads against Medicare-for-all in January. Days later, Harris appeared in a CNN town hall where host Jake Tapper pressed her on the text of Medicare-for-all legislation, which would make private insurance illegal if it competed with (as opposed to supplemented) Medicare.\n\n\u201cListen, the idea is that everyone gets access to medical care,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWho among us has not had that situation, where you got to wait for approval, and the doctor says, wait, I don\u2019t know if your insurance company is going to cover this? Let\u2019s eliminate that. Let\u2019s move on.\u201d\n\nHarris was caught flat-footed; Republicans quickly noted she had, indeed, called for eliminating private insurance, leading to a next-day cleanup where her campaign said she was open to \u201cmultiple paths\u201d to universal coverage. That was the first in a string of Democratic clarifications, which by the summer meant that most of Medicare-for-all\u2019s co-sponsors in the presidential race did not actually support the full text of the bill.\n\nButtigieg\u2019s statements came during that period of confusion. Neither he nor the others abandoned the term \u201cMedicare-for-all,\u201d but he began to redefine it, as a goal. In the future, Americans might enjoy universal Medicare. If they did, it would be because Democrats let everyone buy into the system, and Americans \u201cvoted with their feet\u201d to drop their private plans and adopt Medicare.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to Medicare-for-all, I believe in universal coverage,\u201d he said in an April interview with New England\u2019s WBUR. \u201cI believe in getting to a Medicare-for-all destination, which is where I want us to go. I think whenever a politician says those words, we also have a responsibility to explain how we get there. I don't think it's as simple as just declaring that it will be so.\u201d\n\nBy June, that meant that just three 2020 Democrats supported Sanders\u2019s proposal as written: Sanders himself, Elizabeth Warren and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio. And that disturbed Medicare-for-all advocates, who don\u2019t see a \u201cglide path\u201d as the same thing as their plan.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a false choice, because it preserves the multi-payer system that\u2019s responsible for administrative waste,\u201d said Lighty, who supports Sanders. \u201cThe bottom line is that the insurance companies don\u2019t want to pay claims. If you do a \u2018glide path\u2019 you\u2019ve still got that problem and you\u2019ve got premiums people may or may not be able to afford.\u201d\n\nIn the last few weeks, the private insurance debate has actually given way to a more confusing one: whether Medicare-for-all would raise \u201cmiddle-class taxes.\u201d The program\u2019s advocates, like Sanders, point out that even conservative cost estimates find that a single-payer system costs less than a mixed private-public system. But in the new system, premiums and co-pays would be replaced by taxes. And since even the Medicare-for-all legislation does not specify how high taxes would go \u2014 there\u2019s a separate \u201cwhite paper\u201d of possible payment methods \u2014 opponents have focused on the risk of higher tax bills.\n\nMedicare-for-all advocates are baffled by the debate, which often ignores what patients would not be paying and emphasizes what they would. In every Democrat's health-care plan, insurance costs money. On one hand are Democrats who want, someday, to achieve universal health insurance that people would pay premiums for \u2014 partially subsidized by taxpayers, depending on need. On the other are Democrats who want, someday sooner, to achieve universal health insurance for which people would pay taxes.\n\nButtigieg\u2019s case against Medicare-for-all was aimed at Warren, who, unlike Sanders, won\u2019t answer the question about whether taxes will go up. She pivots, talking about the total cost for middle-class Americans every time, and pledging that she'll drive it down, even as more than 100 million health insurance plans would be replaced. The argument is less about the future of health insurance than about which candidate can explain this stuff in a way that doesn't hurt them \u2014 something the term \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d was supposed to be doing.\n\nIMPEACHMENT WATCH\n\nThe latest on the impeachment inquiry:\n\nAD WATCH\n\nEddie Rispone, \u201cPro.\u201d The wealthy business executive who made it to next month\u2019s runoff against Gov. John Bel Edwards pitched himself as Louisiana\u2019s own President Trump: a successful guy who was tired of politicians. His first post-primary ads consist entirely of Trump delivering the message, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to vote John Bel Edwards out.\u201d Every race for governor this year is taking place in a deep red state where Hillary Clinton won less than 40 percent of the vote; the Louisiana race, in particular, has seen Republicans try to force a referendum on Trump.\n\nJohn Bel Edwards, \u201cThis Election.\u201d The Democrat is trying to do something no incumbent from his party has done: win a second term despite being forced into a runoff. His message is the same party-blurring one that he used all year, rephrased to target his GOP opponent. \u201cWe have a choice to make,\u201d he says. \u201cLet Eddie Rispone drag us back to the deficits and cuts to health care and education of Bobby Jindal, or continue moving forward and investing in our future?\u201d Jindal, a once-rising star and former governor who left office with a shattered reputation and busted state budget, remains the focus of the Democrats' campaign; Republicans point out that he hasn't been on a ballot since 2011.\n\nTate Reeves, \u201cTeachers.\u201d Like Kentucky\u2019s Matt Bevin, Mississippi\u2019s lieutenant governor has struggled to win some independent voters because of a conservative policy priority: facing down teachers in a series of budget negotiations. Earlier this year, Reeves signed off on a smaller pay raise than teachers wanted. But it was a raise nonetheless, and Reeves promises here to keep rising wages \u201cto the southern average,\u201d with no tax hikes. \u201cMost teachers don\u2019t do it for the money, but we\u2019ve got to pay them more,\u201d Reeves says.\n\nJim Hood, \u201cCan't Trust.\u201d The new Reeves ad has been remixed by his Democratic opponent, who draws attention to the details of that pay raise deal. \u201cLast-minute promises on education from a politician we can't trust,\u201d a female narrator warns. \"Tate Reeves has repeatedly killed teacher pay raises.\u201d\n\nYou are reading The Trailer, the newsletter that brings the campaign trail to your inbox three times a week.

Two years ago, in the aftermath of the GOP\u2019s botched efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Medicare-for-all enjoyed a 12-point advantage in public support. After months of friendly fire from moderate Democrats, it remains popular, but less so, something opponents are taking as a cue for the die-hards to move on.\n\nThe wrinkle: Medicare-for-all is still popular, just less popular than the \u201cpublic option.\u201d Fully 71 percent of Democrats, and 51 percent of independents, support Medicare-for-all.
