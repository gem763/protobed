For big companies are not used to being turned on in public by other blue chip firms.\n\n\n\nIntervention: Alison Kennedy locked horns with Barclays earlier this year after refusing to back its remuneration report\n\nKennedy\u2019s intervention was an all-too-rare example of a blue chip investor raising their head above the parapet and using their clout to stick up for shareholders \u2013 in this case Barclays investors fed up of the bank\u2019s spluttering performance and its decision to dish out more in bonuses than in dividends.\n\nIt also raised the profile of the unglamorous \u2013 but crucial \u2013 world of corporate governance.\n\n\n\nKennedy is governance and stewardship director at Standard Life Investments, which runs \u00a3195billion for savers around the world. Her job is to interview directors of companies which Standard Life invests in and gauge whether they are performing well, behaving appropriately \u2013 and whether they are paying their staff more than they deserve.\n\nKennedy, who joined Standard Life a decade ago after a spell as a fund manager, appears a little bemused by the attention her very public spat with Barclays received and believes more institutional investors should be prepared to follow suit.\n\n\n\n\u2018I think it does surprise us a little that there aren\u2019t more people that do that. Although it does take a little bit of work and time. Taking a day out when absolutely snowed under with voting is difficult.\u2019\n\nAlison and her team have about 1,500 company annual general meetings across the world to prepare for and vote on. As well as deciding whether to back firms\u2019 bonuses, she plays an instrumental role in deciding whether to re-elect board directors and support other key decisions which affect shareholders.\n\n\n\nShe says: \u2018Our policy is to engage with a company when we are considering voting against. If we feel there are issues and we believe it\u2019s in our clients\u2019 best interests we will attend and speak at the AGMs.\n\n\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not something we want to be doing regularly.\n\n\n\n\u2018With Barclays we were looking at how profits were divided among employees and shareholders against the background of a bank that was not doing well \u2013 particularly in the investment bank. We were concerned that the bank\u2019s reputation would be damaged by the decision that they took [on pay].\u2019\n\n\n\nOn Walker\u2019s criticism of her for raising Standard Life\u2019s concerns about Barclays publicly, Kennedy acknowledges that it is often best to try to influence change \u2018behind the scenes\u2019. She attended only two AGMs this year, one being Barclays and the other the mining company Vedanta, which has come under fire for alleged human rights and environmental breaches as well as tax avoidance.\n\n\n\nKennedy says she did everything by the book with Barclays and that the intervention came only after a series of private conversations with the bank went unheeded.\n\n\n\nShe says diplomatically: \u2018The AGM was pretty heated. I think he [Walker] was obviously under some pressure on that day, and maybe that contributed to his comments, but we were quite happy we had gone through our normal process.\u2019\n\n\n\nKennedy says she has been encouraged by major reforms at Barclays introduced since the AGM, including efforts to reform its culture.\n\n\n\nOne company which could do with a stern word or two from Kennedy is Tesco, which Standard Life Investments has a small stake in.\n\n\n\nThe supermarket behemoth is reeling from the biggest scandal in its 95-year history, after admitting it overstated its profit forecasts by \u00a3250million. Several investigations have been launched into whether this was a deliberate attempt by the struggling retailer to cook the books.\n\n\n\nTesco demonstrated the shoddy corporate governance you might associate with a smaller, tin pot organisation \u2013 not one of the UK\u2019s biggest blue chip companies. The money wrongly included in the accounts relates to fees due from big brands to ensure their products go on prominent shelves.\n\n\n\nKennedy says Standard Life Investments had some misgivings over the lack of retail experience of some senior executives at Tesco, including its chairman Sir Richard Broadbent \u2013 a former senior civil servant and former deputy chairman of Barclays.\n\n\n\nShe adds: \u2018I think it was a real shock to everyone. A real surprise.\n\n\n\n\u2018We obviously had noticed there was a lack of retail experience on the board. Clearly there is some debate in the press about the position of the chairman. I think when we get to the stage when there is a new chairman \u2013 having just appointed a CEO that is not a retailer [Unilever veteran David Lewis] \u2013 it would make sense that any new chairman probably should be a retailer.\u2019 Tesco has since moved to address criticism about the experience of its board, hiring former Ikea boss Mikael Ohlsson and Richard Cousins of catering giant Compass as non executive directors.\n\n\n\nKennedy believes there are also questions about the auditors PwC, which has vetted Tesco\u2019s books for more than 30 years. \u2018There is another issue around the role of the auditors. PwC have been auditors since 1983, which is quite a long time.\u2019\n\n\n\nReferring to the fee arrangements with suppliers , she says: \u2018Investors and brokers will want to know a lot more about these kind of arrangements going forward \u2013 not just with Tesco, but with all of the big retailers.\u2019\n\n\n\nOn the lack of women in UK boardrooms, Kennedy believes that there should be more diversity but not by making \u2018token\u2019 appointments or introducing quotas.\n\n\n\nShe says she meets many female company secretaries but only around a third of board directors she meets are women.\n\n\n\n\u2018We would like more diversity \u2013 more diversity of opinion and diversity of perspective. Women make decisions in a different way to men, and that\u2019s important in a group.\n\n\n\n\u2018But it\u2019s not just about having more women.\n\n\n\n\u2018If a company is very international do they have people that understand the culture they operate in?\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s also about diversity of age. If it\u2019s a company that is in the internet or media, the chances are you would want someone who is younger than 50 on that board.\u2019\n\n\n\nShe adds: \u2018We\u2019re not really in favour of quotas, that\u2019s not our stance, but we want to see that companies are setting themselves aspirational targets and we want to monitor their progress towards those targets.\u2019\n\n\n\nBut the drive for more equality is not without risk, says Kennedy.\n\n\n\n\u2018To be honest, we\u2019ve seen one or two appointments that you think hmm, I\u2019m not sure about that \u2013 that does look a bit token where there has been a woman appointed to a board. That is a concern because it\u2019s really important that we get the right quality of people.\u2019\n\n\n\nWhen not grilling board directors, Kennedy is a keen golfer and hill walker. She has climbed an impressive 190 of the 284 Munros \u2013 mountains in Scotland over 3,000ft high.\n\n\n\n\u2018It\u2019s taken me about 30 years.\u2019 she says. \u2018I\u2019m hoping I get through them by the time I\u2019m 80.\u2019\n\n\n\nFew would bet against her achieving her goal.\n\n\n\n\u00f7 Dear reader, you may have noticed that the No vote at the recent Scottish referendum is conspicuous by its absence from this interview.\n\n\n\nThis may seem strange, as I am in Scotland carrying out an interview at an Edinburgh-based firm \u2013 which attracted headlines by loudly declaring its intention to move its headquarters south of the border in the event of a Yes vote.\n\n", "description": "Alison Kennedy caused a stir when she stood up at Barclays' annual general meeting in April and announced Standard Life would vote to reject its pay policy.", "authors": ["James Salmon For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
