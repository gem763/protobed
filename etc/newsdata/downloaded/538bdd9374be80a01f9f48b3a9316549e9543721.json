The bill would not affect diet soda and other drinks with artificial sweeteners, beverages with milk as the primary ingredient, alcohol, and all-natural juices.\n\nThe legislation is aimed at improving health in a city where residents in some low-income neighborhoods in Northeast and Southeast struggle with high rates of obesity and diabetes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOn average, children consume 30 gallons of sugary drinks a year. That\u2019s a bathtub full. It\u2019s a huge health risk,\u201d said council member Brianne K. Nadeau (D-Ward 1), the bill\u2019s author. \u201cWe need a little bit of stick in addition to the carrot.\u201d\n\nNew study links all soda \u2014 diet or not \u2014 to early death\n\nSan Francisco, Berkeley, Oakland and Albany in the San Francisco Bay area impose similar taxes on distributors, as do Philadelphia, Seattle and Boulder, Colo. Boulder has the highest sugary drink tax at 2 cents per ounce, according to the Tax Policy Center.\n\nThe new D.C. bill comes days after the city added an additional 2 percent sales tax on soft drinks. If passed, the excise tax would replace that additional sales tax.\n\nAD\n\nResearchers say a higher sales tax isn\u2019t likely to make customers pick up a bottle of water instead of a Coke because it\u2019s charged at the register, after the customer has already selected the beverage. An excise tax is imposed on distributors, who pass it onto consumers by raising the sticker price of the item.\n\nAD\n\nWhy the British soda tax may work better than American ones\n\n\u201cIf you want to reduce consumption, the shelf price needs to go up,\u201d said Kristine Madsen, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley School of Public Health who has studied the soda tax. \u201cWith a sales tax, it doesn\u2019t change their decision at the moment. They are just paying at the checkout line at that point.\u201d\n\nHer research found sugary drink consumption in Berkeley\u2019s low-income neighborhoods declined in half since the first-in-the-nation excise tax took effect in 2015.\n\nAD\n\nRevenue from the proposed tax increase in the District would be used to fund early-childhood education, a program that provides vouchers for free produce to low-income residents as well as grants for outdoor recreation.\n\nAn industry group said those programs should not be funded through a regressive tax that burdens consumers.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe support the programs and initiatives included in Councilwoman Nadeau\u2019s proposal, but there are better ways to fund them than with a massive tax on working families, small business owners and their employees,\u201d said Ellen Valentino of the D.C. Beverage Association in a prepared statement. \u201cWith the District\u2019s record-setting budget surplus \u2014 aided by the sales tax increase on beverages effective just last week \u2014 another tax on everyday beverages like juices, teas, and sports drinks is not needed.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe soda industry and other opponents have spent millions fighting soda taxes around the country, calling them unfair to consumers and small businesses. They\u2019ve racked up recent \u00adsuccesses.\n\nChicago repealed a soda tax just two months after it took effect. California banned any new sugary drink taxes, and Michigan, Washington state and Arizona passed similar preemption laws.\n\nAD\n\nAnother recent study found the deterrent effect of sugary drink taxes can be limited.\n\nResearchers who studied the implementation of the tax in Philadelphia found sales declined by nearly half. But the net decline was closer to 20 percent when taking into account a spike in sales immediately outside city limits.\n\nAD\n\nThat issue is salient in the District, where nearby Maryland has no soda excise tax.\n\nHow D.C. smokers are responding to a significant tax hike\n\n\u201cThis could lead to a lot of loss of sales at retailers inside of D.C. and could hinder D.C.\u2019s ability to raise tax revenues if a lot of customers are avoiding the tax that way,\u201d said Anna Tuchman, a marketing professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University who studied the Philadelphia tax.\n\nAn earlier bill to add an excise tax to soda sales in the District failed in 2010. But advocates say they\u2019re more organized this time and have the experiences of other cities and research to help make their case. Eight of 13 members of the D.C. Council have signed onto the latest tax legislation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStuart Anderson, a longtime organizer in Southeast Washington, said sugar consumption is heavy in his community because of relentless advertising, a dearth of grocery stores and low prices.\n\nHe\u2019s helping to organize a new group called Don\u2019t Mute Our Health \u2014 a reference to the Don\u2019t Mute D.C. movement that formed from a dispute over a store playing loud go-go music in the gentrified Shaw neighborhood.\n\nOne of the group\u2019s first campaigns is to discourage sugar consumption, arguing that poor diet is linked to violence and children acting out in school.\n\n\u201cSugar is the culprit,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cPeople say, \u2018Oh you\u2019re brainwashing us.\u2019 But you\u2019ve been brainwashed, and we are trying to deprogram you.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn one video, artist T\u00e9 Speight recites a spoken-word poem decrying disproportionate advertising in black communities.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSo every time we turn on our TV screens, they\u2019ll be sure to advertise it right on our BETs: cheap sugary drinks we can afford with our EBTs,\u201d Speight said.\n\nNadeau plans to formally introduce the soda tax bill at the council meeting Tuesday with Chairman Phil Mendelson (D), Mary M. Cheh (D-Ward 3), Trayon White Sr. (D-Ward 8), Brandon T. Todd (D-Ward 4), Charles Allen (D-Ward 6), and at-large independents David Grosso and Elissa Silverman.\n\nD.C. ethics agency failed to investigate whistleblower complaint, audit says\n\nThousands of new e-scooters could come to the District by January\n\nD.C. lawmakers want the city to stop sharing information with ICE\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news\n\nAD", "description": "Legislation favored by a majority of the D.C.
