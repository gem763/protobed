To avoid him she walked into Mayer Park, however the man followed her and asked for her help, saying he\u2019d lost an item.\n\nHe then revealed he had a knife, and pushed her to the ground, sexually assaulting the woman.\n\nAccording to Detective Acting Inspector Janet Mitchell of Victoria Police, the woman managed to grab the knife during the assault, using it to fight the attacker off.\n\n\u201cShe believes that when she took the knife and went to defend herself that she made contact with the offender and we believe there is blood at the scene,\u201d Mitchell told ABC.\n\nThe woman then fled with her dog, seeking help from a driver near the scene. She was hospitalised overnight, and the park was closed to visitors until 7am this morning.\n\n\u201cI think the woman was very brave to act the way she did. She obviously made an assessment and a decision on how she would handle it and it turned out very well for her,\u201d said Mitchell.\n\nPolice are still looking to identify the attacker \u2013 he is described as Caucasian, in his early 20s and of medium height with brown hair. He was wearing loose pants and a hoodie, and may be looking for medical attention regarding a stab wound.\n\nVictoria Police wish to speak to this man over the disturbing sexual assault of a woman at Mayer Park, Thornbury. He is likely injured (stab wound inflicted by victim).
