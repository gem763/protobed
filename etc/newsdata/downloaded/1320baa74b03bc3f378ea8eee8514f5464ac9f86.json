The audio is intoxicating.\n\nHere\u2019s the quick summary of the proceedings: Yilek on Tuesday aggregated a story from Bloomberg News claiming that President Trump had considered replacing acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney with Conway, counselor to the president. Trump later denied the report, as if that\u2019s relevant. In contextualizing Conway\u2019s alleged candidacy for a promotion, Yilek noted that she had unique circumstances tugging at her professional life:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nConway has been in the middle of Trump\u2019s barbs with her husband, George, a conservative lawyer who frequently makes headlines for his criticism of the president. George Conway said earlier this month that White House aides should resign unless they can \u2018have some moderating or blunting effect\u2019 on Trump. He refused to discuss his wife, who has worked for Trump since the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nIt was that passage that Conway couldn\u2019t abide, so she rang up Yilek. A key part:\n\nSo I just am wondering why in God\u2019s earth you would need to mention anything about George Conway\u2019s tweets in an article that talks about me as possibly being chief of staff. Other than it looks to me like there\u2019s no original reporting here, you just read Twitter and other people\u2019s stuff, which I guess is why you don\u2019t pick up the phone when people call from the White House because if it\u2019s not on Twitter or it\u2019s not on cable TV, it\u2019s not real.\n\nThere\u2019s so much delicious filling in that polemical empanada \u2014 generational haughtiness about trends in info-tech, reportorial nitpicking, \u201cwondering\u201d as camouflage for bullying, and so on. The counselor goes on to ask Yilek, in essence, to justify her professional existence. The Washington Examiner identifies Yilek as a \u201cbreaking news reporter,\u201d which served as Conway\u2019s jumping-off point: \u201cI\u2019m just trying to give you a chance to explain why you think what you wrote qualifies as breaking news or reporting,\u201d said Conway.\n\nAs the White House aide continued complaining, Yilek projected a quiet confidence that clearly unsettled Conway, who was forced to declare that she was a \u201cpowerful woman.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t pull the crap where you\u2019re trying to undercut another woman based on who she\u2019s married to. He gets his power through me, if you haven\u2019t noticed. Not the other way around,\u201d said Conway.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe call wound down, and Conway returned to her theme: \u201cI\u2019m not caught in the middle of anything except trying to understand somebody whose title is breaking news reporter, what that means.\u201d\n\nTo which Yilek responded, \u201cLook, I\u2019ve got to go. I\u2019ve got a meeting to run to.\u201d\n\nHow did we ever get the privilege of listening in on this back-and-forth? Well, the Examiner transcript makes clear that Conway\u2019s assistant, Tom Joannou, requested an off-the-record chat. After an exchange of some unknown duration, Joannou put Conway on the line. According to the transcript: \u201cWhen Conway came onto the line, without any agreement that a conversation with her would be off the record, the conversation reverted to being on the record, as per Washington Examiner policy and standard journalistic practice.\u201d One complication with this explanation: At one point in the exchange, Yilek asks Conway if she like to \u201cdispute that on the record? I would be happy to put that in my story.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe that as Conway berates and scolds and scorns Yilek, she has any expectation that her words will eventually be conveyed to the public via audio and a handy transcript. \u201cI didn\u2019t say the call was on or off the record 'cause I could care less. She must have thought it was off the record because then she asked, quote, \u2018Would you like to put any of this on the record,\u2019\u201d Conway said Friday. She laid out her side of the story in a fine-print tweet:\n\nThe false tweet below makes my point about how dangerous it is to characterize someone else\u2019s intentions, feelings, or state of mind, even if it\u2019s for clicks and kicks. https://t.co/v6df2aoU3T pic.twitter.com/B3Qzzra0uW \u2014 Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) October 24, 2019\n\nHere\u2019s the position of the Examiner:\n\nIn comments to reporters at the White House on Friday, Conway said of Yilek: \u201cShe\u2019s not like the rest of you, she\u2019s not here at the White House doing the beat, out here asking questions,\u201d said Conway.\n\nAD\n\nExactly!\n\nIn her status as a breaking news reporter, Yilek owed nothing to Conway. She didn\u2019t have to worry about losing access or having her hard pass revoked or her questions ignored. Here\u2019s a good example of why the White House press corps needs outsiders to supplement its work. Via Yilek and the Examiner, we now have a good idea of how Conway seeks to shape media coverage of the White House.\n\nAD\n\nAnd we also get to see how she recovers from it, too. With great savvy: \u201cThere wasn\u2019t one thing I said in that call that I haven\u2019t said publicly,\u201d she told reporters on Friday. That\u2019s perhaps a reference to her stated misgivings about speaking for her husband. In a memorable incident from April 2018, Conway tore into CNN\u2019s Dana Bash for asking her what was up with her husband\u2019s tweets attacking the president. \u201cWe\u2019re now going to talk about other people\u2019s \u2014 people\u2019s spouses and significant others, just because they either work in the White House or at CNN?\u201d ripped Conway. And in a feature by The Post\u2019s Ben Terris, Conway indeed provided an earlier version of the power-provider line: \u201cNobody knows who I am because of my husband. People know of my husband because of me,\u201d she said.\n\nAD\n\nOne unexplained wrinkle is how this \u201cpowerful woman\u201d found time in her day to rail against someone whom she holds in such low regard. Yilek\u2019s alleged offense, after all, was merely to note that Conway\u2019s husband is one of Trump\u2019s most vociferous critics, an awkward situation that would become yet more awkward if she were elevated to chief of staff. \u201cI feel there\u2019s a part of him that thinks I chose Donald Trump over him,\u201d Kellyanne Conway told Terris. \u201cWhich is ridiculous. One is my work and one is my marriage.\u201d\n\nWhereas Trump bullies people with bluster and froth, Conway does so with precision and calm. In her discussion with reporters Friday, she said, \u201cI still didn\u2019t get an answer from her, which was the essential question, which was: Why do you call yourself a breaking news reporter if you\u2019re not writing breaking news and you\u2019re not even being a reporter?\u201d Like her boss, she can\u2019t let go.\n\nAD\n\nAnd when asked about what the Examiner regards as a threat to investigate reporters\u2019 personal lives, Conway goes all-in on Trumpian gaslighting and bravado: \u201cI never threatened anyone. Don\u2019t use those words \u2026 No, no, no \u2026 If I threaten somebody, you\u2019ll know it. If I threaten someone, you\u2019ll know it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Whereas Trump bullies people with bluster and froth, Conway does so with precision and calm.", "authors": ["Erik Wemple", "Media Critic With A Focus On The Ups", "Downs", "Downs Of The Cable-News Industry.", "Media Critic"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/TjLGRa6BgS2TsefL9rt_ceBszOI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HKPMN4XXJEI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
