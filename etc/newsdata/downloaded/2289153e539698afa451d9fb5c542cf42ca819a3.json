REUTERS/Brendan Mcdermid/File Photo\n\nNeither antagonist, however, showed much desire to discuss the many issues dividing them, from Iran\u2019s reawakening nuclear programme to the U.S. sanctions squeezing the Iranian economy.\n\nThe absence of dialogue - let alone a presidential meeting - shows neither is yet willing to abandon core elements of policy: the U.S. belief that pressure will bring Iran to its knees, and Iran\u2019s refusal to capitulate to U.S. duress.\n\nAs a result, European and Gulf officials expect Washington to keep tightening its vice on Iran\u2019s economy and foresee more attacks in the Gulf - like the Sept. 14 strikes on Saudi oil facilities - that the West blames on Tehran despite its denials.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson teamed up on Tuesday to urge Iranian President Hassan Rouhani to meet U.S. President Donald Trump while they were all in New York this week for the U.N. General Assembly.\n\n\u201cIf he leaves the country without meeting with President Trump, this is a lost opportunity,\u201d Macron told Johnson in a rare three-way meeting with Rouhani caught on camera.\n\n\u201cYou need to be on the side of the swimming pool and jump at the same time,\u201d Johnson said, miming a jumping gesture to the Iranian president, who was wearing his habitual floor-length robe.\n\nIranian officials sniffed at the idea of Rouhani-Trump talks in New York, with one on Wednesday putting the odds at \u201czero.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe era of using pressure to bring a country to its knees is over,\u201d said a second Iranian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nThey also reiterated, in public and private, their demands that the United States return to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal that Trump abandoned last year and that it ease the sanctions he tightened in May to try to eliminate Iran\u2019s oil exports.\n\n\u201cThey walked out of the deal, imposed sanctions, tried to cut our oil exports, threatened other countries to stop helping us,\u201d said the second Iranian official. \u201cThen they talk about talks? No chance.\u201d\n\n\u2018UNSTABLE STATUS QUO\u2019\n\nIn the view of Western officials, Iran has struck back against U.S. sanctions through a series of attacks in the Gulf that have roiled oil markets.\n\nThe pre-dawn Sept. 14 drone and missile attacks on Saudi oil facilities followed earlier attacks on Saudi oil installations and on oil tankers in Gulf waters - widely blamed on Iran - and temporarily crippled much of the kingdom\u2019s production capacity.\n\nCritics argue that Trump\u2019s failure to respond militarily has convinced Tehran it can continue to strike with impunity.\n\n\u201cThe Iranians are still willing to take the risk involved in attacking oil facilities in Saudi Arabia since they understand that they will not exact a heavy price,\u201d said a Western intelligence source.\n\nThe one area where U.S. and Iranian officials signalled a willingness to talk, though it was unclear whether they actually did, was on the possibility of releasing prisoners from the other country.\n\nThe United States this week deported an Iranian woman who pleaded guilty to exporting restricted U.S. technology to Iran, but U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declined to discuss whether a U.S.-Iranian prisoner swap was in the offing.\n\nTrump, who basks in high-profile summits, had said he was willing to meet Rouhani in New York without preconditions, but the Saudi attacks upended the efforts by France\u2019s Macron to bring the U.S. and Iranian leaders together.\n\n\u201cThe Sept. 14 attacks were of such magnitude that it was a turning point,\u201d said a French diplomatic source.\n\nThe source described Iran\u2019s early September decision to take another step away from the nuclear deal by starting to develop centrifuges to speed up its uranium enrichment as \u201ca third knife attack\u201d on the 2015 agreement.\n\n\u201cThere was a little wiggle room before. That\u2019s even smaller now, but it still exists,\u201d he added.\n\nIran committed another breach of the fraying nuclear deal by enriching uranium with advanced centrifuges, a report by the U.N. nuclear watchdog policing the deal said on Thursday.\n\nA third Iranian official said a U.S.-Iranian negotiation was still possible, saying: \u201cIt is always darkest before the dawn.\u201d\n\nAnalysts, however, doubted one was likely anytime soon.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration keeps insisting that Iran is under pressure - which is certainly true. But Trump is under pressure as well, as Iran continues to attack U.S. and global interests and expands its nuclear programme in potentially dangerous ways,\u201d said Phil Gordon, who served at the State Department and U.S. National Security Council under then-President Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cIran has signalled in recent weeks that it is not prepared to simply cave to U.S. maximalist demands as Trump seems to have hoped,\u201d added Gordon, who is now at the Council on Foreign Relations think tank. \u201cSo now Trump has to decide if he\u2019s going to give in to some of Iran\u2019s demands - a major climbdown - or to accept the costs and risks of the unstable status quo.\u201d", "description": "Britain and France all but begged Iran to jump into the waters of a negotiation with the United States this week.", "authors": ["Parisa Hafezi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434396874&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q09P", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
