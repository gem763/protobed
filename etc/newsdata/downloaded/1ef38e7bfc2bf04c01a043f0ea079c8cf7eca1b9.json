That\u2019s what you call knowledge of a place? It\u2019s just crazy,\u201d Veyrat told France Inter.\n\nHis lawyer, Emmanuel Ravanas, told AFP Veyrat hoped the court would force Michelin to hand over documents \u201cto clarify the exact reasons\u201d justifying its decision. He said a court hearing had been set for 27 November in Nanterre, west of Paris.\n\n\u201cFor decades, Marc Veyrat has been used to having his cooking graded, evaluated and compared, and he knows quite well that you don\u2019t own a star for life \u2026 He accepts it all, as long as the criticism is accurate,\u201d Ravanas said.\n\nVeyrat, 69, made his name with his so-called \u201cbotanical\u201d cooking, employing the wild herbs gathered around his restaurants in his native Haute Savoie region.\n\nThis year, the chef, who is instantly recognisable in France for his signature wide-brimmed black Savoyard hat and smoke-tinted glasses, had tried to get Michelin to hand over the inspector notes or the bills proving they had indeed dined at his establishment.\n\nHe also claimed a new generation of editors at the guide were trying to make their names by attacking the pillars of French cuisine.\n\nBut in a statement, Michelin said it \u201cunderstands the disappointment for Mr Veyrat, whose talent no one contests, even if we regret his unreasonable persistence with his accusations\u201d.\n\nIt added: \u201cOur first duty is to tell consumers why we have changed our recommendation. We will carefully study his demands and respond calmly.\u201d\n\nVeyrat\u2019s third star for La Maison du Bois in 2018 capped a comeback after he was forced to give up cooking a decade ago following a serious skiing accident. He had previously won three stars for two other restaurants.\n\nThe intense strains of reaching cooking\u2019s highest spheres \u2013 and the financial effects of losing Michelin stars \u2013 have been highlighted in recent years by the suicides of several top chefs.\n\nThe French chef Bernard Loiseau shot himself in 2003 after a newspaper hinted his restaurant was about to lose its three-star status. And Beno\u00eet Violier killed himself in 2016, just months after his Swiss restaurant was named the best in the world in the La Liste ranking.", "description": "Marc Veyrat\u2019s La Maison des Bois lost its third star after, he says, an inspector suspected cheddar in a souffle", "authors": ["Agence France-Presse In Nanterre", "Dale Berning Sawa"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83a2de5c7d5a847b276ea4bb4ef94678dd3b77fe/0_145_3300_1981/master/3300.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a7566a0b3ed5105a92ba4261482be566", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
