Deron Winn via split decision (28-29, 29-28, 29-28)\n\nUpdated records: Stewart (11-4 MMA, 4-4 UFC), Winn (6-1 MMA, 1-1 UFC)\n\nKey stat: Stewart improved to 4-3 since he dropped to the UFC middleweight division in November 2017.\n\nStewart on the fight\u2019s key moment\n\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised with Deron because this guy said to me that he\u2019s going to throw hands for the first round and then wrestle. He didn\u2019t throw any hands, so I\u2019m not sure what that was about. But people talk and talk. I\u2019m over it. I want to keep showing what I can do. He reminded me a lot of myself when I first started, rushing out and making silly mistakes. But I\u2019m past that now and ready to make a run.\u201d\n\nStewart on trying to reach consistency\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said it for ages now: talk is talk. I have to show it, and I\u2019ve been showing it to people now. I have that split decision loss to Edmen (Shahbazyan), but that fight was close and I even think I took that fight. So I didn\u2019t really lose, which makes it five in a row now as far as I\u2019m concerned \u2013 so I\u2019m happy.\u201d\n\nStewart on what he wants next\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love to fight in London again. Let me fight in my hometown. Give me a chance to show how much I\u2019ve improved since the last time and put on a show for my fans. Big shoutout to my coaches and my wife to make this all possible. Without them, I\u2019d be nothing. So I want to keep putting on performances like this to make it all worth it.\u201d\n\nTo hear more from Stewart, check out the video of the full post-fight interview above.\n\nGallery Darren Stewart def.
