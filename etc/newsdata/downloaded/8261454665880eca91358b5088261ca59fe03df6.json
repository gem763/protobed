I had a few plays I want back. We had a few guys running open. Whatever it was, we can\u2019t put that pressure on our defense. They\u2019re a good football team and they have scary weapons. They\u2019re going to score points. \u2026 We have to put something together and squash it.\u201d\n\nKeenum tossed a 48-yard catch-and-run touchdown pass to Vernon Davis for Washington\u2019s first season\u2019s opening drive since 2004. He hit Terry McLaurin perfectly in stride on a deep pass for a 70-yard TD to give the Redskins a 17-0 lead early in the second quarter.\n\nBut the Redskins went three-and-out on four of their next five possessions until the last drive after the score was out of hand. They managed just 120 total yards in the second half, including 91 on the final drive.\n\n\u201cNot executing,\u201d left tackle Donald Penn said. \u2018We kind of beat ourselves. \u2026 But what we did, the future is bright. I am pretty excited about it and I can take that away.\u201d\n\nDerrius Guice made his Redskins debut after sitting out his rookie season following knee surgery and had 18 yards rushing on 10 carries. Guice\u2019s presence made four-time All-Pro and 2012 NFL MVP Adrian Peterson a bench player. Peterson was inactive after leading the team with 1,042 yards rushing last season.\n\nThe Redskins went with Guice, Chris Thompson and former Eagles back Wendell Smallwood. Gruden said the team needed the roster spot on special teams to cover Darren Sproles.\n\n\u201cThat was a tough deal for him I\u2019m sure, and for me as well, and for this football team,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cIt had to be done.\u201d\n\nGruden wouldn\u2019t commit to having Peterson active next week.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to wait and see numbers,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s a first-, second-down back and so is Derrius. Really where we have about 20 first downs a game and probably eight of those are passes and 12 of those might be runs. Derrius can handle those 12, so if we have a game where we think we can run the ball 55 times in a game in I-formation then, sure, I\u2019ll get him up.\u201d\n\nThe Redskins host the Dallas Cowboys next Sunday.\n\nKeenum\u2019s success - 35 of 40 for 380 yards and three TDs - was the bright spot on a day Washington missed a huge chance at an upset. McLaurin finished with five catches for 125 yards and Thompson caught seven balls for 68 yards.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about winning so we are disappointed,\u201d Keenum said. \u201cThere are some positives that we are going to learn from the film, but we have to win. Up 17-0, we have to win, especially division games.\u201d\n\nKeenum had the best season of his career in 2017, taking over after Sam Bradford was injured and leading the Vikings to a 13-3 record before the Eagles beat them 38-7 in the conference championship game.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Case Keenum looked the guy who almost led the Minnesota Vikings to the Super Bowl until the Philadelphia Eagles stopped him cold in the NFC title game two years ago.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Rob Maaddi"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/08/redskins_eagles_football_97705_c0-101-2408-1504_s1770x1032.jpg?ae5190dc90570a21ba1c56082c0bdae8e9f1d874", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
