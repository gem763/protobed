(Andrew Vaughan/Canadian Press)\n\n\"Here's a statement: This cartoon is obviously unacceptable,\" a spokesperson for the Singh campaign team said.\n\n\"Of course it's racist,\" said Evan Balgord, the executive director of the Canadian Anti-Hate Network, which tracks the comments made online by groups including the PPC.\n\nSocial media users also responded to the post with alarm.\n\nAnd you wonder why people are calling the PPC racist??!

I could have just shared it without even thinking about that,\" Lussier said. \"I'm usually quite attuned to that kind of thing because I'm a minority myself. Being a M\u00e9tis and a gay person myself, I get a lot of hate and threats.\"\n\nExplaining his intention\n\nFriesen, a retired corrections officer, said he didn't know who created the cartoon before he shared it.\n\n\"I wasn't really giving it much thought,\" he said.\n\nFriesen said he responded to the cartoon's larger message about the PPC being the only party on the right end of Canada's political spectrum.\n\nFriesen said he's keeping the post on his Twitter feed because it stokes discussion on Singh's initial reluctance to denounce a Sikh separatist group responsible for the 1985 Air India bombing.\n\n\"Let's have that discussion,\" Friesen said.\n\nBalgord of the Canadian Anti-Hate Network said the cartoon appears to have first surfaced in a post on the \"metacanada\" Reddit thread in August 2018\n\n\"It came out of and was trafficked by alt-right, neo-Nazi circles and did not originate with any commentary about [Air India] or anything of the sort that Friesen is using as his defence,\" Balgord said.\n\n'Now that's disgusting'\n\nFriesen's post came on Tuesday, a day before a video of a Montreal man telling Singh to take off his turban went viral.\n\nA man in Montreal told NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh he would 'look like a Canadian' if he removed his turban. After shaking hands the man said he hopes Singh wins. 0:27\n\n\"Now that's disgusting,\" Friesen said of that encounter, adding that the incident won't prompt him to remove his post.\n\n\"Two completely different situations.\"\n\nSingh is scheduled to make an appearance in Saskatoon Friday.\n\nIt's not the first time a Saskatchewan PPC candidate has come under scrutiny for remarks made on social media in recent months.\n\n\"Our country could use more hate speech, more offensive comments, more 'micro-aggressions', more violation of safe spaces with words and more critical thinking,\" Carlton Trail-Eagle Creek candidate Cody Payant wrote on his Facebook page and Twitter account on July 16.\n\nBernier defended Payant and said he would not be removed as a candidate, adding that he felt Payant had been quoted out of context during media coverage of the post.\n\nBernier's campaign office did not respond to requests for comment about Friesen's post Thursday.", "description": "Saskatoon-Grasswood candidate Mark Friesen says he didn't notice the bomb and says it looks like a tuque.
