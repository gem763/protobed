While Betts finished that inning in the field, Gorkys Hern\u00e1ndez took over in right in the third.\n\nBetts had been scheduled to have a night off, but last year\u2019s AL MVP wanted to play with right-hander Eduardo Rodr\u00edguez for his 19th victory.\n\nAfter both teams scored four runs in the first inning, Betts led off the second with his 29th homer.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Red Sox right fielder Mookie Betts has exited Boston's series opener at Texas because of left foot pain.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
