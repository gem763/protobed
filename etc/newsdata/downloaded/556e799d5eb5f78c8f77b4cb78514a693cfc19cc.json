Andy Biggs, the Arizona Republican who was elected this month to take the reins of the group of sometimes defiant hard-liners, said its members are not afraid to buck Mr. Trump as they did in opposing his attempt to repeal Obamacare in 2017.\n\n\u201cWe took a stand and said, \u2018No, this is a bad deal.\u2019 And we got the crap kicked out of us. And the president wasn\u2019t happy with that,\u201d Mr. Biggs told The Washington Times in a wide-ranging interview.\n\nThough the Freedom Caucus has a reputation for rebelling against House Republican leadership, Mr. Biggs said the president knows the group will support him when push comes to shove.\n\nHe pointed to the fact that his members rallied around the president during the campaign season and have been his staunchest defenders in committee hearings that Democrats are using to investigate him on several fronts.\n\n\u201cThe president trusts us because he knows that we look for every opportunity to defend him. I personally believe that is the right thing to do because you\u2019ve got 90-plus percent of Republicans that approve of what he\u2019s doing,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo wherever we\u2019re in agreement, we\u2019re going to fight and defend,\u201d he added.\n\nOne of the ways the Freedom Caucus has supported Mr. Trump is by defending the creative and lawsuit-inducing ways he has attempted to circumvent Congress and get the funds he needs to build his border wall.\n\nDespite strongly railing against such unilateral actions as President Obama\u2019s creation of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which granted amnesty to young illegal immigrants, Mr. Biggs said Mr. Trump is within his rights to act unilaterally because Congress has given up so much of its authority.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t like it, then what we need to do is say, \u2018We\u2019re taking back that authority.\u2019 But we didn\u2019t take back the authority,\u201d he said. \u201cOK, we don\u2019t like it, Congress? You\u2019d better act like Congress should.\u201d\n\nSome in Washington have compared the right-wing caucus to the group of four firebrand liberal congresswomen known as \u201cThe Squad\u201d and the associated Congressional Progressive Caucus because of its reputation for unruly uprisings against party leaders.\n\nMr. Biggs didn\u2019t agree with that comparison. He said Freedom Caucus members rely on playing by the rules to fight for their priorities.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re using a bully pulpit or something like that far more than we do,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the far-right caucus is closer to the president than to its chamber\u2019s leadership, which it has irked on several occasions.\n\nNot only did Freedom Caucus members derail the Obamacare fix, but they also tanked Republicans\u2019 chance in June 2018 to pass immigration reform. They blamed the leadership for not pushing for an enforcement-heavy option, though some members felt the caucus was moving the goal posts on negotiations.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of traits and characteristics I admire of the Freedom Caucus sticking together, but honesty is just not one of them,\u201d then-Rep. Jeff Denham, California Republican, said on MSNBC at the time.\n\nLast year, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, one of the founding members of the Freedom Caucus, challenged Rep. Kevin McCarthy, California Republican and the top lieutenant for Speaker Paul D. Ryan, for leadership of the party caucus. Mr. Jordan argued that party leadership had failed to make good on its campaign promises.\n\nNow, though, Mr. Biggs is looking to turn a corner with party leadership as he aims to ensure the Freedom Caucus gets a say in not just procedures but also policy advancement.\n\nHe said his relationship with Mr. McCarthy is \u201cunder construction.\u201d The Republican leader agreed to have regular meetings, leaving Mr. Biggs \u201chopeful and optimistic.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big believer that to be successful you keep your principles,\u201d he said. \u201cYou also realize that you form coalitions, you work together where you can. And so we\u2019ll see how this plays out.\u201d\n\nPart of that includes helping Republicans rally together for the 2020 elections.\n\nThough the president is facing a primary challenge from a former Freedom Caucus member, Mark Sanford, Mr. Biggs doubts Mr. Trump has anything to worry about.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a gnat on the back of a water buffalo type of thing,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe president is not overly concerned with him,\u201d Mr. Biggs said. \u201cYou know Mark\u2019s out there. It\u2019s a chaotic type of effort. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to do anything.\u201d\n\nMr. Biggs agreed with his friend\u2019s focus on addressing fiscal issues such as the rising national debt but said it ultimately wouldn\u2019t be able to make a dent in the president\u2019s overwhelming popularity with the Republican base.\n\n\u201cBecause if you\u2019re a Never-Trumper, you\u2019re still going to be a Never-Trumper. And if you\u2019re a Trumper, you\u2019re going to be a Trumper,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Biggs cautioned against trusting the \u201canti-Trump\u201d polling data and said Republicans should focus on counting electoral votes rather than generic voters.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s kind of what we were hearing last time in 2016, and it just didn\u2019t materialize,\u201d he said.\n\nAs for the House, Mr. Biggs said he is confident Republicans will win control in 2020. He said Democrats\u2019 two-dozen-seat majority is built on districts they won by a combined 95,000 votes last year.\n\nRepublicans\u2019 general plan is to zero in on 31 districts that the president won in 2016, 13 of which were held by more than 6 percentage points. Republicans hope the president\u2019s popularity will help reverse the 2018 blue wave and help them secure the 19 seats they need to win the majority.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
