Police responded with water cannon, rubber bullets, and tear gas, while the legislature was evacuated.\n\nLocal news broadcasts showed protesters burning the Chinese flag and tearing down and burning a large banner that had been erected to commemorate China\u2019s upcoming national day on Oct. 1.\n\nProtesters also vandalized subway stations, venting their fury at a train operator that they accuse of being in league with the the authorities by transporting riot police to demonstrations but shutting stations when protesters need to leave.\n\nAs the night wore on, there were reports of pro-government gangs armed with rods beating protesters in eastern districts of Hong Kong Island.\n\nEarlier in the day, protesters waved the U.S. flag, and even banners for President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection campaign, as they flooded the streets in their thousands chanting \u201cResist Beijing! Liberate Hong Kong!\u201d\n\nA few dozen protesters also gathered at the British consulate, waving Union Jacks and singing \u201cGod Save the Queen\u201d as they petitioned Whitehall for assistance\n\n\u201cI guess this is our last hope,\u201d said 46-year-old marcher Selina, in reference to the appeals to Western powers for support. \u201cMaybe with Trump or American help we can stop the police violence.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmericans care about freedom and rights and somehow I hope America will help us,\u201d echoed Jackie, a 21-year-old student.\n\nProtesters attend a pro-democracy march in Hong Kong on September 15, 2019. | NICOLAS ASFOURI\u2014AFP/Getty Images More\n\nSunday\u2019s demonstrations come after a day of brawls across the city between protesters and pro-Beijing groups that saw 25 people brought to hospital. A fire also broke out at the office of a pro-Beijing legislator.\n\nMany protesters have threatened to escalate their campaign if the government does not meet their demands for, among other things, universal suffrage and an independent inquiry into what they say is the heavy handed way police have handled the demonstrations.\n\n\u201cWhen we say thing a quietly and peacefully and it doesn\u2019t work you have to escalate,\u201d Ken, a 46-year-old protester, told TIME. \u201cWe have no choice; give us a better choice.\u201d\n\nSemi-autonomous Hong Kong has been roiled by more than three months of unrest, which began as a series of demonstrations against a now withdrawn extradition bill. The movement quickly escalated into a full blown campaign for genuine democracy, with calls for the city\u2019s leader to be elected by universal suffrage instead of the small and carefully vetted electoral college that decides the appointment at present.\n\nIn recent weeks, calls for self-determination and even independence for Hong Kong have started to grow, leading a furious Beijing to denounce the protests as a separatist, color revolution.\n\nHong Kong was retroceded to China in 1997, after 156 years of British rule, but it\u2019s 7.2 million people remain culturally and linguistically distinct from mainland Chinese.\n\n\u2014With reporting by Aria Hangyu Chen and Amy Gunia / Hong Kong", "description": "The demonstrations come after a day of brawls between opposing political groups that left 25 hospitalized", "authors": ["Time Staff"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/sILo77ABZrls7Vuq2bsOEQ--~B/aD00NjU2O3c9Njk4NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/b26edfedb64831d4f8822886011b6bd0", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
