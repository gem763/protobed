GRAHAM, GEN. KEANE: TURKEY PAVES WAY FOR ISIS COMEBACK \u2013 US MUST PREVENT RETURN OF TERRORIST GROUP\n\nIt is time to realize that Washington can still win over both Turks and Kurds \u2013 and thereby, its competition with Russia and Iran for influence in northeast Syria\n\nThe Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) \u2013 America\u2019s partners against the Islamic State \u2013 bring together Syria\u2019s Arabs, Kurds, Syriac Christians, Turkmen and Yazidis.\n\nCritics argue that this multiethnic and multifaith force is a \u201cfig leaf\u201d for hiding its primary component \u2013 the Kurdish-led People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG), which is an affiliate of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). The PKK is designated by Turkey, the U.S. and the European Union as a terrorist organization because of the violent insurgency it has led against Turkey since 1984.\n\nThe PKK\u2019s Marxist-Leninist worldview, history of working with Soviet Russia, and the support it received from Syria\u2019s Hafez Assad regime until 1998 further raise eyebrows.\n\nIn 2016 the Turkish prime minister called the YPG, \u201clegionnaires and hired soldiers of Russia.\u201d A pro-Turkish pundit claimed the next year that the YPG saw Syria \u201cmerely as a springboard for supporting the P.K.K.\u2019s insurgency against Turkey\u2019s government.\u201d The pundit predicted that U.S.-backed YPG\u2019s takeover of Raqqa, the jihadist capital in Syria, would create \u201canew the conditions that led to the rise of the Islamic State.\u201d\n\nOther analysts expected that the Syrian Kurds would \u201cdo a back flip and embrace the Syrian military\u201d following Turkey\u2019s previous cross-border operation into the SDF-held Afrin region in the winter of 2018.\n\nWashington\u2019s campaign against the Islamic State and partnership with the SDF has provided a unique opportunity to test such predictions and the true colors of the Syrian Kurds and their alphabet soup organizations.\n\nFor U.S. special operations forces, the SDF\u2019s men and women in uniform have proven to be loyal and effective fighters, as they shared trenches in defeating the Islamic State.\n\nSince then, the SDF leadership appears to be interested in maintaining the security and stability of northeast Syria rather than launching any attacks against their Turkish neighbors to the north.\n\nInstead of provoking a Sunni reaction and an Islamic State resurgence in Arab-majority towns, the SDF has demonstrated a surprising ability to build solidarity across ethnic and religious divides and built a relatively inclusive system that embraces minorities.\n\nCritics and supporters of the SDF would agree that there is much room for improvement in northeast Syria on the political front. The Syrian Democratic Council (SDC) \u2013 the SDF\u2019s political wing \u2013 continues to exclude Syrian Kurdish groups close to Turkey and to Iraq\u2019s Kurdistan Regional Government.\n\nRemedying this democratic deficit was central to France\u2019s efforts over the summer to reconcile rival Kurdish factions in northeast Syria, which seem to have hit a dead end. The SDC\u2019s path to legitimacy requires sharing power with all democratic parties, including those sympathetic to Ankara and Erbil.\n\nGiven the complex history of the SDF, and its problematic relations with the Turkish government, U.S. policymakers need to decide whether this umbrella group is more of a liability than an asset.\n\nSome argue that the cons outweigh the pros to such an extent that northeast Syria is better off under the rule of the Syria\u2019s Bashar Assad regime and its patrons, Russia and Iran.\n\nWashington\u2019s current trajectory, unless altered, will soon prove whether northeast Syria\u2019s Arabs, Kurds, Syriac Christians, Turkmen, and Yazidis will fare better under the authoritarian trifecta of Damascus, Moscow and Tehran.\n\nOddly enough, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who is currently busy waging his third cross-border campaign into Syria against the SDF, was the one who had earlier helped the Syrian Kurds prove that they can change.\n\nDuring Turkey\u2019s Kurdish peace process, which Erdogan led until 2015 in defiance of a decades-long hardline policy against Turkey\u2019s Kurds, the Turkish leader proved that the Kurds on both sides of the Turkish-Syrian border could be a partner and positive force for change.\n\nIn February 2015, when the Turkish army carried out an operation into Islamic State-held territory to rescue the tomb of the grandfather of the founder of the Ottoman Empire, Syrian Kurdish YPG forces cooperated closely with Ankara to provide cover for the Turkish soldiers.\n\nSadly, the ascendancy of Turkey\u2019s pro-Kurdish party and Erdogan\u2019s losing of his parliamentary majority in June 2015 elections practically ended Turkey\u2019s peace process with the Kurds. The Turkish president turned to ultranationalists and their hardline policies for the snap elections that he called for regaining his majority.\n\nThe Erdogan government today pushes the line in Washington and elsewhere that the pro-Kurdish movements in Syria and Turkey are destined to remain a threat, beholden to their radical ideologies, violent pasts, and Cold War connections to Russia.\n\nAs the White House is trying to shape its Syria policy, the question of whether the Kurds are also capable of change \u2013 just like millions of others who have escaped Moscow\u2019s iron fist to embrace democracy, free markets, and religious freedoms \u2013 is more pertinent than ever.\n\nMichael Rubin of the American Enterprise Institute, for example, warns: \u201cTo suggest that a pro-Russian orientation is hardwired into Kurdish genes, though, is self-defeating.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThe history of Iraqi Kurds, who once had close relations with Moscow, and the success of their Kurdistan Regional Government in building strong political and economic relations with Turkey and the U.S. proves Rubin right.\n\nOne could argue that Washington\u2019s flipping of Syrian Kurds and their SDF allies was on the path to becoming yet another success story in the Islamic State-torn Middle East. It was as much a strategic political win in the region as a tactical military one against the jihadists.\n\nOddly, the U.S. flip of northeast Syria resonates with another flip in the Middle East from decades ago. As Hudson Institute\u2019s Mike Doran argues about Egypt\u2019s flip from the Soviet camp to the U.S. one: \u201cThe Soviets could help Cairo make war, but only the Unites States could help it make peace.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSimilarly, Washington today can not only help the SDF wage war to keep the Islamic State and the Assad regime and its Russian and Iranian patrons out of northeast Syria. The U.S. can also help its political wing, the SDC, make peace, by reaching negotiated settlements with Ankara, Damascus, and Erbil that would guarantee peaceful coexistence and autonomy.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin continues to watch closely as he is poised to flip the Kurds back and win Syria in its entirety. As President Trump is finalizing his game plan for northeast Syria, he needs to remember that he can still choose to win both Turks and Kurds, and thereby, America\u2019s competition with Russia and Iran for influence in northeast Syria.", "description": "The US can help the Kurds reach a settlement with Turkey and Syria that would guarantee peaceful coexistence and Kurdish autonomy.", "authors": ["Aykan Erdemir", "A Former Member Of The Turkish Parliament", "Is A Senior Fellow At The Foundation For Defense Of Democracies.
