Instead, it said, it would spend the time taking stock to find ways to make the organisation net zero by the end of next year.\n\nThat will include examining all aspects of its operations, from lighting and set design to its bar and restaurant and whether someone can take in a single-use plastic bottle of drink.\n\n\u201cIt would be banned and I think it\u2019s really important that it is banned,\u201d said the theatre\u2019s artistic director, Vicky Featherstone. \u201cWe are not nannying people: when they leave our building they can behave how they want but, actually, I think it is really important that people have to think about how they come in to the space and what it means.\n\n\u201cMy feeling about it is we are all in such a dystopian, existential crisis about this real thing that is in front of us, that to be able to go somewhere and to be told \u2026 about how to model your behaviours within that building will be a really calming thing for people.\u201d\n\nThe theatre announced this year that it would give March 2020 over to work on the climate emergency. But things have changed quickly and the issue is already embedded in the work and thoughts of Royal Court writers, Featherstone said.\n\n\u201cIt felt a bit simplistic to be saying we were going to be programming work specifically just for a month around the climate emergency when all the writers are writing about it all the time.\n\n\u201cInstead of filling March with possibly very brilliant monologues about the climate emergency, we are going to stop and take stock and learn how we can, from March onwards, commit to the building becoming net-zero.\u201d\n\nThe plan is to make changes in its rehearsal and experimental performance space, Site, which will then be applied to the main building as it transitions to a net-zero arts venue.\n\nA lot of work has been done by arts organisations around the UK to reduce, offset and neutralise climate impact.\n\nThe Royal Court initiative arguably takes this to the next level and its executive producer, Lucy Davies, said the theatre would share all of its experiences, \u201cincluding all the experiments that fail\u201d.\n\nFeatherstone said anyone entering the building from March would be contributing to the commitment. \u201cThe Royal Court has always been radical and must always be radical and fearless in its approach to the way that the work is made, who makes it and who it is for,\u201d she said. \u201cIt feels like we don\u2019t have a decision here; we just have to do it. It has to be now.\u201d\n\nThe theatre said more information about public events during Open Court: Climate Emergency (2-20 March) would follow in early 2020.", "description": "Royal Court crackdown forms part of mission to become net-zero-carbon venue in 2020", "authors": ["Mark Brown"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f465562c03e37df280f7b2877c4bcee8de2cbedd/0_124_5826_3496/master/5826.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7695b308e3c2338cfdf3e17c21151980", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
