Team officials didn't offer much more in a news conference later in the morning.\n\n\"Let's just put it this way, there's nothing sinister to it,\" said head coach Paul Maurice. \"He needs some time and he was given that. He has a right to his privacy.\"\n\nAsked if there is any reason the Jets organization or the fan base, with whom Byfuglien has become a favourite, should be concerned, Maurice added, \"No, I think it's going to be well handled.\"\n\nMaurice added there is no timeline for when he expects Byfuglien to return.\n\n\"He needs some time to work through some things. He's going to be fine, everything's fine,\" he said in an interview with TSN 1290 radio before the morning news conference.\n\nDustin Byfuglien celebrates after scoring against the Nashville Predators during the 2018 NHL playoffs. (Trevor Hagan/Canadian Press)\n\nThe team is already missing three other starting defenceman from last season.\n\nJacob Trouba was dealt to the New York Rangers while Tyler Myers and Ben Chiarot signed with new teams in free agency \u2014 Myers with the Vancouver Canucks and Chiarot with the Montreal Canadiens.\n\nJets general manager Kevin Cheveldayoff was equally cryptic about Byfuglien's leave, saying only that the team supports him and awaits \"the resolution\" of his personal matter.\n\n\"Dustin is a big part of our family here. You always care about people of your family,\" he said. \"One thing I will say is health-wise, everything is good for him and his family.\"\n\nWhatever the issue is, Byfuglien is dealing with it in Winnipeg, he noted.\n\n'Quite a turnover'\n\nFriday was the first day of Jets training camp and there are several other absences.\n\nThe team no longer has speedy forward Brandon Tanev, who signed with the Pittsburgh Penguins in free agency, or centre Kevin Hayes who was traded to the Philadelphia Flyers.\n\nAs well, young superstars Kyle Connor and Patrik Laine are two restricted free agents looking for new contracts and not skating.\n\nJets captain Blake Wheeler said there are a lot of questions about who will be part of this year's team. (Gary Solilak/CBC)\n\n\"We've had quite a turnover, obviously. A lot of great guys, great players walked out the door,\" said Jets captain Blake Wheeler, who is going into his ninth season with the team and 12th in the league.\n\nIn that time, he has seen teams go through many changes but admits this year is \"fairly unique.\"\n\n\"Ultimately, it's the nature of the beast and we as group can only control so much,\" he said. \"We're here and we're gonna form a team. The question is who's a part of that team.\n\n\"We'll deal with that when we deal with it \u2026 that's really all we can do.\"\n\nAs for Byfuglien, Wheeler called him indispensable and looked forward to his return.\n\n\"He's an irreplaceable element to our team,\" he said. \"What he brings on the ice is pretty recognizable [and] he's a really unique guy in the room for us \u2014 doesn't have many bad days, keeps it pretty light.\"\n\nThe Jets pre-season begins Monday in Edmonton against the Oilers. The first game of the 2019-20 regular season goes Oct. 3 in New York against the Rangers.", "description": "The Winnipeg Jets will be without Big Buff for at least a little while.", "authors": ["Reporter Editor", "Darren Bernhardt Spent The First Dozen Years Of His Journalism Career In Newspapers", "First At The Regina Leader-Post Then The Saskatoon Starphoenix.
