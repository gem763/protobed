Time is likely to tell that Buildmeupbuttercup was up against a real group filly that day who could well go on to hold her own at Group 1 level.\n\nAs regards ground conditions, Mullins\u2019 charge has won on soft and good-to-soft so should have no worries there. Throw in the fact that the Mullins team have won the race before, Frankie Dettori takes the ride and Betfair are paying the first six places home, she is a good each way bet at 5/1.\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget, Betfair Sportsbook are offering a free bet of up to \u00a325 for every winner at 3/1 or over during ITV racing on Saturday (free bet matching original stake, max \u00a325).\n\nYoda a good bet, she is\n\nI really like the look of John Gosden\u2019s filly, Miss Yoda in the 14:20 at Newmarket.\n\nThe regard the two-year-old is held in was evident when Gosden was reportedly caught listening to her winning at Sandown live on his phone while receiving the prize for Stradivarius winning the Doncaster Cup!\n\nThe filly won well that day over a mile, giving off a strong impression that this step up to 1m2f will be ideal for and that stamina may well be her forte. Dettori rides for a trainer that couldn\u2019t be in better form (as he has all season) and the 11/4 available looks good \u2013 I have her as a 2/1 chance.\n\nA 25/1 shot at York\n\nFinally, we head over to York where one who could go well at a massive price is David O\u2019Meara\u2019s Cold Stare, in the 15:50.\n\nThe four-year-old ran better than the bare margin suggests last weekend over 7f at Ascot and this return to York\u2019s 6f could prove an advantage on the ground.\n\nHe\u2019s run well in the Ayr Gold Cup and other good races this season, goes very well in the ground and the stable have won this race before.\n\nImportantly, he has a high draw in stall 21 and that normally is a massive advantage when the ground gets soft at this time of year. At the odds and with Betfair paying five places he commands a bit of each way interest at 25/1.", "description": "Betfair racing expert Alan Thompson reveals his tip for the Cesarewitch plus two more to back at Newmarket and York", "authors": ["Alan Thompson"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article18993599.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_bet-fair.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
