Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter served on the board of the company at the same time his father was leading the Obama administration\u2019s diplomatic dealings with Kyiv.\n\n\u201cPhone call went well,\u201d wrote Andrey Yermak in a text to Volker later that day after the two presidents spoke. Yermak suggests several dates when Trump and Zerenskiy could meet in September.\n\nBut all that planning started to unravel when Zelenskiy\u2019s aide tried to lock in a date for the Trump meeting before putting out the statement on the investigations. Trump put a hold on military assistance to the country, which was depending on the funds as part of its defense of Russia.", "description": "Top U.S. diplomats encouraged Ukraine\u2019s newly-elected president to conduct an investigation linked to Joe Biden\u2019s family in return for a potentially...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS642_volker_ZG_20191004000747.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
