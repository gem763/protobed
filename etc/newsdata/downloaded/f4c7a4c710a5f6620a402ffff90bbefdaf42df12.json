Bill Ritter rocked the state by naming a little-known school superintendent named Michael Bennet to the Senate seat vacated by Ken Salazar.\n\n\u201cThat caught everyone by surprise,\u201d recalled University of Denver political science professor Seth Masket. \u201cI was one of those watching the political scene at the time, and everyone had a shortlist of who was likely to get picked. He was on no one\u2019s list.\u201d\n\nIt was a Cinderella start to what has been a charmed political career\u2014until now. After jumping into the Democratic presidential primary race in May, the two-term senator is scraping the bottom of the field, failing to qualify for the September and October debates while raising just $2.1 million in the third quarter.\n\nEven so, Mr. Bennet vowed this week to stay in the race at least through the Feb. 11 New Hampshire primary. His strategy: Convince voters that his more moderate platform and success in winning \u201ctwo tough national races\u201d in Colorado makes him the best candidate to defeat President Trump in 2020.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t win two swing-state elections by apologizing for Obamacare, or making empty promises,\u201d said Mr. Bennet in an Iowa television ad released Thursday. \u201cI did it by going everywhere, offering ideas that can win broad support, even the places that don\u2019t vote for me. You want to beat Trump? That\u2019s how.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the 54-year-old Bennet\u2019s political rise may be attributed to a heady mix of persistence, purpose and privilege.\n\nMr. Bennet arrived in Colorado in 1997, but he grew up in Washington, D.C., in a politically prominent family. His father Douglas Bennet served as an ambassador, an assistant secretary, and headed National Public Radio. His brother James Bennet was editor-in-chief of the Atlantic before becoming editorial page editor of The New York Times.\n\nIn Colorado, Michael Bennet landed a plum job with Philip Anschutz after a Wesleyan University trustee, Alan Dachs, wrote to the billionaire on Mr. Bennet\u2019s behalf, even though he admitted to Mr. Anschutz that \u201che knew little about numbers, let alone Anschutz\u2019s massive [business] empire,\u201d according to a 2010 article in the Denver Post.\n\nIn 2003, he connected with then-Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper, a fellow Wesleyan grad, and became his mayoral chief of staff. From there he went on to become Denver Public Schools superintendent, despite having no background in education.\n\nWhy Mr. Ritter plucked him from a field that included Mr. Hickenlooper for the Senate seat is still debated \u2014 the governor called him \u201caccomplished\u201d and \u201chighly competent\u201d \u2014 but the rumor mill had it that Mr. Bennet nailed the interview and was the choice of the Obama team.\n\n\u201cHe was known among political types like the Obama people,\u201d said Denver pollster Floyd Ciruli. \u201cHis brother is a very major player in Washington. That\u2019s his milieu and his background, and he excels at that: being recognized as a talent. Obama, in my view, was the person who did the most to tell Ritter, \u2018This is the way to go.\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter winning the Senate jackpot, Mr. Bennet entered a tough 2010 pro-Republican election cycle, fueled by the rise of the Tea Party and Obamacare backlash. Despite having never run for office, he showed unexpected toughness, not shying away from GOP strongholds.\n\n\u201cThe thing about Bennet is that he shows up,\u201d said John Swartout, executive director of the Colorado Counties Inc., a Republican who worked on the campaign of Mr. Bennet\u2019s 2010 Senate foe, Ken Buck.\n\n\u201cDuring the Obamacare mess and everything else, he was having town meetings in small Eastern Plains counties and on the Western Slope,\u201d Mr. Swartout. \u201cHe would go where he was most unpopular and get yelled at by people. And it was kind of odd, because he\u2019d say, \u2018I didn\u2019t really agree with the stimulus package,\u2019 and people were saying, \u2018Yeah, but you voted for that.\u2019 But he kept getting out there.\u201d\n\nEarly on, Mr. Buck led in the polls, but his gaffes came back to haunt him, notably his comment on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d comparing homosexuality to alcoholism. Mr. Bennet eked out a narrow victory.\n\nIn 2016, Republicans nominated Darryl Glenn, a likeable but little-known El Paso County commissioner whose lackluster, ill-funded bid stood little chance against the well-oiled Democratic campaign. Mr. Bennet won by 50% to 44%.\n\nDid Mr. Bennet win \u201ctwo tough national campaigns\u201d? Not in the opinion of former Colorado GOP chairman Dick Wadhams.\n\n\u201cBuck made some terrible mistakes that got Bennet back into the race and allowed Bennet to win,\u201d said Mr. Wadhams. \u201cAnd then six years later, the Republican Party nominates somebody, Darryl Glenn, who ran a hapless campaign. There was no campaign. They [Democrats] were lucky.\u201d\n\nMr. Bennet may have received some help from Republicans, but he also showed himself to be a disciplined campaigner who avoided self-inflicted wounds.\n\n\u201cHe has a political style that has worked fairly well for him here, and he\u2019s one of the candidates who hasn\u2019t really embarrassed himself on the campaign trail,\u201d said Mr. Masket. \u201cPeople who have seen him, people who have met him tend to come away with a good impression of him. People wish him well.\u201d\n\nWhat missteps he has made haven\u2019t held him back. He headed the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee during the 2014 election, which despite his efforts saw his party lose nine seats and control of the Senate.\n\nDuring his tenure as superintendent in 2008, DPS entered into an \u201cexotic transaction\u201d to raise $750 million that wound up putting the district deeper in debt, according to The New York Times, although Mr. Bennet has defended the deal, saying it saved the district $20 million and no one could have predicted the credit crisis.\n\nAnalysts say Mr. Bennet is unrivaled in one-on-one interviews, but lacks the big, charismatic personality of, say, a Pete Buttigieg, that wins over large crowds and television audiences. That may be in a problem on the Iowa campaign trail.\n\n\u201cHis strength is not retail politics,\u201d said Mr. Ciruli. \u201cI thought he did well at the [July] debates, although he did not excel. And he\u2019s not a great platform speaker. But he does an incredible interview, and he\u2019s tenacious. He\u2019s a quick learner. And that\u2019s served him well in Colorado.\u201d\n\nAs for the presidential primary, Mr. Bennet\u2019s increasingly slim chances are tied to those of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden. An early Biden exit would create an opportunity for Mr. Bennet to command the center lane, and just maybe recapture some of the magic that launched his political career.\n\n\u201cWere Biden to decide to drop out of the race, and you had a lot of more moderate voters looking for a candidate, he might look a lot more interesting to people,\u201d said Mr. Masket. \u201cBut as long as you have that very big fish in the sea, it\u2019s hard for him to get attention.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
