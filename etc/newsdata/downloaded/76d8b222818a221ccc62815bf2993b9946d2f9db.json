REUTERS/Pierre Albouy\n\nThe deal is due to be approved at a Toyota board meeting on Friday, the people said, declining to be identified because the information has not been made public.\n\nThe investment would come a month after Toyota and another smaller Japanese automaker, Suzuki Motor Corp (7269.T), said they would take small equity stakes in each other. Such tie-ups highlight how automakers are scrambling to chase scale, manage costs and boost development.\n\nTraditional car makers, especially smaller ones like Subaru and Suzuki, are struggling to meet the fast pace of change in an industry being transformed by the rise of electric vehicles, ride hailing and autonomous driving.\n\nToyota\u2019s investment is likely to cost more than 70 billion yen (\u00a3527.17 million) based on Subaru\u2019s stock market value, said the Nikkei business daily, which first reported the news.\n\nSubaru is likely to reciprocate with a stake in Toyota that would roughly equal the value of Toyota\u2019s additional investment, one of the people told Reuters.\n\nRepresentatives for both Toyota and Subaru said the news was not something that had been announced by their companies.\n\nJOINING FORCES\n\nSubaru is particularly strong in sport-utility vehicles (SUV) and all-wheel-drive technology. The two automakers in June said they planned to jointly develop an electric sport-utility vehicle on a platform produced together, to split costs.\n\nCar markers around the world have been joining forces to slash development and manufacturing costs of new technology. Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) have said they will spend billions of dollars to jointly develop electric and self-driving vehicles.\n\nToyota seems to be particularly keen to build scale now by investing in smaller, domestic automakers, rather than forging cross-border tie-ups like some of its rivals.\n\nIt has been looking to expand scale in next-generation technology and said this year it would offer free access to patents for electric vehicle motors and power control units.\n\nShares of Toyota were down 0.9% while shares of Subaru fell 1.5% on Friday morning.", "description": "Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> plans to raise its stake in Subaru Corp <7270.T> to more than 20% from around 17% now, a deal that would also see the smaller firm invest in Japan's top automaker, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said on Friday.", "authors": ["Maki Shiraki", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434362959&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q05L", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
