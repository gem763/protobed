But the hitman kept half of the 2m yuan ($280,000) Qin paid and outsourced the job, offering a new assailant the other half.\n\nThe job was then contracted out three more times until a fifth man by the name of Ling Xinsi was offered 100,000 yuan ($14,000) to carry out the crime.\n\nIn 2014, almost half a year after the original job was commissioned, Ling left Wei a note asking to meet in Nanning. The two met at a coffee shop and Ling told Wei: \u201cFor just 100,000 yuan, I don\u2019t want to kill you, but you have to cooperate with me.\u201d\n\nLing and Wei staged his death, with photos of Wei tied up sent up the chain of command. Ling left the phone he used with Wei, who disappeared for about 10 days and then returned and reported the case to the police.\n\nThe Nanning Intermediate People\u2019s Court in Guangxi said in a post on its Wechat account on 17 October that the six defendants \u201cdeliberately deprived others of their lives, and their actions constitute the crime of intentional homicide.\u201d\n\nThe defendants, excluding Ling who had not been charged at the time, were previously cleared in 2016 after a court excluded evidence on the basis of police misconduct.\n\nThe rare acquittal in a court system where the conviction rate is 99% was hailed by some legal experts as a sign of progress in the criminal justice system.\n\nProsecutors later appealed the case and all six men, Qin and the five hired hitmen, have been sentenced to between two years and seven months to five years in prison.", "description": "Court hears job was outsourced repeatedly before fifth hitman offered to stage the death and pocket the payment", "authors": ["Lily Kuo"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/163840b212aba94931196a6f313111daecd67fd3/0_168_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=77ef72b6c3c5b1f107c6260d66242eaa", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
