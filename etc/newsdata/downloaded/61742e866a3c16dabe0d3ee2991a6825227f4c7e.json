There were no immediate reports of arrests over the masks.\n\nDemonstrators set fires, hurled petrol bombs at police and burned the Chinese national flag, in a direct challenge to authorities in Beijing.\n\nPolice said an officer in Yuen Long, a district in the outlying New Territories that saw fierce clashes in July, had fired a shot in self-defense after a protester threw a petrol bomb at him, setting him on fire.\n\nMedia said a 14-year-old boy had been shot and the city\u2019s Hospital Authority said his condition was now stable, but gave no details.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\nAbout 100 demonstrators besieged a branch of the Bank of China (Hong Kong) in the high-end shopping district of Causeway Bay, while across the harbor in the district of Kowloon, protesters smashed the glass store front of a China Life branch.\n\nPolice fired volleys of tear gas to disperse protesters in flashpoint districts such as Causeway Bay, Sha Tin and Wong Tai Sin, underscoring the challenges authorities face as the protests show no sign of letting up.\n\nHospital authorities said 31 people were hurt in Friday\u2019s protests, two of them seriously.", "description": "Hong Kong's metro system will stay shut on Saturday, the rail operator said, paralyzing transport in the Asian financial hub after a night of chaos in which police shot a teenage boy and pro-democracy protesters torched businesses and metro stations.", "authors": ["Twinnie Siu", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191005&t=2&i=1437227709&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9400V", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
