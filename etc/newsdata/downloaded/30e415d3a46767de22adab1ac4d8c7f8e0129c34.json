She said at a morning hearing she will release a written order later today.\n\nBut a broader legal challenge to the ban won't be decided until later this month. The judge set a hearing for Oct. 15 to take up the plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction to stop the ban, which Republican Gov. Charlie Baker announced Sept. 24.\n\nThe judge's decision followed a morning hearing on the lawsuit brought by vape shops and vaping companies against Baker and the commonwealth of Massachusetts.\n\nThe ban applies to online and retail sale of all kinds of nicotine and marijuana vaping products and devices, and extends through Jan. 25, 2020. Retail shops were forced to clear shelves of products after a state health board approved Baker's plan.\n\nMore: Vaping-related lung injury cases surge to 1,080; deaths rise to 18\n\nIn deciding against a temporary restraining order, Talwani ruled the companies have not suffered \"irreparable harm\" to warrant immediate relief.\n\nSeparate complaints in Boston federal court came from a coalition of five Massachusetts vape shops and the Vapor Technology Association, the lobbying arm of e-cigarette companies and vaping products.\n\nMassachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker announced a temporary fourth-month ban on the sale of vaping products Sept. 24. More\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Thursday vaping-related lung injury cases have jumped to 1,080 and at least 18 have died. The specific causes of the illnesses are still not clear. Ten cases of vaping-related lung injures have been reported in Massachusetts.\n\nNearly four in five cases associated with the outbreak involved people vaping products with THC, alone or with nicotine, the CDC said this week. The agency has recommended that people refrain from using vaping products, particular those using THC, the principal psychoactive compound in marijuana.\n\nJoseph Terry an attorney representing vaping companies, said the ban \"presents an existential threat to their businesses and their industry.\" He said retail shops have had to let go employees and have struggled to pay rent, which he argued means they've been \"irreparably harmed.\"\n\n\"My clients told me we are going to go out of business in the next couple of weeks if there's not a resolution to this,\" he said.\n\nBut the judge argued the companies can still sell outside of Massachusetts.\n\nMore: Massachusetts bans all vaping products for 4 months in the toughest state action taken yet\n\nTerry also pointed out that most of the lung injuries appear to involve marijuana vaping products, not nicotine vaping devices like his clients sell.\n\nJulia Kobick, the state's attorney, however noted both nictorine and THC are a factor and it's not clear exactly what is making people sick.\n\n'We know that something in the vaping products is causing hundreds of Americans to experience respiratory problems. We don't know what's causing these Americans to have to be hospitalized,\" Kobick said.\n\nShe said the government recognizes economic hardships will result, but said it's \"not enough to warrant the extraordinary relief that these plaintiffs seek here.\"\n\nTalwani said the case has \"the ring of past history\" when representatives of the nicotine industry would tell the public there was no medical issues with their products.\n\n\"They're safer than cigarettes for people who are using cigarettes. But they aren't safer for people who weren't smoking cigarettes,\" she said. \"They (The CDC) haven't said, tell your children it's OK to vape.\"", "description": "A federal judge said she will reject a temporary restraining order sought by vaping stores and companies that produce vaping products.", "authors": ["Joey Garrison", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/RhfGm0huZB0_J.2JKJ61jQ--~B/aD0xNDE0O3c9MjEyMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/bef211b02c84607c4aa19dbfcff32587", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
