She spoke with Kelly Osbourne on the red carpet about comedians being shunned from the public eye if they say something offensive.\n\nSARAH SILVERMAN SHARES VIDEO OF PASTOR WISHING FOR HER 'UNTIMELY DEATH': 'HE IS GOING TO GET ME KILLED'\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely pressure,\u201d Silverman said (via Deadline). \u201cThere\u2019s a kind of righteousness porn going on in this cancel culture. There\u2019s nuance to it. There\u2019s good and there\u2019s bad. As a stand-up, it\u2019s really odd. To talk about what\u2019s really going on or to talk about the world as we decide to see it \u2013 or to push to see where the line is and to go past it \u2013 is so oddly unacceptable it\u2019s safer to\u2026\u201d\n\nWith that, the broadcast was censored, but Deadline notes that it looked like Silverman completed her sentence with the expletive, \u201cjust make p---- jokes.\u201d\n\nSARAH SILVERMAN TESTS INSTAGRAM'S COMMUNITY GUIDELINES WITH TOPLESS PHOTO\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Silverman has used the phrase \u201crighteousness porn\u201d while describing the pressure on comedians to atone for their past work. During a discussion with fellow comedian Mike Birbiglia at the Tribeca Film Festival, she touched upon the issue of people being canceled in pop culture over old, offensive tweets.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re for progress, being \u2018progressive\u2019 means that you change with all the new information that you get,\u201d Silverman said.\n\nShe continued: \u201cYou let yourself be changed. To be progressive, and yet to still hold people accountable for something from another time that they\u2019ve changed from, it makes me wonder. I have to ask myself, as I draw lines in the sand on social media, do I want this person to be changed? Or do I secretly want them to not be changed so I can point to them as wrong and myself as right? There\u2019s a kind of pornography in that. I think it\u2019s a kind of righteousness porn.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSilverman lost in her category at the 2019 Emmys to \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d", "description": "Comedian Sarah Silverman addressed \"cancel culture,\" likening it to \u201crighteousness porn\u201d on the 2019 Emmys red carpet.", "authors": ["Tyler Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/SarahSilverman1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
