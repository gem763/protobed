A maestro at getting under rivals\u2019 finger nails.\n\nWhen appearing at the despatch box, he does not shout or lose his rag. Nor does he rise to abuse.\n\nInstead, he is a model of stately courtesy, bowing and scraping with the affected charm of a grand high vizier. It drives his opponents potty.\n\nAs minister in charge of No Deal planning, Mr Gove was yesterday required to make a statement to the House after Angela Merkel scotched any chance of a deal earlier that morning.\n\nWhile most would sooner elect to wash the unmentionables of those skanky Extinction Rebellion irritants, Mr Gove takes to these tasks with unnatural relish.\n\nThe Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, as Michael Gove (pictured) is these days, is a wind-up par excellence. A maestro at getting under rivals\u2019 finger nails. Pictured on October 8 with Sir Nicholas Soames, circled, resting his eyes\n\nAfter arriving a tad flustered, we were given a typically florid statement. Sir Nicholas Soames (Ind, Mid Sussex) fell into a blissful post-prandial slumber.\n\nThere were murmurs of approval when Mr Gove mentioned Argentinian wine under No Deal would become cheaper. Labour\u2019s Brexit know-all, Sir Keir Starmer (Holborn and St Pancras), a small-glass-at-Christmas-only man one suspects, wasn\u2019t happy.\n\n\u2018The Prime Minister should be here,\u2019 he said solemnly. \u2018He should be here to account for his actions.\u2019\n\nThis was supposed to be a chance to enquire about No Deal planning but naturally Sir Keir was out to score points. He accused Mr Gove of issuing his statement as though reading a bedtime story. Various Doomsday No Deal scenarios were then trotted out.\n\nMr Gove thanked him for his response. Perhaps, he suggested, if Sir Keir was so keen on not leaving the EU without a deal he shouldn\u2019t have deliberately scuppered cross-party discussions during the summer.\n\nSir Keir, of course, hopes to stop us leaving altogether. The SNP\u2019s Tommy Sheppard (Edinburgh East) claimed that No Deal had been the Government\u2019s plan all along. Thanks so much for the query, Mr Gove simpered before dismissing the SNP as a bunch of hypocrites.\n\nThere were also carps directed at ragtag Downing Street aide Dominic Cummings (pictured), who\u2019d been fingered for issuing an aggressive briefing against Brussels earlier that morning\n\nHilary Benn (Lab, Leeds Central), who congratulated Mr Gove on his \u2018beguiling manner at the despatch box\u2019, tried to embarrass him by pointing out his previous opposition to no deal. Mr Gove: \u2018I am grateful, as ever, for the thoughtful tone...\u2019\n\nSome predictably foamy contributions followed. Yvette Cooper (Lab, Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford) fumed about intelligence sharing. Helen Goodman (Lab, Bishop Auckland) railed on behalf of hill farmers.\n\nAnna Soubry (Change UK, Broxtowe) \u2013 well, Soubers was her usual self. There were also carps directed at ragtag Downing Street aide Dominic Cummings, who\u2019d been fingered for issuing an aggressive briefing against Brussels earlier that morning.\n\nMr Gove\u2019s (pictured) loquaciousness departed him briefly when Barry Sheerman (Lab, Huddersfield) asked if it was true the country was led by a man \u2018he neither likes nor trusts\u2019\n\nDelicate flower Chris Leslie accused the Government of briefing against Mrs Merkel and urged Mr Gove to condemn any racist language which had been directed towards Germans as result. Mr Gove insisted Germany was \u2018our friend, our ally and a great country.\u2019\n\nAt this point, the Speaker Bercow had to stick his oar in, reminding members of the importance of \u2018decorous language\u2019.\n\nIncidentally, in the Lords earlier Lord Fowler paid tribute to one of Bercow\u2019s predecessors, Lady Boothroyd, who was celebrating her 90th birthday.\n\nAs dear old Betty smiled coyly, Fowler described her as a \u2018role model for all Parliamentarians \u2013 Speakers included\u2019. Throaty gurgles of laughter echoed around the Chamber.\n\nMr Gove\u2019s loquaciousness departed him briefly when Barry Sheerman (Lab, Huddersfield) asked if it was true the country was led by a man \u2018he neither likes nor trusts\u2019.\n\nMr Gove, cheeks delightfully rouged, was stumped. Eventually he muttered something about the Prime Minister being a man he admired. Mr Sheerman, thrilled by the minister\u2019s discomfiture, afforded himself a hearty chuckle.\n\nLater that evening, Parliament was prorogued by the men in funny hats and once again the chamber falls empty for a week.", "description": "HENRY DEEDES: The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, as Michael Gove (pictured) is these days, is a wind-up par excellence.
