Her parents had to make the heartbreaking decision to switch off her life support on August 3.\n\nHer grief-stricken mum Katie Dawson said today: \"Food was sometimes left uncovered and occasionally served lukewarm, and there were birds occasionally flying around the food.\n\n(Image: SWNS)\n\n(Image: SWNS)\n\n\u201cWe saw faeces in the swimming pool and I spoke to other holidaymakers who saw the faeces in the pool on more than one occasion, and staff just scooped it out without closing the pool or giving it a thorough clean.\n\n\u201cThe walls in the children\u2019s toilets were also smeared with faeces. It was disgusting.\"\n\nAllie, who loved Peppa Pig , suffered stomach cramps, diarrhoea, loss of appetite and lethargy and was eventually admitted to Royal Bolton Hospital.\n\nIt was confirmed that Allie had contracted Shiga-Toxin producing E. coli (STEC), which later led to her developing deadly Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome (HUS) - a life-threatening complication related to the poisoning.\n\n(Image: SWNS)\n\nHUS is a serious and potentially fatal condition that affects the blood and blood vessels, resulting in the destruction of blood platelets. It can also cause kidney failure and brain damage.\n\nAllie was moved to the Manchester Royal Infirmary and put in an induced coma on August 1.\n\nAn MRI scan was carried out, which revealed that she had sustained severe brain trauma and damage. Katie had to make the difficult decision to terminate Allie\u2019s life support following the advice from doctors.\n\nAllie died just three weeks before her third birthday.\n\nKatie continued: \u201cIn sharing Allie\u2019s story, we want to make people more aware of the signs and symptoms of STEC HUS.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\n\"I keep thinking that if I had known about the condition, then I would have probably taken Allie to hospital sooner and it wouldn\u2019t have ended the way it did.\n\n\"Allie was such a beautiful, happy girl and we are all utterly heartbroken. We still can\u2019t believe she is gone.\n\n\u201cAllie was an intelligent, beautiful and independent little lady.\n\n\"She was always giving kisses and cuddles at home, and always wanted to be sat on someone\u2019s knee or to be picked up and carried around.\n\n\u201cAllie loved baking, playing with her dolls, playing nurse and she was always sticking plasters on us and our dogs.\n\n(Image: SWNS)\n\nWhat is HUS? The NHS say HUS is a serious complication caused when bacteria produce a toxic substance called verocytotoxin. This can affect the blood, kidneys and, in some cases, the nervous system. It requires hospital treatment and, although most people make a full recovery, it can be fatal. In rare cases it can result from eating food contaminated with E. coli, a type of bacteria that causes food poisoning and is normally spread through traces of animal waste. There are different strains of E. coli, and some are more toxic than others. Children who are more likely to develop haemolytic uremic syndrome include those who: are younger than age 5\n\nhave a weakened immune system\n\nhave a family history of inherited hemolytic uremic syndrome.\n\n\"I bought her a nurse\u2019s outfit and doctor\u2019s bag full of equipment for her birthday but she never got to see them.\n\n\"Allie also loved watching Peppa Pig and singing nursery rhymes.\n\n\u201cThere is now a massive hole in our home and our hearts. We all miss her dearly. She should not have died. She had so much to give.\n\n\u201cWhile nothing will bring her back, we need to know what caused her illness and if anything could have been done to prevent it.\n\n\u201cWe all suffered gastric illness and there were a number of people complaining of being unwell during our stay at the hotel, but we didn't anticipate how serious it could be.\u201d\n\nThe family have now instructed specialist international serious injury lawyers, Irwin Mitchell, to investigate what happened.\n\nPublic Health England is also currently investigating the matter, and an inquest has been opened to examine the circumstances surrounding Allie\u2019s death.\n\n(Image: SWNS)\n\nJatinder Paul, a senior associate solicitor and specialist international serious injury lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, said: \u201cAllie\u2019s family are understandably heartbroken at the loss of their lovely little girl and are struggling to come to terms with what happened.\n\n\u201cThrough our work we are sadly only too aware of the potentially devastating consequences of serious illnesses such as STEC and E.coli, particularly for children, which are only highlighted by Allie\u2019s sad death.\n\n\u201cThis is every parent\u2019s worst nightmare and we are supporting Katie and her family through this difficult time and are now investigating how Allie contracted her illness.\n\n\u201cAs part of our investigations, we are looking into the family\u2019s stay at the Crystal Sunset Luxury Resort and Spa and if any issues are identified, we hope that measures will be taken to ensure this does not happen again.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for Jet2 said: \u201cWe are very sorry to hear about these tragic circumstances, and we would like to offer our heartfelt condolences to Ms. Dawson and her family at this very difficult time. As lawyers have been instructed, it would be inappropriate for us to make any further comment.\u201d\n\nThe hotel has been approached for comment.", "description": "Allie Birchall suffered poisoning after staying in four-star Crystal Sunset Luxury Resort and Spa, near Antalya, following her family's journey with Jet2", "authors": ["Bradley Jolly", "Samantha Yule", "Image", "Swns"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20537192.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SWNS_ALLIE_BIRCHALL_002.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
