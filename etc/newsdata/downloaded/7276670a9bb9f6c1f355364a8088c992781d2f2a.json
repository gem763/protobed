Article 34, Paragraph 3 also bans car rental business entities from using their commercial vehicles for paid passenger transport. These were the grounds for Monday's indictments.\"Experts added that the court is expected to focus on whether Tada should be considered a type of rental car service, which is within legal boundaries in South Korea, or an illegal taxi service operating without a license.In a statement, Tada said the world is changing in response to consumer demand and technological advances.It also maintained it has not broken any laws, based on a law that states rented vans with 11 to 15 seats can be offered with drivers.Despite the indictments, Tada says it will continue to operate its full fleet of around 1,400 vehicles until further notice.The court's verdict is not expected for some time, and it could take as long as three to four years if the case goes all the way to the Supreme Court.Kim Jae-hee, Arirang News.", "description": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc744 \ub300\ud45c\ud558\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubc29\uc1a1!
