Residents have been asked to stay inside and schools have been closed until further notice, officials said, according to ADN40.", "description": "Mexican security forces engaged in a prolonged shootout with heavily armed suspected cartel members in Sinaloa state Thursday, in an operation that ensnared a son of imprisoned drug lord Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman.", "authors": ["Natalie Gall\u00f3n", "Leyla Santiago", "Maria Santana", "Helena Demoura", "Helen Regan"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191017224635-01-el-chapo-shootout-1017-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
