All the other batsmen have really struggled.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been some good bowling and the pitches have helped the bowlers a fair bit throughout the series ... but when Steve Smith\u2019s facing up, it\u2019s a different ballgame.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just been the difference between the two teams to date.\u201d\n\nIf England manage to force a draw at Old Trafford, the series, currently tied at 1-1, will go down to the final test with Australian just needing to avoid defeat at The Oval to retain the Ashes.\n\nCricket - Ashes 2019 - Fourth Test - England v Australia - Emirates Old Trafford, Manchester, Britain - September 7, 2019 Australia's Steve Smith in action Action Images via Reuters/Jason Cairnduff\n\nBorder, who scored 3,548 runs from 47 tests against England at an average of 56.31, was confident Australia would wrap it up in Manchester but felt changes would be needed if they fell short.\n\n\u201cI think we hold all the aces but if it\u2019s draw, they will have to look at that top order,\u201d Border said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just missing straight balls and they can\u2019t keep relying on Steve Smith to get them out of trouble, he\u2019s going to miss out eventually.\u201d", "description": "Former test skipper Allan Border says that if Australia take the last eight English wickets on the final day of the fourth Ashes test on Sunday and retain the coveted urn, the credit can go only to one man -- Steve Smith.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190908&t=2&i=1427501068&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8705T", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
