And I don't take anything, I work hard and that's just what it is, I don't take anything.\n\n\"I don't even know what that even entails or what that involves to be able to go outside of the rule book to be able to try to get an advantage ... I don't take drugs, I don't take anything illegal, and I just work hard and just let my God-given abilities speak for themselves.\"\n\nColeman celebrates after winning the men`s 100m during the IAAF Athletics Diamond League competition in Oslo.\n\nYouTube video\n\nThe 23-year-old Coleman ran a world-leading time of 9.81 seconds for the 100 meters in the Diamond League in California in June -- a time just 0.02 seconds slower than his personal best.\n\nBut the whereabouts imbroglio has meant that Coleman has been equally busy off the track. So much so that the sprinter released a 22 minute YouTube video in which he explained the reasons behind the missed drug tests and proclaimed his innocence.\n\n\"Either you believe me or you don't believe me. I don't know, there's not much else I can do about it. I feel like I've been really transparent about the situation. At least, I try to be and just explain to people the situation, and there's nothing fishy going on.\n\n\"I'm just a regular guy, I just happen to be really talented, and I have a gift from God that I've worked really hard at. And now I'm at a level where you're in those conversations where people are speculating and things like that.\n\nSo we have a storyline like that, obviously, people are assuming and making up their own type of storyline. But in my opinion, I feel like I've done everything that I can do.\"\n\nTested on multiple occasions\n\nWhile insisting he did not break any rules, Coleman says he does need to be more \"diligent\" in making sure he informs USADA of his whereabouts.\n\nUSADA CEO Travis Tygart has also called Coleman and offered him tips on how to do so.\n\nAsked whether the prospect of a ban had entered his head after missing the first two tests, Coleman said: \"I don't know. I think people have a misconception of athletes when they think about what goes through their heads, you know what I'm saying?\n\nColeman raises his arms in celebration after winning the men's 100m final of the Memorial Van Damme athletics event.\n\n\"Obviously, that's the thought when it's just front and center, like here's the issue. It's just like, 'Why weren't you thinking about this?'\n\n\"I don't know. It's just like I'm an athlete, I'm a human being. I have personal issues going on. I have family, friends. I live outside of where I'm from, so I'm constantly traveling back and forth.\n\n\"I have appearances, I have different things going on, and I don't know, I just live a life that was just a lot of things going on through my head. So I can't necessarily say that that was just front and center. The thing that I think about every single day, like you got to make sure you're doing this every single day.\n\n\"But I think that that's what I've learned from the situation. It's just that you got to be more diligent in planning, you got to be more organized and every time you make a move you got to just remember to update the app and let them know the plan.\n\n\"Even if you don't know beforehand, like what the address is or whatever, just communicate and update the app and just let them know.\"\n\nColeman, who is also competing in the 200 meters in Doha, says he has been tested on multiple occasions over the past year, adding that drug testers sometimes come twice a week, twice a month or four times a month.\n\nKhalifa International Stadium in Doha is hosting the World Championships.\n\nLegacy\n\nThe World Championships should provide a perfect opportunity for Coleman to lay down a marker for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.\n\nSecond in the 100m at the World Championships in London two years ago, Coleman now wants gold in an event once dominated by the great Usain Bolt.\n\nThe Jamaican, a multiple world and Olympic champion and holder of the world record, retired in 2017. Since then, athletics has been looking for a new global superstar and while Coleman is not shy in coming forward, he is keen to play down comparisons between them.\n\n\"I mean, it's an honor like to be in the same category as somebody of his stature, somebody that I grew up looking up to,\" he said.\n\n\"But I just want to set my own legacy, set my own path... I want to be the next guy in the sport 10 years from now, you're asking another young guy who's coming up, 'Do you want to be like, Christian Coleman?'\"", "description": "Christian Coleman has an unequivocal message for the doubters: \"I don't do drugs.\"", "authors": ["Amanda Davies", "James Masters"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190903122832-christian-coleman-2019-diamond-league-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
