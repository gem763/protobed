She wrote the whole thing. If that\u2019s the case (and it\u2019s a big if), Len Gutkin writes in The Chronicle Review, what should we make of sections copied from other sources without attribution? Who is guilty of plagiarism?\n\nDianne Modestini writes about restoring Salvator Mundi: \u201cWhile restoring the Salvator Mundi\u2014work that I began in April 2005 and finished in September 2010\u2014I made sure that my feeble retouches never masked these precious traces. To match the original paint, I built up the retouches in thin layers in the same sequence used by Leonardo. Fearful of covering any original paint, I used the tiny 000 sable watercolor brushes made by Winsor & Newton. Each brushstroke was carefully judged, based on knowledge of similar works and the formal structure of adjoining passages. Even so, many of the gadflies who make their living on the fringes of the scholarly art world appear to believe that a restorer\u2014in this instance, me\u2014is capable of creating the Salvator Mundi. I suppose I should be flattered.\u201d\n\nLewis Pugh on what it\u2019s like to swim in -3\u02daC saltwater: \u201cIf an untrained person were to dive into freezing water, death would come quickly. Even after all my preparation, as I braced myself for the plunge I knew my body would be fighting with all its might to stay alive. What does it feel like when you first get into the water? It burns. It feels like you\u2019re on fire. But in temperatures like this, you don\u2019t die of the cold. You drown. Within the first five seconds your body goes into shock; it\u2019s very difficult to breathe. The only thing I can do is count every stroke, \u2018One. Two. Breathe. Three. Four. Breathe.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t get any better after that.\u201d\n\nThe women at the heart of modern China: \u201cIn their lifetime, and afterwards, the Soong sisters from Shanghai seemed like figures from a Chinese fairy tale. There were three of them: \u2018One loved money, one loved power and one loved her country.\u2019 They came from a family of prosperous Methodist converts and, for almost 100 years, one or other of them presided at or near the center of power in China. The middle sister, Chingling, married Sun Yatsen, the founding Father of the Republic, transferring her allegiance after his death to the small group of bandits, led by Mao Zedong, who formed the nucleus of the Chinese Communist party. To this day Chingling enjoys something like mythical status in the People\u2019s Republic of China.\u201d\n\nDa Vinci\u2019s bridge would have worked, a research group at MIT shows: \u201cDa Vinci\u2019s proposal was radically different than the standard bridge at the time. As described by the MIT group, it was approximately 918 feet long (218 meters, though neither system of measurement had been developed yet) and would have consisted of a flattened arch \u2018tall enough to allow a sailboat to pass underneath with its mast in place\u2026but that would cross the wide span with a single enormous arch,\u2019 according to an MIT press statement. It would have been the longest bridge in the world at the time by a significant measure, using an unheard of style of design.\u201d\n\nFran\u00e7ois Pinault\u2019s $170 million Paris museum to open in June 2020.\n\nIn praise of New York Review of Books Classics: \u201cFounded in 1972, the imprint Lost American Fiction had a mission to reintroduce wrongly forgotten books. It had reprinted 29 of them by 1979, at which point the series was itself consigned to oblivion. Prion Lost Treasures brought out 26 before suffering the same fate. Ecco Neglected Classics only made it to 21. There is something poignant about coming across a volume labeled \u201clost\u201d or \u2018neglected\u2019 in a used-book store, the designation having become prophecy, but the earthward trajectory of these quixotic enterprises is unfortunately all too predictable. Which is why the 20th anniversary of New York Review Books Classics\u2014they hit 500 last year, with Wolfgang Herrndorf\u2019s Sand\u2014is such an improbable milestone.\u201d\n\nEssay of the Day:\n\nWhat does Jeff Bezos want? To leave this world, Franklin Foer writes in The Atlantic:\n\n\u201cI spent five months speaking with current and former Amazon executives, as well as people at the company\u2019s rivals and scholarly observers. Bezos himself declined to participate in this story, and current employees would speak to me only off the record. Even former staffers largely preferred to remain anonymous, assuming that they might eventually wish to work for a business somehow entwined with Bezos\u2019s sprawling concerns.\n\n\u201cIn the course of these conversations, my view of Bezos began to shift. Many of my assumptions about the man melted away; admiration jostled with continued unease. And I was left with a new sense of his endgame.\n\n\u201cBezos loves the word relentless\u2014it appears again and again in his closely read annual letters to shareholders\u2014and I had always assumed that his aim was domination for its own sake. In an era that celebrates corporate gigantism, he seemed determined to be the biggest of them all. But to say that Bezos\u2019s ultimate goal is dominion over the planet is to misunderstand him. His ambitions are not bound by the gravitational pull of the Earth.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\n\u201cWhen reporters tracked down Bezos\u2019s high-school girlfriend, she said, \u2018The reason he\u2019s earning so much money is to get to outer space.\u2019 This assessment hardly required a leap of imagination. As the valedictorian of Miami Palmetto Senior High School\u2019s class of 1982, Bezos used his graduation speech to unfurl his vision for humanity. He dreamed aloud of the day when millions of his fellow earthlings would relocate to colonies in space. A local newspaper reported that his intention was \u2018to get all people off the Earth and see it turned into a huge national park.\u2019\n\n\u201cMost mortals eventually jettison teenage dreams, but Bezos remains passionately committed to his, even as he has come to control more and more of the here and now. Critics have chided him for philanthropic stinginess, at least relative to his wealth, but the thing Bezos considers his primary humanitarian contribution isn\u2019t properly charitable. It\u2019s a profit-seeking company called Blue Origin, dedicated to fulfilling the prophecy of his high-school graduation speech. He funds that venture\u2014which builds rockets, rovers, and the infrastructure that permits voyage beyond the Earth\u2019s atmosphere\u2014by selling about $1 billion of Amazon stock each year. More than his ownership of his behemoth company or of The Washington Post\u2014and more than the $2 billion he\u2019s pledged to nonprofits working on homelessness and education for low-income Americans\u2014Bezos calls Blue Origin his \u2018most important work.\u2019\u201d\n\nRead the rest.\n\nPhoto: Val Poschiavo\n\nReceive Prufrock in your inbox every weekday morning.
