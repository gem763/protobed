I was among those who called the president and his malevolent missive despicable. But I was driven into a rage over the responses from the two senators from South Carolina, a state that has had 164 documented lynchings between 1877 and 1950, according to the Equal Justice Initiative.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSo yeah, this is a lynching in every sense,\u201d Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R) said at the Capitol. \u201cThis is un-American. I\u2019ve never seen a situation in my lifetime as a lawyer where somebody\u2019s accused of major misconduct who cannot confront the accuser, call witnesses on their behalf and have the discussion in the light of day so the public can judge.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that the impeachment process is the closest thing of a political death row trial, so I get his absolute rejection of the process,\u201d said Sen. Tim Scott (R), the only African American Republican in the Senate. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t use the word lynching.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a saying for this idiocy: \u201cBetter to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and to remove all doubt.\u201d To invoke lynching in this manner is to trivialize an open and widely unacknowledged sore in our nation\u2019s history. It is to minimize domestic terror against African Americans. It\u2019s to negate the pain of the people who built this country with their free labor and made it great with their resilience in the face of persistent and ongoing discrimination.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnyone who cannot see fit to give a full-throated condemnation of Trump and what he said is not fit for public office or the public trust.\n\nRead more from Jonathan Capehart:\n\nAD", "description": "To invoke lynching in this manner is to trivialize an open and widely unacknowledged sore in our nation\u2019s history.", "authors": ["Jonathan Capehart", "Opinion Writer Focusing On The Intersection Of Social", "Cultural Issues", "Opinion Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/jHrFYwidsQxT0eBWV6cTqNHYDIk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6PFMOEHUF4I6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
