Season eight, episode four: The Last of the Starks Given a chance to return to real intrigue after the Battle of Winterfell, Benioff and Weiss showed they had lost their grip, with an incoherent episode that betrayed several key characters for the sake of obvious plot grinding. A Starbucks cup left on a feasting table told us everything we needed to know about a series that has given up. HBO 7/73 67. Season two, episode eight: Prince of Winterfell There is some good stuff with Arya and Jaqen H\u2019ghar, but it\u2019s mainly placeholder as they set up the Battle of Blackwater. HBO 8/73 66. Season three, episode 10: Mysha Jon Snow and Ygritte\u2019s goodbye at the climax of season three ought to have been much sadder. HBO 9/73 65. Season five, episode two: The House of Black and White Lots of setting up. Jaime and Bronn plan to go to Dorne, Arya arrives in Braavos. HBO 10/73 64. Season seven, episode six: Beyond the Wall This ought to have been one of the great battles: ice zombies plus dragons plus Jon Snow\u2019s expedition. It looked spectacular, but everyone worried about teleporting ravens and speed of sound dragons. HBO 11/73 63. Season six, episode eight: No One Some absolutely horrible banter between Grey Worm and Missandei. HBO 12/73 62. Season two, episode seven: A Man Without Honour Pyat Pree kills the 13 in Qarth. Tywin talks to Arya about legacy. HBO 13/73 61. Season six, episode one: The Red Woman Melisandre is a very, very old woman. HBO 14/73 60. Season two, episode two: The Night Lands Lots of Tyrion talking in King\u2019s Landing but not much else. HBO 15/73 59. Season six, episode seven: The Broken Man The Hound meets Ian McShane. That\u2019s about it in an episode full of preparations. HBO 16/73 58. Season three, episode one: Valar Dohaeris A classic season opener that flits from place to place. HBO 17/73 57. Season two, episode four: Garden of Bones Lots of grimness. Rat and bucket torture at Harrenhal. Robb Stark meets Talisa. Joffrey is cruel to Ros and Daisy. HBO 18/73 56. Season five, episode one: The Wars to Come Mance Rayder refuses to bend the knee, is burned at the stake by Stannis before Jon shoots him with an arrow. A pretty good death actually. HBO 19/73 55. Season five, episode five: Kill the Boy Season five is perhaps the weakest, and this is one of the weakest episodes in it, despite some good Bolton action and the Stone Men\u2019s fateful attack on Tyrion and Jorah Mormont as they sailed through Valyria. HBO 20/73 54. Season two, episode one: The North Remembers In the season two opener we meet Stannis at Dragonstone, and then Joffrey orders a tremendous infanticide. It was vaguely controversial at the time. Feels like a lifetime ago. \u2018Power is power,\u2019 Cersei tells Littlefinger, which was good. HBO 21/73 53. Season six, episode three: Oathbreaker Jon Snow coming back to life really shouldn\u2019t have felt flat. Yet it did. HBO 22/73 52. Season one, episode three: Lord Snow Understandable given that it had to build an entire medieval universe, but 12 major characters are introduced here. That\u2019s too many major characters. HBO 23/73 51. Season six, epsidoe four: Book of the Stranger Jon and Sansa reunite, which is cool, Daenerys burns some more enemies, which is hot, good High Sparrow monologue to Margaery. HBO 24/73 50. Season three, episode six: The Climb Theme of climbing. Thormund makes his way up the Wall; Littlefinger gives his most famous monologue, as he explains to Varys that chaos is \u2018a ladder\u2019. HBO 25/73 49. Season five, episode two: Sons of the Harpy Mid-season doldrums, particularly acute in five, as Jaime and Bronn arrive in Dorne. HBO 26/73 48. Season five, episode seven: The Gift The same, basically, except for Tyrion meeting Daenerys. Everyone gives each other presents. HBO 27/73 47. Season three, episode two: Dark Wings, Dark Words Sluggish early-season number, although we meet Olenna and Margaery shows how skilful she will be at manipulating court. HBO 28/73 46. Season one, episode eight: The Pointy End Until the later series, eight episodes are a bit hamstrung by setting up denouements to follow. This is true in season one, as the machinery creaks to set up the beheading they didn\u2019t think could happen. HBO 29/73 45. Season three, episode seven: The Bear and the Maiden Fair Even re-looking at what happened in this episode I still can\u2019t really remember it, except for the fight with the bear. Oh yes, Mackenzie Crook! Forgot he was in this programme. HBO 30/73 44. Season two, episode five: The Ghost of Harrenhal Two good moments: Renly is killed by the shadow, and Arya meets Jaqen H\u2019ghar. HBO 31/73 43. Season eight, episode two: 'A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms' Another slow scene setter for the epic Battle of Winterfell, full of night-before antics including the knighting of Brienne by Jamie, and the slightly disturbing sight of Arya and Gendry preparing to go at it hammer and tongs. HBO 32/73 42. Season six, episode two: Home The demise of top lad Roose Bolton, as well as Balon Greyjoy, both sent to their ends by their families. Melisandre finally works her anti-death magic on Jon Snow. HBO 33/73 41. Season four, episode five: First of His Name One of the good things about season four was that it was the only moment where, even briefly, it looked as though a kind of temporary stability had been achieved. Tommen is king, Sansa has escaped King\u2019s Landing, Jon Snow and co get revenge on the mutineers at Craster\u2019s Keep. HBO 34/73 40. Season two, episode 10: Valar Morghulis The White Walkers attacking the Night\u2019s Watch at the Fist of the First Men is a good laugh, but other than that there is a lot to get through, after the events of Blackwater in the previous episode, and the season two finale anticipates some of the rushed feeling that will occur later on. HBO 35/73 39. Season one, episode seven: You Win or You Die Our first real glimpse of what Cersei will become, as she outmanoeuvres Ned Stark after Robert Baratheon\u2019s death in a hunting accident. HBO 36/73 38. Season seven, episode one: Dragonstone A superb Arya moment, as she wipes out the rest of House Frey, but mainly this is set-up for a season that packs a lot in. HBO 37/73 37. Season one, episode four: Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things Ned working as policeman in Kings Landing to find out what happened to Jon Arryn. HBO 38/73 36. Season five, episode nine: Dance of Dragons One of the most upsetting deaths in Game of Thrones, as Stannis Baratheon burns his friendly daughter Shireen alive to appease Melisandre. HBO 39/73 35. Season seven, episode two: Stormborn Theon jumping off the boat after Euron overruns the Greyjoy fleet. Nice reunion between Arya and Hot Pie. Tyrion talks Daenerys down from incinerating King\u2019s Landing. HBO 40/73 34. Season eight, episode one: 'Winterfell' A slower than expected opener for the final season, albeit with some touching reunions at Winterfell, especially Bran and Jamie seeing each other again. 41/73 33. Season six, episode six: Blood of My Blood Midseasoner. Cersei sends Jaime to retake Riverrun, while Arya is finally trained as an assassin. Can\u2019t really remember it, to be honest. HBO 42/73 32. Season one, episode five: The Wolf and the Lion Jaime and Ned have a brawl in the streets of King\u2019s Landing in an episode that focuses on skulduggery rather than magic. If you ask me skulduggery always trumps magic. HBO 43/73 31. Season three, episode three: Walk of Punishment The first moment where a character\u2019s trajectory was really reversed. We\u2019d disliked Jaime since the start, but when his hand was chopped off he began to win us back. The Blackfish schooling Edmure at shooting fire arrows was another highlight. HBO 44/73 30. Season four, episode one: Two Swords The opening of the fourth series introduced the charismatic, enigmatic Viper of Dorne, one of the few good things other than wine to come out of Dorne. Also notable for an excellent scene with Arya and the Hound clearing out an Inn. HBO 45/73 29. Season two, episode three: What is Dead May Never Die Introduces Margaery Tyrell and Brienne of Tarth, two of the best characters, and also sees Theon decide to betray Robb Stark. What is family? Who can you trust? HBO 46/73 28. Season three, episode eight: Second Sons Built around Sansa and Tyrion\u2019s unwelcome wedding, while in the north there is a display of how important Sam will be as he draws on reserves of bravery to dragonglass a white walker. HBO 47/73 27. Season four, episode seven: Mockingbird Littlefinger dumping Lysa out of the Eyrie is probably the most dramatic moment here, one of his decisive power-stealing moments as he saves Sansa. HBO 48/73 26. Season one, episode one: Winter Is Coming Can you remember a time before Game of Thrones? Re-watch \u2018Winter is Coming\u2019, marvel at the baby Starks, think on how many characters have died, reflect on your own mortality. You are much, much older than when Game of Thrones began. Your life is running between your fingers. HBO 49/73 25. Season one, episode six: A Golden Crown Another dramatic death which is hard to remember now, as the miserable Viserys was put out of his grump with molten gold. HBO 50/73 24: Season eight, episode six: 'The Iron Throne' Well, that was that. The grand finale provoked much gnashing of teeth and hot air, not all of it from Drogon. In truth, things were tied up as best they could, given the way the the different pieces had been arranged, although some of the criticism was valid. The king-choosing and first council scenes were amazingly lame. A number of questions were skirted over. Still, what a spectacle. HBO 51/73 23. Season two, episode six: Old Gods and the New Theon takes Winterfell. Theon, you utter bastard. I hope you are punished for this. HBO 52/73 22. Season five, episode three: High Sparrow A key Littlefinger episode, as he continues to manipulate Sansa, while Jon Snow executes Janos and, in King\u2019s Landing, Cersei\u2019s machinations are matched by Margaery\u2019s. HBO 53/73 21. Season four, episode two: The Lion and the Rose Joffrey, scratching at his throat, going purple, dying. Top stuff. HBO 54/73 20. Season four, episode six: The Laws of Gods and Men An excellent mid-season episode, built around Tyrion\u2019s trial but with lots of other things to admire that hint at the underlying economies in the Game of Thrones universe. Drogon barbecues some livestock, while the Iron Bank of Braavos refuses to bail out Davos and Stannis. HBO 55/73 19. Season three, episode four: And Now His Watch Is Ended The full depravity of Ramsay Bolton is laid bare as he taunts Theon with a fake escape, while Commander Mormont is murdered at Craster\u2019s Keep. But really it\u2019s all about Daenerys, as she and her pets flame Astapor to the ground. HBO 56/73 18. Season seven, episode seven: The Dragon and the Wolf It turns out Jon Snow is actually the true heir to the Seven Kingdoms, the remaining Stark children finally team up to kill Littlefinger, admittedly in overwrought style, and the White Walkers use their new lizard hairdryer to destroy the wall. There is far too much going on, especially the odd scene where Jon shows Cersei the wight, but nevertheless it sends you reaching for the popcorn and cheering along, which is more or less where we are at with the whole series by now. HBO 57/73 17. Season three, episode five: Kissed by Fire Most notable for Ygritte and Jon\u2019s much-parodied love grotto scene, but also for the Hound\u2019s duel with Bendric Dondarrion, which revealed his terror of fire. Nursing his stump in the baths, Jaime tells Brienne the truth about his assassination of the Mad King. Mid-seasoner. HBO 58/73 16. Season five, episode 10: Mother\u2019s Mercy The denouement of the fifth series is the most sympathetic we ever see Cersei, as she completes her walk of atonement through the streets of King\u2019s Landing, her hair cut and her clothes stripped. Strategically, humiliating Cersei proves not to be the masterstroke the High Sparrow thought it would be. HBO 59/73 15. Season seven, episode four: The Spoils of War Spoils aplenty. Arya returns to Winterfell and sees Sansa, then fights a brief duel with Brienne that shows just how much she\u2019s learnt. It\u2019s nothing on one of the great shots of the whole series, however: Daenerys riding Drogon above a Dothraki horde in full charge before incinerating the Lannister lines. HBO 60/73 14. Season one, episode 10: Fire and Blood We were promised dragons, and here they are, mewing atop the naked Daenerys. And one thing we know about baby dragons is they must grow up. This is Game of Thrones\u2019 version of Chekhov\u2019s rule about guns. You\u2019ll keep watching until they torch something. HBO 61/73 13. Season five, episode eight: Hardhome As the big battles go, the showdown between the Night\u2019s Watch and wildlings and the wights at Hardhome doesn\u2019t quite match some of the others, but it is still dead cool, especially when Jon realises his sword works against the snowmen. If that wasn\u2019t enough, Sansa also learnt that her family might be alive. HBO 62/73 12. Season four, episode nine: The Watchers on the Wall The big set-piece between the Night\u2019s Watch and the wildlings. Not quite up to Blackwater\u2019s standards, despite its battle specialist Neil Marshall being summonsed back to direct. HBO 63/73 11. Season seven, episode three: The Queen\u2019s Justice There is too much crammed into this episode, which could have been spread over several hours, but it\u2019s wonderful stuff all the same. Jon meets Daenerys for the first time, Sam cures Jorah of greyscale, Cersei obliterates the Tyrells. Best of all is Diana Rigg, at a table in her tower, bowing out from what is perhaps Thrones\u2019 best overall performance. HBO 64/73 10. Season eight, episode five One of the most divisive episodes, as Dany\u2019s frustrations spilled over into a holocaust in King\u2019s Landing. Whatever you thought of the pacing, or the plot\u2019s fidelity to the characters, it was quite a spectacle, and killed off several key figures in dramatic style. HBO 65/73 9. Season six, episode five: The Door Poor old Hodor. The death nobody wanted, as a wonderful character, played so sympathetically by Kristian Nairn, is finally given his due. HBO 66/73 8. Season four, episode eight: The Mountain and the Viper Other things happen: Littlefinger takes over the Vale, and the Boltons move into Winterfell, but the episode is mainly memorable for the central duel, as Oberyn seeks justice from the man who murdered so many of his relatives, and for one image above all, of the Mountain\u2019s armoured fingers crushing Oberyn\u2019s skull like a grapefruit. HBO 67/73 7. Season one, episode nine: Baelor Poor old Ned Stark. The death they said could never happen! Clearly they had not watched enough Sean Bean films. HBO 68/73 6. Season eight, episode three: The Long Night After two scene-setting episodes, The Long Night finally delivers on the promise of season eight, with 90 minutes of marvellous blood and fire at Winterfell. The Night King\u2019s hordes meet the assembled ranks of Westeros, wildlings, Dothraki and Unsullied. The defenders lose and lose and lose until they finally win, although not before a few spectacular deaths. If it lacks some of the strategic nuance of other battles, it compensates with stunning action sequences and CGI, especially on the dragons, who dogfight high above the plain. HBO 69/73 5. Season six, episode 10: The Winds of Winter Winter has come. It opens with peak Cersei, as she eliminates all her remaining enemies in one enormous blaze. Arya kills Walder Frey. The Jon Theory is confirmed. Tommen walks out of the window. HBO 70/73 4. Season three, episode nine: Rains of Castemere The Lannisters send their regards. Some would have this number one, and one could easily make the case. The Red Wedding was the scene that broke Game of Thrones out of its fandom and into broader popular culture, the point where it was no longer avoidable. Fury, anguish, love, surprise, pity, hate: it\u2019s all here. The look Roose Bolton gives Catelyn Stark when she reveals the chainmail he is wearing to dinner might be my single favourite moment of the whole programme. HBO 71/73 3. Season six, episode nine: Battle of the Bastards Anyone who has seen Mel Gibson\u2019s Mayan drama Apocalypto knows that running in a straight line away from arrows rarely works. So it proved for Rickon, setting up one of the great battles not only on TV but on any kind of film. Where in previous seasons battles had occasionally felt hampered by budget, most egregiously when Tyrion was knocked out and missed the whole thing, this was the full belt and braces. It was brilliantly directed, with aerial shots, as well as face-in-the-mud close-ups to convey the full grinding horror of the battle, and the grim relief of victory. HBO 72/73 2. Season four, episode 10: The Children The fourth season is the best all-round, I think, the high-point of character development before it started to be forced by the machinations of the plot in the later series. Brienne\u2019s bloody brawl with the Hound leaves him bleeding and broken, as Arya heads off to Braavos. Tywin finally gets his comeuppance, a crossbow bolt on the loo, administered by his son, Tyrion, who then flees. And Stannis\u2019s cavalry arrives to save Jon and defeat Mance Rayder and the wildlings in a pincer movement, having been persuaded by Davos. HBO 73/73 1. Season two, episode nine: Blackwater This is purely a personal view, but if Ned Stark\u2019s death was the moment you sat up and paid attention, Blackwater was the where you started cheering at the TV. The scale, the splendour, the depth of character brought to bear on grand events: they all felt new, somehow. This might have been the last moment where we were equally rooting for both sides, except for one side to be consumed in an eerie green glow. Wildfire doesn\u2019t care who your favourite character is. HBO 1/73 73. Season seven, episode five: Eastwatch There has to be a loser. \u2018Eastwatch\u2019 throws away one of the most important pieces of information in the whole show, Jon\u2019s true parentage, as well as lots of good reunions. It\u2019s the clearest example of how rushed the show has become in recent years, as its unpredictability gives way to conventional plot. HBO 2/73 72. Season four, episode three: Breaker of Chains Jaime appears to rape Cersei next to Joffrey\u2019s corpse. The scene is confused, unpleasant and different from the books in confusing and unhelpful ways. HBO 3/73 71. Season five, episode six: Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken The Sand Snakes are just unbearably naff and this is one of their worst. HBO 4/73 70. Season four, episode four: Oathkeeper At Craster\u2019s Keep, much rape and murder of children. Unpleasant. HBO 5/73 69.

Season seven, episode two: Stormborn Theon jumping off the boat after Euron overruns the Greyjoy fleet. Nice reunion between Arya and Hot Pie. Tyrion talks Daenerys down from incinerating King\u2019s Landing. HBO 40/73 34. Season eight, episode one: 'Winterfell' A slower than expected opener for the final season, albeit with some touching reunions at Winterfell, especially Bran and Jamie seeing each other again. 41/73 33. Season six, episode six: Blood of My Blood Midseasoner. Cersei sends Jaime to retake Riverrun, while Arya is finally trained as an assassin. Can\u2019t really remember it, to be honest. HBO 42/73 32. Season one, episode five: The Wolf and the Lion Jaime and Ned have a brawl in the streets of King\u2019s Landing in an episode that focuses on skulduggery rather than magic. If you ask me skulduggery always trumps magic. HBO 43/73 31. Season three, episode three: Walk of Punishment The first moment where a character\u2019s trajectory was really reversed. We\u2019d disliked Jaime since the start, but when his hand was chopped off he began to win us back. The Blackfish schooling Edmure at shooting fire arrows was another highlight. HBO 44/73 30. Season four, episode one: Two Swords The opening of the fourth series introduced the charismatic, enigmatic Viper of Dorne, one of the few good things other than wine to come out of Dorne. Also notable for an excellent scene with Arya and the Hound clearing out an Inn. HBO 45/73 29. Season two, episode three: What is Dead May Never Die Introduces Margaery Tyrell and Brienne of Tarth, two of the best characters, and also sees Theon decide to betray Robb Stark. What is family? Who can you trust? HBO 46/73 28. Season three, episode eight: Second Sons Built around Sansa and Tyrion\u2019s unwelcome wedding, while in the north there is a display of how important Sam will be as he draws on reserves of bravery to dragonglass a white walker. HBO 47/73 27. Season four, episode seven: Mockingbird Littlefinger dumping Lysa out of the Eyrie is probably the most dramatic moment here, one of his decisive power-stealing moments as he saves Sansa. HBO 48/73 26. Season one, episode one: Winter Is Coming Can you remember a time before Game of Thrones? Re-watch \u2018Winter is Coming\u2019, marvel at the baby Starks, think on how many characters have died, reflect on your own mortality. You are much, much older than when Game of Thrones began. Your life is running between your fingers. HBO 49/73 25. Season one, episode six: A Golden Crown Another dramatic death which is hard to remember now, as the miserable Viserys was put out of his grump with molten gold. HBO 50/73 24: Season eight, episode six: 'The Iron Throne' Well, that was that. The grand finale provoked much gnashing of teeth and hot air, not all of it from Drogon. In truth, things were tied up as best they could, given the way the the different pieces had been arranged, although some of the criticism was valid. The king-choosing and first council scenes were amazingly lame. A number of questions were skirted over. Still, what a spectacle. HBO 51/73 23. Season two, episode six: Old Gods and the New Theon takes Winterfell. Theon, you utter bastard. I hope you are punished for this. HBO 52/73 22. Season five, episode three: High Sparrow A key Littlefinger episode, as he continues to manipulate Sansa, while Jon Snow executes Janos and, in King\u2019s Landing, Cersei\u2019s machinations are matched by Margaery\u2019s. HBO 53/73 21. Season four, episode two: The Lion and the Rose Joffrey, scratching at his throat, going purple, dying. Top stuff. HBO 54/73 20. Season four, episode six: The Laws of Gods and Men An excellent mid-season episode, built around Tyrion\u2019s trial but with lots of other things to admire that hint at the underlying economies in the Game of Thrones universe. Drogon barbecues some livestock, while the Iron Bank of Braavos refuses to bail out Davos and Stannis. HBO 55/73 19. Season three, episode four: And Now His Watch Is Ended The full depravity of Ramsay Bolton is laid bare as he taunts Theon with a fake escape, while Commander Mormont is murdered at Craster\u2019s Keep. But really it\u2019s all about Daenerys, as she and her pets flame Astapor to the ground. HBO 56/73 18. Season seven, episode seven: The Dragon and the Wolf It turns out Jon Snow is actually the true heir to the Seven Kingdoms, the remaining Stark children finally team up to kill Littlefinger, admittedly in overwrought style, and the White Walkers use their new lizard hairdryer to destroy the wall. There is far too much going on, especially the odd scene where Jon shows Cersei the wight, but nevertheless it sends you reaching for the popcorn and cheering along, which is more or less where we are at with the whole series by now. HBO 57/73 17. Season three, episode five: Kissed by Fire Most notable for Ygritte and Jon\u2019s much-parodied love grotto scene, but also for the Hound\u2019s duel with Bendric Dondarrion, which revealed his terror of fire. Nursing his stump in the baths, Jaime tells Brienne the truth about his assassination of the Mad King. Mid-seasoner. HBO 58/73 16. Season five, episode 10: Mother\u2019s Mercy The denouement of the fifth series is the most sympathetic we ever see Cersei, as she completes her walk of atonement through the streets of King\u2019s Landing, her hair cut and her clothes stripped. Strategically, humiliating Cersei proves not to be the masterstroke the High Sparrow thought it would be. HBO 59/73 15. Season seven, episode four: The Spoils of War Spoils aplenty. Arya returns to Winterfell and sees Sansa, then fights a brief duel with Brienne that shows just how much she\u2019s learnt. It\u2019s nothing on one of the great shots of the whole series, however: Daenerys riding Drogon above a Dothraki horde in full charge before incinerating the Lannister lines. HBO 60/73 14. Season one, episode 10: Fire and Blood We were promised dragons, and here they are, mewing atop the naked Daenerys. And one thing we know about baby dragons is they must grow up. This is Game of Thrones\u2019 version of Chekhov\u2019s rule about guns. You\u2019ll keep watching until they torch something. HBO 61/73 13. Season five, episode eight: Hardhome As the big battles go, the showdown between the Night\u2019s Watch and wildlings and the wights at Hardhome doesn\u2019t quite match some of the others, but it is still dead cool, especially when Jon realises his sword works against the snowmen. If that wasn\u2019t enough, Sansa also learnt that her family might be alive. HBO 62/73 12. Season four, episode nine: The Watchers on the Wall The big set-piece between the Night\u2019s Watch and the wildlings. Not quite up to Blackwater\u2019s standards, despite its battle specialist Neil Marshall being summonsed back to direct. HBO 63/73 11. Season seven, episode three: The Queen\u2019s Justice There is too much crammed into this episode, which could have been spread over several hours, but it\u2019s wonderful stuff all the same. Jon meets Daenerys for the first time, Sam cures Jorah of greyscale, Cersei obliterates the Tyrells. Best of all is Diana Rigg, at a table in her tower, bowing out from what is perhaps Thrones\u2019 best overall performance. HBO 64/73 10. Season eight, episode five One of the most divisive episodes, as Dany\u2019s frustrations spilled over into a holocaust in King\u2019s Landing. Whatever you thought of the pacing, or the plot\u2019s fidelity to the characters, it was quite a spectacle, and killed off several key figures in dramatic style. HBO 65/73 9. Season six, episode five: The Door Poor old Hodor. The death nobody wanted, as a wonderful character, played so sympathetically by Kristian Nairn, is finally given his due. HBO 66/73 8. Season four, episode eight: The Mountain and the Viper Other things happen: Littlefinger takes over the Vale, and the Boltons move into Winterfell, but the episode is mainly memorable for the central duel, as Oberyn seeks justice from the man who murdered so many of his relatives, and for one image above all, of the Mountain\u2019s armoured fingers crushing Oberyn\u2019s skull like a grapefruit. HBO 67/73 7. Season one, episode nine: Baelor Poor old Ned Stark. The death they said could never happen! Clearly they had not watched enough Sean Bean films. HBO 68/73 6. Season eight, episode three: The Long Night After two scene-setting episodes, The Long Night finally delivers on the promise of season eight, with 90 minutes of marvellous blood and fire at Winterfell. The Night King\u2019s hordes meet the assembled ranks of Westeros, wildlings, Dothraki and Unsullied. The defenders lose and lose and lose until they finally win, although not before a few spectacular deaths. If it lacks some of the strategic nuance of other battles, it compensates with stunning action sequences and CGI, especially on the dragons, who dogfight high above the plain. HBO 69/73 5. Season six, episode 10: The Winds of Winter Winter has come. It opens with peak Cersei, as she eliminates all her remaining enemies in one enormous blaze. Arya kills Walder Frey. The Jon Theory is confirmed. Tommen walks out of the window. HBO 70/73 4. Season three, episode nine: Rains of Castemere The Lannisters send their regards. Some would have this number one, and one could easily make the case. The Red Wedding was the scene that broke Game of Thrones out of its fandom and into broader popular culture, the point where it was no longer avoidable. Fury, anguish, love, surprise, pity, hate: it\u2019s all here. The look Roose Bolton gives Catelyn Stark when she reveals the chainmail he is wearing to dinner might be my single favourite moment of the whole programme. HBO 71/73 3. Season six, episode nine: Battle of the Bastards Anyone who has seen Mel Gibson\u2019s Mayan drama Apocalypto knows that running in a straight line away from arrows rarely works. So it proved for Rickon, setting up one of the great battles not only on TV but on any kind of film. Where in previous seasons battles had occasionally felt hampered by budget, most egregiously when Tyrion was knocked out and missed the whole thing, this was the full belt and braces. It was brilliantly directed, with aerial shots, as well as face-in-the-mud close-ups to convey the full grinding horror of the battle, and the grim relief of victory. HBO 72/73 2. Season four, episode 10: The Children The fourth season is the best all-round, I think, the high-point of character development before it started to be forced by the machinations of the plot in the later series. Brienne\u2019s bloody brawl with the Hound leaves him bleeding and broken, as Arya heads off to Braavos. Tywin finally gets his comeuppance, a crossbow bolt on the loo, administered by his son, Tyrion, who then flees. And Stannis\u2019s cavalry arrives to save Jon and defeat Mance Rayder and the wildlings in a pincer movement, having been persuaded by Davos. HBO 73/73 1. Season two, episode nine: Blackwater This is purely a personal view, but if Ned Stark\u2019s death was the moment you sat up and paid attention, Blackwater was the where you started cheering at the TV. The scale, the splendour, the depth of character brought to bear on grand events: they all felt new, somehow. This might have been the last moment where we were equally rooting for both sides, except for one side to be consumed in an eerie green glow. Wildfire doesn\u2019t care who your favourite character is.
