Rand Paul, the Republican senator from Kentucky, has written a new book called The Case for Socialism.\n\nNot so long ago, it would have been unnecessary or an exercise in red-baiting for a sitting senator to publish such a volume. Socialism was last an electorally viable ideology in the early 20th century. Eugene Debs has been dead since 1926, Norman Thomas since 1968. Even if an idea with mainstream appeal arguably had a socialist pedigree, the use of the \u201cs-word\u201d would render it politically radioactive.\n\nBut in 2019, Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator who has for decades self-described as a socialist, is in the midst of his second consecutive Democratic presidential campaign. If Sanders falters, it will likely have more to do with his age and the rise of a less curmudgeonly progressive in the person of Elizabeth Warren than his socialism. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez also calls herself a socialist. The freshman New York Democrat leads \u201cThe Squad\u201d and has become the political equivalent of a rock star.\n\nOut with the Paul Ryan Roadmap, in with AOC\u2019s Green New Deal. Even the ostensible centrists are getting into the act. \u201cIt\u2019s time to stop worrying about what the Republicans will say. It\u2019s true that if we embrace a far left agenda, they\u2019re going to say we\u2019re a bunch of crazy socialists,\u201d said Pete Buttigieg, the South Bend, Ind., mayor seeking the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. \u201cIf we embrace a conservative agenda, you know what they\u2019re going to do? They\u2019re going to say we\u2019re a bunch of crazy socialists. Let\u2019s stand up for the right policy, go up there and defend it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s true that Republicans have been attacking \u201ccreeping socialism\u201d\u2014a term coined by Friedrich Hayek back in 1944\u2014since at least the days of Dwight Eisenhower. But you would have to go all the way back to Henry Wallace to find a Democrat of serious national importance who wouldn\u2019t run from the phrase screaming.\n\nSo for the first time in decades, it has become necessary to push back against the previously unthinkable. That\u2019s why Paul, who has previously written books about partisan politics, over-government hurting ordinary people, and his rise through the Tea Party, has taken on this task. The senator has continued to champion fiscal conservatism even as it has fallen out of vogue inside the GOP and has tried to push Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign-policy instincts in a more consistently antiwar direction.\n\nAs if Paul didn\u2019t have enough on his plate already battling the neocons inside his own party, he is now taking aim at Democratic socialists. \u201cPresident Trump is right to be concerned about socialism coming to America,\u201d he writes. \u201cA recent Gallup poll indicates that 57 percent of Democrats have a favorable view of socialism.\u201d\n\nEspecially susceptible to socialism\u2019s siren song? Young voters who grew up watching stock market crashes wipe out their parents\u2019 retirement savings and who themselves have graduated from college already deeply in debt. Factor in rising health care costs eating into wage growth and the erosion steady lifetime jobs enjoyed in the post World War II era, and government seems less like the problem Ronald Reagan spoke of more like a solution.\n\nThere is also the matter of conflating capitalism with its cronyist variant, as big business and big government frequently work hand in glove. \u201cBoth the left and right were correct,\u201d Paul writes of the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street\u2019s shared opposition to the big bank bailouts during the financial crisis. \u201cThe bailout was the very definition of crony capitalism.\u201d Yet socialism, he argues, inevitably leads to cronyism itself.\n\nMuch of Paul\u2019s book is devoted to pointing out that when socialism is taken to its most radical conclusions, it degenerates into starvation and death camps, not playing cute AOC videos on your iPhone or wearing a Che Guevara t-shirt on your college campus. Critics will undoubtedly quibble that the Democrats are advocating a New Deal liberalism on steroids that falls well short of communism or National Socialism. But the ideological underpinnings of capitalism are coming under new questioning, similar pushback against socialism is only\u2014to use a word much beloved by socialists\u2014fair.\n\n\u201cMy hope is that the next generation will understand that free markets and free people have produced better health, longer life expectancy, and reduced poverty and suffering around the world,\u201d Paul concludes. \u201cMy hope is that they will choose liberty.\u201d A real social base and electoral coalition (as Paul, the winner of two elections and the son of a man elected to Congress three times as a non-incumbent, surely knows) as well as economics instruction and appeals to abstract principle. But The Case Against Socialism is a start.\n\nW.
