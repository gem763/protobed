He said he\u2019d had sex with his teenage stepdaughter.\n\n\u201cShe was very attractive,\u201d he said. \u201cMature for her age. We kind of fell into it.\u201d\n\nOne night several months into his treatment, I had a dream. We were in the middle of group therapy. Jay got up, strode across the middle of the group and picked me up with my arms pinned to my sides. I fought with him as he unflinchingly overpowered me and tore off my clothes. I woke up in the dark with my heart pounding, shaken. The rest of the night I tossed and turned, the experience too real to shake.\n\nThe next day at the office I went directly to Jay\u2019s file and read carefully through the police reports. I was stunned, yet somehow not surprised, to find that he had raped his stepdaughter. The case had been reduced to sex with a minor as part of a plea agreement.\n\nThe shock wasn\u2019t that he had lied, it was more that we hadn\u2019t questioned it sooner. His story had been believable, and his manner seductive. But a quiet part of me, my unconscious mind, had paid attention. It refused to be seduced by him. I will always listen to that part of myself now.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nI started my career working with victims of sexual abuse but eventually began working directly with the perpetrators. Later I started evaluating violent sex offenders in California prisons for potential release. It\u2019s a world in which a routine day has me confronted with the darkest and most twisted acts imaginable. And my decisions could mean an offender is indefinitely committed to a mental institution \u2013 or that they get released back into society.\n\nI\u2019m often asked how I can stand to face these men. They should be imprisoned for life, publicly identified, barred from common spaces and participation in civic life, right? They should be tarred and feathered, stoned, segregated into a special zone far, far away from our children and loved ones. Even in prison, they inhabit the lowest rung of a brutal hierarchy.\n\nI\u2019ve spent hundreds upon hundreds of hours interviewing these men about their childhoods, their frustrations, their demons and their drives, and the terrible crimes they have committed. Sometimes these interviews are brutal. Sometimes they are tinged with unexpected moments of understanding and compassion. But the truth of my experience is that not all sex offenders are monsters. They are humans \u2013 people we may even know and see every day.\n\nAnd yet, of course, I feel deeply protective of my own family \u2013 a paradox I confront again and again as my work uncomfortably collides with my life as a woman, wife, and mother of three.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nI\u2019m interviewing James, whose long rap sheet started as a middle schooler and encompasses pimping, stealing, and several sexual assaults. During the interview, he\u2019s a smooth operator; it\u2019s obvious he\u2019s able to talk his way out of trouble most of the time. He gazes at me through lids halfway down, a smile playing on his face. He makes everything an inside joke and laughs easily. But almost nothing he says is funny to me.\n\nThroughout the interview I remain neutral. I want him to talk as openly as possible, so I appear open enough to form a connection, then knock him off balance every now and then with a question he doesn\u2019t expect. I ask him about high school. He says he was pimping by the time he was 16; his cousin initiated him into the business.\n\n\u201cYeah, I was good,\u201d he brags. \u201cI would bend \u2019em and send \u2019em.\u201d\n\n\n\nI take this to mean that he had sex with the women who \u201cworked for him\u201d whenever he wanted. I refrain from making a face. I ask him just to be sure. \u201cWhat exactly does that mean?\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest This story is part of Anxy\u2019s latest issue on masculinity. Learn more here. Illustration: Anxy Magazine\n\n\u201cI was born hung,\u201d he explains. \u201cI can stick my magic wand in them and show them the ropes before I send them out there to do their thing.\u201d\n\nHe goes on like this during the interview, talking with relish about his penis size, his sexual prowess, the ways he\u2019s used women. I\u2019m revolted, but the sexism and misogyny are so extreme it almost seems unreal. I write it all down, thinking about how he\u2019s so caught up in the pleasure of himself that he forgets who he\u2019s speaking to, and the consequences. He speaks to me using my first name. I correct him. He continues to do it anyway.\n\nHe keeps talking, looking at me, touching his shirt. It takes me a minute to realize: yes, that really is his erect penis under his shirt. He\u2019s touching himself.\n\nI look directly into his eyes. \u201cAre you stimulating yourself? You need to stop immediately.\u201d\n\n\u201cNah, nah, I wasn\u2019t doing nothing,\u201d he replies, quickly adjusting his pants, sitting up in his chair.\n\nI take a deep breath and compose myself. My stomach is tight and I\u2019m shaken, but I need to complete this interview; I\u2019ll deal with my feelings later. Honestly, I\u2019m stunned. Not so much that he would do such a thing, but by his lack of control. I could recommend that he gets committed indefinitely based on his sexual behavior, and this is what he chooses to do? For the rest of the interview he refers to me as \u201cDoc\u201d and does not touch himself again.\n\nAfter the interview I report his behavior to the prison. My final evaluation states that he meets the criteria for a sexually violent predator; his actions were just one more example of how little restraint he has. I think about him even after I\u2019m done: his lack of control, his disregard for women, the audacity to think he can get away with anything, his egoism that I would believe his bullshit stories, his arrogance that I would sit there while he got himself off.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nThat evening, I head out for a walk after the kids are in bed. I\u2019m stressed \u2013 about money, about getting work done, about not having exercised. With three children and a mortgage, there\u2019s never enough time or money. I walk fast to try to get the workout I desperately need, but as I do, I\u2019m aware, as most women would be, of the places the moonlight and streetlamps don\u2019t reach. A lit cigarette in a doorway \u2013 is it a man or a woman standing there? I wish it didn\u2019t matter.\n\nI used to run treatment groups for sex offenders. At the time, my work actually made me less afraid. I genuinely liked many of the guys and knew they respected me, even felt protective of me. Walking home afterwards I felt a sense of security \u2013 false, perhaps \u2013 that I wouldn\u2019t be attacked by a man who knew I had the phone number of his parole officer. I felt, and still feel, safe, comfortable, and at home around men.\n\nBut in other ways I\u2019ve become more pessimistic. After reading about hundreds upon hundreds of victimizations, it begins to feel inevitable and unstoppable. Men seem to pose a terrible threat. My husband, my male colleagues, my friends \u2013 they all live in the same world with James, Jay, and the others I have to evaluate.\n\nProfessionally, though, I know different. Yes, a small percentage of men who commit sex crimes are incapable of empathy; or worse, take pleasure in the suffering of those they violate. But most sex offenders are not psychopaths. They are men raised in a horrible system \u2013 frequently having suffered trauma, or abuse, or both \u2013 who lack the tools to navigate their emotions, and end up traumatizing others as a result. Or they are men who have paraphilic desires \u2013 that is, recurrent, intense, distressing, arousing fantasies that involve objects, suffering, humiliation, children, or a lack of consent \u2013but have too much shame to seek the help they need to make sure they don\u2019t hurt other people.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nI\u2019m on my way to interview Leo, a 37-year-old man I last evaluated a year ago. At the time, I decided he met the criteria of a sexually violent predator, but he ended up being released from prison anyway (my opinion is not the only factor taken into account). A year later he was sent back to jail for a minor parole violation, so now he\u2019s being evaluated again \u2013 the law requires a fresh decision.\n\nI go expecting to reaffirm my earlier evaluation. It wasn\u2019t especially challenging last time; Leo was full of nervous habits and lied his way through the entire interview. He was suspicious, a drug addict, and a career criminal whose past included several attempted rapes.\n\nBut sitting down with him today I\u2019m shocked. He\u2019s a completely different person.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m crying so much,\u201d he says, wiping his face with his sleeve. \u201cMy therapist says I\u2019m crying all the time because I\u2019m off drugs for the first time in my life. I\u2019m feeling my feelings now.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour therapist?\u201d I ask, almost disbelieving that this is the same man I met before. A year earlier he would never have gone to a therapist, had feelings, or cried openly.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he replies shyly, looking down. \u201cHe\u2019s really helping me.\u201d\n\nHe has tear tattoos, two of them, just below the lower corner of each eye. I don\u2019t ask Leo what they symbolize. Instead I watch the real tears that run alongside them for the entire hour we speak.\n\n\u201cI feel so bad about all I did,\u201d he says, crying again. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to make up for it. I help people whenever I can. Now that I\u2019m off drugs I feel for people. I feel bad for them. I never felt that before. Sometimes it\u2019s almost too much.\u201d\n\nHe talks with pride about how he stayed out of prison for a whole year this time. It\u2019s the longest he\u2019s been out of jail since he was 15.\n\n\u201cI got a real job,\u201d he says, smiling. \u201cI have a car and it\u2019s registered and I have insurance.\n\n\u201cI have a girlfriend, too. I\u2019ve never had a relationship.\u201d\n\nThe hour goes by and he is emotional, insightful, and humble. I write it all down. I\u2019m deeply moved by the experience \u2013 by the obvious change in him. I want to reverse my original decision, but it doesn\u2019t matter what I want or don\u2019t want. It\u2019s my job to decide objectively. When I get home, I set the interview aside. It feels too sad. I\u2019ll pick it up in a few days.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nMost men who commit a sex offense are not irredeemable or unworthy of a future in our society. Having performed therapy with sexual offenders for over a decade, I have been repeatedly surprised at the capacity for change. Not everyone is a James or a Jay.\n\nThere are Leos out there too, even if it is hard for us to accept.\n\nStatistics bear out my experience. The number of sex offenders who re-offend is small relative to many other crimes, and the proper treatment \u2013 a program that addresses their thinking and behavior directly, and is designed, based on research, to prevent them from offending again \u2013 can reduce that number even further. One analysis of treatment studies showed that sex offenders who got treatment were re-arrested only 7.2% of the time, while those who went untreated re-offended at a rate of 17.6%. That\u2019s significant. (By comparison, a 1994 study showed that robbers were re-arrested at a rate of 70.2%, burglars at 74%, and motor vehicle thieves at 78.8%).\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nFor several years I\u2019ve been providing clinical supervision for a woman who\u2019s been treating sex offenders but is still working toward licensure. She\u2019s in her early 30s, living with her fiance, and disarmingly open about her thoughts and feelings. It\u2019s a pleasure for me to offer the space for her to grow and learn about how to do this challenging work. The space between us is warm and honest.\n\nRecently, after we spoke about her patients, there was a pause and she asked, abruptly, \u201cDoes this work ever affect your opinion of men?\u201d\n\nShe went on to talk about a recent group she had led.\n\n\u201cThe men all talked about how at some point in their life they\u2019d had affairs and lied to their partners. I kinda got freaked out and went home and asked my boyfriend if he ever cheated on me. He was like, \u2018What? What are you talking about?\u2019 After I explained what had happened he was understanding about it, but the whole thing made me worried about how I was thinking about men \u2013 like they\u2019re all kinda out of control sexually.\u201d\n\nI took in what she\u2019d said, reflecting on my own experience. For a moment I considered offering her reassurances, but decided to be honest. \u201cThis isn\u2019t an idle worry,\u201d I said, sadly. \u201cMaybe the task isn\u2019t to not be changed; that\u2019s just not possible. Maybe instead it\u2019s to not become jaded. To work to love individual men. And to be able to hold on to compassion for the mistakes of being human.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d she said. \u201cThat makes sense. That\u2019s a goal I can work on.\u201d\n\nThe truth is, even good men in my life whom I love and trust have made mistakes along the way, acted unconsciously sexually, and broken trust. I wanted to offer her something certain to hold on to, but all I could think of was to remind her that most sex offenders are men, but most men are not sex offenders.\n\nIt\u2019s a message I want to be able to communicate to my children, too, but I\u2019m not sure how to do that while also teaching them about safety.\n\nInstead, I use my knowledge of criminality, statistics, and risk to give them practical advice.\n\nPlease stop telling me to leave my comfort zone Read more\n\n\u201cTell me if anyone does something that makes you uncomfortable, or touches you in places that are confusing,\u201d I tell them. \u201cEven if it\u2019s a man you know and like, or trust.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s practical \u2013 if they are molested it will most likely be by someone they know \u2013 but it\u2019s painful. I also use my knowledge to help them safely get help, if they need it. I never tell them: \u201cDon\u2019t talk to strangers.\u201d What if they\u2019re lost and they need help? Instead I tell them: \u201cIf you get lost, look for a mommy first; if no mommy is around, look for a woman.\u201d\n\nMy children are safer that way, statistically speaking. But of course there is a deeper, implied message: men are more likely to be scary and dangerous. Even if you know them.\n\nI worry what that message will mean to them.\n\nI worry what that message means to me, too.\n\nSamantha Smithstein, PsyD, is a licensed Clinical and Forensic Psychologist, writer, and photographer based in San Francisco\n\nThis story was first published in Anxy Magazine: The Masculinity Issue.
