Ted Lieu Ted W. LieuLawmakers, social media users praise photo of Pelosi confronting Trump Democrats eye Pompeo testimony Lieu accuses Trump of asking Ukraine to 'manufacture dirt' on Biden MORE (D-Calif.).\n\n\u201cGiuliani very clearly asked for two things,\u201d Lieu continued. \u201cThat Ukraine investigate the Bidens; and that Ukraine look at this crazy DNC conspiracy theory\u201d \u2014 a reference to the debunked conservative conspiracy that a cyber firm fabricated records to create the false appearance that Russia hacked Democrats in the 2016 election. The U.S. intelligence community has concluded that Moscow was behind the interference.\n\nBut Democrats also questioned Sondland\u2019s motives. Text messages released to Congress earlier in the month revealed that the hotel magnate-turned-diplomat was central to the administration\u2019s pressure campaign on Ukraine, and Democrats suggested that \u201cgaps\u201d in his testimony may have been strategically designed to protect his reputation.\n\nDemocratic Rep.

Sondland, they asserted, had supported the underlying narrative that Trump had sought foreign help to boost his 2020 reelection chances.\n\n\"All of the evidence that we've received is consistent,\" said Rep.

Mark Meadows Mark Randall MeadowsDemocrats eye Pompeo testimony Ex-Ukraine ambassador arrives to give testimony GOP seeks to gain more control of impeachment narrative MORE (R-N.C.).\n\n\u201cThe fact that he was there looking at 2016 election information was certainly what I would think a private attorney would do,\u201d he added. \u201cTo the extent it went beyond that, that's the question that I think a lot of us are trying to grapple with right now.\u201d\n\nAnd Democrats say Giuilani links back to Trump \u2013 the two, they argue, are inextricably tied.\n\n\u201cI think it is important that the American people know Rudy Giuliani is Donald Trump and Donald Trump is Rudy Giuliani. If Rudy Giuliani is doing something, it is because he is the lawyer for Donald Trump. And lawyers don\u2019t take actions that are not authorized by their clients,\u201d said Intelligence Committee member Rep.

I did not know until more recent press reports that Hunter Biden was on the board of Burisma,\u201d Sondland said.\n\n\u201cAgain, I recall no discussions with any State Department or White House official about Former Vice President Biden or his son, nor do I recall taking part in any effort to encourage an investigation into the Bidens,\u201d his opening remarks continue.\n\nDemocrats say they also believe Sondland was trying to offer his version of events, amid growing scrutiny of his involvement in the Ukraine affair, with some suggesting he was downplaying his role.\n\n\u201cA lot of CYA,\u201d said Intelligence member Rep.

Sondland recalled that the phone call was short and Trump was in a bad mood, according to his opening remarks.\n\nBut outside the halls of Congress, versions of events about whether a quid pro quo existed got muddled when acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney John (Mick) Michael MulvaneySondland could provide more clues on Ukraine controversy Tensions flare as Democrats urge consumer bureau to boost penalties White House conducting probe into handling of Ukraine call transcript: report MORE led a White House press briefing Thursday afternoon.\n\nMulvaney first indicated that the Trump administration had stalled nearly $400 million in military assistance to Ukraine in part because the president wanted Zelensky to investigate the unproven conspiracy theory that Ukraine was involved in the 2016 hack of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) server.\n\n\u201cDid [Trump] also mention to me in the past that the corruption related to the DNC server? Absolutely, no question about that. But that was it. That\u2019s why we held up the money,\u201d Mulvaney said at the briefing.\n\n\u201cThe look back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the things that he was worried about in corruption with that nation. And that is absolutely appropriate,\u201d Mulvaney continued.\n\nMulvaney later issued a statement accusing the media of \u201cmisconstruing\u201d his earlier remarks \u201cto advance a biased and political witch hunt against President Trump,\u201d while stating that there \u201cwas absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president never told me to withhold any money until the Ukrainians did anything related to the server,\u201d said Mulvaney, who instead stating the holdup was to review concerns about corruption and review the funding other countries were giving to the cause.\n\nDemocrats, though, saw Mulvaney\u2019s remarks as a kind of smoking gun.\n\n\u201cMick Mulvaney today, on national TV, says, 'Yes, there was a quid pro quo, essentially, on the DNC conspiracy theory investigation,'\u201d said Lieu.\n\n\u201cThat is all very damning for the president of the United States.\"", "description": "House Democrats seized on Thursday\u2019s testimony from a top\u00a0U.S. diplomat as evidence that President Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani acted inappropriately in their contacts with Ukraine.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/sondlandgordon_101719gn6_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
