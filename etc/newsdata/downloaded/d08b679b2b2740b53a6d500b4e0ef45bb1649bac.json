Tony Maycon Munoz-Mendez is in the country unlawfully from Guatemala and is now on the lam.\n\nWashington Post reports that \"Tony Maycon Munoz-Mendez, 31, had been in custody since his 2015 conviction on rape and child molestation charges, according to state records. He was serving a life sentence when he was 'released in error' from Rogers State Prison on Friday, the Georgia Department of Corrections announced.\"\n\nGwinnett County prosecutor John Warr helped convict Munoz-Mendez and was aghast that the county had not told his victims. Warr himself found out from online. The victim had been assaulted on numerous occasions starting at age 10.\n\n\"I contacted the foster mother of the victim, immediately, and informed her what was going on,\" Warr told media. \"He\u2019d already been out of prison the whole weekend,\" he added.\n\n\"They need to rethink how they\u2019re handling their security, and how they let people out by mistake,\" he added. \"It\u2019s incomprehensible.\"\n\nAs pointed out Laura Ingraham, the Washington Post conveniently ignored the fact that Munoz-Mendez is in the country illegally.\n\nOf course WashPost doesn\u2019t mention he\u2019s an illegal alien: \u201cConvicted rapist Tony Maycon Munoz-Mendez accidentally released by Georgia authorities\u201d https://t.co/2OtrJTRKsS \u2014 Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) October 29, 2019\n\nGeorgia records confirm that Munoz-Mendez is a Guatemalan national.\n\nHere's the statement issued by the state of Georgia:", "description": ".10/29/2019 19:54:18PM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/302/773b2098-63ef-4753-abf5-a69ce1c02cb9.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
