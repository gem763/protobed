It is the latest in a stream of upgrades at the business as it looks to grab business from traditional freight transport companies and compete with a growing field of like-minded digital brokerages.\n\nUber Freight also said carriers using its mobile app can now book multiple loads at one time, a service it says will help truckers plan better and reduce the number of miles spent hauling empty trailers. Rival freight-booking startup Convoy rolled out a similar service earlier this year.\n\nThe actions mark the latest steps to extend Uber Technologies\u2019 reach beyond its ride-hailing app.\n\nUber\u2019s overall revenue reached $3.17 billion in the second quarter, but the company still expects to lose $3 billion to $3.2 billion this year.\n\nUber, which logged $11.3 billion in full-year revenue for 2018, doesn\u2019t break out financial results for Uber Freight, which it launched in 2017, but said in its IPO filing that the division had $359 million in gross freight bookings in 2018. The company\u2019s Other Bets segment, which primarily consists of Uber Freight and its mobility business focused on electric bikes and scooters, generated $373 million in revenue in 2018.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nThat is a small sliver of the U.S. domestic freight transportation management business estimated at $86.5 billion, according to research group Armstrong & Associates.\n\nUber Freight \u201cis to a point now where they have hit scale,\u201d said Armstrong & Associates President Evan Armstrong. \u201cReally the next target for them is to get to $1 billion.\u201d\n\nUber said last week it is opening an office in Chicago that will serve as its Freight headquarters and will be the division\u2019s first engineering hub outside of San Francisco. Uber says it plans to invest over $200 million annually in the region and hire 2,000 employees in the next three years.\n\nChicago is a major transit point for North American shipping and home to several big operators. Freight brokers Echo Global Logistics Inc., Hub Group Inc. and United Parcel Service Inc. \u2019s Coyote Logistics brokerage division are based in the region, along with a number of tech-focused logistics ventures.\n\nTo scale up faster, Uber Freight and rival digital freight platforms are also adding services intended to help truckers potentially make more money and boost efficiency for the customers whose freight they are hauling. They include ratings features for cargo pickup and drop-off facilities that help carriers decide which loads they want to accept.\n\nUber Freight is expanding a trucking service known in the industry as \u201cdrop-and-hook\u201d to California after an initial rollout in Texas. With the service, truckers can hitch their vehicles to already-loaded trailers instead of having to wait for goods to be loaded and unloaded. The aim is to speed up cargo transfers for shippers and for drivers. Such services can help smaller truckers gain business that is typically the province of big trucking companies with large fleets of trailers.\n\nWrite to Jennifer Smith at jennifer.smith@wsj.com", "description": "Uber Technologies is digging deeper into the freight business, ramping up hiring at a planned new hub in Chicago and rolling out logistics services even as its core ride-hailing business continues to post steep losses.", "authors": ["Jennifer Smith", "Jennifer.Smith Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107503/social", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
