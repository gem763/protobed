(Pier Paolo Cito/AP)\n\nTheodore McCarrick, one of the U.S. Catholic Church\u2019s most influential clerics until he was accused a year ago of abusing boys and young men, denied in an interview published Tuesday that he abused someone in the confessional \u2014 a charge for which the Vatican defrocked him.\n\nMcCarrick spoke briefly to Ruth Graham of Slate for the piece, which profiles the life of the toppled church leader now that he\u2019s been relegated to living in a friary in the small town of Victoria in western Kansas.\n\nMcCarrick served as archbishop of Washington until 2006, then became a globe-trotting fundraiser and diplomat. He has been almost silent publicly since the Vatican made global, shocking news in June 2018 by announcing he\u2019d been suspended for a credible charge of fondling an altar boy decades ago. McCarrick that summer issued a simple denial but said he accepted the punishment \u2014 which became final in February this year when he was defrocked, the first cardinal laicized for alleged sexual misconduct.\n\nIn addition to the altar boy, he was accused of sexual abuse by family friend James Grein, who alleged that McCarrick began molesting him when Grein was 11, and that sexual contact continued into Grein\u2019s adulthood. Several seminarians and young priests also accused McCarrick of inappropriate touching.\n\nMcCarrick unexpectedly came to the friary door to speak to Graham, Slate reported, invited her into a small room and denied several of the allegations made against him.\n\n[Is McCarrick's defrocking justice?]\n\n\u201cThere was only one accusation he wanted to discuss specifically: James Grein\u2019s allegation that McCarrick had groped him while hearing Grein\u2019s confession,\u201d Slate wrote. \u201c \u2018The thing about the confession, it\u2019s a horrible thing,\u2019 \u201d he said, sounding suddenly more urgent. \u2018I was a priest for 60 years, and I would never have done anything like that. \u2026 That was horrible, to take the holy sacrament and to make it a sinful thing.' \u201d\n\nGrein\u2019s lawyer, Mitchell Garabedian, alleged in Slate that McCarrick\u2019s denial about the confessional \u201crings hollow given that McCarrick has shown himself to be a child molester without a conscience.\u201d\n\nThe same August day Slate interviewed McCarrick, Grein announced he is suing the archdiocese of New York under a new state law that expands the ability of child sex abuse victims to file lawsuits.\n\nMcCarrick also issued a general denial when Slate asked about the cluster of allegations against him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not as bad as they paint me,\u201d he said. \u201cI do not believe that I did the things that they accused me of,\u201d he said. The reporter asked how it could be that multiple seminarians described similar stories, about harassing and groping, while at McCarrick\u2019s beach home.\n\n\u201cI think that they were encouraged to do that,\u201d McCarrick told Slate, noting that many other seminarians and clerics visited the home and \u201cnever had any problems like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs for who would have orchestrated such a campaign,\u201d Slate said, McCarrick \u201cdeclined to name names, but referred vaguely to \u2018enemies.\u2019 \u201d\n\n[As rumors of sexual misdeeds swirled, Cardinal McCarrick became a powerful fundraiser for the Vatican]\n\nMcCarrick told Graham that he never leaves the friary, not even to enter the basilica next door. He participates in the daily routine, she wrote: \u201cMass at 7 a.m., a communal breakfast, evening prayers. He spends much of his time in the chapel, he said, and in the library.\u201d He goes to confession once a week.\n\nHe told Graham he knows his 60 years as a priest will be remembered not primarily for his work as a shepherd. He happened to be holding mail when she arrived, and he showed her a fundraising appeal he\u2019d received from a Catholic charity.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of the mail I get is looking for some help,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have a lot of money, but I try to be helpful. It\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to do.\u201d", "description": "The former Catholic leader told Slate that he never leaves the Kansas friary to which he was banished after being defrocked.", "authors": ["Michelle Boorstein", "Religion Reporter", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/rTaTuwbTp-G0lPPsQ-seQuLCKdc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TNN74NRWXQI6TA3V4POPNNUFLA.jpg"}
