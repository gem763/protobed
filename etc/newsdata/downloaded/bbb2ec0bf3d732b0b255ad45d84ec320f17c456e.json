Close to 40% have less than $10,000 socked away for retirement, and more than a fifth have less than $5,000, according to a study from Northwestern Mutual.\n\nNearly half haven\u2019t even started planning for their golden years.\n\nAt any age, opening a Roth IRA makes great financial sense.\n\nHow a Roth IRA works\n\nRoth IRAs are investment accounts designed to pay off big in retirement. The \"IRA\" part stands for \"individual retirement account\" or \"individual retirement arrangement.\"\n\nUnlike other retirement savings plans, Roth accounts are funded with money that's taxed upfront. That means any withdrawals you make against your contributed amounts now or in retirement are tax-free.\n\nYou can face taxes and penalties if you withdraw your earnings too soon, and the accounts have certain rules and limitations. But in general, Roth IRAs are popular for their advantages and flexibility.\n\nContributions go toward investments of your choice, such as stocks, bonds, ETFs or mutual funds. Stocks and bonds typically have the highest returns.\n\nHow a Roth IRA grows your money\n\nEven if you\u2019re not able to contribute during a few lean years, your money in a Roth IRA will continue to grow through the wonder of compound interest. Simply put, your investments earn returns \u2014 and so do the earnings themselves.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of the beauty of compounding on a Roth IRA:\n\nA bright 20-year-old saves $5,000 a year in a Roth IRA for 10 years. She never makes another contribution.\n\nEarning, say, 8% returns, she would still wind up with more than $180,000 at age 65. Being a sharp cookie, she probably has much more than that, because she continued saving and investing in other ways.\n\nRoth IRA accounts just keep on growing, and the withdrawals can be totally tax-free \u2014 provided she doesn't take the money out too early.\n\nThe benefits of a Roth IRA\n\nThe biggest benefit is the tax incentive, especially for younger people who open Roth IRAs while they\u2019re still in the lowest tax bracket.\n\nPresumably, their income will increase as they grow older, meaning their contributions will then be taxed at higher rates.\n\nHere are some additional advantages:\n\nYou can open a Roth IRA at any age, and there are no limits on how long you can contribute.\n\nUnlike a traditional IRA, a Roth doesn\u2019t have mandatory withdrawals. You can leave the money untouched for as long as you like. For instance, well-to-do older taxpayers who don\u2019t need the money can let their Roth IRAs sit and continue to grow. If the assets are correctly passed down to heirs, the heirs won\u2019t owe taxes on them.\n\nYou can withdraw from the amount you contributed at any time and for any reason without penalty. The rules for withdrawing from investment earnings are outlined further down.\n\nRoth IRA limits\n\nThese are wonderful accounts, but you have to play by the Roth IRA rules. Also, make sure to base your moves on current information. Roth IRA contribution limits and income limits are sometimes adjusted.\n\nThe 2019 Roth contribution limits according to filing status and adjusted gross income are as follows:\n\nMarried filing jointly or qualifying widow or widower:\n\nIf you earn less than $193,000, the maximum annual contribution is $6,000, or $7,000 if you\u2019re at least 50. If you earn between $193,000 and $202,999, the contribution is reduced. You're not eligible for a Roth IRA if you earn $203,000 or more.\n\nSingle, head of household or married filing separately (if you didn\u2019t live with your spouse during the year):\n\nIf you earn less than $122,000, the maximum contribution is $6,000, or $7,000 if you\u2019re at least 50. If you earn between $122,000 and $136,999, the contribution is reduced. You're not eligible for a Roth IRA if you earn $137,000 or more.\n\nMarried filing separately (if you lived with your spouse at any time during the year):\n\nIf you earn less than $10,000, the contribution is reduced. You're not eligible for a Roth IRA if you earn $10,000 or more.\n\nA Roth IRA vs. a traditional IRA\n\nThere are both similarities and differences between the two primary types of IRAs. Here\u2019s how they compare:\n\nAge requirements Roth IRA: Can contribute at any age. Traditional IRA: Can contribute until you're 70\u00bd.\n\nIncome requirements Roth IRA: Your income affects the amount you can contribute. Traditional IRA: There are no income limits.\n\nTax incentives Roth IRA: Growth and qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Traditional IRA: Contributions are tax-deductible, and growth is tax-deferred.\n\nWithdrawal taxes Roth IRA: Earnings are tax-free if withdrawn at age 59\u00bd or later. And, the account must be at least 5 years old. Traditional IRA: Both contributions and earnings are taxed when they\u2019re withdrawn.\n\nEarly withdrawal penalties Roth IRA: Earnings are subject to a 10% penalty if withdrawn before age 59\u00bd. Traditional IRA: All withdrawals are subject to a 10% penalty before age 59\u00bd.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Here's everything you need to know about this important retirement savings tool.", "authors": ["Neve Gotshalk"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/29wAZmehBVteC7.W0eb5ZQ--~B/aD00MDA7dz03Mjg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/moneywise_327/7c6820b675ab099c908ddbc63321fa47", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
