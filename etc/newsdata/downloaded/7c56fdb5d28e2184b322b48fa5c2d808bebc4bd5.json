Three men accused of planting and triggering the explosive are awaiting trial. They were arrested weeks after the incident, but it is suspected the killing was ordered by individuals who are still at large.\n\nPlay Video 5:01 How was Daphne Caruana Galizia murdered? \u2013 video\n\nAmong the failings identified by Omtzigt is the failure so far to agree a plea deal with one of the alleged hitmen, Vincent Muscat, who has spoken to police about a supposed intermediary.\n\n\u201cI am concerned that the authorities may have turned down evidence that could lead to whoever ordered the murder,\u201d Omtzigt said. \u201cAnd I am also worried that neither Mr Muscat, nor his lawyer, nor others who may be concerned by this situation \u2013 including the alleged intermediary \u2013 have been provided with adequate protection.\u201d\n\nOver the weekend, the Times of Malta reported anonymous claims that Muscat was in discussions with the attorney general for a reduced sentence in exchange for his testimony. However, Muscat\u2019s lawyers are said to be concerned he could be harmed in a revenge attack while in prison.\n\nHe is being held alongside his alleged accomplices at the Corradino correctional facility, and is reported to be in fear for his life and reluctant to eat prison food.\n\nOmtzigt raised further concerns, including the delayed removal of a senior officer from the case despite a conflict of interest; the refusal of a copy of Caruana Galizia\u2019s laptop from German police, who had obtained the data; a complaint by the former head of Europol about unsatisfactory cooperation from the Maltese police; and anonymous briefings to journalists about imminent breakthroughs that turned out to be false.\n\nMeanwhile, the rapporteur\u2019s efforts to monitor the case have led to verbal attacks from Malta\u2019s prime minister and fears for his own safety.\n\nOn the advice of the Netherlands\u2019 secret service, Omtzigt was accompanied by armed plain clothes officers, assigned by the Maltese authorities, when he visited the country.\n\nA veteran investigator, he has produced reports on corruption and bribery by the Azerbaijan government and on mass surveillance by the US and other countries, but this is the first time he has required police protection.\n\nMalta attempted in September 2018 to have Omtzigt removed as rapporteur, but this was rejected. Malta raised concerns about the politician\u2019s handling of an investigation into the shooting down of Malaysian airlines flight MH17 over Ukraine in 2014.\n\nMalta\u2019s prime minister, Joseph Muscat, has used press conferences to question Omtzigt\u2019s credibility. He described the rapporteur as having \u201cserious credibility deficits\u201d and of having told \u201clies\u201d in relation to a previous investigation. Omtzigt rejects those claims.\n\nSenior members of Muscat\u2019s investigation have refused meetings requested by Omtzigt.\n\n\u201cEvery time I ask sharp, factual questions about the case or request meetings, they refuse any answer and come up with all kinds of stories,\u201d Omtzigt told the Guardian.\n\nA bomb silenced Daphne Caruana Galizia. But her investigation lives on Read more\n\nCaruana Galizia\u2019s murder sent shockwaves across Europe and focused a spotlight on allegations by politicians in the European parliament that the rule of law has deteriorated sharply in the small Mediterranean country.\n\nThe journalist\u2019s most significant investigations stemmed from the Panama Papers, a leak of documents from the archives of the offshore law firm Mossack Fonseca.\n\nOmtzigt said he was also concerned about the absence of any request to the Latvian authorities to produce bank account information which could relate to the case. Among Caruana Galizia\u2019s most important investigations was the revelation that two members of Malta\u2019s current Labour government had acquired secretive Panama registered companies soon after taking office. Material leaked from the Panama Papers suggests those companies were due to receive payments from another entity, called 17 Black, with an account at Latvia\u2019s now defunct ABLV bank.\n\n\u201cEven in Mongolia, people who were exposed in the Panama Papers had to resign,\u201d said Omtzigt. \u201cEverywhere, people resigned. Except Malta. Malta is the only exception we can find.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister\u2019s office and Malta police did not respond to requests for comment.", "description": "European rapporteur raises concerns about alleged failings in Daphne Caruana Galizia case", "authors": ["Juliette Garside"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51ae0c3258c0bc913271b45de15e19740ea67946/0_43_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=44dcaa52057f2b249091790757c65298", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
