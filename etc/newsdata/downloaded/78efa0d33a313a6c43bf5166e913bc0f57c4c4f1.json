Facebook and Instagram taking a stand to protect the physical and mental health of people online, sends an important message out to the world,\" she said. \"I\u2019m thrilled to have been able to work towards this with them, alongside a host of other experts who shed light on the danger of these products.\"\n\nJamil, who is also the founder of the \"I Weigh\" advocacy group, said she had protested and petitioned Instagram in the past and lauded the platform for moving \"so efficiently\" to enact change.\n\n\"As someone who struggled with an eating disorder for most of my youth, I\u2019ve personally known and suffered the perils of the devious side of the diet/detox industry,\" she added, calling the policy changes a \"day of hope for our generation, who deserve respect and protection from the celebrities and influencers that they follow.\"", "description": "The days of influencers pushing problematic detox or diet products may be over.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Business/instagram-gty-jpo-190501_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
