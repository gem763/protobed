If Syria\u2019s new legitimate government chooses to say that they have no more need for Russia\u2019s military presence, this will be just as true for Russia.\n\nMeanwhile, Moscow\u2019s stance on the settlement in Syria remains unchanged and was already relayed to its partners Iran, Turkey and the US, the president noted. \u201cSyria must be free from other states\u2019 military presence.
