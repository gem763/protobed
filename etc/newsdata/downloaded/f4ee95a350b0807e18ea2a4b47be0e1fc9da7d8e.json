HKEX had said the LSE would have to ditch the Refinitiv purchase for its offer to go ahead.\n\nWhen HKEX announced its surprise move, analysts also said the perception that Beijing was exerting growing influence over Hong Kong could become another key sticking point for an LSE takeover, given the Hong Kong government's close links with the HKEX at a time of major unrest in the city over its ties with mainland China.\n\nThe LSE was not immediately available to comment on HKEX's announcement on Tuesday.", "description": "Hong Kong bourse drops $39 billion bid to buy London Stock Exchange", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9702V_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
