Graham said our Kurdish allies had been \u201cshamelessly abandoned by the Trump Administration.\u201d Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the third-ranking Republican in the House, said Trump\u2019s decision is having \u201csickening and predictable\u201d consequences. Representative Adam Kinzinger, an Air Force veteran, said on Face the Nation that \u201cleaving an ally behind ... is disheartening, depressing.\u201d He added, \u201cThe Kurds found out on Twitter, for goodness\u2019 sake. We have left them to the wolves. And the message this is sending to our allies around the world, I think, is really going to be bad.\u201d Senator Mitt Romney, the Republican lawmaker who has been the most willing to speak the truth about Trump, declared on Twitter, \u201cThe President\u2019s decision to abandon our Kurd allies in the face of an assault by Turkey is a betrayal.\u201d\n\nIndeed it is. But betrayal is hardly new to Trump, who routinely abandons people who trust in him or the nation he leads. By now, this behavior should come as a surprise to exactly no one.\n\nBetrayal is a leitmotif for this president\u2019s entire life. Think of how he cheated on his wives. Think of the infant child of a nephew who had critical medical benefits withdrawn by Trump because of Trump\u2019s retaliation against his nephew over an inheritance dispute. Think of those who enrolled at Trump University and were defrauded. Think about the contractors whom Trump has stiffed. Think of Jeff Sessions, the first prominent Republican to endorse Trump, whom Trump viciously turned against because Sessions properly recused himself from overseeing the investigation into whether Russia intervened in the 2016 election. Think about those who served in Trump\u2019s administration\u2014Rex Tillerson, John Bolton, Don McGahn, Reince Priebus, Gary Cohn, James Mattis, and many more\u2014who were unceremoniously dumped and in some cases mocked on their way out the door.\n\nAlso think of how Trump has disparaged his own country while making excuses for strongmen. When MSNBC\u2019s Joe Scarborough said Vladimir Putin \u201ckills journalists, political opponents and invades countries,\u201d Trump replied that \u201cat least he\u2019s a leader.\u201d Besides, Trump asserted, \u201cI think our country does plenty of killing also.\u201d And when asked if Erdo\u011fan was exploiting the coup attempt to purge his political enemies, Trump did not call for the Turkish leader to observe the rule of law, or Western standards of justice. \u201cWhen the world sees how bad the United States is and we start talking about civil liberties, I don\u2019t think we are a very good messenger,\u201d he said.\n\nAs McKay Coppins put it in The Atlantic shortly after the president was sworn in, \u201cTrump built his success on his willingness to toss aside mentors, friends, and family members during moments of frustration and chaos.\u201d Serial betrayal is a central trait of Trump\u2019s character, and his critics warned from the start against elevating such a person to the nation\u2019s highest position of public trust. When the consequences are the serial humiliation of Cabinet secretaries and White House aides, they are easier for Trump\u2019s political supporters to rationalize or overlook. But as the professor Robert King once declared, \u201cbetrayal is a garment without seams.\u201d The danger is far plainer when the victims of Trump\u2019s betrayal are longtime American allies facing deadly force.", "description": "Humiliating his own Cabinet secretaries was bad.
