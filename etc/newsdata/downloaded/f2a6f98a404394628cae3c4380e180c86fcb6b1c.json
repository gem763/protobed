I wanted food that could be enjoyed. I wanted great tasting, juicy plant-based burgers that tasted like the real thing,' Mr Van der Molen said.\n\nHe expected the company to be profitable within its first year of trading due to the quality of product.\n\n'We put that down to quality of product, branding and real passion in what we do and what we believe in and unwavering strength and tenacity,' he said.\n\nWoolworths approached Moving Mountains about stocking the products and has already sent three shipments of the burgers and hotdogs.\n\n'Woolworths is on a mission to increase their range of plant-based meats and I'm actually delighted to work with them,' Mr Van der Molen said.\n\nThe UK-based company was founded in 2016 by Simeon Van der Molen (pictured with the product)\n\nThe plant-based alternatives compete with animal meat for both taste and texture, using beetroot juice as a 'bleeding' effect.\n\nIn just two years the business has quickly grown into a $180 million empire in Europe, and expanded to the United States.\n\nMr Van der Molen challenges skeptics to try the hot dogs as he believes they are eerily similar to the real thing thanks to sunflower seeds.\n\nThe ingredient was an 'absolute revelation' which helped the company replicate the real thing and stand out to competitors.\n\n'We tried with different proteins like soy, wheat and none of them were really working really well until we stumbled across sunflower seeds,' Mr Van der Molen told news.com.au.\n\n'No one else has anything like this in the world.'", "description": "Moving Mountains will now be sold exclusively though Woolworths stores around Australia and will also be a feature at Henry's Burgers in Melbourne.", "authors": ["Lauren Ferri For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/05/20312642-0-image-a-32_1572327614296.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
