The attacks, however, originated from Iranian territory in the northern Persian Gulf, people familiar with the investigation into the strikes said\u2026\n\nU.S. and Saudi officials didn\u2019t anticipate a strike from inside Iran, officials said, rather than through one of its proxy forces or elite military units.\n\nSaudi air defenses also were monitoring maritime traffic in the Strait of Hormuz, where U.S. officials charge Iran has seized passing oil tankers and flown drones near American war ships.", "description": "", "authors": ["Wsj.Com Articles"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
