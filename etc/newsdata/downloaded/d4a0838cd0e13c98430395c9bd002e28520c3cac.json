And that, \u201cbeing a designer at such a young age, despite the fact fashion gave me my dream, there is a price to pay. You trust less people. And for me, because of being left by what should have been my first love, my mother, that was also hard.\u201d\n\nThe film does not have a neat, happy ending, laced-up corset-tight and dripping in diamant\u00e9. Though the social worker was able to pass Mr. Rousteing\u2019s file to another office, which searched for and found his birth mother \u2014 and learned that she was still in France \u2014 it could not legally reveal her name. Instead, he was offered the chance to write a letter that the social workers would deliver to her, giving her the opportunity to decide if she wanted to meet him and reveal herself. Mr. Rousteing, still unsure whether his fear of another rejection outweighs his need to understand that rejection in the first place, has not decided what he will do.\n\nIn the meantime, he had been forced to revise his own origin story, and assumptions about himself.\n\n\u2018You Can Have the Dream\u2019\n\nMr. Rousteing had always, he said, hoped his birth parents were \u201ctwo young people who were very in love with each other but couldn\u2019t stay together.\u201d He had always assumed he was of mixed race, because of his skin color. Both ideas were wrong. \u201cShe was Somalian and he was Ethiopian, which means I am African-African,\u201d Mr. Rousteing said. \u201cI\u2019m black.\u201d It\u2019s discombobulating discovering, in your 30s, that the myths you told yourself your entire life, even if you knew you had made them up, were all wrong.\n\nBut, \u201cI don\u2019t want anyone to have pity for me,\u201d Mr. Rousteing said. \u201cI want people to see this as a movie about a fighter who faced the world. There is a real crisis of identity today, it\u2019s hard to be yourself. But maybe the people who see it will understand me more.\u201d", "description": "In a surprising new documentary, the Balmain designer leaves the Instagram filters behind and goes searching for his origins.", "authors": ["Vanessa Friedman"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/26/fashion/24IDENTITY-olivier-2/24INDENITy-olivier-2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
