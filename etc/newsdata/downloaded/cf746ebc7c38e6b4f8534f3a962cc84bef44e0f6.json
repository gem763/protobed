One exception is Target Corp. (TGT) which is in a strong uptrend. Looking over the charts and indicators it looks like TGT can continue to set new highs.\n\nIn this updated daily bar chart of TGT, below, we can see a strong rally from late December. Upside price gaps in May and August underline the strength behind the move. Prices are above the rising 50-day and 200-day moving average lines.\n\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has moved higher the past 11 months to confirm the price gains and remind us that buyers of TGT have been more aggressive.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is above the zero line and turning up for a fresh outright go long signal.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of TGT, below, we can see that prices have more than doubled in the past year.\n\nTGT is above the rising 40-week moving average line.\n\nThe weekly OBV line has been in a strong multi-year rise and the MACD oscillator is bullish too.\n\nIn this first Point and Figure chart of TGT using daily data, below, we see an upside price target of $127 and we can also see that a trade at $103.41 will start to weaken the chart a bit.\n\nIn this second Point and Figure chart of TGT, below, we used weekly data to see if we could come up with a more bullish target. Here an objective of $173 is shown.\n\nBottom line strategy: If you are long TGT from lower levels you are sitting pretty. I would probably use a trading stop below $103.41 and an investing stop below $99. If you want to start or add to a long position I would try to go long closer to $110. $127 is our first Point and Figure price target.", "description": "Let's review the charts for some parameters....AMZN", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Target Is Setting Its Sights On Higher Price Objectives On The Charts", "Let'S Review The Charts For Some Parameters.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Eric Jhonsa", "Mark Sebastian", "Carolyn Boroden", "Bob Lang", "Helene Meisler", "Doug Kass"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/dd191440-6372-11e8-9389-9fc3d91e6132.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
