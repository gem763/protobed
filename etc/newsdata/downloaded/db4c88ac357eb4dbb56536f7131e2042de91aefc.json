However, he will have an option to buy 10m shares at a fixed price of \u20ac11.12 a share, should the airline either record \u20ac2bn profit in any one year by 2024, or should the share price rise above \u20ac21. In the latter scenario, the profit on O\u2019Leary\u2019s share options would be worth at least \u20ac99m.\n\nBoth targets are stretching but the airline\u2019s recent performance has indicated they could be attainable. The carrier\u2019s share price is just under \u20ac10 but was as high as \u20ac18.60 in 2017, while Ryanair made profits of \u20ac1.45bn in 2018.\n\nThe size of the potential award \u201craises a red flag in terms of quantum and for our members\u201d, said Jocelyn Brown of the UK railways pension scheme, which voted against the deal.\n\nSpeaking after the meeting, O\u2019Leary said the pay deal was a \u201cfree bet\u201d for investors because he would need to double the share price in order to secure the bonus. \u201cI think most shareholders would take the view that if he doubles the share price, we don\u2019t care what you pay him for the next five years,\u201d he said.\n\nO\u2019Leary was paid a total package of \u20ac3.4m last year, including bonus and share awards. His stake in Ryanair, with 3.9% of the total stock, is worth around \u20ac400m.\n\nUnder a new company structure, O\u2019Leary is the group chief executive of Ryanair Holdings, above four airline chief executives running the main Dublin-based European carrier, Ryanair UK, which has been hived off before Brexit, and two other subsidiaries, Laudamotion and Ryanair Sun.\n\nAbout 30% of shareholders also voted against the re-election of Howard Millar \u2013 the chair of the remuneration committee \u2013 and Ryanair\u2019s chairman, David Bonderman, who has already announced his intention to step down.\n\nRyanair has struggled with industrial relations in recent months and its growth plans have been curbed by the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max, delaying the first deliveries this summer of an order for 135 of the planes. As a consequence of the 737 delays, Ryanair has moved to curb expansion plans and is cutting up to 700 pilots. O\u2019Leary said Ryanair will continue to challenge unions, whose strikes he described as complete failures.\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\nPilots in the UK started a further seven days of strikes on Wednesday. Ryanair said that 96% of its flights departed on time, with any delays due to air traffic issues. The strikes had not caused cancellations, the airline said. It is bringing in contractors and flying in pilots from other European countries in an effort to maintain its services.\n\nThe Balpa union said on Thursday that Ryanair told pilots benefits would be removed should they take part in the strike, in a standoff that shows little sign of abating. Ryanair said it remained open to meeting but Balpa said Ryanair had refused to go to the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (Acas) for talks.\n\nBalpa\u2019s general secretary, Brian Strutton, said: \u201cInstead of seeking to resolve the current impasse via negotiation, Ryanair seems hellbent on prolonging the dispute by threatening pilots with the removal of staff travel benefits and inflated and draconian deductions from salary.\u201d", "description": "Michael O\u2019Leary may benefit from fixed-price shares after 50.5% remuneration approval", "authors": ["Gwyn Topham", "Nils Pratley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78c6aec5c2a046a3959230e4c905eedd7bfb9726/0_101_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0ed4ca1898107965fee8a19b5cb54357", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
