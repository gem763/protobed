REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Florida has signed on to a consent agreement that the Justice Department reached with Sprint Corp and T-Mobile US Inc to allow the companies to merge, according to a court filing on Wednesday.\n\nWhile Florida\u2019s decision to join the government is a morale boost for the companies, it may have little practical effect since the two sides already settled.\n\nA group of 17 states and the District of Columbia has filed a separate lawsuit to stop the $26 billion merger, arguing that it will lead to higher prices for consumers. A trial date has been set for Dec. 9.\n\nFlorida on Wednesday joined Kansas, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma and South Dakota in backing the federal government\u2019s decision to approve the deal on condition that the companies, the third- and fourth-largest U.S. wireless companies, divest Sprint\u2019s prepaid businesses to satellite television company Dish Network Corp to create a fourth U.S. wireless carrier.\n\nSeparately, the Federal Communications Commission has indicated it plans to approve the merger and has begun the process of formally doing so.", "description": "Florida has signed on to a consent agreement that the Justice Department reached with Sprint Corp and T-Mobile US Inc to allow the companies to merge, according to a court filing on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436359360&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF911LL-OCATC"}
