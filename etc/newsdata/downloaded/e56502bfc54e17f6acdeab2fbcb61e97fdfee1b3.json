This looks like the most fun, and not a long-starved terrified teenager in sight. Beautiful,\u201d Jamil captioned the video.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe Good Place star\u2019s post caught the attention of Victoria\u2019s Secret model Sara Sampaio, who accused the activist of \u201cbringing other people down\u201d with her campaign for body positivity.\n\n\u201cCalling runway models \u2018long-starved terrified teenager\u2019 is extremely offensive [sic],\u201d Sampaio wrote on Twitter.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

But I will say there is a vast majority issue with young girls starving themselves, and using drugs and cocaine to control their weight, to meet the very small sample sizes. If you don\u2019t see that, then you are in a bubble,\u201d Jamil said.\n\nThe actor added that she doesn\u2019t \u201cpreach\u201d body positivity and instead aims to combat eating disorder culture, which she believes is \u201cperpetuated by the extreme thinness demanded of girls by the high fashion powers that be\u201d.\n\nSampaio defended her comments by stating that Jamil shouldn't have felt the need to \u201cattack girls\u201d in order to make her point.\n\n\u201cEating disorders, drugs and cocaine use aren\u2019t an exclusive problem of models, it\u2019s a huge problem is society as a whole,\u201d Sampaio added.\n\n\u201cSure that happens but it\u2019s for sure not a vast majority. The point of my tweet though, wasn\u2019t that one! And you know!\u201d\n\nThe pair continued to quarrel online before Sampaio stopped replying to Jamil\u2019s tweets.\n\nIn her final post, Jamil referred to herself an activist, adding that her words aren\u2019t meant to be \u201ccute, or easy, or inoffensive\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m energised by the HUNDREDS of emails and messages a day I get from people about their damaged mental health and body image issues,\u201d Jamil concluded.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going away until the problem goes away. (PS if anyone finds me annoying, they should help me end this problem and I will chill out!)\u201d\n\nDespite the argument seemingly coming to an end, Jamil reignited the debate with a final message in which she said Sampaio was \u201cwrong\u201d for calling her out.\n\n\u201cHer defensiveness over working in a toxic industry that she doesn\u2019t fight hard enough against, when it comes to poor treatment of young girls, made her think I was calling out starving, scared teenagers,\u201d Jamil wrote.\n\n\u201cI was calling out the shows and the industry. Not the kids.\u201d\n\nThe former radio presenter received a wave of support from her loyal followers who praised her as a \u201clegend\u201d and \u201ccourageous\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou called out an industry that targets young teenagers, starves them, destroys their self-esteem and encourages disordered eating to anyone who sees or watches that go on,\u201d one person wrote.\n\n\u201cSara decided to be offended at nothing. You were calling out facts! You\u2019re a legend.\u201d\n\nAnother person added: \u201cJameela thank you for your voice and for being you. I look up to you so much.\u201d\n\nHowever, not everyone agreed with Jamil\u2019s comments, with several Twitter users calling her a \u201chypocrite\u201d.\n\n\u201c100 per cent team @SaraSampaio here,\u201d one person commented.\n\n\u201cJameela you are an awful hypocrite \u2013 you totally miss Sara's point. Why did you have to praise the photo you liked and at the same time body shame slender models? If someone had liked slender models and said \u2018not a fatty in sight\u2019 \u2013 you'd go mad!\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Jamil has spoken publicly about her attitude towards body positivity.\n\nThe activist has previously called out the Kardashian family for promoting detox teas and labelled airbrushing in magazines a \u201ccrime against women\u201d.", "description": "Jameela Jamil has been criticised\u00a0for referring to fashion models as \u201clong-starved\u201d and \u201cterrified\u201d.
