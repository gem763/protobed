And that terrifies me,\u201d she continued.\n\nPhoenix and director Todd Phillips have pushed back on this line of thought in promotional appearances for the film.\n\n\u201cPeople misinterpret lyrics from songs. They misinterpret passages from books. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the responsibility of a filmmaker to teach the audience morality or the difference between right or wrong,\u201d Phoenix said.\n\nPhillips agreed: \u201cTo me, art can be complicated and oftentimes art is meant to be complicated. If you want uncomplicated art, you might want to take up calligraphy, but filmmaking will always be a complicated art.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that survivor Pierce O\u2019Farrill, who\u2019s suffered from PTSD since the shooting, says he wants to see the movie (though likely not in a theater), and Tom Sullivan, who lost his son in the shooting, doesn\u2019t believe the film with \u201cjumpstart somebody\u201d to become violent.\n\nAn unimpeachably good idea is that the Aurora Cinemark, where the shooting took place, will not screen Joker.\n\nThe film will debut in theaters elsewhere on October 4.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe post Uncomfortable Tone of \u2018Joker\u2019 Movie Has Families of Aurora Shooting Victims Angry appeared first on Fatherly.", "description": "And they're calling on Warner Bros. to do something about it.", "authors": ["Cameron Leblanc"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3Na_oXqjpt6X.ONbCK2hGA--~B/aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/fatherly_721/8b94036b709e1d51b6a85fd7d325a3e2", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
