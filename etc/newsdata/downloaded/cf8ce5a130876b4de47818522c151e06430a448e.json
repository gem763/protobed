Great trick though. And is it broken?\u2019, to which Wendy revealed that Grace hadn\u2019t fractured anything.\n\nOther mums and dads felt it was a handy trick but some warned that it could do more harm than good.\n\nAn Australian woman who studied at St Mary\u2019s Hospital Medical School at Imperial College London said she had plenty of experience in A&E and advised against the sweet trick.\n\nLey Anne wrote: \u2018I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to work in A&E for most of my working life. Never, in my entire career if a parent brought a child to me concerned about a facial fracture would I use a Haribo to make a diagnosis.\n\n\u2018Not at home, not in the playground, not with my own kids.\n\n\u2018If a child genuinely had a facial fracture, I would rather they didn\u2019t eat until they were assessed by a specialist. I would never, ever think you are wasting my time.\n\n\u2018Please let us support you being the parent, let us make the call and save the Haribos for after\u2019.\n\nWendy said a nurse told her about the trick (Picture: Facebook/ Wendy Wood)\n\nOne parent also added that she had once broken her lower jaw but didn\u2019t know because her arm hurt more than her face.\n\nHad she chewed a sweet, it could have pushed her jaw out of alignment and she may have needed an operation, she argued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn any case, always check with a medical professional before attempting to help someone or yourself.\n\nMORE: Mum shares genius trick to get a moment of peace and quiet from the kids\n\nMORE: Mum uses shaving cream to stop toilet stinking of pee after sons use it\n\nMORE: Shopper shares simple trick to use when you don\u2019t have a \u00a31 coin for your trolley\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "However, Ley Ann who studied at St Mary's Hospital Medical School wrote she has plenty of experience in A&E and advises against it.", "authors": ["Faima Bakar"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_884668931_1570359447.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
