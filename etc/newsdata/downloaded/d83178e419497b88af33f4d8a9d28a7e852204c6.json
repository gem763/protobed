She declined.\n\nNow, Folau's new legal team has essentially asked the court to retrospectively invalidate the tribunal's decision, because of Eastman's long and public support for progressive causes.\n\n\"The decision of Ms Eastman SC and the other members of the Tribunal was, in all of the circumstances, manifestly excessive, severe and unreasonable,\" the team told the court last week in a filing.\n\n\"The decision of the Tribunal was affected by apprehended bias by reason of the membership of Ms Eastman SC.\"\n\nIn a symmetry that mirrors the cultural context of the case, Folau's legal team is led by a man who represents the conservative approach against which Eastman stands: Melbourne industrial relations barrister Stuart Wood.\n\nBarrister Stuart Wood, in brown coat, and solicitor George Haros, on his left, arrive at court for a hearing in the Israel Folau case in August. AAP\n\nThe Queens Counsel and prominent member of the Victorian Liberal Party is so conservative that he is the honorary secretary of the Samuel Griffith Society, a group of lawyers dedicated to upholding the original intentions of the constitution and opposing what they consider activist judges.\n\nThe group's last collection of speeches included monarchist David Flint on \"An Australian Republic? More than a Waste of Time and Money\".\n\nEastman, who was named Change Champion of the Year by the Women Lawyers Association of NSW this year, is a co-founder of Australian Lawyers for Human Rights, which is a proponent of the United Nations and often critical of Coalition immigration, welfare and social policy.\n\nA current headline on the group's website says: \"Improvements to transgender and gender-diverse rights in Victoria an integral human rights reform.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEastman declines to comment on the attack on her independence. As Folau's lead barrister, court convention bars Wood from public comment.\n\n\"As for the Tribunal proceedings, they were conducted in camera and were confidential,\" Eastman says in an email. \"I am bound by the confidentiality of the process.\"\n\nThe University of NSW graduate is a leader of the progressive movement in the law. She chaired the Law Council of Australia\u2019s equal opportunity committee, the NSW Bar Association\u2019s diversity and equality committee and the Australian Bar Association\u2019s diversity and inclusion committee. She was a member of the Law Council of Australia national human rights committee.\n\nFolau's lawyers say all four organisations support gay rights. Therefore, there is a perception that Eastman could be biased against Folau, whose Christian beliefs regard homosexuality as sinful.\n\nGiven that it is a tenet of the law that any judge put aside personal views in the interests of objectivity and justice, the insistence of perceived bias by Eastman's fellow employment lawyers is a sign of the tough tactics being deployed \u2013 and the high stakes.\n\nEastman's social media presence \u2013 the epitome of a left-wing lawyer \u2013 may also be used as a weapon against her.\n\nOn her LinkedIn page, Eastman lists six personal \"influencers\", led by Qantas Group CEO Alan Joyce, a leader of the marriage equality movement, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, American psychologist Adam Grant, former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan, media entrepreneur Arianna Huffington and former New Zealand prime minister Helen Clark.\n\nEastman ranks Qantas CEO Alan Joyce as her top \"influencer\" on LinkedIn. Alex Ellinghausen\n\nEastman's Twitter account was recently shut down, which she says is unrelated to the Folau case. Historical records of her tweets include complaints about men who don't take gender diversity seriously and a federal minister who said a Tasmanian priest was legally threatened for stating the Catholic Church's position on marriage.\n\n\"As a practitioner in discrimination law for over 30 years \u2013 acting for individuals, companies, government, churches in a wide range of matters \u2013 this is not true,\" she tweeted after Resources Minister Matt Canavan appeared on Insiders in 2018.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Anti-discrimination laws do not have a 'chilling' effect. The suggestion is plainly wrong and ill-informed.\"\n\nAccording to an interview published in the Law Council's in-house journal in 2012, Eastman has long had an interest in gay rights.\n\nIn 2001, she was a junior barrister in a case about the validity of a transgender person's marriage. In 2012 she represented the Law Council at a parliamentary inquiry into same-sex marriage. The following year she represented the ACT in a High Court hearing into the validity of the territory\u2019s legalisation of gay marriage, which the court blocked.\n\nProtesters celebrate after the High Court overturned the ACT's same-sex marriage law in 2013. Rohan Thomson\n\nEastman's broader advocacy has offended conservatives. Three years ago, in a submission to a parliamentary inquiry into freedom of speech, she argued that section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act did not impose unreasonable restrictions.\n\nThe law against comments that offend on the basis of race or ethnicity is bitterly resented by many conservatives, who argue it is used to suppress legitimate speech.\n\nEarly in her career, Eastman realised that she would be criticised for defending institutions accused of misusing their power.\n\n\"Often when you work in the area of human rights, you have to act for unpopular people, unpopular causes and you have to have the strength to withstand criticisms \u2013 often personal criticisms about the work you do and the people you represent,\" she told law students at Monash University in 2005.\n\nBut she may consider that her right of free speech is now under attack, given the focus on her personal views. Certainly Israel Folau does. If the sides are unable to reach a settlement, a trial is planned for February.", "description": "Kate Eastman has spent her career defending free speech and human rights.
