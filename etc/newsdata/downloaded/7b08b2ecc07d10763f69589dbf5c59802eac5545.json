Facebook did something similar with phone numbers provided by users for two-factor authentication, the company confirmed last year.\n\n\"We recently discovered that when you provided an email address or phone number for safety or security purposes (for example, two-factor authentication) this data may have inadvertently been used for advertising purposes, specifically in our Tailored Audiences and Partner Audiences advertising system,\" Twitter's announcement reads.\n\nIn short, when an advertiser using Twitter uploaded their own marketing list of email addresses or phone numbers, Twitter may have matched the list to people on Twitter \"based on the email or phone number the Twitter account holder provided for safety and security purposes,\" the post adds.\n\n\"This was an error and we apologize,\" it read.\n\nKnow about a misuse of data? We'd love to hear from you.

Despite this, two-factor authentication remains a good security practice for the vast majority of Twitter users.\n\n\"We\u2019re very sorry this happened and are taking steps to make sure we don\u2019t make a mistake like this again,\" Twitter's post added.\n\nSubscribe to our cybersecurity podcast, CYBER.", "description": "This could make people think twice about using a phone number to secure their account at all.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d9cf3feed6367000ac0d636/lede/1570567176852-twitter-logo.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.843xh;0xw,0.086xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
