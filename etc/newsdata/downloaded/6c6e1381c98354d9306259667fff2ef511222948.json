In a news release on Sunday, the FBI announced that federal crime analysts believe all of his confessions are credible, and officials have been able to verify 50 confessions so far.\n\nInvestigators also provided new information and details about five cases in Florida, Arkansas, Kentucky, Nevada and Louisiana.\n\nThe 79-year-old Little is serving multiple life sentences in California. He says he strangled his 93 victims, nearly all of them women.\n\nSome of his victims were on the margins of society. Many were originally deemed overdoses, or attributed to accidental or undetermined causes. Some bodies were never found.\n\nThe FBI provided 30 drawings of some of his victims - colour portraits that were drawn by Little himself in prison. They are haunting portraits, mostly of black women.\n\nDrawings released by the FBI by Samuel Little of what he says are his victims [Handout/FBI]\n\nThe agency also provided videos taken during prison interviews with Little. He described how he spoke about a woman he strangled in 1993 - and how he rolled her down a slope on a desolate road.\n\n\"I heard a secondary road noise and that meant she was still rolling,\" he said.\n\n181129171223211\n\nIn another video, he described a victim in New Orleans. \"She was pretty. Light-coloured, honey-brown skin,\" he said with a small smile. \"She was tall for a woman. Beautiful shape. And, uh, friendly.\"\n\nIt was 1982, and they met in a club. She left with him in his Lincoln, and they parked by a bayou.\n\n\"That's the only one that I ever killed by drowning,\" he said.\n\nInvestigators around the country are still trying to piece together his confessions with unidentified remains and unsolved cases from decades past.\n\nIn August, he pleaded guilty to murdering four women in Ohio. He was convicted in California of three slayings in 2013 and pleaded guilty to another killing last year in Texas.\n\nAuthorities in Knox County, Tennessee, said Monday that a woman named Martha Cunningham was likely a victim of Little's.\n\nThe Knoxville News Sentinel reported in December that a cold case investigator with the Knox County Sheriff's Office had identified the victim who Little called \"Martha.\" The Knoxville mother's body was found in a wooded area in eastern Knox County in 1975.\n\nCunningham's body was found by a pair of hunters on the afternoon of January 18, 1975. She was bruised and nude from the waist down; her pantyhose and girdle bunched around her knees. Her purse and some of her jewellery were missing. Her body appeared to have been dragged into the woods and dumped behind a pine tree, authorities said at the time.\n\nDespite that evidence, detectives at the time attributed Cunningham's death to natural causes within a day of the discovery. The medical examiner's investigative report lists the probable cause of death as \"unknown.\"\n\nCunningham was a talented singer and pianist who grew up performing with her parents and her six younger siblings in a gospel group known as the Happy Home Jubilee Singers.", "description": "FBI believes Little's confessions to the murders of 93 women across the US are credible.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/7/5c1b59d508bf4f9fad54a2c835b7b0cc_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
