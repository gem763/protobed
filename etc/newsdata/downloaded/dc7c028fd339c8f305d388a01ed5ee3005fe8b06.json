Any restrictions on transferring medical records across the border could create substantial treatment delays or even put patients at risk if they are unable to access treatment.\n\n\"We're talking about real people being hurt as collateral damage in this political standoff,\" said Stephen McMahon, co-founder of the Irish Patients\u2019 Association, an advocacy group in Dublin. \"The very last thing we want to hear about is that some patients die because they couldn't get treatment in Northern Ireland.\"\n\nIn the last three years, more than 4,000 applications were approved for Irish residents to receive medical treatment in the United Kingdom.\n\nPatients in Donegal, a western county in the Republic, for instance, currently travel across the border for care at cancer treatment centre in Derry/Londonderry. But in the event of a no-deal, their medical records, including vital cancer-related documents, could face significant delays, potentially leading to life-threatening outcomes if doctors were unable to treat them.\n\nConcerns over patient care come amid growing tensions over the Northern Ireland border issue that is front and center of the Brexit deadlock.\n\nIt also underscores the many unintended consequences of a no-deal Brexit for people living in Ireland who routinely move between the U.K. and the Republic for medical treatment, education and more than 100 other forms of cross-border cooperation between London and Dublin. Doctors are already warning about possible medicine shortages if the U.K. leaves without a Withdrawal Agreement and complications for medical staff who either live or have qualifications from the Republic to continue working in the North.\n\nNo deal for data\n\nUnder a potential no-deal Brexit, existing EU cross-border health care arrangements between the U.K. and EU will stop. These include emergency health care for holidaymakers under the European Health Insurance Card program, as well as for British citizens living in other EU countries who receive local health care services.\n\nLondon says it's working on securing reciprocal health care deals with each EU country to continue existing arrangements.\n\nBoth the British and Irish governments have promised to continue offering cross-border health care between Northern Ireland and the Republic, no matter what Brexit deal is eventually agreed.\n\nIn a statement to POLITICO, Ireland's Department of Health said it has made arrangements with its U.K. counterparts to maintain routine and emergency health services for both British and Irish residents, including existing specialized treatments currently available to patients on both sides of the border.\n\nNorthern Ireland's Department of Health told POLITICO it is working with its Irish counterparts on ways for patient data to move freely between both jurisdictions in the event of a no-deal Brexit.\n\nBut when asked which legal mechanisms it would rely on to transfer people's health care information, Ireland's Department of Health admitted that it would be the responsibility of individual health care providers to ensure they could legally move patient data to the U.K. in compliance with EU privacy standards.\n\nWith a potential no-deal Brexit just over two months away, several Irish doctors said they are unaware of the additional steps needed to transfer patient data legally.\n\nIn response to questions about how data would be transferred between the U.K. and Ireland, Northern Ireland's Department of Health referred POLITICO to a section of Europe's new privacy rules, the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, that do not relate to international data. The agency later said individual hospitals and doctor's practices would be responsible for arranging legal agreements with their southern counterparts.\n\n\"I am particularly concerned that they don't seem to know which articles in GDPR relate to cross-border transfers,\" said Daragh O'Brien, managing director of Castlebridge, a data protection consultancy in Dublin. \"It's like basing your opinion of Professor Snape on the first two Harry Potter books. The important stuff is later on.\"\n\nDoctors across borders\n\nCross-border medical treatment in Ireland has become part of daily life.\n\nIn the last three years, more than 4,000 applications, representing roughly \u20ac38 million in cross-border medical procedures, were approved for Irish residents to receive medical treatment in the U.K., according to an investigation by the Detail.\n\nMany of these cross-border doctor visits are carried out as part of coordinated, EU-funded programs aimed at reducing health care costs for local providers and offering specialized services not available on one side of the border.\n\nThe cross-border system \"is currently working well for families and patients on both sides of the border,\" said Sarah Quinlan, chief executive of The Children's Heartbeat Trust, a charity in Belfast that supports families traveling for medical treatment in the Republic of Ireland and other parts of the U.K. Her organization has received assurances from London and Dublin that nothing will change in the event of a no-deal Brexit.\n\nThe lack of clarity over medical data transfers will test those promises.\n\nIf the U.K. leaves the EU without a Brexit agreement, London has said it will continue to allow data held by U.K. entities to move freely to the EU. Patient records held in Northern Ireland will still be transferred to the Republic and other parts of the soon-to-be 27-country bloc.\n\nBut the European Commission has said the reciprocal free-flow of data from the EU, including from Ireland, to the U.K. will stop in the event of a no-deal Brexit because London will no longer be included in the region's data protection regime. That includes U.K. data transferred to the EU for processing by third-party providers, which can then not be moved back to Britain.\n\nThe U.K. would be viewed as a third-party country and any EU entity moving personal information to the country would face significant legal limits, and possible hefty fines for failing to comply with EU privacy rules. A future data agreement between both sides is expected to take at least 18 months to negotiate, according to both EU and British officials.\n\n\"If people see a GP, their medical records regularly come back to us from the South\" \u2014 Frances O'Hagan, Northern Irish doctor\n\n\"If we come to a no-deal Brexit, the problem isn't Northern Ireland data moving to the EU,\" said Rory Campbell, a data protection lawyer in Belfast. \"It's that it becomes very difficult to move EU data to Northern Ireland.\"\n\nMedical professionals are expected to have few options for moving patient records from the Republic to the U.K.\n\nThey could ask people to sign additional consent forms, outlining how and why their personal information would be transferred outside of the EU. They could establish complex data agreements with British counterparts, known as standard contractual clauses, to provide legal cover for patient record transfers. Or they could rely on so-called legitimate interest \u2014 say, if a patient's life was in immediate jeopardy \u2014 to move data to a Northern Ireland medical facility.\n\nYet with a potential no-deal Brexit just over two months away, several Irish doctors who spoke to POLITICO said they are unaware of the additional steps needed to transfer patient data legally to the North.\n\nOthers said they plan to carry on as before, believing that Ireland's privacy watchdog is unlikely to target them for breaching the country's data protection rules. The Irish privacy watchdog told POLITICO that anyone moving information to a non-EU country must comply with existing rules or face possible investigation. The doctors spoke on the condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly about their employers' no-deal Brexit planning.\n\nFor Frances O'Hagan, a Northern Irish doctor who has worked in Armagh near the border for more than 20 years, time is running out.\n\nShe regularly sees Irish patients when they're referred to her practice for out-of-hours care, and her locals regularly use medical services south of the border when they're on holiday or visiting family in the Republic. Currently, she has no reciprocal data agreements in place to keep such treatment going in a no-deal Brexit.\n\n\"If people see a GP, their medical records regularly come back to us from the South,\" she said. \"Politicians have had three years to figure this out. A lot of this stuff is out of our control.\"\n\nHelen Collis contributed reporting from London.\n\nThis article is from POLITICO Pro: POLITICO\u2019s premium policy service.
