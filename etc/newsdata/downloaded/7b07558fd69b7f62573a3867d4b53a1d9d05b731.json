The government plans to cull the remaining unpurchased pigs, which are not suitable for meat processing, in Gimpo and Paju with the consent of farmers.While Yeoncheon will not undergo the measures to the extent of other areas as it has only one confirmed case of the virus, the government still plans to purchase 34,000 pigs from that area.The disease has so far been contained in the three areas and Ganghwa County, where all farmed pigs have already been culled. All four areas are north of the capital near the border with North Korea.The latest containment plan, however, faces resistance from pig farmers and organizations.The Gyeonggi branch of the Korea Pork Producers Association opposed the government plan in a statement last week, asking for compensation.\u201cThrough the government\u2019s unilateral decision, pig farms face shutting down,\u201d read the statement. \u201c[We] will not accept the government\u2019s measures on farms that have not consented and even those that do should be presented with rational compensation.\u201dThe mass culling has also prompted animal rights organizations to criticize the government\u2019s methods.While authorities have resorted to using carbon dioxide to first asphyxiate the pigs and then burying them in the ground, animal rights groups such as the Korea Association for Animal Protection have called for more humane methods like euthanasia.Meanwhile, additional cases of the disease have yet to be confirmed since last Wednesday.Although two suspected cases of ASF were reported on Sunday, including one in South Chungcheong, the country\u2019s largest pig-raising province, the government reported that tests from the suspected pig farms were negative.Pork prices have stabilized as the number of new confirmed cases has slowed down.BY CHAE YUN-HWAN [chae.yunhwan@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
