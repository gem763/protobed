That's the law. No ifs, no buts.\n\n'And if he doesn't, we'll enforce the law - in the courts and in Parliament. Whatever it takes, we will prevent a no-deal Brexit.'\n\nIt comes as Brussels gave the green light for a weekend of intense negotiations aimed at hammering out an agreement ahead of a crunch summit on Thursday.\n\nSir Keir poured scorn on suggestions Mr Johnson could get round the law by accompanying a request for an extension with a second letter to the EU saying he did not really want one.\n\nShadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer (pictured) has said Labour will do 'whatever it takes' to prevent no-deal\n\nSir Keir poured scorn on suggestions Mr Johnson (pictured at a school in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, yesterday) could get round the law by accompanying a request for an extension with a second letter to the EU saying he did not really want one\n\n'That's the equivalent of attaching a post-it note to divorce papers saying 'Only kidding'. It's a ridiculous idea.'\n\nWith EU and UK officials continuing to negotiate over the weekend, Sir Keir said if the Prime Minister did succeed in getting an agreement, Labour would demand it was put to the public in a fresh referendum.\n\n'If Boris Johnson does manage to negotiate a deal then we will insist that it is put back to the people in a confirmatory vote,' he said.\n\nWith Parliament set to sit in a special emergency Saturday session at the end of the week, Sir Keir said it appeared any agreement Mr Johnson was able to negotiate would be 'even worse' than Theresa May's rejected deal.\n\n'No level playing field protections. No customs union. A green light to deregulate. That kind of deal can never be one Labour supports,' he said.\n\nBrexiteer MP John Redwood this morning took to the airwaves to suggest two countries the Prime Minister should mirror in his Brexit trade agreement.\n\nIt comes as Brexiteer MP John Redwood (pictured) took to the airwaves this morning to suggest two countries the Prime Minister should mirror in his Brexit trade agreement\n\nWhat happens next in the Brexit crisis? Sunday: Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron are due to meet in France. The dinner will be a key waypointer to whether a deal will be possible next week. Monday: Parliament is due to return for the Queen's Speech. In Brussels, the EU will 'take stock' with Mr Barnier over whether the legal text meets their criteria and can be put before leaders for approval. October 17-18: A crunch EU summit in Brussels. Any deal could be signed off by leaders here. If the talks have broken down, expect Boris Johnson to either boycott the event, or stage a dramatic walkout. October 19: Parliament will sit on Saturday for the first time since the Falklands War. If there is no Brexit deal by this date Remainer legislation obliges the PM to beg the EU for an extension to avoid No Deal. Mr Johnson is likely to force a vote to make MPs 'own' any delay, having said he would rather 'die in a ditch' than accept one. If there is a deal in place, there will be a make-or-break vote on whether to back it. If passed by the Commons, the government will start rushing legislation through Parliament immediately. Monday: Jeremy Corbyn has said that he will let Mr Johnson trigger an election after an extension has been secured. This would probably be the first day when a motion can be brought to a vote under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, or a confidence vote can be held. October 31: The current deadline for the UK to leave the EU, which Mr Johnson has previously described as 'do or die'. Thursday, November 28: An election looks inevitable whichever way the Brexit drama goes. Legally there must be 25 working days between Parliament being dissolved and the election date. This looks to be the most likely date for a poll, given they are traditionally held on Thursdays.\n\nToday marks the starting gun for fresh, 'intensive' negotiations between the EU and Mr Johnson's team, following EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier's declaration last night that a deal was possible within days.\n\nIt gave the green light for a weekend of intense negotiations aimed at hammering out an agreement ahead of a crunch summit on Thursday.\n\nMr Redwood suggested Mr Johnson should look for a free trade agreement.\n\nDuring a discussion on how to unlock the Brexit 'impasse', he told the BBC's Today Programme: 'I think the border issue is greatly exaggerated because it's within the interests of the EU and the Republic of Ireland to exaggerate it.\n\n'It's mainly about what kind of barriers the EU would want to impose on their side because we don't really need barriers on our side, other than the ones we've already got. But the way to unlock it is to have a free trade agreement.\n\n'But why can't the EU see it and why can't they understand if they can do a free trade agreement to Japan and Canada they could surely give one to their near neighbours who, under treaty, they have to have a good relationship with us.'\n\nOn the current Brexit plan, Mr Redwood added: 'I think it's extremely difficult moving between the option of splitting Northern Ireland off or all of us ending up in the customs union and single market.\n\n'I look forward to seeing what they might be able to find out that is better.'\n\nThe Prime Minister welcomed the shift by Brussels, but warned that 'there's a way to go' and that it is not yet a 'done deal'.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s important now that our negotiators on both sides get into proper talks about how to sort this thing out,\u2019 he added.\n\nDiplomats in Brussels said Mr Johnson had secured the breakthrough by agreeing to a customs border in the Irish Sea.\n\nSpeaking on a visit to a school yesterday afternoon, Mr Johnson said the new blueprint - which has been kept determinedly under wraps - would mean the 'whole of the UK takes full advantage of Brexit'.\n\nBut he dodged when pressed on whether Northern Ireland will definitely leave the EU's customs union, saying people should simply 'look at what I have said before and draw their own conclusions'.\n\nBoris Johnson was visiting a school in Beaconsfield yesterday (pictured) as the drama unfolded\n\nDemocratic Unionist Party leader Arlene Foster, whose support will be key to getting a deal through Parliament, fired a warning shot at the Prime Minister last night when she insisted she would block anything that \u2018traps Northern Ireland in the European Union, whether single market or customs union, as the rest of the UK leaves\u2019.\n\nBut she also said she was willing to be \u2018flexible\u2019 and indicated she could support proposals that see Northern Ireland treated differently to the rest of the UK if they have the backing of people in the province.\n\nHardline Eurosceptic Tory MPs provided further optimism there might be the numbers to get an agreement through the Commons when they said they were not ruling out supporting the suggested changes.\n\nBritish officials will spend today and tomorrow locked in talks with their EU counterparts at the European Commission\u2019s Berlaymont headquarters in Brussels.", "description": "Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer (pictured) said the party would do 'whatever it takes' to prevent the UK leaving the EU at the end of the month without an agreement.", "authors": ["James Gant For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/13/19626430-0-image-a-10_1570884821741.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
