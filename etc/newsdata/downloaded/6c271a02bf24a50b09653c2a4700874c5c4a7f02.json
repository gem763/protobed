The 2019 North America edition of the GSMA\u2019s Mobile Economy report series \u2013 published today at MWC Los Angeles \u2013 forecasts that almost half of the region\u2019s mobile connections will be running on new 5G networks by 2025. This is being fuelled by operator spending on new networks, which is forecast to total more than $380 billion (Capex) between 2018 and 2025. These investments are increasingly being focused on building-out 5G coverage across the region, enabling a range of new services for consumers and enterprise.\n\n\u201cOur new study highlights how the North America region is vying for global 5G leadership with pioneering mobile markets such as China, Japan and South Korea,\u201d said Mats Granryd, Director General of the GSMA. \u201cInvestments in next-generation networks and services by operators has helped create an industry that is now worth a trillion dollars a year to the region\u2019s economy, providing a platform for innovation, jobs and economic growth.\u201d\n\nThe new report reveals that:\n\nThere were 321 million unique mobile subscribers 1 in North America in 2018, representing 83 per cent of the population.

The share of 4G connections will decline over the coming years as the market moves to 5G. New 5G networks are forecast to account for 46 per cent of connections by 2025.\n\nMobile technologies and services generated 4.2 per cent of North America\u2019s GDP in 2018, equivalent to $937 billion in economic value. This economic impact is forecast to increase to almost $1.2 trillion by 2023 (4.8% of GDP).\n\nThe region\u2019s mobile ecosystem also supported 2.3 million jobs (directly and indirectly) and made substantial contributions to the funding of the public sector, with almost $123 billion raised through taxation last year (not including spectrum fees).\n\nNorth America\u2019s mobile sector is on track to generate $280 billion in revenue this year, a result of high levels of consumer engagement and spending on mobile services.\n\nThe new report \u2018The Mobile Economy, North America 2019\u2019 is authored by GSMA Intelligence, the research arm of the GSMA.
