A dietitian weighs in on that disputed study.", "language": "en", "text": "But while experts continue to battle it out over nutritional science, personal bias and whether the beef industry financed the research, my worry as a dietitian is that consumers will believe they can eat as much red meat as they want and that it will never affect their health. When you look closely at the studies, that\u2019s not the right conclusion to make.\n\nBefore I dive in, I want to address the issue of bias, because I\u2019ve been accused of being both a shill for the beef industry (I\u2019m not) and a vegan advocate (I\u2019m not that, either). I personally don\u2019t eat meat because I don\u2019t enjoy it, but I also don\u2019t rail against people who eat meat. I base my professional opinions and recommendations on the strongest science that exists. Unfortunately, that can be difficult, because nutritional science is often weak. And that issue is at the root of the controversy over the AIM recommendations.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAIM published five systematic reviews on the connection between meat consumption and health and made dietary recommendations in a \u201cclinical guideline\u201d paper. The studies showed that reducing meat intake is associated with very small decreases in developing certain cancers, as well as small decreases in dying from heart disease and Type 2 diabetes. So you\u2019d think the final recommendation would be to reduce red meat intake; after all, small decreases are better than no decreases, right?\n\nIt wasn\u2019t, however. The final recommendation was that adults should continue their current consumption of unprocessed and processed red meat. Evidence linking meat to different chronic diseases was graded by the AIM panel of researchers as \u201cweak recommendations based on low-certainty evidence\u201d because much of it was observational (which means it shows correlations, rather than cause and effect). So the researchers decided consumers may as well just eat meat.\n\nJohn Sievenpiper, a researcher at the University of Toronto who worked on the AIM paper about meat, cancer and heart disease (but not on the clinical guideline paper), said, \u201cI completely oppose this final recommendation and worry about the lasting damage to public and planetary health.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd he\u2019s not alone. Three of the 14 panelists who voted on the final guideline also disagreed with the recommendation. And AIM has come under fire by many health experts who have highlighted major flaws in the research, saying the papers left out key data and used inappropriate analyses. The researchers also chose to ignore how eating meat affects the environment, something we really can\u2019t afford to ignore anymore.\n\nCritics also point out that one of the AIM papers was specifically about consumers\u2019 values and preferences regarding meat consumption and that the final recommendation gave too much weight to the fact that consumers enjoy meat and don\u2019t want to give it up. These critics, many of whom are proponents of plant-based diets, have asked the journal to retract the studies. To date, the journal has not taken this step.\n\nSome experts also question whether the beef industry influenced or financed these studies. I asked the lead author of the clinical guideline, Bradley Johnston, and he maintains that the research was unfunded. But my job is not to trace the funding; it\u2019s to help readers figure out how much meat is a safe amount to eat.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo consumers, the advice to continue to eat their \u201ccurrent\u201d levels of meat can be confusing. Does it make a difference if you eat two servings a week or 15 servings a week? Of course, it does, but that\u2019s not clarified in the recommendation from the AIM panel that was picked up by media (it just said \u201ccontinue current red meat consumption\u201d).\n\nJohnston said that the research was based on the assumption that consumers are eating three or four meat servings per week. But people may benefit from cutting back if their meat consumption is higher than this (again, he explains this is a weak recommendation with low certainty).\n\nI also asked Johnston whether there is enough science to make a recommendation for how much meat is the right amount to eat, and he said \u201cno.\u201d There\u2019s no gold standard study that can truly answer this question.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo where does that leave you when you\u2019re planning your menu? Here\u2019s the thing: Nutrition research is difficult to conduct, so we all must live with some uncertainty about exactly what to eat. The weight of the evidence (although admittedly imperfect) still supports eating patterns like the DASH and Mediterranean diets, which recommend cutting back on ultra-processed foods and including lots of plant-based foods (vegetables, fruit, nuts, beans), plus fish, chicken and the option of small amounts of red meat.\n\nStudies link these dietary patterns to a reduced risk of hypertension, heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, dementia and certain cancers. Of course, even some of these studies have been criticized for their methodology, bias or funding sources. Nutritional science is imperfect, but the magnitude of these studies is the best direction we have right now.\n\nThe DASH and Mediterranean diets don\u2019t suggest specific amounts of red meat but emphasize a whole dietary pattern, which is more important than any one food. DASH, or Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, recommends no more than 6 ounces of protein-rich foods per day, which can include fish, chicken or meat, and it specifically recommends reducing meat and increasing vegetables, whole grains and beans. The Mediterranean diet suggests having meat \u201cinfrequently\u201d or \u201cless often,\u201d which is often interpreted as once a week or a few times a month.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nInterestingly, some of the most well known and well respected studies supporting the DASH, Mediterranean and other plant-based diets were left out of the AIM analyses, because they didn\u2019t fit the criteria of being specifically about meat consumption. Omitting these key pieces of research is one of the points that critics attacked and may have contributed to the final flawed recommendation.\n\nGiven the problems with the AIM study, I stand by my long-held belief that a varied diet with lots of whole, plant-based foods, less ultra-processed foods and \u2014 yes \u2014 small amounts of red meat is your best bet for reducing your risk of disease.\n\nRegistered dietitian Cara Rosenbloom is president of Words to Eat By, a nutrition communications company specializing in writing, nutrition education and recipe development.
