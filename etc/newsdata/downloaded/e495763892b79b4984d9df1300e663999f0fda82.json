Thanks!! pic.twitter.com/5O44fu4i7y \u2014 Sara Rivest (@SRivestWAVE3) September 20, 2019\n\nSara Rivest had a job to do, so she tried to shift gears quickly after a man swooped into her live shot to plant a kiss on her cheek before darting away.\n\n\u201cThat was not appropriate,\u201d the Louisville television reporter said. She laughed uncomfortably. The camera soon cut to upbeat music and footage from the Kentucky festival Rivest was covering.\n\nBut the more Rivest thought about the incident from last Friday, the less she wanted to just move on \u2014 like so many journalists who have been harassed on the job and so many women objectified and touched without their consent. Re-watching the clip from WAVE 3 News, Rivest saw the man pretend to spank her in the background, grinning widely below his sunglasses.\n\n\u201cI felt like a prop in a joke,\u201d she told The Washington Post.\n\nShe filed a police report, unsure if the man could be identified. On Wednesday, a 42-year-old named Eric Goodman was charged with harassment involving physical contact.\n\nIt\u2019s a gratifying moment of accountability for Rivest as she tries to convey that what the cameras caught is \u201cunacceptable\u201d rather than a fun prank. The on-air incident was a first for Rivest, but it\u2019s a hazard of the job well documented in viral clips and YouTube compilations with titles such as \u201cThis is Hilarious.\u201d One group counted at least 30 female reporters harassed live while covering the 2018 soccer World Cup in Russia.\n\nThe Post was unable to reach Goodman. But Rivest believes he is repentant. Wednesday evening on WAVE 3, she read aloud from what she says is his apology letter.\n\n\u201cI was wrong to interrupt your job, invade your personal space and leave you feeling powerless,\u201d says the letter, which states that Goodman interrupted Rivest\u2019s segment while trying to be funny amid a bachelor party.\n\nRivest says she believes the words are genuine, though she got the letter from police after authorities found Goodman. But she also thinks the misdemeanor charge \u2014 punishable by up to 90 days in jail or a fine of up to $250 \u2014 is appropriate.\n\nThe Jefferson County Attorney\u2019s Office did not respond to inquiries Thursday, but Rivest said she doubts Goodman will face jail time. His court date is set for November, according to WAVE 3 News.\n\nShe\u2019s accomplished what she wanted, Rivest said: \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019ll do it again.\u201d\n\nRivest has also sparked a flurry of media coverage and fueled a broader discussion about harassment of journalists. That harassment extends to colleagues both male and female, she said, but women in particular are targets.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a difference in the way women are expected to handle it sometimes,\u201d she told The Post. \u201cI\u2019m sure everyone would tell me I don\u2019t need to feel this way, but I felt this need to laugh it off, and be reassuring that it was okay, even though it wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nOne female reporter at the 2018 World Cup in Russia pressed on without comment after a man put his hand on her chest and kissed her while she spoke on air. She criticized the \u201cviolent act of a fan\u201d only later on Twitter.\n\nBut others have rebuked their harassers the same way they were targeted \u2014 on air.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do this!\u201d another World Cup reporter, Julia Guimar\u00e3es, admonished a man who tried to kiss her cheek. \u201cNever do this again, okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d the man said.\n\n\u201cNever do this to a woman,\u201d Guimar\u00e3es added as the cameras rolled. \u201cRespect.\u201d\n\nReporting last week outside the Kentucky Exposition Center, Rivest reacted first with embarrassment and surprise, she said. In the clip that Rivest would later pin atop her Twitter page with the words, \u201cHey mister, here\u2019s your 3 seconds of fame,\u201d the journalist jerks away from her kisser \u2014 and then, quickly as he entered the shot, the man is gone.\n\nWith the incident broadcast for all to see, though, tips about the man\u2019s identity started pouring in on Twitter, Rivest said. That led to Goodman, identified in charging documents as a resident of Indiana.\n\nWhile Rivest wants the episode to raise awareness about an all-too-common occurrence for journalists, she and Louisville Metro Police spokeswoman Alicia Smiley both drew attention to the cases of unwanted contact and harassment that aren\u2019t caught on live video. Maybe Thursday\u2019s charge will serve as a warning for the off-camera culprits too, they said.\n\n\u201cSo many people have reached out to me with stories that are way worse than this, and the person doesn\u2019t get caught or doesn\u2019t get charged,\u201d Rivest said.\n\nFor Kim Walsh-Childers, a journalism professor at the University of Florida who has researched harassment of female journalists, the consequences Goodman now faces are a sign of changing times amid #MeToo and a growing willingness to call out inappropriate behavior.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d hope that female reporters and photographers, videographers, producers, anybody who\u2019s out dealing with the public is much more likely now to say, you know what, that is not acceptable,\u201d she said.\n\nThe charge against Goodman \u201creminds people that this is not a game, it\u2019s not a gag, it\u2019s not a stunt,\u201d she said.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe creator of the labradoodle says he made \u2018Frankenstein\u2019s monster\u2019\n\nA newspaper reported that a man\u2019s ancestors were slaveholders.
