That followed several companies in China, including some of the NBA\u2019s major business partners there, lashing out over Morey\u2019s original tweet.\n\n'We're still the best': Stephen Curry commits to playing in 2020 Olympics Read more\n\nThe uproar started when Morey tweeted an image that read: \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d It referred to the four-month old protest movement that has upturned the semi-autonomous Chinese territory. That led to Houston owner Tilman Fertitta turning to Twitter to say that Morey does not speak for the Rockets, and sparking an outcry that included the Chinese Basketball Association, whose president is former Rockets center Yao Ming, saying it was suspending its relationship with the team.\n\nOther criticism came from Tencent, a major media partner of the NBA in China with a streaming deal that is worth $1.5bn over the next five years, and Chinese state television both of which said they would not be showing Rockets games. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear if Morey\u2019s new tweets or the NBA\u2019s statement that followed would be enough to salvage those relationships. Chinese athletic apparel maker Li-Ning also released a statement saying it was upset with Morey\u2019s tweet.\n\n\u201cI did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China,\u201d Morey tweeted early Monday from Japan, where Houston is playing this week. \u201cI was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event. I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives.\n\n\u201cI have always appreciated the significant support our Chinese fans and sponsors have provided and I would hope that those who are upset will know that offending or misunderstanding them was not my intention. My tweets are my own and in no way represent the Rockets or the NBA.\u201d\n\nNBA chief communications officer Mike Bass said the league recognises that Morey\u2019s tweet \u201cdeeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable.\u201d Bass added that the league supports individuals \u201csharing their views on matters important to them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together,\u201d Bass said.\n\nThe timing of this is particularly awkward for the NBA. China has teams in the US playing preseason games this week and fostering strong relationships with China has been a priority of the NBA for at least three decades.\n\nThe NBA has a China office, just announced plans to add a gaming team in Shanghai to the NBA 2K League, and officials in both countries say as many as 500m Chinese watched at least one NBA game last season. Several NBA players, including major current and former stars like Stephen Curry and Kobe Bryant, go to China annually to promote their individual brands, and the World Cup held in China earlier this summer saw countless fans attending in NBA jerseys.\n\nThe Rockets, largely because of Yao, have an enormous Chinese following. But after Morey\u2019s tweet, even the Chinese government\u2019s consulate office in Houston issued a statement saying it \u201cexpressed strong dissatisfaction\u201d with the team.", "description": "Houston\u2019s general manager has tried to defuse the rapidly growing fallout over his deleted tweet that showed support for anti-government protesters", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58632768b9bc9afb7fabff17a40e8067ea030c44/0_89_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=68562df7e63c23d5fcb21e37a5036127", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
