Her parents said Boparan had destoryed their lives\n\nBoparan, of Sutton Coldfield, West Mids., was charged with causing death by dangerous driving 13 years after the collision.\n\nHe was jailed for 18 months in March after he admitted the charge at Birmingham Crown Court.\n\nBut today it emerged Boparan, former director of the 2 Sisters Food Group, has been released from prison after just seven months behind bars.\n\nBoparan was 19 when he caused Cerys's injuries while overtaking in his mother's powerful \u00a357,000 Range Rover, six months after passing his test.\n\nThe Edwards family were returning home from delivering Christmas presents when Boparan crashed into them on the wrong side of the road on November 11, 2006.\n\nHe could have faced 14 years in prison if Cerys had died at the time but instead served just six months in prison.\n\nThe outrage over the sentence sparked a national outrage and a campaign was launched demanding Government action.\n\nThe Edwards family were returning home from delivering Christmas presents when Boparan crashed into them on the wrong side of the road on November 11, 2006\n\nHe could have faced 14 years in prison for the horror smash (pictured) if Cerys had died at the time but instead served just six months in prison\n\nThe outrage over the sentence following Boparan's 70mph crash in a 30mph zone sparked a campaign demanding Government action\n\nMore than 13,000 campaigners supported tougher sentences and a petition was also delivered to Westminster by Cerys's parents in July 2009.\n\nLabour's former Justice Minister Jack Straw called the Edwards family himself to give them the news about what became known as 'Cerys's Law'.\n\nAs a result of the changes, anyone convicted of causing serious injury by dangerous driving now faces up to five years in prison instead of the previous maximum of two.\n\nCerys was awarded \u00a35million compensation in 2012, along with a guaranteed annual payout of \u00a3450,000 to help pay for her annual care bill.\n\nAt the time Judge Martin McKenna, sitting at Birmingham County Court, described it as the 'saddest and most tragic case' he had ever come across.\n\nThe Range Rover Boparan was driving in 2006 was owned by his wealthy parents, Ranjit and Baljinder Boparan, who run the 2 Sisters Food Group - one of the largest food companies in the UK by turnover with a annual revenues of \u00a33.4billion.\n\nSpeaking after Cerys' death, grieving father Gareth Edwards, 51, paid tribute to his daughter whose smile 'would melt the hearts of anyone'.\n\nHe had also pushed at the time for new charges to be brought against 'child killer' Boparan so he can 'serve a proper sentence'.\n\nGareth, a builder from Sutton Coldfield, added: 'Police have found his actions caused the death of my daughter so he is a child killer, simple as that.\n\n'He killed my daughter.\n\n'I want to see him in that dock again facing charges of manslaughter or murder. He used that motor vehicle to kill my daughter.\n\n'I cannot turn the clock back - my daughter is gone and is six feet under - all I can do is fight for justice for that little girl.\n\n'Cerys is the victim of this. She could not talk, she could not walk, but I will stand up and fight for justice for her.\n\n'He needs to serve a proper sentence for what he did. He is scum.'\n\nThe Range Rover Boparan was driving in 2006 was owned by his wealthy parents, Ranjit and Baljinder Boparan, who run the 2 Sisters Food Group - one of the largest food companies in the UK by turnover with a annual revenues of \u00a33.4billion (headquarters pictured)\n\nIn a heartbreaking victim impact statement read out in court, Mr Edwards told how his life had been a 'nightmare' as a result of Boparan's callous actions.\n\nHe said: 'Nine days after we held a big first birthday party for Cerys on November 2, I was forced to perform CPR on my own daughter.\n\n'I can't into words how this makes me feel - it was the beginning of a nightmare.\n\n'It breaks my heart every time I think about it and I feel guilty I wasn't able to protect her.\n\n'Boparan served only six months in prison - a kick to my stomach which still hurts to this day.'\n\nMr Edwards also branded the 18 month sentence handed down to Boparan as an insult.\n\nHe said: 'Boparan will only serve around 15 months behind bars in total for killing a child and destroying several lives, which is a complete insult.\n\n'We have been left with a life sentence without our beautiful little girl whose precious life was stolen from us.'", "description": "Boparan, of Sutton Coldfield, was charged with causing death by dangerous driving 13 years after the collision, following Cerys Edwards' death at 9.
