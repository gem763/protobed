Biden. They have asked Mr. Giuliani to turn over all phone records and text messages by October 15.\n\nThe subpoena, issued by the House\u2019s foreign affairs, intelligence and oversight committees, comes just days after the same committees issued a similar subpoena to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nBoth subpoenas are signs House Democrats are rapidly advancing their impeachment inquiry.\n\nIn addition to the subpoena, the chairmen informed Mr. Giuliani that it has scheduled depositions for three of his business associates who they claim have \u201cdocuments relevant\u201d to the Ukraine matter.\n\nThe individuals are Lev Parnas, Igor Fruman and Semyon \u201cSam\u201d Kislin. Depositions are scheduled from Oct. 10-14, according to the letter.\n\nIt is not clear if Mr. Giuliani would comply with the subpoena. In an interview Friday with CNN, Mr. Giuliani said he would not testify without consulting with Mr. Trump, his client.\n\n\n\n\u201cUltimately, if I were to say \u2018yes\u2019 and he were to say, \u2018no,\u2019 I can\u2019t testify,\u201d he told the news network adding that he had not talked to the president about testifying.\n\n\n\nIn the same interview, he said would consider challenging any subpoena on the grounds \u201cthey are not a legitimate committee\u201d\n\n\n\nMr. Giuliani has become a key figure in the political firestorm surrounding the president\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The phone call, in which Mr. Trump suggests Ukraine investigate 2020 Democratic presidential front-runner Joseph R. Biden and his son Hunter, led to the House launching an impeachment inquiry.\n\n\n\nAccording to a White House-released transcript of the call, Mr. Trump asked his Ukrainian counterpart to work with Mr. Giuliani and Attorney General William P. Barr to probe the Bidens.\n\n\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, California Democrat, last week identified both Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Barr as among those he\u2019d like to talk with. Mr. Schiff is one of the three committee chairmen, along with Reps. Elliot Engel of New York and Elijah Cummings of Maryland, all Democrats.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
