They are epitomised by a fictional high-street fashion mogul called Sir Richard \u201cGreedy\u201d McCreadie as he prepares for a monumentally tasteless, Fyre festival-ish, Roman-themed 60th birthday party on the plutocrats\u2019 island of Mykonos. (Rome in Greece? Why not?)\n\n\n\nMcCreadie has just suffered a nightmare of bad publicity following a catastrophically bad-tempered performance in front of a parliamentary select committee, and all the celebs are starting to pull out of his bash. One star who will be there is Clarence, a real, live lion for a re-creation of the Coloseum scene from the movie Gladiator. There\u2019s no need to wonder if that might go horribly, black-comically and symbolically wrong.\n\n\n\nThis is, of course, all a caricature of the Topshop supremo Philip Green. McCreadie is played by Steve Coogan with a tan, an open-necked shirt, alpha-male silver-grey hair and emulsion-white teeth. It is a nice enough performance from Coogan, but this excellent actor is not especially challenged by the shallow, if entertaining, role as it is written, and his technical skill in performance is perhaps best shown most in a tiny moment when he impersonates Bert Lahr as the Cowardly Lion from The Wizard of Oz.\n\nIsla Fisher plays Sir Richard\u2019s first wife, in whose name all his tax-avoiding profits were originally registered in Monaco \u2013 though whether their divorce meant McCreadie had to take a financial hit isn\u2019t entirely clear. (Philip Green, who has precisely this financial arrangement with his wife Tina, is not divorced.) Shirley Henderson gives an enjoyably robust performance as his elderly Irish mum; Sarah Solemani plays the harassed assistant whose job it is to book Elton John to play at the party; Asa Butterfield is the stroppy teen son with an Oedipal resentment of his dad; and David Mitchell plays a cynical and self-hating journalist-turned-biographer whom Sir Richard has hired to write a sycophantic authorised life.\n\nThe movie rattles along in mockumentary style, giving us a moment-by-moment display of this hideous carnival of vanity and suppressed despair. But compared to, say, lethally funny TV such as Succession, or indeed Veep, which Gray also worked on, Greed isn\u2019t especially penetrating about money or power. It comes alive most satisfyingly in the flashbacks showing McCreadie as an obnoxious public schoolboy (played by Jamie Blackley), and there is a clever montage imagining all the grisly high-street clothing stores with names like Xcellent that he has set up and put out of business over the years. Scenes in Sri Lanka show how he has brutally exploited developing-world labour - and always with screeching, bullying self-pity, as though they are exploiting him.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rome on Mykenos \u2026 Isla Fisher, Coogan and Asa Butterfield in Greed. Photograph: Sony Pictures\n\nWinterbottom chucks everything up to and including the kitchen sink into this movie: sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn\u2019t. Like many films, Greed rather casually brings in the subject of refugees to bolster the drama\u2019s moral and political seriousness: there are some unsightly Syrian refugees on the Mykonos beach that Sir Richard would like removed \u2013 but in truth this subject is not very important to the film. There is a fair bit to enjoy here, including some interesting details. Will Elton John really play your party for $1m? Will Tom Jones really do it for $350,000, and will James Blunt play a single song for 75 grand? Is that what he charged for his cameo here?\n\n\u2022Greed screened at the Toronto film festival and goes on release in the UK on 22 November.", "description": "Michael Winterbottom\u2019s entertaining mockumentary about a high-street fashion tycoon presents a hideous carnival of obscene wealth, vanity and moral squalor", "authors": ["Peter Bradshaw"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb6b9de714fc3f97692b9478856736aafc07e31b/0_290_3517_2110/master/3517.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=b5f4ce1f31fd71638dec54f7dc8b8a01", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
