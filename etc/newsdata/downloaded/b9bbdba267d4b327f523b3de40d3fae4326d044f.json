I don\u2019t go out now, the weather is too cold and I can\u2019t chance it due to the risk of developing an infection.\u2019\n\nSteve was diagnosed with Pyoderma Gangrenosum in August 2019 (Picture: Caters News)\n\nSteve said the pain felt \u2018like someone sticking in knives at various points across your body continuously\u2019 and said he needs help washing and dressing, robbing him of his independence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018If I go out people will just stare at me,\u2019 he added.\n\n\u2018Some people will come up and ask me \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong\u201d but most just stare.\u2019\n\nThe condition can develop for no reason and results in boils and blisters developing into painful ulcers that ooze fluid across the body and can become dangerously infected.\n\nSteve noticed boils cropping up on his face in December 2017.\n\nThe former carpenter had to give up his job because of the condition (Picture: Caters News)\n\nHe was referred to a dermatologist the following year who told him they had \u2018never seen anything as aggressive before\u2019.\n\nFour skin biopsies failed to find what was causing the ulcers, which continued to grow bigger and more painful.\n\nNow he is trying to raise money to seek private treatment for the condition.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve tried all sorts of medication and nothing seems to work,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve been on steroids for 18 months and I\u2019ve put on three-and-a-half stone.\n\n\u2018All I want is to live a normal life and to get back to work. For the condition to go away would be the world\u2019s best Christmas present. It would be a breath of fresh air.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
