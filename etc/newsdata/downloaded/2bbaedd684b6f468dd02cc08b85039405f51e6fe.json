And you can see why it might not even have occurred to the Bidens that this kind of thing is morally suspect. Barack Obama himself has scarcely been better, with his post-presidential buckraking career of speeches before Wall Street banks at $400,000 a pop \u2014 after stubbornly refusing to prosecute a veritable container ship-load of financial crimes by big banks as president.\n\nOnly chumps like Jimmy Carter forswear the hustle and live modestly \u2014 that is, just scraping by on a piddling $210,700 presidential pension, plus occasional floods of book revenues. What is an ex-president supposed to do, serve as some kind of moral example of republican virtue? How are you supposed to go windsurfing with Richard Branson if you act like Cincinnatus?\n\nLiberals often get furious when you criticize their favorite leaders for being money-grubbing scoundrels who let their kids trade on their name. But nominating Biden would be a political grenade that explodes right in the middle of Democratic messaging about why Trump should be impeached and defeated in 2020. Instead of a clean, simple message the Democrats are clean and Republicans are corrupt, they would be forced into complicated arguments that Biden\u2019s history isn\u2019t as bad, or tendentious, unconvincing arguments that it isn\u2019t bad at all.
