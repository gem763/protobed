But we can learn to live with our neighbours", "language": "en", "text": "Many of us love gardening for the peace: a spot of deadheading and a once-round with the watering can on a summer\u2019s evening offers a particular therapeutic bliss. But for some, flowers means strife and discord. And in the green and pleasant suburb of Wimbledon, south-west London, a neighbourly dispute over a rambling rose has actually ended up in court.\n\nRosa Rahman, a 73-year-old who claims her garden is her \u201clife\u2019s work\u201d, pleaded guilty to threatening a doctor, Mathiaparanam Sreetharan. She accused him of pouring weedkiller on her beloved blooms, which teetered into his patch. He accused her of pinning a death threat on his fence.\n\nHow absolutely wicked. But let\u2019s be frank, hardly unusual. He won\u2019t have been the first to have hacked away at a neighbour\u2019s pride and joy after it strayed onto his own garden path. Overzealous, light-blocking conifers are such a familiar bane of British life that they\u2019ve become plot devices in Jilly Cooper novels. Up and down the country, do we not all tut at those whose lavender bushes need a haircut, whose eucalyptus trees tower too near the wall and, of course, whose lawns cry out for a bloody good mow?\n\nWe are a nation of gardeners, blessed by considerable rainfall and, for the most part, a modest plot attached to our homes in which to potter and prune. Ever since the Victorian housing boom \u2013 planned with gardens and green squares in mind \u2013 we have used our gardens as an extension of our homes, our castles \u2013 to be defended.", "description": "Many of us love gardening for the peace:", "authors": ["Alice Vincent", "Janet Daley", "Juliet Samuel", "Michael Deacon", "Sarah Champion"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/03/30/1949882-GPWI07-00000267-008-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqK1j0pLapztdY-jwWiC44LW4lPbr8UynsfK0JwimVors.jpg", "published_at": "2017-03-30"}
