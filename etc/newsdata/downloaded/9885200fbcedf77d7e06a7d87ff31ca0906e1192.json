So, our number one draft product is Pepsi cola \u2014 which is almost sacrilege. And, we sell more coffee and tea combined, which isn't a draft product, than Pepsi,\" Martin said.\n\n\"So, that's one of the trends that you are seeing. More variety is required as well \u2026 but I would say far more non-alcoholic drinks, far more coffee and more food in pubs. Those are the big trends.\"", "description": "JD Wetherspoon reported a rise in full year pre-tax profit on Friday, defying intensifying Brexit uncertainty.", "authors": ["Sam Meredith"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106128285-1568374933232gettyimages-854462348.jpeg?v=1568374980", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
