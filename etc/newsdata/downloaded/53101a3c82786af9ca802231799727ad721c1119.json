He immediately answered, \"yes.\"\n\nButtigieg responded to the incident on \"State of the Union\" Sunday and said O'Rourke is playing with fire.\n\n\"The idea that you are going to strip churches of their tax-exempt status if they haven\u2019t found their way toward blessing same-sex marriage, I\u2019m not sure [O'Rourke] understood the implications of what he was saying,\" he said.\n\nBETO O'ROURKE: UKRAINE WHISTLEBLOWER'S REPORTED CONNECTION TO 2020 CAMPAIGN IS 'IMMATERIAL'\n\n\"That means going to war, not only with churches, but I would think with mosques and a lot of organizations that may not have the same view of various religious principles that I do.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"There can be no reward, no benefit, no tax break for anyone or any institution, any organization in America, that denies the full human rights and the full civil rights of every single one of us,\" O'Rourke said during the forum. \"Freedom of religion is a fundamental right, but it should not be used to discriminate.\"\n\nButtigieg, who is openly gay, stressed the need for a strict separation of church and state but reiterated how much more divisive the country would become if O'Rourke's proposed policy solution was ever carried out.\n\n\"Going after the tax exception of churches, Islamic centers or other religious facilities... that's just going to deepen the divisions that we\u2019re already experiencing -- at a moment when we\u2019re actually seeing more and more people motivated often by compassion and by people they love, moving in the right direction on LGBTQ rights,\" he said. \"Which is obviously extremely important to me personally.\"\n\nFox News' Caleb Parke contributed to this report", "description": "2020 presidential hopeful Beto O'Rourke's\u00a0proposal to strip churches of their tax-exempt status if they don't support same-sex marriage, is tantamount to declaring \"war\" on faith-based groups, and will only further divide an already polarized nation, said South Bend Mayor, Pete Buttigieg.", "authors": ["Nick Givas", "Nick Givas Is A Reporter With Fox News.
