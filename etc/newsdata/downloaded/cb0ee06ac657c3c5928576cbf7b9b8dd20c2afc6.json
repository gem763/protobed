He came to Mexico City hoping he'll soon secure a contract that will let him finally move out of his parents' home in England.\n\nBut like a youngster on a joy ride, Albon skidded and drove his car into a wall in practice Friday, ending a day that got off to good start.\n\n\"I just went a bit wide on the curbs and lost the rear. Once these cars snap, they snap quickly and that was that,\" Albon said. \"It was a silly mistake and I paid the price.\"\n\nAnd not the kind he wants to be making with his team future in the balance.\n\nThe Formula One rookie has been impressive since his promotion from Red Bull's junior team, Toro Rosso, to replace the demoted Pierre Gasly. And while Verstappen has twice had to retire from races after engine trouble and a collision, Albon has been steady and earned 48 points to Verstappen's 31 over the last five races.\n\nRed Bull driver Alexander Albon, of Thailand, stands in the pit lane during the second training session of the Formula One Mexico Grand Prix auto race at the Hermanos Rodriguez racetrack in Mexico City, Friday, Oct. 25, 2019.

He is just the second Thai racer in F1 following Prince Bira, a member of the Thai Royal Family who raced in the early '50s.\n\nHe has four races left to keep impressing Horner and pave the way for what he hopes will be a more \"extravagant\" lifestyle out from under his parents' roof near the Red Bull factory.\n\n\"I would definitely like to go to London,\" Albon told the British Press Association earlier this week . \"I have been thinking about it, but, again, it is about money.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "MEXICO CITY (AP) - If Alex Albon still needs to do more to impress Red Bull into signing him for 2020, he'll want a better finish than his start at the...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/08/wire-20209544-1572074604-470_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
