The Companies Act 2006 states: \u201cA company must at all times have a registered office to which all communications and notices may be addressed.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sign outside the registered address for Hacker House on Thursday. Photograph: Simon Murphy/The Guardian\n\nRegus\u2019s website says clients can pay for a virtual office in Fleet Street for \u00a3178 a month, enabling them to have a \u201cprestigious business address\u201d. It states: \u201cUse the address on your company documents, website, business cards or web listings. We will handle your incoming mail which you can collect for free or choose from a daily, weekly or monthly mail forwarding package for one simple additional monthly cost. Local phone number and live professional receptionist to answer your calls in your company\u2019s name.\u201d\n\nIt comes after Warman said in the Commons that the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) had done the \u201cusual due diligence\u201d on Hacker House, adding that it had \u201ca British phone number\u201d. But when the Guardian rang the UK number on Wednesday it got through to a woman who said she was based in the US.\n\nArcuri\u2019s husband and co-director, Matthew Hickey, claimed on Twitter that the company employed \u201cseveral British people\u201d, adding: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing improper about it and we have been regularly updating DCMS and working with UK government on its needs.\u201d\n\nCompanies House records state that Arcuri and Hickey are both directors of the company, which was set up in 2015. Hacker House, which offers cybersecurity training, states on its website: \u201cTaught by world-renowned ethical hackers, our students are plunged head-first into real world cyber-attack simulations and are assessed across a variety of practical assignments designed to cover every angle. In short, we teach students how to think, act and move like a hacker \u2013 and then outmanoeuvre them.\u201d\n\nBoris Johnson and the tech boss who called him 'Alex the Great' Read more\n\nIt is the latest twist in a brewing controversy over Johnson\u2019s involvement with Arcuri, 34, whose companies have been awarded more than \u00a3126,000 of public money.\n\nHer other business, Innotech, was handed more than \u00a326,000 of public funds while Johnson was London mayor, prompting questions over whether the company received preferential treatment because of her friendship with him. Arcuri was allowed to attend three overseas trade missions led by Johnson while he was mayor.\n\nIt has also emerged that in 2016 Arcuri admitted that Hacker House employed Lauri Love, who is wanted by US authorities for allegedly hacking into websites. Arcuri told Love\u2019s extradition hearing in 2016 that she met had him the previous year and that he worked for the company Thursday to Monday.\n\nJohnson has stonewalled repeated questions about his friendship with Arcuri, first revealed by a Sunday Times investigation.\n\nHacker House has been contacted for comment. Arcuri has previously said: \u201cAny grants received by my companies and any trade mission I joined were purely in respect of my role as a legitimate businesswoman.\u201d", "description": "Boris Johnson\u2019s friend\u2019s firm re-registers address with eligibility for grant under scrutiny", "authors": ["Simon Murphy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48f763575fd1b473e9a6b4ab448fe5abdd38d95f/0_1719_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ab5a5f4523c2bcd147a4ef3552c8318c", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
