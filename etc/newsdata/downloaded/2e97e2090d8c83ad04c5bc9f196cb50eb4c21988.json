The shortened version is this: Blizzard Entertainment, an American gaming company, punished a player from Hong Kong after he yelled out \u201cLiberate Hong Kong, revolution of our age!\u201d during a post-game live stream. The player, who goes by the handle Blitzchung, was suspended for a year and had his prize money seized. Blizzard did this because, just like the NBA, it is in business with China.\n\nBut the reaction from many players has been swift and furious. Vox\u2019s Zack Beauchamp, who is apparently a daily player of one of the company\u2019s games, suggested a boycott yesterday. He was not alone as similar suggestions were being made in various subreddits and on social media sites like Twitter.\n\nTuesday evening, game designer Mark Kern who worked on World of Warcraft for Blizzard announced he was joining the boycott because China\u2019s money was dictating \u201cAmerican values.\u201d Kern says he once received an offer for a $2 million dollar bribe if he would accept an investment from a Chinese company.\n\nThis hurts. But until Blizzard reverses their decision on @blitzchungHS I am giving up playing Classic WoW, which I helped make and helped convince Blizzard to relaunch. There will be no Mark of Kern guild after all. Let me explain why I am #BoycottBlizzard \u2014 Mark Kern (@Grummz) October 9, 2019\n\nI have watched China slowly take over as the dominant investing force in gaming and movies over the years. It\u2019s a shame US companies never believed as strongly as China and Asia in investing in games, but this allowed China to have unprecedented influence over our media. \u2014 Mark Kern (@Grummz) October 9, 2019\n\nI\u2019ve seen firsthand the corruption of Chinese gaming companies, and I was removed from a company I founded (after Blizzard) for refusing to take a 2 million dollar kickback bribe to take an investment from China. This is the first time I\u2019ve ever spoken pubically about it. \u2014 Mark Kern (@Grummz) October 9, 2019\n\nChinese companies tried to ruin my career with planted press stories. Money is often paid for favorable press in China and some of that money flows here to the US as well. Unfortunately, money talks. China has succeeded in infiltrating all levels of tech, gaming and more. \u2014 Mark Kern (@Grummz) October 9, 2019\n\nBut now we are in a situation where unlimited Communist money dictates our American values. We censor our games for China, we censor our movies for China. Now, game companies are silencing voices for freedom and democracy. China is dictating that the world be authoritarian. \u2014 Mark Kern (@Grummz) October 9, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to keep politics out of games, which I am still a proponent of doing. It\u2019s another to unfairly and harshly punish voices that speak out against corruption, against abuses of human rights, and freedom. \u2014 Mark Kern (@Grummz) October 9, 2019\n\nBut enough is enough. I stand with Hong Kong, and I oppose Blizzard\u2019s obvious and laughably transparent fear of China. It\u2019s time for Blizzard to grow the spine it used to have, and to do what\u2019s right for gamers once again. Gamers, rise up. \u2014 Mark Kern (@Grummz) October 9, 2019\n\nIn addition to Kern, at least two Senators have weighed in:\n\nBlizzard shows it is willing to humiliate itself to please the Chinese Communist Party. No American company should censor calls for freedom to make a quick buck. https://t.co/rJBeXUiwYS \u2014 Ron Wyden (@RonWyden) October 8, 2019\n\nRecognize what\u2019s happening here. People who don\u2019t live in #China must either self censor or face dismissal & suspensions. China using access to market as leverage to crush free speech globally. Implications of this will be felt long after everyone in U.S. politics today is gone. https://t.co/Cx3tkWc7r6 \u2014 Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) October 8, 2019\n\nBut there are lots of regular people who are mocking the company with memes like this one featuring Blizzard\u2019s logo superimposed on the Chinese flag:\n\nLove the new Blizzard logo.#BoycottBlizzard\n\nFrom: Mashmalo on Reddit pic.twitter.com/Pms2ok39Lq \u2014 Angelo Kingston (@Angelo_Kingston) October 8, 2019\n\nThis mock game card reads, \u201cSilence any minions who oppose you and take their prize money.\u201d\n\nOthers are just posting screenshots showing they\u2019ve removed Blizzard\u2019s games from their computers:\n\nFinally, some American University students held up a sign saying \u201cFree Hong Kong/Boycott Blizz\u201d at the end of a live stream yesterday. Watch the camera in the bottom left:\n\nGiven all of the polling that shows younger people increasingly support socialism, it\u2019s refreshing to see some young people who still get that appeasement of communist China should not be tolerated. The pushback is getting a lot of coverage, including at major papers like the NY Times, but so far Blizzard has not offered a comment about any of it. Maybe they\u2019re hoping this will blow over? I sincerely hope they\u2019re wrong.", "description": "\"China is dictating that the world be authoritarian.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Blizzard.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
