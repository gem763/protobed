Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) no matter how much the millennials love vinyl. It was an incoherent, rambling illumination of the key knock on Biden: He\u2019s too old. Former housing and urban development secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, during the debate, and Sen. Cory Booker, afterward, made this argument, first indirectly, then directly, but they didn\u2019t need to. Biden indicted himself on the age question.\n\nIf President Trump abandons \u201cSleepy Joe\u201d for \u201cRecordPlayerJoeBiden\u201d on Twitter, the tattoo on Biden that is probably already permanent gets inked in bright colors. Manhattan-Beltway media may scoff at the single-phrase branding, but every marketer knows it works and works and works.\n\n\u201cRecord player\u201d is like Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s campaign-killing knockdown of Sen. Marco Rubio at a New Hampshire debate. \u201cThere it is. There it is,\u201d declared Christie onstage. \u201cThe memorized 25-second speech. There it is, everybody.\u201d Rubio and his supporters gamely tried for days to argue that what Christie said didn\u2019t matter. It did. It was over for the Florida Republican. A campaign-slashing branding of \u201crobotic\u201d stuck.
