(Pictures: Megan Barton-Hanson/Instagram)\n\nThe first affirmed: \u20182020 is in 3 months: we\u2019re having good sex with people who deserve us, staying hydrated, leaving behind toxic relationships, communicating our feelings, not letting anyone waste our time, and spoiling ourselves with love!\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the second said: \u2018Don\u2019t forget to hydrate, meditate, masturbate\u2019.\n\nAnd the third (quite rightly!) proclaimed: \u2018Reminder: Relationships are supposed to make you feel good.\u2019\n\nChelcee then also posted a series of stories to her Instagram account that could also point to a split between the two.\n\nOne poem from Arch Hades read: \u2018Instead of standing by my side, you tricked me into conceding. Into dimming my own light, feeling guilty for succeeding.\u2019\n\nShe also posted words of encouragement to \u2018anyone who needs it\u2019: \u2018Don\u2019t forget who you are.\u2019\n\nMegan went public with her relationship with Chelcee last month and Chelcee called her \u2018the perfect girl\u2019.\n\nOn Instagram stories, Megan wrote: \u2018SO proud to call this absolute babe my GIRLFRIEND.
