Tokio Marine, the world's fourth-largest property-and-casualty insurer by revenue, has pushed into both emerging markets and the United States.\n\n\"The U.S. market is huge and it is expected to grow steadily,\" Tokio Marine Chief Executive Satoru Komiya told a news conference. \"Also, the market is transparent.\"\n\nBut he acknowledged that the $3.1 billion price, at 33-times Pure Group's forecast profit for 2020, was \"not cheap\".\n\n\"We are paying for Pure's big potential growth,\" he said.\n\nThe deal, to be financed through cash on hand and external funding, is expected to close during the first quarter of 2020 and Tokio Marine will keep Pure Group's current management in place, Tokio Marine said in a statement.\n\nPure Group provides property-and-casualty insurance to high net-worth individuals across the United States and has become one of the top three players in that market since its founding in 2006, Tokio Marine said.\n\nREVENUE AND RISK\n\nOverseas acquisitions allow insurers to diversify their revenue and risk, so that a natural disaster hitting one region could be offset by profits from elsewhere.\n\nTokio Marine bought U.S. speciality insurer HCC Insurance Holdings for $7.5 billion in 2015. It paid $2.7 billion in 2011 for Delphi Financial and bought Philadelphia Consolidated for $4.7 billion in 2008.\n\nThe high net-worth insurance market is one of the few insurance businesses seeing strong growth in the United States, Tokio Marine said, as growth in the number of wealthy individuals outpaces that of the overall population.\n\nPure has achieved a compound annual growth rate of around 30% in the last five years and reached around $1 billion in managed premiums in 2018.\n\nTokio Marine is valued at $38 billion and brings in $45 billion a year in revenue, according to Refinitiv data.\n\nShares of the insurer ended 1.8% lower after the newspaper earlier reported the news.", "description": "Tokio Marine to buy U.S. insurer Pure Group for about $3 billion", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF920JW_L.jpg"}
