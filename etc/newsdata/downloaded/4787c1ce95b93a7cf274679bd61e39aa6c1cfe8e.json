Experts say probably not.", "language": "en", "text": "While the Democratic presidential debate was underway on Thursday, President Trump was behind a pulpit of his own, addressing House Republicans at a policy retreat in Baltimore. In between bashing the Democratic candidates in Houston and running through a list of what he considered GOP triumphs, Trump said that energy-saving lightbulbs \u2014 which his administration has tried to block \u2014 make him look orange.\n\nHis exact remarks, delivered during a nearly 70-minute opening address:\n\n\u201cThe lightbulb. People said what\u2019s with the lightbulb? I said here\u2019s the story. And I looked at it, the bulb that we\u2019re being forced to use, number one to me, most importantly, the light\u2019s no good. I always look orange. And so do you. The light is the worst.\u201d\n\nThe comment drew laughs from the audience, though it was not immediately clear whether the president meant it in jest or in earnest. The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nTrump\u2019s characteristic golden hue has spawned a range of derisive nicknames, from the oft-used \u201cPresident Cheeto\u201d to Dana Carvey\u2019s more obscure \u201cTangerine Tornado\u201d on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d The president has reportedly complained that his complexion appears too yellow on screen, though, according to professional photographers and makeup artists, energy-saving lightbulbs are probably not to blame.\n\nIt is true that bulbs have different light temperatures, but the effect this has on someone\u2019s complexion is typically not very significant, said Jocelyn Augustino, a D.C.-based freelance photographer.\n\n\u201cWhen you go into a family\u2019s house, just because there are tungsten lights, I don\u2019t think you look around the room and think everyone looks orange,\u201d she said.\n\nIn situations where the president is being photographed or filmed, professional photographers will know to adjust the white balance so that it is accurate to what is being seen in person, she added. \u201cIt\u2019s video or photo 101.\u201d\n\nTamzin Smith, a portrait photographer in Rockville, Md., pointed out that Trump\u2019s orange complexion is visible even when he is photographed against white backgrounds. If bulbs were responsible for casting a warm glow, anything white in a photo of the president \u2014 including the background, a white shirt, or even his teeth \u2014 should also be orange.\n\n\u201cYou can see that even when his teeth are white, his skin is orangey-red,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not the lighting.\u201d\n\n\n\nTrump bared his teeth in a wide smile during a meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month. (Andrew Harnik/AP)\n\nThe president\u2019s skin tone, said makeup artist Jason Kelly, is more likely the result of artificial tanning and an overapplication of bronzer, a type of powder or cream designed to give a tanned look.\n\nKelly, 45, was the official makeup artist for the Republican National Convention held in Cleveland in 2016. When then-candidate Trump came into the makeup room, he already had his hair and makeup done, Kelly said, and was sporting a thick layer of bronzer. Kelly applied a layer of loose powder on Trump, but according to the makeup artist, Trump \u201ccame in, and he said he thinks he already looks pretty good.\u201d\n\nAccording to the New York Times, aides close to the president have reported similar experiences: Trump tends to prefer to do his makeup in private.\n\nKelly said it is generally recognized among makeup artists that Trump\u2019s application of bronzer is atypical. \u201cWhen I see him, I see a line of oxidized bronzer around his hairline,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cThe application is like a kindergartner did it.\n\n\u201cBronzer shouldn\u2019t be applied from forehead to chin. It\u2019s meant to contour the face,\u201d he continued. \u201cPutting it all over is just going to make you go orange.\u201d\n\nAugustino, who has photographed the president in person, said Trump \u201calways looks somewhat tan.\u201d His warm skin tone, she added, may also be brought out by his golden-brown hair.\n\n\u201cWhatever color you have around the face is going to give you a little cast,\u201d she said.\n\nWhether the president uses an artificial tanner is a much-debated mystery. Kelly has said that he does, but according to sources who spoke to the Times, no tanning bed or booth exists anywhere in the White House. Some facilities owned by Trump, such as the Trump National Golf Club in Charlotte, offer spray-tanning services.\n\nOn previous occasions, the president\u2019s distinctive complexion has been framed by his aides as a sign of health. In a Times article that ran in the deep of winter this year, a senior administration official said that Trump\u2019s orange skin tone was the result of \u201cgood genes.\u201d", "description": "\u201cYou can see that even when his teeth are white, his skin is orangey-red,\u201d a professional photographer said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not the lighting.\u201d", "authors": ["Rebecca Tan", "Local Reporter", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Rp6WZJYf3_aqlGIoE6RNkZGPBGA=/1484x0/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/thumbnails/5d7bbf4ccff47e0009327651/2019-09-13T155926Z_1_OVAWHY673_RTRMADC_0_USA-TRUMP-LIGHTBULBS-ROUGH-CUT.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
