I hope you can import or buy from an independent bookseller, and avoid outlets that yield to these kinds of intimidation tactics,\" Farrow wrote.\n\nThe UK's Guardian newspaper reported on Tuesday that the book was withdrawn from sale from Booktopia, and that those who had ordered were told that it had been \"withdrawn from sale.\"\n\nFarrow told Business Insider that \"the book in a lot of ways is a testament to the importance of institutions that stand by their reporters in the face of those kinds of campaigns.\"\n\n\"And Little Brown and Hachette, the wonderful publisher of 'Catch and Kill,' has been incredible in standing by this book in the face of a number of concerted campaigns from a number of powerful interests that includes the National Enquirer and Dylan Howard,\" Farrow continued.\n\nAustralia has strict defamation laws. Anyone being sued for defamation there must prove that they did not damage the claimant's reputation, in comparison to in the US where that burden falls on the party suing.", "description": "Ronan Farrow said 'Catch and Kill,' which alleges efforts to stop reporting on the Weinstein scandal, was \"banned\" on several platforms in Australia.", "authors": ["Sin\u00e9ad Baker", "Ashley Collman"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da7086e4af909084e0fbea3?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
