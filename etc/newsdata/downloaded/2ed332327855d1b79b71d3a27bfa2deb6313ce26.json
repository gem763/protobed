Some viewed the excess as a sign of weak corporate governance.\n\nEarlier this week, Newmann was forced out as CEO and put in a nonexecutive role at the company amid reports that investors, including SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, the company's largest, became concerned about his controlling shares of the company.\n\nHis ouster was first reported by The Wall Street Journal who also noted additional concerns over personal issues such as drug use and eccentric behavior.\n\nFOX Business' inquiries to WeWork were not returned at the time of publication.\n\nLate Thursday, the Wall Street Journal also reported that company insiders tied to Neumann will likely be ousted or re-assigned.\n\nNeumann cashed out on a reported $700 million in stock options before the IPO, which is an uncommon move for someone with a startup going public. Founders usually sit on those options until after the IPO goes alive if they expect their company\u2019s stock value to increase.\n\nWeWork was at one point privately valued at $47 billion, a number that presidential candidate Andrew Yang called \u201cutterly ridiculous\u201d last month, despite posting losses of over $3 billion since 2016.\n\nThe estimated valuation was lowered twice, all the way down to $10 billion, before the IPO was indefinitely postponed on Sept. 16.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nRelated Articles", "description": "The embattled WeWork executive loses his corporate jet.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
