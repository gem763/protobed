Axel Schmidt/Pool via Reuters\n\nThe disagreements between the environment, finance, economy and transport ministries could further erode the credibility of Merkel\u2019s right-left coalition, weakened by regional election losses and infighting and up for review by the end of the year.\n\nA government spokesman, however, appeared to downplay the risk that there would be no deal and said the cabinet would approve the final details next Wednesday.\n\nThe ministries have been unable to agree on the scale of measures to cut emissions of the greenhouse gases responsible for global warming.\n\nThese are due to include raising car and air traffic taxes as well as increasing a road toll for trucks from 2023, the sources, who were briefed on the talks, told Reuters.\n\nThe ministries are also at odds on how many tonnes of CO2 each of those measures will shave off Germany\u2019s total emissions.\n\nMerkel\u2019s conservatives and their Social Democrat (SPD) coalition partners last month agreed an outline for the climate package without taking on new debt to fund the measures, although environmental groups said it did not go far enough.\n\nAsked about the disagreement among the ministries, the\n\ngovernment spokesman said: \u201cThe agreed details of the comprehensive and already agreed climate protection program will be passed by the cabinet next week.\u201d\n\nThe government had originally wanted the details to be presented to cabinet on Wednesday. The delay means there are only 10 days left for the government to sign the package off in time to get it through parliament before the end of the year.\n\n\u2018TURF WARS\u2019\n\nSources in the SPD told Reuters that the transport ministry had asked for more time to process the proposals.\n\nThe ministry is controlled by the Christian Social Union (CSU), the Bavaria-based sister party of Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats (CDU). Both those parties and the SPD are accused by environmental activists of putting the interests of the car industry first and shielding it from tougher emissions rules.\n\n\u201cThe clock is ticking,\u201d said SPD lawmaker Matthias Miersch. \u201cEveryone in the government has to understand that the time of turf wars and power struggles is over.\u201d\n\nFILE PHOTO: Students take part in the Global Climate Strike of the Fridays for Future movement in Berlin, Germany, September 20, 2019. REUTERS/Christian Mang\n\nClimate experts and opposition parties, including the Greens and the radical Left Party have ridiculed the measures as a \u201csham\u201d and a \u201cbluff package\u201d.\n\nAt the center of their outrage is a decision to introduce a carbon dioxide price of 10 euros a ton for transport and heating in buildings from 2021 and gradually increase it to 35 euros in 2025.\n\nEconomists and activists had hoped for a starting price of at least 40 euros and point to Switzerland where that price is about 90 euros for heating with fossils.", "description": "German ministries have failed to agree on a set of climate protection measures, government sources said on Wednesday, leaving little time to fulfill Chancellor Angela Merkel's plan to pass the landmark package this year.", "authors": ["Markus Wacket", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436206582&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF910KW"}
