GVA, -31.08% plunged 33% toward a 7-year low in morning trading, putting them on track for the biggest one-day selloff since the construction materials company went public in April 1990, after earnings missed expectations for a sixth-straight quarter. The stock was also the biggest decliner listed on major U.S. exchanges. Before the open, the Granite reported net income that fell to $20.5 million, or 43 cents a share, from $55.7 million, or $1.17 a share, in the year-ago period, well below the FactSet EPS consensus for a rise to $1.37. The company said ongoing disputes from the Heavy Civil business had a \"distorted impact\" on cash flow and earnings. Revenue rose 3.1% to $1.09 billion, but missed the FactSet consensus of $1.16 billion, as strength in water and specialty revenue was offset by weakness in transportation and materials revenue. The company didn't provide guidance for the rest of the year, but said it expects 2020 revenue growth in the \"mid-single digit\" percentage range, while the current FactSet consensus of $3.85 billion implies 8.4% growth. The stock has shed 39% year to date, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.44% has gained 20%.", "description": "Shares of Granite Construction Inc. plunged 33% toward a 7-year low in morning trading, putting them on track for the biggest one-day selloff since the...", "authors": ["Tomi Kilgore", "Reporter"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
