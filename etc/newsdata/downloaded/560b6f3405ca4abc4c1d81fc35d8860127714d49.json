Except...", "language": "en", "text": "Bloomberg Law, however, is clinging to its interpretations. \u201cWe stand behind our reporting,\u201d noted a statement from David Peikin, director of corporate communications for Bloomberg Industry Group.\n\nHere\u2019s what happened: By his own account, Penn presented to the Labor Department a Facebook post from August 2016 in which Olson wrote about the outcome of a primary challenge to then-Rep. Paul D. Ryan. The challenger was Paul Nehlen, identified by Vox.com as a \u201cmini Trump\u201d and a white supremacist. Ryan destroyed Nehlen in the primary.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHere\u2019s the Facebook post in question, which makes clear Olson\u2019s contempt for the dark forces aligned with Nehlen (click to enlarge):\n\nThe tone of Olson\u2019s posting is asserted from the very top, confirmed by the reference to an \u201cemasculating 70-point victory\u201d and driven home by his faux-conspiracy chatter in the comments below. Yet Penn felt that the material merited a look from Olson\u2019s employer:\n\nTo Leif Olson's friends & others who take issue with this reporting,\n\nI sent a screenshot of a public FB post to DOL, seeking comment. 4 hours later I received this response: \u201cToday, the Department of Labor accepted the resignation of Leif Olson effective immediately.\u201d https://t.co/PZbIScDHqe \u2014 Ben Penn (@benjaminpenn) September 3, 2019\n\nAs Penn\u2019s story notes, the 43-year-old Olson started at Labor on Aug. 12 and was cleared by the White House. \u201cHe was part of a team of political appointees working to finish a series of deregulatory actions that are pivotal to the White House employment agenda,\u201d notes Penn. \u201cThey include rules that would narrow corporations\u2019 shared liability with affiliated companies and clarify time-and-a-half overtime pay calculations.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHere\u2019s the exchange that apparently prompted Bloomberg Law\u2019s inquiry to the Labor Department, as abridged by Penn:\n\nOlson\u2019s initial post about Ryan prompted another Facebook user to reply, \u201cHe\u2019s a neo-con, too, you know.\u201d Olson replied, \u201cNo he\u2019s not. Neo-cons are all Upper East Side Zionists who don\u2019t golf on Saturday if you know what I mean.\u201d The same commenter then replied, \u201cThat\u2019s what I meant. He\u2019s a Jew. Everyone knows that.\u201d Olson at 12:46 a.m. Houston time wrote the following about the apparent Jewish faith of Ryan, an observant Catholic: \u201cIt must be true because I\u2019ve never seen the Lamestream Media report it, and you know they protect their own.\u201d A review of a decade of Olson\u2019s Facebook posts shows that he usually promotes his Christian faith and conservative views. The Paul Ryan exchange appears to be the only appeal to Jewish stereotypes.\n\nBolding inserted to highlight a needed edit: It\u2019s the only satirical, mocking appeal that denounces Jewish stereotypes. The Facebook excerpt in the Bloomberg Law article provides all the clues necessary to determine that Olson was joking, though additional messages in the thread furnish even greater substantiation.\n\nThe story quotes Olson himself as saying, \u201cIt was sarcastic criticism of the alt-right\u2019s conspiracy theories and anti-Semitic positions.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, it quotes Jake Hyman, a spokesman for the Anti-Defamation League (ADL): \u201cThe post in question is clearly anti-Semitic, and if it does indeed belong to Leif Olson of the U.S. Labor Department, we call on him to apologize and affirm that he no longer harbors such virulently hateful views.\u201d The Erik Wemple Blog checked with the ADL on Tuesday afternoon to see if it wished to revise its evaluation in light of social media\u2019s verdict on the Olson post. It did indeed. \u201cWe appreciate Mr. Olson\u2019s clarification that he intended to be sarcastic with his posts and accept his explanation of the content in question,\u201d said Hyman.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYet Bloomberg Law is sticking with its original formulation, including its reputation-damaging headline: \u201cTrump Labor Aide Quits After Anti-Semitic Facebook Posts Surface.\u201d Those posts aren\u2019t anti-Semitic if they\u2019re written with satirical anti-anti-Semitic sentiment. Here are other segments of the story that require correction or retraction in light of Olson\u2019s tone:\n\nA recently appointed Trump Labor Department official with a history of advancing controversial conservative and faith-based causes in court has resigned after revelations that he wrote a 2016 Facebook post suggesting the Jewish-controlled media \u201cprotects their own.\u201d\n\nAnd:\n\nOlson, an unsuccessful GOP candidate in 2012 for a Texas district court judgeship, fired off a series of late-night posts on his personal Facebook page three years ago that started as a sarcastic quip about former House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s blowout primary victory. They then devolved into an exchange referencing two anti-Semitic tropes: that Jews control the media and that they look out for members of their own faith.\n\nHere, Penn appears to be drawing a line between sarcasm about Ryan\u2019s primary victory and allegedly straight-faced comments about Jewish control of the media. The Erik Wemple Blog espies no such separation.\n\nThe article includes six paragraphs about Trump White House troubles with vetting staffers. But backstory on vetting failures doesn\u2019t belong in a story that reveals no vetting failure.\n\nAD\n\nBloomberg Law sees no problem within the four corners of its story. \u201cWe contacted the White House and the Department of Labor asking for comment on Mr. Olson\u2019s Facebook posts. Within four hours, the Department of Labor responded that Mr. Olson had resigned,\u201d noted Peikin. We won\u2019t dispute that sequence. Clearly more needs to be revealed about the events leading to Olson\u2019s resignation, which may or may not have been forced by the Bloomberg Law request.\n\nThose circumstances notwithstanding, the story continues to characterize Olson\u2019s post as containing anti-Semitic material. That\u2019s true only if you willfully ignore the tone and intent of the post. Retraction time.\n\nThe Trumpification of Bloomberg: Never apologize, even when literally everyone knows you\u2019re wrong https://t.co/ujLDOQTm9T \u2014 Allahpundit (@allahpundit) September 3, 2019\n\nAD", "description": "Leif Olson resigns following an inquiry by a Bloomberg Law reporter.
