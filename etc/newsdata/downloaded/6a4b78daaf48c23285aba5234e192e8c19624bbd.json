They said her walkout was unbecoming and her push toward impeaching Mr. Trump is poisoning government at the highest levels.\n\nThe White House canceled a classified briefing for Congress scheduled for later this week that was intended to give lawmakers inside information on Syria. That fueled Democrats\u2019 complaints that Mr. Trump is trying to shut them out of a role in his decision-making.\n\nMr. Trump signaled that he won\u2019t be bullied into changing, saying Syria is \u201cnot our problem\u201d \u2014 though he did try to cajole Turkey to pull back from its invasion of a Kurdish region in Syria, a move that has led to chaos on the ground.\n\nThe House voted 354-60 to condemn the president\u2019s surprise decision last week to withdraw U.S. forces. All Democrats and a majority of Republicans voted in favor of the rebuke, saying the president has squandered years of goodwill and U.S. credibility.\n\nSEE ALSO: Democrats looking to keep Syria and impeachment separate ahead of condemnation vote\n\n\u201cHow can America be trusted to keep its word when we make impulsive decisions that have an immediate and catastrophic impact on millions of people?\u201d said Rep. Eliot L. Engel, New York Democrat and chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.\n\nYet the rebuke is just words, and Republican leaders said that other than slapping more sanctions on Turkey, there is not a lot Congress can do to insert itself into the situation. Forcing Mr. Trump to reverse himself is unlikely.\n\n\u201cI mean, what tools do we have?\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, asked reporters who peppered him with questions. \u201cAny president has a lot of latitude in deploying troops.\u201d\n\nMr. McConnell repeatedly called Mr. Trump\u2019s decision \u201ca mistake,\u201d marking some of the most serious criticisms he has aimed at Mr. Trump over the course of his presidency.\n\nBut he seemed pessimistic that more congressional chiding along the lines of the House\u2019s anti-Trump broadside would change the president\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have been done, and [I\u2019m] hoping that he would reverse course. There seems to be no evidence of it so far, but I think it was a mistake,\u201d Mr. McConnell said.\n\nU.S. lawmakers say Mr. Trump\u2019s decision is a betrayal of the Kurds, who now find themselves battling Turkey in a fight that pits two U.S. allies against each other. Mr. Trump\u2019s critics say the U.S. troops served as a buffer between the Kurds and Turkey and deterred Iranian and Russian mischief.\n\nNow those constraints are gone and the region has descended to violent chaos \u2014 including the danger that Islamic State fighters will escape confinement and return to terrorism.\n\n\u201cLeaving Northwest Syria does not resolve the problem that brought us there in the first place. It only creates more,\u201d said Rep. Michael T. McCaul, a Texas Republican who helped write the resolution rebuking Mr. Trump.\n\nVoting for the resolution were 225 House Democrats and 129 Republicans \u2014 more than double the 60 Republicans who voted \u201cno.\u201d House Republicans\u2019 top leaders voted for the rebuke.\n\nDemocratic congressional leaders said they hoped that high tally would persuade Mr. Trump to do an about-face. Instead, they walked out of an afternoon meeting when the president lashed out.\n\n\u201cThis was not a dialogue,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat, calling it a \u201cdiatribe.\u201d\n\nRepublicans who emerged from the White House said Democrats were the ones who behaved poorly.\n\nIf Mrs. Pelosi had stayed instead of storming out, then she would have been part of a productive meeting in which generals outlined plans to keep a small residual force in Syria to protect U.S. interests, said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, California Republican.\n\nMr. Trump renewed his feud with sometime ally Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who has called the president\u2019s decision \u201cthe biggest mistake of his presidency.\u201d\n\nHe said Mr. Graham, a frequent golfing buddy, should stop giving him advice and stick to approving his judges and investigating whether President Obama tried to spoil his chances during the 2016 campaign.\n\nMr. Graham, who is working on a bill to slap sanctions on Turkey, said he \u201cwon\u2019t be quiet\u201d about national security.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, chair of the House Republican Conference, announced similar legislation in the lower chamber.\n\nHer bill personally targets Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and demands that the administration figure out his net worth and report the figure to Congress. Her bill would also block key Turkish officials from entering the U.S. and deny American military assistance to the country.\n\nDespite his defiance, Mr. Trump has made some concessions, including agreeing to leave a small force in Syria.\n\nHe also is working on persuading Mr. Erdogan to curtail his attack on the Kurds. He is deploying Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to talk with the Turkish leader on Thursday.\n\nA letter Mr. Trump wrote last week to Mr. Erdogan also surfaced Wednesday and showed the U.S. leader badgering his counterpart.\n\n\u201cHistory will look upon you favorably if you get this done the right and humane way,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIt will look upon you forever as the devil if good things don\u2019t happen. Don\u2019t be a tough guy. Don\u2019t be a fool!\u201d\n\n\u2981 Stephen Dinan contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
