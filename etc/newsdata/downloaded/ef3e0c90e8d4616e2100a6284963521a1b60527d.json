The seals can feed on more than 120 species of fish in the Thames, including salmon, two species of shark, short-snouted seahorses and the European eel, which is critically endangered. Other marine mammals spotted in the Thames include porpoises, dolphins and \u201cBenny\u201d the beluga whale.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A seal pup in the Thames Estuary.

Harbour seal pups can swim within hours of birth, which means they are well adapted to grow up in tidal estuaries, like the Thames. By the time the tide comes in they can swim away on it. Grey seals, on the other hand, take longer to be comfortable in the water, so breed elsewhere and come to the Thames later to feed.\u201d\n\nZSL has conducted Thames seal population estimates annually since 2013. The most recent results, from 2017, recorded 1,104 harbour seals and 2,406 grey seals across the estuary.\n\nThe surveys show that seal numbers are rising but it is not yet known if this is due to resident seals having pups or adults moving in from other areas.\n\nThe seal pup survey, which was undertaken in 2018, aims to help ZSL researchers better understand the causes of changes in the Thames seal population.", "description": "Scientists\u2019 analysis reveals English river\u2019s ecosystem is thriving", "authors": ["Patrick Barkham"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1b57b9bed4b4796a894c829ab848e18d0f335e8/943_866_4421_2652/master/4421.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=46d5222062d4ff6d0a89995628e3faaf"}
