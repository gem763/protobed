So I would work with the other opposition parties, as we have up to now.\"\n\nAsked if Speaker John Bercow should resume parliamentary sittings immediately if the Supreme Court rules against the government, Mr Corbyn said: \"The Commons should be recalled if that is what the Supreme Court decides. I hope we're in that position because I want this parliament, our parliament, to be able to question the government.\"", "description": "Foreign secretary Dominic Raab has twice refused to rule out suspending parliament for a second time if the Supreme Court rules against the government next week.", "authors": ["Andrew Woodcock"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/07/29/20/raab-foreign-sec.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
