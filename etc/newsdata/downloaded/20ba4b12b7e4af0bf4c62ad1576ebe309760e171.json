Many were waving American flags.\n\nBut the atmosphere turned tense as dozens of radical anti-government protesters later took over main roads, setting up barricades to block traffic and confronting riot police.\n\nStudents plan rally at HKU against alleged police brutality\n\nAt one point, police pointed their guns in the direction of demonstrators, demanding they disperse, while protesters responded by aiming laser pointers at officers. At least one black-clad man was seen being subdued by police inside Central MTR station. At 10pm, the MTR Corporation announced the temporary suspension of Airport Express services because of incidents in Central.\n\nAround 10.30pm, riot police took dispersal action and subdued at least one protester near the GPO building.\n\nThe rally was the first to have secured a police go-ahead after the newly imposed anti-mask law \u2013 a measure to quell the worsening violent protests in recent months \u2013 took effect on October 5.\n\n\n\nOrganisers warned participants in advance of the possible legal risks they faced if they breached the tough law. And the crowd, comprising of mainly young people, largely took no chances, with only a handful wearing surgical masks. The organisers, Rally for Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act Organising Committee, said 130,000 people attended. They had expected a turnout of about 2,000. Police put the figure at 25,000 at the peak of the rally. Contrary to the violence over the weekend that saw mobs assaulting protesters and hurling petrol bombs at police stations and MTR stations, in general protesters attending Monday\u2019s rally took a more festive approach.\n\nPro-democracy activists like Joshua Wong have travelled to the US to speak about the ongoing unrest in Hong Kong, such as when he spoke before congress with Nancy Pelosi.

They cheered for the US \u2013 as a \u201cprotector of freedom\u201d and \u201cregulator of world order\u201d \u2013 to pass tougher laws against Hong Kong.\n\nActivists and opposition lawmakers, including Joshua Wong Chi-fung and Civic Party\u2019s Dennis Kwok, took to the stage to address the crowds.\n\nWong said: \u201cWe hope other US allies will follow suit and make laws to sanction Hong Kong officials for suppressing democracy here.\u201d\n\nA guide to the key players in the Hong Kong protests\n\nA spokesman for the organiser said: \u201cOur rally is to urge US congressmen to pass the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. We also want to show them our stance on freedom.\n\n\u201cResistance has become a part of Hong Kong\u2019s daily life. Hongkongers are not afraid and will continue to come out to fight for our rights and freedoms.\u201d\n\nThe rally concluded after two hours, with participants singing the US national anthem, The Star-Spangled Banner .\n\nThe bill was expected to be put to vote as soon as Wednesday morning in Hong Kong. If the bill is passed in the lower house, it will need to pass the senate and then be signed by US President Donald Trump to become law. The act could pave the way for diplomatic action and economic sanctions against the city\u2019s government.\n\nAmong other things, the act also seeks to allow those who have taken part in pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong to get travel visas to the US despite \u201cadverse government action\u201d against them, including arrest and detention.\n\nIn a statement, a Hong Kong government spokesman expressed regret over the assembly.\n\n\u201cSince the return to the motherland, the [Hong Kong government] has been exercising \u2018Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong\u2019 and a high degree of autonomy in strict accordance with the Basic Law,\u201d the spokesman said.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 principle has been fully and successfully implemented. Human rights and freedoms in Hong Kong are fully protected by the Basic Law, the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance and other legislation. The [Hong Kong government] attaches great importance to them and is determined to safeguard them.\u201d", "description": "The mostly peaceful rally, which drew out tens of thousands of people, was the first to secure police approval since the mask ban came into effect.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/cceefc2a-ee7f-11e9-9f3d-785f2d889e39imagehires072720.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
