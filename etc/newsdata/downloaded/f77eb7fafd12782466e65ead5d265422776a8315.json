There are very few people \u2014 the head of the Treasury, the head of the IRS \u2014 who have access.\"\n\nThe chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Rep. Richard Neal, wrote that he received a credible complaint from a whistleblower at the end of July. The panel is currently trying to obtain six years worth of Trump's tax returns.\n\nThe president has repeatedly refused to release them, claiming they're under audit, even though there's no rule that says that individuals cannot disclose their returns on the basis of an audit.\n\nNot much is known about the process of auditing a president. Rules governing it were tightened after President Richard Nixon was accused of influencing the process.\n\n\"One of the things that came out of Watergate was that he and his office had tried to use the IRS to go after political enemies,\" Patrick Cotter, a former federal prosecutor who was part of the team that convicted the Gambino crime family boss John Gotti, told Insider.\n\nIn the wake of the scandal, Congress enacted a law making it a crime for any member of the executive branch to cause or terminate an IRS audit.\n\nBecause presidential candidates have voluntarily released records in the past several decades, the executive audit process has received little attention since Nixon.\n\nBut Neal argued in his filing that the existing guidelines are insufficient because of the vast powers of the presidency and that the president's tax records therefore need congressional oversight.\n\nIf Neal's demand is granted, he'll be given access to the president's tax records, which opponents believe could expose wrongdoing by Trump.\n\nThe Treasury Department has so far blocked Neal's request, arguing that the Massachusetts Democrat isn't seeking oversight for sound reasons, but in an effort to damage the president's reputation.\n\nTrump has been at the center of several financial scandals. The New York Times reported last year that Trump used a series of dubious tax schemes to shield a $400 million inheritance from the IRS.\n\nAnd in September, Mother Jones published an investigation that found Trump might have fabricated a loan to avoid paying $50 million in income taxes.\n\nThe president has denied involvement in any financial wrongdoing.\n\nTrump is also at the center of another whistleblower's complaint from a US intelligence official who alleges that he used a July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president to repeatedly pressure him to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son. The complaint sparked a formal House impeachment inquiry into Trump last week.", "description": "There are very few government officials who have access to the president's and vice president's tax returns.", "authors": ["Sonam Sheth", "Tom Porter"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d93d3972e22af4ac42ec6e1?width=1200&format=jpeg"}
