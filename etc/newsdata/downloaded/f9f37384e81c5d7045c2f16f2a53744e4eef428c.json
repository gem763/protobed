Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan and other U.S. officials also are participating in the trip.\n\nOrganizers expect 40 Colombian women to benefit from the academy initially.\n\n\u201cWe need women taking active part in all the roles of leadership,\u201d said Ms. Ramirez, the nation\u2019s first female vice president. \u201cThe world needs women partaking in the world economy\u2026including in sectors traditionally led by men.\u201d\n\nMs. Trump also visited police cadets at the General Santander Police Academy, where 22 cadets were killed in a terror attack earlier this year. Six of the victims had received U.S. government scholarships.\n\nThe country struck a peace deal with rebels in 2016 after decades of conflict, but several former commanders of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia [FARC] rebels announced last week that they would rearm.\n\nThe Inter-American Development Bank Group and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation have announced the creation of the first gender-focused fund for Latin America and the Caribbean. Ms. Trump revealed Tuesday that three funds combined for the program will total about $600 million, tripling the initial target.\n\nThe program is aimed at reducing the gender gap for financing in Latin America and the Caribbean by supporting women-owned businesses, female entrepreneurs, and firms that generate jobs or consumer products for women.\n\n\u2022 This story is based in part on wire service reports.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
