It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve driven a Lexus so I was taken aback by the huge size of the RX.\n\nBut it\u2019s taking on big-boned rivals such as the Audi Q7 and Volvo XC90, so size does matter.\n\nThe five-seater RX F-Sport Ray drove on 20-inch multi-spoke wheels accelerated from rest to 62mph in 7.7 seconds with a top speed of 124 mph \u2014 the seven seater is a little slower\n\nThere are three main trim levels from launch: RX with premium pack, F Sport and top range Takumi. It\u2019s initially available as a flexible five-seater or as a slightly longer seven seater.\n\nFrom early next year, customers will also be able to specify six stand-alone \u2018captain\u2019s chairs\u2019 \u2014two in each row. Prices range from \u00a352,705 up to \u00a362,605.\n\nThe RX certainly looks sharp. Loads of room inside, a commanding driving position and a premium dashboard.\n\nNow into its fifth generation, the first RX SUV was launched in 1998 and has sold 3 million worldwide since then\n\nIn a big nod to road safety, the top-of-the-range Takumi trim has a new BladeScan Adaptive High Beam system that gives 24m of extra vision at night to help spot potential hazards, but without blinding other drivers.\n\nPlenty of power too from the RX 450h\u2019s self-charging hybrid system, comprising a 259bhp 3.5 litre direct injection V6 petrol engine working in conjunction with two electric motors \u2014 front and back \u2014 which create total pulling power of 308 bhp, about the same as three Ford Fiestas.\n\nThe five-seater RX F-Sport I drove on 20-inch multi-spoke wheels accelerated from rest to 62mph in 7.7 seconds with a top speed of 124 mph \u2014 the seven seater is a little slower.\n\nThere are three main trim levels from launch: RX with premium pack, F Sport and top range Takumi. It\u2019s initially available as a flexible five-seater or as a slightly longer seven seater\n\nLike me, this well-padded SUV is built for comfort not for sporty performance. The sinews tighten up in Sport and Sport-plus modes which give it more engagement, especially on corners, but it\u2019s no sports car.\n\nIt will do up to 35.7mpg under the new \u2018real-world\u2019 tests with low CO2 emissions of 172g/km.\n\nLexus reckon that under average driving, around a third of the journey will be in electric-only zero-emissions mode.\n\nHowever, if you press the EV button to drive exclusively in electric-only mode, don\u2019t expect more than a couple of miles.\n\nVolvo launches its first electric car\n\n\u2018Do you want a car with a plug?\u2019 Volvo customers will be asked this from now on as the Swedish giant launches its first electric car, with a pledge to make zero-emissions battery-powered vehicles its priority over petrol for all future sales.\n\nThe new XC40 Recharge unveiled in Los Angeles is based on the award-winning XC40 small SUV, and marks the first in a family of fully electric Volvos.\n\nVolvo's radical electric push: From next year, dealers by default will assume customers want electric models when available. Buyers will need to specify if they want a petrol or hybrid\n\nOn sale in the UK next year, expect a price of about \u00a350,000 \u2014 with a \u00a33,500 taxpayer-funded subsidy for zero-emissions cars.\n\nVolvo wants all-electric cars to account for half its global sales by 2025, with the rest as petrol-electric hybrids.\n\nIt wants plug-in petrol-electric hybrid cars to make up 20 per cent of total sales next year (2020).\n\nA spokesman said: \u2018Future customers will need to answer a fundamental question: do you want a new Volvo with a plug or without?\u2019\n\nBentley makes a splash in Monaco\n\nIf I could \u2018break the bank\u2019 at Monte Carlo \u2014 with a win on roulette at the famous casino in Monaco \u2014 I\u2019d be tempted to splash out on arguably the finest modern Bentley ever made.\n\nPowerful and luxurious: The new Flying Spur is arguably the finest modern Bentley ever made\n\nI was one of the first to spend a day behind the wheel of the flagship Bentley Flying Spur after the Monaco launch.\n\nFirst deliveries to customers are due in February. Base prices start at \u00a3168,300, but the car \u2014 built in Crewe \u2014 I drove had \u00a337,125 of extras, totalling a hefty \u00a3205,425.\n\nPowered by a 6-litre twin-turbocharged W12 TSI petrol engine developing 635hp, the Flying Spur accelerates its 2.5 tonne mass from rest to 60mph in just 3.8 seconds.\n\nPowerful and luxurious, it\u2019s perfect for the Cary Grant and Grace Kelly de jour.", "description": "It's 30 years since Lexus was launched by the Japanese car giant Toyota.
