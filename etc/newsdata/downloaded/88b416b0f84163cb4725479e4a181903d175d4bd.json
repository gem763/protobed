She finished with 13 points, hitting 5 of her 6 shots and played 26 minutes.\n\n\u201cI just want to be a leader for this team. I love them. I did nothing, I was just on the court, they carried me and they\u2019ve done that all season long,\u201d Delle Donne said. \u201cI love them to death. We have one more to go.\u201d\n\nWashington Mystics forward Elena Delle Donne, right, drives to the basket against Connecticut Sun forward Alyssa Thomas (25) during the second half. (Photo: David Butler II, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThe 6-foot-5 wing was clearly limited in her movement and stayed mostly on the perimeter, but was effective enough to command the attention of Connecticut\u2019s defense.\n\n\u201cHer presence alone, whether she\u2019s 100% or 10% just instills confidence in the rest of the group,\u201d said guard Kristi Toliver. \u201cShe showed a lot of character. She showed a lot of heart just being out there on the court today.\u201d\n\nToliver, Emma Meesseman and Natasha Cloud carried the offense. Meesseman had 21 points off the bench, including nine to start the fourth quarter. Toliver added 20 points and 10 assists. Cloud chipped in with 19 points. The team made 16 of 27 shots from behind the arc.\n\nWashington will try and close out the series on Tuesday night in Connecticut.\n\nDelle Donne hit an early 3-pointer and the Mystics made six of their nine shots from behind the arc in the first quarter to take a 32-17 lead after 10 minutes.\n\nWashington led by as many as 17 points in the first half. It was 37-23 before the Sun went on a 16-4 run and Washington led 43-39 at the break.\n\nJonquel Jones converted a 3-point play to open the third quarter cut the lead to one, but that was as close as Connecticut would get.\n\nThey trailed by two when Delle Donne hit a 3-pointer from the left wing to make it 58-53. The Mystics took a 68-57 lead into the fourth quarter and stretched that to 18 before a final run by the Sun that Delle Donne ended with a tough layup.\n\n\u201cIt was kind of one of those moments, like hey I might give my back up and my body up on this one, but I feel like this is such a big moment to stop that run that they\u2019re making,\u201d she said.\n\nShekinna Stricklen and Jasmine Thomas each had 16 points for the Sun and Bria Holmes added 15. Jones, who scored 32 points and grabbed 18 rebounds in Connecticut\u2019s Game 2 win, scored just nine points to go with her nine boards.\n\n\u201cWhen the ball was up, they just didn\u2019t care if they were getting a rebound or not, they were making sure they were hitting me, keeping me off the offensive glass,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIt hurt us that I wasn\u2019t able to get on the boards.\u201d\n\nCOPING\n\nThe 6-foot-5 Delle Donne, who averaged 19.5 points and 8.2 rebounds this season, left Tuesday\u2019s 99-87 Game 2 loss without scoring a point after playing just over three minutes in the first quarter. There were a few scary moments for her on Sunday. She went down to her knees for a loose ball just over five minutes into the game, was subbed out and went straight to the tunnel. But she returned a few minutes later. The team said it was part of the plan to keep her back warm by having her keep moving and stretch with the trainers instead of sitting on the bench.\n\n\u201cI was just trying to find ways to stay comfortable and stay loose,\u201d she said. \u201cWe really didn\u2019t know if I was going to be able to go today, because I hadn\u2019t done anything until right up before the game. We were able to test it a little bit and go from there.\u201d\n\nFROM A DISTANCE\n\nThe Mystics tied a WNBA Finals record set by the 2007 Phoenix Mercury with 16 3-pointers in a single game. The team shot 50.7 percent from the floor and 59.3 percent from 3-point range.\n\nThe @WashMystics tie the #WNBAFinals record with 16 threes in the Game 3 win! \ud83d\udca5 pic.twitter.com/uGQcj7oKKn \u2014 WNBA (@WNBA) October 6, 2019\n\nREBOUNDS\n\nWashington outrebounded Connecticut 34-27 after being dominated on the boards, 41-27 in Game 2.\n\nTIP INS\n\nWashington: Delle Donne had had averaged 21.4 points and 7.6 rebounds in the Mystics\u2019 first five playoff games. She had scored at least 10 points in 23 straight playoff games before Tuesday.\n\nConnecticut: The Sun were 15-2 at home in the regular season and swept their two semi-final games here against Los Angeles. This was the first Finals game at the Mohegan Sun since they went to back-to-back in 2004 and 2005. That team was led by current Mystics coach Mike Thibault, who spent 10 years in Uncasville before being fired in 2012.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little weird,\u201d he said. \u201cI invested a lot while I was here. But the people I coached, the people I worked with most of them are gone. So, the same feel is not there.\u201d\n\nUP NEXT\n\nWashington can win its first WNBA championship on Tuesday night on this same court.", "description": "Elena Delle Donne provided an emotional lift playing through a back injury and her Washington teammates responded with a 94-81 win over Connecticut.", "authors": ["The Associated Press", "Published P.M.
