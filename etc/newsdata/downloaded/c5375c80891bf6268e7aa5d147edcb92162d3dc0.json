Warren has actually thought through how her ideas would be implemented in great detail, hired experts to troubleshoot problems that might arise, and then rolled out a sophisticated proposal.\n\nThe difference between a plan to cancel student debt and just saying, \u201cI\u2019m going to cancel student debt!\u201d is that the plan helps persuade people who are afraid of change that this stuff will actually work. A lot of people find it hard to muster the courage to believe in a better world. Warren is helping them get there.\n\nBut there\u2019s one plan that Warren doesn\u2019t need and that won\u2019t help her get elected \u2015 and that\u2019s a plan to pay for her \u201cMedicare for All\u201d proposal without significantly raising taxes on the middle class.\n\nFor some reason, moderators at Democratic primary debates are obsessed with the way presidential candidates label different elements of the cost structure in their health care proposals. They keep asking Warren if Medicare for All will \u201craise taxes.\u201d Warren keeps answering by saying she will lower the amount that middle class families have to spend out of pocket.\n\nThis is a perfectly responsible answer. Under any credible Medicare for All plan, people will stop paying private health insurance premiums and start paying the government for Medicare. Taxes will go up; premiums will disappear. Warren is saying she will not have the government make middle class families poorer \u2015 they will pay less in new taxes than they will save in eliminated premiums.\n\nZach Gibson via Getty Images Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has a health care plan -- \"Medicare for All.\" But there's one plan she doesn't need: How to pay for it without raising taxes on the middle class.\n\nSo far, so good. But the moderators want to goad Warren into saying the words \u201cI will raise taxes,\u201d and they are going to keep asking her the same dumb Medicare for All question until Warren says exactly that. It is a badge of honor in the news industry for a journalist to make a politician say something she does not want to say, and Warren does not want to say, \u201cI will raise taxes,\u201d because it will be used out of context in Republican attack ads.\n\nBut instead of sticking to her guns, Warren is caving to the tax obsessives. According to The Washington Post, she\u2019s airing proposals from economists to develop a detailed plan laying out exactly how she\u2019d pay for every last dime of her Medicare for All proposal. Among other things, her campaign is considering calling the fees for the plan \u201cpublic premiums\u201d rather than \u201ctaxes.\u201d\n\nThis is a big mistake. Running down the Medicare for All pay-for rabbit hole is a loser\u2019s game that misunderstands the appeal of her plans, and it plays to the dying worldview of the conservative elite. The how-will-you-pay-for-it crew isn\u2019t going to stop haranguing her until she says something made for a GOP attack ad. That\u2019s how the game works.\n\nWarren\u2019s 2020 fans aren\u2019t deficit-obsessed economists who want to make sure every new penny of government spending is matched by a new penny in taxation. Most economists aren\u2019t deficit-obsessed economists \u2015 the deficit has been ballooning steadily for 40 years and none of the bad stuff that economists worried about 40 years ago has come to pass. It does not matter one economic iota whether Americans pay for health insurance through premiums or taxes. It\u2019s not even the most important metric for something like Medicare for All \u2015 What\u2019s the impact on wages? On poverty? GDP? All of these are more relevant, but nobody is asking Warren for details about those, and she isn\u2019t going to put them up.\n\nAnd of course the actual numbers on any new health care proposal will not be dictated by whatever Warren puts in a document in October 2019. President Warren would still have to move the legislation through the House \u2015 where Speaker Nancy Pelosi is hostile to some of Warren\u2019s ideas \u2015 and the Senate \u2015 where Republicans have a host of procedural tricks at their disposal.\n\nWarren\u2019s plans work when they convince voters her ideas are feasible \u2015 not because voters think every damn decimal point is going to become law. You either believe the basic story Warren has sketched on Medicare for All, or you don\u2019t. She\u2019s not changing that basic story \u2015 she\u2019s changing the way she describes the details.\n\nThe details matter, of course. But they\u2019re a matter for 2021. The next time TV moderators badger Warren about Medicare for All and the deficit, she should call out their charade.", "description": "There\u2019s one plan the top 2020 Democratic contender doesn\u2019t need.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db2d9c02000009b27506c44.jpeg?cache=zpwybk52hp&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
