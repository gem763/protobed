In contrast, Hamilton has triumphed on 28 occasions. Barring a complete disaster, a third straight title will follow this year, too. Bottas was also ordered to slow down at the last round in Singapore to protect his team-mate\u2019s position, while at this race here last year, the Finn was ushered out of Hamilton\u2019s way to allow the Briton to win.\n\n\u201cOver the years, Lewis hasn\u2019t had the strongest team-mates,\u201d Verstappen said. \u201cIf you have the right car you can beat everyone. Lewis is an amazing driver, and one of the best to have raced in Formula One. But he has also had the best car, and when you have the dominant car, the only one you are really fighting is your team-mate.\u201d\n\nHamilton has said he would welcome Verstappen joining him at Mercedes. Toto Wolff, Hamilton\u2019s boss, is a keen admirer of the Dutchman, who turns 22 on Monday. But the Mercedes team principal, still scarred by Hamilton\u2019s toxic rivalry with Rosberg, has already moved to re-sign Bottas for at least another year.\n\nStory continues\n\nVerstappen remains under contract with Red Bull until the end of next season, but would he relish going up against Hamilton?\n\n\u201cIf it happens, it happens, but it is not something I am dreaming of,\u201d he replied.\n\nVerstappen is tied in the championship with another of the sport\u2019s rising stars, Charles Leclerc, and the pair are the closest non-Mercedes challengers to Hamilton ahead of the final six rounds. They are 96 points off the championship summit with a possible 156 still remaining.\n\nLike Hamilton, Verstappen\u2019s father, Jos \u2013 a journeyman F1 driver who made 106 starts \u2013 was instrumental in shaping his early career.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have any surprises coming into Formula One because nobody could be as hard on me as my dad was,\u201d Verstappen added, before casting his mind back to a karting race in southern Italy, when he was aged 15.\n\nMax Verstappen was fastest in second practice for the Russian Grand Prix in Sochi Credit: Getty Images\n\n\u201cI should have easily won,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the first lap somebody overtook me, and I wanted to get him back straight away. I tried to pass him through a very fast corner, he didn\u2019t see me and we crashed.\n\n\u201cMy dad put so much effort into that weekend, and I threw it away. He was very angry, and he didn\u2019t talk to me. On the way home, within about five miles, he said something and I argued with him. So he pulled over to a fuel station and told me to get out. He just kicked me out of the van, and told me to make my own way home. He drove off.\n\n\u201cI called my mum, who had also been at the race, to come and collect me. For a week, my dad didn\u2019t speak to me.\u201d\n\nVerstappen was fastest in second practice on Friday, but will serve a five-place grid penalty following changes to his engine.\n\nThundery showers are forecast for qualifying and, after finishing eight tenths off the pace in practice, Hamilton said: \u201cI hope it rains, otherwise it is going to be a tough day.\u201d", "description": "Max Verstappen believes Lewis Hamilton\u2019s dominance of Formula One has been helped by team-mates who have failed to test him.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/A53uPInvifRR.yKX.J.Ing--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTYwMA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2hRN1gj_boP7OGC7SzmKeA--~B/aD0zMDA7dz00ODA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/84eb9c75969e2fe412f73670a1304ea3", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
