He started the season serving a two-game suspension for violating the league\u2019s personal conduct policy.\n\nUpon his return he said he was eager to leave his long history of troubles on and off the field in the past\n\n\u201cThe suspension\u2019s behind me, all the negative stuff is behind me. Just eyes forward, staying positive,\u201d Incognito said. \u201cRelishing the opportunity, enjoying every day in here because you don\u2019t know how many more you\u2019re going to have. And wanting to play well. Just really want to charge forward and make it right.\u201d\n\nBurfict\u2019s suspension capped a wild Week 4 in the NFL that included more head-scratching decisions that have turned the league\u2019s one-year experiment with pass interference flags into an exercise in chance.\n\nP.I.? P.U!\n\nThe latest eyebrow raiser came in the Eagles-Packers game Thursday night when Green Bay challenged a non-call, believing Marquez Valdes-Scantling was interfered with on a deep pass.\n\nEagles DB Avante Maddox had his left hand jammed into the receiver\u2019s facemask as the ball was arriving, but the league ruled \u201cthere was no clear and obvious evidence \u201d that Maddox \u201csignificantly hindered\u201d Valdes-Scantling.\n\n\u201cIt looks clear and obvious to me,\u201d suggested Packers coach Matt LaFleur. \u201cBut I\u2019m not the one making the decision.\u201d\n\nAnd there\u2019s no consensus on what constitutes a pass interference call.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t know what pass interference is anymore,\u201d LaFleur said.\n\nNobody does, apparently.\n\nAfter seeing that non-call stand, Broncos coach Vic Fangio told reporters: \u201cYou guys will be extra light on me if you thought I should or shouldn\u2019t challenge something. You guys have seen it. What would you do? Yeah, there\u2019s obviously some disconnection there.\u201d\n\nOn Monday night, the announcers spoke about how Steelers coach Mike Tomlin was just as confused about when to challenge or not challenge a call or a non-call for pass interference because it\u2019s a crapshoot.\n\nFangio said he saw this confusion coming when Saints coach Sean Payton pushed for the rule change after New Orleans was victimized by a non-call on a blatant inference, helping the Rams win the NFC championship and advance to the Super Bowl.\n\n\u201cThe whole meeting (about the new rule) at the league meetings when all this was started was dysfunctional, so it doesn\u2019t surprise me,\u201d Fangio said. \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t in my opinion well thought-out, well-prepared and a little haphazard.\u201d\n\nFangio\u2019s boss, John Elway, sits on the NFL\u2019s competition committee, and Fangio said, \u201cJohn\u2019s as frustrated with it as anybody else.\u2019\u201d\n\nWHISTLE WHILE YOU WORK\n\nAnd the biggest play of the weekend was Chiefs cornerback Bashaud Breeland\u2019s 100-yard fumble return for a touchdown after Detroit\u2019s Kerryon Johnson lost the ball at the opposite goal line. Most of the Lions milled around instead of chasing Breeland, certain it wasn\u2019t worth the effort because the ball was down.\n\nOnly, it was a live ball and the Chiefs had the longest of turnaround touchdowns.\n\nFittingly, Walt Anderson\u2019s crew didn\u2019t blow the play dead like it erroneously had two weeks earlier in the Saints-Rams rematch that wiped off Cameron Jordan\u2019s legitimate 87-yard fumble return for a touchdown.\n\nOfficials were admonished to let such takeaways play out, leaving the league\u2019s headquarters to sort things out on replay reviews.\n\nSo, while the Lions violated the time-honored tradition of playing to the whistle, the officials succeeded in keeping their whistles quiet.\n\n___\n\nFollow Arnie Melendrez Stapleton on Twitter: http://twitter.com/arniestapleton\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jon Gruden tried retrofitting the Raiders into their renegade, rabble-rousing best for one final season in Oakland.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Arnie Stapleton"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/30/raiders_burfict_suspended_football_29046_c0-125-3000-1874_s1770x1032.jpg?f52fad753beb582a85b1710fc9f6c2ec1ddbd99f", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
