Photo: Gary Miller/FilmMagic/Getty Images\n\nThis story originally ran in April 2019. We\u2019re republishing it today in light of Daniel Johnston\u2019s reported death at 58.\n\nIn October 2017, Brian Beattie, an excitable Austin music producer who has worked with Bill Callahan, Okkervil River, and the Dead Milkmen, set off in his beige 2005 Toyota Sienna minivan, dubbed the Golden Rocket, on a mission to break an old pal free from the shackles of creative oppression.\n\nBeattie was traveling to Waller, about a two-hour drive east, en route to the home of Daniel Johnston, the iconic outsider musician and visual artist synonymous with the phrase \u201cHi, how are you,\u201d which stems from his 1983 album of the same name featuring the \u201calien frog\u201d creature that he drew for the cover art. Johnston\u2019s trajectory from DIY darling championed by Kurt Cobain to major-label failure with debilitating schizophrenia and bipolar disorder was chronicled in Jeff Feuerzeig\u2019s award-winning 2005 documentary The Devil and Daniel Johnston. Beattie was working on Johnston\u2019s first album in nearly ten years, an effort Beattie was sure would resurrect Johnston\u2019s career, yet an effort at odds with Johnston\u2019s guardians.\n\nBeattie had ten Johnston songs that he felt made a cohesive album. For a finishing touch, he intended to graft a theatrical interlude \u2014 a sort of running skit \u2014 onto side two of the record. He saw it as a nod to Johnston\u2019s early days, in the \u201980s, when the albums Johnston recorded on cassette tapes in his Austin apartment amounted to glorified experiments.\n\nMany of those records, like Yip/Jump Music and Retired Boxer, had quirky voice-overs and prerecorded sounds, with Johnston gleefully pounding away on a chord organ. In the beginning, Johnston would make individual copies of his albums by recording on a boom box and performing them in their entirety again and again, tape after tape. Beattie hoped he could talk Johnston into reciting dialogue for a character Beattie had created in Johnston\u2019s own likeness and conjure that old magic.\n\nThe new album is titled If, as in \u201cIf I had my own way,\u201d the first line from the first song on Johnston\u2019s first album, Songs of Pain, from 1981. The full-circle poignancy seemed apparent to the then 56-year-old Johnston. In addition to mental-health issues, he had in recent years contracted hydrocephalus, or excessive fluid on the brain. This causes headaches, loss of coordination, incontinence \u2014 even brain damage \u2014 and has necessitated surgery. \u201cHe\u2019s in an uncertain state, really, right now,\u201d his older brother and manager, Dick Johnston, told me around the time of Beattie\u2019s trip to Waller.\n\nIf was culled from original and cover songs recorded during several wide-ranging sessions that Beattie conducted between 1995 and 2003. These began when Beattie was commissioned to record Johnston performing the song \u201cCasper\u201d for Larry Clark\u2019s 1995 movie Kids. The sessions continued when, in 1996, Atlantic Records dropped Johnston after his 1994 debut album, Fun, tanked.\n\nJohnston was living at his parents\u2019 house, and musically adrift, he routinely sought Beattie to record him performing in their garage. Beattie would pack his recording equipment into the Golden Rocket and make same-day trips for sessions that would, if Beattie was lucky, last an hour. Beattie wasn\u2019t compensated upfront, but from these sessions he produced the Johnston albums Rejected Unknown (2001) and Lost and Found (2006), for which he was paid roughly $6,000 and $4,000.\n\nJohnston and Beattie go back to the \u201980s, when Beattie was the bassist for Glass Eye, a four-piece whose members, minus Beattie, were players in the Madonna pap-smear scene from Richard Linklater\u2019s 1991 film Slacker. Glass Eye was part of a collection of Austin alternative-rock bands known as the New Sincerity movement, including the Reivers, True Believers, and Wild Seeds. Johnston distributed his tapes to members in the scene, including Glass Eye front woman Kathy McCarty.\n\nBeattie said McCarty told him, \u201cI don\u2019t know if this is the most brilliant thing or the stupidest thing ever.\u201d Beattie has come to see this as an appropriate assessment of a grown man unabashedly baring his loveless, tortured soul with the fervor of a child.\n\nWhen Beattie and McCarty visited Johnston\u2019s apartment for the first time, Johnston opened a medical journal and flipped to a chapter about manic depression. He said he\u2019d been diagnosed and that if they wanted to hang with him then they needed to know. In 1985, Glass Eye gave Johnston his first ever gig as their opener at Beach Cabaret, a defunct New Sincerity club.\n\nIn the summer of 2017, Beattie finally gave in to Johnston\u2019s pleas to transfer the recordings from those old sessions into a workable editing format in order to make If. Johnston regards If as the third installment of a trilogy with Beattie. The record shows Johnston\u2019s skills as an interpreter of catchy pop music. There are plenty of his signature ditties, like \u201cShe\u2019s a Clown,\u201d about a guy under a girl\u2019s thumb, with Johnston on acoustic guitar, and \u201cWithout Love,\u201d about how it\u2019s a bummer to be alone, with Johnston on piano. On \u201cFavorite Valentine,\u201d a woozy, churning number, Johnston even plays drums.\n\nIf also serves as a document of Johnston\u2019s evolution as a troubled artist. Take the seven-minute cover of Carole King\u2019s \u201cYou\u2019ve Got a Friend,\u201d recorded a couple of days before Thanksgiving in 1996. The singular performance sounds like a nervous breakdown. Johnston had invited Dale Dudgeon, his childhood friend, and Paul Leary of the Austin rock band Butthole Surfers, who produced Fun, to participate in the session. Beattie, who brought drummer Dave Jungen, said Johnston was an emotional wreck at the time and desperately wanted this reunion. A few days later, he was hospitalized.\n\nThe bit Beattie wanted Johnston to record would dose If with a measure of primitivism inherent in the sound that first popularized Johnston. \u201cAnytime his music sounds absolutely refined, it\u2019s not quite right,\u201d Beattie said. \u201cSomething has to be broken about it for it to make sense.\u201d\n\nThe exercise might be all for naught. If might never be released. There is major disconnect between Beattie and Johnston\u2019s management team. This includes Dick, who inherited the duty from their dad, Bill, and Tom Gimbel, who moonlights as Johnston\u2019s co-manager while employed as general manager of Austin City Limits TV.\n\n\u201cBrian\u2019s a great guy and I\u2019m really thrilled that he\u2019s enthusiastic about all of this,\u201d Dick said of If, \u201cbut I\u2019m concerned that in its current state it doesn\u2019t have enough robust material.\u201d\n\nJohnston lives alone in a ranch house that his dad built for him in the mid-aughts. He is occasionally visited by his siblings and a caretaker who uses the house next door, once occupied by Johnston\u2019s now-deceased parents, as a base. When Beattie arrived, Johnston\u2019s sister Marjory answered the door.\n\n\u201cHey, I\u2019m Brian. Did you know I was coming today? Did Dick tell you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Marjory said.\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cBrian!\u201d Johnston yelled in the background.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t good because I have to leave in 20 minutes,\u201d Marjory said.\n\n\u201cWell, Dick set it up,\u201d Beattie replied. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to do some recording. Am I not going to be able to do that?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Dick comes over here,\u201d she countered, \u201cbut we\u2019re not supposed to leave people with Dan without a family member here.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, that\u2019s fine. I can try to do it quickly.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwenty minutes? No, no, we need to call Dick. Come on in.\u201d\n\nBeattie walked into the kitchen, where Johnston sat in a wheelchair at a table with a picture tube TV and a mound of candy atop it. He wore sweatpants and a stained T-shirt. There was a wax-figure glow to his face and one arm shook uncontrollably as the other chain-smoked cigarettes.\n\nWatching over him from perches created by removing the doors of the upper kitchen cabinets were dozens of Johnston\u2019s superhero and comic-book figurines \u2014 the sources of inspiration for the drawings that earned him a spot in the 2006 Whitney Biennial. On a dry-erase board was written a John Lennon lyric: \u201cWell we all shine on, like the moon and the stars and the sun.\u201d\n\nBeattie plugged a boom box into the island and began playing songs from If. He skipped over the first couple, looking for one he had recently remixed. He stopped at \u201cHot Dog Shop.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe last time I was here,\u201d Beattie reminded Johnston, \u201cyou said, \u2018I want you to make every song sound like a hit song.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Johnston replied.\n\nThat had inspired Beattie to do some tweaking. As he played the new version, jaunty with saxophone flourishes, he remarked that he had aped the melody from Johnston\u2019s classic song \u201cWalking the Cow.\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d Johnston concurred. That was Johnston\u2019s standard response: \u201cYeah.\u201d It made it seem like he was just along for the ride, but a trigger went off once Beattie played \u201cDown on the Farm.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe that song could be eliminated,\u201d Johnston offered. \u201cIt\u2019s not really a favorite of mine. Pick another one.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou got it,\u201d Beattie said. \u201cThere are plenty.\u201d\n\nThe last song was \u201cYou\u2019ve Got a Friend.\u201d Johnston\u2019s original version was ten minutes, but Beattie ran out of tape two-thirds of the way through and lost out in the time it took to insert a second tape. Beattie was left with two fragments that he stitched together. The song was playing when Marjory returned to declare that it was fine for Beattie to linger after she left.\n\n\u201cDaniel can\u2019t have any alcohol or drugs,\u201d she instructed Beattie. \u201cAnd he can\u2019t give you any of his art.\u201d Pause. \u201cDaniel does Carole King \u2014 I like it!\u201d\n\nMarjory reminded her brother about his pills. Johnston hopped up from his wheelchair, as if it were a prop, and retrieved a jug of pink juice from the freezer. He filled a plastic highball and washed down his medicine.\n\nJohnston has all but disappeared since the Fun album, and that is largely because of his management. Bill and Dick have done a commendable job, but it\u2019s taxing work managing both Johnston\u2019s creative sparks and his volcanic health. \u201cI love Daniel \u2014 we get along just fine \u2014 but I wonder sometimes what else I would be doing if I didn\u2019t have all of this on my plate,\u201d Dick said.\n\nIn the \u201980s, Johnston released ten albums. These came out on Stress Records, a label started by Jeff Tartakov, Johnston\u2019s previous co-manager. Tartakov, who worked in concert with the Johnstons, struck Johnston\u2019s first major-label deal with Elektra, but Johnston rejected the offer because he thought Metallica, also on Elektra, was in cahoots with the Devil. Johnston reasoned that Tartakov was in on it, too, and impetuously fired him.\n\nAround that time, Johnston walked into Amazing Records in Austin, to drop off a tape. After he left, Tom Gimbel, a 20-something who worked there, caught up with him outside. Gimbel gave Johnston his business card and two weeks later Johnston called Gimbel and asked him to be his manager. Gimbel said he tried to get Johnston to reconcile with Tartakov. He also told Johnston that he was not an experienced manager. That didn\u2019t matter.\n\nGimbel has been at the helm, alongside Dick, since Fun. In those 25 years, Johnston has released only four original albums. Poor health is a contributing factor, but still, according to Dick, there are 1,500 tapes in Johnston\u2019s archive, suggesting a trove of undiscovered material, and Beattie said Johnston is always making new music.\n\nOf these four albums, two were by produced by Beattie. A third, Fear Yourself (2003), was produced by Mark Linkous of the band Sparklehorse almost as a spontaneous reaction to Linkous and Johnston realizing that they were related, according to Beattie. (Linkous died in 2010.)\n\nThese endeavors were self-sustaining, but the fourth album, Is and Always Was (2009), produced by Beck collaborator Jason Falkner, was a pet project of Gimbel\u2019s. This was a concerted effort by management to streamline Johnston\u2019s music. On the record\u2019s Wikipedia page, it says, \u201cThe album is noted for its upbeat sound in comparison to previous albums.\u201d\n\nThat sensibility runs counter to Beattie\u2019s artistic vision for Johnston, where sonic warts and hiccups are glorified. These differences of opinion have created tension between Beattie and Gimbel, and are at the root of If.\n\n\u201cBrian\u2019s kind of acting unilaterally here,\u201d Gimbel said, \u201ctaking songs that were recorded during the Rejected Unknown and Lost and Found sessions, but weren\u2019t deemed ready for release at that time, or maybe they weren\u2019t considered to be the strongest, so they didn\u2019t make those particular final track listings.\u201d\n\nBecause Johnston is powerless to advance his agenda, Beattie serves as his advocate, and Gimbel\u2019s ambivalence about If hasn\u2019t deterred him. In fact, Beattie thinks Johnston is primed for a resurgence. The key to that, in Beattie\u2019s mind, is releasing If on a traditional label, with proper marketing and promotion. With the right care, he thinks Johnston could be a star again.\n\nBut Dick prefers releasing Johnston\u2019s music exclusively on his own label, Eternal Yip Eye. Back when Beattie was working on Rejected Unknown and Lost and Found, there was a unified interest in using an outside label. But Gammon, the New York label for those two albums, went out of business around the time of the latter release, and both efforts fared poorly. Still, Dick, ever conflicted over his duties, took the unusual step of allowing Beattie to shop If around to labels.\n\n\u201cAll of Daniel\u2019s other albums are now under his own label,\u201d Dick said, \u201cand we do our own distribution and promotion and stuff, so it doesn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense.\u201d Pause. \u201cIt might make sense to give it to a label and just accept an advance. That\u2019s why I said go ahead and talk to them.\u201d\n\nSome major indie labels have expressed interest, but when Beattie enlists Dick to make a deal, momentum stalls. Even though Beattie shares the copyright to If with Johnston, he wants a happy ending for everyone. Were Beattie to concede to release If on Eternal Yip Eye, this would probably be a done deal. But Beattie sees that as a Gammon redux \u2014 an album released DOA.\n\n\u201cI refuse to let that be the destiny of this record,\u201d Beattie said, \u201cor at least I refuse to stand by helplessly while that becomes the destiny of this record.\u201d\n\nWith Marjory gone, Beattie began pitching Johnston on the theatrical interlude. Johnston appeared to pay attention, but at some point he interrupted Beattie.\n\n\u201cYeah, that CD that you brought was just great the other day,\u201d Johnston told Beattie. \u201cI listened to it and we loved it. Everybody loved it.\u201d\n\nJohnston was referring to a copy of If. Delighted, Beattie clarified that the songs on that CD were merely older versions of what he had just played for Johnston.\n\n\u201cI really do enjoy the music,\u201d Johnston continued. \u201cIt\u2019s really good. It\u2019s some of the best stuff you and I have done.\u201d\n\nJohnston eventually agreed to the dialogue. As Beattie set up his recording operation, Johnston\u2019s medication infiltrated his body. He repeatedly nodded off and jolted himself upright. He rubbed his eyes and slugged more juice. He soldiered on through the episode despite sounding like he had four plums stuffed in his mouth.\n\n\u201cWith our album coming out,\u201d Johnston later said, \u201cI think we could be a hit.\u201d\n\nJohnston reminisced about the two previous albums he and Beattie had done.\n\n\u201cEverything was all right back then,\u201d Johnston said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any trouble. And we were carefree, and there was nothing that mattered. Nowadays, everything\u2019s a nightmare.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Beattie said.\n\n\u201cYou get that feeling?\u201d Johnston continued.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Beattie responded, \u201cit\u2019s true.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody needs a Sugar Daddy, I think,\u201d Johnston joked. He meant the candy, a piece of which he picked up from the table.\n\nBeattie had been there an hour. Johnston was worried about having an unsupervised guest for too long. It was time to leave. As Beattie gathered his belongings, Johnston peeled the wrapper off of the Sugar Daddy and considered where in the house he might have left the cover art he had created for If.\n\nIn the year-and-a-half since Beattie\u2019s trip to Waller, little progress has been made with If. At SXSW 2018, Beattie set up on South Congress Avenue, in Austin, and played songs from the album to passersby as a way to drum up excitement. An employee of a taste-making Nashville label with a penchant for pressing records showed interest in the rights to the vinyl issue of If.\n\nBeattie said he was willing to release If on Eternal Yip Eye if he could have this one concession. But that negotiation was met unfavorably by Johnston\u2019s management. I emailed Gimbel, whom Dick defers to on business matters, about the album\u2019s status. He offered an off-the-record response that was not positive.\n\nBeattie, who claims he has enough material for another album or two, remains in contact with Johnston. He says Johnston frequently asks him why If hasn\u2019t been released. Beattie doesn\u2019t have an answer.\n\nThere\u2019s a chance If will fade away. Perhaps that\u2019s not the worst. A \u201clost\u201d album has its benefits. It creates mystique and makes for future discovery. Still, it would be a shame to not capitalize on Johnstons mounting Renaissance.\n\nA 2017 tour was met with considerable fanfare. In each city Johnston played, he was backed by a different act, including Jeff Tweedy, the Preservation Hall All-Stars, and members of Fugazi. Also, last June, an Apple spot featuring Johnston\u2019s 1982 song \u201cThe Story of an Artist\u201d topped Billboard & Clio\u2019s Top TV Commercials chart, earning Johnston his first-ever No. 1 on any Billboard chart.\n\nThis past January, the second annual Hi, How Are You Day took place. This Austin affair raises awareness about mental health and included live performances by the Flaming Lips, Yo La Tengo, and Doug Martsch of Built to Spill. People were hoping for Johnston to appear, but he was apparently in the hospital again.", "description": "Daniel Johnston, an extremely prolific musician and outsider artist, has released many albums, but there\u2019s one that just hasn\u2019t seen the light of day.", "authors": ["Michael Hoinski"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/04/03/03-daniel-johnston.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
