Nonetheless there should have been a safety plan in place and divers on stand-by. But there were none.\n\nTo add insult to injury, the ferry company went on to wish everyone a \"blessed and fruitful day\" on its social media pages later that day. It angered many Kenyans.\n\nWhen the management of state-owned Kenya Ferry Services (KFS) finally spoke to the media on Monday, they stuck to an uninspiring script about rescue efforts, but did not talk more about accident prevention.\n\nAs yet, the bodies still have not been recovered from the sea.\n\nThe never-quit attitude of those in charge of our ferry services is not peculiar in a country where civil servants swagger around like ambassadors seemingly with diplomatic immunity.\n\nSadly, there are other examples.\n\nA fortnight ago, eight children were killed when their school building in the capital, Nairobi, collapsed during morning lessons.\n\nThis incident at Precious Talent Top School, a private day school in Nairobi, prompted national and county governments to spring into action. In typical fashion, they suspended several officials and ordered the demolition of other poorly built schools.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Rescuers attempted to clear debris at Precious Talent Top School in Nairobi\n\nBut no-one seemed ready to ask the tough questions: Who could have prevented this disaster in the first place? What about collective responsibility?\n\nWhat we saw was finger-pointing between regulatory agencies, the local MP, the county government and the national government.\n\nAnd because the parents of the children who died appear not to have the financial means to seek serious legal redress, the whole incident was swiftly brushed under the carpet.\n\nCitizen TV Civil servants swagger around like ambassadors seemingly with diplomatic immunity\n\nWhen the privately-owned Patel dam burst in western Kenya's Solai town last year, at least 44 people were killed.\n\nPoliticians were quick to express their outrage, and a Water Resources Management Authority spokeswoman said the dam had been built illegally. The farm's manager denied any wrongdoing.\n\nMore than a year later, no government officials have lost their jobs and nobody has been convicted for the deaths.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nAnd who will cry out for the 11 endangered rhinos that died last year after a botched relocation attempt from Nairobi National Park to the country's biggest national park, Tsavo East?\n\nAccording to Kenya's market-leading newspaper Daily Nation, a parliamentary committee pointed an accusing finger at Tourism and Wildlife Minister Najib Balala, saying he should take full responsibility for the deaths.\n\nBut the minister denied any wrongdoing, and passed the buck on to the agencies that coordinated the relocation.\n\nI could cite yet more examples to prove my argument, that in Kenya nobody in authority takes responsibility when things go wrong.\n\nUntil accountability becomes common practice the usual cycle will repeat itself.\n\nSocial media activist Phillip Ogola once aptly captured the response of politicians to a disaster as follows: \"Rush to the scene, condole families, donate items, issue a tough statement, form a commission, wait for another disaster, repeat above\".\n\nHopefully one day that will change.\n\nMore Letters from Africa\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica", "description": "Not quitting brings glory on the athletics track but misery when political officials pass the buck.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/10984/production/_109127976_gettyimages-1170373728.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
