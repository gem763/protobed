They\u2019re tweens.\u201d\n\nTweens? Twelve-year-olds?\n\nOn a Richter Scale of Horrors, with one being a slight gasp and 10 a blood-curdling scream, this piece \u2014 this all-hail-the-glory-of-kiddie-drag-queens piece \u2014 hits at an 11.\n\nWhen did sexualizing pre-pubescents become accepted American practice?\n\nThe story opens with the excited exclamations of 12-year-old Desmond Napoles, also known as \u201cDesmond is Amazing\u201d in the drag world, after he gets the go-ahead to attend DragCon, a New York City convention hosted by famed drag artist RuPaul. His mother, Wendy Napoles, speaks of how \u201ctheatrical\u201d her son has always been. And The Times helpfully includes a quick backgrounder of Demond\u2019s drag experiences, beneath of photo of him dressed as a girl, with a long, flowing pink-and-yellow-skirt, captioned \u201cat a fitting for DragCon.\u201d\n\nRemember: this kid is 12.\n\nOn a different online site, this photograph, this descriptor, would be cause to call the cops.\n\nThe newspaper then reports on \u201cKeegan, a.k.a. Kween Keekee \u2026 a 9-year-old drag queen.\u201d\n\nNine \u2014 aka a fourth- or fifth-grader.\n\n\u201cAs recently as the 1970s, when dressing as another gender could lead to arrest on charges of vagrancy or \u2018perversion\u2019 in many jurisdictions, drag was an adults-only affair, relegated to underground spaces and rich in sexual innuendo,\u201d The New York Times reports. \u201cBut as gay culture has gained mainstream acceptance, the number and variety of locations where drag is welcome have grown. G-rated story hours are now offered at public libraries. Kids \u2014 and parents intent on raising them outside of traditional gender norms \u2014 are keen to perform.\u201d\n\nThis is insanity.\n\nThis is normalizing the sexualization of children under the cloak of LGBTQ rights. This is child abuse masked as freedom and free choice.\n\nThese are little kids.\n\nThey are not props for the mentally deranged fantasies of adults.\n\nThey\u2019ve not even passed puberty \u2014 and yet we\u2019re expected to accept and believe they\u2019ve decided on their own volition, absent any influence at all, to drape themselves in flamboyant costumes that are blatantly sex-based, and parade and prance for the admiration and cheers of grown men and women? Of grown men and women who believe males and females are simply states of mind, as interchangeable as shoes?\n\nShame on The New York Times for exploring and presenting a dark and seedy world in such glowing, fawning, accepting light.\n\nBut an even bigger shame on a country that allows this exploitation and abuse of its youngest and most vulnerable to occur, unchallenged.\n\nNine-year-old children are not drag queens. They\u2019re not drag kings, either. They\u2019re kids. They\u2019re little elementary school kids who ought to be playing with the family dog and riding their bikes and learning to cut along the lines and write book reports \u2014 not dancing in drag for the amusement and creepy lusts of dysfunctional adults. No matter how many media outlets try to sell otherwise.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
