But the social network confesses that it still has a lot to learn.\n\nThe social media giant said Thursday it is expanding its \u201cToday In\u201d service to 6,000 cities and towns across the U.S., up from 400 in its previous iteration. Launched in early 2018, the service lets Facebook users opt into local news and information from local organizations. Such news can include missing-person alerts, local election results, road closures and crime reports.\n\nThe tool lives within the Facebook app; turning it on adds local updates to a user\u2019s regular news feed. In areas with scant local news, Facebook will add relevant articles from surrounding areas.\n\nThe service won\u2019t automatically turn on for people even in the areas it serves, which could limit its reach. So far, Facebook says, 1.6 million people have activated Today In. They receive news from some 1,200 publishers every week.\n\nThe service aggregates posts from the official Facebook pages for news organizations, government agencies and community groups like dog shelters. It uses software filters to weed out objectionable content.\n\nFacebook employs no human editors for Today In, so tweaking its algorithm to find such good local stories has been a complicated process. Does a road closure matter if it\u2019s 100 miles away? How about a murder?\n\nSome 1,800 newspapers have closed in the United States over the last 15 years, according to research out of the University of North Carolina. Newsroom employment has declined by 45% as the industry struggles with a broken business model partly caused by the success of companies on the internet, including Facebook.\n\n\u201cThere is no silver bullet,\u201d said Campbell Brown, head of global news partnerships at Facebook, in an interview. \u201cWe really want to help publishers address challenges in local markets.\u201d\n\nBrown, a former news anchor and host at NBC and CNN, said local reporting remains the \u201cmost important\u201d form of journalism today. She said Facebook has a \u201cresponsibility\u201d to support journalism, while also noting that the media industry has been in decline \u201cfor a very long time.\u201d\n\nLocal news is just one part of the Today In feature, which also includes posts from local groups along with events and community announcements from schools and governments. A news section within the section shows stories from local newspapers, blogs and TV stations. Facebook isn\u2019t paying licensing fees or sharing ad revenue with these outlets, but says the tool is driving new readers to local news outlets.\n\nAlready, Facebook says it\u2019s learned from publishers\u2019 input about what doesn\u2019t work. For instance, it now only allows posts from publishers registered with its \u201cNews page index,\u201d which means they meet guidelines such as a focus on current events and information, citing sources and including dates and don\u2019t have a record of publishing false news and misinformation. This means that obituaries from funeral homes, or real estate posts \u2014 both of which previously showed up under \u201cnews\u201d \u2014 are no longer eligible.\n\nThe company says publishers featured in Today In see a significant increase \u201creferral traffic\u201d to their websites from Facebook, more so than when people see the same stories in their regular news feed, based on data from its test partners.\n\n\u201c(With the) news feed, people scroll through passively,\u201d said Jimmy O\u2019Keefe, a product marketing manager at Facebook. \u201cWe see that people engage with articles more than they would in news feed.\u201d\n\nOutside researchers studying local news data provided by Facebook found that about half of the news stories in the Today In feature met what they called a \u201ccritical information need\u201d in the communities it served. This could be helpful for news publishers in determining coverage priorities and for Facebook as it tweaks how it presents news to its users.\n\nFacebook has also learned that local news doesn\u2019t work like national news. Political stories, for instance, don\u2019t generate a lot of local interest.\n\nWhen researchers looked at the types of news stories Facebook showed and how users interacted with them, finding that Facebook users interacted the most with stories serving a critical need - such as information on emergencies, transportation and health. While there were more \u201cnon-critical\u201d stories available, on sports, for instance, people didn\u2019t interact with those to the same degree. The researchers -Matthew Weber at the University of Minnesota and Peter Andriga and Philip Napoli at Duke University -received no funding from Facebook.\n\nThe expansion to 6,000 cities still doesn\u2019t include large metro areas such as New York City, Los Angeles or San Francisco, where the abundance of news and population density makes it more difficult to provide relevant local information. A big local story in Brooklyn, for instance, might be irrelevant on Staten Island just a few miles away.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Facebook is trying to coax \"news deserts\" into bloom with the second major expansion of a tool that exposes people to more local news and information.
