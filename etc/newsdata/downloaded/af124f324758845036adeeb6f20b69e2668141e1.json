China\u2019s Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng said progress was being made in discussions with the United States and that while both sides respected each other, no problem was beyond resolution.\n\nThe dollar index .DXY was last up 0.17% to 97.489.\n\nElsewhere, the Canadian dollar CAD= weakened against its U.S. counterpart after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau hung onto power after a tight election on Monday that saw his government reduced to a minority. He now looks set to govern with support from the left-leaning New Democrats who would make the construction of new oil pipelines more difficult.\n\nThe left-leaning coalition isn\u2019t \u201cbeneficial for the Canadian dollar, versus a Conservative majority which would have seen a rally, largely because there is going to be focus on the pipelines, which reinforce some of the competitiveness issues on the Canadian oil front,\u201d said McCormick.", "description": "The dollar rose on Tuesday against the pound and euro as uncertainty spread ahead of the British parliament's vote on the Withdrawal Agreement Bill which will shine light on when and how Britain will exit the EU.", "authors": ["Kate Duguid", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443652634&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L0MJ", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
