These campesinos stare at you standing in the cloud of dust left by your departing taxi not with unfriendliness so much as utter disbelief.\n\nSoon, however, your Viagras handler arrives, rattling through the plaza in a beige Nissan Sentra with a bullet-cracked windshield.\n\n\u201cYou have to give me your cell phone,\u201d the handler says, by way of greeting, \u201cso you can\u2019t be tracked.\u201d So you agree to turn it over and then, phone-less, you\u2019re driven out into the sun-roasted fields of the campo.\n\nTierra Caliente, where this meeting takes place, is on the State Department watch list for U.S. citizens. And with good reason. Several Americans have been killed in or near the region, including the much publicized case of a motorcycle tourist mistaken for a DEA agent. Another hapless yanqui was found tortured and burned to death in Tierra Caliente just a few weeks ago.\n\nIn other words, gringo: You\u2019ve been warned.\n\nIt\u2019s the last Saturday in February, and you\u2019re about to meet Viagras leader Nicol\u00e1s Sierra Santana\u2014aka \u201cEl Gordo,\u201d or The Fat One. Since the capture of Joaqu\u00edn \u201cChapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n, back in January, El Gordo has become one of the most wanted men in Mexico.\n\nUnder him, the Viagras have grown so much that even other outlaws complain about their methods.\n\nThe regional district attorney has outstanding arrest orders out for Gordo Sierra, charging him with multiple counts of homicide, robbery, extortion, and kidnapping. One of the group\u2019s top sicarios, or assassins, was busted by a joint task force in early February, after allegedly committing dozens of murders on his boss\u2019s behalf.\n\nAnd yet, during two weeks spent trying to track El Gordo down, you\u2019ve heard many conflicting tales about the Viagras and their jefe. In fact, many locals reject that very idea that The Fat One is a criminal at all.\n\nMultiple sources in Apatzing\u00e1n and the surrounding communities have told you they see Los Viagras as heroes\u2014valiant freedom fighters brave enough to take on both local cartels and a corrupt state government.\n\nThe police in Mexico\u2014and especially in Michoac\u00e1n\u2014are famously dirty, often acting on behalf of criminal groups. Since ordinary citizens first began fighting back against the drug gangs in this part of the country, in 2013, several other anti-cartel militia leaders have been wrongly imprisoned on trumped up charges. So it\u2019s not impossible that El Gordo really is less evil than depicted.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why you\u2019re here, in a shot-up ride and with no phone, racing on up into the foothills where El Gordo is hiding.\n\nYou\u2019ve come to meet the man behind the man and ask him to his face: Just who are the Viagras?\u2014and what, if anything, do they stand for?\n\nAbout 12 miles down the road from the plaza a narrow dirt road cuts off into the dry tropical forest. The dominant species in this area is mesquite, but higuera, anona, and coyul fruit trees also grow near natural springs. After a few more miles the handler turns off the unpaved track into a clearing in what seems like empty, rolling woodland.\n\nBut El Gordo\u2019s camp is here, invisible from the road, protected on all sides by old-growth timber. A narrow path leads from the clearing into a thicket that shelters three 4x4s and two campfires. Ten or 12 bodyguards\u2014most of them young men in their early twenties\u2014patrol the camp with AK47s on their shoulders, pistols stuck into their belts.\n\nGordo Sierra is seated in a plastic lawn chair beside one of the brush-laden campfires, bathing in greenwood smoke to ward off mosquitos. He\u2019s got a full beard, a dry handshake, and a sly, one-side-of-the-mouth-only smile. At 38 years old he sports a hefty paunch\u2014hence his nickname\u2014and he\u2019s wearing jeans, a gray polo shirt, and a blue baseball cap.\n\n\u201cThe pueblo [community] supports me around here,\u201d he explains, once the interview is underway. \u201cThey protect me, they hide me, because I fight to protect them,\u201d he says, in answer to a question about whether he worries about the authorities hunting him down, as they did Chapo Guzm\u00e1n.\n\n\u201cWhen the troops come in force, the people will rise up to defend me,\u201d says El Gordo, who claims to command about a thousand Viagras footsoldiers. The alleged cartel chieftain adds that his men maintain a sophisticated surveillance system that includes monitoring police and military radio frequencies.\n\n\u201cThe authorities know where I am, but they\u2019re afraid to come after me because of the scandal I could make by talking [about the government\u2019s links to organized crime].\u201d\n\nFor that reason, he says, officials \u201cdon\u2019t want to arrest me, they want to kill me. But my people aren\u2019t going to let that happen.\u201d\n\nEl Gordo says that, unlike Chapo, he and his men are determined to avoid cloistered urban areas where they can be outmaneuvered and pinned down.\n\n\u201cI can live my whole life in the sierra if I have to,\u201d he says. \u201cAs long as I have my freedom, every day is a gift.\u201d\n\nEl Gordo and the rest of the Viagras are used to a life on the lam in the mountains. The group was once a paramilitary wing of the much-feared Knights Templar cartel, working as an enforcer squad under the direct command of crime lord Servando \u201cLa Tuta\u201d (The Teacher) G\u00f3mez.\n\nThe Templars made their fortune cooking and shipping crystal meth to the States, but they also branched out to take over many local industries. El Gordo\u2019s old cartel\u2014which also doubled as a quasi-religious death cult\u2014became so powerful in Michoac\u00e1n that they eventually brought on their own downfall.\n\nIn February of 2013, ordinary citizens across Michoac\u00e1n began to enlist in well-armed vigilante groups, aiming to strike down the Knights. After seeing their early successes, the Mexican government got on board as well, funding the militias and using them to run point for field operations against the cartel.\n\nWhen they realized their old boss\u2019s days were numbered, the Viagras flipped sides, joining the nascent autodefensas (self-defense groups). Due to their tactical know-how, state officials soon folded El Gordo\u2019s Viagras into an elite task force called the G250\u2014then sent them up into the Sierra Madre del Sur to hunt down La Tuta and his remaining followers.\n\nLa Tuta was captured in February of 2015, and many of his fellow capos were either killed or incarcerated at about the same time. With the threat posed by the Templars removed, officials changed their position on the vigilantes, disbanding some groups by force, and eventually declaring the whole movement to be illegal.\n\nUnfortunately, the suppression of the autodefensas has led to a resurgence of powerful crime groups across Michoac\u00e1n, as Templar splinter cells rebounded, often co-opting former vigilantes into their ranks.\n\n\u201cThe Mexican government first ignored, then confronted and finally attempted to morph self-defense groups into a government-controlled rural police force,\u201d says Maureen Meyer, a Mexican expert with the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA), in an email to The Daily Beast.\n\n\u201cNone of these efforts have been able to successfully or fully rein in these citizen groups or control the security situation in Michoac\u00e1n,\u201d Meyer says, leading to \u201cthe citizenry\u2019s sense that the Mexican government [is] failing to come to their aid.\u201d\n\nViagras leader El Gordo also blames the government for the current security crisis in Michoac\u00e1n.\n\n\u201cThe state armed us, trained us, and then abandoned us,\u201d says Sierra, during our meeting in his forest hideaway. \u201cNow they want to persecute us.\u201d\n\nAccording to El Gordo, the government\u2019s crackdown on its former vigilante allies is actually fomenting violence in the region. Once the militias were forced to go underground, he says, they had \u201cto engage in illegal activities in order to raise money to go on defending the pueblo.\u201d\n\nWhen I ask what Sierra uses to defend himself, he pulls out a chrome-plated, 9 mm pistol with filigrees of wild mustangs etched into the grip and slide.\n\n\u201cIn two months I could stabilize the state, if they let me,\u201d the self-avowed vigilante waves his expensive pistol emphatically, but \u201cthe government is very close to certain drug trafficking groups.\u201d\n\nEl Gordo names the Jalisco Cartel: the New Generation, as being a crime group deliberately shielded by the state.\n\n\u201cIf I had enough money to pay off the government,\u201d Sierra says, \u201cthey wouldn\u2019t be hunting for me now.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just the police and army who have it in for El Gordo\u2019s band of enigmatic warriors. The recent appearance of narcomantas (cartel banners) across the state have made it clear that Templar offspring like La Nueva Familia, as well as rival groups of vigilantes\u2014are also targeting the Viagras.\n\nOver the same weekend that I met with Sierra, at least 19 people were killed in separate gun battles in Tierra Caliente and surrounding communities\u2014all of them victims of infighting between the Viagras and other armed factions seeking to take over their turf, according to the Michoac\u00e1n state police.\n\nEl Gordo says the new threat posed by the Templars\u2019 descendants has made it impossible for him and his men to disarm themselves, despite the government\u2019s call for all vigilantes to lay down their weapons.\n\n\u201cIf we did give up our guns,\u201d he asks, \u201chow long do you think it would take for [our enemies] to kill us all?\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to the question of whether or not the Viagras are a criminal group, El Gordo breaks character for the first time in the interview. Until now he\u2019s been genial, even charming, offering up lemonade and a homemade dish of fruit cocktail against the heat.\n\nBut now he stands and leans his bulk in over me to make his point.\n\n\u201cThe Viagras don\u2019t have any nexus with organized crime,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t run labs. We don\u2019t kidnap people. It\u2019s all lies!\u201d\n\nThen he sits down, the storm of his rage already passed. He admits, smiling slyly, that he\u2019d once invested in labs to produce crystal meth\u2014which he refers to in English as \u201cice\u201d\u2014but says he gave all that up when he joined the autodefensas.\n\nWhen I ask about rumors to the contrary, he elaborates further:\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t run ice labs anymore, because the government is too good at finding them. So it\u2019s just not convenient.\u201d\n\nIn any case, he continues, running \u201cice\u201d is no longer profitable. Most of the raw material for making meth used to come from China, entering Michoac\u00e1n through the Pacific city of L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas\u2014Mexico\u2019s largest shipping port\u2014but an increase in Chinese regulations has choked off the supply.\n\nThe ingredients \u201cused to come in disguised as perfume, in shipments of three or four thousand barrels,\u201d he says. \u201cNow there might be 100 [barrels] at a time.\u201d\n\nThe destruction of the supply chain has impacted both the quality and quantity of product turned out by meth kitchens in Michoac\u00e1n. Meanwhile, the loss of drug revenue has forced local cartels to diversify in order to maintain funding.\n\nAccording to Sierra, that\u2019s part of the reason for the recent uptick in extortion and abductions. Other cartel moneymakers in Michoac\u00e1n include tapping into the mining, agriculture, and shipping industries, although he repeats that the Viagras are innocent of such endeavors.\n\nInstead he claims the Viagras\u2014whose name came from the slicked-up, erect hair style favored by one of Sierra\u2019s brothers during their school boy days in the nearby town of Pinz\u00e1ndaro\u2014pay their expenses by cattle ranching and lime farming.\n\n\u201cDuring the war against the Templarios I was always on the front lines, always in the center of the fighting\u2014and I made a lot of enemies. That\u2019s why they\u2019re after me now,\u201d he insists.\n\n\u201cThe government doesn\u2019t have any evidence against me. But don\u2019t take my word for it. You\u2019re a journalist,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go investigate the [authorities\u2019] charges against me for yourself?\u201d\n\nTurns out an investigation into the state\u2019s charges against Gordo Sierra reveals as much about the shady nature of Mexican law enforcement as it does the Viagras\u2019 leader.\n\nNeither the military nor official police spokespeople will share intel on El Gordo, despite repeated requests for information.\n\nFinally the state DA\u2019s office tells The Daily Beast that Sierra and his brothers are wanted on narcotics trafficking, kidnapping, and multiple murder charges\u2014including the killing of infamous crime boss Carlos Rosales, who ran a rival cartel called La Familia Michoacana, and who was gunned down last December.\n\nBut not all law enforcement officers agree with the DA\u2019s stance. A member of the Michoac\u00e1n state police force, who agreed to be quoted only under the condition of anonymity, since he wasn\u2019t authorized to speak to the press\u2014backs up El Gordo\u2019s claims of relative innocence.\n\n\u201cThe Viagras are vigilantes, and maybe they\u2019ve committed wrongful acts under the name of fighting crime\u2014but that doesn\u2019t make them criminals themselves. From my perspective, the group is clean,\u201d the officer said. \u201cBut not everybody in the fiscalia [The DA\u2019s office] sees it that way.\u201d\n\nOthers in Michoac\u00e1n take a dimmer view of the Viagras\u2019 handiwork:\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re carrying weapons illegally\u2014doesn\u2019t that by definition make them criminals?\u201d says Lydia Gonz\u00e1lez, a radio host in the state capital of Morelia, who\u2019s been covering the crime beat in Michoac\u00e1n for three decades. \u201cAuthorities asked them to turn in their arms, and they refused. That automatically makes the group illegal,\u201d she says.\n\nGonz\u00e1lez fully acknowledges El Gordo\u2019s point that the government \u201cbetrayed and abandoned\u201d the autodefensa movement\u2014but she says that doesn\u2019t excuse the group\u2019s current actions.\n\n\u201cThey behave like criminals,\u201d she says, \u201cor like insurgents. They assault people and steal cars and kidnap for ransom. The only reason they seem to have so much support [in the community] is because people are afraid to speak out against them.\u201d\n\nDuring the five hours I spend at his hideaway, El Gordo shows himself to be a surprisingly astute critic of culture and politics. He tells me he recently watched the film Cartel Land\u2014and even brags about having participated in the production of the Oscar-nominated documentary\u2014but was disappointed with the final results, which he saw as painting an unfairly negative picture of the vigilante movement.\n\nHe also says the film led to reprisals in the criminal underworld, including the killing of the police officer shown speaking into the camera and cooking meth during the opening and closing scenes.\n\nEl Gordo likewise speaks out against current Republican front-runner Donald Trump, calling him \u201ca modern Hitler\u2014but intelligent.\u201d He likens Trump to the leader of a criminal cartel, in that he uses his ill-gotten wealth to gain political influence.\n\nLike any mafia honcho, Sierra says, The Donald is only as strong as those who back him.\n\n\u201cTrump is just a puppet,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t blame him\u2014I blame his followers.\u201d\n\nWith the sun starting to go down, El Gordo\u2019s men build up their cook fires against the coming night.\n\nBeing wanted by both officials and Knights Templar splinter groups means Sierra and his men are always on the move\u2014often sleeping in small tents, or in the cabs of their 4x4 trucks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to have a normal life,\u201d El Gordo says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to have to wear a pistol all the time. And I\u2019d like to live again in my own house, with my wife and children\u2014instead of sleeping out here with the mosquitos.\u201d\n\nBefore you take your leave of the outlaw leader, you ask him what he thinks is the solution to the violent crime still plaguing Michoac\u00e1n.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that the wealthy and powerful have made it so that there are no resources available to improve people\u2019s lives,\u201d he says, sounding more like a Mexican Bernie Sanders than a warlord with a price on his head.\n\n\u201cThe government takes in taxes but keeps them all for itself. Michoac\u00e1n is a rich land\u2014so why is there so much poverty here? Why do the poor suffer and go hungry? The level of government corruption has gone past its limits,\u201d El Gordo says.\n\nAnd, at least on this theme, WOLA\u2019s Meyer agrees with the Viagras\u2019 headman:\n\n\u201cThe Mexican government should work with citizens to better identify members of organized criminal groups operating in their communities and corrupt politicians working in collusion with these groups,\u201d says Meyer, who also calls for \u201cefforts to strengthen the professionalization and accountability of Mexico\u2019s police forces and its capacity to successfully prosecute and sanction criminal acts.\u201d\n\nRadio journalist Gonz\u00e1lez has an even simpler solution:\n\n\u201cThe best way to fight crime in Michoac\u00e1n,\u201d she says, \u201cis with employment.\u201d\n\nYour handler warms up the bullet-riddled car that will take you back to the same dusty plaza\u2014back to your phone, and the relative safety of your hotel. Before you depart, the outlaw commander gives you a last dry, parting handshake.\n\n\u201cThe fiscal\u00eda says I\u2019m an enemy of the people\u2014but the people know better,\u201d El Gordo says.\n\n\u201cThey know their real enemy is the government itself.\u201d", "description": "During a meeting in his hidden basecamp, one of Mexico\u2019s most wanted warlords talks drugs, corruption, and life on the run.", "authors": ["Jeremy Kryt"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1439,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1492115018/articles/2016/03/12/meet-the-warlord-of-the-viagras-mexico-s-hardest-cartel-yet/160311-kryt-cartel-land-tease_dxqkh9", "published_at": "2016-03-12"}
