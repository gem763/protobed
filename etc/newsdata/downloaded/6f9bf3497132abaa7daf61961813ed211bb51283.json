Absolutely not.'\n\nBiden, in the interview added that he didn\u2019t discuss his business dealings in Ukraine with his father, other than one brief exchange in which his father told him 'I hope you know what you\u2019re doing.'\n\nBiden and a business associate were paid for 'consulting services' by Burisma, one of Ukraine's largest natural gas companies\n\nA lawyer for Hunter Biden didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nJoe Biden has also denied any wrongdoing, saying he called for the removal of then-chief prosecutor Viktor Shokin in 2016 because of his ineffectiveness in tackling corruption in Ukraine, a widespread problem that both the United States and the European Union had long highlighted.\n\nA spokesman for Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign, Andrew Bates, said: 'Donald Trump is so terrified of running against Joe Biden that he sent his presidency into a tailspin by trying to blackmail Ukraine into intervening in our elections with universally-debunked lies.'\n\nBurisma and Zlochevsky didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn an interview with Reuters in September, former Ukraine prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko said Hunter Biden\u2019s position on the board when his father was vice-president raised no red flags. 'From the point of view of Ukrainian law, (Hunter Biden) didn\u2019t violate anything,' Lutsenko said.\n\nUkraine\u2019s new general prosecutor Ruslan Ryaboshapka, who took over in August, said he was not aware of any wrongdoing by Hunter Biden.\n\nHis office announced on October 4 that it was reviewing 15 previous investigations related to Zlochevsky but no decision had been taken on how to proceed against him or people related to him.\n\nThe White House declined to comment.\n\nZlochevsky, who founded Burisma in 2002, served as a minister under Ukraine\u2019s then-President Viktor Yanukovich from 2010 to 2012.\n\nBurisma then began adding high-profile names to its board, including Biden and a business associate of his called Devon Archer, in April 2014.\n\nThe company has said it had wanted to strengthen corporate governance.\n\nAccording to two sources close to the company, Burisma was also looking to attract international investment as well as expand overseas.\n\nOleksandr Onyshchenko, a businessman and former member of the Ukrainian parliament who knows the Burisma founder, said it had been Zlochevsky\u2019s idea to appoint Biden as a director.\n\n'It was to protect (the company)' at a time when it was facing investigations, said Onyshchenko, who left the country in 2016.\n\nBiden's arrangement with Burisma took place at the time his father, Joe Biden (above), was vice president\n\nIn the run up to Biden\u2019s appointment, a popular uprising led to the removal of the Russian-backed Yanukovich in February 2014.\n\nBiden, a trained lawyer, had served on the board of a U.S. company and had also formed an investment firm with fellow Yale graduates Archer and Christopher Heinz, the stepson of former Secretary of State John Kerry.\n\nAccording to four sources close to the company, Biden regularly attended Burisma\u2019s twice annual board meetings \u2013 all of which were held outside of Ukraine.\n\nA source close to the company said Biden took part in strategic conversations and shared his opinions and experience.\n\nIn between board meetings, 'there were constant calls, dialogue, sharing of advice, consideration of different options,' the source said.\n\n'Expansion to other markets was also discussed,' the source added.\n\nAnother source close to Burisma said Biden assisted with analysis of oil and gas assets the company was considering buying abroad, though a deal didn\u2019t go through.\n\nThe company was considering possible acquisitions in Europe, Kazakhstan and the United States, the source and another person close to Burisma said.\n\nBoth sources said that around the time Biden was appointed, Burisma was also looking to secure a financing deal with foreign investment funds, including one in the United States.\n\nBiden helped to find lawyers to work on this process, before it broke down due to the start of the war in east Ukraine, one of those two sources said.\n\n'He was a ceremonial figure,' that person added.\n\nHow much Biden earned at Burisma has also become a central issue.\n\nTrump has portrayed Hunter Biden as having earned vast sums of money while at Burisma, which the president has suggested was an indication of potential wrongdoing.\n\nPresident Trump (above) and his supporters allege that Burisma's arrangement with Hunter Biden was corrupt\n\nIn an October 6 post on his usual Twitter account, Trump said Hunter Biden 'was handed $100,000 a month (Plus, Plus) from a Ukrainian based company, even though he had no experience in energy.'\n\nHe added, in the Twitter message, that it couldn\u2019t have been legitimate and as president he has 'an OBLIGATION to look into possible, or probably CORRUPTION.'\n\nAccording to payment records reviewed by Reuters that two former Ukrainian law enforcement officials say are Burisma\u2019s, the company paid about $3.4million to a company that was controlled by Archer called Rosemont Seneca Bohai LLC between April 2014 and November 2015.\n\nSpecifically, the records show 18 months in which two payments of $83,333 per month were paid to Rosemont Seneca Bohai for 'consulting services.'\n\nThe two sources said that one of those monthly payments was intended for Biden and one for Archer.\n\nReuters was not able to independently verify the authenticity of the documents or how much money Hunter Biden received.\n\nOne of the sources said prosecutors obtained the payment records in the course of one of their investigations into Burisma related to activities at the company prior to Archer and Biden\u2019s appointments to the board.\n\nA Ukrainian lawmaker released copies of the records at a conference for news media last week.\n\nA lawyer for Archer didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nLutsenko, who succeeded Shokin as Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general in 2016, took over a tax investigation into Burisma before closing the case ten months later, after the company had paid a settlement in relation to the tax investigation.\n\nThe former prosecutor said that any issues Burisma did have were not related to Biden. In addition to the closed tax investigation, Ukraine authorities opened an investigation into licenses awarded to Burisma and a separate money-laundering probe into founder Zlochevsky.\n\nBoth of these have been re-opened in recent months, but neither relate to the period after Biden joined the board.\n\nBurisma and Zlochevsky haven\u2019t commented publicly on the re-opened probes.", "description": "During his time on the board of Burisma, Hunter Biden (above), the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, was regarded as a helpful non-executive director, according to people in the know.", "authors": ["Ariel Zilber For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/23/19939226-0-image-a-4_1571523801993.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
