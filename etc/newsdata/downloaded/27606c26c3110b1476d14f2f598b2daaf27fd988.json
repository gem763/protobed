History is on our side.\"\n\nSanders also said he thought, \"Yeah, I've had a rough week. I've suffered adversity and that's true and I don't wish anybody to have a heart attack and get scared the way that our family did.\" But he added that many people are dealing \"with a lot more pain than I am\" including homelessness, working multiple jobs but not making enough money to pay the bills or forgoing college because of fears about being overwhelmed by debt.\n\nIn this image taken from video, Democratic presidential candidate Sen.

His staff initially said the stents were inserted for a blocked artery, revealing only two days later that he had had a heart attack.\n\nSanders took his message directly to supporters in the video after saying he \"misspoke\" when he previously suggested he may slow his campaigning pace after his health scare. Sanders backtracked in a Wednesday interview with NBC News just a day after indicating that health could force him to change \"the nature\" of his campaign and perhaps to not do so many events per day - in the short term, at least.\n\nOne of his national co-chairs, Nina Turner, seemed to back up that original sentiment, though, saying in a Tuesday interview with The Associated Press that the campaign was examining where and how to make changes to reflect concerns about Sanders' health.\n\nThe focus on Sanders' health comes as age plays a significant role in the 2020 presidential campaign. Should Sanders win the Democratic presidential nomination, he would be the oldest person ever elected. So would his 76-year-old Democratic rival, former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Sen.
