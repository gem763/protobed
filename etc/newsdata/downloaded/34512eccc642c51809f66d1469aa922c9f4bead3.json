REUTERS/Michael Dalder/File Photo\n\nSpot gold was flat at $1,489.77 per ounce as of 0428 GMT. U.S. gold futures dipped slightly to $1,493.20.\n\nAsian shares edged higher, limiting bullion\u2019s gains, with MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan up 0.2%.\n\n\u201cThe markets are quite long, and people are worried about the trade war. Investors are waiting for pull backs in gold to step in again,\u201d AxiTrader market strategist Stephen Innes said.\n\n\u201cWhat has been supportive for gold are recessionary fears, and provided that remains in the headlines, it is a significant reason to stay long gold. Right now, there is no major catalyst to drive it any direction.\u201d\n\nThe long-standing Sino-U.S. trade war has taken a toll on economies around the world with Japan\u2019s exports down for a 10th straight month, and South Korean exports plunging 19.5% over the first 20 days of October.\n\nIn China, new home prices grew at a steady pace in September, a relief for policymakers who remain wary of high debt and bubble risk, and are refraining from stimulating the sector as the economy cools.\n\nProviding little comfort to market sentiment, British Lawmakers on Saturday voted to withhold a decision on Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s deal, a move that forced him to seek from the EU a third postponement of Britain\u2019s departure from the bloc.\n\nThe vote for an extension dealt a blow to optimism that a deal agreed last week would ensure Brexit happens with little economic disruption.\n\nAmong other precious metals, silver rose 0.1% to $17.56 per ounce, and platinum dipped 0.2% to $887.40.\n\nMeanwhile, palladium gained 0.7% to $1,767.00 an ounce, slightly lower than a high of $1,783.21 it struck on Thursday.\n\n\u201cSell rates for palladium reached the highest level since January. This suggests the recent rally has been driven by fundamentals, rather than speculative interest,\u201d ANZ Bank said in a note.\n\n\u201cAnd with the market likely to remain tight for the foreseeable future, we believe there is plenty more upside for (palladium)prices.\u201d", "description": "Gold prices were unchanged on Monday, as investors stayed on the sidelines awaiting more clarity on U.S.-China trade negotiations and a delay to a crucial vote on a deal on Britain's exit from the European Union.", "authors": ["Karthika Suresh Namboothiri", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443191645&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K051", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
