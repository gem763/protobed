We need to be more aggressive.\"\n\nBut critics claim the threats are more style than substance - and are actually about projecting a hardman image to Tory voters ahead of an election.\n\nSo what are the facts behind what's been suggested today?\n\nWe looked at the EU's rules to find out - and called on Prof Anand Menon, director of the \"non-partisan and impartial\" UK in a Changing Europe think tank, for a little advice.\n\nA rogue Commissioner\n\n(Image: Avalon.red)\n\nThe most eyebrow-raising claim is that Britain could appoint a renegade Commissioner to the EU to make life difficult.\n\nAnd some have backed giving the role to Nigel Farage.\n\nSelf-described Tory 'Brexit hardman' MP Steve Baker compared it to the film Armageddon.\n\n\"They land on the asteroid and they put a nuclear weapon into the heart of the asteroid. Nigel Farage is that nuclear weapon,\" he told the Telegraph.\n\nCan Boris Johnson nominate Nigel Farage as Commissioner?\n\n(Image: STEPHANIE LECOCQ/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nTechnically, yes - if he wants the job, that is.\n\nThe UK must nominate a new EU Commissioner to represent our country from November 1.\n\nPreviously, the UK idea had been to refuse to nominate one.\n\nBut Prof Menon claims the EU could simply \"take us to court\" if we don't - so now the thinking seems more about appointing a thorn in the EU's side.\n\nBut can the EU block it?\n\n(Image: Christopher Furlong)\n\nYes.\n\nEach country's EU Commissioner goes through a vetting process which includes an evaluation drawn up by a committee of the European Parliament.\n\nThe President of the Parliament than puts the full list of Commissioners to a vote in the European Parliament - where Nigel Farage has spent 20 years making himself an enemy of Europhiles.\n\nFrom there, it needs to be adopted by at least 16 of the 28 EU leaders on the European Council - representing at least 65% of the EU's population - using a \"qualified majority\".\n\nProf Menon is sceptical Nigel Farage will get the job - and thinks the idea is more about newspaper headlines.\n\nHe said: \"It\u2019s a little bit in keeping with the way this government has acted, which is a lot of sound and fury [in public] while actually doing something a little bit different [in private].\n\n\u201cIt would be good for the visuals, I think, in terms of showing Boris Jonhson\u2019s credentials. The problem is there are many, many people in the Parliamentary Conservative Party who would be deeply opposed to anything like an explicit or implicit deal with Nigel Farage.\n\n\u201cThe danger for Boris Johnson is he loses what\u2019s left of his support by doing that, or it splits.\u201d\n\nThe EU Budget\n\n(Image: PA Wire/PA Images)\n\nThe other big claim is that Boris Johnson could block the EU's long-term budget - which runs from 2021 to 2027.\n\nThe 'Multiannual Financial Framework' (MFF) is due for agreement next spring - and sets the maximum amount the EU can spend in different areas over at least five years.\n\nCan Boris Johnson veto the EU's long-term Budget?\n\n(Image: OLIVIER HOSLET/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nTechnically, yes.\n\nThe 2021-27 MFF must be passed unanimously by 28 EU leaders in European Council. This means any one leader could, in theory, wield a veto.\n\n(Separately it must also be adopted by at least 376 MEPs - half of the total number of members in the European Parliament, even if some of them are absent or abstain.)\n\nThis is different to the EU's annual budget. That only needs approving by a qualified majority on the European Council - at least 16 nations representing at least 65% of the total EU population.\n\nBut will it actually happen?\n\n(Image: Wikimedia Commons)\n\nProf Menon says he's \"sceptical\". He told us the issue is only likely to come to a crunch in April or May - later than March, which is the date mooted in today's reports.\n\nBy this point, of course, we're meant to be out of the EU. Even under the 'Benn Act', Boris Johnson is only being asked to delay Brexit until January 31.\n\nAnd we can only veto the Budget if we're still a member of the European Council - something that ceases when we leave the EU.\n\nProf Menon said he \"can\u2019t see us getting an extension now\" that would take the UK to April. If it did come, it would come later, he suggested.\n\nHe added patience \u201cwill start running out\u201d within the EU if Britain uses its lingering membrship to stick a spanner in the Budget - leading to us leaving the EU more quickly.\n\n\u201cI suspect that by the time we get close to the Budget, the EU will say \u2018sort this out - either you\u2019re staying or you\u2019re leaving\u2019,\" he said.", "description": "Allies of Boris Johnson have made some hair-raising threats to 'sabotage' the EU over Brexit.
