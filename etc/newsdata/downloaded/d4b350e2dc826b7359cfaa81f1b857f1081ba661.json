We have to start looking for a new News Outlet. Fox isn\u2019t working for us anymore!\u201d the president tweeted Wednesday.\n\nDuring the closing monologue of his show, Mr. Cavuto disregarded Mr. Trump\u2019s claim, saying Fox News gives him \u201cpretty fair coverage\u201d and reminding the president: \u201cWe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the president watches Fox. I also think he\u2019s getting sick of Fox, which is weird because I think he gets pretty fair coverage on Fox, but the president making clear to fact-check him is to be all but dead to him and his legion of supporters, who let me know, in no uncertain terms, I am either with him totally or I am a never-Trumper fully,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, Mr. President, we don\u2019t work for you. I don\u2019t work for you. My job is to cover you, not fawn over you or rip you, just cover you. Call balls and strikes. Our job is to keep score, not settle scores,\u201d Mr. Cavuto said.\n\n\u201cIn my case, to report the economic numbers when they\u2019re good and when they\u2019re bad. But when the markets are soaring and with her tumbling. When trade talks looking they\u2019re coming together, and when they look like falling apart. It\u2019s called being fair and balanced, Mr. President,\u201d Mr. Cavuto said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re entitled to your point of view, Mr. President, but you\u2019re not entitled to your own set of facts,\u201d the host finished.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
