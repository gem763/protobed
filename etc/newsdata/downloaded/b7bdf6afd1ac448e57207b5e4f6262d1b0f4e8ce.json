Sun Valley media conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, U.S., July 10, 2019. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\n\nThree months ago, Facebook announced plans to launch a digital currency in June 2020, in partnership with other members of the Libra Association set up by the U.S. tech giant to manage the project.\n\nWhen asked whether Apple would follow suit, Cook told Les Echos daily newspaper it was not on his agenda.\n\n\u201cNo. I really think that a currency should stay in the hands of countries. I\u2019m not comfortable with the idea of a private group setting up a competing currency,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cA private company shouldn\u2019t be looking to gain power this way.\u201d\n\nFacebook\u2019s attempt to drag cryptocurrencies into the mainstream has since met with regulatory and political scepticism globally, with France and Germany pledging to block Libra from operating in Europe.\n\nFacebook\u2019s move led analysts to speculate whether other large technology companies such as Apple, which has a range of financial services such as a credit card and phone-based payment system, would similarly launch digital currencies.\n\nThat speculation grew in September when an Apple executive told CNN Business that Apple was \u201cwatching\u201d cryptocurrency.\n\nCook appeared to put that notion to rest on Thursday.\n\n\u201cCurrency, like defence, needs to stay in the hands of countries, that\u2019s the heart of their mission,\u201d Cook said.\n\n\u201cWe elect our representatives to assume their governmental responsibilities. Companies aren\u2019t elected and should not be going in this direction.\u201d", "description": "Apple Inc Chief Executive Tim Cook has weighed in against launching an Apple cryptocurrency, saying in remarks published on Thursday that companies should not be trying to gain power by establishing competing currencies.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436812517&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF921RA"}
