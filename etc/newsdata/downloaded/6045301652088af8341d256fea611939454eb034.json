(Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)\n\nJay Gruden stood on the sideline late in another \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d drubbing for the Washington Redskins, arms crossed, lips pursed, staring blankly toward the field. An already extremely warm seat turned white hot in a 31-15 loss to the Chicago Bears that dropped the team to 0-3.\n\nTwo people with knowledge of the situation said after Monday\u2019s loss that Gruden\u2019s job is safe this week, but questions about the defensive staff will once again be a topic of conversation after Washington gave up 30-plus points for the third game in a row. There were already calls for defensive coordinator Greg Manusky\u2019s job last week, and the team appeared to consider making a change this offseason before eventually deciding to keep him in the role for a third season.\n\n\u201cThe coaches can put us in the perfect position, but if we don\u2019t make the play, so be it,\u201d defensive lineman Jonathan Allen said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a coach win us a game. \u2026 Coaches can do all they want to, but if the players don\u2019t execute, it really doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nThe Redskins struggled to get off the field for the third straight week and allowed the Bears to convert eight of 13 third downs. Chicago quarterback Mitchell Trubisky failed to throw a touchdown pass in the first two weeks but had three Monday and posted a 116.5 passer rating. The Bears scored touchdowns on all three second-quarter possessions, and boos poured out of the stands at halftime with the Redskins trailing 28-3.\n\nThe defense was supposed to be the strength of this Washington team, but that hasn\u2019t happened through three weeks. Continued criticism from fans is certain, and changes could be coming.\n\n\u201cI felt like there was some effort there, some physicality this week,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cThere\u2019s still a couple things coverage-wise there in the red zone that we have to get cleaned up. \u2026 But effort-wise, tenacity, I felt a little bit better. But we have to be more productive.\u201d\n\n[Svrluga: At 0-3, it\u2019s time to ask what this Redskins season is even about?]\n\nThe Haskins hype isn\u2019t going away\n\nThe questions from fans and media members over when the Redskins would turn to rookie quarterback Dwayne Haskins ramped up Sunday afternoon after New York Giants rookie quarterback Daniel Jones led a thrilling come-from-behind win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Observers suddenly had visions of Haskins doing the same in Washington.\n\nAs things got ugly in the first half against Chicago, the calls for Haskins began pouring down from the stands. Case Keenum, who had been solid in two starts, had a rough outing, throwing a pick-six to Ha Ha Clinton-Dix on the team\u2019s first possession, losing a fumble on the fourth and throwing an interception to cornerback Kyle Fuller on the fifth. He then had another interception on a throw into triple coverage on the opening possession of the second half.\n\nEven though he led a nice comeback attempt, that too ended in a turnover, when Keenum fumbled while stretching the ball out in an attempt to convert a fourth-and-one play. The quarterback finished 30 for 43 for 332 yards and two touchdowns, three interceptions and three fumbles, including two lost.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all on me,\u201d Keenum said. \u201cI let my team down.\u201d\n\nThe team is now 0-3, but Gruden said there wouldn\u2019t be a change at quarterback this week, while acknowledging that Keenum had \u201ca couple bad decisions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe most important thing is we have to have some continuity,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cI can\u2019t be changing people every five minutes, here. \u2026 If I didn\u2019t think we had a chance to get better, then I would make a change. I feel like Case has the tools to become a very efficient quarterback in this offense and get us some victories here moving forward.\u201d\n\nMcLaurin again provides lone bright spot\n\nThere was one clear bright spot for the Redskins during Monday\u2019s loss: the play of rookie wide receiver Terry McLaurin. The third-round pick out of Ohio State had the play of the game for the home team with a 15-yard touchdown in the third quarter, showing off his strong hands to keep the pass from a defender swiping down on the ball. He also had a key fourth-down conversion while the team was trying to rally in the fourth quarter.\n\nIn catching six passes for 70 yards and a touchdown, McLaurin became the first player in NFL history with at least five catches and a touchdown in each of his first three games. He has clearly become the most trusted wideout on the roster and looks to be a potential building-block player.\n\nRead more on the Washington Redskins:\n\nRedskins fall into four-touchdown hole against Bears, lose, 31-15, to drop to 0-3\n\nBiggest moments from the Redskins\u2019 loss to Chicago\n\nRedskins remain uncertain as to when tight end Jordan Reed will return\n\nBooger McFarland on Redskins defense, \u2018iconic\u2019 FedEx Field and Bruce Allen\n\nEreck Flowers knows he has a long way to go, but he\u2019s enjoying football again\n\nCase Keenum is part of the solution, but the Redskins\u2019 problem might be too big", "description": "Washington's questions at quarterback and on the coaching staff aren't going away, but one rookie continues to star.", "authors": ["Kareem Copeland", "Reporter Covering The Washington Redskins", "September At Am", "Kareem Copeland Is The Post'S Washington Redskins Beat Writer.
