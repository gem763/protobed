While most cases have been in the capital, Oslo, the illness has been reported in 14 of the country\u2019s 18 counties, including the far north.\n\nAccording to the Swedish newspaper GT, a dog in neighbouring Sweden was also being treated in a veterinary hospital after appearing at a show in the Norwegian city of Trondheim last week. All dog shows in Norway were cancelled this weekend.\n\nThe Norwegian Kennel Club said owners were so concerned about the spread of the illness over the weekend that its website crashed under the weight of demands for information. There are an estimated 500,000-600,000 dogs in Norway.\n\nHow canines capture your heart: scientists explain puppy dog eyes Read more\n\nThe undiagnosed sickness was clearly \u201cvery serious for dogs\u201d, a food safety authority spokesman, Ole-Herman Tronerud, told the public broadcaster NRK. \u201cBut we don\u2019t yet know whether this is contagious, or just a series of individual cases.\u201d\n\nThe emergency and safety director of the Norwegian veterinary institute, Jorun Jarp, said it was \u201cnaturally alarming to have healthy Norwegian dogs dying so quickly. This is a very special situation; I haven\u2019t been in involved in anything like it before.\u201d\n\nThe institute said it had ruled out salmonella and rat poison, and also did not believe the illness \u2013 which causes severe vomiting and acute bloody diarrhoea \u2013 was due to something in the dogs\u2019 food.\n\n\u201cWe have seen that many different types of feed have been used in the dogs that are autopsied, and have no reason to believe that it is the cause of one specific feed,\u201d Jarp said. \u201cWe are investigating possible viral, bacterial, fungal and parasitic causes.\u201d\n\nA veterinary pathologist, Hannah J\u00f8rgensen, told the broadcaster authorities were working systematically and as fast as possible, but the job was \u201cdifficult because we have so far not found any obvious common features from our laboratory analyses\u201d.\n\nThe dogs that have fallen ill and died came from \u201cmany different places in the country, and they have been drinking and eating different things\u201d, J\u00f8rgensen said. \u201cAt the moment we have no clear test results and so no firm conclusion.\u201d", "description": "Owners told to keep pets away from other canines after sickness found in 14 of 18 counties", "authors": ["Jon Henley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73658dd39bf0d9cbee60add383acd3edccef4955/0_74_5340_3205/master/5340.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c84a06ecccd60bec14b53bfb5d73f4f9", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
