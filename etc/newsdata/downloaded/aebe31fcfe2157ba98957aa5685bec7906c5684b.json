Authoritarian regimes and autocrats will never accept a power higher than their own. And that causes all sorts of assaults on human dignity. We must exercise our moral voice to confront them.\u201d\n\nHis audience included Vatican officials and ambassadors to the Holy See from many countries, including Callista Gingrich from the United States, gathered in the old synod hall of the Vatican. He told them that \u201cthe Holy See and the United States have had our differences over the years. Good people can disagree. But on the issues most fundamental, on the issues of human dignity and religious freedom, these issues that transcend everyday politics, on the enduring struggle of the individual\u2019s right to believe and worship, we must\u2014and I know we will\u2014march together.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was significant that Mr. Pompeo chose to open and close his speech by referring to the repression of religion in China, at this meeting co-sponsored by the U.S. State Department and the Vatican\u2019s Section for Relations with States of the Secretariat of State to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and the Holy See.\n\nIt is no secret that the United States was opposed to the signing of the provisional agreement between the Holy See and China on the nomination of bishops on Sept. 22, 2018. It made this abundantly clear to the Vatican prior to that historic event, as Archbishop Paul Gallagher, the Secretary for Relations with States, who was sitting beside Mr. Pompeo at the symposium, knows well.\n\nPompeo: \u201cMore than 80 percent of mankind lives in places where religious freedom is threatened or entirely denied and it\u2019s no coincidence that it has happened as unfree societies have proliferated.\u201d\n\nThat could be one of the reasons why Mr. Pompeo said, \u201cGood people can disagree\u201d and why later he \u201chumbly\u201d asked the Holy See to join the International Religious Freedom Alliance, \u201cthe first multilateral organization, multilateral body of its kind.\u201d The United States launched the alliance last July with the aim of making it \u201cthe premier body in the world for advancing the issues of religious freedom.\u201d Indeed, he asked, \u201cwhat could be more powerful than our voices all together, calling for the freedom to worship God?\u201d\n\nMr. Pompeo opened his speech at this symposium with a reference to the violations of religious freedom in China by recalling that in September at a gathering in New York, organized by the U.S. State Department and co-sponsored by Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, \u201cthree ethnic Uighurs took the stage\u2026. One of them was a woman named Zumrat Dawut.\u201d\n\nHe used her story to highlight religious repression in China and recalled that in April 2018, \u201cMrs. Dawut\u2014a 30-something, mother of three\u2014was summoned to the local police station in Xinjiang, China. She was shackled, interrogated and taken to an internment camp, where she was forced to recite Chinese propaganda and beaten for giving an ailing fellow prisoner her food.\n\n[Want to discuss politics with other America readers?

For worshipping her God. For exercising her conscience.\u201d He added that before her release \u201cshe was forced to renounce her faith and promise not to speak about what had happened to her. Chinese officials monitored her family and forced them to eat pork.\u201d\n\nHe said Mrs. Dawut \u201cwas one of the lucky ones, but she wasn\u2019t alone. God was with her. And America was with her, too. It\u2019s what we do, and it\u2019s who we are.\u201d\n\nHe went on to point out that \u201cmore than 80 percent of mankind lives in places where religious freedom is threatened or entirely denied.\u201d Moreover, he said, some 71 million people around the world \u201care displaced as refugees\u201d and \u201croughly 25 million people are caught in human trafficking,\u201d adding that \u201cit\u2019s no coincidence that it has happened as unfree societies have proliferated.\u201d\n\nBrownback said, \u201cWe\u2019re here to build a stronger partnership with the Vatican on religious freedom.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen the state rules absolutely, God becomes an absolute threat to authority,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said. He mentioned offenses against human dignity and religious freedom in other countries, including Cuba, Syria, Iran and Myanmar, and then returned to China, which \u201chas put more than a million Uighur Muslims\u2014Muslims like Mrs. Dawut\u2014in internment camps\u201d and also thrown Christian pastors in jail.\n\nHe called on the Holy See and other nations present to join the United States in the push for religious freedom, saying, \u201cWe must exercise our moral voice to confront them.\u201d\n\nArchbishop Gallagher in his speech touched equally on all three topics of the conference: the advancement of the fundamental right to religious freedom, combating the scourge of human trafficking and providing humanitarian assistance to the vulnerable and abused. Referring to religious freedom, he reminded his audience, \u201cI am of the opinion that the principal emphasis with regard to religious freedom should not be political or ideological. The main concern should be to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms effectively, and to promote peaceful coexistence and inclusive societies, in which people can express their beliefs freely without fear of being censored by the common discourse and where minorities are fully respected.\u201d\n\nThe archbishop and Mr. Pompeo left the symposium after delivering their speeches. Mr. Pompeo was received in a private audience by Pope Francis the following morning.\n\nAnother speaker, Sam Brownback, the U.S. ambassador at large for international religious freedom, also used tough words about repression of religion in China, when he spoke to journalists after delivering his speech.\n\nHe said the United States has been calling on the Chinese government \u201cto move away from this war on faith, all faiths\u201d and said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep pushing them on it.\u201d China is not only going against the United Nations standards on religious freedom, he said, but also \u201cagainst its own constitution.\u201d He confirmed that the United States is encouraging businesses to invest in countries \u201cwhere they don\u2019t have religious repression.\u201d\n\nMr. Brownback said, \u201cIt\u2019s not good for China to have a million Muslims in concentration; it is bad for them and I think they are feeling the pressure.\u201d He recalled that China was \u201cmoving to a more open society prior to Xi Jinping and had pretty open faith communities operating in the country,\u201d but not so today. \u201cIt\u2019s trending all wrong.\u201d\n\nAsked about the significance of Mr. Pompeo\u2019s focus on China\u2019s persecution of religion in his speech, Mr. Brownback said, \u201cwe are deeply concerned about what China is doing, and for me it\u2019s a top issue because it is very repressive and, second, they are using new technologies in the oppression.\n\n\u201cWe believe in many respects that the future oppression is not going to be people in jail but more people of faith marginalized in society. So you have a facial recognition system, a social credit score,\u201d he said, using the example of a Chinese citizen who attends a mosque and then has \u201cproblems in getting an apartment, traveling, going to schools.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re \u2018free,\u2019\u201d he said, \u201cbut you are not free because you cannot operate in society.\u201d Moreover, he said, \u201cthat system is starting to be exported to other autocratic repressive regimes,\u201d adding, \u201cThat\u2019s the thing we really want to head off.\u201d\n\nAsked if he would like to see Pope Francis and the Vatican more outspoken about the repression of religion in China, Mr. Brownback said, \u201cWe\u2019re here to build a stronger partnership with the Vatican on religious freedom.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t agree about everything, but on these three topics,\u201d he said, alluding to religious freedom, human trafficking and humanitarian assistance, \u201cwe very much agree.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWe want to build a much stronger partnership, more vibrant, more specific, more action-oriented in these three areas. There is a lot of room to run there and a lot of commonality of interest.\u201d\n\nHe said U.S. officials had come to the Vatican \u201cto enhance cooperation\u201d and, citing the example\u2014also used by Mr. Pompeo\u2014of how Pope John Paul II and Ronald Reagan worked together during the Cold War, he said, \u201cWhen the Vatican and the United States really cooperate on a topic, [they] can move heaven and earth.\u201d", "description": "Pompeo: \u201cMore than 80 percent of mankind lives in places where religious freedom is threatened or entirely denied and it\u2019s no coincidence that it has happened as unfree societies have proliferated.\u201d", "authors": ["Eve Tushnet", "John W.
