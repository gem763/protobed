The nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates them as either toss-ups or lean Democratic.\n\nMore broadly, Texas Republicans say the GOP can\u2019t rest on its laurels in a state that is growing more competitive.\n\n\u201cWe need all hands on deck and all Texans to pull together to make sure we don\u2019t let the Democrats put an end to the longest successful run in Texas history,\u201d said James Dickey, the chairman of the Texas Republican Party.\n\nTop Texas GOP fundraisers who are used to exporting campaign cash to more competitive races elsewhere are looking to keep donor money in-state this cycle.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of apathy and smugness and laziness here on the Republican side that\u2019s got to be reversed or there will be a shock to the system at some point,\u201d said George Seay, a Dallas businessman and top GOP fundraiser in Texas.\n\nDemographics are slowly but surely changing the state as an influx of voters from California and other left-leaning states move to Texas.\n\nGOP support is eroding in the suburbs surrounding Houston, Dallas, Austin and San Antonio, four of the nation\u2019s largest and fastest growing metro areas. That\u2019s particularly worrisome to Republicans leery of Trump\u2019s popularity with suburban voters.\n\nA Democrat has not won statewide in Texas since 1994, the longest such streak in the nation.\n\nBut Trump won Texas by only 9 points in 2016, the worst showing for a Republican presidential candidate in 20 years.

Democrats defeated longtime GOP incumbents in Houston and Dallas in 2018 and six other Republican House members won reelection by 5 points or fewer. Of those, Reps.

The reason Texas is not more purple is that rural Texas is still staunchly Republican. But the suburbs have changed, and so many of these races are just not a lock cinch for Republicans anymore.\u201d\n\nRepublicans are rushing to address the perception that they\u2019re predominately the party of older white men in an increasingly diverse state.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cDoing the kind of outreach that we need to be doing is on everyone\u2019s mind, from elected officials to the local county chairmen and the precinct chairs,\u201d said Brendan Steinhauser, an Austin-based GOP strategist. \u201cIt\u2019s time to follow through.\u201d\n\nTexas Republicans believe the Hispanic community is more receptive to the conservative message than many people realize.\n\nBut the party has a new problem: Polls indicate that the white women who voted for Trump in 2016 are abandoning him ahead of the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cWe have to address this head on,\u201d said Stacey Hock, the chairwoman of the Texas Republican Party\u2019s Victory Committee. \u201cWe have to talk to women about the things they care about \u2014 the economy, opportunity, justice, education, health care and security. We have the case to make, but we\u2019ve really fallen short in the past few cycles.\u201d\n\nThe GOP\u2019s statewide vote totals have been largely stagnant in recent elections, even as Democratic candidates for president and the Senate have steadily grown their share of the vote.\n\nIn the 2018 midterm elections, former Rep.

If we do what we need to do, we can ensure it was a dip. If we don\u2019t, it could be the start of a long-term trend.\u201d", "description": "AUSTIN, Texas \u2014 Texas Republicans are sounding the alarm as Democratic presidential candidates get ready for their debate next week in Houston, warning that the Lone Star State could become more purple if the party doesn\u2019t treat it as a 2020 battl", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/texasgop_090519hillillustration.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
