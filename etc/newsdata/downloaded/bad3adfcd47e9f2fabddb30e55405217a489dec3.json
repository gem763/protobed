A spokesman said: 'Chevrolet is a fantastic partner and we will continue to work with them to activate and maximise the sponsorship.' It is believed that Aon, the previous principal sponsors from 2010-2014, did not include any such stipulations.\n\nUnited have sacked three managers - David Moyes, Louis van Gaal and Jose Mourinho - during Chevrolet's association with them. Sportsmail reported that indifferent league performances have left GM bosses unimpressed with their heavy investment.\n\nChevrolet are only the fifth shirt sponsor in United's history and club officials are confident that their sixth will financially eclipse it.\n\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer's side have been struggling so far this season in the Premier League\n\nChevrolet's deal expires at the end of next summer and United are looking for a new sponsor\n\nA number of major brands have expressed interest already and executive vice chairman Ed Woodward will pump that money into squad improvement.\n\n'We are immensely proud of our partnership with Manchester United,' a Chevrolet spokesman said.\n\n'Since we became partners in 2012, the sponsorship has had a significant and positive impact on the Chevrolet business driving awareness for us in our key markets and has inspired and empowered millions of people through our activation programmes where the club is one of the most recognised brands.\n\n'We look forward to continuing to work together closely to activate and maximise the sponsorship.'", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Sportsmail has learned that the agreement signed in 2012, before Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement, included financial protection should United suffer an unthinkable relegation.", "authors": ["Jack Gaughan For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/22/20351270-0-image-a-43_1572389295642.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
