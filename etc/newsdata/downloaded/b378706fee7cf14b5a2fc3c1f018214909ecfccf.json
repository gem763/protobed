It\u2019s also the name of Air New Zealand\u2019s in-flight magazine.\n\nMatthew Tukaki, an executive member of the the Maori Council, called the trademark an \u201cabsolute disgrace \u201d in a video posted on Facebook (see it above). \u201cMaori is ours. You don\u2019t get to culturally misappropriate it for profit; you certainly do not get to trademark\u201d it, he said in an impassioned message.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had it with you. We\u2019ve had it with your stupid behavior,\u201d Tukaki said.\n\nLet's be clear @FlyAirNZ the NZ Maori Council opposes your trademarking of Kia Ora. It's cultural theft during #TeWikioteReoMaori and any other day. I am disgusted as are the vast majority of #maori. Apologise and withdraw. @TheAMShowNZ . I won't put up with brown box tickers. \u2014 Matthew Tukaki (@tukakimatt) September 11, 2019\n\nHe said if the airline didn\u2019t drop its plan he would call for a national Maori boycott of the airline.\n\nAir New Zealand said it only wants to trademark a logo of the phrase and not the phrase itself.\n\n\u201cWe have great respect for the Maori language,\u201d an airline spokesperson told Reuters in a statement.\n\n\u201cThis is simply about protecting the logo,\u201d she added. \u201cThe word \u2018kia ora\u2019 has been registered by a number of applicants to be used for a range of goods and services \u2015 dating back to 1992 \u2015 both in New Zealand and overseas.\u201d\n\nThe airline last clashed with the Maori over tattoos. It finally lifted restrictions barring visible tattoos for its workers, according to Reuters, following accusations that the policy discriminated against Maori people, who sometimes have visible tattoos on their arms, legs and faces.", "description": "\"You don\u2019t get to culturally misappropriate it for profit,\" said an angry member of the Maori Council in a video message.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7c84f5230000e903535001.png?cache=86meb8wefn&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
