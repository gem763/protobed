Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte is under pressure to explain his role, while former prime minister Matteo Renzi is suing for slander.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe awkward aspect is that the Italian government is being pulled against its volition into a quarrel between the Trump administration and its own intelligence service,\u201d said Alberto Castelvecchi, who has written about U.S. intelligence and is an adjunct professor at LUISS Guido Carli, a university in Rome.\n\nBarr has been tight-lipped about his travel to Italy, but, according to Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, he met in late September with the country\u2019s intelligence heads, in an arrangement approved by Conte.\n\nPeople familiar with the matter say Barr had developed particular interest in Joseph Mifsud, the professor, whom special counsel Robert S. Mueller III cited as the catalyst for the FBI probe into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nAD\n\nMifsud was known to boast about his international connections, particularly in Russia, and he allegedly told a onetime Trump campaign aide that Russia had \u201cdirt\u201d on Hillary Clinton in the form of thousands of emails.\n\nAD\n\nAn alternative account, though, has gained currency in the White House. That theory posits, despite the absence of supporting evidence, that Mifsud was actually a Western intelligence plant who was working to discredit the Trump campaign.\n\nTrump has raised questions about the professor, according to a White House official. And the president\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, is among those who have asserted a Western conspiracy.\n\nCorriere reported that Barr pressed Italy on whether it had helped Mifsud go dark \u2014 the professor disappeared from public view two years ago. The Daily Beast described the meeting in greater detail, citing an Italian Ministry of Justice source who said Barr and U.S. Attorney John Durham were played a taped deposition from when Mifsud allegedly applied for police protection. Two intelligence sources subsequently offered conflicting information to ANSA, an Italian news agency, saying that Mifsud had not requested protection.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the aftermath of Barr\u2019s visit, much of the focus in the Italian media has been on the role of Conte and whether he acted appropriately in handling a meeting that was supposed to be secret.\n\nConte did not give advance notice of Barr\u2019s visit to an oversight committee on intelligence. One Italian official familiar with the matter called the Barr visit \u201cunusual\u201d and said that although Rome and Washington routinely share sensitive matters, the exchanges take place between intelligence agencies \u2014 not with intelligence officials speaking to an attorney general.\n\n\u201cThis was a meeting of intelligence service and politics,\u201d said the official, who, like others in this report, spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the issues publicly.\n\nAD\n\nConte will soon appear before a parliamentary oversight committee, his spokesman said.\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, George Papadopoulos, the former Trump aide reportedly offered \u201cdirt\u201d by Mifsud, has turned into one of the top purveyors of the theory that Mifsud was part of a Western conspiracy.\n\nPapadopoulos \u2014 who served a brief prison stint for lying to the FBI while hindering the agents\u2019 ability to effectively question or detain Mifsud \u2014 has claimed that Mifsud was an \u201cItalian operative handled by the CIA.\u201d Papadopoulos also gave an interview to an Italian right-wing newspaper, describing a scenario in which then-President Barack Obama orchestrated Mifsud\u2019s counterintelligence activities, with the help of then-Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi. Papadopoulos does not mention Renzi in his book, \u201cDeep State Target.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nRenzi said in an interview with The Washington Post that he had filed a lawsuit against Papadopoulos for slander, asking for $1 million in damages. Link Campus University in Rome, where Mifsud had briefly worked, is also filing a suit from what its president called a \u201cgrave smear campaign\u201d against the school.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like a spy story to me as much as a third-class comedy,\u201d said Renzi, who was prime minister from 2014 until 2016. \u201cBut when faced with a third-class comedy that won\u2019t even make you laugh, one needs to react.\u201d\n\nRenzi said that \u201cwhatever the attorney general, Giuliani or others think, does not concern or interest me. Barack Obama\u2019s seriousness and rigor isn\u2019t up for debate as far as I\u2019m concerned, and I\u2019m ready to attest to that everywhere.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe president of Link University, Vincenzo Scotti, said in an email that he had not been contacted by Barr or by Durham, the U.S. attorney who has been appointed to investigate the probe into Russian interference in 2016.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely no \u2014 nobody, no authority, be it American or Italian, got in touch with us, not even indirectly, on the topic,\u201d said Scotti, a former Italian minister of foreign affairs.\n\nAD\n\nOne former senior government official said Mifsud didn\u2019t fit the profile of a spy for either side.\n\n\u201cThat this guy is acting as a dangerous spy, no matter whether to discredit Trump or to do him a favor,\u201d the official said. \u201cIt looks to be a little bit like fiction.\u201d", "description": "William Barr visited Italy to reportedly quiz intelligence officials about whether a professor was working against Trump.", "authors": ["Chico Harlan", "Rome Bureau Chief Covering Southern Europe", "Sometimes Parts Beyond", "Stefano Pitrelli"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/EQm_Y0YpHiHRw3zE5GTFM42N6mw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RKWKUZHLIII6TBOAQWQJRZD3G4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
