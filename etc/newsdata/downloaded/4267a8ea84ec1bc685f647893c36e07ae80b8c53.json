And that possibility is simply not permissible. Thus, impeachment is the only mechanism left to abort an eight-year Trump presidency\u2014on a purely partisan vote to preclude an election, and thus contrary to the outlines of impeachment as set out by the Constitution.\n\nConsider it another way: Why is it that the House is controlled by Democrats, yet its leadership is not pushing through any of the policy proposals voiced so openly on the Democratic primary stage?\n\nWhy aren\u2019t progressive representatives introducing bills to pay reparations to African Americans, to legalize infanticide in some cases of late-term abortion, to offer free medical care to illegal aliens, to confiscate AR-15s, to extend Medicare for all, to impose a wealth tax and raise top rates to between 70 and 90 percent, to abolish student debt and ensure free college for all, or to grant blanket amnesty to those currently living in the country illegally?\n\nSimple answer: none of those issues poll anywhere near 50 percent approval. And no Democratic candidate would expect to beat Trump as the emissary of such an agenda.\n\nIf the economy was in a recession, if we were embroiled in another Iraq-like or Vietnam-sort of war, and if Trump\u2019s polls were below 40 percent, then the Democrats would just wait 13 months and defeat him at the polls.\n\nBut without a viable agenda and because they doubt they can stop Trump\u2019s reelection bid, they feel they have no recourse but to impeach. If Trump were to be reelected, not a shred of Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cfundamental transformation\u201d would be left, and the strict constructionist Supreme Court would haunt progressives for a quarter-century.\n\nWhy Impeachment Now?\n\nThe Democrats have exhausted every other mechanism for destroying Trump\u2014and they are running out of time before November 2020 election.\n\nThink of what we have witnessed since the 2016 election. Do we even remember charges that voting machines in the 2016 election were rigged, and the efforts to subvert Electoral College voting, or to invoke the Logan Act, the emoluments clause, and the 25th Amendment?\n\nThe \u201ccollusion\u201d and \u201cobstruction\u201d fantasies of the Mueller investigation now seem like ancient history. So do the James Comey leaks, the palace coup of Andrew McCabe, the Trump tax records, the celebrity rhetoric about blowing up, shooting, stabbing, burning and variously killing off the president of the United States\u2014along with the satellite frenzies of Stormy Daniels, Michael Avenatti, Charlottesville, Jussie Smollett, the Covington Kids, and the Kavanaugh hearings.\n\nWhat is left but to try the new \u201cUkraine collusion\u201d\u2014especially given three other considerations?\n\nFirst, volatile and always changing polls appearing to favor impeachment roughly reflect Trump\u2019s own popularity (or lack of same). Around 45-46 percent of Americans do not want him impeached and about the same or slightly more say they do.\n\nSecond, the hard left-wing of the party might not yet control all the Democrats, but it does not matter because they are clearly younger, more energized, and better organized. And they want something to show for all their social media and photo-op grandstanding, given their socialist agenda is mysteriously moribund.\n\nThird, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is said to oppose impeachment on pragmatic grounds, but I am not sure that is right. It\u2019s the equivalent of saying Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) was opposed to the progressive character assassination of Brett Kavanaugh. Neither is or was true.\n\nA better description would be that Pelosi and Feinstein simply go along with the perceived 51-plus percent surge of their party, and sit back gleefully watching the fireworks happen, willing to jump in or pull back depending on the atmospherics and polling. Impeachment, remember, will make the Kavanaugh hearings look like a seminar on etiquette, and so everything and anything can happen once dozens of unhinged leftists are unbound.\n\nBe prepared for a half-dozen Christine Blasey Ford-type witnesses to pop up, and 20 or so unhinged Cory Booker-esque \u201cI am Spartacus\u201d performance acts, along with a whole slew of new Steele dossiers\u2014all interspersed with breathless CNN bulletins announcing new fake news developments with \u201cthe walls are closing in\u201d and \u201cthe end is near\u201d prognostications. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) is already reading fantasies to the House Intelligence Committee and passing them off as the text of Trump\u2019s phone call to Ukraine\u2019s new president. Only after he was called on such absurdities did he describe his performance as a parody.\n\nFacts Won\u2019t Matter that Much\n\nThe Left is hellbent on impeachment and the absence of a case won\u2019t matter. They do not care if they will sow the wind and reap the whirlwind.\n\nIn the coming days, after all, we will probably learn that the whistleblower\u2019s \u201cSchiff dossier\u201d was prepared by ex-Lawfare-type lawyers in service to House Democrats, who just needed a vessel to pass off the hit as a genuine cry of the heart, rather than a scripted attack with all the Steele dossier/Mueller report/Comey memo fingerprints: classification obfuscations, footnotes to liberal media hit pieces, pseudo-scholarly references to court cases, and lawsuit-avoiding, preemptive disclaimers about not actually possessing firsthand knowledge of any of the evidence, prepped hearsay, supposition, and the subjunctive and optative mood composition.\n\nIn a sane world, the impeachers would worry their charges that Trump forced Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky to investigate his possible 2020 Democratic opponent Joe Biden might boomerang. After all, Trump never actually cut off Ukrainian aid. Nor did he outline a quid pro quo deal. Essentially he is accused of unduly asking a foreign president to clamp down on corruption in his midst going back to 2016. So what? Especially if there is something more to the strange antics of Hunter Biden and CrowdStrike.\n\nBiden\u2019s problems are not such thought crimes, but are confirmed by his own boasting: that he used the clout of the United States to help his own family financially, by threatening to cut off U.S. aid unless a Ukrainian state prosecutor looking into his own son\u2019s suspicious lobbying was fired within six hours. And in Biden\u2019s own words, \u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d he was fired.\n\nIn contrast, Trump might have been all over the map in his call, but he kept the aid to Ukraine coming without demanding the scalp of any Ukrainian official. In some sense, Trump\u2019s culpability boils down to one issue: progressives believe that in not-too-veiled a manner, he threatened a foreign government to start going after the Biden family without cause, whose patriarch Joe might be Trump\u2019s 2020 election opponent.\n\nThe other half of the country believes that what is material is not Biden\u2019s current transient electoral status (he is not now and may not be the Democratic nominee), but the fact that he was vice president of the United States when he used his office to threaten the loss of foreign aid to stop investigations of his son, who was using his father\u2019s position to further his own profiteering.\n\nGiven that Trump denies any quid pro quo and his call supports that fact, while Biden, on the other hand, openly brags that he made threats which made the Ukrainian to cave (\u201cin six hours\u201d), one can draw one\u2019s own conclusions.\n\nFor now, we await more documents\u2014with caveats that the canny Ukrainians, for their own self-interest, will predicate their release of information on the likelihood of which party will win the 2020 election.\n\nThe Left hints it has lots of incriminating documents outlining a quid pro quo threat; conservatives suspect that Ukrainian and legal documents will show the prosecutor was neither unethical nor uninterested in Hunter Biden, but was fired precisely because he was not corrupt and very much concerned with Biden.\n\nAs far as precedent, there is a good recent example. Barack Obama got caught promising to consider cuts in Eastern-European-based missile defense if Vladimir Putin would give him some room during his reelection campaign.\n\nTranslated into Adam Schiff\u2019s Mafiosi parody lingo: Putin would calm down on the international stage to make the U.S.-Russia \u201creset\u201d look good, Obama would then get rid of Eastern-European missile defense, and Obama would get reelected in 2012.\n\nAnd all three of those events transpired as planned\u2014one can surmise whether any of the three would have happened without Obama compliance with Russian conditions. Remember, Obama\u2019s quid pro quo was caught on a hot mic on the premise that what he said to Russian President Medvedev was never supposed to be heard. \u201cOn all these issues, but particularly missile defense, this can be solved,\u201d Obama said. \u201cBut it\u2019s important for him [Putin] to give me space . . . This is my last election. After my election I have more flexibility.\u201d\n\nOnce that understanding was excused, and the media was mute about such collusion, can any notion of collusion as a crime still exist?\n\nConspiracy Theories\n\nFinally, who are the winners in these impeachment psychodramas, both short-term and long-term?\n\nShort-term, Trump may lose traction due to the media frenzy. He lost some of his ongoing momentum that had recently seen his polls steadily creeping up. He gave a fine speech at the United Nations and sounded presidential in his talks with foreign leaders\u2014all overshadowed or now forgotten due to the impeachment psychodrama.\n\nTrump\u2019s critics have become emboldened, Left and Right. The Drudge Report has flip-flopped and is as anti-Trump as Vox or Slate. Many at National Review call for or anticipate impeachment without much regret. Likewise, some at Fox News\u2014Shepard Smith, Andrew Napolitano, and Chris Wallace\u2014are nonstop critics of Trump and hardly disguise their contempt.\n\nThe leftist media is on uppers, and completely ecstatic in moth-to-flame fashion, as if it were May 2017 again and Trump\u2019s demise was a day away.\n\nBecause Joe Biden faces far more legal exposure than Trump, he is mentioned (if even to contextualize and exonerate him) in every news account of Ukraine. Whether or not Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) or her erstwhile henchwoman, Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), was behind this gambit, does not matter. (Nothing much from either one had worked to slow down Biden in the last six months). Biden is simply not physically or mentally up to a year of cross-examination. And Hunter Biden is more unsteady than Joe and will thus be hard to locate.\n\nWe are starting to see the outlines of a progressive fantasy on the horizon: Biden will be sacrificed. The party will unite around Warren. The left-wing media narrative will be, \u201cWe took out one of our own, now it is your turn to depose Trump.\u201d Chaos overload for two or three weeks might keep Trump\u2019s polling low.\n\nLong-term, however, Trump wins.\n\nWe still have a number of government audits coming from Michael Horowitz, John Durham, and John Huber\u2014and the targets are not Trump. The Senate will not convict the president under any foreseeable circumstances. The full story of the whistleblower has not been told, but there are a lot of narratives to come about the sudden rules allowing hearsay, DNC involvement, and who knew far in advance about the complainant\u2019s writ. Once the Democratic debates continue, the candidates\u2019 screaming and hysterics return, and the impeachment hearings descend into a Kavanaugh-esque farce, the public will begin to get scared again by the Left\u2019s shrieking Jacobins. Schiff\u2019s \u201cparody\u201d is a small foretaste of what\u2019s to come. Voters soon will surmise that the only thing between their 401k plans and socialism is Donald J. Trump.\n\nWarren or her possible facsimile is a weaker candidate than even the enfeebled Biden. Her lack of viability will be of enormous advantage in NeverHillary-fashion to Trump. His fundraising, already ascendant, will hit the stratosphere. The idea that the new and old NeverTrumpers will be on the side of socialism will finally discredit them. Wall Street and Silicon Valley will keep trashing Trump, but privately write checks to stop Warren\u2019s wealth tax that would be only the beginning of her Venezuelization of America.\n\nSo if Trump\u2019s health holds out, if we don\u2019t have a recession, if there is not an optional war, and Trump endures the next few weeks of 360-degree, 24/7 targeting, 2020 will be far more favorable than ever imaginable for him.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://amgreatness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1177548088.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
