I\u2019m very thankful to have Rick as an owner and to be in this position with Ally that, \u2018Hey look, we\u2019re going to (sponsor the car). We want you as long as you want to drive.\u2019\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think many drivers get that opportunity. So I\u2019m so thankful for that. I want to keep racing. I\u2019d like to not race 38 times a year at some point in the next couple of years. I love racing in general. I love our sport. I want to be involved in our sport. I also love other types of racing. I\u2019ve got to balance family, the schedule and then some other goals that I have to complete in other series, too, at the same time and make a decision on all that within four to six months.\u201d\n\nJohnson said on Wednesday night\u2019s NASCAR America Motor Mouths that he remains interested in running IndyCar races on road courses.\n\nStory continues\n\nHe told Burton that he would make the decision with the input of Jeff Gordon (who hand-picked Johnson to drive for Hendrick); longtime friends such as Rick Johnson; his wife, Chandra and their two young daughters, Genevieve, 9, and Lydia, 6.\n\n\u201cMy kids, in this next phase of my life, need to have a seat at the table when we have that conversation. All that is going to be very difficult to communicate with a 6-year-old. I don\u2019t know how that\u2019s going to work out, but I want her to be a part of it.\n\nAnd of course, he also will rely on the advice of Hendrick, whom he has driven for since entering the Cup Series in 2002.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s like a dad, and everybody who has worked for him knows that,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIn some ways, that takes a lot of pressure off. In other ways, it puts pressure on.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big decision that I know he doesn\u2019t want to put unneeded pressure on me for, and I feel like through his experiences with drivers retiring, he doesn\u2019t want to push on a driver staying any longer than they feel like they want to, so I think we\u2019re in a good spot, and we\u2019ll just see where it ends up here. Hopefully, I can defer as long as I can and wait maybe nine months, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s really going to happen.\u201d\n\nProcessing the decision probably will be tabled until after the final five races of the 2019 season.\n\nJohnson said he is most focused on ending a 90-race winless drought that dates to June 4, 2017 at Dover International Speedway. He is encouraged that his qualifying and finishing averages are \u201cway up\u201d since the arrival of crew chief Cliff Daniels two months ago.\n\n\u201cI really feel like there aren\u2019t any big obstacles ahead of us,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cCliff has really brought me back up and has me so excited and so ready for each and every week, that I\u2019m in the best place I\u2019ve been mentally for years. So, absolutely, I am ready for this fight.\n\n\u201cI expect to win this year.\u201d\n\nJohnson, who has 83 career victories, missed the playoffs this year for the first time since NASCAR introduced the postseason structure in 2004. On Motor Mouths, he told Kyle Petty and Marty Snider about the lack of respect he feels he\u2019s received from playoff drivers (video below).\n\n\u201cI used to be feared on the track and there was a certain level of respect that took place,\u201d he said. \u201cThat hasn\u2019t been there in a couple of years. I\u2019ve been used up way more (by other drivers), and I\u2019ve let it slide. I\u2019m not where I should be. I get it.\n\n\u201cBut when my car is right, I expect that same respect back. And I\u2019m not getting that respect back. And I just have to go fight for it.\u201d", "description": "The seven-time champion says his team owner has 'hinted' about NASCAR career decisions but 'hasn't put the true pressure on me yet.'", "authors": ["Nate Ryan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/PgYMX4Ep0fWzeeemfdYVkA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7BXickA3xjOYN9TfBObujA--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/085a73ae9425c524286306523867129c", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
