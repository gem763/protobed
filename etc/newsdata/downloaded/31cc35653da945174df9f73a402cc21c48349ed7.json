Figures from the World Health Organization (WHO) reveal that half of the world still lacks access to essential health services. We simply cannot ignore these figures any longer.\n\nAccess to health care is now a major global health priority and a fundamental human right.\n\nThis week, heads of state, political and health leaders and policymakers will be having important discussions around universal health coverage at the 2019 United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) about how we eliminate the inequalities that exist in global access to care. It\u2019s hoped that the meeting will bring us all closer to achieving universal health coverage, a key target in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\n\nAccess to health care is now a major global health priority and a fundamental human right. Leaders around the world are looking into why it remains such a huge problem and how we can take effective action to expand UHC. In Europe, health systems face the challenge of aging populations, strained health care budgets and increasing demand \u2014 all inhibiting timely access to care. We must do something about this.\n\nEU access to care remains unequal, but essential\n\nDespite modernization, investment in health care systems and the presence of universal health coverage in most European countries, large differences exist in the availability, affordability, quality and speed of health care services. In Cyprus, for example, more than 20 percent of the population is not covered by the statutory health system, compared with just 5 percent in Hungary. Meanwhile, the OECD reports that, on average, Europeans with lower incomes are five times more likely to have problems accessing health care than wealthier ones.\n\nFinancial barriers, such as limited income and the high cost of health services, are the biggest reasons why health care needs remain unmet in the EU. Along with those of lower social economic status, the elderly, women and girls, and those with multiple chronic conditions, are most affected. Inequalities also stem from inconsistent investment in health systems, inadequate availability of services, particularly in rural areas, and problems attracting and retaining health professionals.\n\nThe answer lies in a profound digital transformation\n\nTo meet the 2030 target, we have just over a decade to implement universal health coverage. To bring about effective and lasting change, we need digital-led process and technologies; the health care challenges we face require a profound digital transformation. We have seen this in other areas, for example, information.\n\nFrom telehealth platforms that bring care closer to patients, to connected devices, smart technologies and digital innovations like these will speed up health care delivery and make it smarter, better and more affordable \u2014 putting patients at the center of care delivery \u2014 and will access the most vulnerable and hard- to-reach patients.\n\nTo ensure we are making true progress, the impact of the transformation needs to be measured against the quadruple aim: improved health experience; better health outcomes; improved staff experience; and lower care costs. Only by measuring change in this way, can we ensure that health care systems of tomorrow and the future truly become more efficient and effective.\n\nWe need a unified EU digital health care strategy focusing on data privacy and security, interoperability and the ethical use of AI.\n\nWe need a unified digital strategy\n\nDigitization is already shaping the future of health care. Philips 2019 Future Health Index data reveals 76 percent of health care professionals globally are using digital health records in their hospital or practice. But innovation on its own won\u2019t be enough. We need a unified EU digital health care strategy focusing on data privacy and security, interoperability and the ethical use of AI so that the data being created is accessible, exchangeable, well protected and usable \u2013 and is being applied towards actual results. In support of this, and as a member of the European Round Table of Industrialists, Philips recently pledged to accelerate Europe\u2019s own digitalization, data and artificial intelligence strategies.\n\nAI is an opportunity, but needs to be used ethically\n\nAs part of this, global leaders and the health care industry should view AI as an opportunity rather than a threat. Through AI-powered technologies and capabilities, we can bring together patient information, apply deep analytics to identify patterns, improve the accuracy of diagnoses, increase early intervention and help patients self-manage their health. However, we need to ensure the ethical use of AI, not only in EU member countries or the European Union but across the world. Policies should be in place to ensure everyone can access the same quality AI-solutions. Philips looks forward to contributing to debates on how we can collectively achieve this.\n\nWorking together to see real change\n\nPartnership and collaboration lie at the heart of the digital transformation and are key to achieving an AI-led, unified digital strategy. We can\u2019t tackle the challenges we face alone. Nor should we.\n\nTo truly spark digital health care revolution in Europe, private and public sector must work together across hospitals, clinics, towns, regions and borders. It will take bold and responsible leadership; new business models and innovative financing solutions; and greater interoperability of electronic health records, devices and information systems.\n\nAs important discussions and policy developments on universal health coverage continue to unfold in New York, we need universal health coverage and access to care to become a reality for everyone around the world, in every country \u2014 to help unlock the full potential of digital innovation and open up access to care.\n\nAuthors:", "description": "Pledge to accelerate Europe\u2019s digitalization, data and AI strategies", "authors": ["Henk Siebren De Jong", "Chief Of International Markets"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Picture-for-Politico_v2-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
