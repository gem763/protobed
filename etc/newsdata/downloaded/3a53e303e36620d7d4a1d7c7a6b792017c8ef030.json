(Picture: Channel 4)\n\nThe Circle have dealt one hell of a devilish twist with Jack and Beth becoming the first double dumping of the series \u2013 only for them to go back in as a new player.\n\nJack, who has been playing as himself, and Beth, who traded in her model looks for \u2018more approachable, girl next door persona\u2019 (whatever that means), came in at the same time, only to be eliminated two days later after failing to make an impression on the rest of the players.\n\nBut now in a twist, they\u2019re getting a new lease of life \u2013 as a 62-year-old dog lover named Joyce.\n\nAfter the public voted for them to remain in the game under a new persona, instead of a new couple who were going to come in as someone else.\n\nThe couple were given the opportunity after automatic elimination from the game for being the lowest ranked of all the players.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeeting each other face-to-face, Jack got a bit of a shock when he finally met \u2018Beth\u2019 \u2013 and she was a completely different person to the one in her photos.\n\nHow will the game react to Joyce? (Picture: Channel 4)\n\n\u2026Which is made even more awkward seeing as they were flirting the day before (but then again Jack flirts with everything).\n\nNow they\u2019ve moved into Richard Madeley\u2019s old flat, setting up home together for the foreseeable as the first ever pair to appear as one contestant on the show.\n\nMore: The Circle The Circle: Paddy tears up as he confides in Georgina about his cerebral palsy Woody turns detective with Ella on The Circle to sniff out any catfishing contestants What time is The Circle on Channel 4 tonight and what's the latest twist?\n\nCan they manage to evade detection and stay in the game a little longer this time?\n\nEven worse, are they going to be able to survive living in such close quarters without killing each other in the process?\n\nThe Circle continues tomorrow at 10pm on Channel 4.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
