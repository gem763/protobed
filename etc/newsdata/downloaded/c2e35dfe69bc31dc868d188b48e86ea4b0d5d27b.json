It had informed Moscow of the decision, it said.\n\nThe other diplomat, given 24 hours to leave on Tuesday, had departed from Bulgaria with his family, it said. Bulgaria had said on Tuesday it was taking the unusual step of expelling him after Moscow failed to comply with a request to recall him. [L8N27E5PD]\n\nRussia has not commented publicly on either case.\n\nBulgarian prosecutors said the expelled diplomat had held conspiratorial meetings with Bulgarians, including with a senior official with a clearance for classified information from the European Union and NATO, since September last year. [L8N27D4OP]\n\nBulgaria, a loyal ally of Moscow in Soviet times, is now a member of NATO and the European Union but still has close cultural and historic ties to Russia, which remains its biggest energy supplier.\n\nSofia did not join NATO and EU allies in expelling Russian diplomats over a nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy in England last year.", "description": "Bulgaria said on Wednesday it had declined a visa to the incoming defence attach\u00e9 at the Russian embassy in Sofia, a day after expelling another Russian diplomat over spying allegations.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
