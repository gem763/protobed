However, even that level is \u201csignificantly higher\u201d than that of biological females, the authors said.\n\nThey cited research demonstrating that \u201chealthy young men did not lose significant muscle mass (or power) when their circulating testosterone levels were reduced\u201d for 20 weeks to meet the IOC\u2019s guidelines.\n\nThe researchers also noted that \u201cindirect effects of testosterone will not be altered by hormone therapy.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor example, hormone therapy will not alter bone structure, lung volume or heart size of the transwoman athlete, especially if she transitions postpuberty, so natural advantages including joint articulation, stroke volume and maximal oxygen uptake will be maintained,\u201d they explained.\n\n\u201cWe conclude that the advantage to transwomen afforded by the IOC guidelines is an intolerable unfairness,\u201d stated the professors.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t furious about this, you should be. This person, born a male, plainly had an unfair advantage. It is an insult to fellow competitors who worked so hard to achieve success. Please don\u2019t defend this insanity in the name of tolerance & inclusion. https://t.co/48aeF3bqHO \u2014 Paul Embery (@PaulEmbery) October 20, 2019\n\nBodybuilding competitor and track/road race cyclist Victoria Hood told BBC Sport, \u201cThe science is clear.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt tells us that trans women have an advantage, and the world record has just been broken today by somebody born male who now identifies as female,\u201d said Hood, the owner/manager of Jadan-Weldtite Vive le Velo Women\u2019s Race Team. \u201cAnd you know the gap between them and the next born female competitor was quite a lot from a cycling perspective.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all power, you can see that it\u2019s all power,\u201d Hood said. \u201cAnd we know that that\u2019s what comes from being born male going through a male puberty and having that influx of testosterone throughout puberty.\u201d\n\nHood referred to the notion that biological males can actually become females as a \u201cmyth.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this myth that if a male body transitions to a female, they then become a female body,\u201d she added. \u201cWe know that\u2019s a myth. It\u2019s a lie agreed upon.\u201d\n\nMcKinnon\u2019s recent comments and his website indicate he believes he is a victim of \u201cinjustice.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy recent work has focused increasingly on two broad topic areas: trans athlete rights and harassment, and epistemic injustice,\u201d he states on his website. \u201cThis latter research focuses on ways in which people\u2019s claims of harm are inproperly [sic] doubted.\u201d", "description": "Transgender cyclist Rachel McKinnon falsely claimed there is no scientific evidence that suggests he holds an advantage over women athletes.", "authors": ["Dr. Susan Berry"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Screenshot_YouTube-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
