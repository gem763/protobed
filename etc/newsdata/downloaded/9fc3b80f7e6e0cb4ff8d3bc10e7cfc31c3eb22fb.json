Which, those two things are true,\" she said. \"John is boring, I do have a filthy mouth.\"\n\nTeigen said she and Legend went back-and-forth debating how to respond to POTUS because they were both amused and angry.\n\nTrump wasn't happy that Legend and Teigen were \u201ctalking now about how great\u201d crime reform is but allegedly didn't act on the reforms when Trump says that it mattered. Trump signed the First Step Act into law last year, reducing mandatory minimum sentences in certain instances and giving judges more discretion in individual cases. More than 3,100 inmates will be released under the act, which has been praised by both Republicans and Democrats.\n\nTRUMP BLOCKS CHRISSY TEIGEN ON TWITTER\n\nTrump talked about criminal justice reform and how President \u201cObama couldn\u2019t come close\u201d to passing meaningful law. The president said he is tired of \u201cboring musician John Legend\u201d and his wife for touting the bill, which Legend discussed in a CNN special.\n\n\"They only talk about the minor players, or people that had nothing to do with it...And the people that so desperately sought my help when everyone else had failed, all they talk about now is Impeaching President Trump,\" Trump lamented.\n\nJOHN LEGEND SAYS DONALD TRUMP NEEDS TO APOLOGIZE FOR 'DEMONIZING' MUSLIMS\n\nLegend responded to Trump\u2019s tweet by appealing to first lady Melania Trump.\n\n\u201cImagine being president of a whole country and spending your Sunday night hate-watching MSNBC hoping somebody\u2014ANYBODY\u2014will praise you. Melania, please praise this man. He needs you,\u201d he tweeted. A minute later he tweeted, \u201cYour country needs you, Melania.\u201d\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTeigen mocked the president, calling him a \u201cp\u2014y a\u2014 b\u2014h\u201d for tagging \u201ceveryone\u201d but her in his tweet. Legend sarcastically requested that followers not retweet Teigen's insult as a hashtag.\n\nFox News' Edmund DeMarche contributed to this report.", "description": "Chrissy Teigen\u00a0has no regrets about her response to\u00a0President Trump\u00a0when he called her John Legend's \"filthy mouthed wife.\"", "authors": ["Jessica Sager"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/donald-trump-chrissy-teigen.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
