Hundreds of demonstrators have also been detained.\n\nThe death toll from the mass protests, which entered their fifth day on Saturday, currently stands at 93, according to the country\u2019s human rights commission. The committee claimed that an additional 4,000 people have been injured. A total of 540 protesters have been arrested, with 200 still in police custody.\n\nSecurity forces have repeatedly used live ammunition to disperse the demonstrations, which were sparked by widespread anger over poor social services and spiraling corruption. A curfew was implemented in the capital in an attempt to quell the unrest. The restrictions were lifted on Saturday, according to reports.\n\nAlso on rt.com Iraqi PM acknowledges \u2018righteous\u2019 demands of protesters as death toll surpasses 40 in nationwide demonstrations\n\nIn a televised address on Friday, Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi said that protesters\u2019 demands for social and political reforms were \u201crighteous,\u201d but urged Iraqis to return to their homes.
