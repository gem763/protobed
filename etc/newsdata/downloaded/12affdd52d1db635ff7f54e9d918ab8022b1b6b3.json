It came after he missed a runner in the lane over Gobert, but raced to the left side of the rim to snag the rebound and throw it down with two hands.\n\nWilliamson asserted himself more while being guarded by Jazz reserves in the fourth quarter. He twice banked in double-clutch floaters while being fouled by Ed Davis. Williamson smiled and flexed his bicep after the second as the crowd came out of its seats.\n\nSoon after, he sank a driving underhanded floater as he was fouled by William Howard and completed the three-point play to put the Pelicans up 109-106.\n\nThe No. 1 overall pick in June finished 9 of 12 from the field and 7 of 9 on free throws in 23 minutes.\n\nNickeil Alexander-Walker added 22 points for the Pelicans (3-0).

The Mavericks trailed by 19 early in the fourth quarter and scored 16 straight points to cut the deficit to 111-109 with 2:24 to go. Bender's finger roll ended Dallas' run and the Bucks closed on a 7-2 spurt.\n\nWIZARDS 115, KNICKS 99\n\nBradley Beal scored 21 points and Washington used a 20-0 run in the first half to turn around the game and split its preseason series with New York.\n\nMoritz Wagner added 18 points and Thomas Bryant had 10 points and 10 rebounds for the Wizards (1-1).

Rookie RJ Barrett had 15 points and Julius Randle added 14 points and eight rebounds.\n\nWizards first-round pick Rui Hachimura sat out to rest.\n\nNew York played without potential starters Dennis Smith Jr. (strained lower back) and Kevin Knox (strained right calf).\n\nCELTICS 100, MAGIC 75\n\nJayson Tatum scored 15 points, Marcus Smart added 14 and the Celtics used a 35-11 first quarter to spoil Orlando's first home game.\n\nBoston (2-0) scored the first 11 points of the game and led 21-2 later in the quarter after holding the Magic to 1-of-14 shooting. Tatum and Smart each scored 12 points in the first half as the Celtics led by 28 points.\n\nTerrence Ross led Orlando (3-1) with 21 points, including four of the Magic's six 3-pointers.\n\nPACERS 105, BULLS 87\n\nT.J. Warren scored 17 points for his new team and Myles Turner, last season's leader in blocked shots, had 14 points, seven rebounds and five blocks as Indiana cruised.\n\nDomantas Sabonis was the only Indiana (3-0) starter not in double-figure scoring, but he had a game-high 14 rebounds with eight points. Malcolm Brogdon added 14 points.\n\nCoby White was 10 of 22 from the field and scored 24 points for Chicago (0-3).\n\nPISTONS 109, CAVALIERS 105\n\nAndre Drummond had 15 points and eight rebounds and Detroit rallied late, taking its first lead since the final quarter at 104-103 with 1:08 left.
