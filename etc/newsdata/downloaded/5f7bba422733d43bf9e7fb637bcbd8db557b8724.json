Adam Schiff had advance knowledge of the whistleblower complaint against President Trump:\n\nThe Democratic head of the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, learned about the outlines of a C.I.A. officer\u2019s concerns that President Trump had abused his power days before the officer filed a whistle-blower complaint, according to a spokesman and current and former American officials\u2026 The C.I.A. officer approached a House Intelligence Committee aide with his concerns about Mr. Trump only after he had had a colleague first convey them to the C.I.A.\u2019s top lawyer. Concerned about how that initial avenue for airing his allegations through the C.I.A. was unfolding, the officer then approached the House aide. In both cases, the original accusation was vague. The House staff member, following the committee\u2019s procedures, suggested the officer find a lawyer to advise him and file a whistle-blower complaint. The aide shared some of what the officer conveyed to Mr. Schiff. The aide did not share the whistle-blower\u2019s identity with Mr. Schiff, an official said.\n\nSo that explains why the complaint reads like it was drafted by a lawyer: It was drafted by a lawyer at the recommendation of a Democratic staffer working for Adam Schiff. But while admitting they knew about the substance of the complaint, Schiff\u2019s office is denying he saw the actual written complaint in advance:\n\nSchiff spox also says \"at no point did the Committee review or receive the complaint in advance\u2026 The Committee did not receive the complaint until the night before the Acting Director of National Intelligence\u2019s open hearing before the Committee.\" \u2014 Jared Halpern (@JaredHalpern) October 2, 2019\n\nThe NY Times doesn\u2019t give us an exact timeline but this also explains why Schiff announced a \u201cwide-ranging investigation\u201d into Trump, Giuliani, and Ukraine on September 9, and then announced the whistleblower complaint was being withheld several days later. At the time, he wouldn\u2019t say what the complaint was about and pretended he was speculating it must involve Trump:\n\n\u201cThe Committee can only conclude, based on this remarkable confluence of factors, that the serious misconduct at issue involves the President of the United States and/or other senior White House or Administration officials,\u201d Schiff wrote in a letter to Maguire on Friday. The initial whistleblower complaint was filed last month, and Schiff indicated that it was required by law to be shared with Congress nearly two weeks ago. His subpoena requires the information to be turned over by Sept. 17 or else he intends to compel Maguire to appear before Congress in a public hearing on Sept. 19. Schiff said Maguire declined to confirm or deny whether the whistleblower\u2019s complaint relates to anything the Intelligence Committee is currently investigating or whether White House lawyers were involved in the decision-making about the complaint.\n\nPresident Trump was asked about the story during a joint press conference with the President of Finland. Trump held up a copy of the report, which he said he\u2019d just been handed. \u201cIt shows that Schiff is a fraud,\u201d Trump said before the question was even finished. He added, \u201cI think it\u2019s a scandal that he knew before. I would go a step further. I think he probably helped write it.\u201d Trump then repeated that saying, \u201cHe knew long before and he helped write it too. It\u2019s a scam. It\u2019s a scam.\u201d\n\nIt may be a scam but the Times\u2019 story does not say that Schiff helped to directly write the complaint, only that they knew about it and directed the whistleblower to a lawyer. So the real news here is that Schiff knew in advance where this was heading and then played it out as an unfolding drama for the media over the past several weeks.\n\nHere\u2019s Trump reacting to the story.\n\nUpdate: Why didn\u2019t Schiff tell the truth?", "description": "\"It shows that Schiff is a fraud.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Trump-NY-Times.jpg"}
