It is instead the most serious of the many things he has been vilified for from his six years in charge of the EFL, the expulsion of one of its oldest clubs.\n\nAnd while he admits \u201cnobody can be completely blameless\u201d for Bury\u2019s \u201ctragic\u201d demise, he wants it to be known he did propose measures to clubs that might just have prevented it.
