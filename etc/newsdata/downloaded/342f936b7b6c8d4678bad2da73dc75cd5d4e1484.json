It\u2019s a sprightly and sporty drive sprinting from rest to 62mph up to a top speed of 143mph.\n\nIt\u2019s a refined but sporty drive with sharp steering and good handling on corners and plenty of punch for overtaking and cruises effortlessly on motorways, with sufficient oomph when required. The engine is quiet and smooth, while still engaging.\n\nDaily Mail motoring editor Ray Massey attended the global launch near Atlanta in Georgia\n\nThe X5 has a bold teutonic look bordering on brutalist, with an aggressively large kidney-shaped grille that will soon become a familiar looming sight in the rear-view mirror of many non-BMW driving motorists\n\nBut unlike on the derestricted German Autobahns, the roads around the manicured \u2018burbs\u2019 of Atlanta - as with the UK Home Counties \u2013 allow few opportunities to really open it up without attracting the attention of the local law officers.\n\nStop and Go has been refined to last a longer 30 seconds \u2013 taking account of jams and traffic lights.\n\nIt has a bold teutonic look bordering on brutalist, with an aggressively large kidney-shaped grille that will soon become a familiar looming sight in the rear-view mirror of many non-BMW driving motorists.\n\nBigger, wider, longer and higher than its predecessor (36mm longer, 66mm wider 19mm higher and with a 42mm longer wheelbase), this imposing sports activity vehicle gives the driver an elevated view of the road ahead, imbuing a natural feeling of superiority.\n\nIt comes with 19-inch wheels as standard beneath its wide wheel arches and muscular rear haunches, but with larger options including from 20 inch to 22 inch.\n\nThere are four driving modes: Sport, Comfort, EcoPro and Adaptive.\n\nYou can also specify a range of packages, including off-road. You can set for snow, sand, gravel and rocks. A special off-road view allows you to see surrounding terrain which is otherwise out of sight around you.\n\nYou can choose from a range of adaptive settings specficially set for snow, sand, gravel and rocks. A special off-road view allows you to see surrounding terrain which is otherwise out of sight around you\n\nThe interior is upmarkedly contemporary, functional and unfussy - though still quite familiar to anyone who has previously owned a BMW in the last decade\n\nThe interior is upmarkedly contemporary, functional and unfussy rather than luxurious, but comfortable and well designed for all that.\n\nThe twin-axle air suspension system lowers the vehicle by 20mm in Sport mode (or when it exceeds 86mph).\n\nThe driver can raise ground clearance by up to 40mm for off-road driving. A button in the 645-litre rear luggage compartment lowers it by 40mm, helping loading access into the two-section tailgate.\n\nFive-seaters are standard with seven seats a \u00a31,350 option. You can even specify thermo cupholders to keep your drinks warm or cold in the centre console.\n\nThough sufficiently capable on all but the most extreme off-roading, the truth it\u2019ll be more at home at \u2018Harvey Nicks\u2019 and Harrods than scaling the Himalayas.\n\nIt\u2019ll rarely see action beyond grass and gravel, the school run, the odd gymkhana, family holidays, shopping trips, daily commutes, and crossing the impromptu fairways parking on the BMW sponsored PGA golf championships at Wentworth. But if needs must, there\u2019s decent off-road capability to draw on.\n\nIn terms of body styling, the sportier but more expensive \u2018M Sport\u2019 will account for 80 per cent of sales, with xLine taken up the res\n\nPriced from \u00a356,710, the entry spec model is powered by a 265 horsepower 3.0 litre twin power turbo diesel engine\n\nAround 15 per cent of sales will be the more powerful M50d which, confusingly despite its numbering, also has a 3.0-litre straight six cylinder diesel engine. But this one develops 400 horsepower that pushes it from rest to 62mph in 5.2 seconds up to a top speed of 155mph.\n\nYou can feel the difference. Though while the less powerful version feels nimble, the M50d\u2019s added power makes it feel heavier.\n\nYou\u2019ll also pay a premium as prices cost from \u00a370,690. Expect fuel economy of 41.5mpg with CO2 emissions of 179g/km.\n\nThe 340hp 4.0i petrol accounting for about 20 per cent of sales costs from \u00a358,100, accelerates from 0 to 62mph in 5.5 seconds up to a top speed of 151mph, with 33.2mpg and CO2 emissions of 193g/km.\n\nIn terms of body styling, the sportier but more expensive \u2018M Sport\u2019 will account for 80 per cent of sales, with xLine taken up the rest.\n\nSecurity has been beefed up with a new digital key system to counter the boom in stolen luxury SUVs.\n\nBMW used to boast that earlier 7-series saloons had more computing power than was used to land man on the moon.\n\nThe new X5 would probably get you to Mars with everything from parking assist to safety, collision and lane-change warnings, and plenty of in-built driving stability aids, helping reduce body-roll on tight bends.\n\nThere are elements of autonomy including \u2018Driving Assistant Professional Pack\u2019 and \u2018active cruise control\u2019 which takes the stress out of rush hour traffic.\n\nRay says the X5 has the capablity to tackle all but the most extreme off-roading...\n\nHowever, in truth it\u2019ll be more at home at \u2018Harvey Nicks\u2019 and Harrods than scaling the Himalayas\n\nComputer-control of systems is key, with the new X5 using BMW\u2019s \u2018Operating System 7.0\u2019 to oversee all manner of hi-tech features, including the instrument cluster, control display and head-up display.\n\nThe traditional round instrument panels have been \u2018opened up\u2019 so you can get more information onto the digital screens. There\u2019s also more flexibility to create your own \u2018menu\u2019.\n\nOn display, but undriven on this trip and to follow petrol and diesel versions into showrooms, was a plug-in electric hybrid version of the X5, with the charging point clearly visible.\n\nPowered by a 3.0-litre petrol engine linked to an 82kW battery powered electric motor to develop a total 394bhp, the X5 xDrive45e iPerformance has a range of 50 miles at speeds of up to 87mph in electric power only (146 mph maximum hybrid) , and accelerates from rest to 62mph in 5.6 seconds with average CO2 emissions of just 49g/km and claimed 134mpg fuel economy.", "description": "Having once been the new kid on the block, the X5 is now firmly an establishment figure taking on the fresh-faced likes of Volvo\u2019s XC90, Audi\u2019s Q7 and the Porsche Cayenne.", "authors": ["Ray Massey For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
