MKTS/GLOB\n\nA private survey showed that activity in China's services\n\nsector expanded at the fastest pace in three months in August as\n\nnew orders rose, prompting the biggest increase in hiring in\n\nmore than a year. In addition, investor risk appetite was further revived\n\nafter Hong Kong withdrew the contentious extradition bill at the\n\nheart of recent protests.\n\nChina is the world's second-largest oil consumer and largest\n\nimporter.\n\nIn the United States, crude stockpiles were expected to have\n\ndeclined for a third straight week, a Reuters poll showed, ahead\n\nof weekly data from the American Petroleum Institute (API) on\n\nWednesday and the government on Thursday. Both reports are\n\ndelayed a day due to the U.S. Labor Day holiday. EIA/S\n\nSome analysts, however, noted overall fundamentals of the\n\noil market remained discouraging.\n\n\"Oil prices however remain focused on the trade war and the\n\nlonger we don't see a date scheduled for a face-to-face meeting\n\nbetween Chinese and U.S. officials, the greater the odds we\n\ncould see a retest of the summer lows,\" Edward Moya, senior\n\nmarket analyst at OANDA in New York, said in a report.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump warned on Tuesday he would be\n\n\"tougher\" on Beijing in a second term if trade talks dragged on,\n\ncompounding market fears that trade disputes between the two\n\ncountries could trigger a U.S. recession. U.S. data released on Tuesday showed manufacturing activity\n\ncontracted in August for the first time in three years, while\n\neuro zone activity shrank for a seventh month. \"Crude oil remains troubled by reports that production from\n\nOPEC, Russia and the U.S. all rose last month. This (comes) at a\n\ntime when the strength of demand growth, due to trade war\n\npessimism, has increasingly been called into question,\" Saxo\n\nBank commodity strategist Ole Hansen said.\n\nBP Plc's Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary told\n\nReuters that global oil demand is expected to grow by less than\n\n1 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2019 as consumption slows.\n\nBut supply looks set to stay constrained as Russian\n\nofficials and sources from the Organization of the Petroleum\n\nExporting Countries indicated the countries would remain\n\ncommitted to their agreement to rein in production despite a\n\nshake-up in Saudi Arabia's oil industry. In a possible sign of tension easing in the energy-rich\n\nGulf, Iranian state television reported on Wednesday that Tehran\n\nwould free seven crew members of the detained British-flagged\n\ntanker Stena Impero.\n\nThe vessel was seized two weeks after Britain detained an\n\nIranian tanker off the territory of Gibraltar which was released\n\nin August.", "description": "UPDATE 7-Oil prices rise over 4% on positive economic data from China", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/indicatornews_6_800x533_L_1412601562.jpg"}
