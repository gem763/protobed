So it is a relief that Lights Up \u2013 our first peek at what has been heavily trailed as a daring new Styles-goes-cosmic direction (AKA took mushrooms once) \u2013 actually feels so effortless and laid-back. It is a blissed-out track, never coming down from a higher state of consciousness, that occasionally goes a bit heavy on the phasing effects but otherwise burbles along like deluxe bubble bath.\n\nHalsey\n\nGraveyard\n\nIt\u2019s mid-October and you know what that means: time to get S-P-O-O-K-Y. But also S-A-D. That\u2019s the takeaway from Halsey\u2019s latest moody-banger, now with added creepy funfair vid. It\u2019s a poignant, spiralling snapshot of doomed romantic obsession that courts the goth vote (lots of references to loitering in graveyards) but gets severely marked down for the lyric \u201clet that sink in\u201d. It\u2019s not Twitter, Halz.\n\nHayley Kiyoko\n\nDemons\n\nKiyoko\u2019s new ongoing musical project rejoices in the #relatable title I\u2019m Too Sensitive for This Shit. With its ominous roaming bassline and nervy pizzicato strings, standout track Demons is another Halloween anthem-in-waiting, albeit one where the scary monsters are trapped within rather than roaming the streets. It is spidery, moreish ghost train music of the highest order.\n\nCher Lloyd\n\nMIA\n\nFor one hot second, it looked like Mathangi Arulpragasam AKA MIA had recorded a song about indefatigable X Factor striver Cher Lloyd. But sadly it\u2019s just Lloyd lobbying hard for a romantic bunk-off over some R&B-inflected beats and playground whoops. It might not be the superpowered song potent enough to transform her into a belated superstar but it still thrums with emphatic, if wildly misplaced, self-belief.\n\nMaroon 5\n\nMemories\n\nGreat news for fans of Pachelbel\u2019s Classic FM staple Canon in D. Maroon 5\u2019s soulful scarecrow Adam Levine has heard it, too, and believes that what Johann P\u2019s memorably boomeranging chord sequence needed to unlock its true potential was some trite lyrics about how gallons of booze can reactivate bittersweet memories. Guitar-free, drum-free, fun-free dreck.", "description": "This week we\u2019ve got a slice of luxe pop, an artless mauling of Pachelbel, and a downbeat banger", "authors": ["Graeme Virtue"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e53546b05a9e165146badbb2402a576934a14290/0_236_6237_3742/master/6237.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f117f9b7199ef75fe9fa28a5797b29e0", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
