In fact, I\u2019m friends with a lot of people who don\u2019t share the same beliefs I have\u2026 And I think we\u2019ve forgotten that that\u2019s OK, that\u2019s we\u2019re all different.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBut although Bush and DeGeneres have previously exchanged joking and friendly interactions \u2014 notably on her talk show after Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration \u2014 Bush and DeGeneres\u2019 differences are not subtle and easily overcome by chit-chat. The two should be diametrically opposed.\n\nA celebrity with openly liberal politics, DeGeneres became an LGBTQ icon and role model in 1997, when she came out on the cover of Time magazine and then to almost 36 million viewers on her ABC sitcom Ellen. DeGeneres \u2013 who has been married to her wife, actor Portia de Rossi, since 2008, the same year that same-sex marriage became legal in California \u2014 has long fought for LGBTQ rights, even calling out trans woman Caitlyn Jenner for her past views on gay marriage.\n\nDuring an October 11, 2000 presidential debate, then-candidate Bush affirmed his opposition to gay marriage, on the basis that it was \u201ca sacred institution between a man and a woman,\u201d and that LGBTQ people shouldn\u2019t be given \u201cspecial rights... [or] special protective status\u201d \u2014 although he did claim he wanted them to have equal rights.\n\nAlthough Bush\u2019s then-opponent Al Gore and suceessor Barack Obama have since reversed their previous oppositions to gay marriage, Bush has not demonstrated the same evolution.\n\nIn fact, Bush\u2019s support for ultra-conservative Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh \u2014 even in the midst of numerous sexual assault and harassment allegations \u2014 was instrumental in Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation. And now, as I write this \u2014 the same day DeGeneres defended her friendship with Bush \u2014 the US Supreme Court is deciding whether to allow employers to discriminate based on gender or sexual orientation. Keep in mind that this is a case with deadly consequences, that can affect housing, healthcare, and the violence that LGBTQ people (especially black trans women) are forced to endure. If the court rules in favor of bigotry, Bush\u2019s support of Kavanaugh contributed to it, not to mention the other ominous consequences of having Kavanaugh in the Supreme Court.\n\nAnd if we zoom out beyond DeGeneres\u2019 own identity, the gulf between Bush\u2019s beliefs and DeGeneres\u2019 self-proclaimed ones becomes even wider. Bush, who instigated a decades-long war on the basis of a lie for oil, destabilized entire regions in the Middle East and Africa. His War on Terror led to countless civilian casualties across the world and a refugee crisis, and he oversaw horrifying inhumane torture practices at Abu Ghraib prison and Guantanamo Bay. Over 750 Muslim-Americans were detained after 9/11, solely for being Muslims, mostly Muslims of color.\n\nJacobin magazine also points out that Bush was found guilty of \u201ccrimes against peace\u201d in absentia by a seven-member war crimes tribunal in Kuala Lumpur. They also highlight the fact that Richard Clarke, a former top Bush administration counterterrorism official, went on the record saying he thinks he and his administration committed war crimes.\n\nBush additionally displayed gross incompetence and a stunning lack of compassion when the predominately black city of New Orleans drowned during Hurricane Katrina. Bipartisan groups have said his education initiative, \u201cNo Child Left Behind\u201d, failed miserably and disproportionately harmed low-income students and students of color. He shares a great deal of the blame for the disastrous Great Recession.\n\nThe list goes on but the message is clear: George W Bush was one of the worst presidents this country has ever seen. He\u2019s only separated from the much-reviled Trump by a thin layer consisting of his veneer of upper-class gentility and his attempts to revamp his image into a lovable grandpa who paints watercolors of dogs, gives warm hugs, and \u201cdoesn\u2019t like\u201d the blatantly shocking racism of the Trump era. His attempts are successful precisely because they are made possible by the public friendship of people like deGeneres.\n\nBut Bush is a figure of horror for many, and attempting to get his victims to forget this under the guise of civility and unity is abhorrent.\n\nIn defense of DeGeneres\u2019 actions, some on social media have claimed that it\u2019s a slippery slope, because then we would have to condemn people like Former Presidential Candidate Hillary Clinton and Former First Lady Michelle Obama for showing affection towards Bush.\n\nBut as writer Imraan Siddiqi says on Twitter, that\u2019s kind of the point. We should always be critical of people in the elite classes, no matter how cool or likeable they are. We should be critical of those they choose to surround themselves with, the policies they support, the atrocities they remain silent about, and the amount of self-reflection and remorse they engage in.\n\nThe ability to refrain from engaging in this kind of self-analysis and criticism lies only with the elite classes, whose money and status insulates them from oppression. As writer Hamilton Nolan writes for Splinter News: \u201cWhereas the average person is forced to spend a good deal of time contemplating problems\u2014from mundane to existential... the people at the top of the world are under no such obligation\u2026 Their needs are met. They are free to direct their mental energy towards achieving ever higher levels of self-realization. Though they may recognize the world\u2019s problems in an abstract way, they are not true obstacles for them.\u201d\n\nI can\u2019t speak to what DeGeneres perceives as a true threat to her life or well-being, but the fact that she is able to be friends with George W Bush despite the widespread destruction he wrought \u2013 and his apparent lack of remorse \u2014 shows that she is not afraid of the potentially destructive international consequences of rehabilitating him.\n\nIf we accept a president who enacts xenophobic policies, strips citizens of rights, and levels entire countries \u2014 as long as he does it with a polite smile and platitudes about peace and unity \u2014 then how will we ever truly achieve liberation and escape the Trump era?", "description": "This week, a social media controversy erupted when footage of prominent comedian Ellen DeGeneres and former president George W Bush emerged, which showed the unlikely pair laughing together in the owner\u2019s box of a Dallas Cowboys vs. Green Bay Packers game.", "authors": ["Nylah Burton"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/08/07/ellen-degeneres-george-bush.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
