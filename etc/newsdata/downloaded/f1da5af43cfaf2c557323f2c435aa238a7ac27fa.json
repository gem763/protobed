But the former vice president\u2019s lead is taking a hit as top-tier rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s support soars in the contest the Biden campaign sees as a firewall.\n\nBiden \u2013 who has longstanding ties in the state \u2013 stands at 33 percent among South Carolina voters likely to cast a ballot in the state\u2019s February primary, according to a new poll from Monmouth University. That\u2019s down 6 percentage points from Monmouth\u2019s previous survey in the Palmetto State, which was conducted in July.\n\nTHE LATEST 2020 POLLING FROM FOX NEWS\n\nWarren, the progressive senator from Massachusetts, stands at 16 percent in the survey, a jump of 7 points from July.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont is in third in the new poll, at 12 percent. The populist independent senator from Vermont who\u2019s making his second straight White House bid stood at 10 percent in the previous survey.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris of California, who stood at 12 percent in the July survey, saw her support drop in half and now comes in at 6 percent in the new poll.\n\nEnvironmental and progressive advocate and former hedge fund manager Tom Steyer has the backing of 4 percent of likely South Carolina Democratic primary voters, with South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 3 percent, and Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang each at 2 percent. The remaining nine candidates in the record-setting Democratic presidential field all register at 1 percent or less.\n\nTHE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN\n\nBesides the topline findings, the poll also has warning signs for Biden among South Carolina\u2019s black voters, who make up more than half of the likely Democratic primary electorate. The former vice president\u2019s position as either a first- or second-choice candidate dropped by 10 points among black voters to 52 percent, while Warren\u2019s position as a top-two choice contender jumped 11 points to 26 percent.\n\n\u201cBiden is still in a pretty good position in South Carolina, but there are some signs that he might not have a true firewall among black voters. If he does not do well in the earlier contests in February, there may be potential for current preferences to shift here,\u201d Monmouth University Polling Institute director Patrick Murray said in a statement.\n\nThe Monmouth University Poll was conducted Oct. 16-21, with 402 South Carolina voters likely to cast a ballot in the Democratic presidential primary questioned by live telephone operators. The margin of error is plus or minus 4.9 percentage points.", "description": "Joe Biden remains the clear front-runner in the latest poll in South Carolina \u2013 which holds the first southern primary in the race for the White House.
