But former Democratic Centre senator Alfredo Rangel said there was now \"growing support\" in the ruling party for such action.\n\n\u201cAn armed intervention is the only way out of this,\u201d he said.\u201cColleagues can see that diplomacy is failing and I think our neighbours in Latin America are beginning to see that too.\u201d\n\nRafael Nieto Loaiza, a former vice minister for justice and key figure in Mr Duque's party, says his hand may be forced.\n\n\u201cDuque has said he doesn\u2019t want military action, but it\u2019s possible that the support from the regime in Caracas for dissident Farc and ELN factions may mean he has to re-think his position.\u201d\n\nThis week's events have also led to an uptick in rhetoric from Washington, where officials reiterated accusations that the Maduro government has been actively conspiring with Colombian rebels.\n\n\"The regime in Caracas seems to be fomenting this kind of activity, in essence turning over parts of the country, particularly to the ELN,\" Elliott Abrams, the Trump administration's special envoy to Venezuela, told reporters.\n\n\"We've known for some time that the FARC and ELN enjoy safe haven inside Venezuela,\" a senior State Department official added in an interview with Reuters. \"And it's even more clear now that they do so with the complicity of the Maduro regime.\"", "description": "Hardliners from Colombia\u2019s ruling party have told the Telegraph that Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro must be held accountable for harbouring FARC leaders who announced a return to arms, as the country's army killed nine rebels in a raid.\u00a0 On Thursday, senior commanders from the leftist guerrilla", "authors": ["Mathew Charles"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Z4bSh4O7oqm0fT5sp649hg--~B/aD0xNTIxO3c9MjQzNDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_258/3aec81568b804f664cad50c2e88ddb32"}
