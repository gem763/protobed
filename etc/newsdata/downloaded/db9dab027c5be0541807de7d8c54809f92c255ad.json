Four government attorneys find themselves embroiled in Trump's Ukraine mess.", "language": "en", "text": "THE BIG IDEA: Four government lawyers appointed by President Trump face mounting scrutiny over the roles they played in seeking to limit the exposure of his prodding the Ukrainian government to dig up dirt on his leading 2020 challenger. Those efforts prompted that whistleblower complaint that was released this morning and have led to an official impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe White House counsel helped to identify legal obstacles to the disclosure of information that could be politically damaging to Trump. The head of the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel issued a classified opinion to initially block the whistleblower\u2019s complaint from being transmitted to congressional committees that are legally entitled to receive it. The director of DOJ\u2019s criminal division swiftly dismissed a criminal referral from the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general that said Trump may have broken campaign finance laws by seeking dirt on Joe Biden. And Bill Barr declined to recuse himself, even though Trump invoked the attorney general at least twice during his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick primer on why each of the four taxpayer-funded attorneys is in the spotlight:\n\nSteven Engel, director of the Office of Legal Counsel:\n\nIn late August, the inspector general for the intelligence community gave to the acting director of national intelligence a whistleblower complaint alleging that unnamed White House officials had expressed concern about Trump\u2019s call. The IG said this was credible and urgent and should be turned over to Congress. But then Joseph Maguire, the acting DNI, contacted the Justice Department to ask for guidance. Engel issued a secret memo on Sept. 3 saying that the complaint didn\u2019t need to be turned over to congressional intelligence committee because it was outside of the DNI\u2019s jurisdiction. Instead, he said the allegation would more properly be referred to the Justice Department as a potential criminal matter for further review. (The DOJ published yesterday an unclassified version of Engel\u2019s legal reasoning.)\n\nBrian Benczkowski, then a top aide to Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) and now the head of the Justice Department's criminal division, attends a Senate hearing in 2009. (Harry Hamburg/AP)\n\nAssistant Attorney General Brian Benczkowski, head of the criminal division:\n\nWhen the intelligence community IG submitted a criminal referral that said the president possibly violated campaign finance laws, it was Benczkowski who made the call within a matter of weeks that there was not enough evidence to pursue an investigation of Trump. He\u2019s a former Senate GOP staffer who worked at the same law firm as Barr before being appointed to the job. Benczkowski\u2019s confirmation was held up for a stretch two years ago because of his legal work for a Russian bank.\n\n\u201cSenior Justice Department officials defended their handling of the matter, saying that campaign finance laws required them to \u2018quantify\u2019 the value of what Trump was seeking for his campaign, and that was impossible to do with the investigations Trump had requested. They said they were examining what was referred, and the rough transcript of the call was the \u2018best evidence\u2019 to help determine what to do,\u201d Matt Zapotosky and Devlin Barrett report. \u201cThe FBI, the officials said, deferred to the Justice Department. \u2026 They said career prosecutors agreed with the decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll relevant components of the Department agreed with his legal conclusion, and the Department has concluded the matter,\u201d Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said in a statement.\n\nAttorney General William Barr walks toward the Oval Office with an aide last Friday. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nAttorney General Bill Barr:\n\nJustice Department officials also said that the attorney general was \u201cgenerally knowledgeable\u201d of discussions about Engel\u2019s decision but he didn\u2019t make the call not to move forward with the investigation.\n\nKupec, Barr\u2019s spokeswoman, said in a statement: \u201cThe President has not spoken with the Attorney General about having Ukraine investigate anything relating to former Vice President Biden or his son. The President has not asked the Attorney General to contact Ukraine \u2013 on this or any other matter. The Attorney General has not communicated with Ukraine \u2013 on this or any other subject. Nor has the Attorney General discussed this matter, or anything relating to Ukraine, with Rudy Giuliani.\u201d\n\nShe added that U.S. Attorney John Durham, who has been investigating the origins of the FBI\u2019s probe into possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia, is \u201cexploring the extent to which a number of countries, including Ukraine, played a role in the counterintelligence investigation directed at the Trump campaign during the 2016 election,\u201d per Devlin, Matt, Carol Leonnig and Shane Harris.\n\nBut Democrats said Barr should have recused himself entirely. The Democratic chairman of the House Judiciary Committee called on Barr to not be involved with anything related to Ukraine and this episode. Sen. Kamala Harris, a Democratic presidential candidate and formerly California\u2019s attorney general, demanded that Barr testify under oath before Congress as soon as possible about his role.\n\n\u201cTrump has repeatedly lauded Barr, a stark contrast from his relationship with his first attorney general, Jeff Sessions,\u201d the AP\u2019s Michael Balsamo and Mark Sherman note. \u201cNot only did Barr provide the first, favorable framing for the Mueller report, but he also \u2026 has supported the White House\u2019s decision to claim broad executive privilege to prevent the testimony of administration officials that could be potentially damaging for Trump. Barr has also defied subpoenas from Congress \u2014 in line with the Trump administration\u2019s stance to block Democrats\u2019 efforts to investigate Trump.\u201d\n\nWhite House counsel Pat Cipollone, accompanied by Mick Mulvaney, listens as Trump speaks in the Oval Office. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nWhite House counsel Pat Cipollone:\n\nCipollone has been engaged in this matter since shortly after the whistleblower action surfaced, we reported last week, helping to identify legal obstacles to the sharing of information that could be politically damaging to Trump.\n\nThree of my colleagues revealed yesterday that Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, threatened to resign over concerns that the White House might attempt to force him to stonewall Congress when he was going to testify about the whistleblower complaint. \u201cHe has at times expressed his displeasure to [Cipollone] and others that the White House had put him in the untenable position of denying the material to Congress over a claim that it did not fall within his jurisdiction as leader of the intelligence community,\u201d according to Greg Miller, Shane and Karoun Demirjian. \u201cThe current and former officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter, said Maguire had pushed the White House to make an explicit legal decision on whether it would assert executive privilege over the whistleblower complaint \u2026 It was unclear whether Maguire\u2019s threat had forced the White House to acquiesce and allow him to testify without constraint. But officials said Maguire has pursued the opportunity to meet with lawmakers to defend his actions and integrity.\u201d\n\nMaguire denied that he ever threatened to resign, and the White House also disputed the account. After their statements were issued, Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron said, \u201cWe stand by the story.\u201d\n\nRudy Giuliani arrives at the White House with Maria Ryan for last Friday's state dinner with the Australian prime minister. (Patrick Semansky/AP)\n\nTRUMP\u2019S PERSONAL ATTORNEY IS ALSO IN THE SPOTLIGHT:\n\n-- In the rough transcript, Trump praises Rudy Giuliani as a \u201chighly respected man\u201d who was a \u201cgreat mayor\u201d of New York. \u201cIf you could speak to him that would be great,\u201d the president tells Zelensky.\n\n-- \u201cGiuliani has claimed that his discussions with Ukrainian officials have been at the request of the State Department, which remained fully abreast of his dealings. But the details of the July 25 phone call \u2026 raise new questions about Giuliani\u2019s role, reinforcing the view of some U.S. officials that he operates at the president\u2019s behest, often in a closed loop, and occasionally in contravention to the messages of diplomats in Kiev,\u201d John Hudson reports. \u201cTechnically, it is illegal for private citizens to negotiate with a foreign government on behalf of the United States under the Logan Act, but the law has rarely been enforced. Trump is not the first president to enlist a trusted outside adviser for a sensitive international mission, but Giuliani\u2019s interventions sparked concern among U.S. officials in Kiev who said Ukrainians told them they were unsure if Giuliani was speaking for the U.S. government \u2026\n\n\u201cGiuliani has said that Kurt Volker, the U.S. special representative for Ukraine, helped secure his discussions with a top aide to Zelensky, Andriy Yermak. A State Department official said Giuliani \u2018does not speak on behalf of the U.S. government\u2019 and added that Volker only helped set up the meeting at Yermak\u2019s request. Yermak\u2019s request to meet with Giuliani came after Trump requested that Zelensky speak with the former mayor in the July call. U.S. Embassy officials in Kiev repeatedly expressed concern about the contacts between Giuliani and Ukrainian officials. They have not been privy to most of the discussions, and at times only learned about them later from the Ukrainians, U.S. officials said. Giuliani told The Post he has had about five conversations with Yermak this year.\n\n\u201cIn May 2019, Giuliani also met with a top Ukrainian anti-corruption prosecutor, Nazar Kholodnytsky, in Paris. Kholodnytsky \u2014 who was caught on tape advising witnesses in corruption cases how to avoid prosecution \u2014 had faced calls to step down from the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch. But the meeting came at a triumphant moment for Kholodnytsky. He was holding on to his office. Yovanovitch had been recalled from her posting early. Kholodnytsky declined to comment on the contents of his conversation with Giuliani, which he described as that of a \u2018prosecutor to a former prosecutor.\u2019 But he has said that he believed something didn\u2019t add up with the 2016 release of the \u2018black ledger\u2019 that forced Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort to resign, and that the investigation into Burisma, the energy company of which Hunter Biden was a board member, needed to be reopened. Giuliani, when asked about his meeting with Kholodnytsky, said: \u2018I\u2019m not going to tell you about that.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Trump\u2019s effort to pressure Ukraine into investigating the Bidens appears to have begun as an attempt to formulate a rationale by which the president could pardon Paul Manafort as part of an effort to undermine Mueller\u2019s investigation, according to previously undisclosed records obtained by the New York Review of Books: \u201cThese records indicate that attorneys representing Trump and Manafort respectively had at least nine conversations relating to this effort, beginning in the early days of the Trump administration, and lasting until as recently as May of this year.\n\n\u201cThrough these deliberations carried on by his attorneys, Manafort exhorted the White House to press Ukrainian officials to investigate and discredit individuals, both in the US and in Ukraine, who he believed had published damning information about his political consulting work in the Ukraine. \u2026 [The records show that] on at least three occasions, [Giuliani] was in communication with Manafort\u2019s legal team to discuss how the White House was pushing a narrative that the Democratic National Committee, Democratic donors, and Ukrainian government officials had \u2018colluded\u2019 to defeat [Trump\u2019s] 2016 presidential bid.\u201d\n\n-- The phone call memo followed Trump\u2019s long obsession with Ukraine. More details from the New York Times: \u201cLong before the July 25 call ... Trump\u2019s focus on Ukraine started after a law enforcement organization, the National Anticorruption Bureau of Ukraine, released damaging information about cash payments earmarked to [Manafort] by the Russia-aligned political party of Ukraine\u2019s ousted former president. Even after Mr. Manafort stepped down from the Trump campaign under pressure, he insisted to Mr. Trump\u2019s aides that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign was behind the surfacing of the documents revealing the payments, and questioned the authenticity of the documents. \u2026 The issue continued to fester with Mr. Trump. He tweeted six months after his inauguration about \u2018Ukrainian efforts to sabotage Trump campaign\u2019 and to \u2018boost Clinton,\u2019 and asked, \u2018where is the investigation?\u2019\u201d\n\nPresident Trump speaks on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky listens to a translator. (Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nMORE DETAILS ABOUT THE WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT:\n\n-- Read it for yourself here.\n\n-- \u201cThe whistleblower complaint focuses largely on the July 25 call \u2026 But the complaint also broadly alleges an effort by Trump and [Giuliani] to pressure Ukrainian officials over time \u2026 The whistleblower paints a picture, also using public news reports, to suggest that Giuliani pressured Ukrainian officials to further Trump\u2019s interest in investigating his political opponents,\u201d Devlin, Matt, Carol and Shane report.\n\n\u201cThe complaint also alleges a pattern of obfuscation at the White House, in which officials moved the records of some of Trump\u2019s communications with foreign officials onto a separate computer network from where they are normally stored \u2026 The whistleblower alleges that is what officials did with Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Zelensky, an action that alarmed the intelligence community inspector general and prompted him to request that the White House retain records of the Zelensky call...\"\n\n-- \u201cThe whistle-blower, moreover, identified multiple White House officials as witnesses to potential presidential misconduct who could corroborate the complaint \u2026 [and] the inspector general for the intelligence community, Michael Atkinson, interviewed witnesses,\u201d the Times reports. \u201cMr. Atkinson also found reason to believe that the whistle-blower might not support the re-election of Mr. Trump and made clear that the complainant was not in a position to directly listen to the call or see the memo that reconstructed it before it was made public \u2026 Instead, the officer heard about the call secondhand from unidentified White House officials who expressed concern that Mr. Trump had \u2018abused his authority or acted unlawfully in connection with foreign diplomacy,\u2019 the memo said. Still, Mr. Atkinson concluded after an investigation that the information in the complaint was credible.\u201d\n\n\u00ad-- The whistleblower tentatively agreed to testify on the condition that Maguire approves appropriate security clearances for the person\u2019s lawyers, so they can accompany their client, CNN reports.\n\n-- An eyebrow raising nugget in the whistleblower report:\n\n!!!! Buried in the appendix:\n\n\n\nWB: \"According to White House officials... this was 'not the first time' under this Administration that a Presidential transcript was placed into this codeword-level system solely for the purpose of protecting politically sensitive... information.\" \u2014 Tim Mak (@timkmak) September 26, 2019\n\nReporters swarm Nancy Pelosi as she arrives to meet with her caucus on Wednesday morning. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nTHE ATMOSPHERICS ON CAPITOL HILL:\n\n-- House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and senior House Democrats agreed in a private meeting after the release of the rough transcript they should narrow their impeachment investigation to Trump's dealings on Ukraine, according to five Democrats familiar with the conversation. Mike DeBonis and Rachael Bade report: \u201cDemocrats said the evidence was incriminating enough \u2014 and easy enough for voters to understand \u2014 to proceed with their impeachment inquiry and soon. \u2018Strike while the iron\u2019s hot,\u2019 said one individual in the meeting, summarizing the sentiment. Democrats said they could move quickly on impeachment and act by the end of the year. \u2026 [Pelosi] told colleagues that keeping the inquiry narrowly focused on the Ukraine allegations could also help keep the investigation out of the courts, where a slew of investigative matters have been bogged down for months \u2014 though she did not rule out ultimately including other episodes in potential articles of impeachment ...\n\n\u201cMultiple Judiciary Committee members said that they expected probes of other matters to continue unabated and potentially contribute to impeachment articles drafted this year. Several liberal lawmakers also want to include multiple charges in any impeachment articles.\u201d\n\n-- A milestone: A majority of House members are now on the record in support of opening an impeachment inquiry. As of last night, 217 House Democrats and one independent (Justin Amash) say they support at least opening an impeachment inquiry. Of those, 25 have gone a step further, saying they would definitely support impeaching the president. (The Fix is keeping a live whip count here.)\n\n-- That op-ed published by seven House Democratic freshmen from swing districts with national security credentials proved seismic in pushing both wavering Democrats and Pelosi toward supporting an impeachment inquiry. Paul Kane explains: \u201cThroughout the first phase of the Trump investigations, focusing on Russian interference in 2016, these Democrats found that their constituents were confused by the complicated and long-running investigation by [Mueller]. Instead, while other freshmen got media attention for bashing Trump, this group focused on kitchen-table issues like health-care costs and infrastructure projects. ... Liberal activists tried to jam their town halls, but most Democratic aides reported that aside from one or two impeachment questions, the overwhelming majority of concerns focused on local economic matters. \u2026 To be sure, a dozen or so swing-seat Democrats remain mum, declining so far to take a position ... But no one spoke out against impeachment in their Tuesday afternoon huddle in the Capitol basement.\"\n\n-- Some House Democrats say they wish Pelosi had waited a little longer. \u201cI don\u2019t get surprised often,\u201d said Rep. Jeff Van Drew (N.J.). \u201cBut really, truly, I just was like, \u2018Wow.\u2019 It happened so quickly.\u201d (Mike DeBonis has more.)\n\nTHE GOP RESPONSE:\n\n-- \"The helter-skelter way the administration handled the aftermath of the whistleblower complaint could be a harbinger of the coming impeachment fight, with the White House scrambling to respond to a mercurial and frustrated president, who is increasingly sidelining his aides and making decisions based on gut instinct,\" Ashley Parker, Josh Dawsey and Philip Rucker report: \"Even some allies of the president worry that his team may not fully understand the potential upheaval that an impeachment fight could wreak on Trump and his administration, especially as he heads into the 2020 election. ...\n\n\"On Wednesday morning, aides invited roughly a dozen Republican lawmakers to the White House to preview and discuss the transcript before it was released to the public. At one point, Trump called in from New York, and attendees described him as generally in a good mood \u2014 'chagrined' but not angry, though skittish about some of the details. At one point, the group began joking with the president that 'this was one of his better' phone calls with foreign leaders, an attendee said. And even privately, Trump did not believe his conversation with the Ukrainian president was problematic, according to four people with whom he spoke.\"\n\n-- While most Republican senators publicly toed the line and repeated talking points sent by the White House, several were privately stunned and questioned Trump's judgment after seeing the rough transcript. Robert Costa reports: \u201cOne Senate Republican, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly, said the transcript\u2019s release was a \u2018huge mistake\u2019 that the GOP now has to confront and defend \u2014 while the party argues at the same time that House Democrats are overreaching with their impeachment inquiry of Trump. Three other GOP senators complained privately in discussions ... that the White House erred by releasing the transcript, arguing that it sets a precedent for future presidents about disclosure of calls with foreign leaders and could be seen as a concession to Democrats. Publicly, two senators expressed serious concerns about the revelation, as cracks have begun to emerge with GOP lawmakers privately discussing Trump\u2019s conduct and their party\u2019s political standing.\"\n\n\u201cRepublicans ought not to be rushing to circle the wagons and say there\u2019s no \u2018there\u2019 there when there\u2019s obviously a lot that\u2019s very troubling there,\u201d Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) told reporters.\n\n(R-Neb.) told reporters. \u201cIt remains troubling in the extreme. It\u2019s deeply troubling,\u201d Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) told reporters.\n\n(R-Utah) told reporters. Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) said there was \u201cno quid pro quo,\u201d adding, \u201cwhile the conversation reported in the memorandum \u2026 was inappropriate, it does not rise to the level of an impeachable offense.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne early divide among Senate Republicans is between the \u2018Burr camp\u2019 and the \u2018Johnson camp,\u2019 according to two senior GOP aides,\" Costa reports, \"referring to Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee. Burr\u2019s faction of the Senate GOP has a darker, frustrated view of Trump\u2019s handling of Ukraine, while Johnson has linked the Ukraine issue to his committee\u2019s work into reviewing the launch of the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails while serving as secretary of state.\"\n\n-- He does not get a vote, but Vermont\u2019s Republican governor, Phil Scott, said the impeachment inquiry is \u201cappropriate,\u201d per the AP.\n\n-- The impeachment inquiry is threatening to derail most of Trump's domestic agenda, upending trade and spending talks. From Erica Werner and David Lynch: \u201cThe White House and lawmakers must agree to a new spending deal by Nov. 21, and prospects for an easy resolution were already dim because of a fight over border wall funding. The White House also wants Congress to pass a new trade deal with Mexico and Canada by the end of this autumn, a timeline that could now be impossible to meet.\"\n\nTHE UKRAINE ANGLE:\n\n-- Trump\u2019s meeting with Zelensky on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly offered a platform for salesmanship, grievance and a joke or two. Anne Gearan reports: \u201c\u2018We spoke a couple of times, as you probably remember,\u2019 Trump cracked. \u2026 Zelensky, a comedian and television star before he was elected this year, also tried to keep the mood light by noting that \u2018it\u2019s better to be on TV than by phone.\u2019 \u2026 Standing alongside Trump, Zelensky insisted Wednesday that \u2018nobody pushed me\u2019 to investigate. \u2018I think you read everything,\u2019 Zelensky said as he and Trump faced the cameras. \u2018I\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t want to be involved\u2019 in U.S. elections, Zelensky continued, as Trump smiled beside him. \u2018No, you heard that we had, I think, good phone call. It was normal.\u2019 Trump chimed in: \u2018In other words, no pressure.\u2019\"\n\n-- Trump called former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin a \u201cvery good\u201d prosecutor.\u201d But Shokin resigned in disgrace. David L. Stern reports: Shokin \u201cbecame Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general in 2015 with promises to wage an unflinching battle against corruption after political upheavals dumped a pro-Russian president and brought in Western-looking leadership. At the time, it was a message heartily welcomed by major donors \u2026 Shokin, however, quickly faced questions of his own. Critics complained that he fell short on his pledges to peer deeply into Ukraine\u2019s shadows. By the end of his 13-month tenure, Shokin was scorned by the Obama administration and others that had once praised his appointment.\u201d\n\n-- Trump boasted about U.S. aid to Ukraine. But America isn\u2019t Kiev\u2019s only friend, writes Ruby Mellen: \u201cAlthough the United States is one of the country\u2019s biggest foreign-aid benefactors, other countries have also sent significant assistance to Ukraine. The European Union and its financial institutions have provided more than $16.5 billion in grants and loans to support its reform process since 2014. In addition to those E.U. funds, Germany on its own has pledged millions of dollars in assistance, as has Britain. And Japan, meanwhile, has given $3.1 billion in assistance to Ukraine to the establishment of diplomatic relations in the early 1990s.\u201d\n\n-- \u201cThe U.S. tried to fix Ukraine\u2019s government. We exported our corruption, instead,\u201d laments Paul Musgrave, a professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.\n\nDOMESTIC POLITICAL FALLOUT:\n\n-- During the Ukraine call, Trump revived a pervasive conspiracy theory about the hacking of the Democratic National Committee. Craig Timberg, Drew Harwell and Ellen Nakashima report: \u201cFor years cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike was a source of news, not a subject, as it unraveled some of the world\u2019s most notorious hacks. \u2026 Ever since the company exposed Russian intrusions into [DNC] computers in 2016, \u2026 CrowdStrike has been a subject of allegations that rippled through conservative news sources, onto social media, into the criminal trial of longtime Trump friend Roger Stone and [into the president\u2019s call].\u201d\n\nThe nature of Trump\u2019s reference to CrowdStrike in his call is not obvious in the White House\u2019s memo, but, basically, the company has become a boogeyman of right-wing conspiracy theorists who have falsely claimed it helped Democratic leaders cover up what they insist was a breach by a party insider. In reality, Drew and Ellen explain, \u201cthe FBI felt it was not necessary to enter the DNC's premises and take custody of the affected servers, as agents were able to obtain complete copies of forensic images made by CrowdStrike.\"\n\n-- Trump claimed Hunter Biden got China to put $1.5 billion in a fund, an allegation that has been flatly denied by Biden\u2019s lawyer. Michael Kranish reports: \u201cTrump, who has made a similar allegation for months, is referencing information from a book by Peter Schweizer, \u2018Secret Empires,\u2019 that first detailed how Hunter Biden flew to China on Air Force Two with his father in 2013. \u2026 Trump on Wednesday put it this way: \u2018When Biden\u2019s son walks out of China with $1.5 billion in a fund and the biggest funds in the world can\u2019t get money out of China and he\u2019s there with one quick meeting and he flies in on Air Force Two. I think that\u2019s a horrible thing.\u2019 \u2026 In bringing up the China episode, Trump did not provide any new evidence to back up his claims.\n\n\"Hunter Biden did travel with his father on Air Force Two to China on Dec. 4, 2013. Twelve days later, Hunter Biden joined the board of a just-formed investment advisory firm, known as BHR, whose partners included Chinese entities. Affiliates of the advisory firm said they planned to raise $1.5 billion. Some media reports over the past five years have described Hunter Biden as an owner of a private equity company that sought to raise that amount. However, George Mesires, lawyer for Hunter Biden, said in an interview earlier this year that his client\u2019s role has been misconstrued. He said Hunter Biden was on the board of the advisory firm that did not directly invest, but instead advised those who did.\u201d\n\n-- Trump was fixated on attacking Biden long before his call with Zelensky, per Toluse Olorunnipa and Matt Viser: \u201cHe attacked Biden at the White House and at campaign rallies. He attacked Biden on Twitter and on Instagram. He attacked Biden in France and in Japan, during news conferences and official speeches, in phone calls and in interviews, on Air Force One and in the Rose Garden, during morning 'executive time' and in late-night tweet storms. \u2026 Trump\u2019s advisers say the president has targeted Biden in recent months for several reasons: He has emerged as a front-runner in a crowded field of Democratic contenders, he has a long record in Washington that allows the president to position himself as an outsider and he has been leading Trump in polling in key swing states. Campaign aides previously had been wary of singling out any of the Democratic presidential candidates, opting instead to lump the group of more than 20 contenders together under the banner of \u2018socialism.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- \u201cAn impeachment investigation will also shape the Democrats\u2019 choice of a nominee, potentially foreshortening the race and freezing the current standings in place,\" writes Karen Tumulty. \"Those who are struggling to break from the rear of a 19-person field will find it even harder \u2014 and maybe impossible \u2014 to make their voices heard in the din. \u2018Candidates who have advantages now may see those advantages multiplied,\u2019 says David Axelrod, who was Barack Obama\u2019s chief strategist.\u201d\n\n-- Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky is unlike anything scholars have heard before, reports Karen DeYoung: \u201c\u2018This is nothing like a conversation between Richard Nixon or Henry Kissinger and a foreign leader,\u2019 said Ken Hughes of the Miller Center at the University of Virginia, an expert on Nixon during the Vietnam War and Watergate. \u2018Nixon had very detailed knowledge when he spoke to foreign leaders. He could be subtle in negotiations and still get his point across,\u2019 Hughes said. But \u2018when he wanted to dig up dirt on his political adversaries,\u2019 Nixon did it at home, he said. Even President Lyndon B. Johnson, whose vulgarity and pressure tactics are well documented, \u2018tended to be a cautious and careful communicator with world leaders and diplomats, not the gunslinger that he could be with Americans that he knew well,\u2019 said Kent Germany of the University of South Carolina. \u2018He was not going to go rogue and be Lyndon Johnson with these other leaders.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Before the transcript was released, former New Jersey governor and the onetime Trump transition chief Chris Christie ominously said that Trump would be in trouble if he said something like \u201cdo me a favor.\u201d Hours later, it was revealed the president asked the Ukrainian president to \u201cdo us a favor.\u201d (Mediaite)\n\n-- The Wall Street Journal stands behind its reporting that Trump pressured Zelensky to work with Giuliani about eight times, despite claims from Trump allies and conservative media that it's wrong. The Journal notes the rough transcript is incomplete. There are also ellipses. (Erik Wemple)\n\nNOTEWORTHY COMMENTARY:\n\n-- Tuesday was Pelosi\u2019s day, but Wednesday was Trump\u2019s \u2013 for better or for worse, writes chief correspondent Dan Balz: \u201cThe impeachment inquiry is both an epic battle between the speaker and the president and, more fundamentally, a constitutional clash that will help define the limits on presidential power, and the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches. The outcome will shape, perhaps decisively, the 2020 campaign. Trump will either be out of office by January 2021 or he will have emerged victorious, reelected to a second term in large part because of what would then, inevitably, be interpreted as an enormous gamble by the speaker and the Democrats that went terribly wrong. The past two days have shown that there is no turning back.\u201d\n\n-- The Trump-Ukraine transcript contains evidence of a quid pro quo, writes National Review\u2019s David French, a leading conservative attorney: \u201cThe transcript provides proof that Trump made a completely improper request that the president of Ukraine work with Trump\u2019s personal counsel to investigate a political rival. It provides strong evidence that this took place in the context of a quid pro quo for desperately needed military aid.\u201d\n\n-- The Trump-Zelensky readout is a devastating indictment of our president, says The Post\u2019s Editorial Board.\n\n-- The rough transcript of the call is devastating. How could Trump not realize that? Max Boot wonders: \u201cAt least Richard Nixon had the good sense to resist releasing the \u2018smoking gun\u2019 tape until finally forced to do so by the Supreme Court. \u2026 Trump, by contrast, is so clueless \u2014 so lacking in even the most basic sense of right and wrong \u2014 that he could actually tweet this morning: \u2018Will the Democrats apologize after seeing what was said on the call with the Ukrainian President?\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Democrats had no idea Trump would hand them so much ammo, writes E.J. Dionne Jr.\n\n-- The House doesn\u2019t need an impeachment inquiry to confirm Trump\u2019s wrongdoing. His corruption is hidden in plain sight \u2013 just look at his D.C. hotel, argues Dana Milbank: \u201cAs the call notes were being released, a joint House committee opened a hearing on Trump\u2019s lease of the Old Post Office, now the Trump International Hotel in Washington. Trump has violated the plain language of the lease (it says no U.S. elected official can be part of or benefit from the lease), and the plain language of the Constitution (it says no U.S. officeholder can accept payments from any \u2018foreign state\u2019). But the General Services Administration found a novel way to avoid declaring that Trump had obviously violated both: It looked the other way.\u201d\n\nWelcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning briefing for decision-makers.\n\nSign up to receive the newsletter.\n\nAlmairis Guillen and her son Miguel de Jesus Oseguera, 4, travel through Mexico on their way to the United States as part of a migrant caravan from Honduras. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\nTHE TRUMP AGENDA:\n\n-- The administration announced an asylum deal with Honduras, which could force migrants into one of the world\u2019s most violent nations. Nick Miroff reports: \u201cDepartment of Homeland Security officials reached the accord with the government of President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez, who is embroiled in allegations of government corruption and charges that he and others have been operating the nation as a criminal enterprise \u2014 Hern\u00e1ndez has been named as a co-conspirator in a major U.S. drug trafficking case. The deal paves the way for the United States to take asylum seekers from the U.S. border and ship them to a nation with one of the highest murder rates in the world, a country with gang wars that have fueled waves of mass migration and multiple \u2018caravans\u2019 to the United States that became a major irritant to [Trump].\u201d\n\n-- The new deal comes just days after a man was brutally murdered in Honduras -- just hours after being deported from the United States. (La Prensa)\n\n-- The Republican-controlled Senate voted for the second time to overturn Trump\u2019s declaration of a national emergency at the southern border, but the body once again fell well short of the veto-proof, two-thirds majority needed to block the president from diverting military construction money to his pet project. (Erica Werner and Aaron Gregg)\n\n-- Human rights groups demanded that ICE release all LGBTQ detainees and anyone with HIV in the agency\u2019s custody. Robert Moore reports: \u201c\u2018We know that lack of medical and mental-health care, including lack of HIV care, is the norm,\u2019 Roger Coggan, director of legal services at the Los Angeles LGBT Center, told reporters Wednesday afternoon. \u2018By the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s own count, 300 individuals identifying as transgender have been in custody and at the mercy of ICE since October of 2018. These cruel incarcerations need to stop immediately.\u2019 DHS officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the complaint. It is unclear how many LGBTQ people and people with HIV are detained by U.S. immigration officials.\u201d\n\n-- Trump's decision to move the Agriculture Department's Economic Research Service out of Washington will cause \u201csignificant delays\u201d in vital research reports on which farmers depend. Politico reports: \u201cERS conducts research into areas such as climate change, nutrition, export data and the farm economy. Farmers also heavily rely on its outlook reports to make planting decisions. Crop markets can swing on the results of the numbers. ... USDA identified 38 specific reports that may be delayed because staff members have departed.\"\n\n\u00ad-- Income inequality has grown, including in heartland states. From the AP: \u201cThe nation\u2019s Gini Index, which measures income inequality, has been rising steadily over the past five decades. The Gini Index grew from 0.482 in 2017 to 0.485 last year, according to the bureau\u2019s 1-year American Community Survey data. The Gini Index is on a scale of 0 to 1; a score of \u20180\u2019 indicates perfect equality, while a score of \u20181\u2019 indicates perfect inequality, where one household has all the income.\u201d\n\n-- The Federal Aviation Administration disputed an independent watchdog\u2019s finding that safety inspectors who worked on training requirements for Boeing\u2019s 737 Max jets were underqualified. Ian Duncan reports: \u201cDeputy FAA Administrator Daniel K. Elwell also rejected the watchdog\u2019s finding that his agency had misled Congress over the issue, saying that was \u2018not what happened,\u2019 ... that making any connection between that problem and the 737 Max was \u2018simply not accurate.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Trump\u2019s Turnberry resort is the only hotel named by Glasgow Prestwick Airport in promotional materials distributed at private meetings with American military air crews. From The Scotsman: \u201cThe document, prepared by the Scottish Government owned airport and handed out at \u2018closed\u2019 meetings with US Armed Forces personnel, emphasizes the \u2018five star\u2019 status of the US president\u2019s flagship Scottish property, even noting how it has been \u2018newly refurbished.\u2019 Two sources familiar with the gatherings said Prestwick staff also delivered presentations in which they offered to arrange rounds of golf at Turnberry for visiting US Air Force (USAF) crews as part of their layovers.\u201d\n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani addresses the United Nations General Assembly. (Craig Ruttle/AP)\n\nTHE NEW WORLD ORDER:\n\n-- The White House banned Iranian officials from entering the U.S. just hours after a failed attempt to renew diplomacy with President Hassan Rouhani during the U.N. General Assembly, per the Times: \u201cMike Pompeo said the United States was still open to talking to Iran, and hoped to tamp down inflamed tensions after leaders in the United States, Europe and Arab nations blamed Tehran for attacks on oil fields in Saudi Arabia this month.\"\n\n-- Shortly after, Rouhani warned the Persian Gulf is \"on the edge of collapse.\" From the AP: \"Rouhani accused the United States of engaging in 'international piracy' against his country by re-imposing economic sanctions after Washington withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Tehran 'will never negotiate with an enemy that seeks to make Iran surrender with the weapon of poverty,' Rouhani said ... 'Stop the sanctions so as to open the way for the start of negotiations.' ... Rouhani said U.S. wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria had failed, with Washington 'unable to resolve the more sophisticated issues' plaguing the Middle East.\"\n\n-- Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, speaking about his role in journalist Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s murder for the first time, said it was done without his knowledge. From Frontline: \u201c\u2018It happened under my watch,\u2019 the Saudi leader [said.] \u2018I get all the responsibility, because it happened under my watch.\u2019 But he insists that it was without his knowledge. \u2026 [bin Salman was pressed] on how the murder could have happened without him knowing about it. \u2018We have 20 million people. We have 3 million government employees,\u2019 Prince Mohammed responded. \u2026 \u2018I have officials, ministers to follow things, and they\u2019re responsible, they have the authority to do that,\u2019 Prince Mohammed said.\u201d\n\n-- Israeli President Reuven Rivlin asked Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to try forming a new governing coalition. Steve Hendrix and Ruth Eglash report: \u201cRivlin\u2019s decision to offer Netanyahu the first go at forming a government came on the day that official results from last week\u2019s election were finalized, showing that the prime minister\u2019s Likud party had secured one seat fewer in the Knessett, Israel\u2019s parliament, than the rival Blue and White party headed by Benny Gantz. Neither of the two main parties is close to a 61-seat majority. But a plurality of all the newly elected parliament members told Rivlin that they preferred Netanyahu, earning him the president\u2019s nod.\u201d\n\n-- Returning to Westminster, Prime Minister Boris Johnson goaded opposition lawmakers to call a no-confidence vote or agree to a general election and bring the Brexit fight back to the people after the Supreme Court ruled his decision to suspend Parliament was illegal. William Booth and Karla Adam report: \u201cFacing a chamber packed with hooting and jeering lawmakers, Johnson said Britain\u2019s highest court was \u2018wrong to pronounce on what is essentially a political question at a time of great national controversy.\u2019 Rather than apologize to the queen and the country, as opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn demanded, Johnson went on the offensive, saying it was anti-Brexit forces in Parliament who were working against democracy, with their cunning maneuvers designed to sabotage a departure and thwart the will of the people.\u201d\n\n-- At least 70 countries have engaged in disinformation campaigns, according to a new report by researchers at Oxford University. From the NYT: \u201cIn Vietnam, citizens were enlisted to post pro-government messages on their personal Facebook pages. The Guatemalan government used hacked and stolen social media accounts to silence dissenting opinions. Ethiopia\u2019s ruling party hired people to influence social media conversations in its favor. Despite increased efforts by internet platforms like Facebook to combat internet disinformation, the use of the techniques by governments around the world is growing \u2026 The researchers \u2026 found that the number of countries with political disinformation campaigns more than doubled to 70 in the last two years, with evidence of at least one political party or government entity in each of those countries engaging in social media manipulation. In addition, Facebook remains the No. 1 social network for disinformation, the report said. Organized propaganda campaigns were found on the platform in 56 countries.\u201d\n\n-- Military drones are now common in nearly 100 nations, a new report found. From the WSJ: \u201cChina is a top exporter of drones alongside Israel and the U.S., according to the report. Pentagon officials have expressed concern over Beijing\u2019s dominance of the global market for small drones. There are at least 21,000 and probably more than 30,000 unmanned aerial vehicles in military service world-wide, the report says. It catalogs 171 types of drones in military inventories and 268 military-drone units established by 58 countries. Fifteen countries have training academies for drone operators, and seven maintain drone bases outside their own borders, according to the report.\u201d\n\nCindy McCain looks on in 2016 as John McCain celebrates winning reelection in Phoenix. (Ross D. Franklin/AP)\n\n2020 WATCH:\n\n-- Cindy McCain, widow of John McCain, criticized the GOP, saying it is no longer the party she and her husband belonged to. Kim Bellware reports: McCain, when asked to size up the political landscape heading into the 2020 election, \u201cpointed to the local GOP in Arizona and assessed that \u2018it\u2019s not functioning well\u2019 and excludes people who aren\u2019t \u2018walking the line.\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s just not right,\u2019 McCain said. \u2018That\u2019s not the party my husband and I belonged to.\u2019 While those issues may have McCain feeling alienated from the party, she predicted they could also have consequences for Republicans in 2020. Speaking about the Arizona GOP, she noted how the party\u2019s exclusionary views, as McCain described them, could fail to resonate with Arizona voters; the state\u2019s demographics increasingly include younger voters, a politically organized \u2014 and vocal \u2014 Latino population and transplants from around the country. \u2026 \u2018I can see [Arizona] going Democrat, I really can,\u2019 McCain said. \u2018I\u2019m not saying I want that, but I can see it happening.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Elizabeth Warren is rising everywhere, per CNN: \u201cThe latest Quinnipiac University national poll ... has Warren at 27% to [Biden\u2019s] 25%. Now, one poll doesn't mean much, and Quinnipiac's result is well within the margin of error, so there's no clear leader. ... The trendline is what is important here.\"\n\n-- A volunteer for Warren\u2019s campaign was killed in a car crash in western Iowa. Zachary Crombie Presberg, 22, joined the campaign as a summer organizing fellow and had stayed on as a volunteer. (Des Moines Register)\n\n-- More infighting: Top aides are privately questioning Bernie Sanders's strategy. From CNN: \u201cThe campaign's in-house production team recently began shooting its first television ads of the 2020 cycle in Iowa, likely quieting at least one source of dissent among some senior aides, who have been pushing for Sanders to get on the air. \u2026 Even if the senator and his staff have reason to believe the Iowa race is closer than the most recent polling indicates, interviews with two senior aides to Sanders revealed growing concerns that the Hawkeye State and New Hampshire could be at risk of slipping away. The twin sources of frustration and internal debate, both aides told CNN, was a schedule that too often takes Sanders away from the early voting states and a perception among staff, especially in Iowa, that the campaign has been wrong-headed in its decision to put off investing there in television ads.\u201d\n\n-- Biden\u2019s brother James Biden touted his ties to the former vice president\u2019s cancer initiative during an investment pitch to a health-care firm, according to Politico: James Biden \u201cmade the promise to executives at Florida-based Integrate Oral Care during a phone call on or around November 8, 2018, according to Michael Frey, CEO of Diverse Medical Management, a health-care firm that is suing James Biden. At the time, James Biden's business partners were pursuing a potential investment in Integrate, according to Frey and court records. Frey, who had a business relationship with James Biden and his associates, had introduced the group to Integrate. James Biden told the Integrate executives that he would get the Biden Cancer Initiative to promote an oral rinse made by the firm and used by cancer patients, Frey, [told Politico]. He added that James Biden directly invoked the former vice president on the call. 'He said his brother would be very excited about this product,' Frey said. A spokesman for James Biden disputed Frey's account.\u201d\n\n-- Cory Booker has crossed the halfway threshold to his $1.7 million fundraising goal.
