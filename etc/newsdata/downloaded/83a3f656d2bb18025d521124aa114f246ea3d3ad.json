Haste makes waste is one of them. Let\u2019s not be hasty here,\u201d the South Carolina Democrat said on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would hope it\u2019s before Christmas, but it may be after Thanksgiving as well,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to put a timeline on it, but that\u2019s kind of where I feel.\u201d\n\nHe said even if things slip into next year, it still wouldn\u2019t bump into the presidential primary schedule. The Iowa caucuses are scheduled for Feb. 3.\n\nMr. Clyburn, who is African-American, also responded to President Trump\u2019s referring to the impeachment process as a \u201clynching\u201d on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe president has always been pretty loose with his words, and this is another indication of that,\u201d the congressman said. \u201cI really believe this man is prone to inflammatory statements, and that is one word that no president ought to apply to himself.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump had said Republicans could impeach a Democratic president someday, even with a slim majority, \u201cwithout due process or fairness or any legal rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here - a lynching. But we will WIN!\u201d he said on Twitter.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
