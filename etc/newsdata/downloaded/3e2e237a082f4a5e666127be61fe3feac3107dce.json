Anthony Miller had a costly fumble. A blocked punt turned into a safety, and Chicago\u2019s defense looked tired in the second half.\n\nAt least the Bears were consistent. Each unit committed their share of mistakes.\n\nChicago flopped in its return from its bye week, looking overmatched in a 36-25 loss to Teddy Bridgewater and the New Orleans Saints on Sunday. Trubisky was back after being sidelined by a left shoulder injury, but the third-year quarterback turned in another shaky performance that invited more questions about his future with the team.\n\nThe Bears (3-3) scored their first offensive touchdown on Allen Robinson\u2019s 7-yard reception with 2:31 left, long after the outcome had been decided. The defense allowed a season-high 424 yards, including 151 on the ground.\n\nChicago had talked tough after it lost 24-21 to Oakland in its previous game on Oct. 6 in London. The defending NFC North champions vowed to turn it around, but they kept going in the same direction against the Saints (6-1).\n\nBackward.\n\nThe trouble started almost immediately. After going three-and-out on the first possession of the game, Pat O\u2019Donnell\u2019s punt was blocked by J.T. Gray. O\u2019Donnell alertly knocked the ball out of the back of the end zone for the safety, eliminating the Saints\u2019 chance for an early touchdown.\n\nAfter Miller fumbled on a rare carry for the wide receiver, Bridgewater threw a 7-yard touchdown pass to Josh Hill to make it 9-0 with 3:14 remaining in the first quarter.\n\nCordarrelle Patterson returned the ensuing kickoff 102 yards for a touchdown, giving the Bears a spark. They took their only lead of the day on Eddy Pineiro\u2019s 46-yard field goal with 11:33 left in the first half.\n\nBut New Orleans, playing without Drew Brees and leading rusher Alvin Kamara due to injuries, took over from there.\n\nBridgewater threw another TD pass, a 4-yarder to Taysom Hill, and Latavius Murray rushed for two scores as the Saints ripped off 27 straight points while the Bears offense stalled.\n\n___\n\nJay Cohen can be reached at https://twitter.com/jcohenap\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Mitchell Trubisky made a couple of bad throws.
