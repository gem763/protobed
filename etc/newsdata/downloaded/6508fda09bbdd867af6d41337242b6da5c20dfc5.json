The World Cup-winning U.S. women\u2019s soccer team made clear this summer it was not interested in meeting President Trump.\n\nBut on Monday, Trump, whose tenure has marked a new high \u2014 or low \u2014 in the politicization of White House sports ceremonies, basked in the reflected glow of a sporting legend nonetheless. In a 20-minute ceremony in the East Room, Trump presented the presidential Medal of Freedom to Mariano Rivera, the Hall of Fame relief pitcher for Trump\u2019s hometown team, the New York Yankees.\n\nThe medal is the highest civilian award \u2014 a companion to the better-known Medal of Honor for military valor \u2014 and Trump used the moment to lavish praise on Rivera, a Panamanian immigrant who rose to stardom in the Big Apple as, in the president\u2019s words, \u201cmaybe the greatest pitcher of all time.\u201d The president seemed at ease and steered clear of overt political references.\n\nIn all, the ceremony was the kind of feel-good, controversy-free photo op that is rare in the Trump era, and it represented something of a new model for this president to deal with athletes at a time when many \u2014 especially those who are racial minorities \u2014 have publicly boycotted the Trump White House and denounced his policies and rhetoric.\n\nRivera was the third former professional athlete to be awarded the Medal of Freedom in the past month, joining former National Basketball Association stars Bob Cousy and Jerry West. In May, Trump bestowed the honor on golfer Tiger Woods, an occasional business partner of the president.\n\nSince Trump awarded his first batch of civilian medals in November to a group that included former National Football League greats Roger Staubach and Alan Page, seven of the 12 people who have received the award under Trump have been athletic heroes.\n\nThe president\u2019s eagerness to honor ex-jocks was punctuated when he compared Rivera to another former Yankees star.\n\n\u201cThis year, Mariano became the first player unanimously elected to the baseball Hall of Fame,\u201d Trump read from his notes, before ad-libbing a question. \u201cOut of curiosity, Babe Ruth was not unanimous?\u201d\n\nTrump had posthumously awarded Ruth the medal last year, presenting it to his grandson Thomas Stevens.\n\nTrump is not the first president to recognize sports figures. Barack Obama, whose 123 awards were the most of any president, honored at least a dozen former professional athletes over eight years. But Trump is on pace to break that mark if he has a second term.\n\nChristopher Devine, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Dayton in Ohio who has studied the history of the Medal of Freedom, said Trump waited longer than other presidents to present his first batch of medals \u2014 more than 1\u00bd years after taking office.\n\nSince then, Trump has quickened his pace, Devine said, and he appears to favor feting individuals rather than groups, as Obama preferred, bestowing the honor one at a time.\n\nThe appeal for Trump, Devine suggested, is that \u201cthis is an event that he can control completely \u2014 it\u2019s up to him to choose who to give it to. Trump is someone who has really emphasized winning, so he probably finds it empowering to stand side-by-side and honor winners.\u201d\n\nWhile the Pentagon submits nominations for the Medal of Honor, U.S. presidents have traditionally enjoyed complete discretion on the Medal of Freedom, which has taken on political overtones.\n\nPast presidents have honored musicians, actors, politicians, scientists, authors, astronauts and even foreign leaders. Trump, like his predecessors, has honored some political allies, donors and supporters.\n\nIn that regard, Rivera, a co-chair of the President\u2019s Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition, has close ties to Trump\u2019s White House. In July, Rivera defended his support for the president after the Daily Beast published a lengthy, critical story accusing the former player of using his star power to promote Trump\u2019s agenda.\n\n\u201cHe was a friend of mine before he became president,\u201d Rivera said in July during an appearance on \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d \u201cSo because he\u2019s president, I will turn my back on him? No. I respect him. I respect what he does, and I believe he\u2019s doing the best for the United States of America.\u201d\n\nLike Woods, Rivera has had business ties to Trump. In 2014 and 2015, Rivera\u2019s foundation hosted fundraiser golf tournaments at Trump\u2019s course in Westchester County, N.Y., according to news reports and archived pages from the charity\u2019s website. The charity said in tax filings that it spent a combined $368,375 on those tournaments but did not specify how much of that went to Trump. The tournament moved to another site in 2016.\n\nNot all the athletes who have been honored have supported Trump\u2019s policies. Page, who became the first black justice on the Minnesota Supreme Court, had been critical of the president but said he would put politics aside to accept the honor.\n\nOthers have been more supportive. Cousy, the 91-year-old Boston Celtics legend, in his remarks at the White House called Trump \u201cthe most extraordinary president in my lifetime.\u201d After public criticism, Cousy told Boston Globe columnist Dan Shaughnessy that he had specifically used the word \u201cextraordinary\u201d to connote different meanings \u201cin the mind of the beholder.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Trump reveled in Rivera\u2019s exploits and highlighted his charitable foundation. But it was Rivera\u2019s brief turn at the lectern that was more remarkable, as he brushed up, perhaps inadvertently, against politically sensitive boundaries.\n\nReflecting on his early days in the United States three decades ago, he spoke of feeling depressed because he did not speak English. It was only after two teammates helped him learn did his spirits improve and his career take off, Rivera said, standing next to a president who has pushed an immigration policy that would prioritize English proficiency for migrants seeking green cards.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud to be an American,\u201d said Rivera, who became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2015. The audience stood to applaud.\n\nThe president clapped, too, before departing the stage to the strains to Frank Sinatra\u2019s \u201cNew York, New York.\u201d\n\nDavid Fahrenthold contributed to this report.", "description": "The president awarded the Medal of Freedom to baseball legend Mariano Rivera, the latest in a growing list of sports stars to be honored.", "authors": ["David Nakamura", "Reporter Covering The White House", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/sNGvOvqgmAe6ror1DApFSIKxTDU=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VSYFMMWYYQI6TP5RQSMIONUUOY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
