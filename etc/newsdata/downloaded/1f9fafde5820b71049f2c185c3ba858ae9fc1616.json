Bush, taking her and her twin sister, Barbara, to a Texas Rangers game.\n\nThe 37-year-old Today show host posted the image after she traveled to Arlington, Texas, with her six-year-old daughter, Mila, to watch the team's last game at Globe Life Park.\n\n'Although I\u2019m back home, my heart is still in Texas. I was surprised how emotional it was to take Mila to her first game (the last game in the stadium her Jefe helped build) but then I saw this picture,' she captioned the image.\n\nSo sweet: Jenna, 37, shared a photo of her father, former President George W. Bush, taking her and her twin sister Barbara to a Texas Rangers game when they were kids\n\nPrecious: A few days later, the mom celebrated her baby boy, Hal, turning two months old by sharing two new portraits of him\n\n'This was my childhood: my parents brought us to almost every game. Baseball meant family. It meant slow evenings under the stars, bubble gum and conversations about everything and nothing. How lucky we were. How lucky I am.'\n\nThe snapshot, which appears to have been taken in the late '80s or early '90s, shows the former president decked out in a Rangers bomber jacket while holding his daughters' hands in front of the stadium.\n\nYoung Jenna is wearing a denim jacket over a purple sweatshirt while Barbara is sporting an adult-size Rangers bomber that went down to her knees.\n\nA few days after her nostalgic post, the mother of three celebrated her son, Hal, turning two months old by sharing new portraits of her baby boy, which were taken by Today show photographer Nathan Congleton.\n\n'Two months (and a day!!) with the sweetest Hal-pal in the whole world,' she wrote, using a nickname that her daughters Mila and Poppy had given to their little brother.\n\nTradition: The images were taken Today show photographer Nathan Congleton, who has photographed Jenna's children before\n\nMama's boy: Jenna can be seen cradling her only son in one sweet black and white photo\n\nIn the first photo, Hal is sound asleep with his little hand tucked underneath his cheek. The next images show him stretching his arms in the air after waking up.\n\nThe final shot is a stunning black and white picture of the proud mom cradling her only son in her arms.\n\nJenna and her husband, Henry Hager, welcomed Hal on August 2. She has spent the past two months on maternity leave, but that hasn't stopped her from traveling.\n\nThe former first daughter spent some quality time in Texas with her family last week, an it seems like it was an unforgettable trip.\n\nJenna and Mila were among the members of the Bush family who watched the Texas Rangers play the New York Yankees at the team's last game at Globe Life Park on Sunday.\n\nMilestone: On Sunday, Jenna took to her six-year-old daughter, Mila, to her first baseball game. They watched the Texas Rangers last game at Globe Life Park in Arlington\n\nAll together: Jenna's parents, George W. and Laura Bush, were also in attendance at the bittersweet game\n\nShe shared plenty of family photos from the bittersweet event, including pictures of her parents, George W. and Laura Bush.\n\n'Sweetest first baseball game for Mila\u2014last game in the stadium that for the last 26 years brought us so many memories,' Jenna captioned the images.\n\n'I was Mila\u2019s age when my dad first started working for the Rangers, taught me to keep score and under these Texas stars we met some dear friends.'\n\nJenna's father co-owned the Rangers and served as the team's managing general partner for five years before he sold his shares in 1998.\n\nThe Texas Rangers have called Globe Life Park home for 26 seasons, and it was a joyous end of an era.\n\nToo cute: Another snapshot shows little Mila smiling for the camera while sitting on her grandfather's lap with a unicorn scarf wrapped around her head\n\nFamily friends: Jenna also posted a picture of herself with designer Lela Rose, whose late father, Rusty Rose, co-owned the Rangers with George W.\n\nThe team played their last three games against the New York Yankees at the baseball park, and fans watched them win Sunday's finale.\n\nJenna shared a sweet photo of herself holding Mila on her lap while posing with her parents. The mother and daughter both had on blue Texas Rangers caps, while her father donned on a red version.\n\nInstead of wearing red and blue, Jenna's mother, Laura, looked pristine in a crisp white tunic and matching visor.\n\nAnother snapshot shows little Mila smiling for the camera while sitting on her grandfather's lap with a unicorn scarf wrapped around her head.\n\nJenna also posted a picture of herself with her close friend Lela Rose, whom she has known for years.\n\nThe designer's late father, Rusty Rose, was George W.'s investment partner and co-owned the Rangers with him.\n\nHappy: Laura posted a group shot on Instagram, writing: 'We had a fantastic time cheering for the Texas Rangers during their final game at Globe Life Park in Arlington!'\n\nClose as can be: Over the weekend, Jenna posted a sweet photo of her son, Hal, being held by her twin sister, Barbara Bush, while promoting their upcoming children's book, 'Sisters First'\n\nLela was likely one of the 'dear friends' Jenna referred to in her emotional Instagram caption about the stadium.\n\nWhile Jenna was enjoying some one-on-one time with her eldest child, her four-year-old daughter, Poppy, and baby boy, Hal, were likely at home with their father, Henry.\n\nJenna's twin sister didn't appear at the game either, as the Today star would have undoubtedly shared a snapshot of herself with her only sibling.\n\nThe day before the game, she promoted their upcoming children's book, 'Sisters First,' with a heartwarming picture of herself with Barbara, who is cradling baby Hal.\n\nJenna and Barbara co-wrote the book, which shares the name of their 2017 memoir 'Sisters First: Stories from Our Wild and Wonderful Life.'\n\nTheir latest book will be released on November 12, and Jenna is clearly excited to embark on another promotional tour with her sister.\n\n'Sisters First (and a little mister!) This show is going on the road. Come see us!!! Bring your sister or mister!
