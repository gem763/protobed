There's something wrong with them,' witness Holl Belle can be heard saying in the video. 'It's a whole flock. That's odd.'\n\nThe footage shows more than 300 hundred chimney swifts strewn across the ground after flying into the glass-fronted museum at 11:00pm yesterday night\n\nOfficials from the Carolina Waterfowl rescue were summoned to the scene to reports that dozens of birds were dying as they repeatedly dived straight into the building's windows (seen above), in a bizarre occurrence that had been going on for more than an hour\n\nThe scene became stranger still, according to Belle, who watched on as some of the birds got up from the ground and tried 'killing themselves again' by flying into different buildings near-by.\n\nIn total, 310 birds were involved in the incident, a third of which were already dead by the time members of Carolina Waterfowl Rescue team arrived.\n\nTen of the birds had to be euthanized at the scene and 100 were severely injured with broken wings, legs or other serious fractures.\n\nThe remaining birds appeared to be stunned and rescuers are hoping to release them in the coming days when they're fully healthy.\n\nBelle, who works at the museum, told to the Charlotte Observer that Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police helped to pick up the downed birds, telling employees to get back inside.\n\nIn total, 310 birds were involved in the incident, a third of which were already dead by the time members of Carolina Waterfoul rescue team arrived\n\nTen of the birds had to be euthanized at the scene and 100 were severely injured with broken wings, legs or other serious fractures. The remaining birds appeared to be stunned and rescuers are hoping to release them in the coming days when they're fully healthy\n\nThough in folk culture and films birds are often considered harbingers of death, foreboding impending doom, experts from the Ornithology department at Cornell University insist there may be a more simple explanation behind Tuesday night's events.\n\nIn a link shared on the Carolina Waterfowl Rescue Facebook page, the university explained that birds often fly into windows at night because they're attracted to the lights inside.\n\nAt night, nocturnal migrants (including most songbirds) crash because they fly into lighted windows,' the school explained. 'Some of these nighttime collisions are due to chance, but much more often the nocturnal migrants are lured to their deaths by the lights.'\n\nAdditionally, the birds are more susceptible to flying into buildings in the fall when they start migrating.\n\n'For reasons not entirely understood, lights divert nocturnal migrants from their original path, especially in low-ceiling or foggy conditions. In the lighted area, they mill about, sometimes colliding with one another or the lighted structure,' the school continued.\n\nCarolina Waterfowl Rescue is seeking donations to help care for the injured birds. So far the group has raised $3,000\n\nRescuers said the injuries varied from stuns to broken wings\n\nCornell University has not yet responded to a DailyMail.com request for additional comment.\n\nCarolina Waterfowl Rescue is seeking donations to help care for the injured birds. So far the group has raised $3,000.\n\n'Chimney swifts are aerial insectivores and require hand feeding lots of worms,' Carolina Waterfowl Rescue said on Facebook.\n\n'It's an expensive endeavor but these birds are an incredible contributor to our eco system and eat hundreds of mosquitos a day.'", "description": "The footage shows more than 300 hundred chimney swifts strewn across the ground after flying into the glass-fronted NASCAR Hall of Fame in Charlotte at 11:00pm yesterday night.", "authors": ["Luke Kenton For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/16/19795284-0-image-a-18_1571240714131.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
