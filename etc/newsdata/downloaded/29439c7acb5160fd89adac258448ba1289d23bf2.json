How can we tell? Dividend paying companies with growing earnings can be highly rewarding in the long term. On the other hand, investors have been known to buy a stock because of its yield, and then lose money if the company's dividend doesn't live up to expectations.\n\nA 1.5% yield is nothing to get excited about, but investors probably think the long payment history suggests Nahar Poly Films has some staying power. When buying stocks for their dividends, you should always run through the checks below, to see if the dividend looks sustainable.\n\nExplore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on Nahar Poly Films!\n\nNSEI:NAHARPOLY Historical Dividend Yield, September 7th 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nDividends are usually paid out of company earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. As a result, we should always investigate whether a company can afford its dividend, measured as a percentage of a company's net income after tax. In the last year, Nahar Poly Films paid out 10% of its profit as dividends. With a low payout ratio, it looks like the dividend is comprehensively covered by earnings.\n\nIn addition to comparing dividends against profits, we should inspect whether the company generated enough cash to pay its dividend. Nahar Poly Films paid out 7.3% of its free cash flow as dividends last year, which is conservative and suggests the dividend is sustainable. It's positive to see that Nahar Poly Films's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.\n\nWe update our data on Nahar Poly Films every 24 hours, so you can always get our latest analysis of its financial health, here.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nOne of the major risks of relying on dividend income, is the potential for a company to struggle financially and cut its dividend. Not only is your income cut, but the value of your investment declines as well - nasty. Nahar Poly Films has been paying dividends for a long time, but for the purpose of this analysis, we only examine the past 10 years of payments. Its dividend payments have fallen by 20% or more on at least one occasion over the past ten years. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was \u20b90.35 in 2009, compared to \u20b90.50 last year. Dividends per share have grown at approximately 3.6% per year over this time. The dividends haven't grown at precisely 3.6% every year, but this is a useful way to average out the historical rate of growth.\n\nModest growth in the dividend is good to see, but we think this is offset by historical cuts to the payments. It is hard to live on a dividend income if the company's earnings are not consistent.\n\nDividend Growth Potential\n\nWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share (EPS) are growing - it's not worth taking the risk on a dividend getting cut, unless you might be rewarded with larger dividends in future. Strong earnings per share (EPS) growth might encourage our interest in the company despite fluctuating dividends, which is why it's great to see Nahar Poly Films has grown its earnings per share at 110% per annum over the past five years. Earnings per share have grown rapidly, and the company is retaining a majority of its earnings. We think this is ideal from an investment perspective, if the company is able to reinvest these earnings effectively.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Is Nahar Poly Films Limited (NSE:NAHARPOLY) a good dividend stock?
