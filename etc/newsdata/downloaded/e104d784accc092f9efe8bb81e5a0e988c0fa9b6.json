REUTERS/Issei Kato/File Photo\n\nExpect Ferrari and Red Bull, as well as Mercedes team mate Valtteri Bottas, to go flat out to make him wait at least until Texas, the following weekend, to step closer to Schumacher\u2019s record seven titles.\n\nSole rival Bottas is 64 points behind and Hamilton needs to score 14 points more than the Finn.\n\nThat means a podium finish as the bare minimum if the 34-year-old is to seal the championship with three races to spare, and history suggests that will be no easy matter.\n\nHamilton has not finished in the top three at Formula One\u2019s highest altitude circuit, the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez which stands at 2,285 metres above sea level, since he won there in 2016.\n\n\u201cI think Mexico is generally our worst race of the year because of the way our car is set up and it\u2019s going to be a tough one for us,\u201d he said after the Japanese Grand Prix.\n\nTeam boss Toto Wolff agreed: \u201cThe four remaining races are not going to be easy and we expect Mexico to be the most difficult one for us.\u201d\n\nIf the champions struggle in the thin air, as they have for the past two years, then Ferrari and Red Bull can scent an opportunity.\n\nRed Bull\u2019s Max Verstappen is chasing an unprecedented Mexican hat-trick after winning in 2017 and 2018 while Ferrari\u2019s Sebastian Vettel and Charles Leclerc have started the last five races on pole position between them.\n\nSince Mexico returned to the calendar in 2015, the winner has always come from the front row.\n\nLast year\u2019s race ended without a Mercedes driver on the podium, while Hamilton was only ninth in 2017.\n\nWhile Verstappen \u2014 twice a winner this year with his Honda-powered team \u2014 has been playing down his chances, sceptics will recall he also did that last year.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s one track left this season where we can do a particularly good job,\u201d motorsport.com quoted the Dutch youngster as saying after the Japanese Grand Prix.\n\n\u201cIf we can just finish close to the podium or on the podium every weekend, then I think that\u2019s the maximum for us at the moment.\u201d\n\nNot since 1990 has a Ferrari driver triumphed in Mexico, a statistic that sounds significant only until you realise there was a 23-year gap until 2015, but the omens are looking promising.\n\nFerrari have been faster than anyone over a single lap and on the straights.\n\nHamilton and Bottas, the winner in Japan, will be able to race without any team considerations now that Mercedes have clinched the constructors\u2019 title for a sixth year in a row and an unprecedented sixth successive title double.\n\nThe last back-to-back round of the season is a sell-out for the fifth year in a row. Racing Point\u2019s Sergio Perez is again the only Mexican on the starting grid.", "description": "Lewis Hamilton looks sure to join Michael Schumacher as only the second six-times Formula One world champion but the Briton will need to do something special to achieve the feat in Mexico on Sunday.", "authors": ["Alan Baldwin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444142927&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M1CZ-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
