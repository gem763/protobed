All that jockeying within the industry has led to a boom for investment bankers, who help companies raise money, go public, and pursue M&A.\n\nUnder its former CEO, Bruce Linton, Canopy Growth was perhaps the most active of publicly-traded cannabis companies, as it landed a $4 billion investment from the beer giant Constellation Brands, and orchestrated the first Canada-to-US cannabis acquisition with its complex deal to acquire Acreage Holdings.\n\nRead more: Meet the bigshot lawyers who are turning weed into a $194 billion industry\n\nUS cannabis company Curaleaf is hot on its heels, having closed two near-billion-dollar acquisitions in the past six months. Because most cannabis startups can't access traditional venture capital, many raced to go public through a process known as a reverse merger last year on the Canadian Securities Exchange to fund their growth \u2014 providing a windfall for the bankers who orchestrated these deals.\n\nMost of the fees from these and similar deals are flowing to boutique and midsize Canadian investment banks (cannabis is federally legal in Canada) that took the initial risk of working in an industry with a hazy regulatory structure in the US. Federal illegality has frozen the biggest US banks from competing on these deals, and most still remain on the sidelines.\n\nCanaccord Genuity, a midsize Canadian investment bank headquartered in Toronto and Vancouver, has grabbed the largest share of fees from the cannabis industry, according to data from Dealogic. As of September 23, Canaccord has netted $122 million in fees from cannabis deals across equity capital markets, M&A, debt capital markets, and loans, amounting to an 18% share of all fees generated from cannabis deals.\n\nRead more: The top 12 venture-capital firms making deals in the booming cannabis industry\n\nWhile the top-tier US banks are mostly sitting on the sidelines for now, some, like Goldman Sachs, have advised existing clients on cannabis deals.\n\nIn an effort to figure out who's making money on these deals, Business Insider put together a list of the top dealmakers in the cannabis industry, based on Dealogic data. We then conducted additional reporting to identify the top cannabis bankers at those firms.\n\nThis chart is up-to-date as of September 23. It shows the top ten banks working on cannabis deals and an estimate of how much money they've made in cannabis since 2015, primarily from deals and stock offerings.\n\nShayanne Gal/Business Insider\n\nHere's the list, organized in order of the league table:", "description": "Here's an exclusive look at which banks \u2014 and bankers \u2014 are making millions on cannabis deals.", "authors": ["Jeremy Berke"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8cd00a2e22af00d3252ac9?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
