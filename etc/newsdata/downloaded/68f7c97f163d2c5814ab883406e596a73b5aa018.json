That\u2019s due to a core of veteran players who have been together for three consecutive playoff appearances, and some flashy prospects that appear ready to play in the NHL.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gone through everything: expectation, counted out, wondering what\u2019s going to go on, Dumpster fire, whatever you want to call it, and we found our way through it, we navigated through it,\u201d captain Nick Foligno said . \u201cI think we have really good stability now in our locker room, I think our core has been together awhile now and really understands each other. I\u2019ve got great guys to lean on.\u201d\n\nCoach John Tortorella is already tired of talking about life after Bobrovsky and Panarin. He told reporters at the season-opening media session that he wouldn\u2019t answer questions about them anymore. He\u2019s also had it with the predictions of doom.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s put a huge chip on my shoulder before it\u2019s even started here,\u201d Tortorella said. \u201cUsually I have a chip on my shoulder about something else. \u2026 But this one here, it\u2019s in place and has been in place for me for a number of weeks now as people talk at me. So we\u2019re going to go about our business the way we think we need to go about it.\u201d\n\nThe bottom line is that veterans like Foligno, Cam Atkinson or Pierre-Luc Dubois are going to have to turn in career seasons to make up for Panarin\u2019s 87 points from last year. And either veteran Joonas Korpisalo, rookie Elvis Merzlikins or someone else is going to have to be a reliable, everyday goalie.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to this year because they want to be here, they want to be in this city,\u201d Tortorella said. \u201cThat\u2019s really important as we keep on pushing through here. I think it can galvanize you to be a better person and better player when you\u2019re happy with where you\u2019re at, who you\u2019re doing it with.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the Blue Jackets\u2019 season:\n\nWHO\u2019S HERE: F Gustav Nyquist (22-38-60 last year with Detroit and San Jose)\n\nWHO\u2019S NOT: G Sergei Bobrovsky, F Artemi Panarin, F Matt Duchene, F Ryan Dzingel, D Adam McQuaid.\n\nKEY PLAYERS: With the loss of Panarin, veteran scorers will be asked to give more. The Blue Jackets still have one of the best blue lines in the NHL with all-stars Seth Jones and Zach Werenski, who just inked a three-year contract extension. Forward Josh Anderson seems ready to take charge, while it could be a make-or-break year for underachieving center Alexander Wennberg.\n\nOUTLOOK: Fans kept waiting for general manager Jarmo Kekalainen to make an offseason blockbuster deal that never came. As a result, a group of familiar players will try to fill the void left by Panarin. The bigger question is the goaltending.\n\nPREDICTION: The Blue Jackets caught fire down the stretch last season, won an Eastern Division wild card slot in the 81st game and pulled off a stunning first-round playoff sweep of the Lightning, the NHL\u2019s best team. Columbus was ousted in the second round by Boston but energized a hungry fan base. Unless some familiar names can pick up the slack, Columbus could be on the outside looking in this time around.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nFollow Mitch Stacy on Twitter at https://twitter.com/mitchstacy\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Columbus Blue Jackets played under a cloud last season created by two stars who didn't want to be there.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Mitch Stacy"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/23/penguins_blue_jackets_hockey_35544_c0-315-3307-2243_s1770x1032.jpg?a2caa2a5445cbea8061d410e0b1bc256c1af7c2b", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
