She also lost a tooth and is likely to lose two more and faces weeks on liquid food, reports Hull Live .\n\n(Image: Hull Live/MEN MEDIA)\n\nThe former waitress faces several weeks in recovery after the incident after having to undergo a two-hour operation on her broken jaw, with metal plates fitted to hold her face together.\n\nJade - who is too upset and embarrassed to show her face in new photographs - has instructed personal injury expert Hudgell Solicitors.\n\nThe law firm is now calling for a \"full and transparent\" investigation to provide Jade with answers.\n\nRe-living the ordeal, Jade said she just remembers waking up, laid on her back, with a mouth full of blood.\n\nShe said: \"I remember the process of getting on the ride, the ride started, and as it started, the barrier clicked a bit, I said to my friend 'Did yours just click?' and he said 'yes', so I thought that was fine.\n\n(Image: Hull Live/MEN MEDIA)\n\n\"We must have been half way through the ride, it was bouncing a lot, spinning us around, it was OK, but then the actual carriage position of it changed, so all our weight was facing forwards onto the bar. My body was being pushed forwards and into the barrier.\n\n\"It started to bounce and that's when remember it tilting \u2013 I was worried about coming out but that's the last thing I remember thinking.\n\n\"I remember the sensation of falling out, but I don't remember what I was thinking. There wasn't a period where I thought the barrier was coming loose, it just happened all at once.\n\n\"I just remember seeing silver, as if it was the floor, I would have said I fell out and dropped straight to the ground below, I didn't know I had been flown through the air like a ragdoll until my mum told me in hospital.\"\n\n(Image: Hull Live/MEN MEDIA)\n\nJade says she woke up, surrounded by strangers and at first she thought she was in a dream.\n\n\"I just remember being laid there and looking in the sky, and I could see the Star Flyer ride.\n\n\"People have said I looked like I was dead, with my eyes open. I thought it was a dream, I gave it a minute and then realised it wasn't a dream and that's when I started to panic and people were telling me not to move.\n\n\"I thought I'd lost all of my teeth, my mouth felt like it had been scrambled.\n\n\"I could see my friend, I could hear people saying 'how old is she' and asking him questions about me \u2013 I was trying to speak but because of what had happened, my mouth was full of blood.\"\n\nJade said she does not normally go on bigger rides, but her friend had persuaded her to go on it shortly after they arrived on the evening of Monday, October 7.\n\n(Image: Hull Live/MEN MEDIA)\n\nThe ride is believed to be the same one which killed an eight-year-old girl in Australia five years ago.\n\nDue to her nerves about rides, she immediately pulled down her own safety barrier. She said the attendant then came and took her \u00a33 ride fare and fastened the seatbelt.\n\nShe said: \u201cI pulled the safety bar down myself as soon as I got on as I get paranoid that rides are going to set off without my barrier being down.\"\n\nJade says she is not an \"angry sort of person\" but has been left angry about what happened to her.\n\nShe said: \"The barrier must have come free, and when that happened my life was left relying on the clasp and buckle of an old seat belt. How can that be right?\n\nPolice and the Health and Safety Executive have been investigating the incident.\n\nJade said: \u201cI feel angry as nobody should go to a fair and be thrown from a ride. It is disgusting really and when I think about how it happened it makes me angry that the that the safety systems simply didn\u2019t do their job.\"\n\nShe has since been told the ride was not stopped after her fall, and instead continued until its session finished.\n\nJade has tried not to think too much about what could have happened.\n\nShe said: \"I feel lucky to be alive, or to have come away from this without a brain or spinal injury which would have left me paralysed for life, so I do feel lucky in a way.\n\n\"I\u2019ve tried not to think too much about what could have happened to me. What I have thought about a lot is how really small children are allowed to go on these fast rides at the fair, and how dangerous they are.\n\n(Image: Hull Live/MEN MEDIA)\n\n\"My little sister is nine years old and I\u2019d hate to think of this happening to her. I'm angry this could have happened to my little sister, it could have happened to a child, and they might not have been as fortunate as me.\"\n\nJade, who had recently left her job as a barmaid, now fears she might lose the new job she was due to start this week in a call centre.\n\nShe said she is taking her recovery one day at a time, and feels battered and bruised and struggles to walk.\n\nShe said: \"My face is still really swollen, I can't smile, it worries me that my mouth will never feel the same again, I also have a big gash on my chin which was sewn up in surgery.\n\n\"I've gone through a mixture of emotions, sometimes I'm really low and upset, if I have a bad day, I don\u2019t want to talk to anyone, I feel like I wont ever be the same person again, I'll be anxious to do everything.\"\n\nJade says she has grown up going to Hull Fair and does not want her accident to tarnish childhood memories.\n\nShe is now being supported by her solicitor, but said her main aim is to find out exactly what happened and for any safety improvements that need to be made, to be made - not just compensation.\n\nShe said: \"If I could have that ride scrapped and put out of business, never to be used again but I didn't get any compensation then at least I've achieved something and saved someone from losing a life or losing their child or going though what I've gone through.\n\n\"If the ride came back next year I would be very very angry.\"\n\nInjury claims specialist lawyer Becci Ashfield said: \"Jade has sadly experienced everybody's nightmare when going on a ride at the fair.\n\n\"This is quite simply something which should never happen and a full and transparent investigation is now needed to bring answers as to how and why Jade came to be thrown from the ride and suffer her injuries.\n\n\"It is also vital that lessons are learned to avoid similar incidents happening again. That is vital for the confidence of the many thousands - of all ages - who attend fairs like this up and down the country and should be able to do so in the knowledge that they are completely safe on all rides.\n\n\"Jade has suffered significant physical injuries, which incredibly and thankfully are not life-changing. They are, nonetheless, substantial and very traumatic for a young woman to deal with.\n\n\"There could also be a significant long-term psychological impact of this accident on her, and we will ensure this is fully investigated and taken into account.\"\n\nHull Fair bosses say thrill seekers have more chance of being \"struck by lightning in Sainsbury's\" than being thrown off a ride.\n\nGarry Leach, who is chairman of the Showmen\u2019s Guild, says ride operators are \"devastated\" by what happened on the Airmaxx 360 and that they were doing all they could to assist the Health and Safety Executive, which is leading the investigation.\n\nMr Leach told Hull Live he could not confirm the ride is the actual ride which killed an eight-year-old girl in Australia, but did say it was exactly the same type as the one that operated in Australia.", "description": "Jade Harrison wants the Airmaxx 360 scrapped for good after being flung from the ride at Hull Fair in a traumatic ordeal that left her needing facial surgery", "authors": ["Joanna Lovell", "Image", "Hull Live Men Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20589023.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_HUL_Jade-Harrison-04.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
