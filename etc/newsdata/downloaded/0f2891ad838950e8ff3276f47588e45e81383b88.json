Trump and Netanyahu haven\u2019t spoken on the phone in five weeks. Their last phone call was three days before the Sept. 17 elections, when Trump tweeted that he discussed with Netanyahu the possibility of a U.S.-Israel defense treaty.", "description": "It came shortly after the Israeli prime minister announced he had failed form a government for the second time in six months.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/UpUdw_jpGbrhbLGh7qoF2ygQ-gY=/0x184:671x561/1920x1080/2019/10/22/1571756250222.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
