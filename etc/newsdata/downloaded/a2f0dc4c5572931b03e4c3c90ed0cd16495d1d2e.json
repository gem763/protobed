It is also one of the few school systems that uses standardized tests to sort incoming kindergarteners into separate \u201cgifted\u201d and non-gifted educational tracks.\n\nThis week, Bill de Blasio\u2019s school-integration advisory group suggested that these two facts are related. In fact, the mayor\u2019s advisers argued that gifted programs are a leading driver of segregation in the city\u2019s schools, and should therefore be phased out. Much of the city\u2019s (famously liberal) public responded with incredulous outrage.\n\nOn one level, it\u2019s difficult to see why. Recent national surveys have found that a large majority of American voters see school segregation as a problem, and believe more must be done to combat it. In deep-blue NYC, that percentage is surely even higher. Meanwhile, it isn\u2019t hard to discern why sorting students into separate programs based on their test scores at age 4 would exacerbate the problem. Public resources for early childhood development are limited, while the private resources that affluent families can invest in their children\u2019s development (and/or test prep) are extensive. Thus, assessments of a child\u2019s academic aptitude before entering kindergarten are bound to function largely as an index of their parents\u2019 socioeconomic status. And since class position and race are closely correlated in the United States (due to the legacy of centuries of de jure and de facto anti-black discrimination), one would expect the city\u2019s \u201cgifted\u201d program to bring its classrooms into closer alignment with George Wallace\u2019s ideal. And one would be right: Black and Latino students comprise 65 percent of all NYC kindergarteners, but just 18 percent of those enrolled in gifted programs.\n\nWaiting until later grades to separate gifted and non-gifted pupils might mitigate this inequity. But racial and class-based disparities in admissions to selective middle and high schools makes clear that merely delaying the onset of tracking would not prevent it from exacerbating segregation.\n\nThus, if the city genuinely wishes to integrate its schools, the mayor\u2019s advisers say that it should phase out the selective gifted and talented programs altogether, while also curbing the use of exclusionary admissions criteria at public middle schools (notably, the report declines to call for eliminating the city\u2019s selective high schools). Instead of relying on these screening mechanisms to cultivate students\u2019 individual gifts \u2014 and cater to their disparate paces of learning \u2014 the group recommends the adoption of \u201cequitable enrichment alternatives.\u201d Local districts would be empowered to work out the precise details of such alternatives, but Chalkbeat summarizes the basic concept:\n\nSchoolwide enrichment \u201cis really flipping the whole idea on its head,\u201d said Allison Roda, a professor at Molloy College who has studied the city\u2019s gifted programs. \u201cInstead of sorting students based on perceived ability and whether they can pass a test when they\u2019re 4 years old, the school\u2019s job is to find out what those gifts and talents are and to develop them.\u201d\n\nFor younger children, that could mean setting up small groups of students who are pulled out of their classrooms to learn the basics of photography. In middle and high school, staff can give students questionnaires about their interests and use that information to set up electives that could include topics ranging from robotics to journalism.\n\nThese breakout electives could be complemented by the \u201copen honors\u201d model used at many charter schools in California, a model that enrolls students of all performance levels in the same classes but allows the fast learners to earn honors credits by completing bonus assignments. As the Century Foundation\u2019s Halley Potter notes, San Diego\u2019s High Tech High has become one of that city\u2019s top-performing schools, while simultaneously eliminating the racial gap in honors enrollment, by embracing \u201copen honors.\u201d\n\nAlthough there have been a few instances in which poorly designed de-tracking schemes have corresponded with declines in student achievement, this is not the norm. And the broader research suggests that tracking and selective admissions do significant harm to \u201cnon-gifted\u201d students, while providing little to no discernible benefit to \u201cgifted\u201d ones (for example, multiple studies have found that attending a selective high school populated by \u201chigh-achievers\u201d does not actually make a student more likely to graduate from college, or attend a higher-quality university). Which is to say that tracking and selective admissions reliably segregate schools along socioeconomic and racial lines, and damage outcomes for the disproportionately low-income and nonwhite students consigned to lower levels, while accomplishing little else.\n\nAll this said, it isn\u2019t actually difficult to understand why the panel\u2019s proposal has already inspired vehement opposition from a diverse array of city officials and interest groups, from the Bronx Borough president (whose constituents\u2019 children are almost all shut out of gifted programs), to the teachers unions, to likely 2021 mayoral candidates. Simply put: New York City can de-track its schools, but it can\u2019t de-track a neo\u2013Gilded Age economy in which economic security is rationed through an elaborate system of competitive credentialing. In an age when wage growth for noncollege workers is tepid \u2014 and the costs of health care and housing are soaring \u2014 those who wish to escape financial precariousness \u2014 let alone attain upper-middle-class affluence \u2014 must separate themselves from the (disproportionately black and brown) ranks of the unchosen at some point.\n\nThe stakes of separating your child\u2019s fate from that of her median peer, by steering her onto the path to a diploma from a respectable university, are objectively high. And for the typical professional-class family, the subjective stakes are even higher; to allow one\u2019s children to stumble down the socioeconomic ladder is to have failed as a parent. Middle-class parents are willing to make enormous sacrifices, and take on massive debt, to avert such failure. In this context, a program that marks one\u2019s child as gifted \u2014 and expedites her elevation from the doomed majority that lacks that which \u201cthe knowledge economy\u201d requires \u2014 is a vital source of reassurance that all is going according to plan. Some bureaucrat\u2019s white paper might say that selective high schools do not outperform nonselective ones once you control for the composition of the student body. But for the typical parent, peer-reviewed studies are less compelling than the knowledge that their kid is \u201con track\u201d or the sight of her walking the halls of the \u201cgood\u201d school, surrounded by the \u201cright\u201d crowd.\n\nAdd to this the reality that optimizing instruction for a mixed-aptitude classroom is genuinely challenging and can be done in a manner that frustrates more advanced students, and that many high-performing middle-class students will feel more comfortable in classrooms populated by people like them, and it\u2019s easy to see why the mayor\u2019s office\u2019s plan would strike a nerve. While there is broad consensus against race-based segregation in schools, affluent parents feel little shame in seeking out socioeconomically segregated learning environments for their kin. Part of why New York City\u2019s gifted programs were established in the first place was to offer upper-middle-class families an alternative to moving their kids to affluent suburbs or private schools, which is to say, to forestall them from using an alternative means of keeping their children\u2019s learning environment from being excessively socioeconomically diverse.\n\nCritically, the appeal of screening is not limited to parents anxious to keep their children ensconced in the middle class; it is also prevalent among those most committed to seeing their progeny escape the precariousness of their own circumstances. Many black and Hispanic working-class parents who are highly involved in their children\u2019s educations (and thus, more likely to pay close attention to education policy and vote in elections) desperately want their children to have the opportunity to distinguish themselves from their peers, and claim membership in the elect, for much the same reasons that more-privileged parents do. Thus, many lawmakers who represent nonwhite, working-class areas are much less interested in eliminating gifted programs than expanding (without universalizing) access to them. As the New York Times reports:\n\nOver the last few years, Robert E. Cornegy Jr., a councilman from Brooklyn, has fought to have gifted programs restored in largely low-income and black neighborhoods, like Bedford-Stuyvesant. He said he would resist any effort to eliminate gifted programs because \u201cthe segregation argument doesn\u2019t equate in communities of color.\u201d The proposals, Mr. Cornegy said, sound like they came from a group of \u201cuber liberals.\u201d \u201cIf you eliminate the gifted and talented program it eliminates the chances of getting into specialized programs and institutions of higher learning,\u201d he said. \u201cJust like there\u2019s a pipeline to prison, there is a pipeline to higher academic success and college.\u201d\n\nThe mayor\u2019s office\u2019s recommendations are worthwhile. And it is difficult to see how the city\u2019s schools can be desegregated unless tracking is scaled back. But so long as acquiring select credentials \u2014 and social distance from working-class people \u2014 are prerequisites for getting ahead in our economy, many parents are bound to demand that their children have the opportunity to acquire such distinctions in their schools.", "description": "Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s integration advisory group has recommended eliminating gifted and talented programs in New York City\u2019s public schools.
