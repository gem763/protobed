If you want a 2-in-1 tablet, you can now choose between a Surface Pro 7 or a Surface Pro X. If you want a traditional clamshell laptop, you can now choose between a 13.5-inch Surface Laptop 3 or a larger 15-inch model. I\u2019ve already taken an in-depth look at the latter Laptop 3, so in this review I\u2019m focusing on the 13.5-inch Surface Laptop 3.\n\nThe $999 ($1,599, as tested) 13.5-inch model is the more \u201ctraditional\u201d Laptop 3, and I think it\u2019s the one that most people should get if they are looking at buying one. It has an outstanding keyboard and trackpad; a sharp, bright touchscreen; a sleek design and sturdy build; and excellent performance for everyday productivity tasks, which is what you\u2019re most likely to use a 13-inch laptop for.\n\nThe Laptop 3 isn\u2019t without faults, however, and you can get better battery life and better port selection from other 13-inch Windows laptops, such as Dell\u2019s XPS 13 or HP\u2019s Spectre X360. It also has the occasional bug that will cause things to go haywire until the laptop is shut down and rebooted. Still, if those things aren\u2019t deal-breakers for you, the Laptop 3 is an excellent, traditional Windows 10 laptop.\n\nOur review of Microsoft Surface Laptop 3 13.5\" Verge Score 7.5 out of 10 Good Stuff Outstanding keyboard and trackpad\n\nSleek design and sturdy build quality\n\nGreat everyday performance Bad Stuff Below average battery life\n\nLimited port selection and no Thunderbolt 3 support\n\nSome odd bugs that make for a less-than-perfect experience Buy for $999.00 from Microsoft Buy for $999.00 from Best Buy\n\nAgree to Continue: Microsoft Surface Laptop 3 Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it \u2014 contracts that no one actually reads. It\u2019s impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements. But we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit \u201cagree\u201d to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don\u2019t read and definitely can\u2019t negotiate. As with other Windows 10 computers, the Surface Laptop 3 presents you with multiple things to agree to or decline upon setup. The mandatory policies, for which agreement is required are: Windows 10 License Agreement\n\nA Microsoft account for sign-in (this can be bypassed if you don\u2019t connect the computer to the internet during setup) In addition, there are a slew of optional things to agree to: Activity History\n\nOneDrive back up\n\nOffice 365\n\nCortana (which allows Microsoft to access your location, location history, contacts, voice input, speech and handwriting patterns, typing history, search history, calendar details, messages, apps, and Edge browsing history)\n\nDevice privacy settings: online speech recognition, Find My Device, Inking and Typing, Advertising ID, Location, Diag data, Tailored experiences Add it all up and you have two mandatory agreements and eleven optional ones.\n\nMicrosoft didn\u2019t change much with the Laptop 3\u2019s external design over the prior models \u2014 it\u2019s still an aluminum clamshell laptop with a slightly wedged shape that\u2019s easy to slip into a shoulder bag. The 13.5-inch model weighs 2.89 pounds, which puts it between the MacBook Air\u2019s 2.75 pounds and the MacBook Pro\u2019s three pounds. It\u2019s not the lightest 13-inch laptop you can get, but it certainly isn\u2019t cumbersome.\n\nThere are two notable changes with the design, however. Firstly, the Alcantara cloth deck that has been the signature of the Surface Laptop line is now optional depending on which color you get. It\u2019s present on the silver and blue models, but is replaced with a much more traditional aluminum keyboard deck on the gold and black models.\n\nI\u2019ve been testing the gold version (which Microsoft calls \u201csandstone,\u201d but I\u2019m a human so I call it gold), which looks very nice and doesn\u2019t pick up fingerprints and grease like the black model does. I do miss the Alcantara though \u2014 the aluminum deck is nice, but it just kind of feels like every other aluminum laptop and doesn\u2019t have that soft touch the Alcantara provides. But if you were concerned about the Alcantara\u2019s durability, you now have an option to avoid it. (You\u2019ll have to pay at least $1,299 to get a different color, though, as the $999 base model is only available in silver and comes with the Alcantara fabric.)\n\nThe other change Microsoft made was swapping the ancient Mini DisplayPort for a USB-C port, which is probably what should have been on the first version of the Surface Laptop in 2017. You can use the USB-C port to charge the laptop (in addition to the Surface Connect port on the opposite side), hook up an external display, or use various USB-C accessories like a hub. Unfortunately, it does not support Thunderbolt 3 speeds, so you\u2019re limited to USB-C 3.2 (10Gbps) devices and can\u2019t use it with an external GPU, faster external SSD drives, or a Thunderbolt desktop dock. Most other laptops in this price and size range do support Thunderbolt 3, so it\u2019s frustrating that the Laptop 3 doesn\u2019t.\n\nAside from the new USB-C port, the other I/O on the Laptop 3 is a single USB-A port, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and Microsoft\u2019s proprietary Surface Connector, which connects with 65-watt charger that comes in the box.\n\nMicrosoft has done some work to make this generation easier to service and upgrade than prior Surface Laptop models, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can just crack the Laptop 3 open and get to upgrading. The only part that actually can be swapped is the SSD and Microsoft says it\u2019s not user-replaceable \u2014 you\u2019ll have to take the Laptop 3 to an authorized service center to get the work done.\n\nMicrosoft Surface Laptop 3 13.5-inch specs Display: 13.5-inch, 2256 x 1504 (201 ppi) touchscreen, 3:2 aspect ratio\n\nDimensions: 308 mm x 223 mm x 14.51 mm\n\nWeight: 2.89lbs\n\nProcessor: Intel Core i5 or i7 (10th Gen, Ice Lake)\n\nRAM: Up to 16GB of LPDDR4X, 3733MHz (non-upgradable)\n\nStorage: Up to 1TB M.2 NVME SSD\n\nWireless: Wi-Fi 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6), Bluetooth 5.0 (no LTE option)\n\nPorts: 1 USB-C, 1 USB-A, 3.5mm headphone jack, Surface Connect\n\nPrice: $999 to start ($1,599 as tested)\n\nThe 13.5-inch touchscreen display is unchanged from prior models, and it maintains the signature 3:2 aspect ratio found on all Surface devices. It\u2019s bright and sharp, with good viewing angles and punchy colors, and I really love the taller aspect for working in documents or reading websites. There is some letterboxing when I watch wide-screen videos in full-screen because of it, but for everything else I do on a laptop, this aspect ratio is better than the traditional 16:9 screen.\n\nI also appreciate the fact that it\u2019s a touchscreen, even if this isn\u2019t a 2-in-1 convertible and it\u2019s not the primary way I interact with the laptop. Being able to casually reach up and tap the screen is a convenience I miss when I use laptops that lack touchscreens.\n\nOne thing that has bothered me during my test period is the erratic behavior of the display\u2019s auto brightness function. It will randomly lower the screen\u2019s brightness to uncomfortable levels from time to time before raising it again a couple of minutes later. This happens with the laptop in a stationary position and none of the lighting changing.\n\nLike the 15-inch Laptop 3, the 13.5-inch model has an outstanding keyboard, with excellent spacing, travel, and feedback. It\u2019s perhaps my favorite laptop keyboard I\u2019ve used in a long time. Similarly, the trackpad, which is 20 percent larger than one on the Laptop 2, is smooth and easy to use, with great tracking and palm rejection. This keyboard and trackpad combination is the best you can get in the Windows world and shows Apple how a laptop keyboard should be done.\n\nInside, the 13.5-inch Laptop 3 has Intel\u2019s latest 10th Gen Ice Lake quad-core processors, with either Core i5 or i7 options. I\u2019ve been testing the Core i7 (i7-1065G7, to be specific) model and it has excellent performance for any productivity task you might want to accomplish. It\u2019s also competent enough to handle Lightroom and Photoshop, and doesn\u2019t have any issues playing back 4K video, like I saw with the 15-inch model\u2019s AMD processor. (You can apply these performance results to the Intel version of the 15-inch model that Microsoft is selling to businesses, as it uses the same processor as the 13.5-inch model.)\n\nIn fact, the 13.5-inch model was significantly more capable than the 15-inch version when it came to exporting a 5 minute, 33 second 4K H.264 video out of Adobe Premiere Pro. The 13.5 was able to chew threw that job in just 15 minutes and 26 seconds, compared to the over 3 hours the 15 would have taken. That\u2019s even faster than an older 15-inch MacBook Pro from 2016 that has a dedicated graphics card could manage. I wouldn\u2019t recommend the Laptop 3 as a gaming machine or a hardcore video editing workstation \u2014 this is a thin-and-light computer, after all \u2014 but if you need to get some video editing done on it in a pinch, it\u2019s certainly capable.\n\nBattery life, on the other hand, has been less than stellar. In my daily workload test, which involves setting the screen to 50 percent brightness and juggling between dozens of browser tabs, Slack, email, Word, Twitter, and other productivity apps, I get about seven hours between charges on the Laptop 3. That\u2019s better than the sub-six-hour times I saw on the 15-inch model (iFixit\u2019s teardown says both the 13.5- and 15-inch versions have the same capacity battery), but it\u2019s far from class leading and short of a full work day.\n\nThe Laptop 3 does have a new fast-charging feature, which Microsoft says can bring the laptop to an 80 percent charge from nothing in less than an hour. My tests line up with that \u2014 I was able to go from dead to 39 percent in 30 minutes of charging. But the fast-charging feature only works when the laptop is closed and sleeping \u2014 you won\u2019t get fast charging speeds while you\u2019re using the machine.\n\nFinally, as this is a Surface device, numerous weird bugs have come and gone throughout my testing period. I\u2019ve already mentioned the display auto brightness bug, but I\u2019ve also seen aggressive battery drain, fans ramping to 100 percent while charging, and the trackpad randomly stop scrolling in apps. Most of these bugs go away after fully shutting down the laptop and restarting it, but they are all frustrating things to experience in the first week of using a brand-new laptop. Microsoft typically does update its Surface devices with bug fixes and patches on a regular basis, so hopefully things will have settled down a few months from now, but right now, the Laptop 3\u2019s experience can be hit-or-miss.\n\nAside from those pesky bugs and the merely okay battery life, the Laptop 3 13.5 is a very good laptop, and I think most people looking for a premium Windows 10 computer will be very happy with it. It doesn\u2019t have any of the nagware or bloatware so common on machines from HP, Dell, and Lenovo, and it has simply the best keyboard you can get on a laptop. The Surface Laptop isn\u2019t inexpensive, and you\u2019ll pay for those niceties, but for the most part, it\u2019s worth it.", "description": "Microsoft has two versions of the Laptop 3, and the one that most people should get is the 13.5-inch model.
