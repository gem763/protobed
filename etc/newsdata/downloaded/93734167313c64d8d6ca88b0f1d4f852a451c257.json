And in the South African context, \"serious\" ranges from enormous potholes to being sprayed in the face by window-washers at traffic lights, plus the perils of loadshedding and water restrictions and high petrol prices.\n\nThe Southern African Alcohol Policy Alliance complained that the ads suggested drinking as a way of dealing with the real challenges that people face every day, even though the problems are presented in a very over-the-top fashion.\n\n\"What we object to is them actively playing into the narrative that you can use alcohol to 'drown your sorrows',\" the Alliance said in its complaint.\n\nIn response Tops argued that having a single drink after a trying day is normal.\n\nAnd one drink may indeed be okay to portray, the ARB said \u2013 but ten drinks is too much.\n\n\"Had one seen, for example, one of the characters slowly sipping a cocktail; or a group slowly sipping their drinks in an ordinary social setting; or a montage of individuals slowly sipping their drinks; it would have communicated the idea that one can have one not-so-serious drink in a responsible way,\" the regulator's directorate said in its ruling.\n\nBut the end of the ads show ten different drinks lined up, and then all of them rapidly disappearing.\n\n\"One arm reaches in to take one, and the drinks then all quickly disappear. It is unclear if the same person has drunk them all, quickly, or if a group of people are slowly sipping them. The overall communication is of a fast and excessive (over-the-top) drinking binge in order to cope with the (over- the-top) challenges of life in South Africa,\" the ARB said.\n\nAnd that, it found, \"leaves one with an impression of excessive drinking as a coping mechanism in times of trouble\", which is in breach of rules that say ads may not show excessive drinking, or claim that \"alcohol beverages have curative qualities\".\n\nHere are the two ads Tops at Spar has been ordered to withdraw.\n\n\n\n\n\nReceive a single WhatsApp every morning with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "The Advertising Regulatory Board has ordered the Tops at Spar liquor chain to withdraw television ads because they show too much drinking in response to window-washers at traffic lights and the high price of petrol", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8983/69ec44b2d0654308b3c5087568b8e22b.png", "published_at": "2019-06-11"}
