There is not a lot of messaging or coordination to be had around those simple facts,\u201d White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham Stephanie GrishamHouse Democrats subpoena White House for Ukraine documents Trump approves Poland's entry to visa waiver program Trump: Democrats wasting time on 'bulls---' with impeachment inquiry MORE told The Hill in an emailed statement, pushing back at such arguments.\n\nGrisham said Democrats should be \u201cflat out ashamed of themselves,\u201d accusing the party of pursuing \u201cimpeachment with no crime.\u201d\n\nThe White House has long been marked by factions and in-fighting, and those issues have further complicated efforts to keep up with Trump\u2019s barrage of new statements and Democrats\u2019 fast-moving impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe result has been individual Cabinet officials and aides offering their own defenses of Trump\u2019s conduct and seeking to downplay their own connections to it.\n\nPence, who has largely skirted Trump controversies, made clear on Thursday that he stood by Trump.\n\n\u201cOne of the main reasons we were elected to Washington, D.C. was to drain the swamp,\u201d Pence said in Arizona. \u201cAnd I think the American people have a right to know if the vice president of the United States or his family profited from this position as vice president during the last administration.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNational Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow Lawrence (Larry) Alan KudlowMORE and White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, two of Trump\u2019s most prominent surrogates for discussing the state of China trade talks, were forced Friday morning to address the president\u2019s calls for Beijing to investigate Biden and a subsequent report that Trump had raised Biden in a June call with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nKudlow downplayed the significance of the latest furor, asserting it would not have much of an effect on scheduled trade talks with Chinese officials next week.\n\n\u201cIn some sense I can\u2019t assure you of anything, but I would say my own expectation is that\u2019s not going to be front and center when [U.S. Trade Representative] Lighthizer and [Treasury Secretary] Mnuchin speak with Vice Premiere Liu He,\u201d he told Bloomberg TV.\n\nNavarro was more combative, refusing to tell CNN whether he had raised Biden during his own conversations with Chinese officials and criticizing the network\u2019s reporting.\n\nRudy Giuliani Rudy GiulianiTrump holds call with House GOP amid impeachment inquiry Democrats claim new momentum from intelligence watchdog testimony Overnight Defense: House Dems subpoena White House for Ukraine documents | Pence pulled into inquiry | GOP senator says he confronted Trump over Ukraine aid | Iran hackers target 2020 campaign MORE, the president\u2019s personal attorney who has been at the center of efforts to get dirt on the Bidens, told The Hill in an interview this week that he wouldn\u2019t share his strategy with those inside the White House because they are \u201cuntrustworthy\u201d and tend to leak to the press.\n\nConsequently, much of the messaging has been left to Trump himself, who has on his Twitter feed and in public remarks angrily attacked Democrats over what he views as an effort to bruise him as the 2020 campaign gets underway.\n\n\u201cI question the need for an organized operation when he has the biggest megaphone on planet earth and will be more forceful than anyone else,\u201d one former administration official said of the messaging strategy.\n\nTrump has employed increasingly caustic rhetoric to lash out at Democrats, calling House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff Adam Bennett SchiffSecond intel official considering filing complaint over Trump: report Trump mocks Schiff with Pinocchio-themed video Democrats claim new momentum from intelligence watchdog testimony MORE (D-Calif.) to be investigated for \u201ctreason,\u201d decrying the impeachment inquiry as a \u201ccoup\u201d and quoting a supporter who said his removal could trigger a second \u201ccivil war.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign, meanwhile, has also gone on offense, spending millions on television ads hammering the allegations against Biden and likening the Democratic impeachment inquiry to a \u201ccoup.\u201d CNN said it would not run the ads, asserting they are misleading.\n\nThe administration has sent early signals it is prepared to fight Democrats\u2019 requests and subpoenas. Pence\u2019s office called Democrats\u2019 documents request on Friday unserious, and Pompeo raised a myriad of issues with committees\u2019 demands for testimony from current and former State officials earlier this week.\n\nIan Prior, a former Justice Department official under Trump, surmised the impeachment inquiry would have minimal effect on Trump, arguing his actions didn\u2019t rise to the level of past conduct by presidents who have faced impeachment, including Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton William (Bill) Jefferson ClintonCNN's Van Jones: Democrats in 'lose-lose' situation on impeachment New York prosecutors blast DOJ filing in lawsuit over tax return subpoena Ignore the hype \u2014 this is not an impeachment inquiry MORE, and that the public would lose interest in Democrats\u2019 narrative.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a little more forthcoming in what he says, certainly sometimes to his detriment, but is it an impeachable offense that is going to get him removed from office? Absolutely not,\u201d Prior said.\n\nWhile Trump acknowledged Friday that Democrats appear to have the votes to impeach him, the effort is unlikely to gain traction in the GOP-controlled Senate, where most Republicans have offered varying degrees of defense of Trump\u2019s actions.\n\nTrump continued to insist on Friday that there was \u201cno quid pro quo\u201d involved in his contacts with Ukraine, even as the text messages released late Thursday showed that some in his own administration doubted that.\n\n\u201cWhen I speak to a foreign leader, I speak in an appropriate manner,\u201d Trump told reporters, saying he was only interested in \u201ccorruption\u201d and didn\u2019t care about \u201cpolitics.\u201d\n\nMore than a dozen text message exchanges provided by Kurt Volker Kurt VolkerWhite House struggles to contain Ukraine fallout Gordon Sondland expected to appear for House deposition Democrats claim new momentum from intelligence watchdog testimony MORE, the administration\u2019s former special envoy to Ukraine, highlighted the extent to which multiple diplomatic officials in the Trump administration pushed for Ukraine to take up investigations related to the 2016 election and Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company that Biden\u2019s son Hunter worked for.\n\nIn his opening remarks at a closed session with congressional lawmakers on Thursday, Volker distanced himself from any efforts by Trump to press for investigations into Biden. Instead, Volker appeared to shift blame to Giuliani, accusing him of helping impart on Trump a \u201cdeeply rooted negative view on Ukraine.\u201d", "description": "Trump deepened Democrats\u2019 scrutiny this week by telling reporters that China should consider an investigation into the leading Democratic presidential candidate and his son.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/fallout_trumpdonald_071818getty2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
