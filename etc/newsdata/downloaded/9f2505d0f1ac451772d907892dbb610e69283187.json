I watched the press conference, it was the most embarrassing thing I\u2019ve ever seen, but it\u2019s massive exposure. Listen, he\u2019s nicking a few quid, he\u2019s going out there, why not?\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsked what is in it for Fury, he continued: \u2018Money, what else do you think? It\u2019s just good fun isn\u2019t it, wrestling.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s going to be good for his profile worldwide, and like I say he\u2019s getting a few quid. Have you seen the video when they were hitting each other? I was like [puts head in hands cringing]. Bit of good fun.\u2019\n\nHearn has received criticism for putting on YouTuber KSI\u2019s rematch with Logan Paul, but the Matchroom promoter feels that\u2019s different: \u2018At least that\u2019s a proper fight, it\u2019s not him [Fury] prancing around in his leotard.\n\n\u2018Listen, it\u2019s very simple, great exposure, few quid. I just feel bad that, all the stick I got for Saudi Arabia, I know he\u2019s going to get the same stick about that, going out there, taking part in an event out there.\u2019\n\nHearn seemed to imply that Fury might not receive as much stick for fighting in Saudi Arabia (Getty)\n\nAsked about the decision to wrestle in Riyadh, Fury himself said: \u2018I\u2019m a prize fighter, I\u2019m an entertainer. I\u2019m not a politician, I\u2019m not someone like that, so I just go where I\u2019m supposed to go.\n\n\u2018My team and management they sort all that out and I turn up in a suit looking like the dog\u2019s b*****ks and then that\u2019s it.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement", "description": "Eddie Hearn says Tyson Fury\u2019s WWE press conference was \u2018the most embarrassing thing he has ever seen\u2019 while he \u2018feels bad\u2019 that the Gypsy King will get stick for wrestling...", "authors": ["Metro Sport Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1180505137_1570923666.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
