Besides this, there are a handful of cosy country pubs, a couple of cracking restaurants playing up regional sourcing and foraged ingredients, and some boutiquey guesthouses. So far, so randomly special.\n\n\u201cA gem of a town\u201d for family holidays is how TV presenter Gabby Logan referred to Newport in a recent interview. \u201cIt has a mix of street caf\u00e9s and fancier restaurants. It feels like an undiscovered Cornwall,\u201d she enthused.\n\nWhile the town certainly moves to the same relaxed beat as Cornwall, it receives a mere smidgen of its tourists. And if Newport itself is charming, its backdrop is fiercely beautiful. Here the River Nevern spills into the sea and fields slope to beaches that run long, sandy and dune-backed, perfect for shell-collecting rambles and rockpooling, or for launching a canoe, kayak or sailing boat.\n\nNewport Sands, accessed by wading across the river at low tide, is known for its ripe-peach sunsets that reflect in the estuary waters and backlight the surrounding cliffs and the dark sweep of Dinas Head. On cloudless days, you can see the faint pencil line of Ireland etched in the distance.\n\nThe coastal part of Newport is known as Parrog Credit: getty More\n\nOne step beyond, the Pembrokeshire Coast Path edges softly through kissing-gates and along gorse-clad clifftops to tucked-away smugglers\u2019 coves, hammered by booming surf and frequented by seals and dolphins, choughs and peregrines. A deliciously wild, rocky inlet rimmed by dramatic cliffs, Ceibwr Bay is a seven-mile, three-and-a-half-hour trudge along the coastal path from Newport Sands, or a 15-minute drive north. If you\u2019re lucky you might spot porpoises and otters here. The bay is the starting point for a half-hour walk to Pwll-y-Wrach, or the Witches Cauldron, a collapsed cave whose waters sparkle jade-green when direct sunlight hits them.\n\nHead slightly west instead and you reach some of Pembrokeshire\u2019s most fabulous off-the-radar beaches. Dinas Island is the dream: a ravishing headland of rugged cliffs cloaked in gorse, blackthorn and bramble, grooved with deep, mostly inaccessible coves. With the low rumble of the ocean far below, the two-hour, three-mile circular walk takes in compelling views as well as Needle Rock, a magnet to seabirds including the puffins that summer on these shores.\n\nBut Newport is not only a springboard for some of Britain\u2019s loveliest coastlines. Prehistory prevails in the shape of the ancient hillforts and standing stones that punctuate the heather-brushed moors of the lonely Preseli Hills that pucker the landscape further inland.\n\nNewport is a springboard for some of Britain\u2019s loveliest coastlines Credit: getty More\n\nStory continues", "description": "Even if an A-road runs right through it, Newport feels like a slice of remote Wales redolent of a more genteel era, with its sleepy coastal vibe and high street lined with sagging stone cottages and candy-coloured Georgian townhouses.", "authors": ["Kerry Walker"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/rU9MaRpOjay7QMhzW.Y1mA--~B/aD0xMjI2O3c9MTk2MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/66cd8791adcb8176b01810d3894443ca", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
