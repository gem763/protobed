The slew of health care decisions, from Medicare to supplemental health insurance to long-term care insurance. But the scariest thing of all is figuring out how to avoid falling into the dangerous money pits of retirement.\n\nThere are many.\n\nSome are obvious, and some are total shockers. But each one can put a serious ding in your retirement savings. Which is why Next Avenue reached out to three retirement gurus to offer tips on how to avoid them. Here are 10 big money pits of retirement (in no particular order), with solutions to avoid them:\n\nRetirement Money Pit No. 1: ATM stops\n\nSolution: Limit your ATM stops \u2014 and the amount you withdraw from them. Not only is much of the money you withdraw often unaccounted for, if you\u2019re not using an ATM from your bank\u2019s network, you can be stuck with stiff fees for using it.\n\nThe biggest problem with cash dispensed by an ATM is, \u201cThe money goes and you don\u2019t know where it\u2019s gone,\u201d says John Essigman, CEO of John Essigman Wealth Advisors in Cleveland, Ga.\n\nInstead of stopping at the ATM, Essigman suggests using your debit card for most purchases. That way, you avoid interest charges on credit cards and can keep better track of your spending.\n\nRetirement Money Pit No. 2: Dental costs\n\nSolution: Budget seriously for this. Dental expenses are not covered by Medicare and can come as a shock to retirees. No, not the teeth cleanings or annual checkups or even the cavity fillings, but the extraordinarily high costs of things like root canals, crowns, tooth replacement or gum surgery for retirees no longer are covered by an employer\u2019s dental care policy.\n\nSee: Want to live past 85? Try looking on the bright side\n\nAt some point in retirement, virtually everyone incurs significant dental costs that can exceed $10,000, warns Ed Kohihepp Sr., CEO of Kohlhepp Investment Advisors in Doylestown, Pa. He suggests setting aside at least $2,000 (per person) annually for dental care so the money is there when you need it.\n\nRetirement Money Pit No. 3: Little-used subscriptions\n\nSolution: Drop them once you\u2019ve stopped using them. For one investment adviser, that realization came as he was speaking with this Next Avenue reporter. Scott Reed, the Florence, Ala.-based CEO of the wealth advisory firm Hardy Reed, subscribed to HBO specifically so he and his family could stay culturally connected and watch Game of Thrones. But wait, the final episode aired in May 2019! And the family has since stopped watching HBO \u2014 but hasn\u2019t canceled their subscription.\n\nAlso read: 11 steps to a better retirement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m paying $12 per month for something we don\u2019t even use,\u201d Reed says. He suggests all retirees take a second look for subscriptions that they, too, have stopped using or seldom use \u2014 from magazines to a cable-TV channel.\n\nRetirement Money Pit No. 4: Costly life insurance policies\n\nSolution: If you have kids and they\u2019re out of college, consider dropping this insurance. It\u2019s a good idea to review all your insurance when you start retirement. But a re-evaluation of life insurance is especially smart if you\u2019ve got kids and they no longer depend on your income for support. Then, it may be time to consider dropping or cutting back on your life insurance policy, says Essigman.\n\nRetirement Money Pit No. 5: Eating out\n\nSolution: Make restaurant dining occasional, not daily. Essigman has some clients who eat out every day. Some can afford it; some can\u2019t. If that one meal for two costs roughly $50 a day, the expenses over a year add up to an astounding $18,000. If you and your retired spouse or partner also stop at Starbucks SBUX, +0.22% for two grande cappuccinos every day (at about $12 a day), that\u2019s another $4,400 \u2014 which bloats the annual eating out budget to more than $22,000. \u201cThat would sure buy a lot of groceries,\u201d says Essigman.\n\nRetirement Money Pit No. 6: Gifts to your grown kids\n\nSolution: Get your financial adviser\u2019s OK first. Sure, if you have an adult child, it\u2019s fine to sometimes give him or her a $100 gift \u2014 or even a $1,000 gift, if you can afford it and the occasion merits it. But don\u2019t make gifts of $5,000 or more to any of your children (or grandchildren) without running the idea by your financial adviser, suggests Kohlhepp. When you\u2019re retired and not receiving full-time employment income, you might not be able to be so generous.\n\nRead: Is it OK to give more financial help to one grown child than another?\n\n\u201cThis is something that can be very difficult to turn off once you retire,\u201d Kohlhepp says.\n\nRetirement Money Pit No. 7: A credit card balance\n\nSolution: Pay your credit cards in full every month. Before you retired, the first \u201cbill\u201d you were supposed to pay every month was the money you put into your 401(k) or IRA. Now, the first bill you pay every month is your credit card bill \u2014 which you should try to pay in full with zero balance, says Reed. Retirees, he says, can\u2019t afford the high interest rates of credit cards when every dollar they spend counts.\n\nRetirement Money Pit No. 8: Failing to stick to a budget\n\nSolution: Create a budget that\u2019s set in stone. Most people don\u2019t create a monthly budget before they retire, which makes it even more difficult for them to create one after they retire. But since your income will almost surely decline once you retire, establishing and sticking with a reasonable budget becomes even more essential, says Essigman.\n\nRetirement Money Pit No. 9: Home remodeling\n\nSolution: Remodel strategically. Home remodeling, particularly in retirement, can be a never-ending money pit. Many people who are retired keep adding on to their homes to make them more suitable and more luxurious, says Essigman. \u201cA retired couple can live just fine in 1,000 square feet,\u201d he says.\n\nRetirement Money Pit No. 10: Health care costs\n\nSolution: Hire a Medicare adviser. \u201cIt\u2019s surprising how many retirees don\u2019t understand Medicare at all, nor do they understand Medicare supplemental policies,\u201d says Kohlhepp. He suggests hiring a Medicare adviser, particularly to help with choosing Medicare Part D drug plans, which can change annually.", "description": "Each one of these expenses can add up and put a serious ding in your retirement savings.", "authors": ["Bruce Horovitz"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ321_na_exp_ZG_20190828142751.jpg"}
