The lengthy CNN segment, in fact, basically came across like a microcosm of Tuesday\u2019s hearing\u2014lots of deflection, insults, contradiction, and condescension.\n\nFor instance, Camerota began the interview by asking Lewandowski about his tactic of stonewalling or just straight-up refusing to answer questions from House Democrats during his testimony, prompting the possible Senate hopeful of doing the same exact thing to her.\n\n\u201cYou just mischaracterized saying I didn\u2019t answer the majority of questions,\u201d Lewandowski complained at one point. \u201cYou and I both know that\u2019s not an accurate statement. You and I both know I answered the majority of their questions.\u201d\n\nThis prompted a mini-argument between the two over whether or not Lewandowski invoking executive privilege during the hearing was the same as refusing to answer a question. This was merely the beginning of the insufferability.\n\nLater on, Lewandowski\u2014a one-time CNN political commentator\u2014used a Trumpian line to mischaracterize the findings of the Mueller Report, claiming the report was \u201cvery clear\u201d that there \u201cwas no collusion, there was no obstruction.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what the Mueller Report said, Corey!\u201d Camerota shouted back, adding: \u201cDid you read the Mueller Report?\u201d\n\nLewandowski admitted he \u201cnever did,\u201d prompting Camerota to ask how he even knows what is in the report. The Trump operative, however, decided to flip it back to the CNN anchor, asking her whether she read the 400-plus page report.\n\n\u201cThere were 10 different examples of obstruction in there,\u201d she accurately said, causing Lewandowski to claim his former colleague was lying and being \u201cdisingenuous.\u201d\n\nShe went on to air a graphic that showed the 10 different instances of Trump\u2019s attempted obstruction of the Russian investigation laid out in the report, including Lewandowski\u2019s own attempts to get then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to reverse his recusal and stymie the probe.\n\n\u201cAll of the examples that any regular citizen would have been charged and convicted of if they were not a sitting U.S. president,\u201d Camerota noted. \u201cYou know that part, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that to be true,\u201d Lewandowski dismissively replied.\n\nCamerota, eventually, swung it back around to Lewandowski\u2019s confession that he lies to the press, asking him if he only feels an obligation to tell the truth under oath. Lewandowski\u2019s answer was to invoke former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe, who is now a CNN contributor.\n\n\u201cYou and your network continue to use him as a contributor who has been lying under oath,\u201d he sneered. \u201cSo if you\u2019re going to hold me to a standard, hold your same employees and contributors to that same standard.\u201d\n\nNaturally, the conversation went nowhere. As Lewandowski kept trying to make it about McCabe, Camerota attempted to get him to admit that he lies to the media, prompting his to ask: \u201cAre you a journalist, or are you a talking head?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re listening with your mouth,\u201d Camerota snapped back.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGot a tip?
