The rage and the rabid ripostes are just to get attention to what Mr. Giuliani wants you all to take in.\u201d\n\nCuomo explained Giuliani\u2019s tactics of pre-empting a story before it breaks to soften the blow, moving the goalposts to give cover to Trump and then arguing the alternative.\n\n\u201cNow, while I argue that Giuliani\u2019s play is obvious, that does not make it ineffective,\u201d said Cuomo. \u201cHe got a ton of attention with his outbursts but his Biden bombs went out too, and while he was tested here and was exposed for being tricky with the truth, many outlets are just repeating his side, helps his cause.\u201d\n\nCheck out the segment here:\n\nGiuliani is a man with a plan: provide cover for Trump pic.twitter.com/yxJVa8qGy1 \u2014 Christopher C.
