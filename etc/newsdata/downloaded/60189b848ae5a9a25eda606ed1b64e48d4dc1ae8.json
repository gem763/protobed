He promised rally attendees, who booed loudly at the mention of the state\u2019s Somali residents, that he would \u201cgive local communities a greater say in refugee policy and put in place enhanced vetting and responsible immigration controls.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs you know for many years leaders in Washington brought large numbers of refugees to your state from Somalia without considering the impact on schools and communities and taxpayers,\u201d he said as some in the crowd jeered, adding, \u201cYou should be able to decide what is best for your own cities and for your own neighborhoods and that\u2019s what you have the right to do right now, and believe me, no other president would be doing that.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s comments, the latest escalation of his ongoing feud with Omar and Somali refugees, drew fierce rebukes Thursday night from Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), a Democratic presidential nominee, and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey (D). Omar also hit back at Trump over his criticisms of her.\n\n\u201cHis hate is no match for our movement,\u201d Omar tweeted, encouraging her followers to donate to her campaign.\n\nAt his rally just now, Trump called me an \u201cAmerica-hating socialist\u201d and a \u201cdisgrace.\u201d He shouted xenophobic conspiracy theories about me. He scolded my district for voting for me.\n\n\n\nHis hate is no match for our movement.

Immigrants and refugees have helped make our state a wonderful place to live and work \u2014 which is far more than this President has done. Stop using immigrants and refugees as political pawns! \u2014 Amy Klobuchar (@amyklobuchar) October 11, 2019\n\nMeanwhile, Frey had a pointed response to Trump telling the rally crowd to \u201cspeak to your mayor\u201d about the president\u2019s recently issued executive order that could keep refugees from being \u201cresettled in any city or any state without the express written consent of that city or that state.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cConsent given,\u201d Frey tweeted. \u201cImmigrants and refugees are welcome in Minneapolis.\u201d\n\nMinnesota has the largest concentration of Somalis in America, with more than 52,000 people in the state reporting Somali ancestry, the Star Tribune reported in July, citing 2017 data from the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nSomalis coming directly from Africa, described as \u201cprimary refugees,\u201d started being allowed into the state in 1993, according to the Minnesota Department of Health. Since then, Minnesota has welcomed almost 24,000 primary refugees, in addition to those who may have originally been relocated elsewhere in the U.S. and later moved to the Midwestern state because they were drawn there by word of mouth.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhen the people in the refugee camps heard about the early arrivals that came here and were well received, they reported back to their relatives,\u201d Abdisalam Adam, a Somali American, told the Minnesota Historical Society in 2004.\n\nAD\n\nAhmed Samatar, who came to the U.S. from Somalia in 1974 to attend the University of Wisconsin, told WCCO that Minnesota is particularly enticing to refugees because of its strong economy and reputation as \u201ca kind and progressive place.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is the nature of the welcome itself and how hospitable that is,\u201d said Samatar, now a professor of international studies at Macalester College.\n\nTrump, however, has not viewed the Somali refugees with the same kindness.\n\nTwo days before the 2016 presidential election, then-candidate Trump told the crowd at a campaign rally in Minneapolis they had \u201csuffered enough\u201d as a result of \u201cfilthy refugee vetting\u201d that had allowed an influx of Somalis into their state. He promised that if he became president, refugees would not be admitted \u201cwithout the support of the community where they are being placed.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, Trump also reportedly \u201craged\u201d at former acting homeland security secretary Elaine Duke \u201casking why he could not ban refugees from \u2018f------ Somalia,\u2019\u201d New York Times reporters Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Michael D. Shear wrote in their new book, \u201cBorder Wars: Inside Trump\u2019s Assault on Immigration.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDavis and Shear noted that Trump and his senior policy adviser, Stephen Miller, \u201cseemed to have a particular dislike for Somalia, often citing it or its nationals when they spoke of the potential dangers of refugees and other immigrants.\u201d\n\nIn September, the Trump administration issued an executive order giving state and local governments more freedom to reject refugees. The action came the same day the federal government announced that it had again cut its refugee program and will only allow 18,000 applicants next year, a historic low. Trump has also made efforts to ban travel to the United States from several countries, including Somalia and other Muslim-majority nations.\n\nOn Thursday, ahead of the president\u2019s most recent visit to Minneapolis, a number of Somali residents were on edge, the Tribune reported. Community leaders told the newspaper that they were working with the FBI and had armed security guards monitoring Somali-owned businesses. Citizens, namely Muslim women with hijabs, were also advised to be watchful.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhen it\u2019s happening in your own town and city it is more close to home than when it\u2019s somewhere far,\u201d Minnesota state Rep. Mohamud Noor (D), whose district includes Minneapolis, told the Star Tribune. \u201cSo we are trying to temper the fear that exists in the community.\u201d\n\nDuring the rally, Trump\u2019s anger with Omar was apparent as he scolded the crowd for electing her. Earlier this year, Omar and three other minority Democratic congresswomen were targeted by Trump in a racist tweet that went on to inspire a rally chant of \u201cSend her back!\u201d directed at the first Somali-American congresswoman.\n\n\u201cI know the people of Minnesota,\u201d Trump said Thursday. \u201cHow the hell did that ever happen? How did it happen?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe president proceeded to highlight Omar\u2019s recent controversies, again ripping her over her comments about Israel and the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHow do you have such a person representing you in Minnesota?\u201d Trump said. \u201cI\u2019m very angry at you people right now.\u201d\n\nAbout 20 minutes later, Trump turned his attention to Minnesota\u2019s Somali community. He touted his administration\u2019s efforts to reduce refugee resettlement and warned that having Democrats in power would lead to \u201cunvetted, uncontrolled migration at levels you have never seen before.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the Trump administration, we will always protect American families first and that has not been done in Minnesota,\u201d the president said. He added, \u201cWe will not make the mistakes made in European countries and allow a violent ideology to take root in our country on our shores, we\u2019re not going to allow it to happen.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s remarks drew cheers from rally attendees, but critics on social media were outraged.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cCan you imagine being Somali-American and watching this?\u201d one person tweeted. \u201cThis is the kind of hate rally seen in authoritarian and fascist countries.\u201d\n\nAnother wrote that the president\u2019s comments \u201cwere stunning in ugliness & tone.\u201d\n\nCan you imagine being Somali-American and watching this? This is the kind of hate rally seen in authoritarian and fascist countries.\n\n\n\nWe Jews have seen this before, as have countless other minorities. This is the powerful hurting the vulnerable to empower themselves. https://t.co/o3Oy1S2KPj \u2014 Elad Nehorai (@PopChassid) October 11, 2019\n\nThe modern day Hitler\n\nAs Trump rallies against Somali refugees in Minnesota and insists on throwing them out\n\n\n\nThe red shirts, red caps\n\nAre the new Brown Shirts\n\nTruly Terrifying #TrumpMinneapolis #Trump pic.twitter.com/TLma8nsAQU \u2014 Mara McEwin (@maramcewin) October 11, 2019\n\nThe special hate that Trump and the alt-right have for Somalis, above and beyond all other immigrant groups, has always fascinated and disgusted me. https://t.co/G3NdOawfOb \u2014 Noah Smith \ud83d\udc07 (@Noahpinion) October 11, 2019\n\nWhile Omar has yet to specifically address the president\u2019s comments on Somali refugees, she retweeted a former Minnesota state representative who pointed out that Trump supporters have been responsible for making death threats against her and for mailing bombs to Democrats.\n\nSomalis in Minnesota, however, had a more direct response to Trump: They plan to get him back at the polls, the Sahan Journal, which covers immigration and refugees in the state, reported.\n\n\u201cThe only thing I know for certain is that I will not vote for Trump,\u201d Ibrahim Dahiye told the Journal. \u201cI know he hates us.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "\u201cCan you imagine being Somali-American and watching this?\" one person tweeted Thursday. \"This is the kind of hate rally seen in authoritarian and fascist countries.\u201d", "authors": ["Allyson Chiu", "Reporter With The Morning Mix Team"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/iVh866fa3F9SWNZqAbcRjRrVN_8=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/10-11-2019/t_f34f78b9397544fa95c6a9b4bbcf8137_name_Screen_Shot_2019_10_10_at_11_55_58_PM.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
