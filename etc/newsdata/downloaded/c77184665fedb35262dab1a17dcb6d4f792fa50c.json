We\u2019ll find for The Division 2 this month, as the game\u2019s second expansion, touted by Ubisoft as its \u201cbiggest,\u201d starts rolling out this week.\n\nPromised for this addition to Ubisoft\u2019s shooter about taking back a besieged Washington DC are two big new missions, one set in the Pentagon and one in DARPA labs, both expected to extend the game\u2019s story. The two missions added via July\u2019s expansion were superb, as the look and flow of missions in this game have been a strong point.\n\nHere\u2019s an official description of each:\n\nFirst Main Mission - Pentagon: Agents will discover the location of the perfusion bioreactor inside the Pentagon\u2019s underground research facility. The Black Tusk have already infiltrated the lab and are attempting to extract the reactor. Second Main Mission - DARPA Research Labs: Players must make their way through the Pentagon and into the DARPA Labs, as the Black Tusk are in the process of transporting the perfusion bioreactor through an abandoned Cold War tunnel network.\n\nThe missions will be accessible once players take control of a new safe house being added to the game. Cool, but the game\u2019s map is not being expanded. Rather, these new missions, as with the July ones, will be levels that players load up via an in-game helicopter. There is no expansion to the game\u2019s open world this time.\n\nA Secret Boss Was Hidden In The Division 2 For Months, Until The Developers Teased It Game developer Trick Dempsey recently started Googling to see if anyone had found a secret boss encounter in The Division 2, the giant Ubisoft game he helps make. \u201cI was just like: I don\u2019t a video guide for finding this dude,\u201d he said on today\u2019s State of the Game developer stream. \u201cThere\u2019s just nothing.\u201d Read more\n\nIn addition to those missions, Ubisoft is adding a new specialisation character class called the Technician, which will let them use a \u201cmulti-missile launcher,\u201d according to the press release: \u201cAgents can lock-on and hit up to six enemies (depending on available ammo). With a simple push of a button, six missiles are unleashed to seek out their targets.\u201d\n\nAnd there will be a new team elimination PvP mode and a new map.\n\nAll of this will go live on October 15 for people who bought the game\u2019s Year 1 pass and will go live on October 22 for those who did not.\n\nYear 1 pass people get two more Classified Assignments, which have been medium-sized missions set in interesting locations and woven together with short audio-log-based stories. Previous Classified Assignments included missions set in a bank and an aquarium. The new ones will be set in a marina and in the Mexican Embassy. These Classified Assignments don\u2019t get released to all players, at least not in the game\u2019s first year.\n\nA new raid initially slated for this episode has been delayed. According to the release: \u201cThe additional time allows the development team to focus on the overall quality of The Division 2, while developing a raid that will better meet the standards of its players.\u201d\n\nThis amount of stuff actually measures up pretty closely to the game\u2019s first sprinkling of additional content that followed its March release. Across the first few months, Ubisoft released a new specialisation, a raid, three main missions, four classified assignments and a special three-zone challenge mode called the Expedition.\n\nThere actually is nothing like the Expeditions mode slated for this new episode, certainly not the addition of a much-requested return of things like the repeatable randomly generated Underground mode or Survival mode, which were added in the first nine months after the release of the first Division. The series\u2019 creative director, Julian Gerighty, said as recently as last week that he wants to bring Survival mode back at some point. But, then again, Division 1 never had any expansions to its story, which the new game keeps getting.\n\nPotentially most impactful of all, though, is all that is coming to The Division 2 on the 15th for all players outside of the Episodic update. There\u2019s an overall game overhaul in terms of loot and balance, which has been detailed in recent State of the Game livestreams and was broken down in today\u2019s press release:\n\nTargeted Loot\n\nNamed Items overhauled\n\nCrafting Changes\n\nRecalibration Changes\n\nFilled Brands\n\nInventory Management 2.0\n\nIncreased stash space\n\nRebalance of talents and weapons\n\nDark Zone Server Transfers\n\nUpdated Thieves\u2019 Den Vendor\n\nDark Zone Supply Drops Changes\n\nOccupied Dark Zone Ambushes\n\nNormalization in Dark Zone changes\n\nConflict: Loadout Selection during map voting\n\nBonus armour visualisation increased\n\nConflict: End of Match Rewards changes\n\nStored tutorials\n\nThose changes are meant to make the general flow of the game more exciting and interesting. Will it work? Are the developers adding the right stuff? We\u2019ll find out as we play it all starting next week.", "description": "What is enough for a free expansion?
