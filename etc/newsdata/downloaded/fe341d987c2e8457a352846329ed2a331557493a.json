This appalling situation cannot be allowed to continue.\u201d\n\nThe Howard League is among campaign groups calling for Feltham to be shut down, arguing that the \u201cterrible conditions\u201d inside put young inmates at risk and worsen any chance of rehabilitation.\n\n\u201cFeltham A fails these children, and society as a whole, and therefore should be closed,\u201d Mr Neilson said.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

In the four weeks leading up to the inspection some 800 hours had been scheduled to be delivered on residential wings, but only around 250 hours had actually materialised.\u201d\n\nHe said stretched staff had been focused on \u201ccontaining the behavioural problems of the boys\u201d rather than addressing root causes and rehabilitating them.\n\n\u201cNeither boys nor staff were safe,\u201d Mr Clarke added. \u201cThe negative cycle of containment and separation that we have commented on in the past still dominated the day-to-day lives of those who lived and worked in the establishment.\u201d\n\nKenny Imafidon, who was held in Feltham for six months on remand before being acquitted of murder, said the findings were not a surprise and that it was a \u201cbad decision\u201d to lift the ban on new inmates.\n\nHe told The Independent that keeping boys in their cells increased tensions and the fact Feltham is a \u201cvery tough place for staff\u201d worsened relationships and turnover.\n\n\u201cYou bring in a lot of people with different issues into the same place and there isn\u2019t enough resources to support them,\u201d he said. \u201cThat has been in the case for years.\u201d\n\nThe youth mentor, who founded the My Brother\u2019s Keeper programme, said the low take-up of educational opportunities was \u201cappalling\u201d and called for a culture change by both inmates and staff.\n\nThe Prison Officers\u2019 Association (POA) said long-standing problems at Feltham had been exacerbated by years of government funding cuts and the loss of experienced staff.\n\nNational Executive Committee representative Dave Cook said staff had been working with Feltham\u2019s new governor, Emily Martin, to \u201cbring stability and safety back into the establishment\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe welcome the HMIP report and urge the government to correctly resource Feltham so that it cannot only be a safe establishment, but be at the forefront of rehabilitation for young prisoners,\u201d he added.\n\nThe watchdog said its inspection of Feltham\u2019s B unit, which holds male prisoners aged between 18 and 20, showed a \u201csignificant\u201d improvement to safety, rehabilitation and planning for release.\n\nThe Youth Custody Service said \u201cimmediate changes\u201d were made to Feltham\u2019s A unit following the urgent notification to strengthen staffing and tackle violence.\n\nExecutive director Helga Swidenbank said: \u201cYoung people at Feltham A can now access a full regime and there has been a sustained reduction in levels of self-harm, the use of force and the number of assaults on staff. Young offenders also have far better access to showers, more time out of their rooms and are more likely to attend their education classes.\n\n\u201cThe full range of improvements will need time to take effect, but progress is being made \u2013 a credit to the governor and her staff who care deeply about the safety of those in their custody.\u201d", "description": "More children are to be sent into a notorious youth prison just months after an inspection found \u201cappalling\u201d conditions were making it unsafe.
