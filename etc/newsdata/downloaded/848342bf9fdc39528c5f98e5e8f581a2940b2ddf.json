Make It Rain Money on Trump.", "language": "en", "text": "President Trump on Thursday held his first rally since Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that the House would launch an impeachment inquiry. The scene outside was raucous, and included a Trump supporter getting spit on during an interview with VICE News.\n\nThe scene inside was just as strange, as Trump went off script for pretty much the whole speech. All hour and forty minutes of it\n\nThough he might have sounded more than a little concerned about the prospect of impeachment, there is one way that the impeachment inquiry is not hurting him right now: fundraising. Campaign manager Brad Parscale told the Associated Press that in the 24 hours after the impeachment inquiry was announced, the campaign and the RNC raised $5 million online.\n\nVICE News talked to a number of the president\u2019s supporters outside the Target Center in downtown Minneapolis. Many of them were consistent donors to his re-election, and said that the impeachment inquiry has only motivated them to give more.\n\nJohn Hakala lives in the northern part of the state where he works for U.S. Steel. He gives a few hundred dollars at a time to the president\u2019s campaign.\n\n\u201cIt motivated me huge to give him more money,\u201d he said. \u201cThis country's in a bad place right now, between the fighting and the controversy and everything else. We need to come together as a whole, and I think eventually he's going to make that happen.\u201d\n\nSarah Zuk, who lives in nearby Plymouth, Minnesota, said that those annoying campaign fundraising emails actually work for her.\n\n\u201cI donate every year when I register to vote and I also donate just online when I get email reminders throughout the year,\u201d she said. That most recent fundraising email came the night before the rally, so she chipped in $50. But she said also gives around $25 to the campaign several times a year.\n\nDespite the money piling up, the cracks are starting to show. A recent FOX poll shows 51 percent of Americans support impeachment and removal from office. But President Trump is banking on this to motivate his base, telling his supporters, \u201cThe Democrats\u2019 attempt to overthrow the government will create backlash at the ballot box the likes of we have never seen before in the history of this country.\u201d", "description": "His campaign is raking in millions.
