You\u2019re fighting against the air. So we\u2019re doing the best we can.\u201d\n\nA group of Republican lawmakers stormed the closed-door depositions at the Capitol on Wednesday, delaying testimony for several hours. President Trump, who has complained that he\u2019s not allowed to confront the witnesses and a whistleblower against him, reportedly encouraged the move.\n\n\u201cThey got surprised yesterday when we fought back, and we\u2019re going to continue to fight back.\u201d Rep. Bradley Byrne, Alabama Republican, told Fox News. \u201cThis is a sham.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, defended his digging in Ukraine for evidence of interference in the 2016 election. Two of his clients who were born in Ukraine have been indicted on campaign-finance charges in the U.S., and Mr. Giuliani reportedly is seeking a criminal defense lawyer for himself.\n\n\u201cWith all the Fake News let me make it clear that everything I did was to discover evidence to defend my client against false charges,\u201d Mr. Giuliani tweeted late Wednesday, referring to Mr. Trump. \u201cDems would be horrified by the attacks on me, if my client was a terrorist. But they don\u2019t believe\n\n@realDonaldTrump has rights. Justice will prevail.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
