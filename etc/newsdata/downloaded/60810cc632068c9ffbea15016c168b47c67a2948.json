These are people who may have been willing to concede that Trump was a bad guy, but otherwise maintained, in the teeth of the evidence, that our two major parties were basically equivalent: Each party had its extremists, but each also had its moderates, and everything would be fine if these moderates could work together.\n\nWho am I talking about? Well, among other people, Joe Biden, who has repeatedly insisted that Trump is an aberration, not representative of the Republican Party as a whole. (Biden\u2019s refusal to admit what he was facing may be one reason his response to the Ukraine smear has seemed so wobbly.)\n\nSome of us have been pushing back against that worldview for many years, arguing that today\u2019s Republican Party is a radical force increasingly opposed to democracy. Way back in 2003 I wrote that modern conservatism is \u201ca movement whose leaders do not accept the legitimacy of our current political system.\u201d In 2012 Thomas Mann and Norman Ornstein declared that the central problem of U.S. politics was a G.O.P. that was not just extreme but \u201cdismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition.\u201d\n\nFor a long time, however, making that case \u2014 pointing out that Republicans were sounding ever more authoritarian and violating more and more democratic norms \u2014 got you dismissed as shrill if not deranged. Even Trump\u2019s rise, and the obvious parallels between Trumpism and the authoritarian movements that have gutted democracy in places like Hungary and Poland, barely dented centrist complacency. Remember, just a few months ago most of the news media treated Attorney General William Barr\u2019s highly misleading summary of the Mueller report as credible.\n\nBut my sense, although it\u2019s impossible to quantify, is that the events of the past several weeks have finally broken through the wall of centrist denial.", "description": "Will they finally admit what the G.O.P. has become?", "authors": ["Paul Krugman"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/07/opinion/07krugmanWeb/07krugmanWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
