rare street pressure", "language": "en", "text": "Beirut (AFP) \u2013 When mass anti-government protests engulfed Lebanon, a taboo was broken as strongholds of the Shiite Hezbollah movement saw rare demonstrations criticising the party and revered leader Hasan Nasrallah.\n\nOn live TV and in protest sites, citizens accused the party of providing political cover for a corrupt government that they say has robbed people of their livelihoods.\n\nThis shattered the myth of absolute acquiesence among Hezbollah\u2019s popular base, baffling even those who hail from the movement\u2019s strongholds.\n\n\u201cNo one ever expected that in any of these areas in south Lebanon we would hear a single word against Nasrallah,\u201d or Amal Movement leader Nabih Berri, said Sara, a 32-year-old activist who participated in protests in the southern city of Nabatiyeh.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d the activist added, asking to use a pseudonym due to security concerns.\n\nThe popular Iran-backed movement is a major political player that took 13 seats in the country\u2019s May 2018 parliamentary elections and secured three cabinet posts.\n\nIt helped its Christian ally Michel Aoun assume the presidency in 2016 and has since backed his government despite popular dissatisfaction that peaked last week following protests over taxes, corruption and dire economic conditions.\n\nSouth Lebanon \u2014 a bastion of the powerful Shiite movement since the group liberated the region from Israeli occupation in 2000 \u2014 was not spared.\n\nProtests have been reported in the cities of Nabatiyeh, Bint Jbeil, and Tyre, where Hezbollah and its political affiliate the Amal Movement hold sway.\n\nWith the exception of Tyre, they were not as big as other parts of the country.\n\nBut \u201cthe novelty here is that some of these protesters are party loyalists,\u201d said Sara.\n\n\u201cThey support Hezbollah, but they are suffocating.\u201d\n\nAmong his supporters, Nasrallah is revered as an icon, with his pictures inundating highways, shops and homes.\n\nIn the past, his followers have mobilised against anyone who tried to criticise him, often ostracising opponents as supporters of rival Israel.\n\n\u2013 \u2018The resistance\u2019 \u2013\n\nBut anti-government protests that started in Beirut on October 17 and quickly spread across the country left no politician unscathed, not even the Hezbollah leader.\n\n\u201cAll of them means all of them, Nasrallah is one of them,\u201d protesters chanted in Beirut.\n\nCriticism of Nasrallah even aired on the Hezbollah-run Al-Manar TV, in a scene that was previously unfathomable for watchers of the movement\u2019s propaganda arm.\n\nIn a live interview from central Beirut, one protester urged Nasrallah to \u201clook after his people in Lebanon\u201d instead of focusing on regional enterprises like Syria, where he has deployed fighters to defend President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime.\n\nNasrallah acknowledged the mounting criticism against him in a speech on Saturday: \u201cCurse me, I don\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the protesters demands, he warned against calling for the resignation of the government \u2014 saying it could take a long time to form a new one and solve the crisis.\n\nHatem Gharbeel, a protester in Nabatiyeh, said Hezbollah loyalists felt let down.\n\n\u201cThe messages being addressed to Nasrallah by his own supporters in Nabatiyeh is that the resistance is not just about fighting Israel or terrorism,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt should also be about supporting people\u2019s livelihoods.\u201d\n\nOther party heads have come in for even greater criticism.\n\nPrime Minister Saad Hariri, Foreign Minster Gebran Bassil and Speaker Nabih Berri have been the targets of strong insults and slurs by demonstrators, even in areas where they are popular.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Nothing to lose\u2019 \u2013\n\nBut the relatively toned-down criticism of Nasrallah has broken taboos, said Gharbeel.\n\n\u201cThe barrier of fear has been broken, \u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt shows that people are not blindly following their political or sectarian leaders anymore.\u201d\n\nLokman Slim, an independent political activist and an outspoken critic of Hezbollah, said that resentment among Lebanon\u2019s Shiite community \u201cis not born out of a single event or a single moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrustration has been fermenting over the past few years over an economic crisis hampering not just the Lebanese state but also Hezbollah\u2019s statelet.\u201d\n\nHezbollah has filled in for the weak central government in areas where it has influence, creating social welfare institutions and provided an array of public services, including education and health services.\n\nBut the group has come under financial strain due to tightening US sanctions since President Donald Trump assumed office, forcing Nasrallah to appeal to his popular base for donations earlier this year.\n\n\u201cThe Shiites have nothing to lose anymore,\u201d said Slim.\n\n\u201cThis is why they are out on the streets.\u201d", "description": "Beirut (AFP) \u2013
