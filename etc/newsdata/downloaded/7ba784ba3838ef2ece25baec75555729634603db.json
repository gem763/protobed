Facial recognition software works by matching real time images to a previous photograph of a person. Each face has approximately 80 unique nodal points across the eyes, nose, cheeks and mouth which distinguish one person from another. A digital video camera measures the distance between various points on the human face, such as the width of the nose, depth of the eye sockets, distance between the eyes and shape of the jawline. A different smart surveillance system (pictured) can scan 2 billion faces within seconds has been revealed in China. The system connects to millions of CCTV cameras and uses artificial intelligence to pick out targets. The military is working on applying a similar version of this with AI to track people across the country This produces a unique numerical code that can then be linked with a matching code gleaned from a previous photograph. A facial recognition system used by officials in China connects to millions of CCTV cameras and uses artificial intelligence to pick out targets. Experts believe that facial recognition technology will soon overtake fingerprint technology as the most effective way to identify people.\n\nIn China, facial recognition software has become a part of daily life.\n\nChinese citizens must now submit to having their faces scanned by the government before having internet installed in their homes.\n\nThe Chinese program is part of an initiative that aims to connect to 626 million CCTV cameras around the country by 2020.", "description": "Google hired temps to collect facial recognition data from black people to improve security measures for upcoming Pixel 4 smartphone, told people it was for game and gave them $5 giftcards", "authors": ["Michael Thomsen For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/03/18/19263226-0-image-a-18_1570123206708.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
