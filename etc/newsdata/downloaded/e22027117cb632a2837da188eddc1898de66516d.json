Already, federal agencies warn that the government\u2019s flood maps most likely understate the risks of deluges in much of the country, including the Southeast, where at least 42 storage sites in POLITICO\u2019s analysis are located.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration is moving to weaken an Obama-era regulation meant to prevent a repeat of past coal ash disasters.\n\nThe ash, left behind when coal is burned for power generation, contains arsenic, selenium, lead, mercury, boron and other contaminants known to cause cancer, neurological damage or heart ailments. Electric utilities usually store it in massive landfills or unlined ponds that are at a risk of spilling when nearby lakes and rivers flood \u2014 as happened in a $1.2 billion disaster that damaged dozens of homes in Tennessee in 2008, as well as two breaches that fouled a river and lake in North Carolina last year after Hurricane Florence.\n\nIn addition to the increased risk of spills, scientists say the heavier rains expected to come from a warming planet also threaten to bring a more hidden peril \u2014 rising water tables that seep into the ash impoundments, contaminating groundwater used for agriculture and drinking.\n\nThe dangers make it urgent for power companies to move faster to remove the coal ash deposits from harm's way, pollution experts say.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t clean them up, they\u2019re going to be there forever,\u201d said Peter Goode, a former chief engineer for the Missouri Department of Natural Resources water pollution control program. \u201cThirty years from now, who knows what the flooding events are going to look like and what the rainfall events are going to look like?\u201d\n\nAdding climate change to the mix presents \u201ca major issue,\u201d said Ellen Cowan, a scientist at Appalachian State University who has studied coal ash spills across the country.\n\n\u201cThat should be part of the equation: whether or not it\u2019s safe to leave them here or whether that ash should be moved and landfilled somewhere far from bodies of water,\u201d Cowan said.\n\nThe utility industry said it takes coal ash cleanup seriously and that the federal rule is strong. But companies have argued against a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach. Capping ash where it already exists \"can be equally protective\" as removing it from floodplains, said Jim Roewer, executive director of the Utility Solid Waste Activities Group, a coalition of electric utilities.\n\n\"The question of how to close really is a site-specific decision and you need to take a look at the site characteristics, where the groundwater is, where surface waters are,\" he said.\n\n'We feel like we\u2019re under assault'\n\nTo identify the potential scope of the problem, POLITICO examined company filings, EPA documents and other publicly available information on more than 370 power plants to find the precise location of their ash ponds and landfills.\n\nPOLITICO then used FEMA's online flood map viewer to identify which sites lie within what FEMA calls a Special Flood Hazard Area. It found that at least 101 coal ash sites sit on terrain where the agency estimates at least a 1 percent chance of flooding in any given year \u2014 what is frequently known as a 100-year storm.\n\nThe examination comes with significant caveats: Flood-risk information wasn\u2019t available for every site, and consistent documentation didn\u2019t exist for many long-dormant coal ash sites, so POLITICO eliminated dozens of locations from its results. The results also don\u2019t account for some utilities\u2019 ongoing efforts to remove their coal ash. And some FEMA maps POLITICO reviewed were last updated in the 1970s.\n\nA full analysis of any particular site\u2019s flood risk would have to look at a range of factors, such as a pond's elevation as well as its structural engineering, said Alan Lulloff, chief scientist at the Association of State Floodplain Managers\u2019 Flood Science Center.\n\nBut if every coal ash site is different, they are similar in the toxins they contain. And even the Obama administration\u2019s rule doesn\u2019t fully address the worsening dangers climate change poses, scientists and environmentalists say.\n\nLawmakers and regulators in some states, such as Illinois, North Carolina and Virginia, are taking matters into their own hands by requiring utilities to haul ash away from floodplains and prove they have the money to clean up their sites. But they worry about the companies either resisting or slow-walking the efforts.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always been concerned about those containment ponds and the leaching. We feel like we\u2019re under assault,\u201d said North Carolina state Sen. Harper Peterson, a Democrat whose district includes a coal ash pond that spilled when Florence struck in 2018. \u201cIt just highlighted how vulnerable we are now more than ever with storms.\u201d\n\nBillions in liability\n\nThe effects of flooding were either unforeseen or unacknowledged when electric companies built coal-fired power plants near bodies of water in the early and mid-20th century.\n\nThe locations made sense at the time: Barges moved coal along rivers, and power plants use tremendous amounts of water for cooling. And not unlike agricultural runoff or chemicals used in manufacturing, coal ash escaped regulation for much of its existence.\n\nBut now, utilities and nearby communities face billions of dollars in potential liability or cleanup costs. Duke Energy said adhering to the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality's order to excavate six sites near waterways would cost $5 billion. Dominion Energy\u2019s cleanup at four Virginia sites will cost $3 billion under a deal brokered with the state.\n\nSpill costs can be just as massive. The 2008 spill that sparked a push for federal rules, at a Tennessee Valley Authority power plant in Kingston, Tenn., cost $1.2 billion to clean up and has been linked to the deaths of dozens of workers who contracted cancer and other diseases after responding to the disaster. Damage from a 2014 spill on the Dan River in North Carolina reached $395 million, according to the U.S. Forest Service.\n\nWhat's more, floods and hurricanes will grow in severity as greenhouse gas emissions rise and scramble rainfall patterns, 13 federal agencies warned in last fall\u2019s National Climate Assessment.\n\nThe assessment said flooding risk is particularly acute in the Southeast and along rivers in the Midwest. That\u2019s where 90 of the sites in FEMA\u2019s high-risk flood zones reside, POLITICO\u2019s analysis found. The National Climate Assessment noted that extreme precipitation spiked 42 percent in the Midwest and 27 percent in the Southeast between 1958 and 2016, and said the Midwest and parts of the Southeast will see another 40-plus percent increase by 2100 if emissions trajectories go unchanged.\n\n\"Existing flood map boundaries do not account for future flood risk due to the increasing frequency of more intense precipitation events, as well as new development that would reduce the floodplain's ability to manage storm water,\u201d the climate assessment said of the Southeast.\n\nAlice Hill, who was senior director for climate resilience on former President Barack Obama\u2019s National Security Council, shared the agencies' pessimistic view of future flooding risks.\n\n\u201cHistory is no longer a safe guide: the \u20181 in 100 year flood\u2019 may occur far more frequently,\u201d Hill said by email. \u201cIf coal ash pond flood protection does not account for changing flood risk as a result of climate change, flood protection measures may prove inadequate when flooding exceeds historical records.\u201d\n\nBesides being increasingly outdated, FEMA's maps are also subject to political pressures: In 2017, just one year after Hurricane Matthew hit Duke\u2019s retired H.F. Lee Power Station in Goldsboro, N.C., spilling coal ash into the Neuse River, the utility persuaded the agency to redraw its maps to exclude an active ash pond from the high-risk flood zone. Florence hit two different, inactive ash ponds at the power plant the following year, along with Duke\u2019s Sutton Lake site in Wilmington.\n\nMorning Energy newsletter The source for energy and environment news \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

He added that \u201ccritic groups greatly exaggerated the significance of those \u2018spills\u2019\u201d at Lee and Sutton Lake, noting that the state Department of Environmental Quality\u2019s testing at both locations \u201cdemonstrated that water quality remained protected.\u201d\n\nThe risks aren\u2019t limited to what people can see on the surface, however. Drinking water wells in rural areas that tap into groundwater already show contamination from chemicals such as arsenic, lithium, cobalt and radium near 24 coal ash sites across 13 states, according to the EPA and environmental groups Environmental Integrity Project and Earthjustice.\n\nGroundwater contamination for pollutants such as molybdenum, arsenic, thallium, lithium, selenium, cobalt and radium also exceeded EPA health safety standards at 91 percent of 265 power plants covered by the Obama administration\u2019s coal ash rule, the two environmental groups found based on EPA data.\n\nEPA revisits Obama rule\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s 2015 rule sought to lessen the risks by requiring utilities to monitor groundwater for pollution near sites, restricting the locations where ash ponds can be placed, and establishing pollution triggers that compel utilities to close or retrofit pits with protective lining. Utilities could keep disposal sites in high-risk flood zones only if they took steps to prevent toxins from traversing through groundwater.\n\nThe rule prohibits coal ash sites in wetlands or earthquake-prone areas, and it says the bottoms of pits must sit at least 5 feet above the uppermost aquifer. It requires power companies to monitor groundwater near sites for 30 years.\n\nThe regulation compelled dozens of coal ash sites to shut down, the utilities group\u2019s Roewer said.\n\n\"Many, perhaps even most of the facilities will close,\" he said.\n\nBut environmentalists say the rule has its share of holes: It doesn\u2019t apply to more than 100 sites that had stopped taking new coal waste before the rule took effect in 2015, even if the existing coal ash remains on site. (The Obama-era EPA also did not classify coal ash as hazardous waste, a step that many activists demanded but could have hampered its use as a recycled ingredient in wallboard and concrete.)\n\nIn addition, many utilities covered by the rule are falling behind on meeting their cleanup requirements.\n\nAnd Trump\u2019s moves would weaken the rule further. In place of the Obama rule's restrictions on coal ash ponds in flood zones, EPA is considering letting states use as-yet-undefined \u201calternative, risk-based location-restrictions\u201d that environmentalists worry will weaken efforts to prevent spills and contamination. It also has proposed letting states waive some cleanup requirements, exclude certain contaminants from pollution programs and suspend groundwater monitoring.\n\nIn July, the Trump administration also decided against requiring companies to prove they have the money to clean up future coal ash spills.\n\nEPA said in a statement that it would not discuss pending changes to the rule.\n\nPower companies and eco-activists also disagree about whether utilities' existing efforts comply with the 2015 rule. For example, the rule allows utilities to cap their ash ponds instead of removing the waste if the ash is dry and water cannot infiltrate the deposits. But environmentalists contend that companies routinely flout those requirements.\n\nTrump\u2019s rollback could also shoot holes through the program by adding obstacles for citizen lawsuits, which have compelled the most coal ash cleanups to date, said Nat Mund, federal affairs director with the Southern Environmental Law Center. \u201cIt\u2019s basically taking away the entire safety net,\u201d Mund said.\n\nAt the same time, research that Appalachian State University\u2019s Cowan has conducted with Duke University scientist Avner Vengosh suggests that coal ash spills may routinely go unreported \u2014 indicating that the problem is even bigger than commonly believed.\n\nTheir study of North Carolina's Sutton Lake, where coal ash spilled during Florence, revealed contamination dating to 2015. Cowan believes heavy rainfall and other events linked to climate change may be the culprit.\n\n\u201cThe train has left the station,\u201d Vengosh said. \"It\u2019s not something in the future; it\u2019s happening already.\"\n\nTucker Doherty contributed graphics to this report, with text by Zack Colman.\n\nThis article tagged under: Climate Change\n\nEnvironment", "description": "More than 100 ponds and landfills containing coal ash lie in areas FEMA has designated as high-risk flood zones, according to a POLITICO analysis.", "authors": ["Zack Colman"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/76/ac/c05394dd4feb968cc16db756d431/20190823-coal-ash-new-ap-773.jpg"}
