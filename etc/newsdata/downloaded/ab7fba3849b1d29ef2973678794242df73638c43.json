(Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi and senior House Democrats agreed in a private meeting Wednesday that they should narrow their impeachment investigation of President Trump to his dealings with the president of Ukraine, according to five Democrats familiar with the conversation.\n\nThe closed-door meeting took place shortly after the White House released a rough transcript of a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which Trump pressed Zelensky to work with Attorney General William P. Barr and personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, who is seeking to unseat Trump.\n\nDemocrats said the evidence was incriminating enough \u2014 and easy enough for voters to understand \u2014 to proceed with their impeachment inquiry and soon. \u201cStrike while the iron\u2019s hot,\u201d said one individual in the meeting, summarizing the sentiment. Democrats said they could move quickly on impeachment and act by the end of the year.\n\nThe Democrats spoke on the condition of anonymity to freely describe private discussions.\n\nInside the room, Democrats said, Pelosi (D-Calif.) told colleagues that keeping the inquiry narrowly focused on the Ukraine allegations could also help keep the investigation out of the courts, where a slew of investigative matters have been bogged down for months \u2014 though she did not rule out ultimately including other episodes in potential articles of impeachment.\n\nThe meeting included multiple members of the House Judiciary Committee, which has been probing alleged obstruction of justice, self-dealing and other matters involving Trump, though not Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.). It ended without a firm decision on whether to circumscribe those probes entirely but with consensus inside the room that narrowing the investigation, if only in terms of political messaging, made sense.\n\n\u201cI think we need to focus on what this very clear threat to national security and to our Constitution is,\u201d said Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.), a member of Pelosi\u2019s leadership circle who spoke generally about her own views but not about what was said inside the meeting. \u201cI think a lot of the American people understand that, . . . and I think we need to focus on something that everybody understands.\u201d\n\n[Trump offered Ukrainian president Justice Dept. help for Biden investigation, memo shows]\n\nEarlier Wednesday, rank-and-file House Democrats had split on whether to keep the investigation narrowly focused on the Ukrainian affair or look at a much broader portfolio of alleged wrongdoing.\n\nThe question, according to conversations with more than a dozen lawmakers and aides Wednesday, stands to be crucial to the unfolding probe. How it is resolved will dictate key decisions, such as how long the investigation will take, which committees and lawmakers will be involved and what witnesses will be brought before Congress.\n\nMultiple Judiciary Committee members said that they expected probes of other matters to continue unabated and potentially contribute to impeachment articles drafted this year. Several liberal lawmakers also want to include multiple charges in any impeachment articles.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s clearly enough evidence before the Judiciary Committee, in my view, to support articles of impeachment on a number of issues,\u201d said Rep. David N. Cicilline (D-R.I.), a member of both the Judiciary panel and the House leadership team.\n\nBut he added that the final decision would be made by Democratic leaders after the process played out, and he recognized the Ukraine allegations were unique: \u201cIf this is the scandal and the conduct of the president which unites the Congress in the urgency of taking action, then we ought to proceed with that. This is not about an affinity for our own work. This is about showing the country that as a body, the Congress of the United States is going to stand up and protect the rule of law.\u201d\n\nOthers, however, were less equivocal. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to go narrow, no question about it,\u201d said Rep. G.K. Butterfield (D-N.C.), arguing the president\u2019s admission of intervention in the Ukraine matter would simplify the impeachment process. \u201cI would hope within a six-week frame, we could get the evidence on the table so the American people can see it, and hopefully we will have some resolution before the holidays.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to reporters Wednesday, House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) held up the rough transcript of the Trump-Zelensky phone call and said the House would focus on its contents in the coming days and weeks.\n\n\u201cWe are going to focus on this particular matter,\u201d he said, noting that the substance of the alleged wrongdoing \u2014 urging a foreign leader to intervene to influence an upcoming election \u2014 was simple for the public to understand.\n\n[White House blocks two former aides from testifying before House Judiciary Committee]\n\nAt a news conference later Wednesday, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) would not answer questions about the scope of the impeachment proceedings against Trump. But he told reporters that the transcript is \u201cfar more damning than I and others had imagined\u201d and accused Trump of engaging in a \u201cclassic mafia-like shakedown of a foreign leader.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is how a mafia boss talks\u201d he said, referring to Trump\u2019s discussion of \u201creciprocity\u201d on the call. \u201cLike any mafia boss, the president didn\u2019t need to say, \u2018That\u2019s a nice country you have. It would be a shame if something happened to it.\u2019 Because that was clear from the conversation. There is no quid pro quo necessary to betray your country or your oath or office.\u201d\n\nThere is a sense among senior Democrats that the Ukraine matter is a much clearer argument to make against Trump than, for example, obstruction-of-justice allegations made by former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III or other admissions of wrongdoing.\n\nDemocrats also argue that because the issue relates to national security, voters may care about it more. The party has struggled to move public sentiment on impeaching Trump, but they are hoping that if anything will resonate, it would be the latest revelation.\n\nRead more at PowerPost", "description": "Democrats are split on whether to include existing allegations of obstruction of justice, self-enrichment and more or to focus exclusively on Trump\u2019s request that Ukraine probe Biden.", "authors": ["Mike Debonis", "Congressional Reporter Covering The House Of Representatives", "Rachael Bade", "Congressional Reporter", "September At Pm", "Mike Debonis Covers Congress", "With A Focus On The House", "For The Washington Post.
