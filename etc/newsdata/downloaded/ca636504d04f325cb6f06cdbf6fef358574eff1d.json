REUTERS/Lim Huey Teng\n\nGrowing opposition to the Hong Kong government has plunged the financial hub into its biggest political crisis in decades and poses the gravest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.\n\nSpeaking at a conference in Kuala Lumpur, Mahathir, referring to Beijing, said Lam \u201chas to obey the masters and at the same time she has to ask her conscience.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think best thing is to resign,\u201d Mahathir said, according to a recording of comments, heard by Reuters, that he made when asked what advice he might give Lam.\n\nMahathir also said he expected China to take action against the protesters, drawing a parallel to student protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989.\n\n\u201cYes, they allowed you to demonstrate and all that but eventually in a system that is authoritarian they will come back and do what they have to do,\u201d he said.\n\nMahathir, 94, is one of Asia\u2019s most experienced and outspoken leaders. He was prime minister for 22 years from 1981, only to come out of retirement last year to head a government after an opposition election victory.\n\nThe protests in Hong Kong began over a now-withdrawn extradition bill, which would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial, and have intensified markedly since June. They have also evolved into wider calls for democracy, among other demands.\n\nDemonstrators are angry at what they see as creeping interference by Beijing in their city\u2019s affairs despite a promise of autonomy in the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula under which Hong Kong returned to China in 1997.\n\nChina dismisses accusations it is meddling and has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of stirring up anti-China sentiment.", "description": "Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Friday Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam should step down following months of protests against her government and he predicted China would take action to end the demonstrations.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1436934668&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF930GB", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
