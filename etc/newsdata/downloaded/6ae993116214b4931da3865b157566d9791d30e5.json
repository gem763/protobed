Then we started going back towards it\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cYou are in chaos,\u201d Margaret Atwood decrees calmly over tea. \u201cIt\u2019s Cavaliers versus Roundheads.\u201d We meet in London, the afternoon before she is due at Waterstones in Piccadilly to sell the first copy of The Testaments, the long awaited sequel to The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, at midnight, accompanied by women in the now globally recognised handmaids\u2019 costumes. Further up the river, Westminster is shutting down for five weeks. Ever since Boris Johnson raised the prospect of proroguing parliament, people have been sharing a quote from The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, published 35 years ago, just as they did in the US following the election of Donald Trump in 2016: \u201cThat was when they suspended the Constitution. They said it would be temporary. There wasn\u2019t even any rioting in the streets. People stayed at home at night, watching television.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is another predictable mess that people have got drawn into because a big honking pack of lies was told about it,\u201d Atwood says of Brexit. Apart from the legal questions \u2013 \u201cactions have consequences, but what will the consequences be?\u201d \u2013 she is most interested in \u201cwho is going to benefit from this financially? Who is shorting the pound? I can think of all kinds of people who might turn it to their advantage.\u201d\n\nAs has been noted, the last time a novel received such a fanfare was the midnight launches for Harry Potter books \u2013 with fans sporting specs and scarves instead of capes and bonnets. Atwood is our high sorceress, a very grownup one, with a truly unnerving knack for auspicious timing. Her best work combines psychological acuity with audacious curiosity; she is as good at recreating the politics of the playground (Cat\u2019s Eye, 1989) as she is at inventing a chillingly plausible male theocracy. She is both deadly serious and surprisingly playful, and it is to her that readers have turned as a way of making sense of the world, helped by the hugely successful TV adaptation of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. With cameo appearances as an Aunt, and another in the TV version of her 1996 novel Alias Grace, which also aired in 2017, she describes the last couple of years as \u201chorrible fun: when the occasion for the fun is not so happy. And the occasion for the fun is the rise of religious fundamentalist actions against women\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest People dressed as handmaids queue to get a copy of The Testaments on the day of its release.

Yet back in 1985, when The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, Atwood\u2019s sixth novel, was published, \u201ca big fuss was not particularly made. I think we had some sort of publisher\u2019s party,\u201d she says dryly.\n\nThe sequel has been surrounded by levels of secrecy to rival any ex-prime minister\u2019s memoir, with tales of Booker judges\u2019 computers being hacked (The Testaments is on this year\u2019s shortlist). \u201cI left my computer on a plane,\u201d she confides. \u201cI forgot about it because I was watching Captain Underpants.\u201d She didn\u2019t have a copy of The Testaments on it, but there was enough information to cause a stir if it fell into the wrong hands. Atwood doesn\u2019t \u2013 yet \u2013 have the powers to ground a plane, but she was reunited with her computer within two hours. \u201cIt would have been a catastrophe,\u201d she says, laughing now.\n\nThen Amazon blew it all by sending out copies in the US a week ahead of publication. \u201cSomebody pushed the wrong button. It was human error,\u201d she says unruffled. \u201cThey apologised, which is apparently among the first times, if not the first time, that Amazon have ever apologised.\u201d\n\nDespite her formidable energy, Atwood embodies an owl-like stillness \u2013 head tilted, listening carefully, with only her hands moving when she speaks. She gives long, far-ranging answers (not always to the question asked), and can leap from Mary Queen of Scots to Mary Poppins, or from the Cromwells to the day\u2019s news, in the blink of a gimlet eye. At nearly 80, what does she make of this remarkable late boost? \u201cIsn\u2019t it wild,\u201d she says. \u201cI can\u2019t remember a time when I was a usual anything,\u201d she says. \u201cI mean going way back. I didn\u2019t grow up in a usual way\u201d (her childhood was spent in the Canadian wilderness). \u201cI wasn\u2019t a usual kind of high-school student. I was a very peculiar university student and it continued on from there.\u201d Atwood \u201cbecame\u201d a writer at 16, when she made up a poem in her head while crossing a football field. Since then she has written more than 60 books, in almost every genre, and has been awarded more than 100 prizes, including the Booker in 2000 for The Blind Assassin. Her futuristic trilogy \u2013 Oryx and Crake (2003), The Year of the Flood (2009) and MaddAddam (2013) \u2013 has an ardent following. She lives in Toronto with her partner, the writer Graeme Gibson, spending their summers on Pelee Island, where she has written many of her novels, including much of The Testaments (as well as a stint, more surprisingly, in Norwich).\n\nThis is a hinge mom\u00adent in our times. One of those puzzles in which you need to open the right door. So, human race, which door will you open?\n\nThe author has just had a long chat with Bruce Miller, the TV series\u2019 showrunner, who is \u201cquite thrilled\u201d about the new novel, \u201cbecause it gives him a lot more to work with\u201d. Atwood, an executive producer on the show, had started writing The Testaments before the first season launched. And there shouldn\u2019t be any clashes, as her sequel picks up 15 years later: \u201cWe know where we start in the 15 years, but there\u2019s quite a lot of squeezing room for things that happen leading up to that,\u201d the author explains. \u201cI\u2019ve given him a lot of blank space that will be his to fill. We agreed he can\u2019t kill off certain people a long time ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cHands off Aunt Lydia\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t touch that baby\u201d were her principal stipulations. \u201cI needed this child here and that child there \u2013 so that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to be.\u201d The Testaments is narrated by three voices: it is the last will and testament of Aunt Lydia, and the testimonies of two girls, Agnes who has grown up in Gilead, and Daisy who escaped to Canada with her mother as a baby. Atwood\u2019s reluctance to write as Offred, the narrator of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, was one of the reasons it took her so long to attempt a sequel, despite \u201cthe clamouring\u201d from readers. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do it,\u201d she says emphatically. \u201cNot possible. To recreate that voice and do more of it. I just couldn\u2019t.\u201d She is wary of follow-ups in general. \u201cThey are always kind of imitations. I saw Mary Poppins Returns. A commendable sequel. I enjoyed it, but it\u2019s not the same.\u201d\n\nAtwood has said in the past that The Handmaid\u2019s Tale was written to answer the question: if there was a totalitarian regime in the US what form would it take? The Testaments sets out to show how such a regime collapses: \u201cWhat makes them turn into something else? What makes them fall apart?\u201d And for that she needed an insider: \u201cSo who in that whole cast of characters is going to know more? There\u2019s only one answer to that.\u201d Aunt Lydia, a female Thomas Cromwell, \u201cswollen with power\u201d but without absolute authority.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018We will not forget\u2019 ... protesters dressed as handmaids stand outside the US supreme court in 2018. Photograph: UPI/Barcroft Images\n\nMany readers have wondered what they might do in Offred\u2019s situation, how to resist and survive; by giving us Aunt Lydia\u2019s story, Atwood asks us to think about questions of cruelty and complicity. All her novels are about survival. As Aunt Lydia reflects: \u201cWhat good is it to throw yourself in front of a steamroller out of moral principles and then be crushed flat like a sock emptied of its foot? ... Better to hurl rocks than to have them hurled at you.\u201d Or as Atwood puts it: \u201cWe are ordinary as long as it is easy to be ordinary.\u201d She quotes a Polish resistance fighter from the second world war who once told her: \u2018\u201cPray that you will never have the occasion to be a hero.\u2019 You don\u2019t run into a burning building and rescue somebody unless there\u2019s a burning building \u2026 Similarly, you don\u2019t run away from a burning building and ignore everything, unless there\u2019s a burning building.\u201d\n\nBut the main reason for not returning sooner to the world she had created was because, before now, it no longer seemed relevant. \u201cFor a long time we were going away from Gilead and then we turned around and started going back towards Gilead, so it did seem pertinent.\u201d The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, which Atwood began writing in West Berlin in 1984, was her response to those who wanted to reverse the freedoms gained by women in the 70s, to put the butterflies back in the box. \u201cThey just didn\u2019t have the power to make that happen.\u201d Now they do.\n\nThe novel\u2019s status as a feminist classic has perhaps overshadowed another of its most prescient warnings \u2013 the catalyst for Gilead was environmental catastrophe. In The Testaments Aunt Lydia catalogues the natural disasters that ravaged \u201cher vanished country\u201d, before continuing. \u201cPeople became frightened. Then they became angry. The absence of viable remedies. The search for someone to blame. You don\u2019t believe the sky is falling in until a chunk of it falls on you.\u201d\n\nIf the novel deals less explicitly with the crisis than we might have expected, her point is the same: the burden will fall hardest on women and children. \u201cIt always does, because women and children are weaker \u2013 let\u2019s take their stuff,\u201d she says. But, as Atwood points out, she \u201cdid climate apocalypse quite thoroughly\u201d in the MaddAddam trilogy. \u201cMaybe not thoroughly enough,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause I think it is actually going to be worse.\u201d But she is not without hope, and if she was younger she would \u201cabsolutely be doing Extinction Rebellion\u201d. She was the first writer to donate a manuscript to the Future Library, in which stories remain unread for 100 years, when they will be printed on paper from a newly planted forest in Norway.\n\nAt an event last summer, a member of the audience asked Atwood for one word to sum up the times we are living in. \u201cVital,\u201d she fired back. \u201cThis is a hinge moment, in many different ways,\u201d she says now. \u201cLet\u2019s call it the casket moment,\u201d an allusion to the three caskets in The Merchant of Venice. \u201cOne of those puzzles in which you need to open the right door. So, \u2018All right human race, which door are you going to open?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Testaments by Margaret Atwood review \u2013 a dazzling follow-up to The Handmaid\u2019s Tale Read more\n\nOne of Atwood\u2019s central axioms is that nothing can be included in her fiction that hadn\u2019t happened somewhere in the world. As Atwood has reminded us: she didn\u2019t make this stuff up, the human race did. \u201cIf I was to create an imaginary garden, I wanted the toads in it to be real,\u201d she wrote in a recent introduction to The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. And this is \u201cabsolutely\u201d the case for The Testaments: shadows of Weinstein and Epstein, Isis and the Trump administration can all be found in its murky waters. It is impossible to read the scenes set in a female detention camp without thinking of the US-Mexico border.\n\nWarnings aren\u2019t effective if they are just preaching.\n\nIs Atwood firing a warning or reflecting what is already happening? \u201cBoth. But warnings aren\u2019t effective if they are just preaching. Enactments are of interest because then people think \u2018What would I do?\u2019 Whereas if someone is going \u2018Don\u2019t do that, don\u2019t do that,\u2019\u201d she says, wagging her finger. \u201cYou think \u2018Oh shut up!\u2019\u201d\n\nThis is the sixth time Atwood has been shortlisted for the Booker prize. \u201cThere are upsides and downsides\u201d to winning, she says. If you win everyone says you shouldn\u2019t have won the Booker. And if you don\u2019t win, in Canada anyway, they say \u2018Atwood fails to win Booker\u2019.\u201d And then there is the Nobel. \u201cOh purlease \u2026\u201d She is already at work on a collection of poetry, often her way of working up to a novel. And she hasn\u2019t ruled out a further instalment: \u201cNever say never to anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly dead people are allowed to have statues, but I have been given one while still alive\u201d: so Aunt Lydia opens The Testaments. Is there an Atwood statue? \u201cThere\u2019s a head,\u201d she laughs. \u201cWe used to call it the horrible head.\u201d The plaster cast is in her cellar, the original, made in the 70s, at McMaster University. \u201cI don\u2019t look like that,\u201d she told the sculptor, who replied. \u201cBut you will \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople bang on about your legacy,\u201d she says, impatiently. \u201cI\u2019m not that interested because I\u2019m not going to be here. I\u2019m not going to be around haunting my legacy. Unless I do an Aunt Lydia and bury little manuscripts in libraries.\u201d Well, there\u2019s already that story buried away in the Future Library. Praise be.\n\n\u2022 Since we went to press, Margaret Atwood\u2019s partner Graeme Gibson has sadly died at the age of 85.\n\n\u2022 The Testaments by Margaret Atwood is published by Chatto (\u00a320).
