Democrats have claimed that the call revealed a quid pro quo in which Trump tied the request to nearly $400 million in frozen military money.\n\nPence spokesperson Katie Waldman said late Friday that the vice president's office received the letter \"after it was released to the media and it has been forwarded to [White House] Counsel\u2019s Office for a response.\n\n\"Given the scope, it does not appear to be a serious request but just another attempt by the Do Nothing Democrats to call attention to their partisan impeachment,\" Waldman added. \"Despite their efforts to distract and obstruct our agenda, this Administration will stay focused on creating jobs, securing the border, rebuilding our military, negotiating better trade deals, and the issues most important to the American people.\"\n\nThe letter to Pence points to recent reports that it says raise questions about Pence\u2019s role in doubling down on Trump\u2019s message to Zelensky -- including a Sept. 1. meeting with Zelensky in Warsaw.\n\nSpecifically, it cites a Washington Post article that reported Pence was involved in efforts to exert pressure on Ukraine, including telling Zelensky that U.S. aid was being withheld while also demanding more action on corruption. Officials close to Pence told The Post that he was unaware of Trump\u2019s discussion about Biden, although it also reported that a member of Pence\u2019s staff may have participated in the July call.\n\n\u201cRecently, public reports have raised questions about any role you may have played in conveying or reinforcing the president\u2019s stark message to the Ukrainian president,\u201d the letter says. \u201cThe reports include specific references to a member of your staff who may have participated directly in the July 25, 2019, call, documents you may have obtained or reviewed, including the record of the call, and your Sept.1, 2019, meeting with the Ukrainian president in Warsaw, during which you reportedly discussed the administration\u2019s hold on U.S. security assistance to Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThe documents the committees are requesting include all those related to Trump\u2019s call in July, and another in April, as well as communications among current or former officials and meetings between Trump officials and Ukrainian government officials. Trump has previously said that Democrats can have the transcript of the April call.\n\nTRUMP FIRES BROADSIDE AT 'PILLAGING' BIDENS, CLAIMS UKRAINE PUSH WAS ONLY ABOUT 'CORRUPTION'\n\nThe move represents the latest salvo in the escalating impeachment war between the White House and House Democrats. Democrats have been preparing subpoenas for the White House, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo faces a deadline to comply with a separate subpoena.\n\nOn Friday, Trump confirmed that he planned to send a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., \u201cdaring\u201d her to hold a vote on Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. The letter is expected to say that the White House won\u2019t comply with the Democrats\u2019 investigation because Pelosi has not codified the probe with a formal vote on the House floor.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nHe also defended his actions and sought again to put the spotlight back on Biden and alleged corruption in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about Biden\u2019s campaign, but I do care about corruption,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI don\u2019t care about politics, I don\u2019t care about anything. I care about corruption.\u201d\n\nFox News\u2019 Brooke Singman and John Roberts contributed to this report.", "description": "House Democrats on Friday sent a letter requesting documents from Vice President Mike Pence as part of the impeachment inquiry into President Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president.", "authors": ["Adam Shaw"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Mike-Pence-.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
