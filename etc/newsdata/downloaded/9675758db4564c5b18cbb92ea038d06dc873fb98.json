Maybe a new video game or a comfy new BTS sweater.\n\nIf you\u2019re BTS leader Namjoon (a.k.a. RM), on the other hand, a sweater isn\u2019t going to cut it. After all, you have an entire army behind you.\n\nAnd the BTS fanbase \u2014 also known as ARMY \u2014 is known for grand gestures.\n\nEarlier this month, they boycotted the MTV VMAs to host their own award show on Twitter using the hashtag #BTSMVAS.\n\nWe want to thank you all for participating in this project! It started as a way to speak out against gatekeepers in the industry, but become a beautiful ARMY x BTS memory!\n\n\n\nLet's always fight for @BTS_twt and speak up when we know something isn't right. #BTSMVAs #BTSMVAwards pic.twitter.com/7mw3TVOvZ0 \u2014 #BTSMVAs [REST] \ufffd\ufffd (@Highlight_Army) August 27, 2019\n\nSo what would an appropriate gift from ARMY look like for RM\u2019s bday?\n\nOne that an entire army is capable of doing, of course. For Namjoon, they planted a forest in the Philippines.\n\n\ufffd\ufffdPlant Today, Save Tomorrow Year 2\ufffd\ufffd\n\n\n\nTo celebrate RM's birthday, we planted 600 indigenous trees in Sierra Madre, the longest mountain range in PH, hoping to leave a legacy for RM & ARMY and be part of the solution to climate change.#weloveyouTREEthousand#Namjooning #\ub098\ubb34 \ufffd\ufffd pic.twitter.com/Adb0tMqRWV \u2014 Kim Namjoon PH \ufffd\ufffd (@KimNamjoonPHL) September 8, 2019\n\nBelieve it or not, this isn\u2019t out of left field for ARMY.\n\nEarlier this year, the United Nations awarded them the recognition of Top Rank Sustainable Global Group for their work in sustainability.\n\nSo what was Namjoon doing on his 25th birthday (or 26th, based on Korean age)?\n\nBlowing a kiss, of course.\n\nTo respond to the grand bday gesture, the BTS official Twitter page tweeted out this vid of Namjoon showing some love.\n\nLet\u2019s not forget that there are seven members of BTS, though, and Jimin\u2019s birthday is around the corner on Oct. 13.\n\nBut how do you top planting a forest? We\u2019ll have to wait and see!", "description": "BTS leader Namjoon\u2019s ARMY fanbase plants an entire forest for his 25th birthday on Sept. 12.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/kidsnews//content/_card_resize/BTSbirthday_thumbnail.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
