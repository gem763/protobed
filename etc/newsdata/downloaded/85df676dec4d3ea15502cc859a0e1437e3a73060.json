And while the success part of that equation is inarguable \u2014 the Dave Matthews Band is reliably among the country\u2019s most popular concert draws and has earned six No. 1 albums \u2014 the polarization part has recently shown signs of positive thaw. (That\u2019s no surprise to anyone who saw Lady Bird; and the May 18 kick off of his summer tour as well as the arrival of a lovely and reflective new album, Come Tomorrow, due out June 8, should also keep the momentum going.) \u201cI do wonder about the success I\u2019ve had and whether I deserve it,\u201d says the 51-year-old Matthews, his beard flecked with gray, looking pensively out a conference-room window at the New York offices. \u201cI\u2019m humbled that anyone still wants to take the time to listen to my music or hear me talk.\u201d He grins. \u201cBut I\u2019m happy to have the opportunity.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d been planning on starting with a question about the new album, but just before you got here someone I work with was telling me how much he\u2019d been obsessed with your music \u2014 and how much he felt like he didn\u2019t jibe with your hard-core fans. So why don\u2019t we start there, because I\u2019ve heard other people say similar things. Where does the antipathy towards the clich\u00e9 of a Dave Matthews fan come from?\n\nThis is a delicate thing for me to talk about. I\u2019m grateful I have any fans, but I don\u2019t understand how my fan base grew or what sort of cultural elements dominate. You know, I was on tour in Europe recently, playing with Tim Reynolds, and in Prague we played an opera house. The audience there was deathly quiet. Playing for an audience listening absolutely to everything that you do makes you focus as a musician in a beautiful way \u2014 you can achieve different dynamics. And that kind of audience attention is very, very flattering because you know they\u2019re not there for a party, which I happen to think Dave Matthews Band fans are \u2014 that\u2019s what butters my bread. And that\u2019s great, by the way. I\u2019m glad to be able to give people a party.\n\nIs the music you were making in Prague impossible at your typical gigs?\n\nIt\u2019s very hard to pull off. When Tim and I played for 20-something-thousand people in Saratoga Springs last summer, the crowd was jumping around and having a great time \u2014 and we were having a great time \u2014 but it was like \u201cHoly shit!\u201d You\u2019re just trying to ride the energy as best you can. So to answer your question \u2014 and I\u2019m trying to answer without attacking the culture that\u2019s grown up around us \u2014 I could imagine that someone who had heard a recording of ours and liked it and was faced with our big, raucous audience might think, What is happening here?\n\nWhat\u2019s the best way you like to hear live music?\n\nWhen I go to a show, I go with an obsessive desire to hear everything. I went to see alt-J recently: They\u2019re very deliberate musicians and their audience is so quiet. We\u2019re a party band. That\u2019s not all the music is \u2014 it\u2019s often something much darker \u2014 but we are about a party. It\u2019s almost like what people might think of as a Jimmy Buffett concert. And don\u2019t get me wrong, Jimmy Buffett is amazing. But in general there\u2019s a connect and a disconnect: People are coming to see the Dave Matthews Band\n\nand dance and sing \u2014 and that\u2019s a good thing for there to be in the world \u2014 but when I listen to music I sort of want everyone to be quiet. So respect is being paid at our shows, but maybe not exactly the same way I would pay it.\n\nThere\u2019s this romantic ideal of the rock star as someone who ruthlessly follows his or her own artistic vision. But there\u2019s another kind of star, someone like Jimmy Buffett or, in a different way, the Grateful Dead, who become vessels for a subculture, and their vision involves attending to that subculture. In your experience are those two modes necessarily oppositional?\n\nI think I\u2019ve been lucky enough to follow my instincts. Or at least try to. I tell you what: I do question myself.\n\nWhat\u2019s the question?\n\nCan I justify doing this?\n\nWhat\u2019s \u201cthis\u201d?\n\nDriving this career. Am I challenging myself? Am I eating my own tail? Am I just feeding off the thing that allowed me to be doing so extraordinarily well? That\u2019s always the tension. Maybe you want to be a painter but to make money you do commercial art. Maybe you want to be a landscape photographer but for a career you take wedding photos. I\u2019ll write a funky song about lust and sex and it makes you want to dance. I feel like that\u2019s okay. But I also have to write songs about the dilemmas of being alive. This same question is something I talk to my wife and kids about.\n\nWhat do they say?\n\nThey love what I do, but they also know that I\u2019m lucky enough to have the opportunity to put myself out there by, say, following my heart with visual art or going on a very different musical adventure. Maybe I need to follow those instincts. Maybe I\u2019m being dishonest if I don\u2019t.\n\nWhen have you felt most gratified by following your instincts?\n\nWell, right now I\u2019m working with a friend, Anthony Lucero, who wrote this beautiful story about a clown. That story has become a small film called Halo of Stars and I worked on the music. I remember when I first played Anthony some music I\u2019d thought of for the film: We were sitting in the same room and I was thinking, I hope he\u2019s not expecting music like my band\u2019s. And Anthony was thinking, God, I hope he doesn\u2019t play music that sounds like \u2026 Then I played the music, which was very different for me, and Anthony really responded to it. That was a very beautiful experience. I wasn\u2019t answering to anything other than the act of making new music, and that music was made with pure intention.\n\nAre there times when it wasn\u2019t?\n\nI think sometimes I \u2026 Sometimes I spend a lot of my life trying to get answers from the people around me instead of listening to myself. But after I turned 50, something happened. I\u2019ve realized that there are more important things than saying \u201cokay.\u201d An example is the last album I made, which is fine. It\u2019s called Away From the World. I think it was a great album and then I let people convince me it wasn\u2019t finished. I did a disservice to the music. I kept working on it and it lost a lot. It\u2019s too bad I didn\u2019t say, \u201cNo, you\u2019re wrong. The music may be flawed and splintered but it\u2019s genuine. It\u2019s done.\u201d The new album, I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s good or bad, but I managed to say \u201cNo.\u201d People were saying things like, \u201cI don\u2019t know if we should put this song or that song on the album.\u201d And I was able to say, \u201cYou\u2019re wrong. We\u2019re leaving it.\u201d But I hope I never feel like I\u2019ve got it \u201cright\u201d creatively. That probably wouldn\u2019t be a good sign.\n\nHow satisfying was Lady Bird for you? Both for way it used \u201cCrash Into Me\u201d so warmly and also for how it showed a fan of yours who didn\u2019t fit any of the negative clich\u00e9s. And also, that movie kicked off such a nice wave of affection for the band.\n\nThere was a great headline I saw online: something like \u201cLady Bird Somehow Resurrects the Dave Matthews Band.\u201d Without question \u2014 and some express it with more vinegar than others \u2014 there are people who truly don\u2019t like my band. I think a lot of them just go, \u201cI hate the Dave Matthews band\u201d because they saw someone they didn\u2019t like in one of our T-shirts. But everything to do with Lady Bird was flattering. It was so lovely to see the song used as a central tool in someone else\u2019s story. And the moment in the movie when it plays is so beautiful: Lady Bird takes a stand, you know? It was also nice for me to see the song through someone else\u2019s eyes because I have a strange relationship with a lot of music that I\u2019ve written. I listen to it and I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat am I talking about? This is bullshit.\u201d So seeing \u201cCrash Into Me\u201d in Lady Bird allowed me to hear my music without having to impose myself on it.\n\nA lot of people \u2014 you included \u2014 seem to have serious extra-musical feelings about the Dave Matthews Band. How much of a hindrance is that?\n\nYeah, it used to be \u201cIf you like Nirvana you can\u2019t like the Dave Matthews Band\u201d; \u201cIf you like Pearl Jam you can\u2019t like the Dave Matthews Band.\u201d But if I can like all those bands as much as I do, then why can\u2019t someone else? I guess we all have our tribe and you\u2019re not supposed to be in more than one. I remember the Miles Davis quote when he\u2019s asked, \u201cWhat kind of music do you like?\u201d\n\nAnd he answers, \u201cGood music is good music.\u201d\n\nGood music, yeah. I love some country music because there\u2019s great country music. I love some heavy metal because there\u2019s great heavy metal. Someone is going to have brilliance inside of whatever box they\u2019re in. That brilliance is what I look for. There\u2019s great every kind of music just like there\u2019s great every kind of liquor.\n\nWhat do you think was going on in the \u201990s that allowed for bands like yours, Phish, Blues Traveler, Widespread Panic, and so on, to find a big following? Was it just a coincidence that jam bands broke out back then?\n\nThere was a scene, and we were kind of against what was viewed as the legitimate rock music of the time. \u201cJam band\u201d was pejorative, you know? It was never \u201cthe critically acclaimed jam band.\u201d We were dismissed. But that also made what we were doing feel like a response to something and that made it exciting. There was also the Aquarium Rescue Unit, B\u00e9la Fleck and the Flecktones \u2014 all these cool, amazing musicians that didn\u2019t fit into one box but that had an element of spontaneity. There was comfort in the togetherness of not belonging, if that makes sense. And I say that understanding the irony of my saying \u201cI don\u2019t belong\u201d when I\u2019ve got so many people listening to my music.\n\nNow, you tell me if this is something you don\u2019t want to get into \u2014 and this could entirely be based on my misreading between the lines \u2014 but going back and reading old articles about you over the years, there were a conspicuous amount of references to drinking. Sometimes those references were playful and sometimes they weren\u2019t. So the question occurred to me: Has alcohol ever been a problem?\n\nI\u2019ve had a lot more drinking in my life than I would\u2019ve if my job hadn\u2019t put me in an environment where everybody was celebrating drinking. All the years we played clubs and frats \u2014 every single night we would be drinking and doing whatever else was happening. I still drink, and I keep my center better. I do worry about destroying my mind sometimes.\n\nHow\u2019s that?\n\nBy anyone else\u2019s standards but my own I am a raging alcoholic.\n\nThe way you said that \u2014 I can\u2019t tell how serious you\u2019re being.\n\nI mean, I\u2019m talking about the amount I drink. But if I don\u2019t have a drink for a month, I don\u2019t \u2014 it\u2019s harder for me to give up bread than it is to give up alcohol. But I like a drink. I grew up in an extended family that likes to drink. My mom, she enjoys a glass of wine or some whisky, but she\u2019s quite moderate relative to my uncles \u2014 South Africans are pretty big drinkers. I\u2019ve seen a lot of people around me go sober. The fish always gets bigger when they tell their drinking stories again, but I understand that as well.\n\nSometimes people need exaggeration in order to make sense of their lives.\n\nThat\u2019s right \u2014 however you can move forward. A lot of people deal with [drinking] beautifully and a lot of people struggle with it. But I worry. I don\u2019t drink like I used to, I don\u2019t think. But I like wine. I like the culture of it. I\u2019ve pulled back, but I like it at the same time. I like it.\n\nI appreciate how candid you\u2019re being, and I don\u2019t have any specific questions about that, but is there any more context you want to give?\n\nI will say, as an example, that I haven\u2019t had a drink in three days. As aggressively as I\u2019ll drink is how aggressively I\u2019ll then make an effort to offset it with exercise and things like that. Maybe I\u2019m lying to myself, but the reason I don\u2019t really think I\u2019m an alcoholic is because I don\u2019t miss it when I don\u2019t have it. There\u2019s no question that my favorite thing about mowing the lawn is drinking the beer when I\u2019m done, and getting to the bottom of a bottle of Jameson with a friend feels like some sort of poetic achievement \u2014 even if it\u2019s really just two people getting drunk. I don\u2019t know if any of that will convince anyone that I\u2019m not an alcoholic, but I don\u2019t have any friends who\u2019ve said, \u201cI think you have a drinking problem.\u201d Maybe that\u2019s just because when I\u2019m drunk I\u2019m a lot of fun.\n\nGiven what you\u2019ve said about drinking, is it at all weird to spend your summers getting up in front of crowds where you know a bunch of people are absolutely loaded?\n\nThere\u2019s probably not as much drinking at our shows as there are at heavy-metal shows \u2014 and our crowds are probably better looking! But yeah, you see the most hammered people in the world from the stage. There\u2019s a lot of revelry around me. I\u2019ve reined a lot of mine in over the years.\n\nWhen a show isn\u2019t quite working, do you have a fail-safe move? Is that when it\u2019s time to bust out \u201cTripping Billies\u201d?\n\nWe probably should come up with a plan for when that happens, right? When I\u2019m having a hard time, I\u2019ll usually turn to [drummer] Carter [Beauford] and say something like, \u201cBear with me.\u201d And like a brother, he usually goes, \u201cOh man, you\u2019re doing great.\u201d But I never know if that\u2019s true or if he\u2019s being nice and trying to coax me along. So no, there isn\u2019t really an automatic go-to. The truth is that you can\u2019t win every race, but you can get to the end.\n\nDave Matthews. Photo: Bobby Doherty\n\nOkay, so this question is related to things we\u2019ve already talked about a little, but any musician at your level of success \u2014 whether it\u2019s Bruce Springsteen or the Eagles or whoever \u2014 is usually tapping into something mythic that complements the music but is also bigger than it. Do you have any theories about what that might be in your case? What are people projecting onto you that makes so many of them so dedicated?\n\nThis question made me think of the first show we played. This was in Charlottesville, years ago. We were supposed to play first, but all the bands had other gigs they had to get to so we kept getting shoved further down the lineup. By the time it was our turn to play a lot of the audience had dissipated. But when we did start playing, everybody who was there started dancing. And we were like, \u201cWhat the fuck is happening here?\u201d So we learned very quickly that whatever it was that we were doing was something that translated well to audiences. It didn\u2019t necessarily translate well to tape \u2014 we didn\u2019t even hear back from most of the record companies we sent music to back then. There was not a lot of saxophone and violin and acoustic guitar happening in rock and roll at the time \u2014 or now. But this was pre-Hootie and the Blowfish even. We didn\u2019t fit in at all with what record companies might be looking for.\n\nYou\u2019re talking about being a good live band. That\u2019s obviously a huge part of what\u2019s gotten you so far, but there are lots of good live bands that haven\u2019t had nearly as much success as you\u2019ve had. What is the thing that makes people who fall in love with the Dave Matthews Band fall in love so hard? I realize I\u2019m asking you to pinpoint something that\u2019s maybe ineffable.\n\nYou\u2019re right: The whole thing that\u2019s sprung up around the band has to be at least partly about something other than the music, because the scale of the success doesn\u2019t make sense. But I don\u2019t know what the fuck is happening or how it\u2019s happening.\n\nIs it strange to feel that way?\n\nI\u2019ve come up with a defense mechanism for it. The analogy I use to explain it is something I took from Men in Black. You know there\u2019s the scene where an alien\u2019s face comes off and there\u2019s another little alien inside? I like being that little alien observing from the inside. That helps me feel distance from everything going on around me.\n\nWhy do you need that distance?\n\nFans come up to me and say the most incredible, generous things. I understand that because I\u2019m a fan and feel connections to the artists who I love. But fans are also going to think stuff about me that I can\u2019t really digest. I need to feel some distance in order to have a more real perspective about who I am and what I do.\n\nI understand that your fans\u2019 feelings about you and your music might be incomprehensible, but do you have clarity about what your music makes you feel?\n\nI mean, I love my band. I remember hearing Carter play drums for the first time. He was in a fusion band in Charlottesville. It was a killer band, but my attention was all about him. Carter could never truly know how outrageous he is as a player. And LeRoi [Moore], my late sax player, is one of the unsung heroes of that instrument. He could play the most stunning, beautiful melody as I was singing and it wouldn\u2019t even partly get in the way of what I was doing vocally. I\u2019d hear him play at Miller\u2019s, this bar I worked at, and all I wanted to do was be his friend. So I insinuated myself into his life until I had the courage to play him a tape of music I\u2019d written. I played him that and I played Carter some of my music and then we said we\u2019d all play together. Stefan [Lessard] came to play bass with us \u2014 he was just a kid. And [violinist] Boyd [Tinsley] came along. I was so awed by these guys. I could never have imagined the sound that they gave me. It\u2019s overwhelming.\n\nHaving spent so much time in Charlottesville, how shocking was last year\u2019s riot?\n\nThe horribleness of it was shocking. And I think it changed the notion of what that town\u2019s image is. When I moved there in the mid-\u201980s, it felt like such an enlightened space. There was so much great art being made there, and so many different kinds of people all getting along \u2014 students and musicians. I was completely seduced by Charlottesville. It was a great place to have conversations, you know? I obviously knew there was a history of racial crime there, but that\u2019s America, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s a sad thing.\n\nWhat did growing up partly in South Africa mean for how you see American racial dynamics?\n\nComing from a blatantly hyperracist society to America made for some consistent surprises. In my mind, when I came back to America I was surprised at how often race came up, because having been in South Africa, I was looking forward to coming back to a country that seemed to have solved its racial problems. Obviously I was pretty na\u00efve.\n\nTo get back to the subject of the band: Things had to change after LeRoi passed. Now things have to change again because Boyd\u2019s not around. How difficult is that shift going to be?\n\nI have a deep love for Boyd, and he has to deal with his stuff. In many ways I\u2019m sure it would\u2019ve been a lot easier for him to just say, \u201cI\u2019m good. Let\u2019s go play.\u201d But you can\u2019t just throw yourself away, your wellness away, because you play violin in a band. It doesn\u2019t make any sense to do that.\n\nI follow what you\u2019re saying about why Boyd isn\u2019t around, but how anxious are you about how his absence will affect the music?\n\nI\u2019m used to turning to my right and seeing him going bananas \u2014 some days doing it better than other days. You know there\u2019s that idea of genius as something that, like, comes into a room through the window and into a person rather than lives in the person all the time? Sometimes I\u2019d hear Boyd and I\u2019d be like, Holy shit, you are good. Other times it\u2019d be like, Clearly today you left the window closed. But that\u2019s beside the point. We\u2019re all like that. I have terrible nights. The answer is that I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to be without him there.\n\nAnd are there plans for him to come back?\n\nI can\u2019t say, \u201cI can\u2019t wait till he comes back,\u201d because I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. But right now being away is better for him. Nobody is happy about this situation. Except that we\u2019re happy he can figure some stuff out. I hope he does. But I\u2019m going to miss having that whirling-dervish Adonis-Muppet over there on my right. I know the audience is, too. But we can\u2019t serve that desire.\n\nYou have to serve the human being on the end of that desire.\n\nDoing that is the only thing that makes sense.\n\nWhy did it take six years to make Come Tomorrow? That\u2019s the longest you\u2019ve gone between albums.\n\nIt was a bit of what I was saying earlier: I get disheartened thinking, Why am I doing this? What the hell does my career mean? I\u2019m grateful, but am I doing it for good reasons? And also, like I was saying, I was frustrated with the outcome of the last record. But I had some songs that I\u2019d worked on with Mark Batson \u2014 songs with LeRoi on them \u2014 that were never finished and sitting there on the shelf. Then I started a record with Rob Cavallo and I lost my steam with that. Then John Alag\u00eda and I were working together and finally I said to him, \u201cLet\u2019s get all the music that I made with Batson and Cavallo, and whatever it is you and I are doing, and see what we have.\u201d It was way too much stuff for one album, but we started to chisel away, all the while making new music, and here we are. The newest music on the record is only a few months old and the oldest is from 12 years ago. But I think it\u2019s quite an artistic record. It\u2019s got love songs to my children. Love songs to the planet. There are songs about lust. I think my wonder at the universe is on the record. It\u2019s got things that deal with death. It took a long time to make, but I feel good about the result.\n\nIf this is too difficult a territory let me know, but how much has the tragedy you\u2019ve dealt with in your life colored your feelings about your success? The discomfort you\u2019ve talked about almost makes it sound as if you feel guilty about what you\u2019ve achieved. Is there any way in which the tragedy and the guilt are connected?\n\nIt\u2019s an interesting question, because I think about the injustice of things. I wonder why I\u2019ve been so fortunate when I\u2019m as undeserving as anybody. When I hear people that are excessively wealthy or excessively successful saying, \u201cWell, I\u2019ve worked for everything I have\u2026\u201d Hang on one second. What are you talking about? You think you\u2019re working harder than the guy who digs ditches for a living? Trade places with him for a week and then talk to me how hard you worked. Again, I\u2019m so grateful for what I have, but the amount I\u2019ve been rewarded does not square with my beliefs. It\u2019s hard to wrap my head around how perversely well-paid I am. But I do think in my actions \u2014 in going out and bringing people joy with music \u2014 that there\u2019s good purpose in what I do.\n\nPleasure isn\u2019t a small thing.\n\nYeah, I don\u2019t see what I do as nothing. I think there\u2019s importance to it. But I look at people in my family and I look at friends and I think, Why not them? What deception have I managed that has allowed me to get this far?\n\nI think you\u2019re being way too hard on yourself. Even if your success is luck, you\u2019re as entitled to that luck as anyone else. It doesn\u2019t have to be that you pulled a fast one.\n\nI suppose it takes just as much ego to say, \u201cI\u2019ve faked myself into this\u201d as it does to say, \u201cI\u2019m here because I\u2019m a badass.\u201d Maybe those are two sides of the same thing. But I do still think I\u2019m going to wake up one morning and everyone is going to be like, \u201cWe were wrong about you.\u201d And I\u2019d be like, \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to tell you that the whole time!\u201d\n\nDo you do therapy? You talk like you do therapy.\n\nMaybe it comes from the therapy I\u2019ve done, but I\u2019ve always looked hard at myself. The last therapist I went to was after a dear, dear friend passed. It was very unexpected and very traumatic, and I went to a therapist who dealt with trauma. I went and I talked at her for about an hour. She asked a couple questions and when it was done she said, \u201cWell, you can decide whether or not you want to come back here, but I think you\u2019re doing okay.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a good therapist.\n\nThat\u2019s an honest therapist: She wasn\u2019t going to get a penny out of me! But yeah, I don\u2019t want to lose perspective. I guess, in a way, sitting here with you and talking is about getting perspective. Believe me, I know how lucky I am but you want to feel like you have an honest sense of who you are and I worry about getting lost in the fantasy celebrity world. So I find it comforting when I can convince myself \u2014 repeatedly \u2014 that any attention or acclaim I\u2019ve gotten should be taken with a grain of salt.\n\nWhat\u2019s the most satisfying thing about being in the Dave Matthews Band in 2018?\n\nWhen I play music with Carter and the guys, I do have to remind myself that there is nobody else in the world having the experience that I\u2019m having. The incredible level of unspoken musical communication that we have \u2014 and the ease of it \u2014 is amazing. I\u2019m still surprised by how many people have embraced us and what the business of the band has become, but at the core of it is a very honest creative event. The excitement of that is undeniable. It\u2019s something I can still feel in my heart. It\u2019s magical.\n\nThis is a stupid random question: Do you ever run into people who think you wrote \u201cAll Along the Watchtower?\u201d\n\n[Laughs.] I\u2019m sure some people do think that, but I\u2019ll give you a different answer: The band\u2019s version of the song is something that evolved from when I was busking in Amsterdam. I would just play that song in a circle, over and over. I wouldn\u2019t stop. I would keep doing it and doing it and I\u2019d change little parts. It\u2019s one of those songs everyone knows and usually they go a little bit Hendrix or a little bit Dylan \u2014 I think I\u2019d also heard Michael Hedges\u2019s cover and may have tried to embrace some of what he did. But I remember Zac Brown was opening for us and I asked him, \u201cWill you come up and sing it with me?\u201d And he sat in and sang \u201cWatchtower\u201d and it hit me: \u201cHe\u2019s doing my version!\u201d\n\nLike he\u2019d learned it from you and not from Hendrix or Dylan?\n\nYeah, that was my roundabout way of answering your question. I remember something similar happened when I covered \u201cWild Horses.\u201d A girl shouted from the audience: \u201cI love the Sundays.\u201d And I said, \u201cIt\u2019s also by the Rolling Stones.\u201d I hope I wasn\u2019t too snide.\n\nWhat are listening to you lately?\n\nI hate to \u2014 no, I don\u2019t hate to admit it.\n\nAdmit what?\n\nI can\u2019t stop listening to the album Fragile by Yes.\n\nAre you kidding me?\n\nI can\u2019t stop.\n\nYou\u2019re talking to a Yes fanatic.\n\n[Laughs.] I\u2019m glad. I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s that one album, but I\u2019m just like, \u201cGood God.\u201d I\u2019ll be sitting somewhere and that music will pop into my head and then I have to go put the album on.\n\nI know exactly what you mean. Close to the Edge is the better album, but yeah, Fragile is a mind-blower.\n\nI should try Close to the Edge, right? I just keep coming back to Fragile. A friend of mine was playing me a few tracks from the new N.E.R.D album, and it was great. Then I said, \u201cLet me play you this.\u201d I played him Fragile and after he goes, \u201cFuck man. You win.\u201d\n\nWhen you picture your life without the Dave Matthews Band, what does it look like?\n\nI like to imagine myself strolling around with an unkempt beard and painting pictures, maybe writing music for other reasons. I fantasize about those things, because even though I do what I do for a living, I\u2019m quite quiet and reserved as a person. It\u2019s like there\u2019s nighttime me and daytime me: Nighttime me is Dave, who I don\u2019t really like very much, and David is the other me, the one my mother gave birth to. The two conflict, because the greatest things I\u2019ve managed in my life have actually been done in the calmer situations.\n\nCan you tell me about one of those situations?\n\nI remember being in the studio with Batson. Some friends were there, too, and, man, they were playing the music loud and having fun. But I left and I went into this little isolation booth and wrote what I think is one of the best songs I\u2019ve written, which is a song called \u201cSister.\u201d It\u2019s about my love of my little sister; a genuine thank-you to the universe for making someone who knows me so well. After I wrote it I went back to the party in the studio and said, \u201cDo you guys mind if you record this song I\u2019ve got?\u201d And I sang that little song about my sister. After, it was dead silence. Then Batson said, \u201cDamn. That shit was gangster.\u201d And I was like, \u201cThat\u2019s a very nice thing to say. [Laughs.] I think that was pretty gangster, too.\u201d\n\nDo you see a finish line for what you do at the scale at which you\u2019re doing it?\n\nAt this point in my life, I don\u2019t see dancing on a stage forever. \u201cDancing\u201d is too strong a word for what I do. I shake up and down sort of in correspondence to the music while my head sticks out awkwardly. It seems unimaginable that I would do that endlessly. When I look at someone like Neil Young, he\u2019s like Thor. He\u2019s slaying monsters with his guitar. It\u2019s unimaginable that he would ever stop playing music. But for me, no, I can\u2019t see doing this forever \u2014 and not because I\u2019m ungrateful.\n\nBut because you have other things to do?\n\nFor a lot of other people the greatest things I\u2019ve done in my life have been when I was hopping up and down onstage and singing. Those people are just as valid as I am in deciding what\u2019s real. I accept that. But, like I said, those very quiet moments of creating things are for me \u2014 for me \u2014 the most meaningful.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed from two conversations.\n\nAnnotations by Matt Stieb.\n\n\ufeffGrooming Natasha Smee for Exclusive Artists using American English Vegan Haircare.", "description": "Dave Matthews talks about the new Dave Matthews Band album \u2018Come Tomorrow,\u2019 his fans\u2019 desires, his own self-doubt, and seeing \u2018Crash Into Me\u2019 used in \u2018Lady Bird.\u2019", "authors": ["David Marchese", "Photograph By"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/05/11/11-dave-matthews-feed.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2018-05-14"}
