This included cancers related to HIV infections or smoking.\n\nWhy? Sung says while there are multiple factors involved, the obesity epidemic is happening because...\n\n\"[The] food environment we are living in promotes over-consumption of energy-dense, high-sugar/nutrient-poor foods that are pervasive and much more affordable and available to all.\"\n\n\"Furthermore, physical activity has been 'engineered' out of [our] lifestyle due to energy saving technologies, such as via the use of cars instead of bicycles.\"\n\nWhat's next: Three main steps need to be taken, Sung says.\n\nPeople need to adopt healthy lifestyles at younger ages. \"Early lifetime exposure matters,\" she says. Physicians need to increase obesity screening and counseling. \"Less than half of primary care physicians regularly assess for body mass index despite national screening recommendation,\" Sung says. Policymakers should broadly implement regulatory interventions like \"restrictions on advertising calorie-dense food and drinks, taxes on sugary drinks, [and] urban planning ... to promote physical activity\" through more sidewalks and bike lanes, Sung adds.\n\nGo deeper:\n\nEditor\u2019s note: The chart was corrected to show year-on-year percent increase from 1995 to 2014 (not percent increase over the time period).", "description": "But they have less risk for non-obesity related cancers, per a new study.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/XIya3dsBXhv9E8AGlpPZyOuTIZ8=/0x0:3200x1800/1920x1080/2019/02/03/1549199185703.png", "published_at": "2019-02-04"}
