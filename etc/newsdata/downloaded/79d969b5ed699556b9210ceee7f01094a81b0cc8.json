The Heritage Foundation\u2019s education policy analyst Mary Clare Amselem offered the following response:\n\n\n\n\u201cAmerican students deserve more pathways for higher learning that can help provide alternatives and additional choices to a traditional bachelor's degree, which is not always the best option for all students. This proposal provides a much-needed step in the right direction to correct some existing problems within the federal accreditation system, which severely limits career-based options for students.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to point out how these rules would protect institutional autonomy, particularly when it comes to a religious college or university\u2019s mission. Religious educational institutions have struggled to maintain their mission while complying with burdensome federal regulations to become accredited.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Heritage Foundation urges the Education Department to go further and address regional accreditation bodies that also have stifled innovation and competition.
