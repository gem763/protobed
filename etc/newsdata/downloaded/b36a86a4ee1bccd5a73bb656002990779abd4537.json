But so can hidden bank fees and poor exchange rates.\u2019\n\nHolidaymakers should first check whether their credit and debit cards can be used abroad for spending and withdrawing money from ATMs without extra charges.\n\nGet the best deal: Where to for holiday money in a hurry\n\nNationwide Building Society FlexPlus customers can use their debit cards to spend and withdraw cash fee-free while abroad.\n\nThe same goes for customers of Cumberland Building Society\u2019s Plus account and those of online account providers such as Monese, Monzo, Revolut, Starling and Transferwise.\n\nMetro Bank customers can also use their debit cards without charge in most European countries. All have better than average currency conversion rates.\n\nCustomers with credit cards such as Tandem, Halifax Clarity, Aqua Reward and Santander Zero can also rely on their plastic while abroad.\n\nFailing that, if a prepaid travel card is left over from a previous holiday, then top it up \u2013 it is likely to offer decent exchange rates and low or no fees for use.\n\nBusy times: Many families departing for an overseas half-term holiday over the coming days will face a last-minute dash for cash\n\nPrepaid currency cards can be snapped up instantly from convenient locations. The cards are separate from a bank account, can be topped up online, and the good ones can be used fee-free abroad. Larger Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda stores that have foreign exchange bureaux sell such cards.\n\nTravelex cards can also be picked up in person. Most of its stores are located at airports but once collected, the cards can be activated and registered over the internet \u2013 and money transferred on to them from a bank account at preferential online rates.\n\nThe Post Office also sells prepaid cards \u2013 but fees apply for cashpoint withdrawals on the Continent.\n\nPay online and collect in person\n\nThe primary goal for cash in hand currency is to beat airport rip-offs which many customers succumb to in a rush.\n\nAndrew Hagger, of financial research company MoneyComms, says: \u2018Plenty of providers offer a next-day currency delivery service which is free depending on how much you order.\u2019\n\nSainsbury\u2019s, Tesco, Asda and Debenhams all offer this for orders over \u00a3500.\n\n\u2018The other option is to drop in to your local supermarket,\u2019 adds Hagger. \u2018Many larger stores have a bureau and keep the main currencies in stock. Just remember to take photo ID with you when you go.\u2019\n\nIt is always worth buying online \u2013 even if collecting currency in person. This remains the case when departure is just hours away.\n\nWith Travelex, you can pick up euros, US dollars and prepaid cards from an airport branch just four hours after ordering online.\n\nLook ahead: The primary goal for cash in hand currency is to beat airport rip-offs which many customers succumb to in a rush\n\nWaiting until you get to the airport guarantees the worst rates because companies know you have no other options left. Peter Rudin-Burgess, of website CompareHolidayMoney, says: \u2018Most people are unaware that many big-name currency suppliers operate a two-tier system.\n\n\u2018So, if you walk into a post office to buy travel money you will get a worse rate than if you had ordered the currency on the Post Office website and then walked into the same branch to collect it.\u2019\n\nConsumer website TravelMoneyMax.com shows the best local rates.\n\nCompareHolidayMoney also has an interactive map of all the places where customers can order online and collect in person \u2013 covering supermarkets, department stores and chains as well as specialists.\n\nAnyone with time on their side can compare the best rates on cash in advance. They also have the opportunity to apply for the best credit or prepaid cards \u2013 which can take up to two weeks to arrive.\n\nOther prepaid cards worth considering include WeSwap, Caxton FX, Fair FX and ICE Clear.\n\nlaura.shannon@mailonsunday.co.uk", "description": "Holidaymakers should first check whether their credit and debit cards can be used abroad for spending and withdrawing money from ATMs without extra charges.", "authors": ["Laura Shannon For The Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
