Dettori has ridden the five-year old gelding before when he finished sixth to Blue Point in the King\u2019s Stand Stakes at Royal Ascot in June.\n\nImprimis starts in stall 3 in a race in which neither So Perfect nor Fairyland was declared to represent Aidan O\u2019Brien.\n\nThe Ballydoyle trainer, who has also pulled Magical out of the meeting, also did not enjoy the best of luck with Monday night\u2019s draw but will be pleased with the stall 5 berth for Derby winner Anthony Van Dyck in the Turf.\n\nO\u2019Brien\u2019s Mount Everest (4) and Charlie Appleby\u2019s Old Persian also run in the Turf.\n\nThere are six Europeans in the Mile with O\u2019Brien\u2019s Circus Maximus in stall 9.
