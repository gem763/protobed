One of these days they will probably get it right, but it\u2019s not today, it\u2019s not tomorrow, it\u2019s not next month.\"\n\nPolitico broke the most recent iteration of the story last week, citing three unnamed sources, who all denied his plans had anything to do with his involvement in Ukraine.\n\nA spokesperson denied the report at the time.\n\n\u201cWhile the beltway media has breathlessly reported on rumors of Secretary Perry's departure for months, he is still the Secretary of Energy and a proud member of President Trump\u2019s Cabinet,\u201d spokeswoman Shaylyn Haynes said in a statement. \u201cOne day the media will be right. Today is not that day.\u201d\n\nAxios reported on Saturday that Trump told House Republicans he made the July call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at Perry's request.\n\nPerry confirmed that he asked Trump to call Zelensky, but said it only concerned the country\u2019s developing energy sector\u2014not the Biden family.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely, I asked the president multiple times, \u2018Mr. President, we think it is in the United States\u2019 and in Ukraine\u2019s best interest that you and the president of Ukraine have conversations, that you discuss the options that are there,\u2019\u201d Perry said, recalling his conversations with Trump.", "description": ".10/08/2019 8:48:17AM EST.", "authors": ["Leah Barkoukis", "Beth Baumann", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/261/2167b930-b5cd-42c0-8a6b-6b4a7104644f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
