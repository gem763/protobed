Other reports say it was between 4.4 and 4.7, with the latter being confirmed by the National Geographic Institute.\n\nThose responding to the tweet have shared their experiences, with one person in Olvera, eight kilometres from the epicentre, saying: 'Sat on roof reading and could see terrace and building moving.'\n\nAnother in Montellano, 17 miles away from the source, said: 'Rattling, followed by a jerk, then tailed off with more rattling.'\n\nEmergency services took a string of calls but no damage has been reported and no-one has been injured (pictured: Malaga)\n\nA resident of Malaga tweeted: 'I think there has just been a #Terremoto, but it has been very slight. It's the first time I've noticed something like that in 32 years of life\n\nThe emergency services of Andalucia said just an hour ago that 112 had received 70 calls so far, including 31 from Cadiz, 23 from Seville, 14 from Malaga and before the 4.7 earthquake, other quakes had been felt.\n\nThey have stressed there is 'no cause for concern' and confirmed no reports of injuries or damage.\n\nThe 112 centre in Andalucia then posted the following statement on Facebook: 'EARTHQUAKE UPDATE. According to data from the National Geographic Institute (IGN), the earthquake has occurred at 11.35am today at a depth of five kilometres and epicenter northwest of Olvera.'\n\n'The tremor was initially located in the Sevillian municipality of Pruna with a magnitude of 4.7 degrees although the usual review of the calculations made by the IGN technicians has finally placed it in the province of C\u00e1diz. The town of Cadiz has recorded, since 05.26 hours today, other seismic movements of less intensity.'\n\nThe Junta de Andalucia also issued a 'keep calm' message which was echoed by the Andalusian Institute of Geophysics which described the quake as a 'microtremor' and part of a seismic swarm.\n\nA spokesman said energy was being released on a phased basis which was safer than having a build-up which could culminate in a big earthquake.", "description": "An earthquake measuring 4.7  on the Richter scale has hit the south-west area of Spain and has been felt in a number of the Costa del Sol tourist resorts, including Marbella and Malaga.", "authors": ["Rita Sobot For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/16/20184706-0-image-a-103_1572015843775.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
