Now it\u2019s watching, too.\n\nWith the new Nest Hub Max, a smart speaker with a screen, Google is adding an eye to its talking artificial intelligence. When I flash my palm at the device, a camera spots me and immediately pauses my music. Talk to the hand, robot!\n\nWhen I walk by a Hub Max, the Google Assistant greets me on its screen, \u201cGood afternoon, Geoffrey.\u201d\n\nThis wizardry is made possible by facial recognition. The $230 Nest Hub Max offers a glimpse of how this controversial tech might be used in our homes \u2014 if people aren\u2019t too turned off by the privacy implications.\n\n\n\nYou can make the Nest Hub Max play and pause music by waving your hand in front of its camera. (James Pace-Cornsilk/The Washington Post)\n\nLiving with Google\u2019s latest creation for a few days embodied the cognitive dissonance of being a gadget guy in 2019. You can appreciate the fun and wonder of new technology that you also know brings new concerns. I kept wondering: Do any of these camera functions make it worth bringing face surveillance inside my home? Despite some applaudable privacy protections from Google, my family never got to a yes.\n\n[Help Desk: Ask our tech columnist a question]\n\nThe Hub Max is a larger, 10-inch version of Google\u2019s popular Nest Hub countertop computer, which people (including me) use as a digital picture frame, speaker, kitchen TV and smart home controller. It\u2019s a solid upgrade for those functions, with a sharp screen and impressive sound for such a small box.\n\nBut it\u2019s the addition of a wide-angle camera that everyone will be talking about. When the smaller Hub debuted in 2018, Google crowed about how it didn\u2019t include one \u2014 unlike Facebook\u2019s poorly received Portal and Amazon\u2019s Echo Show, which raised eyebrows with a feature that lets you \u201cdrop in\u201d via camera any time on select friends. (Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\nThe Hub Max takes those camera controversies and says, \u201cHold my beer.\u201d Rival Amazon Alexa can recognize different people\u2019s voices, but not faces. What made Google think now was a good time to go there? It\u2019s a sign both that Google thinks it has better privacy protections \u2014 and that consumers are, incorrectly in my estimation, more trusting of Google than of other tech giants.\n\n\n\nThe Amazon Echo Show, left, and the Google Nest Hub Max both offer video-call capabilities. But Google\u2019s camera tries to do a lot more. (Geoffrey Fowler/The Washington Post)\n\nWhat do you get out of letting Google watch you through a Hub Max?\n\nFirst, the camera can be used for basic video calls. Say, \u201cOkay, Google, video-call James,\u201d and it connects via Google\u2019s Duo chat app on a phone, laptop or another Hub Max. Like the Facebook Portal, the Hub Max\u2019s wide-angle camera pans around to track your movements and tries to keep everyone\u2019s faces in the frame.\n\n[The spy in your wallet: Credit cards have a privacy problem]\n\nBut that\u2019s just the beginning of Google\u2019s camera story. If you opt in to the Hub Max\u2019s \u201cface match\u201d features, Google asks each family member to briefly scan his or her mug. Then the Hub Max\u2019s camera stays on, ambiently looking for those faces. When the Assistant finds one, it tailors the content on its screen. In the morning, it spotted me and proactively displayed a rundown of my day and commute \u2014 I never issued a command. You can also use it to leave reminders that pop up when the intended recipient passes by.\n\nUnderstanding context is one of the biggest challenges for computers, and Google\u2019s face technology opens interesting possibilities for personalization in shared spaces.\n\n\n\nWhen the Nest Hub Max sees a familiar face, it presents personalized information, such as this report on departure times for a train. (Geoffrey Fowler/The Washington Post)\n\nNext, the camera powers gesture commands. While it\u2019s looking for faces, the Hub Max is also keeping an eye out for your hands, which can serve as nonverbal, non-touchscreen commands \u2014 in other words, sign language. For now, these are limited to \u201cplay\u201d and \u201cpause\u201d music by flashing a palm, but Google says it\u2019s exploring more.\n\nFinally, the Hub Max can serve as a security camera, letting you peek in on a stream of what\u2019s going on at home. And like other Google Nest cameras, you can opt in to having the Hub Max send alerts when it identifies familiar faces. With this, you could always know exactly what time the kids got home \u2026 until they figure this out and unplug the darn thing.\n\n\n\nThe Nest Hub Max is always watching if you turn on its \u201ccamera sensing\u201d features. (Geoffrey Fowler/The Washington Post)\n\nIs all of that cool, or just creepy? The Hub Max reminded me, at times, of a baby HAL 9000 from \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey.\u201d The extra step of the Assistant knowing you\u2019re there even when you don\u2019t interact with it shifts the power balance in a subtle but important way.\n\nWhy should we trust Google with any of this? First, all of the camera sensing features are optional \u2014 you can still use the Hub Max with only your voice to play music and watch TV without turning the camera on. And Google Assistant has better default settings for voice privacy than Amazon\u2019s Alexa.\n\nGoogle also built some visual cues and controls for the camera. There\u2019s a physical button you can press to cut the camera. A green light turns on whenever the security camera is live broadcasting, though not while the other camera sensing features are running.\n\n\n\nA physical switch on the back of the Hub Max cuts off both the camera and microphone. You can deactivate just the camera in on-screen settings. (Geoffrey Fowler/The Washington Post)\n\nFor the face-matching functions, which require the camera to be always looking, Google borrowed a page from the Apple playbook. All the processing to match your face happens on the device itself. Those images are deleted immediately, and Google says it does not keep a record of when it identifies faces. (This is similar to how Face ID works on an iPhone \u2014 your face never leaves the iPhone.) Google has also pledged to \u201ckeep your video footage, audio recordings, and home environment sensor readings separate from advertising.\u201d\n\nAs a privacy guy, I\u2019m glad Google is taking those steps. Keeping face data local makes it less likely to be stolen or misused by police, marketers or data spies \u2014 if you trust Google to maintain its data standards and security precautions.\n\n[Goodbye, Chrome: Google\u2019s Web browser has become spy software]\n\nBut with Google, it\u2019s always important to ask what the company is getting out of the deal. Your face matches may stay on the Hub Max, but any interaction with the Assistant (like tapping on the screen or issuing a voice command) gets added to your Google profile, which can, by default, be used to target you with ads. The Hub Max also gets you to use more Google services, like YouTube, search and Duo, all of which also add to its valuable profile of you.\n\n\n\nA green light on the Nest Hub Max indicates when the camera is streaming as a security camera. But it doesn't turn on for the device's other camera sensing features. (James Pace-Cornsilk/The Washington Post)\n\nThe concerns only multiply from here. Today the face features are accessible only by Google, but what happens when it begins letting other apps and services access your face? Or when the tech also detects emotion in a face?\n\nUltimately, the Hub Max suffers from the same affliction as many new Google products: It\u2019s frighteningly advanced technology that hasn\u2019t identified the problem in our lives that needs solving. None of the camera functions the Hub Max offers today make it worth bringing surveillance inside my house.\n\nGoogle and all the other companies pushing face tech are going to have to keep working on uses that cross the chasm from creepy to can\u2019t-live-without-it.\n\nRead more from our Secret Life of Your Data series\n\nAlexa has been eavesdropping on you this whole time\n\nIt\u2019s the middle of the night.
