To receive the full newsletter in your inbox each week, sign up for it here.\n\nThis week:\n\nThe great Marvel vs. Marty debate.\n\nDouble the Paul Rudd, half the fun.\n\nJoker\u2019s reign of terror continues.\n\nLittle Women enters the Oscars race.\n\nImportant Mandy Moore update.\n\nTwo Paul Rudds Aren\u2019t Better Than One\n\nPeople have become so obsessed with the internet meme of Paul Rudd seemingly having not aged a day since he first made falling in love with your hot step-brother romantic in Clueless that it\u2019s easy to forget that, sometimes in the midst of not looking older, he acts. (As someone who has aged roughly 10 years in the last 24 months, I find this whole meme very offensive.)\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just when he\u2019s dabbles in ruining cinema as Ant-Man that he acts these days. Now he\u2019s on Netflix! The comedy series Living With Yourself premiered last week on the streaming service, boasting a premise that should ostensibly be a dream for fans of his work and eternal youth: He plays two characters. Well, one character twice.\n\nThe idea here is that Rudd is Miles Elliott, a once-promising writer who moves to the suburbs to start a family and sees his spirit crumble when that goal becomes complicated. A coworker, noticing the lights going out, recommends a magical spa, which Miles visits. It turns out that the spa\u2019s secret is that they clone you\u2014but only the best parts\u2014and discard the other, original body. A glitch, however, finds both versions of Miles very much alive, and suddenly the world is dealing with two Paul Rudds.\n\nRudd is excellent casting in this. His special Hollywood trick is that he\u2019s both the you that you are now\u2014relatable!\u2014and the aspirational version of yourself, the version of you that you wish you could be. Living With Yourself is the televised embodiment of that very sentence, with schlubby, Everyman Miles increasingly bitter about how slightly better\u2014thicker hair, better posture, more joie de vivre\u2014clone Miles is.\n\nIt\u2019s kind of like a Choose Your Own Paul Rudd Adventure. Do you like your Paul Rudd in Knocked Up, dadbod mode? Or do you prefer superhero Rudd? Living With Yourself\u2019s got both! It\u2019s also got...not much more than that.\n\nLiving With Yourself is a quick binge, and with enough twists to keep you rapt even as things get, well, pretty boring, actually. It\u2019s watchable, and borders on enjoyable, but is two clicks away from its potential to be actually great. Maybe a trip to the spa will fix that...\n\nJoker Keeps Scamming Your Money\n\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, the controversial Joker film starring Joaquin Phoenix is on track to be the highest grossing R-rated movie of all time. At the moment, it\u2019s taken in over $745 million, putting it well within reach of Deadpool\u2019s $783 million haul, the current record holder.\n\nThis is all, of course, not adjusted for inflation. When that math is done\u2014LOL, I\u2019m not going to do it!\u2014films like The Matrix Reloaded, It, and The Passion of the Christ still top Joker. Then again, there are some bullish predictions that Joker is on its way to $1 billion, in which case, sorry to Mel Gibson and Jesus!\n\nJoker \u2019s box office returns, however the math shakes out, are massive. Maybe Martin Scorsese really is onto something about cinema being dead.\n\nLittle Women Has Oscar Buzz!\n\nLittle Women had its first awards season screening this week, and according to social media reactions from those in attendance, praise Greta, it is good! Like Oscar-worthy good.\n\nIn case you haven\u2019t watched the trailer for the upcoming film 23 times (a week) like I have, Lady Bird writer-director Greta Gerwig is behind this latest adaptation of the Louisa May Alcott novel.\n\nSaorsie Ronan plays Jo March, and should, according to first reactions, receive her fourth Oscar nomination for her work. She is just 25, a fact which my therapist and I are already keenly aware of. Breakout Florence Pugh, who plays Amy March, is also getting tipped for the supporting actress race, which is an exciting change of pace from watching cult murders in the Swedish countryside in Midsommar.\n\nI haven\u2019t seen it yet\u2014a LA-only screening, rude!\u2014but am excited to see Gerwig thrust back into the Oscar spotlight. In fact, she joins A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood\u2019s Marielle Heller, The Farewell\u2019s Lulu Wang, and Hustlers\u2019 Lorene Scafaria as four women who should be major players in the notoriously male-dominated Best Director race.\n\nIt will be truly thrilling to see on a scale of zero to one, maybe, how many of them Academy voters will nominate!\n\nA Very Important Mandy Moore Update\n\nMandy Moore is on the front of the current issue of WebMD magazine, and I just thought you should know. We stan a self-diagnosing cover girl!\n\nWhat to watch this week:\n\nMrs. Fletcher: Kathryn Hahn is a goddess, and we\u2019re lucky that she acts for us.\n\nFrankie: Ira Sachs is an unbelievably heartfelt filmmaker, and we\u2019re lucky that he directs for us.\n\nThe Kominsky Method: I enjoy this show wayyyyyyy more than I ever expected to.\n\nBoJack Horseman: It\u2019s the last season, pay your respects.\n\nWhat to skip this week:\n\nThe Current War: Director\u2019s Cut: For a movie about the invention of electricity, you\u2019d think it\u2019d have more spark! Ba-da-dum!\n\nHalloween: I hate it.", "description": "Everything we can\u2019t stop loving, hating, and thinking about this week in pop culture.", "authors": ["Kevin Fallon", "Senior Entertainment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_655,w_1164,x_35,y_19/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1572110126/191024-Fallon-Obsessed-Fallon-embed-5_yxhbge", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
