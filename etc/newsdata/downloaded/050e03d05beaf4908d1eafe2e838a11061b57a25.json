She said that preparatory work and the subsequent pipelaying would start in the coming weeks, but it was not immediately clear how long it would take to complete the stretch.\n\nThe Danish Energy Agency (DEA) said in a statement that it had granted a permit to Nord Stream 2 to construct a 147-km (91-mile) section of the twin pipeline southeast of the Danish island Bornholm in the Baltic Sea.\n\nNord Stream 2 will have to wait another month before the permit can be used, according to Danish law, which gives parties the option to lodge complaints for up to four weeks after the decision, said the DEA.", "description": "The approval is the last major hurdle for the $11bn project, which will bolster gas flows from Siberia into Germany.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/30/681b14fc18934817ae1547da1c66837d_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
