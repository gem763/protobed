Trump is running for re-election.\n\n\u201cRecently, public reports have raised questions about any role you may have played in conveying or reinforcing the president\u2019s stark message to the Ukrainian president,\u201d Cummings, Schiff and Engel wrote in a letter to Pence.\n\nA spokeswoman for Pence said the broad nature of the request showed that it was not \u201cserious.\u201d\n\nSECURITY ASSISTANCE\n\nWhen Pence met with Zelenskiy, the two discussed the $250 million in security assistance that the U.S. Congress had approved but that the Trump administration had not disbursed.\n\nThe investigation could lead to the approval of articles of impeachment - or formal charges - against Trump in the House. A trial on whether to remove him from office would then be held in the U.S. Senate. Republicans who control the Senate have shown little appetite for ousting Trump.\n\nA cache of diplomatic texts Democrats received as part of their impeachment inquiry showed U.S. officials pressured the Ukrainian government to launch investigations that might benefit Trump\u2019s personal political agenda in exchange for a meeting of the two countries\u2019 leaders.\n\nKurt Volker, who resigned last week as Trump\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine, gave the messages to the House committees in a closed-door meeting on Thursday, and the chairmen released them later in the day.\n\nROMNEY PUSHES BACK\n\nTrump has said Biden and his son are \u201ccorrupt\u201d but has shown no evidence to back that up. The president on Thursday went a step further in his attacks on Biden when he called on China to investigate the former vice president and his son, who had business interests there.\n\nU.S. senator and former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney said on Friday it was \u201cwrong and appalling\u201d for Trump to push other nations to investigate Biden.\n\n\u201cWhen the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China\u2019s investigation is his political opponent in the midst of the Democratic nomination process, it strains credulity to suggest that it is anything other than politically motivated,\u201d Romney said on Twitter.\n\nTrump said on Friday he would not tie a much-anticipated trade deal with China to his desire for Beijing to investigate Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cOne thing has nothing to do with the other,\u201d he said.\n\nBiden leads in most opinion polls among the 19 Democrats seeking the party\u2019s nomination. His campaign has blasted Trump\u2019s efforts as desperate.\n\nIn a signal of how Kiev will handle investigations being watched in Washington, Ukrainian prosecutors said they would review 15 old probes related to Burisma\u2019s founder but added that they were unaware of any evidence of wrongdoing by Biden\u2019s son.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump responds to reporters questions as he heads to the Marine One helicopter to fly to visit injured members of the U.S. military at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Maryland from the White House in Washington, October 4, 2019.
