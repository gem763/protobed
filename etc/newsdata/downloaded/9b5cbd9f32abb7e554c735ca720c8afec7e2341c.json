REUTERS/Philimon Bulawayo\n\nMugabe, who had been receiving treatment in a Singapore hospital for months before he died on Friday aged 95, dominated Zimbabwe politics for almost four decades from independence in 1980 until he was removed by his own army in November 2017.\n\nRevered by many as a liberator who freed his people from white minority rule, he was vilified by others for wrecking one of Africa\u2019s most promising economies and ruthlessly crushing his opponents.\n\nAt the packed Sacred Heart Cathedral in downtown Harare, where Mugabe used to attend Catholic Mass with his first wife Sally and second wife Grace, congregants remembered him as a devout man who played a role in the church\u2019s upkeep.\n\nA plaque in the church commemorates Sally\u2019s death in 1992.\n\n\u201cWe are praying for our relatives who have died. Without forgetting to pray for our former president, Comrade Robert Mugabe, we bring him forward to God, we are asking God if there is anything that he did wrong in his life that he be forgiven,\u201d the priest told the congregation, speaking in the local Shona language.\n\nChris Sambo, a former soccer administrator who used to arrange matches for Mugabe in his home village of Kutama, said the southern African country\u2019s Catholic community had lost one of its most important members.\n\n\u201cTo me he was a father figure. We are so saddened. ... He was a very staunch Catholic,\u201d Sambo told Reuters.\n\nTsitsi Samukange, another churchgoer, said that when Mugabe attended mass with Grace, people could not park nearby for security reasons. She praised him as a resolute leader who fought for his country.\n\n\u201cAs our former president I think everyone can admit that without the work he did we would not be as independent as we are,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYou know when you fight, in a fight sometimes you lose your teeth, (right)? And we became poorer. But that\u2019s a fight and he did it, and we should give him that.\u201d\n\nMany in downtown Harare said at the weekend that they were saddened by Mugabe\u2019s death because of his central role in the struggle against colonial rule and because he had broadened access to education.\n\nBut his ousting in 2017 was accompanied by celebrations across the country of 13 million. His critics at home and abroad viewed him as a power-obsessed autocrat who unleashed death squads, rigged elections and ruined the economy to keep control.\n\nIt remained unclear on Sunday when and where Mugabe would be buried.\n\n(This story was refiled to tweak the headline, lede)", "description": "In the church where Zimbabwe's founder Robert Mugabe used to worship, people prayed on Sunday for him to be forgiven following his death two years after he was toppled in a coup.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190908&t=2&i=1427570058&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF870F1", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
