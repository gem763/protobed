That symbolizes the five demands of Hong Kong\u2019s protest movement for direct elections, amnesty for arrested demonstrators and other wishes.\n\nThe fate of his appeal was not immediately clear.\n\nChina\u2019s government has targeted an array of companies and the National Basketball Association for perceived support of the Hong Kong anti-government protests. Apple Inc. became the latest on Wednesday when the ruling Communist Party\u2019s main newspaper criticized the tech giant for a smartphone app on its App Store that allows activists to report police locations and use of tear gas.\n\nThe app, HKmap.live, \u201cfacilitates illegal behavior,\u201d the People\u2019s Daily said in a commentary. It warned that Apple might be damaging its reputation with Chinese consumers.\n\nApple didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nBeijing has pressed companies including Hong Kong\u2019s Cathay Pacific Airways to take the government\u2019s side against the protests, which are in their fourth month.\n\nChina\u2019s state broadcaster canceled broadcasts of NBA games after the general manager of one of its teams tweeted support for the protesters.\n\nLeung, the activist, emerged as one of the figureheads of protest in Hong Kong after 2014\u2019s failed nonviolent demonstrations over Beijing\u2019s decision to restrict elections.\n\nAmong supporters who gathered outside Wednesday\u2019s hearing was Kenny Lee, 23, who said Leung \u201chas inspired a lot of Hong Kong people, especially our young people.\u201d\n\nEven jailed, Leung\u2019s activism still resonates as Hong Kong is again gripped by protests that have snowballed since June.\n\n\u201cHe started spreading his idea a few years ago but at that time, not many people really understood him and some even criticized him,\u201d said J. Sze, a supporter in her twenties.\n\n\u201cNow, some people start to agree with his idea, maybe a little bit late,\u201d she said.\n\nLeung has been an advocate of independence for Hong Kong, which reverted from British to Chinese rule in 1997. He was sentenced in June 2018 for his role in a Feb. 8-9, 2016, outbreak of violence in the city\u2019s working-class Mong Kok district.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Hundreds of masked protesters yelling \"Revolution Now!\" crammed the sidewalk in front of Hong Kong's High Court and spilled onto the street in an impassioned show of support Wednesday for an activist appealing a six-year prison sentence for his part in a violent nightlong clash with police.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Alice Fung"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/09/hong_kong_protests_07165_c0-177-4237-2647_s1770x1032.jpg?4d770e57171926a73fdb9f9cedfaedc44dafe7da", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
