Last Thursday, the plane crashed 59 minutes after taking off from the eastern city of Goma bound for the capital Kinshasa. None of the eight people on board survived, officials said.\n\nThe passengers were identified as the personal chauffeur of Felix Tshisekedi, Congo\u2019s president, and three of his bodyguards. An armoured vehicle used by the president was also on board.\n\nA more troubling disclosure followed when two of the four-strong crew were identified. Vitaly Shumkov and Vladimir Sadovnichy, the plane\u2019s pilots, were not only Russian nationals, they both appeared to have a background in gun running.\n\nThe plane, too, has a murky past. EK-72903 was once owned by an Armenian company whose proprietor has been linked to arms smuggling elsewhere in Africa.", "description": "The Democratic Republic of Congo has one of the world\u2019s worst aviation safety records, so reports that an aircraft had tumbled into a remote forest last week caused few international ripples.", "authors": ["Olivia Acland", "Adrian Blomfield", "Africa Correspondent", "Allister Heath", "Sherelle Jacobs", "Stephen Bush"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/16/TELEMMGLPICT000210983887-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqaRL1kC4G7DT9ZsZm6Pe3PehAFAI_f6ud569StXyOKH0.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
