Months before the campus was finally taken over by a mob of angry students there were several similar attempts to take over public events by some of the same protesters.\n\nFundamental to these efforts was the idea of \u201csafe spaces.\u201d The prestigious University of Chicago had published a letter saying the school was not in favor of the idea of intellectual safe spaces for its students. Evergreen\u2019s President George Bridges wrote a piece for the Seattle Times in opposition to this idea titled \u201cWhy students need trigger warnings and safe places.\u201d Here\u2019s a sample:\n\nTHE University of Chicago\u2019s recent welcome to its incoming class wasn\u2019t welcoming. The message, conveyed in a letter from the dean of students, revealed a profound indifference to concerns that many students now bring to colleges and universities\u2026 The dean\u2019s letter gave notice that the university rejects the value of warning students about material in some classes, presentations or debates that may prove offensive or psychologically harmful (so-called \u201ctrigger warnings\u201d). The letter also informed new students that the university does not \u201ccondone the creation of intellectual \u2018safe spaces\u2019 where individuals can retreat from ideas and perspectives at odds with their own.\u201d Either the university is completely tone deaf to the academic and developmental needs of many students or is launching its own counterattack on what it perceives as an unwarranted assault of political correctness on campus. Or both\u2026 Ironically, the University of Chicago\u2019s welcoming message is, in itself, a trigger warning to students \u2014 the campus offers no safe spaces or warnings about potentially offensive or harmful content in its curricula or programs.\n\nGiven Bridges outlook, it\u2019s not at all surprising that when small groups of students began trying to take over public events, Bridges did little or nothing to stop them. That\u2019s him in the photo above leaning against a wall with his head down in submission after students seized the microphone during the dedication of a new building on campus. Bridges wanted to make his campus a safe space and if that meant complete disorder and disrespect for adults then so be it.\n\nHow extreme are the views being presented by Bridges and the student protesters? Just wait until the final minutes of this clip to see who filmmaker Benjamin Boyce offers as the voice of reason in this debate.
