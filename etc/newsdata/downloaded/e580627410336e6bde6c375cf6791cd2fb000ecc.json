There were no immediate indications Sunday that mental illness contributed to the shootings that killed 7 and injured 22 others in Texas, a state with one of the most lenient gun control laws.\n\nTrump also repeatedly marveled over Hurricane Dorian's size, incorrectly telling the public about its potential path and suggesting he's never heard of a \"category 5\" storm before. Dorian, in fact, is the fourth category 5 storm to happen under his watch.\n\nThe claims capped a week of distortion by Trump on various fronts, from the economy to Iran and North Korea.\n\nA review:\n\nHURRICANE DORIAN\n\nTRUMP: \"In addition to Florida - South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated.\" \u2014 tweet Sunday.\n\nTRUMP: \"The original course was dead into Florida. Now it seems to be going up toward South Carolina, toward North Carolina. Georgia's going to be hit. Alabama's going to get a piece of it, it looks like.\" \u2014 remarks to reporters Sunday.\n\nTHE FACTS: Trump goes astray in warning of trouble for Alabama, which is expected to be spared. As of Sunday, the National Hurricane Center forecast Dorian to be 40 to 50 miles (64 to 80 kilometers) off the Florida coast on Tuesday and Wednesday, with hurricane-force wind speeds extending about 35 miles (56 kilometers) to the west.\n\n\"Alabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian,\" tweeted the National Weather Service in Birmingham, Alabama. \"We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama. The system will remain too far east.\"\n\nFew, if any, meteorologists put Alabama in its path.\n\nAsked if Trump had been briefed about the impact to Alabama, Christopher Vaccaro, a spokesman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, wrote in an email: \"The current forecast path of Dorian does not include Alabama.\"\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \"I'm not sure that I've ever even heard of a category 5. I knew it existed and I've seen some category 4's. You don't even see them that much. But a category 5 is something that I don't know that I've ever even heard the term other than I know it's there.\" \u2014 remarks Sunday at FEMA headquarters.\n\nTHE FACTS: In his third hurricane season as president, Trump has had plenty of exposure to category 5 storms.\n\nHe made the same claim two years ago, saying he wasn't aware of category 5 storms until Hurricane Irma. \"In Florida, you got hit with the strongest winds ever recorded. It actually hit the Keys with a_it was a Category 5. I never even knew a Category 5 existed,\" Trump said in September 2017.\n\nSince then, he's repeatedly marveled about the size of the storms \u2014 and by extension, his administration's response to it \u2014 including category 5 hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017, Michael in 2018 and now Dorian.\n\nHaving four category 5 hurricanes in three years is actually more than any other president in history. George W. Bush had eight such hurricanes in eight years. Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan only had one during their two terms in office, while George H.W. Bush had two in four years and Carter had three in four years.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP, on hurricane aid: \"Will it ever end? Congress approved 92 Billion Dollars for Puerto Rico last year, an all time record of its kind for 'anywhere.'\" \u2014 tweet Tuesday.\n\nTRUMP, on Puerto Rico: \"Congress approved Billions of Dollars last time, more than anyplace else has ever gotten.\" \u2014 tweet Wednesday.\n\nTHE FACTS: His figure of $92 billion is wrong, as is his assertion that the U.S. territory has set some record for federal disaster aid. Congress has so far distributed only about $14 billion for Puerto Rico.\n\nIt's a false claim he's made repeatedly. The White House has said the estimate includes about $50 billion in expected future disaster disbursements that could span decades, along with $42.7 billion approved.\n\nThat $50 billion in additional money, however, is speculative. It is based on Puerto Rico's eligibility for federal emergency disaster funds for years ahead, involving calamities that haven't happened.", "description": "Facing another deadly mass shooting, President Donald Trump is deflecting on gun control.
