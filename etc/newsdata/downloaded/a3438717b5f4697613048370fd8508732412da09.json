While the cable news view is that a thinly veiled attack on the former vice president\u2019s age is wholly out of bounds, given Biden\u2019s age and frequent incoherence on the debate stage, it\u2019s an increasingly fair challenge. Castro\u2019s willingness to play attack dog could be a benefit in and of itself, but his real virtue is his immigration policy. \u201cI was the first candidate in early April to put forward an immigration plan. You know why? Because I\u2019m not afraid of Donald Trump on this issue. I\u2019m not going to backpedal. I\u2019m not going to pretend like I don\u2019t have my own vision for immigration,\u201d Castro said. Biden didn\u2019t take the bait when Castro went after the Obama administration\u2019s abysmal record on immigrant deportations. That may have spoiled Castro\u2019s attempt at a second viral moment on border issues, but he has still spent most of the primary pushing the leading candidates on immigration policy, and that alone is a valuable contribution.\n\nResults for the rest of the Democrats in the Houston debate were decidedly more mixed. Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg seemed content to draft off the front three, holding steady in the fourth and fifth spots current polling places them. Harris laughed easily (though often at her own jokes); Buttigieg seemed out of step almost from the start, apparently unsettled after Andrew Yang announced a $120,000 list-building raffle in his opening statement. Yang remains an awkward figure in the context of American politics, but the point of his campaign isn\u2019t really about fitting in. Instead, the wealthy venture capitalist and his supporters hope to elevate interest in the idea of universal basic income\u2014and Yang certainly did that by announcing an extension of his UBI pilot program in the opening minutes of the debate. Cory Booker has been Mr. Consistent across the three debates, delivering solid answers on multiple topics, and being particularly resonant on questions of racial justice. But he refuses to attack the other people on the stage (is he hoping for a brokered convention? is he keeping his V.P. hopes alive?), and that means he fades, more often than not, into the background. The fact that few people are talking about Amy Klobuchar today might be the best of possible reactions to her debate performance.\n\nStill, the most interesting parts of Thursday\u2019s debates came from candidates polling in the low single-digits. The DNC, clearly trying to avoid what happened to Republicans in 2016, has aggressively tried to winnow the field early. But winnowing the field also has the effect of narrowing the debate. Pushing O\u2019Rourke and Castro aside means pushing aside some of the best ideas on gun control and immigration policy. Rather than worrying about too many candidates or positions, Democrats should celebrate the diversity. Limiting the debates to the middle of stage could also mean pushing the energy and excitement off to the side.", "description": "While most attention was focused on Biden, Warren, and Sanders,  candidates at the ends of the stage brought big energy\u2014and big ideas.", "authors": ["Alex Shephard"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/cbb919567451f2697d96218fc2d362c8dba282c0.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
