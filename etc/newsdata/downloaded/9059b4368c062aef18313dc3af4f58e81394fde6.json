The qualifying period for this conviction was one of 15 years.\n\nBarnes was released from that sentence in September 2016 but was recalled to prison for breaching his licensing conditions for after being caught with an internet-enabled phone.\n\nMr Dawson said: \u2018On his release on March 3 this year he was to hand back the phone that had led to his recall.\n\n\u2018When released he is required to notify within three days various requirements.\n\nHe declared an email address, a mobile phone, a NatWest account, a change of address and the purchase of a vehicle.\u2019\n\nBut Barnes he did not tell police about a Blackberry phone where he concealed details of contacts.\n\nPolice found him using two unregistered phones which he used 4,000 times in a four to five-month period.\n\nHe has amassed 27 convictions for offences including \u2018inciting the murder of servicemen in foreign conflicts and where he glorified the murder of Lee Rigby,\u2019 said Mr Dawson.\n\n\u2018He was stopped on 30 August by police in another vehicle he did not declare.

McFarlane of Walthamstow, east London, whose real name is Ricardo Langaigne pleaded guilty to affray, and has previous convictions for criminal damage for painting over advertisements of women in the street\n\n\u2018There is just a long history of deliberate disregard for court orders. It is quite clear that his lack of notification is deliberate. It is repeated and it is ongoing.\u2019\n\nThe religious vigilante group\u2019s activities were exposed on YouTube where they dubbed women as \u2018slags\u2019 and used a megaphone to scream \u2018kill the non-believers\u2019 at innocent bystanders.\n\nTwo victims, Joshua Bilton and Anna Reddiford, were told to stop holding hands by Horner and Barnes as they walked down the street in Bethnal Green, east London.\n\nHorner yelled through a megaphone: \u2018Let go of each other\u2019s hands. This is a Muslim area!\u2019\n\nIn a second incident, on January 6 last year Horner and MacFarlane attacked a group of men drinking in the streets of Shoreditch, east London.\n\nThey screamed \u2018kill the non-believers\u2019 as Horner punched James Forward in the jaw and knocked out Patrick Kavanagh with a punch to the head.\n\nA week later on January 13 Horner and Barnes confronted another couple, Clare Coyle and Robert Gray, walking in the street in Stepney, east London.\n\nThe 28-year-old accused Miss Coyle of dressing inappropriately in a Muslim area and that she would be punished in \u2018hell fire\u2019.\n\nHorner then started filming the event on his mobile phone and branded Clare Coyle a \u2018slag\u2019, leading to her insisting: \u2018This is Great Britain. I can dress how I wish.\u2019\n\nIn the video, which was later uploaded on to YouTube, the group can be heard shouting: \u2018You need to control this area and forbid people from exposing themselves outside the mosque.\n\n\u2018Remove yourselves now. Muslim Patrol. Move away from the mosque. Don\u2019t come back. We don\u2019t respect those who disrespect God.\u2019\n\nIn December 2013, Judge Rebecca Poulet QC jailed Horner for 68 weeks, MacFarlane for 12 months, and Barnes for 24 weeks.\n\nHorner of Walthamstow, east London, pleaded guilty to two charges of assault and two charges of using threatening words and behaviour.\n\nHe was also jailed for six weeks in July last year for beating up a photographer and causing \u00a33,000 of damage to a car in an attack in Walthamstow, east London.\n\nMcFarlane from Walthamstow, east London, whose real name is Ricardo Langaigne pleaded guilty to affray, and has previous convictions for criminal damage for painting over advertisements of women in the street.\n\nBarnes, admitted two counts of using threatening words and behaviour, and has previous convictions for theft and handling stolen goods prior his conversion to Islam and also for using threatening words and behaviour on April 2012.\n\nHe admitted the seven counts of failing to comply with notification requirements under counter terrorism act 2008 at Westminster Magistrates\u2019 court on 25 September this year\n\nBarnes will be sentenced on Monday 7 October.", "description": "Royal Barnes, 29, of Hackney, east London, was a member of a self-styled 'Muslim Patrol' who tried to enforce Sharia law in east London.
