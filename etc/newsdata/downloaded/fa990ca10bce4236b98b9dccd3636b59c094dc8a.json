However, analysts are bullish that a new direct purchase program for consumers, Shop Your Looks, will keep Amazon.com Inc. at bay.\n\nShop Your Looks allows consumers to buy items directly from the site. Normally, shoppers are given the option to purchase items that are sent to them through the styling program, which chooses items based on a customer\u2019s preferences.\n\n\u201c[U]nlike most e-commerce offerings which choose to show every available product to every visitor, what\u2019s unique about Shop Your Looks is that it\u2019s hypercurated and personalized to every client,\u201d said Chief Executive Katrina Lake on the earnings call, according to a FactSet transcript.\n\nWatch: Here are 3 tips for picking retail stocks\n\n\u201cThe feature is based on items that clients have already purchased from us, but also presents a personalized subset of algorithmically generated items delivered to clients in the form of shoppable styling recommendations for pieces already in their closet.\u201d\n\nAfter an eight-week test with a portion of the company\u2019s women clients, about 60% bought two or more items.\n\n\u201cWe believe these early results suggest that these purchases are incremental, though do admit cannibalization is a key risk in this endeavor,\u201d wrote SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analysts in a note.\n\nDespite the risk, analysts think the program can be \u201cmostly accretive\u201d in time. Moreover, and perhaps more importantly, the program gives Stitch Fix SFIX, +4.33% one more way to avoid the \u201cAmazon AMZN, +0.65% effect.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe also believe this type of model could be hard for Amazon to replicate, given its current view on selection of the more the better,\u201d analysts said.\n\nRead: Walmart takes on Amazon in India with enhancements to Flipkart's \u2018Big Billion Days\u2019\n\nSunTrust Robinson Humphrey rates Stitch Fix stock buy with a $36 price target, down from $44.\n\nKeyBanc Capital Markets analysts also think the program and similar direct-buy programs like \u201cShop New Colors,\u201d which allows customers to buy new colors and patterns of previously-purchased items, could drive growth.\n\n\u201cThis data-driven approach will give customers a significantly larger assortment to select from (as opposed to the traditional five-item Fix) in what we view as a highly-curated manner,\u201d analysts said.\n\nKeyBanc rates Stitch Fix stock overweight, but cut its price target to $34 from $40.\n\nSee: How to know which retailers will take the biggest hit from a trade war\n\nOn the topic of tariffs, Stifel analysts point out that Stitch Fix has been shifting its supply chain away from China in order to lessen the impact.\n\n\u201cManagement has expressed confidence in their ability to look at pricing options and pass a portion of tariff-related costs through in ways that are not very impactful, should they be necessary,\u201d analysts said.\n\nExecutives say tariffs have been included in the company\u2019s guidance, which is for first-quarter revenue in the range of $438 to $442 million. The FactSet outlook is for revenue of $441.1 million.\n\nStifel rates Stitch Fix shares buy with a $28 price target.\n\nStitch Fix stock has gained 4.7% for the year to date while the Amplify Online Retail ETF IBUY, +1.23% is up 14% and the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.80% has gained 15.2% for the period.", "description": "Stitch Fix Inc. stock plummets after revenue that misses expectations; however, analysts are bullish that a new direct purchase program for consumers, Shop...", "authors": ["Tonya Garcia"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-FW735_stitch_MG_20171020145050.jpg"}
