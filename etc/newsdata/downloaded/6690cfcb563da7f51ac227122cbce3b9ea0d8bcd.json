It\u2019s difficult to win in Australia and to do it so comprehensively was a really proud moment in my coaching career.\n\n\u201cIt was wonderful to watch those young men take on that challenge successfully and have a great time doing it.\n\n\u201cThe win in India in 2012-13 was a highlight too, to overcome some great players in tough spinning conditions was a special victory.\n\n\u201cSo was the T20 World Cup win in 2010. The way we played our cricket, with such freedom and aggression, really was fun to be part of.\u201d\n\nAndy Flower, centre, led England to World T20 glory in 2010 (Rebecca Naden/PA)\n\nFlower\u2019s departure comes shortly after Chris Silverwood\u2019s appointment as England head coach.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really happy for Chris that he\u2019s getting the chance to lead England and I think he\u2019s going to do a great job,\u201d said Flower.\n\n\u201cI also want to wish Mo Bobat, the new performance director, all the best in his new role.\u201d\n\nManaging director Ashley Giles said: \u201cAndy moves on with every best wish from all of us at ECB for his outstanding contribution to the English game over the last 12 years.\n\n\u201cIt has been a pleasure working with Andy, who sets such high standards of professionalism and preparation for the teams he leads.
