And you should, but not too much more. People need to be sated, which is why phrases such as \u201cfull\u201d of joy and happiness exist.\n\nThis is especially the case when it comes to live music. If I go to a gig and there is no encore, I will be pissed off. I will give that band a poor review \u2013 if not professionally, then in my head. I don\u2019t think much tops the euphoria of an encore at the end of a fantastic gig: the feeling of everyone\u2019s needs being met at the same time \u2013 sort of like an orgy, but with (possibly) stickier floors; the ripples of anticipation through the crowd; the call from stomping feet, the unanimous cheer. You know it\u2019s coming, but we know that the sun sets every day, and that doesn\u2019t make it any less beautiful.\n\nConversely, is there a greater disappointment than your favourite song being missed off a setlist and then having it not appear in the encore? There is not. (Note: Duran Duran once did this with\u2026 actually, all of their hits, and their names are now on a list.)\n\nThe best encores happen at those gigs that acts have billed as their last ever. I\u2019m a huge Girls Aloud fan (their production team, Xenomania, is a genius outfit) and I went to their last ever gig in my home city of Liverpool. True, Sarah spent most of it looking furious and pulling out her earpiece, but their banging pop catalogue still built to an emotional send-off. A couple of years ago, the Maccabees, who provided the soundtrack to one of my formative love affairs, played out of their skins for a permanent goodbye at Alexandra Palace in London. I would defy anyone not to feel moved by the sight of thousands of people pogoing to a song about a swimming pool (Latchmere, in south London), before gulping down the finale, Pelican.\n\nIn praise of window seats | Hannah Jane Parkinson Read more\n\nFestival encores can be even more intense: at this year\u2019s Glastonbury, tens of thousands of people poorly rapping Stormzy lyrics back to him. Then there are the finales you wish you could have been at: Queen\u2019s last ever performance with Freddie Mercury at Knebworth in 1986, where they played their encores and then Freddie left the stage, wearing a crown, to the national anthem.\n\nOf course, gigs can go on too long. But for the most part, I would challenge anyone not to come away from a perfectly executed gig finale, streaming out of the gates and the rabbit warren of venue corridors, with a racing heart and a smile, exhilarated and inspired.", "description": "It\u2019s everyone\u2019s needs being met at the same time.
