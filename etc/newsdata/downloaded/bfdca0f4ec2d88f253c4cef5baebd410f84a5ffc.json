That\u2019s just their share of upfront premiums, and doesn\u2019t include co-payments, deductibles and other forms of cost-sharing once they need care.\n\nThe seemingly inexorable rise of costs has led to deep frustration with U.S. health care, prompting questions about whether a system where coverage is tied to a job can survive. As premiums and deductibles have increased in the last two decades, the percentage of workers covered has slipped as employers dropped coverage and some workers chose not to enroll. Fewer Americans under 65 had employer coverage in 2017 than in 1999, according to a separate Kaiser Family Foundation analysis of federal data. That\u2019s despite the fact that the U.S. economy employed 17 million more people in 2017 than in 1999.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve been seeing is a slow, slow kind of drip-drip erosion in employer coverage,\u201d Altman said.\n\nEmployees\u2019 costs for health care are rising more quickly than wages or overall economy-wide prices, and the working poor have been particularly hard-hit. In firms where more than 35% of employees earn less than $25,000 a year, workers would have to contribute more than $7,000 for a family health plan. It\u2019s an expense that Altman calls \u201cjust flat-out not affordable.\u201d Only one-third of employees at such firms are on their employer\u2019s health plans, compared with 63% at higher-wage firms, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s data.\n\nThe survey is based on responses from more than 2,000 randomly selected employers with at least three workers, including private firms and non-federal public employers.\n\nDeductibles are rising even faster than premiums, meaning that patients are on the hook for more of their medical costs upfront. For a single person, the average deductible in 2019 was $1,396, up from $533 in 2009. A typical household with employer health coverage spends about $800 a year in out-of-pocket costs, not counting premiums, according to research from the Commonwealth Fund. At the high end of the range, those costs can top $5,000 a year.\n\nWhile raising deductibles can moderate premiums, it also increases costs for people with an illness or who get hurt. \u201cCost-sharing is a tax on the sick,\u201d said Mark Fendrick, director of the Center for Value-Based Insurance Design at the University of Michigan.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, insurance plans must cover certain preventive services such as immunizations and annual wellness visits without patient cost-sharing. But patients still have to pay out-of-pocket for other essential care, such as medication for chronic conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure, until they meet their deductibles.\n\nMany Americans aren\u2019t prepared for the risks that deductibles transfer to patients. Almost 40% of adults can\u2019t pay an unexpected $400 expense without borrowing or selling an asset, according to a Federal Reserve survey from May.\n\nThat\u2019s a problem, Fendrick said. \u201cMy patient should not have to have a bake sale to afford her insulin,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter years of pushing health-care costs onto workers, some employers are pressing pause. Delta Air Lines Inc. recently froze employees\u2019 contributions to premiums for two years, Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian said in an interview at Bloomberg\u2019s headquarters in New York last week.\n\n\u201cWe said we\u2019re not going to raise them. We're going to absorb the cost because we need to make certain people know that their benefits structure is real important,\u201d Bastian said. He said the company\u2019s health-care costs are growing by double-digits. The Atlanta-based company has more than 80,000 employees around the globe.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The cost of family health coverage in the U.S. now tops $20,000,\u00a0an annual survey of employers found, a record high that has pushed an increasing number of American workers into plans that cover less or\u00a0cost more, or force them out of the insurance market entirely.\u201cIt\u2019s as much as buying", "authors": ["John Tozzi"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/FgkibKZ6vwfntdgceaD7RQ--~B/aD05NzY7dz0xMjk2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/9c7246126525ed3bbef49ec1246dad13", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
