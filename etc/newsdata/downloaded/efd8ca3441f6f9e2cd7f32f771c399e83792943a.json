That's really ridiculous. That's awful\".\n\nHundreds like Renard Oliver and his baby now have to get off the ferry from Freeport, Bahamas to Florida.

I think it was a business decision by Balearia to remove them, they were not ordered off the boat by any government entity.\"\n\nJust interviewed @CBPFlorida when we got off ferry in FL. They say they would have accepted and processed the Bahamians, and blame the ferry company Balearia. CBP says they tried to coordinate with Balearia but company \"made a business decision\" to take the evacuees off the boat. pic.twitter.com/ONkgdcJvS3 \u2014 Brian Entin (@BrianEntin) September 9, 2019\n\nIn an official statement, the agency said it was \"supporting the humanitarian mission... [and] continues to process the arrivals of passengers evacuating from the Bahamas according to established policy and procedures\".\n\nThe agency also highlighted that just the day before another cruise ship transported nearly 1,500 hurricane victims to Palm Beach, Florida without issue.\n\nBalearia did not immediately responded to a request for comment.\n\nHurricane Dorian struck the Bahamas last Sunday as a Category 5 storm, killing at least 46 people on the island nation.\n\nThe private efforts to take relief to #Abaco#Bahamas & adjacent cays is phenomenal.\n\n\n\nBut the large amount of diesel,medicine,water & food needed can\u2019t be delivered by private boats & planes.\n\n\n\nOnly the @DeptofDefense@USNorthernCmd has the heavy lift capability to deliver this. pic.twitter.com/sO2Gtosz5h\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) September 6, 2019\n\nHowever it is feared the final death toll may be far higher, with several areas left completely inaccessible to rescue teams.\n\nSeveral of Florida's state officials, including senator Marco Rubio, have called for urgent US assistance in the Bahamas.\n\nLast week Mr Rubio travelled to the region to survey the damage and requested that the United States Agency for International Development dispatch the USNS Comfort to deliver aid.", "description": "More than 100 people attempting to flee the devastation caused by Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas have been kicked off a ferry headed to Florida for not having a US visa.", "authors": ["Rozina Sabur"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_QabYFB5iK8jQ.i1qCP0rg--~B/aD0xNDA2O3c9MjI1MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/81ca9f14bc697580d518543f97a85d1b", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
