Ankara sees the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces as indistinguishable from Kurdish insurgents inside Turkey and views them as a serious security threat.\n\nKurdish forces have spearheaded the campaign against Islamic State in the region and are regarded as some of the west\u2019s most loyal and effective allies.\n\nWhat was initially a Kurdish force of ground troops with air and logistical support from a US-led coalition has expanded into an administration controlling 30% of Syria east of the Euphrates River. Kurdish-run north-east Syria is the largest part of the country outside the control of President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nCondemnation of Trump\u2019s announcement and the prospective Turkish invasion was near universal in the Commons, where the minister was responding to an urgent question brought by the Tory former defence minister Tobias Ellwood.\n\nEmily Thornberry, Labour\u2019s foreign affairs spokesperson, said Trump\u2019s decision would \u201copen the door to a Turkish invasion of Syria and the subjugation of the Kurdish people\u201d, who she said were \u201cthe very people who led the fight against Daesh [Islamic State]\u201d.\n\nThornberry asked why the US president felt able to say on Monday night that \u201cthe UK is very thrilled\u201d at his decision to withdraw US troops, pressing him on what Raab had told his counterpart in last night\u2019s phone call.\n\n\u201cNo idea where that came from,\u201d Murrison replied. \u201cIt certainly isn\u2019t based upon the conversation that my right honourable friend [Raab] had with Secretary of State Pompeo last night\u201d.\n\nThe minister later tried to downplay the effect of the US announcement, saying it involved only the withdrawal of 50 troops from the Syria-Turkey border, although Trump had repeatedly said his plan was to remove the 1,000 troops stationed in the Kurdish controlled part of Syria.\n\nLloyd Russell-Moyle, a Labour backbencher who chairs the all-party parliamentary group on north-east Syria, called on the UK \u201cto suspend sharing any intelligence information with Turkey so they can\u2019t use it against one of our allies\u201d and provide further support to the Kurdish military, the Syrian Democratic Forces.\n\nMurrison did not respond to Russell-Moyle\u2019s specific requests, but said the UK had previously supported the SDF in the fight against Isis. The minister also would not say if the UK had any plans to escalate the crisis by asking for the issue to be discussed at either the UN security council or the North Atlantic Council, which governs Nato.", "description": "Foreign secretary Dominic Raab complains about US decision to withdraw troops", "authors": ["Dan Sabbagh", "Simon Tisdall"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e25cbe1330834df29c2a3c0177a6461f353ef16/0_97_1836_1101/master/1836.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1cb53d78f87b640a6adc1ced30488400", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
