REUTERS/Mike Blake/Files\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc says the UK is seeking to classify the company as a transportation provider, potentially opening it up to new tax charges that could weigh heavily on its business, according to UK accounts filings in recent days.\n\nIt is the latest headache for the U.S. ride-hailing company, which is also facing regulatory problems in London, one of its largest markets.\n\nUber says it could be charged 20% VAT on gross booking fees - the amount passengers pay \u2014 or on service fees charged to drivers, typically about 20-30 percent of the fare.\n\nThe tax could eat into Uber\u2019s margins or force it to increase fares, making it less competitive against rivals, who have previously complained about Uber\u2019s non-payment of VAT.\n\nUber said the charges could apply \u201cboth retroactively and prospectively\u201d, risking a back tax claim that could run to hundreds of millions of pounds.\n\nUber said it believed the position of Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) \u201cin similar disputes and audits is without merit\u201d and is defending itself vigorously.\n\nCurrently, Uber is structured so that, for tax purposes, it exports digital services to UK-based drivers from a Dutch subsidiary, Uber BV. In future, HMRC could deem its UK operation to be the provider of a transportation service, thus exposing it to VAT.\n\nLast month, Uber received only a two-month London operating license, failing to secure a maximum five-year term in a battle with the regulator, which has previously stripped the company of its right to take rides.", "description": "Uber Technologies Inc says the UK is seeking to classify the company as a transportation provider, potentially opening it up to new tax charges that could weigh heavily on its business, according to UK accounts filings in recent days.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439642749&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A0UT", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
