Whatever do you have in mind?\n\nWhether you love Trump or loathe him, we should all agree that it would be high comedy watching the few remaining Trump-skeptic Republicans in the Senate forced to sweat it out on whether to vote to remove the president from office after he\u2019s been impeached.\n\nNEWS: Sen. Mitt Romney tells me Trump \u201cshould make available the whistleblower complaint that has been deemed to be credible and urgent. I think it'd be very helpful to get the bottom of the facts. If they don't, it will be up to the House to decide how to proceed.\u201d \u2014 Geoff Bennett (@GeoffRBennett) September 23, 2019\n\nTrump has said that he\u2019d consider releasing the transcript of his July phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president. He hasn\u2019t said (as far as I know) that he might release the complaint. Romney\u2019s pushing him here.\n\nWhether to vote to remove Trump for leaning on Ukraine on the Biden investigation is one question. Whether to vote to remove him for refusing to turn over a whistleblower complaint to Congress is an entirely different one. There are always separation-of-powers defenses when the two branches clash, and Trump would have an argument that his authority over foreign policy and national security means that Congress has no right to demand information from the executive branch about how he\u2019s performing his duties in both areas. Congress would counter that they have constitutional authority to police the president for the commission of high crimes and misdemeanors and therefore absolutely have the right to see a formal allegation of wrongdoing. Where would SCOTUS come down in that dispute?\n\nWith Congress, I think. Although they might require Pelosi to initiate some sort of formal impeachment proceeding first.\n\nElsewhere in the Senate today, the comedy of watching Senate Republicans try to duck questions about Trump and Ukraine is already under way. Six months ago, Ben Sasse would have lambasted the president for allegedly courting foreign interference in a U.S. election and using taxpayer money as leverage. Nowadays he\u2019s too focused on winning another six years in the Senate to have any deep thoughts about it. If you want answers, ask \u201cJames,\u201d whoever that is:\n\nA moment ago I asked @BenSasse about the whistleblower complaint, Trump\u2019s conversation w/ Ukrainian prez. \u201cI\u2019m not doing any interviews right now\u201d \u2013 he notes that he\u2019s on senate intel committee \u201cso we have our own briefings on these topics\u2026and we haven\u2019t gotten them all yet.\u201d \u2014 Elizabeth Landers (@ElizLanders) September 23, 2019\n\nI asked @BenSasse a second time if he had any concerns about the news reports circulating about the whistleblower complaint and Trump: \u201cYou\u2019re welcome to talk to James in my office.\u201d \u2014 Elizabeth Landers (@ElizLanders) September 23, 2019\n\nCNN tried to corral some Republicans into commenting, with limited success. Chuck Grassley told them that he\u2019d love to talk to the whistleblower, so maybe CNN could use its platform to encourage that person to come forward.\n\nSenate GOP, for most part, avoiding criticizing Trump over withholding whistleblower complaint, criticizing whistleblower and for bringing up Bidens in phone call with Ukranian president. Grassley, for one, told me he wants to talk to whistleblower but wouldn't criticize Trump pic.twitter.com/wf57lgRNbu \u2014 Manu Raju (@mkraju) September 23, 2019\n\nWhy should the whistleblower have to come forward, though? The whole point of having a formal legal whistleblower process is so that people can report misconduct to the DNI and, by extension, to Congress through a specified channel. The whistleblower used that channel. Grassley wants him to out himself anyway.\n\nSeems like Chuck\u2019s complaint here isn\u2019t, or shouldn\u2019t be, with the whistleblower but with the executive branch for refusing to share the allegations.\n\nIn fairness to Sasse and other Republicans, \u201cno comment until we have more facts\u201d is the prudent \u2014 and politically safe \u2014 way to go. But it gets us back to Romney\u2019s point. What are Senate Republicans prepared to do if Trump decides that he doesn\u2019t feel like supplying more facts? If the idea, per Romney and Grassley, is that Congress has the right to know of potential presidential wrongdoing, how far are they prepared to go if Trump counters that they have no such right?\n\nNational Review is out with an editorial about the Ukraine matter tonight. Trump was wrong to lean on Zelensky, they acknowledge, but impeachment isn\u2019t the remedy here. Next year\u2019s election is. Pelosi couldn\u2019t say it better herself!\n\n[W]hatever Joe and Hunter Biden\u2019s vulnerabilities might be, pursuing them is obviously not an appropriate goal of U.S. foreign policy. It\u2019d be even worse if Ukraine were presented with a quid pro quo, an investigation of Biden in exchange for U.S. defense aid\u2026 The way Democrats and the media now wish to proceed \u2014 starting with the public release of transcripts of conversations between Trump and foreign leaders \u2014 would set a perilous precedent. For the sake of American national security, it is vital that leaders communicate frankly and that their negotiations include the most sensitive matters. This can only happen if there is a reciprocal assurance of confidentiality. As for impeachment, if Democrats are intent on going down this road, it ought to lead to searching inquiry into the analogous behavior of past presidents. We would want to learn, for example, about the Obama administration\u2019s dealings with Kyiv in 2016, when a Ukrainian investigation involving Trump campaign official Paul Manafort was suddenly revived, and a leak of documents \u2014 sourced to a Ukrainian legislator tied to the Clinton campaign \u2014 resulted in Manafort\u2019s ouster as campaign chairman. We would also want to learn more about the investigation of alleged Trump\u2013Russia \u201ccollusion,\u201d which appears to have been encouraged by the Obama administration and whose origins are currently being probed by the Trump Justice Department.\n\nI know I\u2019ve said it numerous times today but I\u2019ll say it again: I don\u2019t think Trump will hand over the transcript or the whistleblower complaint. Whatever\u2019s in them, it\u2019s unlikely to be flattering to him. Handing them over would also undercut his \u201cbut he fights!\u201d image with the right. The safest play is to exert executive privilege and hope the public loses interest. Foreign policy rarely captures voters\u2019 imagination, especially foreign policy towards a country as obscure to the average American as Ukraine.\n\nHe\u2019d just better hope that the whistleblower doesn\u2019t come forward and/or that no one in the natsec bureaucracy leaks the document. But the odds of that are low: Natsec people love Trump, right?\n\nIn lieu of an exit question, here\u2019s Shep sounding extra Sheppy about all this today on Fox.", "description": "Soon.", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/m-4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
