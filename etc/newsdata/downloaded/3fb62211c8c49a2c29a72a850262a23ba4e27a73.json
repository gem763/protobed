Tesla has proven that there is a market for luxury EVs, and so Porsche is finally jumping into that fray with this new fastback sedan, which is slightly smaller than a Panamera and roughly the same length as a Tesla Model S. The Taycan will initially be offered in 750-horsepower Turbo S and 670-horsepower Turbo versions, both of which use a 93.0-kWh battery pack and an electric motor mounted in both the front and rear axles.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/TmkUQrk54tpGUNZ8DhYsGg--~B/aD0zMzYwO3c9NTA0MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/car_and_driver_581/90f918eccd6cb42bc565c0611644c223", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
