Limestone County sheriff's spokesman Stephen Young said the boy called 911 at about 11 p.m. Monday.\n\nHe met deputies on the driveway and told them he heard gunshots upstairs while he was in the basement and he ran out the door. The teen later confessed to being the one who pulled the trigger, Young said.\n\n\"Upon being confronted with some of the inconsistencies, he did admit to shooting the five family members. All five were family members and all five lived in the residence,\" Young said.\n\nCBS affiliate WIAT-TV reports that authorities identified the victims as the teenager's father, John Wayne Sisk, 38; his stepmother, Mary Sisk, 35; and three siblings -- a 6-year-old boy, 5-year-old girl and a 6-month-old boy.\n\nHe faces murder charges and is being held in a juvenile detention facility. Young said he could face adult charges, including capital murder.\n\nAuthorities didn't describe any possible motive. They did not release the teen's name because he is a juvenile.\n\nMembers of the congregation at Elkmont United Methodist Church hold hands at the conclusion of a prayer vigil, Tuesday, Sept. 3, 2019, in Elkmont, Ala.

The sheriff's office said the weapon was in the home illegally, but did not elaborate.\n\nThe slayings rocked the quiet community of Elkmont, a tiny town of 500 just northwest of Huntsville and not far from the Alabama-Tennessee border.\n\n\"This is a community that has a lot of healing to do right now,\" Young told reporters.\n\nMary Sisk Huntsville City Schools\n\nThe stepmother, Mary Sisk, worked as a special education teacher in Huntsville, according to her page on the school website.
