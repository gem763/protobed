One Senate Republican told the Washington Post that releasing the limited transcript of Trump\u2019s call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenksy ws a \u201chuge mistake.\u201d One former administration staffer told Politico that, due to the scandal, the remainder of Trump\u2019s legislative agenda \u201cprobably doesn\u2019t get done.\u201d Another prominent Republican told Vanity Fair that \u201cthis could unwind very fast, and I mean in days.\u201d\n\nThough there\u2019s turmoil under the surface, in public the GOP amidst Trump\u2019s impeachment inquiry is having a much quieter crisis, as Republicans weigh in with responses ranging from it \u201craises a number of important questions\u201d but we\u2019re not going to do anything, to \u201cBiden is the one who threatened Ukraine\u2019s aid, not Trump.\u201d And As the Party goes, so does its organ: According to a new report from Vanity Fair\u2019s Gabriel Sherman, Fox News is grappling with how to deal with Trump\u2019s worsening Ukraine scandal and the developing impeachment inquiry. On Thursday morning, Sean Hannity reportedly told friends that the whistle-blower\u2019s report is \u201creally bad,\u201d and that Fox Corp CEO Lachlan Murdoch is considering how to set up the network for its inevitable post-Trump future. But unlike the party at-large, the turbulance is being felt a little more publicly. As Sherman reports:\n\nFox has often taken a nothing-to-see-here approach to Trump scandals, but impeachment is a different animal. \u201cIt\u2019s management bedlam,\u201d a Fox staffer told me. \u201cThis massive thing happened, and no one knows how to cover it.\u201d The schism was evident this week as a feud erupted between afternoon anchor Shepard Smith and prime-time host Tucker Carlson. It started Tuesday when Fox legal analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano told Smith on-air that Trump committed a \u201ccrime\u201d by pressuring Ukraine\u2019s president to get dirt on Biden. That night, Carlson brought on former Trump lawyer Joe diGenova, who called Napolitano a \u201cfool\u201d for claiming Trump broke the law. Yesterday, Smith lashed back, calling Carlson \u201crepugnant\u201d for not defending Napolitano on air. (Trump himself is said to turn off Fox at 3 p.m., when Shep Smith airs.) Seeking to quell the internecine strife before it carried into a third day, Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott and president Jay Wallace communicated to Smith this morning to stop attacking Carlson, a person briefed on the conversation said. \u201cThey said if he does it again, he\u2019s off the air,\u201d the source said. (Fox News spokesperson Irena Briganti denied that management had any direct conversation with Smith).\n\nAnother gem from the report: Paul Ryan, who joined the Fox board a few months after his retirement, is among those at the network pushing for hosts to break with the president. \u201cPaul is embarrassed about Trump and now he has the power to do something about it,\u201d an executive close to Ryan said \u2014 as if he has more power to check Trump\u2019s authoritarian tendencies as a TV board member than he did as Speaker of the House.\n\nBut having an adverse relationship with holding the president accountable appears to be a theme among Republican lawmakers:", "description": "Fox News is reportedly grappling with Donald Trump\u2019s Ukraine scandal and impeachment inquiry.
