I\u2019m so fucking glad we got Osuna!\u201d\n\n\u201cOsuna\u201d refers to the Astros\u2019 newly acquired closer, Roberto Osuna, who joined the team this year after serving a 75-game suspension for allegedly assaulting the mother of his child. (The charges were dropped after the woman refused to testify.)\n\nTaubman\u2019s conduct was first detailed in a Sports Illustrated report on Monday that the Astros dismissed as \u201cmisleading and completely irresponsible.\u201d Team officials accused the sports news outlet of attempting \u201cto fabricate a story.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis comments had everything to do with the game situation that just occurred and nothing else,\u201d the statement added \u2015 a particularly confusing claim because even though the Astros won, Osuna had a terrible game.\n\nThe next day, however, the organization was forced to walk back its categorical denial after several eyewitnesses publicly confirmed the reporting.\n\n\u201cThe Astros called this [Sports Illustrated] report misleading,\u201d Houston Chronicle sports reporter Hunter Atkins said on Twitter. \u201cIt is not. I was there. Saw it. And I should\u2019ve said something sooner.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan confirm,\u201d added Yahoo Sports baseball reporter Hannah Keyser.\n\nIn the Astros\u2019 mea culpa statement, Taubman said he was sorry for his \u201cinappropriate language\u201d and \u201coverexuberance in support of a player,\u201d but asserted that any deeper reading of his remarks would be a misinterpretation.\n\nThat issue will now be addressed by MLB, a league that ignored domestic violence cases for 22 years under former Commissioner Bud Selig, but has paid increasingly more attention since current Commissioner Rob Manfred took over in 2015.\n\n\u201cDomestic violence is extraordinarily serious and everyone in baseball must use care to not engage in any behavior \u2014 whether intentional or not \u2014 that could be construed as minimizing the egregiousness of an act of domestic violence,\u201d the league said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cWe became aware of this incident through the Sports Illustrated article. The Astros have disputed Sports Illustrated\u2019s characterization of the incident. MLB will interview those involved before commenting further.\u201d\n\nThe Astros are scheduled to play Game 1 of the World Series on Tuesday night against the Washington Nationals.", "description": "Brandon Taubman reportedly taunted them with praise of Roberto Osuna, who sat out 75 games over domestic violence claims.", "authors": ["National Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5daf6a3b2100008821ad399d.jpeg?cache=plb4fc5yi9&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
