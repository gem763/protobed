While awaiting sentencing on that charge, he was accused of engaging in similar frauds, prompting his re-arrest and a second guilty plea in June of this year on another charge of wire fraud conspiracy.\n\n\u201cDefendant has done tremendous damage to a huge number of victims,\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Brown wrote in the court filing . Yohai \u201chas shown an almost unbelievable compulsion to defraud others, to the point that he could not stop even while awaiting this court\u2019s judgment on him in the first case, which strongly suggests that he will continue on his criminal path despite having been blessed with so many advantages.\u201d\n\n\u201cWorse, he seems to enjoy committing fraud and revels in cheating others out of their hard-earned money, as though he thought real work was only for patsies,\u201d Brown added.\n\nAmong those swindled by Yohai, prosecutors contend, was the award-winning actor Dustin Hoffman andGuy Aroch, a prominent photographer, who both invested millions in real estate deals with Yohai.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

The bank wound up lending $1 million, which it later sued to get back.\n\nThe related bank fraud charge was one of eight felonies the jury convicted Manafort of, although Yohai was not charged in the case. Manafort ultimately got a seven-and-half-year combined sentence on the tax and fraud charges he was found guilty of in Virginia, as well as two other charges he pleaded guilty to as part of a deal to avert a second trial in Washington on charges of being an unregistered foreign agent, money-laundering and obstruction of justice.\n\nWhile Yohai repeatedly sought to cooperate with Mueller\u2019s investigators, there\u2019s no indication they seriously considered using him as a witness. He was not called by either side at Manafort\u2019s trial.\n\nNevertheless, Yohai allegedly told men trying to sell a Los Angeles home that he\u2019d be traveling to Washington soon to aid Mueller\u2019s inquiry.\n\n\u201cDuring lunch, Yohai told [the men] that he \u2018turned state\u2019s evidence\u2019 on his father-in-law, Paul Manafort,\u201d FBI Special Agent Sherine Ebadi wrote. \u201cYohai made several statements \u2026 that he had to go to \u2018D.C.\u2019 to meet with the Special Counsel\u2019s Office or \u2018downtown\u2019 to meet with \u2018the f.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI know these statements to be false as I was the case agent for the Special Counsel\u2019s case against Manafort,\u201d Ebadi added.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear why or whether Yohai believed that claims of involvement in the Mueller probe would make him a more attractive participant in a business deal.\n\nWhy the Mueller team didn\u2019t exhibit much interest in Yohai despite his attempts to aid them is unclear, but he has a long history of drug abuse. Court records indicate that Yohai went into the costly Cottonwood drug rehab program in Arizona at the end of 2016.\n\nProsecutors contend that after leaving Cottonwood, Yohai scammed fellow addicts who paid to live at a \u201csober living\u201d home he set up in L.A. Yohai allegedly took a $5,000 security deposit from one such man and charged another $35,000 a month \u201cfor \u2018detox\u2019 care which [Yohai]could not and did not provide.\u201d\n\nYohai has admitted that he used cocaine and methamphetamine even while he was jailed earlier this year, after his bond was revoked when the second round of fraud charges emerged. Prosecutors say he got the drugs by arranging small payments from money his mother put into a jail account.\n\nSome of his conduct in the various frauds was bizarre even for a flimflam artist.\n\nYohai and Manafort\u2019s daughter Jessica married in 2013. She filed for divorce in 2017 and last year formally changed her last name from Manafort to Bond \u2014 her mother\u2019s maiden name.\n\nThe prosecutors\u2019 sentencing filing for Yohai says he tried to tamper with the testimony of witnesses against him via \u201ccoded\u201d phone calls with his ex-wife last October while he was in a county jail. Prosecutors say Yohai called Bond to inform her that one charge he was facing was for pawning expensive musical equipment that belonged to someone else, and that his associates should say that Yohai wound up with the gear in exchange for a security deposit.\n\nBond called back later to say Yohai\u2019s cohorts were trying to convince the owner of the gear to say that, the FBI\u2019s Ebadi wrote in a court filing. Bond has not been charged in the case.\n\nThe federal public defender in Los Angeles, Hilary Potashner, did not respond to a request for comment on the prosecution\u2019s filing. Under the terms of his plea deal, Yohai\u2019s right to appeal his sentence is sharply limited, unless the judge goes over 15 years.\n\nYohai faces a maximum possible sentence of 50 years in prison.\n\nProsecutors also noted that a 15-year sentence for Yohai would probably mean his serving less than 12 years because of \u201cgood time\u201d credits and credit for a prison drug treatment program.\n\n\u201cDefendant has never been to prison before, so it is at least possible that he would change during a lengthy sentence,\u201d Brown wrote. \u201cThe signs, however, are not good; so far in jail he has taken the money of his loved ones to buy drugs, obtained prison tattoos, and prevailed upon his associates to concoct a bogus defense for at least one charge.\u201d\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Andre Birotte is scheduled to sentence Yohai on Nov. 8.", "description": "Jeffrey Yohai pleaded guilty in February 2018 to conspiracy to commit bank wire fraud.", "authors": ["Josh Gerstein"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/bb/12/41b8126b4c7880ccc70b96d525ac/190916-manafort-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
