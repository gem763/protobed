(Photo: Square-Enix MD Goods, Twitter)\n\nWe live in a truly incredible time for action figures \u2014 whether you\u2019re wanting to spend a couple hundred bucks or even just twenty, you can get well articulated, highly detailed recreations of some of your favourite characters from all sorts of shows, movies, comics, and games. But it means we also get this: amazingly intentionally old toys.\n\nAt Tokyo Game Show this week, Square-Enix, purveyor of all things chocobos and Donald Duck as a master of black magicks, dazzled fans across the world with the latest look at Final Fantasy VII Remake, the multi-part, bold re-imagining of the JRPG icon of the \u201890s.\n\nIt looks beautiful, rendering beloved characters like Cloud, Tifa, Barrett, and Aerith with the power of modern gaming graphics in a level of fidelity they\u2019ve never been seen in before. Not even really in Advent Children, that CG movie that was bad except for that maybe two fight scenes and we shouldn\u2019t talk about it!\n\nBut anyway, they also had these action figures on display, where Cloud, Tifa, Barrett, Aerith and all their friends and foes from the original game look exactly like the blocky, polygonal chibi blobs they looked like outside of battle in the original PlayStation game.\n\nAnd I need them immediately.\n\nThere were no details about how and when fans either in or out of Japan will be able to get the figures \u2014 the accompanying placard implies they could even, much to the chagrin of my wallet, be blind-box items, with a mystery character teased for the set.\n\nBut I just... need to know how and when. I\u2019ll import, I\u2019ll do whatever. I need these chunky, blocky looking action figures on my desk, revelling in the majesty of the original Playstation\u2019s attempts to bend polygonal 3D gaming to its limited technological will. They only have blurry eyes for faces! There\u2019s enough sharp angles to send a mathematician into a headspin! They don\u2019t even have hands! And I love them. They\u2019re ugly and they\u2019re perfect.\n\nI never really understood the current fascination with retro action figures \u2014 why pay modern, premium pricing for a toy designed to look deliberately crappy? Turns out, I just need catering to my \u201890s kid childhood to realise what \u201880s kids have known for a while.", "description": "We live in a truly incredible time for action figures \u2014 whether you\u2019re wanting to spend a couple hundred bucks or even just twenty, you can get well articulated, highly detailed recreations of some of your favourite characters from all sorts of shows, movies, comics, and games.
