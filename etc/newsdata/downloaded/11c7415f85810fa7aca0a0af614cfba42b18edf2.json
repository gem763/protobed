She spoke to almost no one but her immediate family. She was afraid of crowds. She was lost in her own world, and the world very nearly lost her.\n\nBut thanks to the formal diagnosis of Asperger\u2019s syndrome coupled with high-functioning autism and obsessive compulsive disorder, the now-16-year-old Swede has become quite literally the poster child for the generation that will have to deal with the destruction of our planet. Once she started receiving multifaceted treatment, Thunberg was able to channel her anxiety into something we should all be concerned about: the health of the planet and the science behind apocalyptic warnings of its demise.\n\nIn October 2018, Thunberg started having anxiety-ridden 3 a.m. nightmares, but unlike before, they were not about her. The recurring nightmares were about the impact of global warming on the planet, according to the book, Scenes From the Heart, she wrote with her parents and sister Beata, who also suffers from many of the same emotional conditions.\n\nThis time, instead of holing up in her bedroom as she did before treatment, she decided that her anxiety about the climate needed to become everyone else's, too. One of the aspects of her complicated diagnosis is obsession. Her family says she just wouldn't let the idea go that the planet was burning up and there was ample science to prove it. She did not understand why no one was doing anything. She could not comprehend why adults and policy makers were ignoring the issue.\n\nShe started skipping school on Fridays to protest, all alone, on the steps of the Swedish Parliament in Stockholm where she grew up. Slowly\u2013and in some ways inexplicably\u2014the protests, which were dubbed Fridays for Future, caught on and soon she was joined by tens, then scores, then hundreds of Swedish children demanding that adults start paying attention to science when it comes to climate change.\n\nSoon, the girl who once would not leave her bedroom was traveling across Europe to draw her peers out of the classrooms and onto the streets for the sake of the environment. Since she began not even a year ago, the protests have been held in 100 cities by teen activists. Her intensity has become her secret weapon and her now-famous speeches at the World Economic Forum\u2019s annual meeting in Davos, in front of the British Parliament and at the United Nations\u2019 COP24 Climate Talks, landed her a nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize this year.\n\n\u201cYou have ignored us in the past, and you will ignore us again,\u201d she told the World Economic Forum in Davos. \u201cYou say you love your children above all else, and yet you are stealing their future in front of their very eyes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose who will be affected the hardest are already suffering the consequences,\u201d she scolded the British Parliament. \u201cBut their voices are not heard. Is my microphone on? Can you hear me?\u201d\n\nWhen she was invited to speak at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York to be held later this month, she was faced with a dilemma. Would she look like a hypocrite hopping on a jet, leaving the very carbon footprint she had won such acclaim railing against? Instead, she took a state-of-the art carbon-zero yacht called the Malizia II, and made the journey by sea.\n\nThe Malizia II is owned by German property developer Gerhard Senft. It was built as a high-tech racing craft that was designed to collect data for scientists studying rates of ocean acidification from carbon emissions. Senft offered use of the boat and crew when he heard Thunberg wanted to sail across the Atlantic to address the climate summit.\n\nIn the 14 days at sea, some of them in inclement weather, the crew didn't turn on the motor once. The Malizia II crew was led by Pierre Casiraghi, who happens to be the grandson of Monaco\u2019s Prince Rainier III and actress Grace Kelly. The yacht is kitted out with solar panels and hydro generators, meaning it is completely emission-free. But its spare design doesn't have a functioning toilet, shower or other amenities.\n\nNot everyone wants to hear Thunberg\u2019s message and there is a growing chorus of people who say she and her obsessive condition are being exploited for political purposes. Thunberg has been the object of cruel attacks from climate change deniers who have used her medical conditions against her. Arron Banks, a prominent British businessman who bankrolled the drive for Brexit, tweeted, \u201cFreak yachting accidents do happen in August.\u201d He later said the tweet was a joke, but he has not removed it from his feed. Far-right groups across Europe have chided her and her message, referring to the \"apocalyptic dread in her eyes\u201d and saying many other things far too cruel to repeat.\n\nThere is an argument to be made that climate deniers tend to be men and climate activists, with the exception of Al Gore, tend to be women, sparking debate whether there is a misogynistic element to the debate. A 2016 study in the Journal of Consumer Research,\u201cIs Eco-Friendly Unmanly? The Green-Feminine Stereotype and Its Effect on Sustainable Consumption,\u201d backs up the theory. \u201cMen may shun eco-friendly behavior because of what it conveys about their masculinity,\u201d the authors write. \u201cIt\u2019s not that men don\u2019t care about the environment. But they also tend to want to feel macho, and they worry that eco-friendly behaviors might brand them as feminine.\u201d\n\nThunberg\u2019s most vocal critics, it has to be said, are all men, but many of them actually go beyond misogyny and come very close to shaming her for her Asperger\u2019s.\n\nSteve Milloy, a former Trump staffer and full-time Thunberg obsessive, regularly tweets about the \u201cclimate puppet.\u201d He claims that the \u201cthe world laughs at this Greta charade,\u201d often posting pictures of the teenager in awkward poses.\n\nHer response has always been swift to her 1.4 million Twitter followers and 3.1 million followers on Instagram. \u201cI am indeed \u2018deeply disturbed\u2019 about the fact that these hate and conspiracy campaigns are allowed to go on and on and on just because we children communicate and act on the science,\u201d she tweeted in August. \u201cWhere are the adults?\u201d\n\nThunberg chronicled her journey to America by sea on her social media, but after each post is a usual barrage of hate, insults and cruelty of the kind you might expect on a playground. She reads them all, often commenting, but most often questioning why people just don't want to see the truth.\n\nWhen she neared Manhattan in late August after two weeks on the high seas, she was escorted into the harbor by a fleet of 17 boats representing the U.N.\u2019s sustainability development goals and hordes of teens who stood in the rain at 3 a.m. to cheer her to shore. Many will attend the Fridays for Future protest in New York City on September 20. Others just wanted to get a glimpse of their unlikely heroine. But one person she won\u2019t see when she is in the U.S. is President Donald Trump. She has not been invited to meet him, but if she is, she told her supporters that she would decline because she has \u201cnothing to say\u201d to those who don\u2019t believe the science.\n\n\u201cI usually ignore them,\u201d she said when asked recently what she would tell a climate change denier like Trump. \u201cI have nothing to say to them and they have nothing to say to me.\u201d\n\nShe added that, indeed, if she did meet the president or someone \u201clike him\u201d she would keep going back to the science. \u201cMany people think climate change is an opinion,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it's not an opinion, it's a fact.\u201d\n\nOn September 23, Thunberg will address the U.N. Climate Change Summit, quoting from her recent book No One Is Too Small to Make a Difference. She has held weekly Fridays for Future protests since her arrival in late August, inspiring hundreds of American teens to protest for policy changes. She has also inspired many of her peers to ignore the naysayers.\n\n\u201cWhen haters go after your looks and differences, it means they have nowhere left to go,\u201d she tweeted a few hours after she docked in New York. \u201cAnd then you know you\u2019re winning! I have Aspergers and that means I\u2019m sometimes a bit different from the norm. And - given the right circumstances- being different is a superpower.\u201d\n\nIndeed, in the case of this young Swedish climate-busting hero, it most certainly is.", "description": "Greta Thunberg was dying from depression and starvation when she had a nightmare about climate change that saved her life.
