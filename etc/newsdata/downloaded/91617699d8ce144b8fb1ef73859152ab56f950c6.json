But his lack of regular action at Liverpool appears to be counting against him.\n\nIn midfield, Harry Winks is pushing to replace Declan Rice, who missed Sunday's training session. The Football Association have not specified why Rice was forced to miss the final session before Monday night's clash in Sofia, but Sportsmail understands the West Ham star is suffering from a cold.\n\nSouthgate insisted on Sunday night that Rice is available for selection, but the fact he missed training means he is unlikely to play from the start with Winks primed to take his place.\n\nHarry Winks is pushing to take the spot of Declan Rice, who missed Sunday's training session\n\nThe England manager started with two holding midfielders - Rice and Jordan Henderson - against the Czechs while Mason Mount started in the No 10 role as Southgate deployed a 4-2-3-1 system.\n\nHowever, Southgate is set to revert back to a conventional three-man midfield on Monday as he switches to the 4-3-3 he has largely relied on for the Euro 2020 qualifying campaign.\n\nWinks and Henderson are likely to take two of those slots with Ross Barkley understood to be pushing Mount hard for the final berth.\n\nHarry Kane and Raheem Sterling should start in attack, with Marcus Rashford, who has started the previous two England internationals on the bench, pushing to replace Jadon Sancho.\n\nEngland players will urge each other to stay true to their passing principles on Monday night after going more direct in the closing stages in Prague. Southgate's men believe they were guilty of playing longer balls as they searched for a second goal. The issue is something the players have spoken about themselves over the weekend and are mindful of falling into a similar trap here in Sofia.", "description": "SAMI MOKBEL IN SOFIA:  The England boss is planning significant changes - as many as six - to the team that started the shock defeat in Prague and was also pondering an alteration in formation.", "authors": ["Sami Mokbel For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/21/19665710-0-image-a-154_1570999569435.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
