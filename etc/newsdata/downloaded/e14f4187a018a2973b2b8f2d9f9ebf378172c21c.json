He also signaled he would seek to address wider issues, like the intersection of the president\u2019s foreign policies and the Trump family\u2019s global financial interests. Mr. Schiff has become the Democrats\u2019 go-to articulator of the importance of core American values like the rule of law, election integrity, respect for human rights and anti-corruption \u2014 as well as broader foreign policy challenges like the rise of authoritarianism around the world.\n\nBut understand this: The role of the head of the House Intelligence Committee is not normally so high-profile. Traditionally, the chairman focuses on more mundane agency oversight topics \u2014 and does so not in front of TV cameras but in closed-door settings.\n\nThere is also an element of personality and style. Before the 2016 election, Mr. Schiff was a well-respected but relatively obscure member of Congress. In a 2018 California Sunday Magazine profile, he was described this way: \u201cDressed in a crisp blue suit and sensible dress shoes, he cultivates a cheerfully beleaguered demeanor. He speaks without notes and tells jokes the way a dad would if that dad had access to highly classified intelligence.\u201d\n\nHe has been called solid, reasonable and mild-mannered. Sometimes too much so. Even awkward at times. Even now, his Democratic colleagues in the House view him as the prosecutor he once was \u2014 not a political operator clawing his way to ever-greater heights of power. But for purposes of the investigation, clinical and focused is what is called for in the face of Mr. Trump\u2019s theatrics and distraction.\n\nBut Mr. Schiff has also shown that his patience has its limits and that he can be a very effective communicator. His characterization of President Trump\u2019s call with Mr. Zelensky as a \u201cclassic organized crime shakedown\u201d is easy for people to understand. His lengthier, more impassioned remarks \u2014 like his defense of his view that the Mueller report did not absolve the president of wrongdoing, after Mr. Trump and committee Republicans called for his resignation \u2014 showed a backbone that left Republicans quieted.\n\nMr. Schiff\u2019s status as a credible, effective communicator who can speak to Americans in ways that ring true may be the most important contribution he can make over the next few weeks and months.\n\nIt is becoming clearer every hour that the impeachment inquiry is not over whether Mr. Trump pressed a foreign power to investigate a political rival. He admitted to that conduct, released the call memo and even doubled down on camera on Thursday, saying of the Ukrainians, \u201cIf they were honest about it, they would start a major investigation into the Bidens\u201d and \u201cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens.\u201d", "description": "A clinical and focused approach is called for in the face of Trump\u2019s theatrics and distraction.", "authors": ["Margaret L.
