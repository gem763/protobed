But Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s decision to turn Liberal Senators into an independent block leaves him without that option.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s clearly a problem. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s an easy solution,\u201d said Ted Morton, an executive fellow at the University of Calgary and formerly a long-time cabinet minister in Alberta provincial politics.\n\n\u201cIf they can find a minister who is connected to Bay Street, to federal finance and can articulate the importance of the energy sector to the economy and Trudeau\u2019s commitment to following through on Trans Mountain, then that\u2019s the best they can do,\u201d Morton said.\n\nEven if Trudeau finds a minister who understands Bay Street and investments \u2014 and Bill Morneau would fit the description \u2014 the government still face a challenge in relating directly to the struggles of working people in the province, Morton said.\n\nWe\u2019re into our fifth year of a downturn and people are angry. Not just angry but scared. Ted Morton, executive fellow, University of Calgary, and former cabinet minister, Alberta\n\n\u201cWhat people are talking about are bankruptcies, layoffs, people defaulting on mortgages, car loans and the impact of that causing, frankly, divorce and breakup,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re into our fifth year of a downturn and people are angry. Not just angry but scared.\u201d\n\nAnother potential pick for natural resources minister is Winnipeg South Centre\u2019s Jim Carr, who held the position for part of Trudeau\u2019s first term before being appointed to another portfolio, University of Alberta associated professor of political science Jared Wesley said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d think they\u2019ve to tap someone from Manitoba before they would tap somebody from B.C. \u2014 given the dynamics,\u201d Wesley said.\n\nAlberta considers the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion to the West Coast a vital way to diversify its exports, but the project is controversial in B.C. where NDP, the Green Party and some Liberals opposed the project on the campaign trail.\n\n\n\nTrudeau\u2019s government purchased the Trans Mountain pipeline system and expansion project from Houston-based Kinder Morgan Inc. for $4.5 billion in 2018 when the Texas pipeline company threatened to pull out of the project.\n\nSome in the energy industry believe that investment is a signal the Liberals will commit to finishing the project.\n\nI think it would be completely irresponsible to spend taxpayers money on a pipeline then not move forward Tristan Goodman, president, EPAC\n\n\u201cI think it would be completely irresponsible to spend taxpayers money on a pipeline then not move forward,\u201d said Tristan Goodman, president of the Explorers and Producers Association of Canada, which represents small- to mid-sized oil and gas companies.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still cautiously optimistic they made a commitment to get that done,\u201d he said.\n\nThere is also mounting frustration in both provinces about equalization payments at a time when the energy sector is reeling and when most political parties have been either ambivalent or obstructive to new pipelines.\n\nAdding to the pressure, Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe called for a \u201cnew deal\u201d Tuesday between the province and the federal government, including a new equalization formula. Similarly, Alberta Premier Jason Kenney said he spoke to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and \u201cunderscored the deep frustration expressed by Albertans is very real.\u201d\n\nDan Tsubouchi, principal and chief market strategist with Calgary-based private equity firm SAF Group, said in an email investors quit the energy sector during a Liberal majority government and that trend could continue now.\n\n\u201cIf the status quo wasn\u2019t attracting capital, how can a minority that will see some gives (to coalition partners like the NDP, Bloc Quebecois or Green Party) be viewed as more attractive \u2013 it can\u2019t,\u201d Tsubouchi said.\n\n\u2022 Email: gmorgan@nationalpost.com | Twitter: geoffreymorgan", "description": "'If the status quo wasn\u2019t attracting capital, how can a minority that will see some gives (to coalition partners) be viewed as more attractive \u2013 it can\u2019t.'", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/sohi.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
