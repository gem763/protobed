T\u00fcv S\u00fcd declined to comment.\n\nIn July a Brazilian judge ordered Vale to pay compensation for all damages caused by the collapse of the dam, saying that that the company was responsible for fixing all the damages including the economic effects.\n\nThe same month, emails emerged that showed T\u00fcv S\u00fcd's own analysis of the dam initially failed to meet official requirements.\n\nRead more on the dam collapse:\n\nT\u00fcv S\u00fcd inspected the dam in the months before the collapse. It was a \"tailings\" dam - an embankment filled with waste product - and decades of waste from the nearby mine had been piled up and grassed over.\n\nTailings dams are vulnerable to \"liquefaction\", when, for various reasons, the solid material begins to act and move like a liquid, putting them at risk of becoming vulnerable to collapse.\n\nDocuments and internal emails seized by investigators show that T\u00fcv S\u00fcd employees knew for around a year that there was liquefaction at the dam.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Brazil's mining dams: A disaster waiting to happen?\n\nAlso in July, Brazil's Senate urged prosecutors to bring charges ranging from environmental damage to involuntary manslaughter against top managers at Vale at the time of the dam collapse.\n\nAt the time Vale insisted that senior company officials had not been aware of any \"imminent risks\" at the dam prior to its collapse.\n\nThere are also concerns that other dams may be at risk of collapse.", "description": "Police say mining giant Vale and German auditor T\u00fcv S\u00fcd used falsified documents to certify the dam.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07gnfpp.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
