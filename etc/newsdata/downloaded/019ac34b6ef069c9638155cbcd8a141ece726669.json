REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger\n\nThe Belgian club\u2019s coach Felice Mazzu said he had been impressed with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s approach in the 1-1 draw against the European champions at Old Trafford on Sunday.\n\n\u201cManchester United played a good game against Liverpool on Sunday. Their system with five in the back worked well,\u201d Mazzu told the pre-match media conference on Tuesday ahead of Genk\u2019s hosting of Liverpool in Group E on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIt was a good point for Liverpool even if Manchester United only played well in one half.\u201d\n\nGenk might consider the same approach, he suggested. \u201cThat is an option. You will see tomorrow what choice I have made,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nMazzu also suggested his approach might depend on whether Liverpool field Mohamed Salah, who did not play on Sunday.\n\n\u201cWhen Salah is not on the pitch, the movement of the strikers is a little different. I don\u2019t know if he will be there tomorrow, if he is injured or not, but his presence makes a difference.\u201d\n\nBut with or without him, Genk\u2019s coach said Liverpool remained formidable opponents. Asked what made the Reds so dangerous, he simply replied \u201cKlopp\u201d with a laugh.\n\n\u201cWe know they score easily, they\u2019ve got three, four strikers with a lot of speed.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing about them is they have lots of players with experience and maturity and a system and philosophy of a high press and wanting to be in the opponent\u2019s half all the time. We have to play attention to this.\u201d\n\nGenk were thrashed 6-2 by Salzburg in their opening group game last month but then held Napoli to a goalless draw at home at the start of October.\n\n\u201cMost important tomorrow for our team is believing we can achieve a good result,\u201d Mazzu said. \u201cWe did that against Napoli and that will also have to be against Liverpool. The will to want to play a good match must be there.\n\n\u201cWe have made a lot of progress in recent weeks. The players understand better how I want to play. Offensive football is important, but compact defending is too.\u201d", "description": "Racing Genk could look to copy some of the tactics that Manchester United employed on the weekend against Liverpool when they go up against Jurgen Klopp's team in the Champions League on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443768376&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L1AN", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
