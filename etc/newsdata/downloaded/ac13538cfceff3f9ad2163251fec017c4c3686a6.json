Please ask your parents if you really want to know\u2019?\u201d\n\nThirty protesters from Utah Eagle Forum and Pro-Life Utah occupied almost every public comment spot available after the president of Utah Eagle Forum, Gayle Ruzicka, found an educator guide instructing them how to handle students questions about sex.\n\nThe code reads: \u201cUtah educators may respond to spontaneous student questions for the purposes of providing accurate data or correcting inaccurate or misleading information or comments made by students in class regarding sex education.\u201d Their answers, it notes, must still abide by state law, which permits an \u201cabstinence-based\u201d sex education program.\n\nThe code does not allow teachers to advocate for \u201cpremarital or extramarital sexual activity\u201d or promote contraceptive devices and instead promote abstinence as the most effective way to prevent pregnancy.\n\nDespite the addition, one woman said the law would cause teachers to get into \u201cgrossly irresponsible\u201d conversations with students. Another said it could become \u201cinappropriate and potentially graphic.\u201d Many feared the discussion would become pro-abortion.\n\nThe protest follows a Salt Lake County Department of Health report showing sexually transmitted disease (STD) rates are rising in the county and leading the director to say the state\u2019s sex education isn\u2019t effective \u2014 which students need parental approval before participating.\n\n\u201cTeens need accurate, realistic and comprehensive STD education \u2014 whether that\u2019s at home, at school, at church or in another venue appropriate for the discussion,\u201d Director Gary Edwards said.\n\nHowever, parents don\u2019t want teachers answering the guides\u2019 suggested questions \u2014 such as \u201cwhat is masturbation?\u201d or \u201cWhat is oral and anal sex?\u201d \u2014 and call for educators to direct students to ask their parents instead.\n\n\u201cFor all of these years, parents have been opting their kids into sex education classes and not being told the truth of what\u2019s being discussed,\u201d Ms. Ruzicka said. \u201cMost parents don\u2019t want their children to be taught about these alternative sex practices.\u201d\n\nThe board members did not comment on the groups\u2019 concerns, so it is unclear whether any change will be brought by their protests.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
