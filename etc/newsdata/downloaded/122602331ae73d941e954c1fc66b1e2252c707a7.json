We teamed up with cosmetic dermatologist Dr Sam Bunting to find out what it is and why it\u2019s so important to have zinc oxide in your bathroom cabinet.\n\nWhat is zinc oxide?\n\nIn its most natural state zinc oxide is a white, powdery mineral used for plastic and various textiles and beauty products. It\u2019s one of the key ingredients in your sun cream.\n\nWhat are the benefits of zinc oxide vs. chemical suncreams?\n\nWhile zinc oxide creates a protective barrier and deflects UV rays off of your skin (both UVA and UVB), chemical SPF absorbs them before they can cause any harm. Chemical formulas can cause some irritation if you have sensitive skin, but they are virtually invisible. Physical SPFs have a reputation for being chalky, but it\u2019s worth trying out the newer formulas as they\u2019re much lighter.\n\nZinc oxide has also been shown to help reduce acne as it soothes skin and eases inflammation. It\u2019s usually included in nappy creams.", "description": "Zinc oxide isn\u2019t an ingredient you usually hear about a lot, but it is essential in your sun cream and blemish creams.", "authors": ["Victoria Hall", "Acting Beauty Director"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/beauty/November%25202016/SkincareScience_ZincOxide_1728-xlarge.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2016-12-01"}
