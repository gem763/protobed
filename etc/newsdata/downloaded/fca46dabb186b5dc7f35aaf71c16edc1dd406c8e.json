We do it for ourselves and our children,\" he added.", "description": "\u201cCitizens must decide which path we will take in the future \u2013 the correct, progressive European path, the path of reforms, or the path that leads backwards, towards isolation, nationalism, conflicts\"", "authors": ["Viola Stefanello"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/24/39/60/1000x563_cmsv2_3eed8d42-5c44-5c2e-8499-ceb0e9cd1ab7-4243960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
