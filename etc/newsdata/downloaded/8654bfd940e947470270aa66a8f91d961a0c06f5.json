But, after that, there\u2019s more downside ahead.\n\nLet me explain\u2026\n\nKinross Gold Corporation Stock Seems Ready for a Long-Term Uptrend More\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCorrections in the gold sector typically unfold in three distinct \u201clegs.\u201d The first leg is a steep decline from the top. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen over the past week and a half. And, for reasons I\u2019ll explain in a moment, that first decline phase should end soon \u2013 like today or tomorrow \u2013 and then be followed by the second \u201cleg,\u201d which is an oversold bounce off of support.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOnce that bounce ends, then we\u2019ll get the third \u201cleg\u201d of the correction. That will be a deeper decline to an even lower low that exhausts the selling and eventually sets the stage for a new rally phase.\n\nHere\u2019s an updated look at the chart of the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners Fund (GDX) I showed you right before the gold sector started selling off. I\u2019ve added some lines indicating my best \u201cguess\u201d as to how the rest of the decline will unfold\u2026\n\nGDX broke its rising wedge pattern to the downside. And it sliced right through the first support level at $28. Now, the stock is approaching its second support level at about $26.25 or so. And the MACD and CCI indicators at the bottom of the chart have dipped into oversold territory.\n\nSo, there\u2019s a good chance we\u2019re nearing the end of the first leg down. And, we\u2019ll soon see a bounce in GDX back up towards its former support line, now resistance, near $28.\n\nThe prospects of a bounce are supported by this 60-minute chart of GDX\u2026\n\nThis chart shows a falling wedge pattern with positive divergence on the MACD and RSI indicators. This sort of setup often leads to a breakout to the upside. If that happens here, then GDX should be able to rally back up towards $28 or even $28.50 per share \u2013 which lines up nicely with the resistance line on the daily chart.", "description": "The gold sector is overdue for a short-term bounce.
