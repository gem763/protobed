His specialist is particularly concerned about his high level of cholestorol.\n\n\u201cBefore the doctor told me, I didn\u2019t know I had high cholesterol. I\u2019d never done the analysis before, because I was feeling fine.\u201d\n\nNow he takes Crestor, a drug in the statin family. Despite the controversy, many doctors still believe they prevent high cholesterol levels and cardio-vascular problems.\n\nSenior cardiologist at Georges Pompidou Hospital, Nicolas Danchin said: \u201cIn coronary patients, that is people who have had a heart attack or angina, statins not only reduce the risk of having a recurrence, but quite simply they lower the risk of death or, more accurately, put the risk of death further away, and raise the life expectancy of these patients in a quite significant manner\u201d.\n\nStatins are among the most prescribed drugs in the world. In France they are used by at least 4-million people, costing the insurance companies 1.5-billion euros a year.\n\nThe French drug regulation agency ANSM believes they are an important weapon in a doctor\u2019s arsenal.\n\nManager Joseph Emmerich said: \u201cThese drugs have been extremely well scrutinized for side effects and, anyway, there are not many drugs that can reduce mortality by 10% like statins.\u201d\n\nThe alternative view\n\nNot everyone though is such a fan. Renaud de Langlade heads several companies in the field of advanced electronics.\n\nHe took statins for ten years because his cholestorol readings were high.\n\nIt was a decade of painful side-effects, professional problems and a family crisis.\n\nNow he has ditched the statins and he is back on top again.\n\n\u201cMainly I felt fatigue. When I came home I was drained. I had no energy, nothing. And when I say I had no motivation I mean none whatsoever,\u201d Langlade explained.\n\n\u201cIn the morning when I was back in the office, I was not 100% with the clients. But when I stopped the statins, even before I started exercise again, I felt much better, 10 times better, No more anxiety or stress, no more troubles and I could sleep. I returned to the normal workrate I had before. \u201c\n\nOne leading cardiologist has changed his mind about statins.\n\nMichel de Lorgeril from Grenoble University now believes they serve no purpose in lowering cholestorol to prevent cardiac problems. Indeed he even thinks they are dangerous.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll come to the inevitable conclusion in the end that these drugs are unnecessary and toxic, they must be removed from the market and the health service must stop paying for them,\u201d Lorgeril said. \u201cAs professors Even and Debr\u00e9 have already said, if you really want to protect yourself from heart disease and stroke, you should turn to something other than anti-cholesterol drugs.\u201d\n\nThere are already other ways of looking after your heart that are unanimously endorsed by medical world.\n\nExercise is one. Saying goodbye to tobacco and animal fat is another, and saying hello to a Mediterranean style diet, full of fresh veg.", "description": "There is a growing question mark over a commonly prescribed type of drug to lower cholestorol.\n\n\tSome scientists and doctors believe statins are", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/archive/1000x563_archive.jpg", "published_at": "2013-03-19"}
