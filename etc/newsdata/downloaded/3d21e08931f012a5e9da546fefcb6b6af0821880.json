Now They\u2019ve Put a Target on Him.", "language": "en", "text": "Daniel Harper is the co-host of what might be the most important podcast countering the white nationalist movement today.\n\nIt\u2019s called I Don\u2019t Speak German, and since launching in January it has helped lead people back from the brink of radicalization, drawn plaudits from researchers of violent extremism, and attracted an audience of thousands of regular listeners.\n\nBut for Harper, it\u2019s also come at a personal cost. He routinely has been harassed online by the very subjects he discusses, and he constantly has to think about the safety of himself and his family.\n\nThose concerns became clearer last month when federal authorities rolled out criminal charges against Jarrett William Smith, a U.S. Army soldier in Kansas who was active in the online white nationalist community that refers to itself as \u201cTerrorgram.\u201d\n\nSome of the allegations against Smith immediately drew major headlines. The feds said he wanted to blow up the headquarters of a major news network, gave out instructions online about how to build bombs, and planned to travel to Ukraine to join up with a far-right militant group.\n\nBut there was another allegation that got significantly less attention: The soldier allegedly also gave out instructions on how to burn down the house of a man described in court records only by the initials D.H.\n\nThat man was Daniel Harper, who spoke to The Daily Beast about being on the receiving end of a threat by a self-proclaimed satanic neo-Nazi who also happens to be in the military.\n\n\u201cI want to be really clear on this,\u201d Harper said. \u201cI don't think this guy was going to show up at my house and burn it down.\u201d\n\nHowever, he added, \u201cit\u2019s absolutely within the realm of plausibility that some 19-year-old dipshit\u2019s going to decide to do something\u201d because of what Smith was posting online.\n\nHarper would know. He\u2019s been obsessively tracking the racist right for the past three years and has proven to be something of a savant when it comes to understanding the figures and dynamics of the movement.\n\nHis quest began in 2016 on something of a lark. He\u2019d been observing the resurgence of white nationalism in America but was curious to know more about it.\n\nAlong the way, Harper saw a reference online to a racist alt-right podcast, which at the time was called Fash the Nation. Already an avid podcast listener, he decided to add it to his rotation. He figured it might become a tool for him to be able to explain the movement to his friends.\n\n\u201cIt was really this idle curiosity, and I just wanted to do something in the face of this Trump presidency and this new era that we were obviously in,\u201d Harper said.\n\nHe quickly found more racist podcasts along with racist YouTube livestreams to consume. After just a few months, it began to dawn on him that he was developing a base of knowledge that few other people had.\n\nYes, he was listening to white nationalist propaganda, but it felt like he was eavesdropping on some kind of secretive subculture that he, a devoted leftist and anti-racist, wasn\u2019t supposed to be hearing.\n\nWhen the deadly \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally happened in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017, Harper decided it was time to turn this into a serious research project. He began downloading, archiving, and tracking as much racist audio content as he could.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t quite clear what he was going to do with all of it. He already had a day job, and this was something he was doing in his free time. And he realized he was listening to 30 to 40 hours of racist content per week.\n\n\u201cI was off on my own forever,\u201d Harper said. \u201cIt often felt like I was like a deep-sea diver... just in this murky world of awfulness.\u201d\n\nThen a friend, Jack Graham, suggested they turn it into a podcast of their own. The idea for the format was simple: Graham would ask Harper about certain topics, and Harper would rattle off his knowledge of them with a mix of horror and humor. Occasionally, they would have guests on to talk about specific groups or movements.\n\nThe pair launched I Don\u2019t Speak German at the start of this year and have already turned out 33 episodes, with more on the way.\n\nThe episodes often focus on the follies of the racist right. The white nationalist movement, despite its body count and frequent glorification of genocide, has often been plagued by infighting and incompetence\u2014something Harper and Graham are more than willing to highlight.\n\nThe pair talked at length (Episode 8) about the bizarre love triangle and violence that tore apart the Traditionalist Worker Party, a neo-Nazi group that took part in the violence in Charlottesville. And they can\u2019t seem to stop talking, in whatever episode, about the absurdist troubles of \u201cCrying Nazi\u201d Christopher Cantwell.\n\n\u201cSo much of what I try to get across is to emphasize the humanity in these people, without shying away from how terrible the things that they say are,\u201d Harper said.\n\nThat approach, along with Harper\u2019s encyclopedic knowledge, has driven people to the podcast.\n\nDavid Neiwert, a veteran journalist and author who\u2019s covered the racist right for decades and who was a guest on a July episode of I Don\u2019t Speak German, told The Daily Beast the show strikes just the right tone.\n\n\u201cDaniel and his cohorts do terrific work confronting the disinformation deluge we're all contending with these days, and they do it with wit and humility, which are essential to this kind of work,\u201d Neiwert said. \u201cTheir podcast is kind of a survival guide for the new age of agitprop, and I love listening to it.\u201d\n\nWhile Harper said the majority of the audience sits on the political left, he also knows that there are a number of white nationalists who listen to what he and Graham talk about. Sometimes those people post vicious comments about him online. Sometimes they email him.\n\nAnd sometimes, he said, those emails will surprise him.\n\nOne email he received this year, he said, was from someone who told him they were in a \u201cdark head space\u201d and on the path to becoming a mass shooter. But listening to the show, the emailer said, helped walk them back from the edge.\n\n\u201cIt's humbling in this weird way,\u201d Harper said. Mostly because it\u2019s not the kind of response he expected when he started the podcast. \u201cThat's a great thing, but it's certainly not where my head space is when I'm recording it.\u201d\n\nJesse Morton can testify to the positive impact of I Don\u2019t Speak German. He\u2019s a former jihadist propagandist who now serves as the head of Light Upon Light, an organization that works to combat hate and extremism.\n\nA research consultant for the organization, Samantha Kutner, has been a guest of the podcast, talking about her study of the far-right Proud Boys.\n\n\u201cHer episode alone got four or five productive engagements and interventions with far right-wing extremists,\u201d Morton told The Daily Beast.\n\nOne person who reached out to Light Upon Light because of the podcast said he was thinking about being a mass shooter and wanted Morton\u2019s group to convince him otherwise.\n\n\u201cHe came from the podcast,\u201d Morton said. \u201cHe's an avid listener, and we continue to have engagements with this individual onto today where we've walked him down to a point of disengagement.\u201d\n\nMorton, too, credited the show\u2019s blend of information and humor.\n\n\u201cThat's the way to cover it. In the way that society deals with extremism in general, terrorism just evokes a very serious mental state of shock and awe,\u201d Morton said. \u201cThere's a way to cover far right-wing extremism and terrorism with humor that can be really provocative.\u201d\n\nBut as the case against Jarrett William Smith shows, covering extremists has its risks.\n\nIn early September, Harper and his co-host released a pair of episodes that focused on the adherents of an obscure neo-Nazi author named James Mason. A book Mason wrote has become a bible of sorts for terroristic neo-Nazi groups like Atomwaffen Division, and it has helped spawn a new wave of so-called accelerationists\u2014people who believe societal collapse is the quickest way to create an all-white ethnostate.\n\nMany of those adherents flocked to Telegram, the encrypted messaging app, in recent months after getting booted from other social media platforms. And they\u2019ve created their own enclave there, which they refer to as \u201cTerrorgram.\u201d\n\nIt was there, in the Terrorgram community, that the threats against Harper took shape.\n\nOn Sept. 11, an anonymous post appeared on one of the Terrorgram channels, telling people to send Harper \u201cfan mail\u201d at his address in Michigan.\n\nThe following day, the same channel published a video from someone who drove by the address and filmed the house. \u201cHowdy, antifascist activist Daniel Harper,\u201d the text of the post read. \u201cNice place you've got there.\u201d\n\nThe posts set off a wave of chatter on Telegram. In the midst of it was a user who went by the handle \u201cAnti-Kosmik 2182,\u201d who chimed in with his thoughts about what to do about Harper.\n\n\u201c I\u2019m not saying do anything illegal, but I am saying it would be a real shame if all he has went up in literal flames. \u201d \u2014 Anti-Kosmik 2182\n\n\u201cDitch the car somewhere a few blocks away, take back alleys, trails in the woods, etc., and then come up on the house wearing a mask,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI\u2019m not saying do anything illegal, but I am saying it would be a real shame if all he has went up in literal flames.\u201d\n\nIn court records, the FBI later said that \u201cAnti-Kosmik 2182\u201d was Smith, an infantry soldier stationed at Fort Riley, Kansas. The bureau also revealed that it had an undercover agent on Telegram who was interacting with Smith around the same time.\n\nSmith was arrested on Sept. 23 and charged with two counts of distributing information about weapons of mass destruction and a third count of sending a threatening communication over state lines.\n\nHarper said he\u2019s used to harassment online, but the threat was something new.\n\n\u201cIf they just want to make fun of my man boobs, it's like, \u2018Whatever,\u2019\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cThe threats from people who actually seem to be at least tangentially connected to literal terrorists? That worries me a lot more.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not going to stop him from podcasting or possibly even doing more with his research. He said he plans to write a book based on his experiences over the past three years.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of material to work with, and the podcast is just the beginning.", "description": "Daniel Harper, co-host of \u201cI Don\u2019t Speak German,\u201d is used to online harassment.
