His parents, Judy and Dennis, were invited to attend Wednesday\u2019s event \u2014 and decided to use it as an opportunity to question the Trump Administration\u2019s record on protecting LGBTQ Americans.\n\nThey wrote a statement which was read aloud by Cynthia Deitle, the director of programs at the Matthew Shepard Foundation.\n\n\"We find it interesting and hypocritical that (Barr) would invite us to this event commemorating a hate crime law named after our son and Mr. Byrd, while at the same time asking the Supreme Court to allow the legalized firing of transgender employees,\" Deitle said. \u201cMr. Barr, you cannot have it both ways.\u201d\n\nDeitle added that if Barr believes that transgender employees are not worthy of protection, then she \u201cneed not invite us to future events at the Department of Justice that are billed as celebrating the law that protects these same individuals from hate crimes.\"", "description": "A letter from Shepard's parents attacking Barr was read aloud during a ceremony inside the Justice Department.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5da8d748ff38620009ee2daf/lede/1571346448514-101619_MATTHEW_SHEPARD_CEREMONY_BARR_REMARKS00_00_08_17Still001.jpeg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
