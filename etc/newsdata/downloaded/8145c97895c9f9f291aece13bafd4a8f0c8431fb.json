Some White House staffers have even volunteered to take a polygraph to prove their innocence after they were suspected of leaking, according to the former official.\n\nThe new details of Trump\u2019s repeated interest in polygraphing provide important context on the president\u2019s state of mind as Democrats demand answers about the White House\u2019s handling of records of his interactions with foreign leaders. A whistleblower has accused White House officials of improperly storing transcripts of the president\u2019s phone calls in a system meant for highly classified intelligence secrets, including a conversation with the president of Ukraine that has set off a spiraling impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives.\n\nTrump\u2019s interest in polygraphing his own White House staffers began amid constant reports in the first six months of his presidency of infighting, his behind-closed-doors raging about various news stories \u2014 especially the Mueller investigation, and how the James Comey firing went down \u2014 according to the first former White House official. In particular, Trump has been upset about how certain call transcripts, draft executive orders and other palace intrigue stories have made their way into the press.\n\nEach time, aides all the way up to the chief of staff level have been able to persuade him not to launch such a drastic step, arguing it would be counterproductive. But since those early months, multiple former officials said, he has continued to regularly ask whether his underlings should be polygraphed.\n\nAccounts differ as to just how literally, and seriously, those requests were taken.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/9f/5e/efb5847e4b42a358b4de7e606b6b/ukraine-site.png\"\n\n\u201cIt was something that was discussed and people were trying to placate the president, and trying to show that they were taking it as personally and just as seriously as he was,\u201d said one of the former White House officials. \u201cTaking that line of, \u2018Oh yeah, we have to polygraph people\u2019 was a way to ingratiate themselves with him, but it wasn\u2019t an idea that ever went anywhere because it was absurd.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not just the president: Seven former Trump administration officials said that there have been discussions among some White House staffers about using polygraphs as a way to find out who was leaking certain material. One of the sources, a former Trump NSC official, said the idea floated around after the \u201cGreat Leaks of 2017,\u201d when the transcripts of Trump\u2019s phone calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia leaked out.\n\nEarly on in Trump\u2019s presidency, Stefan Passantino, who was deputy White House counsel for compliance and ethics, took the lead on examining whether polygraphing employees was something that could legally be carried out or was advisable to carry out. Passantino said in a text message that the counsel's office \u201cquickly concluded it was not a thing to do.\u201d\n\nThe possibility was viewed as \u201cmore of a scare tactic\u201d to force people \u201cto sort of fess up to see if they can ferret out leakers or to try to prevent others from leaking any further,\u201d said a former White House official.\n\nAsked for comment, Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, said: \u201cI think the president and anyone in his administration have the right to be frustrated and even angry about leaks. Leaking information, which is often times classified, only hurts this country. I have been with the president since July 2015 and can say unequivocally that I have never heard suggesting polygraphs as a way to stop leaks.\u201d\n\nIn the last few weeks, Trump has repeatedly demanded to know the identity of the whistleblower who filed a complaint about his call with the Ukrainian president where he urged him to investigate his political rival Joe Biden, while also accusing the anonymous official of being a Democratic partisan.\n\nUnder federal law and policy to encourage filing complaints, whistleblowers have numerous protections, including the right to be anonymous and not face retaliation, although the protections likely wouldn\u2019t apply if the president ordered the termination of the whistleblower himself if he discovered his identity. But there are not necessarily such safeguards for White House officials who might have provided information to the whistleblower.\n\nFormer aides cite Trump\u2019s on-again, off-again polygraph obsession as a prime example of how he runs the White House -- he talks frequently about the need to do something, they said, while not always issuing explicit instructions.\n\n\"The way he does business a lot of times is just keep saying things over and over and over again and hopes that somebody does it, but that gives him deniability if he said, \u2018Well I never said specifically to do it,\u2019\u201d the former White House official said.\n\nPolygraph exams, known colloquially as \u201clie detector tests,\u201d have been around for almost a hundred years. Typically, they are administered by trained professionals using devices that measure a battery of physiological indicators such as a person\u2019s pulse, breathing, blood pressure, and skin conductivity while the person answers questions.\n\nBut there have long been questions about the accuracy of the technique. A 400-page National Academy of Sciences report found in 2003 that polygraphs were \u201cintrinsically susceptible to producing erroneous results,\u201d such as a high rate of false positives, and recommended against relying upon them.\n\nInside the federal government, there are a number of protocols regarding whether, when, how and in what context the government can require a polygraph exam. To get and keep one\u2019s top secret clearance, a polygraph is a standard feature in the evaluation process for individuals who work in the intelligence community. Part of the employment agreement for CIA officers, for instance, is that you can be ordered to take a polygraph immediately anytime you\u2019re suspected of anything improper, according to a former senior CIA official.\n\n\u201cYour choice is to take the polygraph or resign,\u201d said the person.\n\nOne common leak-hunting technique inside the Trump White House, however, requires very little technology at all.\n\n\u201cTypically when leak hunts were done before, it was just like, you were pulled in to the office and were yelled at, basically,\u201d said a former White House official.\n\nEven though polygraphing has never been carried out, even the fact that it could be used against employees hurt staff morale, according to the former official.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty big invasion of privacy,\u201d said the former official, who added that his colleagues at the time were \u201cshocked and appalled\u201d that polygraphs were even being considered. \u201cIf anyone actually did get polygraphed, and it leaked out to the media, I think the media storm that it caused would be harmful and much more trouble than it\u2019s worth.\u201d\n\nHints of the president\u2019s interest in polygraph exams have come out on occasion, however.\n\nAfter the New York Times published an anonymous op-ed by a senior administration official in September of 2018, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said that Trump should force administration officials to take polygraphs and the New York Times reported that some advisers discussed the idea. The president said at the time that \u201cpeople have suggested\u201d lie-detector tests and added that \u201ceventually the name of this sick person will come out.\u201d\n\nThe president and his top aides were especially leery of career government officials detailed from other agencies to the National Security Council, suspecting them of leaking damaging information to the press.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

Axios first reported Sessions\u2019 interest in polygraphing NSC staffers.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t immediately dismissed but it wasn\u2019t like, \u2018Oh we should do that, how do we go about doing that?\u2019\u201d said one of the people to whom Sessions mentioned it. \u201cThere\u2019s got to be some kind of fear of being caught.\u201d\n\nPolygraphing certain federal employees is not an original idea to Trump. President Obama\u2019s director of national intelligence, Jim Clapper, ordered in 2012 that intelligence employees be asked on polygraphs about whether they had shared classified information with the media after several closely-held national security secrets leaked out.\n\nRonald Reagan also contemplated policies that could have required more than 180,000 federal employees to get tested. Then-Secretary of State George Shultz fought the idea by arguing that the tests were often inaccurate and trained spies could beat them. He said at the time he would resign if he was ordered to take one.\n\nBut some in the government still swear by them. Polygraphs are \u201cpart of leak investigation 101 and should absolutely be used when necessary to protect against the unlawful release of national security information, especially when dealing with those entrusted to safeguard against it,\u201d said a current national security official who previously served in the NSC.\n\nTrump staffers musing about whether polygraphs were a good idea go back even as far back as the campaign, said a former senior White House official.\n\n\u201cNo one\u2019s dumb enough to [leak using] a government computer so the idea is, 'Let\u2019s just take it a step further,'\u201d said the person, describing the thinking of polygraph advocates in the White House.\n\nNatasha Bertrand contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/78/04/a9a91f8d4a4691be5e528e4b35b1/191008-donald-trump-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
