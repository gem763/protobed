Arrington, a senior at the Sadler, Texas school, walked across the field to get her crown \u2013 but she decided it actually belonged to someone else. So, she handed it to another girl: her classmate, Emily Petty, who has Down syndrome.\n\n\"I didn't think I was going to win. I told everyone that asked me if I wanted to win that I wanted Emily to win, so I told them to vote for her,\" Arrington told KXII. Both girls were nominated for the high school honor, but Arrington ultimately won.\n\nHowever, she wanted Petty to share the spotlight. \"I decided to give my crown to my sweet friend Emily because she's always wanted to be a princess. So I decided she deserved it,\" Arrington said.\n\nThe Texas teens held hands during their interview with CBS/Fox affiliate KXII. KXII\n\nVideo from the homecoming game shows the two girls walking hand-in-hand down the field \u2013 the glittering crown sits atop Petty's head. The teens met a year ago, when Arrington started eating lunch in the special education classroom and befriended Petty.\n\n\"I love her every day,\" Petty said, holding her friends hands as they spoke with KXII after their homecoming win.\n\nArrington said she cried when she handed her friend the crown. And Petty assured her she shouldn't cry.\n\nTrinity Arrington and Emily Petty held hands as they both accepted the title of S&S High School's homecoming queen \u2013 a title they were both nominated for, but both won because Arrington decided to share the victory. KXII\n\n\"We got to be it together. I think that was the best part for me,\" Arrington said. For both of these girls, winning homecoming queen is a day they will never forget \u2013 but it's about more than a high school title.\n\nArrington's kindness means the world to Petty. And Petty inspires Arrington right back. \"She's always been my queen, she deserved it. It made her happy,\" Arrington said.", "description": "The Texas teen was shocked she won \u2013 but then decided someone else deserved the title", "authors": ["Caitlin O'Kane"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/30/761c56b7-7660-4c40-aa71-d929cbbcd503/thumbnail/1200x630/45ef3c9a38e0594df7df0d626bdfe56a/hc1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
