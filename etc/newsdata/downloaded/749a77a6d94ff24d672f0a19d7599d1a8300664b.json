After all, it was just a week ago that Elizabeth Warren pulled 26 percent in a YouGov poll, her best total ever. Now here she is again breaking into the mid-20s with Bernie Sanders a distant third in the mid-teens.\n\nIs this now a two-way race?\n\nBecause increasingly it feels like a two-way race.\n\nNational NBC/WSJ poll on 2020 Dem race Biden 31% (+5 from July)\n\nWarren 25% (+6)\n\nSanders 14% (+1)\n\nButtigieg 7% (even)\n\nHarris 5% (-8)\n\nYang 4% (+2)\n\nKlobuchar 2% (+1)\n\nBooker 2% (+1) No other Dem got more than 1% Sept 13-16, 506 Dem primary voters, MOE +/- 4.4% \u2014 Mark Murray (@mmurraypolitics) September 17, 2019\n\nBiden fans will find solace in the fact that he kept pace with Warren\u2019s surge, losing just one net point to her since July. But read the fine print here. When we combine first- and second-choice totals for the candidates (and we should since the race is still heavily in flux at this early point) we find Warren at the head of the pack, not Grandpa Joe.\n\nWho\u2019s leading in voter enthusiasm, you ask? Right, Warren again. Back in March, just 20 percent of Democrats said they were enthusiastic about her as nominee. Today 35 percent do. The trends for Bernie and Biden are in the opposite direction, with enthusiasm for Sanders dipping from 28 to 25 percent since March and enthusiasm for Joe sliding all the way from 33 percent to 23. Dems are going to find themselves in quite a spot if Biden ekes out the nomination on \u201celectability\u201d grounds despite no one getting excited for him while Warren has to settle for second place despite galvanizing the base.\n\nThe divide among white voters is especially interesting since, as Liam Donovan notes, Iowa and New Hampshire are almost entirely white. Warren is surging ahead among white college grads but Biden remains in front with working-class whites. Who wins that death struggle in the early states?\n\nAmong whites\u2026 College+\n\nWarren 34%\n\nBiden 23%\n\nButtigieg 9%\n\nSnders 8%\n\nHarris 6%\n\nKlobuchar 4%\n\nBooker 3%\n\nO\u2019Rourke 3% Non-College\n\nBiden 38%\n\nWarren 25%\n\nSanders 15%\n\nButtigieg 6%\n\nHarris 4%\n\nYang 3%\n\nBooker 3% \u2014 Steve Kornacki (@SteveKornacki) September 17, 2019\n\nAnother race-related development worth nothing: Warren has now crept into second place among black Democrats. It\u2019s a very distant second to Biden, just 13 percent compared to his 49, but if she starts taking chunks of his base he\u2019s finished.\n\nAnd speaking of finished. Although it\u2019s not news that her polls have slipped significantly since July, the fact that she\u2019s now down to a dismal five percent here suggests that Officer Harris has retired from the 2020 force. She\u2019s now fifth when candidates are measured by their first- and second-choice totals behind Pete Buttigieg, and it seems perfectly plausible that she\u2019ll have been passed by Andrew Yang the next time NBC polls the race. This poll is no outlier either: The last three surveys tracked by RCP had her at six, four, and six points. Imagine being a millionaire liberal who\u2019s been approached by Harris for your support. What could she possibly say at this point to convince you to cut her a check instead of Warren or Biden or even Sanders? Hopefully this poll will kickstart the \u201cHarris is a surprisingly weak, cynical, inauthentic candidate\u201d takes in the media, because she really is all of those things and more attention should be paid to it.\n\nOne last point. There\u2019s a running debate among politics nerds about whether Bernie is hurting Warren or Biden more by remaining in the race. You might think the answer is obvious \u2014 he\u2019s hurting Warren because they\u2019re both far left and some of his voters would surely be with her if he dropped out. But Bernie also appeals to older working-class white voters, the same people who gravitate to Grandpa Joe. Not all voters are ideologues. For some, if they can\u2019t get the geriatric socialist nominated for president, they\u2019ll take the geriatric centrist. I mention all that because this graph from NBC\u2019s story about the poll caught my eye:\n\nClearly Bernie does seem to be hurting Warren more than Biden right now. Given the reports today of dissension within the ranks of Team Sanders, you wonder if some Berniebros will begin grudgingly leaning him on this fall to do the right thing and endorse Warren if there\u2019s further separation between the two in polling.\n\nOh, almost forgot: Now that we have two separate post-debate polls showing Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s numbers stuck in the toilet, I think we can safely conclude that last week\u2019s gun-confiscation stunt was a bust.\n\nIn lieu of an exit question, via Jeff Dunetz, here\u2019s the Trump campaign\u2019s new tribute to the mental health of the Democratic frontrunner, who\u2019s probably not really the frontrunner anymore at this point.", "description": "Endgame?", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
