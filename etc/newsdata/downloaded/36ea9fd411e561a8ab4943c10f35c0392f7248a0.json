The critics took him this way in part because he depicted the last few decades of American life as a hellscape from which he would shortly deliver us: \u201cThis American carnage stops right here and stops right now.\u201d But the critics also had this reaction because the address had a theme \u2014 nationalism \u2014 that has itself long been assumed in many quarters to be dark, divisive, and dangerous.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat assumption has never been justified and should now be discarded. Nationalism can be a healthy and constructive force. Since nationalistic sentiments also have wide appeal and durability, it would be wiser to cultivate that kind of nationalism than to attempt to move beyond it.\n\nFear of nationalism became very widespread, especially in Europe, after the world wars, and it remains a core premise behind the sputtering drive toward further European integration. A few months ago, European Union president Jean-Claude Juncker recalled Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand\u2019s admonition, \u201cLe nationalisme, c\u2019est la guerre,\u201d adding, \u201cThis is still true, so we have to fight against nationalism.\u201d Juncker also called borders \u201cthe worst invention ever made by politicians.\u201d Any attempt to loosen the bonds of European unity is held to mark the beginning of a descent back into European carnage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor conservatives to say that a similar attitude took root on the American left may come across as a slander of political opponents. The late Richard Rorty was, however, a member in good standing of the American Left (and still is even posthumously; his warnings about the rise of an American strongman were dusted off after the election), and he said much the same thing. He wrote that the academic Left\u2019s \u201cfocus on marginalized groups will, in the long run, help to make our country much more decent, more tolerant and more civilized.\u201d He then added, \u201cBut there is a problem with this left: it is unpatriotic. In the name of \u2018the politics of difference,\u2019 it refuses to rejoice in the country it inhabits. It repudiates the idea of a national identity, and the emotion of national pride.\u201d\n\nIn associating these attitudes with the \u201cacademic\u201d Left, Rorty might have understated their prevalence. In 2016, a BBC poll found that 43 percent of Americans agreed with the statement \u201cI see myself more as a global citizen than a citizen of my country.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNationalism has a bad odor even among some conservatives. Perhaps this should not be surprising, since nationalism is in tension with two powerful strains of conservatism. Economic conservatism, particularly as influenced by libertarianism, can come to see borders as barriers to free markets. Businessmen with interests abroad, an important part of the conservative coalition, can acclimate to that way of thinking even if they have no philosophical inclinations. Religious conservatism often emphasizes the God-given dignity of all people, which transcends national borders. Thus former president George W. Bush\u2019s declaration, in the context of immigration policy, that \u201cfamily values do not stop at the Rio Grande river.\u201d\n\nAnd American conservatives of many kinds, like liberals and libertarians, have been influenced by the notion that America is an \u201cidea\u201d or a \u201cproposition nation.\u201d The expression of this view is itself often a manifestation of patriotism, because it is self-flattering: \u201cOur country, unlike all the world\u2019s ethno-states, is founded on high-minded ideals.\u201d\n\nAll of these intellectual currents have fed the view that nationalism is atavistic and sinister, a corruption of conservatism if it has anything to do with it at all. And the plasticity of the term \u201cnationalism\u201d has contributed to its bad reputation in all corners of the political world. Take George Orwell\u2019s influential essay against nationalism. He adopted a capacious definition of the term, one that included Stalinism and excluded a normal devotion to one\u2019s own country. What he meant by nationalism \u2014 self-identification with a group or cause, hostility to any criticism of it, and a limitless desire for it to have additional power and prestige \u2014 was something like what Edmund Burke had in mind when he spoke of \u201carmed doctrine.\u201d Orwell\u2019s definition remains idiosyncratic, but hostility to nationalism typically rests on similar conceptual muddles. Anti-nationalists blame the world wars on nationalism even though those wars involved multinational empires (in the case of the first) and transnational ideologies (in the case of the second). They strain to devise labored distinctions between a good patriotism and a bad nationalism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that there are aggressive and noxious forms of nationalism. John Fonte of the Hudson Institute makes a useful distinction between authoritarian and democratic nationalism. Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdogan are examples of the former (although Putin leads a multinational empire with designs for more territorial acquisitions). Democratic nationalism is a category that encompasses Lincoln, Churchill, de Gaulle, Reagan, and Thatcher, all of whom were champions of national sovereignty and solidarity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe outlines of a benign nationalism are not hard to discern. It includes loyalty to one\u2019s country: a sense of belonging, allegiance, and gratitude to it. And this sense attaches to the country\u2019s people and culture, not just to its political institutions and laws. Such nationalism includes solidarity with one\u2019s countrymen, whose welfare comes before, albeit not to the complete exclusion of, that of foreigners. When this nationalism finds political expression, it supports a federal government that is jealous of its sovereignty, forthright and unapologetic about advancing its people\u2019s interests, and mindful of the need for national cohesion.\n\nAny worthwhile nationalism has these components, but beyond them the content of a country\u2019s nationalism depends on its particular character. American nationalism has an ideological component, so much of one as to render it exceptional (as in \u201cAmerican exceptionalism\u201d). This is the truth underlying the simplification that America is an idea rather than a nation. In reality, it is a nation with an idea. The first Federalist paper presents America as an example to the world, and even John Quincy Adams\u2019s famous remark about how America \u201cgoes not abroad, in search of monsters to destroy,\u201d was immediately followed by: \u201cShe is the well-wisher to the freedom and independence of all.\u201d The aspiration that all people enjoy freedom is built into our political DNA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImportant as these ideas are, American nationalism is not merely about them. This fact can be seen easily enough from our patriotic fanfare. A flyover or July Fourth fireworks display is not creedal. Neither is a Memorial Day parade, or laying a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. John Philip Sousa marches aren\u2019t statements of ideals. Surely, the revulsion that most people feel when protesters burn an American flag is based on the belief not that the protesters are symbolically destroying an idea, but rather that they are disrespecting the nation to which they owe respect and fealty.\n\nIndeed, the vast majority of expressions of American patriotism \u2014 the flag, the national anthem, statues, shrines and coinage honoring national heroes, military parades, ceremonies for those fallen in the nation\u2019s wars \u2014 are replicated in every other country of the world. This is all the stuff of nationalism, both abroad and here at home.\n\nIt is worth noting, as well, that none of these expressions of love of country and anger at its opposite reflects ethnocentrism, either. Discussions of nationalism frequently pose the alternatives of an obsession with blood and soil (nationalism!) and an exclusive focus on political ideals (patriotism!). The actual practice of American patriots has avoided both.\n\nFor conservatives, the sensible and moderate form that nationalism has taken in America should have particular appeal. Conservatism is grounded in a respect for what is local, particular, and traditional. And most nations are historical accretions, as the conservative philosopher Roger Scruton, who has written powerfully in defense of nationalism, notes:\n\nA nation-state is a form of customary order, the byproduct of human neighborliness, shaped by an \u201cinvisible hand\u201d from the countless agreements between people who speak the same language and live side by side. It results from compromises established after many conflicts, and expresses the slowly forming agreement among neighbors both to grant each other space and to protect that space as common territory.\n\nThe emphasis on \u201cneighborliness\u201d is appropriate. People aren\u2019t just atomistic individuals bouncing around in a free market; they are members of communities with attachments to faith, family, and civic associations that give their lives meaning. The nation is a community writ large, and it is natural for people to love it \u2014 to revere its civic rituals, history, landscape, music, art, literature, heroes, and war dead.\n\n\u201cCosmopolitanism gives us one country, and it is good,\u201d G. K. Chesterton wrote. \u201cNationalism gives us a hundred countries, and every one of them is the best. Cosmopolitanism offers a positive, patriotism a chorus of superlatives. Patriotism begins the praise of the world at the nearest thing, instead of beginning it at the most distant.\u201d He continued, in a charming touch, \u201cWherever there is a strangely-shaped mountain upon some lonely island, wherever there is a nameless kind of fruit growing in some obscure forest, patriotism insures that this shall not go into darkness without being remembered in a song.\u201d\n\nNo one, no matter how cosmopolitan, is truly a citizen of the world. The \u201cinternational community\u201d doesn\u2019t give out citizenship, or even green cards. We are citizens of particular nations where we live and are enmeshed in relationships of reciprocal obligation. No nation opens itself to all people of the world willy-nilly; every nation privileges people born within it (and those foreigners it decides to welcome). Every nation worth its salt takes special care to protect its own citizens and soldiers. No nation is going to care more than France if a French citizen is taken hostage somewhere in the Middle East.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe nation also makes democracy possible. Without the nation, and people bound together by a common home, language, and sense of shared identity and interests, there is no real polity. There is a reason that the European Union, a collection of disparate nations with disparate interests and traditions, has a democracy deficit and always will.\n\nNationalist sentiments are natural and can\u2019t be beaten out of people if you try. It would be a strange and etiolated conservatism that lacked any foundation in them. And at its best, post\u2013World War II conservatism has been highly protective of the prerogatives of the nation.\n\nConservatives have been suspicious of the United Nations and any \u201cglobal test\u201d that might constrain the sovereign power of the United States to act in international affairs. Nothing so engenders conservative opposition to an international agreement as any hint that it might impinge on American sovereignty. This suspicion has been the source of the fierce resistance, for instance, to the Law of the Sea Treaty. In reaction to the possibility that the International Criminal Court might gain jurisdiction over American citizens, the George W. Bush administration \u2014 under the leadership of John Bolton \u2014 secured bilateral agreements with 104 countries that they would not extradite U.S. citizens to the court.\n\nThe premise of conservative foreign policy has always been the national interest, or as the Sharon Statement put it, \u201cAmerican foreign policy must be judged by this criterion: does it serve the just interests of the United States?\u201d This view is compatible with a commitment to human rights, as during the Cold War and George W. Bush\u2019s war on terror (although Bush at times veered into a thoroughgoing Wilsonian universalism at odds with the conservative tradition). The driving rationale of conservative foreign policy, though, has always been protecting our citizens and advancing the country\u2019s interests. Fundamentally, we buttress the liberal world order not because it is good for the world (it is) but because it is good for us. We cooperate with other countries to advance joint interests, not to serve a \u201cworld community.\u201d\n\nDomestically, since the 1960s and 1970s, what the late social scientist Samuel Huntington called a \u201cdenationalized\u201d elite in this country has waged war on the nation and its common culture. Conservatives have fought back on issues such as bilingual education, the downgrading of traditional U.S. history in curricula, racial preferences, the elevation of subnational groups, and mass immigration \u2014 anything that has been part of the multiculturalist onslaught on national solidarity.\n\nThe appeal to national pride has also been important to conservative politics, and has tended to be most pronounced precisely when conservatism has been politically successful, as during the Reagan years. It remains a sentiment that differentiates Left and Right. Research into public opinion typically finds that patriotic sentiments \u2014 e.g., \u201cI often feel proud to be an American\u201d \u2014 are more widespread among conservatives than liberals. In sum, there\u2019s a reason that Irving Kristol said the three pillars of conservatism are religion, nationalism, and economic growth.\n\nBut the spread of post-nationalist attitudes on the right combined with events and trends \u2014 such as the end of the Cold War, the expansion of global trade, a wave of immigration, and the professionalization of the military \u2014 to render mainstream American conservatism less able to make this kind of appeal and less interested in doing so. Conservatism became less nationalist in a kind of response to declining national cohesion. (We should note, by the way, that our friend and colleague John O\u2019Sullivan has been persuasive and prescient in pushing back against the trends, writing in these pages and elsewhere about the importance of nationalism.)\n\nThis same decline in cohesion made many Americans yearn for a politics that provided a sense of solidarity. This was particularly the case for many white voters without college degrees, who have seen their relative social and economic standing decline and their patriotism devalued. Traditional conservatives did not appeal to them. Donald Trump\u2019s call to make their country great again did.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat to make of President Trump\u2019s nationalism in particular? The most generous understanding of what he represents \u2014 and it can be well hidden beneath his bluster and bullying \u2014 is an enriched understanding of what it means to be American. During the campaign, Trump policy director Stephen Miller introduced him at events with speeches that were notably communitarian in emphasis. For Trump, we are more than just consumers, the way libertarians tend to view us. We are also workers, and can\u2019t be abstracted from the economic and social health of our communities. CEOs aren\u2019t just profit maximizers, as economic theory says; they are citizens with obligations to their countrymen. Trump\u2019s view of immigration is of a piece with this nationalism \u2014 we have the sovereign right to decide who comes here and who doesn\u2019t, and policy should be crafted to serve the interests of U.S. citizens.\n\nIf Trump has pointed the GOP back to a more secure and realistic grounding in nationalism, his version is lacking in important respects. The country\u2019s founding ideals, history, and institutions barely enter into his worldview. Too often he seems to want to make America great without appreciating what makes it exceptional. He\u2019s not a limited-government conservative, nor does he appear to be a religious man. His obsessions with making Mexico pay for the border wall and with taking Iraq\u2019s oil strongly smell of nationalist predation. Trump makes gestures toward an inclusive nationalism, but they can get lost in the combative haze created by his truculent persona and aren\u2019t as convincing as they would be if his nationalism were softened and elevated by traditional invocations of our civic creed. To the extent that Trump\u2019s nationalism does not include Americans of all races and religions, it betrays the goal of true national unity. His views on trade, meanwhile, rightly take the national interest as the goal of economic policy but then systematically misidentify the means to advance it.\n\nThe elements of American nationalism that Trump scants are moderating influences on it. They push in the direction of decentralization and localism rather than an all-powerful central government. They appropriately situate loyalty to the nation within a set of concentric circles of concern starting with the family and ending with the globe.\n\nAs with many things related to Trump, though, he offers an important lesson at the same time that he is a flawed vessel. Conservatives should reject the atomism inherent in libertarianism and the Wilsonian millenarianism that characterized the George W. Bush administration at the zenith of its ambitions. We should instead favor a broad-minded nationalism that takes account of the nation\u2019s idealism and rationally calculates its economic and foreign-policy interests.\n\nNationalism should be tempered by a modesty about the power of government, lest an aggrandizing state wedded to a swollen nationalism run out of control; by religion, which keeps the nation from becoming the first allegiance; and by a respect for other nations that undergirds a cooperative international order. Nationalism is a lot like self-interest. A political philosophy that denies its claims is utopian at best and tyrannical at worst, but it has to be enlightened. The first step to conservatives\u2019 advancing such an enlightened nationalism is to acknowledge how important it is to our worldview to begin with.", "description": "A defense of nationalism.", "authors": ["Ramesh Ponnuru", "Rich Lowry", "Dan Mclaughlin", "Josh Blackman", "Ian Tuttle", "J.
