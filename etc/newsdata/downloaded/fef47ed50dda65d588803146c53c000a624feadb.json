REUTERS/Aly Song\n\nFifth-generation chipsets from Qualcomm, the world\u2019s biggest supplier of mobile phone chips, now run on five devices from Samsung Electronics (005930.KS), including the $1,299 Galaxy S10 5G model and the new $2,000 Galaxy Fold.\n\nSamsung, the world\u2019s top smartphone seller, has also put Qualcomm chips in its lower-priced A90 5G model, which had used Samsung chips in an earlier version.\n\nQualcomm President Cristiano Amon predicted such devices would achieve volume and scale.\n\n\u201cThe transition to 5G is going to be faster than earlier transitions,\u201d Amon told Reuters on the sidelines of the IFA consumer electronics fair in Berlin. \u201cNow we have to bring it to everyone.\u201d\n\nMore than 20 network operators and a similar number of smartphone makers - from the United States to Europe to China - are launching 5G services and handsets. Amon estimated there were 2.2 billion mobile users that could upgrade.\n\nSuch bullishness contrasts with the challenges faced by China\u2019s Huawei Technologies, the No.2 smartphone seller behind Samsung that also unveiled its 5G chipset at IFA.\n\nHuawei\u2019s consumer business chief Richard Yu touted the Kirin 990 chipset at IFA as the \u201cmost powerful\u201d and superior to Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 8 series.\n\nDue to U.S. trade sanctions, Huawei\u2019s 5G-ready Mate 30 smartphone range to be launched on Sept. 19 could be hobbled because it won\u2019t be able to run the official version of Google\u2019s Android operating system and app services.\n\nMASS APPEAL\n\nUntil now, Qualcomm typically supplied 5G chips from its most expensive line, Snapdragon 8, which on Friday was showcased with a more powerful X55 5G modem delivering speeds of up to 7 gigabits per second.\n\nIt now plans to add 5G capabilities to lower-cost Snapdragon 6 and 7 series devices, which could make 5G phones available more cheaply than the current mostly premium models.\n\nQualcomm\u2019s 6 and 7 series Snapdragon chips are found in devices from Lenovo Group Ltd\u2019s (0992.HK) Motorola, Xiaomi Corp (1810.HK), Oppo and Vivo that retail in the $300 range.\n\nAnalysts say faster 5G networks will spur many consumers to upgrade their phones after years of market stagnation, although 5G devices are coming to some markets before networks are completed.\n\n\u201cQualcomm have done a phenomenal job to drive the 5G ecosystem,\u201d said industry analyst Paolo Pescatore. \u201cIt\u2019s going faster than anyone could have ever imagined.\u201d\n\nThat puts a premium for Qualcomm on partnering with carriers to market new devices. It\u2019s typical for operators to market subsidized handsets in the United States, but less so in Europe.\n\nIn Germany, Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE) switched on its 5G network in five cities this week, marketing the Snapdragon-powered Samsung Galaxy S10 5G to early adopters.\n\nFULL SPECTRUM\n\nQualcomm was early to market 5G modem chips to connect phones to networks but faces intense competition. Taiwan-based MediaTek Inc (2454.TW) also announced a 5G smartphone chip this year.\n\nQualcomm is positioning itself to be compatible with the full range of frequencies deployed by regulators to run 5G.\n\nThese include so-called \u2018sub-6\u2019, or spectrum below 6 Gigahertz that has been predominantly auctioned by European governments making an early start on the shift to 5G.\n\nThe United States has auctioned more millimeter wave frequencies with a shorter range but higher data-carrying capacity needed to realize the full range of uses of 5G, such as autonomous driving.\n\nUnlike rivals, Qualcomm is designing its chipsets to handle frequencies \u201cfrom A to Z\u201d, said Amon, adding that flexibility to switch between 4G networks and new 5G networks was critical.\n\nChips from Mediatek can only handle sub-6 bands, reducing the cost and complexity of the chips and phone designs.\n\nBut it means the phones cannot take full advantage of networks from U.S. carriers such as Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and AT&T Inc (T.N) that use millimeter wave technology.", "description": "Qualcomm Inc promised on Friday to bring 5G mobile phones to the masses with a high-end modem and said its chips would also power mid-price devices hitting the market next year.", "authors": ["Stephen Nellis", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1426902291&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8514J", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
