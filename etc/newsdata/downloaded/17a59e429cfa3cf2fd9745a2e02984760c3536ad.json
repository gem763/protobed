Known for her refined, elegant separates, close-fitting cocktail dresses and sharp, androgynous tailoring, the designer took a chance on flowing, fluid dresses and an abundance of ruffles.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that the Victoria Beckham brand has found itself in financial hot water over the past few years. In 2017, losses rose from \u00a38.5m to \u00a310.3m, and in January Beckham Brand Holdings reportedly paid out \u00a330m in dividends to help with plummeting profits. Could a new direction be a last-ditch attempt to keep a toe in the icy cold sartorial waters?\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nPresented with her motley crew \u2013 David, Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz and Harper \u2013 perched, front row next to Anna Wintour and with Helen Mirren nearby wearing one of last season\u2019s creations, support for the designer inside the marbled Dubar Court was touching; outside, a line of Extinction Rebellion protestors lined up to read declarations of dismay at show attendees entering the venue.\n\n\u201cWe looked at a melting pot of references and inspiration from past decades, then looked to our brand DNA and put everything together into a blender, to make a new, modern mix\u201d, explains the designer in the show notes. The \u201cmodern mix\u201d wasn\u2019t quite as miscible as indented. A sea of camel, ivory and creams were interrupted with jarring colour combinations of brown with purple and green; cerulean with caramel.\n\nThe new aesthetic flirted with a rejection of structure in ankle-skimming, long-sleeved, billowing gowns that moved with liquescence. \u201cI want clothes that move with a woman, that move with her life,\u201d said Beckham. Dresses were cut down to the ribcage in deep V-necks surrounded by frills. Others had ruffles that wrapped from the waist down to the hips or skimmed strapless tops. A purple iteration looked like a walking Quality Street instead of exuding the intended grace. Embellishment, too, fell somewhat short of the mark. Big taffeta flowers worn on lapels and the sides of turtle necks looked like awkwardly-placed rosettes \u2013 not the Coco Chanel camellias they appeared to be inspired by.\n\nThere were themes that felt disconnected: a pair of bubble-gum pink trousers and another in Tiffany turquoise were lovely but somewhat out of place, strips of ribbon hung from two ensembles like half-formed ideas.\n\nThankfully, there was some beautiful suiting that felt more on-brand for Beckham, with jackets that harked back to Yves Saint Laurent\u2019s 1967 Safari collection and shirts with the same pointed 1970s collars that reared their heads last season. Long, airy trench coats had immediate appeal and high-waisted kick-flare trousers elegantly elongated physiques. Houndstooth and tweed lent an English Heritage sensibility to pleated midi skirts, and a final ensemble: a white tuxedo with black buttons and a black flower corsage as bow tie oozed sophistication.\n\nShown a day after the launch of her highly anticipated eponymous make-up brand (a commercial no-brainer) that centres on sustainability and has already seen several products sell out, it was a collection that didn\u2019t quite know what it wanted to be, but one that signalled of interesting things to come, from a brand that is determined to remain in the game.", "description": "It was a new direction for Victoria Beckham in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office where she presented her collection for spring/summer 2020.
