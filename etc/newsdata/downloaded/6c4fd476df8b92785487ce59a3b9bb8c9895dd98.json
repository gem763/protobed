The X Factor is actually worth watching again", "language": "en", "text": "With its new celebrity lineup, and Simon Cowell\u2019s new look, The X Factor has accepted it\u2019s past its best \u2013 and become more fun than it has been for years\n\nLet\u2019s work on the assumption that you didn\u2019t watch The X Factor on Saturday. In fact, let\u2019s work on the assumption that you haven\u2019t watched The X Factor for several years \u2013 that you were gradually worn down by the repetition and the mediocrity and all of the relentless, empty, cynical bombast being flung in your face at a hundred miles an hour for hours at a time.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that\u2019s the case with you, because it\u2019s certainly the case with me. I stopped watching The X Factor in 2015 for exactly this reason, and I\u2019m someone who was paid to watch The X Factor. To put it another way, I had to quit my job because The X Factor was so bad.\n\nBut this year, The X Factor is trying something new. Gone are all the ambitious wannabes \u2013 the overlooked backing singers, the last-chance bar crooners, the shelf-stackers with dreams of superstardom \u2013 because in 2019 The X Factor has cleared the decks and reinvented itself as a celebrity singing contest. Where once it aspired to give the world its newest bonafide musical icon, it now appears that The X Factor is simply content to rehash the basic format of Soapstar Superstar. And, out of nothing but morbid, self-hating curiosity, I tuned in to see just how bad it was.\n\nBut here\u2019s the horrible truth. I didn\u2019t hate it. I didn\u2019t hate The X Factor. Now, let\u2019s be perfectly clear for a moment. I didn\u2019t love it. I won\u2019t be rewriting my end-of-year list or anything as drastic as that, but I watched 90 minutes of The X Factor on Saturday night and didn\u2019t find myself filled with a violent disdain for all of humanity as a direct result. Which is new.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Did Martin Bashir have the X Factor? ... Photograph: Dymond/Thames/Syco/REX/Shutterstock\n\nLet\u2019s set some proper expectations, though. None of the celebrities on The X Factor: Celebrity are celebrities. They\u2019re an awkward mix of reality stars, YouTubers and people who haven\u2019t been in the public eye for a couple of decades. But at least the show doesn\u2019t pretend otherwise. In fact, watching the celebrities attempt to justify their own existence to each other during their initial meeting was wildly entertaining. It was like watching a broken version of the Rizla Game where everyone had their own names written on their heads, while Dermot O\u2019Leary \u2013 having finally succumbed to the stupidity of his role \u2013 merrily Statler and Waldorf\u2013ed away from afar.\n\nThis set the tone of the entire show. The \u2018audition\u2019 round essentially took the form of a garden party at Simon Cowell\u2019s house. The celebrities got up on stage, did a bit of low-stakes karaoke for a loosened-up crowd, received approximately 30% too much praise for their performances then wandered off for a drink. Simon Cowell \u2013 who now for whatever reason has come to resemble a Monkey Christ fresco version of himself \u2013 was amiable and charming, knowing that his role might as well be filled by a stuffed monkey for all the good it does. And as a result, he\u2019s better than he has been for years.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest He has now come to resemble a Monkey Christ fresco version of himself ... Simon Cowell. Photograph: ITV\n\nSure, at times it fell into bad old patterns and tried to force a classic X Factor narrative on proceedings. Hayley (daughter of David) Hasselhoff is being painted as the hard-faced villain of the show, despite not really displaying many overtly villainous tendencies, and Martin Bashir\u2019sperformance of Nat King Cole\u2019s L-O-V-E would still have impressed without the preamble about his late brother, which veered slightly too hard towards the sob stories of old. But for the most part, nobody really seems to care very much. This is a version of The X Factor that\u2019s happy enough to coast along on charisma alone \u2013 it\u2019s the Ocean\u2019s 11 of X Factors.\n\nI might be reading too much into it, but the big theme here seems to be acceptance. The show knows that it\u2019s never going to beat Strictly in the ratings again. It knows that viewers are abandoning it by the truckload. It even seems to realise that it can\u2019t guarantee a number one single to the winner. The X Factor fought hard and lost and, rather than keep bursting its blood vessels trying to demonstrate how big and important it is, it\u2019s given up. The X Factor has accepted its place as a lower-tier, past-its-best entertainment show, and this has immediately made it five times better. It\u2019s more fun and loosey-goosey now. Watch, don\u2019t watch \u2013 it\u2019s up to you.\n\nWill I watch every episode of The X Factor this year? God, no. But does the thought of checking in on it from time to time fill me with dread like it has for the last few years? Also no. I don\u2019t seem to hate The X Factor any more.
