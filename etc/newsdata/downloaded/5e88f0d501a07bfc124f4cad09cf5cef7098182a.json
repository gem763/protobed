But Democrats still aren\u2019t sure if the country will be feeling the same way in November 2020.\n\nLeading Democratic strategists are greeting the increasing likelihood of President Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment with a mixture of resignation and determination. They acknowledge, almost uniformly, that their party has no choice but to impeach the president following reports that he tied military aide to Ukraine to an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son. But they remain unsure \u2015 and in some cases, deeply concerned \u2015 about the political impact of impeachment.\n\nFor now, Democrats are planning to move full speed ahead with their existing plan for 2020, which bears a striking resemblance to their successful 2018 campaign: a focus on health care, gun control and making the case that Trump is more focused on helping the rich than the middle class.\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, are publicly gleeful about the latest developments, and insist Democrats won\u2019t be able to get their broader message out to the public amid the impeachment focus.\n\nPriorities USA, the largest Democratic super PAC, had long argued against a focus on impeachment and the Russia scandal. But on Monday night, Guy Cecil, the group\u2019s chairman and top strategist, backed an impeachment inquiry.\n\nDonald Trump is abusing his power, breaking the law & destroying long-held norms. He has been enabled by an administration that has put power over duty and country. He has left Congress with no choice but to begin impeachment proceedings immediately. \u2014 Guy Cecil (@guycecil) September 24, 2019\n\nStill, the group, which is expected to play a leading role in attacking Trump in the runup to the 2020 election, doesn\u2019t plan to change strategies, and hasn\u2019t even been polling on impeachment. Other Democratic groups and candidates are adopting similar stances. The thought process is simple: If impeachment isn\u2019t popular, Democrats will focus on other topics. If it is popular, voters will know about it because of wall-to-wall media coverage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Congress\u2019 job to conduct oversight of the president and defend the Constitution, and it\u2019s our job to win an election,\u201d Priorities USA spokesman Josh Schwerin said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to stay focused on talking to voters about the kitchen-table issues that impact their lives every day. Our strategy hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic lawmakers leading the charge insisted they weren\u2019t considering the political fallout.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not thinking about that,\u201d Sen. Dick Durbin (Ill.), the second-highest ranking Democrat in the Senate, told HuffPost when asked about the political impact of impeachment. \u201cWe have a serious problem with our country right now.\u201d\n\nThe strategy can be seen in the behavior of the party\u2019s presidential candidates. While Biden himself said Congress should impeach the president if the Trump administration continues to stonewall Congress, his campaign has spent the week hammering the president on health care. Roughly an hour after Biden announced he\u2019d be making an on-camera appearance in Delaware on Tuesday, his team blasted out another release condemning Trump\u2019s work to undermine the open enrollment period for Obamacare.\n\n\u201cI will continue to focus my campaign not on how Donald Trump abused his power to come after my family, but on how he has turned his back on America\u2019s families,\u201d Biden said. \u201cDonald Trump has failed working people and middle class families in this country by trying to take away their health care, by giving tax cuts to the wealthiest, and by failing to combat the climate crisis head-on.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, meanwhile, has been publicly silent on impeachment. But the group did announce a new slate of digital ads attacking GOP senators for supporting Trump\u2019s move to take money away from military construction projects to pay for the border wall.\n\n\u201cRepublican Senators paved the way for this harmful raid on critical military construction funding, and they just knowingly voted again to uphold this bogus emergency declaration and allow the Trump administration to keep diverting money away from their own states,\u201d said Stewart Boss, the DSCC\u2019s press secretary.\n\nMany Democrats are confident impeachment will become at least marginally more popular in the short term, as members of the party who were skeptical rally around the process. But there were also signs of caution from the party\u2019s moderates.\n\nWhile more than a dozen of the 31 Democrats who represent districts won by Trump have endorsed starting an impeachment inquiry, there have been notable holdouts. Rep. Jared Golden, who won a mostly white, rural district in Maine by just over a percentage point in 2018 after the president won it by more than 10 percentage points in 2016, released a statement that carefully avoided using the \u201cI\u201d word. He instead emphasized the need for the White House to turn over to Congress a whistleblower complaint reportedly focused on the allegations against Trump.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t negotiable \u2015 it\u2019s the law. The House of Representatives must take every action necessary to combat this administration\u2019s stonewalling of the rule of law,\u201d Golden said. \u201cEnsuring that the Intelligence Committees receive the full text of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint is a necessary first step.\u201d\n\nJesse Ferguson, a Democratic strategist who has previously worked for Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said his party should emphasize Trump\u2019s threat to end legislative progress on trade, guns and other issues if impeachment moves forward.\n\n\u201cThat undercuts any ability the White House has to show the American people they\u2019re focused on what\u2019s important,\u201d he said.\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, have eagerly attacked Democrats for supporting an impeachment process that remains unpopular in public polling, predicting it would fire up the GOP base. The National Republican Campaign Committee greeted announcements of support for an impeachment inquiry with releases proclaiming that Rep. Andy Kim (D), who represents a swing district in Southern New Jersey, had committed \u201cpolitical suicide,\u201d and that Rep. Matt Cartwright (D), whose rural district in Pennsylvania backed Trump, had walked \u201coff a cliff.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have become so radicalized by their hatred of President Trump that they are willing to plunge the nation into a constitutional crisis based on secondhand gossip,\u201d NRCC Chair Tom Emmer said in a statement. \u201cDemocrats have lost their sanity and any remaining credibility with the American people. Make no mistake about it: backing impeachment will cost the Democrats their majority in 2020.\u201d", "description": "Republicans are publicly gleeful about the politics of impeachment, but its overall impact could be limited.", "authors": ["Senior Political Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8a65b42200003100fbf023.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
