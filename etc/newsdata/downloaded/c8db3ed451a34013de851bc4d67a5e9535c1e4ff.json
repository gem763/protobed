Because if Gregg would\u2019ve gotten the job here, I would\u2019ve requested a trade immediately.\u2019\u2019 Randall went so far as to say he \u2018\u2019hates\u2019\u2019 the former Browns defensive coordinator and interim coach. \u201cI\u2019m just not a fan of him,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cI\u2019ve just never been a fan of him. There will be no love Monday night at all, period.\u2019\u2019\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nRandall landed with the Browns last season as part of the trade that sent back-up quarterback DeShone Kizer to the Green Bay Packers. A former first-round pick, Randall posted a career year under Williams with his new team, with a career-high 85 tackles and four interceptions.\n\nClearly, he wasn\u2019t happy behind closed doors as Williams took over the team as interim head coach following the firing of Hue Jackson.\n\nNot a ringing endorsement with Gregg Williams under fire again\n\nRandall\u2019s assertion comes a day after Beckham claimed that his new Browns teammate had told him Williams ordered them to take out the All-Pro during a preseason game in 2017, Williams\u2019 first season as defensive coordinator with the team.\n\nThe reported order led to Beckham taking a very low hit from then-Browns cornerback Briean Boddy-Calhoun, resulting in a high-ankle sprain for Beckham to begin a season in which he ended up playing only four games.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cNobody in the NFL is really out to do stuff like that,\u201d Beckham said. \u201cI had players on this team telling me that\u2019s what he was telling them to do: Take me out of the game and it\u2019s preseason. You just know who he is.\u201d\n\nGregg Williams might not be very popular in the Browns locker room these days.

The NFL determined that Williams had created a fund that paid out to players who injured their opponents.\n\nBeckham\u2019s claim drew a denial from Williams on Friday, with a laughable helping of revisionist history.\n\nGregg Williams responds to Odell Beckham's comments: pic.twitter.com/3UuELtCLXN \u2014 SNY (@SNYtv) September 13, 2019\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t do that. I\u2019ve never done that anywhere I\u2019ve been,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWe don\u2019t do anything to hurt the team. It\u2019s the No. 1 primary thing. You\u2019re committing penalties, you\u2019re doing those type of stuff, we just don\u2019t do it. And you guys [in the media] are cooperating, giving [Beckham] attention. Just don\u2019t give him attention.\u201d\n\nGiven his past, Williams probably isn\u2019t going to receive much benefit of the doubt if another player is accusing him of encouraging dangerous hits.\n\nBetween Beckham\u2019s accusation, Randall\u2019s condemnation and more criticism from Browns wide receiver Jarvis Landry (\u201cWe know who he is. Everyone in the game knows who he is.\u201d), Williams might not have so many friendly handshakes at the end of Monday night\u2019s game between his current and former team.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Odell Beckham Jr. isn't the only player on the Cleveland Browns with a bone to pick with the former defensive coordinator and interim head coach.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/XGuEu98qzFwf1npzlYaNCg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTYuNTMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/pdTwPmHuVbFJJgF5jbJr_Q--~B/aD0yNzQ1O3c9NDEwNDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/1c1f1220-d68a-11e9-bfad-a1ef2b9e2f72", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
