Don\u2019t work too late.\"\n\nJ.R. Storment, a tech mogul, and Jessica Brandes, a physician, were a busy couple living in Portland with their twin 8-year-old boys Wiley and Oliver.\n\nOne morning last month, Brandes discovered Wiley had died in his sleep and had to call her husband at work to tell him.\n\nMELISSA JOAN HART SHARES 'FAVORITE MOMENT' FROM FAMILY'S MISSION TRIP TO AFRICA WITH WORLD VISION\n\nThey shared their story in separate essays on Linkedin.\n\n\u201cMy wife and I have an agreement that when one of us calls, the other answers,\u201d Storment wrote, recalling the tragic day. \u201cThe next thing I know I\u2019m sprinting out the front door of the office with my car keys in hand, running ferociously across the street.\u201d\n\nBODE MILLER, WIFE MORGAN BECK EXPECTING TWINS A YEAR AFTER TRAGIC DEATH OF YOUNG DAUGHTER\n\nBrandes wrote that after calling 911 she knew she had \u201capproximately 4 minutes to explain to Oliver that his best friend had died.\u201d\n\nOnce first responders confirmed Wiley\u2019s death, which is believed to be from SUDEP (Sudden Unexplained Death of Epilepsy), the parents had a limited amount of time to say goodbye.\n\n\"An eerie calm came over me. I laid down next to him in the bed that he loved, held his hand and kept repeating, \u2018What happened, buddy? What happened?'\u201d Storment wrote. \u201cWe stayed next to him for maybe 30 minutes and stroked his hair before they returned with a gurney to take him away.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur time was limited. It was not the way a parent should have to see their child, but it was all we had,\u201d Brandes added. \u201cI take solace in the fact that it was peaceful. Wiley was warm and happy and asleep in his favorite place next to someone who loved him,\" she wrote, referring to Oliver.\n\n\u201cOut of these ashes have come many new and restored connections,\u201d Storment wrote. \u201cAnd I hope from this tragedy you consider how you prioritize your own time.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cWhen it ends, there\u2019s just photos and leftover things and time is no longer available to you,\u201d Brandes added. \u201cIt is priceless and should not be squandered. Take your vacation days and sabbaticals and go be with them. You will not regret the emails you forgot to send.\u201d", "description": "After losing their 8-year-old son in his sleep last month, an Oregon couple is urging\u00a0parents\u00a0to \u201cHug your kids.
