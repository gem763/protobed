The others who have done it: Miguel Cabrera, Andruw Jones and Mickey Mantle. Cabrera\u2019s 2003 Marlins and Mantle\u2019s 1952 Yankees won. Jones\u2019 1996 Braves lost;\n\n18 of the last 22 teams to win Game 1 of the World Series have gone on to win it all.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThose first two are just neat trivia. The last one is a bit more foreboding for the Astros. The last two, I guess, can go together in that the World Series in which Andruw Jones homered at age 20 was also a World Series in which the team which won Game 1 \u2014 and Game 2 for that matter \u2014 lost, with the 1996 Braves falling to the Yankees. Encouraging on some level? I dunno. What do you do when your invincible hero gets beat up by a kid? You reach a bit, I suppose.\n\nYou also turn to the next hero and hope for better things:\n\nThe Game: World Series Game 2: Washington Nationals vs. Houston Astros\n\nThe Time: 8:08 PM Eastern\n\nThe Ballpark: Minute Maid Park, Houston Texas\n\nThe Network: Fox\n\nThe Starters: Stephen Strasburg vs. Justin Verlander\n\nThe Upshot:\n\nAnother night, another fantastic starting pitching matchup, with two Cy Young Award candidates \u2014 really, if either of them finish lower than second in the voting in their respective leagues it\u2019ll be an upset \u2014 facing off.\n\nThere is obviously pressure on Justin Verlander here, as it\u2019ll be a Very Bad Thing if the Astros fall down 0-2, at home no less, in this series.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut there is also pressure on Stephen Strasburg. Not just in a \u201cevery game in the World Series is laden with pressure\u201d way, but in a \u201cthe Nationals really, really need him to go deep into this game\u201d way.\n\nWashington won last night, but they did so in a way that reveals one of their weaknesses. Max Scherzer got the win but he labored, only going five innings on over 100 pitches. Because Dave Martinez really only has two relievers he can trust in Daniel Hudson and Sean Doolittle, he made the bold move to use presumptive Game 3 starter Patrick Corbin for an inning of relief. It worked and, since he only threw 21 pitches the Nats can probably call it a defacto bullpen side session between starts and can count on him in Game 3. But Martinez, not wanting to stretch Corbin, also had to use Tanner Rainey \u2014 who gave up a run \u2014 as a bridge to Hudson \u2014 who gave up a run \u2014 and Doolittle. The two big guns each had to go longer than an inning.\n\nWhich is to say that the Nats would really prefer not to have to rely too much on their bullpen this evening. Or, if they do have to do that, they\u2019d really prefer it not to be a close game, so they can maybe get some of their lower leverage arms some work to save the higher leverage arms for later. There are only so many starting pitchers you can press into service when you\u2019re playing a best-of-seven series over nine days.\n\nThe one they have going tonight, though, is a good one who is 3-0 with a 1.64 ERA in the 2019 postseason. He has also given the Nats nineteen innings in his three starts, so there\u2019s reason to believe he can do exactly what is needed to be done here. It\u2019s just a matter of executing.\n\nAs for Houston: if Stephen Strasburg shuts them down and Justin Verlander can\u2019t get the job done, hoo boy, they\u2019re in some serious trouble. They will have fired their two best bullets to no effect and will have to go on the road with their third starter, albeit a better-than-usual third starter, and Brad Peacock/bullpen arms in the first two games in hostile territory. Not what you want.\n\nBut, as is the case with Washington and Strasburg, the Astros should have confidence in their co-ace. Tonight\u2019s start will be Verlander\u2019s 30th career postseason appearance. He\u2019s 14-9 with a 3.26 ERA in the playoffs and. While his 1-2, 3.70 ERA this postseason is not a Verlander-esque line, he has still held opposing batters to a .205 average and a 1.07 WHIP. Not bad given the level of competition and the pressure. He\u2019s going to be tough for Nats hitters to deal with. And, if he\u2019s smart, he\u2019s not gonna give Juan Soto a good pitch to hit all night.\n\nIt\u2019s an overused phrase in sports, but we\u2019re facing the proverbial \u201cpivotal Game 2.\u201d An Astros win \u2014 especially one that has Strasburg leaving earlier than he planned \u2014 essentially re-sets the series. A Nats win \u2014 especially one in which the Nats bullpen can be re-set \u2014 puts Houston in a big hole.", "description": "The deeper into the game Stephen Strasburg goes, the deeper the hole in which the Astros will find themselves becomes", "authors": ["Craig Calcaterra"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/p3TXb6z4_kvO1MRt6gEKaw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MDcuMg--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9FTcAgYEv5OKO4mYkYX4BA--~B/aD0xMDYwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/d7727de3f49954a56c844f9294c22dc2", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
