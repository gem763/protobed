As Vaccaro was going to the ground, Robinson extended his leg and kicked Vaccaro in the face mask.\n\nAfter a review, Robinson was ejected from the game.\n\nHere's a video of the play:\n\nIt's unclear if Robinson will face further discipline.\n\nIt was an ugly Week 1 for the much-hyped Browns. The team committed 18 penalties for a total of 158 yards. Baker Mayfield also tossed three fourth-quarter interceptions, as the Browns lost 43-13.", "description": "The Browns' Greg Robinson kicked the Titans' Kenny Vaccaro in the face mask during a pile-up and was ejected after a review.", "authors": ["Scott Davis"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7667642e22af77374cd1b8-750-375.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
