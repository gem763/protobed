Such a one sided Witch Hunt going on in USA. Deep State. Shameful!\"\n\nTrump's comments came after news broke Friday in The New York Times that federal prosecutors are investigating Giuliani for potential lobbying law violations as it relates to his work in Ukraine. The Times, citing two anonymous people \"familiar with the inquiry,\" reported the probe focuses on Giuliani's efforts to \"undermine\" former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie L. Yovanovitch, who testified before three House committees Friday in the impeachment inquiry of Trump.\n\nSo now they are after the legendary \u201ccrime buster\u201d and greatest Mayor in the history of NYC, Rudy Giuliani. He may seem a little rough around the edges sometimes, but he is also a great guy and wonderful lawyer. Such a one sided Witch Hunt going on in USA. Deep State. Shameful! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 12, 2019\n\nThe investigation of Giuliani is also, the Times reports, linked to Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, Ukrainian-born business partners arrested Wednesday in connection with alleged schemes to funnel foreign money to U.S. political campaigns. Parnas and Fruman helped Giuliani meet former Ukrainian prosecutor Yuri Lutsenko as the president's personal lawyer pushed for an investigation into Trump's political rival Joe Biden.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry of Trump, which is tied to the president's efforts to get Ukraine to investigate political rivals like Biden, has drawn attention to Giuliani and whether his activities in Ukraine violate a federal law that requires Americans who work on behalf of foreign governments to register with the Justice Department.\n\nGiuliani defended himself against such a crime by claiming to the Times he was working for Trump, not a foreign government.\n\n\u201cLook, you can try to contort anything into anything, but if they have any degree of objectivity or fairness, it would be kind of ridiculous to say I was doing it on Lutsenko\u2019s behalf when I was representing the president of the United States,\u201d Giuliani told the Times.\n\nGiuliani said Saturday that he has had no contact with federal prosecutors in Manhattan, but he said any such scrutiny was likely politically motivated.\n\n\u201cNo, nothing but leaks,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cIt\u2019s a political attack, otherwise why leak it. If it\u2019s an appropriate law enforcement investigation, you try to keep it secret so the subjects aren\u2019t alerted.\u201d\n\nTrump and Giuliani: Donald Trump distances himself from Rudy Giuliani: 'He has been my attorney'\n\nJon Sale, a former Watergate prosecutor whom Giuliani hired to represent him in the impeachment inquiry, told USA TODAY on Friday that he\u2019s not aware of an investigation into Giuliani. He said Giuliani has not been contacted by investigators in New York.\n\nRepresentatives for Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman did not immediately respond to inquiries from USA TODAY. A spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in the Southern District of New York declined to confirm Friday if Giuliani is under investigation, only saying that the probe into Parnas and Fruman is ongoing.\n\nGiuliani declined to comment on his dealings with Parnas and Fruman, saying they are his clients and much of their communications are bound by attorney-client privilege.\n\nOn Friday, Yovanovitch \u2013 a career diplomat \u2013 spent hours on Capitol Hill giving a deposition for House Democrats' impeachment inquiry.\n\nIn her opening remarks, Yovanovitch said she was told by a high-ranking agency official \"that the president had lost confidence in me and no longer wished me to serve as his ambassador.\"\n\nThe State Department official \"added that there had been a concerted campaign against me, and that the department had been under pressure from the president to remove me since the Summer of 2018,\" according to her statement. \"He also said that I had done nothing wrong and that this was not like other situations where he had recalled ambassadors for cause. I departed Ukraine for good this past May.\"", "description": "\"So now they are after the legendary 'crime buster'\u00a0and greatest Mayor in the history of NYC, Rudy Giuliani,\" Trump wrote in a tweet on Saturday.", "authors": ["Sean Rossman", "David Jackson", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/VKFLRl3Y68bTHQ6PCqemmQ--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://d.yimg.com/hd/cp-video-transcode/1009217/aa38d5bf-0501-447f-970f-d3417321bb0d/8bdd0ad7-0401-5424-b39a-5a5a07b3ba8f/data_3_0.jpg?s=561e9232eaa3344845c87596d83ca4c5&c=367cc3a360e82cc3327a0b92fe6bfa8e&a=tripleplay4us&mr=0", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
