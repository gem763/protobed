Here\u2019s what we know so far.\n\nIt\u2019s the most destructive storm to hit Abaco and Grand Bahama Islands.\n\nThe Washington Post reported last week that \u201cDorian will go down in infamy as being the most destructive storm to hit Grand Bahama Island or Great Abaco Island.\u201d The hurricane\u2019s onslaught was particularly acute because it stalled over Abaco and and Grand Bahama, hardly moving as it continued to wreak havoc (the hurricane reportedly pummeled the Bahamas for more than two days).\n\nResearch shows that climate change is instigating stronger, more deadly storms. Recent powerful hurricanes have also increasingly been stagnating once they make landfall. The connection between stalled hurricanes and climate change is still under consideration. One hypothesis being studied, according to PBS, is that rising temperatures at the poles are reducing winds that in the past carried hurricanes briskly along.\n\nOn Tuesday Denis McClean, a spokesperson for the U.N. Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, said of the connection between more powerful hurricanes and climate change:\n\n\u201cThis is the fourth consecutive year that we have witnessed an extremely devastating Atlantic hurricane season, including Category 5 hurricanes like Dorian. The sequence cannot be divorced from the fact that these last five years have been the hottest ever recorded because of the continuing rise in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Hurricane Dorian crystallizes the existential threat posed to small island developing states by the ongoing climate emergency. This is an enormous humanitarian and development challenge for the Bahamas.\u201d\n\nThe scope of the damage is still unknown.\n\nAs of Sunday night, the official death toll is 44.\n\nUp to 90 percent of buildings in the most damaged areas were destroyed. Across the Abaco and Grand Bahama islands a reported 70,000 people have been made homeless and in need of food and water. CNN reports that there is no power or running water on the islands. Access to uncontaminated water is of urgent concern. A resident of Abaco named Matthew Taylor told the Nassau Guardian on Saturday, \u201cIt\u2019s unlivable. After the water is gone, what do you do? You know, you have bodies contaminating the water and stuff like that, so the water is undrinkable. That\u2019s where the panic is now.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Bahamian government, some 3,500 evacuees, most of them displaced from Abaco and Grand Bahama, have made their way to the capital of Nassau. The New York Times reports that the Abacos, which bore the full brunt of the category 5 hurricane and is one of the most devastated areas, is home to many impoverished Haitian immigrants living in shantytowns.\n\nThe official number of missing people remains unknown.\n\nOfficials told the New York Times on Sunday that no estimate of the number of missing people is currently available, given that Bahamian government workers continue to receive reports of missing and trapped individuals and search the storm debris for bodies. The Times reported from Marsh Harbour that a week after Dorian hit several bodies are clearly visible on the ground and yet \u201cofficials could not be reached for comment on why the bodies have not yet been collected.\u201d\n\nSome have asserted that the lack of information indicates a government cover-up of the full damage. Bahamian health minister Duane Sands responded to such speculations on Sunday saying that providing an official body count at this time is simply \u201cnot a priority\u201d due to the immense scope of the disaster. Sands told the Miami Herald:\n\n\u201cThe priority is find those people for their loved ones who are missing them; to take care, provide comfort to those people who are hurt, who are suffering, that\u2019s the priority. To put food in people\u2019s bellies, water in their throat.\u201d\n\nThe geography of the Bahamas, an archipelago consisting of some 700 islands and cays, has further frustrated the disaster relief response. Sands told the Herald, \u201cWe are talking about a massive, multi-island operation. We could not land a fixed-wing airplane until two days ago. The harbor was not available because of debris. Most of the vehicles on the ground were destroyed because they were under water. I need people to understand the logistics of this.\u201d\n\nThe United States government is reportedly turning away some evacuees.\n\nThousands of people evacuated by air and sea over the weekend, many of them to the United States, but not all found safe harbor in this country.\n\nOn Sunday CNN affiliate WSVN reporter Brian Entin posted footage on Twitter of what appears to be U.S. border control officials informing a ferry full of evacuees leaving Freeport for Fort Lauderdale that anyone without a U.S. visa must disembark. The announcement reportedly resulted in dozens of evacuees being forced off the boat.\n\nAnother announcement just made ordering any Bahamian without a US visa to disembark ferry \u2014 not allowed to evacuate. They were told before boarding it was ok with Bahamian passport and clean polce record. Something has now changed. pic.twitter.com/m7CnZxoiMM \u2014 Brian Entin (@BrianEntin) September 9, 2019\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) responded to these reports in a statement on Sunday:\n\n\u201cCBP was notified of a vessel preparing to embark an unknown number of passengers in Freeport and requested that the operator of the vessel coordinate with U.S. and Bahamian government officials in Nassau before departing The Bahamas\u2026. Everyone who arrives to the United States from another country must present themselves to a CBP officer for inspection at an official CBP Port of Entry. All persons must possess valid identity and travel documents.\u201d\n\nAs of Monday morning, CBP Florida was reportedly blaming the incident on the ferry company.", "description": "What we know so far about the damage wrought by hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas where thousands have been left without homes, food, and water.", "authors": ["Hannah Gold"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/09/09-bahamas-hurricane-dorrian.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
