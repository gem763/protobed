This week, criminals actually declared open season on the Mexican government\u2014and won.\n\nAs part of an ongoing campaign against the country\u2019s powerful cartels, Mexican security forces arrested two sons of former Sinaloa cartel kingpin Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman in mid-October. Presently, the elder Guzman languishes in a maximum security prison in the United States. Mexican officials seemed to believe that taking his sons out of commission might sound the death knell for the rump Sinaloa organization.\n\nIt proved to be disastrous. Multiple battles soon erupted between government forces and cartel gunmen in the streets of Culiacan, Sinaloa\u2019s state capital. The cartel attackers quickly freed Ivan, the eldest son. Ivan then launched an all-out siege of Culiacan in an effort to free his younger brother, Ovidio. Writing in the Federalist, analyst John Daniel Davidson described the chaotic situation:\n\nThe ensuing scene could have been mistaken for Syria or Yemen. Footage posted on social media showed burning vehicles spewing black smoke, heavily armed gunmen blocking roads, dead bodies strewn in the streets, and residents fleeing for cover amid high-caliber gunfire. Advertisement Armed with military-grade weapons and driving custom-built armored vehicles, cartel henchmen targeted security forces throughout Culiacan, launching more than one dozen separate attacks on Mexican security forces. They captured and held hostage eight soldiers, then kidnapped their families. Amid the fighting, an unknown number of inmates escaped from a nearby prison. At least eight people were killed and more than a dozen were injured. The eight-hour battle ended when government forces, outgunned and surrounded, without reinforcements or a way to retreat, received an order directly from Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to release their prisoner and surrender.\n\nIoan Grillo, a longtime expert on Mexico\u2019s drug trade and its accompanying violence, provided a similar picture, and stressed its depressing implications. He noted that\n\nthe cartel gunmen were everywhere. They openly drove in trucks with mounted machine guns, blockaded streets flashing their Kalashnikovs and burned trucks, unleashing plumes of smoke like it was a scene in Syria. They took control of the strategic points in the metro area, shut down the airport, roads, and government buildings and exchanged fire with security forces for hours, leaving at least eight people dead. In contrast, everyone else had to act like ghosts, hiding behind locked doors, not daring to step outside. Mexico Must Stand Up to America\u2019s Drug War\n\nEl Chapo: Another Case for Ending the Drug War\n\nThis was all happening barely 600 miles from America\u2019s Southern border. Drug cartel forces defeated troops of Obrador\u2019s newly created National Guard in a full-blown battle. Yet U.S. press coverage was minimal\u2014utterly dwarfed by the attention devoted to developments in Syria. That imbalance needs to change and change quickly.\n\nThe overall level of drug-related violence in Mexico has reached horrifying levels, exceeding even those that characterized the 2006-2012 period during President Felipe Calderon\u2019s misbegotten militarized anti-drug crusade. Homicides, the vast majority of which are related to the drug trade, exceeded 33,300 in 2018. That was a whopping one-third increase over 2017, which was itself a record year. During the first half of 2019, the carnage came at a similar pace. Even before the 2019 figures were released, more than 135,000 victims had perished since 2012, when Calderon left office.\n\nThe Sinaloa cartel may not even be the Mexican government\u2019s most capable adversary. At the zenith of El Chapo\u2019s power, his organization controlled an estimated 50 percent of Mexico\u2019s illegal drug trade. That dominance reduced the number and virulence of turf fights. Not only was there a declining number of rival cartels, but the remaining players hesitated to confront Guzman\u2019s daunting power. His capture, extradition, and imprisonment has amounted to a hollow victory for both Mexico and the United States. The struggle for lucrative trafficking routes is now unprecedented in its scope and virulence, as at least seven gangs vie for dominance.\n\nThe ascendant power appears to be the Jalisco New Generation cartel (better known by its Spanish acronym, CJNG). That group is renowned for a ruthlessness and level of sadistic violence that exceeds nearly anything Sinaloa or its competitors have exhibited. One analyst concludes that CJNG is clearly winning the \u201cnarco game of thrones.\u201d Moreover, a transformation in the fighting capabilities of CJNG and other cartels makes them an increasingly potent threat to the authority of the Mexican government.\n\nGrillo emphasizes that the Culiacan episode was the result of a trend over many years in which the cartels have developed deadly \u201cinsurgent tactics.\u201d He notes that \u201cthe use of burning vehicles to block roads was taken from militant protesters; cartels use it to stop the movement of troops and put pressure on the government.\u201d Perhaps most alarming, Grillo contends, the cartels \u201chave armed up with stolen military weapons.\u201d What occurred in Culiacan, he adds, \u201cwasn\u2019t gangster action; it was a mass insurrection.\u201d\n\nRaul Benitez, an expert on Latin America\u2019s armed conflicts, warns that \u201cthe Sinaloa Cartel demonstrated a tremendous ability to mobilize rapidly and take effective control of the city.\u201d The implications are profound, Benitez concludes. Armed cartel personnel \u201cshowed that in Sinaloa, they are the ones who run things.\u201d\n\nDavidson contends that \u201cthe battle of Culiacan marks a turning point in the collapse of the Mexican state. There is now no doubt about who is in control of Sinaloa.\u201d Like Grillo, he believes that \u201cwhat\u2019s happening in Mexico right now is more like an insurgency\u201d than a typical turf fight in the long-raging drug war. In his view, \u201cMexico is now on a trajectory to become a vast gangland governed more by warlordism than by the state.\u201d\n\nSuch a dire conclusion is somewhat premature. Despite previous predictions that Mexico was on the brink of becoming a failed state, the society and political system have proven to be surprisingly resilient. Nevertheless, the spike in drug war-related fatalities over the past four years, the growing strength of the CJNG, and especially the emergence of sophisticated insurgent tactics by the cartels (as exemplified in the Culiacan battle) are all extremely alarming developments.\n\nThe United States has an emerging crisis in a country on its own border. U.S. leaders and the American news media need to pay far more attention to this ominous trend, instead of being obsessed with events halfway around the world that have marginal relevance (at most) to the republic\u2019s security.\n\nTed Galen Carpenter, a senior fellow in security studies at the Cato Institute and regular contributing editor at The American Conservative, is the author of 13 books on international issues, including two books on drug violence and corruption in Latin America: Bad Neighbor Policy Washington\u2019s Futile War on Drugs in Latin America (2003), and The Fire Next Door: Mexico\u2019s Drug Violence and the Danger to America (2012).", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/mexico.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
