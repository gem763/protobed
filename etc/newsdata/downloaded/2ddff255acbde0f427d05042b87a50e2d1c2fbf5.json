Mandatory Credit: Reinhold Matay-USA TODAY Sports\n\n\u201cWell, I think he\u2019s going to be playing this week, so hopefully you\u2019ll tune into the Saints game,\u201d Khan told The Street, a business website, in a video interview Thursday. .\u201d.. I met him a couple of days ago, had a heart-to-heart, and I think we\u2019ll be able to come to whatever makes sense for all.\u201d\n\nESPN reported later Thursday that Ramsey is still \u201cgoing to listen to his body,\u201d and nothing has changed about his desire to be traded. Ramsey, 24, was limited at practice with a back injury for the second straight day, after sitting out the last two weeks due to the ailment.\n\nKhan has been vocal about his desire not to trade Ramsey, who requested a trade after Week 2. Reports have said the team was seeking a minimum of two first-round picks, but Khan prefers to keep Ramsey and sign him to a long-term contract.\n\n\u2014As Rob Gronkowski made his debut as an NFL analyst for FOX, New England owner Robert Kraft says he is still holding out hope that the former Patriots tight end will return to the field.\n\n\u201cWe all love Gronk, and I think the bottom line is he hasn\u2019t put his retirement papers in,\u201d Kraft said on NFL Network\u2019s \u201cNFL Gameday Kickoff\u201d ahead of New England\u2019s matchup with the New York Giants.\n\nWhen pressed by his fellow FOX co-hosts about a possible return, Gronk repeated several times that, \u201cSo I\u2019ll always keep it open. I\u2019ll always keep it open. I\u2019ll always keep it open. I\u2019ll always keep the door open.\u201d\n\n\u2014Representatives for quarterback Colin Kaepernick released a two-page statement \u201cto address the false narratives\u201d regarding their client and his efforts to join an NFL team.\n\nThe statement listed several of Kaepernick\u2019s stats and accomplishments, comparing many of them to quarterbacks currently starting in the NFL, and added that no team has offered Kaepernick a job or brought him in for a workout since the 2016 season. It noted that the Seattle Seahawks brought Kaepernick in for a visit, but did not work him out.\n\n\u2014Los Angeles Rams running back Todd Gurley missed his second straight practice with a left thigh contusion, putting his status in question for Sunday\u2019s game against the San Francisco 49ers. NFL Network reported earlier in the day that Gurley\u2019s status was \u201cvery much up in the air.\u201d\n\n\u2014Undrafted rookie Devlin Hodges took snaps with the first-team offense for the second straight day and looks on track to be the starting quarterback when Pittsburgh visits the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday night. Mason Rudolph continues to deal with the effects of a concussion sustained last Sunday.\n\n\u2014Sitting at 2-3, the Cleveland Browns saw their irritation aired through some players\u2019 comments \u2014 particularly regarding the amount of touches star wideout Odell Beckham Jr. is receiving. Beckham has four catches for 47 yards the last two games combined.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not calling plays or designing anything,\u201d fellow wideout and college teammate Jarvis Landry said, according to the (Cleveland) Plain Dealer. \u201cBut at the end of the day, obviously he\u2019s a key part of our offense whether the ball\u2019s in his hands or not. ... We haven\u2019t really been making enough plays without him touching the ball.\u201d\n\n\u2014Shortly after Cincinnati wideout A.J. Green returned to the practice field for the first time since injuring his ankle in late July, coach Zac Taylor insisted the seven-time Pro Bowler won\u2019t be moved at the Oct. 29 trade deadline. He could make his season debut in Week 7 when the Jaguars visit.\n\n\u2014Green Bay Packers wideout Davante Adams told reporters he\u2019s \u201cnot sure just yet\u201d if he\u2019ll be able to play Monday at home against Detroit after missing last week with a turf toe injury.\n\n\u2014After missing practice Wednesday, Carolina Panthers running back Christian McCaffrey was a full participant and is expected to be on the field Sunday in London against Tampa Bay. McCaffrey injured his back somersaulting into the end zone last week.\n\n\u2014The NFL rescinded the $21,056 fine levied to New York Jets safety Jamal Adams for his hit on Cleveland quarterback Baker Mayfield in Week 2 following Adams\u2019 appeal, multiple media outlets reported.\n\n\u2014New England running back Rex Burkhead missed his second straight game with a foot injury against the New York Giants.\n\n\u2014The Giants promoted Austin Walter from the practice squad to be their third running back for their game against the Patriots. Star Saquon Barkley (high ankle sprain) missed his third straight game and backup Wayne Gallman (concussion) is also sidelined.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Jacksonville Jaguars owner Shad Khan expects Jalen Ramsey to play on Sunday against the New Orleans Saints, but an ESPN report suggests the cornerback isn't so sure.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439513403&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A04C-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
