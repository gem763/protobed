The engineering giant faced corruption charges over past dealings with the Gadhafi regime in Libya.\n\nThe minister in question, Jody Wilson-Raybould, had been demoted and later resigned. More resignations followed the news. The ensuing uproar was disastrous for Trudeau\u2019s reputation, but slowly faded to the background.\n\nThat was until Canada\u2019s ethics commissioner ruled yesterday that Trudeau violated ethics regulations by intervening in the case.\n\nTrudeau insists that he was merely \u201cstanding up for Canadians jobs.\u201d It's true that many were at stake; if convicted, SNC-Lavalin would have been banned from government contracts for 10 years.\n\nBut that argument didn\u2019t convince voters back in February, when the Liberals \u201clost about 10\u201312 points almost overnight,\u201d says Darrell Bricker of Ipsos Public Affairs.\n\nWhy it matters: Bricker says the SNC-Lavalin affair is now the dominant issue in a campaign that will ultimately be a referendum on Trudeau.\n\n\"The No. 1 asset that the Liberals have going for them is Justin Trudeau. He is their brand. It\u2019s not a great place to be starting an election campaign from.\u201d\n\nThe flipside: Trudeau\u2019s main opponent, former parliamentary speaker Andrew Scheer, is hoping to capitalize. He called Trudeau's actions \"unforgivable.\"\n\nScheer cuts a low profile. While his proposals so far have been relatively moderate, Bricker says, \u201cthere\u2019s a lack of awareness about who he is or what he stands for.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe narrative the Liberals are pushing hard is that he becomes \u2018Trump North,\u2019 or more accurately Doug Ford at the federal level.\u201d Ford is the populist, right-wing, and deeply controversial premier of Ontario.\n\nWhat to watch: While Scheer\u2019s political identity is still taking shape, Trudeau\u2019s has been called into question.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s a word that describes the last 4 years and Justin Trudeau\u2019s performance, I think generally that would be \u2018disappointment,\u2019\u201d Bricker says.\n\nThe big question, Bricker continues, is whether the scandal is already \"factored in\" for voters. If so, Trudeau\u2019s skills as a campaigner put him in a strong position to win. If not, \"he\u2019s in really big trouble.\u201d\n\nThe bottom line: Bricker says the rock star image \u2014 magazine covers, viral videos \u2014 that Trudeau projects globally was embraced by Canadians 4 years ago. Now, many view him as out of touch or unserious.\n\n\"The picture is the same. He\u2019s always done the same thing. What\u2019s changed is how people look at him now.\"", "description": "The global rockstar could be a one-term prime minister.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/2I-9sUM1sKuh_bTS2FLEb-73paM=/0x313:3000x2000/1920x1080/2019/08/15/1565909114695.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-15"}
