What evidence of a crime do you have?\u2019\u201d former acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker told Fox News. \u201cI mean, the Constitution, you know, sort of \u2014 abuse of power is not a crime.\u201d\n\nWhitaker\u2019s argument is simple enough. Article II, Section 4 of the US Constitution details the impeachment power, and it reads short and sharp. \u201cThe President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\u201d\n\nWhat Whitaker is trying to do is define high crimes and misdemeanors as, well, crimes. Acts that violate the criminal code. I\u2019ll leave it to others to argue whether Trump\u2019s acts were criminal, but what\u2019s inarguable is that Whitaker is wrong about the meaning of the term \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d\n\nMatthew Whitaker: Abuse of power is not a crime pic.twitter.com/IJsEwRTs8N \u2014 Acyn Torabi (@Acyn) October 23, 2019\n\nTo modern ears, \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d is a weird phrase. Isn\u2019t a misdemeanor, by definition, a minor infraction? As Judge Richard Posner wrote in his book An Affair of State: The Investigation, Impeachment, and Trial of President Clinton, the formula, read according to modern definitions, collapses into incoherence: \u201ceither \u2018high Crimes and low Crimes\u2019 or \u2018high Crimes and high low Crimes.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhich is a clue that modern definitions are not sufficient. We have to go back to what the words meant when they were added to the Constitution, and how they\u2019ve been interpreted throughout US history. In that light, the conclusion is inescapable. Abuse of power may not be a crime. But it is, indisputably, a high crime and misdemeanor.\n\nHow \u201chigh Crimes and Misdemeanors\u201d made it into the Constitution\n\nIn his excellent study \u201cIndispensable Remedy: The Broad Scope of the Constitution\u2019s Impeachment Power,\u201d the Cato Institute\u2019s Gene Healy traces the constitutional arguments that led to the final formulation.\n\nThe first question was whether there should be an impeachment power at all. Some delegates opposed it, but their objections were quickly dispatched. \u201cNo point is of more importance than that the right of impeachment should be continued,\u201d George Mason said. The issue at hand, he said, wasn\u2019t merely, \u201cShall any man be above Justice?\u201d It was whether \u201cthat man be above it, who can commit the most extensive injustice?\u201d\n\nThe next question, then, was on what grounds impeachment would be merited. A number of formulations were proposed and rejected. \u201cMalpractice or neglect of duty.\u201d \u201cMal- and corrupt administration.\u201d \u201cTreason, bribery, or corruption.\u201d \u201cNeglect of duty, malversation, or corruption.\u201d Eventually, the 11-delegate committee charged with the section offered the narrower \u201cTreason, or bribery.\u201d\n\nAs the delegates considered this, Mason argued that \u201cattempts to subvert the Constitution may not be treason,\u201d and proposed adding \u201cmaladministration.\u201d James Madison replied that maladministration was too \u201cvague,\u201d leading Mason to withdraw the suggestion, and replace it with \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d The suggestion passed, 8 votes to 3.\n\nBut was high crimes and misdemeanors truly less vague than maladministration? As Healy notes, in the Commentaries on the Laws of England, a legal reference book that Madison said was \u201cin every man\u2019s hand\u201d at the Convention, the first example given of a \u201chigh misdemeanor\u201d was, yes, maladministration. And later, as a member of Congress, Madison would argue that the president could and should be impeached for the \u201cwanton removal of meritorious officers.\u201d\n\nThere are two lessons to be drawn from this history. One is it\u2019s a reminder that the men who wrote the Constitution were just men. They were packed in hot rooms, sitting through long meetings, trying to find compromises that would win over a majority of their colleagues. The Constitution was written by committee, and documents written by committee often sacrifice clarity for consensus.\n\nBut the bigger lesson is that \u201cmisdemeanors\u201d did not mean then what it means now. In 1828, Webster\u2019s defined it as \u201cill behavior; evil conduct; fault; mismanagement.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a light crime, but an abusive act.\n\nWhat \u201chigh Crimes and Misdemeanors\u201d has meant through American history\n\nThe first federal official ever removed from office under the impeachment clause was Judge John Pickering, in 1803. Pickering was an alcoholic and likely suffered from early-stage dementia. He would rant and rave from the bench. The official charges held that Pickering exhibited \u201cloose morals and intemperate habits\u201d and presided over court \u201cin a state of total intoxication,\u201d neither of which sounds like a high crime or misdemeanor to modern ears. He was convicted on all counts and removed from office.\n\nIn his 1833 Commentaries, Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story concluded that impeachment is \u201cof a political character\u201d and can be triggered by \u201cgross neglect, or usurpation, or habitual disregard of the public interests, in the discharge of the duties of political office.\u201d\n\nThis has continued through to the modern day. A 2015 Congressional Research Service report surveyed every House impeachment in American history and concluded that \u201cless than a third have specifically invoked a criminal statute or used the term \u2018crime.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn 1974, as the House Judiciary Committee prepared for the Nixon impeachment, it released a report surveying past impeachments, and concluded that the behavior Congress has traditionally considered impeachable fell into three categories:\n\n1) Exceeding the constitutional bounds of the powers of the office in derogation of the powers of another branch of government; 2) behaving in a manner grossly incompatible with the proper function and purpose of the office; and 3) employing the power of the office for an improper purpose or for financial gain.\n\nThis is not as helpful as it might be. Most modern presidencies have arguably exceeded the constitutional bounds of the office. Numbers two and three are judgment calls as well. The best the House Judiciary Committee could do was embrace the ambiguity. \u201cThe longing for precise criteria is understandable,\u201d they wrote, but misguided. When it comes to presidential misconduct, \u201cthe crucial factor is not the intrinsic quality of behavior but the significance of its effect upon our constitutional system or the functioning of our government.\u201d\n\nPause on that for a moment. \u201cThe significance of the effect.\u201d A similar idea shows up in the definitions other legal scholars offer, too.\n\nIn Impeachment: A Citizen\u2019s Guide, Cass Sunstein says that the impeachment power applies to the \u201cegregious violation of the public trust while in office.\u201d\n\nIn Impeachment: A Handbook, Charles Black Jr. says high crimes and misdemeanors describe offenses that \u201cso seriously threaten the order of political society as to make pestilent and dangerous the continuance in power of their perpetrator.\u201d\n\nIn To End a Presidency, Laurence Tribe and Joshua Matz write, \u201cimpeachable offenses involve corruption, betrayal or an abuse of power that ... risk grave injury to the nation.\u201d\n\nWhen I asked Gene Healy for his simplest definition, he said, \u201cHigh crimes and misdemeanors are serious misconduct that demonstrates in officials unfitness to hold high office or to wield power.\u201d\n\nAbusing power to keep power\n\nIn Federalist 65, Alexander Hamilton argues that impeachment concerns abuses primarily \u201cpolitical\u201d in nature. It\u2019s easy to read that as a tautology: Of course a politician\u2019s offenses will be political in nature. A clearer way to put his point is that impeachable offenses are those that endanger the political system itself.\n\nThe point of impeachment isn\u2019t to punish the president but to protect the political system. Offenses that endanger the system \u2014 that undermine elections, that corrupt the functions of government, that break constitutional boundaries \u2014 cannot be left to elections because they warp elections.\n\nThat is, of course, what we are seeing today. Donald Trump\u2019s plan was explicitly to force a statement from the president of Ukraine saying that his political rival Joe Biden was under investigation for corruption. If the scheme had worked \u2014 and it nearly did \u2014 the election itself would have been compromised. When Black spoke of offenses that \u201cso seriously threaten the order of political society as to make pestilent and dangerous the continuance in power of their perpetrator,\u201d this is the kind of offense he described: an act that forces us to doubt the nature of elections so long as the perpetrator is a participant.\n\nThis is why abuse of power is precisely the kind of offense that counts as a high crime and misdemeanor, whether or not the abuse in question is criminal: There is nothing more corrosive to systems of government than permitting officials to abuse power in order to amass power. When that is permitted, systems quickly crumble into autocracy.\n\nThe Founders saw that clearly. Will we?\n\nFurther reading and listening\n\n\u2022 There is a related argument over whether Trump\u2018s actions with Ukraine count as bribery. At Lawfare, Ben Berwick, Justin Florence, John Langford make the case that they do. At Politico, Renato Mariotti makes the case they don\u2019t.\n\n\u2022 The first episode of my new podcast \u2014 Impeachment, Explained \u2014 features Gene Healy and will appeal to anyone who has made it this far into a high crimes and misdemeanors explainer.
