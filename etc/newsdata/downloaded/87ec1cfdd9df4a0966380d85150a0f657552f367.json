The International Air Transport Association (IATA) expects the worldwide number of annual passengers to grow from 4.6 billion this year to 8.2 billion by 2037.\n\nAt this point in time, no commercial aircraft could complete the New York-to-Sydney marathon with a full load. To give the plane the needed range, the Qantas flight took off with maximum fuel, only a few passengers, restricted baggage and no cargo.\n\nThe goal was to gather data, with a team of researchers monitoring, among other things, lighting, activity, the sleep and consumption patterns of passengers, and crew melatonin levels. They also tracked the brain waves of pilots, who were equipped for the flight with brain monitoring devices.\n\nQantas tests 19-hour direct flights from UK and US to Sydney Read more\n\nThe aim of the research was, Qantas said in a statement, to increase health and wellness, minimise jet lag and identify optimum crew rest and work periods.\n\n\u201cThe flight was very successful from two components,\u201d Qanta captain Sean Golding said. \u201cThe first one was research. And also the feat of distance \u2013 that flight last night was 16,200 kilometres. We were airborne for 19 hours and 16 minutes, and we landed here in Sydney with a comfortable 70 minutes of fuel.\u201d\n\nThe airline also plans to test a non-stop flight from London to Sydney and expects to make a decision by the end of the year whether to start the routes, which would commence in 2022 or 2023.", "description": "Qantas plane lands after record New York-to-Sydney flight carrying 50 passengers and crew, plus a \u2018comfortable\u2019 70 minutes of fuel", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/889578792358da2416c18eb317a827816a5f460e/0_83_3788_2273/master/3788.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ac10d3401ee1bb31f48f4d5daea9d782", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
