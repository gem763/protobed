In 2017, South Africa\u2019s Home Affairs Department warned of a real robbery scam in which fake officials showed residents fake documents before barging in. But there is no Home Affairs Department in the U.S., and Census Bureau officials warned that more paranoid Americans might not open their doors, or worse, answer with a gun.\n\nCensus Bureau officials told VICE News that thousands of people shared the story on social media before readers started flagging it to them. The agency debunked the story on its website, alerted independent fact-checkers, and warned organizations like the AARP that it was bunk.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t kill it entirely,\u201d said Zack Schwartz, deputy chief of the Census Bureau\u2019s Center for New Media & Promotion. \u201cBut we were able to slow the spread of it.\u201d\n\nMisinformation campaigns\n\nIt was an early warning sign in an infowar that could grow every bit as hot as the 2020 election. Census data is the invisible foundation for much of the American economy and political system. It decides each state\u2019s number of congresspeople. It dictates changes to your grandparents\u2019 Social Security checks. It guides how Washington spends taxpayer money on roads, hospitals, and schools.\n\n\n\nREAD: The Kremlin's war on American democracy only got bigger after 2016\n\nAnd foreign and domestic attempts to disrupt it could be coming. For the Russian hackers and far-right shitposters who successfully screwed with the 2016 election, the fact that Census data will be largely collected online for the first time in 2020 represents a a huge and slow-moving target.\n\nAnd unlike next year\u2019s presidential election, which has already been targeted by Iranian-linked groups, we\u2019ll have to live with the results for the next decade.\n\n\u201cThe Census is our nation\u2019s largest peacetime operation. You don\u2019t fool around with such a complex operation,\u201d said Mary Jo Hoeksema, co-director for The Census Project, an advocacy group. \u201cCybersecurity is a big issue and we\u2019re all on pins and needles on how this is going to roll out.\u201d\n\nAdvocates fear that countries such as Russia, Iran, and China, could turn any election-related campaigns next year toward the Census. Projections by the nonprofit Urban Institute suggest that areas with high Latinx and African-American populations could be disproportionately affected by any undercounts. That could mean fewer electoral votes and federal dollars for states like California and Texas.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help when the White House, which spews xenophobic messaging and tried and failed to add a controversial citizenship question to the Census, could discourage immigrants to comply.\n\n\u201cThis round, the president\u2019s tweeting is likely to be a major factor in Census response or non-response,\u201d said Margo J. Anderson, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee history professor who researches the Census.\n\nBig Tech Warned\n\nCensus Bureau officials frantically are shoring up defenses in concert with tech companies, meeting with representatives for Google, Microsoft, and others to coordinate. Facebook is preparing to roll out a policy change targeting Census-related misinformation this fall, and a Twitter spokesperson told VICE News that it\u2019s in the process of clarifying its policy language to target any attempts to manipulate or interfere with the tally.\n\nDespite some voluntary transparency efforts by those platforms in the aftermath of 2016, however, they remain largely opaque and unaccountable.\n\nREAD: Facebook went to war against white supremacist terror after Christchurch. Will it work?\n\nIn July, Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, urged executives at Google, Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit to publicly report their Census-related content moderation efforts and share flagged content with partners in real-time. Schatz Spokesman Michael Inacay told VICE News that only Reddit responded to the letter.\n\n\u201cI wish I could reassure you that some of these companies get it 100 percent.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could reassure you that some of these companies get it 100 percent,\u201d said New York Rep. Yvette Clarke, a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, which launched a Census task force this summer. \u201cIt hasn't been demonstrated fully thus far.\u201d\n\nThose concerns have come alongside big question marks in funding. While counting households has grown more expensive in recent decades, according to the Government Accountability Office, the Census Bureau\u2019s budget increases haven\u2019t kept pace. It\u2019s had to scale back or delay research and field tests as the government has careened from one fiscal crisis to the next.\n\nAgency officials like Stephen Buckner have been hustling to prepare for any attempted interference despite it all. The Department of Homeland Security is helping defend the portal where Americans can share data and computer systems where the government will store it. The Census Bureau has launched a new email hotline and website for hoaxes. And it\u2019s broadcasting a singular message to every nonprofit group that will listen: If you see something, say something.\n\n\u201cWith growing mistrust of government, our partners play an invaluable role to be that trusted voice in those local communities,\u201d said Buckner, assistant communications director at the Census Bureau.\n\nThere have only been scattered examples of misinformation so far. The New York Times reported in July that a neo-Nazi website implored readers to apply to be Census takers and report undocumented people to ICE. Advocates warn that sort of fearmongering could snowball as counting begins in earnest next spring.\n\nREAD: Here's how Google sends advertising dollars to fake news sites\n\nCensus Bureau officials hope to combat any fake news by pushing out accurate information through partners, including tech platforms like Reddit, which launched an AMA series \u201cdemystifying the 2020 Census\u201d last week. The government is also launching a multimedia ad campaign across 13 languages, competing with the presidential campaign for both public attention and advertising slots.\n\n\u201cWhen there\u2019s an information void,\u201d Buckner said, \u201cthese things seem to grow.\u201d\n\nTech platforms\u2019 response will be crucial if they do. For Silicon Valley\u2019s part, it\u2019s largely folding Census defenses into existing election-security measures.\n\nA Twitter spokesperson said it plans to apply its election integrity policy to Census-related content. Facebook\u2019s coming rule change will similarly mirror its stance toward campaigns, allowing the company\u2019s reviewers to delete posts rather than simply down-rank them on the platform\u2019s algorithm.\n\nLessons from 2016\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re using lessons we\u2019ve learned from recent elections to protect the U.S. Census from any type of interference, including misinformation,\u201d a spokesman said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re also working closely with the Census Bureau and nonpartisan groups so that people see high-quality information about the upcoming Census.\u201d\n\nGoogle Spokesman Nu Wexler added in a statement that Google and YouTube are likewise committed \u201ccombating disinformation and fraudulent activities to help protect the integrity of the 2020 Census.\u201d\n\nWhile researchers agree that tech companies have improved policies and tools for quashing false information since 2016, evaluating their efforts in real time remains difficult.\n\nOnly Twitter publicizes datasets about disinformation operations. While Twitter, Google, and Facebook have all created databases for political advertising, they have significant limitations. Removing misinformation from platforms completely also prevents watchdogs from knowing what to look for.\n\n\u201cGetting them to commit to some sort of public reporting has yet to happen,\u201d said Maria Filippelli, who researches technology and the Census for the liberal think tank New America. \u201cTrying to make the jump from policy to product to evaluation has been trippy. They are big, huge firms, and getting those inter-departmental conversations is next to impossible.\u201d\n\nFor all of Republicans\u2019 newfound criticisms of tech companies, they don\u2019t seem to share similar concerns around the Census. Trump\u2019s attempt to add a citizenship question, which failed after a court battle, could even prove to be fertile ground for misinformation.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be the first time the government gave mixed messages about participating. In 2000, then-presidential candidate George W. Bush and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott both warned Americans to think twice about answering a \u201clong form\u201d version of the Census that they considered invasive of privacy.\n\nStill, Terry Ao Minnis is holding her breath this time around. Senior director for Census programs at Asian Americans Advancing Justice-AAJC, Minnis said she worries that the jump to digital could even exacerbate historic undercounts of communities like Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders.\n\nHer nonprofit is trying to ward off confusion by launching a dedicated Census website, holding monthly webinars, and publishing fact-checks in 23 Asian languages.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always better to prepare for a worst-case scenario and be pleasantly surprised by what ends up happening,\u201d she said.\n\nCover: Joyce Dalbey, left, with the U.S. Census Bureau, talks to attendees at the Yuma Community Job & Education Fair inside the Yuma Civic Center about possible job opportunities with the federal agency, Wednesday, Oct. 2, 2019, in Yuma, Ariz.
