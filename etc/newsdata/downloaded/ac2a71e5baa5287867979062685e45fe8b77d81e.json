But unlike the other entries, his video, for the song \"Peach Scone,\" went viral. It now has nearly 16-million views. Though Hobo Johnson didn't win the Contest, I did invite them to play a proper Tiny Desk.\n\nLife has changed a lot over the past few years for Frank Lopes Jr. He and his band The Lovemakers just released The Fall of Hobo Johnson, their first major-label album. It's a far cry from the record Frank made alone when he was living in his car and recording on a laptop.\n\nOn the day before his album came out, Hobo Johnson joined me to play DJ. He was at NPR's studios in Culver City, Calif. and I was in D.C. We discussed the making of his album and played some of the music that has inspired him over the years. I think you'll be surprised by some of his picks.\n\nAnd just a note: When Frank sings, the words often violate FCC rules. But, as he says, at the top of his Tiny Desk Contest entry, he doesn't care about rules.\n\n1. Hobo Johnson: 'Peach Scone (live)' Tiny Desk Contest Entry\n\nYouTube\n\n2.
