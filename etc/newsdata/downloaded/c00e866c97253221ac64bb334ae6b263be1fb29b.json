Liz Cheney (R-WY) on Monday for publicly objecting to President Donald Trump\u2019s initial plan to invite the Taliban to Camp David just days before the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, pointing out that her father was \u201cliterally\u201d responsible for \u201cmillions of deaths.\u201d\n\nOver the weekend, Trump announced via Twitter that he was canceling secret Camp David peace talks with the Taliban and the Afghanistan government to bring an eventual end to the nearly 18-year Afghan war, blaming a recent Taliban attack that killed a U.S. soldier. That the meeting was scheduled mere days before the 9/11 anniversary, however, prompted widespread and bipartisan criticism.\n\n\u201cCamp David is where America\u2019s leaders met to plan our response after al Qaeda, supported by the Taliban, killed 3000 Americans on 9/11,\u201d Cheney tweeted Sunday morning. \u201cNo member of the Taliban should set foot there. Ever. The Taliban still harbors al Qaeda. The President is right to end the talks.\u201d\n\nAppearing as Fox News chat-fest Outnumbered\u2019s \u201cOne Lucky Guy\u201d on Monday, Hilton took issue with the amount of condemnation and ridicule the president has received over the scuttled peace talks. And he specifically took Cheney to task.\n\nDeclaring that he was \u201cvery angry\u201d with all of \u201cthese establishment types\u201d wondering how Trump could invite the Taliban to Camp David, Hilton claimed the president is \u201cactually trying to clean up the mess that all these establishment people with their military-industrial complex cronies\u201d created.\n\n\u201cAnd please spare us,\u201d Hilton exclaimed, referencing Cheney. \u201cShe talks about death. Her father literally was responsible for not just the thousands of deaths that she rightly attributes to the Taliban, millions of deaths, billions of dollars wasted going into the company that he was the CEO of.\u201d\n\nCheney\u2019s father, of course, is former Vice-President Dick Cheney, who is seen as the chief architect of wars in Afghanistan and Iraq following the 9/11 terror attacks. Prior to becoming vice-president, Dick Cheney was the CEO of multinational oil-field service company Halliburton, which received a $7-billion no-bid government contract in the run-up to the Iraq War.\n\n\u201cThe corruption of this military-industrial complex, the establishment that supported them led to all these problems that Donald Trump is trying to clear out,\u201d Hilton concluded.", "description": "\u201cHer father literally was responsible for not just the thousands of deaths that she rightly attributes to the Taliban, millions of deaths, billions of dollars wasted,\u201d he said.", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1080,w_1920,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568055036/outnumbered_25_jqs1aw", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
