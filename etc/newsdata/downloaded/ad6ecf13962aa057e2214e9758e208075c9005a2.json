(AP) - The Wyoming Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that a district judge wrongly issued an order that upheld the University of Wyoming\u2019s restriction on people\u2019s ability to carry firearms on campus, saying in a split decision that the judge didn\u2019t have jurisdiction in the case.\n\nThe state\u2019s high court decided 3-2 Wednesday to overturn District Judge Tori Kricken\u2019s ruling that a state law prohibiting local governments and entities from making their own gun regulations only applies to guns manufactured in Wyoming.\n\nThe judge\u2019s ruling in November had the effect of upholding the UW ban on carrying guns on campus.\n\nThe Laramie Boomerang reports that a majority of Supreme Court justices ruled that a different judge, not Kricken, has jurisdiction over the case.\n\nUinta County resident Lyle Williams sued the university after UW police cited him for openly carrying his firearm during the Wyoming Republican Party convention last year on campus.\n\nWilliams was originally charged with misdemeanor trespassing in Albany County\u2019s circuit court before his attorney filed a request for declaratory judgment by the district court.\n\nWilliams argued the school\u2019s ban on guns violates the state law, which prohibits gun regulations by any \u201ccity, town, county, political subdivision or any other entity.\u201d\n\nWilliams appealed to the state\u2019s high court after Kricken ruled against him.\n\nThe Supreme Court opinion said the ruling should have come from the circuit court, where the trespassing charge was filed, and the high court ordered the district judge to dismiss the case.\n\nWilliams\u2019 trespassing case had been put on hold during these proceedings. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear how county prosecutors planned to proceed.\n\nA dissenting justice said the high court\u2019s majority ruling avoided the main issue over whether the school can regulate guns on campus.\n\n\u201cThis Court should consider Mr. Williams\u2019 claims on their merits at some point,\u201d wrote Justice Ketih Kautz. \u201cI see no reason that should not happen now.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Laramie Boomerang, http://www.laramieboomerang.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Wyoming Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that a district judge wrongly issued an order that upheld the University of Wyoming's restriction on people's ability to carry firearms on campus, saying in a split decision that the judge didn't have jurisdiction in the case.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": ""}
