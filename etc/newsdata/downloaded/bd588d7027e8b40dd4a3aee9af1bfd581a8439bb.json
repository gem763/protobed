Both Trump Jr. and Sanders said they did not see it.\n\nIn the video, Trump\u2019s head is superimposed on the body of a man who opens fire inside the \u201cChurch of Fake News.\u201d His targets are parishioners with logos of media organizations \u2014 including the Washington Post, Politico and Yahoo News \u2014 superimposed on their faces, as well as Black Lives Matter, the late Sen. John McCain, Rep. Maxine Waters and Sen. Bernie Sanders, whom Trump sets on fire. Other victims portrayed in the video include Rosie O\u2019Donnell, MSNBC\u2019s Mika Brzezinski, George Soros, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, Sen. Mitt Romney, Bill and Hillary Clinton, former Vice President Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama.\n\nThe clip appears to be lifted from the 2014 film \u201cKingsman: The Secret Service.\u201d It ends with Trump putting a stake into the head of a person with a CNN logo for a face before turning to admire his victims. The president smiles as DJ Khaled\u2019s \u201cAll I Do Is Win\u201d plays in the background.\n\nEvan Vucci/AP More\n\nThe White House Correspondents\u2019 Association, which represents journalists who cover the administration, said it was \u201chorrified\u201d and called on Trump and \u201call Americans\u201d to condemn the video.\n\n\u201cAll Americans should condemn this depiction of violence directed toward journalists and the President\u2019s political opponents,\u201d Jonathan Karl, WHCA president, said in a statement. \u201cWe have previously told the president his rhetoric could incite violence. Now we call on him and everybody associated with this conference to denounce this video and affirm that violence has no place in our society.\u201d\n\nCindy McCain, the widow of the former Arizona senator, said the images in the video \u201cviolate every norm our society expects from its leaders.\u201d\n\nOn ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View,\u201d Meghan McCain, his daughter, scolded conservatives who defended the video as \u201cfree speech.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf this was the opposite and it happened at an Obama event, you\u2019d be screaming bloody murder,\u201d she said.\n\nSen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., who is not depicted in the video, said that while the Trump campaign may not have produced it, it is nonetheless Trump\u2019s \"re-election message.\"\n\nEvery mother and father in America should watch video. Play it all the way to end. Know that this is the re-election message of your President.\n\n\n\nAnd then ask yourself - how you sit your kids down and tell them you want this person to lead us. https://t.co/TjgYE1uJy6 \u2014 Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) October 14, 2019\n\nIn a statement, Alex Phillips, the organizer of the American Priority conference, said the video was part of a \u201cmeme exhibit\u201d and was \u201cnot associated with or endorsed by the conference in any official capacity.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerican Priority rejects all political violence and aims to promote a healthy dialogue about the preservation of free speech,\u201d Phillips said.\n\nWhile the White House suggested Trump \u201cstrongly condemns\u201d the video, the president himself has been known to share similar memes on Twitter. In 2017, Trump tweeted an actual 2007 video from \"WrestleMania 23\" of himself slamming WWE president Vince McMahon to the ground and punching him, with the CNN logo superimposed over McMahon\u2019s head.\n\nAnd, facing an impeachment inquiry, Trump in recent weeks has escalated his verbal attacks aimed at the news media.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re directly taking on the unholy alliance of corrupt Democrat politicians, deep state bureaucrats and the fake news media,\u201d Trump said at a rally in Lake Charles, La., on Friday, pointing to the press. \u201cThere they are right there.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "The White House on Monday tried to distance itself from a violent parody video that was shown at a pro-Trump conference at the president\u2019s Doral Miami resort over the weekend.", "authors": ["Dylan Stableford", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/s4BGHL8OLFZAKGC2H8Xd8w--~B/aD0zNDY0O3c9NTE5NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/01f8f390-ee8e-11e9-9b7b-c3c71781cdea", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
