While the Constitution clearly gives the House the power to begin impeachment proceedings, it does not give the speaker the privilege of declaring them all by herself.\n\nPrecedent is on the White House\u2019s side here. Most recently, the full House voted to open impeachment inquiries against Presidents Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon \u2014 and in so doing set clear rules that gave presidential defenders full rights to participate, including the right to subpoena witnesses.\n\nsee also State Department withholding messages from top diplomat: Schiff Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff on Tuesday said the State Department...\n\nThe letter even quotes Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler\u2019s past remarks that \u201cthe power of impeachment \u2026 demands a rigorous level of due process\u201d that includes such provisions.\n\nAs Cipollone notes, the investigating committees \u201cmust provide for the disclosure of all evidence favorable to the President and all evidence bearing on the credibility of witnesses called to testify in the inquiry. The Committees\u2019 current procedures proved none of these basic constitutional rights.\u201d\n\nPelosi\u2019s Democrats are rushing to a final impeachment vote before Thanksgiving. They\u2019re deposing witnesses behind closed doors and denying Republicans fair time to ask questions and the right to call their own witnesses \u2014 and won\u2019t even release full interview transcripts.\n\nInstead, they\u2019re leaking negative info and withholding favorable facts \u2014 feeding fanatically anti-Trump media to repeat slanted interpretations as fact.\n\nThis is no constitutional effort to get at the full facts: It\u2019s a rush to sell the public on a narrative of presidential wrongdoing.\n\nThe White House is entirely right to call out Pelosi\u2019s game. And her only proper response is to treat her drive to impeach Trump the same way her Republican predecessors did their drive to impeach Clinton.\n\nIs she simply afraid to be fair?", "description": "Most recently, the full House voted to open impeachment inquiries against Presidents Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon \u2014 and in so doing set clear rules that gave presidential defenders full rights to participate, including the right to subpoena witnesses.", "authors": ["Post Editorial Board", "October"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/trump_impeachment_ambassador.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
