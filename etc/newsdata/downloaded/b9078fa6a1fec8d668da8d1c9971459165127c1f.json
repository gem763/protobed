He pointed to community health centers as a potential way to extend this type of care. A few candidates support more community health centers, including Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Joe Biden, though they haven\u2019t talked in their released plans about how these centers might be useful in the era of climate change.\n\nThat\u2019s generally true of candidates\u2019 platforms: Health care gets a mention in climate plans, but not vice versa. Juli\u00e1n Castro\u2019s climate plan mentions the need for accessible health care. \u201cWe will ensure that all people have access to universal and high-quality health care regardless of their employment status to respond to the dangerous health impacts of climate change.\u201d Similarly, Warren\u2019s climate plan also notes how \u201ca simplified Medicare for All system will make it easier for the federal government to quickly tailor health care responses to specific environmental disasters.\u201d And the principles of a Green New Deal\u2014ensuring social equity and jobs, while directly addressing the source of climate change by setting stringent emissions goals\u2014would likely lower the health vulnerabilities of certain populations, while also reducing the health impacts of climate change by tackling its source.\n\nSome candidates also include public health interventions within their climate plans. Bernie Sanders is calling for a $40 billion Climate Justice Resiliency Fund, which would direct funds into areas with high climate vulnerabilities, including to address public health challenges and establish an Office of Climate Resiliency for People with Disabilities. Warren also supports more funding to environmental justice communities and adjusting permitting rules to the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act to better measure environmental health disparities.\n\nMany social policies indirectly affect this intersection of health and climate. For instance, affordable housing policy, which many candidates have proposed, is a way to protect people from environmental harm.\n\nEvery candidate has embraced increased healthcare access. Yet some of the candidates\u2019 healthcare plans still have coverage gaps. For instance, Joe Biden\u2019s plan for a public option added to the Affordable Care Act would leave 3 million people uninsured and fails to reform Medicare. This could mean that some of those most vulnerable to climate change do not receive the care they need, for example if they find themselves dealing with lyme or dengue (predicted to expand into the southeastern United States).", "description": "They don't talk about the massive ways health care and climate change intersect.", "authors": ["Greta Moran"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/d5b241cc0d58c93d7d4e5c72e3e2f814e94003ad.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
