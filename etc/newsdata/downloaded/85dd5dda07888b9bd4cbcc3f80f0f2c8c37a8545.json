Additionally, it allows UPS to transport packages over 55 pounds by drone. Scott Price, UPS chief strategy officer, though, says the technology for heavy package deliveries is still being finished, the AP reports.\n\nWork still remains to be done, however, before customers can expect to see packages arrive via drone.\n\nAt the moment, drone deliveries will only occur on campuses such as universities and hospitals because the FAA hasn't passed regulations that would make commercial drone flying legal over populated areas. Plus, each flight will need its own pilot, meaning for the time being, UPS won't be able to assign one pilot to manage multiple flights. The drone must also stay within the line of sight of the pilot.\n\nThe company thinks that same-day delivery is the most commercially feasible use for drone deliveries at the moment, but that hinges on the FAA drafting the necessary regulations for drone use in populated areas.\n\nAmazon owner Jeff Bezos Jeffrey (Jeff) Preston BezosFreedom of the press under fire in Colorado Krystal Ball defends Sanders amid reports that campaign is struggling UPS gets FAA approval to operate drone fleet MORE claimed in 2014 that drones would be making home deliveries by 2019, but that prediction did not come to fruition.\n\nUPS's shipping rivals, such as DHL and FedEx, are also pushing to gain clearance from the government to begin using drone deliveries.", "description": "UPS announced Tuesday that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) granted\u00a0the company clearance\u00a0to operate a fleet of nationwide delivery drones, according to The Assoc", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/upslogo_091819getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
