And this isn\u2019t true, either.\n\nTrump appears to be referring to a poll from Investor\u2019s Business Daily and TIPP that showed Trump improving 17 points \u2014 with four important caveats. First, this wasn\u2019t a change over \u201ctwo or three days,\u201d but instead over the past month. Polls don\u2019t shift 17 points in a few days outside a massive news event, and last weekend doesn\u2019t count in that regard. Second, the shift was only among independents, meaning a smaller group with a larger margin of error. Third, it was a shift in margin, not support; Trump\u2019s position improved only 8 points. And fourth, the IBD/TIPP poll is only one poll.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere is another new poll worth considering here: A Washington Post-Schar School poll released Tuesday morning. Our poll paints a much bleaker picture for Trump overall \u2014 but also suggests that the administration\u2019s scramble to rationalize Trump\u2019s behavior is not gaining any substantial traction at all.\n\nThe last time The Post polled on the question was in July. Since then, there\u2019s been a big increase in support for the House launching an impeachment inquiry: 20-point increases across party lines.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, there\u2019s been a decrease in opposition to an inquiry \u2014 including a 17-point drop overall of those who strongly oppose launching an inquiry. The drop among Republicans was 24 points. In July, 83 percent of Trump\u2019s party strongly opposed an inquiry. In our new poll, that figure is only 59 percent.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSince news of Trump\u2019s efforts to cajole Ukraine\u2019s president into conducting politically useful investigations broke last month, Trump and his allies have been scrambling to brush the controversy away. They\u2019ve deployed a see-what-sticks approach that, so far, hasn\u2019t resulted in anything really sticking as a defense beyond \u201cwhat Trump did is okay, full stop.\u201d\n\nOur poll asked that question specifically: Was Trump\u2019s request to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden appropriate? Only a third of respondents said it was \u2014 and a third of Republicans said it wasn\u2019t.\n\nSure, more than half of Republicans said that what Trump did was appropriate, but Republicans are the only group that has stood with Trump consistently over the course of his presidency. That a third are now skeptical of the actions at the heart of the impeachment inquiry, joining robust majorities of Democrats and independents, is significant.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf this figure (which, of course, is just one poll) holds, the significance is probably greater than it seems. Over the course of his presidency, Trump has demonstrated an ability to generate rationales for even his most controversial behavior, quickly landing on excuses that his core base of support can use to fend off criticism. On Ukraine, that ability is faltering.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s because new revelations are coming in a deluge, making it hard to land on one overarching rationalization. What\u2019s more, new revelations have washed away rationales already presented by the White House. (The dismissal among Trump\u2019s allies that the intelligence-community whistleblower was relying on hearsay, for example, was undercut entirely by the release of a rough transcript of the Trump-Zelensky call showing that the whistleblower nailed the contents of the call.) Or perhaps it\u2019s because the question at hand \u2014 was the behavior appropriate? \u2014 is both straightforward and hard to defend on the merits.\n\nParticularly in the broader context of Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine. A third of Republicans, for example, think that the Trump administration\u2019s still-unexplained decision to halt aid to Ukraine is an important consideration in evaluating Trump\u2019s request. There\u2019s really only one way to read that: A third of Republicans think it\u2019s possible that Trump was using American aid as leverage.\n\nMore than half of respondents agree.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that our poll also showed that three-quarters of Republicans think that Democrats are overreacting on the Ukraine issue. A bit under a quarter of Republicans thought they weren\u2019t, a figure a bit under the percentage of Republicans who support the inquiry.\n\nAgain, though: In this hyperpartisan moment, about a fifth of Trump\u2019s own party thinks that their political opponents aren\u2019t overreacting in pressing for an impeachment inquiry centered on Trump\u2019s request to Ukraine\u2019s president.\n\nTrump might yet develop a rationale for his actions that brings his party back on board. For the moment, though, the Ukraine question appears to be sticking.\n\nAD", "description": "Trump\u2019s vaunted ability to spin away from controversy is fumbling on the Ukraine scandal.", "authors": ["Philip Bump", "National Correspondent Focused Largely On The Numbers Behind Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/z5Cub8PwDSeMatBKtLl_D3POYXg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UP6TV6HJWAI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
