Add Hurricane Dorian as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Hurricane Dorian news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nDorian, which came ashore on Elbow Cay of the Abaco Islands, is tied for the strongest Atlantic hurricane landfall on record, along with a hurricane on Labor Day in 1935 that struck the Florida Keys and moved up along the Gulf Coast of Florida.\n\nThe eye of the storm made a second landfall at 2 p.m. on the island near Marsh Harbour, and a third landfall an hour before midnight on the eastern end of Grand Bahama Island.\n\nDevastating conditions continued on the Abaco Islands overnight, with western portions of Grand Bahama, including the main city of Freeport, seeing the situation head south through the early morning.\n\nDante Carrer/Reuters\n\nFrancis Charles, who rode out the storm in Hope Town, Elbow Cay, called the island \"a wreck\" late Sunday.\n\n\"I have never seen anything like this in my life,\" Jenise Fernandez, reporter with Miami ABC affiliate WPLG, told the station during their broadcast.\n\nABC News correspondent Marcus Moore, who is on the ground in Marsh Harbour, described the scene as \"pure hell.\"\n\n\"I have seen utter devastation here in Marsh Harbour. We are surrounded by water with no way out,\" Moore said. \"Absolution devastation, there really are no words it is pure hell here on Marsh Harbour on Avoca Island in the northern part of the Bahamas.\"\n\nPlay\n\nThe National Hurricane Center is calling the storm a life-threatening situation with extreme destruction and the potential for wind gusts over 200 mph.\n\n\"Today I gave a live national briefing on the extremely dangerous #HurricaneDorian from NEMA Headquarters,\" Bahamas Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said in a tweet Sunday night. \"This is probably the saddest and worst day for me to address the Bahamian people. We are facing a hurricane that we have never seen in The Bahamas. Please pray for us.\"\n\nLucy Worboys/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe town of Marsh Harbour on Great Abaco island has catastrophic damage, according to an ABC News team on the ground, with boats on rooftops and uprooted trees.\n\nIt is the strongest hurricane in modern record for the northwestern Bahamas.\n\nI just heard all of the homes in \u201cThe Mud\u201d have been destroyed #Dorian2019 #marshharbour pic.twitter.com/Y1Uh3sZPbP \u2014 steve pece (@stevepece) September 1, 2019\n\nBut with the slow motion of Dorian, the prolonged duration of hurricane and tropical storm force winds with gusts over 100 mph, storm surges of up to 20 feet and heavy rain of up to 30 inches locally in some areas will have potentially devastating impacts on the northern Bahamas.\n\nNOAA/RAMMB/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHurricane Dorian\u2019s path continues with the trend seen over the last day, keeping landfall away from Florida as the steering ridge of high pressure will weaken and allow for Dorian to take that turn to the north. The timing of that turn will be what determines the severity of impacts on Florida\u2019s east coast.\n\nWhile there are competing models for where the storm could hit, the east coast of Florida still should brace for potential landfall from Dorian.\n\nABC NEWS\n\nOn Sunday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced that tolls on the state's turnpike mainline will be suspended for aid evacuations.\n\nPalm Beach County International Airport, Orlando Melbourne International Airport and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport will cease operations on Monday at noon. Orlando International Airport will not be closing.\n\nPort Canaveral closed for commercial traffic on Saturday, and Port Miami closed to all vessel traffic on Sunday.\n\nABC News\n\nAs Dorian makes its northward turn Monday into Tuesday, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina will be on high alert. Although the official National Hurricane Center track keeps the center of Dorian right off the coast as of now, the impacts will still be greatly felt.\n\nA hurricane warning is in effect for Florida's east coast from Jupiter all the way to the Florida-Georgia border.\n\nDorian will still be a Category 1 or 2 storm with winds of 90 to 100 mph just off the coast making when the storm makes its closet approach to South Carolina and North Carolina Thursday into Friday.\n\nABC News\n\nThere is still high uncertainty in the track three to five days out and Dorian still has the potential to make landfall in the southeast states.\n\nThe Bahamas should expect storm surges of up to 15 to 20 feet, rainfall of up to 30 inches and prolonged hurricane-force winds, large and destructive waves and wind gusts of over 100 mph.\n\nTake a look at #HurricaneDorian churning over the Atlantic Ocean, as captured by cameras outside the @Space_Station at 12:16pm ET. As a Category 5 hurricane, the storm is carrying the strongest winds in recorded history for the northwestern Bahamas.

Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency for all counties Sunday afternoon.\n\n\"North Carolina has endured flooding from two strong hurricanes in less than three years,\u201d Cooper said in a press release announcing the declaration. \"Now is the time to prepare for Dorian.
