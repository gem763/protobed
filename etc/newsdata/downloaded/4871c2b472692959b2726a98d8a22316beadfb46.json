It finished with a decline of 0.36% (or nearly 96 points) to 26,478.02\n\n\n\nThe S&P slipped 0.45% to 2938.79, while the NASDAQ dropped 0.33% (or about 26 points) to 7956.29.\n\n\n\nThe major indices are coming off a similarly indecisive week, which began with sharp selloffs due to soft economic data. However, the situation turned around in the final two sessions with a little help from a \u2018goldilocks\u2019 jobs report on Friday.\n\n\n\nIn the end, the NASDAQ managed a positive weekly performance, while the other two had their third consecutive weekly losses.\n\n\n\nA news report from Bloomberg on Monday stated that China doesn\u2019t plan on agreeing to any broad deal that might reform the way that country does business.\n\n\n\nNeedless to say, such a report cast a pall on the market because that\u2019s exactly the type of comprehensive deal that President Trump wants in order to end this trade conflict.\n\n\n\nHowever, we didn\u2019t see one of those 1%-plus plunges that the market is susceptible to.

Better buckle up!\n\n\n\nToday's Portfolio Highlights:\n\n\n\nStocks Under $10: The news that China doesn\u2019t want a broad-based deal convinced Brian to make a couple moves on Monday. First of all, he decided to protect his gains in photomasks manufacturer Photronics (PLAB) by selling the stock for a 15% return in less than three months. The editor then added a stock from a space that enjoys a tariff exemption. He picked up solar company Vivint Solar (VSLR), which is a \u2018rising tide lifts all boats\u2019 play given the potential of its industry.

The editor originally bought ZS back in February and then sold it in April for a return of more than 37%! He\u2019s hoping for more of the same this time around.
