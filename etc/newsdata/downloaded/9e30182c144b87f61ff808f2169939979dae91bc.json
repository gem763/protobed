We all took cover, screaming, covering our heads with our hands. When it all stopped, we scrambled out and were just checking each other, making sure we were OK.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cThere were a few minor head injuries, Isaac [Sackey] had broken his hand\u2026 everything was smashed to pieces. Windows, doors, everything. The bus was a mess. We were all in shock but, because I\u2019d somehow come away untouched, I was just trying to calm people down. It was only after about two or three minutes that we realised Josef wasn\u2019t there.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when we heard people screaming further back down the road from where we\u2019d come, and someone turned to me and said: \u2018That\u2019s him. That\u2019s Sural.\u2019 I just sprinted down to where they were, and saw him. He was lying there on the floor, breathing heavily\u2026 I sat there with him, talking to him, speaking with my friend, trying to keep him awake until the ambulance eventually came. It was all I could do.\u201d\n\n(Image: Josef Sural /Instagram)\n\nSural and his teammates on board were taken to Alanya Anadolu private hospital.\n\nExcept for Caulker, who went to tell Sural's wife of the incident at their house, before heading to the hospital with her and their four-year old daughter.\n\nAfter playing with Sural's daughter at the hospital for some time, Caulker and the other players were all sent home, with their teammate expected to make a full recovery, but at 7am Caulker received the message that his friend had passed away.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nHe then had to attend Sural's funeral on the same day, in keeping with local traditions, as the Alanyaspor players were still struggling to come to terms with what had happened.\n\nThey donned black shirts and laid roses on Sural's coffin, with the club providing support to the late forward's family ever since.\n\nCaulker added: \"His memory lives on. His picture is up at the training ground, in the stadium. He is still one of us. He\u2019ll never be forgotten.\u201d", "description": "The England international moved to Turkey in January but was immediately hit by tragic events just months later", "authors": ["Darren Wells", "Image", "Alanyaspor", "Josef Sural", "Instagram", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20523126.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Turkey-Czech-striker-Josef-Sural-succumbs-to-injuries.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
