We have a vice president who is Catholic. We are very strong supporters of the values that are advocated by the Holy See. They should see us as a partner to help Christianity in the Chinese-speaking world,\u201d Chen said.\n\nLast September, the Vatican announced the signing of a provisional agreement with China, which granted an unspecified power to the Communist party in the naming of bishops.\n\nNot long after, Hong Kong Cardinal Joseph Zen said that the deal spells the \u201cannihilation\u201d of the Church in China.\n\n\u201cFrancis may have natural sympathy for Communists because for him, they are the persecuted,\u201d Zen wrote in a New York Times op-ed. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know them as the persecutors they become once in power, like the Communists in China.\u201d\n\nThe following month, China\u2019s most famous civil rights activist denounced the deal as a \u201cbetrayal\u201d of Chinese Catholics.\n\nChen Guangcheng, a blind scholar and human rights advocate, said that Communist China is an \u201cextraordinarily dictatorial and authoritarian nation\u201d where many kinds of freedoms that are taken for granted in the West are \u201croutinely and often violently repressed.\u201d\n\nThe pact equates to \u201cbowing before evil, of selling God to the devil,\u201d he said. \u201cThis will become yet another shameful episode whose stain the Catholic Church will be unable to cleanse.\u201d\n\nSince then, the Chinese government has appeared emboldened by the Vatican deal, increasing pressure on underground bishops to join the state-controlled Patriotic Association or suffer the consequences.\n\nWhen President Xi visited Rome last March, he publicly snubbed Pope Francis, ignoring overtures by the Vatican and meeting instead exclusively with state leaders.\n\nMuch of this would seem to corroborate Cardinal Zen\u2019s repeated assertion that Francis is na\u00efve in his understanding of Chinese communism, an assessment shared by Deputy Minister Chen.\n\nWhile the Vatican would like to help Catholics in China, Chen said, it \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a very deep knowledge about the communist rule in China.\u201d\n\n\u201cEver since Xi Jinping came to power, things have changed, a lot,\u201d Chen said, citing ongoing abuses of religious freedom.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party is \u201caggressively going after Christians,\u201d he told Crux, and the danger faced by Chinese Christians \u201cis comprehensive and is from all directions.\u201d\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "Taiwanese officials said that the Vatican\u2019s year-old agreement with Communist China has done nothing to help Catholics on the ground. | Faith", "authors": ["Thomas D.
