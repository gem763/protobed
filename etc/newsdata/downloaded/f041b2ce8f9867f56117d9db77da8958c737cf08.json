They were detained after Priya's visa expired.\n\nAlthough born in Australia, the couple's daughters Kopika, aged four, and Tharunicca, aged two, do not have the right to Australian citizenship by birth.\n\nUN request\n\nAn attempt to deport the family was made in August after the asylum applications of Kopika and her parents were rejected, but a Federal Court judge granted a last-minute injunction forcing their plane, which was en-route to Sri Lanka, to land in Darwin.\n\nFord said the injunction was granted because two-year-old Tharunicca had never been assessed for a protection visa.\n\nEarlier this month, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees requested the family be moved out of detention and allowed to return to their home in Biloela in the state of Queensland, giving the Australia government 30 days to comply.\n\nWhile Ford said there was still time for the Australian government to act on this request, they were not obligated to do so.\n\n\u201cTo date, I haven't received any indication that they will be released,\u201d she said.\n\nA spokesperson from the Department of Home Affairs told Al Jazeera it was aware of the interim request.\n\n\u201cThe family are residing on Christmas Island and will remain there while the judicial review proceedings are before the court,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nNeighbours have rallied around the family who face being deported to Sri Lanka. [Angela Fredericks/Al Jazeera]\n\nTown rallies behind family\n\nFord said that while most failed refugee applicants have a very low profile, this case was unique because of the \u201csheer amount of publicity\u201d surrounding it and the support the family had received from ordinary Australians.\n\nAngela Fredericks, a close friend and neighbour of the family since they moved to the small town of Biloela, began a petition to Peter Dutton, Australia\u2019s Minister of Home Affairs, which has so far received more than a quarter of a million signatures.\n\n\u201cI just saw what beautiful genuine people they were,\u201d Fredericks said.\n\n\u201cNades (Nadesalingam) was such a hard worker and just so willing to give back ... they come from such horrific circumstances, and they just wanted a peaceful life and to pay back the community that had taken them in.\u201d\n\nFredericks visited the family on Christmas island last month and had previously visited them while they were detained in Melbourne.\n\nShe said they were staying in a \u201ctiny room\u201d sharing two bunk beds between the four of them.\n\nShe described a communal kitchen and a play area for the children, but the bathrooms were outside the compound, which made it difficult for the family.\n\n\u201cIt blows my mind, just the ridiculousness of it all,\u201d she said. \u201cEven just the expense \u2013 throw compassion away, but still, what are we doing? The amount it has cost Australia since they were taken is just absurd.\u201d\n\nTamil Refugee Council spokesperson Aran Mylvaganam (centre) speaks to the media after a dramatic late-night call from an Australian judge gave a temporary reprieve to Nades, Priya and their two children. [William West/AFP]\n\nNine out of ten Tamils rejected\n\nFredericks said 30 other Tamils were on the same flight as the family and were deported on the same day the court order allowed Nades and Priya to stay.\n\nTamil Refugee Council spokesman Aran Mylvaganam said Tamil refugees have one of the lowest acceptance rates among refugee applications in Australia.\n\nHe said about nine out of ten cases are rejected despite the immense danger Tamil families face in their home country.\n\nIn a study released last month, the International Truth and Justice Project detailed \u201csystematic brutal torture and sexual violence\u201d against men and women detained over the last decade.\n\n\u201cIt's a dangerous place for Priya and Nades and the two children to be, and we just hope that all these recent developments will be taken into account,\u201d Mylvaganam said.", "description": "Nadesalingam and Priya were detained with their Australia-born daughters in March 2018 and are now on Christmas Island.", "authors": ["Tracey Shelton"], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/15/da7693d0d2b64f3c914a3ffa1f3fde1f_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
