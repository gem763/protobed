That would exceed the record of $1,921.17 set in 2011.\n\nLow or lower-for-longer nominal and real interest rates; global recession risks -- exacerbated by U.S.-China trade tensions; and heightened geopolitical rifts are \u201ccombining to buttress a bullish gold market environment,\u201d the bank said. Also, \u201cin affinity to our U.S. rates research colleagues, we believe the Fed will ultimately end up cutting rates all the way to zero,\u201d the analysts wrote.\n\nhit a six-year high this month as central banks ease policy to address the slowdown in growth amid the trade war. This week, investors expect the European Central Bank to unleash more stimulus, while next week the Fed is seen cutting rates again. That\u2019s helped to drive flows into bullion-backed exchange-traded funds as investors track the trajectory of the U.S. economy.\n\nMarket Signals\n\n\u201cFor now, the U.S. consumer and potential growth story is holding up,\u201d Citi said in the note. However, \u201cwe remain more concerned about market signals -- three-month to 10-year yield curve inversion -- and leading indicators that are weakening at the fastest pace since the Great Recession,\u201d it said.\n\ntraded at $1,491.34 an ounce on Tuesday, up 16% this year after rising for the past four months. Citi said that it had upgraded its baseline forecasts for gold on the Comex by $125 to $1,575 an ounce for the fourth quarter, and by about 14% to $1,675 for 2020.\n\nIn July, U.S. monetary policy makers reduced borrowing costs for the first time in more than a decade, and they are widely expected to do so again at their Sept. 17-18 meeting. BNP Paribas (PA: ) SA, which is also bullish on the outlook for bullion, said it expects four quarter-point reductions over the coming year.\n\nCiti\u2019s outlook did come with caveats, including a hawkish turn from the Fed or a breakthrough in trade talks, although that\u2019s not its base case. \u201cA surprise trade deal coupled with a sharp upturn in global manufacturing data would probably suggest a peak for gold at the $1,550 an ounce level for this cycle.\u201d\n\n(Updates price in sixth paragraph)", "description": "Citigroup Says Gold May Top Record", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic9a3511b4b4dc5136e634755fde1a362f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
