This week, we\u2019ve got a very sparkly RoboCop, a suitably separable Monty Python and the Holy Grail classic, and Mezco has not just one, but two fantastic offerings for its Marvel line. Check it out!\n\nMezco Toyz One:12 Collective Marvel Black Bolt and Lockjaw Set\n\nWe already knew back at New York Toy Fair that Mezco was working on a scaled Lockjaw as part of its excellent One:12 Collective line of hyper articulated action figures. Now, we\u2019ve got glorious pictures of him, and we can officially confirm: That\u2019s a damn good boy right there.\n\nOh, we guess he comes with a Black Bolt figure too? That\u2019s nice. The glow in the dark lines on Black Bolt\u2019s costume are a neat effect, as are alternate hands and the alternate head \u2014 with accompanying FX pieces \u2014 to replicate the King of Inhumanity letting loose with his deadly vocal powers. But really, we\u2019re here for Lockjaw, who isn\u2019t just adorable, but actually articulated too! His little tuning fork even lights up for good measure! So cute. Such a good boy. For around $190 with the accompanying Black Bolt, he better be. [Mezco]\n\nHiya Toys RoboCop 2 1/18th Scale RoboCop Figure\n\nThanks to a tragically awful remake back in 2014, we don\u2019t see a lot of RoboCop figures or collectibles passing through these parts. And that\u2019s a shame, because it was one of the best movie costumes (and robots) of all time. Hiya Toys is drawing inspiration from the character\u2019s appearance in the original RoboCop sequel for this new 1/18th-scale figure featuring an iridescent sheen on the armour. The figure includes loads of articulation, RoboCop\u2019s intimidating data probe (USB doesn\u2019t exist in that universe?), and his iconic Beretta 93R, and it will be available in August of next year for just $30.\n\nMezco Toyz One:12 Collective Marvel Gambit\n\nThere are many reasons Gambit is one of the most universally liked X-Men characters. He has a charming Creole accent, he wields a bo-staff like Donatello \u2014 the superior Ninja Turtle \u2014 and he can throw charged playing cards (among other objects) that explode on impact. Not to mention that hair, which is lavishly captured with Mezco Toyz\u2019 new One: 12 Collective Gambit figure. Standing a little over six-and-a-half inches tall, the $125 figure (available sometime in mid-2020) includes over 28 points of articulation, two swappable head portraits, weapons, charged throwing cards and seven interchangeable hands.\n\nPrime 1 Studio Jurassic Park T-rex versus Velociraptors in the Rotunda Statue\n\nWith its groundbreaking and industry-changing visual effects, Jurassic Park backed up its remarkably realistic CG dinosaurs with some of the most memorable scenes in movie history. That includes the climactic finale when the T-rex unintentionally saves the day while looking for an easy meal. Prime 1 Studios has recreated that scene, including the wonderfully ironic \u201cWhen Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth\u201d falling banner, in this 65cm tall statue that includes a bloodied T-rex and two velociraptors that don\u2019t stand a chance. Life finds a way, but will you find a way to stomach this limited edition collectible\u2019s $2,900 price tag?\n\nEditor's Note: Prime 1 Studios statues have been stocked by Popcultcha in the past, so it may turn up there if you're super keen.\n\nMonty Python and the Holy Grail Black Knight Deluxe Talking Premium Motion Statue\n\nOne of cinema\u2019s most formidable foes is deserving of his own elaborately detailed Hot Toys figure, but we\u2019ll take what we can get, which in this case is a bobblehead-like jiggling statue of the Black Knight from Monty Python and the Holy Grail.\n\nIn addition to speaking 10 over-quoted phrases from the movies (\u201dTis but a scratch\u201d), this seven-and-a-half inch statue includes a pair of removable arms held on by magnets so you can inflict some inconsequential flesh wounds and then be on your way. It\u2019s available for pre-order from Entertainment Earth for $75, and is expected to ship sometime in January in the new year.
