(AP Photo/Nariman El-Mofty)\n\nRAS AL-ARA, Yemen (AP) \u2014 Zahra struggled in the blue waters of the Gulf of Aden, grasping for the hands of fellow migrants. Hundreds of men, women and teenagers clambered out of a boat and through the surf emerging, exhausted, on the shores of Yemen.\n\nThe 20-year-old Ethiopian saw men armed with automatic rifles waiting for them on the beach and she clenched in terror. She had heard migrants' stories of brutal traffickers, lurking like monsters in a nightmare. They are known by the Arabic nickname Abdul-Qawi \u2014 which means Worshipper of the Strong.\n\n\"What will they do to us?\" Zahra thought.\n\n___\n\nThis story is part of an occasional series, \"Outsourcing Migrants,\" produced with the support of the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.\n\n___\n\nShe and 300 other Africans had just endured six hours crammed in a wooden smuggling boat to cross the narrow strait between the Red Sea and the gulf. When they landed, the traffickers loaded them into trucks and drove them to ramshackle compounds in the desert outside the coastal village of Ras al-Ara.\n\nThere was Zahra's answer. She was imprisoned for a month in a tin-roofed hut, broiling and hungry, ordered to call home each day to beseech her family to wire $2,000. She said she did not have family to ask for money and pleaded for her freedom.\n\nInstead, her captors raped her. And they raped the 20 other women with her \u2014 for weeks, different men all the time.\n\n\"They used each of the girls,\" she told The Associated Press. \"Every night there was rape.\"\n\nWith its systematic torture, Ras al-Ara is a particular hell on the arduous, 900-mile (1,400 kilometer) journey from the Horn of Africa to oil-rich Saudi Arabia. Migrants leave home on sandaled feet with dreams of escaping poverty. They trek through mountains and deserts, sandstorms and 113-degree temperatures, surviving on crumbs of bread and salty water from ancient wells.\n\nIn Djibouti, long lines of migrants descend single file down mountain slopes to the rocky coastal plain, where many lay eyes on the sea for first time and eventually board the boats. Some find their way safely across war-torn Yemen to Saudi Arabia, only to be caught and tossed back over the border. The lucky ones make it into the kingdom to earn their livings as a servant and laborers.\n\nBut others are stranded in Yemen's nightmare \u2014 in some measure because Europe has been shutting its doors, outsourcing migrants to other countries.\n\nThe European Union began paying Libyan coast guards and militias to stop migrants there, blocking the other main route out of East Africa, through Libya and across the Mediterranean to Europe. The number of Mediterranean crossings plummeted \u2014 from 370,000 in 2016 to just over 56,000 so far this year.\n\nMeanwhile, more than 150,000 migrants landed in Yemen in 2018, a 50% increase from the year before, according to the International Organization for Migration.\n\nThis year, more than 107,000 had arrived by the end of September, along with perhaps tens of thousands more the organization was unable to track \u2014 or who were buried in graves along the trail.\n\nAnd European policies may be making the Yemen route more dangerous. Funded by the EU, Ethiopia has cracked down on migrant smugglers and intensified border controls. Arrests of known brokers have prompted migrants to turn to unreliable traffickers, taking more dangerous paths and increasing the risk of abuses.\n\nMany of those migrants end up in Ras al-Ara.\n\nNearly every migrant who lands here is imprisoned in hidden compounds while their families are shaken down for money. Like Zahra, they are subjected to daily torments ranging from beatings and rapes to starvation, their screams drowned out by the noise of generators or cars or simply lost in the desert.\n\n\"Out of every thousand, 800 disappear in the lockups,\" said a humanitarian worker monitoring the flow of migrants.\n\nTraffickers who torture are a mix of Yemenis and Ethiopians of different ethnic groups. So victims cannot appeal to tribal loyalties, they are tortured by men from other groups: If the migrants are Oromia, the torturers are Tigrinya.\n\nAt the same time, because the three main ethnic groups don't speak each others' languages, Yemeni smugglers need translators to convey orders to the migrants and monitor their phone conversations with their families.", "description": "RAS AL-ARA, Yemen (AP) \u2014 Zahra struggled in the blue waters of the Gulf of Aden, grasping for the hands of fellow migrants.
