In 2015, Amnesty International said at least 7,000 people had died in military detention in the north-east. More recently, thousands of displaced people have been sent back to unsafe areas to provide a bulwark against Boko Haram, according to officials in Borno.\n\nMore than 3,600 children, including 1,617 girls, were detained by the Nigerian armed forces between 2013 and 2019, according to data collected by the UN, though Human Rights Watch said Nigerian authorities have not allowed the UN access to military detention sites to verify these figures. It is not known how many children are currently in detention.\n\nBefore arriving in Giwa barracks, several children described beatings at the hands of security forces, the report said.\n\nTen-year-old Ibrahim said his family had fled their village after an attack by Boko Haram when he was five and had been arrested several days later by the military.\n\n\u201cWe said we escaped from Boko Haram, but the military did not believe us,\u201d he said. \u201cThey said that we were part of Boko Haram. They hit us children with a rope of animal skin and slapped our parents with the flat end of a long knife. They beat us every day.\u201d\n\nSaeed, 17, who was initially detained in the town of Banki, said he was beaten by the Civilian Joint Task Force, a vigilante group working with the military, in the presence of soldiers.\n\n\u201cThey asked me if I was a member of Boko Haram and beat me up when I said no. They tied my hands and legs and hung me to a tree and continued to flog me. They flogged me and left me tied to the tree from morning till evening \u2026 They shot some people and even beat others to death with sticks.\u201d\n\nOnce they arrived at the barracks, children said they had to sleep close \u201clike razor blades in a pack\u201d, with up to 300 people in a cell, sharing one toilet. Almost half the children who were spoken to said they had seen the dead bodies of other detainees, who some thought had died because of the heat.\n\nA spokesman for Nigeria\u2019s defence headquarters said the military did arrest children attempting to detonate explosives and \u201cprovide tacit support to insurgents\u201d, including information on troop movements, but that children were treated as \u201cvictims of war and not as suspects\u201d.\n\n\u201cApprehended children are kept in secured places, where they are adequately fed, profiled and de-radicalised before their release,\u201d said Onyema Nwachukwu.", "description": "Human Rights Watch says thousands of children were detained in distressing conditions by military over last six years", "authors": ["Ruth Maclean"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86141d305329e41ee54f848e85a6bca2c7ea86c1/69_284_5126_3075/master/5126.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=98c1071563a5a041600f7675b7303d67", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
