Leaders from both parties and both houses of Congress joined in the criticism, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Trump\u2019s fellow Republican.\n\n\u201cAs I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I\u2019ve done before!)\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nTurkey\u2019s lira slid more than 2% to its lowest level in more than a month against the dollar on Monday over concerns about the planned incursion into northern Syria and Trump\u2019s warning.\n\nInvestors have been closely watching tense ties between Ankara and Washington in recent months, with the countries at odds over a range of issues, including Syria and Turkey\u2019s purchase of Russian missile defense systems.\n\nTurkey has repeatedly threatened to carry out an incursion against U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters in northeastern Syria who have links to Kurdish guerrillas operating next door in Turkey.\n\nThe United States began pulling troops back from the northeast Syrian border on Monday, effectively giving Turkey a green light to move into the area.\n\nEarlier on Monday, Trump said the United States should leave others from European allies to Iranian foes, \u201cto figure the situation out\u201d in the region.\n\nHe wrote on Twitter that \u201cit is time for us to get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars, many of them tribal, and bring our soldiers home. WE WILL FIGHT WHERE IT IS TO OUR BENEFIT, AND ONLY FIGHT TO WIN. Turkey, Europe, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Russia and the Kurds will now have to figure the situation out.\u201d\n\n\u2018STAB IN THE BACK\u2019\n\nIt is a major policy shift that was denounced as a \u201cstab in the back\u201d by Kurdish-led forces who have been Washington\u2019s most capable partners in fighting Islamic State in Syria, also known by its acronym ISIS.\n\nU.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, called on Trump to \u201creverse this dangerous decision\u201d to withdraw, saying in a statement that it threatened regional security and sent a message to Iran and Russia, as well as U.S. allies, that the United States is no longer a trusted partner.\n\nMcConnell, the Republican Senate leader, said in a statement: \u201cA precipitous withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria would only benefit Russia, Iran, and the Assad regime. And it would increase the risk that ISIS and other terrorist groups regroup.\u201d\n\nLindsey Graham, a Republican senator who is generally a vocal Trump supporter, on the Fox News Channel criticized the Syria pullout decision as \u201cimpulsive.\u201d\n\nU.S. and Turkish military forces conduct a joint ground patrol inside the security mechanism area in northeast, Syria, October 4, 2019.
