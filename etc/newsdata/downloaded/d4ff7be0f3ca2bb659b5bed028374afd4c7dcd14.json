Following this development, shares of the company jumped as much as 25% in premarket trade yesterday. However, this was offset soon after as the stock (and the bonds) took a massive hit post investors\u2019 disappointment with the withdrawal of McDermott\u2019s 2019 outlook and high-debt costs. The company ended the day witnessing more than 13% decline.\n\nUnder this near-term liquidity deal, McDermott \u2014 an oilfield service provider \u2014 can immediately access a $550-million term loan and $100 million in letters of credit, which in turn, will help the company finance its working capital and back the issuance of required performance guarantees on new projects.\n\nWith regard to this credit agreement, McDermott president and CEO David Dickson stated that \u201cthis new credit agreement is a continued signal from our lenders that they support McDermott, our underlying business, growth strategy and ability to achieve a long-term balance sheet solution.\"\n\nAt the same time, McDermott \u2014 shares of which tanked 70% to a 16-year low recently following rumours of a potential bankruptcy circulated in the media \u2014 terminated the earlier-announced sale of its industrial storage tank business. While this created some uncertainty about the company\u2019s future amid investors, its high interest rate of roughly 10% on the new debt raised concerns over its elevated interest expense. However, this Houston-based company continues to mull over divesting its industry-leading Lummus Technology business after piquing prospective buyers\u2019 curiosity.\n\nIt is important to note that how the remaining part of this loan will be used by McDermott is contingent upon various conditions based on the lenders\u2019 decisions.\n\nThe company is a leading provider of integrated engineering, procurement, construction and installation (EPCI), front-end engineering and design (FEED), and module fabrication services for upstream field developments worldwide. It delivers fixed and floating production facilities, pipelines, installations and subsea systems from concept to commissioning for complex Offshore and Subsea oil and gas projects to help oil companies safely produce and transport hydrocarbons.\n\nMcDermott International, Inc.
