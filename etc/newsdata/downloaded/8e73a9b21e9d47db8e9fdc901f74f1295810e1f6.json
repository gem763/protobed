Wade", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-09-03", "text": "Christine Blasey Ford and her feminist attorney were \u201cmotivated\u201d in their attack on then-federal judge Brett Kavanaugh by their passion to protect abortion rights, not just their \u201ccivic duty\u201d to provide information to senators considering his nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court, according to a new investigative book about the hearings last year.\n\nIn Search and Destroy: Inside the Campaign Against Brett Kavanaugh, National Law Journal\u2019s Ryan Lovelace revealed Ford and attorney Debra Katz leveled charges of sexual misconduct in hopes of eventually tainting decisions by Kavanaugh on abortion.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, he wrote, they worked overtime to orchestrate their explosive charges, heatedly denied by Kavanaugh, to land at the end of the confirmation hearings in a bid to derail President Trump\u2019s second pick to the high court.\n\nOver 256 pages, Lovelace detailed a campaign to sabotage the Kavanaugh confirmation and how his accusers traded charges \u201cup the chain\u201d through the media and sympathetic Senate Democrats.\n\nBut it is a speech Katz gave after Kavanaugh was approved in a 50-48 Senate vote where Lovelace said he found the key motivation for Ford\u2019s tearful accusation that while in high school the federal judge attempted to rape her in a beer-fueled attack.\n\nIn April this year, she spoke at the University of Baltimore\u2019s 11th Feminist Legal Theory Conference titled \u201cApplied Feminism and #MeToo.\u201d Lovelace secured a video of her address and provided a clip to Secrets.\n\nIn it, she said their goal was to put an \u201casterisk\u201d on a prediction that Kavanaugh would rule to limit Roe v. Wade, though he had little history of attacking the 1973 decision to protect abortion.\n\nKatz said:\n\n\u201cIn the aftermath of these hearings, I believe that Christine\u2019s testimony brought about more good than the harm misogynist Republicans caused by allowing Kavanaugh on the court. We were going to have a conservative [justice] ... elections have consequences, but he will always have an asterisk next to his name. When he takes a scalpel to Roe v. Wade, we will know who he is, we know his character, and we know what motivates him, and that is important; it is important that we know, and that is part of what motivated Christine.\u201d\n\nLovelace explained, \u201cFord\u2019s audience was not the Senate, as Katz had previously suggested, but the American people. If they could be persuaded that Justice Kavanaugh was a predator, then they might not accept a future ruling by the five Republican-appointed justices altering the right to obtain an abortion established by Roe v. Wade. Had the Senate understood Ford\u2019s real motivation, as described by Katz, it might have appreciated more fully the pressure that \u2018organized forces\u2019 were applying.\u201d\n\nRegnery Publishing provided Secrets with book excerpts in advance of its release Tuesday.\n\nLovelace also said that Katz was angry at the white men in charge of the process in confirming Kavanaugh and that Trump\u2019s team was driven to discredit Ford with \u201crelentless cruelty.\u201d\n\nShe said, he wrote, \u201cWhen I think about her role in history, I don\u2019t think about the white men on the Judiciary Committee, I think of the diverse young people outside the Capitol, standing up for her with their bodies and their words. That is the lasting impact of her bravery.\u201d\n\nIn the video of the speech, partially transcribed in \u201cSearch and Destroy,\u201d she also described Kavanaugh as savage.\n\nLovelace wrote, \u201cKatz argued that Ford \u2018cooperated fully, even though the process was fixed and the result was a foregone conclusion,\u2019 while Kavanaugh \u2018was belligerent; he oozed with rage, and contempt for the process.\u2019 She praised the anti-Kavanaugh activists: \u2018Had there not been strong forces, organized forces, people in the street like you all, they would have figured out a way to bury her.'\u201d\n\nAfter Ford\u2019s testimony, Kavanaugh ripped the nomination process.\n\n\u201cThis confirmation process has become a national disgrace,\u201d Kavanaugh said, adding, \u201cThe Constitution gives the Senate an important role in the confirmation process, but you have replaced advice and consent with search and destroy. Since my nomination in July, there\u2019s been a frenzy on the left to come up with something, anything to block my confirmation.\u201d\n\nSearch and Destory is the latest book on the Kavanaugh nomination that details a campaign by the Left to kill his chances at winning a seat on the Supreme Court.\n\nJustice on Trial: The Kavanaugh Confirmation and the Future of the Supreme Court, by Mollie Hemingway and Carrie Severino, was a national bestseller. It was also published by Regnery and released in June.", "description": "Christine Blasey Ford and her feminist attorney were \u201cmotivated\u201d in their attack on then-federal judge Brett Kavanaugh by their passion to protect abortion rights, not just their \u201ccivic duty\u201d to provide information to senators considering his nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court, according to a new investigative book about the hearings last year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bb25585/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2290x1202+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediadc.brightspotcdn.com%2F47%2F68%2F1d01ad564c9bbd2eb288c0525ea0%2Fchristine-blasey-ford-ex.jpg"}
