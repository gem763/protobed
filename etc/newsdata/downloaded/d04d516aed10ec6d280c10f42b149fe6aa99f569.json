And Brunson could only think what might have been had he beaten either one of them.\n\n\u201cIt was bittersweet,\u201d Brunson said Tuesday during media day for Dominance MMA. \u201cI don\u2019t like to make excuses. We sign up for fights, and we go out there and fight, but a lot of the fights that I lost, it was kind of due to my dumbness. Just a little too aggressive, didn\u2019t have the right mentality.\u201d\n\nBrunson faced newly crowned middleweight champ Adesanya in November 2018 and was never really able to find his groove. He lost a first-round TKO, in a fight that he believes he didn\u2019t prepare well for.\n\nBut no excuses from Brunson, who\u2019s taking all of this as a lesson.\n\n\u201cEven with the Israel fight, we had a hurricane, so I was without power for like two weeks,\u201d Brunson said. \u201cI didn\u2019t train for like two weeks, and I had a pregnant fiancee, so it\u2019s just a lot of things that come up that it\u2019s not really worth sharing, because it don\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nBrunson (20-7 MMA, 11-5 UFC) now has won his last two fights and feels like a more refined version of himself. He credits that to the Hard Knocks gym in Florida, where he recently made the switch.\n\n\u201cYou go out there, and you fight, and you win or you lose, but me personally, dealing with myself, I\u2019m like man I know I can win these fights if I had the proper preparation,\u201d Brunson said. \u201cAnd switching up my training camps, and being in Florida at Hard Knocks, for like the last two camps has been really big for me. Really good training partners, really good coaching staff, and I feel that moving forward, we can make a really big impact.\u201d", "description": "Riding a two-fight winning, Derek Brunson hopes his move to Hard Knocks keeps his momentum going.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Nolan King", "Mike Bohn", "John Morgan", "Ken Hathaway", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Simon Head", "Dan Tom"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/derek-brunson-dominance-media-day.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
