And it amounted to the latest extraordinary effort by Trump to openly request political assistance from foreign governments.\n\nThursday\u2019s comments weren\u2019t the first time Trump has injected Biden into his relationship with China, though he said Thursday he has never pushed Xi to investigate the former vice president. Nor is it the first time he has sought to trade favors with Xi, who this week celebrated the 70th birthday of his ruling communist party with a note of congratulations from Trump.\n\nDuring a phone call with Xi on June 18, Trump raised Biden\u2019s political prospects as well as those of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who by then had started rising in the polls, according to two people familiar with the discussion. In that call, Trump also told Xi he would remain quiet on Hong Kong protests as trade talks progressed.", "description": "", "authors": ["Cnn.Com Politics Trump-Biden-Call-Xi-Secure-Server Index.Html"], "top_image": ""}
