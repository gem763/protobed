She has risen in the polls and is now tied with Joe Biden atop the Real Clear Politics average. And that rise will likely continue, since she is bound to benefit from Bernie Sanders\u2019 health crisis.\n\nShe and Sanders have spent the year so far splitting the progressive Democratic vote, and his heart attack last week, as well as the three days of prevaricating his campaign did about it, will likely hasten his polling decline.\n\nSanders did not appear in the CNN town hall dedicated to gay issues due to his ongoing recovery, which surely raises questions about whether he will actually be on the stage Tuesday when the Democratic field meets for its October debate.\n\nWarren was there, though, and her performance revealed both why she delights her base in the elite media \u2014 and why Donald Trump is so eager to run against her he was willing to play an incredibly high-risk game by trying any means necessary to knock Joe Biden\u2019s candidacy off its course.\n\nYou could watch in real time as the media simply melted into a puddle of excited goo when Warren delivered a well-rehearsed zinger Thursday night \u2014 a line so perfectly delivered it just seems impossible it came to her spontaneously.\n\nShe was asked what she would do if a supporter of hers said marriage was between one man and one woman \u2014 which is kind of an odd question for a forum in which candidates were supposed to detail just what new goodies they might provide to a rock-solid Democratic constituency.\n\nHer answer: \u201cWell, I\u2019m going to assume it\u2019s a guy who said that, and I\u2019m going to say, \u2018Then just marry one woman. I\u2019m cool with that.\u2019\u201d So far, so good \u2014 a clever and polite way of handling a question with a very deep and complex root.\n\nBut she wasn\u2019t done. With the timing of a good stand-up, she paused for laughter and then added: \u201cAssuming you can find one.\u201d Meaning a woman.\n\nIn other words, a man who believes in traditional marriage is someone no woman would, or should, want to touch.\n\nIt went viral, of course, which was its purpose. Now let\u2019s unpack it. Without question, no social question has moved more quickly in public opinion than gay marriage. In 2004, according to Gallup, it was opposed by three out of five people, and now it is supported by three out of five people. That\u2019s a huge shift.\n\nBut it\u2019s still the case that about a third of the country opposes gay marriage and therefore believes marriage is between a man and a woman. Even more notable, the barest majority of African Americans in 2019 say they support gay marriage.\n\nRemember that Democrats need really high black turnout to win the election in 2020. Now, every candidate in the Democratic field supports gay marriage, so it\u2019s not as though there is any debate on that score inside Warren\u2019s party.\n\nBut did Warren really have to disrespect every person who believes in traditional marriage by caricaturing them as incels so that she would receive the worshipful applause of a crowd at a CNN town hall whose audience was somewhere around 11 people? Evidently she did, or thinks she did, or thinks there is a reward down the road for her in doing so.\n\nSupport for traditional marriage correlates closely with religious faith. Gallup polling says only 40% of those who attend religious services once a week support gay marriage. Doubtless many of the others might still cast a ballot for a Democrat because they are likely not single-issue voters. Warren can secure their votes despite her support for gay marriage.\n\nYet she threatens her own efforts to get their vote by mocking and demeaning them in a pretty surprising way. She might as well just call them \u2026 deplorable. Why not? She already called them ugly.\n\nIf you think this is something Donald Trump wouldn\u2019t use against her in the general election to potent effect, you don\u2019t know Trump \u2014 and you don\u2019t know America.\n\njpodhoretz@gmail.com", "description": "Elizabeth Warren's response at a CNN town hall dedicated to gay issues threatens her efforts to get votes of Americans who oppose gay marriage, which is likely something Trump would use against her in the general election.", "authors": ["John Podhoretz", "October"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/liz-warren-lgbt.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
