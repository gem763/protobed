The legal alcohol limit for driving is 35mg.\n\nJohnson admitted drink driving but avoided jail after revealing she had been suffering from depression which had been 'aggravated' following the birth of her fourth child.\n\nProsecutor James Gore told the court officers found Johnson 'intoxicated' and smelling of alcohol.\n\nHe added: 'There was half a bottle of vodka in the front seat and two further bottles, both empty, of vodka and wine.\n\n'She admitted she had been drinking 20 minutes before. She said she has an alcohol problem and had started drinking after an argument with her partner.\n\n'She said she had drunk alcohol all night in her car, slept in the vehicle and drove in the morning to an off licence.\n\n'She tried to drive back but broke down with no petrol. She said that she was remorseful for her actions and was disgusted by her behaviour.'\n\nJohnson will have to complete 20 rehabilitation days and pay \u00a3675 in costs.
