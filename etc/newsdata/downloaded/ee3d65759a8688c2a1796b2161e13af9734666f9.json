This time around, as Trump faces an impeachment inquiry for withholding aid to Ukraine while pressuring President Volodymyr Zelenksy to investigate the business dealings of Hunter Biden (followed by the administration\u2019s attempt to cover up the exchange), Miller went on Fox News Sunday to inform the public that the president is the only option for real democracy in America.\n\n\u201cDo you want a democracy in this country or do you want a deep state?\u201d Miller asked and answered. \u201cIt\u2019s a binary choice for the American people.\u201d He may have forgotten the word \u201cfalse\u201d in there before \u201cbinary.\u201d\n\nStephen Miller on Whistleblower:\n\n\n\n\"Chris, I've worked in the federal government now for nearly 3 years. I know what the deep state looks like. I know the difference between a whistleblower and a deep state operative. This is a deep state operative pure and simple.\" pic.twitter.com/YCriY5YpGQ \u2014 The Columbia Bugle \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@ColumbiaBugle) September 29, 2019\n\nMiller also attacked the intelligence officer who reported Trump\u2019s behavior, lamenting that the term \u201cwhistle-blower\u201d has been appointed to them. To Miller, it\u2019s an \u201chonorific that this individual most certainly does not deserve. A partisan hit job does not make you a whistle-blower just because you go through the Whistle-blower Protection Act.\u201d Of course, by protocol, that\u2019s exactly what this individual is, as confirmed in Thursday\u2019s testimony from the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, who stated that the whistle-blower acted \u201cby the book and followed the law.\u201d\n\n\"Stephen Miller and Chris Wallace go head-to-head over Trump-Ukraine relationship\" https://t.co/LoZCWSJy02 \u2014 SanctuarySisters (@JaniceOnley9) September 29, 2019\n\nDuring the Fox News Sunday interview, Miller also offered a galaxy-brain take on Trump\u2019s role in the developing scandal, claiming that the president is the real whistle-blower in the crisis. \u201cThe president of the United States is the whistle-blower and this individual is a saboteur trying to undermine a democratically elected government,\u201d Miller said. It\u2019s a perspective that does contain some truth, although one might need to zoom out much further than Miller intends for the comparison to be helpful. If Trump is a whistle-blower, then he\u2019s telling on himself, revealing just how corrupt a presidency can get when all legal and ethical concerns are dropped at the expense of personal gain.", "description": "White House senior adviser Stephen Miller spoke to Fox News\u2019 Chris Wallace telling him that Trump is the real whistle-blower in the Ukraine whistle-blower scandal that led to an impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Matt Stieb"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/26/stephen_miller.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
