ESPN reported that the NBA's general counsel Rich Buchanan told team owners in attendance that enforcement would mean \"seizing servers and cellphones.\"\n\nThe audit creates a slippery slope for the NBA and its teams. Silver on Friday said the NBA wouldn't look into matters beyond the scope of its investigations unless there is a matter that needs addressing. According to reports, some wonder what will happen if the NBA stumbles onto problematic information beyond what was initially investigated.\n\nThe new rules also aim to crack down on teams offering benefits beyond the salary cap to recruit star players. According to ESPN, teams felt \"the recruitment of Kawhi Leonard became fraught with charges that his uncle and advisor, Dennis Robertson, requested benefits outside the boundaries of the salary cap.\"\n\nNonetheless, ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported that one GM already knows teams will find new ways to get around the rules.\n\n\"I'll follow the rules,\" an unnamed GM told Wojnarowski. \"Until I find out others aren't, and I'm at a competitive disadvantage.\"", "description": "The NBA is cracking down on tampering, going as far as to investigate teams' communications with other teams and player agents.", "authors": ["Scott Davis"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d852e432e22af68ad500446-1334-667.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
