He said the plan was to appeal for the lesser classification if the matter came before a hearing .\n\n\u201cOur staff failed to bring those changes to the board \u2014 we admit that,\u201d he said.\n\nBaffert has endured previous regulatory proceedings in California\n\nIn 2013, after seven horses in his care died over a 16-month period, he was the subject of a report by the board, which revealed he had been giving every horse in his barn a thyroid hormone without checking to see if any of them had thyroid problems.\n\nBaffert told the investigators that he thought the medication would help \u201cbuild up\u201d his horses even though the drug is generally associated with weight loss. In that case, the board\u2019s report found no evidence \u201cthat C.H.R.B. rules or regulations have been violated.\u201d\n\nIn r etirement, Justify mates as often as three times a day. Coolmore, the international breeding concern that bought Justify\u2019s breeding rights, receives as much as $150,000 for a mating, or $450,000 a day over a five-month breeding season. That means Coolmore has already recouped its $60 million investment.\n\nJustify is currently in Australia. Owners there have their mares lined up in the hope of getting what is supposed to be the perfect seed from the perfect racehorse.", "description": "Bob Baffert guided Justify to the 2018 Triple Crown, but a month before the Kentucky Derby, the horse failed a drug test that could have ended that campaign before it began.", "authors": ["Joe Drape"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/11/sports/11justify-promo-sub3/11justify-promo-sub3-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
