Will That Matter?", "language": "en", "text": "Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont needed a big moment at the Democratic debate on Tuesday. Absent from the campaign trail after suffering a heart attack two weeks earlier, he and his aides were aware that his performance and his health would be under intense scrutiny.\n\nMr. Sanders made his mark, but it did not occur onstage: His presidential campaign confirmed that he had secured the endorsements of two of the most prominent left-wing women of color in Congress, Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota.\n\nMr. Sanders will appear alongside Ms. Ocasio-Cortez at 1 p.m. on Saturday at Queensbridge Park in Queens at his first rally since his heart attack, when she is expected to formally announce her support. The crowd is likely to be large and diverse ; Mr. Sanders even teased the rally and a \u201cspecial guest\u201d during the debate.\n\nThe endorsements jolted the primary race, signaling that Mr. Sanders, 78, was still a formidable contender just as it had increasingly seemed like a contest between Senator Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. They also shifted the conversation away from his health issues and his age, infusing his campaign with a renewed sense of vitality.", "description": "Mr. Sanders, in his first rally since his heart attack, will appear in Queens with Ms. Ocasio-Cortez.
