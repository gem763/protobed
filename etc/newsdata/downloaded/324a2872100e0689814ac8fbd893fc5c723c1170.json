But optimism in Brussels rapidly dissipated, after Johnson prorogued parliament and stepped up his no-deal rhetoric, while failing to put any proposals on paper.\n\nA spate of recent reports from London analysts that a deal was becoming more likely were dismissed as \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d by one senior EU official.\n\nJohnson\u2019s latest rhetorical fancy \u2013 that, like the Incredible Hulk, the UK would break out of its \u201cmanacles\u201d on 31 October \u2013 has further fuelled EU scepticism about his sincerity.\n\nDescribing the language as \u201cnot very surprising\u201d, the EU source said: \u201cIt all makes it look like it\u2019s a bit of a joke. We are talking about something extremely serious. The consequences of no deal will be extremely serious and it looks like this is being treated as a game in which you are the hero sort of story rather than [dealing] with real lives.\u201d\n\nJuncker said a no-deal Brexit would be a mess and take years to resolve. Speaking to Deutschlandfunk, he said patriots in the UK \u201cwould not wish your country such a fate\u201d.\n\nHe said the EU knew what the British did not want, but were still waiting for alternative backstop proposals: \u201cI hope we can get them, but time is running out.\u201d\n\nQ&A What is a Northern Ireland-only backstop? Show Hide The British government\u2019s version of Brexit involves the UK ultimately leaving the single market and customs union, requiring the return of a range of checks on goods crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The \u201cbackstop\u201d is intended as a standstill placeholder to ensure such checks do not have to be imposed between Brexit happening with a deal, and the start of a new free trade agreement yet to be negotiated between the UK and the EU. Theresa May's withdrawal agreement proposed keeping the whole of the UK in a shared customs territory with the EU during this period. An alternative idea involves only Northern Ireland staying in the EU\u2019s customs territory. That would place a customs border in the Irish Sea. May described it as a threat to the constitutional integrity of the UK, but the new prime minister, Boris Johnson, has opened the current talks by proposing an all-Ireland agri-food zone. The suggestion is that he will seek to quietly build on that with further NI-only arrangements. Given an NI-only backstop was an EU proposal in the first place, the U-turn would be warmly welcomed in Brussels, although attempts to give the Northern Ireland assembly a veto on its continuation would not be acceptable, and the DUP would be unlikely to support the prime minister in such a move in parliament. If there is a no-deal Brexit, then there is no backstop. Daniel Boffey\n\nEU officials hope the meeting will create momentum towards an agreement. The outgoing commission president is not involved in day-to-day Brexit talks, but has intervened at crisis points. In March, for example, he tried to help Theresa May sell the deal to Conservative backbenchers, with pledges that the EU did not want to trap the UK in the backstop.\n\nThe backstop, a fallback plan for avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland, continues to keep both sides at loggerheads. Johnson is adamant the backstop must go, while the EU insists any exit agreement must contain the backstop or a legally watertight equivalent.\n\nIn Friday\u2019s talks, Frost outlined ideas for an all-Ireland regulatory regime for food and agriculture, which Downing Street thinks would go a long way to replacing the backstop.\n\nBrussels thinks these ideas fall far short of what is required to protect European markets from dangerous goods, fraud or unfair competition. EU officials say food safety, animal, plant and health measures cannot be separated from customs, because otherwise no one would know what is entering European markets.\n\nOfficials say the UK has put forward unfinished ideas on sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures, which leave many questions unanswered, such as definitions of SPS goods and the scope of SPS regulations.\n\n\u201cAs the UK starts exploring the question and starts to put ideas forward, they are starting to realise how complex SPS is,\u201d the source said.\n\nHowever, officials see some positive steps: they think the UK has agreed to \u201cdynamic alignment\u201d on food and agriculture, meaning Northern Ireland would automatically accept updates to the EU rulebook in these areas.\n\nWith time running short to resolve highly technical issues that touch on sensitive political questions, the EU is also uncertain whether Johnson can get a Commons majority for a deal.\n\nThe Johnson government has a \u201ccredibility problem\u201d over whether it could get a revised agreement passed in the Commons, one EU diplomat said. \u201cWhat kind of mandate does Mr Johnson have? Since he doesn\u2019t have a majority and no party is really clear on [Brexit] then it would certainly be good to engage the opposition.\u201d", "description": "PM\u2019s upbeat account dismissed as Jean-Claude Juncker warns time is running out", "authors": ["Jennifer Rankin", "Daniel Boffey", "Jonathan Freedland", "Ell Smith"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85377038aacd71b2c0e55b0a55478165fe6d3014/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=75c564afa791b2ba10bc80259dcbdb7b", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
