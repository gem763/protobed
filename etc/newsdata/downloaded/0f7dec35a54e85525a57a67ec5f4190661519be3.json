The Brasilia Grand Slam illustrated the importance of experience. With three out of four champions over the age of thirty.\n\nRussian 31-year-old mainstay Musa Mogushkov took on home fighter, David Lima who had no answer to Mogushkov\u2019s impeccable technique when he fired in with a sublime tai otoshi to topple the Brazilian and take the gold - strengthening his push for Olympic qualification with a strong performance in Brasilia.\n\n\"It\u2019s not usual for me to use this technique in competition, but I practice this throw in training, and I felt that this was a perfect moment for it and it was great that I was able to get it done,\" said Mogushkov.\n\nMr Decio Brasil, Special Secretary of Sport of the Citizenship Ministry of Brasil gave the medals.\n\nIn the under 70KG category, Colombia's three-time world champion Yuri Alvear powered her way through her preliminary fights, throwing for ippon in every contest and spending a total of only 3 minutes on the tatami.\n\nWaiting for her in the final was emerging German talent, Giovanna Scoccimarro who had her eyes set on a second world tour gold. But Alvear scored the decisive wazari, took the Brasilia Grand Slam title and became our woman of the day.\n\n\"What I think is the most important thing in these matches is to remain calm, and that comes with experience, I've learned to stay calmer over the years and every time I've done so I\u2019ve got a great result,\" said Alvear.\n\nThe medals were presented by His Excellency Ronaldo Gomez, the Ambassador for Cuba in Brazil.\n\nIn the under 81kg category Japanese former world champion Nagase continued his resurgence, taking his third world tour gold in a row\n\nHis medal was presented by His Excellency Akira Yamada Ambassador for Japan in Brazil.\n\nThere was a guaranteed Brazilian champion in the under 63kg category with both athletes searching for their first grand slam gold.\n\n2008 Olympic bronze medallist Ketleyn Quadros, took on Alexia Castilhos.
