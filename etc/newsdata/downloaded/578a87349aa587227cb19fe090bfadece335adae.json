The shares of the former smartphone manufacturer and now software provider slid 22.6% following disappointing second-quarter earnings results.\n\nThe company fell short of consensus estimates on the revenue side with a corresponding huge net loss. There were questions regarding the use of non-standard numbers, which did not conform to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). With the stock down to a multi-year low, is it time to buy?\n\nWeak demand and increasing competition The revenue of BlackBerry for Q2 2019 rose by 1.2% from $210 million to $244 million from a year ago but below the consensus estimate of $268 million. The company registered a net loss of $44 million after posting a $43 million profit for the same period last year.\n\nOn an adjusted per-share basis, BlackBerry recorded breakeven earnings. According to management, the performance of the company was affected by the investments connected with Cylance. BlackBerry bought the cybersecurity company last February and is in the process of being integrated into its business.\n\nThe Waterloo, Ontario-based company is struggling because of weak demand for its products and increasing competition. The sales from BlackBerry\u2019s Internet of Things business, which covers the enterprise software and technology solutions units, fell by 5% to $134 million versus a year ago.\n\nCylance contributed $51 million in sales, while revenue from the licensing division increased from $56 million to $71 million. The other segment posted $5 million in sales. BlackBerry\u2019s executive chairman and CEO John Chen said the positive reception on BlackBerry Intelligent Security is encouraging.\n\nBlackBerry will be launching several exciting new products in the next six months. The company is integrating its endpoint management and AI technologies and capabilities on one platform to address the high-growth endpoint security market.\n\nBiggest loser Fairfax Financial Holdings, the company of Prem Watsa, who is known as Canada\u2019s Warren Buffett, lost more than $160 million in his top five listed Canadian investments. The main contributor to Fairfax\u2019s losses was BlackBerry.\n\nPaul Rivett, Fairfax\u2019s president said, \u201cSince we started in 1985, we always take a long-term view and we believe these recent price moves are short-term fluctuations on only a few of our stock holdings.\u201d He added, \u201cIt is also worth mentioning that half of our BlackBerry position is in a convertible debenture.\u201d\n\nGrowth drivers needed At the beginning of the year, BlackBerry was showing signs of a major comeback. The stock was able to gain momentum, as investors were expecting the broader endpoint security market to pick up steam.\n\nBlackBerry\u2019s acquisition of Cylance is part of its strategic mission to gain a significant market in the endpoint security market that is estimated to be worth $11 billion.\n\nThe collective market share for all the next-generation endpoint security players, including Cylance is less than 10%. With continued innovation, there is room to grow.\n\nDespite the terrible quarterly earnings, analysts see no downsides but plenty of growth drivers for BlackBerry in 2020. You can buy on the dip and heed Prem Watsa\u2019s advice. Have a long-term view on BlackBerry and don\u2019t look at short-term fluctuations.\n\nFool contributor Christopher Liew has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.
