Sounds that were once eliminated by Bose\u2019s signature NC have been more audible after the update, and this has driven people to downgrade their firmware to restore performance.\n\nIn an update posted to its community forums yesterday, Bose noted that it\u2019s still working on the issue. \u201cOur engineering and service teams remain dedicated to getting to the bottom of what\u2019s going on here,\u201d Bose wrote. But the company is asking affected customers for a bit of face-to-face help. Seemingly unable to get the full picture of what\u2019s happening in its own engineering labs, Bose has scheduled in-person visits with QC35II owners so it can test and observe the headphones \u201cin a live setting.\u201d\n\nStrangely, Bose marked the forum thread \u2014 over 150 pages long \u2014 as \u201csolved\u201d to \u201cincrease visibility\u201d of its latest message, and some posters are now pretty irked about that, too.\n\nAny QC35II customers within \u201ca reasonable distance\u201d from Bose\u2019s Framingham, Massachusetts, headquarters can fill out a survey if they\u2019re willing to let the company come over. The process will start with a phone call, during which Bose will decide whether to arrange an in-person test. It seems like the company doesn\u2019t mind doing a bit of traveling, as even people in bordering states are eligible.\n\nWhen the problems initially arose, Bose insisted that it hadn\u2019t tinkered with noise cancellation in any recent firmware, and it encouraged customers to go through normal support channels for servicing. But this latest effort at least shows that the company is taking this situation pretty seriously. If there\u2019s really an underlying issue, Bose is determined to find it.\n\nBose has a new flagship set of very good noise-canceling headphones on the market now, the Noise Canceling Headphones 700. But the QC35IIs remain available for sale at a lower price, so there\u2019s every reason for Bose to keep working away on this.\n\nThis continued customer service push comes after Bose discontinued its unique Sleepbuds earlier this month over a battery issue that resulted in unpredictable performance and random shutdowns. The company has said it remains dedicated to producing future products that aid those who have difficulty sleeping.", "description": "Bose is trying to get a handle on a bug that has degraded noise cancellation performance on its Quiet Comfort 35 II headphones for some customers after recent firmware updates.", "authors": ["Chris Welch", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ihGbKgSEY7oHBewtK0UwB8hJI5Y=/0x25:1280x695/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19291932/D84D0DA7_470D_4D27_8FC3_38037D0EB67E.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
