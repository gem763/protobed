You have not just protected yourself; you have protected other women.\u201d\n\nHis victim told officers how Booth was charming when they first met in 2017 and \u2013 despite warnings from friends about his previous behaviour \u2013 began a relationship with him early the following year.\n\nShe came to realise why her friends were concerned about Booth as his abusive behaviour came to the fore.\n\nBooth was sentenced to 14 years in prison (Picture: SWNS)\n\nThe court heard how, in May of 2018, Booth began drinking to excess, as well as taking drugs, and once home would abuse his victim.\n\nJudge Mansell said: \u2018When at home, you would bully and degrade her by spitting, flicking cigarettes or throwing household items at her, as well as calling her names.\n\n\u2018You pursued her by turning up at her home and the beauty salon where she worked and contacting her friends, but then left her alone for about a month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018However, you met up with her in July 2018 and persuaded her that you would change and so she agreed to start seeing you again.\n\n\u2018Very soon you reverted to the same kind of behaviour.\u2019\n\nIn the September of that year, Booth threatened to kill his victim before wrapping both his hands around her neck as if to strangle her.\n\nThe knife used by Aaron Marsden Booth (Picture: SWNS)\n\nHis victim tried repeatedly to break off their relationship. However, each time Booth would bombard her with calls and texts and force her, through emotional blackmail, to retract her complaints made against him, the court heard.\n\nThe evening prior to the assault, in February of this year, Booth\u2019s victim had been enjoying a night out with her friends \u2013 during which he was caught on CCTV following her from pub to pub.\n\nIn the footage, Booth could be seen becoming increasingly angry as the night went on, before finally his victim had to lock herself in a toilet to get away from him.\n\nAfter Booth, formerly of High Street West, Glossop, was ejected from the pub, his victim left the bar and went home to bed before he turned up at her front door demanding to be let in.\n\nHis victim called police as he attempted to kick the front door down.\n\nDamage to the property when Aaron Marsden Booth broke in (Picture: SWNS)\n\nJudge Mansell said: \u2018She was crying and pleading with the operator to hurry up because you were trying to break in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018After a few moments, there is a huge bang and she lets out a blood-curdling scream of terror as you smashed a window and climbed into the house.\n\n\u2018All that could be heard was her moaning in pain.\n\n\u2018This was a sustained and brutal assault on a defenceless woman.\u2019\n\nAfter being charged with attempted murder, Booth pleaded guilty to a section 18 assault \u2013 wounding with intent \u2013 and was sentenced to 14 years in prison. He must serve at least nine years in prison before he can apply for parole and once freed must serve six years on licence.\n\nHe was also handed an indefinite restraining order which prohibits Booth from contacting his victim.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
