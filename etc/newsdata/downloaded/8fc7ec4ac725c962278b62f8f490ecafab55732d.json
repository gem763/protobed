just a fact of life at certain times there, even as damage clear-up tended to be staggering rapid.\n\nTyphoons are violent but usually short-lived, too.\n\nThis one in Japan demonstrating ominous signs of rare intensity, the RWC organisers have been forced into measures to minimise risk to life and limb.\n\nSaturday so clearly appears to encompass the epicentre of the weather event around certain of Japan\u2019s key metropolises and it has meant the cancellation - at this point - of two matches unlikely to impact final placings anyway in their respective pools.\n\nWhile it is a shame that \u201cLe Crunch\u201d between cross-Channel adversaries England and France won\u2019t now take place, both had happily already qualified for the quarter-finals and the game would really only have determined (it\u2019s now confirmed as leaders England anyway) which of them tops the group.\n\nThat, you might well argue, is of reasonably limited relevance anyway: as we saw from the nerve-jangling bilateral meeting between them at the tournament, it\u2019s a toss-up as to whether it\u2019s better to play Wales or Australia in the QFs.\n\nThen there\u2019s the matter of the New Zealand v Italy now non-event.\n\nYou have to feel a certain sympathy for the Azzurri, who could still have sensationally eliminated the world champions with a really thumping win at the City of the Toyota Stadium.\n\nBut seeing that Italy hadn\u2019t even come close to toppling the All Blacks in 14 prior meetings stretching back to 1987 - they now technically sport one \u201cdraw\u201d, courtesy of the manufactured RWC stalemate - it is reasonably safe to assume the status quo (a wide-margin NZ triumph) would have occurred.\n\nOf immeasurably greater concern, however, to the fairness and credibility of the current tournament is the in-the-balance fate of the so keenly anticipated Sunday \u201celiminator\u201d in gripping Pool A between the host nation and form-gathering Scotland.\n\nIt almost feels like Japan\u2019s very own final \u2026 and frankly every feasible, constructive step MUST be taken to ensure that if the Brave Blossoms are to admirably make the last-eight cut, it doesn\u2019t come by glaringly hollow default.\n\nShould the teams instead be awarded two points each for a \u201cdraw\u201d, Japan will top the pool knowing that they did so without having shown yet that they can beat the Scots, who lead the historical head-to-head by a 7-0 margin.\n\nBut it would create the additionally undesirable situation - even if there won\u2019t be too many grumbles in South Africa - of the All Blacks, who had won the seismic opener against the Springboks to supposedly tee up the \u201ceasier\u201d quarter-final for them, instead probably getting Six Nations-based traditional modern toughies Ireland, and Rassie Erasmus\u2019s charges meeting a Japanese side they whipped 41-7 just before RWC 2019 began.\n\nThat whole scenario would just leave a slightly undesirable taste in many mouths, planet-wide, among rugby aficionados.\n\nOne positive, looking at the long-range outlook on some trustier weather websites, is that ferocious winds and a startling more than 140mm of rain look destined to hit Yokohama between Friday and early Sunday morning ... but both abating enormously several hours before the conveniently night-time kick-off.\n\nEven if the game, as presently scheduled, keeps looking too risky for staging in the coming day or two, the organisers and World Rugby would be doing the event no favours at all if it is also simply declared a no-result with two log points each, and Scotland go home pretty certainly the most disgruntled of all participating nations.\n\nThe clash has a massive bearing on RWC 2019 as a whole and, whether it is pushed back 24 hours, played indoors, elsewhere, or behind closed doors and still televised to the world, this one needs to happen!\n\nAgree?\n\n*Follow our chief writer on Twitter: @RobHouwing", "description": "It is vital for the World Cup\u2019s legitimacy that creative solutions are found to ensure the high-stakes Japan v Scotland humdinger takes place, says <strong>Rob Houwing</strong>.", "authors": ["Rob Houwing", "Chief Writer"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9336/cf020976f67f47389a99aa56a570e903.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
