Parents", "language": "en", "text": "Charter schools are a boutique phenomenon in American education, educating a mere 6% of U.S. school children. But they attract a disproportionate amount of attention\u2014and controversy\u2014because of their unique place in our education ecosystem. Public, tuition-free schools open to all students, but operated independently of school districts, they offer a Rorschach test revealing how one feels about U.S. public education at large. They can be perceived either as engines of innovation and an indispensable means to rescue children from failing neighborhood schools, or as an existential threat draining away resources\u2014both money and engaged families\u2014from traditional public schools.\n\nCollectively, charter schools educate 3.2 million children in 7,000 schools in 43 states and the District of Columbia. None are more polarizing than New York City\u2019s network of about 50 Success Academy schools, which serve 17,000 students\u201494% of whom are from minority backgrounds\u2014under their visionary and lightning-rod leader, Eva Moskowitz. Most are less than a decade old, and all of them are exceptionally high performing. In a city where less than 40% of black and Hispanic children test at proficiency for reading or math, 90% of Success Academy\u2019s students of color passed the most recent state reading test. Virtually all of them\u2014over 98%\u2014did so in math.\n\nTest results should not be the sole measure of school quality, but they\u2019re how we often keep score. By that standard, there\u2019s no such thing as a bad Success Academy school. Its very \u201cworst\u201d campus saw 85% of its students pass last year\u2019s reading test, and in math the worst was 92%\u2014a level of quality and consistency unmatched by any other large charter school network in the U.S.\n\nSuccess Academy does something else that\u2019s unique and mostly unnoticed, but it creates the conditions that make these results possible. By law, oversubscribed charter schools must admit students by lottery. Success Academy has roughly six applicants for every seat, which gives the appearance of a randomly selected student body. But it exercises unusual influence over which students end up actually enrolling. In the end, the chances of an applicant being offered a seat appear to be closer to 50/50 than one-in-six.\n\nEva Moskowitz, founder of Success Academy, in August 2017.

Those who falter fall away.\n\nShare Your Thoughts What has been your experience, or that of parents you know, with charter schools? Join the conversation below.\n\nAt every step, school leaders aggressively preach to prospective parents about their no-nonsense culture and the expectation that parents come with eyes wide open, fully committed to Success Academy\u2019s program and policies, including strict behavior codes, school uniform compliance, supervising homework, reading with children every night and recording what\u2019s read in a log. Parents are warned repeatedly in unsparing language, \u201cSuccess Academy may not be for you.\u201d Significantly, the schools offer no transportation or after-school programs, a potential deal breaker for working single parents or those without the support network to pick up and drop off their children every day.\n\nThis process, whether by happenstance or design, yields a parent body comprised largely of the most motivated parents and those with the organizational skills and resources to meet Success Academy\u2019s high bar for parental engagement. This sets the stage to strive for\u2014and mostly achieve\u2014consistent and high levels of academic achievement \u201cat scale\u201d among low-income children of color, who would otherwise be lost to the dull hum of mediocrity in zoned neighborhood schools.\n\n\u201c To deny low-income families of color the ability to self-select into safe and well-run schools with high expectations is to impose mediocrity on them. \u201d\n\nThis seems unfair\u2014except for the fact that the ability to self-select into a well-run, high-performing school is unremarkable and unquestioned among affluent Americans. When well-off parents pay for their children to attend a private or religious school, or when they move into high-income ZIP codes where inflated home prices and eye-popping property taxes are de facto tuition for excellent \u201cpublic\u201d schools, they are making the same decision as the low-income parents drawn to Success Academy. Both groups are voting with their feet and committing their own resources\u2014money or time\u2014to ensure that their children go to school with the children of similarly engaged and motivated parents.\n\nTo deny low-income families of color the ability to self-select into safe and well-run schools with high expectations is to impose mediocrity on them, ostensibly for the public good. It is a burden that no affluent family is asked or expected to bear. Ms. Moskowitz insists that even if she were allowed to, she would not screen and handpick applicants instead of admitting families by lottery. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do it,\u201d she told me, \u201cbecause I don\u2019t think I could tell who they are.\u201d Perhaps not, but she has created a mechanism for those families to identify themselves.\n\nMs. Moskowitz\u2019s many critics will look at the small but non-trivial hurdles parents must clear as proof that she is not running great schools, merely a sorting mechanism. But this ignores what\u2019s most remarkable about Success Academy: Its schools don\u2019t just match those of affluent suburban districts but easily outperform them. Working with self-selected families under careful conditions, Ms. Moskowitz hasn\u2019t merely closed the achievement gap. She has reversed it.\n\nThe politics of education reform require that we be less than candid about all of this self-sorting, but the upshot for rich and poor alike is clear: School culture and parent buy-in matter. The brand of education pioneered by Success Academy may indeed be \u201cnot for everyone,\u201d but its schools are well run, not the joyless and militaristic hothouses critics imagine. They serve much the same role as Catholic schools did for previous generations of striving New Yorkers. Success Academy suggests the upper limits of what is possible when a critical mass of active and engaged families of color, who happen to be poor, are given permission to exercise the same degree of choice as affluent families.\n\nBut this all must be done sotto voce. One former Success Academy school leader whom I interviewed struck a philosophical tone. \u201cIs it really such a bad thing that this is basically an elite private school that admits by lottery?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time folks in the inner city have had that chance.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not a bad thing. The disparity of opportunity afforded to rich and poor Americans is what must change. The privileged are unfettered in their pursuit of an excellent education for their children; the rest get \u201cequity.\u201d Worse, we are forced to be dishonest in arguments both for and against charter schools, resorting to aspirational, politically pleasing narratives about what it takes to improve outcomes for disadvantaged children. It\u2019s time to stop airbrushing parents out of the picture and to acknowledge the sometimes uncomfortable truth that their role is indispensable.\n\n\u2014Mr. Pondiscio is senior fellow at the Thomas B.
