So far, they haven\u2019t been enough.\n\nGovernment officials have pushed farming incentives, rationing, campaigns encouraging people to eat more chicken\u2014even opening its emergency pork reserves.\n\nBut rising prices still threaten to mar the celebratory mood ahead of the 70th anniversary of Communist Chinese rule on Oct. 1, adding to a litany of headaches that includes the trade war with the U.S. and protests in Hong Kong.\n\nGovernment data released on Tuesday showed prices of pork\u2014a key staple of the Chinese diet\u2014surging 46.7% in August from the year-earlier month, the biggest such jump in eight years. The leap in pork prices alone was enough to lift the overall headline consumer-inflation figure for the month by more than 1 percentage point to match July\u2019s 17-month high.\n\nChen Yufang, 37, purchases pork and other groceries in Nanning for the cafeteria of a private property developer employing about 60 people.

Here, consumers and producers are struggling with the financial fallout from the outbreak.\n\nA vendor selling chicken and lamb at the Nanning wet market.

Even with price cuts across the board, local residents said the meat was still too expensive. Markets selling discounted pork had few customers. Vendors lamented a sales slump they hadn\u2019t seen in decades of doing business.\n\nHe Jie, a 30-year-old father of two, said he was unable to get a ticket after standing in line on the first day. Two days later, he bought a handful of ribs at the same marketplace during a quiet lunch hour, to make into soup for his wife and nursing infant. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine life without pork. But our income is not growing and prices are rising,\u201d he said.\n\nWith few signs of a price reversal, authorities hope citizens will learn to cope. In recent days, state media have begun building a case for not eating pork.\n\nThe Life Times, an official newspaper tied to the People\u2019s Daily, ran a story on Friday last week proclaiming the benefits of eating less pork for one\u2019s health and pocketbook. It recommended chicken or fish instead, eliciting skeptical responses from Chinese readers. \u201cI see. Next time, when beef prices are up, you will say eating beef is bad,\u201d one online user wrote.\n\nIn the latest sign of the distress setting in among policy makers, China\u2019s cabinet on Tuesday urged local officials to step up their efforts to stabilize pork prices, ordering them to \u201censure efficient supply of pork during major holidays\u201d and requiring them to submit progress reports by the end of the year.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a significant reversal in the direction of policy,\u201d said Zhang Wendong, an assistant economics professor at Iowa State University and co-founder of the school\u2019s China Ag Center. \u201cI think the Chinese government originally underestimated the potential magnitude of this outbreak.\u201d\n\nIn Nanning, Wang Yuling, a vendor who has been selling pork for more than 20 years, said the recent government subsidies wouldn\u2019t be enough to keep her afloat. \u201cThat money can\u2019t do anything. I will have to close my business and go back to farming again,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Nanning Daily, an official newspaper, quoted the city\u2019s economic-planning agency acknowledging the impact of high pork prices, saying they had severely affected the lives of locals. Nanning officials didn\u2019t reply to requests to comment.\n\nIn the longer run, some analysts said, one of the government\u2019s biggest hurdles will be persuading farmers to raise more pigs after more than a year of combating the disease. Without a viable vaccine for African swine fever, the threat of another outbreak has discouraged farmers from expanding or restoring production.\n\nTwo months ago, Mr. Luo bought about 5,000 chickens that now roam freely around the empty concrete pig pens at his farm. Photo: RAUL ARIANO FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\n\nThe possibility of infection compelled Luo Hengfeng, 63, to rush his hogs to market at a 40% discount, despite the fact, he said, that none of them had fallen ill. Two months ago, the farmer bought about 5,000 chickens that now roam freely around the empty concrete pig pens. Out of a herd of hogs that once numbered more than 500, Mr. Luo now has just two\u2014piglets he has kept to see whether or not they\u2019re capable of surviving. So far, Mr. Luo said, they seem to be healthy.\n\n\u201cIf there are vaccines, I\u2019d like to keep raising pigs until I\u2019m 70,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2014Liyan Qi contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Stephanie Yang at stephanie.yang@wsj.com", "description": "Beijing has tried a variety of measures in recent weeks to bump up the pork supply and bring down prices after a yearlong outbreak of African swine fever decimated the country\u2019s hogs.
