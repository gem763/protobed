Marcia Fudge, the Democratic chairwoman of the House Administration Committee\u2019s subcommittee on elections, said during a hearing Thursday on Capitol Hill that she would like to see her own state added to the list of those that have to come under Justice Department oversight in how they run their elections \u2014 part of a process known as preclearance.\n\n\u201cI do believe [Ohio] should be a preclearance state,\u201d she said.\n\nFudge, as chairwoman of the elections subcommittee \u2014 which was resurrected by Democrats this year after Republicans dissolved the panel in 2013 \u2014 has been holding a series of hearings, including eight outside Washington, D.C. The subcommittee is also planning to release a report before the end of this year outlining its recommendations.\n\nAttendees hold signs during a news conference in June on the state of voting rights in the United States.

Rodney Davis of Illinois.\n\nThe broad aim of these hearings is to provide documentary and legally sufficient evidence in support of House Resolution 4, which was introduced earlier this year and which aims to provide a new legal standard for the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division to block state and local governments from enacting laws that are deemed discriminatory.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s Shelby v. Holder decision in 2013 removed the requirement for state or local governments with a history of racial discrimination to seek permission from the Justice Department before making \u201cchanges to state election law \u2014 however innocuous \u2014 until they have been precleared by federal authorities in Washington, D.C.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nRep.

Fudge\u2019s hearings are seeking to provide that data.\n\nThe Voting Rights Act was passed in 1965, and as of 2008 it covered nine states in their entirety \u2014 most of them in the Deep South \u2014 along with counties and townships in five other states. Ohio was never under the act\u2019s jurisdiction, though Fudge\u2019s comments at the hearing indicate she believes it should be covered as well.\n\nMore than one witness who spoke to her subcommittee on Thursday at the hearing echoed Fudge\u2019s opinion that problematic issues of voter discrimination exist not just in the Deep South.\n\nDemocrats and voting rights advocates say that since the 2013 Holder decision, states with Republican supermajorities in government \u2014 controlling the governorship and both chambers of the state legislature \u2014 have become increasingly aggressive in passing laws that make it harder to vote, especially for those who are poor or members of a racial minority.\n\n\u201cModern-day voter suppression efforts are proliferating,\u201d said Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.", "description": "Amid what experts are calling a surge in voter suppression measures, Democrats are sending a clear signal they want to restore portions of the Voting Rights Act that were removed by the Supreme Court in 2013, as well as expand the law\u2019s reach.", "authors": ["Jon Ward", "Senior Political Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/AKCVoau4npPlN1i8NXRYAA--~B/aD0zMzMzO3c9NTAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/54d237d0-f1ad-11e9-b7ef-364afbbfbf01", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
