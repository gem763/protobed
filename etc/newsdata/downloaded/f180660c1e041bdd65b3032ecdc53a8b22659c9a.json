The WFE proposed that the FCA develop proper consumer protection instead.\n\nRecommendations to build proper regulations\n\nThe WFE accompanied its response with an array of recommendations such as the potential implementation of standards for the aforementioned products, consideration of underlying market structures, and a review of the ban \u2014 if it is introduced \u2014 to ensure consumer choice and access, among others.\n\nWFE CEO Nandini Sukumar urged authorities to build relevant regulations to enable the market to further develop, stating:\n\n\u201cWhile crypto asset products have real potential, the market has suffered from unregulated providers distributing inappropriate products. Market infrastructures that adhere to strict regulatory requirements, embed consumer protection as part of their mandate and understand that integrity is fundamental to well-functioning markets, are best placed to deliver these products and support the developing marketplace.\u201d\n\nWFE comprises of the world\u2019s major stock exchanges, including Nasdaq, CME Group, Korea Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Boerse.\n\nThe FCA\u2019s stance toward cryptocurrencies\n\nAlthough the FCA is still considering the restriction of crypto derivatives for retail investors, it recently concluded that major cryptocurrencies are \u201cexchange tokens,\u201d which are \u201cusually decentralized and primarily used as a means of exchange.\u201d The regulator emphasized that such digital currencies do not fall under the regulatory scope of the FCA and are outside its regulatory purview.\n\nIn late September, U.K.-based regulated public exchange Coinshares claimed the FCA had not provided enough evidence to justify a proposed ban on cryptocurrency exchange-traded notes, warning its customers that they will no longer be able to trade such products if the ban is approved.", "description": "The WFE, a global trade association of publicly-regulated exchanges, has appealed to the U.K.\u2019s FCA not to restrict crypto derivatives for retail investors", "authors": ["Ana Alexandre"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvMzY1ZjVhY2FiMzlhZTZjYzRjNWFmOTcwMDc3YTc5YzcuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
