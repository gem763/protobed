Nazi sympathisers in Poland were filmed celebrating Hitler\u2019s birthday by burning a huge wooden swastika.\n\nLast week, a gunman killed two people in Halle, Germany, near a synagogue. And even in countries that saw the Third Reich\u2019s atrocities, the alt-right is winning fans.\n\nIt is short for alternative right \u2013 a twist on far-right white nationalism that tries to present the sick ideology as a \u00adrespectable intellectual movement.\n\nProf Feldman said: \u201cIn the Cold War there was anti-fascist consensus. The common enemy was Russia. But after the 9/11 attack there was a lot of talk in the media about Islam and the narrative began to change.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n(Image: NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cAnti-Muslim prejudice grew. After events like the Rotherham scandal, the far-right built an ideology that all Muslims were rapists and \u00adpaedophiles. This enabled it to have a social media voice.\u201d\n\nMichael Colborne, a journalist and far-right expert in the Balkans, says the fall of communism fuelled \u00adextremism in places such as Bulgaria.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt was a chance for nation-building in countries where nationalism had been suppressed. That brought historical revisionism and anti-communism that downplayed the dangers of fascism.\u201d\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\n(Image: ATV-Studio Halle/AFP via Getty I)\n\nSix men were held after the vile scenes on the terraces in Bulgaria.\n\nTheir Nazi salutes were a shock to those who believed the type of hooliganism seen here decades ago was dead.\n\nYet fascist groups like Combat 18 here, Scandinavia\u2019s Nordic Resistance, Golden Dawn in Greece and Germany\u2019s Pegida have long-running links with football thuggery.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nPavel Klymenko, of Football Against Racism in Europe, said many far-right yobs model \u00adthemselves on old British groups that were the forerunners of the EDL \u2013 set up by convicted thug Tommy Robinson.\n\nHe said: \u201cFans are still mainly white men. The culture seen in the UK decades ago seems to be recurring. The far-right is \u00adbecoming trendy and this is \u00adreflected in football.\u201d", "description": "The shocking behaviour of Bulgaria football fans is just a glimpse in to a terrifying political movement gripping Europe", "authors": ["Grace Macaskill", "Image", "Afp Getty Images", "Michael Zemanek Bpi Rex", "Nurphoto Via Getty Images", "Getty Images", "Atv-Studio Halle Afp Via Getty I"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20654036.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_ITALY-POLITICS-ELECTION-VOTE-election-italy-politics.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
