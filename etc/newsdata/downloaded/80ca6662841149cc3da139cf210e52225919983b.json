Xinjiang province, in particular, is home to the country\u2019s Uyghur Muslim minority, a populace that has been the subject of persecution and heightened surveillance in recent years.\n\n\u201cThis group (or groups) has a long history and series of creating custom tools which implies they are persistent, and well-resourced,\u201d Unit 42\u2019s Alex Hinchliffe told TNW. \u201cFor example, the creation and use of a custom Android malware [\u2026] may indicate their targets require unique attention based on prevalent operating systems used or that they need that capability generally. This group(s) is patient in what they work toward.\u201d\n\nPKPLUG modus operandi\n\nUnit 42\u2019s report combines its own research with those published by other cybersecurity firms such as Blue Coat Labs and Arbor Networks to piece together a timeline of PKPLUG\u2019s malware-based tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPS).\n\nThe earliest confirmed PKPLUG attack is said to have occurred in November 2013, when they were found to target Mongolian individuals with PlugX malware. Three years later, they were caught using Poison Ivy malware against Myanmar and other Asian countries.\n\nThat same year, Unit 42 reported attacks via spear phishing emails used to download a ZIP filed hosted on Google Drive that loaded a Trojan to compromise victim devices.\n\nIn early 2018, the firm discovered a new malware family \u2014 called HenBox \u2014 that masqueraded as a legitimate Android app to primarily target the Uyghurs and compromise Xiaomi devices with a goal to harvest outgoing phone calls to China and access the phone\u2019s microphone and camera.\n\nInterestingly, the investigation gave away one of PKPLUG\u2019s other tricks to lure unsuspecting users: make the espionage app available on a third-party Android app store, and even pose as a VPN app named DroidVPN to get them to download it.\n\nCredit: Unit 42 / Palo Alto Networks The PKPLUG attack timeline\n\nVPN apps are how citizens in China get around the Great Firewall, and the fact that they were employed as an attack vector is indicative of cybercriminals\u2019 tendency of increasingly banking on users\u2019 trust in security-related apps to install malware.\n\nFast forward to February 2019, Unit 42 uncovered the group\u2019s use of a Windows backdoor known as Farseer, which leveraged sideloaded libraries to install malicious payloads \u2014 a common technique that connects their disparate campaigns.\n\nPKPLUG\u2019s reuse of domain names and IP addresses also helped strengthen the overlaps between the different cyber offensives, the research noted.\n\nThe need for endpoint security\n\nDetails of PKPLUG\u2019s elaborate cyber espionage attacks come merely days after Check Point Research disclosed a similar data-stealing campaign directed at Southeast Asia undertaken by a Chinese hacking group called Rancor.\n\nAsked if these state-sponsored actors could be working in tandem to enable targeted operations on a large-scale, Hinchliffe told TNW: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen nation-states, like Russia, hire various groups to lead out attacks, and while it\u2019s possible in this scenario, we don\u2019t have enough data at this time to make that assumption.\u201d\n\nIn addition to avoiding downloading apps from third-party Android stores, Hinchliffe recommends businesses secure their network endpoints, and evaluate their BYOD (short for \u201cbring your own device\u201d) policies by limiting device access to the network.\n\nAlthough this latest research offers a peek into PKPLUG\u2019s activities, it\u2019s far from a conclusive picture.\n\n\u201cPresumably, there are more victims that were targeted, more tools used, and more infrastructure. The more organizations that shine a light on threats like PKPLUG moving forward, the more complete our picture can become,\u201d Hinchliffe said.\n\nRead next: Study: Ocean ecosystems take 2 million years to recover after mass extinction", "description": "PKPLUG, a previously undocumented threat actor of Chinese origin, is behind at least six different cyber espionage campaigns targeting Southeast Asia since 2013.", "authors": ["Ravie Lakshmanan"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F09%2Fchina-malware-hed.jpg&signature=66fad4ff34421451b021c908c40590d1", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
