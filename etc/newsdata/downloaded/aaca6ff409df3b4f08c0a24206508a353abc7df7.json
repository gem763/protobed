It found UK firms were less prepared for no deal than in March, while Brexit uncertainty was dragging on demand.\n\nDespite this, Ms Fairbairn said few CBI members viewed the prospect of a Labour government following a potential October election as much better than no deal, citing concerns over Jeremy Corbyn's plans to renationalise industries and hand company shares to workers.\n\n\"I think this is a choice no business wants to have to make. In terms of the policies of a Corbyn government, some of them are deeply damaging.\"\n\nSome politicians have argued that warnings about the potential damage of a no-deal Brexit have been exaggerated.\n\nBefore becoming Leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg said in July that quitting the EU without a deal could result in an \u00a380bn boost for the economy.\n\nHe also dismissed as \"pure silliness\" Treasury forecasts warning of a \u00a390bn hit to the UK - projections thst former chancellor Philip Hammond later described as \"terrifying\".", "description": "However, the CBI says businesses still must keep stockpiling for a potential no-deal Brexit.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/778F/production/_107170603_gettyimages-1063476572.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
