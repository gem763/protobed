Gordon Sondland announced Friday that he will testify before House committees next week despite being ordered by the Trump administration on Tuesday not to appear for the scheduled depositions, a prohibition House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D., Calif.) called an act of \u201cobstruction of a coequal branch of government.\u201d\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding the State Department\u2019s current direction not to testify, Ambassador Sondland will honor the Committees\u2019 subpoena, and he looks forward to testifying on Thursday,\u201d a statement released Friday reads. \u201cAmbassador Sondland has at all times acted with integrity and in the interests of the United States. He has no agenda apart from answering the Committees\u2019 questions fully and truthfully.\u201d\n\nSondland is of interest to the House impeachment inquiry due to his dealings with former special representative to Ukraine, Kurt Volker. Text messages between Volker and Sonland suggest that State Department officials were working at the behest of the White House to coordinate investigations into Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings.\n\nThe House had scheduled Sondland to testify this past Tuesday, but the State Department decided to block the move, before a letter from the Trump administration told the House it won\u2019t cooperate with the \u201cunconstitutional\u201d impeachment inquiry.\n\nIn the statement, Sondland also stated that he is prohibited \u201cfrom producing documents concerning his official responsibilities.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmbassador Sondland does not control the disposition of his documents. By federal law and regulation, the State Department has sole authority to produce such documents, and he hopes the materials will be shared with the Committees in advance of his Thursday testimony,\u201d the statement read.\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "U.S. ambassador to the E.U.
