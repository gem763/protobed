Bill Weld, who announced his White House bid in April, as well as from former Rep. Joe Walsh, who announced his candidacy in August.\n\nThe state Republican parties in South Carolina, Kansas, Nevada and Arizona could nix their primaries and caucuses.\n\nState political parties set their own rules for primaries and caucuses, and one consideration when an incumbent president is seeking re-election is the costs that the state parties must bear to put on an intra-party contest when the likely outcome appears relatively clear.\n\nArizona primary: Republican Party prepares to scrap 2020 presidential preference election in Arizona\n\nLeaders in South Carolina and Nevada will meet Saturday to reach a decision, while the Arizona GOP Executive Committee will discuss the issue at a Sept. 14 meeting.\n\nKansas Republicans are also considering the option, according to Politico.\n\nIt is not an unusual move for state parties to forego primary contests when a strong incumbent is running for re-election as president.\n\nFor example, the South Carolina and Arizona Republican parties did not hold primaries in 1984 and 2004 when Ronald Regan and George W. Bush, respectively, were seeking re-election, according to the Associated Press.\n\nIn 2012, Democrats canceled 10 presidential preference contests, according to the New York Times.\n\n\u201cThese are decisions made entirely by state parties and there are volumes of historical precedents to support them. Nevertheless, President Trump will dominate and prevail in whatever contest is placed before him,\u201d Trump campaign communication director Tim Murtaugh said in a statement provided to USA TODAY of the possibility that the intra-GOP contests in the four states could be canceled.\n\n'What are we going to do Mike?': Trump's victory posed problems for Pence and his wife, new book says\n\nDrew McKissick, chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party, also told the Times: \u201cThere is strong precedent on the part of both parties to not hold a primary when they control the White House.\u201d\n\nIn Arizona, the effort has been afoot since at least April, when state party chair Kelli Ward began circulating a GOP executive committee resolution to GOP state lawmakers to support opting out of the state's presidential preference election.\n\nThat resolution, obtained in May by The Arizona Republic, acknowledges that the party has the option of not holding a presidential preference election.\n\n\"Arizona Republicans are fired up to re-elect President Trump to a second term and will continue to work together to keep America \u2014 and Arizona \u2014 great,\" Ward said in a statement issued Friday.\n\nGOP fundraising: Trump calls out small 2020 GOP primary field including Joe Walsh, Bill Weld and potential challenger Mark Sanford\n\nThe ABC News affiliate in Wichita, Kansas, reported that the Kansas Republican Party will not organize a caucus for the 2020 primary season, and that the decision follows a standard that goes back to President Abraham Lincoln's re-election.\n\n\u201cEvery time an elected incumbent Republican has run for re-election, except in 1912, the Kansas GOP state convention adopted a resolution instructing all delegates to vote for the elected incumbent,\u201d the TV station reported, adding that \"The Kansas GOP estimates organizing a caucus would cost the party $250,000.\"\n\nIn Nevada, a spokesman on Friday confirmed the party\u2019s central committee plans to vote this weekend on a rule change that would short-circuit a pair of long-shot campaigns for the Silver State\u2019s Republican caucus delegates.\n\nNevada's primary: Nevada GOP could vote to cancel upcoming caucus, smoothing Trump's path to renomination\n\nThe RNC has already thrown its support behind Trump, signing a pledge in January to give \u201cundivided support\u201d before he\u2019s the party\u2019s official nominee.\n\n\"The members just wanted to underscore, underline, highlight that we are here to reelect President Trump and Republicans up and down the ballot,\" the RNC's national press secretary, Cassie Smedile, said at the time.", "description": "The move would be a\u00a0show of\u00a0support for Trump as a few GOP\u00a0challengers\u00a0have stepped forward to contest the party's\u00a0presidential nomination.", "authors": ["Savannah Behrmann", "John Fritze", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/zFMncRfYcuDeL.YaVdk4tg--~B/aD0zNDU2O3c9NTE4NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/ed0ccb52d000fc7bf3debe5cb1cc6ee9", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
