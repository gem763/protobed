James Brickwood\n\nAs new starts vanish, there will be significant employment impacts in the construction sector which could feed back into the broader economy through weaker spending. It\u2019s the RBA\u2019s hope that lower interest rates will stimulate the broader economy and absorb this weakness. We are skeptical that this will work.\n\nIn Australia, interest rates have stimulated mainly through increased house prices, driving wealth effects and construction activity.\n\nFirstly, we are hitting the lower bound of policy effectiveness as banks are simply unable to lower their funding costs enough to pass on all the rate cuts. Secondly, low rates need to be viewed in the context of the record high household debt that has been built up to support high house prices.\n\nThose with debt, particularly those that have found themselves with negative equity, will be more inclined to pay it down in times of uncertainty while those with assets may be cautious in spending their capital given the low rates of return available.\n\nGiven the strong rebound in cyclical stocks so far, we suggest caution owning them going forward. The housing construction stocks like CSR, Boral and Brickworks are moving into shorting territory given the likely pressure on earnings.\n\nSome of these have significant commodity exposures like CSR to aluminium and Brickworks to coal, which also look weak. For a building stock it\u2019s better to look further afield. We like James Hardie which has good exposure to improving trends in US housing, a stronger structural growth story through market penetration and trades at multiples not too dissimilar to the domestic builders.\n\nRead Sean Fenton's full thoughts on why the RBA is cutting rates here.", "description": "Australian shares were hit for a second day running today, falling 2.2 per cent, with the major banks wiping $11.5 billion from the boards alone.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.9934%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_1%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/919401d1b0071ef596f30a4e48e0794792959f75", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
