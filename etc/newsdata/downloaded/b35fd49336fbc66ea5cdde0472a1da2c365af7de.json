I went to see a doctor for an opinion in the hopes of any sort of answer.\n\n\"I have seen more than ten doctors over the years who would just address my symptoms. I have been misdiagnosed with borderline diabetes, generalised anxiety disorder, depression and PCOS.\n\n(Image: MDWfeatures / Rebecca Churan)\n\n\"I told this doctor that my face was changing, and I was getting uglier, and that I didn't understand why I was gaining weight since I was barely eating.\n\n\"She issued me a blood test and then called me back in and told me I had a pituitary tumour based on the results of that test.\n\nNormal range for the growth hormone is between 97 and 297, and I was at a whopping 1015 level - which is high even for a teenager with gigantism.\n\n\"There really is no information other than extreme cases online. There's barely any awareness or tools to help people recognise the signs, so many cases are diagnosed as hormonal disorders.\n\n\"I saw the scariest photos of Andre the giant and others who had not been treated early on during the process. I was mortified, scared, and hopeless.\n\n(Image: MDWfeatures / Rebecca Churan)\n\n\"The tumour caused the extreme tiredness, my anxiety, weight gain, the growth of my hands, feet, nose and chin. I had this tumour for over 15 years based on the photos I've looked back over, but I just thought it was the way I was ageing at the time.\n\n\"I questioned my growth a few years ago when my feet shot up half a size, but I had gained weight too and I thought it must have been caused by water retention or my borderline diabetes diagnosis.\n\n\"I went to Alberta and an endocrinologist, Doctor Nisha Haroon, got me in a for a CT scan that same day and that was when we saw my tumour.\n\n\"I was petrified because I had a tumour in my brain which they needed to remove, but if I didn't have surgery then I would continue to become disfigured! Surgery was April 6 by Doctor Cusimano and the tumour was taken out through my nasal cavity.\"\n\n(Image: MDWfeatures / Rebecca Churan)\n\nSince the surgery, Rebecca has noticed that many of her features have downsized, much to her relief as she had become so upset by her changing appearance.\n\nRebecca hopes to encourage others with an unexplainable problem to stay positive and push for answers.\n\n\"People aren't aware of pituitary tumours, which is crazy to me because the pituitary gland is the master controller of all your glands and endocrine system.\n\n\"Being rare is a very difficult thing, especially when many doctors don't know how to treat you. You must stay positive and find hope in any way you can while fighting. I want people to understand that a simple blood test can often diagnose a pituitary tumour.\n\n\"Don't just accept any diagnosis without digging deeper and asking if something else could be causing it. Never judge a book by its cover because those covers can be redrawn, just like more pages can be added to a story.\"", "description": "Rebecca Churan, 29, from Ontario, Canada, searched for answers for years after she suffered unexplained growth that caused her feet to grow by a size and a half", "authors": ["Alyce Collins", "Image", "Mdwfeatures", "Rebecca Churan"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20757269.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Chin-Taking-Over-My-Face.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
