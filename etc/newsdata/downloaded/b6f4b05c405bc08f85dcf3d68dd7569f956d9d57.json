I just think people should take risks.\u201d\n\nStreet-style photographer Liisa Jokinen specializes in capturing fearless acts of self-presentation. The people featured on her two platforms, the 13-year-old Helsinki-based website Hel Looks and the newer NYC-Looks, are the kind of fashion natives who put deep thought into everything they wear, and who can theorize about clothes as creatively as they style them.\n\nThis season, Jokinen will be covering New York Fashion Week for the Cut. She started off with two events for Telfar, the self-described \u201cblack-owned, non-gendered fashion project\u201d that\u2019s been doing its own thing since 2004. Liberian-American designer Telfar Clemens has had a big couple of years \u2014 a CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund award, a hit bag \u2014 and this season he\u2019s showing in Paris. Still, the brand has a big presence in New York this week, including a party with Opening Ceremony on Thursday night and a party that doubles as a screening of an experimental film on Friday. Scroll on for some of the best street style from both events.\n\nTariq White, Musician, 23\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing a Gianfranco Ferre suit with Vivienne Westwood glasses and a Chanel bag. I wanted to look as luxurious as possible.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @d3ad6oy\n\nJahfari Webb, Artist, 21\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing Natural Born Fillers by Nigel McKenzie. My style is inspired by my mom and sister. I try to accentuate my figure with everything I wear. I love my body, so I want to show it off as much as I can.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @itsjoeydash\n\nThe Bloom Twins, 23, Musicians\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cOur skirts are from Xiao Li, the brown shirt is from Mihara Yasuhiro, the black jumper is from Tommy Hilfiger, and our shoes are Dr Martens. Our music inspires our style. The way our music sounds is the way fashion sounds.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @bloomtwins\n\nAileen Kim, 21, Art Student\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing a G.vG.v jacket with vintage shorts that I thrifted in Los Angeles, paired with Marni loafer platforms. I don\u2019t know if you can tell but I love patterns. I dress subconsciously and just gravitate towards what I like. Most of the time I end up looking like a quirky grandma of a doll, which mirrors my personality pretty accurately.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @alien.kimchii\n\nGerlan Marcel, 43, Print and Graphic Designer\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI got my outfit a couple of weeks ago in London. I went to see [the psychedelic-dub ensemble] African Head Charge and I was so excited to buy merchandise at the show. But they didn\u2019t have anything with their name on it \u2014 just a guy selling this. It was the best purchase during my 1.5 months in London. My style philosophy is \u2018everything goes with anything,\u2019 like [stylist] Lori Goldstein says. And don\u2019t leave anything unprinted.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @gerlanjeans\n\nShavone Charles, 28, Artist and Former Global Head of Music & Youth Culture Communications at Instagram\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing Perfect Number pants and apron shorts, a Melody Ehsani choker, personal gold chains, and dyed braids and brows, with patent Dr. Martens shoes. Structure, movement, and comfort are the most important part of my style today. I\u2019m very inspired by androgynous, avant-garde, tactical pieces that have a contemporary and femme spin. I see personal style as self-expression and the first message we communicate when we step outside to face the world. We are our own heroes in costume.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @shavonec\n\nAnastasia Fox, 22, Production Assistant\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cMy entire look is thrifted and inspired by Seinfeld and \u2018the shirt.\u2019 I wanted to look like a pirate. My style philosophy is \u2018feel bad, look better\u2019 because as long as you look good, nobody has to know that you don\u2019t feel good.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @anamaniax\n\nVanessa Barros Andrade, 29, DJ\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing Melitta Baumeister, a Metallica flag as a head wrap, and Comme de Gar\u00e7ons. I wanted to give off a fortune teller/clown look. Costumes inspire my style. My style philosophy is never to be afraid of the unknown. I\u2019m into foreshadowing.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @deviantarthaute\n\nFarida Alatif, 31, Photographer and Producer\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI wear vintage most of the time because I appreciate the classic cut, quality, and materials. Today I wanted to give off more Telfar vibes. I appreciate their retro aesthetics and outlines. Timelessness inspires my style. I dress for comfort, my body type, and classic cuts. I\u2019m from London and it is very London and New York to wear a lot of black. My style philosophy: Do you.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @faridaalatif\n\nAbdu Ali, 28, Musician\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing a vintage abstract tunic, vintage silk pants, Adidas, and a wooden infinity necklace. I wanted to look classic and futuristic but comfy. I\u2019m inspired by the fantastic but nostalgic energy that emanates from my hometown, Baltimore. My style philosophy is always wear something that is 100 percent you but just make sure your comfort comes first.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @abdu__ali\n\nFlame Faire, 19, Artist\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing a vintage Burberry shirt, a Gucci bag, vintage shoes and jacket. The New York weather was extremely gray today so I went for a darker look. It was all put together in a few minutes. My inspiration comes from anything and everything. It can be an old man on the subway, an art piece, even nature. My style is mostly a reflection of how I see the world. I would describe it authentic, moody, and comfortable.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @flameflaire\n\nMaiya Carmichael, 24, Fashion Assistant at Essence Magazine\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing a thrifted Rafaella blazer, a modified Rag & Bone button-down, GG\u2019s Social Pants, heels by Steve Madden, GG\u2019s Social Ear Cuff, a Fossil watch, and a Carolee earring. I chose this look today because I love pattern-mixing. I\u2019m inspired by the people and places around me. I like to take things from different experiences and create my own look. If the piece doesn\u2019t evoke emotion, don\u2019t wear it.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @_mcqn\n\nMichael Rank Jr., 21, Stylist\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing Acne Studios glasses, a Mister Freedom denim shirt, a Staatsballett T-shirt, Dries Van Noten jeans, G.H. Bass & Co. hand-painted loafers, and heirloom jewelry. Western films and the Gold Rush era inspire my style. My style philosophy is to wear what makes you feel strong.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @michaelrankjr\n\nMarisa Baklayan, 21, Stylist\n\nPhoto: Liisa Jokinen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing a vintage dress, MM6 shoes, a Telfar bag, Vivienne Westwood earrings, and Dalmata rings and bracelets.\u201d\n\nInstagram: @icloudchic", "description": "Liisa Jokinen shoots New Yorkers with fearless personal style at her site NYC-Looks.
