(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Some have regrets. A few can\u2019t talk about it. Others would do it all again.\n\nBut the Republicans who carried out President Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment in 1998 are unanimous in urging caution and restraint as Congress embarks on yet another impeachment struggle, this time over accusations that President Donald Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden, and his son.\n\nThe impeachment veterans of two decades ago were thrust into a seismic political event that was sober and circus-like at the same time. It opened a new, angry chapter of American politics that strained Washington institutions that were stronger then than now. They urge a pause in the tribalism of the Trump era.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a race to judgment, people apparently have already made up their minds, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot of openness about this. And I think there should be,\u201d said former Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., one of 14 House impeachment \u201cmanagers\u201d who presented the case against Clinton to the Senate.\n\n\u201cPeople ought to wait before they make judgment on whether or not there\u2019s even an impeachable offense out here to be considered until all the facts are on the table,\u201d He added. \u201cThat\u2019s not been the case for a number of congressmen on both sides of the aisle that I can see.\u201d\n\nThe managers during Clinton\u2019s impeachment were all solidly conservative white men. Most are out of politics. A few are judges. Some do some lobbying, while others have simply retired. The chairman, Henry Hyde of Illinois, died in 2007.\n\nThe best-known is Lindsey Graham, a former Air Force prosecutor who was among those most aggressively gunning for Clinton. In 1999, speaking from the well of the Senate, the South Carolina congressman made the case: \u201cImpeachment is not about punishment. Impeachment is about cleansing the office. Impeachment is about restoring honor and integrity to the office.\u201d\n\nNow a senator, Graham seems to be part of the defense rather than the prosecution\n\n\u201cI have zero problems with this phone call\u201d with Zelenskiy, Graham said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace The Nation.\u201d\n\nThe only Clinton prosecutor remaining in the House is Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, a 41-year veteran of Congress who is retiring at the end of next year. He insists charges that Trump abused his office are nowhere near being proven.\n\nIn 1998, independent counsel Ken Starr offered up two vanloads of testimony and evidence, effectively dropping the full case for impeachment in Congress\u2019s lap.\n\n\u201cI think that Starr\u2019s report, which said that the president may have committed impeachable offenses, obligated the Judiciary Committee and the House of Representatives to conduct an inquiry to see if that was the case,\u201d Sensenbrenner said in an interview. Congress had removed judges in comparable perjury cases, he said.\n\nHistory is calling again, this time with accusations that Trump abused his power to help his political fortunes.\n\nSensenbrenner in July aggressively questioned special counsel Robert Mueller, whose report didn\u2019t find criminal wrongdoing by the president in Russia\u2019s 2016 election interference but spelled out 10 instances in which Trump may have obstructed the probe. Mueller didn\u2019t indict Trump, citing Justice Department guidelines against charging a sitting president. Nor did he say whether impeachment could be a remedy.\n\n\u201cYou didn't use the words \u2018impeachable conduct\u2019 like Starr did,\u201d Sensenbrenner told Mueller. \u201cEven the president is innocent until proven guilty.\u201d Mueller said his mandate didn\u2019t include offering opinions on other remedies like impeachment.\n\nMcCollum, who left Congress to lose a 2000 Senate campaign but staged a political comeback as Florida's attorney general, cautions that lots of facts, testimony and evidence have yet to surface. The investigation into Trump\u2019s festering scandal is in its opening stages.\n\n\u201cThere are really a lot more questions than there are answers,\u201d McCollum said, adding that so far he sees \u201cjust a really weak case.\u201d\n\nDemocrats say they already have their \u201csmoking gun,\u201d having obtained the transcript of Trump\u2019s call with Zelenskiy, and accuse Republicans of downplaying a clear-cut abuse of presidential power.\n\nFormer Indiana Rep. Lee Hamilton, a Democrat who served in the House from 1965 to 1999 during both the Watergate scandal that brought down President Richard Nixon and the impeachment of Clinton, has said he\u2019d vote to both indict and convict Trump if he were in Congress. Hamilton said he\u2019s \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d that more Republicans have not publicly favored impeachment proceedings against Trump or even spoken out against his actions with Russia and Ukraine.", "description": "The impeachment veterans of two decades ago were thrust into a seismic political event that was sober and circus-like at the same time.  \u201cPeople ought to wait before they make judgment on whether or not there\u2019s even an impeachable offense out here to be considered until all the facts are on the table", "authors": ["Andrew Taylor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cNwi4pplU6y24EtlKUGhaw--~B/aD0zMjY1O3c9NDg5NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/c1788f43691de1fcdd574f315ccd80b4"}
