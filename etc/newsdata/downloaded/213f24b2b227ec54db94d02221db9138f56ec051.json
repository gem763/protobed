A total of 176 episodes of severe hail were reported in those states plus South Dakota, Montana and Wyoming.\n\nIn August, a severe storm with baseball-sized hail and 70-mph winds killed between 11,000 and 13,000 waterfowl at a Montana marshland in Yellowstone County. Dead and injured pelicans, cormorants, geese and ducks were scattered around the Big Lake Wildlife Management Area north of Billings, according to state park officials.\n\n\u201cWe walked up and saw dead birds strewn across the shoreline, and injured birds with broken wings,\u201d said Justin Paugh, wildlife biologist for Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks.\n\n\u201cOnce we saw divots in mud on the bank of the lake like golf balls, it came together pretty quick that these were hail fatalities. I\u2019ve never experienced anything of that magnitude,\u201d Paugh said.\n\nStates east of the Rocky Mountains are more subject to severe hail-producing weather because of mountain-influenced wind patterns and a change in humidity when wet air from the Gulf of Mexico hits the arid prairie landscape, according to a study by the Fort Collins-based Colorado Climate Center and published Aug. 29 in the Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology.\n\nFavorable conditions\n\n\u201cWarm, moist conditions are favorable for severe weather,\u201d said Russ Schumacher, head of the climate center. \u201cThere\u2019s more instability in the atmosphere, and storms that form are even stronger and capable of producing really big hail.\u201d\n\nThe amount of hail-caused property damage in the United States has been increasing, insurance groups say. In the past three years, the number of insurance claims for hail damage spiked by 19 percent, according to the Illinois-based National Insurance Crime Bureau.\n\nIn 2016, insurance policyholders in the state of Texas reported 378,652 claims, with the most damage to cars and personal property in San Antonio, where 68,778 claims measuring $1.4 billion in losses were filed.\n\nAlthough state totals are not available for this year, damage in Collins County, Texas, alone is expected to be more than $300 million, NOAA records indicate.\n\nColorado has a smaller population than Texas, but is situated next to the Rockies, where weather patterns can be severe. The state has seen an increase in severe hail weather events starting in 2016, Schumacher said.\n\nIn Colorado Springs alone, heavy hailstorms in 2016 and 2018 added up to 66,467 claims, totaling almost $522 million, the insurance bureau reported.\n\nIn August 2018, a quick-moving storm pelted baseball-sized hailstones onto the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo in Colorado Springs. Fourteen people were injured and at least three zoo animals killed by the giant hailstones.\n\nAt nearby Fort Carson, a U.S. Army base, hailstones destroyed every roof on the base and smashed cars in the parking lots, causing almost $60 million in damage, Brandy Gill, chief of media relations, remembered.\n\n\u201cSome of the cars looked as though they had been in a rollover wreck,\u201d Gill said. \u201cBack windows, side windows, moon and sun-roofs \u2014 those were gone. The housing on the installation had holes in the sides of the buildings and windows in buildings were broken,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe storm only lasted 15 minutes, but with those sized hailstones that\u2019s a lot of damage.\u201d\n\n16 inches of hail\n\nIn early September, a Colorado thunderstorm dropped 16 inches of small pea-sized hail stones on the area near Lake George, killing at least one pronghorn deer fawn, Colorado Parks and Wildlife reported.\n\nSo-called \u201csnow plow\u201d hail, so deep authorities have to break out the shovels, often doesn\u2019t even register on NOAA\u2019s severe storm reports, but it can cause damage, the climate center\u2019s Schumacher said.\n\nThere is no official count of wildlife killed in hailstorms, unless storms happen on state park land, Paugh said. \u201cWe sometimes get reports of birds like pheasants or antelope fawns, but we don\u2019t really track the deaths,\u201d he said.\n\nThe largest recorded hailstone in U.S. history fell from the sky in July 2010, in Vivian, S.D.\n\nThe megastone, now displayed in a freezer at the National Center of Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., measured 8 inches in diameter and weighed 1.94 pounds.\n\nTo calculate the increase in hailstorms, climate center scientists are trying to capture the big picture of hail events in the Rocky Mountain corridor.\n\n\u201cObviously, a farmer can\u2019t move his field, but if we can better understand how hail develops, people can move their cars or take other action to be safe,\u201d said Sam Childs, a doctoral candidate at Colorado State University and co-author of the new study.\n\nOne challenge has been that hail is measured by the damage leaves in its wake \u2014 to human dwellings, cars and crops \u2014 which does not capture the all hail activity.\n\n\u201cHail is only reported where people live or on major thoroughfares,\u201d Childs said.\n\nPredicting tricky\n\nTracking and predicting hail is notoriously tricky for weather scientists.\n\nHail falls randomly and erratically when spiraling supercell thunderstorms up to 3 miles tall create warm updrafts that blow drops of rain up into below-freezing storm clouds.\n\nHailstones freeze and refreeze, gaining size until they are finally heavy enough to fall through the wind currents to the ground.\n\nHailstorms can ruin one farmer\u2019s crop and leave a neighboring farm unscathed.\n\nA June 2018 a fierce storm in Niwot, Colo., flattened 11 acres of vegetables and 7 acres of heritage wheat at Aspen Moon Farms in a half-hour, owners Erin and Jason Griffith said in an online fundraiser.\n\nCalling the storm a \u201cdevastating blow\u201d and a \u201creal tragedy,\u201d friends raised money to repay the Griffiths\u2019 end-of-season farm loans \u2014 \u201cloans that would have been paid with the crops that the hail destroyed,\u201d friend Daniel Hindes said.\n\nFarmers can recover some of their crop losses through the non-insured disaster assistance program offered by the United States Department of Agriculture\u2019s Farm Service Agency, USDA\u2019s Brandon Terrazas, Denver-area district director of the farm agency Other crop-hail insurance coverage is sold privately and backed by the USDA\u2019s Risk Management Agency.\n\n\u201cWe see hail claims more with fruit and vegetable growers than with grain farmers, who are eligible for privately administered crop insurance,\u201d Terrazas said. \u201cOur adjusters look for the signs of hail, holes in the leaves, fruit knocked on the ground. They use weather information to verify the claims.\u201d\n\nBut insurance only covers a part of the lost crop\u2019s initial costs, not the loss from anticipated sales.\n\n\u201cFarmers can recover maybe 50 to 60 percent of their costs. They are never really made whole,\u201d Terrazas said.\n\nHigh- and low-tech tools\n\nScientists and insurance companies are developing new tools, like artificial intelligence and drone surveillance to predict and verify hail damage.\n\nNational Center for Atmospheric Research scientists at the University of Oklahoma have developed over the last three years a machine-learning model to analyze images from storms and match them with actual measurements of temperature, pressure, wind speed and direction to see which storms produce hail and how big the hailstones are.\n\nThe new computer program can\u2019t precisely predict hail yet, but machine-learning scientist John Gagne said in a press release that the new method had \u201ca lot of promise to help forecasters better predict a weather phenomenon capable of causing severe damage.\u201d\n\nFlying drones after thunderstorms can capture hail damage patterns before the hail melts, especially in rural areas, the climate center\u2019s Schumacher said.\n\n\u201cYou get out your ruler and send us the photos,\u201d Schumacher said.\n\nFinally, weather scientists are trying to develop models to project hail damage with different population scenarios, Childs said.\n\n\u201cOn the Great Plains, in general, we can predict increasing trends that make an environment favorable for more hailstorms in the future,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see whether change in climate or change in numbers of people living here will correlate to economic loss and damage.\u201d", "description": "DENVER, Oct. 11 (UPI) \u2014 As hail season ends in the \u201chail alley\u201d states east of the Rocky Mountains, weather scientists say these", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
