Subscribe to the newsletter here .\n\nToday, thanks to your tips, I bring you a scoop: a new app called Threads, now in development at Instagram, designed to promote sharing among close friends. I published it a couple hours ago at The Verge:\n\nFacebook is developing a new messaging app called Threads that is meant to promote constant, intimate sharing between users and their closest friends, The Verge has learned. Threads, which is designed as a companion app to Instagram, invites users to automatically share their location, speed, and battery life with friends, along with more typical text, photo, and video messages using Instagram\u2019s creative tools. The app, which is designed for sharing with your \u201cclose friends\u201d list on Instagram, is now being tested internally at Facebook. Instagram declined to comment. [...] Screenshots reviewed by The Verge show an app that\u2019s designed to promote constant, automatic sharing between users and the people on their \u201cclose friends\u201d list on Instagram. Opt in to automatic sharing, and Threads will regularly update your status, giving your friends a real-time view of information about your location, speed, and more. At the moment, Threads does not display your real-time location \u2014 instead, it might say something like a friend is \u201con the move,\u201d according to sources familiar with the matter.\n\nThe move comes amid Facebook\u2019s larger pivot to privacy and an abandoned effort to build a standalone messaging app for Instagram. Messaging is a core feature of Facebook\u2019s offering, and it\u2019s only natural that the company will keep trying new things to ensure it retains our eyeballs.\n\nOn Twitter, many readers were surprised Facebook would ask users to share their current battery life. These folks must not be Snapchat users: on Snapchat, people love sharing stickers showing their battery life, usually as a kind of braggadocio \u2014 look at me still out here at the club, despite the fact that I\u2019m down to 10 percent battery and Lyft is my only way home!\n\nLocation tracking is more interesting, though at the moment, Threads won\u2019t show anyone your exact location. (You can volunteer that information on Facebook Messenger if you like, though.) Instead, I\u2019m told, it might allow Threads to generate a status that says something like \u201cI\u2019m on the move.\u201d Over time, though, you have to assume that Instagram wants what Snap has \u2014 a real-time map of user locations to enable new social behaviors. (As an aside, I\u2019ve always wondered how Instagram could credibly clone Snap Map; the fact that it\u2019s now remotely possible is a testament to what a good idea Close Friends was.)\n\nWill Threads ever get a public release? Will it win if it does? Josh Constine is skeptical. I am, too, and for this reason: Close Friends, while a good and useful thing, is already showing signs of bloating. This is due in large part to Instagram itself, which regularly \u201csuggests\u201d new friends to add to the list. As a result, my own list has now ballooned to more than three dozen people.\n\nThe whole point of Close Friends is to reduce the cognitive overhead of publicly posting by making you confident that you are sharing to an intimate group \u2014 ideally one whose members you can mostly name. The more people that go on that list, the more mental math you have to do before you post. This was the exact dynamic, incidentally, that led to the creation of the Close Friends list in the first place! (And also spurred the phenomenon of the Finstagram before it.) As the list swells, users may become less willing to share (automatically, no less!) the more intimate types of data Facebook is requesting here \u2014 location, movement speed, and so on.\n\nAnd that\u2019s a tough problem, because messaging apps are only really useful if you can reach a large number of people on them. (Beta testers didn\u2019t want to use Direct even though they could reach their entire Instagram graph there.) Instagram\u2019s incentive here is to get you to have lots and lots of close friends \u2014 but it\u2019s not clear that actual human beings have the same incentives. To lure people into using Threads, Instagram may have to create other incentives that simply aren\u2019t in the app yet. They still might \u2014 that\u2019s what a beta testing period is for, after all.\n\nTweaks\n\nThanks to everyone who wrote in with feedback about our newer, slimmer format around here. I\u2019m still working to find the balance between being comprehensive and being digestible, and hopefully I\u2019m getting a little closer each today.\n\nToday, I offer you a smaller tweak: new section names. Over nearly two years of writing The Interface, I realized that the post-column links really fall into two categories. There are links about governance, whether by states or by platforms; and then there are links about industry: business performance, executive comings and goings, product launches, emergent app behavior, and so on.\n\nAs of today, the sections formerly titled are retiring. In their place you\u2019ll find Governing and Industry.\n\nMore fun tweaks coming soon.\n\nGoverning\n\n\u2b50 Privacy concerns are getting in the way of Facebook sharing with researchers data needed to understand polarization and propaganda, Craig Silverman reports at BuzzFeed. There are very real trade-offs here, and it\u2019s not a big surprise to me that Facebook is being extra cautious about what user data it\u2019s giving away to third parties.\n\nAnother source with knowledge of discussions involving Facebook, Social Science One, and funders said the core frustration is that Facebook has degraded the quality and depth of the data it will offer, while taking much longer than expected to deliver. \u201cI think the only way to feel reasonably confident about this project is if you ignore what\u2019s happened over the past 16 months. If you step back and look where we started and where we are, it\u2019s a pretty big step-down,\u201d said the source, who was also not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nFacebook will not face new restrictions on data collection in Germanywhile a court case is pending.

The practice is thought to extend far beyond the one who was caught, Rob Price reports:\n\nThe findings raise significant questions about Facebook\u2019s due diligence in policing apps that use Instagram data. While the vast majority of the companies identified by Business Insider were not Facebook Marketing Partners, they all openly advertised services that appeared to flout Instagram\u2019s rules, and a single reporter at Business Insider was able to track them down in the space of about a week. Instagram\u2019s historic inaction has also created an uneven playing field for companies that rely on it, with firms willing to break its rules and benefiting from an unfair advantage over those that choose to comply with Instagram\u2019s policies \u2014 even if the firms are putting their employees\u2019 livelihoods at risk in the process.
