Admittedly, the 10 basis point cut to the deposit rate was the least that it could have done and the monthly pace of asset purchases, at \u20ac20 billion beginning on 1st November, was a bit smaller than expected,\" said Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics in an email to Markets Insider.\n\n\"But the key point is that this commitment to more QE is open-ended: it will end shortly before the bank begins raising interest rates.\n\n\"We will get more details in the press conference shortly, but on first glance this looks like a pretty dovish package. It remains doubtful, however, that this will do much to reboot the euro-zone economy let alone achieve the near 2% inflation target,\" he added.\n\nSee More: Donald Trump wants negative interest rates. Rates in Europe just went to a record low, and this is the effect.\n\nThe ECB follows the Federal Reserve and other global central banks in cutting rates to help stimulate the global economy. The Federal Reserve is also expected to lower rates later this month.\n\nMario Draghi, the head of the ECB will be stepping down from the role this fall and is to be replaced by Christine Lagarde, the current head of the IMF.", "description": "The European Central Bank has just announced a sweeping round of stimulus for the eurozone, announcing both a rate cut and return to quantitative easing. ...", "authors": ["Finanzen.Net Gmbh"], "top_image": "https://images.markets.businessinsider.com/image/5d7a34952e22af11ac2dca63-2400/2019-09-12t115732z2lynxnpef8b0v7rtroptp4ecb-policy.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
