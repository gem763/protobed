But the esports machine keep grinding, and yesterday, the previously scheduled American Collegiate Hearthstone Championship was underway. During the tournament\u2019s stream, as team American University was about to lose, they held up a sign saying \u201cFree Hong Kong, Boycott Blizz.\u201d The camera cut away, and the casters pretended like nothing happened.\n\n\u201cI have 15,000 rounds of Hearthstone, I\u2019m done,\u201d 19-year-old college student Casey Chambers, one of the three American University team members on the stream, told me this afternoon on Discord. \u201cThe game we lost last night was my last game of Hearthstone ever.\u201d\n\nAll three on the stream\u2014Casey, 19-year-old Corwin Dark, and another player who wanted to go by their online handle, TJammer\u2014felt the same about Blizzard\u2019s response to Blitzchung.\n\n\u201cWhen we met for practice that day before the tournament, we were all thinking the same thing: that we wanted to do something,\u201d said Dark. \u201cBecause, obviously, we were the first thing on Blizzard's stream after they made the decision. If we did nothing, we were missing a pretty big opportunity.\u201d\n\nCombined with the NBA\u2019s ongoing controversy with China, what started as a ban of one player has sparked a larger backlash against Blizzard. It\u2019s prompted several prominent U.S. senators to (sometimes cynically) weigh in, and opened the door to larger, more probing questions about American and Chinese business relationships. A small group of Blizzard employees reportedly held a small protest at work.\n\nThe trio\u2019s original plan was to bring up the Hong Kong protests when American University won the match, but they had a backup plan, in case things went sour. Which they did.\n\n\u201cWe liked that because it would force Blizzard to either pan away from our camera, or cut our camera off, which they did a little bit during the match,\u201d said Dark.\n\nNone of them have heard from Blizzard about what happened, though at some point, the company will have to talk; on Thursday, they\u2019re supposed to continue forward in the tournament. Either way, they don\u2019t plan to continue playing in the tournament, but they do want Blizzard to make the decision to kick them out and ban them because of their protest.\n\n\u201cUs getting banned is probably the correct decision,\u201d said Chambers. \u201cBut what's so disconcerting about the Blitzchung situation is that it wasn't just a fine, it wasn't just a one week suspension from Grandmasters. It was \u2018You're gone, everything you've earned up until now is gone, and oh by the way the two casters who just happened to be on the stream while his protest took place are also fired.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhen Blizzard penalized Blitzchung, it didn\u2019t just ban him from Hearthstone competition for an entire year, but took away their $3,000 in winnings and fired two casters who, caught surprised by Blitzchung\u2019s decision, attempted to hide under their desks during the protest.\n\n\u201cIt was clearly designed to send a message to somebody,\u201d said Dark.\n\nDark, who claimed to have been following the Hong Kong protests since the start, said he wakes up and checks the Hong Kong subreddit every morning for updates on their progress.\n\n\"We were the first thing on Blizzard's stream after they made the decision. If we did nothing, we were missing a pretty big opportunity.\u201d\n\n\u201cI honestly have been feeling guilty in the weeks and months leading up to this because I haven't been super active,\u201d said Chambers, who said a recent local protest in support of Hong Kong conflicted with a school event. \u201cI think this was the opportunity of a lifetime, and there was no way I was going to let this go past.\u201d\n\nNeither expected much from their protest, let alone for it to blow up. When Dark went to sleep, a single reddit post had roughly 30 upvotes. Nothing. When he woke up a few hours later, a friend messaged, letting him know they were the number one post on Hearthstone\u2019s reddit, a place, like many other Blizzard communities, that\u2019s been utterly thrown into chaos.\n\nTo some degree, the group understands the position Blizzard is in.\n\n\u201cWe understand that Blizzard doesn't want political messaging,\u201d said Chambers.\n\n\u201cI think what I'd like to see from Blizzard, personally, and I think Casey would echo this,\u201d said Dark, \u201cis they need to clearly delineate that their role as a game maker will not include censoring the speech of casters.\u201d\n\nSuch a stance would probably be tough for Blizzard, as it tried to figure out where to draw the line. What political speech is appropriate? How much political speech is too much? Whose speech is OK? There's a reason game companies have notoriously tried to distance themselves from \"politics.\" And notably, part of the criticism against the company\u2019s disproportionate response to this situation has been their ongoing tolerance of homophobia and racism among its players.\n\nOne place to start, the two agreed, was reinstating Blitzchung into competitive Hearthstone.\n\n\u201cIf they really do make amends, genuinely, then I'd love to go back to playing Hearthstone with my friends and enjoying the game,\u201d said Dark. \u201cBut if it's a superficial response? There's a lot of other games out there.\u201d\n\nChambers joked about transitioning to God\u2019s Unchained, a rival card battling game that quickly pounced on the Blitzchung news and offered to match his winnings and a guaranteed spot in the company\u2019s upcoming $500,000 tournament, attaching the hashtag #freegaming.\n\n\u201cMy God's Unchained career starts tomorrow, I guess,\u201d he joked.\n\nSeriously?\n\n\u201cOn the record,\" he said, \u201cyes.
