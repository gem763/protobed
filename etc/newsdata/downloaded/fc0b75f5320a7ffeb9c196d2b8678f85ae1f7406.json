She is said to have worked 20 shifts, earning 300,000 yen each time, which the 27-year-old used on luxuries such as going to restaurants.\n\nHowever, all this side-work must have overwhelmed the sergeant, because on Sept 29, she had left her belt, complete with handcuffs and loaded handgun, in a public restroom in Aioi Station, Aioi City. An hour and a half later, the weapon was found unused by a commuter who turned it in to the station.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the subsequent internal investigation that the officer\u2019s moonlighting came to light. The Local Public Service Act prohibits government employees from taking second jobs\u2026 probably because it can lead to guns getting left around. Also, because in this case the job was quasi-prostitution, her work violated the rule against \u201cdisreputable behavior\u201d by civil servants.\n\nThe Hyogo Prefectural Police took a series of measures including a one-month suspension of the officer in question. However, on the same day as the announcement she is said to have handed over her badge and gun permanently, assuming she remembered where they were at the time.\n\nAlthough this was a salacious scandal of sex and guns, netizens were surprisingly sober in their comments \u2014 for the most part.\n\n\u201cI wonder if she was really paying off some kind of debt.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame police officers aren\u2019t making enough money. Their job is hard, and they should earn a lot.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very serious incident, but really strange too.\u201d\n\n\u201cProper gun handling should be any officer\u2019s \u2018second job.'\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you think she at least tried to say she was deep undercover? I mean, I would have at least tried it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow, living on both sides of the law.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the bright side, this could be the start of a very lucrative adult video career.\u201d\n\nWhile embarrassing for all involved, at least no one was hurt by the abandoned gun.\n\nSources: Kobe Shimbun Next, Kyodo News, Hachima Kiko\n\nRead more stories from SoraNews24.\n\n-- Police officer arrested for repeatedly clogging women\u2019s toilets, watching them get upset about it\n\n-- Kumamoto Police sergeant reprimanded for making officers eat spicy instant noodles\n\n-- Police officer caught smelling coworker\u2019s shoes, Department: \u201csniffing shoes is not illegal\u201d\n\nExternal Link\n\nhttps://soranews24.com/2019/10/21/police-officer-found-to-be-sex-worker-after-leaving-her-gun-in-a-public-restroom/\n\n\u00a9 SoraNews24", "description": "Hyogo Prefectural Police say that an unnamed sergeant voluntarily resigned after it was discovered that she had engaged in the sex industry in a kind of call-girl service known as \u201cdelivery health,\u201d where women are dispatched to a location of the client\u2019s choosing.
