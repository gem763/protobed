I know that Ukrainian officials understood.\"\n\n\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s alleged insistence that the two leaders discuss a prospective investigation into Biden, one of the president\u2019s political opponents, casts his July 25 conversation with Zelenskiy in a new light.\n\nThe only problem with this story: The supposed adviser to the Ukrainian president is no longer an adviser. In fact, Leshchenko has been on the outside since even before the July 25 phone call, meaning he is (at best) just another guy who heard a thing from another guy.\n\nBut it is actually even worse than that, according to Radio Free Europe's Christopher Miller, whose beat includes covering Ukrainian politics. Leshchenko \"said he DID NOT tell ABC insistence for leaders to discuss Biden probe was precondition for call,\" the Radio Free Europe reporter tweeted.\n\nWell, this is awkward.\n\nAxios and ABC have amended their respective stories since to correct the record, but they are still quite flawed as they stand.\n\nThe ABC story now includes an editor\u2019s note that reads:\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this article incorrectly described Serhiy Leshchenko as a current advisor to Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Leshchenko advised Zelenskiy\u2019s transition team following his election in April but has since been distanced by the administration. He is no longer advising Zelenskiy.\n\nAxios tweeted later in a note that has been shared only 373 times, \u201cCORRECTION: We have updated the story to reflect that Serhiy Leschenko is no longer an adviser to the Ukrainian president as ABC News first reported.\u201d\n\nCORRECTION: We have updated the story to reflect that Serhiy Leschenko is no longer an adviser to the Ukrainian president as ABC News first reported. \u2014 Axios (@axios) September 26, 2019\n\nAxios\u2019 report also bears an editor's note that reads, \u201cABC News has corrected its story to reflect that Leshchenko is no longer an adviser to Zelensky. We have updated our story accordingly.\u201d\n\nGood on ABC and Axios for including a correction, but, uh, their stories still cite Leshchenko as the source of the claim that a Biden investigation was a condition of the July 25 call. Are we just going to ignore the part where the former adviser was distanced from the Zelensky administration months before the call even took place? Are we going to continue to pass Leshchenko off as an in-the-know informant and not just another second-hand source of intel? Are we also going to ignore the part where Miller reported that Leshchenko told him explicitly that he had not told ABC that the Biden investigation was a precondition for the phone call?\n\nNobody likes to issue full retractions, I guess.", "description": "If you are leery already of the press\u2019 coverage of allegations that President Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden, botched reports this week from ABC News and Axios will make you only more suspicious.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a214dac/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2277x1196+4+29/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediadc.brightspotcdn.com%2Fc5%2F11%2F8cce5dfb40adbde4df0a20a8edca%2Fap-19268663259831.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
