AAP\n\n\"The government is not considering a carbon price,\" Mr Taylor noted.\n\nBut Mr Calabria said that however difficult it was, a pathway for emissions reduction beyond 2030 had to be set to give confidence for long-term investment in cleaner but also reliable supply.\n\nHe said he wasn't concerned about the role of federal government-owned Snowy Hydro in the sector but said government participation was \"now stretching to another level\" with the underwriting scheme for new on-demand generation.\n\nOrigin is still considering investing in a pumped hydro expansion at its Shoalhaven project south of Sydney and fast-start generation at other sites, but Mr Calabria said the company needed to understand what would come out of the government's underwriting scheme and other factors to go ahead.\n\nThe government is expected to finalise underwriting measures for several gas and pumped hydro projects under its Underwriting New Generation Investments scheme by the year-end. \"All of that just goes into the mix of future supply and demand,\" Mr Calabria said.", "description": "Origin Energy chief executive Frank Calabria has called for clarity around government participation in the energy sector and for a \"calm rest\" from short-term measures.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7516%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_1450%2C$y_121/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/82ca35c2ff7d7c0b450e0dd31cd28a00bddac827", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
