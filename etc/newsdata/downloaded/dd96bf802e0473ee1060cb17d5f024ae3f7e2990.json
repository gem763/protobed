Now, however, she\u2019s trying to make other parents going through the same thing realise that there is light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nAfter Kasey\u2019s unborn daughter, Phoenix, was stillborn at 21 weeks (after an anatomy scan at 15 showed that she had died), she was devastated.\n\nShe told CafeMom about her experience: \u2018I was very unaware of many things involving miscarriages and stillbirths until I experienced it myself.\u2019\n\nIt was through researching pregnancy loss and trying to make sense of her grief that she found out about the term rainbow baby.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis refers to a baby born after miscarriage, stillbirth, or neonatal death, and is meant to signify the beautiful things that can happen after a dark time \u2013 just like a rainbow after a storm.\n\nOne year after the scan that showed Kasey that Phoenix had died, she conceived her very own rainbow baby, Ezra, and decided that she wanted to honour Phoenix as part of celebrating her new son\u2019s birth.\n\nKasey had the photoshoot after her \u2018rainbow baby\u2019 Ezra was born (Picture: Stephanie Capps)\n\nShe did this with a photoshoot with photographer Stephanie Capps, which showed Ezra\u2019s tiny newborn feet painted to look like a rainbow.\n\n\u2018I cannot remember exactly how I came to the idea, but I did a lot of Google and YouTube searches about rainbow baby births,\u2019 Kasey says.\n\nKasey came to Stephanie with the idea, and the photos were taken not long after Ezra was first brought home from hospital.\n\n\u2018Women deserve to know that there are others that can relate to their journeys of loss and know their pain\u2019 (Picture: Stephanie Capps)\n\nThey also decided to stamp his tiny toes on a piece of paper, which could then be put into his memory box and be treasured for the rest of their lives.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just for them, though. Part of the reason Kasey and Stephanie decided on this particular shoot was to show that parents who have experienced baby loss are not alone.\n\nKasey said: \u2018I am always willing to share about my journey of loss. Women deserve to know that there are others that can relate to their journeys of loss and know their pain.\u2019\n\nShe wanted to honour Phoenix who she previously lost at 21 weeks (Picture: Stephanie Capps)\n\n\u2018Any time that I can use anything we experienced or learned in my journey of loss, grief, and joy of welcoming a rainbow baby is an opportunity for Phoenix\u2019s short existence to make a difference and to live on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I hope that others can find in our story that bit of hope that you can rise from the ashes as something beautiful and that rainbows do come after storms. I truly treasure these photos because they are a reminder of that.\u2019\n\nMORE: What I Own: Jade, a 26-year-old blogger who saved a \u00a327,000 deposit for a two-bedroom flat in Harrow\n\nMORE: Dad leaves the room for 10 minutes, returns to find his three-year-old daughter has eaten 18 pots of yoghurt\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "This beautiful rainbow baby photoshoot shows those who have lost a baby that there is light at the end of the tunnel, and you're not alone.", "authors": ["Jessica Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_91033490_1571673427.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
