Allowing hate speech, the lack of fact checking and of course the issues of interfering with democracy\u2026are among many, many other things that are very upsetting.\n\n\u2018The constant lies and conspiracy theories about me and countless of others of course result in hate, death threats and ultimately violence. This could easily be stopped if Facebook wanted to.\u2019\n\nGreta\u2019s post in full (Picture: Facebook)\n\nGreta, who staged her 62nd Friday school strike earlier this week, continued: \u2018I find the lack of taking responsibility very disturbing.\n\n\u2018But I\u2019m sure that if they are challenged and if enough of us demand change \u2013 then change will come.\u2019\n\nFacebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nHowever, in a New York Times article earlier this week, Mr Zuckerberg wrote: \u2018Over the past 15 years, I\u2019ve seen how the news has held Facebook accountable when we\u2019ve made mistakes.\n\n\u2018This can be uncomfortable, but as I often tell Facebook\u2019s employees, this kind of scrutiny is important: Facebook is part of so many people\u2019s lives, and we have a responsibility to engage with good-faith criticism and use it to get better.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
