The justification on all of their lips is oddly similar: \u201cEquity.\u201d The same buzzwords appear again and again.\n\n\u201cSchool board meetings suddenly became like Mad Libs. They started repeating certain phrases, jamming them into every sentence. It was very odd,\u201d Margaret McCreary, a Fairfax County, Virginia, parent who eventually learned that the board members were using the \u201cequity\u201d language to push a proposal that could move her children out of their schools, told the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\n\u201cIt seemed like they were all in cahoots to do something, but at first we didn\u2019t know what to make of it, because we didn\u2019t know what they were talking about,\u201d she said.\n\nFairfax was one of multiple local governments to pass sweeping changes requiring every policy to be seen through the \u201clens\u201d of race. The changes were justified by academic research from the University of Southern California (USC) that was tough for any city or county, rich or poor, to pass up: If they enacted certain policies, they were told, the cities\u2019 economies could gain billions of dollars.\n\nAn investigation by the DCNF found that across the country, these changes are being pushed on local governments by a constellation of groups who share the same funders, including George Soros. One of those groups alone is active in 33 cities and counties covering 1 in 10 Americans.\n\nA group tied to USC called the Program for Environmental and Regional Equity (PERE) functions to create research \u2014 at the behest of funders \u2014 that promises billions of dollars in economic growth. Another set of groups introduce the research to individual cities and counties, where it is used to justify a mandate to include \u201cequity\u201d in every government policy. The language is often vague and comprised of obscure jargon.\n\nThat\u2019s the stage Montgomery County, Maryland, is at now, where an official sympathetic to the movement, Uma Ahluwalia, told The Washington Post: \u201cIt\u2019s nice to throw that word, \u2018equity,\u2019 around, but what does it mean?\u201d\n\nNext, the government solicits and follows advice from a third set of groups \u2014 often affiliated with the others \u2014 who decode the mandate for them, proposing sometimes-radical policies they say are required to implement it.\n\nThe network of groups share funders and board members and coordinate closely, creating studies and memos that largely consist of circular references to others within their ecosystem.\n\nLittle evidence is presented that the actual policy changes will help achieve the promised billion-dollar economic transformation.\n\nInstead, during implementation, the financial rhetoric is swapped out with the justification that the policies are a \u201cbest practice.\u201d That means other cities that have previously intersected with the network have done it. In turn, once that city implements the prescribed changes, it is cited as a precedent to the next city where the equity groups are active, and the cycle repeats \u2014 even if the desired results never materialize.\n\nLure them in\n\nFairfax County, a wealthy District of Columbia suburb in Virginia, was sold on sweeping changes after county employees attended a 2014 conference connected to a group called the Local and Regional Government Alliance on Race and Equity (GARE). There, GARE helped unelected bureaucrats learn to steer the elected politicians they worked for by swapping out \u201cpolitically difficult\u201d language with the more innocuous-sounding \u201cequity.\u201d\n\n\u201cCollaborating with GARE also helped [Fairfax employees Karla Bruce and Karen Shaban] make the transition from focusing on \u2018disproportionality,\u2019 a concept and language that could be politically difficult, to a focus on equity and opportunity. As Bruce comments, \u2018If we hadn\u2019t made the shift from disproportionality to equity, we never would have gotten the elected officials on board,'\u201d a history says.\n\nNext, a radical activist group called PolicyLink \u2014 which pushes fringe policies such as \u201creduc[ing] the harm of policing \u2026 by challenging untested assumptions about the value-add of law enforcement\u201d and asserts that things like \u201cparks equity\u201d are responsible for racial performance gaps \u2014 makes an appearances. PERE and PolicyLink created an online tool called Equity Atlas that runs racial statistics through a crude formula to suggest that if cities enacted unspecified racial policies, they could grow their economies by billions of dollars.\n\nThe groups showed Fairfax an extended version called an \u201cEquitable Growth Profile.\u201d Swayed by the promised windfall, by July 2016, Fairfax\u2019s county board and school board enacted an unprecedented arch-policy that would control all other policies. It was a sweeping but vague manifesto, parroting the lexicon of the Equitable Growth Profile. It was called \u201cOne Fairfax.\u201d\n\n\u201cResearch institutes PolicyLink and the Program for Environmental and Regional Equity at the University of Southern California studied the economic impact of inequity in Fairfax County. It found that the county\u2019s gross domestic product would have been $26.2 billion higher in 2012 if its racial gaps in income were closed,\u201d Fairfax said on its web page explaining the policy\u2019s goal.\n\nThe policy required every other county policy to be drafted through the \u201clens\u201d of racial \u201cequity\u201d in order to do away with differences in wealth and achievement throughout the 1.2 million-person county.\n\nThe policy is seven pages long and uses the words \u201crace\u201d 12 times and \u201cequity\u201d 24 times. \u201c\u2018One Fairfax\u2019 can only be realized with an intentional racial and social equity policy at its core for all publicly delivered services. A racial and social equity policy provides both the direction and means to eliminate disparities,\u201d it said.\n\nAfter economic and academic arguments attributed to a university led to a vague policy, the complexity of the network of interconnected groups allowed those to be subtly switched with activism when it came time to telling the county what this equity policy should actually mean in practice.\n\nAll-In Cities, a group created by PolicyLink, soon said it \u201cbegan advising the county in formulating a vision for how best to enact the One Fairfax policy, and making the critical shift from policy adoption to implementation.\u201d\n\n\u2018Junk science\u2019\n\nThe Equity Atlas\u2019s methodology \u2014 the promise of billions of dollars that underlies all of these changes \u2014 appears to amount to asserting that if all white people continued to earn the same amount of money, but all racial groups who earn less than them began earning the same amount as them, the city\u2019s economy would be larger.\n\n\u201cWe estimate that the Albuquerque metro economy would have been $11 billion larger in 2015 absent its racial inequities in income,\u201d PERE\u2019s paper on the New Mexico city says. \u201cUsing data on income by race, we calculated how much higher total economic output would have been in 2014 if all racial groups who currently earn less than Whites had earned similar average incomes as their White counterparts, controlling for age.\u201d\n\nBut economists said PERE\u2019s much-touted figures fall apart under scrutiny.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no discussion of how you\u2019d attain equal incomes, it\u2019s just saying assume equal income,\u201d an economist with the Independent Institute, Richard Vedder, told the DCNF. \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence provided about how to get there. If this approach is valid, why don\u2019t we just say we want to triple the incomes of the minorities instead of double, and raise the GDP even more?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole idea is sort of bizarre. I don\u2019t see how you could equalize income without causing dislocation to the economy,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf you make the wages of blue-collar workers equal to white-collar workers, the white collar workers either demand that their pay increase, or they leave. If we dropped money out of airplanes, the nominal number of dollars in circulation might rise, but you\u2019d have inflation.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t look at factors most directly intertwined with differences in income, underlying characteristics like single-parent households,\u201d Vedder added.\n\nAn economist at the University of Rochester, Steven Landsburg, told the DCNF that PERE\u2019s core assertion is \u201cutterly ludicrous\u201d and doesn\u2019t contain enough science to be called \u201cjunk science.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is more like junk \u2018close-your-eyes-and-wish.\u2019 Worse yet, what they\u2019re wishing for is not just a distant pipe dream; it\u2019s demonstrably impossible,\u201d he said.\n\nPERE\u2019s premise appears to suppose that minorities doing service industry jobs and manual labor will move into white-collar or management positions without anyone else moving into those jobs to replace them, he said. Regardless of the race of the people doing the jobs, economies can\u2019t function without people doing jobs like \u201cbuilding factories or assembling cars or growing corn,\u201d Landsburg continued.\n\n\u201cIn a world where your wages are not tied to the value of what you\u2019re producing, people are going to choose to forgo useful labor in order to perform worthless tasks like writing nonsensical \u2018studies,'\u201d he joked to the DCNF. \u201cIn that world, there will be less for everyone.\u201d\n\nPERE did not return a request for comment.\n\nVedder said that USC was laundering activism for overtly political groups.\n\n\u201cSome universities will do anything to get publicity or money and allow their names to be used,\u201d he said.\n\nConstellation\n\nAcross the country, activist groups build their case by citing studies from two affiliated groups operating within USC: PERE and the Center for the Study of Immigrant Integration. Both are led by Manuel Pastor, a professor of sociology and American studies and ethnicity.\n\nA review of PERE\u2019s work paints a picture of a department that operates as political activists as much as traditional academics. Its website makes clear that it conducts work designed to \u201csupport\u201d groups that pay it and that are working towards social and racial \u201cjustice.\u201d\n\nIts reports include \u201cHow America\u2019s Bluest State Can Be a Model for the Other 49\u201d and \u2014 \u201cproduced with the support of the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth\u201d \u2014 papers on \u201cYouth Organizing,\u201d \u201cBuilding a Movement to Mobilize Young Voters\u201d and the \u201cState of Resistance: California in the Age of Trump.\u201d\n\nPastor was also a board member at PolicyLink.\n\nPolicyLink teamed up with the Center for American Progress \u2014 a liberal think tank tied to John Podesta, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chair \u2014 to create All-In Nation, on whose advisory board Pastor also sits. That led to All-in Cities, which says \u201cOur ambitious goal is to fundamentally reengineer America\u2019s cities.\u201d\n\nSimilar arrangements take place to bridge the gap between political advocacy and academia at the University of California, Berkeley, which houses the Haas Institute for a Fair and Inclusive Society. GARE is a partnership between Haas and Race Forward, which merged with the Center for Social Inclusion in 2017.\n\nA least three of these groups \u2014 Center for Social Inclusion, PolicyLink and the Center for American Progress \u2014 are funded by Soros through his Foundation to Promote Open Society, according to tax records available through CitizenAudit.org.\n\nMany of the groups in the network also share other funders, including the W.K. Kellogg Foundation and the Annie E. Casey Foundation, which is tied to the deceased founder of UPS.\n\nThe massive effort has one centerpiece: the construction of a narrative or \u201cframing\u201d that repeats the word \u201cequity\u201d and uses economic statistics \u2014 likely to be appealing even in moderate jurisdictions \u2014 to argue for race-based policies. On tax forms, Soros\u2019s foundation described a donation to PolicyLink as \u201cto support research and communications related to the equity as the superior growth model framing project.\u201d\n\nThe Center for the Study of Social Policy \u2014 another group Casey funded \u2014 used Fairfax to write a case study that amounted to a roadmap to repeat the game plan elsewhere.\n\n\u2018One Fairfax\u2019\n\nWhat was perhaps the most all-encompassing policy in Fairfax County in decades passed with little public input or interest. A local newspaper editorial \u2014 one of the only examples of contemporaneous coverage \u2014 scoffed at \u201cOne Fairfax\u201d not as dangerous, but as meaningless feel-good language, calling the measure \u201ccompletely over the top with buzzwords, jargon and platitudes.\u201d (RELATED: Fairfax Girl Falsely Told Police Classmates Cut Her Dreadlocks)\n\n\u201cWhen you first heard the word equity, most people aren\u2019t going to get involved and object. No one can define it, but in theory it doesn\u2019t raise people\u2019s eyebrows,\u201d McCreary, the Fairfax parent, said. \u201cThen you learn the endpoint that they have in mind and what it means to the people who are pushing it. By then, it\u2019s already written into policy, and they use it to justify things that most people don\u2019t agree with.\u201d\n\nFor her, the changes hit home this summer when the school board proposed revising its policy for drawing school boundaries.\n\nThe old policy said decisions about changing which neighborhoods are zoned to which schools would be made based on factors such as \u201cinstructional effectiveness\u201d and \u201cthe impact on neighborhoods.\u201d Those were struck in the revised proposal, which sets the first criteria governing establishment of school boundaries as \u201cthe socioeconomic and/or racial composition of students.\u201d\n\nMore than 100 residents of various races who bought homes in areas zoned to schools with high test scores stormed a school board meeting in July. They said that their property values would plummet by hundreds of thousands of dollars and that even local minority activists were not actually asking for school rezoning along demographic lines. A vote on the policy change was postponed.\n\nBut county officials indicated that ultimately they\u2019d have no choice in the matter because One Fairfax requires all other policies to be seen through the \u201clens\u201d of race.\n\n\u201cOne Fairfax happened, and I\u2019m superintendent, and I don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve had a One Fairfax lens for the boundary process,\u201d superintendent Scott Brabrand said in a board meeting when explaining why a change to the policy governing boundaries was needed.\n\nBeneath the radar\n\nIn 2012, the liberal-leaning Sunlight Foundation \u2014 itself backed by Soros \u2014 exposed the way a conservative group, the American Legislative Exchange Council, spread conservative policy with outsized influence by drafting \u201cmodel bills.\u201d They were successfully implanted into state legislatures and were quietly adopted nearly word-for-word.\n\nObservers say the \u201cequity\u201d network\u2019s strategy of approaching the most unscrutinized layers of government \u2014 counties and cities \u2014 is effective because local governments have the biggest day-to-day impact on people\u2019s everyday lives, but often receive the least attention from citizens and the media.\n\nFew people \u201cvote in local elections and no one pays attention to local government news. Constituents just assume that elected officials will do the mundane job of running a county based on local residents\u2019 desires and needs. Then you find out they\u2019re using us in an experiment for some national group,\u201d McCreary said.\n\nPolicyLink also aims to implant liberal policies in red states by circumventing the state level; it is active in Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina and Louisiana. Another umbrella group, the Partnership for Southern Equity, joins together PolicyLink, Race Forward and the Annie E. Casey Foundation in the south.\n\nAcross the country\n\nAll-In Cities says it is active in 33 areas with a combined population of 27 million, nearly 10% of America: Asheville, North Carolina; Atlanta; Austin, Texas; Baltimore; Birmingham, Alabama; Boston; Buffalo, New York; Charlotte, North Carolina; Cincinnati; Denver; Fairfax, Virginia; Fresno, California; Houston; Long Island, New York; Louisville, Kentucky; Memphis, Tennessee; Milwaukee; Minneapolis; St. Paul, Minnesota; Nashville, Tennessee; Newark, New Jersey; New Orleans; Oakland, California; Philadelphia; Phoenix; Pittsburgh; Portland, Oregon; Richmond, Virginia; Sacramento, California; San Jose, California; Santa Fe, New Mexico; St. Louis; and Stockton, California.\n\nAs Fairfax remade its county in the name of \u201cOne Fairfax,\u201d in 2018, the city of Atlanta created \u201cOne Atlanta,\u201d also known as the \u201cMayor\u2019s Office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne Atlanta is charged with ensuring more equitable access to economic and workforce development opportunities \u2026 establishing an Equity Impact Assessment \u2026 [and] supporting the Mayor\u2019s progressive agenda,\u201d a city press release said.\n\nIn 2018, Baltimore codifed racial equity into law by passing a bill \u201crequiring city agencies to assess existing and proposed policies and practices for disparate outcomes based on race, gender, or income and to proactively develop policies, practices, and investments to prevent and redress those disparate outcomes.\u201d\n\nThen it amended its founding document, the City Charter, \u201cAuthorizing the establishment of a continuing, non-lapsing Equity Assistance Fund, to be used exclusively to assist efforts that reduce inequity based on race, gender, or economic status.'\u201d\n\nResults lacking\n\nIn Seattle, the city paid PolicyLink in 2014 to advise on \u201chow to incorporate equity into its growth scenario modeling and into its Comprehensive Plan chapters.\u201d In 2015 it \u201cinvited PolicyLink to analyze the draft Comprehensive Plan,\u201d allowing it to shape a major 20-year plan for the city.\n\nTypical of its feedback was the suggestion that the city should not just say it strives to improve its mass transit system, but specifically \u201celiminate transportation commute time disparities experienced by residents of color.\u201d A plan to put artwork up around town should \u201cprioritiz[e] city-wide commissions from artists of color\u201d and tourists should not just frequent the Space Needle, but also travel to \u201ccommunities of color.\u201d\n\nLittle evidence has been presented that such changes has moved the needle, much less created billions of dollars in wealth. As The Washington Post reported, \u201cRecent research from Stanford University found that from 2016 to 2017, the gap in test scores between black and white students in Seattle actually increased.\u201d\n\nPolicyLink told Seattle it should follow the best practices used by California cities following the California Planning Roundtable, which it described as \u201cthe most experienced local planning directors, consultants and academics\u201d using \u201cpeer-reviewed models.\u201d An author of the PolicyLink paper also sits on that roundtable, creating the type of circular reference and feedback loop that is common in the network.\n\nThe network of groups sometimes creates local affiliates that give the appearance of organic support and obscure the origins of the push. They quickly gain buy-in from local governments by giving local officials seats on the boards.\n\nAs PolicyLink named Buffalo as one of its \u201cAll-In Cities,\u201d the Kellogg Foundation funded a nonprofit there, the Racial Equity Roundtable, which in 2018 put out a report called the \u201cRacial Equity Dividend.\u201d The report cited PolicyLink and PERE and said \u201cracial diversity has been shown to lead to better business performance \u2026 the region would be an estimated $12 billion wealthier.\u201d\n\nThe apparent rigor of the study was appealing to local leaders. The roundtable\u2019s chair heralded the \u201cdata-driven approach. \u2026 We wouldn\u2019t sit around and speculate.\u201d\n\nThe report led to the city hiring a chief equity officer who \u201csees part of her new job as incorporating the [roundtable] report\u2019s recommendations.\u201d\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
