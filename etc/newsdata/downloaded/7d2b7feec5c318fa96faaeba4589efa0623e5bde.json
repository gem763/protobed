Both are now jockeying to get the first chance to form a coalition government.\n\nThe Arab backing provided momentum for Mr. Gantz\u2019s bid to lead the country, but by no means clinched it. Arab lawmakers said they wouldn\u2019t sit in any government led by Mr. Gantz but would merely support him over Mr. Netanyahu, the country\u2019s longest-serving premier who they say has pursued policies that discriminate against Arab citizens of Israel.\n\nComplicating matters, Avigdor Lieberman, seen as this election\u2019s kingmaker, withheld support for both Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Gantz, ensuring that neither would have a majority backing them to forge ahead.\n\nShare Your Thoughts Who do you think will become Israel\u2019s next prime minister? Join the conversation below.\n\nSunday\u2019s moves highlighted the fractured nature of Israeli politics and set the tone for what will be weeks of a game of chess, with Mr. Lieberman trying to influence them. Israeli President Reuven Rivlin began consulting with political parties on Sunday before he is expected to choose who forms a government in coming days or weeks.\n\nMr. Gantz is expected to pick up support from left-wing and centrist parties, while Mr. Netanyahu has received pledges from right-wing and religious parties. Neither is on track to receive support from 61 lawmakers to create a majority in the 120-seat Knesset, Israel\u2019s parliament.\n\nThe results have put Mr. Netanyahu on the brink of losing power after he called a do-over election following his inability to form a government after a vote in April. Mr. Netanyahu faces a potential indictment on bribery and fraud allegations in the coming months, with a pretrial hearing next week, and would likely have to resign if charges were brought when he wasn\u2019t prime minister.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in unprecedented times here in Israel,\u201d said Mitchell Barak, a Jerusalem-based political analyst and pollster.\n\nA surge in Arab turnout, to 60% from 49% in April, helped put the prime minister at a disadvantage.\n\nArab lawmakers usually abstain from recommending candidates for prime minister because they say Israel\u2019s biggest political parties don\u2019t support the country\u2019s Arab citizens. This time, they decided ousting Mr. Netanyahu was more important than boycotting the nomination process, said Ayman Odeh, the head of the Joint List, a union of four Arab parties that is the third-largest in Israel\u2019s parliament, with 13 seats.\n\n\u201cFor us, the most important thing is removing Benjamin Netanyahu from power,\u201d Mr. Odeh said in a meeting with Mr. Rivlin on Sunday.\n\nMr. Odeh said the Joint List won\u2019t serve in a Blue and White led government. Their demands for joining would include a freeze on home demolitions in unrecognized Arab villages and immediately initiating a peace process with the Palestinian Authority based on Israel\u2019s pre-1967 borders. Those positions would be politically challenging for Mr. Gantz or the head of any Zionist Israeli party to support, particularly since as much as 60% of the Jewish Israeli public identifies as right wing.\n\nMr. Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party issued a statement criticizing the Joint Lists\u2019 decision. \u201cWe can\u2019t have a government that relies on Arab parties that oppose the State of Israel,\u201d the statement said.\n\nMoshe Ya\u2019alon, one of the heads of Blue and White said Sunday the party will work toward forming a government with a broad spectrum of parties, including Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s Likud, a coalition often called a unity government.\n\nMr. Lieberman cited the Arab parties\u2019 support for Mr. Gantz as a reason he wouldn\u2019t back him at this stage. At a news conference Sunday, he described the Arab parties as political enemies who are trying to ruin Israel from within.\n\n\u201cWherever they are, we will be on the other side,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also ruled out sitting with the Democratic Union, a left-wing group, and religious parties.\n\nMr. Rivlin said the Israeli public wants a stable government, which can\u2019t happen without the two largest parties.\n\nA unity government, for now, appears stymied by promises made ahead of the election, though it still remains the most likely outcome. Mr. Gantz has said he would sit with Likud but not with Mr. Netanyahu while he faces legal trouble. He has also promised not to sit with the religious parties.\n\nMr. Netanyahu, on the other hand, said he would only sit in a government that included his right-wing and religious bloc, including two ultra-Orthodox parties.\n\nIt is up to Mr. Rivlin to square the circle of Israeli politics. Elected to the largely ceremonial role in 2014 after a long career as a lawmaker with the Likud Party, Mr. Rivlin is widely respected and seen as being above Israel\u2019s fractious politics. Experts said the apparent impasse could give Mr. Rivlin more power than the president has traditionally exercised\n\n\u201cThe question is, what is Rivlin going to do?\u201d Mr. Barak said.\n\nIf the first person who gets the nod to form a government fails, Mr. Rivlin can give the mandate to a second person, likely the head of the second-largest party, and if that fails, new elections are likely.\n\nWrite to Felicia Schwartz at Felicia.Schwartz@wsj.com", "description": "Israel\u2019s Arab parties on Sunday backed Benny Gantz as Israel\u2019s prime minister on Sunday, endorsing a potential leader for the first time in nearly three decades in a bid to oust Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.", "authors": ["Felicia Schwartz", "Felicia.Schwartz Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109702/social", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
