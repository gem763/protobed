Elizabeth Warren on Tuesday night during the fourth Democrat primary debate.\n\nWarren was attacked sixteen times during the debate, according to an NBC tracker, primarily on her proposals for universal health care and her proposed extreme wealth tax.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar attacked Warren five different times, while former Vice President Joe Biden and Mayor Pete Buttigieg attacked her on three different occasions.\n\nKamala Harris and Beto O\u2019Rourke attacked Warren on two occasions each, and Andrew Yang attacked her one time.\n\nKlobuchar defended her attacks, saying that she wanted to be president of all of America, not just half of America.\n\n\u201cIf people are tired of the noise and nonsense and the extremes, they\u2019ve got a home with me,\u201d she said afterward to CNN.\n\nKlobuchar said that Warren\u2019s Medicare-for-all was a \u201cpipe dream\u201d and she did \u201cnot even come close\u201d to answering the question about how she planned to pay for her plan.\n\n\u201cAs I\u2019ve said, Bernie [Sanders] has answered that question, he\u2019s made that very clear, and I think that\u2019s one of the things she needs to do,\u201d she said afterward.\n\nMayor Pete Buttigieg, who signaled his criticism of Warren\u2019s plan in a campaign ad earlier Tuesday, immediately challenged Warren on her healthcare plan.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris challenged Warren for failing to join her call to ban President Donald Trump from Twitter. Biden repeated that Warren was being \u201cvague\u201d on the cost of her healthcare plan.\n\nThe attacks on Warren spoke volumes to the pundits, who described her as the clear frontrunner for the Democrat primary.\n\nBiden, who experienced the brunt of the attacks in the early debates, was only attacked twice.", "description": "Democrat candidates for president overwhelmingly targeted Sen.
