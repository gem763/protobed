Johnson was compelled to clarify his intentions to the court after anti-Brexit campaigners launched a legal challenge to prevent the prime minister from taking the U.K. outside the EU without a deal on October 31.\n\n\"Firstly the government will comply with the law, and secondly it will comply with undertakings given to the court in respect of the law.\" \u2014 Stephen Barclay\n\nThe Brexit secretary confirmed the EU and the U.K. are discussing a revised political declaration. He said he is confident parliament\u2019s ratification of the withdrawal agreement could happen very quickly and could be finished by October 31, eliminating the need to seek an extension. \u201cThis is a House that can move very quickly when it wishes to do so,\u201d Barclay said.\n\nAsked whether he would be comfortable with an extension to tidy up the details if a deal is close, Barclay said: \u201cNo. It is important that we leave on October 31. I think the House has demonstrated through the Benn legislation, the Cooper legislation, its ability to legislate in a quick manner.\u201d\n\nThe Scottish National Party MP Joanna Cherry, one of the petitioners of the Scottish court case, warned Barclay that sending a second letter to Brussels cancelling the request of an extension letter would amount to frustrating the Benn Act. But Barclay said he is \u201cnot aware\u201d of any government plan to send two letters to Brussels. \u201cI don\u2019t think it is right and proper for me to get into detailed analysis of the law [Benn Act], interpretations, definitions and otherwise,\u201d he added.\n\nCommenting on the post-Brexit relationship between the U.K. and the EU, Barclay said the British government has no intention to deregulate its economy or to use state aid rules in a way that gives unfair advantage to companies in Britain.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any desire to have a deregulatory approach. The question is to what extent do you have sovereign control of your regulation and what\u2019s the interplay between your regulatory commitments and your market access \u2026 I\u2019m sure that will be part of the discussion with the EU moving forward,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added: \u201cIf you look at our starting point, the U.K. is not a country that has abused state aid and that is reflected by the position. So the idea that we would use state aid to advantage our businesses at the expense of those in Europe is belied by what the current data shows.\u201d", "description": "Stephen Barclay confirms the EU and the UK are discussing a revised political declaration.", "authors": ["Cristina Gallardo", "Hugo Dixon", "David M.
