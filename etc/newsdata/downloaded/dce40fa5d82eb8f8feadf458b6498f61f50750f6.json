It was the most consequential impeachment trial in Anglo-American politics (and still is, with the possible exception of Andrew Johnson\u2019s), and it was conducted in a setting to match, the cavernous, medieval Westminster Hall. Tickets are said to have sold for as much as \u00a350, the equivalent of more than $9,000 today. To the more reflective spectators, the Hastings impeachment mattered because the empire was on trial; to the rest, it was simply the show of the season.\n\nFor Americans in 2019, with impeachment still a live issue, the trial ought to matter for another reason, because of the man who, along with Hastings, stood at its center: the lead prosecutor, Edmund Burke. Burke is the rare political thinker to have both theorized about impeachment and participated in one. The questions that he pursued through his prosecution of Hastings\u2014Is impeachment a political deliberation or a judicial trial? What purposes should an impeachment accomplish? What is the right standard of guilt?\u2014are still questions that occupy Americans today.\n\nOf course, Burke can\u2019t tell us whether or not to impeach President Donald Trump. But his example is especially valuable because he leads us beyond the standard domestic arguments about impeachment\u2014which usually turn on the precise meaning of \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d\u2014to reflect more broadly on its purpose.\n\nYoni Appelbaum: Impeach Donald Trump\n\nImpeachment is a hybrid process, legal and political at the same time. It takes the form of an indictment followed by a trial\u2014but a trial in which the accused, the prosecutors, and the judges are all politicians. While these two aspects are in tension in any impeachment, Burke repeatedly demanded that the emphasis be placed on the political: Impeachment, he insisted, is a trial \u201ctried before Statesmen and by Statesmen, upon solid principles of State morality.\u201d Proof of \u201cmisconduct in Office\u201d was sufficient for conviction, and if this standard necessarily invited moral argumentation\u2014less tidy than the letter of the law\u2014that was all to the good. As Burke told the court, we have \u201cthe principles of honour, the spirit of cavaliers to govern here; not the low principles of jurisprudence only.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, Hastings and his lawyers demanded that the impeachment be conducted as a criminal proceeding. Departing from the model of a common-law trial, argued one of his parliamentary supporters, would replace impartial standards with electoral head-counting, \u201caccording to the strength of the party prosecuting or defending.\u201d\n\nThat prospect did not especially trouble Burke, who stressed impeachment\u2019s origins as a means for asserting parliamentary control over crown appointees such as Hastings. But his reasons for emphasizing the political nature of impeachment went deeper.", "description": "In the trial of Warren Hastings, the statesman argued that impeachment was a political process.", "authors": ["Rob Goodman", "Political Theorist At Ryerson University"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/GettyImages_463951077/facebook.jpg?1569363682", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
