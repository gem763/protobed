My understanding is that this intervention to contradict the forecaster was not based on science but on external factors including reputation and appearance, or simply put, political,\u201d he continued.\n\nMr. McLean went on to call the press release \u201cvery concerning\u201d as it put the agency\u2019s reputation into question.\n\n\u201cIt compromises the ability of NOAA to convey life-saving information necessary to avoid substantial and specific danger to public health and safety. If the public cannot trust our information, or we debase our forecaster\u2019s warnings and products, that specific danger arises,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cI have a responsibility to pursue these truths. I will,\u201d he added.\n\nMr. McLean\u2019s statement was originally circulated internally Monday before being posted as a public memo Tuesday.\n\nMr. Trump has defended his warnings that Hurricane Dorian would threaten parts of Alabama, despite major hurricane forecasting that later showed Alabama was in virtually no danger of being hit.\n\nDuring an Oval Office press gaggle, Mr. Trump even displayed a hurricane forecast map with an extra bubble drawn in black ink to include parts of Alabama, reportedly to prove his point.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
