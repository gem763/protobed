In certain phases of the game we took big risks but you need to play like that against such opponents.\u201d\n\nBarcelona, harried all night by a hard-running Slavia side, reclaimed their advantage in the 57th minute when a Luis Suarez shot from a tight angle bounced off Peter Olayinka and into the net.\n\nSlavia continued to push forward but despite a number of efforts inside the box could not breach a stubborn Barcelona backline that defended in numbers and blocked several last-gasp shots.\n\n\u201cThat was exactly the Slavia performance we expected. When we lost the ball they threw people forward and by the end they took so many risks it was like defending against an avalanche of attacks,\u201d Valverde said.\n\n\u201cGames like this we have to learn how to manage better. We had better, clearer chances but we lacked the cold-blooded calmness in their half which could have sealed the result.\u201d\n\nThe win puts Barcelona top of Group F with seven points from three games while Slavia are bottom with one point. Elsewhere, Inter Milan beat Borussia Dortmund 2-0 and both teams are on four points in the group.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "A quick-fire strike from Lionel Messi and a second half own goal gave Barcelona a 2-1 win over Slavia Prague in a thrilling Champions League Group F encounter on Wednesday", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/download-3-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
