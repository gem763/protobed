Under the fifth roof\n\nMatthew Barnett Howland and Dido Milne said they were inspired to build the home as 'simply as possible'.\n\nMatthew called it 'primitive, caveman stuff' and revealed they hadn't used any glue or water on the home, which was created by simply stacking 1,200 blocks.\n\nThe Cork House, in Berkshire, is made entirely from cork blocks stacked upon one another, with huge sky lights acting like 'paper weights' to keep the property from blowing away\n\nMeanwhile the interiors of the home are simplistic and chic, with large windows allowing light to flood into the space\n\nThere's a lot of air in cork, making it extremely light, so the building has sky-lights which act like paperweights to make sure the whole structure doesn't blow away.\n\nDido compared it to 'plant-based Lego.'\n\nThe material of cork is harvested from the bark of living trees, which regenerates, making it highly sustainable.\n\nWhen the building gets to the end of its working life, it can be taken apart and put back in the soil to biodegrade.\n\nInside, the natural cork has been left unfinished, although some of the walls have been paneled with wood to give it some insulation.\n\nDido said: 'At the moment it's like a big pin board', while Kevin called the house 'beautiful, atmospheric and understated.'\n\nMatt and Dido spent six years building the cork house, and started the proejct with Matt's father William, who sadly passed away midway through the build.\n\nMatt suggested it was his father's determination that had seen them finish off the project, saying: 'He was very good at saying not to give up.'\n\nThe property features five 'chimney' style turrets on top of each seperated room, which allow light into the space\n\nConverted garage\n\nNicola and Ty Tikari created their three floor family home 'Pocket House' after buying a garage plot in South London.\n\nThey were faced with opposition from the local council, with Ty revealing when they started building: 'We received the letter from the local authority, was not so positive.'\n\nTy said: '[It said something like] Don't come back, nothing on the site is going to be accepted. We took that as a challenge.'\n\nThe smallest house on the list, it consists of two crafted boxes balanced on top of each other, with a floorspace of 35 square metres.\n\nMicrohome Pocket House, in South London, was built within the confines of an old garage, and sees almost 50 per cent of it's living space in the basement floor, which is below the ground\n\nDue to planning restrictions, the micro-home had to be built within the confines of the original garage.\n\nTy explained: 'We could only build within footprint of double garage on ground floor. We have to make the first floor even smaller to follow the line of the terraces.'\n\nHe added: 'Some of our friends and family were uncertain over what we had committed ourselves to.'\n\nWhile the ground floor and the first floor had to be within the original garage, the couple were able to dig out to the edges of the site to create the basement, where their bedrooms are situated, which means 50 per cent of their living space is below the ground.\n\nEvery element of the home has been designed in order to maximise space and light, with the main living area on the first floor of the two-bedroom house\n\nTy explained: 'Without the basement there wouldn't be a home.'\n\nThe couple live in the small two-bedroom family home with their two young daughters.\n\nTy said: 'This type of house is something you might see more in places in Tokyo for example, where people are fighting for everyone inch of land.'\n\nAnd Kevin was astonished by the home, saying: 'The effect magics up a sense of peace and refuge from the outside world.'\n\nOn the ground floor, the kitchen is tranquil and crafted from simple materials, with Danish bricks are all exposed.\n\nTy said: 'Every millimeter was critical for making the spaces work.'\n\nThe neighbours are fascinated by the project, with one saying: 'I think it's beautiful, I really like it. I spent a lot of time staring into the windows, you can't see in as much as you could. I'm quite nosy.'\n\nModern-day castle\n\nMeanwhile Nithurst Farm in Sussex is another of the experimental homes on the long list for the award, with the architect Adam Richards admitting he wanted to create a 'modern house wrapped in a roman ruin'\n\nThe main room in the house is a huge 'great hall' inspired living space, which features smaller practical areas, such as utility room and a study, coming off it\n\nThe bold 'modern day castle' in Sussex is home to architect Adam Richards and his family, who revealed: 'I've always loved old buildings, so it's great to be able to adapt them for today.'\n\nThe six bedroom property was compared to 'a modern house wrapped in a roman ruin' on the programme.\n\nCreated from 30,000 bricks, Adam used very thick mortar joins to created the illusion of using smaller bricks.\n\nHe said: 'We've used very thick mortar joins to play a trick with the brick, they're normal size brick, but mortar is three times as big to suggests the bricks are tiny.'\n\nThe huge central room in the six bedroom property was compared to a Roman ruin, as well as an enormous concrete church on the programme\n\nThe couple said they were keen to build a home that worked architecturally, as well as acting as a family home (pictured, the main living space)\n\nBut his insistence on the authenticity of the build meant the builders couldn't lay the mortar for six months while they waited for the right weather.\n\nIt took two years from start to finish to build the house, with a concrete structure built before the bricks encased it.\n\nKevin called it a 'modern concrete church', with a huge vaulted ceiling in the main room created a great hall.\n\nJessica said: 'It was very important to balance the ideas with the practicalities of a family home.'\n\nThe home also features two master bedrooms on the top floor as Adam is a snorer, while wife Jessica is a light sleeper.\n\nTrendy eco home\n\nHalf home and half power station, Lark Rise, in Chiltern Hills, is also featured on the longlist for the award\n\nActing as half home and half eco power station, Lark Rise, which is hidden among the trees of Chiltern Hills, was described as a 'super experimental green home'.\n\nKevin McCloud called the two bedroom home, which prioritises it's energy-efficiency above all else, as 'elegant, unfussy but high tech'.\n\nThe two bedroom home was built by Swiss psychiatrist, Hannie Verderker: 'I grew up in a family where we did not waste. I do not buy more than I want.'\n\nHer dislike of waste led her to built a house that doesn't waste a thing, so the house holds onto every bit of energy it can, with super thick insulation, and heat saved from the oven to keep the rooms warm.\n\nThe house was created by Hannie Verderker who said she was determined to waste as little as possible when building a home\n\nIt generates more than it uses and acts as a mini power station, with 38 solar panels on the roof.\n\nDelicate, low-carbon eco wall-supports divide the space. while huge windows allow the light and landscape pouring into the building.\n\nThe house took two years to build and to make it as efficient as possible, it was made as insulated as possible.\n\nContemporary cottage\n\nContemporary cottage Stack Yard, in Derbyshire, was the fifth home featured on the programme, and was praised for it's innovative design while blending into a small country village\n\nThe surprising contemporary cottage in Derbyshire called Stack Yard distorts and warps what you would expect to find in a small country village.\n\nWith a plywood inside, corrugated roof, the low key experiment is by architect James Boon, who designed it for him and his wife Carol.\n\nThey had been living in a semi-detached three bedroom home in Derby, before deciding they didn't want to have children, and ditching the traditional home so they weren't left 'rattling around'.\n\nThe home features a small courtyard space, which also contains a miniature vegetable patch and green house\n\nThe house is entered by the side through a courtyard.\n\nJames decided against building the two bedroom home a rectangular shape, and instead it was shape shifted to the irregular plot size.\n\nCarol said: 'We had quite a big garden before, so we've got one veg bed and one small greenhouse.'\n\nBuilt the house for under \u00a3160,000, which meant finding a low cost but beautiful finishing, so covered the walls with plywood.\n\nMeanwhile the interiors have been specifically modified and designed to cater for the couple's lifestyles (pictured, the study that James created used shelving)\n\nThe bedrooms are downstairs, while the main living space is above, with a stunning vaulted ceiling.\n\nMeanwhile a custom made dining table built into the stairs to save space, and in the study they created a library with their own shelving.\n\nGrand Designs airs on Channel 4 tonight at 9pm", "description": "Kevin McCloud is set to reveal five experimental homes in the running for the 2019 Royal Institute of British Architects House of the Year on Grand Designs tonight, including a home made from cork.", "authors": ["Harriet Johnston For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/00/20061132-0-image-a-16_1571787304639.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
