After attending the event and interviewing Google\u2019s hardware leader, Rick Osterloh, earlier this week, today\u2019s episode turns to how the Pixel 4 fits into the broader \u201cflagship phone\u201d group and how its camera stands up to the iPhone.\n\nIn the second half of the show, Casey Newton and Adi Robertson join in to analyze what Mark Zuckerberg was trying to say about free speech in regards to Facebook and political advertising. How big of a role will Facebook have in the 2020 election? Should Facebook just ban all political ads?\n\nThere\u2019s a whole lot more in between all of that \u2014 like Paul\u2019s weekly segment \u201cThe crime, teens, is flavor\u201d \u2014 so listen through to get it all.\n\nStories discussed this week:", "description": "This week on The Vergecast, Nilay, Dieter, and Paul go through all the products Google announced at their event.
