Dow, Boeing and Caterpillar led the way higher.\n\nThe S&P 500 edged up 0.96 point, or less than 0.1%, to 2979.39, but the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped 3.28 points, or less than 0.1%, to 8084.16.\n\nInvestors continued to rotate out of high-growth tech stocks, in favor of beaten-down sectors like energy, for the second consecutive session. The shift coincided with a rise in government-bond yields -- the yield on the 10-year Treasury edged up to 1.706% Tuesday, from 1.632% Monday. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.\n\nTrading has been relatively subdued this week as investors await policy decisions from central bankers later this month.\n\nShares of software companies and chip makers were among the biggest decliners, with both groups coming under pressure recently amid anxiety about the U.S.-China trade dispute and speculation over a downturn in the global economy. Microsoft and Applied Materials dropped 1.1% and 0.9%, respectively.\n\nAnalysts also monitored Apple's annual showcase, where the tech giant revealed a trio of new iPhones. Apple shares ticked up $2.53, or 1.2%, to $216.70.\n\nData released Tuesday showed U.S. job openings fell for a second straight month in July, a potential indication that the recent hiring slowdown is a sign that companies are being cautious. Job openings, a closely watched measure of labor market health, dropped 3% from a year earlier in July to 7.217 million after declining 2% in June, the Labor Department said in its latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey.\n\n\"The U.S. economy is doing just fine with the consumer very strong, while unemployment is still low,\" said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments. \"How central banks act and what their language is will give a clue as to whether or not there's a sustained potential for an economic recovery or whether we're still on the edge.\"\n\nInvestors await meetings later this month where central banks are expected to lower borrowing costs. The Federal Reserve is broadly expected to lower rates by 25 basis points when it meets next week following a weaker-than-expected August jobs report.\n\nMeanwhile, analysts expect the European Central Bank will cut 10 basis points from benchmark interest rates when it meets Thursday. As of mid-September, the market had been pricing in a cut of 20 basis points, as well as renewed quantitative easing, said Gareth Isaac, chief investment officer for EMEA fixed income at Invesco. But the eurozone's economy isn't in too bad a shape, he said, which may temper the amount or timing of QE that some on the ECB board will tolerate.\n\nUnlike in the U.S., where investors seem fairly confident that an interest-rate cut is coming, European investors remain skeptical of how aggressive the ECB will be, said David Madden, a market analyst with CMC Markets.\n\nBut without the reassurance of the ECB's intentions, \"it's a bit of a wait and see,\" he said. \"Traders are just a bit hesitant.\"\n\nIn Tuesday's action, Ford Motor shares fell 12 cents, or 1.3%, to $9.42, after Moody's Investors cut the company's bond rating to junk status.\n\nWendy's stock slumped $2.24, or 10%, to $19.71, after the burger chain said investments in more menu items for breakfast had prompted it to adjust guidance for its fiscal year.\n\nShares of Wells Fargo slipped 10 cents, or 0.2%, to $48.31, after UBS cut its rating on the bank to \"neutral\" from \"buy,\" saying the bank lacks visibility on profitability improvement.\n\nIn commodity markets, U.S. crude oil slipped 0.8% to settle at $57.40 a barrel as President Trump dismissed National Security Adviser John Bolton, a policy hawk who has been aggressive toward major oil producers.\n\nGold prices fell 0.8% to settle at $1490.30 a troy ounce.\n\nElsewhere, the Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.1%. Asian markets were muted, with the Shanghai Composite down 0.1% and Japan's Nikkei 225 up 0.4%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng was flat.\n\nWrite to Jessica Menton at Jessica.Menton@wsj.com and Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 10, 2019 17:10 ET (21:10 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png"}
