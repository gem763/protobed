That equipment failure is now being investigated.\n\nThe Tick Fire was reported shortly before 1.45pm on Thursday, and by Friday morning, flames already had consumed more than 4,000 acres and many homes within its path.\n\nIn Sonoma County, flames have scorched nearly 22,000 acres and destroyed at least 49 structures, including 21 homes.\n\n\n\nThis week's fire-season forecasts predicted a threatening combination of high winds and dry air in the state's tinder-like forestry.\n\nCal Fire, the state's fire agency, has reported roughly 163,000 acres have burned so far this year.\n\nThe fires follow devastating fires in 2017 and 2018, killing dozens of people and ripping through thousands of buildings in northern California.\n\nThe Tubbs Fire in 2017 killed 22 people and destroyed 5,000 homes in Santa Rosa. The Camp Fire in Paradise killed 86 people and destroyed 20,000 buildings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Wildfires in California have forced the evacuation of 40,000 residents north of Los Angeles and another 2,000 in the state's wine country.The so-called Tick Fire, which began Thursday afternoon just outside the city of Santa Clarita, had consumed about 4,000 acres and was only 5 per cent contained", "authors": ["Alex Woodward"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5.dP0.I5D2Crin4bY.UpTw--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/576f0cced1d653da9753d7444fe0973a", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
