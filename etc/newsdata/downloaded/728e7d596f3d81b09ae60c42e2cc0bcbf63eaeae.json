But I missed the bed and fell over.\n\n\u2018I had to have an operation, be written out of some scenes and take time off \u2013 which I hate doing as I don\u2019t like letting people down. But everyone was so lovely.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite the incident, Sue is determined to carry on and has no plans to slow down anytime soon on Corrie \u2013 after playing the character for the past 40 years.\n\nAudrey has disappeared as in real life Sue had an operation after a nasty fall (Picture: Rex)\n\n\u2018I have fun here, I\u2019d never want to just sit at home,\u2019 she said. \u2018If they ever got rid of me I might try doing other things \u2013 I\u2019d love to go back to singing and get my voice trained again \u2013 just to do something. I wouldn\u2019t retire.\u2019\n\n\u2018If they\u2019ll have me, I\u2019d love to be here in 10 years\u2019 time because I like playing her,\u2019 she continued. \u2018There\u2019s lots to achieve yet, so if I get the sack I\u2019ll lock myself in Audrey\u2019s salon and refuse to leave.\u2019\n\nThe Corrie legend was awarded for her work on the show back in June at the British Soap Awards with a special message from Sir Ian McKellen.\n\nSue was surprised with the honour, and in her speech joked: \u2018I was paid for all those scenes, you know?\u2019\n\n\u2018I love it, I\u2019m better in the Weatherfield world than I am in the real world to be honest. But I want to thank everybody, and all the studio people that put the show on.\u2019\n\nMore: Audrey Roberts Coronation Street spoilers: Jim McDonald returns amid devastating illness story for Emma?
