Or, rather, by what she didn\u2019t hear. Namely about the Right\u2019s efforts to limit abortion:\n\nOne of the greatest threats to our society and common good is the criminalization of abortion, and yet not a peep, not a single mention about it the #DemDebate. This is not a drill. Clinics are shutting down. The right is being creative in this battle, we need to be creative too. \u2014 Liz Plank (@feministabulous) September 13, 2019\n\nThe right has come up with new and evil ways of stripping abortion access, and yet we on the left keep uttering the same platitudes about a woman's right to choose. We are bringing a knife to a gun fight. We need a better strategy because the cost of losing is far too great. \u2014 Liz Plank (@feministabulous) September 13, 2019\n\nStill with her? Because it\u2019s about to get really good:\n\nWhen the left frames the criminalization of abortion as a \"women's issue,\" it becomes seen as niche, impacting only a sliver of the population, rather than an urgent crisis like climate change or gun safety with dramatic public health consequences for all of us, men included. \u2014 Liz Plank (@feministabulous) September 13, 2019\n\nAbortion rights don't just enhance men's lives on a collective level, it allows them to thrive. One study found that boys who can avoid becoming teenage fathers have a greater chance of going to college if abortion is an option for them and their partner https://t.co/I3izZAzAZC \u2014 Liz Plank (@feministabulous) September 13, 2019\n\nSince Roe v Wade passed, 50 million abortions have been performed which means millions of women have benefited from the right to choose. But what we rarely acknowledge is that this also means that millions of men also benefited from the right to choose too. \u2014 Liz Plank (@feministabulous) September 13, 2019\n\nAt least one man on that stage last night was able to run for president because of the right to abortion and has benefited from the tireless work of reproductive justice advocates, most of which are women. The best way for them to have our backs is not to remain on the sidelines \u2014 Liz Plank (@feministabulous) September 13, 2019\n\nFemale politicians have heroically publicly shared their deeply personal abortion stories, from @wendydavis to @JackieSpeier. So the only question that remains is who will be the first male politician to be brave enough to do it too? \u2014 Liz Plank (@feministabulous) September 13, 2019\n\nOh no! She\u2019s said too much:\n\n\u201cLook! It eliminates the impoverished and lets men avoid the responsibility of fatherhood!\u201d \u2014 Good Tweetman (@Goodtweet_man) September 13, 2019\n\nIsn't that one of the main pro-life arguments? Like a considerable amounts of abortions are are forced upon women by irresponsible boyfriends. \u2014 Tumbleweed (@tumblewysp) September 13, 2019\n\nI love it when they make my arguments for me \u2014 Good Tweetman (@Goodtweet_man) September 13, 2019\n\nSpeaking of which, check out this other argument she made (before deleting it):\n\nAnd there you have it.\n\nAgain saying the quiet part loud https://t.co/mzj1JPHZH1 \u2014 Good Tweetman (@Goodtweet_man) September 13, 2019\n\nThey can\u2019t help themselves.\n\nWell that\u2019s just laying it right out there in the Mengele spectrum pic.twitter.com/HmZA0A6jnq \u2014 Melissa Johnson (@mlynnjohnson72) September 13, 2019\n\nAbortion is crime against the innocent. And modern day feminism is absolute poison. pic.twitter.com/4a2BoHkJs6 \u2014 Kimberly Ross (@SouthernKeeks) September 13, 2019\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This post has been updated with additional text and tweets.", "description": "liz plank", "authors": ["Sarah D", "Posted At Pm On September", "Sarah D."], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/hagrid-shouldntve-said-that_new.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
