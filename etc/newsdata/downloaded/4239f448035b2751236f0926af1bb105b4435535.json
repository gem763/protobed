During the conversation, Mr. Trump asked Mr. Zelensky to investigate 2020 Democratic presidential front-runner Joseph R. Biden, the former vice president, and his son Hunter.\n\nThe House of Representatives launched a formal impeachment inquiry after the White House tried at first to block the release of a related whistleblower complaint filed by an unknown member of the U.S. intelligence community, but then released its own transcript of the call.\n\nMr. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nAmericans including Mr. Trump have subsequently referred to the country in recent days as \u201cthe Ukraine,\u201d using an outdated construction the nation has tried to drop since the fall of the Soviet Union.\n\n\u201cUkraine is a country,\u201d William Taylor, the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine from 2006 to 2009, told TIME after former President Barack Obama made the same mistake 2014. \u201cThe Ukraine is the way the Russians referred to that part of the country during Soviet times. \u2026 Now that it is a country, a nation, and a recognized state, it is just Ukraine. And it is incorrect to refer to the Ukraine, even though a lot of people do it.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump said Monday on Twitter that \u201cthe President of the Ukraine\u201d said that he did not feel pressured by Mr. Trump during the July phone call. He deleted the tweet minutes later and reposted it without the \u201cthe,\u201d Politico reported.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
