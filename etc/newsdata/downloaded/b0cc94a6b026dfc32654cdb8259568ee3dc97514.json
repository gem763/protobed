The Philippines\u2019 National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) said that she allegedly tried to \u201cconceal and sneak the baby out\u201d of the country, the BBC reported.\n\nUpon further inspection, they discovered that Talbot had kept the 6-day-old baby inside her carry-on during immigration checks and only took him out when they reached the pre-departure area. She did not possess a flight ticket for the baby and failed to mention him during pre-departure formalities like the security check.\n\nTalbot initially claimed to be the infant\u2019s aunt but there are no documents that prove this, CNN Philippines reported. Authorities later found out that Talbot flew to the Philippines before the baby was born to meet with his mother Maricris Dulap in Davao City on Mindanao island. Talbot then took the baby after he was born and brought him to the capital Manila.\n\nDulap told the Department of Social Welfare and Development that she allegedly met Talbot online and agreed to have her baby adopted. Talbot had an affidavit that declared her intention to adopt the baby but it lacked Dulap\u2019s signature.\n\nAccording to NBC News, Talbot has five children in the United States and no previous criminal record. Apart from human trafficking, she was also charged with child abuse, kidnapping, and serious illegal detention by the Pasay City Prosecutor\u2019s Office. She could face life imprisonment and a fine of up to $96,200. Authorities have notified the U.S. embassy in the Philippines and given a list of lawyers who could potentially represent the suspect.\n\nDulap and the child's biological father have also been charged under a child protection law but the latter remains at large and is still unidentified, reports state.\n\nFind Meera on Twitter and Instagram.", "description": "She has been charged with human trafficking, amongst other things.", "authors": ["Talia Slonim", "Meera Navlakha"], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d72158ae5959e000888ccde/lede/1567758748143-NAIA_Terminal_3_checkin.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.843xh;0xw,0.157xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
