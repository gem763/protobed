In fact, \u201ctrillion has become the new billion,\u201d Faler writes, and suddenly Barack Obama\u2019s massive $787 billion Porkulus bill suddenly \u201cseems quaint\u201d:\n\nVirtually every major candidate has a proposal that would cost a trillion dollars or more, and even those positioning themselves as moderates, like Pete Buttigieg, have multiple trillion-dollar plans. It increasingly looks like an arms race, where a proposal needs a 13-digit price tag to appear bold and plans costing mere billions risk being seen as unserious. Both Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Juli\u00e1n Castro have $10 trillion plans to address climate change. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) would spend about $1.9 trillion to address college tuition costs. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) proposes spending $2.5 trillion to expand tax credits for the poor. \u2026 It\u2019s a big change from not that long ago, when politicians ran away from the T-word \u2014 one reason why Obama\u2019s stimulus package clocked in at $787 billion was because lawmakers didn\u2019t want to cross the trillion-dollar threshold. \u201cPeople don\u2019t seem scared at all now \u2014 in fact, it\u2019s the opposite,\u201d said Marc Goldwein, senior vice president and senior policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. \u201cIt\u2019s a race to see who can one-up each other with the bigger plan.\u201d\n\nFaler writes that the GOP isn\u2019t pure either because the 2017 tax cut \u201ccost\u201d $1.5 trillion. That, however, gets the problem backward, although even that doesn\u2019t let the GOP off the hook anyway. Tax cuts are not \u201cspending\u201d \u2014 they are the opposite of spending. Tax cuts are a means of allowing people to keep their own money rather than have government spend it for them.\n\nIn theory, anyway. In practice, the GOP-controlled Congress and Republican president did almost nothing to slow down spending, which is the actual driver of deficits and debt. That failure to seriously address overspending and massive borrowing to float federal benefits drained whatever residual seriousness was left in budget fight. It turned out that neither party in Washington took it seriously, or at least seriously enough to have a real debate over it.\n\nSince no one takes it seriously any more, suddenly unserious proposals to spend imaginary money have nothing but upsides. If we\u2019re going to go broke, the strategy appears to be, let\u2019s make sure we blow smoke up everyone\u2019s skirts before we do. No one\u2019s demanding to know where the money will come from, so why worry? Happy days are here again, even if the skies above will crash in the end. By that time, we\u2019ll all be dead and it will be our grandkids dealing with the budgetary fallout, so bombs away!\n\nAt this point, the only means left to force Congress to take this seriously is an Article V convention and a balanced-budget amendment imposed by the states. Congress has proven itself incapable of self-discipline when it comes to spending, and the executive branch has been nothing but an enabler under the leadership of both parties. The judiciary can\u2019t enforce a budget discipline that doesn\u2019t exist in the Constitution. It\u2019s time for the states to assert their role in the power-sharing arrangement and fix this problem before Washington drains them of their own resources to feed the budgetary black hole that\u2019s threatening to swallow us whole.", "description": "Trillion is the new billion?", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/dem-debate-july2.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
