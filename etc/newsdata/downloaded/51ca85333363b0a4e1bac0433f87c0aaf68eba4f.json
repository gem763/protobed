You just two minutes ago said they would have to buy in,\u201d Castro shot back. \u201cAre you forgetting what you said just two minutes ago?\u201d\n\nBiden did not actually say people would have to opt in to his plan, as Castro claimed. In fact, he said the opposite.\n\n\u201cAnyone who can\u2019t afford it gets automatically enrolled in the Medicare-type option we have,\u201d Biden said minutes before their exchange.\n\nWhat Castro may have been referring to is a separate comment Biden made, in which he said that anyone who loses his or her job can \u201cautomatically\u2026 buy into this.\u201d\n\nThat line suggested that individuals would have to opt into a Medicare system. But what Biden was referencing was a situation in which someone\u2019s private insurance coverage had come to an end, not that a universe of previously uninsured people would have to take a proactive step in order to enroll in Medicare-like coverage.\n\nCastro\u2019s comments are nevertheless likely to feed lines of attack from Biden\u2019s critics, chiefly those in President Trump\u2019s re-election campaign, that Biden\u2019s age is showing in his occasional gaffes, factual misstatements, and apparent memory lapses.\n\nWithin minutes of the initial comments, Trump allies had already pounced on the exchange late Thursday.\n\nWhile Castro later told reporters he \u201cwasn\u2019t taking a shot at his [Biden\u2019s] age\u201d and that his comments were \u201cabout the health-care policy\u201d and not meant as an \u201cattack\u201d on Biden, fellow 2020 hopeful Cory Booker suggested Castro had good reason to question Biden\u2019s memory.\n\n\u201cThere are moments where you listen to Joe Biden and you just wonder... I don't know,\u201d he told reporters after the debate. \u201cI think there were a lot of moments where a number of us were looking at the stage when he tends to go on sometimes. At one point he\u2019s talking about people in communities like mine listening to record players\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people concerned about Joe Biden\u2019s ability to carry the ball across the end line without fumbling. And Castro had really legitimate concerns about can he be someone in a long grueling campaign that he can get the ball over the line and has every right to call it out,\u201d Booker said.\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGot a tip?
