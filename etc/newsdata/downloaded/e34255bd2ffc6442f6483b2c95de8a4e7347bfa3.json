Well it turns out they\u2019re also listening, and reacting to, the music that we play around them. Maybe take that into consideration before you go blaring Lizzo again for the 40th time this week \u2013 unless, maybe, they like it.\n\nBack in the 70s, a producer named Mort Garson fell in love with a very specific (and really weird) synth called the Moog. They\u2019re a beautiful instrument that seemingly bends sound into the strangest shapes.\n\nOnce he found this new love for the Moog he created the one album that went on to become a cult classic, Plantasia, which is actually music not for humans, but for plants.\n\nWhat made Plantasia so special to the seemingly-inanimate suckers growing in your house, and back garden? Turns out it utilises a lot of wild theories that plants react to sound wavelengths, by using that creativity to be more productive.\n\nSounds like a whole bunch of psuedoscience hooey, huh. We kinda thought so too so PEDESTRIAN.TV spoke with the head researcher for Plant Life Balance, Dr. Dominique Hes from the University of Melbourne, about how exactly plants are effectively listening along to our bad karaoke nights, house parties, and other music-listening sessions, and what it\u2019s doing to them.\n\nREAD MORE An Ode To The Ornamental Pear: The Tree That Absolutely Stinks Of Cum\n\nAccording to Dr. Dom, plants react to the energy that music produces, and the right level of noise has shown to help plants be more productive with overall growth.\n\n\u201cPlants seem to thrive around between 115 and 250Hz,\u201d Dr Dom said.\n\nSo it\u2019s less about the beats per minute (BPM) and more about how the vibrations of the music emulates what is produced in nature.\n\nI definitely just checked what it feels like to listen to a tone between 115 and 250Hz, and it\u2019s like this gentle, low hum. I maybe also scared my cat trying out a tone at 5,000Hz, so don\u2019t make the same mistake as me.\n\nThe thing is, is that that bracket of vibration is pleasant to the human ear as well, so Dr. Dom suggested that if we\u2019re listening to music that we like the sound of, it\u2019s likely that our plant babies are going to enjoy it too.\n\nDr. Dom said research shows that music that manages to mimic other things in the wild \u2013 especially pollinators like bees \u2013 helps release a molecule called ribonucleic acid, which encourages plants to do everything it needs to survive and thrive.\n\nBut like with everything else in nature, plants get exhausted too, so Dr. Dom recommends that you only expose plants to high-frequency music for small periods of time so we don\u2019t stress them out too much through their stomata \u2013 which are essentially the plant\u2019s pores.\n\n\u201cYou want to expose your plant to music for no more than one to three hours a day,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYou can imagine that continually being stimulated to open their stomata, and drawing stuff through, that could have long term effects.\u201d\n\nSo if you\u2019re planning a big house party or something, where the music\u2019s going to be on for hours, maybe shift your plant babies into a quieter room so they can chill out.\n\nNext question, what music actually works best for plants?\n\n\u201cJazz seems to work well,\u201d Dr. Dom said.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t seem to care either way for country music and classical seems to do really well.\u201d\n\nWelp, turns out they simply do not care for Old Town Road, then. Soz Lil Nas X and Billy Ray Cyrus.\n\nIn a study done by You Had Me At Gardening, it seems that classical music resulted in bushier, greener plants with healthier stems, but heavy metal increased the mass of the plant and made its fruit taste better.\n\nBack to Mort Garson, his Moog synth, and Plantasia. For me it held this really warm feeling of nostalgia, but I couldn\u2019t quite place what it made me nostalgic for.\n\nDr. Dom reckons that\u2019s because it lies within that golden, plant-friendly wavelength, which humans love to hear as well, because it\u2019s essentially the vibrations of nature.\n\n\u201cAn Indian research paper called it \u2018Green Music\u2019. It\u2019s music that either mimics, or includes, or is based on natural sounds,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt may not sound like that directly, but the same amplitude frequencies are used to inform the way the music sounds.\u201d\n\nGreen Music, Dr. Dom tell me, is essentially triggering biophilia \u2013 a theory that humans have an innate need to connect with nature, because up until the huge advancements of modern technology, we were out and about, amongst nature and all of its sounds.\n\nSo though the science isn\u2019t quite 100% legit just yet, there\u2019s definitely studies that show that plants are absorbing the sounds around them.\n\nI guess if you\u2019re trying to grow the hell out of some fruit trees in the yard, blast them with some Deafheaven and you\u2019ll end up with a good harvest this year.\n\nPlant Life Balance will also be touring around the country over the next year to help you keep your plant fam in check, so keep an eye out for when it\u2019s cropping up near you.", "description": "PEDESTRIAN.TV spoke with Dr. Dominique Hes from the University of Melbourne about how our plants are listening to our music, and if that's a good thing.", "authors": ["Courtney Fry"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/bobs-burgers-plant-fb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
