Mandatory Credit: Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Golden State Warriors no longer have Kevin Durant and Andre Iguodala, and Klay Thompson is recovering from a torn ACL.\n\nThe Warriors will need sharp-shooting guard Stephen Curry more than ever this season, and coach Steve Kerr said the two-time NBA Most Valuable Player is ready to deliver.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s had an incredible camp. To me, he\u2019s at his peak physically, mentally,\u201d Kerr told reporters Sunday. \u201cHe\u2019s seen every defense that people have thrown at him during his career, and he\u2019s ready to have a great year.\u201d\n\nCurry even saw a box-and-one defense against him in the NBA Finals last season, when the Toronto Raptors took down the two-time defending champs in six games.\n\nCurry, 31, averaged 27.3 points per game last season, his best mark since leading the league at 30.1 points per game in the 2015-16 season. He has led Golden State to three NBA titles in Kerr\u2019s five seasons as head coach.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not looking for anything different than what he\u2019s done for five years,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cWhat he\u2019s done is pretty special.\u201d\n\nKerr added that Curry is \u201ckind of in a sweet spot\u201d in his career, although the re-tooling Warriors might not be, as the Los Angeles Clippers, Los Angeles Lakers and Houston Rockets are among the new favorites in the Western Conference.\n\nCurry had 40 points, six rebounds and six assists in 25 minutes in the team\u2019s second preseason game on Thursday night against the Minnesota Timberwolves. The Warriors have three more preseason games, all against the Lakers, before opening the season Oct. 24 at home against the Clippers.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "The Golden State Warriors no longer have Kevin Durant and Andre Iguodala, and Klay Thompson is recovering from a torn ACL.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440562062&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D033-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
