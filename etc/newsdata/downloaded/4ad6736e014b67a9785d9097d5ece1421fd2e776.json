Planned Parenthood , Justice Thomas argued that Indiana\u2019s law barring abortions sought solely because of the child\u2019s race, sex, diagnosis of Down syndrome, or non-lethal disabilities \u201cpromote[s] a State\u2019s compelling interest in preventing abortion from becoming a tool of modern-day eugenics.\u201d Thomas traced the ugly history of eugenics in this country and documented the enthusiasm of some eugenicists for legalizing abortion. He also argued that \u201cabortion has proved to be a disturbingly effective tool for implementing the discriminatory preferences that undergird eugenics.\u201d In support of that argument, he cited the very high rate of abortion of children diagnosed with Down syndrome, the widespread practice of sex-selective abortions in Asia, and the \u201cconsiderable racial disparity\u201d between abortion rates among blacks and whites in this country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the Atlantic\u2019s website, Adam Cohen, author of the book Imbeciles: The Supreme Court, American Eugenics, and the Sterilization of Carrie Buck, has an essay purporting to criticize Justice Thomas\u2019s use of his book. But Cohen\u2019s essay is just another in the sorry genre of \u201cyou properly cited my work in the course of an argument I don\u2019t agree with.\u201d It turns out that it is Cohen, not Thomas, who fails to fairly present the work of the other.\n\nCohen\u2019s title and subtitle set forth three propositions, none of which his essay supports: \u201cClarence Thomas Knows Nothing of My Work: The justice used my book to tie abortion to eugenics. But his rendition of the history is incorrect.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy my count, Thomas cites Cohen\u2019s book for a dozen or so propositions, none of which \u201ctie abortion to eugenics\u201d: for the coinage of the term eugenics; for the role that inheritance plays in eugenic understanding of abilities; for the foundation of eugenics in social Darwinism; for the \u201c\u2018intellectual craze\u2019\u201d that eugenics had become in the 1920s, \u201cparticularly among progressives, professionals, and intellectual elites\u201d; for the \u201cprominent positions\u201d that eugenicists held in major universities; for the role of eugenic arguments in support of the Immigration Act of 1924; for the supposed qualities of dysgenic individuals; and for the marriage bars and forced-sterilization laws adopted by states.\n\nCohen does not take issue with any of Thomas\u2019s actual citations of his book.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCohen instead contends that Thomas \u201crelied on a kind of historical guilt-by-association,\u201d supposedly \u201csuggest[ing]\u201d that \u201cabortion is inseparable from America\u2019s history of eugenics. He further contends that Thomas \u201ccited real history that is not particularly relevant to abortion.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Cohen badly misrepresents the history that Thomas provides. By Thomas\u2019s account, \u201cMany eugenicists \u2026 supported legalizing abortion\u201d in order to prevent \u201cunfit\u201d people \u201cfrom being born in the first place,\u201d and \u201cabortion advocates\u2014including future Planned Parenthood President Alan Guttmacher\u2014endorsed the use of abortion for eugenic reasons.\u201d (Slip op. at 3.) He documents that some eugenicists \u201cwere enthusiastic\u201d about the possibility of using abortion as a method of eugenics and \u201cbelieved that abortion should be legal for the very purpose of promoting eugenics.\u201d (Slip op. at 13; see id. at 13-15.) Cohen does not even acknowledge, much less dispute, this history in Thomas\u2019s opinion.\n\nThe only point on which Cohen actually disagrees with Thomas is semantic: over whether voluntary abortion has the potential to become (in Thomas\u2019s words) \u201ca tool of eugenic manipulation.\u201d As Cohen puts it, a woman \u201cwho has an abortion because the child will be born with a severe disability is not acting eugenically\u2014she is not trying to uplift the human race.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCohen\u2019s semantic objection is worthy of consideration. But that consideration ought to include Thomas\u2019s weighty evidence (e.g., Down syndrome abortions) that individual abortion decisions can collectively have a eugenic impact\u2014that they can \u201cbe a disturbingly effective tool for implementing the discriminatory preferences that undergird eugenics.\u201d But Cohen doesn\u2019t even inform his readers of Thomas\u2019s evidence or of what he is actually arguing. Further, there is plenty of room to interpose here the usual progressive concern about whether such individual decisions are subject to subtle biases and coercion. (Yes, there is a flipping of the usual left-right valence here. In the context, say, of the racial composition of schools, those on the left typically refer to racially imbalanced schools as segregated even when the racial imbalance results from voluntary choices of parents, and those on the right typically reject that label.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn sum, Justice Thomas made proper use of Cohen\u2019s book, but Cohen failed to present his readers an accurate account of Thomas\u2019s opinion.", "description": "On the Atlantic\u2019s website, Adam Cohen, author of the book Imbeciles: The Supreme Court, American Eugenics, and the Sterilization of Carrie Buck, has an essay purporting to criticize Justice Thomas\u2019s use of his book.
