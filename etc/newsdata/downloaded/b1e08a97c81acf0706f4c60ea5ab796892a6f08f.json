Photo: Screenshot via Fox News\n\nRudy Giuliani, who\u2019s spent the last two weeks on a mind-bending media blitz, added another wild TV appearance to the list Tuesday night. On Laura Ingraham\u2019s Fox News show, President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer threatened to sue Congressional Democrats for investigating Trump and the whistle-blower complaint related to his July phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president.\n\n\u201cI had a couple of talks with civil rights lawyers and a constitutional lawyer today and here\u2019s what they\u2019re recommending: That we should bring a lawsuit on behalf of the president and several of the people in the administration, maybe even myself as a lawyer, against members of the Congress individually, for violating constitutional rights, violating civil rights,\u201d Giuliani told a clearly confused Ingraham. He went on to accuse Congressional Democrats of violating Trump\u2019s constitutional right to conduct U.S. foreign policy.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re calling foreign leaders,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are going to foreign capitals.\u201d\n\nWhen Ingraham reminded Giuliani that members of Congress cannot be sued for things they say on the House floor, he insisted that they can be sued for a \u201cconspiracy to violate civil rights,\u201d provided it happened off the House floor. Neither mentioned the pesky tradition of checks and balances that gives Congress the authority to conduct oversight of the executive branch.\n\nGiuliani, whose hopeless devotion to Trump continues in the face of private ridicule from the commander-in-chief, also suggested suing Congress for \u201ctrying to violate attorney-client privilege.\u201d And for launching a \u201ctotally illicit impeachment proceeding.\u201d And, in an unexpected twist for the guy representing Trump, for obstructing justice.\n\nAt one point, Ingraham attempted to steer the conversation to more comfortable ground and began smearing the media for being \u201caggressively incurious about Hunter Biden and Joe Biden.\u201d Giuliani interrupted her: \u201cCan we go back to my lawsuit?\u201d\n\nHe wasn\u2019t even done after going off the air. Late Tuesday, The Atlantic\u2019s White House correspondent, Elaina Plott, tweeted a text exchange with Giuliani in which he said he was looking at a \u201cjaw suit to end lawless action.\u201d Who does he plan to sue? \u201cThe swamp.\u201d\n\nRudy Giuliani says he is looking to sue The Swamp. pic.twitter.com/3D65Mg6VaO \u2014 Elaina Plott (@elainaplott) October 2, 2019", "description": "Rudy Giuliani, President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, said Tuesday he\u2019s considering a lawsuit against Democrats for investigating the president.", "authors": ["Adam K.
