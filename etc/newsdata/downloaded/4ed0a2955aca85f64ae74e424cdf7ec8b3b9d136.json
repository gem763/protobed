Quicken Loans and its Rocket Mortgage brand, which advertises mortgage approvals in as little as eight minutes, has steadily gained share after the financial crisis, becoming the biggest U.S. residential mortgage lender in 2017.\n\nUsing Blend's technology, U.S. Bank had previously shortened the preapproval process to under 30 minutes, according to Tom Wind, executive vice president of consumer lending. Now, as one of the first users of Blend's one tap, that process has been condensed to about three minutes, Wind said.\n\nBlend's software uses what your financial institution already knows about you \u2014 your income and assets held at the lender \u2014 to almost immediately calculate how big a loan you can afford, according to a demo provided to CNBC.\n\nAfter scrolling through a few options on the bank's mobile app or website, like the type of residence and the term of the loan, a preapproval letter takes just a few clicks to generate. That could give prospective buyers an edge when home shopping.\n\nThe product takes innovations in online shopping to the world of mortgages, Ghamsari said.\n\n\"It'd be weird if I went to Amazon and I had to apply to see a list of products that I could afford,\" he said. \"This is bringing paradigms from other industries into this industry. There's no form to fill out, we're bringing all the pieces needed to get it to work for mortgages, which was extremely complicated and a ton of work to do.\"\n\nBlend, which has 170 banks and credit unions as clients including giants like Wells Fargo, was founded in 2012 and is backed by investors including Andreessen Horowitz and Greylock Partners.", "description": "Banks have historically used armies of mortgage brokers to gather income and asset documents from prospective borrowers.", "authors": ["Hugh Son"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105731928-1569012229912preview.jpg?v=1569012237", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
