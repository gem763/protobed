REUTERS/Piroschka van de Wouw\n\nHELSINKI (Reuters) - Britain will have to propose a candidate for a commissioner in the next European Commission if it still is a member of the European Union after October 31, incoming Commission head Ursula von der Leyen said on Thursday.\n\nThe outgoing EU executive of Jean-Claude Juncker is supposed to end its five-year term on Oct 31, although a delay of one month is almost certain because the new Commission is still missing commissioners from France, Hungary and Romania.\n\nUnder EU law, each of the EU\u2019s 28 countries, including Britain, has to propose one commissioner.\n\n\u201cWe have to move forward step by step. First of all it was the question of granting an extension, which looks really good,\u201d Von der Leyen told reporters during her visit to Helsinki.\n\nBritain asked last week for an extension of the Oct 31 deadline for its exit from the EU until Jan 31, 2020.\n\nFinnish Prime Minister Ante Rinne, also present, said a large majority, \u201cmaybe all\u201d EU countries were in favour of granting an extension. The length of it, however, was not yet decided.\n\n\u201cThen the second question that has to be resolved is the length of this extension.... indeed, if after the 1st of November - and there are still steps to take, so that is not a given - there might be an extension and the UK will still be in the EU, then of course I would ask the UK to send a Commissioner,\u201d von der Leyen said.", "description": "Britain will have to propose a candidate for a commissioner in the next European Commission if it still is a member of the European Union after October 31, incoming Commission head Ursula von der Leyen said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444439425&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N0OJ", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
