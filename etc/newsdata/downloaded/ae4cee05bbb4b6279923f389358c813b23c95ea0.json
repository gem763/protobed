His war chest of slightly less than $9 million was dwarfed by Warren with $25.7 million and her fellow progressive Sen.

They had shown Biden lagging behind Sanders, Warren and Buttigieg.\n\nBiden\u2019s unimpressive fundraising numbers play into an existing narrative about his campaign \u2014 that it is not exciting grassroots Democrats.\n\nStories about his campaign\u2019s spending don\u2019t help either. A Wednesday report from the Daily Beast noted that Biden\u2019s campaign had spent almost $1 million on private jets during the third quarter.\n\nDemocratic insiders say Biden now has real problems.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have the dough, it\u2019s hard to go,\u201d said New York-based Democratic strategist Hank Sheinkopf, citing an old election adage. \u201cThe fact that the others are collecting more money, more quickly, tells you that some traditional Democratic donors are not convinced he\u2019s the guy.\u201d\n\nThe Hill reported earlier this month on unease in the donor community about Biden\u2019s candidacy.\n\nDespite the concerns raised by the latest figures, Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield told reporters after the Tuesday debate that the vice president\u2019s team had no shortage of resources.\n\n\u201cWe are 100 percent confident that we have what we need to run our race,\u201d she said, according to Time.\n\nBut Biden\u2019s candidacy has been built on the idea that he is the most electable candidate. He is also seen in some quarters as the favored choice within the party establishment.\n\nBut other candidates in the recent past \u2014 most notably then-Sen. Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonGOP warns Graham letter to Pelosi on impeachment could 'backfire' Hillary Clinton praises former administration officials who testified before House as 'gutsy women' Third-quarter fundraising sets Sanders, Warren, Buttigieg apart MORE (D-N.Y.) in 2008 \u2014 have tried and failed to win the party nomination from a similar position.\n\nBiden\u2019s critics on the left of the party are adamant that his weaknesses are becoming ever more plain.\n\n\u201cHow does anybody credibly maintain that he could excite voters to come out in the droves that we need and can go toe-to-toe with Donald Trump Donald John TrumpGOP congressman slams Trump over report that U.S. bombed former anti-ISIS coalition headquarters US to restore 'targeted assistance' to Central American countries after migration deal Trump says lawmakers should censure Schiff MORE?\u201d said progressive activist Jonathan Tasini, who supports Sanders. \u201cThat argument is close to dead.\u201d\n\nAnother progressive, Rebecca Katz, contrasted Biden\u2019s performance at the debate and in fundraising with that of Sanders, who was vigorous in the debate despite having suffered a heart attack about two weeks previously.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been about as bad a 24 hours for Biden as it has been a good 24 hours for Bernie,\u201d Katz said.\n\nSanders received another boost during the debate when news broke that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Alexandria Ocasio-CortezOcasio-Cortez, Thunberg, Rapinoe make BBC's 100 most inspiring women of 2019 Former Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey endorses Biden Democratic strategist on Sanders debate performance: 'I just think he might've topped out' MORE (D-N.Y.) would endorse him at a rally on Saturday in Queens, N.Y.\n\nWhen Biden\u2019s campaign announced the endorsement of former Sen. Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.) the following day, it was hard to ignore the contrast.\n\nKerrey left the Senate in 2001 and is best known nationally for having unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination in 1992, 27 years ago. When Kerrey abandoned his presidential bid in March 1992, Ocasio-Cortez was 2 years old.\n\nBiden also faces challenges from Buttigieg and other candidates who are competing for centrist voters.\n\nButtigieg had a good debate on Tuesday. He has had problems translating media attention and strong fundraising into good polling numbers but that could conceivably change if Biden continues to falter.\n\nTo be sure, the former vice president has been underestimated before. He has led some recent national polls, even as Warren has surpassed him in others. Biden\u2019s strength among African American voters is also a formidable asset \u2014 if it endures.\n\nBut there\u2019s no question he faces a hard fight just to prevent further erosion of his position.\n\n\u201cThe lagging fundraising numbers reflect how there was a veneer of invincibility that has now gone,\u201d said Democratic strategist Joel Payne.\n\nThe Memo is a reported column by Niall Stanage, primarily focused on Donald Trump\u2019s presidency.", "description": "Former Vice President Joe Biden is looking more vulnerable than ever in his quest for the Democratic presidential nomination after another indifferent debate performance and the release of mediocre financial numbers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/bidenjoe_101519gety_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
