On the 23rd of September it was reported that a 12-year-old girl from Malappuram, Kerala was allegedly sexually abused by her father\u2019s friend and was sexually abused by 30 people. These are just a couple of headlines of the horrific and spine chilling incidents of sexual assault and abuse against children in our country. The assault meted out in both these cases, one of which involved the child\u2019s very own father show the extent of the brutality which is meted out against the most vulnerable class of citizens \u2013 our children. It is the duty and obligation of society to care and nurture them.\n\nOn the 19th of July, during the monsoon session of the Parliament, I had raised this matter in the Rajya Sabha as well during the Zero hour and had expressed my anguish over the repeated and frequent cases of rapes against minors. Several colleagues in the Rajya Sabha associated themselves with my submission in the house.\n\nChildren, under the age of 18, contribute to 37% of India\u2019s population with large proportions experiencing great deprivations such as lack of access to basic education, nutrition or health care. In addition, they are susceptible to different forms of adverse childhood experiences including various forms of abuse, neglect, and maltreatment.\n\nSexual offences and crimes against children are the worst and most horrific forms of cruelty, especially when perpetrated by adults, because it violates basic trust and humanity. Such crimes deserve the harshest of punishments. There must be no show of leniency where acts of violence involve women and children. Such cases must be heard in an expedited manner by POCSO courts and only then can we grant the victim and the family a modicum of justice for such horrendous acts.\n\nOver the past five years the Narendra Modi government has taken incremental steps in dealing with the issue of child sexual abuse including passing the POCSO amendment act which prescribes death penalty for child rape.\n\nHowever it also needs to be ensured that all the main institutions involved in implementing these changes like the law enforcement, the judiciary, hospitals etc also reinforced in terms of capacity augmentation, sensitisation. Our judiciary is overburdened; convictions in cases of child sexual abuse are abysmally low due to faulty forensics, delays in investigation etc. Very often, forensic evidence and other evidence needed is not presented in court in a proper manner which leads to poor conviction rates.\n\nThe latest National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data released show a distressing trend when it comes to crimes against children. Crimes against children under IPC and Special and Local Laws (SLL) increased across India \u2013 from 94,172 in 2015 to 1,06,958 in 2016, and 1,29,032 in 2017. The overcall rate of crime against children in India in 2017 was 28.9 per one lakh children, as compared to 24 in 2016. NCRB officials, however, viewed the rising trend in such cases as an effect of enhanced awareness due to which more number of people have started reporting about such cases, a phenomena that is effect of the Narendra Modi government\u2019s extensive work on this issue.\n\nEven if we look back between January 1 and June 30, 24,212 FIRs were filed on child rape according to data collated by the Supreme Court and only 911 were dealt with. The hon\u2019ble Supreme Court had also taken a notice of the pendency on cases in this regard. Of the 24,212 FIRs 11,981 cases were still under investigation by the police and final reports have been filed in 12,231 cases then. The court\u2019s data also showed that 17 states and Union Territories were yet to dispose of any case. Uttar Pradesh, with 3457 FIRs (the highest among states), had disposed 22 cases only.\n\nIn the monsoon session, I had raised a parliamentary question on the status if the Nirbhaya Fund and its spending. In response to the question, minister for women and child development submitted that the Central government has proposed to set up 1,023 fast-track special courts from the Nirbhaya fund for expeditious trial of over 1.66 lakh pending cases of crime against women and children across the country. Additionally in her reply to the debate on the POCSO bill, the minister said that about Rs 75 lakh would be spent in creating infrastructure for each court. This is an encouraging move and will help address the issue of pendency of such cases and also help in relieving some burden on our justice system. This government in the last five years has made an effort to utilise this fund which was constituted in 2013 by the Congress government but spent nothing out of it.\n\nThe government must create a culture of zero tolerance towards crimes against women and children and repeat offenders. Create a strong robust system to deal with these issues, including capacity augmentation of the police infrastructure, dedicated cells to deal with crimes against children, sensitisation of children in schools, among other things. Creating a supportive and enabling environment for a victim to report the crime; effective and meaningful victim and witness protection; a victim-sensitive criminal justice system, including courts, legal aid and police; rehabilitation and certainty of conviction of accused are areas that will generate deterrence against such heinous crimes. As a society we must also do our bit by being vigilant and being alert chowkidars to root out this evil and prevent the predators from preying on our young ones.\n\nChildren are our most vulnerable class of citizen and also the most important. It is important that they be protected from evils like child sexual abuse and the perpetrators are meted out the justice they deserve. Every child deserves a fulfilling childhood which is nourishing, joyful and uplifting. I urge the government to continue in its endeavours to make India safe for children and women.", "description": "Early this year, a six year old girl was brutally assaulted and raped by a 24 year old in the our national capital New Delhi.
