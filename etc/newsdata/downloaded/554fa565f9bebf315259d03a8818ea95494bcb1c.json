The research estimates that London\u2019s cocaine market has a street value of \u00a31 billion.\n\nWhat researchers found was that unlike cocaine-users in Continental Europe, Londoners are significant weekday users of the drug. Dr Leon Barron, a forensic scientist at King\u2019s College London, told the broadcaster there was only a slight rise from the weekdays to the weekend, \u201cso cocaine is an everyday drug in London\u201d.\n\nIn October, Prime Minister Boris Johnson blamed the \u201cbourgeoisie\u201d middle classes for fuelling the drug trade, where dealers often coerce minors into dealing drugs for them through \u201cCounty Lines\u201d crime, which is in turn leading to a rise in knife crime.\n\nCounty Lines networks are based in cities, with dealers sending teens to the suburbs and smaller towns to sell drugs. The drug-dealing networks are named for the mobile phone \u201cdeal lines\u201d that users call to make orders.\n\nThe prime minister said: \u201cWe are committed to rolling up the evil County Lines drugs gangs. The evil County Lines drugs gangs which predate on young kids and send them to die in the streets to feed the cocaine habits of the bourgeoisie.\u201d\n\nAlbanian Gangsters Linked to South American Cartels Taking Over British Drug Scene https://t.co/cviZnY1AK4 \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 11, 2018\n\nWhile London has a massive cocaine problem, the British capital is not the biggest cocaine-consuming city in Europe \u2014 or even the United Kingdom, per head of population.\n\nThe south-western city of Bristol was recently found to be one of the top destinations for young drug dealers coming from London, and in March the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction named Bristol as the cocaine capital of Europe \u2014 and the King\u2019s College research supports that assertion.\n\nThe study put Bristol as having more users of cocaine per head of population than 74 other European cities analysed.\n\nIn December 2018, Bristol Crown Court found four drug dealers from London and Bristol guilty of murdering a rival. Korie Hassan, 26, Leon Eaton, 37, Jordan Parker, 23, and Yonis Diblawe, 24, were jailed for life for stabbing Yasin Ahmed, 21, to death.\n\nFollowing the murder, police recovered bladed weapons including so-called \u201czombie knives\u201d and a machete.\n\nTony Saggers, the former chief of drugs threat at the National Crime Agency (NCA), told Sky News: \u201cI would say London has got to the point of saturation.\n\n\u201cThe demand has gone up, the price has stayed stable, people are able to lay their hands on it freely, readily\u2026 but I would say, yeah, the other cities are catching up.\u201d\n\nCounty Lines Drug Dealing Networks Triple, Fuel Rise in London Crime https://t.co/uE7xTYF9oa \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 30, 2019", "description": "London has a cocaine problem bigger than that of Europe's next three largest cocaine-consuming cities combined, according to a study.", "authors": ["Victoria Friedman"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Cocaine-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
