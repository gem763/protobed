Very nice,\u201d said Tsitsipas, when asked how it felt to finally beat the 19th-ranked Auger-Aliassime. \u201cI did things differently this time, but I prefer not to say what I did differently,\u201d he added with a smile.\n\nFifth-seeded Alexander Zverev also advanced to the Round of 16 with a 7-6 (13), 7-6 (3) win over French qualifier Jeremy Chardy.\n\nZverev, who served 21 aces, saved three set points in the first-set tiebreaker. He won that tiebreaker on his sixth set point.\n\n\u201cIt was a great tiebreaker obviously,\u201d Zverev said. \u201cWe both served incredibly well and didn\u2019t hit a lot of second serves \u2026 Against Jeremy I always knew it was going to be tough especially on a surface like that, which is lightning fast. I think it\u2019s the fastest surface on tour.\u201d\n\nChardy has now lost 11 consecutive matches against top 10 opponents dating back to when he defeated then fourth-ranked Grigor Dimitrov of Bulgaria at the 2018 Miami Masters.\n\nThe 16th-seeded John Isner was the only one of three Americans, beating Lucas Pouille of France 7-5, 6-3.\n\nTaylor Fritz fell to seventh-seeded Karen Khachanov of Russia 6-2, 6-4, and Reilly Opelka lost to eighth-seeded Robert Bautista Agut of Spain 6-4, 7-5.\n\nDefending champion Novak Djokovic and fourth-seeded Dominic Thiem were in action later Wednesday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Tennis: https://www.apnews.com/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Sixth-seeded Stefanos Tsitsipas beat Felix Auger-Aliassime 7-6 (3), 7-6 (3) in the Shanghai Masters second round on Wednesday for the Greek's first win in six attempts over his Canadian opponent.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Sandra Harwitt"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/09/china_tennis_shanghai_masters_23838_c0-209-5000-3124_s1770x1032.jpg?d90e3d455f0268dece892f6c8cc4108909694c0b", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
