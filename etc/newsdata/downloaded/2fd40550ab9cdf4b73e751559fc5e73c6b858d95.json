John Bel Edwards (D) is headed to a runoff with Republican businessman Eddie Rispone after failing to secure at least 50 percent of the vote which would have given him the victory in Saturday's all party primary. Edwards did receive a plurality, taking in 47 percent of the vote, but it wasn't enough. Rispone beat out fellow Republican candidate, Rep. Ralph Abraham (D-La.), 27 percent to 24 percent, earning a head-to-head contest with Edwards on Nov. 16. The runoff is expected to be tightly contested \u2014 Edwards held significant leads over both Rispone and Abraham in most polls, but the two Republicans garnered more than half the vote Saturday, so a lot will depend on which direction Abraham's supporters head. Edwards is considered a conservative Democrat and holds an anti-abortion stance.

Despite the fallout, many people were well-prepared for Hagibis, and the damage reportedly could have been much worse without the proper planning. Transport services in the typhoon-affected areas are reportedly returning to normal after a near total shutdown Saturday.
