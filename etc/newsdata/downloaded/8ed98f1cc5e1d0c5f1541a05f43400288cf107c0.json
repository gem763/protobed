I don\u2019t understand what central banks expect from those interest rate cuts. In the end, it\u2019s simply a currency war. It becomes more pointless the longer it takes.\u201d\n\nDe Planta also said that while Pictet makes money from charging clients fees for its services, commercial banks faced a \u201cdangerous\u201d situation. \u201cIn an environment of permanently negative rates, savings banks and commercial banks lose the reason for their existence.\u201d\n\nSwitzerland has the world\u2019s lowest benchmark policy rate at -0.75%. Last week, SNB Governing Board Member Andrea Maechler said the central bank\u2019s ultra-loose monetary policy is vital because of the high value of the Swiss franc. If the European Central Bank cuts interest rates on September 12, the SNB is expected to follow with its own reduction at the next policy meeting on September 19.", "description": "Swiss Negative Rate at \u2018Pain Threshold\u2019, Pictet Chief Tells FAZ", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic110a2d18430805293f30a8c1b534d570.jpg"}
