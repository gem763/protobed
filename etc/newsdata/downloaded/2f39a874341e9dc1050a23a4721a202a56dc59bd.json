And we are going to decide the same.\n\n\"The best first 11 possible to achieve our target to win on Sunday and also adapt to that difficulty of playing Bournemouth. And carry on our way, that is the same in each match.\u201d\n\nOne player who did feature against Standard Liege and made a considerable impact was 18-year-old summer signing Gabriel Martinelli.\n\nThe Brazilian started up front and hit two in the space of three minutes to set the Gunners up for a comfortable evening at the Emirates.\n\nDespite featuring as a striker in both of his Arsenal appearances so far, Emery insisted that the teenager is naturally a winger, but praised him for his display despite being out of position.\n\n\"He prefers to play as a left winger \u2013 striker is not the best position for him,\u201d Emery continued.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cBut the first thing in his mind is to help us. Tonight his performance and his attitude was amazing. If he continues training with that hunger, I think he is going to do well.\u201d\n\nMartinelli made his debut against Nottingham Forest in the Carabao Cup and scored twice on that night as well in a comfortable 5-0 win for Arsenal.", "description": "The Gunners boss left his top earner out for the second game running against Standard Liege and believes those selected are more worthy", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/hoWd3YbrN7TbNm6NdhWxXg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2J7iGs7_bqoYNCfNpHBn4w--~B/aD0xNjg4O3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/uk.goal.com/b392ec9fd9f1d607b8b7fd67b0e2cc1c", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
