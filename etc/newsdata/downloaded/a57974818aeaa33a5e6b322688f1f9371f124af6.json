But will they take off with the general public?\n\nSartorial asymmetry is a tricky needle to thread. For every deliberately uneven Comme des Gar\u00e7ons showstopper, there is the one-shoulder Topshop number you forked out an ill-advised tenner for in a moment of sale-induced delusion. Thanks to C\u00e9line Dion\u2019s fashion mega-reach, there could be more iffy purchases in the offing. The singer stepped out of a shiny black suburban at the last Paris Fashion Week in a pair of Ksenia Schaider\u2019s asymmetrical blue jeans, and they have now hit the shelves. For about \u00a3400, you too can wow the world with one leg skinny and the other wide. Would you, though? We took to the streets at lunchtime to gauge the opinion of the general public (including some fashion students).\n\n\n\nJanys Lomax, retired, 70\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Janys Lomax Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian\n\nI quite like classic things, and this is not it. I\u2019m very particular about jeans: they have to fit really well; straight, not skinny, high waisted, good length, not rolled up. I think these are terrible. Also, it depends how old you are, but wouldn\u2019t I trip on that length, on the wide side? Styling wouldn\u2019t make much of a difference. They\u2019re just wrong to begin with. What\u2019s the point?\n\nViktor Hartmann, menswear student, Central St Martins, 19\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Viktor Hartmann. Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian\n\nThe whole split-trouser thing has just been overdone. Usually it\u2019s with different colours \u2013 and that\u2019s all over fashion week at the moment. If you look at just the wide side, that\u2019s a cool pair of jeans. But the other side is really not.\n\nTosin Ojumu, market researcher, 39\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tosin Ojumu. Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian\n\nNot a fan. I think they look awful. I mean, why? WHY? I don\u2019t understand why it can\u2019t be one or the other. But then, you appreciate that different people have different tastes, and some might wear it and you might think: \u201cOh that actually looks better than expected \u2026\u201d But no, not for me.\n\nAlba Mas, womenswear student, Central St Martins, 20\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Alba Mas. Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian\n\nI like the wide leg side way more than the skinny side, because I\u2019m not the biggest fan of tight trousers, but honestly, I feel like they\u2019re not much more than a funny idea. I don\u2019t like them. Something\u2019s off about them. They\u2019re confusing, but not in a \u201cwhat\u2019s that?\u201d kind of way, more in a \u201cwhy?\u201d kind of way.\n\nEloise Piper, business owner and fitness instructor, 32\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Eloise Piper and Penelope. Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian\n\nI\u2019m not one for fashion, as you can tell \u2013 I\u2019m in my gym kit most days. I think they\u2019re lovely, if you\u2019ve got very long legs and a small waist. I\u2019m not sure I could pull them off. I think it works, but it\u2019s just not my style.\n\nJeffrey Lyons, company director, 55\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jeffrey Lyons. Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian\n\nI couldn\u2019t imagine wearing something like that. They look very interesting. I mean, they don\u2019t strike me as something I would do, or something I would give a second thought to, to be frank. But if they make the wearer happy, then I\u2019m all for it.", "description": "C\u00e9line Dion has done her bit to popularise perhaps the last word in outr\u00e9 legwear.
