However handguns, rifles and Tasers are kept in their vehicles and can be used with a supervisor\u2019s permission.\n\nSerious crime is relatively unusual in New Zealand although frontline police were armed for several weeks following the massacre by a suspected white supremacist at two mosques in Christchurch on 15 March.\n\nThe attack sparked a debate on whether all police should carry firearms.\n\nChristchurch attack: New Zealand tries new tactic to disrupt online extremism Read more\n\n\u201cFollowing the events of March 15 in Christchurch our operating environment has changed,\u201d said Mike Bush, the police commissioner.\n\n\u201cPolice must ensure our people are equipped and enabled to perform their roles safely and to ensure our communities are, and feel, safe. This means having the right people with the right tools, skills and knowledge ready to respond at all times,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Armed Response Teams will be rolled out in Manukau county in Auckland, New Zealand\u2019s largest city, and Waikato and Canterbury on 28 October for a six-month trial.\n\nThey will be routinely armed, equipped, mobile and ready to support frontline police officers at incidents that require enhanced tactical capabilities, Bush said.\n\nHe said there was no immediate threat.\n\nThe Australian national Brenton Tarrant has been charged over the attack in Christchurch, New Zealand\u2019s worst peacetime shooting. Tarrant has pleaded not guilty to 92 charges against him and faces trial in May.\n\nThreat levels have been heightened around the country since the Christchurch attack and 1,400 firearms have been seized from offenders since March.\n\nChristchurch shootings: 'real issues' not being heard by inquiry, critics say Read more\n\nThe police minister Stuart Nash said the move did not mean police would be armed routinely. \u201cThe three areas have been selected for the trial because of the incidence of crimes involving armed offenders,\u201d Nash said.\n\n\u201cPolice turn up to some callouts with no knowledge of what they are walking into. Every month police turn up to 200 incidents where a firearm is involved.\u201d\n\nNew Zealanders must have a gun licence to own a firearm. There are an estimated 1.5m guns in the country.\n\nThe government banned military-style semi-automatic and other high-calibre guns within weeks of the Christchurch shooting and also introduced a gun amnesty scheme. More than 29,000 firearms have been collected so far, according to statistics provided on the police website.", "description": "Move comes seven months after 51 people were killed at two mosques in the country\u2019s worst peacetime shooting", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/905f340ac527693c9bbf6243564e841d73133402/0_65_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=aa8f5636b9e70d0b8c05ef3b24293af4", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
