But the prize committee disagreed.\n\nIt chose Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who put in place a peace process to finally end a 20-year conflict with neighboring Eritrea.\n\nBut the Washington Post reported Thunberg\u2019s cause may not be the right vehicle for a peace prize, and then tried to make the case that it should be. According to the report:\n\nHenrik Urdal, the head of the Peace Research Institute of Oslo, omitted Thunberg from the Nobel Peace Prize shortlist he publishes. He explained his decision to the Washington Post, saying there \u201cisn\u2019t scientific consensus that there is a linear relationship between climate change \u2014 or resource scarcity, more broadly \u2014 and armed conflict.\u201d The link between climate change and conflict is hotly debated. But climate change scholars say that while there isn\u2019t a straightforward relationship, there is a recognition that climate change adds to stresses in regions that could spark political instability and conditions that could foster conflict. The Pentagon has called climate change a \u201cthreat multiplier.\u201d The prize has gone to environmental champions before. In 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and former vice president Al Gore won \u201cfor their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change.\u201d In 2004, it was given to Wangari Maathai \u201cfor her contribution to sustainable development, democracy and peace.\u201d In 1970, it went to Norman Borlaug, sometimes called the \u201cfather of the green revolution.\u201d\n\nUrdal told the Post that those awards could be a thing of the past because of what Alfred Nobel hoped the prize would represent.\n\n\u201cIn his will outlining the prize, Nobel wrote that the recipient should be someone who has advanced the \u2018abolition or reduction of standing armies\u2019 \u2014 which some have interpreted as requiring a direct connection to peace and conflict,\u201d the Post reported.\n\n\u201cIf you make it too broad, it becomes a bit meaningless,\u201d Urdal said.\n\nThe Post then checked in with a politics professor at the University of Oslo, who called Thunberg a \u201cwild card\u201d nominee.\n\n\u201cThe link between climate change and conflict is still \u2018quite tenuous at this point,\u2019 she said in the Post report. \u201cEveryone sees flooding can cause conflict, migration and so on, but this is no way well established as a security policy issue yet.\u201d\n\nThe Post also speculated that it could have been poor timing for Thunberg since the committee puts together its shortlist of nominees at the end of January \u2014 before the teen made a splash with her transatlantic sail from Europe to New York on a solar-powered racing yacht and her fiery speech at the United Nations calling out adults for failing to address climate change.\n\nOn Friday when the announcement was made Thunberg was in Denver with other teens who skipped school to protest climate change.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter", "description": "Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teen who has become the global face of the youth climate change movement, didn't win the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize.", "authors": ["Penny Starr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/GettyImages-1175295765-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
