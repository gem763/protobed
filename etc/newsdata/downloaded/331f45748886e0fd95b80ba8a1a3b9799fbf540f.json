Support for impeaching President Trump and removing him from office jumped 10 points over the week between the polls. Things were moving.\n\nThe pollsters released a new assessment Wednesday that showed support for impeachment and removal of Trump at a new high. Forty-eight percent of respondents now favor removing Trump from office, and 55 percent approve of the impeachment inquiry itself.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat\u2019s missing in that story, though, is what happened in the polls between the first one after the inquiry and the new one. Support for impeaching and removing Trump is at a high, yes \u2014 but that support is basically equivalent to where it\u2019s been since there was that 10-point jump.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that polls include a margin of sampling error, a statistical assessment of how accurate the results are. When you see a poll showing support for something at 50 percent with a margin of error of three percentage points, for example, the actual support could range from 47 to 53 percent. So if you see two polls in a row with margins of error at three percentage points where one shows 48 percent support and the other 52 percent support, it\u2019s possible that support jumped four points \u2014 or it\u2019s possible that it didn\u2019t change at all. That change, with that margin of error, is not statistically significant.\n\nHere\u2019s an interactive example. The tool below will generate random poll results measuring a steady 50 percent level of approval but including a margin of error determined by the drop-down. (It\u2019s set at three percentage points; Quinnipiac\u2019s latest poll has a margin of 3.1 points.) You can see how the results shift from poll to poll \u2014 even though the underlying opinion doesn\u2019t.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMargin of error: 0.5 points 1 point 2 points 3 points 4 points 5 points GENERATE POLLS\n\nAgain: In each of the polls above, the actual approval was 50 percent.\n\nIn the five polls Quinnipiac has conducted since late September, support for impeaching and removing Trump has gone from 37 percent to 47 percent, then to 45 percent, to 46 percent and, now, 48 percent. That first jump was significant. The other changes? Not.\n\nQuinnipiac started polling on the inquiry only after it was announced by Pelosi. In its results, the percentage of people who approve of the inquiry has been 52 percent, 53 percent, 51 percent and 55 percent. In other words, it might not have changed at all.\n\nLet\u2019s go a bit deeper. Here are the shifts in support for impeachment/removal and for the inquiry over the pasts month of Quinnipiac polling, broken out by demographic. Notice that the vertical axes for the top six charts are different.\n\nThe numbers next to each line show the change since the first post-inquiry poll. In most cases, those changes are subtle. Even in the cases where the shifts are large \u2014 the seven-point jump in support for impeachment and removal among independents, for example \u2014 all is not as it seems. The smaller the group of people polled, the larger the margin of error and, therefore, the larger the reported swings even if attitudes have not shifted that much. It\u2019s also possible that the independent responses in this poll are an outlier; the big jump since the last poll may be a one-off result.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere are, though, some interesting things to consider in the above data. Overall, the average gap between support for impeachment and removal and approval of the inquiry is about six points across the four polls this month. We can think of that gap as the group of skeptical observers, those not ready to say Trump is guilty but who support investigating his actions. Among Democrats, the average is about the same as the overall average. Among Republicans, though, it\u2019s lower \u2014 about three points. And among independents, it\u2019s higher, about nine points.\n\nWhat Quinnipiac has shown, though, is one of the less exciting results in polling: Things haven\u2019t changed much since the inquiry began. That\u2019s not unique to Quinnipiac\u2019s polls, mind you. Other pollsters have also shown things settling down a bit after an initial surge.\n\nThen the eternal caveat: so far. Quinnipiac\u2019s most recent survey was in the field from Oct. 17 to Oct. 21, meaning before this week\u2019s new revelations about Trump\u2019s behavior regarding Ukraine. Quinnipiac\u2019s polling over the last month has also shown that news events can and do affect how people view impeachment. What we\u2019ve learned in the past 24 hours may be demonstrations of that point.\n\nWe just have to wait and see.\n\nAD", "description": "A look at a new poll from Quinnipiac University.", "authors": ["Philip Bump", "National Correspondent Focused Largely On The Numbers Behind Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/V7waKj1s4grCqb7vetG_VPWeUVM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NBJTJYXSY4I6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
