alternatively, a better-than-expected result would support the Rand and EM FX.\n\nJudging from trade and inflation data the outlook does not particularly favour a bullish surprise in GDP.\n\nTrade data showed a bigger China trade surplus in September which on the face of it is positive, however, look under the bonnet and you will find gross trade actually fell.\n\novershot expectations and hit 3.0% which is the PBoC target, again, on the face of it a positive outlook, however, this was almost entirely due to massive inflation in pork - a Chinese dietary stable - due to shortages, and not as a result of increased general demand from greater prosperity.\n\nOriginal post", "description": "Forex Analysis by Joaquin Monfort covering: USD/ZAR, GBP/ZAR.
