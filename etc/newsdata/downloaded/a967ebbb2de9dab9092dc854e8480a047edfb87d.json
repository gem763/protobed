Nazanin Tabatabaee/WANA (West Asia News Agency) via REUTERS\n\nIran\u2019s ambassador to Britain, Hamid Baeidinejad, said on Monday that the vessel was free to depart after legal hurdles were cleared and this was confirmed by Mohammad Rastad, head of Iran\u2019s Ports and Maritime Organization.\n\n\u201cThe detention order on Stena Impero had been lifted and the vessel is going through proceedings to leave Bandar Abbas port,\u201d Rastad was quoted as saying by the semi-official news agency ILNA.\n\nStena Bulk Chief Executive Erik Hanell said the tanker was still in Iran.\n\n\u201cDespite public statements by Iranian authorities over the past three days that judicial proceedings have concluded, and the Stena Impero is free to leave Iran, the vessel remains detained at anchor in Bandar Abbas,\u201d Hanell said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe continue to work hard to secure the release of the crew and vessel.\u201d\n\nIran\u2019s seizure of the Stena Impero on July 19 for alleged marine violations, two weeks after Britain detained an Iranian tanker off Gibraltar, ratcheted up tensions in the region following attacks on other merchant vessels which Washington blamed on Tehran. The Iranian vessel was released in August.\n\nIran has denied responsibility for those attacks, which took place along a vital international oil shipping route.\n\nRelations between the United States, its allies and Iran have become more strained since Washington withdrew last year from a global pact to rein in Tehran\u2019s nuclear programme and imposed sanctions on the country that were aimed at shutting down Iranian oil exports.\n\nAsked about accusations that Iran had taken the British tanker hostage, Rastad said: \u201cThere is no hostage-taking. According to the law, the ship was detained because of violations, and... the rules are to first impose a detention order and then investigate the violations and issue a ruling,\u201d ILNA reported.\n\nRastad said the tanker had posted \u201cguarantees and a bail\u201d before having its detention order lifted because it still faced unspecified charges over its alleged violations, the semi-official news agency ISNA reported.", "description": "The British-flagged tanker Stena Impero detained by Iran in July remains in that country even though it has been legally cleared to leave, the tanker's Swedish owner Stena Bulk said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433265611&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N0K4", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
