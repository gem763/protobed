Yes, even without Drew Brees (thumb surgery), the Saints are formidable, as they proved in winning at Seattle last weekend.\n\nSo we should find out a whole bunch about the teams from Big D and the Big Easy in a juicy prime-time matchup.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re playing awfully well right now,\u201d Saints coach Sean Payton says of the Cowboys, stressing the offensive output. \u201cWe just went through the numbers. Third down, they\u2019re No. 1 in the league, defensively they\u2019re second in the league.\n\n\u201cEach category - big play, yards per play, they\u2019re running it well, the quarterback\u2019s playing well. I think that their design, their talent, all of those things. You can\u2019t help but notice the quarterback (Dak Prescott) and the success he\u2019s having. That\u2019s nothing new for him. He\u2019s been successful. But, when you see the combination of running backs (Ezekiel Elliott, rookie Tony Pollard) and I think just the right amount of veteran presence from a (Randall) Cobb and a (Jason) Witten, a few of those guys, (Travis) Frederick the center is back, that\u2019s very important.\u201d\n\nThis could be an important game in the overall NFC playoff scheme, particularly if Teddy Bridgewater remains effective at quarterback until Brees is healthy.\n\nThe weekend began Thursday night with Philadelphia\u2019s 34-27 victory at Green Bay. Nigel Bradham picked off Aaron Rodgers\u2019 pass in the end zone with 20 seconds left, Jordan Howard had his second career three-touchdown game and the Eagles (2-2) ended a two-game losing streak with\n\nHoward finished with 15 carries for 87 yards with two touchdowns rushing and one receiving, Carson Wentz went 16 for 27 for 160 yards, three scores and no turnovers.\n\nRodgers was 34 for 53 for 422 yards, two touchdowns and a fumble that set up a short Philadelphia scoring drive. Davante Adams had a career-high 180 yards on 10 catches, but he wasn\u2019t on the field for the Packers (3-1) on the last drive because of a toe injury.\n\nOff this week are the Jets (0-3) and 49ers (3-0).\n\nMinnesota (2-1) at Chicago (2-1)\n\nWith the NFC North shaping up as the league\u2019s strongest sector, every matchup in the division will be critical, whether in September or December.\n\nMinnesota has not fared well in Chicago, going 3-15 there since 2000. But the Vikings have split the past four trips, and they come in with the NFL\u2019s best run game, led by the healthy and revitalized Dalvin Cook . That\u2019s all part of the plan: stout defense and time-consuming effective runs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of our head coach\u2019s identity. That comes with the old-school rules,\u201d Cook said after topping 100 yards rushing for the third straight game in Minnesota\u2019s 34-14 victory over Oakland. \u201cWe know the type of defense we\u2019ve got.\u201d\n\nThey also know what kind of D the Bears have: fierce.\n\nNew England (3-0) at Buffalo (3-0)\n\nThe numbers say don\u2019t expect this \u201cshowdown\u201d for the AFC East lead to be close. New England has won five straight and is 33-5 against the Bills since 2000. Tom Brady\u2019s 30 career wins against Buffalo are the most by an NFL quarterback against one opponent. And, get this, Brady\u2019s 15 wins at the Bills rank fourth among all quarterbacks, four shy of Drew Bledsoe, who had four wins with the Patriots and 14 with the Bills.\n\nNew England also is playing some stellar defense, though it must be considered that its opponents are 0-9 this season.\n\nThen again, Buffalo\u2019s opposition has a 1-8 mark.\n\nA big day for Frank Gore could push him over 15,000 yards rushing. He needs 88 for the Bills.\n\nKansas City (3-0) at Detroit (2-0-1)\n\nHere\u2019s comes the Mahomes Maserati to the Motor City as the Chiefs seek their third straight 4-0 start. They have scored 25-plus points in an NFL-record 25 consecutive games, and Patrick Mahomes has an NFL-record 13 300-yard passing games in his first 20 starts.\n\n\u201cHe is competitive and he is the leader of that bunch,\u201d says coach Andy Reid, who will spend his 100th regular-season game on the Kansas City sideline Sunday. \u201cHe\u2019s the one that\u2019s on the field. He wants certain things out of a play. Then as a player, you have to get those things done. That\u2019s where my trust in him and the other coaches\u2019 trust in him comes in.\u201d\n\nDetroit\u2019s defense has come alive and could provide a real test for the 2018 NFL MVP.\n\nCleveland (1-2) at Baltimore (2-1)\n\nA huge game for Cleveland, which has not lived up to the hype yet, but can claim a tie atop the AFC North with a key road win. Of course, the Browns are 3-19 vs. Baltimore since 2007. Plus, four of their next five are on the road.\n\n\u201cI think it is something that you really have to be conscious of because you are surrounded by an environment where you hear a lot of things, stuff pops up on your phone and stuff is on the TV,\u201d quarterback Baker Mayfield says of the criticism being hurled at his team. \u201cIt is just people talking. You just have to make a conscious decision to protect your locker room, take care of your guys and block out the negative stuff. When they are patting you on the back, to me that is even worse.\u201d\n\nMayfield has thrown at least one TD pass in all 16 career starts. Only Hall of Famer Kurt Warner (24) had a better opening run. And DE Myles Garrett has six sacks this season.\n\nThe Ravens, 66-23 at home under coach John Harbaugh, including 18-2 in September, played pretty well despite losing at Kansas City. With the other two division foes, Pittsburgh and Cincinnati, both winless, the Ravens could take a strong early lead in the division with a win.\n\nOakland (1-2) at Indianapolis (2-1)\n\nThe Raiders basically are road warriors for six weeks, not a comforting thought considering they are 1-8 under Jon Gruden as visitors. They\u2019re not keeping things close, having lost back-to-back games in the same season by 18 or more points for the first time since 2012.\n\nAdding to their woes: Indianapolis has won seven in a row at Lucas Oil Stadium.\n\nA very telling set of statistics shows that Oakland allowed eight touchdown drives of 90 or more yards in the past two seasons, including three in the past two weeks. The Colts had two scoring drives of 90-plus yards just last week in a victory over the Falcons.\n\nLos Angeles Chargers (1-2) at Miami (0-3)\n\nWay back in 1981, when the Chargers were in San Diego and the Dolphins were a real team, these two played a classic postseason game. Chargers tight end Kellen Winslow probably cemented his Hall of Fame credentials with his performance.\n\nThe Chargers have lost eight consecutive games in Miami, with the previous win being that 1981 AFC divisional playoff game in overtime. They are angry coming off two straight defeats despite a well-oiled offense.\n\nMiami\u2019s longest run is 9 yards. Fifteen NFL quarterbacks have a longer run this season, including Philip Rivers. Yes, Old Man Rivers.\n\nCarolina (1-2) at Houston (2-1)\n\nMaybe even more encouraging than the play of fill-in QB Kyle Allen was Carolina tying a franchise record with eight sacks last week. DE Mario Addison tied a career high with three sacks and outstanding LB Luke Kuechly had 10 tackles at Arizona. He leads the NFL with 36 tackles.\n\nAllen starts again for Cam Newton (foot) after throwing for 261 yards and four TDs in his second career start. Christian McCaffrey had 153 yards rushing and a touchdown last week, with his 76-yard scoring run vs. the Cardinals the longest rushing touchdown in franchise history.\n\nYet, in this matchup, it\u2019s Houston coming off the more impressive road success. The Texans came back to beat the Chargers, got five sacks of Rivers, and Deshaun Watson was unstoppable: season-best 351 yards passing with three touchdowns and no interceptions. LB Whitney Mercilus had a sack and forced fumble and now has a sack in three straight games and has forced three fumbles and picked off a pass this season.\n\nTennessee (1-2) at Atlanta (1-2)\n\nTwo of the more disappointing teams so far. Atlanta can\u2019t run the ball and the Titans can\u2019t throw it with any efficiency. Tennessee has allowed 17 sacks, most in the NFL, including nine a week ago.\n\nOne thing Tennessee is doing right is forcing turnovers (plus-4), while the Falcons are minus-3.\n\nFor Atlanta to win this one, it must have a better start. The Falcons have been outscored 47-13 in the first half in three games, including 41-3 in their losses.\n\nSeattle (2-1) at Arizona (0-2-1)\n\nArizona has been a desert oasis for the Seahawks, who haven\u2019t lost there since 2012. Seattle, often considered a home power but not so much in away games, is 29-19-1 in its past 49 road games.\n\nThe Cardinals will spend the season hoping top overall draft choice Kyler Murray shows lots of progress, and watching Larry Fitzgerald make his case for the Hall of Fame, which probably already is a slam dunk. The wideout needs five catches to pass Tony Gonzalez for second on the NFL\u2019s career receptions list.\n\nTampa Bay (1-2) at Los Angeles Rams (3-0)\n\nThe Rams have won five straight over Tampa Bay since 2012, and the Bucs are a deeply flawed squad. But LB Shaquil Barrett leads the NFL with eight sacks in four games. Since sacks became an official stat in 1982, the NFL record through a team\u2019s first four games is nine.\n\nLA also must find a way to cover Mike Evans, who\u2019s coming off the first three-TD receiving game by a Tampa Bay wideout since 1985.\n\nOf course, the Rams are unbeaten, looking for a second straight 4-0 start under coach Sean McVay; they opened 8-0 last season. With games against Seattle and San Francisco upcoming, the Rams need to stay focused on the Bucs.\n\nJacksonville (1-2) at Denver (0-3)\n\nThe Jags showed some life with their dismantling of the Titans in their previous game, with rookie Gardner Minshew sparking them with his completion rate (73.9 percent) and passer rating (110.6). Both are the highest by a rookie QB in his first three career games in the Super Bowl era. His main target, DJ Chark, is one of five receivers in NFL with at least four 30-yard catches and has a TD catch in each of the first three games.\n\nNot many bright spots in Denver right now. Somehow, a defense that should be top five in the league and has a head coach, Vic Fangio, who has been a successful defensive coordinator for decades, has not managed a sack or a takeaway.\n\nWashington (0-3) at New York Giants (1-2)\n\nThis has the makings of a shootout. The Giants have yielded an NFC-most 94 points, tied with - yep - the Redskins. Both teams got torched in the secondary last week, and although they each can get pressure on passers, there\u2019s not a lot of stinginess to go around.\n\nSixth overall draft choice Daniel Jones makes his second start in place of the benched Eli Manning, and he was sensational down the stretch in beating Tampa Bay. Washington coach Jay Gruden, on an ever-hotter seat, has been holding off starting his first-round pick, Dwayne Haskins, at quarterback.\n\nCincinnati (0-3) at Pittsburgh (0-3)\n\nWelcome to Monday night losing football.\n\nESPN likes having the Steelers in prime time because of their national following. Having the winless Steelers, well, that might not attract such a big audience.\n\nThe Bengals have dropped eight straight vs. Pittsburgh and 11 of 12. They are 6-15 in prime-time games since 2011, when Andy Dalton was a rookie, including 2-5 on Monday night. Cincinnati is 11-24 on Monday nights, while the Steelers are 46-24 on Monday night, 25-5 at home.\n\nSo even without Ben Roethlisberger (elbow surgery), it\u2019s hard to envision the Steelers flopping in this spotlight.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "With the Dallas Cowboys at 3-0, their fans are beginning to see America's Team as a team of destiny.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Barry Wilner"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/27/nfl_this_week_football_49885_c0-246-3555-2318_s1770x1032.jpg?d3c541df7af8769051f13bc766d9dc9b04a10164", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
