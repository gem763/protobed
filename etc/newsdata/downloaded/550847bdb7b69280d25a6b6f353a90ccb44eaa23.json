MUST WATCH Naomi Osaka's CNN quickfire challenge 01:35\n\nCan Naomi Osaka finish on a high?\n\nFor a few months in the middle of the year, it looked as if playing tennis was a burden for Osaka. The Japanese superstar had parted ways with her coach, Sascha Bajin, shortly after winning her second consecutive grand slam title at the Australian Open and climbing to the No. 1 spot.\n\nShe struggled with the elevated status and heightened expectation and tough losses followed at Roland-Garros and Wimbledon. In August, Osaka told reporters: \"I probably haven't had fun playing tennis since Australia.\"\n\nBut the 21-year-old regained her confidence during the Asian swing, winning back-to-back titles in Osaka, Japan and Beijing last month, and she is one of the favorites to clinch her first WTA Finals crown.\n\nThis is the richest title in tennis\n\nWith a total of $14 million on offer -- double the 2018 prize pot - there has never been a richer event in tennis, for women or men.\n\nIf anyone goes through the entire event unbeaten, they will take home $4.725 million, which is almost $1 million more than Canada's Andreescu earned for winning the US Open in September. Even winning one round-robin match means a guaranteed $305,000 on top of a participation fee of $385,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd-of-year No.1?\n\nBarty became the first Australian woman to win the French Open since Grand Slam record holder Margaret Court in 1973 when she triumphed in Paris back in June. If she manages to win this week, she'll become the first Aussie to take the season-ending finals since her compatriot Evonne Goolagong, her hero, won the WTA Finals in 1974 and 1976.\n\nBarty was also the first women's No. 1 from Australia since Goolagong in 1976. And if she wins one of her first two round-robin matches, or plays all three, she will take the coveted end-of-year No. 1 crown.\n\nCan Andreescu pull off another upset?\n\nFrom her stunning win in Indian Wells in March to her even more impressive US Open triumph -- which came after a long injury break -- the 19-year-old Andreescu has shown that she loves the big stage.\n\nAlthough Osaka ended her 17-match win streak in the quarterfinals of the China Open in Beijing in September, the young Canadian is more than capable of pulling off another huge upset, provided she is fully fit.", "description": "CNN Sport takes a closer look at the first WTA Finals in Shenzhen, China, where the eight top singles and doubles players will be competing for a record $14 million prize money pot.", "authors": ["Danielle Rossingh", "For Cnn"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191004113926-naomi-osaka-02-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
