Rand Paul engaged in a heated debate Friday about using socialism as a fearmongering tactic.\n\nMs. Navarro \u2014 who identifies as Republican \u2014 mentioned how she lives among \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of Venezuela exiles in Miami and asked the Kentucky Republican why the GOP uses the country as an example of the dangers of socialism.\n\n\u201cYou talk about Venezuela in your new book,\u201d she noted, adding, \u201cI get a lot of political ads from the Republican Party. Donald Trump has tweeted this. Many have tweeted this. If you vote for Democrats, they will turn the United States into Venezuela. Do you think that\u2019s a fair statement to make?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, if you vote for a socialist, you might get socialism,\u201d Mr. Paul replied.\n\nMs. Navarro replied: \u201cCome on. Don\u2019t do that. [Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s] Maduro is not a socialist. He\u2019s a corrupt, murderous thug who is starving his people.\u201d\n\nWhen Mr. Paul said, \u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d Ms. Navarro responded, \u201cOh really? Maduro is not a thug? And a murderer?\u201d\n\nAfter several attempts to answer while being interrupted by Ms. Navarro, Mr. Paul asked for her to let him finish.\n\n\u201cNo, I can\u2019t let you finish if you\u2019re not going to say Maduro is a murderous thug,\u201d she said, with cheers from the audience. \u201cDon\u2019t mansplain me!\u201d\n\nCo-host Whoopi Goldberg then went to a commercial before Mr. Paul could respond.\n\nThe senator tweeted afterward: \u201c[email protected] was shouting over my answer - which was Maduro\u2019s violence and thuggery is made possible by the centralized power of his socialist government. @TheView should let guests answer!\u201d\n\nMr. Paul was on the show promoting his new book \u201cThe Case Against Socialism.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
