Harris.\u201d\n\nWarren has also earned the endorsements of two of the five members of Netflix\u2019s \u201cQueer Eye.\u201d Last month, Jonathan Van Ness said he decided to support the senator because she championed Medicare-for-all.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so excited to be shoulder to shoulder with you too.
