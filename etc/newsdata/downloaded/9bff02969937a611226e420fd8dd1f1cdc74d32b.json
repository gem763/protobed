He said Shopify ( SHOP ) will deliver when you need it. The stock has made an impressive rise this year but can the technical picture sustain those advances?\n\nLet's check the charts.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of SHOP, below, we can see that prices based in the September-January period around the $140 area were followed by a beautiful textbook-looking uptrend to the $400 area.\n\nThe rising 50-day moving average line did an excellent job of getting you long and keeping you long. The 200-day line has a positive slope but intersects down around $240 so we could easily say that prices were extended when compared to the 200-day moving average.\n\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line shows a rise into August and then some weakness or non-confirmation. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator has just crossed to the downside for a take profits sell signal.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of SHOP, below, we can see a more impressive rise than with the daily chart (above). An eight-fold rise in three years. Prices are well above the rising 40-week moving average line.\n\nThe weekly OBV line has made a new high to confirm the price gains this year.\n\nThe 12-week price momentum study in the bottom panel shows a slowing in the pace of acceleration. This is a heads up to watch the price action closer.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of SHOP, below, we can see that the software is projecting a downside price target of $335.\n\nBottom line strategy: From my early years of following the commodity markets I have grown sensitive to look for potential reversal patterns like a close below the low of the high day (or week). Short term traders might want to be more cautious if SHOP closes below $370.", "description": "Let's check the charts....SHOP", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Shopify Has Made A Tremendous Rally But Don'T Take It For Granted", "Let'S Check The Charts.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Eric Jhonsa", "James", "Rev Shark", "Doug Kass", "Kevin Curran", "Carolyn Boroden"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/af0b6438-8de4-11e9-9035-314ef9218cce.png", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
