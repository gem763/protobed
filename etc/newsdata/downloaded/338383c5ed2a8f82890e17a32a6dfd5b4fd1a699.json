The cost of eradicating rhododendron from Snowdonia National Park has been about \u00a345m.\n\nThis is why MPs are urging the government to set up a rapid-response emergency fund to enable agencies to tackle a threat before it becomes out of control.\n\nWith British wildlife under more threat than ever before, reducing the introduction of invasive species is another way we can help stop the worrying decline of our native species.", "description": "Footloose species are cruising around the planet and setting up homes in new and distant lands.\u00a0Parakeets now soar over British cities, grass carp swim in our rivers and grey squirrels have taken over our forests.", "authors": ["Phoebe Weston"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/24/19/istock-1023487192.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
