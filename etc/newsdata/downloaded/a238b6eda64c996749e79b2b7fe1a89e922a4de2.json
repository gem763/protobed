France come off mixed performances in victories Argentina and the USA, and will be aiming to put on a convincing, bonus-point victory over the men from the Pacific Islands today.\n\nTonga, meanwhile, are yet to win a game at this World Cup so far. A 35-3 defeat to England's hands and last weekend's 28-12 loss to Argentina may have garnered Tonga little in the way of points, but gradual improvement across the two games could prelude a real challenge for the French today.\n\nToday's clash marks the sixth occasion since 1995 the two sides have met, with the French claiming three wins to date, and Tonga two.\n\nBoth teams remain relatively strong, unhampered by injury so far this tournament with Tonga hoping star fullback and Leicester Tigers man Telusa Veianu can confuse and confound the French defence. In the blue corner, France have named a third different half-back pairing for today's game, seeing fan favourite scrum-half Antoine Dupont dropped to the bench in favour of Baptiste Serin in the nine jersey, while the young Romain Ntamack returns to the all-important ten jersey after arriving from the bench during the 33-9 victory over the USA this Wednesday.\n\nCommenting on France's four-day turnaround this week, Tonga assistant coach Pita Alatini said: \"It's tough for them, I'm glad we didn't have to work out how to best deal with that. But they are a Tier One, we will find out if they can handle it.\"\n\nA win today for the French gives them the chance to top Pool D, and earn an easier path through the quarter-finals, should they beat a powerful looking English side this time next week. Lose, and they stand the risk of allowing Argentina the chance to claim the second spot in the pool, knocking the French out of the tournament at the pool stages.", "description": "France's Fijian-born, try-scoring sensation of a winger Alivereti Raka could be a man to set Kumamoto alight today with a devastating attacking display.", "authors": ["Ali Stokes", "Sir Ian Mcgeechan", "Michael Davison", "Paul Hayward", "Daniel Schofield", "Jonathan Kaplan"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/rugby-world-cup/2019/10/06/TELEMMGLPICT000212166119-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
