Goalkeeper Zack Steffen put a palm up to block Davies\u2019 shot but the ball still dropped over the line as Canada\u2019s players rushed to join Davies for a raucous celebration.\n\nCavallini added a 90th-minute for 75th-ranked Canada, taking long pass and beating Steffen to the near post with a low shot.\n\nGoal @CanadaSoccerEN \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6!
