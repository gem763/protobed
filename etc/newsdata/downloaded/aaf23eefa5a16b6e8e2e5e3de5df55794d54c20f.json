Sign up here.\n\nChinese oil imports from ship-to-ship transfers surged last month as flows from some traditional suppliers were crimped by the White House\u2019s aggressive trade and foreign policies.\n\nSome 910,000 tons of crude, three times as much as in August, was offloaded at Chinese ports after being transferred in the South China Sea, according to ship-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg. It\u2019s unclear where this oil came from, but moving crude from one vessel to another at sea is a common way of disguising the origin of cargoes.\n\nSee also: Going Dark, Fake Voyages: Tactics to Skirt Trade Sanctions\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest crude importer has been struggling to replace lost barrels from Iran and Venezuela, which have been hit by White House sanctions this year. Cargoes from the U.S. also dropped markedly last month, the data show, after Beijing imposed tariffs on American oil for the first time on Sept. 1 as the trade war heated up. Meanwhile, shipments from Malaysia almost tripled.\n\n\u201cI think its highly likely that these ship-to-ship and Malaysian volumes are Iranian or Venezuelan crude,\u201d said Michal Meidan, director of the China Energy Programme at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. \u201cBut of course the whole point here is to make it hard to be sure.\u201d\n\nNo one responded immediately to faxed questions sent to China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce and the General Administration of Customs.\n\nImports from Malaysia rose to 1.385 million tons last month, making it the seventh-biggest supplier to China, up from 16th in August. Much of that oil has also been transferred at sea in the Malacca Strait, a common location for exchanging cargoes. Malaysian domestic production is limited, so it\u2019s likely the increased volumes are coming from other countries and being blended in the Southeast Asian nation, said Liu Yuntao, an analyst at Energy Aspects Ltd.\n\nChinese imports from the U.S. fell 76% to 420,000 tons in September from August. Shipments from Venezuela dropped 55% to 570,000 tons. Cargoes from Iran actually rose 82% to 520,000 tons, but are well below the 3.04 million tons imported in April before waivers from U.S. sanctions expired.\n\nSome of the oil coming from Malaysia may be from Venezuela, according to shipping analytics company Vortexa.\n\n\u201cWe have observed a rise in ship-to-ship transfers of Venezuelan crude near Malaysia\u2019s Tanjung Bruas in recent months headed for China,\u201d said Serena Huang, a Singapore-based senior analyst at Vortexa. \u201cVenezuela\u2019s heavy-sour crude has been part of the staple diet of Chinese independent refiners, and direct exports of the crude have been impeded by the U.S. sanctions.\u201d\n\n(Adds response from Chinese authorities in 5th paragraph.)\n\nTo contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Sarah Chen in Beijing at schen514@bloomberg.net;Ann Koh in Singapore at akoh15@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Serene Cheong at scheong20@bloomberg.net, Andrew Janes, Ben Sharples\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars.
