He had led Ireland to two victories over New Zealand in the four years since the previous World Cup. He\u2019d given them confidence against the two-time defending champions, and Ireland had reached the top ranking in the world going into this tournament.\n\nAnd now this loss in front of 48,656 fans in Tokyo.\n\n\u201cYou carry scars a lot more than your successes,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cAnd those scars are deep.\u201d\n\nThe Irish had won two of their last three tests against the All Blacks, starting with their historic first at Chicago in 2016 and another in Dublin last November.\n\nSchmidt suggested that winning the Rugby World Cup had become Ireland\u2019s No. 1 target and acknowledged there might have been too much pressure on his team from that point.\n\n\u201cAiming up for this tournament\u201d he called it.\n\n\u201cThis is really what we wanted, and this is what is so devastating tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t produce the performance. We wanted to make sure this was our target, and maybe it consumed us a little bit too much.\u201d\n\nSchmidt said falling behind early proved a major problem for his team and regretted allowing New Zealand too many chances - many handed to them by Irish errors.\n\n\u201cHeartbroken wouldn\u2019t be too far away for how I feel and how the players feel,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Ireland has failed again at the knockout stage of the Rugby World Cup.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Stephen Wade"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
