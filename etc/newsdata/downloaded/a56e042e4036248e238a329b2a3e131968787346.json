I haven't been able to release my equity in full, so coming up with a deposit for an investment property hasn't been easy.\"\n\n\"I'm looking at buying more because interest rates are so low and the buying conditions are still pretty good, but the lengthy process of getting finance is off-putting. It's really difficult to get finance for investors like me even though the lenders have started lending more and have reduced rates on interest-only loans.\"\n\nNAB recently cut its interest-only mortgages for property investors by 30 basis points while ANZ and CBA reduced their's by 25 basis points. Westpac cut their variable rate loans by 15 basis points.\n\nSharon Xie, credit manager at Homeloanexperts.com.au said so far investors were slow to take up the lower rates.\n\n\"We haven't seen a big influx of investor loans after the rate cuts,\" she said.\n\n\"Lenders still hold tight lending conditions and we haven't seen big changes in credit policy in favour of investors recently.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCurrently, investors still only account for 25.9 per cent of the total mortgage demand, well down from the record highs of 43 per cent set in 2015 and below the long-term average of one-third of the mortgage demand.\n\nHigher cashflow and capital growth are unlikely to fuel another investor-led housing boom, experts say. Henry Zwartz\n\n\"Investors are interested and many want to buy,\" said Margaret Lomas, founder of Destiny Financial Solutions.\n\n\"We are seeing increased inquiry and this is a good indication that investors want to be active again.\n\n\"But the lowering of the serviceability rate requirement by APRA isn\u2019t enough and it has only added a small amount of borrowing power to each investor. It's not enough to help them to actually buy a property.\"\n\nThe torturous process of getting a mortgage is making it difficult for investors to capitalise on the buying opportunities, Ms Lomas said.\n\n\"Despite lower mortgage rates, lenders are, if anything, making it harder for investors to borrow. Most investors max out their borrowing capacity at two or three properties now.\n\n\"Approvals are now taking months rather than days, and this isn\u2019t conducive to securing a property. The compliance requirements are onerous and many investors just don\u2019t have the time to satisfy them, and this is becoming a huge barrier to entry.\n\n\"Until this eases, most investors cannot invest, even if they have the desire to.\"", "description": "Despite improving conditions and cheaper rates, banks are still being cautious lending to investors.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2043%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_53/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c0c07201fa84d807ada8aa3d2b2b9227b2a98ca8", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
