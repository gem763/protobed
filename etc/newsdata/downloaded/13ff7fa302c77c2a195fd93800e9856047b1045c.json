Since it was late at night, I only had a little time to explore its unsettling world before I had to go to bed. I quit at the game\u2019s first boss fight, intending to play more later. Instead I spent the next several days avoiding the game because I knew I had a boss fight waiting for me when I returned.\n\nI don\u2019t really like boss fights. Some of this is a function of writing about games for a living: When reviewing a game, repeatedly throwing myself at a boss fight takes time that could be better spent moving through a game\u2019s story. I feel clever when I first figure out a boss\u2019 patterns, but I find these fights tedious once I know what to do.\n\nWatching a boss\u2019 health bar slowly tick down reminds me of running on a treadmill at the gym \u2014 there\u2019s nothing to do but repeat the same actions while a counter incrementally moves. I get frustrated if I make progress only to lose it all to a silly mistake or badly-timed button press, which makes me play worse on the next go.\n\nOften I grow too aware of my own gameplay because I don\u2019t want to mess up, which of course makes me mess up. I\u2019m especially annoyed when I have to complete a boss fight to progress, because then there\u2019s nothing to do but try something over and over until I get it right.\n\nUsually I\u2019ll take a break, sometimes quitting the game for the day. When I come back fresh, a boss fight is almost always easy to beat. The trouble with this strategy is it means that when I boot up a game again, the first thing I have to do is a boss fight. It\u2019s not the most pleasant way to regain my bearings, and it\u2019s not too fun to have to start a gameplay session doing something I don\u2019t enjoy.\n\nIn Control, I quit for the night after struggling a bit with the fight against Tomassi, a possessed Bureau staffer who can fly. It\u2019s a very early fight, shortly after Jesse gets the ability to telekinetically throw things.\n\nIt isn\u2019t too tough, but I kept losing track of the guards that filter in or getting too far out of cover attempting to hit Tomassi with debris. I also fumbled with the game\u2019s keyboard controls: On PC, Control defaults your powers to holding and releasing the E key, an awkward placement that impeded my movement. This, plus the time pressure of knowing it was getting later and later, quickly frustrated me, and I gave the boss fight only a few tries before quitting.\n\nHaving a boss fight to deal with the moment I loaded up the game again kept me away from it for several days. How to beat the fight was obvious and fairly simple \u2014 I just didn\u2019t particularly want to do it. Knowing I\u2019d have to start right up with an unpleasant challenge made Control feel like a chore.\n\nMy friends and my Kotaku colleagues raved about the game, which made me ache to play it, but every night for the rest of the week I\u2019d look at it in my game library, remember the boss fight waiting for me, and change my mind. I even thought about restarting the game with a controller, just so I could do something more fun than darting around an arena throwing furniture and looking out for guards while Tomassi\u2019s health bar slowly ticked down.\n\nI loaded up Control this morning, popping into the offices outside the Tomassi fight with dread. I poked into the game\u2019s menu and saw that the game binds your powers to the middle mouse button as well as E. My middle button is a little sticky, so it\u2019s not my favourite binding, but it was a more comfortable and tactical way to play. This made the fight infinitely easier, and I completed it on my second try.\n\nOf course this meant I instantly wanted to keep playing, only to have to get to work instead. I regretted how much of my previous free time I\u2019d spent avoiding Control because I didn\u2019t want to play the boss fight.\n\nTaking a break in a game is usually a good idea when I\u2019m stuck, but I\u2019ve played games long enough to know quitting at a boss fight is only going to keep me away from a game. I don\u2019t know why I keep thinking I\u2019ll wake up as a person who will find boss fights compelling instead of dull.\n\nWhen I get bored or frustrated with a boss fight, I remind myself that it would be better to just dig in and try to complete the fight, or to save and quit when I can sense a boss fight coming so I\u2019ll have something else to do at the start of a play session. But instead I inevitably try a fight a few times and then quit, even though I know I\u2019ll just have to do it later.\n\nI\u2019m looking forward to playing more Control, though I know there will be more boss fights to come. Maybe I\u2019ll take my own advice in the future and quit the game without leaving myself a boss fight. I know myself well enough to doubt this, though. Probably, like when I play boss fights themselves, I\u2019ll keep making the same mistake.", "description": "I finally got a chance to boot up Control a couple days after the game launched.
