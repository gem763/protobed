Reports of abandoned sheep dogs roaming Idaho\u2019s backcountry have dramatically increased in recent years causing concern about how the dogs are being treated by sheep ranchers.\n\nCory\u2019s hoping to make life better for the canines by changing the way the sheep herding industry raises and cares for them. He hopes the new program he\u2019s started at Flat Top\u2019s ranch to better treat the canines will be adopted by sheep ranchers everywhere.\n\n\u201cI have to explain that my program is still in its infancy, but I have these two litters of Pyrenees pups that will signify the first generation of dogs to be fully trained, cared for, microchipped, rabies vaccinated, equipped with GPS collars and tracked,\u201d Cory said. \u201cThere will be a journey for every dog. Each dog will have a name and a story that I can show the public as they continue to work hard and hopefully live a long, healthy life.\u201d\n\nWord of Cory\u2019s plan made its way to Southeast Idaho after well-known Pocatello resident Randy Dixon and his wife encountered what they later learned was likely a Pyrenees sheep herding dog that no longer herded sheep and for whatever reason had abandoned its herd.\n\nDuring a recent camping trip near Trail Creek Summit about 30 miles north of Sun Valley, the Dixons first observed a group of three sheep herding dogs and three herders moving a herd of roughly 200 sheep up a nearby trail.\n\n\u201cAbout 30 minutes later, a guy came driving by in a pickup with another one of these dogs, our dog if you will, in the back and he asked us, \u2018Are there sheep around here?\u2019\u201d Dixon recalled. \u201cI\u2019m sure he knew this herd of 200 or so sheep were in the vicinity. We told him where they were and he said he had found this dog about 2.5 miles south of us. He took the dog up to the herd and 30 minutes later the dog was in our campground for dinner.\u201d\n\nDixon added, \u201cI have to be honest, we fed him, petted him, looked him in the eyes and loved on him. He looked older, but healthy. He looked like he had several months\u2019 worth of burrs and what not stuck to him, but he was friendly.\u201d\n\nThe dog left after dinner but by that point Dixon was curious, so he decided to walk up the trail to locate the herd of sheep and the herders.\n\nHe found the herders, who were Peruvian and spoke broken English. Dixon said that from what he could understand, the dog that visited him and his wife for dinner didn\u2019t like sheep herding anymore.\n\n\u201cI got the impression that the dog was no longer valuable to them,\u201d Randy said.\n\nAround 8 a.m. the next morning, the dog returned to have breakfast with the Dixons before again trotting off into the wilderness.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the Dixons returned to Pocatello that they were confronted with the stark reality involving the sheep herding dog community. Once a sheep herding dog will no longer herd sheep, it\u2019s often euthanized or abandoned by the herders, Dixon said.\n\n\u201cWe found out this is a common practice in the sheep herding industry. These dogs are not pets. Ranchers basically treat these dogs like they are livestock,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cThey have no problem shooting them dead or abandoning them in a field somewhere.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cRanchers typically don\u2019t spend a penny on health. These dogs are not vaccinated, spayed or neutered, and there are large groups of these animals being released in the wild without any way for the ranchers to follow their whereabouts.\u201d\n\nDixon\u2019s research led him to Sun Valley residents Gary Tickner and Tiffany Larson who over several years have rescued four Akbash sheep herding dogs, a breed much like Pyernees with huge bodies and sharp intelligence.\n\nOddly enough, Dixon encountered the wild Pyernees dog on Aug. 20, the same week that Tickner and Larson hosted an event in Ketchum to raise funds for Cory\u2019s program. By way of a raffle fundraiser on Aug. 22 at Hotel Ketchum, Tickner, Larson and dozens of others were able to raise more than $4,000.\n\n\u201cThe elders, (Cory\u2019s) grandparents and everybody before them, always were taught not to touch the puppies,\u201d Tickner said. \u201cThey were taught not to give them human contact or the dogs wouldn\u2019t do their work. But Cory has decided that after all these years, he doesn\u2019t agree with the way guard dogs have been raised.\u201d\n\nTickner continued, \u201cHe wants to show the elders that this can be done differently. The black sheep of the family will resist what their parents and their parents believed in, but a small change like this can have a massive ripple effect.\u201d\n\nAt Flat Top\u2019s ranch, Cory is one of several ranch hands tasked with tending to about 4,000 breeding ewe. With an average herd sitting at around 1,100 sheep and three to five guard dogs per herd, Cory is responsible for several working dogs at any given moment.\n\nEvery dog is around sheep from the moment it\u2019s born, Cory said.\n\n\u201cI house the puppies in a corral in front of my house and they will stay with the group of sheep, safe from the elements and predators,\u201d Cory said. \u201cThey grow up in a controlled environment and learn to behave in proximity to sheep. My belief is that they actually think they are sheep but have canine extincts. They bark when there is a threat and work together, but they stay with the herd.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cThey know that wherever the herd is that is where they will find food and safety. They stay in the corral until they are bigger than a coyote. Depending on the weather and terrain, I will release the dogs in groups of two per (herd) and they will begin working with the herd. Albeit some of these animals make incredible domestic partners, it is in their blood to run with sheep.\u201d\n\nAs a person who has spent his entire life around working sheep dogs, Cory said he knows what has been the historical norm when it comes to raising the canines. But he also said he knows slight changes to the process won\u2019t have a significant impact on a dog\u2019s work ethic.\n\n\u201cThe old rancher stigma is that if you show a litter of puppies any affection when they are born and as they are being raised, then they won\u2019t perform and do their job,\u201d Cory said. \u201cThey would rather hang around the house or find an empathetic owner somewhere. (The old ranchers) actually believe that it ruins the dogs. But as a kid I wouldn\u2019t listen to them. They would bark at me not to touch the dogs, but I would do it anyway. I found those dogs did just fine. I thought my grandparents were full of malarkey.\u201d\n\nContrary to what Dixon said, ranchers never intentionally abandon a sheep dog, Cory said. But because the norm has been to raise the dogs with minimal human interaction, even ranchers who do locate lost sheep dogs have difficulty corralling them because the canines don\u2019t trust people.\n\nAn increase in housing developments in what has been rural farmland for decades in Idaho has only exacerbated the issue of sheep dogs losing their way, Cory said.\n\n\u201cWhen they are so wild, you can\u2019t corral a dog that is emaciated, needs a rabies shot or needs medical attention for an injury,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen they are left behind you need to be able to catch them. That is the trouble with what we are seeing around populated areas. The dogs get distracted, intimidated or confused by traffic or development that seems to be happening more and more. These dogs end up leapfrogging a lot more ground and mileage to get to the sheep. If they don\u2019t have that strong herding instinct they may get left behind. Others might get left if they have been up all night intimidated by predators and fall asleep during the day unaware that the (herd) is moving on. That is how you end up with lost dogs.\u201d\n\nDeveloping a bond with the sheep dogs while they\u2019re young is the first step in reducing the number of dogs that essentially become wild animals once they lose their herd. But being able to find lost dogs in the first place is equally important.\n\nTo track the dogs as they work, Tickner recommended Cory use the same device he used to track one of his dogs, a Garmin Alpha 100 handheld device with a TT15 GPS dog tracking collar. For 20 collars the total cost is roughly $6,500, which Cory said is a price within reason, but the battery life of each collar is only 48 hours, which is not long enough for the amount of time a dog may be lost.\n\nAs of now, the $4,000 raised from the Ketchum fundraiser is sitting in a bank account as Cory attempts to find additional sponsors for his program and GPS tracking collars that will better fit his needs.\n\n\u201cThe Idaho Wolf Coalition and Idaho Humane Society are working for further solutions and further fundraising,\u201d Cory said. \u201cThey suggested I look into the collars that are put on wolves to track their migration patterns. They allow GPS tracking through an iridium satellite network and have a battery life of about two years. The catch is they are $1,500 to $2,500 a piece and I need 20.\u201d\n\nAs he works to secure more funds, Cory is also working to raise awareness of his program, especially in Idaho\u2019s ovine community and among other sheep ranchers. He understands encountering resistance is nearly unavoidable.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not expecting every rancher to empathize or understand,\u201d Cory said. \u201cBut I am somewhere in the middle. It is still absolutely necessary for me as a rancher and for the public to understand that sheep ranching and guard dogs go back thousands and thousands of years and the relationship has been predominantly the same. It\u2019s for a reason, but the reasons are poor.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cI don\u2019t perceive sheep dogs to be just livestock. If they are in poor health and have needs, then I am determined to help them. I\u2019ll be damned not to do the very best for them that I can.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Idaho State Journal, http://www.journalnet.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The grandson of a longtime rancher and former state lawmaker has recently started a program that has in some ways made him the black sheep of Idaho's ovine community, the Idaho State Journal reports.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Shelbie Harris"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
