And the rise of the knowledge society is driving this polarization even farther.\n\nIn a June 2009 study published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, \u201cThreat causes liberals to think like conservatives,\u201d Paul Nail, a professor of psychology at the University of Central Arkansas, and four colleagues found that\n\nLiberals became more conservative following experimentally induced threats. In fact, the threats consistently caused liberals to become as conservative as conservatives chronically were.\n\nIn one test, for example, half of the participants were prompted to think about the threat of death by asking them to describe in writing \u201cthe feelings that the thought of your own death arouses in you\u201d and \u201cWhat do you think will happen physically as you die and once you are dead?\u201d The other half was asked to write about the bland experience of watching television.\n\nThe authors found that the threat of death caused those who previously demonstrated a \u201cliberal openness\u201d to experience shifted \u201ctoward conservative closure.\u201d Similar shifts from left to right occurred under different variations of the threat scenario.\n\nNail and his co-authors wrote that \u201cpolitical conservatism has psychological properties that make it particularly appealing when vulnerability is dispositionally or situationally salient,\u201d before adding: \u201cWe conclude that significant threats always induce a tendency toward conservative social cognition.\u201d\n\nFour other psychologists \u2014 Jaime L. Napier at N.Y.U.- Abu Dhabi; Julie Huang at Stony Brook; Andrew J. Vonasch at the University of Canterbury; and John A. Bargh at Yale \u2014 addressed this question from the opposite direction: What happens to conservatives when the sense of threat or insecurity is decreased?\n\nIn their March 2018 paper, \u201cSuperheroes for change: Physical safety promotes socially (but not economically) progressive attitudes among conservatives,\u201d the four authors conducted a series of experiments including one in which they induced \u201cfeelings of physical safety by having participants imagine that they are endowed with a superpower that rendered them invulnerable to physical harm.\u201d\n\nThe superpower manipulation \u201chad no effect on Democrats\u2019 level of social conservatism,\u201d they wrote, but Republicans \u201creported being significantly less socially conservative in the physical invulnerability condition.\u201d\n\nNapier and her three colleagues used the same superpower manipulation in a second experiment designed to measure liberal and conservative resistance to social change based on responses to two questions: \u201cI would be reluctant to make any large-scale changes to the social order\u201d and \u201cI have a preference for maintaining stability in society, even if there seems to be problems with the current system.\u201d", "description": "And they are headed in different directions \u2014 with serious consequences for the president and his political opponents.", "authors": ["Thomas B.
