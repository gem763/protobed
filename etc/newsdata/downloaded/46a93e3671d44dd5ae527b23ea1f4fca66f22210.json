I talked to the police on the phone.\n\n\"When they arrived they[officers] were all on top of the bridge and they had a small torch while they were looking as it was dark.\n\n\"Then the firefighters turned up with their big lights so we could see better. Everywhere was cordoned off.\n\n\"The lad got taken into the police car - he said he was just 12. Police spoke to me and then said I could go.\n\n(Image: Liverpool Echo)\n\n\"I haven't stopped crying all night.\"\n\nMr Ellison said the boy told him the lads had returned to that section of railway line to retrieve something which they had lost on the track last weekend.\n\nHe said he heard possibly one train go past while James was on the line, and he quickly implored police to cut the electricity off, he added.\n\nHe added: \"I was a nervous wreck. It's tragic, it really is.\"\n\nPolice say they don't believe there aren't any suspicious circumstances involved in the incident.\n\nThey are appealing to anyone who may have seen two young boys in the area around the time of the incident to get in touch.\n\nToday, shocked friends paid tribute to James, describing him as a \"happy-go-lucky lad\" who was the middle of three brothers.\n\n(Image: Liverpool Echo)\n\nOn social media, his older brother posted a picture of his sibling, where many pals spoke of the well-liked Newfield School pupil in Thornton.\n\nAt the scene in Bootle, a little Everton FC teddy bear was pinned to the railings where the tragedy took place.\n\nJust yards from the spot where James was killed, his girlfriend, aged 14, left a floral tribute on the railings , which was brought down by the \"devastated\" girl's mum.\n\nQuoting from the words of a Rhianna song, Diamond, she wrote: \"Shine bright like a diamond.\n\n\"You were the happiest little boy. You will be missed. By your girl.\"\n\nFriends who knew James well described him as an \"amazing lad whose smile would light up the room\".\n\nOne said: \"He was always so polite. He was a bouncy little lad.\"\n\nOne friend told the ECHO: \"I've known James for years, he's one of my little brother's best friends.\n\n\"He was a happy-go-lucky lad, and everyone would look out for him.\n\n\"He was very energetic, and never had any fears in his life.\"\n\n\"I feel for his mum and dad so much, it's shocking.\n\n(Image: LIVERPOOL ECHO)\n\n\"His older brother, is heartbroken.\"\n\nNeighbour Sonia Melton, 33, said her 11-year-old son was friends with the boy who died.\n\nShe said: \"We're in bits, my heart goes out to his mum.\n\n\"He was a lovely kid, they're all lovely kids round here. My son used to play out with him.\"\n\nMs Melton bought red roses and said she would take her son to leave them as a tribute once he was home from school.\n\nOne man, who is close to James' older brother, added: \"James was never scared of anything, but he was a sensible lad, who was doing well in school.\n\n(Image: Liverpool Echo)\n\n\"What's happened is such a shame, something must have crossed his mind [to make him venture onto the tracks].\n\n\"Last night, his brother rang me, crying, and said, I think he's dead.\n\n\"I went to see him, he was in a state...he doesn't know what to do.\n\n\"All I can do is support him and be there for him as much as I can.\n\n\"Something needs to be done about safety on the tracks...he[James] must have jumped over.\n\n\"I've seen kids up at Seaforth jumping on the tracks..why is nothing done to stop them?\n\n\"It's really upsetting.\n\n\"It's heartbreaking, we have lost a good soul.\"\n\n\"He always had a smile on his face and it made us love him even more.\n\n\"Little James, bless him, something must have crossed his mind.\n\n\"He was energetic, and was always in a big group of friends.\"\n\nNetwork Rail, who manage the railway where the tragedy happened, said they had launched an immediate investigation.\n\nPolice probing the death described it as a \"incredibly tragic incident.\"\n\nIn an updated statement, the British Transport Police said: \"We can confirm that a 12-year-old boy sadly died on the railway in Bootle, Merseyside last night.\n\n\"Officers from British Transport Police were called to the lines in Bootle shortly after 7pm last night following reports of a casualty on the tracks.\n\n\"Paramedics from the North West Ambulance service also attended, and a 12-year-old boy from the local area was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.\n\n\"His injuries were consistent with electrocution and the incident is not being treated as suspicious.\n\n\"The boy\u2019s family have been informed and are being supported by specially trained family liaison officers.\"\n\nDetective Chief Inspector Steve Lewis said: \u201cThis is an incredibly tragic incident which I know will have shocked many in the local community.\n\n\u201cI would like to extend my deepest condolences to the boy\u2019s family and request that they are given the space and privacy they need to come to terms with this devastating loss.\n\nIf you can help, text 61016 or call 0800 40 50 40 quoting reference 488 of 14/10/19.", "description": "A friend of James Myers, 12, screamed for help before the youngster died on the railway line in Bootle , Merseyside", "authors": ["Luke Traynor", "Image", "Julian Hamilton Daily Mirror", "Liverpool Echo"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20586051.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_THP_CHP_151019Slug_10945JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
