Investors are often drawn to strong companies with the idea of reinvesting the dividends. If you are hoping to live on your dividends, it's important to be more stringent with your investments than the average punter. Regular readers know we like to apply the same approach to each dividend stock, and we hope you'll find our analysis useful.\n\nA high yield and a long history of paying dividends is an appealing combination for Fiem Industries. It would not be a surprise to discover that many investors buy it for the dividends. Before you buy any stock for its dividend however, you should always remember Warren Buffett's two rules: 1) Don't lose money, and 2) Remember rule #1. We'll run through some checks below to help with this.\n\nClick the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis\n\nNSEI:FIEMIND Historical Dividend Yield, October 21st 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. So we need to form a view on if a company's dividend is sustainable, relative to its net profit after tax. In the last year, Fiem Industries paid out 28% of its profit as dividends. This is a middling range that strikes a nice balance between paying dividends to shareholders, and retaining enough earnings to invest in future growth. One of the risks is that management reinvests the retained capital poorly instead of paying a higher dividend.\n\nIn addition to comparing dividends against profits, we should inspect whether the company generated enough cash to pay its dividend. Fiem Industries's cash payout ratio in the last year was 48%, which suggests dividends were well covered by cash generated by the business. It's positive to see that Fiem Industries's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.\n\nWe update our data on Fiem Industries every 24 hours, so you can always get our latest analysis of its financial health, here.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nBefore buying a stock for its income, we want to see if the dividends have been stable in the past, and if the company has a track record of maintaining its dividend. Fiem Industries has been paying dividends for a long time, but for the purpose of this analysis, we only examine the past 10 years of payments. Its dividend payments have fallen by 20% or more on at least one occasion over the past ten years. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was \u20b92.50 in 2009, compared to \u20b912.00 last year. Dividends per share have grown at approximately 17% per year over this time. The dividends haven't grown at precisely 17% every year, but this is a useful way to average out the historical rate of growth.\n\nIt's not great to see that the payment has been cut in the past. We're generally more wary of companies that have cut their dividend before, as they tend to perform worse in an economic downturn.\n\nDividend Growth Potential\n\nWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share (EPS) are growing. Why take the risk of a dividend getting cut, unless there's a good chance of bigger dividends in future? Earnings have grown at around 6.6% a year for the past five years, which is better than seeing them shrink! It's good to see decent earnings growth and a low payout ratio. Companies with these characteristics often display the fastest dividend growth over the long term - assuming earnings can be maintained, of course.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Could Fiem Industries Limited (NSE:FIEMIND) be an attractive dividend share to own for the long haul?
