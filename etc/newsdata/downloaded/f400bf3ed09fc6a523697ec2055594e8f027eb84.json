So, no, not for me.\u201d\n\nLampard has his own problems to worry about and is still seeking a maiden home Premier League win.\n\nThe Blues have been held to frustrating draws by Leicester and Sheffield United at Stamford Bridge this season before leaders Liverpool left with all three points last weekend.\n\nBrighton, who have not beaten the Blues since 1933 and are winless in the top flight since the opening weekend, are Saturday\u2019s visitors to west London.\n\nOn the poor home form, which includes a Champions League loss to Valencia, Lampard said: \u201cEvery week is important and the fact that we haven\u2019t won at home in the league is something that we obviously want to correct.\n\n\u201cIf we are going to be where we want to be then we are going to need home wins. I thought we were very unlucky last week against Liverpool. But that doesn\u2019t help the point situation.\n\n\u201cWe need a similar performance to Liverpool, because I thought it was very good.\n\n\u201cIf we get that level of performance then I expect the home wins to come very soon.\n\n\u201cWe must respect Brighton hugely because they are playing very well, playing some really good football, new manager, change of style, maybe not the points on the board that they deserve.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t \u2013 just because we haven\u2019t had a home win \u2013 expect that it will come because we\u2019re Chelsea and they\u2019re Brighton.\u201d\n\nLampard used Wednesday\u2019s Carabao Cup clash with Grimsby to select a number of the club\u2019s academy players, while Callum Hudson-Odoi \u2013 fresh from signing a new contract \u2013 made a scoring return from long-term injury.\n\nEngland forward Hudson-Odoi and midweek debutant Reece James will be involved against the Seagulls, although Lampard will be cautious not to rush the former\u2019s return to full fitness following his ruptured Achilles.\n\n\u201cI will be careful with Callum, considering the type of injury he had, that\u2019s not to say he can\u2019t play a major part in tomorrow\u2019s game or a slightly lesser one,\u201d said Lampard.\n\n\u201cI will have to see on its merits with a bit of Callum\u2019s personal injury situation in my mind as well.\u201d\n\nAntonio Rudiger, Emerson Palmieri and Ruben Loftus-Cheek will be absent against Albion because of injury, but Andres Christensen (knee) should be fit to return, while Olivier Giroud (illness) is a doubt.\n\nPA", "description": "Chelsea boss Frank Lampard refused to comment on the situation at former club Derby County following the car crash which left Richard Keogh sidelined for the rest of the season.
