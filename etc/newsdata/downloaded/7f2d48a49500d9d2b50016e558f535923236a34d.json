Today it has come to mean something quite different. Once the United States fought wars to end them. Today it seemingly fights wars to perpetuate them.\n\nTo his credit, Trump has apparently intuited that there\u2019s something amiss here. For this Commander-in-Chief, any war that drags on and on is by definition a failure.\n\nYet few members of the present day national security establishment are inclined to see things that way. They have come to accept long wars as tolerable \u2014 indeed, to appropriate Sen. McConnell\u2019s phrase, as concrete manifestations of \u2018American leadership\u2019. Keeping US forces in Syria, uncomfortably wedged in between Turks, Kurds, the regime of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, and the remnants of Isis, with Russia and Iran lurking in the wings, apparently satisfies this conception of what it means to \u2018lead\u2019.\n\nTrump ain\u2019t buying. Having suckered plenty of others during his career as a highflying real estate developer, he knows a bum deal when he sees one. Yet the problem with Trump \u2014 OK, one of the many problems \u2014 is that he is clueless about how to translate his aversion to endless war into anything akin to a plausible basis for policy. He possesses neither the intellectual capacity nor the attention span needed to devise an approach to \u2018American leadership\u2019 that is not centered on the continuous use or threatened use of force. So while Trump\u2019s anti-war instincts have considerable merit, he is incapable of translating instinct into anything remotely approximating an alternative strategy.", "description": "", "authors": ["Andrew Bacevich", "Spectator.Us Does-Trump-Better-Idea-Endless-Wars"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
