(AP) - For an accomplished, experienced group like the Minnesota Vikings\u2018 defense, maintaining that edge is more of the goal than plowing new ground.\n\nIf there\u2019s unheralded one player still primed for a breakout, though, middle linebacker Eric Kendricks would be the guy. He\u2019s the most prominent member of the defense yet to procure any of those postseason awards, and his performance in 2019 has put him on such a track.\n\n\u201cI always feel like I\u2019m just a little underrated. It is how it\u2019s going to be,\u201d Kendricks said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to be the best person I can be and trying to accomplish things that I\u2019ve never accomplished before.\u201d\n\nThe defense under coach Mike Zimmer has consistently been one of the best in the league, and the Vikings have largely kept up with the standard this season. Their average allowances in yards per play (4.8), yards per game (310.3) and points per game (15.5) rank fifth, fifth and sixth in the NFL, respectively, and they\u2019re tied for eighth in the league with a 50% red zone touchdown rate with seven surrendered to opponents in 14 opportunities.\n\nMore than half of the lineup has played in at least one Pro Bowl: defensive ends Everson Griffen and Danielle Hunter, nose tackle Linval Joseph, outside linebacker Anthony Barr, safety Harrison Smith and cornerback Xavier Rhodes. Another established starter, cornerback Trae Waynes, was a first-round draft pick.\n\nKendricks would love to be the next name on the list.\n\n\u201cI would definitely say it\u2019s on the list of things to do, but it doesn\u2019t take over my motivation or anything like that. It doesn\u2019t consume my thoughts,\u201d Kendricks said. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of an afterthought. I\u2019m just trying to get these wins with this team and do damage and just whatever happens, happens.\u201d\n\nKendricks is fifth in the NFL\u2019s official statistics with 38 solo tackles. He\u2019s tied for seventh with seven passes defended, one of only two linebackers in the top 12 in the league. Vikings coaches have credited him with 61 combined tackles, a whopping 25 more than the next-closest player, Barr. In Minnesota\u2019s 38-20 win over Philadelphia on Sunday, Kendricks teamed with cornerback Mackensie Alexander on a third-down sack early in the fourth quarter to force a punt. A little later, he forced a fumble that Barr recovered to put the game on ice.\n\n\u201cI was into it, and I was running around,\u201d Kendricks said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to force things, but I was finding the ball, and in the same breath, now that I watch the film, there\u2019s definitely things that I could\u2019ve done to put our team in better positions at times.\u201d\n\nThe coaching staff would concur with that.\n\nEarly in the second quarter, when Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz rolled out to his left on third-and-6, Kendricks let his man, wide receiver Nelson Agholor, slip behind him as he drifted forward. Leaping to bat the pass was his only play, and that\u2019s what he did, nearly intercepting the ball after whirling around to try to find it.\n\nRunning back Miles Sanders also caught a 32-yard touchdown pass on a wheel route out of the backfield that left Kendricks flat-footed in the second quarter.\n\n\u201cHe was back to the rookie Eric Kendricks. Then he settled down and got back to playing really well. He just has to stay disciplined in his coverage,\u201d Zimmer said. \u201cI mean, we\u2019re asking him to do a lot of things, because he\u2019s a talented guy. He can cover, he can run, get sideline to sideline, so we ask him to do a lot of things.\u201d\n\nSelected out of UCLA in the second round in 2015 - a stellar draft for the Vikings that also yielded Waynes, Hunter and wide receiver Stefon Diggs - Kendricks has been entrenched as the middle linebacker and appeared in all but five games. There\u2019s as much on his plate in this scheme as for any other player, but in typical rookie fashion in his first year he often overdid it, leading Zimmer to good-naturedly accuse him of playing like he\u2019d consumed too much coffee.\n\nKendricks has come a long way from those days, now in the first season of a five-year contract extension valued at $50 million. He\u2019s more than willing to embrace his status as one of the lesser-known names on this defense.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a bunch of studs. It is what it is,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that\u2019s just one of those things I feel like it\u2019s kind of like my life story.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "For an accomplished, experienced group like the Minnesota Vikings' defense, maintaining that edge is more of the goal than plowing new ground.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dave Campbell"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/07/vikings_giants_football_88233_c0-213-5091-3182_s1200x700.jpg?5c57255d46c19b68d08dd01231184cad9738bd5b", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
