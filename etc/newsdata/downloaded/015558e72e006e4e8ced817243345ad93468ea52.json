The Fed is expected to cut interest rates for a third time this year, but fixed income analysts say this is largely priced into the market.\n\nThe BOJ is leaning toward keeping policy on hold next week, but the decision is a close call as policymakers struggle with threats to the global outlook from the U.S.-China trade war and Brexit.\n\n\u201cA Fed rate cut is already factored in, but the dollar could be bought back if the Fed somehow signals it won\u2019t cut rates further,\u201d said Yukio Ishizuki, foreign exchange strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.\n\n\u201cUntil we can confirm this, traders are likely to adjust their existing positions in the dollar.\u201d\n\nThe dollar traded at 108.77 yen JPY= on Monday, close to 108.94 yen, which is the highest since Aug. 1.\n\nThe greenback EUR= was quoted at $1.1083 per euro, close to its strongest in more than a week.\n\nThe pound GBP=D3 fell 0.14% to $1.2818 and eased 0.15% to 86.48 pence per euro EURGBP=D3.\n\nThe EU bloc\u2019s 27 ambassadors will meet at 0900 GMT on Monday in Brussels to agree on a three-month delay from the current Brexit date of Oct. 31, diplomatic sources told Reuters.\n\nMore than three years after Britons voted in a referendum to quit the EU, the country and its parliament remain divided over how, when and even whether to leave, and the matter has triggered a spiraling political crisis in the UK.\n\nThe dollar index .DXY against a basket of six major currencies stood at 97.849, also near its highest in more than a week.\n\nThe Fed meeting this week is widely expected to result in a cut in interest rates of 25 basis points, and that has been priced in, but some analysts expect the Fed to sound \u201chawkish\u201d by signaling it is reluctant to cut rates further.\n\nThe U.S. currency got a mild boost on Friday after the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office said it is \u201cclose to finalizing\u201d some parts of a trade agreement with China.\n\nOn Saturday, China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce said \u201ctechnical consultations\u201d on some parts of a trade agreement were basically completed, but investors are likely to remain skeptical because even a partial deal would not eliminate risks posed by trade friction.\n\nIn the onshore market, the yuan CNY=CFXS briefly strengthened to 7.0523 per dollar, the strongest since Oct. 14. In the offshore market, the yuan CNH=D3 briefly rose to 7.0450 per dollar on Monday, the strongest since Sept. 13, but then gradually gave up its gains.", "description": "The dollar traded near its highest in more than two months versus the yen on Monday ahead of a U.S. Federal Reserve meeting this week where policymakers are expected to cut interest rates but emphasize their reluctance to ease policy further.", "authors": ["Stanley White", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445702342&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R026", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
