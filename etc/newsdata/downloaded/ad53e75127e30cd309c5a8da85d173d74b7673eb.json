Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) called former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton the \u201cqueen of warmongers\u201d on Friday, blaming Clinton for orchestrating recent smears against her in the mainstream media.\n\nEarlier on Friday, Clinton suggested that Gabbard was being \u201cgroomed\u201d by Russia as a potential third-party candidate. Appearing on a podcast hosted by former Barack Obama campaign manager David Plouffe, Clinton called Gabbard \u201cthe favorite of the Russians.\u201d\n\nLast weekend, the New York Times made similar accusations against Gabbard, without any evidence, calling her \u201ca potentially useful vector for Russian efforts to sow division within the Democratic Party.\u201d\n\nGabbard threatened to boycott last Tuesday\u2019s presidential debate over the article, since the Times co-sponsored the event with CNN. She did not mention Clinton.\n\nBut on Friday, Gabbard let loose:\n\nGreat! Thank you @HillaryClinton. You, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long, have finally come out from behind the curtain. From the day I announced my candidacy, there has been a \u2026 \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) October 18, 2019\n\n\u2026 concerted campaign to destroy my reputation. We wondered who was behind it and why. Now we know \u2014 it was always you, through your proxies and \u2026 \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) October 18, 2019\n\n\u2026 powerful allies in the corporate media and war machine, afraid of the threat I pose. It\u2019s now clear that this primary is between you and me. Don\u2019t cowardly hide behind your proxies. Join the race directly. \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) October 18, 2019\n\nGabbard, who supported Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in the 2016 presidential election, resigned a leadership post in the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in protest at its favoritism toward Clinton.\n\nThe left has long resented Clinton for voting to authorize the Iraq War. She also took credit for the war in Libya \u2014 a war that had disastrous results, as it allowed terrorist groups to take root across northern Africa. Clinton was widely blamed by conservatives for lax security around the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, which was attacked on Sep. 11, 2012.\n\nThe Obama administration originally characterized the attack as a protest against an anti-Islamic video posted by an obscure American filmmaker on YouTube.\n\nHillary Clinton has continued to blame Russia for her loss to Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election. She also criticized the Obama administration \u2014 after leaving it \u2014 for not intervening in Syria sooner. Gabbard is a critic of U.S. involvement in Syria.\n\nJoel B.
