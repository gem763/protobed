I tried to rebuild him because I believed in him.\u2019\n\nArsenal\u2019s decision to let Gnabry leave was criticised in the wake of his four-goal haul in Bayern\u2019s 7-2 demolition of Spurs, though Wenger says he now needs to maintain those levels.\n\nThe Frenchman continued: \u2018A top-level career is consistency, if you look at the players that dominate our sport it\u2019s the ones that show huge consistency and that\u2019s what is at stake.\n\nGnabry couldn\u2019t get a look in while on loan at West Brom before leaving Arsenal (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018Can he maintain the quality of performances that he showed the other night?\u2019\n\nOn that incredible result for Bayern at Spurs, he added: \u2018Bayern had just won 3-0 at Paderborn, you wouldn\u2019t expect them to come and put seven goals away at Tottenham. I think it was one of those nights where everything goes for you and everything against Tottenham.\u2019", "description": "Arsene Wenger has defended the decision to let Serge Gnabry leave Arsenal and believes Bayern Munich played a hand in his desire to seek a move away back in 2016....", "authors": ["Metro Sport Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-185192279-e1570636480882_1570637618.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
