We believe the next 6-18 months will be a period of consolidation as established mobile players further leverage their core publishing infrastructure by acquiring sub-scale studios to drive growth. Zynga has a proven ability to successfully execute this strategy, and we believe the potential for future deals along with the current state of their portfolio make for a very compelling risk/reward profile.\"", "description": "Here are the biggest calls on Wall Street on Tuesday", "authors": ["Michael Bloom"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106109261-1567525778787homedepot.jpg?v=1567525841", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
