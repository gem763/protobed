They\u2019re promising \u2013 literally \u2013 trillions of dollars in added handouts, but their proposed tax increases only cover a tiny fraction of the cost.\n\nElizabeth Warren may be the most extreme example of this phenomenon.\n\nShe\u2019s embraced every possible tax on higher-income taxpayers, including a sure-to-backfire wealth tax. But all of those tax increases wouldn\u2019t come close to financing her spending agenda \u2013 even if one makes the heroic assumption that there\u2019s no adverse economic impact and negative revenue feedback.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal opined on her absurd approach.\n\nTuesday\u2019s Democratic debate\u2026most important news was Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s determined refusal to say if her plans would require taxes to increase on the middle class. \u2026South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg\u2026added, accurately, that \u201cno plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion-dollar hole in this Medicare for All plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in.\u201d \u2026Senator Klobuchar\u2026said \u201cat least Bernie\u2019s being honest here and saying how he\u2019s going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up. And I\u2019m sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that, and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we\u2019re going to send the invoice.\u201d \u2026this illuminates a problem with Ms. Warren\u2019s agenda and her political character. On Medicare for All, everyone agrees that the cost will be at least $32 trillion over 10 years. Ms. Warren could impose her wealth tax, her higher taxes on capital gains, her higher income taxes on the affluent, and she still wouldn\u2019t come close to paying for Medicare for All. And that\u2019s before her plans for new spending entitlements on child care, pre-K education, free college and so much more. The only way to pay for this is to raise taxes on the middle class, which is where the real money is. That\u2019s how government health care is financed in Europe.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just the pro-market crowd at the Wall Street Journal that is raising the issue.\n\nEven writers at Vox find it difficult to rationalize Sen. Warren\u2019s evasive math.\n\nBernie Sanders\u2026acknowledged that\u2026middle-class taxes would have to go up\u2026 It was a rare moment when someone running for the Democratic presidential nomination admitted that their spending ambitions would have to be paid for by taxes that touch not just the wealthiest Americans but taxpayers further down the bracket. \u2026Trying to sell a big progessive agenda on the backs of the rich may be popular. But the admission that middle-class taxes may have to go up is an admission that there may not be enough rich people in America to pay for it all. \u2026Warren\u2026indicated last week that she supports\u2026Medicare-for-All\u2026 Such a plan would overhaul the entirety of the US health care system with a single-payer system funded through general revenue and debt. Here the promise of a vast welfare state solely funded by new taxes on the rich runs aground.\n\nIt\u2019s gotten to the point that some left-leaning economists are scrambling to help square Warren\u2019s circle.\n\nHere are some excerpts from a report in today\u2019s Washington Post, including some of the horrifying tax increases that her advisers are contemplating.\n\nInternal and external economic policy advisers are trying to help Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) design a way to finance a single-payer Medicare-for-all health-care system\u2026her team faces a challenge in crafting a plan that would bring in large amounts of revenue while not scaring off voters with big middle-class tax increases. The proposal could cost more than $30 trillion over 10 years. Complicating matters, she has already committed all of the money she would raise from a new wealth tax, close to $3 trillion over 10 years, to several other ideas\u2026 Robert Pollin, a left-leaning economist at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst who has worked with the Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) teams, \u2026suggests\u2026a $600 billion annual \u201cgross receipts\u201d tax on businesses, \u2026a 3.75 percent sales tax on \u201cnonnecessities\u201d that exempts low-income households, to raise an additional $200 billion; and a 0.38 percent tax on wealth above $1 million, which he says would raise the remaining $200 billion. Robert C. Hockett, a Cornell University professor who has also advised Warren and Sanders, said he has urged Warren\u2019s team to propose financing Medicare-for-all in part with a \u201cpublic premium\u201d that would function similarly to a tax. \u2026Warren\u2019s team has also received recommendations to adopt a \u201cprogressive consumption tax\u201d\u2026 This plan would raise trillions of dollars.\n\nWow, a smorgasbord of French-style tax ideas.\n\nLet\u2019s close with a chart from Brian Riedl of the Manhattan Institute.\n\nAs you can see, even if you combine all of the class-warfare taxes, they don\u2019t come close to paying the $30 trillion price tag of Medicare for All.\n\nThe only good news, so to speak, is that Sen. Warren is a politician. She\u2019s first and foremost interested in winning office and probably isn\u2019t totally serious about actually creating all sorts of new entitlement schemes (just like I don\u2019t particularly believe Republicans who put forth election-year plans for tax reform).\n\nBut that\u2019s hardly a comforting observation since there would be \u201cpublic choice\u201d pressures to adopt at least some bad policy if she got to the White House.", "description": "In a recent interview, I was asked whether all the .10/28/2019 20:14:14PM EST.", "authors": ["Daniel J.
