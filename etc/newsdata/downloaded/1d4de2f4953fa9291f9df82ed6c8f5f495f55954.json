The settlement was the highest for a front-month contract since Sept. 25, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Prices also saw their highest single-session dollar and percentage rise since Jan. 14.\n\nYear to date, however, natural-gas futures, based on the front-month contract, have fallen by nearly 17%.\n\nSpeculators had added to a large net short position in natural-gas futures in the weekly period ended Oct. 22, according to the latest Commodity Futures Trading Commission data, noted analysts at Commerzbank. Net shorts rose by 17,731 contracts to 228,040 (see chart below).\n\nCommerzbank\n\nExtreme speculative positioning is often viewed as a contrarian indicator. That\u2019s because a market move against those positions can be accelerated as weak-handed speculators are forced to liquidate bets.\n\nMeanwhile, the natural-gas market is \u201cat the point in the year where the weather forecasts tend to take control\u2026as speculators bet on how temperature trends will affect demand and ultimately supply levels,\u201d said Tyler Richey, co-editor at Sevens Report Research.\n\n\u201cWith updated forecasts over the weekend calling for colder-than-average temperatures for much of the central and eastern parts of the U.S. in the days and weeks ahead, natgas futures are catching a healthy weather bid,\u201d he told MarketWatch.\n\nThe pending expiration of the November contract at Tuesday\u2019s settlement has also likely contributed to volatile trading for natural gas.\n\nFor now, natural gas has been holding on to a \u201ccritical support zone between $2.20 and $2.30 since futures broke out of a multi-month downtrend back in early September,\u201d said Richey. \u201cLooking ahead, a run toward $2.65 is likely as long as weather forecasts are not drastically adjusted. A break above $2.70 would provide a measured move target of $3.20, which would put futures just 10% below the early 2019 highs.\u201d", "description": "Natural-gas futures rally on Monday, to their highest settlement so far this month and biggest one-day climb since early mid-January.", "authors": ["Myra P.
