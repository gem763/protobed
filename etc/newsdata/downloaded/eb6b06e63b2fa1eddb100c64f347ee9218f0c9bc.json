What I hear from folks time and time again is nothing meaningful came out of these debates and they\u2019re often disconnected from peoples\u2019 lives,\u201d Montana Gov. Steve Bullock said Friday.\n\nBullock spoke with reporters from Fox News, NBC News, and NPR after headlining the \"Politics and Eggs\" speaking series, a must-stop for White House hopefuls in the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state of New Hampshire.\n\nBULLOCK ACCUSES STEYER OF BUYING HIS WAY ONTO DEBATE STAGE\n\nBullock, who launched his campaign in the late spring, qualified for the second round of debates but didn\u2019t reach the Democratic National Committee\u2019s polling and fundraising criteria to make the cut for last month\u2019s showdown or Tuesday\u2019s debate, which will be held in Ohio.\n\nThe DNC\u2019s raising the thresholds again for candidates to make the stage for November\u2019s fifth round showdown, which will be held in Atlanta.\n\nColorado Sen. Michael Bennet is in a similar situation. He jumped into the race relatively late and qualified for the first two rounds of debates, but didn\u2019t make the stage last month and won\u2019t be in the debate spotlight next week.\n\n\u201cI had to make a decision on the debate stage, whether I was going to keep laundering money through Facebook to try to stay on a debate stage that was pre-season football, that wasn\u2019t going to make a difference in the standings, or whether I was going to talk to voters directly in Iowa and New Hampshire,\u201d Bennet explained in an interview on Tuesday with Fox News and NHTalkRadio.com.\n\n\u201cI decided I was going to talk to voters directly in Iowa and New Hampshire at a time when they were going to start paying attention to this race,\u201d he emphasized.\n\nTHE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN\n\nTwelve candidates have qualified for Tuesday\u2019s showdown. Bullock, Bennet, and four other contenders in the still extremely large but shrinking field of Democratic White House hopefuls failed to make the cut.\n\nMost of the lower-tier candidates have fired away for months at the DNC for their debate criteria, arguing it\u2019s unfair and winnows the field of candidates before voters in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina \u2013 the first four states in the primary and caucus presidential nominating calendar, get to cast their ballots.\n\nA slightly more diplomatic Bullock said on Thursday that \u201cthe DNC was well-intentioned but I don\u2019t think the best example is for campaigns to be spending $50 or $60 to get each individual donor\u2026. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the best way to pick a candidate or nominee.\u201d\n\nPushing back against the criticism, DNC Chair Tom Perez told Fox News last month that the process has been \u201ceminently fair\u201d and added \u201cwe\u2019re going \u201cto continue to be transparent.\u201d\n\nRep. Tulsi Gabbard - who failed to qualify for last month\u2019s debate but made the stage for next week\u2019s showdown - announced on Thursday that she may boycott next Tuesday\u2019s debate.\n\nGABBARD THREATENS TO BOYCOTT DEBATE TO PROTEST DNC\n\nThe congresswoman from Hawaii accused the DNC and its national media debate partners of \u201crigging\u201d the primary battle against many of the lower-tier candidates and political outsiders running for the nomination.\n\n\u201cI am seriously considering boycotting October 15 debate to bring attention to DNC/corporate media\u2019s effort to rig 2020 primary,\u201d she tweeted.\n\nEven though he\u2019s not making the stage, Bullock says he\u2019s marching on. He told Fox News he has enough campaign cash to survive until the first votes in the early voting states in February.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still 120 days out from any voter expressing preference. I still think there\u2019s a lot of time for this,\u201d he stressed.\n\nAnd Bennet took aim at the top-tier contenders for the nomination, such as former Vice President Joe Biden and Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\n\n\u201cI think the support for the leaders in the race is very, very soft, maybe as soft as it\u2019s ever been at this stage of the race,\u201d he predicted.", "description": "Two long-shot candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination who failed to make next week\u2019s debate stage are taking aim at the showdowns.", "authors": ["Paul Steinhauser", "Paul Steinhauser Is A Politics Reporter Based In New Hampshire."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/SteveBullock-Politics-Eggs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
