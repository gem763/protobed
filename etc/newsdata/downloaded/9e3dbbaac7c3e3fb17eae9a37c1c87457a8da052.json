However, the first-quarter growth was largely a bounceback after stock-market declines produced a contraction in household wealth in 2018\u2019s fourth quarter.\n\nMuch of that gain comes from a 3.3% rise in the value of household holdings of corporate equities. Stock markets bounced up and down in April and May as the threat of trade conflicts waxed and waned.\n\nAmericans also saw a modest rise in their housing wealth. Equity in real estate owned by households rose 0.4%. The housing market has struggled for more than a year, which has weakened the growth of home prices despite low mortgage rates.\n\nHousehold retirement assets\u2014those held in workplace or personal savings plans such as 401(k)s or IRA\u2019s\u2014grew 1.4%.\n\nThe figures come from a quarterly report issued by the Federal Reserve known as the Flow of Funds, which tracks the aggregate wealth of all U.S. households and nonprofit organizations. The report offers no details of how that wealth is distributed among households. The figures also not adjusted for inflation.\n\nAmericans also ramped up borrowing and saved at a slower rate. Growth in household debt accelerated to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.26% in the second quarter, the strongest pace since the fourth quarter of 2017.\n\nThe household saving rate fell to 8.03% of disposable personal income, down from 8.49% in the first quarter.\n\nThe pace of borrowing by businesses slowed, however. Business debt grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.36% in the second quarter down from 6.72% in the first quarter.\n\nFederal government debt rose 2.08% in the quarter, a slower pace than in the first quarter, while state and local debt fell 2.51%.\n\nWrite to David Harrison at david.harrison@wsj.com", "description": "The net worth of American households grew in second quarter, but at a slower rate than the prior quarter.", "authors": ["David Harrison", "David.Harrison Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109274/social", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
