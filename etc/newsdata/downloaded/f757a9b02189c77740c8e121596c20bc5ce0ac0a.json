Atleti are third on 15 after drawing 0-0 at Real Valladolid on Sunday.\n\nBarcelona rode their luck in the early stages of the game as Julen Lopetegui\u2019s Sevilla made an ambitious start but failed to take their chances while the Catalans were ruthlessly efficient and scored three times in eight first-half minutes.\n\nLuis Suarez gave the champions the lead with an outstanding bicycle kick in the 27th minute and their Chile midfielder Arturo Vidal then got a crucial touch on a tame shot from Arthur Melo to double the lead in the 32nd.\n\nFrenchman Dembele, who started ahead of 120 million euro ($131.76 million) signing Antoine Griezmann, made it 3-0 in the 35th with a superb solo dribble and finish.\n\nBarca captain Messi scored from a free kick in the 78th to finally get off the mark in a season blighted by injuries but there was a sour end to the game for Ernesto Valverde\u2019s side.\n\nUruguayan defender Araujo had made his debut by replacing the injured Jean-Clair Todibo but was sent off 14 minutes later for a last-ditch challenge on Javier Hernandez, while Dembele was dismissed for protesting the decision.\n\nReferee Antonio Mateu Lahoz explained in his report that he showed Dembele a straight red card for saying \u201cvery bad, you are very bad\u201d and waving his arms at him.\n\nThe forward will be suspended from Barca\u2019s next La Liga game at Eibar and is in danger of missing the \u2018Clasico\u2019 against Real, as players who have said similar words to referees in recent seasons have been handed two-game bans.\n\nWORTHY WINNERS\n\nBarca\u2019s scorer Vidal said they deserved the big victory.\n\n\u201cWe were superior to them the whole time, we were always putting them under pressure and we are worthy winners,\u201d he told reporters.\n\n\u201cWe were up against a team who are good with the ball and on the wings but we dominated them in those areas.\u201d\n\nLopetegui\u2019s last visit to the Camp Nou was a painful affair as his then Real Madrid side were hammered 5-1 by Barca in his final game in charge before being sacked, and this was a similarly galling experience for the former Spain coach.\n\nHis Sevilla side created three clear chances to take the lead but missed them all as Dutch striker Luuk de Jong was thwarted by keeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen and then missed the target, as did Brazilian midfielder Fernando.\n\nThe luckless De Jong then had a chance to strike back for his side early in the second half but hit the post, one of 16 attempts for Lopetegui\u2019s side, who only found the target four times. Barca had 15 shots, with eight on target.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a crushing and undeserved defeat,\u201d said Lopetegui. \u201cWe played very well, we were brave and we tried to do what we had worked on in training but we couldn\u2019t take our chances.\u201d\n\nSevilla midfielder Fernando added: \u201cWe had so many chances to score, but if you switch off for one second at the Camp Nou you get punished.\u201d\n\n($1 = 0.9107 euros)", "description": "Lionel Messi scored his first goal of the season as Barcelona beat Sevilla 4-0 on Sunday to climb into second place in the La Liga standings behind Real Madrid but ended the game with nine men as Ousmane Dembele and debutant Ronald Araujo were sent off.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1437994591&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF960F0-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
