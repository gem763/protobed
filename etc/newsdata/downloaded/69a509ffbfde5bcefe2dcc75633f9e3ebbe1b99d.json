And if you're 41 you can't take punishment. You can't take blows like he did in the Thurman fight.\n\n\"Sure, he won that fight \u2013 but he took a lot of punishment. That punishment is going to have a serious effect on how he lives the rest of is life.\"\n\nArum, who earlier this year said he feared Pacquiao risked brain damage before his fight with Thurman, said however the Filipino should consider a rematch with Mayweather.\n\nMayweather, who is now retired, defeated Pacquiao in their 2015 \"Fight of the Century\" which largely failed to live up to the hype.\n\n\"If he gets Mayweather, do that fight and retire,\" said Arum. \"If he doesn't get Mayweather he should retire. It's not worth it for him to continue boxing.\"", "description": "Veteran boxing promoter Bob Arum believes Manny Pacquiao should retire from the sport soon unless he can land a lucrative rematch with Floyd Mayweather.
