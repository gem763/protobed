The most recent Bond actor, Daniel Craig, will play the iconic spy one last time in the 25th film of the series\u2019 57-year run.\n\nBritish actor Lashana Lynch has been rumored to play a female Bond in the movie, but there\u2019s been no confirmation. British tabloid The Daily Mail reported in July that Lynch is a new character who takes over James Bond\u2019s 007 designation after Bond (Craig) retires. But, according to the scoop, the original Bond comes out of retirement in the film.\n\nBrosnan also said that Bond \u2015 known in earlier installments of the movie franchise as a smooth womanizer \u2015 will have to adapt with the times.\n\n\u201cThe Me Too movement has been relevant and significant and well-needed in our society, so they\u2019ll have to address that,\u201d Brosnan said, referring to producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, the stepson and daughter of former series producer Albert Broccoli.\n\nBrosnan said he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019ll see a female Bond hit the screen with the current producers.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen with the Broccolis,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that is going to happen under their watch.\u201d\n\nLast October, Barbara Broccoli told The Guardian that Bond is \u201ca male character.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was written as a male and I think he\u2019ll probably stay as a male. And that\u2019s fine,\u201d Broccoli said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to turn male characters into women. Let\u2019s just create more female characters and make the story fit those female characters.\u201d", "description": "\"Get out of the way, guys, and put a woman up there,\" the former 007 actor said.", "authors": ["Women'S Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d764ded2400002d2277c842.jpeg?cache=u3y02zblfp&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
