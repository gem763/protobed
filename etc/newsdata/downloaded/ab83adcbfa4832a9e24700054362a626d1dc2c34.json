Rumour of The Princess Bride remake sends fans into pit of despair", "language": "en", "text": "Cary Elwes sums up reaction: \u2018There\u2019s a shortage of perfect movies in this world. It would be a pity to damage this one\u2019\n\nThere\u2019s no official news that a Princess Bride remake is in the works \u2013 don\u2019t panic \u2013 but the mere mention of the idea has been descended on by fans of the original, with the actor Jamie Lee Curtis, the film\u2019s original star Cary Elwes, and even the US senator Ted Cruz among those declaring it \u201cinconceivable\u201d.\n\nThe drama began with a Variety profile of the film\u2019s producer Norman Lear. In the article, Sony Pictures Entertainment\u2019s chief executive, Tony Vinciquerra, was quoted as saying: \u201cVery famous people whose names I won\u2019t use, but they want to redo The Princess Bride \u2026 Not a month goes by when we don\u2019t have an idea coming from some very big name wanting to do things with Norman.\u201d\n\nIt was a tiny sentence in a small paragraph of a large profile but it was also the quote that Variety used to share the piece. This led to an outcry, with Elwes \u2013 who played Westley in the 1987 Rob Reiner cult classic \u2013 among many who took to Twitter to lament the idea.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a shortage of perfect movies in this world,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cIt would be a pity to damage this one.\u201d\n\nCary Elwes (@Cary_Elwes) There\u2019s a shortage of perfect movies in this world. It would be a pity to damage this one. https://t.co/5N8Q3P2e5G\n\nCurtis, who married another of the film\u2019s stars, Christopher Guest, also joined the fray, saying \u201cthere is only ONE The Princess Bride\u201d.\n\nJamie Lee Curtis (@jamieleecurtis) Oh really? Well, I married the six fingered man, obviously why we have stayed together for 35 years and there is only ONE The Princess Bride and it\u2019s William Goldman and @robreiner\u2019s. \u201cLife is pain highness. Anyone who says differently is selling something!\u201d https://t.co/hv33UIZKN3\n\nAnd Cruz called the film \u201cthe greatest thing in the world\u201d, adding his own quote from the original.\n\nTed Cruz (@tedcruz) NOOOOOOOO!!!!!! Sonny, The Princess Bride is the greatest thing, in the world\u2014except for a nice MLT, mutton, lettuce and tomato sandwich, where the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato is ripe. They\u2019re so perky, I love that. DON\u2019T MESS WITH PERFECTION. https://t.co/A2lWFlq2yB\n\nClimbing further up the Cliffs of Insanity, Seth Rogen was forced to deny his involvement in the project.\n\nSeth Rogen (@Sethrogen) I would never dare.\n\nOthers noted that attempting to remake the widely beloved and famously quotable film, which the Guardian said was the 23rd best sci-fi and fantasy film of all time, was inadvisable in the extreme.\n\nAdam Lance Garcia (@AdamLanceGarcia) You've fallen for one of the two classic blunders! The first being never get involved in a land war in Asia but only slightly lesser known: never go in on a Princess Bride reboot! https://t.co/1AZkr41gDI\n\nBased on the 1973 novel by William Goldman, the original film wasn\u2019t a box office hit when it debuted in 1987 but has since become beloved as a cult classic.\n\nTo do it over, many believe, would add insult to injury to a generation who have been smothered by remakes. Aladdin, The Lion King, Dumbo and The Dark Crystal \u2013 whose original was released four years before The Princess Bride \u2013 are among the latest examples of the film industry\u2019s pitch for the nostalgia buck, a strategy which has mixed success.\n\nFranklin Leonard (@franklinleonard) I\u2019m rarely a \u201cdon\u2019t remake this\u201d kind of guy, because I make an effort to be near-pathologically optimistic, and I try very hard to believe that there may be some genius version of a remake that I lack the vision to imagine.\n\n\n\nAll that said, don\u2019t remake the Princess Bride. https://t.co/5LvQmoBe12\n\nAndrew Bauer (@thedynamos) The Princess Bride vs. any potential remake. pic.twitter.com/Bs7XPdhcoV\n\nRus McLaughlin (@rusmclaughlin) Do not touch The Princess Bride.\n\n\n\nDo not remake it.\n\n\n\nDo not enhance it.\n\n\n\nDo not remaster it.\n\n\n\nKeep you damn dirty hands off The Princess Bride. pic.twitter.com/VgbWCnOBUI\n\nAs one Twitter user put it: \u201cI like that in these chaotic times we can all put aside our differences and agree that no one should remake The Princess Bride.\u201d", "description": "Cary Elwes sums up reaction: \u2018There\u2019s a shortage of perfect movies in this world.
