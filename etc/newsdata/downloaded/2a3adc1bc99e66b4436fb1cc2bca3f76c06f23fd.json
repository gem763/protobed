We don\u2019t speak about the performances anymore and I think that is not right.\"\n\nHolding held a Reddit AMA (ask me anything) during which a fan quizzed him about the quotes, which came after his second outing for the Gunners, and how they effected him.\n\n\"I enjoyed his response and I do use it as motivation that I am who I am and hard work will get me where I want to be,\" Holding wrote.\n\n(Image: NurPhoto/PA Images)\n\nThe centre back is hoping to continue his comeback from a serious knee injury by appearing against Sheffield United on Monday night.\n\nUnai Emery has hinted that he could utilise Holding alongside fellow injury returnees Hector Bellerin and Kieran Tierney.\n\nThe Spaniard said: He's [Tierney) ready to play.Now we have two options in that left-back role with Sead Kolasinac and him\n\n\"We\u2019re going to play a lot of matches after Monday. We will need every player.\n\n\"It depends how he comes into the first training with us, Sead, after his international matches.\n\n\"We now have two players in that position and we can use one on Monday, it depends how they are, one or the other.\"", "description": "Rob Holding signed for Arsenal for \u00a32million in 2016 which led to Arsene Wenger to hit out at his big spending rivals", "authors": ["Alex Smith", "Image", "Nurphoto Pa Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20652762.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Premier-League-Arsenal-vs-Swansea-City.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
