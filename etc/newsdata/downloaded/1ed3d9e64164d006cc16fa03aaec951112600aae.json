Its owner, Larry Anderer, remembers the day like it was yesterday.\n\nNicknamed \u201cLarry McDonald,\u201d Anderer this year is celebrating his 22nd anniversary as owner of the McDonald\u2019s, which is housed in a Georgian-style mansion dating to 1795.\n\n\u201cWe took a big risk putting all our assets into this business, but on opening day, we had a huge turnout,\u201d said Anderer, 71, of Rockville Centre.\n\nAnderer worked in data processing at IBM and as managing director of Wall Street County NatWest Government Security, a subsidiary of debunked British company National Westminster Bank, until it closed in 1989. He then moved on to business franchising.\n\n\u201cWhen the firm closed on Wall Street, I sat down and reflected about where I wanted to go from there,\u201d Anderer said. \u201cAt the time, McDonald's wasn't so trendy, so it was a safe risk to take.\u201d\n\nThe mansion, formerly known as the Denton House, was abandoned before McDonald\u2019s purchased the property in 1985. Residents were upset with the idea of it being torn down to look like a typical fast-food facility, so they petitioned for historic landmark status and won in 1987. Anderer pays fees to the franchise to own and operate the McDonald\u2019s.\n\nThe house, which is commonly referred to as \u201cMcMansion,\u201d was restored to its former glory and has retained its 1920s exterior look with white pillars and blue shutters.\n\n\u201cWe overcame opposition because we took great strides to go out into the community to make sure we did everything we could to make it right,\u201d Anderer said. \u201cIn my opinion, it\u2019s a faithful replication of what it looked like in the 1920s.\u201d\n\nLarry Anderer\u2019s son, Michael Anderer, decided to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps. Michael, now 42, learned the trade in his father\u2019s McDonald\u2019s and now owns locations in Mineola and West Hempstead.\n\n\u201cI saw how much he enjoyed what he was doing and I wanted to be able to partner with him on something that gave him success,\u201d said Michael Anderer, whom Larry Anderer and his wife Joan adopted from South Vietnam in 1971 after Larry served in the Marines there from 1965-66. \u201cI saw what the commute and pressures of being an executive on Wall Street did to him over the years. After seeing his energy come back when building something on his own, I wanted to be a part of that.\u201d\n\nBill and Deborah DiNoia walked into the quaint restaurant on Wednesday, their eyes drawn to the high ceiling, T-shaped staircase and hanging patchwork quilt with golden arches sewn on.\n\n\u201cThis place is gorgeous,\u201d said Deborah DiNoia, 61, of Levittown. \u201cWe travel a lot, so we eat at McDonald\u2019s all the time and there\u2019s no McDonald\u2019s like this. It\u2019s just so homey.\u201d\n\nHer husband, who was treated for kidney stones earlier that day, hadn\u2019t eaten in 24 hours.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been driving by for years and I\u2019ve always wanted to stop in,\u201d said Bill DiNoia, 61. \u201cIt helps that I\u2019m starving. I\u2019m glad we finally made it in.\u201d\n\nThe couple ordered their usual Big Mac and Angus burger, respectively, with Diet Cokes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to tell my daughter and her kids about this and then they\u2019re going to come here,\u201d Deborah DiNoia said. \u201cI\u2019d describe this place as walking into a restaurant, not into a franchise. \u201cI\u2019m coming back. I feel very comfortable here.\u201d", "description": "Children ran circles around Ronald McDonald, balloons floated up to the high ceiling and patrons receive engraved spatulas as a \u201cthank you\u201d for their support.
