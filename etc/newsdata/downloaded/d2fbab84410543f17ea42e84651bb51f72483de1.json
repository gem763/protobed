[SEOUL METROPOLITAN GOVERNMENT]\n\nThe city government of Seoul is hosting a paper plane festival at Yeouido Hangang Park in western Seoul this coming Sunday.The paper plane festival, which is being hosted for the 11th time this year, will be held from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. at the park.An airport took up most of Yeouido from 1916 to 1958 before being used as an air base from 1958 until 1971.\u201cWe prepared the festival for families to take part in together over the weekend,\u201d the Seoul Metropolitan Government said in a statement. \u201cThe festival is being held at the Yeouido Hangang Park because the area was formerly an airfield and it would provide a good occasion for families to have fun together while competing at how far they can fly their own paper planes.\u201dParticipants can register for paper plane-flying competitions at the festival, which will be organized into three categories: how far the plane can fly, how long it can fly for and how accurately it can fly. Participants will be divided by their age in the competitions for distance flown and length of time.Only 50 family groups can register for the accuracy race. Family members will be asked to fly their paper planes so they land in a designated area.The winners of each of the competitions will be awarded at the end of the festival.There will also be a special exhibition on the history of airplanes and their development, aviation science and small booths prepared for children\u2019s activities.\u201cParticipants can try their hand in making miniature models of helicopters, parachutes or rockets and also take part in racing drones or learn how to use a 3-D printer,\u201d the city government said in its statement.A kite-flying competition will also be organized at the festival this year. Participants will be able to make their own kites and fly them, as well as learn how to make kites using traditional Korean designs.\u201cRegistration for kite-flying events can be made in person during the festival,\u201d the city government said in its statement. \u201cThere will also be an award ceremony following the event.\u201d\u201cThere is something to paper plane-flying. It ties back to our memories as I think most of us grew up flying paper planes at some point,\u201d said Ki Bong-ho, an official of the Seoul Han River project department of the city government. \u201cIt will be a festival for families and friends to take part in together on an autumn afternoon.\u201dRegistration will be open until Friday at naver.me/IDSk8hJU with a total of 800 spaces available.BY ESTHER CHUNG [chung.juhee@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/07200859.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
