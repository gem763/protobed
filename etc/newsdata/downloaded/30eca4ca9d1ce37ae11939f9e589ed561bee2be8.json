He also made a motivational post that showed just how far the group has come thanks to hard work.", "description": "After some took issue with a caption on his Instagram post featuring his daughter's youth basketball team, Los Angeles Lakers legend  Kobe Bryant  has clarified his comments and made it clear there was no malice intended...", "authors": ["Kyle Newport"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/827/685/hi-res-d2bb90518afe330f07c402aa473bfbce_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
