The co-owners initially responded by apologizing, calling it an \u201chonest mistake.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no excuse for what happened and we have already begun to update our internal procedures to ensure future truck stops and events align with our company\u2019s values,\u201d the company\u2019s original statement read, a local ABC affiliate reported. \u201cAs part of our efforts to make amends and learn from this experience, we are donating all the sales from yesterday\u2019s service to Justice for Migrant Families WNY.\u201d\n\nICE fired back in a statement, accusing the company of discriminating against federal workers.\n\n\u201cWe are doing our jobs, enforcing the laws passed by Congress,\u201d said Thomas Feeley, the Buffalo field office director for ICE. \u201cJust like we have for many presidents. We will not apologize for doing this, not even to a food truck that now chooses to discriminate against us.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, the Lloyd co-owners held a news conference essentially retracting their apology, saying they reacted hastily to the criticism and didn\u2019t mean to make a political statement.\n\n\u201cWe make tacos, not war,\u201d co-owner Pete Cimino told reporters. \u201cWe serve all communities, we go to all neighborhoods, we are not political. Why would we be? How can any business choose sides in our politically divided country and ever hope to succeed?\n\n\u201cChris and I want to fully and sincerely apologize for our past statement after our truck\u2019s visit to the federal detention center in Batavia last Wednesday,\u201d he continued. \u201cOur statement was hasty, and we reacted too quickly to criticism we received.\u201d\n\nMr. Cimino said his company, which has four trucks and employs about 130 people, has suffered over the controversy. He said three truck events have been canceled and their Facebook page has racked up thousands of comments, \u201c90% of which were mad at us from both sides of the political spectrum.\u201d\n\n\u201cHonestly, we were not prepared for the anger directed at us, it was surprising and demoralizing,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
