That vote could happen as early as Thursday.\n\nTom Williams/CQ-Roll Call/Getty Images\n\nWhile the resolution isn\u2019t on impeachment itself \u2013 only on the process going forward \u2013 the vote will put every member on record on the validity of the impeachment probe. That could be a tough position for both Republicans and Democrats in more moderate districts and pave the way for political attack ads on both sides.\n\nBarbara Comstock, a former Republican congresswoman from Virginia, predicted the GOP will ultimately stick together.\n\n\u201cMy impression is there will not be a lot of breaks,\u201d Comstock told Devin Dwyer Tuesday on ABC News Live's \"The Briefing Room.\"\n\n\"The Republicans will hold on this because they feel the entire process is unfair,\u201d she said.\n\nFormer Republican @RepComstock weighs in on the House Democrats' impeachment inquiry after the text of an impeachment resolution is posted: \"I think unfortunately they started on a very partisan tone.\" https://t.co/NNXSQSH5Y0 pic.twitter.com/E5ys0E2ahc \u2014 ABC News Live (@ABCNewsLive) October 29, 2019\n\nStill worth watching, though, will be Republicans in swing districts like Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan, whose area supported President Barack Obama before swinging behind Trump in 2016. Nevada Republican Rep. Mark Amodei, who supports Trump, faced pushback in his district after saying he supports congressional oversight efforts.\n\nSeveral GOP lawmakers also are planning to retire, making them considered more likely to break ranks, including GOP Reps. Will Hurd of Texas and Francis Rooney of Florida. Neither has ruled out voting in favor of impeachment.\n\nEven if only a few Republicans vote in favor of an impeachment inquiry, any crossover by members of the president's party will serve as a black eye to Trump ahead of the 2020 election.\n\nOn the flip side, Democrats in districts that supported Trump could easily find themselves vulnerable to political challenges because of their vote.\n\nOne of those Democrats -- Rep. Anthony Brindisi of New York -- tells ABC News he doesn\u2019t know how he\u2019ll vote. Another Democrat in Trump country -- Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey \u2013 said he\u2019ll oppose the resolution.\n\n\"I just believe it's the right thing to do,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we've spent all this time and all this money, all this energy, all this effort, and all this toxicity exists here, because of what's going on. I want to get bills done.\"\n\nThe cameras start to roll\n\nFollowing the House vote, Democrats are expected to begin calling witnesses for public testimony. Those televised hearings may give Americans a chance to hear directly from people who have worked inside the White House or State Department with direct knowledge of Trump\u2019s actions.\n\nAt the top of the list will be Alexander Vindman, an Army lieutenant colonel assigned to work at the White House, who listened to the phone call before Trump and Ukraine\u2019s president.\n\nIn closed-door testimony, Vindman has already told Congress he thought it wasn\u2019t \u201cproper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen\u201d \u2013 a reference to Trump pressing Ukraine\u2019s president to launch an investigation that included Democrat Joe Biden and Biden\u2019s son, Hunter. Vindman said he thought a foreign-led investigation into Trump\u2019s political rival would \u201cundermine U.S. national security.\u201d\n\nAnother likely witness is former ambassador Marie Yovanovitch and her replacement as top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, Bill Taylor, who told Congress last week that he was informed \u201ceverything\u201d \u2013 including $400 million in U.S. military aid to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia \u2013 was contingent upon Ukraine launching that investigation.\n\nIt\u2019s likely Democrats will try to move quickly through with White House staffers and diplomats, inching closer to Trump\u2019s inner circle, including his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and former National Security Adviser John Bolton. The question remains, however, whether the White House officials will cooperate; so far, Giuliani has defied a congressional subpoena.\n\nA shift in GOP messaging\n\nSo far, Republicans have sidestepped questions on substance and stuck with the argument against the process. That didn\u2019t change even after Pelosi\u2019s announcement of a resolution blessing the inquiry.\n\n\u201cI applaud the speaker for finally admitting it is a whole entire sham,\u201d House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California told reporters Tuesday. \u201cBut you can't put a genie back in the bottle. A due process starts at the beginning.\u201d\n\nJim Lo Scalzo/EPA via Shutterstock\n\nAntonia Ferrier, a former GOP aide, said that message is likely to resonate with voters because so many Democrats fought his presidency early, including with the Russia investigation.\n\n\u201cTheir credibility is a real problem when you go after everything and think everything is an impeachable offense. It loses its potency,\u201d said Ferrier, who now works at CGCN Group, a lobbying and strategic communications firm.\n\nRon Bonjean, a former top House Republican spokesman and partner at the public relations firm ROKK Solutions, said Republicans will probably start making the case that impeachment is primarily a political fight, particularly if the inquiry drags into 2020.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much noise going on, and people aren\u2019t really paying attention to that noise,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the end, \u201cthis is an effort to decapitate a Republican president,\u201d Bonjean said.\n\nABC News\u2019 Ben Siegel contributed to this report.", "description": "Five weeks into the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, here are some of the developments to watch for next.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/schiff-gty-er-191030_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
