Police found a charred vehicle in a wooded area nearby later that night with evidence of human remains inside, but they said it's too early to say if the cases are related.\n\nRinaldo said the vehicle was completely burned out and it will take \"quite sometime\" to trace its origin or identify the human remains inside.\n\nAfter making contact with the child's grandparents, police said he may have been on a road trip with his parents -- Nicole Merced Plaud, 24, and Miguel Valentin-Colon, 31 -- and 29-year-old Dhamyl Roman-Audiffred, a family friend.\n\nThe young boy's family said they didn't know his parents had planned to go out of town, but it wasn't unusual from them to take road trips.\n\nBuffalo Police Department via Facebook\n\n\"We're heartbroken, we're worried, we're scared,\" Noelvin\u2019s grandfather, Jorge Oquendo, told ABC affiliate WFTV on Wednesday. \"We're all devastated. ... We're all devastated for a lot of reasons. We have no answers, we don't know what happened, we don't know if it happened.\"\n\nOfficers with the Buffalo Police Department's homicide division released images of parents and Roman-Audiffred on Tuesday, saying they were \"attempting to make contact with these three individuals or speak to anyone who has seen them in the past few days.\"\n\n\"We believe that these people may have arrived in Buffalo sometime late Sunday night and were here and possibly are still in the Buffalo area,\" Rinaldo told reporters Tuesday. \"We will not know the identities of the people found in the vehicle for quite some time. It is requiring the services of forensic anthropologist to put together exactly what happened.\"\n\nPolice said they're reviewing video evidence in an effort to create a possible timeline of events. They said anyone who may have saw the vehicle on fire or should contact police immediately.", "description": "Police say he may have been on a road trip with his parents, who are missing.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/missing-boy-ht-jef-190918_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
