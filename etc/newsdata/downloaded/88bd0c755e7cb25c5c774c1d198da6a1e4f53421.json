In attempt to differentiate itself from its all-powerful and world-conquering competitors Marvel, DC Comics have rolled the dice on this R-rated standalone arthouse film, a character study about a mentally unwell man who's kicked when he's down time and time again (sometimes literally) before breaking with a series of almighty snaps. And to be absolutely clear, this film is unapologetically bleak. This is not escapism, this is not entertainment. This is brutal. This is not in the same world as Henry Cavill\u2019s Superman or Gal Gadot\u2019s Wonder Woman: this is a Scorsese-influenced exploration of sanity and society in a world where no-one seems to care about the little guy. If you\u2019re looking for a tone, think Taxi Driver meets King Of Comedy (only this time around, Robert De Niro is in the comedian chat show host role).\n\nWhile Joker is \u2013 wait for it \u2013 undeniably crushing, powerful, ugly, hurtful, unpleasant and uncomfortable, it\u2019s also about something: humanity, the struggle to survive, the distribution of wealth and power, mental illness, society itself, the human condition. How many \u201ccomic book movies\u201d can you say that about? Like its lead, it feels dangerous, like a grenade with a faulty pin, but this film is about something, even if some of its messaging is clumsily delivered (see below).\n\nCons\n\nThis really is almost unbearably grim. Do not \u2013 I repeat, do not \u2013 bring the kids. It\u2019s rated 15 in the UK, but it honestly felt more like an 18. You may want to invest in an XL sugary slurpie of some kind to maintain your good mood, because walking out of the cinema you\u2019ll feel like your head has been bashed a few times. In a good way... Kind of. Joker really is such a baseball bat to the skull, I wonder if I will ever watch it again. I mean\u2026 I probably will, but not any time soon.\n\nJoker bangs the same drum over and over again \u2013 the world is awful, no-one cares, that sort of thing \u2013 that the more nuanced stuff gets dulled along the way. And with a bit of distance, and a bit of reading around the movie, I am now feeling that the film is perhaps not quite as clever as it thinks it is. That\u2019s a poorly made comment, and one that\u2019s hard to explain, but once you see the movie, next time you spot me in the street, stop me and we can talk it through, because this really is one of those films worth talking about. I am already almost \u201ctalked out\u201d about this movie and at the time of writing it hasn\u2019t even been released yet. It\u2019s that much of a hot button film.\n\nWith it being a character study, it feels wrong to complain of a lack of antagonist or traditional plot \u2013 it\u2019s an awfully treated man rotting into himself before exploding with rage \u2013 so I\u2019ll take a different tack: the hype is GIGANTIC. This film arrives with a parade of five-star reviews from the great and good of film criticism, blessed with the \u201cGolden Lion\u201d award from Venice Film Festival and a whole host of other plaudits from people who know about films real good. This may well actually diminish your enjoyment of the film, as the reality of the cinema-going experience fails to match your sky-high expectations. It\u2019s good, it\u2019s interesting, it\u2019s different, it\u2019s got a powerhouse performance from \u2018The Joaquer\u2019 (as I call him) but it\u2019s not perfect.\n\nThree word review: Flawed, fascinating, frightening", "description": "But the latest outing of Joker is far from perfect", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p07q0rk4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
