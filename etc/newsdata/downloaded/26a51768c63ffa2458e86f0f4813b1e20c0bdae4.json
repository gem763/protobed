Ouch.\n\nAt least the bride can take comfort in that she\u2019s not the only one to have her ring shamed in the group.\n\nPrevious delights include a ring that looks like a \u2018prolapsed butthole\u2019 and another which apparently resembled a \u2018jewel encrusted speculum\u2019.\n\nJust this morning, we also revealed a \u2018door knob\u2019 wedding ring, which someone said was \u2018the most horrid ring\u2019 they\u2019d ever seen.\n\nThe lesson to learn here?
