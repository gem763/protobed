This afternoon, Gabbard responded with fury on Twitter calling Clinton \u201cthe queen of warmongers\u201d and the \u201cembodiment of corruption.\u201d She also suggested that Hillary has been working against her candidacy behind the scenes:\n\nGreat! Thank you @HillaryClinton. You, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long, have finally come out from behind the curtain. From the day I announced my candidacy, there has been a \u2026 \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) October 18, 2019\n\n\u2026 powerful allies in the corporate media and war machine, afraid of the threat I pose. It\u2019s now clear that this primary is between you and me. Don\u2019t cowardly hide behind your proxies. Join the race directly. \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) October 18, 2019\n\nGabbard isn\u2019t just imagining that Clinton-world (and the media) seem to be out to get her. Just last weekend the NY Times ran a piece titled, \u201cWhat, Exactly, Is Tulsi Gabbard Up To?\u201d which attempted to connect Gabbard to the alt-right. Here\u2019s how the story opened:\n\nStephen K. Bannon, President Trump\u2019s former chief strategist, is impressed with her political talent. Richard B. Spencer, the white nationalist leader, says he could vote for her. Former Representative Ron Paul praises her \u201clibertarian instincts,\u201d while Franklin Graham, the influential evangelist, finds her \u201crefreshing.\u201d And far-right conspiracy theorists like Mike Cernovich see a certain MAGA sais quoi.\n\nEventually, the story gets around to quoting Clinton-world figures attacking Gabbard, including the claim that she could be a \u201cuseful vector\u201d for the Russians:\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s taken a series of policy steps which signal to the right that she has deep areas of alignment,\u201d said Neera Tanden, a longtime policy adviser to Hillary Clinton who now leads the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank\u2026 Laura Rosenberger, a former policy aide to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign and director of the Alliance, sees Ms. Gabbard as a potentially useful vector for Russian efforts to sow division within the Democratic Party. \u201cThe Russian activity could be part of a longer-term effort to drive a wedge among Democrats,\u201d she said. \u201cThis messaging has echoes of 2016.\u201d\n\nSo the claims Hillary made this morning about Gabbard were already trial ballooned by Clinton-world figures in the NY Times. There could be a political motivation for this. Kamala Harris was the candidate who seemed coziest with Hillary Clinton. Gabbard\u2019s attack on Harris\u2019 record as a prosecutor during an earlier debate really left a mark. Maybe this is payback? Whatever Clinton\u2019s motive, plenty of progressives seem to be doubling down on Hillary\u2019s latest Russian conspiracy theory:\n\nWhen Stephen Bannon, Richard Spencer, Franklin Graham, Mike Cernovich, and other alt right white supremacists support Tulsi Gabbard, you know that she\u2019s on the wrong side. Hopefully Tulsi doesn\u2019t run as an Independent out of spite to help Putin\u2019s Russia and re-elect Trump. \u2014 Eugene Gu, MD (@eugenegu) October 18, 2019\n\nAnd yet here we are, with you having failed once again to deny or refute any of her claims. \u2014 Anita Creamer (@AnitaCreamer) October 18, 2019\n\nLet us guess: you\u2019re so upset about the rigged primary that you\u2019re going to run as a third-party candidate. P.S.: how\u2019d the vote go on H J RES 77? \u2014 Amy Siskind \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 (@Amy_Siskind) October 18, 2019\n\nHey! I know how to prove I'm not Putin's useful idiot \u2014 by literally repeating Russian and GOP propaganda attack lines about Hillary so tens of thousands of fake accounts that are funded by Russia and the GOP can RT and \"Like\" it. This will work. This will convince them all. \u2014 Kno (@Kno) October 18, 2019\n\nThere are lots more like this from people who don\u2019t have blue checks or large follower counts. But despite the negative reactions, Gabbard\u2019s tweet has more than 80k likes and 25k retweets at this point. She seems to have a lot more supporters than detractors.\n\nHillary will probably feel obligated to issue a snarky response to this. My guess is she\u2019s having her staff brainstorm one now but nothing so far.", "description": "\"...personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tulsi-Gabbard.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
