But we say: no nation, no class!\u201d one student protester said.\n\n\u201cAll we want is for the government to immediately submit its resignation. Either it resigns, or it gets ousted.\u201d\n\nAbout 60 percent of Iraq\u2019s 40-million-strong population is under the age of 25.\n\nBut youth unemployment stands at 25 percent and one in five people live below the poverty line, despite the vast oil wealth of OPEC\u2019s second-largest crude producer.\n\nAnger at inequality and accusations that government corruption was fuelling it sparked protests in Baghdad on October 1 that have since attracted growing numbers of young people.\n\nOn Monday, a group of three students drove up close to Tahrir Square, unloading kits and cans of Pepsi to help treat those affected by tear gas.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my first day at the protests. I told my mom I\u2019m going to class, but I came here instead!\u201d a girl with curly hair told AFP.\n\nIn the province of Diyala, which had so far been calm, two members of the provincial council resigned in solidarity with the rallies.\n\nEven in the holy city of Najaf, dozens of young clerics-to-be took to the streets.\n\nThe protests are unprecedented in recent Iraqi history for their ire at the entire political class, with some even criticising traditionally revered religious leaders.\n\n\u201cWe want the parliament to be dissolved, a temporary government, an amended constitution and early elections under United Nations supervision,\u201d a demonstrator in Baghdad told AFP on Monday.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what the people want. We don\u2019t want another solution.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Parliamentary paralysis \u2013\n\nAbdel Mahdi has proposed a laundry list of reforms, including hiring drives, increased pensions and promises to root out corruption.\n\nIraqi President Barham Saleh has also held discussions with the UN on electoral reform and amendments to the 2005 constitution.\n\nParliament has tried to meet to discuss the protests but failed several times to reach a quorum.\n\nLawmakers were set to meet on Monday, but the sitting had not begun at the scheduled time of 1:00 pm (1000 GMT).\n\nFour lawmakers resigned late on Sunday in solidarity with demonstrators, and the largest bloc has been holding an open-ended sit-in since Saturday night.\n\nSaeroon, the bloc tied to firebrand cleric Moqtada Sadr, said it was dropping its support for Abdel Mahdi.\n\nThe move has left the premier more squeezed than ever, as Saeroon was one of the two main sponsors of his government.\n\nThe other was Fatah, the political arm of the Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary force, which has said it would continue to back the central government.\n\nSeveral Hashed offices have been torched in recent days in southern Iraq, prompting vows of \u201crevenge\u201d from its leaders.\n\nSadr responded Sunday, warning them: \u201cDo not champion the corrupt. Do not repress the people.\u201d", "description": "Baghdad (AFP) \u2013 Students and schoolchildren hit the streets of Baghdad and southern Iraq on Monday to join escalating calls for the government to", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/28/a650ae_iraqi-medical-students-in-an-anti-government-demonstration-in-central-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
