We love everything there about them and we appreciate the support that they give us individually and as organisation.'\n\nWestbrook and his teammate James Harden apologise to Beijing through the press on Monday after their team manager Morey lent his support to anti-government protesters in Hong Kong\n\nThe row between China and the NBA began last Friday when Daryl Morey posted an image captioned 'Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong' on Twitter.\n\nHis Tweet caused an instant outrage in China because the country views the four months of unrest in the city as a 'separatist movement' masterminded by 'Western forces' against the Communist regime.\n\nMr Morey deleted his tweet and apologised to 'Rockets fans and friends of mine in China'.\n\nNBA also said sorry and called Mr Morey's post 'regrettable'.\n\n'I did not intend my tweet to cause any offence to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China,' Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey (pictured) tweeted as he apologised to Beijing\n\nMorey's initial tweet included an image captioned: 'Fight For Freedom.

Both outlets claim the video was taken in Shanghai.\n\nIn a post, Global Times also condemned that Silver 'still hasn't apologised'.\n\nIt is likely that Silver will or has met with his Chinese counterpart Yao Ming, a former Houston Rockets player, who is said to be 'extremely angry' over Morey's remarks.\n\nShanghai-born Mr Yao, 39, played a key role in the popularisation of NBA in the huge market after being picked by the Rockets in the NBA draft in 2002.\n\nThe 7ft5in former centre is now the head of the Chinese Basketball Association.\n\nAnother clip shared by both media outlets show workers in Shanghai taking down road-side advertisements for the pre-season game.\n\nChinese workers are seen ripping down an NBA billboard advertisement on Wednesday after the nation's state broadcasters vowed not to air this week's preseason games in China\n\nA worker can be seen taking down a billboard advertising an NBA basketball game scheduled to take place on Thursday between the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets in Shanghai\n\nIn a Communist talk show from CCTV yesterday, an anchor called Silver's pro-democracy remarks 'a joke'.\n\nThe anchor said freedom of speech did not mean Silver had the liberty to make 'absurd comments'. He also blasted Silver for not understanding the meaning of free speech.\n\nYesterday, another Chinese state-controlled newspaper Global Times issued a stern warning to global businesses in response to the controversy surrounding NBA and Daryl Morey, telling worldwide firms to stay away from politics.\n\nGlobal Times claimed it was 'ridiculous' to suggest that Mr Morey was entitled to free speech.\n\n'The incident shows an expanding worldwide culture gap,' it wrote.", "description": "Westbrook wore a burgundy tunic jacket during a press conference alongside Harden after debuting as a member of the Rockets in a pre-season game against the Toronto Raptors yesterday.", "authors": ["Billie Thomson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/15/19493926-0-image-a-14_1570630182782.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
