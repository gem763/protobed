That milestone achieved, the series dutifully follows the template of its DC-CW brethren, but with its drama limited by its taciturn protagonist and an initially uninspired supporting cast.\n\nThree years after Batman disappeared, criminal gangs have nearly overrun Gotham. Enter Bruce Wayne's cousin, Kate Kane (Ruby Rose), who picks up the cape and cowl, with help from tech wizard Luke Fox (Camrus Johnson), the son of Wayne Enterprises' Lucius Fox, becoming her de facto Alfred.\n\nIf the Batman franchise has always been defined in part by its villains (see a multiplex near you for a current example), the central threat here proves weak, as do the mythological tie-ins to the Kanes' complicated family history, which includes Kate's dad (Dougray Scott), who oversees a private security force.\n\nThe show falls under the aegis of mega-producer Greg Berlanti, whose deft touch overseeing the DC-CW-Warner Bros. portfolio has been impressive in its scope, and notable for its ambitious, tender-loving approach to the material.
