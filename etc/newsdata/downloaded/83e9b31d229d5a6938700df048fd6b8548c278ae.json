Artificial plants \u2014 fake plants, silk plants, faux foliage, or whatever you want to call them \u2014 offer a simple solution. They\u2019ll never outgrow their pots, the leaves will never droop down and turn yellow, and there\u2019s no need to worry about watering or fertilizing. They\u2019re also pet-safe and child-safe.\n\nLike any living plant, artificial plants can work wonders for any d\u00e9cor situation, and we doubt that anyone will know the difference once they\u2019re displayed on a nice plant stand. We found some small options if you want to be subtle, like mini succulents and a potted orchid, as well as larger ones for those unafraid to go all out with a big statement ficus tree or monstera. No matter the size, an artificial plant can give you the look you\u2019re going for without all the fuss.\n\nBest artificial floor plants\n\nNearly Natural 5.5-Foot Tall Fiddle-Leaf Fig $240 (was $270, now 11% off) A 5.5 foot tall fiddle-leaf fig that\u2019s never going to die on you. This one is pricier than some of the other faux options out there, but we\u2019re impressed by how realistic-looking it is. Most companies seem to \u201coverstuff\u201d their silk fiddles with big clusters of leaves, which is a dead giveaway in our humble opinion. This one is spare and minimal, like the real deal. $240 at Amazon Buy $240 at Amazon Buy\n\nSilk Tree Warehouse 5-Foot Artificial Bird of Paradise Plant $83 (was $159, now 48% off) Birds of paradise are one of those plants that almost look fake even when they\u2019re real, so save yourself the trouble. This 5 foot tall faux bird of paradise \u2014complete with irregular leaf tears and crinkles \u2014 will make just as much of a statement as a live one. $83 at Amazon Buy $83 at Amazon Buy\n\nTerrain Faux Philodendron Rounding out the \u201cBig Three\u201d of status-y floor plants is, of course, the monstera. Terrain makes some of the best-looking artificial plants we\u2019ve seen, but they\u2019re pricey. Still, if you\u2019ve got the money, this one is a real showstopper. $338 at Terrain Buy\n\nFopamtri Artificial Monstera Deliciosa Plant 43\" If you want to spend a good bit less and still get a realistic-looking monstera, this is a good choice. $90 at Amazon Buy $90 at Amazon Buy\n\nNearly Natural Silk Ficus Tree, 6-Feet This 6 foot ficus has a delicate look, with its long and slender trunk, and the intricately detailed leaves will catch anyone\u2019s eye. (The manufacturer\u2019s product description says it has \u201c1,008 individual leaves.\u201d) $60 at Amazon Buy $60 at Amazon Buy\n\nNearly Natural Artificial Rubber Plant in Cylinder This is a particularly impressive imitation of the very on-trend variegated rubber tree. At 2 feet tall, its a bit smaller than the other artificial floor plants on this list, but would look perfect perched on a plant stand. $50 at Amazon Buy $50 at Amazon Buy\n\nNearly Natural Golden Cane Palm Silk Tree, 6.5\u2019 Get vertical with this faux palm tree that towers more than 6 feet high. Stick with a simple planter since the tree makes a statement on its own. $91 at Amazon Buy $91 at Amazon Buy\n\nVickerman 6\u2019 Japanese Maple Executive Tree Japanese maple trees typically only thrive outdoors and take years to grow. Skip all that with an elegant faux version. $120 at Walmart Buy\n\nNearly Natural Sansevieria Plant with Black Planter $74 (was $87, now 15% off) Snake plants are pretty hard to kill, it\u2019s true, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s impossible. This looks just like the real thing, and it even comes with a modern-looking black planter. $74 at Amazon Buy $74 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest artificial hanging plants\n\nNearly Natural Spider Hanging Basket Decorative Silk Plant $32 (was $42, now 24% off) The details and shading on the leaves of this hanging spider plant make it nearly indistinguishable from the real thing. $32 at Amazon Buy $32 at Amazon Buy\n\nVickerman 26\u201d Silk Mini Ivy Hanging Bush It\u2019d be very bohemian to dangle these hanging ivy leaves from a macram\u00e9 planter. $26 at Walmart Buy\n\nNearly Natural Boston Fern in Hanging Basket $49 (was $69, now 29% off) Hang this silk Boston fern in your living room, or outdoors over your porch. $49 at Amazon Buy $49 at Amazon Buy\n\nNearly Natural Silk Bougainvillea Hanging Basket If you\u2019re getting an artificial hanging plant, you might as well go for it and buy something that would be near-impossible to successfully grow indoors, like this always-blooming, bright pink bougainvillea. $50 at Amazon Buy $50 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest artificial tabletop plants\n\nNearly Natural Cedar Bonsai Decorative Silk Plant 16\u201d $50 (was $58, now 14% off) Get the bonsai look without worrying about delicate trimming and upkeep. $50 at Amazon Buy $50 at Amazon Buy\n\nNearly Natural Peace Lily Artificial Flower with Glossy Glass Planter Real peace lilies can be poisonous to many pets, so this silk version is a good choice for owners of curious cats and dogs. $47 at Amazon Buy $47 at Amazon Buy\n\nNearly Natural Agave Plant with Black Planter You unfortunately can\u2019t use this silk agave to make tequila, but it will add a bold geometric pop to any end table. $62 at Amazon Buy $62 at Amazon Buy\n\nNapa Home and Garden Conservatory Phalaenopsis Drop-In Silk Orchid, 23-Inches We wrote an article about how to not kill an orchid, and although it\u2019s definitely possible to keep one alive for many years, it\u2019s not exactly foolproof. We love the look of this silk orchid with pink blooms, and the exposed aerial roots and faux moss make it appear even more realistic. While you\u2019ll need to supply your own pot, we like this \u201cdrop-in\u201d style because it means you won\u2019t be stuck with one of the cheaper-looking plasticky pots that are often attached to silk orchids. $70 at Amazon Buy $70 at Amazon Buy\n\nArtificial succulents\n\nMyGift 36-Inch Faux Saguaro Cactus in Cement Style Clay Pot While succulents and cacti are resilient plants and don\u2019t need much water, they still like a lot of light. If your space is \u201clight-challenged,\u201d or if you\u2019re sick of getting pricked by your cactus, a faux option like this might be a good fit. $80 at Amazon Buy $80 at Amazon Buy\n\nWinlyn Assorted Decorative Faux Succulent Plants with Gray Pots, Set of 5 Decorate your desk with some fake succulents that won\u2019t mind if you take an extra-long weekend. $15 at Amazon Buy $15 at Amazon Buy\n\nAnd an artificial plant to keep outside\n\nNearly Natural Boxwood Ball Topiary $92 (was $133, now 31% off) No need to break out the pruning shears to maintain the perfectly round shape of this boxwood.
