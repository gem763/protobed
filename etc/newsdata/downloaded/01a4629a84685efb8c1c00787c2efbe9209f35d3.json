While still in his teens, Kawamori joined the industry in the late 1970s. Since then, some things have changed. Other things have not.\n\nBesides co-creating Macross and designing some of the anime\u2019s most famous machines, Kawamori has also worked on the early Transformers iterations and has done mecha design for the Armoured Core series. Most recently, he created the robotic arms in Devil May Cry 5. He is one of Japan\u2019s most influential mechanical designers and anime directors.\n\nA special exhibition called the Shoji Kawamori Expo was held from May 31 to June 23 to commemorate the past four decades of his career. At 59, Kawamori doesn\u2019t show any signs of slowing down.\n\nThis month, I met up with Kawamori at a Tokyo coffee shop off a leafy-green street near the Satelight studio offices.\n\n\u201cWhen I was a little kid, Japan wasn\u2019t making that much anime,\u201d Kawamori recalled when I asked him which anime he watched as a child. \u201cAstro Boy was just getting started.\u201d The original Astro Boy manga began its run in 1952, and creator Osamu Tezuka brought it to small screens in 1964.\n\nThe iconic show had a four-year run, but its influence can still be felt today. Later that same year in 1963, the Gigantor debuted in Japan, and by 1972, when Mazinger Z aired, robot anime was an established anime genre.\n\nRobot anime would inspire the next generation of animators. During the 1960s, the older generation, which had experienced World War II firsthand, was making realistic war anime like Zero-sen Hayato.\n\nBut kids who watched the Apollo landing on TV weren\u2019t looking to the past. As they came of age, they wanted to make anime that looked to the future. \u201cAs the generation of animators changed,\u201d said Kawamori, \u201cso did the anime.\u201d\n\n\u201cPersonally, though, I adored the Thunderbirds,\u201d said Kawamori. For a kid who loved cars, aeroplanes, and space ships, the machines and vehicles in the British-made puppet show were inspiring. As a kid, Kawamori built his own creations out of papercraft and blocks.\n\nBut it was Space Battleship Yamato that changed his life forever. The space yarn aired from 1974 to 1975 and would go on to influence Mobile Suit Gundam.\n\n\u201cWhen I was in my last year of junior high school, my friends and I watched Yamato,\u201d he said. They were thrilled to see such a complex and detailed sci-fi anime come out of Japan.\n\n\u201cOne of my friends got in touch with Studio Nue, the studio that made the anime, and we got a tour.\u201d It was during the break between the end of junior high and the start of high school.\n\n\u201cI was surprised to see how small and how dirty that studio was,\u201d Kawamori said, chuckling. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t much bigger than this coffee shop.\u201d The inside of the studio seemed like it was falling apart, but the anime being produced there was sophisticated, polished, and unlike anything Kawamori had seen previously. \u201cThe gap between the anime\u2019s quality and what that studio looked like was incredible.\u201d\n\nThis was a different time. \u201cVisiting an anime studio now isn\u2019t impossible if you go through the correct channels, but it certainly is much more difficult now than it was then,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m incredibly grateful to my friend for setting that up.\u201d\n\nKawamori kept in touch with Studio Nue and impressed the team with his designs. During his last year of high school, he ended up working there part-time. \u201cWhen I was 19, I became a full-time employee.\u201d He threw himself into his debut work, Super Dimension Fortress Macross. Kawamori came up with the story, created mechanical designs along with Kazutaka Miyatake, and co-produced the show.\n\nIt was the early 1980s. Kawamori was studying engineering at Keio University\u2014well, he was supposed to be. During his commute, he wasn\u2019t studying for tests, but working on the Macross anime. \u201cThat was really hard,\u201d he said. \u201cI was getting three to three and a half hours of sleep each night.\u201d Even when he took the train, Kawamori was working on Macross, putting pages up against the train\u2019s windows as a make-shift light table.\n\n\u201cMy parents were very much against my decision to go into anime,\u201d Kawamori said. His father told him he could do whatever he wanted as long as he graduated. He never did, but that didn\u2019t matter. At age 23, he began directing his first feature film, Macross: Do You Remember Love?\n\n\u201cAnime became hugely popular in the 1980s in Japan,\u201d said Kawamori. There were suddenly anime fan magazines, and voice talent like Mari Iijima became superstars. Feature films drew crowds at the cinema, and OVA (original video animation) let animators take more time for home releases. The demand was insatiable. As the anime industry grew, so did the fanbase at home and abroad.\n\n\u201cCulture has changed, I think,\u201d said Kawamori. \u201cBecause of the internet, people all over the world learn about things in real-time.\u201d This, in turn, has broken down unexpected barriers that previously hindered the popularity of certain anime. \u201cI was once told that in the past the reason why mecha anime didn\u2019t become widely popular in the West was because of their size,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe reason explained to me was that these machines were so large that they were god-like.\u201d Kawamori, however, didn\u2019t agree with that explanation. \u201cA better reason I heard was that these mecha had a face, and because the pilots obviously had a face, too, American viewers were unsure who they were rooting for.\u201d Was the mecha the protagonist? Or was the pilot? The dual identities were apparently confusing. \u201cBut,\u201d Kawamori continued, \u201cTransformers only had one identity, which is why it was easier for that to become popular in the U.S.\u201d\n\nAs a kid growing up, I never had that problem with Voltron or any of the other imported robot and mecha shows. But the reason might have been that I was young enough not to have pre-set expectations and perhaps more open to this dynamic than the older generation. This is likely true for others who grew up in the 1980s and even more so for those who came of age in the years that followed. \u201cNow, because of the internet and the shared culture, this kind of thing doesn\u2019t seem to be an issue at all,\u201d said Kawamori.\n\nWhile tastes might have broadened, in some ways, the anime industry has not changed. Astro Boy showed that TV anime could be made on the cheap, which is something that continues to this day. Salaries are still low, and production methods still seem arcane. After interviewing Kawamori, I took a tour of the Satelight production studio. Since the tragic Kyoto Animation tragedy, security has been ramped up.\n\nInside, the studio was as quiet as a library \u2014 something that has not changed. Torn-up cardboard boxes divided each dish for privacy and centration. Conversations were in hushed tones, nobody played music, and the only sound you\u2019d hear was the occasional sharpening of a pencil.\n\n\u201cAround 80 per cent of the staff is still drawing by hand,\u201d Kawamori said back at the cafe. \u201cI do wonder how long that will continue. I see that continuing over the next 10 years, but that will become more difficult to do in the next 20 and 30 years.\u201d This might be a result of the impractically of paper and pencil but also the generational change, with younger animators growing up drawing digitally.\n\n\u201cI think hand-drawn anime will remain, but it will be a traditional craft in Japan, like kabuki or Noh theatre. But if Japanese companies go full CG, then their work ends up looking like the stuff you see made in other countries. I think a combination between the typical flat style of hand-drawn anime and 3D animation suits Japan.\u201d\n\nBut even after all these years, one thing has not changed: Macross is still iconic. \u201cWhen Macross first came out, I thought it was going to be popular. I had no idea that I\u2019d be doing it this long.\u201d", "description": "Shoji Kawamori\u2019s career in anime has spanned four decades.
