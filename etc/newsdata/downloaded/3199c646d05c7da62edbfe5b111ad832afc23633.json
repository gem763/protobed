The world-famous DJ is set to debut his latest Eric Prydz In Concert (EPIC) show \u2014 a big and ambitious experience that draws tens of thousands of fans and gets the entire dance world talking. Every EPIC is a limited engagement that pushes the limits of how tech and music interact. This year, Prydz is pulling off the most grandiose performance to date, in the form of a giant transparent LED sphere called EPIC 6.0: Holosphere.\n\n\u201cEver since we started doing EPIC,\u201d Prydz says, \u201cour goal has always been to try and blow people away, but in a way that they haven\u2019t been blown away before at an electronic dance music event.\u201d The first EPIC was in 2011, and over time the show has grown into one of dance music\u2019s most bombastic multi-sensory events, employing hundreds of laser beams, digital screens larger than a jumbo jet, and colossal holographic effects.\n\nPrydz has set a high bar, but this new show might be his most ambitious. He and his team have been working on the Holosphere for the past two years and will reveal it at Belgium\u2019s Tomorrowland festival on Saturday, July 20th. The centerpiece is an eight-meter-wide sphere, and the whole production is so large the festival had to redesign its grounds in order to accommodate it. While Prydz DJs on a riser inside, millions of pixels and hundreds of lights will flash futuristic scenes around him that tower over the crowd.\n\nOn paper, the EPIC shows make little sense. They\u2019re extravagant, complicated, laborious, and expensive, making them jaw-dropping, custom-built spectacles that are almost impossible to tour. Few venues have the space and resources to host EPIC shows, so each one is only performed a handful of times before being shelved. Prydz says he\u2019s lost hundreds of thousands of dollars on EPIC shows. For him, it\u2019s not about profit; it\u2019s about using technology to create an experience no other DJ is offering.\n\n\u201cHuge confetti cannons and flamethrowers are very primitive,\u201d Prydz says of the usual attention-getting tricks. \u201cI thought, we can do better than this. We can do something different and more exciting.\u201d\n\nGrid View EPIC 1.0 Photo: Antonio Pagano\n\nEPIC 2.0 Photo: Andrew Rauner\n\nEPIC 3.0 Photo: Madison Square Garden\n\nEPIC 4.0 Image: RUKES\n\nEPIC 5.0 Image: Anthony Mooney\n\nThe EPIC shows have centered around increasingly grand holographic effects in recent years. In one instance, a 44-meter-wide projection was winged out over the audience, making it look like entire scenes appeared out of thin air. In another, a larger than life astronaut \u201chologram\u201d hovered over the crowd.\n\nEPIC shows are extravagant, complicated, and expensive\n\nThe upcoming Holosphere is a complete redesign that does away with projected holographic effects. In their place is the multistory sphere, kitted out with over 2.4 million LEDs. During the performance, the Holosphere will illuminate with swirling galaxies, crackle with darts of electricity, and transform into slowly rotating alien planets. Depending on how much of the sphere lights up and at what intensity, Prydz can be clearly seen inside, or nearly disappear. If you look closely at the show\u2019s lighting map, you\u2019ll get a sense of the Holosphere\u2019s sheer scale. That tiny gray stick figure standing inside? It\u2019s Prydz.\n\nGetting rid of holographic trickery seemed like the next logical step for EPIC, says Prydz\u2019s longtime collaborator Mark Calvert from London-based tech company Realtime Environment Systems (RES). \u201cAll these [EPIC] shows have been amazing,\u201d he says, \u201cbut at the end of the day they were two-dimensional projections.\u201d Using a physical sphere not only provides actual depth but will let the audience see the Holosphere\u2019s larger-than-life visuals from all sorts of different angles without any distortion.\n\nSeventy-two handmade panels in varying shapes interlock onto a metal skeleton to construct the Holosphere, and they\u2019re laced with LEDs both inside and out. Light Initiative founder Bryn Williams designed the panels to be modular, so if an LED fails, the individual strip can be popped out and replaced within seconds.\n\nAt a warehouse in London, Williams has me help assemble a panel: I peel off an LED strip\u2019s backing, stick it into a custom plastic extrusion with raised sides, and then snap the strip in tiny grooves that run along the panel. There are big gaps between each strip, so the sphere has a lower resolution than most traditional LED panels. But that won\u2019t be noticeable from far away. That space is crucial to trick the eye into thinking the sphere is \u201ctransparent,\u201d allowing audiences to both see animations displayed on the sphere and Prydz DJing inside of it.\n\nA sphere sounds simple enough, but bringing the Holosphere to life was a difficult endeavor. Any show has to hang or sit on something, and a stage can only handle a certain amount of weight. Temporary structures, like the ones at Tomorrowland, generally support less weight than permanent ones, like an arena or stadium. Williams\u2019 design weighs five tons, but it splits the load in two to deal with this constraint: the weight of the sphere\u2019s upper half is supported by four dumbbell-sized bolts affixed to the roof, while the bottom half is supported by the stage.\n\nEric Prydz\u2019s Holosphere by the numbers 8 meters wide\n\n72 panels\n\n2.4 million LEDs\n\n223 different lengths of LED strips\n\n301 square meters of LED panels\n\n17,840 LED strips\n\n16 millimeter pixel pitch\n\n5 tons of weight\n\n150 individual laser diodes\n\n545 lighting fixtures\n\nWilliams says he had two primary goals in designing the Holosphere\u2019s architecture \u2014 create something that could withstand being knocked around, and if something fails, keep the failure localized. \u201cIt needed to be robust to stop problems from happening,\u201d he says, \u201cand resilient to stop a problem from cascading.\u201d Every LED strip has been stress tested by alternating them between hot and cold temperatures, and the test panel dropped from different heights to see when it will deform or break. \u201cIt\u2019s had a proper bashing,\u201d says Williams with a grin.\n\nThe physical sphere is only half the story. There\u2019s also the animations, lighting, and visual effects, all of which bring the Holosphere to life. Throughout the course of the show, the sphere\u2019s original animations will include everything from the tiniest of molecules to immense galactic forms. At the RES office, designer and VJ Liam Tomaszewski shows me some of what he\u2019s been working on: there\u2019s a burnt orange Mars-like planet, what can only be described as a sparkling disco Death Star, and a wonderfully grotesque eyeball.\n\nWhile the sphere is being built, Tomaszewski creates the Holosphere\u2019s mind-bending animations using a mishmash of Cinema 4D, Houdini, Maya, and Adobe After Effects, along with \u201chundreds of plug-ins and different tools.\u201d Off the bat, many of his animations from previous EPIC shows had to be tossed because they were created for flat surfaces. Wrapping a flat image on a sphere mangles and pinches things, so he learned how to animate with spherical distortion using a method called equirectangular projection. \u201dIt caused a lot of headaches,\u201d Tomaszewski says. \u201cThis is a really scary project from a content perspective because I don\u2019t get to fall back on some of the tricks that I know work.\u201d\n\nHolosphere animations are projected on a yoga ball for testing\n\nTo demonstrate the difference, Tomaszewski loads up the eyeball on screen. As a sphere, the realism is both amazing and instinctually off-putting. It darts about frenetically, with a slight wetness on its surface, and curls of small, pinkish veins that creep around the sides. He recorded his own pupil for this, tracking its motion in Adobe After Effects to make the animation as lifelike as possible.\n\nThen, he shows me the flat version. It\u2019s the same image, but it\u2019s almost unrecognizable. Fleshy and smooshed, the image is more reminiscent of roadkill than a human eye. \u201cTrying to get my head around creating content within that world was a real challenge,\u201d Tomaszewski says of animating for a sphere.\n\nWhen I visit in June, there\u2019s no Holosphere for Tomaszewski to see his work on, so to test ideas, he projects animations on a yoga ball. It\u2019s not the real thing, but seeing the work in three dimensions makes a difference. Sometimes what looks great on his screen doesn\u2019t translate once it\u2019s on the yoga ball. Other times, like with the eyeball, it looks even better. \u201cWhether people define it as an actual hologram or not is up to them,\u201d Tomaszewski says, \u201cbut we\u2019re just trying to do what we can to create visuals in three dimensions. I don\u2019t know anybody who\u2019s created three-dimensional visuals and displayed them in three dimensions.\u201d\n\nThe sphere will be front and center, but it\u2019s only one component of the show. It\u2019s also flanked by two massive video screens that jut out from behind. And when it comes to lighting, designer Ross Chapple has stacked the stage with over 500 fixtures that give him an array of sharp, directional effects including 150 individual laser diodes, lamp beams, and LED bars that spoke out from around the center. The bars are on motors and can move up and down around the sphere, like the curve of a manta ray\u2019s fin. There\u2019s also a lighting rig at the top of the sphere that will lower inside and strobe to look like a \u201cnucleus exploding.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes I wish I was in the crowd.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s even more incredible is that everything during the show is done live. Big shows like this are usually synced with timecode with portions pre-mixed to ensure certain visuals, fireworks, and other effects happen at precise moments in songs. But Prydz insists on improvising during EPIC shows. To make this happen requires a bit of intuition from everyone involved and some additional tech. First, cameras over the crowd feed to video monitors beside Prydz while he performs. All of the lights blur his view from the stage, so this lets him see audience reactions and decide what to play next. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t realize that with the technology that we\u2019ve been using, it\u2019s very hard for me to see through these sort of things from the inside out,\u201d he says. \u201cOne of the worst things about doing these shows is that the one person who this is all done around can\u2019t see the bloody show ... Sometimes I wish I was in the crowd.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Tomaszewski and Chapple work in tandem in a front of house booth during the show. They know every Prydz song inside and out but have no idea when any of them will be played. Some songs are always paired with certain animations and effects, and others allow for experimentation. When they hear Prydz mixing in the next track, they immediately cue up animations and lighting schemes in response.\n\nAs a result, no two EPIC shows are the same. \u201cI would just be so bored, and I would never get away with it,\u201d says Prydz when I ask why he does EPIC live. \u201cIf I even played two or three of the same tracks in a row, someone would say, \u2018You did that two years ago at this show in Pennsylvania,\u2019 or \u2018You\u2019ve lost it now. You\u2019re getting lazy.\u2019\u201d The audience holds him to a high standard, but more simply, he doesn\u2019t understand why any DJ would plan everything ahead of time. \u201cI can\u2019t see how preparing a full set in a quiet hotel room while eating a club sandwich and having the TV on in the background, is going to resonate with the people at the festival you\u2019re playing, or the club. I don\u2019t believe that exists.\u201d\n\nPrydz and his team have no idea if there will be other Holosphere dates. For now, they\u2019re only concerned about making sure everything is set for the show\u2019s debut. At Tomorrowland, two years of work will result in a two-hour visual extravaganza, setting a new goalpost not just for Prydz, but the entire industry. He\u2019s excited to see their \u201cnearly impossible idea\u201d come to life and hopes the people watching are as wowed by the sphere as he is. \u201cIt\u2019s fun to see how far you can push it,\u201d he says with a smile, \u201chow extreme you can make things, and how you can come up with ideas that people haven\u2019t seen or experienced before. Then, the joy of seeing people going absolutely crazy over it is an amazing feeling.\u201d", "description": "At Tomorrowland, Eric Prydz will stand inside a glowing sphere that\u2019s more than two stories tall as he performs in front of a crowd of thousands.
