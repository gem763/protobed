It's safe. I mean, sure, why not?\u201d Trump said when asked whether Powell's job were safe during a Fox News interview conducted in California alongside a section of border wall.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAsked why he hesitated as he offered his assessment of Powell\u2019s professional prospects, Trump responded: \u201cNo, I don't pause. I mean, he's got a job. And, you know, I'm disappointed in him. I'm very disappointed in him.\u201d\n\nTrump has long insisted he has the authority to fire Powell, whom he nominated last fall to replace former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen. Powell, in turn, has said Trump cannot dismiss him and that he intends to serve his full term as chairman.\n\nThe president\u2019s statements came after the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates a quarter-point on Wednesday but did not explicitly signal that another cut was forthcoming, provoking Trump to ridicule Powell on Twitter as a \u201cterrible communicator\u201d with \u201cNo 'guts,' no sense, no vision!\u201d\n\nTrump kept up those criticisms in his Fox News interview, remarking that he does not think Powell \u201cknows how to play the game very well.\u201d The president also renewed his complaints about U.S. interest rates in relation to those of other countries, while touting the strength of the American economy.\n\n\u201cI think we should do more because other countries have done more. If you look at Germany, if you look at Japan, if you look at so many others, they're cutting much more,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cIn fact, they're borrowing money and getting paid to borrow money, and we're paying interest \u2014 and we're the most prime in the world,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe have this great economy. We're doing better than we've ever done. \u2026 But we should be cutting. There's no inflation.\u201d", "description": "But the president again expressed his disappointment in the central bank chief.", "authors": ["Quint Forgey"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/99/c8/494bedab41d492e251138b349983/190919-donald-trump-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
