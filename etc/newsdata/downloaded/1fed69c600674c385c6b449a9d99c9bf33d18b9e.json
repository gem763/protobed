In July, the office of the financial stability and development committee under the State Council, China's Cabinet, announced the full removal of foreign ownership caps in those sectors in 2020.\n\nA number of foreign financial institutions have taken the advantage of the nation's opening-up policies since 2018. The CSRC has approved applications from Swiss bank UBS Group, JPMorgan based in the United States and Japanese financial group Nomura to take control of securities ventures in China, while US-based Goldman Sachs and Japan-based Daiwa Securities are seeking approvals.\n\n\"Foreign investment in the sectors of securities, asset management and insurance will see rapid growth in the next few years as China further opens up the financial sector,\" said Zhang Xiaotao, dean of the School of International Economics and Trade at the Central University of Finance and Economics.\n\nChina's asset management industry boasts a giant market and high growth potential, providing numerous opportunities for foreign financial institutions, Zhang said.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/12/5da0e774a310cf3e97a0c171.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
