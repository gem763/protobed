Michael Bennet said he hopes the FBI will conduct a more thorough investigation in light of new allegations tied to Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, while stopping short of some of his 2020 Democratic presidential rivals\u2019 explicit calls to impeach the associate justice.\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t believe he should have been on the court to begin with. I voted against him,\u201d the Colorado Democrat said Sunday evening on MSNBC. \u201cBut I do think we need to have due process here. We can\u2019t give up on that.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times reported on Saturday that none of the witnesses referred to the FBI by the legal team of Deborah Ramirez, who has accused Justice Kavanaugh of thrusting his penis at her at a party when they were at Yale, were ultimately interviewed.\n\nThe paper on Sunday also added a clarification to the article, which was adapted from a forthcoming book, saying that a separate unnamed female student who allegedly experienced a similar incident declined to be interviewed and that friends say she does not recall the incident.\n\nJustice Kavanaugh has repeatedly denied claims of sexual misconduct and improper behavior that became a central part of his confirmation process last year.\n\n\u201cWe know that there are a number of people that were not interviewed,\u201d Mr. Bennet said. \u201cAnd I think they should be interviewed. And I think that the Senate and the House should see what the results of that investigation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we are discovering now is that the FBI should have conducted the investigation that was warranted at the time,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd as you have reported, there were more than 20 witnesses that were named that were never interviewed by the FBI.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if that was entirely the FBI\u2019s fault, because the schedule, you know, was so short that the committee had agreed upon,\u201d he added. \u201cBut that\u2019s what should have been done to begin with. And I hope that\u2019s what will be done now.\u201d\n\nSeveral of Mr. Bennet\u2019s Democratic presidential rivals, such as Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kamala D. Harris of California, have called for Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment in light of the new report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
