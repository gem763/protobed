On Saturday he said that if those talks did not produce a solution, Turkey would \"implement its own plans\".\n\nTurkey's defence ministry earlier accused Kurdish forces of carrying out 14 \"provocative\" attacks in the last 36 hours, mostly in Ras Al-Ain, but insisted Turkish forces were fully abiding by the agreement.\n\nHowever, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) accused Turkey of violating the ceasefire.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Turkish-backed Syrian rebels are still active along the border\n\nThey also accuse Turkish troops of failing to create a safe corridor for the evacuation of civilians and wounded people from the besieged town.\n\nOn Saturday the SDF urged US Vice-President Mike Pence, who helped to broker the temporary ceasefire, to pressure Turkey to allow the passage of civilians.\n\n\"Despite the constant communication with the American side and the promise made by them to solve this problem, there has not been any tangible progress in this regard,\" the SDF said in a statement.\n\nThe UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) alleges that deliveries of humanitarian aid have also been prevented from entering Ras Al-Ain.\n\nThe monitor group said on Friday that the civilian death toll from the Turkish operation had now risen to 86.\n\nBetween 160,000 and 300,000 people have reportedly fled their homes since the offensive started 10 days ago.\n\nWhat prompted the offensive?\n\nTurkish forces first launched their assault on 9 October, following an announcement US troops would withdraw from the Syria-Turkey border region.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's Martin Patience explains what's behind the conflict\n\nPresident Erdogan's operation aims to push Kurdish fighters away from northernmost Syria and create a 20 mile (32km) safe zone for resettling up to two million Syrian refugees currently in Turkey.\n\nThe goal was to push back a Kurdish militia group - the People's Protection Units (YPG) - that Turkey views as a terrorist organisation.\n\nTurkey had hoped to resettle up to two million Syrian refugees in the border area, but critics warned that could trigger ethnic cleansing of the local Kurdish population.\n\nSince the offensive was launched, President Donald Trump has been accused by some, including senior Republicans, of abandoning a US ally. The SDF - a group dominated by the YPG - fought alongside the US against the Islamic State (IS) group in Syria.\n\nThere has been growing international concern about possible war crimes committed by Turkey and allied militias during the offensive.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Mike Pence announces Turkish ceasefire in Syria\n\nAmnesty International says it has gathered \"damning evidence\" of war crimes and other violations by their side and the United Nations has called on Turkey to investigate the allegations.\n\nUnconfirmed reports have also emerged that Turkish-allied forces have used white phosphorus, a chemical weapon which causes bad burns, in Syria.\n\nThe Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said it was aware of the claims and was gathering evidence.\n\nWhat is the latest with the ceasefire?\n\nThe pause in hostilities followed talks in the Turkish capital Ankara between Mr Erdogan and Mr Pence on Thursday.\n\nPresident Trump celebrated news of the ceasefire and claimed the pause in hostilities would lead to \"millions of lives\" being saved. He remained optimistic in comments made on Friday, despite reports the ceasefire was failing to hold.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption President Trump on Turkish and Kurdish forces: \"Sometimes you have to let them fight a little bit\"\n\nSDF spokesman Mustafa Bali tweeted on Friday morning to allege that Turkey was breaking the ceasefire near Ras al-Ain.\n\n\"Despite the agreement to halt the fighting, air and artillery attacks continue to target the positions of fighters, civilian settlements and the hospital,\" he wrote.\n\nPresident Erdogan dismissed reports of continuing clashes on Friday as \"misinformation\" but international news media recorded explosions in Ras al-Ain during the morning.\n\nThe SOHR said Saturday that the SDF had not yet started to pull back from the border region.\n\nLocal Kurdish media are reporting that five civilians and 13 Kurdish fighters in Ras-al-Ain have been killed since the ceasefire began, but the BBC has not been able to independently confirm that.", "description": "The Turkish president says Kurdish-led forces must withdraw under the terms of a temporary truce.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4D25/production/_109294791_057396241.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
