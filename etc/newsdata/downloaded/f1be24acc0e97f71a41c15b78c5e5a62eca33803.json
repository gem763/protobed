The new tariffs are to take effect as early as Oct. 18.\n\nThe U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s Office said it would \u201ccontinually re-evaluate these tariffs based on our discussions with the EU\u201d and expects to enter talks in a bid to resolve the dispute.", "description": "", "authors": ["Reuters.Com Article Us-Wto-Aircraft-Drink-Food"], "top_image": ""}
