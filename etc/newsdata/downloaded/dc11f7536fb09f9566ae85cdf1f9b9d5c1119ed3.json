The Dow is up 42% since the 2016 presidential election and 31% since his inauguration.\n\nIt's down 1.6% since May 5, however, when the president shocked financial markets by announcing on Twitter that he would increase tariffs of 10% on $200 billion to 25%, dashing hopes that the world's two largest economies were nearing a trade resolution.\n\nSince then, Trump's go-to report card for a strong economy has been far more volatile as his protectionist trade policies and trade war with China take an ever-growing toll on American business sentiment, capital expenditure and the stock market.\n\nTrump doubled down on his tough trade stance on Tuesday, tweeting \"We are doing very well in our negotiations with China. While I am sure they would love to be dealing with a new administration so they could continue their practice of 'ripoff USA'($600 B/year),16 months PLUS is a long time to be hemorrhaging jobs and companies on a long-shot.\"\n\n\"And then, think what happens to China when I win. Deal would get MUCH TOUGHER!\" he added.\n\nThe Dow was down more than 350 points at 12:55 p.m. ET on Tuesday.", "description": "Days when President Donald Trump tweets a lot are associated with negative stock market returns, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said Tuesday.", "authors": ["Thomas Franck"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104356975-RTX322QW.jpg?v=1567527330"}
