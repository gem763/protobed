Thirty people, including the driver, were on the bus when it \"ran off the road and rolled into the guardrail,\" the Garfield County Sheriff's Office said in a statement.\n\nBetween 12 and 15 passengers suffered \"very critical injuries\" and 10 passengers had minor to serious injuries, the Utah Highway Patrol said. All the injured passengers were taken to area hospitals, including several by helicopter, the highway patrol said.\n\nAbout a dozen passengers suffered critical injuries during the crash. CNN has obscured parts of this image because the condition of the victims could not be verified.\n\nPhotos provided by the highway patrol showed first responders treating passengers on the road, just feet away from the heavily damaged bus. Hours after the crash, the remains of the bus were still resting on the guardrail, surrounded by debris and with its top smashed in.\n\nEmployees of the nearby Bryce Canyon Resort told CNN their manager was called to crash scene to assist first responders with translating for the Chinese tour group. The manager is one of the few Chinese speakers in the area, the hotel staff said.\n\nRead More", "description": "At least four people were killed after a tour bus was involved in a crash near Bryce Canyon National Park, the Utah Highway Patrol said.", "authors": ["Nicole Chavez", "Hollie Silverman"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190920161359-02-bryce-canyon-tour-bus-crash-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
