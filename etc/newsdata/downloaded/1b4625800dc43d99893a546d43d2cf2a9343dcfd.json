Ives calls the price a \u201cmajor shot across the bow at the likes of Netflix and Disney, among others.\u201d (Netflix and Disney shares both dropped after Apple announced its Apple TV+ pricing.)\n\nJack Roberts, an options trader with Simpler Trading, only half agrees. He is short on Netflix (NFLX) due to competitive threats (and, worth noting, bearish on the overall markets in the near-term due to trade tensions). But he likes Disney\u2019s streaming outlook.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook on stage at the Sept. 10 Apple event in Cupertino, Calif., introducing Apple TV+ pricing and launch details. More\n\nDisney+ (DIS) will \u201cadd about 10 million subscribers overnight,\u201d Roberts predicts, and \u201cis going to take significant share away from Netflix. We\u2019ve already seen Netflix taking a huge hit... I think we\u2019ll see Disney popping and going to higher highs, and Netflix slowly bleeding.\u201d\n\nThe $4.99 price point for Apple TV+ is \u201cvery competitive, very strategic on Apple\u2019s part,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cRight now it is a grab for the gold. Netflix is spending so much to create content, and some could argue a lot of their content is actually diluted. Apple is doing everything they can to be competitive\u2014and they know the storm is coming here in fall of 2019.\u201d\n\nGraphic by David Foster/Yahoo Finance More\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that many banks and analysts, for now, sound bullish on both Netflix and Disney+ in the near term, and don\u2019t buy the popular framing of one vs. the other. Many don\u2019t see Apple TV+ as a risk to Netflix or Disney, despite its appealing low price. (The service has only touted five big original shows so far.)\n\n\u201cWe don't see Apple TV+ in its current form as likely to disrupt Netflix's positioning,\u201d write Bank of America analysts in a new note. \u201cWe believe that there will be only a handful of players who will be able sustain a global chase for OTT subscribers and think Netflix's incumbency and growth outlook remain secure, amid a massive lead on the competition.\u201d\n\nCredit Suisse chart on Disney+ outlook, Sept. 11, 2019 More\n\nAnd Credit Suisse, in its latest survey, finds investors so bullish on Disney+ that expectations for subscribers have doubled since Disney Investor Day back in April.\n\n\u2014\n\nDaniel Roberts is a senior writer at Yahoo Finance and closely covers streaming tech.
