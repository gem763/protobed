I was in my dressing room a few minutes ago. I was a bit tired this morning.\n\n\"I was doing my tie in the mirror and I thought 'I haven't shaved'. Every morning, shower, shave. I was like 'how can I forget to shave?'.\"\n\nPiers realised he could not \"get away\" with a slight stubble and had to use an emergency electric razor.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nSusanna said: \"I thought we were going to start the programme without you here and people would think the petition to get rid of Piers Morgan had succeeded. But there were actually more signatures on the petition to save you.\"\n\nPiers boasted that he was trending in US and UK and Susanna admitted it was only feeding his ego.\n\nShe advised: \"If you hate Piers Morgan, the idea is not to make him trend over the world. He has an ego the size of the London Eye. A little tip from my book, I'e worked with him for a few years, ignore him. You'd do so much better.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nPiers vowed that the haters would never get him taken off air and had actually boosted his salary.\n\nHe warned: \"You're not going to get rid of me. I don't think they've really worked this through.\n\n\"They think making me trend worldwide for two days, making me the most talked about breakfast presenter in the world, will get rid of me.\n\n\"Let me tell you what you've done. You've helped me get a payrise. Cheers everybody.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nGood Morning Britain viewers flocked to Twitter - with most backing the #SavePiers campaign.\n\nOne fan said: \"They can't sack piers!!! My 7 year old thinks piers is brave and just talks the truth.\"\n\n\"If that petition would have succeeded then your show would no longer,\" added another.\n\nA third said: \"You can't fire #piersmorgan, he's the only one that makes it worth turning the TV on so early in the morning. Oh and Laura who does the weather.\"\n\n\"So we don't have to respect the will of the people!? Great! I look forward to seeing piers at the people's vote march on Saturday,\" said a fourth.\n\n*Good Morning Britain airs weekdays on ITV at 6am", "description": "Susanna Reid thought the controversial petition to sack her Good Morning Britain co-host had succeeded", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20589084.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_RLP_MDG_18571JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
