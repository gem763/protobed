She is the only school counsellor for the four hundred students at Kelvyn Park. \u201cThis still isn\u2019t a big caseload, compared to some schools, but it feels like a lot,\u201d she told me. Her duties also include administering Advanced Placement tests, helping students who are applying to college fill out financial forms, and planning graduation.\n\nSome students knock on her door to talk about troubles they\u2019re having in class, but others have problems that are beyond her ability to solve. Maybe one parent lives in Chicago and works long hours, and the other lives in Mexico. Or a student has experienced trauma but lacks the know-how to process it. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to live without getting any sort of treatment for it, and we\u2019re not in a position to do intensive therapy,\u201d Andrick said. The school has two social workers and a part-time psychologist, but it\u2019s never enough. Too often, when she refers a student to a clinic for therapy, the waiting list is long or the family has no health insurance and can\u2019t pay.\n\nAs Andrick was describing the situation, Stacy Hopp, the school\u2019s case manager for special education, joined us. Every day, she sees the gaps that the C.T.U. negotiating teams are trying to fill. Approximately one in every four students at Kelvyn Park is identified as a special-education student, and each of them needs a learning plan and meetings with a parent present. The school is down two special-education teachers, and Hopp teaches three classes. In one of them, where she partners with a general-education English teacher, there are thirty-five students. \u201cWhen they all show up,\u201d she said, \u201cwe don\u2019t have enough chairs.\u201d\n\nThe school hosts a vision clinic, Hopp said, because \u201ckids are squinting, and they don\u2019t have parents who can take them, and they don\u2019t have insurance, so we do it here.\u201d There are children with underlying health issues, including diabetes and asthma, and she would like a nurse to be stationed at the school more than one day a week. (Lightfoot\u2019s team has offered a full-time nurse and social worker for every school, every day.) \u201cWe have pregnant girls who come to me and ask questions, like, \u2018You\u2019ve had a baby. Tell me about it,\u2019 \u201d Hopp said. Veronica Jara, who teaches English as a second language, co\u00f6rdinates bilingual education, and serves as the school\u2019s athletic director, told me, \u201cWhen they get sick, they ask, \u2018Can I go to the nurse?\u2019 And I have to say, \u2018The nurse isn\u2019t here today.\u2019 \u201d", "description": "What school life is like for some students in Chicago.", "authors": ["Valerie Strauss", "Reporter Covering Education", "Foreign Affairs"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/3LfCc-dpHRq2nT-HssoZxVppX0k=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/276YDQHZTYI6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
