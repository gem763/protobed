Join the conversation below.\n\nThe polls also mark a milestone for the AfD. After becoming the largest opposition party in the federal parliament two years ago, it has now established itself as a dominant force in Germany\u2019s former Communist East\u2014though not the largest, as some pollsters had predicted.\n\nThis means the economic divide between the former East and West, which persists almost 30 years after the country\u2019s reunification, has evolved to a political divide.\n\nAccording to exit polls by Infratest Dimap, the AfD scored 23.5% of the vote in Brandenburg and 27.9% in Saxony, making it the second-largest party in both states. By contrast, opinion polls put it at 12% to 13% nationwide, around its 12.6% score at the 2017 national election.\n\nMs. Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union was on track to win the election in Saxony with 32.4% of the vote, according the exit polls. The CDU has dominated that state for decades, but appears to be falling short of the 39.4% it won in the last election in 2014. The center-left Social Democrats, which govern at the national level as junior partners to the CDU, has ruled the state of Brandenburg since reunification, but exit polls indicated it garnered 26.2% of the vote, compared with winning 31.9% in the last election.\n\nLike the AfD, the Greens appeared to vastly improve their showing in the Sunday elections, leaving the ruling government parties squeezed from both ends of the political spectrum. Exit polls indicate the Greens are receiving 10.8% in Brandenberg and 8.4% and Saxony, compared with receiving 6.2% and 5.7%, respectively, in the prior elections.\n\nAnother Eastern state, Thuringia, is also holding elections on Oct. 27, and polls are predicting a similar outcome, with the AfD in contention for the top spot.\n\nMs. Kramp-Karrenbauer is in the pole position to lead the CDU ticket at the next election. But since being tapped by Ms. Merkel, her party received 6.5 percentage points less in May\u2019s European Parliament elections from the previous voting and dropped in national polls as more centrist voters moved to the Greens. Now, that has been followed the apparent sagging showing in the Eastern states.\n\nHer trajectory since her election as party chairwoman last December has begun to raise questions within the party about her fitness to lead the CDU ticket at the next election, which will take place in 2021 at the latest, according to senior party figures.\n\nMs. Kramp-Karrenbauer was not available for a comment; she is expected to make a statement on Monday.\n\nAfter Ms. Merkel\u2019s 2015 decision to welcome almost two million, mainly Muslim, refugees into the country, the Eastern states, which are relatively homogenous ethnically, began embracing the AfD\u2019s nativist, antiestablishment and pro-Russian messages in larger numbers.\n\nThe former East Germany, home to about a fifth of the country\u2019s population, remains comparatively poorer despite receiving two trillions euros in subsidies from the West since reunification in 1990.\n\nMs. Merkel, who herself grew up in Soviet-controlled East Germany, has become a controversial figure in the East, prompting politicians from her own party, such as Saxony State Premier Michael Kretschmer, to distance themselves from her policies.\n\nThe AfD\u2019s campaign appropriated slogans from the 1989 pro-democracy movement, portraying Ms. Merkel\u2019s 14-year-long reign as a betrayal of the interests of the East.\n\nTo fight back, Mr. Kretschmer went as far as to travel to Russia in June for a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, where the state premier said he discussed economic issues and the crisis in Ukraine. He then invited Mr. Putin to visit him in the state capital of Dresden, where the Russian president, a German speaker, once served as an officer of the Soviet intelligence agency KGB.\n\nBack in Germany, Mr. Kretschmer defied his party\u2019s official policy by demanding an end to the sanctions against Russia that were enforced by the West after the Kremlin annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea in 2014.\n\nMs. Kramp-Karenbauer pushed back against Mr. Kretschmer\u2019s demands, defending the sanctions as a necessary response to Mr. Putin\u2019s aggression.\n\n\u201cThose who are now wagging their finger should know that there is an independent opinion on this matter in the eastern German states, and that opinion is equal to any other opinion,\u201d Mr. Kretschmer responded in an interview with regional public broadcaster MDR.\n\nWrite to Bojan Pancevski at bojan.pancevski@wsj.com", "description": "Germany\u2019s anti-immigration Alternative for Germany, or AfD, appeared headed for strong gains at regional elections on Sunday, dealing a blow to efforts by Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s conservative bloc to reclaim votes lost to both the right and the center-left Greens.", "authors": ["Bojan Pancevski", "Bojan.Pancevski Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103209/social"}
