But now, they think they look beautiful without them.\"\n\nMu admits that the rings, which weigh around 10kg, were uncomfortable when they were fitted when she was nine and they took several hours for them to be put on.\n\nShe adds: \u201cThe rings choked me and felt too tight at first. Food would get stuck when I tried to swallow. I had to stretch my neck to eat. But I got used to it.\"\n\nFor her there is no other way, as she adds: \u201cI\u2019ll wear them until I die and have them buried with me.\"\n\n(Image: Newsflare)\n\n(Image: Newsflare)\n\nMuu Pley, 23, felt very different about the rings and took them off 13 years after having them fitted over fears that her neck would grow too long.\n\nMuu, who had the rings fitted when she was seven, said they were painful and that she felt \"so free and so light\" when they were gone.\n\nThe practice now faces an uncertain future with only a few hundred women believed to now be following the tradition.\n\nPascal says many of the women who do wear them often do due to economic pressures as tourists flock to see the 'long-necked' women.\n\nMum-of-two Muu Pley is among them and says she decided to put the rings back on following a tourism boom in the village.\n\n(Image: Newsflare)\n\n(Image: Newsflare)\n\nDocumentary maker Lorna MacMillan, who spent five months conducting field research with Thailand's Kayan tribe, said the belief the women's neck's would collapse if the rings were removed was incorrect.\n\nSpeaking during a National Geographic documentary Suffering for Tradition: Taboo: Body Moification , she said: \"Contrary to many beliefs it doesn't actually support the head, so it's not so tight that it doesn't allow the neck a lot of movement.\n\n\"In fact women can reach their hands down and clean their skin so it's not actually something that's gripping them in any way.\"\n\nLorna, who worked jointly with Francisco Nanclares as a University of California, Berkeley, Haas scholar, said the ring would typically come off during child birth, a doctor's visit or if the woman is caught committing adultery.", "description": "The neck-rings have been part of an ancient tradition among female members of the Kayan group native to Kayah State in Myanmar", "authors": ["Rachel Endley", "Image", "Newsflare"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20560102.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Chiang-Mai.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
