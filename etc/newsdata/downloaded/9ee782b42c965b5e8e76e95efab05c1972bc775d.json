As a member of the Nationals, Harper was involved in a brawl when Strickland pitched for the San Francisco Giants in 2017. Harper also hit two homers off Strickland in the 2014 playoffs.\n\nOn this night, Harper went deep again against Strickland, with his solo shot pulling the Phillies to within 6-5\n\nBut Washington right-hander Daniel Hudson, acquired in a trade in late July with Toronto, came on in the ninth and got the last three outs.\n\nVictor Robles caught a liner for the last out in D.C. as Hudson got the save. The celebration began at Navy Yard after the Pirates made their final out against the Cubs; the ending of that game was shown on the outfield video board at Nationals Park.\n\nScherzer (11-7) gave up a three-run homer to Brad Miller in the first inning and Miller went deep for a solo shot in the fourth to gives the Phillies a 4-1 lead.\n\nThe ace right-hander gave up four runs in six innings but struck out 10 batters for the 93rd time in his career.\n\nWashington catcher Yan Gomes hit a solo homer in the third inning to trim the lead to 3-1 against Phillies starter Aaron Nola. Gomes then had a sacrifice fly in the fourth to cut the Phillies advantage to 4-2 against Nola (12-7), who yielded five runs in 5 2/3 innings.\n\nWashington won the first game of the twinbill, 4-1, to knock the Phillies out of postseason consideration.\n\nWashington (88-69) has won 12 of 17 games this season against the Phillies but was 2-4 against the Brewers. Milwaukee holds the tiebreaker if the teams end up with the same record and would host the wild card game in that scenario.\n\nThe series continues Wednesday at 7:05 p.m. with Anibal Sanchez (10-8, 3.91 ERA) pitching for Washington against lefty Drew Smyly (4-7, 6.44) of the Phillies.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
