As you will see from the extensive text messages I am providing, which convey a sense of real-time dialogue with several different actors, Vice President Biden was never a topic of discussion.\n\nVolker even defended Biden against accusations of Ukraine-linked corruption, saying:\n\nI have known former Vice President Biden for 24 years, and the suggestion that he would be influenced in his duties as Vice President by money for his son simply has no credibility to me. I know him as a man of integrity and dedication to our country.\n\nThe Democrat leaders seeking Trump\u2019s impeachment, however, released some of the texts to support their claim that Volker helped Trump coerce Ukraine into investigating Biden.\n\nReps. Elijah Cummings (D-MD), Adam Schiff (D-CA), and Eliot Engel (D-NY) conceded that the texts were \u201conly a subset of the full body of materials\u201d they received from Volker.\n\nHouse Democrats refuse to release the full transcripts of the more than eight hours of testimony provided by Volker on Thursday. Breitbart News\u2019s requests for comment on this story and releasing the full transcripts went unanswered.\n\nVolker\u2019s prepared remarks suggest the Democrats mischaracterized the texts.In particular, a text about a statement Volker and Sondland were helping Ukraine draft.\n\nVolker said Andrey Yermak requested assistance in penning a statement to express Ukraine\u2019s commitments to combatting corruption.\n\nYermak is a close aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who was expected to issue the statement.\n\nThe ultimate aim of the statement was to convince Trump to meet with Zelensky, but the Urkainian president never delivered it.\n\nThe Democrat leaders cited a July 19 text from Volker to make it seem as if the former envoy was briefing the Ukrainian president on what to tell president Trump during the July 25 call that triggered the impeachment inquiry.\n\nIn his prepared remarks, Volker indicated that the July 19 text was about the statement they were helping Ukraine draft, not about the call.\n\nVolker explicitly says that as of July 24, \u201cI still did not know whether or when such a call [between Trump and Zelensky] was to be scheduled \u2026\u201d\n\nThe Democrats introduced the text saying, \u201cOn July 19, 2019, Ambassador Volker, Ambassador Sondland, and Mr. Taylor had the following exchange about the specific goal for the upcoming telephone call between President Trump and the Ukrainian president.\u201d\n\nVolker said in the text:\n\nGood. Had breakfast with Rudy this morning \u2014 teeing up call w Yermak Monday. Must have helped. Most [important] is for Zelensky to say that he will help investigation \u2014 and address any specific personal issues \u2014 if any.\n\nAgain, Volker said he was referring to a statement Zelensky was expected to issue, but never did.\n\nThe former envoy stressed in his written testimony that the statement was never intended to mention former VP Biden.\n\nInstead, it was expected to focus on an investigation into 2016 U.S. election meddling by local Ukrainians and the domestic energy company Burisma Holdings.\n\nVolker emphasized that the statement was ultimately \u201cshelved\u201d because he wanted \u201cUkraine [to] do nothing that could be seen as interfering in the 2020 elections.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, Biden pressured Ukraine to remove its top prosecutor. At the time, his son was serving on the board of Burisma \u2014 whose owner, Mykola Zlochevsky, had been under investigation by the fired prosecutor, prompting allegations of corruption.\n\nAn intelligence community \u201cwhistleblower\u201d recently claimed that Trump attempted to pressure his Ukrainian counterpart Zelensky into investigating Trump and his son, threatening to withhold foreign aid.\n\nThe U.S. President denies the allegations. Nevertheless, the \u201cwhistleblower\u2019s\u201d claims have triggered the ongoing impeachment inquiry.\n\nRepublicans have accused their rivals of cherry-picking the texts they chose to release.\n\nThis unilateral and cherry-picked release by the Democrats is a desperate attempt to further their failing impeachment narrative and skew the story. This information cannot possibly be understood without Volker\u2019s explanations from today\u2019s testimony. https://t.co/1WFsazEtEa \u2014 Oversight Committee Republicans (@GOPoversight) October 4, 2019\n\nThey say Volker\u2019s testimony failed to advance the Democrat\u2019s impeachment agenda.\n\nVolker resigned last week amid the impeachment investigation.", "description": "Prepared remarks by the first impeachment inquiry witness indicate House Democrat leaders cherry-picked and mischaracterized texts he provided", "authors": ["Edwin Mora"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Kurt-Volker-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
