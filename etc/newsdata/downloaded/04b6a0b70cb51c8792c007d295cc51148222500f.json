Adam Schiff (D-CA), are using the same tacit they used in 2017 to silence then-chair Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) with a phony ethics investigation. They are having witnesses testify in deposition, rather than in public or by transcription, which invokes ethics rules that prevent members from sharing any details publicly. Democrats then leak selective bits of testimony \u2014 and any Republicans who dare respond risk an ethics investigation that will silence them and damage them politically.\n\nYork observed:\n\nFriday\u2019s interview of Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, marked a new point \u2014 a low point, as Republicans see it \u2014 in Democratic efforts to keep impeachment information out of public view. \u2026 The Yovanovitch session was different. Democrats conducted the interview in the format of a deposition, which is different from a transcribed interview. One key difference is that there are serious penalties for lawmakers who reveal the contents of a deposition. Doing so would almost surely subject the offending member to a House ethics investigation. \u2026 Here is the clever part, from the Democratic perspective. As the Yovanovitch interview began, her 10-page opening statement quickly leaked. In it, Yovanovitch made her case for all the press to read.\n\nYovanovitch is known to have testified that President Trump relieved her of her post, and that he did so because of what she says is misleading information from sources with their own agendas. But no one knows if that claim has anything to do with the president\u2019s July 25 phone call with the president of Ukraine. Nor does anyone know if the reason for which she was ostensibly fired \u2014 namely, that she was bad-mouthing Trump abroad \u2014 is actually true.\n\nAs York concludes:\n\nIn his much-criticized letter to Congress, White House counsel Pat Cipollone said Democratic handling of the impeachment investigation \u201cviolates fundamental fairness.\u201d He meant fairness toward the target of the proceeding, President Trump. But there is also the question of fairness toward the American people trying to follow an impeachment process shrouded in secrecy. Don\u2019t they have the right to know what the president\u2019s accusers say?\n\nRead York\u2019s full column in the Washington Examiner here.\n\nJoel B.
