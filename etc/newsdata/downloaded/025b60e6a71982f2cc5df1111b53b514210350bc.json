Jonathan explained the type of \"quirky\" woman he's attracted to, and honestly, it sounds exactly like Deschanel.\n\n\"[She\u2019d be] somebody who\u2019s articulate, has a great sense of humor and a fun, optimistic outlook on life. Can\u2019t take themselves too seriously.\"\n\nDrew explained that there is an \"approval process,\" and Deschanel seems to have passed with flying colors.\n\n\"I have my \u2018good for Jonathan\u2019 checklist. [Zooey and Jonathan are] both amazing people, and I think it\u2019s great. It\u2019s exciting. It means I get to have Jon out here to spend more time with us in L.A.\"\n\nFinding The Right Partner\n\nJonathan his ex-wife Jonathan split in 2001, and he has explained in the past that with the right partner, \"you feel good about yourself and good about them.\"\n\nHe also sees children in his future.\n\n\"I want to be a dad, so it\u2019s important for me to have a partner who would play a key role in that. When we film our shows I get along so great with the kids, and I like the idea that I can use what I believe to be good to shape the mind of a little human. I have said to myself that if I don\u2019t find the right person I think I would probably adopt on my own, because I think I would be a great dad.\"\n\nDeschanel is a mother of two, so this is another thing the quirky couple has in common.", "description": "Things are heating up between this new couple!", "authors": ["Lynne Versluys"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/f35zUp_ZBbT1ezM0j6KdWw--~B/aD0zMDg3O3c9NDUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/theblast_73/f6e5b95f158f8f031c7754e9649c193f", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
