Under the administration of Barack Obama, the law was interpreted to extend to discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nThat remains the official position of the equal employment opportunity commission (EEOC), the independent agency tasked with overseeing the application of federal laws in the workplace.\n\nYet, when Jeff Sessions became attorney general under Donald Trump, he wrote a memo saying the justice department did not agree with that interpretation. CNN said in August that the Trump administration had repeated its view that it did not believe federal employment law that bans discrimination based on sex also encompassed discrimination based on transgender status.\n\n\u201cOn Tuesday, the court will hear three major LGBTQ civil rights cases that could decide how federal non-discrimination laws apply to LGBTQ people. In each case, a worker was fired \u2013 not because of their performance or work ethic, but because they are part of the LGBTQ community,\u201d wrote Robin Maril, associate legal director of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation\u2019s largest nation\u2019s largest LGBTQ rights organisation.\n\n\u201cNo one deserves to be denied a job or fired simply because of who they are or whom they love. Period.\u201d\n\nThe legal battle was highlighted recently by Laverne Cox, star of shows such as Orange Is the New Black, and the first openly transgender performer to be be nominated for a an Emmy.\n\n\u201cWhen I got my Emmy nomination this year, my third one, I was like this is weird. I thought, there has to be a bigger reason and I thought, OK, maybe it\u2019s about this case and maybe its about raising awareness so that everyone knows our lives are in danger,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAnd a lot of people aren\u2019t talking about this case and it has implications for the LGBTQ community, but it has implications for women and anyone who doesn\u2019t conform to someone else\u2019s idea of like how you should be a man or a woman or both or neither.\u201d\n\nThe cases the court will hear involve Aimee Stephens who says she was fired from her job at a Michigan funeral home before returning to work after undergoing gender transition, Gerald Bostock who said he was fired from his job as a social worker in Georgia because he joined a gay softball league, and New York skydiver Donald Zarda, who was fired after he told a female client, who wondered about being strapped so tightly to him during a tandem jump, not to worry because he was \u201c100 per cent gay\u201d.\n\nRead more\n\nChristian doctor loses tribunal over transgender beliefs row\n\nTeacher fired for refusing to use transgender student\u2019s pronouns sues\n\nTransgender woman\u2019s shooting being treated as hate crime, police say\n\nBody of black transgender woman found torched in car", "description": "The US\u2019s highest court is set to rule whether an employer can fire a worker because they are gay or transgender, a vastly important test case that Laverne Cox used the Emmys\u2019 Red Carpet to publicise.The Supreme Court has returned for its next nine-month term, with justice Clarence Thomas absent due to", "authors": ["Andrew Buncombe"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ZH82PDaKWHMg5MEvzz4Hew--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/192c5579c25fb5074284f784bda2361d", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
