Not ideal\u2026\n\nWith 94% of the studio audience correctly voting for the duvet, Nick realised that he probably should\u2019ve known the answer, admitting to Jeremy Clarkson: \u2018Doesn\u2019t make me look very good, does it?\u2019\n\nAnd it seems the viewers at home actually agreed with Nick, echoing one comment that asked: \u2018He\u2019s a Teacher so how on earth does he not know the answer this simple question?\u2019\n\nThis guy is a teacher? God help his students. #WhoWantsToBeAMillionaire \u2014 Varun Sharma (@varshar88) October 6, 2019\n\nDon't know what was more worrying.

And his wife does all the housework?? Poor thing must be shattered. Bet he hogs the duvet too, all 20togs of it #whowantstobeamillionaire \u2014 Calico Lor (@calico_gifts) October 6, 2019\n\nSo his excuse for not knowing that a tog rating is used on a duvet is that 'his wife does all the housework' #whowantstobeamillionaire pic.twitter.com/qI0WkGHOBw \u2014 M/T (@megamouth_88) October 6, 2019\n\n\u2018What we\u2019ve learnt so far is that [Nick] doesn\u2019t do any housework,\u2019 Jeremy mocked, eliciting laughs from the audience.\n\nWhat\u2019s a duvet got to do with housework?\n\nhe should lose just for that comment alone #whowantstobeamillionaire \u2014 Ms Fab (@MsDiva_Fabulous) October 6, 2019\n\nLater using his Phone a Friend to lifeline to ask his mum what a monkey-nut was (something the viewers also were annoyed by), Nick miraculously made it to the \u00a316,000 mark and is set to return next week to continue his game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe all have our knowledge blind spots: even teachers!\n\nWho Wants To Be A Millionaire? airs Sundays at 8pm on ITV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
