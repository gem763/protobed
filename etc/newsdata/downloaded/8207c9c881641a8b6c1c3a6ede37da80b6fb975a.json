Samsung's $2999 folding phone packs a punch", "language": "en", "text": "Another pictogram has keys and a credit card coming out of the Fold, also with a line through it.\n\nWhen closed, the Galaxy Fold has a gap in it that makes the hinge side thicker than the non-hinge side. John Davidson\n\nThis one is obvious. If you can't Kapow it with your fingernails, it stands to reason you can't with your keys, either. Though, interestingly, you may want to: the phone closes more like a ring binder than a book, meaning there's an little gap where you may be tempted to store things, if only to make it more symmetrical.\n\nDon't. The little gap, and the overall asymmetry of the Fold when it's closed, do make the device look a little ungainly, but you will get used to it. You will also start to enjoy the benefits, though these are not as pronounced as we think they will be when Android catches up with large-screen phones.\n\nWatching videos on the Fold isn't quite as amazing as we hoped.\n\nThe absolute No. 1 benefit of the screen on the Fold is for reading e-books. It's the perfect size and shape for reading, and if you owned one you would never again find yourself trying to read a novel on your mobile and wishing you'd brought your Kindle.\n\nAlas, the same cannot be said for magazines. The main magazine reading app in Android, Google's woeful News app, puts thick black bars on the side of pages when you zoom in on them, for no apparent reason other than Google's developers failed to foresee screens that are more square than usual.\n\nMagazines are dreadful on this device, although this could easily be solved if Google paid even a skerrick of attention to the News app.\n\nThe other thing that should be great on the Fold, watching videos, isn't quite as amazing as we hoped, either.\n\nThe aspect ratio videos are shot in is typically different from the aspect ratio of the Fold's screen, meaning they either have to be cropped heavily to take up the entire area, or they have to be shown in a letterbox, with heavy black bars above and below the video.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLetterboxed, your typical Netflix or Stan movie displays in a window that's 77mm high and 144mm wide, which is only 6 per cent bigger than the 74mm x 141mm video you get on a big phone such as Samsung's Galaxy Note 10+.\n\nBut full-screen and cropped, the video really is huge on the Fold: it's 108mm high and 144mm wide, almost 50 per cent bigger than video on the the Note 10+. We can't stand watching videos that have been heavily cropped but we know some people who think watching on the Fold is the bee's knees.\n\nThe other thing that should be great but isn't is multi-tasking. Most Android apps aren't designed to take advantage of a screen the size and shape of the Fold's, you see, and most websites aren't either.\n\nYou get almost no advantage opening, say, this newspaper's website on the Fold compared with opening it on another phone. You don't get extra on-screen elements. You don't get extra columns. You just get the same site, unhelpfully wider.\n\nGiven enough time, it should become so good we'll look back and wonder how we ever put up with anything less.\n\nWhile we wait for the development community to come up with apps and sites that make better use of exotic screen dimensions, the Galaxy Fold has a nice feature that enables you to easily open two or three apps at the same time. You can open, say, Gmail in the bigger window on the left of the screen and your photo gallery in a small window to the right and, then drag and drop photos from the gallery it into an email.\n\nIt's really good, and saves a lot of the faffing about, but unfortunately there aren't many apps that the dragging and dropping works with. Samsung's photo gallery and Samsung's My Files app support it, for instance, but Google's Photos and Drive apps do not.\n\nGoogle has said it's going to make Android more friendly to exotic devices such as the Fold, which hopefully will mean that the multi-tasking will become more uniform and useful with time. Given enough time, it should become so good we'll look back and wonder how we ever put up with anything less.\n\nBut the question is, how much time will you get with the Fold?\n\nI don't mean time between battery charges. We haven't had the Fold long enough to get an exact sense of the battery life, but it seems to be at least a day and a morning, pushing two days when used only lightly. Which is to say, it's excellent.\n\nWhat I mean is time with the screen. Those warning pictograms have us spooked, and feeling how soft the screen is under finger, we're worried that you may not get even a year of usage out of the Fold, much less the two or three years that most people seem to want from their phones nowadays.\n\nSo take those warnings seriously. Don't go Kapow! on the screen, don't use it as a wallet, and most of all, don't cry when you realise you've spent a fortune on a phone you're going to have to replace in no time.\n\nRemember, you were warned. We think you were warned, at any rate.\n\nSAMSUNG GALAXY FOLD\n\nLikes Makes a brilliant e-book reader. Excellent battery life.\n\nDislikes Multi-tasking doesn't work fully in all apps. Chunky and heavy.\n\nPrice $2999", "description": "The giant screen on Galaxy Fold is both its strength and its weakness, judging by the many worrying warning stickers on it that dictate how it should be used.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3458%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_189%2C$y_42/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/0121f19dc2a502921528fe06d3a9009e8eeb36dd", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
