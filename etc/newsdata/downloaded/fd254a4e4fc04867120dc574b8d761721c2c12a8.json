As I went to grab the bar, one of the hands missed. The amount of force I hit the ground with caused my knee to bend sideways and back. I snapped my posterior cruciate ligament completely. It was not attached any more. I did the medial collateral ligament. It was literally just hanging in there. A grade two plus. I strained my anterior cruciate ligament. There was a grade two tear in my hamstring and I fractured the top of my tibia. My shin bone was sagging to the floor.\u201d", "description": "Giarnni Regini-Moran was just 17 and already a multiple Youth Olympic and European Junior champion when his gymnastics career turned in literally a split-second from the brink of the Olympic Games to the prospect of retirement.", "authors": ["Jeremy Wilson", "Chief Sports Reporter", "Brian Moore"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/gymnastics/2019/10/08/TELEMMGLPICT000204539512-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqQDfO_Li8BnuRdRCVfSGXuQvhzdjcZien2ya59CfVOfk.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
