A walk-out would fuel speculation that the prime minister does not believe he has the numbers to get the agreement through parliament.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

It won\u2019t deliver certainty and the people should have the final say.\n\n\u201cLabour is not prepared to sell-out the communities we represent. We are not prepared to sell out their future. And we will not back this sell-out deal.\u201d", "description": "*/ Boris Johnson will send his MPs home before the final vote on his Brexit deal if the House of Commons passes an amendment to delay it.
