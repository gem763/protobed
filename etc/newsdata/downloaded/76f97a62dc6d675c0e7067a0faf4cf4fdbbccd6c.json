This gyrfalcon, however, appeared to be more well-behaved and remained quite relaxed \u2013 unlike the one filmed at the Monday ceremony, in which the gyrfalcon named Alpha got quite nervous and ultimately soiled the floor of the King\u2019s palace, right in front of Putin and Salman.\n\nAlso on rt.com Putin gives Saudi king a GYRFALCON as gift, but the moment is somewhat ruined (VIDEOS)\n\nLike this story?
