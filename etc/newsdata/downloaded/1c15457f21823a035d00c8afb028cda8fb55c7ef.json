Bloomberg\n\nA few steps away at the IMF, by contrast, there's a bustling world that is the living embodiment of everything Trump and his supporters detest.\n\nThousands of delegates, investors and economists are cramming conference rooms throughout the IMF\u2019s sprawling headquarters and jamming DC traffic with endless motorcades.\n\nThey\u2019re chewing through hundreds of worthy debates covering everything from \u201cUsing digital innovations to improve public finance outcomes\u201d to \u201cSovereign Debt: A guide for economists and practitioners\u201d.\n\nGrowth is shuddering downwards\n\nAs the IMF is the world\u2019s leading multilateral organisation for keeping a weather eye on the global economy, the focus this week has been on the darkening outlook. The IMF\u2019s technocrats have spent much of the past few days slamming their alarm bells as hard as they can.\n\nNew managing director Kristalina Georgieva warns that growth rates are shuddering downwards around the world, including in Australia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe has flagged rising financial risks and imbalances as central banks cut rates, even as many fret about their growing impotence against flat demand.\n\nAnd casting a long shadow across all of it are the corrosive effects of the US-China trade war, which is sapping corporate confidence and freezing investment.\n\nGeorgieva, who took over her post on October 1 from Christine Lagarde, now in charge of the European Central Bank, on Thursday issued one of the fund\u2019s textbook appeals, saying the world needs to work together to \u201cbridge differences\u201d amid a \u201cprecarious\u201d economic outlook caused by a \u201csynchronised slowdown\u201d internationally.\n\n\u201cThe focus,\u201d she said, \u201cmust be on reversing tariff increases and finding lasting solutions to trade disputes, including by removing domestic distortions and strengthening the multilateral trading system.\u201d\n\nWholesome stuff, to be sure. And backed by a mountain of evidence.\n\nBut it\u2019s a message that isn't likely to travel across the road to the White House. As far as Trump is concerned, the IMF may as well be whistling in the wind. And in many ways, he's probably right.\n\nEverywhere you might care to look, countries and policymakers are turning inward. Britain and Europe are distracted by Brexit. China and the US continue to slug it out over trade. Central banks the world over are trapped in a cycle of falling rates and what amounts to competitive - if futile - currency devaluations.\n\nThere is also the endless and circular debate between monetary versus fiscal policy. As has been the case for well over a decade now, that debate features heavily at the IMF this week and the Group of 20 finance ministers' meeting, which Frydenberg and Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe are attending.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmid all of that, if there\u2019s a takeaway from this year\u2019s gathering in Washington it\u2019s the sense that the world\u2019s most important institutions don\u2019t seem well prepared for whatever economic crisis might be around the corner.\n\n'What levers do you pull'\n\nEveryone, it seems, is hoping someone else will solve the problem of soft demand, weak business investment, fragile sentiment and, crucially, how to pull the global economy out of a future crisis.\n\n\u201cThe frustration now is that you can\u2019t seem to generate growth, you can\u2019t seem to generate inflation, you don\u2019t have a lot of monetary policy ammunition,\u201d Paul Gruenwald, S &P Global Ratings' chief economist, tells AFR Weekend on the sidelines of the IMF annual meeting.\n\n\u201cUS-China is putting a damper on capital expenditure, everything is just weighed down and we\u2019ve got a lot of debt in the world,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cSo what levers do you pull as a policymaker to ease financial conditions, or ease other conditions that will support growth?\u201d\n\nGruenwald, who spent almost five years as ANZ bank\u2019s Asia-Pacific chief economist, echoes the views of many at the IMF discussions this week.\n\nCorporate bosses have few incentives to make big or bold bets on the immediate future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe trade war continues to rumble. And regardless of whether Trump eventually clinches a deal with Beijing, many investors are starting to worry about hardening attitudes in Congress on both sides of the political divide for tough action against China, according to one well-placed observer.\n\nTrump may be ready to settle for a soft deal - one that involves promises from China to buy more American agricultural goods but no solution to thorny issues such as intellectual property theft - so that he can claim a short-term victory.\n\nBut Washington\u2019s growing legions of trade hawks - many on the Democratic side - are not likely to settle for that and may use next year\u2019s political fight to outflank Trump, the observer says.\n\nEither way, that\u2019s a recipe for more uncertainty on the trade front.\n\nAt another level, this week\u2019s IMF and G20 meetings will reinforce, rather than derail, the Australian government\u2019s primary economic strategy - which is to ignore calls for immediate fiscal stimulus and continue building budget ammunition for any serious calamity that might emerge offshore.\n\nThere are good reasons why that approach makes sense, even though it carries clear political risks if the government gets it wrong. In the end, that\u2019s the judgment call voters employ governments to undertake.\n\nAnd at this point there are still good reasons for Frydenberg and Prime Minister Scott Morrison to stick to their guns.\n\nAs Frydenberg told The Australian Financial Review\u2019s Phillip Coorey and Matthew Cranston this week just before leaving for Washington, a key reason for sticking with budget repair - and dismissing calls for additional fiscal stimulus - is to build up capacity in the event of any future shock.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s even more important now that the RBA's monetary policy ammunition is almost exhausted.\n\nAs Lowe told an audience of IMF economists on Thursday (Friday AEDT), the prospect of negative interest rates in Australia is \u201cextraordinarily unlikely\u201d.\n\nThat means if a crisis does emerge, fiscal policy may have to do much more of the heavy lifting than it did in 2008-09. The Reserve Bank recognises this reality, as well as the trade-offs.\n\n'That's a good narrative'\n\nAnother reason Frydenberg is unlikely to return to Canberra in a state of wild panic about the outlook is because for all the warning signs being flagged by the IMF this week, much of the global data being released suggests that, actually, things are OK. Not outstanding, to be sure. But far from terrible.\n\nYes, the trade war has pushed the world\u2019s manufacturing sector into something that looks like recession. But labour markets are still largely healthy and in the US there has even been decent wage growth, says Gruenwald.\n\n\u201cThe good scenario, which is still a two-thirds probability, is that we continue to see strength in labour markets and households and we get some sort of modest rebound in manufacturing,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some evidence that\u2019s starting to happen in Germany right now.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe bad scenario, he adds, is likely to emerge if the weakness in manufacturing spills over into a general lack of confidence among households.\n\nAt the US Federal Reserve, analysts are keenly focused on any sign of slowing employment growth in America. If that falters, the consumer resilience that is largely keeping the US economy afloat might fade.\n\n\u201cThe thing to watch here [in the US] is the labour market and consumer confidence,\u201d says Gruenwald. \u201cIf those hold up over the next couple of quarters, then we\u2019ll probably see a rebound of manufacturing. That\u2019s a good narrative.\n\n\u201cIf those start to go pear-shaped, as you guys [in Australia] like to say, then we\u2019re in a global recession scenario.\u201d\n\nWere that to unfold, the divide between the rarefied world of the IMF and a besieged White House will become something to worry about.\n\nThe America-first approach is being replicated by populist movements around the world, making it difficult to imagine the kind of global response that emerged in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nBack then, the world\u2019s technocrats and politicians joined forces to \u201cdo what it takes\u201d to restore the global financial system and avoid another Great Depression.\n\nIt\u2019s not at all clear that will happen the next time.", "description": "For all the warning signs being flagged by the IMF this week, much of the global data being released suggests that, actually, things are OK.
