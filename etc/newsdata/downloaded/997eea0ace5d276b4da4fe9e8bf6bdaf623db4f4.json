Each day you help fetch water from the river for your mother and take care of the farm animals.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018You are also a good student. You enjoy school. You always work hard and are keen to give of your best. These are the principles you will later transfer to your running career.\u2019\n\nWhen he was 16, he met Olympic medalist Patrick San, who would become his trainer and, according to the IAAF article, his \u2018mentor, life coach and a father-figure\u2019.\n\nCurrentl, Kipchoge lives with his wife, Grace Sugutt, and their three children in Eldoret, Kenya.\n\nEliud Kipchoge\u2019s running career\n\nIn 2002, Kipchoge came fifth in the World Cross Country Championships in Dublin and was a member of the Gold-winning Kenyan junior team.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe following year, he won the junior race at the 2003 IAAF Cross Country Championships.\n\nHe also set a world junior record by running a 5000 m race in 12:52.61 minutes \u2013 a record which held for nine years.\n\nKipchoge as he crossed the finish line and made history (Picture: LEONHARD FOEGER/REUTERS)\n\nKipchoge took home a bronze medal in the 5000 m race at the 2004 Olympics in Athens and a silver medal in the 5000 m at the Beijing Olympics in 2008.\n\nIn 2016, he scored the gold medal in the marathon race at the Summer Olympics and at the Rio Olympics that same year, with a running time of 2 hours 8 minutes and 44 seconds.\n\nIn 2015, he won the Berlin Marathon even though his shoes began to fall apart during the race, and in 2016, he won the London Marathon for the second year in a row.\n\nThat second London Marathon win was achieved with a run time of 2 hours 3 minutes and 5 seconds, which broke the course record and became the then-second-fastest marathon time ever.\n\nWhen he ran the Berlin Marathon again in 2018, Kipchoge broke the then-world-record time by 1 minute and 18 seconds when he completed the race in 2 hours 1 minute and 39 seconds.\n\nHe previously attempted to run a marathon in under two hours two years ago, but that attempt was unsuccessful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though his latest attempt did succeed, his run time will not be recognised by the IAAF as an official world record because the time was not achieved in an open event.\n\nInstead, Kipchoge ran the 4.4 laps of the course assisted by 41 runners who were in turn helped with maintaining a consistent speed by a car that used lasers to light the road.\n\nHe was greeted with a hug from his wife at the finish line, and told reporters \u2018I am feeling good\u2019.", "description": "Kenya's Eliud Kipchoge rocked the world of running to its core by becoming the first man in history to run a marathon in under two hours.", "authors": ["Aidan Milan"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SEI_65957960-e1570869734903_1570873724.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
