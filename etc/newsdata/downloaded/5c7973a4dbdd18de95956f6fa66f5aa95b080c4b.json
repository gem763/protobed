But the first part is nonnegotiable. There will always be resources, and there will always be therapy, but Pastiches\u2019 six-week program is set at that length by design. Eventually, you have to rejoin the rest of the world.\n\nOf course, BoJack has every reason in the world to reject that requirement. His professional life, his romantic life, and his personal life are all in shambles; just one episode ago, his closest confidante confided that she was moving 2,000 miles across the country. Despite Dr. Champ\u2019s increasingly urgent pushes, BoJack simply refuses to leave Pastiches behind.\n\nAfter four consecutive episodes that largely centered on individual character arcs, \u201cA Little Uneven, Is All\u201d is the closest this season has come to classic BoJack Horseman: an ensemble piece that ping-pongs between several semi-interconnected story lines. While BoJack manufactures reasons to stay ensconced in the warm hug of the rehab clinic, his friends are dealing with dramatic problems on the outside. Following the livestreamed revelation that he cheated on Pickles, Mr. Peanutbutter discovers that he is despised by both the women on the set of Birthday Dad and the women who once made up a sizable chunk of his fan base.\n\nMr. Peanutbutter has glided through life so easily that he assumes his current problem will pass like everything else: that the public, which instinctively loves him, will forgive him like they always have. But Princess Carolyn needs Birthday Dad to be a hit, so she jump-starts the process with the quickest fix we have in the 21st century: a viral meme. \u201cSad Dog\u201d \u2014 a very \u201cSad Keanu\u201d\u2013esque picture of Mr. Peanutbutter looking bummed on a park bench \u2014 is the kind of generic junk that can mean basically anything with the right Impact text slapped on top of it.\n\nAnd \u201cSad Dog\u201d might be a fairly trenchant critique of the nonsense that equates to instant celebrity in 2019 \u2014 but in the end, BoJack Horseman wisely goes darker. When Gen-Z star Joey Pogo drives onto the set of Birthday Dad, Princess Carolyn pretends that Mr. Peanutbutter threw himself in front of the car in a suicide attempt, which earns him instant forgiveness from the world at large. \u201cWe didn\u2019t realize you have a mental illness! You are truly a hero for de-stigmatizing this all-too-common affliction,\u201d swoons a nearby paparazzo.\n\nLike it did with both Flip and BoJack last season, BoJack Horseman seems earnestly interested in using these final episodes to interrogate why the bar is so low for men, who only need to reveal some kind of vulnerability before the rest of the world will trip all over itself in understanding and forgiveness. By his own account, Mr. Peanutbutter is a happy dog. But it doesn\u2019t matter; the entirely unconvincing revelation that he\u2019s suffering from depression is more than enough to earn him total absolution for his actions.\n\nBack in rehab, BoJack is at least attempting to find the root of the entitlement that has led him down this particularly grim path. When Todd sends his assistant Casey to assist BoJack, BoJack bristles at her obsequiousness toward anyone in a position of greater power: \u201cPeople like you indulge us and you soothe our egos, and you let us abuse you.\u201d\n\nAs usual, BoJack doesn\u2019t quite foresee the long-term impact of his actions, which prompt Casey to organize an assistants\u2019 strike that seems poised to paralyze all of Hollywoo. But even as he (correctly) interrogates his own sense of privilege, he indulges in it, fixated on preserving his ownership of the \u201cfancy room\u201d at Pastiches when another patient needs it more.\n\nAnd it\u2019s here where \u201cA Little Uneven, Is All\u201d loses me a little bit because it essentially absolves BoJack of the role he plays in the episode\u2019s darkest twist. Ever since he led Jamison back to rehab in the premiere, BoJack has hung onto the bottle of vodka she left behind as a kind of totem. In this episode, the bottle gets knocked into a package of water bottles. Dr. Champ chugs it and relapses on his own alcoholism, leaving BoJack to play therapist on what looks to be a long, dark night of the soul.\n\nAnd that\u2019s fine, for what it is: BoJack has a very intimate understanding of what Dr. Champ might need after this unintentional setback. But given that BoJack spent the entire episode trying desperately to find a reason to stay within the walls of Pastiches, I wonder if the series should have given him such a noble, selfless reason to do it. There was a time when BoJack might well have intentionally planted that bottle of vodka for Dr. Champ, knowing it would give him an excuse to stick around. After so many bad decisions, I\u2019m intrigued to see the final season placing BoJack on a nobler path than that. But if he\u2019s really ready to turn to his better angels, I\u2019m with Dr. Champ: It\u2019s time for Pastiches to show him the door.\n\nHorsin\u2019 Around\n\n\u2022 As if BoJack didn\u2019t already have enough reasons to feel guilty over Sarah Lynn\u2019s death, a series of flashbacks to the set of Horsin\u2019 Around reveal that he left out the liquor that she drank as a 10-year-old \u2014 and then lied about it, which led to hairstylist Sharona getting fired from the set.\n\n\u2022 Meanwhile, in Chicago, Diane is suffering from a depression she refuses to reveal to anyone. When Guy comes home, she waxes rhapsodic about how well her book is going; when he walks away, the episode reveals that the only thing she has typed is \u201cI am terrible,\u201d over and over again.\n\n\u2022 In a classic Todd adventure, an ice-cream truck crashes into a root-beer factory, and some hero is needed to slurp the mess up. \u201cFive people are dead!\u201d screams a man who is inexplicably dressed in a top hat and tails.\n\n\u2022 Fulfilling her pact to even the score after Mr. Peanutbutter had sex with Diane, Pickles has sex with a dude named Carl. She then decides, because she didn\u2019t have a real emotional connection with Carl, that it didn\u2019t count, and she needs to sleep with somebody else. I\u2019m sure this will end well for everyone involved!\n\n\u2022 Dr. Champ\u2019s impressively succinct summary of all the revelations you\u2019re supposed to have in rehab: \u201cLife is precious. God is religious, or merely the idea of human connection. Don\u2019t do drugs. Say you\u2019re sorry.\u201d\n\n\u2022 The \u201cGoodbye Denise\u201d banner clearly used to read \u201cGoodbye Mario,\u201d so I guess Jay Hernandez is done with his deep-cover research for the Super Mario Bros. movie.\n\n\u2022 Todd\u2019s assistant answers his phone with the question, \u201cWhat if Todd was one of us?\u201d His hold music is \u201cOde to Joy\u201d if every note were the word Todd.\n\n\u2022 Todd on his ever-growing army of helpers: \u201cAssistants are like Deadpool movies. I couldn\u2019t just stop at one, even though I probably should have.\u201d\n\n\u2022 The full working title of Diane\u2019s book: One Last Thing and Then I Swear to God I\u2019ll Shut Up Forever: A Definitive Retrospective of the Choices We Make, the People We Hurt, the Places We Go, Part One.
