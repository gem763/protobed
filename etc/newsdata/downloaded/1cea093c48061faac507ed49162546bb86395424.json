In front of her then-11-year-old daughter, a friend began talking about a nude scene she had filmed for Transparent, the Emmy-winning Amazon series on which she plays Sarah Pfefferman, the eldest daughter in a neurotic Los Angeles family. The friend was monologuing her indignation\u2014\u201cFull-frontal, Sarah? How could you do that?\u201d\u2014and her kid was in earshot for the whole thing.\n\nLandecker went into mom mode, calmly explaining the circumstances of the scene, hoping to justify and/or stave off further embarrassment: Her character, at that point, had been divorced, had a lesbian affair, got divorced again, and was on an unsettling chute careening toward rock bottom. She was explaining to her daughter that the moment illustrates how bleak the circumstances were for Sarah, who is filmed naked and alone, cooking and eating a sad meal in the kitchen.\n\nHer daughter interrupted: \u201cWait, wait, wait. You were cooking?\u201d Landecker erupts into a cackle as she tells the story. \u201cLike, that was what was shocking.\u201d\n\nNEWSLETTERS The Daily Beast\u2019s Obsessed Everything we can\u2019t stop loving, hating, and thinking about this week in pop culture. Subscribe By Clicking \"Subscribe\" you agree to have read the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy\n\n(Not that Landecker doesn\u2019t still get PTSD remembering the scene anyway. \u201cI didn\u2019t think Bradley would ever touch me again after that,\u201d she laughs, talking about her husband Bradley Whitford, whom she met on the show.)\n\nThe incident comes up as we\u2019re talking about all of the scary, horrifying, never-in-a-million-years-thought-she-would-do-this things that her storylines across five seasons of Transparent have tasked her with, not to mention the emotional depths she would be required to explore. Specifically, on the occasion of the Transparent Musicale Finale, a wrap-up movie coming out this Friday, two years after the series was thrust into crisis mode as star Jeffrey Tambor was accused of sexual misconduct and ultimately fired, we\u2019re talking about the scariest thing she\u2019s had to do yet.\n\nBeing naked is one thing. Then there\u2019s singing on TV.\n\nIn the Transparent Musicale Finale, Landecker sings. The whole ensemble does, in fact\u2014Judith Light, Gaby Hoffmann, Jay Duplass, Kathryn Hahn, Alexandra Billings... everyone.\n\n\u201cI found out we were doing this musical movie finale and I was like, \u2018Oh, I won't have any sex scenes! That will be great!\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cThen I was like, \u2018Oh wait, now I have to sing,\u2019 which is way scarier.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re talking over the phone a few weeks before the movie\u2019s premiere Sept. 27 on Amazon. She says she\u2019s pacing in the alley outside a Los Angeles gym, \u201cgetting some steps in.\u201d That weekend she\u2019s going with Whitford to the Creative Arts Emmy Awards\u2014he won Best Guest Actor in a Drama Series for his work on The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, which Landecker also guested on this past season\u2014and jokes that she\u2019s being the clich\u00e9d actress working out like a maniac to fit into her dress.\n\nShe tells me the name of the gym\u2014Tighter U, as in University\u2014and starts howling over the silliness of the pun. Amy Landecker doesn\u2019t finish a sentence or a story. You know it\u2019s over usually because she bursts into a fit of laughter. It\u2019s her personal form of punctuation. Even while talking about everything that happened on Transparent, she employs it a lot.\n\nIt takes a second to wrap your head around. It\u2019s Transparent, but they\u2019re singing. It took Landecker a minute to grasp the whole thing, too.\n\nIn the opening minutes of the film, the Pfefferman family learns that Maura\u2014Tambor's character\u2014 has died. They spend the rest of the movie processing their grief and reconciling the traumatic event with all the growth they\u2019ve done in the past years, and how much more they have left to do. Series creator Jill Soloway\u2019s sibling, Faith, wrote the songs, with titles like \u201cYour Boundary Is My Trigger\u201d and \u201cJoyocaust.\u201d\n\nAt first, Landecker thought, \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Then she thought it was perfect. \u201cThere was like no other way to send this show off into the history book of, you know, television without this big sort of bang.\u201d\n\nThe cast refers to it as \u201cThe Great Rupture of 2017,\u201d a phrase first used by actor Shakina Nayfack, who joins the cast for the film.\n\nStar Tambor faced two allegations of sexual misconduct from members of the Transparent team, former assistant Van Barnes and co-star Trace Lysette. After an investigation, he was officially fired.\n\nSoloway and the Transparent writers and producers were left scrambling, until they finally landed on the idea of a musical that handles Tambor\u2019s absence by killing off his character. Earlier this summer, we asked Soloway about the challenge of writing the storyline without it appearing that the show is dancing on Tambor\u2019s grave in the aftermath of the allegations. (This is, after all, a musical.)\n\n\u201cThat occurred to us: Was this going to be taken as a celebration?\u201d Soloway said. \u201cBut in fact when you watch the movie, there are so many unbelievably painful, heartfelt moments where our characters are mourning Maura and as actors and as creators we are mourning what has happened with our show.\u201d\n\nLandecker likened the period of \u201cThe Great Rupture\u201d to going through the five stages of grief. There were a lot of tears, and a lot of talks in private. She says it\u2019s almost impossible to articulate all the feelings in an interview, which is why she hasn\u2019t said much about the ordeal publicly. By the time the cast got back together to film the Transparent Musicale Finale, they sobbed on set, happy to have the opportunity to finish telling their story.\n\n\u201cIt was trying to create something that would let the show have a legacy that moved beyond the controversy,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was an earthquake that took place, and we didn\u2019t know if we would be rebuilding at all. We got to really come back, process it and, like, literally go sing and dance. It was a perfect way to kind of exorcise all our emotions about it.\u201d\n\n\u201c I found out we were doing this musical movie finale and I was like, \u2018Oh, I won't have any sex scenes! That will be great!\u2019 Then I was like, \u2018Oh wait, now I have to sing,\u2019 which is way scarier. \u201d\n\nYes, the singing was scary. But so has much of the experience of working on Transparent. That\u2019s why she gets so emotional about its end.\n\n\u201cIt's incredible to walk through fear,\u201d she says. \u201cTo be challenged like that, you just feel so alive. Even if it's not pleasant.\u201d\n\nShe laughs thinking about a screening of Fleabag and onstage conversation with Phoebe Waller-Bridge she once attended. Someone told the writer and actress that they never could do all the nudity that she does in the series, and asked her how she\u2019s comfortable enough to do it. The thing is, though, Waller-Bridge is never naked in Fleabag. Not once.\n\nLandecker has that experience a lot. She has the one nude scene by the microwave, and it\u2019s not even sexual. Yet she\u2019s constantly asked about the bravery it takes to be constantly nude.\n\nShe and Gaby Hoffmann used to giggle together every time it happened, or every time she was told she\u2019s \u201ccourageous\u201d for baring her body. Hoffman would tell her that it\u2019s something they say if they think you\u2019re not young and hot. \u201cNobody says that if you're the classically, like, what we consider beautiful,\u201d Landecker says. \u201cIt\u2019s not courageous, unless they think you're not that great.\u201d\n\nLandecker actually turned down the audition for Transparent. At the time, that was not something she ever did. She once even declined the opportunity to have drinks with Mad Men creator Matthew Weiner and Jon Hamm after an awards show in 2009 because she had an audition the next morning.\n\nBack then, she was best known for a breakout turn in the Coen Brothers film A Serious Man. She had memorable guest spots on Louie and Curb Your Enthusiasm. Prior to that, she had a fruitful career doing voiceover work. She earned her SAG card saying the word \u201cballet\u201d in a Tampax commercial while living in Chicago. Famously, she was the go-to voice actress for dubbing Julia Roberts\u2019 dialogue.\n\nWhen the breakdown for Transparent came through, her first sitcom leading role, on NBC\u2019s The Paul Reiser Show, had just ended with the low-rated show\u2019s cancellation. She was in the habit of auditioning for anything and everything, but the Transparent breakdown said that nudity and sexual activity would be required, and she wasn\u2019t interested in that.\n\nUnbeknownst to her, Soloway was already thinking about Landecker for the role and was disappointed she didn\u2019t audition. Soloway asked her out to lunch; Landecker was surprised she was even on the writer-director\u2019s radar at all. They talked about what Landecker would and wouldn\u2019t be comfortable doing. The rest is history: five seasons and a movie.\n\n\u201c It's incredible to walk through fear. To be challenged like that, you just feel so alive. Even if it's not pleasant. \u201d\n\n\u201cI almost missed out on the greatest job of my life,\u201d she says.\n\nShe\u2019s been feeling incredibly nostalgic. Not only is Transparent the most fulfilling job of her career, it\u2019s also where she met Bradley Whitford, when he guest-starred in the first season as a character named Marcy. Earlier this summer, the two got married.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real emotional sentimentality about it for me,\u201d Landecker says.\u201dI got so many gifts from that show. We\u2019re going to the Emmys on Sunday, because Bradley got nominated for The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. One of our first dates was the Emmys for Transparent cause he got nominated and won for Marcy in season one. So I\u2019m very much aware of the beginning and thinking about that stuff a lot.\u201d\n\n(If you follow Landecker on Instagram, you\u2019ve been privy to her frequent posts of Whitford stretching and showing off his remarkable flexibility. \u201cI've never met a man as flexible as Bradley!\u201d she laughs when I ask her about it. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll start my own Instagram account just with, you know, like flexible Bradley.\u201d)\n\nThe whole ride of these last five years has caught her completely by surprise. The success of the show. The success of her career, later than she\u2019d ever expected. Falling in love through it all. She laughs remembering that when the whole thing started, she wasn\u2019t sure if anyone would even know how to find the show on Amazon. Hell, she didn\u2019t even know.\n\nBut within four months of shooting, the series was winning Golden Globe awards. She remembers that the cast was so unknown that, on the awards show red carpet, no one wanted to take their photos. She was embarrassed, then finally heard one photographer shout, \u201cAmy! Look here!\u201d She got excited\u2014until she realized Amy Adams was standing next to her.\n\n\u201cIt was a humble beginning,\u201d she laughs. \u201cNow I\u2019m an obnoxious demanding actress. Now they just go, \u2018Amy! Amy! Amy!\u2019 and they mean Amy Brenneman. So there\u2019s that now. They sort of recognize me but they have the wrong one.\u201d", "description": "The actress talks weathering the Jeffrey Tambor scandal, reuniting for a musical finale\u2014she knows it sounds crazy\u2014and how the show changed her life.
