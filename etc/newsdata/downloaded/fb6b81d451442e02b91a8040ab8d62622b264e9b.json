Giuliani.\n\nAnderson, a career Foreign Service officer, will detail efforts when U.S. officials tried to demonstrate support for Ukraine only to be batted down by the White House, including after Russian forces attacked and seized Ukrainian military vessels in the Sea of Azov in 2018.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhile my colleagues at the State Department quickly prepared a statement condemning Russia for its escalation, senior officials in the White House blocked it from being issued,\u201d Anderson was set to testify.\n\nCroft, who worked on Ukraine issues at the White House and the State Department, will say that \u201cthroughout\u201d her time in the Trump administration she heard the president \u201cdescribe Ukraine as a corrupt country,\u201d both \u201cdirectly and indirectly.\u201d\n\nThe prepared testimony does not add significantly to the specific claims by other U.S. officials alleging that Trump tried to pressure Ukraine into investigating his political rivals by withholding about $400 million in military aid and diplomatic support to Ukraine.\n\nAD\n\nCroft and Anderson did not enjoy as much visibility into senior-level decision-making as some of their peers, such as former deputy national security adviser Charles Kupperman, whom House Democrats have struggled to bring in to testify. But they do offer new insight into how a shadow foreign policy executed by people outside of government undermined the work of U.S. officials.\n\nAD\n\nSpecifically, Croft mentions receiving inexplicable phone calls from Washington lobbyist Robert Livingston, \u201cwho told me that Ambassador Yovanovitch should be fired,\u201d referring to Marie Yovanovitch, then the top U.S. envoy in Kyiv.\n\n\u201cHe characterized Ambassador Yovanovitch as an \u2018Obama holdover\u2019 and associated with George Soros,\u201d she plans to testify.\n\nAD\n\nYovanovitch was recalled from her position earlier this year after Giuliani and his associates waged a campaign of unsubstantiated allegations about her being opposed to Trump and supportive of Joe Biden, the former vice president now seeking the Democratic nomination for president in 2020. Yovanovitch denied those allegations in her sworn testimony earlier this month.\n\n\u201cIt was not clear to me at the time \u2014 or now \u2014 at whose direction or at whose expense Mr. Livingston was seeking the removal of Ambassador Yovanovitch,\u201d she will say.\n\nAD\n\nLivingston, a former Republican congressman from Louisiana, was chosen as the successor to Newt Gingrich as speaker of the House in 1999, but he declined the position after revelations of an extramarital affair. After leaving Congress, he formed the Livingston Group, one of Washington\u2019s most influential lobbying firms. His firm has represented clients in the Middle East and around the world, including political figures in Ukraine such as former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, according to Justice Department documents.\n\nAD\n\nCroft is expected to say she notified her boss, Fiona Hill, and another State Department official, George Kent, of Livingston\u2019s activities, and declare that she is \u201cnot aware of any action that was taken in response.\u201d\n\nThe testimony was scheduled for a pivotal moment in the impeachment inquiry, as Democrats prepare to move the effort into the open with public hearings.\n\nAD\n\nThe House is expected to vote this week on a Democratic resolution laying out rules for those hearings in the Intelligence Committee and formally authorizing House Republicans to request testimony and documents, subject to votes by the Democratic-majority panel.\n\nUnveiled Tuesday afternoon, the resolution was expected to receive a vote Thursday, according to multiple Democratic aides who were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nAD\n\nThe move responds in part to Republican attempts to undermine the impeachment inquiry by painting it as a secretive effort to oust Trump from office.\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham slammed the resolution Tuesday night in a statement, saying it \u201cconfirms that House Democrats\u2019 impeachment has been an illegitimate sham from the start.\u201d\n\nIn the past month, investigators have heard testimony or received briefings from about a dozen officials, and they have subpoenaed or requested documents from about 18 others. The inquiry formally began Sept. 24.\n\nTwo additional witnesses are scheduled to testify before the end of the week: Timothy Morrison, special assistant to the president and senior director for Europe and Russia on the National Security Council, on Thursday, and Robert Blair, senior adviser to acting Trump chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, on Friday.\n\nTom Hamburger contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "Their prepared remarks offer new insight into how a shadow foreign policy executed by people outside of government undermined the work of U.S. officials.", "authors": ["John Hudson", "National Security Reporter Focusing On The State Department", "Elise Viebeck", "Enterprise", "Investigations Reporter Focused On Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/lXBCBNpMvlHGmMrLZzqwy9vLZNs=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/O2DLVTH2XAI6TCIGVNVWBXUREQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
