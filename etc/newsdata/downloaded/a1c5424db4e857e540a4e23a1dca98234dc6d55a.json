Meanwhile, 26% (about 67 million) describe themselves as religious \u201cnones\u201d (atheists, agnostics and nonaffiliated), up from 17% in 2009.\n\nWhile the pollsters didn\u2019t suggest a cause for the decline, the data confirms that self-identified Protestants and Catholics, as a share of the U.S. population, are on a downward trend: 43% of U.S. adults (about 110 million) identified themselves as Protestant, down from 51% in 2009. And 20% (about 51 million) identified as Catholic, down from 23% a decade ago.\n\nAt the same time, the percentage of atheists has doubled to 4% since 2007.\n\n\u201cThe data shows that just like rates of religious affiliation, rates of religious attendance are declining,\u201d wrote the pollsters, led by Gregory A. Smith, Pew\u2019s associate director of research.\n\nThe religious trends also impact the political landscape: \u201cReligious \u2018nones\u2019 are growing faster among Democrats than Republicans, though their ranks are swelling in both partisan coalitions,\u201d the Pew report states.\n\nIn 2007, 72% of Democrats described themselves as Christian; that portion has fallen to 55%. Today, roughly a third of Democrats most closely align with religious \u201cnones.\u201d Today, nearly 80% of Republicans identify as Christian, down from 87%.\n\nThe biggest movement, however, might be among white Democrats, as the data suggests church attendance still high among minority Democrats. While fewer than 30% of white Democrats say they attend religious services monthly, that number is more than double for black Democrats (61%).\n\nFor the first time, fewer than half of Hispanics described themselves as Catholic (47%), down from 57% 10 years ago. And millennials (1 in 10) are much likely than baby boomers (6 in 100) or older Americans (4 in 100) to describe themselves as belonging to a non-Christian faith.\n\nThe data was collected from a telephone survey conducted by Pew in 2018 and 2019.\n\nThe survey also suggests non-Christian faiths are gaining a foothold among more Americans, if still marginally as a percentage of the population. The proportion of Jewish Americans has held steady (2%), while Muslims, Buddhists, and Hindus each account for 1% of the population. Three percent of Americans identify with other faiths or describe themselves as \u201cspiritual.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for Pew said the data doesn\u2019t shed light on causes in the rise of \u201cnones,\u201d but clerical abuse scandals that have shaken mainline Christian faiths, such as the Catholic church or the Southern Baptist Conference, are often pointed to by observers of such data. But the data doesn\u2019t directly point this out.\n\nThe share of American Protestants calling themselves \u201cborn again\u201d or \u201cevangelical\u201d rose by 3%, perhaps reflecting the loss of Protestants not claiming either one of those identifiers.\n\nWhile the impact of growing disaffiliation with religion in America is not known, a new study from the Lake Institute on Faith and Giving at Indiana University\u2019s Lilly Family School of Philanthropy released Thursday suggests that while attendance in pews declines, giving is up.\n\nNearly half of the 1,200 congregations surveyed \u2014 including churches, synagogues, mosques, and other houses of worship \u2014 say revenue from participants has increased.\n\nA report from GivingUSA earlier this year said that Americans involved in some worship practice were more likely to give to charity than those who weren\u2019t involved in any practice.\n\n\u2022 This article is based in part on wire service reports.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
