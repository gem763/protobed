But further orders of the buses were cancelled in 2016 by Sadiq Khan who succeeded Mr Johnson as mayor.\n\nStruggling Wrightbus, whose co-founder Sir William Wright is a prominent Brexit supporter, has been trying to attract a new owner or investment but failed.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

They added that at the time of appointment Wrightbus had around 1,250 employees and all but around 50 of them will be made redundant on Wednesday.\n\nMichael Magnay, one of the two administrators, said: \u201cThis will be devastating news for those who worked there, their families and the town, which has already suffered from a number of manufacturing closures in recent years.\u201d\n\nWrightbus was one of Northern Ireland\u2019s largest employers and provided jobs to many more people through its supply chain.\n\nThe firm, also known for manufacturing zero-emission buses powered by hydrogen, was profitable in the past.\n\nHowever, demand for its vehicles has fallen in recent years.\n\nNew bus and coach sales in the UK slid by over 29 per cent in the second quarter compared with a year earlier, according to figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Only 69 Wrightbus vehicles were sold, almost a fifth fewer than during the April-June period in 2018.\n\nOwen Smith, an MP and former Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary, said the advocates of Brexit must take \u201ctheir share of the blame\u201d for the failure of Wrightbus.\n\nHe added: \u201cBrexit is hitting even world-leading manufacturers like Wrightbus hard. Brexit has created massive economic uncertainty in the UK and effectively closed off overseas markets. The reality is that Brexit offers nothing but bad news and economic decline to Northern Ireland.\u201d\n\nThe firm\u2019s collapse comes only days after Thomas Cook declared bankruptcy, leaving 9,000 UK workers facing almost certain redundancy.", "description": "Wrightbus, Northern Ireland\u2019s\u00a0maker of the \u2018Boris Bus\u2019, has fallen into administration, resulting in around 1,200 redundancies.
