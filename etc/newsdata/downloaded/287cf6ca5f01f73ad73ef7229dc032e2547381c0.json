It is listed at $3.8 million. (HomeVisit)\n\nThe three decided to construct a European modern farmhouse with just enough contemporary elements to be innovative but not so many it was off-putting to the traditional Great Falls homeowner.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe were watching what other people in the area were doing, what we thought was good, what could be improved upon,\u201d Cormicle said. \u201cWe felt like the audience was out there and we wanted to deliver to that audience what we thought the buyer wanted, but we also wanted to keep some of the design more traditional. We didn\u2019t want to overwhelm people.\u201d\n\nFinding the right location was key. When they came across this wooded lot on the top of a hill, they knew it would give the house a commanding presence and provide seclusion. Without the higher elevation and mature trees to screen out prying eyes, having all the large panes of glass would have felt like living in a fishbowl.\n\nInstead, the massive windows invite in the outdoors and create a bright, airy space. The 12-foot ceilings and 10-foot doorways add to the spaciousness. What keeps the house from feeling cavernous is its layout. The design has the same flow found in open-concept houses but cleverly arranged nooks create intimacy, not restraint. Rooms have function and purpose.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe rooms, they are proportioned correctly so that you don\u2019t have just lots of wasted space throughout the house,\u201d Cormicle said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a delicate balance with an open plan,\u201d Pomajambo added. \u201cYou have to have your proportions correct. With high ceilings and big doors, you don\u2019t want it to feel oversized.\u201d\n\nThe massive mahogany doors at the entry open to a 60-foot entrance hall. The idea for an entrance hall sprang from conversations Pomajambo had over the years with clients who eschewed the traditional living room.\n\n\u201cI said, what is a formal living room? It\u2019s a space that nobody ever really uses,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s where you bring somebody new to your house. You kind of stage them there and then lead them to wherever you need to.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe long corridor functions as an entertaining space, art gallery and music area. The more casual sitting area, just off the kitchen, allows for cozy conversations. The fireplace wall clad in oil-rubbed, hot-rolled steel is a focal point. Another visually arresting backdrop is found in the master bathroom. The veins in the book-matched marble ripple along the wall behind the double vanity.\n\nAD\n\nThe five-bedroom, eight-bathroom, 9,362-square-foot house on 1.6 acres is listed at just under $3.8 million.\n\nListing: 1101 Jonquil Cir., Great Falls, Va.\n\nListing agents: Piper Yerks and Fahed Khatib, Washington Fine Properties\n\nPrevious House of the Week\n\nMore Real Estate:\n\nProperty with a Revolutionary War-era legacy gets a new life\n\nInside the D.C. area\u2019s most expensive homes for sale in September\n\nWell-Heeled home buyers can enjoy their cuppa at Sir Thomas Lipton\u2019s Osidge\n\nAD", "description": "HOUSE OF THE WEEK | The European modern farmhouse sits on a hill but enjoys privacy because of the surrounding trees.
