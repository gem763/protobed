In announcing the meeting, the two governments also said they are hoping for \u201cmeaningful progress.\u201d\n\nDeputy-level officials from the U.S. and China are expected to hold discussions in mid-September to prepare for a meeting of top officials in early October.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to predict anything. I\u2019m just saying it is a good thing that they\u2019re coming here, and tempers are calmer now,\u201d Kudlow said on CNBC on Friday. \u201cWe\u2019re engaged in very important discussions across the board, whether it\u2019s agriculture or IP or tech transfer or cloud or cyber-hacking or trade barriers.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

The U.S. wants China to address policies that it says force American companies to hand over valuable technology or intellectual property to do business in the country.\n\n\u201cWe would love to go back to where we were in May \u2014 where we were getting kind of close to an agreement, maybe 90 percent of the way. But I don\u2019t want to predict,\u201d Kudlow said.\n\nTrump has also demanded that China significantly increase purchases of U.S. farm commodities like soybeans and corn. China is one of the biggest markets for U.S. agriculture exports, and farmers have been hit hard by China\u2019s retaliation to U.S. tariffs.\n\nBut Beijing has informally tied any agricultural purchases to the U.S. treatment of Huawei. The telecommunications company was blacklisted by the Trump administration in May, effectively cutting it off from U.S. semiconductor suppliers.\n\nThe Commerce Department has reviewed dozens of applications from U.S. chipmakers requesting a waiver to ship to Huawei, but none of those have yet been approved.\n\nThe two sides are still far from a larger deal. So far, Beijing has been unwilling to make any major concessions to address issues that the U.S. says result in widespread theft of American technology.\n\nStill, a partial deal could calm financial markets that have been whipsawed by almost every development in the nearly 2-year-old trade fight.\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce released an analysis on Friday that showed 43 percent of executives at Fortune 500 companies have raised or addressed concerns over the duties. The report comes amid growing signs that the escalating tariffs are slowing U.S. economic growth and may even be directing the country toward a recession.\n\n\u201cAt this moment of uncertainty, it is critical that our leaders take decisive steps to bolster the economy and avoid actions that could turn talk of recession into reality,\u201d Chamber CEO Tom Donohue wrote in a recent op-ed. \u201cFor the Trump administration\u2019s part, the escalation of trade tensions with China must come to an end.\u201d", "description": "Major U.S. companies and donors are also pressing the president to delay tariffs.", "authors": ["Adam Behsudi"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/49/73/1603e8db469783ecdf9dca8d908e/1996-larry-kudlow-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
