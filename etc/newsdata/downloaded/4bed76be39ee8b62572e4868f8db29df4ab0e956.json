She was 86.\n\nThe cause was complications from a lung disorder, said her son, Adam Green.\n\nAfter a decade in small parts on-screen and stage, Ms. Newman had a career breakthrough with \u201cSubways Are for Sleeping\u201d (1961), in which she appeared in a bath towel and for which she won the Tony for best featured actress in a musical. (The lyrics were co-written by her husband, Adolph Green).\n\nShe won the coveted prize over such formidable competitors as Barbara Harris and Barbra Streisand, seeming to blare her arrival as the next big musical theater star. Yet for decades, amid stellar reviews, she mostly was hired as a replacement for bigger names in Broadway shows.\n\nMeanwhile, she became a stalwart of TV game and talk shows, which led to her appearances on \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d as a performer and a guest host. She said her gift for gab \u2014 as a \u201ca chatterer and a laugher,\u201d as she was once characterized \u2014 ricocheted against her and stereotyped her.\n\n\u201cI know everybody in the world and they never hire me for anything,\u201d she once told an interviewer. Of her TV work, she added, \u201cIt keeps you in front of the public, but that\u2019s the only way they knew me.\u201d\n\n\n\nPhyllis Newman in 2009. (Peter Kramer/AP)\n\nShe also said she put her career second to raising her two children with Green. \u201cIt just seemed inevitable that I would do that,\u201d she told the New York Post. \u201cAdolph was always working and someone had to take care of the kids. I\u2019m not bitter about it at all. I don\u2019t regret it for one minute.\u201d\n\nShe earned a second Tony nomination, for best featured actress in a play, as Aunt Blanche in the Neil Simon play \u201cBroadway Bound\u201d (1986). She soon began a brief role in the ABC soap opera \u201cOne Life to Live.\u201d\n\n[Neil Simon, Broadway\u2019s long-reigning king of comedy, dies at 91]\n\n\u201cI was supposed to do just five episodes of \u2018One Life to Live,\u2019 \u201d she told the Associated Press. \u201cI played Renee Devine, an ex-madame from Las Vegas who dressed to kill. The character just took off.\u201d\n\n[Broadway Lyricist Adolph Green, 87, Dies]\n\nMs. Newman was born in Jersey City, on March 19, 1933. Her parents, Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe, worked on the Atlantic City boardwalk. Her mother, Rachel, took the name \u201cMarvelle, the Fortune Teller,\u201d and her father, Sigmund, analyzed handwriting under the moniker \u201cGabel the Graphologist.\u201d\n\nAs a child, Ms. Newman also showed a talent for performance. As \u201cBaby Phyllis,\u201d she began impersonating stars of the day such as the flamboyant Brazilian singer Carmen Miranda.\n\nShe made her Broadway debut in \u201cWish You Were Here\u201d (1952), a musical set in a summer camp. Her other Broadway credits included a 1971 revival of the musical \u201cOn the Town.\u201d Working with playwright Arthur Laurents, she created a short-lived one-woman show, \u201cThe Madwoman of Central Park West\u201d (1979). She also made dozens of TV and films appearances.\n\nIn the 1990s, she focused on fundraising and founded the Phyllis Newman Women\u2019s Health Initiative of the Actor\u2019s Fund. Her work earned her the 2009 Isabelle Stevenson Award from the Tony Awards. She also hosted the annual benefit Breathless on Broadway to raise money for research to combat the lung disease pulmonary hypertension.\n\nShe started writing her autobiography, \u201cJust in Time: Notes From My Life\u201d (1988), after being diagnosed with breast cancer. \u201cI started writing it because I didn\u2019t want to talk about it. Not that it was a secret. After I had 50 pages down, Simon & Schuster bought it,\u201d she said at the time.\n\nGreen, whom she married in 1960, died in 2002. In addition to her son, survivors include her daughter, Amanda Green.", "description": "The show-business personality was among the first women guest hosts on \u201cThe Tonight Show.\u201d", "authors": ["Staff Reports", "News Services", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/hNfFQFgplDRkaMKeI0NmpqyTpaI=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/C5KHQWWYTEI6TJUIGA3JH62LBM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
