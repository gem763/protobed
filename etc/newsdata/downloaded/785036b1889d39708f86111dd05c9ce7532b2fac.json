Powell declined at the time to call the cut a mid-cycle adjustment, instead stressing that policymakers would \u201cact as appropriate to ensure that the expansion remains on track.\u201d\n\nBut the latest economic data suggests the U.S. economy, or at least key parts of it, are slowing.\n\nIn September, the Institute for Supply Management's purchasing managers' index fell to 47.8 percent, the lowest level since 2009. Any figure below 50 percent signals a contraction. That reading triggered the start of a stock market plunge, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average shedding more than 800 points over the course of two days. It continued on Thursday, after the services survey showed the economy is weaker than expected.\n\nTicker Security Last Change Change % I:DJI DOW JONES AVERAGES 26201.04 +122.42 +0.47% SP500 S&P 500 2910.63 +23.02 +0.80% I:COMP NASDAQ COMPOSITE INDEX 7872.264943 +87.02 +1.12%\n\nAnd on Wednesday, the ADP National Employment Report revealed the economy added 135,000 jobs last month, slightly fewer than economists expected, spurring fears the labor market is beginning to cool.\n\n\"Job growth is definitely slowing,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, during a conference call with reporters. \"Businesses have turned more cautious in their hiring. Small businesses have become especially hesitant. If businesses pull back any further, unemployment will begin to rise.\"\n\nAs a result, about 92.5 percent of traders are pricing in the chance of a third, 25-basis point reduction at the Fed\u2019s Oct. 30 meeting, according to the CME\u2019s FedWatch tool. That\u2019s up from 62 percent on Tuesday, shortly after the latest manufacturing reading.\n\nFor now, all eyes will be on the Department of Labor\u2019s September jobs report, which will be released early Friday morning and will offer a closer look at the state of the labor market. The U.S. economy likely created 145,000 jobs last month, according to analysts surveyed by Refinitiv \u2014 slightly below the average gain of 158,000 jobs year-to-date. Unemployment is expected to remain steady at 3.7 percent, near a 50-year low.\n\nPowell could also shed light on the Fed\u2019s interest rate policy during a speech he\u2019s slated to give in Washington, D.C. on Friday afternoon.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "The latest economic data suggests the U.S. economy, or at least key parts of it, are slowing.", "authors": ["Megan Henney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/06/0/0/Fed-Powell-2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
