You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe likelihood is that Eddie Jones and his coaching team will sit down on Thursday and pencil in the matchday 23s for both games together, although the side to face the USA will depend heavily on how the England squad emerge from what could be a bone-crunching encounter with Tonga on Sunday.\n\nEven though England have 31 players to choose from, at least one will be needed to double-up and start both games, given both Mako Vunipola and Jack Nowell have been ruled out of the tournament until the third pool match against Argentina at the very least.\n\nTaking that into account, it\u2019s certain that both Joe Marler and Ellis Genge \u2013 the two remaining loosehead options \u2013 will need to play in both matches, while Nowell\u2019s absence means the back-three will be light on rotation for the second match.\n\nWith all that in mind, we\u2019ve attempted to pick the side England boss Jones should select on Friday morning for their opening fixture of the Rugby World Cup.\n\nClick through the gallery below to see who we\u2019ve selected.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

England vs Tonga predicted team 1/24 England vs Tonga Who should Eddie Jones select in his opening squad for the Rugby World Cup? Reuters 2/24 1. Joe Marler With Vunipola absent, Jones would be wise to go with experience and Marler\u2019s XX caps bring just that. The Harlequins prop looked to have no chance of featuring at the World Cup when he retired last season, but could end up being the first name on the teamsheet in the opening match of the campaign. REUTERS 3/24 2. Jamie George The expectation is that Jones will go fully loaded for the opening game and then look to rest his best players where possible, given it will give them just under two weeks to prepare for their Argentina test. George is certainly one of those, and with two other hookers in the squad in Luke Cowan-Dickie and Jack Singleton, Jones can afford to give George a good hit-out before standing him down for the week. Getty Images 4/24 3. Kyle Sinckler This selection doesn\u2019t seem to be too much of an issue, given that Kyle Sinckler will bring form, power and pace to the pack if selected against Tonga while Dan Cole has a vast amount of experience at World Cups to deal with the job at hand. However, given the physicality of the Pacific Islanders, it might be sensible to deploy Sinckler first to give Tonga a few problems of their own. Getty Images 5/24 4. Maro Itoje Now we start to get to the tricky positions. If Mark Wilson fails to get through full training as he manages a knee injury, then he cannot realistically be considered for the opening fixture. That could then leave England in a bit of a whole, and as a result, we\u2019re selecting Itoje to play just 40 minutes. Jones could then send on Courtney Lawes for the second 40, with both slated to start against the USA. EPA 6/24 5. George Kruis Joining Itoje in the second row is his Saracens colleague George Kruis. The lock has enjoyed a wonderful return to form over the last year and his lineout expertise could prove a handy tool against Tonga, whose set-piece could prove a weakness. Getty Images 7/24 6. Tom Curry The absence of Wilson, if he fails to recover, leaves Jones with a tricky situation. He could start the inexperienced Lewis Ludlam on the blindside, deploy Courtney Lawes there, or choose to go with his double-openside tactic of Tom Curry and Sam Underhill. It\u2019s the latter that we\u2019re going for, as Curry fills the No 6 shirt having impressed in the World Cup warm-up games. EPA 8/24 7. Sam Underhill Underhill takes the No 7 shirt to provide England with that double-edge at the breakdown. If England can disrupt Tongan possession and slow them down at the ruck, it negates a lot of their best qualities. Both Curry and Underhill would then be stood down for the second match, allowing Lawes to start at 6 and Ludlam to start on the openside. EPA 9/24 8. Billy Vunipola It looks guaranteed that Vunipola will start against the country of his heritage with Wilson struggling, and as Jones has said over the last few weeks, the best way to get him at his best is to get the No 8 playing minutes. That could potentially see Vunipola double up and face the USA too, but it\u2019s hoped that Wilson will be back in time to start. EPA 10/24 9. Ben Youngs Youngs remains the first-choice scrum-half for now and should get the nod to start the campaign unless Willi Heinz has done enough in training to oust him from the shirt. REUTERS 11/24 10. George Ford England are keen to stay away from the brutality that will be thrown their way from the Tonga defence, and as such it looks like George Ford will start alongside Owen Farrell to ensure the ball is moved around to the outside backs. Ford impressed in playing every game of the warm-up series, and deserves to start the opening match on merit alone. REUTERS 12/24 11. Jonny May Just wind him up and let him go. May\u2019s in the form of his life, and will start in Japan as their first-choice wing. Getty Images 13/24 12. Owen Farrell Farrell captains the team from the No 12 shirt \u2013 which he returned to for the record victory over Ireland last month \u2013 in order to add that creativity to the midfield. Farrell is big enough to bring the physicality needed in an inside centre, but it\u2019s the ability to move the ball outside him that will be the most important quality needed. Action Images via Reuters 14/24 13. Manu Tuilagi It seems the smartest thing to do in selecting Tuilagi to fight power with power against Tonga, and then wrap him up in cotton wool for the Argentina game. With Henry Slade short on minutes after a knee injury ruled him out of the warm-up games, and Jonathan Joseph down the pecking order, Tuilagi could cause havoc in the opening game \u2013 but he is needed for much later in the tournament and a 50-minute hit-out before giving Slade minutes looks the best option. Getty Images 15/24 14. Anthony Watson This is where the back-line selection gets tricky. With Nowell injured, England will have to reply on Elliot Daly and Anthony Watson looking after the No 15 shirt. However, Joe Cokanasiga is another who has struggled with a knee injury this week, and you wouldn\u2019t want to expose Ruaridh McConnochie to the Tongans in his first fully competitive international Test. As a result, Watson will be needed to start on the wing. Action Images via Reuters 16/24 15. Elliot Daly Daly could be another player forced to double-up, as you would rather push the new Saracens addition to go back-to-back rather than Watson, given the latter\u2019s recent injury problems. Daly has proven he has that in him before, having played back-to-back between on the Lions tour ahead of the first Test, and with Nowell returning later in the tournament, Daly could be rested in one of the latter pool games. PA 17/24 16. Luke Cowan-Dickie Seems to be the natural understudy to George given that Jack Singleton is yet to play any minutes at hooker. Action Images via Reuters 18/24 17. Ellis Genge Could play a pivotal role in this World Cup off the bench as he did against Italy, with his injection of power likely to sap the energy reserves of the Tongan pack. AFP/Getty Images 19/24 18. Dan Cole A wise-old head to bring on in the closing stages. EPA 20/24 19. Joe Launchbury The Wasps lock will cover the second row, but with one eye on him starting against the USA, his minutes should be limited. AFP/Getty Images 21/24 20. Courtney Lawes Can come on for Itoje at half-time or soon after in order to allow both to go again on Thursday. Getty Images 22/24 21. Willi Heinz Provides cover for Youngs but should get enough minutes under his belt to push his claims for a starting spot later in the tournament to keep Youngs on his toes. Getty Images 23/24 22. Henry Slade Provides cover for fly-half if the worst happens to Ford and Farrell, but more use as a replacement for Tuilagi and an early introduction would be useful to give him minutes. Getty Images 24/24 23. Joe Cokanasiga/Ruaridh McConnochie If fit, Cokanasiga takes the final place on the bench as he can bring a second-half impact on the wing and Watson can cover full-back should anything happen to Daly. However, his fitness is under a big question mark, and should he fail to recover from the knee injury he\u2019s been struggling with, McConnochie will get the nod.
