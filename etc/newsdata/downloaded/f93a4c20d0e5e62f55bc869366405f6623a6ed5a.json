I couldn\u2019t go through what Meghan\u2019s been subjected to now, never mind throughout pregnancy & whilst becoming a new mom. Absolutely mind blowing.'\n\nAnother said: 'I respect Meghan. She's not asking you to adore her, to worship at her feet, but you treat justly and fairly. She's willing to fight for that because surviving is not enough. Her husband is unwilling to be bullied to appease you and your entitlement.'\n\nWhile a third added: 'How can you seriously NOT feel for Harry and Megan? How can you say that they live an easy life? Money is not enough to lead a happy life.'\n\nThe documentary saw Prince Harry discuss his struggles with mental health, while admitting his mother's death still haunted him.\n\nMeghan, meanwhile, opened up about her struggles with the British media and how she was unprepared for the level of scrutiny she has faced since marrying the Prince.\n\nSympathy for the couple was widespread online and the couple topped Twitter trends in the UK.\n\nHowever, the reaction wasn't all positive.\n\nOne user wrote: ' I wouldn't feel too sorry for them. We (as taxpayers) gave them millions recently so they could do some decorating.'\n\nAnother added: 'If only they had a tour of the UK? You know, have a chat to the people/plebs who pay for everything they have. How good that would have been. Oh well.'\n\nWhile a third commented: 'I\u2019ve really gone off Harry and Megan. The more I see from them at the moment, the more they annoy me. They could do with taking a leaf out of Will and Kate\u2019s book.'\n\nSome fans appeared worried for Prince Harry's mental health after a candid interview.\n\nOne commented: 'Think it\u2019s clear to see that Harry carries some deep scares from the death of his mum & it\u2019s clear the fear he carries & the overwhelming need to protect his wife but I think he needs help, it\u2019s crippling his wellbeing I think.'\n\nIn the documentary, Prince Harry revealed that every click and flash of a camera in the public eye gives him 'the worst reminder of her life as opposed to the best'.\n\nIn the documentary, Harry said that he felt significant pressure being a member of the royal family in the spotlight, and was particularly stressed by the memories of his mother's relationship with the press.\n\nHe was asked: 'Do you feel at peace in a way yet or is it still a sort of wound that festers?'\n\nTo which he replied said: 'I think probably a wound that festers. I think being part of this family, in this role, in this job, every single time I see a camera, every single time I hear a click, every single time I see a flash it takes me straight back, so in that respect it's the worst reminder of her life as opposed to the best.\n\n'My mum taught me a certain set of values that I will always try to uphold, despite the role and the job that sometimes that entails.\n\n'I will always protect my family and now I have a family to protect.\n\n'So everything that she went through, and what happened to her, is incredibly important every single day, and that is not me being paranoid, that is just me not wanting a repeat of the past.\n\n'If anybody else knew what I knew, be it a father or be it a husband, be it anyone, you would probably be doing exactly what I am doing as well.\n\n'Everything that she went through and what happened to her is still incredibly raw every single day. That is not me being paranoid, that is me not wanting a repeat of the past.'\n\nIn the documentary, Harry described the way he deals with the pressures of his life as being a matter of 'constant management', adding: 'I thought I was out of the woods and then suddenly it all came back, and this is something that I have to manage.\n\n'Part of this job, and part of any job, like everybody, is putting on a brave face and turning a cheek to a lot of the stuff, but again, for me and again for my wife, of course there is a lot of stuff that hurts, especially when the majority of it is untrue.\n\n'But all we need to do is focus on being real, and focus on being the people that we are, and standing up for what we believe in.\n\n'I will not be bullied into playing a game that killed my mum.'", "description": "Royal fans have paid tribute to Meghan Markle and Prince Harry on social media after an ITV documentary about their trip to Africa aired tonight, laying bare their struggles with public scrutiny.", "authors": ["Danyal Hussain For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/23/19968366-0-image-a-2_1571610185165.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
