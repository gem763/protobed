Lovecraft, whose horrific creations warp the very fabric of reality. That might explain why no one noticed the problem with the game\u2019s compass icon in the six years since its release.\n\nHad Minor Key Games\u2019 David Lindsey Pittman not pointed out the error on Twitter, I certainly never would have noticed the reversal of East and West. The compass as seen in the image above only appears on the screen as such until picked up, after which it\u2019s just a tiny arrow on the game\u2019s minimap. It\u2019s no wonder no one caught it. Well, until now.\n\nInstead of quietly slipping in the fix, as I would have done, Pittman semi-proudly presents Eldritch build 406.\n\nAnd all is right with the world\u2019s cardinal directions.", "description": "First-person retro roguelike Eldritch is inspired by the works of H.P.
