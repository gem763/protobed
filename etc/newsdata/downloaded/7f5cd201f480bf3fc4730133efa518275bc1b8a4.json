Two people have died. Yesterday, the Washington Post reported that health officials are investigating one specific chemical from cannabis samples: vitamin E acetate.\n\nWhat is vitamin E acetate?\n\nYou\u2019ve heard of vitamin E; like other vitamins, you need to eat it to live. It\u2019s most commonly found in vegetable oils, nuts, seeds, and some leafy vegetables.\n\nThe acetate form of vitamin E is edible, but it\u2019s especially common in skincare products because it lasts longer on the shelf than other forms of vitamin E. It\u2019s considered safe to use topically or to ingest.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s safe to breathe. Unnamed officials told the Washington Post that its \u201coil-like properties could be associated with the kinds of respiratory symptoms that many patients have reported: cough, shortness of breath and chest pain.\u201d\n\nHow sure are they that they\u2019ve found what\u2019s causing the illness?\n\nNot at all. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) page on the illness still says that \u201cthe investigation has not identified any specific substance or e-cigarette product that is linked to all cases.\u201d\n\nMany of the people who fell ill had been using cannabis products. Some, but not all, of the cannabis products were able to be tested for contaminants. And most of those tested positive for vitamin E acetate.\n\nNew York State\u2019s public health department said in a statement that after testing product samples provided by patients, they found vitamin E acetate in \u201cnearly all\u201d cannabis-containing samples, including at least one product from each patient, but none of the nicotine-only samples.\n\nAs a result, vitamin E acetate is now a \u201ckey focus\u201d of New York\u2019s investigation and apparently also the FDA\u2019s.\n\nHow can I know if my vaping products are safe?\n\nSo far, there\u2019s no foolproof way. Remember, we still don\u2019t know if vitamin E acetate is really what\u2019s causing the illnesses. It could be a red herring, or it could be one of several causes. And vitamin E acetate isn\u2019t necessarily listed on labels.\n\nThe CDC\u2019s recommendations to the public include not vaping until this whole thing is figured out. They also ask people not to buy vaping supplies \u201coff the street\u201d or to use cannabis-containing vapes, and not to add anything to your vape liquid. If you are concerned that a product is using is making you sick, call poison control or seek medical help, and consider reporting the product to the FDA.", "description": "Over 200 people, many of them teens, have fallen ill with a respiratory condition that seems to be linked to vaping.
