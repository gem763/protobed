MPs blast Thomas Cook's handing out of millions in 'rewards for 'failure'", "language": "en", "text": "Thomas Cook bosses were branded \u2018deluded\u2019 yesterday as furious MPs demanded they hand back millions of pounds in \u2018rewards for failure\u2019.\n\nIn a blistering exchange in the wake of the travel giant\u2019s collapse, MPs accused executives of covering up the true state of the firm\u2019s finances for almost a decade.\n\nFormer Thomas Cook chairman Frank Meysman was ordered to show more humility after bragging of having \u201820million happy customers\u2019.\n\nMr Fankhauser, 59, who raked in \u00a38.4million in pay and perks since he took the top job in 2014, refused to commit to handing any of it back when asked repeatedly by MPs. He is pictured above today\n\nOne MP even questioned whether directors had broken the law by continuing to trade \u2013 and sell millions of holidays \u2013 while the company was effectively insolvent.\n\nFive of Cook\u2019s most senior managers appeared in public for the first time since the firm\u2019s implosion last month resulted in the loss of up to 9,000 UK jobs.\n\nThe last of 150,000 holidaymakers stranded abroad have now been flown home as part of Britain\u2019s biggest ever peacetime repatriation.\n\nFormer Thomas Cook employees are pictured outside. Thomas Cook bosses were branded \u2018deluded\u2019 yesterday as furious MPs demanded they hand back millions of pounds in \u2018rewards for failure\u2019\n\nFormer Cook employees dressed in their uniforms attended the hearing of the Commons business committee along with customers whose holidays were ruined.\n\nCommittee chairman Labour\u2019s Rachel Reeves told Mr Meysman after he spoke of Cook\u2019s \u2018successes\u2019: \u2018I think you\u2019re deluded about the business that you ran.\n\n\u2018It has gone under because of the decisions made collectively by your management team. So when you point to the success, maybe you might want to have a little more humility?\u2019\n\nCommittee member Stephen Kerr, Tory MP for Stirling, said: \u2018The fact is this board was rewarded for failure. I would love to run my household in this way.\u2019\n\nFormer Thomas Cook chairman Frank Meysman was ordered to show more humility after bragging of having \u201820million happy customers\u2019\n\nIndependent MP Antoinette Sandbach suggested executives had \u2018potentially overstated\u2019 the value of the company for years.\n\nShe warned: \u2018You are still required under UK law as a company director to ensure your business is not trading while insolvent.\u2019\n\nIn his opening remarks, Cook\u2019s Swiss chief executive Peter Fankhauser appeared shaken and remorseful, telling MPs he was \u2018deeply sorry\u2019 to staff and customers that he and colleagues \u2018could not save this iconic brand\u2019.\n\nHe said the 178-year-old company\u2019s huge \u00a31.7billion debt pile meant bosses were not able to transform the old-fashioned tour operator quickly enough to compete with nimble online rivals.\n\nThe firm burned through \u00a31.2billion in interest and refinancing costs on its debt since 2012.\n\nMr Fankhauser, 59, who raked in \u00a38.4million in pay and perks since he took the top job in 2014, refused to commit to handing any of it back when asked repeatedly by MPs.\n\nThe committee pointed out that Cook\u2019s directors had received \u00a320million in bonuses in the past five years. Mr Fankhauser stressed that around \u00a34million of his bonuses was paid in shares which were now worthless.\n\nBut Miss Reeves told him: \u2018The number of times you\u2019ve said sorry...it just rings rather hollow when you\u2019re not willing to put something back.\u2019", "description": "Five of Thomas Cook's most senior managers appeared in public for the first time since the firm's implosion last month resulted in the loss of up to 9,000 UK jobs.", "authors": ["James Salmon Associate City Editor For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/22/19757098-0-image-a-16_1571174461264.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
