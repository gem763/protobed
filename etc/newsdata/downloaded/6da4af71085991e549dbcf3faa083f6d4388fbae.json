Technology shares, a sector of the S&P 500 that\n\nhas been closely tied to trade progress, fell 0.92%.\n\nDrugmakers Merck & Co Inc MRK.N and Pfizer Inc PFE.N\n\nrose after reporting upbeat third-quarter results, gaining 3.5%\n\nand 2.5%, respectively. The healthcare sector , which\n\nhas been the second-worst performer among the 11 major S&P 500\n\nsectors this year, rose 1.16% as the session's best performer.\n\nA rotation into value stocks that investors have posited for\n\nmonths seems be taking hold, Abbasi said, pointing to recent\n\ngains in the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF as evidence.\n\nThe ETF has traded below 56 since May and could be set for\n\nfurther upside after a recent rally from below 50, he said.\n\n\"We're seeing some of those high-flying tech names\n\nstruggle,\" Abbasi said. \"We're getting that risk-on move from\n\nsectors that have been ignored all year, the sectors that\n\nhaven't been loved.\"\n\nApple and Microsoft fell, as did\n\nAmazon.com .\n\nMSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe\n\ngained 0.05%, while the pan-European STOXX 600 index\n\nlost 0.16%.

The losses in Europe followed a mixed performance in Asia,\n\nwhere Japan's Nikkei rose 0.4% to reach levels last seen\n\na year ago. Shanghai blue chips dithered either side\n\nof flat.\n\nBenchmark 10-year U.S. notes rose 4/32 in price\n\nto yield 1.8367%.\n\nThe dollar index fell 0.09%, with the euro up\n\n0.13% to $1.1112.
