The service \u201ctokenizes\u201d stored cards, replacing account numbers with digital identifiers only good at Netflix.\n\nThat removes a monetary rationale to hack into a Netflix account. So why bother?\n\n\u201cIt appears to be just plain old theft!\u201d said Chet Wisniewski, principal research scientist at the security firm Sophos. \u201cI don\u2019t really see anything to it other than getting free Netflix Premium.\u201d\n\nThat $15.99-a-month plan provides video in 4K Ultra HD resolution but also allows four simultaneous streams, up from the two of the $12.99 per month Standard plan, making them a more attractive prize to share.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trading them simply to have status with their friends,\u201d he said of discussions about stolen Netflix accounts on various hacking forums.\n\nWisniewski said most compromises either involve phishing scams that fool victims into giving up their passwords \u2013 something Oxford, U.K.-based Sophos warned of last September \u2013 or trying passwords leaked in data breaches. He noted that you can safely check a password to see if it\u2019s been exposed at the breach-tracking site Have I Been Pwned.\n\nMilanesi said she does have a Premium plan but had not received any Netflix-phishing messages, leaving it a mystery how the hackers could have obtained her password.\n\nTired of #$%& passwords? Single Sign-on could be a savior\n\nYour iPhone might have just been hacked: Google found iPhone security flaws that allowed websites to hack iOS users 'en masse'\n\nNetflix\u2019s security help emphasizes the importance of not reusing passwords, and the company says it watches for odd account activity.\n\n\u201cThe Netflix security team uses a variety of measures to protect our members, including monitoring various sites on the internet for credential dumps where data thieves post stolen usernames and passwords,\u201d emailed Katy Dormer, Netflix communications director. \u201cWe notify users to change their password when suspicious activity is detected. We also notify users when there is a sign-in to their account on a new device.\u201d\n\nIn this case, however, the attacker changed the email address on the account first. That\u2019s where\n\nWisniewski found fault with Netflix: It let him change the email on his account without confirmation via a message sent to the previous address.\n\n\u201cI would want the behavior to be to go to the old address and say, please click this link to approve the change,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s permissive by default instead of blocked by default.\u201d\n\nWisniewski voiced some sympathy for Netflix in this situation, given its competition for viewers and how relatively little is at stake in a Netflix hack: \u201cThe more secure they get, the more inconvenient it gets for their customers.\u201d\n\nRob Pegoraro is a tech writer based out of Washington, D.C.
