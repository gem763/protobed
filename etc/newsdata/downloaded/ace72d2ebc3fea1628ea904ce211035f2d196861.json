USA TODAY\n\nHOUSTON \u2014 In their quest to regain their dignity, and then get on even ground, and then think about maybe making the postseason, the Washington Nationals rolled out 50 players this season. Some were well-paid superstars, a few more were journeymen on short-term commitments, and others still merely a hope and a prayer in the form of a waiver-wire claim.\n\nWednesday night, with a championship perhaps hanging in the balance, the Nationals leaned on every last resource they had to once again hold off the Houston Astros until they could deliver a punishing, decisive blow.\n\nStephen Strasburg battled Justin Verlander and the exhausting Astros lineup to a standstill for six innings and 114 pitches, long enough for one of the Nationals\u2019 itinerant heroes to come to the fore.\n\nThis time, it was Kurt Suzuki, a veteran catcher of 13 seasons and three playoff runs, who manhandled a Justin Verlander fastball for a seventh-inning, go-ahead home run that may one day be remembered as a championship blow.\n\nVERLANDER: Astros pitcher sets postseason strikeout record\n\nASTROS: Commissioner concerned about controversy with assistant GM\n\nSuzuki\u2019s blast unleashed a seventh-inning cavalcade of runs \u2013 six in all \u2013 as they finished Verlander and then watched the Astros self-implode. Two innings later, Minute Maid Park largely emptied, they claimed a 12-3 victory that sends them back to the nation\u2019s capital with a commanding 2-0 World Series lead.\n\nWin two of three at Nationals Park, and D.C. will have its first World Series champion since the 1924 Washington Senators survived a seven-game fight against the New York Giants.\n\nThat was two franchises ago in Washington\u2019s largely checkered baseball history. And perhaps that\u2019s what\u2019s most stunning about this Nationals run: For much of October, save for two harrowing elimination games, they\u2019ve made it look easy.\n\nThey\u2019re now on an 18-2 run counting the final days of the regular season and are 10-2 in these playoffs.\n\nHistory may record this Game 2 as the Series-deciding win, one that will look like a blowout to future generations.\n\nUntil the seventh, it was a standoff that eventually devolved as the Nationals imposed their will.\n\nWashington Nationals' Adam Eaton celebrates his two-run home run with Victor Robles in the eighth inning.

He\u2019d yielded a double to Yuli Gurriel after a seven-pitch battle, and after Alvarez\u2019s walk, Carlos Correa worked a full count off him.\n\nBut Straburg induced a popout from Correa for a crucial second out, and Astros manager A.J. Hinch tossed rookie Kyle Tucker to pinch hit.\n\nWhile Tucker worked an eight-pitch at-bat, it was Strasburg who seemed in control of the moment, all the way through the final pitch, a curveball Tucker half-heartedly waved at for the final out.\n\nAfter Suzuki\u2019s home run, Hinch tried a similar gambit. It failed spectacularly.\n\nVerlander issued a walk to Victor Robles, finishing his night, and after reliever Ryan Pressly issued a walk and got a sacrifice bunt, the great Juan Soto loomed at the plate.\n\nHinch wanted no part of the rookie who\u2019d already laced four hits in two games, so he opted to load the base. It was the first intentional walk the Astros have issued all year.\n\nAnd it fired up the merry-go-around.\n\nHowie Kendrick followed with a two-out smash off Alex Bregman\u2019s glove at third for an infield single Then, one of those forgettable waiver claims, Asdrubal Cabrera, lashed a Pressly pitch for a two-run single.\n\nSuddenly, 2-2 became 6-2. And the Astros still weren\u2019t out of the nightmare.\n\n\"Clearly I think there's a lot of downside given that I haven't done it all year,\" Hinch said of the intentional pass. \"But ironically I thought it was our best chance to limit their scoring, and instead it poured gasoline on a fire that was already burning.\"\n\nBregman blues\n\nAfter a grim Game 1 performance that included a ninth-inning strikeout in a 5-4 loss, Bregman said he had to turn things around, \u201cASAP.\u201d He literally did, crushing a Strasburg mistake changeup to tie the game 2-2 in the bottom of the first.\n\nBut his blue period was not yet done.\n\nBregman wasted yet another Astros scoring chance by grounding out with two outs in the third. And in that neverending seventh inning, he couldn\u2019t corral Kendrick\u2019s ground ball, allowing the crucial fourth run to score.\n\nTwo batters later, it become an utter circus, when he charged a Ryan Zimmerman grounder and threw wildly to first base. Zimmerman had an RBI single and another run scored on Bregman\u2019s error.\n\nBoth teams will fly to Washington on Thursday morning. The flight may feel longest to Bregman.\n\nState of the series\n\nThe stage now shifts to Nationals Park for Games 3, 4 and \u2013 if necessary \u2013 5, with Anibal Sanchez facing Zack Greinke on Friday night. Given their deficit, the Astros may consider bringing ace Gerrit Cole back on early rest in Game 4 \u2013 or regular rest if forecasted rains pelt the area Saturday.\n\n\"It\u2019s gonna be lit,\" Eaton said after the game. \"I think it\u2019s going to be quite ridiculous.\u201d", "description": "Washington scored six runs to go ahead in the seventh inning and kept scoring in the last two innings to win Game 2 in a rout.", "authors": ["Gabe Lacques", "Published A.M.
