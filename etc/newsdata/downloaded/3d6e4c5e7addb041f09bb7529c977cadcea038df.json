Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 For years, the Interior Department resisted proposals to raise the height of its towering Shasta Dam in Northern California. The department\u2019s own scientists and researchers concluded that doing so would endanger rare plants and animals in the area, as well as the bald eagl e, and devastate the West Coast\u2019s salmon industry downstream.\n\nBut the project is going forward now, in a big win for a powerful consortium of California farmers that stands to profit substantially by gaining access to more irrigation water from a higher dam and has been trying to get the project approved for more than a decade .\n\nFor much of the past decade, the chief lobbyist for the group was David Bernhardt. Today, Mr. Bernhardt is the Interior Secretary.\n\nIt is not the first time that the Interior Department under Mr. Bernhardt\u2019s leadership has taken actions that benefit his former client, the Westlands Water District, a state entity created at the behest of, and largely controlled by, some of California\u2019s wealthiest farmers. Mr. Bernhardt also promoted the weakening of an endangered-species regulation that would get Westlands more water, a move that has put him under scrutiny from his department\u2019s inspector general.", "description": "David Bernhardt is backing a plan to raise the height of the Shasta Dam in California even though his department\u2019s experts have warned against the change.", "authors": ["Coral Davenport"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/26/climate/00CLI-BERNHARDT1/merlin_158498610_a9d01594-ec7c-45fd-9445-a9fdfb47d307-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
