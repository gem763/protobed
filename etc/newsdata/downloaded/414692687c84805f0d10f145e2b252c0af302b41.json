The Cubs had won five straight before that, outscoring the opponents 59-18 during that stretch.\n\n\u201cWe believe our team is at our best when we play the best teams,\u201d Cincinnati manager David Bell said. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing more than that - we can play with those teams.\u201d\n\nThe Cubs and Milwaukee Brewers trail the NL Central-leading St. Louis Cardinals by three games. Chicago and Milwaukee are tied for the second NL wild-card spot, 1\u00bd games behind the Washington Nationals, who hold the first wild card.\n\nChicago opens a four-game series against St. Louis on Thursday night at Wrigley Field.\n\n\u201cWe all know what\u2019s in front of us,\u201d Cubs starter Jon Lester said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to play good baseball this weekend, and hopefully we can do that.\u201d\n\nWith two outs and none on in the top of the 10th, Cincinnati\u2019s Aristides Aquino started the winning rally against James Norwood (0-1) with a single to left. After Aquino advanced on a wild pitch, Josh VanMeter walked, putting runners on first and second. Iglesias then doubled to right to score Aquino with the go-ahead run.\n\nAmir Garrett (5-3) struck out Kyle Schwarber to end the ninth and Raisel Iglesias worked around a one-out double in the 10th for his 33rd save. Nico Hoerner lined out to right to end it.\n\nThe Reds finished with an 11-8 record against the Cubs this season.\n\nReds slugger Eugenio Su\u00e1rez hit his 48th homer, one behind Pete Alonso of the New York Mets for the major league lead. The total is the most ever by a Venezuelan player, breaking the previous mark of 47 by Andr\u00e9s Galarraga.\n\nSu\u00e1rez also tied the NL record for homers by a third baseman. Mike Schmidt of the Phillies (1980) and Adri\u00e1n Beltr\u00e9 of the Dodgers (2004) are the others reach the mark.\n\nCincinnati starter Tyler Mahle allowed just one run on one hit in six innings.\n\nLester allowed one run on six hits in five-plus innings.\n\nSu\u00e1rez\u2019s solo shot in the fourth inning gave the Reds a 1-0 lead.\n\nThe Cubs tied it in the bottom half of the inning. Nicholas Castellanos led off with a double, advanced to third on a wild pitch and scored on a sacrifice fly by Schwarber.\n\nCincinnati took a 2-1 lead in the seventh on a sacrifice fly by Alex Blandino before Willson Contreras tied it with a two-out solo blast, which came on an 0-2 pitch from reliever Robert Stephenson in the bottom of the inning.\n\nCELEBRATION\n\nSu\u00e1rez was presented with a huge 9-liter bottle of champagne by the Reds in the clubhouse. He and his teammates drank from it to celebrate his Venezuelan homer record.\n\n\u201cThis is absolutely amazing,\u201d he said. \u201cI appreciate all my teammates and all of Cincinnati.\u201d\n\nCENTRAL SHOWDOWN\n\nThe Cubs conclude their final homestand with a four-game set against the Cardinals starting Thursday night. The teams then play three games in St. Louis next weekend.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at that schedule at the beginning of the season, you hope you have an eight-game lead by the time this occurs,\u201d Cubs manager Joe Maddon said. \u201cBut then you get in the position we\u2019re in, you\u2019re thankful that you have to play them that many times.\u201d\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nReds: C/INF Kyle Farmer (strained left oblique) was activated from the 10-day IL before the game. \u2026 ING Freddy Galvis missed his fourth straight game with left knee soreness.\n\nCubs: Closer Craig Kimbrel (right elbow inflammation) threw with the rest of the relievers before the game. He\u2019s likely to be activated from the 10-day IL on Thursday or Friday. \u2026 INF Addison Russell (concussion) is still in the concussion protocol, but worked out on the field for the first time since being hit in the head Sept. 8.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nReds: Ace Luis Castillo (15-6, 3.22 ERA) faces Cy Young Award winner Jacob deGrom (9-8, 2.61) Friday night in the opener of a three-game home series against the Mets.\n\nCubs: RHP Kyle Hendricks (11-9, 3.26 ERA) starts the opener of the St. Louis series Thursday night with RHP Jack Flaherty (10-8, 3.05) going for Cardinals. Hendricks has a 1.75 ERA in 13 home starts, while Flaherty is 6-2 with a 0.90 ERA in his last nine starts.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The improving Cincinnati Reds' pitching staff cooled off the previously surging Chicago Cubs' offense.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Jackson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/19/reds_cubs_baseball_35771_c0-1099-2397-2496_s1770x1032.jpg?296e6e1eaa21f988dc9683507dff31c8781732b8", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
