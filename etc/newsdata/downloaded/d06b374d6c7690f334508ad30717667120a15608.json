If you\u2019re chronically craving sashimi, but looking for a twist, it\u2019s a perfect solution. Here are our top five poke restaurants in town. You\u2019re welcome.\n\nPokeworld\n\nPokeworld offers a range of seafood and sauces. Photo: Veronica Lin/SCMP\n\nThis hidden gem in Sheung Wan is hands-down our favourite. You can choose from a wide variety of proteins, including salmon, tuna, marlin, octopus, prawn, smoked chicken and tofu. The eel poke is also a good option if you\u2019re in the mood for something hot. There is also the option to swap out the white rice base for brown rice, salad or soba noodles.\n\nObviously, with so much choice, you should feel free to experiment, but we absolutely insist you try the vinegar sesame dressing, which adds the perfect acidity to your dish.\n\nPoke restaurant review: A fresh fish bowl for the summer in the heart of Causeway Bay\n\nThe restaurant\u2019s sky-blue and white motif, and the upbeat playlist makes us feel like we\u2019re on holiday, no matter how far from the truth that might be. What more could you ask for?\n\nOur only complaint is that the seating area is quite cramped, and there\u2019s a good chance you might not be able to find a seat during peak hours. It\u2019s worth the wait though!\n\nPrice: Poke bowls start at HK$85, while the salads and rolls start at HK$70.\n\n\u200bAddress: 8 Hillier Street, Sheung Wan\n\nPokehood\n\nPokehood has beef and chicken meat options. Photo: Veronica Lin/SCMP\n\nWhile the side dish options at Pokehood are limited, meat lovers will be happy to know that both beef and chicken poke bowls are available, as well as the usual seafood.\n\nBut we couldn\u2019t resist the mixed sashimi bowl which had tuna and salmon belly mixed with a Hawaiian sweet soy sauce. The seaweed salad makes the dish even more flavourful.\n\nCompared to poke places on Hong Kong Island, this is definitely on the cheaper end, but the quality of sashimi is just as good!\n\nPrice: House bowls start at HK$43.\n\nAddress: Kinho Industrial Building, Flat B2, G/F, Block 1, 20-24 Au Pui Wan Street, Sha Tin\n\nFive of the best chocolate chip cookies in Hong Kong, from Pret to Mrs Fields, and what makes them so delicious\n\nPololi Flagship\n\nTry the Da Big Kahuna bowl at Pololi Flagship. Photo: Veronica Lin/SCMP\n\nPololi (which means \u201chungry\u201d in Hawaiian) really tries to bring the tropical feel to the city, by decorating its shops with surfboards, ukuleles, and leis. Add all this to the uber soft cushions on the chairs, and you have the perfect spot to chill with a bowl of poke. The staff are also incredibly friendly, which makes the dine-in experience all the more enjoyable.\n\nThe restaurant serves an array of appetising poke bowls, from avocado mayo ahi tuna to yuzu sesame salmon. But if you\u2019re not in the mood for raw fish, there\u2019s also an interesting variety of side dishes, including avocado fries, Flyin\u2019 High (grilled BBQ chicken), or spam musubi, a sort of spam sushi.\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling particularly pololi, go for Da Big Kahuna, a build-your-own poke bowl with 270 grams of protein, rather than the regular 180 grams. Good luck choosing between their 20-plus toppings.\n\nPrice: Poke bowls start at HK$90 while musubis and small dishes cost HK$25-HK$128.\n\nAddress: Shop C, G/F Fashion Walk, Great George Street, Causeway Bay\n\nPoke HK\n\nTry one of the house bowls at Poke HK if you can't decide on your own. Photo: Veronica Lin/SCMP\n\nThis shop offers a wide selection of bases, toppings and sauces, but if you\u2019re too hungry to decide between all the different options, pick one of their house bowls.\n\nWe like the Ahi San, which mixes tuna, edamame and spring onions with a wasabi yogurt sauce, and the Vegan, which combines mushrooms, tofu, and edamame with a mushroom and kelp sauce. It\u2019s not all \u201csuper food\u201d, though; their sweet potato fries are some of the best in the city.\n\nThe ingredients always taste fresh, and every dish features generous amounts of your chosen protein. We also love the help-yourself water station, with the stack of reusable cups and paper straws earns them bonus points.\n\nPrice: Poke bowls start at HK$62, and sides cost HK$18-HK$45.\n\nAddress: G/F, 124 Leighton Rd, Causeway Bay\n\nThe 5 most creative dim sum dishes in Hong Kong\n\nPeek-A-Poke\n\nThere's a great Hawaiian vibe at Peek-A-Poke in Causeway Bay. Photo: Veronica Lin/SCMP\n\nThis joint, which opened less than a year ago, is a relaxing hideaway amidst the hustle and bustle of Causeway Bay. While the menu is almost identical to that of Poke HK, the seating area is a lot more spacious.\n\nThey have a selection of signature bowls to choose from, including a vegan option made with tofu, edamame, and seaweed. Alternatively, you can mix and match your favourite toppings and select the base yourself. We loved the salmon poke with \u201cNutty Buddy\u201d dressing, a mayo-based sauce, and the salmon with honey vinaigrette.\n\nThe staff are also very friendly here.\n\nPrice: House bowls start at HK$66, and sides are between HK$20 and HK$45.\n\nAddress: 16 Haven Street, Causeway Bay\n\nEdited by Nicole Moraleda", "description": "The Hawaiian dish made from diced raw fish has gained massive popularity in recent years.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/pokebowl.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
