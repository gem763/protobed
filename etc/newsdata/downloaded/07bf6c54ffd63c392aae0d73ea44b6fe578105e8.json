The #plantbased hashtag has been used 24 million times on Instagram, and not just for the love of a holistic lifestyle, but for business. The UK plant-based market reached a total value of \u00a3443 million in 2018.\n\nIn a playground of posers, these plant-based Instagrammers aren\u2019t always genuine. Recently, I met a woman at a dinner party who tucked into every meat dish brought to the table. This was no big deal, until she followed me on Instagram and I saw that she proudly bore the plant-based insignia on her profile.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOdds are you also know someone who preaches the benefits of clean eating, but enjoys a vastly different lifestyle offline.\n\nFortunately, there\u2019s a new league of influencers who make no attempt to parade themselves as beacons of health. They\u2019re upfront about who they are and what they eat \u2013 and that is sweet, sweet junk.\n\nOozing chocolate. Mountains of sour lollies. Rainbow bagels overflowing with cream cheese. Such visuals are the cornerstone of Instagram\u2019s increasingly popular junk food accounts: the snackfluencers.\n\nThe gloriously calorific feed of @JunkBanter (Picture: @junkbanter)\n\nAccounts like @JunkBanter, @CandyHunting, and @JunkFoodGuru have attracted hundreds of thousands of followers by posting about \u2018rare\u2019 snacks such as honey cornbread and blackberry jam ice cream, cucumber-seasoned crisps, fried Cheeto deviled eggs, and chicken and waffle flavoured cereal.\n\n@JunkBanter\u2019s bio simply reads: \u2018Dumb captions on dumb food pics.\u2019 These are influencers who aren\u2019t conforming to the formulaic, stylised Instagram aesthetic that appears to take foodies from blogging in their basement to a cookbook publishing deal. It\u2019s a visual that screams: come as you are, but make sure you\u2019re slathered in chocolate and dipped in sugar.\n\nScrolling through these feeds will never conjure feelings of guilt over skipping that post-work gym session, or for not thinking that a green smoothie counts as dessert. It\u2019s here that you can truly embrace a bit of gluttony without shame.\n\nKev, a UK-based snackfluencer, sees his Instagram @KevsSnackReviews as a safe space on a platform where people are often pressured to look a certain way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKev tells Metro.co.uk: \u2018I hope people don\u2019t feel bad for eating what they love. Even though I post a lot of junk foods I see them as inspiration for something nice to treat yourself to, or as a gift idea for someone.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t believe in diets myself, everything in moderation is my motto.\u2019\n\nKev credits the popularity of his Instagram to the swell in snack releases. In the past three years, he\u2019s seen the interest in his junk food account and other similar accounts grow.\n\n\u2018I think people have always loved new snacks and sweets but now they\u2019re discovering you can find out about them very quickly thanks to Instagram,\u2019 he explains.\n\nThe admin worker, who can\u2019t go past a good old Wispa Gold, sources his supply of the more niche, foreign snacks from import-based companies such as A Taste of the States and GB Gifts.\n\nHe tells us: \u2018Aside from those, I\u2019m often on the hunt in supermarkets, local market stalls and discount stores \u2013 it\u2019s surprising what interesting sweets you can find in places like Poundstretcher!\u2019\n\nNew York-based snackfluencer duo, Dario Torres and Taylor Trachtenberg, have made a living sourcing rare junk food from all over the world. Earlier this year, the couple developed a snack-selling business off the back of their successful Instagram account @TheSuperSnackStore.\n\nEach week, they make nearly \u00a3790, finding their customers from an eclectic mix of pop-up stores, online orders, and home deliveries. Some of their followers make regular purchases \u2013 usually weekly \u2013 and spend between \u00a359 to 79 on snacks alone.\n\nTaylor tells us: \u2018On a weekly basis, our sales grow exponentially. A majority of our customers are looking to spend hundreds at a time. We don\u2019t just sell snacks, it\u2019s an experience for the consumer. These are only snacks you can get if you take a trip across the world.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Super Snack Store\u2019s treasures include white peach Fanta from Japan, tiramisu Oreo thins from Korea and strawberry jelly and ice cream flavoured soda from the United States. Taylor\u2019s personal favourite are the Triple Cheese Cheetos from Japan.\n\n\u2018These have flavours that are not like your ordinary cheesy Cheetos,\u2019 he says. \u2018They have a strong naturally cheesy taste layered to pack a punch that won\u2019t even stain your fingers. These chips take the regular OG Cheetos to a whole new level.\u2019\n\nMost of these snacks won\u2019t be around for long. They\u2019re limited edition, which of course only increases the allure and the hype. We\u2019ve seen shoppers pay ten times retail price for the rare Caramilk, and people becoming \u2018highly distressed\u2019 over the scarcity of orange Cadbury Twirls. Therein lies the climbing appeal of Instagram snack accounts.\n\nWe can only hope that when the next innovation in calorific eating comes to a store near you \u2013 could it be a McDonald\u2019s cheeseburger doughnut? A pickle-flavoured cake pop? \u2013 you\u2019ll be ready. Or better yet, you\u2019ll know a snackfluencer who can hook you up.\n\nMORE: Where to get the best eggs in London\n\nMORE: This male model\u2019s ferocious strut at Paris Fashion Week is going viral\n\nMORE: YouTuber asks people to decorate his room using a Twitter bot\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "These users sourcing 'rare' snacks from all over the world, like honey cornbread and blackberry ice cream and fried Cheeto devilled eggs.", "authors": ["Serena Coady"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/snackfluencers-top-1565_1570880234.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
