Their answers will be published anonymously in Young Post. Then readers vote for their FAVOURITE answer. We will eliminate the contestant with the LEAST votes every week until we have a winner. The ultimate Brain Game winner will win a Mobile Pixel Duex duo monitor, which has been sponsored by searchingc.com, one of Asia\u2019s leading online shopping platforms.\n\nVotes close at midnight on Sunday.\n\nThe contestants Contestant 1\n\n\u201cMy smoke from these blazes is covering everywhere! Pacificean, I\u2019m really sorry that my droughts have caused your surface water temperature to increase.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s OK, Amazorest. I\u2019ll try to recover. Though, if this continues, I may not survive for long. I recently heard that Mr Air, who takes care of all wild animals, has fallen ill and grey. We need to figure out what is causing you to react like this, Amazorest.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t know what happened to me \u2026 I need to be there for the humans \u2026 \u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s hope the humans who don\u2019t understand your worth will soon know how much they need you.\u201d\n\nContestant 2\n\nAmazon Forest: You are so beautiful, so blue.\n\nI wish I were half as beautiful as you.\n\nHow lucky you are,\n\nTo be filled with water.\n\nPacific Ocean: Lungs of the Planet,\n\nYou ungrateful thing!\n\nPeople have given you a good name,\n\nBut they harm me and make me dirty.\n\nAmazon Forest: At least you aren\u2019t set ablaze.\n\nBecause of man-caused climate change,\n\nThese Lungs are damaged.\n\nWhat use is it to be called beautiful?\n\nPacific Ocean: What a shame!\n\nBoth of us have the same fate,\n\nYet we are having this heated debate!\n\nContestant 3\n\nMy health problems have been getting considerably worse. The pesky little beings are really taking a toll on my lungs, to a point where it\u2019s impossible to get even one moment of peace.\n\nWhat I\u2019m afraid of \u2013 and it seems this may already be a reality \u2013 is that there will be permanent consequences. Every tree they chop down is a blow to my\n\nonce majestic forest.\n\nMy messenger relayed to me that you have also been having trouble. I\u2019m sorry to hear that, but I am also eternally grateful to have someone like you to confide in.\n\nContestant 4\n\nMr Pacific Ocean: Long time no see! Why are you in hospital?\n\nMs Amazon Forest: I\u2019ve got a terrible fever. My temperature is so high that I feel like I\u2019m burning! I\u2019ve been giving people a lot of oxygen, but they still continue to farm, cut down trees, and build dams across my river! That really damages my health!\n\nMr Pacific Ocean: Yes, people are really annoying! They keep throwing rubbish on me. My stomach feels terrible!\n\n(Suddenly, Ms Amazon Forest faints)\n\nOh no, somebody please help save her!\n\nContestant 5\n\nBesides the fact that I\u2019m on fire, everything\u2019s fine! How are you doing? They say the reason they\u2019re setting me ablaze is to create more space to grow things on.\n\nThey really don\u2019t appreciate me, do they? I mean, I\u2019m only single-handedly keeping climate change at bay, and, well, if I burn, the world burns with me. Literally.\n\nAnyhow, I\u2019d appreciate it if you could lend your old pal some of that cool water you\u2019ve got so much of. If not, I\u2019ll see you on the other side.\n\nContestant 6\n\nHey buddy, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware of everything that\u2019s been happening on our planet in the past few months. I was on fire for more than two weeks, and have even broken past wildfire records. And since I am known to provide 20 per cent of the Earth\u2019s oxygen, I\u2019m worried this will have a drastic effect on the world. Sadly, it will take centuries for me to recover. I was hoping you could lend me a hand and transfer some water to me. Thanks a lot!\n\nContestant 7\n\nIt\u2019s saddening how we have become worse over the last few decades. And it\u2019s confusing how we constantly give to human beings the necessities they need to live, and yet they are quickly and thoughtlessly draining ours. I wonder how long it will take for them to realise that, by killing us, they are stripping themselves of oxygen and water \u2013 the keys to their survival, and that of the animals living among us. We have to hope that they will see the truth, and wake up, sooner or later.\n\nContestant 8\n\nHi, Pacific, Amazon here! Thanks to your huge reserves of water, there\u2019s a large amount of precipitation. But there\u2019s a sour taste in the rain \u2026 haven\u2019t you recovered from acidification yet? Argh, humans. I\u2019ve been suffering from wildfires lately. More than 88 per cent of my body has been burned. Pacific, we have served many creatures on this planet, and what do we get in return? Silly humans, if I burn, you burn with me!\n\n*In case of dispute, Young Post reserves the right to reserves to decide the result\n\nEdited by Nicole Moraleda", "description": "The ultimate Brain Game winner will win a Mobile Pixels Duex duo monitor.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/af96cee4-df40-11e9-94c8-f27aa1da2f45imagehires110128.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
