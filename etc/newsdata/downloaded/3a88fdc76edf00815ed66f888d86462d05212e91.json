But the profile of the spooky holiday is now big enough for operators to create special concept stores for the occasion.Convenience store operator GS25 has stocked one-third of its stores nationwide with Halloween treats, like snacks packaged like ghosts and stuffed pumpkin toys. It is creating special display corners exclusively selling Halloween-related goods.GS25 started celebrating Halloween in 2017. It said it decided to expand the promotion following robust sales. Last year, sales of cookies during the Halloween promotional period skyrocketed 243 percent compared to the previous week. Sales of stuffed toys and candies jumped 210 percent and 145 percent during the same period, respectively, while Halloween pastry sales rose 96 percent.\u201cHalloween promotional goods are especially popular among kids who tag along to the stores with their parents,\u201d said a spokesperson for GS25. \u201cHalloween hadn\u2019t been a big event for convenience store operators since the timing is very close to Pepero Day.\u201dPepero Day, which falls on Nov. 11, is a romantic holiday when couples exchange the chocolate snack. Along with Valentine\u2019s Day and White Day, when a man gives his romantic partner gifts, it is one of the three major holidays for convenience operators.BGF Retail, which operates the CU convenience store chain, said it will give out tickets for Lotte World\u2019s Halloween festival to a select number of people who purchase a Halloween promotional good and post a picture of it on Facebook. Rival 7-Eleven said it is not actively promoting Halloween, while Emart24 said it introduced several Halloween snacks, like a gimbap in ghost-like packaging.A spokesperson from Emart24 said the company hopes to expand the Halloween promotion next year.Hyundai Department Store Group\u2019s furniture affiliate Hyundai Livart introduced Halloween costumes for kids that feature uniforms from the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d series.
