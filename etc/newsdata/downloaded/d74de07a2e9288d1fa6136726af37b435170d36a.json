I\u2019m happy to be tested anytime, anywhere.\n\n\u201cObviously, reading the story all time time \u2013 there\u2019s a clear agenda to this. I\u2019ve seen this many times. I know where you\u2019re going with it \u2013 I\u2019ve seen it with Raheem Sterling, I\u2019ve seen it with Lewis Hamilton. I can\u2019t win whatever I do.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m disappointed about you guys making the headlines. It\u2019s not about Mo Farah. This is about Alberto Salazar. What\u2019s it got to do with Mo Farah? It\u2019s not Mo Farah. I\u2019m not Alberto and Alberto can only answer that.\u201d\n\nOn Friday it was announced by Nike that the Oregon Project, which was established in 2001, would be closed down.\n\nThe sportswear company said there had been \u201cno orchestrated doping\u201d but felt that \u201cuninformed innuendo and unsubstantiated assertions\u201d had \u201cbecome an unfair burden\u201d on athletes.\n\nFour-time Olympic champion Farah, 36, said: \u201cI am back in London, I have been out of the Oregon Project for two years. I have based myself in London to focus myself on the marathon and to be with friends and family.\n\n\u201cObviously it is not my decision to shut down the Oregon Project. That\u2019s Nike, it\u2019s not me. I\u2019m Mo Farah.\u201d\n\nFarah, who is hoping to repeat his 2018 success in Chicago, defended his record.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf you look back at my history and what I did, and you try to take away what I\u2019ve earned through my hard work.\n\n\u201cIf you look back, where was I in 2007 (at the World Championships) in Osaka? I was half a second behind a medal. I was leading until the bell, and then got blown away. So what does that tell you? I\u2019ve learnt to win races and control races.\u201d\n\nHe added that the allegations against Salazar first came as a surprise to him.\n\nHe said: \u201cAt the time, there was no allegation against me. There was an allegation against Alberto Salazar.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been clear to you, I\u2019ve been honest from day one. I was in Birmingham racing and pulled out of the race in 2015. I wanted some answers. I flew to Portland to get some answers from Alberto.\n\n\u201cI spoke to him face to face and he assured me at the time these were just allegations. \u2018This is not true, there is no allegation against you Mo\u2019. He promised me \u2013 and that hasn\u2019t been true.\u201d\n\nAmerican Galen Rupp, winner of the Chicago Marathon in 2017, was also questioned about the matter. Rupp was still being coached by Salazar when his ban was issued.\n\nRupp said: \u201cI haven\u2019t had any sport-related contact with him (Salazar). I respect the decision, as I always have.\n\n\u201cI am not really going to comment on things like that. It\u2019s obviously out there. I understand it is under appeal and I support him in that appeal, but I am not really going to comment.\n\n\u201cI am really just focused on the race on Sunday. I am going to deal with the coaching thing after that.\u201d", "description": "Sir Mo Farah claimed there was an agenda against him as he was grilled on his past links to disgraced coach Alberto Salazar.
