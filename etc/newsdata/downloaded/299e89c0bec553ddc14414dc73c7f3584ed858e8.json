Thornton/Getty Images\n\nOrganizers repeatedly denied all accusations of misconduct or using inappropriate speech, but the issue resurfaced in January when two of the march's organizers appeared on \"The View.\"\n\nDuring the show, march co-president Tamika Mallory was asked why she posted a photo of herself and Louis Farrakhan, a minister and leader of the Nation of Islam, who has been accused of making anti-Semitic statements in the past. Mallory posted the photo on Instagram with a caption that included the hashtag for the title \"Greatest Of All Time.\"\n\n\"I didn\u2019t call him the greatest of all time because of his rhetoric,\" Mallory responded. \"I called him the greatest of all time because of what he\u2019s done in black communities.\"\n\nPressed on the issue, Mallory said, \"I don't agree with many of Minister Farrakhan's statements,\" but when asked directly if she condemned them, she demurred.\n\n\"I don't agree with these statements,\" Mallory responded. \"It\u2019s not my language, it\u2019s not the way that I speak, it\u2019s not how I organize ... I should never be judged through the lens of a man.\"\n\nRobin Marchant/Getty Images\n\nMallory\u2019s co-president, Bob Bland, responded to allegations that the organization expressed anti-Semitic beliefs behind closed doors, saying the claims \"are not true. That is not how that meeting happened.\"\n\n\"The people that the journalist spoke to did not tell the truth, period, full stop,\" Bland said. \"The Women\u2019s March unequivocally condemns anti-Semitism, bigotry, transphobia ... We condemn any statements of hate.\"\n\nThe 16 new board members were listed in the Women's March statement as Samia Assed, Zahra Billoo, Charlene Carruthers, Mrinalini Chakraborty, Rabbi Tamara Cohen, Rev. T. Sheri Dickerson, Sarah Eagle Heart, Lucy Flores, Ginny Goldman, Ginna Green, Shawna Knipper, Isa Noyola, Kelley Robinson, Rinku Sen, Leslie Templeton and Lu-Shawn Thompson.", "description": "The organization announced that Tamika Mallory, Bob Bland and Linda Sarsour are leaving the group and 16 others are joining the board.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/women-march-1-gty-er-190916_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
