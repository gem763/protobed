REUTERS/Piroschka van de Wouw\n\nThe meetings, which took place on Aug. 15 and Sept. 27, have been widely reported as being part of an investigation by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration into the origins of an inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 American election.\n\nHowever, Conte told reporters the meetings, attended by Italy\u2019s spy chief Gennaro Vecchione and other senior officials, had established that Italy had no information on the matter and was not involved in the investigation.\n\n\u201cThe meetings were fully legal, correct and didn\u2019t remotely harm our national interests,\u201d Conte said at a news conference after giving closed-doors testimony on the issue to the Italian parliament\u2019s committee for national security.\n\nConte said U.S. authorities had requested the meetings in June, adding that he had never personally spoken to Barr and that Trump had never spoken to him about the investigation.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies and Special Counsel Robert Mueller concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 election using hacking and propaganda to boost Republican Trump\u2019s candidacy and disparage his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. Mueller detailed a series of contacts between Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia.\n\nTrump, who is running for re-election next year, has called the Russia investigation a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and has repeatedly sought to discredit it.\n\nBarr, a Trump appointee who is the top U.S. law enforcement official, is personally involved in investigating Trump\u2019s complaints that he and his 2016 campaign were improperly targeted by U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies.\n\nBarr wanted information on the conduct of U.S. intelligence officers based in Italy in 2016, Conte said.\n\nHe added that the meetings also discussed Joseph Mifsud, a Maltese university professor who was a key figure in the events that triggered the Russia probe and was teaching in Rome when the scandal erupted but has since disappeared.\n\nThe meetings \u201cclarified that our intelligence was not involved in the affair\u201d, said Conte.\n\nItalian right-wing opposition parties have said Conte should not have authorized the secret encounters and have suggested they were connected to Trump\u2019s endorsement of him as prime minister during an Italian government crisis in August.\n\nConte dismissed both charges.\n\n\u201cIf we had refused to sit around a table we would have damaged our intelligence operations and it would have been serious disloyalty and discourtesy to our historic allies,\u201d he said.", "description": "Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on Wednesday confirmed that U.S. Attorney General William Barr held two secret meetings with Italian intelligence officers in Rome and described the encounters as \"legal and correct\".", "authors": ["Giuseppe Fonte", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444211549&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M1QS", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
