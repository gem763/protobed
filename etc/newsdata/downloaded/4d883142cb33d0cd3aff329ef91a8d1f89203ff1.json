This was the notion that if one nation fell to communism then those around them would be toppled by the left in turn.\n\nThe beginning of the 21st century has seen its very own Domino Theory play out in the drinks industry, its very own series of revolutions \u2013 the craft revolutions.\n\nBeer was the first to go, this had been bubbling away for decades in the states, Lagunitas Brewing Company founding its cell in 1993, the movement exploded through Europe in the last decade.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAfter beer was conquered, beanie-wearers and those with ironic moustaches turned their hipster glasses to the next night out \u2013 gin. The gin industry was blitzkrieged and rum is about to sign a treaty that leaves it relatively unaltered as long as long as it joins the Speakeasy Cocktail Corps.\n\nBut one ancient tipple has always remained at arm\u2019s length, untouchable and neutral \u2013 whisky.\n\nHow could you make a craft whisky? If any whisky was altered as beer and gin were when their constitutions were rewritten (some drastic method and recipe departures) then it would no longer be a whisky, merely a liqueur. The parameters for whisky are too narrow (it must be aged in oak, it must be aged this many years and must contain this much of that) and frankly, if it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it.\n\nAnd because of these restrictions a craft whisky revolution seems impossible, so it is apt that the place the revolution appears to be underway is the last place you\u2019d look, a place seemingly impossible to distill whisky: Tel-Aviv.\n\nThe Tel-Aviv climate is hostile. It has around 300 days of sunlight, temperatures of 40C and humidity levels reaching 90 per cent which all fuse together into an oppressive miasma that leaves the air in the streets a thick, tobacco and salt laden soup.\n\nIf you navigate this soup, in the shadow of Maccabi Tel-Aviv\u2019s stadium, 10 minutes\u2019 walk from the ancient port city of Jaffa, is the M&H Whiskey Distillery.\n\nNamed after the biblical Jewish promised land of milk and honey (and later abbreviated to avoid consumers thinking there\u2019s milk in the whisky), this renegade distillery is making arguably one of the most interesting spirits in the world.\n\nAnd that's due to the company\u2019s dedication to, and embodiment of, the spirit of Tel-Aviv: the maelstrom meshing of old and new, the traditional and the progressive and the unique terroir.\n\nThe company was founded by tech entrepreneur \u2013 and longstanding Tullamore Irish whiskey drinker \u2013 Gal Kalkstein in 2012 and distillation began in 2015. Hoping to emulate the Tullamore experience, Kalkstein explains he \u201cwanted to make a whisky that you put in the middle of the table and drink with your friends, talking away until you don\u2019t realise the bottle is finished\u201d.\n\nCrucial to the foundation of the distillery was the consultancy of the late Dr Jim Swan, a much loved, revered and missed figure in the whisky world.\n\nDr Swan was known for his role in enabling start up distilleries, a quick tour will highlight his presence in every nut and bolt of M&H; head distiller Tomer Goren pointing out pipes and stills and processes that Swan designed to marry the Tel-Aviv climate.\n\nOne of Dr Swan\u2019s innovations stands out above the rest: the use of STR casks. Standing for shaved, toasted, re-charred, this operation involves shaving red wine soaked oak from the surface of the barrel, toasting the cask with oak chips and then recharring the wood. The process serves to remove harsh tannins and foreground oakier characteristics such as vanilla, without fully losing the red wine character of the cask.\n\nWhile the team follow the Scotch model for the distillation process, here they have their own unique tweaks to their equipment to suit the circumstances and location grants them maturation believed to be two and a half times the speed of that in Scotland.\n\nThe maturation is accelerated by the blistering heat and humidity, producing remarkable results - the triple cask young single malt (aged in ex-bourbon, Islay and STR casks) has a simply unbelievable smoothness, boasting a depth and character well beyond its years. But it\u2019s not years old, it\u2019s only been aged for six months.\n\n\u201cWe have barrels everywhere,\u201d says Tomer. Some are in the mountains to the north, some are maturing 382m below sea level atop Herods Hotel beside the Dead Sea, aging in the lowest place on earth, subject to a salty humidity unparalleled in the whisky world.\n\nThough it\u2019s not all roses for Milk & Honey, as this particular maturation has the drawback of an 8-10 per cent angel share, with Goren conceding the barrels \u201ccan\u2019t mature there for three years, which we noticed after seven months\u201d.\n\nIt is not just how the distillery uses its unusual geography that sets it apart, it is the youthful exuberance and curiosity.\n\nWith whiskies ageing in pomegranate wine casks, among other top secret experiments, the distillers are constantly trying to innovate, whether that be the distillation process, the cask choice or where they leave the barrels \u2013 the desert being the next stop.\n\nBut is this all just a case of the distillery finding its feet, taking an almost Pollock approach of throwing a lot at the wall and seeing what sticks? Tomer says: \u201cOther brands already has its own profile, we will too but we will always try any new idea, we\u2019ll try anything\u201d.\n\nThis is evidenced in the plan for various special releases in the coming years. M&H\u2019s open minded approach is grounded in targeting the craft market, a potentially double edged sword given Israel\u2019s divisive place on the world stage.\n\nBut Gal is unconcerned by the politically aware tendencies of the craft market. \u201cWe hear a lot about people that don\u2019t want to buy Israeli things but there are more people that want to buy interesting things,\u201d he says.\n\nThe distilleries\u2019 first commercial release whisky will arrive at the end of the year. At the minute the M&H portfolio includes two ardently Israeli gins (packed with botanicals from the spellbinding Levinsky market and famed Jaffa oranges) as well as a new make single malt and the aforementioned triple cask young single malt. It also produces the roots herbal liqueur, a sweeter expression bursting with almonds and accessible to a wider audience.\n\nM&H uses English barley, French yeast, fermentation times ranging from 60-72 hours and barrels from revered distilleries such as Ardbeg to achieve this spectacular coming together of the old and the new.\n\nWith its young single malt finishing second behind Glenlivet in a blind tasting at Whisky Live Tel-Aviv, the distillery has already earned prodigy status, especially after beating off such esteemed company with a six month old malt.\n\nRecent experiments in whisky haven\u2019t done much bar emphasise existing characteristics or finish in a supposedly unusual cask, absurdly peated whiskies and beer barrel finishes are still highly drinkable forays away from established core ranges but it is simply a case of plus \u00e7a change and not daring to distill outside the box.\n\nBy looking toward their city, one that entrances you with its dichotomy of progressivism and tradition, (this religious hotbed recently had a 250,000 strong Gay Pride march) M&H has taken an age old spirit and is revolutionising the way we approach its production.\n\nBeing Israel\u2019s first ever whisky distillery, M&H is full of the vitality of youth, it has a refreshing eagerness to be bold and brave, to fail and learn, to push boundaries and to constantly improve, the distillery has chutzpah.", "description": "The Cold War was underpinned by one salient belief held by the Americans: The Domino Theory.
