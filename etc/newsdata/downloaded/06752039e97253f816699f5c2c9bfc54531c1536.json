Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Tuesday claimed that she does not have a \u201cbeef\u201d with billionaires, despite repeatedly targeting the wealthy over the course of her political campaign.\n\n\u201cLook I don\u2019t have a beef with billionaires,\u201d Warren said during the debate, alluding to her previously held position that successful billionaires did not build their wealth on their own.\n\n\u201cMy problem is, you made a fortune in America, you had a great idea, you got out there and worked for it, good for you. But you built that fortune in America \u2013 I guarantee \u2013 you built it in part using workers all of us helped pay to educate,\u201d Warren said.\n\n\u201cYou built it in part getting your goods to market on roads and bridges all of us helped pay for. You built it at least in part by protected by police and firefighters all of us help pay the salaries for,\u201d she continued.\n\n\u201cAll I\u2019m saying is, you make it to the top of one-tenth of one percent, then pitch in the two cents so every other kid in America has the chance,\u201d she added.\n\nWarren\u2019s claim \u2013 that she does not have a \u201cbeef\u201d with billionaires \u2013 is contradicted by the statements she has made over the course of her presidential campaign, targeting the wealthy specifically.\n\n\u201cAre you telling me that billionaires aren\u2019t in favor of my being president of the United States? I\u2019m shocked!\u201d Warren boasted over the summer:\n\nAre you telling me that billionaires aren\u2019t in favor of my being president of the United States?

Warren also touted an \u201cultra-millionaire tax\u201d earlier this year:\n\nWe're the richest nation in the history of the world. But the wealthy and the well-connected rig the system to benefit themselves. An #UltraMillionaireTax on the wealthiest 0.1% of Americans would level the playing field for everyone. https://t.co/KRTl33e90K \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) March 29, 2019\n\nThe rich & powerful run Washington. Here\u2019s one benefit they wrote for themselves: After making a killing from the economy they\u2019ve rigged, they don't pay taxes on that accumulated wealth. It\u2019s a system that\u2019s rigged for the top if I ever saw one. \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) January 24, 2019\n\nWhat's \u201cridiculous\u201d is billionaires who think they can buy the presidency to keep the system rigged for themselves while opportunity slips away for everyone else. The top 0.1%, who'd pay my #UltraMillionaireTax, own about the same wealth as 90% of America. It's time for change. https://t.co/D04G5fNvpa \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) January 29, 2019\n\nThe Warren wealth tax hand rub!!!!!!!!!!!! pic.twitter.com/2YF54JwPEv \u2014 Josh Marshall (@joshtpm) July 31, 2019\n\nI believe Washington should work for you\u2014not billionaires or Wall Street. I'm Elizabeth Warren, and I approve this message. pic.twitter.com/MSnFyiEJxu \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 2, 2019\n\nI don't spend \u201ccall time\" on the phone with millionaires asking for big checks. I spend my \u201ccall time\u201d talking with voters and thanking grassroots donors. Donate to my campaign right now, let me know when you\u2019ve chipped in, and I might call you tonight! https://t.co/Bam8yokJbq pic.twitter.com/6KT8XK6mxW \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) September 26, 2019\n\nThis is far from the first time Warren has insisted that the rich did not build their wealth on their own.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not proposing a wealth tax because I\u2019m cranky. Some of these guys say, \u2018I worked hard. I had a great idea. I worked late\u2019\u2013 oh yeah, unlike anybody else,\u201d the presidential hopeful sarcastically stated during a campaign stop in Hampton Falls, New Hampshire, on Labor Day. \u201cBut \u2018I worked late or inherited wealth, and so this is mine.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the answer is yeah, you did. Good for you. You did have a great idea and you did work hard. No one is angry about that, but here\u2019s the deal. You built a great fortune here in America. I guarantee you built it at least in part using workers all of us help pay to educate,\u201d she continued.\n\n\u201cYeah. You built it at least in part, getting your goods to market on roads and bridges all of us helped pay to build. Yep. You built it at least in part, protected by police and firefighters all of us help pay their salaries,\u201d she added.\n\nWarren\u2019s relationship with the ultra-wealthy has been convoluted over the years. Although she has targeted millionaires and billionaires over the course of her presidential campaign, she has received money from at least 30 billionaires over the course of her political career.", "description": "Sen.
