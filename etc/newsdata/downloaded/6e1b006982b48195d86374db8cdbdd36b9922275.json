And he said finally, \u2018OK, I\u2019ll do it,\u2019\u201d Portman explained to reporters last week. \u201cI think he was using that as leverage to get the Germans and other Europeans to do more.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump complimented Portman as \u201chonorable\u201d for backing up his explanation. The president recounted speaking with Portman about their rift earlier this year.\n\n\u201cHe called up: \u2018Please let the money go.\u2019 I said \u2018Rob, I hate being the country that's always giving money,\u2019\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe said, \u2018You know what? But it's important \u2026 I gave the money because Rob Portman and others called me and asked. But I don't like to be the sucker and European countries are helped far more than we are.\u201d\n\nTrump's remarks came from questioning about what exactly he wanted Zelensky to do in the phone call, a query that was not answered.\n\nPortman said he did not disagree with Trump\u2019s main point of world leaders sharing equitable payments to Ukraine but that it was \u201cnot fair to Zelensky\u201d to withhold aid because he had just taken office.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201910/2391/1155968404_6091303583001_6091303072001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nYet Portman hasn\u2019t entirely defended Trump\u2019s defense of his phone call with Zelensky, even though the Republican senator strongly disagrees with House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. Trump has said his call with Zelensky was \u201cperfect\u201d but Portman said it would have been preferable to have left Biden out of it.\n\n\u201cWould it have been better that he not brought up Biden\u2019s name? Yes,\u201d Portman said last week. \u201cBut the rush to judgment by the other body I think is totally unwarranted.\u201d\n\nPortman is among a large group of bipartisan senators who have urged administrations in both parties to counteract Russian influence by helping Ukraine. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) also said recently he\u2019d leaned on the Defense secretary and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to deliver the aid and \u201cwas not given an explanation\u201d for why it didn\u2019t move.\n\nTrump allies say his annoyance with providing aid to allies is consistent when he feels the United States is overpaying. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said that in a discussion with Trump last week, the president \u201cwanted to stop payment to South Korea unless they paid more.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s always tried to get people to pay more,\u201d Graham told reporters last week. The Trump administration \u201cwanted to find out if the new [Ukraine] administration is reliable \u2026 if you\u2019re suggesting that Trump withheld the aid to get the Ukrainian government to do something? I don\u2019t buy it.\u201d\n\nEuropean countries have provided Ukraine with billions in financial assistance, though the U.S. has led the way on military aid, according to PolitiFact.\n\nOma Seddiq contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/f8/ca/8c4834594cacb64fbda549477196/191002-trump-portman-split-getty.jpg"}
