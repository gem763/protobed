Now he\u2019s exiled as a \u2018snitch.\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nRapper Daniel Hernandez, known as Tekashi 6ix9ine, in Milan, Italy. (Luca Bruno/AP)\n\nIn November, Brooklyn-based rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine \u2014 known for his rainbow-colored hair and prominent face tattoos \u2014 claimed the two things he feared were \u201cGod and the FBI.\u201d\n\nTen months later, the 23-year-old, whose legal name is Daniel Hernandez, has a third to add to the list: his former gang, the Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods.\n\nHernandez was indicted over a year ago on racketeering and firearm charges along with five other men, all of whom were named as members of the violent gang alleged to be operating a drug-trafficking enterprise. Hernandez cut a deal with the government and took the stand last week as federal prosecutors\u2019 star witness against two former associates, Aljermiah Mack and Anthony Ellison, described by the U.S. attorney\u2019s office as high-ranking gang members.\n\nHernandez offered a rare look inside the inner workings of a notoriously dangerous and murderous street gang, which he allegedly joined to advance his budding music career, according to the New York Times. As his stardom brought in cash, Hernandez explained from the witness stand, the Nine Treys offered up street cred.\n\nBut any amity Hernandez built up with the gang all but collapsed after three days detailing robberies, assaults and drug crimes for a federal jury.\n\n[6ix9ine arrested on racketeering and firearms charges; prosecutors say the troubled rapper was part of a violent gang]\n\nThe New York Times reported that the Instagram celebrity and self-described troll listed what he said was the Nine Treys hierarchy and claimed several prominent entertainment industry names were gang members, including Harlem rapper Jim Jones and Bronx-based Cardi B, in his testimony.\n\nThe testimony shocked music artists and members of his former crew, provoking many to denounce his cooperation with law enforcement.\n\nIn a series of Instagram posts, rapper Snoop Dogg called Henderson a \u201cs.n.i.t.c.h.\u201d and \u201ca rat and a goon.\u201d\n\nVince Staples asked his 1.1 million followers: \u201cDid 69 tell on you?\n\nAnd in a now-deleted tweet, Cardi B corrected Hernandez, who had apparently aligned her with the Nine Treys, which she wrote was the wrong gang set.\n\nHenderson also recounted a day in July when Ellison allegedly kidnapped the rapper after an internal falling out over who would control his career.\n\n\u201cI knew I was going to become a target,\u201d Hernandez said in court. \u201cI knew they were going to try and hurt me.\u201d\n\nHernandez renounced his Nine Treys affiliation in November. Soon afterward, the FBI approached him with a warning: Agents had learned about a planned retaliation from a wiretap. Authorities offered Hernandez round-the-clock surveillance, which he refused.\n\nDays later, a dozen Nine Trey members, including Hernandez, were arrested in the racketeering roundup. Hernandez subsequently agreed to accept help from and cooperate with law enforcement.\n\n[Rapper 6ix9ine has lots of hits but just as much controversy. Expect more of both.]\n\nHernandez\u2019s future \u2014 as a rapper and otherwise \u2014 looks bleak, uncertain and unsafe.\n\nFor the time being, Hernandez remains incarcerated; he pleaded guilty to a slew of charges in January, including racketeering, and faces a minimum of 47 years in prison, though prosecutors promised to request a reduced sentence for his testimony against Mack and Ellison. Prosecutors have indicated he could enter the witness protection program after his release.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe complete list of 2019 Emmy Award winners\n\n\u2018Friends\u2019 premiered 25 years ago.
