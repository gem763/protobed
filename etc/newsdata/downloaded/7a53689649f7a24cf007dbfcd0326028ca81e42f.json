It was a hell of a bad cut and in fact, that fight should have been stopped.\n\n\u201cThat was one of the worst cuts I\u2019ve ever seen. You can compare it to the Lennox Lewis v Vitali Klitschko fight which was stopped by the doctor because the cut was so bad. But this one went on.\n\n\u201cOtto Wallin, hats off to him, he definitely did his thing in there but, right now, my mindset is not on Fury.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just that I know exactly what to do in that fight, the second time around, in February. When I\u2019ve been in there with someone one time, the second time \u2013 ahh man. The second time you definitely got no chance. I know everything that Fury wants to do after being in there with him before.\u201d\n\nSince having the stitches taken out of his damaged eyebrow, Fury has enjoyed cameo appearances in the WWE, which his promoter Frank Warren has described as \u2018risky\u2019 given the nature of his healing cut.\n\nFury suffered a horrific cut against Wallin (REUTERS)\n\nIt has even been suggested that Fury could feature in a more prominent role for them before the year is out, which will further help to build his profile in America.\n\nBut Wilder has taken umbrage with Fury\u2019s description as a world heavyweight champion given his current lack of title belts.\n\n\u201cI saw him in the WWE,\u201d Wilder added. \u201cI thought it was hilarious and I liked how the other wrestler told him he was going to be left on his back looking up at the lights just like Deontay Wilder did him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting times in the heavyweight division and you can tell the WWE understand, they understand what\u2019s going on. But it was laughable that Tyson Fury described himself as the heavyweight champion of the world, they need to cut that bullshit out. Tyson, you are not the heavyweight champion of the world, you are just in the top 10.\n\n\u201cHe talks about this lineal stuff but that don\u2019t mean nothing. I ain\u2019t ever seen a 12-round fight with no title, no belt. You say you\u2019re the champ but it\u2019s an invisible belt, we can\u2019t see nothing.\n\n\u201cBut the heavyweight division is so amazing right now, so exciting and I\u2019m so happy to put my little percentage in and make it so great. I remember the time when it was in a dark tunnel, there was nothing exciting going on, it was kinda boring. Now it\u2019s just amazing and I\u2019m happy to be part of that.\u201d", "description": "Deontay Wilder plans to use Tyson Fury it\u2019s damaged right eyebrow \u2018like a target\u2019 when the pair meet for their anticipated rematch next year and has promised another bloody night for the Gypsy King.
