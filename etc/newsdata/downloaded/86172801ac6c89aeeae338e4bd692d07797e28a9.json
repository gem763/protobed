REUTERS/Danny Moloshok\n\nFrench actress Juliette Binoche had been urging Kore-eda, who won the Palme d\u2019Or for \u201cShoplifters\u201d at last year\u2019s Cannes film festival, to make a film with her for several years but nothing had got off the ground.\n\nInspiration finally struck for Kore-eda on a flight back from Paris: the film, based on a theater script he began in 2003, would be set in France with Deneuve and Binoche as mother and daughter.\n\n\u201cI thought we couldn\u2019t make the film unless it was Catherine Deneuve,\u201d Kore-eda told Reuters, saying only she could have played the role of Fabienne, a grande dame of French cinema still active in movies.\n\n\u201cIf it was her then we could make it a reality.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Truth,\u201d which hits Japanese cinemas on Oct. 11 after it premiered at the Venice film festival, features Fabienne, who has just published her memoirs and is hosting her screenwriter daughter Lumir (Binoche) and TV actor son-in-law Hank (Ethan Hawke) on a visit from New York.\n\nBut painful memories and tensions between mother and daughter resurface when Fabienne\u2019s book reveals more lies than the truth mentioned in its title, \u201cLa Verite\u201d.\n\nKore-eda had feared Deneuve would turn down the role but sensed her enthusiasm at a meeting where he showed her bits of the still incomplete screenplay.\n\n\u201cShe was saying things like, \u2018It\u2019s really interesting but maybe you should fix this part,\u2019 or, \u2018Filming\u2019s going to be in Paris, right? You know I can\u2019t leave Paris,\u2019 so that\u2019s when I knew she was up for it.\u201d\n\n\u2018HUGE ADMIRATION\u2019\n\nKore-eda\u2019s admiration for the \u201cBelle de Jour\u201d actress did not go unnoticed.\n\n\u201cI think the click came when he met with Catherine, I think he had a huge admiration for her, he was like a little boy seeing her coming on the set,\u201d Binoche said.\n\nBinoche said she was thrilled to finally work with Kore-eda.\n\n\u201cFor me, Kore-eda is like Anton Chekhov of nowadays and he has this quality of being subtle, of getting into real themes in families that hurt so bad,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAnd yet you\u2019ve got to find a way to love all those complexities and tragedies and all. And so he\u2019s able to really develop those relationships and situations.\u201d\n\nStill to be resolved after the casting, however, was the matter of filming in another country and in a foreign language for the first time.\n\nKore-eda wrote the screenplay in Japanese and then worked on the French translation with Lea Le Dimna, his Japanese-French interpreter for the past five years. He had complete faith she would nail the nuances.\n\n\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t met her I don\u2019t think I would have had the confidence to do this project,\u201d Kore-eda added. \u201cI think this project probably succeeded because of the kind of presence she brought.\u201d\n\nDespite its setting, \u201cThe Truth\u201d largely unspools within Fabienne\u2019s home and avoids stereotypical Paris locations such as the Eiffel Tower and Champs-Elysees - which Kore-eda called a trap foreign filmmakers often fell into.\n\n\u201cI wanted to shoot Paris from the perspective of ordinary people there and I made a point of avoiding all that.\u201d\n\nKore-eda said he had other projects in development but after five films in five years, it was time to ease the pace and hold off on any decisions for six months.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a good run with a film every year, but it\u2019ll be tough to keep going at that rate.\u201d", "description": "Japanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda found the pieces magically falling into place for his film, \"The Truth\", even though he had to revive a long-dormant script, get renowned actress Catherine Deneuve on board and overcome a language barrier to pull it off.", "authors": ["Chris Gallagher", "Mike Davidson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436177348&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF910JO-OCAEN"}
