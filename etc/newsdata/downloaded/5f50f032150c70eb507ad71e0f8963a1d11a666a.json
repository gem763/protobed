Sounds depressingly relatable, doesn\u2019t it?\n\nThank goodness, then, for the Addams family, who live in a spooky mansion on the edge of town. Gross, morbid, and deeply disturbed, the Addams are the (literal) neighbours from hell \u2013 or are they exactly what this bland, artificial town needs?\n\nIn all-new animated form, Charles Addams\u2019 infamous comic-strip family return once again to the big screen, and what an impression they make. The whole gang is here: parents Gomez (Oscar Isaac) and Morticia (Charlize Theron), children Wednesday (Chloe Moretz) and Pugsley (Finn Wolfhard), butler Lurch (Conrad Vernon), and whatever \u201cThing\u201d is.\n\nVideo of THE ADDAMS FAMILY Official Trailer MGM\n\nAfter being chased out of their hometown by angry pitchfork-wielding villagers (and on their wedding day, too) Gomez and Morticia begin a new life in a place where shady characters can go undetected: New Jersey.\n\nThirteen years and two kids later, and the Addamses still haven\u2019t ventured beyond the safety of their manor house \u2013 that is, until they are discovered by the residents of Assimilation.\n\nMaleficent: Mistress of Evil review: Disney villain sequel loses heart and complexity to CGI battle scene\n\nThe town is being featured on a property makeover show presented by the brash, mommy blogger-esque Margaux, and she isn\u2019t about to let the undesirable Addams family ruin the live finale. Of course, it just so happens that the Addamses are planning a big family reunion \u2013 with all kinds of odd-looking relatives arriving from out of town \u2013 on the very same day.\n\nNeedless to say, we\u2019re rooting for our \u201cbad guys\u201d all the way. They may be unsightly, but the Addamses are cool. The means girls at school are no match for the evil genius of Wednesday Addams, and not even Margaux herself can resist the peculiar charms of Uncle Fester. With a catchy soundtrack and jokes that are actually pretty funny, this film could become an annual Halloween staple.
