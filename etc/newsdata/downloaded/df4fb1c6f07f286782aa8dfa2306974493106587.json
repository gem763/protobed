REUTERS/Philimon Bulawayo\n\nMnangagwa\u2019s opponents stayed away from the demonstrations, saying they were a distraction from the president\u2019s mishandling of the economy, which is grappling with 18-hour daily power cuts and shortages of foreign exchange, fuel and medicines.\n\nMnangagwa has so far failed to unify the country since taking over from the late Robert Mugabe, who was ousted in a coup in 2017. Hopes of a swift recovery have faded as the economy struggles to exit its deepest crisis in a decade.\n\nMnangagwa, like Mugabe, blames the sanctions imposed by the United States and European Union since 2001 for the economic ills and sees them as a tool to remove the ruling ZANU-PF party from power.\n\n\u201cEvery part and sector of our economy has been affected by these sanctions like a cancer,\u201d Mnangagwa told a few thousand supporters inside a 60,000-seater national stadium. \u201cEnough is enough, remove them. Remove these sanctions now!\u201d\n\nEarlier, 7,000 government supporters led by Mnangagwa\u2019s wife Auxillia and bussed from across Zimbabwe marched for 5 km to the national stadium in the capital Harare.\n\nSinging and dancing, they waved placards inscribed \u201cNo sanctions, no discrimination, sanctions new version of slavery,\u201d and \u201cEnough is enough, remove sanctions now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have no jobs because of the sanctions. America wants to remove ZANU-PF from power through sanctions but we will defend the party and our president,\u201d said 32-year-old Martin Mafusire.\n\nSimilar marches were held throughout Zimbabwe after Mnangagwa declared Friday a public holiday.\n\nThe EU and United States imposed financial and travel bans on ZANU-PF and top military figures for alleged human rights abuses and electoral fraud. The government says the measures are punishment for its seizures of white-owned farms.\n\nZANU-PF supporters condemn the sanctions while the main opposition Movement for Democratic Change says they are not the cause of the country\u2019s economic crisis.\n\nThe regional Southern African Development Community has rallied behind Zimbabwe\u2019s call for an end to sanctions.\n\nWhile the government ran documentaries and articles in the official press criticising sanctions, the U.S. and EU embassies took to social media to rebut the official narrative.\n\nU.S. Ambassador Brian Nichols wrote an article in a private newspaper on Thursday saying \u201cthe greatest sanctions on Zimbabwe are the limitations that the country places on itself\u201d.\n\nHe said the United States remained the biggest donor to Zimbabwe but corruption and lack of reform had dragged down the economy.\n\nThe EU now only keeps sanctions on Mugabe and his wife Grace and Zimbabwe Defence Industries.\n\nHarare says the U.S. sanctions have been the most devastating. These bar U.S. officials at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank from voting for debt relief or fresh lending for Zimbabwe.\n\nIn March, President Donald Trump extended by one year sanctions against 141 entities and individuals in Zimbabwe, including Mnangagwa.
