REUTERS/Alkis Konstantinidis\n\nShe wants to end a political system where, she says, what job you get depends on who you know and what religion or sect you belong to.\n\nDemonstrations dominated by young faces have paralyzed the country in recent days, forcing Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri\u2019s government to rush out measures aimed at quelling anger and rescuing an economy in free fall.\n\nThe reforms, which include slashing the salaries of top officials and imposing taxes on banks, have not appeased demonstrators, many of whom are young. The official unemployment rate for those aged under 35 in 37%.\n\nProtesters like Sabbah, a Shi\u2019ite Muslim from the south, say they have shed religious affiliations to join a broad protest movement that has cut across sectarian lines, challenging a system they say fuels inequality, nepotism, and corruption.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a country where which sect or which political leaders you belong to secures you a job,\u201d said the 25-year-old, adding that she\u2019s joined Muslim Sunnis, Christians, and Druze in expressing her rage at the country\u2019s elite.\n\n\u201cEveryone has reached a point where we cannot take it any more. We are unified in our outrage.\u201d\n\nLebanon\u2019s power-sharing system based on 18 recognized religious sects dates back to French colonial rule, allocating posts for each of the country\u2019s communities and forming the basis of its major political parties.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve come to bring down the sectarian-based regime and replace it with a political system where people get positions based on competence, not sect,\u201d said Younis Kalaji, 21, a university physics student.\n\nProtesters say the system affects everyday life, determining everything from university appointments to quotas for each religious sect in the country\u2019s military and state institutions.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want anyone to use our sect to determine whether we pass our exams or get a job,\u201d said Zainab Sharafeddine, an 18-year-old student at Lebanese University.\n\n\u201cONE HUNDRED DICTATORS\u201d\n\nLebanon\u2019s economy was once likened to the Switzerland of the Middle East, with a sophisticated banking sector and thriving tourism industry.\n\nBut spiraling debt and donors\u2019 increasing reluctance to bail out the economy have triggered an economic crisis. Its once affluent middle class has been decimated and many young people see moving abroad as the only way to get ahead.\n\nLike most Arab countries, the demographics of Lebanon\u2019s roughly 4 million skew heavily toward the young: about 40% of its highly educated population is under the age of 25.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no work here in Lebanon. It\u2019s just exhaustion,\u201d said Nour Habib, a 20-year-old engineering student. \u201cIf any opportunity comes to leave Lebanon, I will take it.\u201d\n\nProtests that have gripped Lebanon for the past week, with their chants for revolution and the downfall of the regime, echo the 2011 Arab revolts that unseated four Arab leaders and the past year\u2019s uprisings in Algeria and Sudan.\n\n\u201cThe Arab revolts all had one dictator, but in Lebanon we have one hundred,\u201d said Farah Baba, a university youth activist whose group has camped near Riyad Solh square in central Beirut where protesters have converged.\n\nProtests across the country have seen people break taboos by burning pictures of leaders of their own sects and, unusually, chanting against Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, the most powerful figure in Lebanon.\n\n\u201cThey have broken the barrier of fear by attacking symbols of their politicians and leaders of their sects,\u201d said Baba.\n\nSome people say their fight is to erase the legacy of a 15-year civil war that began in 1975 and pitted Muslims, Druze, and Christians against one another.\n\nThe peace agreement that ended the war shifted the balance of power among the sects, with Christians losing some prerogatives, but left the confessional system in place.\n\nAs tens of thousands of demonstrators hoisting the Lebanese flag fanned out across Lebanon, activists have urged protesters to leave sectarian symbols and party flags at home.\n\nA truck rallying protesters in central Beirut, engulfed in a sea of red and white national flags, had on its sides a simple message: \u201cNo to sectarianism. It\u2019s time for change.\u201d\n\nZainab Shreif, 16, a high school student, said young people were breaking free from their sectarian identities.\n\n\u201cThey have discovered that the party they were chanting for, whose leaders\u2019 posters they carried, do not care about them.\u201d", "description": "Like most young protesters flooding Lebanon's streets to vent their fury over joblessness and inequality, Nina Sabbah demands more than the government's hastily announced reforms if she is to back down.", "authors": ["Suleiman Al-Khalidi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444097784&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M128", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
