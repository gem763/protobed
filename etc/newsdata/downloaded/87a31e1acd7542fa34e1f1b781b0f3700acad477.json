Ryan Reynolds is utterly hilarious. But can either of them tear apart an apple with their bare hands? I don\u2019t think so.\n\nBut do you know who can? Paul fucking Rudd.\n\nThe IRL Benjamin Button of Hollywood recently starred in a promo video for his brand new Netflix series Living With Yourself, where he showed off his mighty strength alongside his costar Aisling Bea.\n\n\u201cPaul, do you remember our very first meeting? And the odd thing you did when I was leaving the room?\u201d Aisling asks at the beginning of the clip.\n\nAfter joking about how he didn\u2019t think their first encounter \u201cwent very well\u201d, she reminded Paul of how he showed off his impressive apple-splitting skills when he first met Aisling, who plays his wife on the show.\n\n\u201cThe other thing you did was half an apple straight in front of me, which would slowly become a metaphor for the show,\u201d she added.\n\nThe video is available on the official Netflix US Twitter account, but it does what it says on the box, really. Paul Rudd, my most loved man in Hollywood, literally rips an apple in half.\n\n\u201cThis motherf\u2014 is a tight one,\u201d he says, struggling slightly with the fruit before ripping that bad boy into two near-perfect halves.\n\nWatch Paul Rudd split an apple in half with his bare hands. pic.twitter.com/qjqexAvUQV \u2014 Netflix US (@netflix) October 25, 2019\n\n\u201cOh my God, do you see?\u201d Aisling Bea says before taking a bite of the crisp Granny Smith.\u201cCheers, I\u2019ve really enjoyed working with you!\u201d\n\nIn true Paul Rudd fashion, the Ant-Man actor felt the need to respond with possibly the cheesiest line of all time.\n\n\u201cThank you. You know what? You\u2019re the other half of my Granny Smith!\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t even the first time Paul Rudd has been meme-ified this week, with his hilariously relatable Hot Ones appearance also making the rounds online.\n\nLiving With Yourself is Paul Rudd\u2019s latest eight-episode Netflix dramedy, which follows the life of Miles (played by Rudd), who is replaced by a new and improved version of himself (also played by Rudd).\n\nHonestly, the only thing better than a TV show with Paul Rudd is a TV show with TWO Paul Rudds.", "description": "Actor Paul Rudd has stunned fans in a recent promo video for his latest series 'Living With Yourself' after ripping an apple in half with his bare hands.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/aisling-bea-and-paul-rudd-1024x683.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
