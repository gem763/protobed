Warner Bros. was clearly betting hard on Todd Phillips\u2019 dive into the DC Universe and everyone and the academy already knew Joaquin Phoenix is no slouch as a leading man. Still, it\u2019s pretty impressive to watch as Joker continues to sprint wild-eyed and loose-limbed toward a potential $900 billion box office (or greater!), on track to become the highest grossing R-rated film of all time.\n\nOver the weekend, the film\u2019s third, Joker earned $107 million, bringing the movie\u2019s worldwide box office to over $737 million and climbing, and, as Deadline points out, that\u2019s all without premiering in China. Now Joker need only surpass Deadpool\u2019s $783 million at the box office. (Deadpool 2 earned $785 million, but that included the earnings of Deadpool 2\u2019s PG-13 holiday re-release). Of course, since this is the story of Arthur Fleck, a story which teaches us that the world is\u2026unfair? Complicated?
