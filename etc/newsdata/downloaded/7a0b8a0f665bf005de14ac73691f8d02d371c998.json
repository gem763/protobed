The lenders are currently working on a resolution plan but the majority of its bondholders declined last month to be a party to that plan.\n\nThe proposed plan involves the conversion of debt into equity for lenders and also includes giving them a 51% stake in the company.\n\nOn Thursday, DHFL also filed delayed audited results for the quarter ended June 30 which showed it posted a net loss of 2.06 billion rupees in the quarter compared with a profit of 4.35 billion rupees in the same period a year earlier.\n\nThe company\u2019s new auditor, KK Mankeshwar & Co, also raised concerns about the company\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cAll these developments raise a significant doubt on the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern and therefore it may be unable to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities including potential liabilities in the normal course of business,\u201d the auditor said.\n\nThe auditors also said that they could not get sufficient evidence to support the value of certain loans and added that they were unable to comment if certain loans had been properly secured.\n\n\u201cThese loans may have been granted including terms and conditions, in a manner that is prejudicial to the interest of the company or its members,\u201d the auditors added.\n\nSimilar concerns had also been raised by Deloitte Haskin & Sells and Mumbai-based Chaturvedi & Shah, DHFL\u2019s two previous auditors at the time of the declaration of the March quarter results.", "description": "The resolution plans of debt-laden shadow lender Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL) have hit a roadblock after the custodian of DHFL bonds said on Thursday it is taking the firm to bankruptcy court on behalf of certain debenture holders.", "authors": ["Nupur Anand", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
