Officers reported that information to the principal who alerted the district. Twenty three learners claimed that they have been sexually assaulted by the teacher,\" Mabona said.\n\nMabona added that the school had to follow processes before it could suspend the teacher.\n\nSilent suspension\n\n\"For now it is a silent suspension.

Currently, he is not in school, as soon as we get hold of him he will be directed to the district offices.\n\n\"Parents don't want to see him anymore in the school and we understand that. There are cases opened against him with the police. Police will work with parents. This is an urgent case that needs to be attended to quickly.\"\n\nMabona said they will also investigate why the case was only reported on Tuesday and should it be found that the previous acting principal and some teachers were aware of the allegations, action will be taken.\n\n\"Our social workers are in the school to work with learners.

We are communicating with parents and there is no need for parents to shut down the school nor disrupt teaching and learning,\" he said.\n\nShocked\n\nParents who can't named to protect the identity of their children said they wanted the man far from the school and their children.\n\nOne parent, who has two children at the school, said on Tuesday afternoon she was shocked and demanded answers.\n\n\"I am very angry that the school kept such an ugly thing as a secret from us as parents. There is no communication between the school and us as parents. The knew about this thing and they tried to protect the culprit. We are not satisfied with the decision taken by the school. The school needs to improve its communication method,\" she said.\n\nAnother parent said her child can't be in the same school with the male teacher.\n\n\"What is going to happen with our children if he is back in school? What are the procedures to protect our children? We want to know what procedures will be implemented to protect our children,\" she asked.\n\nParents asked the department to probe if the teacher had faced similar allegations at schools he had previously worked at.\n\nCommittee appointed\n\nCrime Watch activist Yusuf Abramjee said the school and parents have appointed a committee that will communicate with parents regarding the incidents.\n\nKEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter.\n\n- FOLLOW News24 on Twitter", "description": "A teacher who allegedly sexually assaulted pupils at Valhalla Primary School in Pretoria is to be served with a letter of suspension from the school.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6813/1214bafbf0314eac8975012290db04f8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-02-06"}
