Thomas. \"It is our hope that our graduates will use their newfound financial freedom to pursue their career goals, to lead and serve the community, and to remember the spirit of the gift given to them by paying it forward to support the education of future classes of Morehouse men.\"\n\nGRADS WORRY THEY'LL NEVER PAY OFF STUDENT LOAN DEBT TOTALING $1.6T\n\nMore than 400 students and their parents and guardians will benefit under Smith's gift, the school said. It said Morehouse students on average graduate with $35,000 to $40,000 in student loan debt.\n\nNationally, student loan debt has grown to more than $1.5 trillion.\n\nUnder the terms of the gift, six types of loans will be repaid: federal subsidized loans; federal unsubsidized loans; Georgia Student Access Loans; Perkins Loans; Parent Plus Loans; and certain private student loans processed through Morehouse College.\n\n\u201cMorehouse\u2019s program to provide debt relief to new graduates is a fund-raising opportunity that should be studied and duplicated nationally,\u201d said Michael L. Lomax, president and CEO of the United Negro College Fund. \u201cThe impact of such a gift, particularly for minority or economically disadvantaged families, could accelerate the growth of a more diverse and robust middle class.\u201d\n\nWhile Smith elicited praise after announcing his pledge, a small minority criticized him for allegedly distracting from the cause of rising student debt.\n\nHe announced the gift during a speech at the Class of 2019 commencement in May, when he received an honorary doctorate.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"On behalf of the eight generations of my family that have been in this country, we're gonna put a little fuel in your bus. This is my class, 2019. And my family is making a grant to eliminate their student loans,\" Smith said to the nearly 400 graduates. \"I know my class will make sure they pay this forward\u2026and let\u2019s make sure every class has the same opportunity going forward because we are enough to take care of our own community.\u201d\n\nSmith is the founder, chairman and CEO of Vista Equity Partners, a private equity firm that invests in software, data and technology-driven companies.", "description": "Robert Smith, the private equity billionaire\u00a0and\u00a0philanthropist who shocked\u00a0Morehouse College\u00a0at their May graduation when he pledged to pay off their student loans, followed through on his promise.", "authors": ["Louis Casiano"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/43721108-Capture.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
