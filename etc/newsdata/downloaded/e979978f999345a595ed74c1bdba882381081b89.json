Analysts have attributed Trump\u2019s trade wars as a contributing factor.\n\nU.S. and Chinese officials, meanwhile, are set to resume trade negotiations in Washington next week. The talks come just ahead of a delayed increase of tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\nThe Trump administration had moved a scheduled increase of Chinese tariffs from Tuesday to Oct. 15, just days after the negotiations. The latest round would increase tariffs from 25 percent to 30 percent on an estimated $250 billion worth of Chinese imports.\n\nTrump has made his relationship with Beijing a centerpiece of his presidency, even as he becomes the focus of an impeachment inquiry led by House Democrats. The inquiry is centered on whistleblower's allegations that Trump sought to withhold hundreds of millions in dollars in aid to Ukraine to pressure the government there to open a probe into former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenGordon Sondland expected to appear for House deposition Ivanka Trump on impeachment: 'Everything's a question of priorities' Second intel official considering filing complaint over Trump: report MORE, the Democratic 2020 front-runner, and Biden's son Hunter.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump publicly encouraged China and Ukraine to investigate the Biden family for unsubstantiated corruption allegations.\n\nBut the president maintained that he would keep issues related to Biden \u201cseparate\u201d from his ongoing trade talks with Beijing.\n\n\u201cI want to do a trade deal with China but only if it\u2019s good for our country,\u201d Trump told reporters outside the White House on Friday. \u201cOne thing has nothing to do with the other.\u201d\n\n\u2014Tess Bonn", "description": "Former South Carolina Gov.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/sanfordmark07162015getty_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
