She\u2019s not expected to significantly alter her message. Instead, Harris is planning to make weekly visits to the state and nearly double the size of her 65-person ground operation, sources familiar with the discussions told POLITICO.\n\nThe re-engagement in Iowa \u2014 where the California senator held a 17-stop bus tour in August but hasn\u2019t returned since \u2014 is part of a broader acknowledgment inside the campaign that she hasn\u2019t been in the early states enough. It\u2019s designed to refocus her campaign and clarify her narrowing path to the nomination.", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com Story"], "top_image": ""}
