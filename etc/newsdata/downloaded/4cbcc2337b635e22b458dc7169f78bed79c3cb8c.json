Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) during a House Oversight and Reform subcommittee hearing after the freshman Democrat questioned why the GOP lawmakers wanted to adjourn.\n\nHer remark led Rep. Kelly Armstrong (R-ND) and Ranking Member Jim Jordan (R-OH) to remind the New York lawmaker that Democrats continue to schedule hearings at the same time as impeachment depositions in House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff\u2019s (D-CA) secret impeachment room in the Capitol Hill basement.\n\nHouse Oversight lawmakers held a hearing Tuesday titled, \u201cTrump\u2019s Wrong Turn on Clean Cars: The Effects of Fuel Efficiency Rollbacks on the Climate, Car Companies and California.\u201d However, it coincided with impeachment depositions in what has been dubbed Schiff\u2019s \u201csecret impeachment dungeon,\u201d leaving Republican lawmakers unsettled and ultimately hoping to adjourn the hearing.\n\nOcasio-Cortez was incensed and accused GOP lawmakers of disrespecting the process.\n\n\u201cAnd I just want to know what the reason for such disrespect of our process would potentially be. Do we have a reason for why this hearing is trying to be adjourned? Or, you know, do we have just like a cocktail party?\u201d Ocasio-Cortez asked.\n\nArmstrong snapped back:\n\nI have one. I have a real easy one. The oil industry is the second largest industry in my state. My constituents expect me to be here. We are running an impeachment hearing down in the basement of the Capitol right now.\n\n\u201cWait so is this about the oil industry or impeachment, \u201d Ocasio-Cortez asked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about the economy of the state of North Dakota \u2026 I want to participate in this hearing, but I also feel the need to be in the SCIF because we are only one of three committees that\u2019s allowed to be in the room,\u201d Armstrong replied. He went on:\n\nI feel the need to be in the SCIF because we\u2019re only one of three committees that\u2019s allowed to be in the room. I can do a lot of things. I can\u2019t be two places at once. I\u2019m completely comfortable having this hearing; I just prefer to have it at a time when I could participate in it in.\n\nOcasio-Cortez questioned Armstrong for airing his grievances during the hearing, prompting Jordan to jump into the conversation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve expressed this last week about have two things going on at the same time,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we haven\u2019t talked about this, but you guys continue to do hearings at the same time there are depositions going on.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs the gentleman from North Dakota said, we can\u2019t be two places at once. You talked about the one\u2013 do your job? There\u2019s no way to do that when you have to be two places at once,\u201d he added.", "description": "Republicans ripped AOC during a House Oversight subcommittee hearing after she questioned why the GOP lawmakers wanted to adjourn.", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/AP_19254649167273-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
