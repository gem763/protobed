It\u2019s hidden away but still Mum has found it. I take her by the arm. \u201cIt\u2019s OK. We can get out the other way,\u201d I say, leading her inside, through the chintzy cafe where no money is exchanged, to the lift. I bleep my electronic visitor\u2019s pass. The doors to the outside world open for us. Mum walks through them, asking no questions, and admires the flowerbeds.\n\nEven though she cannot remember what happened 10 minutes ago or when she last ate, even though this once immaculate lady, left to herself, would head for the street in a petticoat and one earring (\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t matter, does it,\u201d she said when I mentioned it), in spite of the holes in her mind that dementia has torn, the desire to go out appears hardwired. She found that gate, and then she remembered where she had found it.\n\nEarlier I watched as Jean, Mum\u2019s neighbour in the dementia home, walked up and down the corridor between her room and the communal area, tall and thin in her plaid skirt and jumper, the usual copy of the Times under her arm and anxiety on her face. Up and down. Back and forth. \u201cHas my mother come?\u201d she asks the carers. \u201cNo, I\u2019m afraid your family aren\u2019t visiting today,\u201d is the answer. Her mother died years ago. They sit her down, suggest television or a game, and she is instantly on her feet, asking the same question again.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mary Griffiths (above), a former nurse and housewife, wears a ring made from one of her father\u2019s cufflinks\n\nDementia is the scourge of our age. We have become so good at patching people up bodily that for many, it is the mind that goes; dementia now kills more people than any other disease in England and Wales, accounting for 12.8% of deaths last year. In 2017 it affected an estimated 50 million people globally, with nearly a million in the UK; the numbers are expected to double every 20 years. David Cameron launched a research push for a cure in 2012, but one drug trial after another has collapsed, casting doubt on fundamental assumptions about what happens in the deteriorating brain. The central approach \u2013 targeting the buildup of amyloid plaques \u2013 appears to be going nowhere much.\n\nMeanwhile, less attention is being paid to how we care for those whose minds are irretrievably unravelling, to where and how they should live. Most people in care homes \u2013 70% \u2013 now have dementia. It may be best for many to stay at home as long as possible \u2013 but that means 24-hour care. The distinction between day and night can disappear. One of the first warning signs my three sisters and I had came when Mum started annoying the neighbours in her block of flats, pressing doorbells to be let back in at 5am.\n\nThen there were the parcels. I drove her home one day, to find a large brown box outside the door. \u201cOh no,\u201d she said, in genuine distress. \u201cNot another one.\u201d It contained what she and I would both have called quack remedies for ageing: potions and pills, and a Christmas cracker trinket of a bracelet. Inside was an invoice, paid on her credit card, for over \u00a3100. She had not ordered or paid for it, she insisted. And there were others. She had a cupboard full of expensive soaps and knick-knacks \u2013 a \u201csound amplifier\u201d for \u00a330 (there is nothing wrong with her hearing), a \u201ccabbage detox\u201d for \u00a320. It had all been sent by two companies at the same address in France. I was livid. How dare they take advantage of her? But I now think she started it, sending off magazine coupons for hand lotion, though I know they got her to order more junk thereafter.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Norman Thomas, 68: \u2018My wife thinks I\u2019m losing the plot. She says I forget things... She\u2019s right\u2019\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Norman, a former dairy farmer and avid heli-skier, holds one of his ski caps\n\nIt\u2019s odd how the signals are there, but you don\u2019t see them. The flat smelling of burnt toast. I bought a new toaster. Her empty purse when she went out for coffee with friends. They paid. Her frequent trips in person to the bank. It didn\u2019t occur to me that she no longer knew her pin number. The huge bills she was running up for newspaper delivery. The shopkeeper kindly said nothing. The frightening times I called in the evening, when it was dark, and there was no reply. Finally she would answer, out of breath. She had taken the wrong bus. One time she said a nice man had driven her home.\n\nEventually my sisters and I understood she was no longer safe alone. She resisted any suggestion that she had a problem. \u201cI haven\u2019t got that dementia,\u201d she told me, sternly. But she agreed her memory was playing up. I used that to trick her into a GP appointment and referral to the memory clinic, where she was diagnosed, although no help was offered. We bullied her into twice-daily visits from a carer, who would sometimes arrive to find Mum missing. At Christmas at our house, she caught a virus and ended up in hospital, wandering the corridors at night. Staff refused to let her home without full-time care.\n\nMum hated losing her independence, the same way she had fought us when we \u201cborrowed\u201d her car a couple of years earlier and did not return it. I asked the carers to let her go \u2013 but follow her. At the home, where we moved her a year later because of her night wandering, and to be closer to my sisters, only the corridor and patio garden are open to her. She is not deceived, though she can no longer tell you what\u2019s wrong. She is a \u201csundowner\u201d: after tea, she will walk and walk, up and down the corridor. The challenges of caring for people like her in the way she would want, if she were able to explain it, are great.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nThere may be another answer. In a suburb of Amsterdam, Jannette Spiering sits at a cafe table in the sunshine, while women like Mum and Jean wander past. Spiering is the founder of the Hogeweyk, a dementia village whose fame has travelled the world. She used to help run a conventional care home on the site, which was torn down, and believed she could do better.\n\n\u201cWe can try to come as close to normality as possible within the restrictions people with dementia have,\u201d she explains. \u201cThese are mostly that they can\u2019t make their own daily structure, and they don\u2019t know when to eat, how to cook, how to dress, how to communicate. If they choose to go outside on a day like this, that\u2019s not for us to decide. That\u2019s why the front door of every house is open. We have to take care, if it\u2019s cold, that people put a jacket on and that their shoelaces are tied so they won\u2019t fall over them.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Irene Wilding, 92: \u2018If somebody told me I had dementia, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do\u2019\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Irene, a former biology teacher, holds a photograph that hangs on her bedroom wall (she is bottom right)\n\n\u201cOf course when people move in, they want to leave. I think I would, too, if I were locked up. But what I think is so lovely is you can go outside without someone watching or walking with you.\u201d\n\nThis is not a village in the traditional English sense. The houses, restaurant and a small theatre form the Hogeweyk\u2019s perimeter wall. Look up and you see it is sandwiched between blocks of social housing flats. But there is space and sky. There are little gardens and a pond with statues of herons \u2013 and a real one that takes off as I walk by. The 23 houses, each for six or seven people, are different and separate, but joined as they might be on a terraced street. Outside are shady courtyards with wooden tables and chairs, flower tubs and trees.\n\nThe Boulevard looks like a town street, but behind the shop fronts are clubs. There\u2019s the Mozart room, where classical music lovers meet. There\u2019s a painting and baking club, which Mum would enjoy, along with any sort of singing. She croons with Frank Sinatra and bops gently to Rock Around The Clock, given the chance. At the Hogeweyk, families sign up their relatives for the clubs that will suit them, though too many activities can exhaust people, Spiering says.\n\nIn the square, cafe tables are set beside a fountain. Off it is an arcade, with a waiter-service restaurant and a supermarket where the carers shop for each house. If residents wander out with a packet of cereal or a bottle of juice, it can be returned or paid for later. And there is a pub: there is no reason why people with dementia shouldn\u2019t enjoy a drink, although one daughter was scandalised that her non-drinking mother developed something of an advocaat habit. \u201cShe blamed us, but her mother just liked going there, attracted by the music or whatever,\u201d Spiering says. People can change for better or worse; some start to use bad language; inhibitions disappear.\n\nThe Hogeweyk has its wanderers. A woman with Jean\u2019s tense face walks the village paths stiffly and finally passes through sliding doors into the reception area, ignoring the notice that says \u201cSorry, we\u2019re closed\u201d. Behind their glass screen, the staff watch. She gets halfway to the double doors on to the street, which will not open unless the receptionists press their button, stops abruptly as if she has remembered something, turns around and walks back into the village. One of more than 100 unpaid volunteers intercepts and takes her for a coffee, to distract her. \u201cThere is still some part of her mind that recognises this is not her home and she can\u2019t accept it. I think it is very sad,\u201d Spiering says. Some residents walk all day long, so there are distractions to encourage rest: a large TV screen with seats in the arcade, and cafe staff instructed to invite wanderers in for a drink.\n\nThere is an element of the gilded cage of the 60s TV series The Prisoner, or The Truman Show, but while residents can\u2019t get out, the outside world is invited in. Young mothers and toddlers meet here weekly. Locals use the restaurant and go to the theatre.\n\nThe Hogeweyk is not for the mildly ill. Everyone here has late-stage dementia. The average stay is 2.2 years, but some people die within a few weeks. Only three out of 169 residents are in bed all day, Spiering says, and these three are not segregated. \u201cWe put them in the living room with their bed, because they can still smell and hear what is going on and be part of it.\u201d There is no sign of the agitation or aggression that often signals distress in people with dementia, no howls of anguish through an upstairs window.\n\nInstead of severity of disease, as in the UK, the Hogeweyk allots residents to houses according to \u201clifestyle\u201d. It\u2019s not a class thing, Spiering says, nor anything to do with race: it\u2019s about familiarity with your surroundings. The families choose which lifestyle is the best match. There are seven \u2013 urban, artisan, Indonesian, homey, Goois [a wealthy area near Amsterdam which once had its own dialect], cultural and Christian. The urban houses are home to former city dwellers; the artisan houses to people who had a trade or craft. The homey houses are for people, like my mum, who were homemakers; those who loved theatre and cinema are in the cultural houses. The decor and food will be typical of those communities. Some will prefer meat and potatoes; others are mostly vegetarian. The music is folk in some houses but classical in others; the newspaper on the table will be a tabloid or broadsheet.\n\nSuch segregation has its critics, but Spiering argues it is just what we all do for ourselves. We buy into certain lifestyles, or move to be part of a community we feel comfortable in. It doesn\u2019t mean people won\u2019t mix at the bingo group.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kathleen Bishop, 81: \u2018It\u2019s frustrating,\u2019 her husband, Allan, 84, says. \u2018We can\u2019t have proper conversations\u2019\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kathleen, who used to teach shorthand and typing, holds a photograph of her wedding to Allan\n\nThere may be an element of fantasy, but it is no more than in more traditional dementia homes \u2013 such as my mother\u2019s, where people like Jean walk an endless loop of corridors decorated to look like a high street, with Singer sewing machines in alcoves and pictures of the Coronation to recall an epoch that is more vivid in the brain than the recent past. Reality is a tricky concept when it comes to dementia care, as Spiering points out. Some people want to go home, or wait for a visit from their long-dead partner. \u201cWe try to distract people, or we go along with them. We say, \u2018Is it OK if we go for lunch first?\u2019 You can say it\u2019s a lie or you can say it\u2019s not telling the whole truth.\u201d\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nDementia used to be dismissed as normal memory loss, a side-effect of ageing. People tended to die of other causes, much younger, so it was less understood. When German psychiatrists Alois Alzheimer and Emil Kraepelin classified it as a disease in the early 20th century, they focused on younger patients. The deterioration of the brain in old age was still regarded as an inevitability.\n\nBut by the mid-50s, US hospitals began to be overwhelmed by elderly dementia patients. Psychiatrists started to frame it as a psychosocial problem, finding that people from some backgrounds, with the same brain changes, did better than others. There were calls for programmes of activities to keep ageing minds stimulated. After Medicare, the US healthcare programme for the over-65s, was founded, people started to live even longer lives \u2013 and dementia soared. By 1980, everybody had heard of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Funds have been poured into research, mostly to find a pill to reverse it, without success.\n\nPatients like my mum, who get a diagnosis, are prescribed a single drug, supposed to help slow the disease, and sent home. There is nothing more the NHS can do, or afford. Age UK and Alzheimer\u2019s charities offer helpful advice, but you have to seek it out.\n\nA third of people with dementia are in care homes, which seek to calm and stimulate residents whose memory of the recent past goes first. The walls are lined with photographs of Charlie Chaplin, Ava Gardner, the Queen as a girl. There are wartime singalongs. Living in the past is fine, as are white lies. We take Mum out for ice-cream and cakes at a garden centre, where last time she was overcome by the beauty of the flowers. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it,\u201d she kept saying. We stay in the present moment and talk about the mackerel sky and the planes she thinks are birds. We never talk about dementia.\n\nThe truth used to be served up cold. \u201cReality orientation\u201d was developed in the late 50s, on the basis that exercising the memory would keep it functioning better for longer. Patients were trained to know the name of the place they were in, what month it was, who the prime minister was \u2013 but it was confrontational and insensitive. If people knew that it was Thursday and that they were widowed, it didn\u2019t make them happier.\n\nInstead the focus moved to cognitive stimulation \u2013 gentle activities to keep the brain going, such as word games, puzzles, music, and practical activities such as baking or indoor gardening. A Cochrane medical review in 2012 found that 45-minute sessions at least twice a week helped people with mild to moderate dementia. There was some evidence that people were better able to reason, communicate and interact with others, and had a better quality of life. Such activities are now standard in dementia homes and day centres, along with dancing and gentle exercise and singing, all of which Mum loves. And how else would she spend her time?\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tom Ledson, 76: \u2018Everyone hopes for the future. You just have to hope that it carries on\u2019\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tom, who used to run a motor parts shop, holds a photograph of his wedding day\n\nThere are other theories. Penny Garner in Oxfordshire, whose mother had dementia, devised Specal (originally an acronym for specialised early care for Alzheimer\u2019s) to help families and carers communicate with a relative who has dementia. At the heart of this is the photograph album \u2013 the concept that people have memories stored like photographs, recording feelings as well as facts, and that when the facts disappear, the feelings remain.\n\nGarner considers dementia a disability and has three golden rules: don\u2019t ask questions that will only cause distress when the person cannot find the answer; listen to the person with dementia and offer them only information that will make them feel better; and do not contradict. Her son-in-law, the psychologist Oliver James, wrote a book about the method, called Contented Dementia, and many of its adherents are enthusiastic. But the Alzheimer\u2019s Society is outright opposed, arguing that not asking questions deprives people of choice and control over their lives.\n\nThe society is not enthusiastic about the idea of dementia villages, either. Dominic Carter, its senior policy officer, agrees that people have to be understood, offered activities and encouraged to eat and drink, but thinks it is \u201ca shame if we are willing to accept that the only way to do that is to segregate people and have them in environments that are so specifically focused\u201d.\n\nInstead the society wants to normalise dementia, with a flagship programme to accredit \u201cdementia-friendly communities\u201d \u2013 ordinary towns where the baker and hairdresser have been taught how to talk to people with dementia, and where local residents and bus drivers will be better able to see them safely home. So far, it has registered 400 communities, from Minehead to Billericay and beyond. Local Alzheimer\u2019s groups enlist shops, GP practices, libraries, churches, fire, police and social groups, whose members undertake training. There are also activities. Over one week in May, in Tamworth in the west Midlands, there was singing in the shopping centre and community knitting of forget-me-nots to aid the society\u2019s dementia campaign, which includes a call for a \u00a32.4bn government fund to help people with care costs.\n\nPeople with mild dementia will be safer and happier in a town that has more understanding, although the chances of getting lost in a city like Leeds must still be high. But as the disease progresses, the need for full-time care grows. While we might dream of Grandma sitting in a corner of the family home, watching life going on, being looked after by her children, that\u2019s a fantasy, says Professor June Andrews, former director of Stirling\u2019s Dementia Services Development Centre in Scotland.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never been families taking care of their own,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s been women. The extent to which it happens is related to the economic value of women.\u201d In countries where women are uneducated and unemployed, they do the caring, she says. \u201cAs soon as the daughter or daughter-in-law can get a job, they start importing a foreign domestic worker.\u201d And once those salaries rise out of reach, care homes spring up.\n\nIn the UK, there will be a shortage of 30,000 residential dementia places by 2021; the costs remain high and the quality is sometimes questionable. The Care Quality Commission reports that more than a fifth of services either require improvement or are inadequate. Is the Hogeweyk model the answer? It has been controversial since its inception in 1993. Medical experts didn\u2019t like it, while other care home owners feared for their own business model. In the UK, the notion of a dementia village has been dismissed as gimmicky and too expensive \u2013 often by experts who have not visited. Although it is run as a not-for-profit, the cost for each resident is \u00a353,000-\u00a359,000 a year, paid for by the government. Local authorities in the UK pay about \u00a330,000 to \u00a340,000 for a residential care home place.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Christine Judith (July) Hopkins, 77: \u2018Sometimes I don\u2019t know, sometimes I do know. You understand?\u2019\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest July, who was a homemaker and teacher, holds a photograph of her younger self\n\nAndrews is sceptical of the Hogeweyk\u2019s \u201clifestyles\u201d approach but says her own parents \u2013 a bus driver and a secretary \u2013 would never have been comfortable in a posh care home. \u201cHaving something that fits with what somebody is comfortable with is really important,\u201d she admits. But how would you categorise people in the UK, or find the volunteers the Hogeweyk relies on? \u201cThe bottom line is, who is going to be able to afford your model if it can only work with an army of volunteers? In the UK, hundreds of care homes are having to shut down because their buildings are not the right quality and they can\u2019t get the right staff.\u201d\n\nBut New Zealand and Australia have similar villages, and the first to be modelled directly on the Hogeweyk is likely to open in the UK later this year, in east Kent. Henry Quinn and Dr Phil Brighton, from East Kent Hospitals Foundation NHS Trust, tell me they were profoundly moved when they visited the Hogeweyk in 2015. \u201cWhat struck me most was when they said, \u2018The most important things are the front doors.\u2019 If you have a front door and it\u2019s raining, you can go out and get wet,\u201d Brighton says.\n\nQuinn went up on to the roof of Buckland hospital in Dover and spotted six semi-detached blocks of derelict houses. They got funding from Europe and are on track to open soon.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a gated community,\u201d Brighton explains. \u201cThere will be a boundary fence but not obtrusive or oppressive.\u201d There will be a hub where locals and residents with dementia can go for entertainment, as well as a cafe and a gym. The houses will have five bedrooms each and no locked doors. The team are exploring ideas with the local community, including keeping goats and forging links with a primary school, bringing children in for activities.\n\nIf we let them, people with dementia take buses to the end of the line. One man, used to global travel, evaded his carer, travelled to the airport and hopped on a plane to the country where he grew up. People in residential homes used to be restrained, tied to chairs. That doesn\u2019t happen any more. In the dementia-friendly communities the Alzheimer\u2019s Society promotes, technology might allow more wandering. There are already GPS devices, informing relatives of people\u2019s whereabouts \u2013 whether they want it or not.\n\nAnd that is the hardest part: knowing what someone wants. We make decisions for those with dementia in the hope of protecting them. Sometimes, when you hear of a woman, such as a friend\u2019s mother, rocking in her seat, whispering, \u201cHelp me, help me\u201d, you have to wonder if we have got it right.\n\nMy mum hates locked doors. When she lived in her flat, there wasn\u2019t a day when she didn\u2019t potter to the local shop or get the bus to town. It saddens me to see her wanderings reduced to a corridor and now, even though she is in a safe place with wonderful carers, she is starting to fall; last time I visited, I found her with bruises in another resident\u2019s room, as she frequently is. And for the first time, I did not get the sense that she knew who I was.\n\nFor Spiering, caring for people with dementia is all about calculated risk \u2013 \u201caccepting frailty and that, in nursing homes, people are going to have falls, and are going to die, and we can\u2019t prevent that. But we can add quality of life. And it\u2019s not by locking them up and not seeing them as human any more.\u201d\n\nMy mother is well looked after, by people who see her as human and lovable \u2013 but I am disturbed by her constant desire to leave. I want her to be safe, but even more than that, I don\u2019t want her to be unhappy. Most of all, I want her to live the life she wants, in the little time she has left. And it hurts that she can\u2019t tell me \u2013 even if she knows \u2013 what that is.\n\n\u2022 All the people photographed and interviewed either live or spend time at villages run by Belong, a charitable UK organisation that provides care, housing and support for people with dementia.\n\nIf you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).", "description": "When her mother started to forget, the Guardian\u2019s health editor began to examine how we look after loved ones living with dementia", "authors": ["Robin Hammond", "Sarah Boseley", "Report"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/973d49dae3f74b7be94cb913042c6ad1302a6465/642_1240_4862_2917/master/4862.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d312d1c51feff4ee35125d9d8722ede2", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
