Entrepreneur Edwin Drake's last financial backer had finally lost patience. Pay off your debts, give up and come home, the message read.\n\nDrake had been hoping to find \"rock oil\", a brownish unrefined \"crude\" oil that sometimes bubbled near the surface of western Pennsylvania. He planned to refine it into kerosene, for lamps - a substitute for increasingly expensive whale oil.\n\nThere would also be less useful by-products, such as gasoline, but if he couldn't find a buyer for that he could always pour it away.\n\nThe message had been sent, but Drake had not yet received it when his drill bit punctured an underground reservoir full of crude oil under pressure. From 69 ft (21m) beneath the surface, the oil began to rise.\n\nThe whales had been saved, and the world was about to change.\n\nJust a few miles south and a few years later, came a hint of what lay in store.\n\nWhen oil was struck at Pithole, Pennsylvania, in 1864, \"there were not 50 inhabitants within half a dozen miles\", according to the New York Times.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Pithole City at the height of its short-lived oil boom in 1865\n\nA year later, Pithole had at least 10,000 inhabitants, 50 hotels, one of the country's busiest post offices, two telegraph stations and dozens of brothels.\n\nA few men made fortunes, but a real economy is complex and self-sustaining. Pithole was neither, and within another year, it was gone.\n\nIts oil boom did not last, but our thirst for the fuel grew and grew. The modern economy is drenched in oil.\n\n50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world.\n\nIt is broadcast on the BBC World Service.

From cars to trucks, cargo ships to jet planes, oil-derived fuel still moves us - and stuff - around.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nNo wonder the price of oil is arguably the most important single price in the world.\n\nIn 1973, when some Arab states declared an embargo on sales to several rich nations, prices surged from $3 to $12 a barrel in just six months.\n\nIt led to a global slowdown, with US recessions following subsequent price spikes in 1978, 1990, and 2001. Some economists even believe that record high oil prices played an important role in the global recession of 2008, which is conventionally blamed on the banking crisis alone.\n\nAs oil goes, so goes the economy.\n\nSo why did we become so excruciatingly dependent on the stuff?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nDaniel Yergin's magisterial history of oil, The Prize, begins with a dilemma for Winston Churchill.\n\nChurchill was made head of the Royal Navy in 1911.\n\nOne of his first decisions was whether the British Empire would meet the challenge of an expansionist Germany with new battleships powered by safe, secure Welsh coal, or by oil from faraway Persia - modern-day Iran.\n\nWhy would anyone rely on such an insecure source? Because oil-fired battleships would accelerate more quickly and sustain a higher speed, required fewer men to deal with the fuel and would have more capacity for guns and ammunition.\n\nOil was simply a better fuel than coal.\n\nChurchill's \"fateful plunge\" in April 1912 reflected the same logic that has governed our dependence on oil - and shaped global politics - ever since.\n\nAfter Churchill's decision, the British Treasury bought a majority stake in the Anglo-Persian oil company - the ancestor of BP.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption An oil strike at an Anglo-Persian Oil Company field in 1909\n\nIn 1951, it was nationalised by the government of Iran. Our company, protested the British. Our oil, responded the Iranians. The argument would be repeated around the world over the subsequent decades.\n\nSome countries did well. Saudi Arabia is one of the richest on the planet, thanks to its large oil reserves.\n\nIts state-owned oil company, ASaudi Aramco, is worth more than Apple or Google or Amazon.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Saudi Aramco operates in 28 locations around the world and employs around 76,000 people\n\nStill, nobody would mistake Saudi Arabia for a complex, sophisticated economy such as that of Japan or Germany. It's perhaps a bit more like Pithole on a grander scale.\n\nElsewhere, from Iraq to Iran, Venezuela to Nigeria, few oil-rich countries have prospered from the discovery. Economists call it the \"curse of oil\".\n\nJuan Pablo P\u00e9rez Alfonzo, Venezuela's oil minister in the early 1960s, had a more vivid description. \"It is the devil's excrement,\" he declared in 1975. \"We are drowning in the devil's excrement.\"\n\nMore things that made the modern economy:\n\nWhy is it a problem to have lots of oil?\n\nExporting it pushes up the value of your currency - which can make everything other than oil prohibitively expensive to produce at home.\n\nThat means it can be hard to develop manufacturing or complex service industries.\n\nHistorically, many politicians have tried to monopolise their country's oil for themselves and their allies. Dictatorships are not uncommon. There is money - for some - but such economies tend to be thin and brittle.\n\nThat's one reason we might hope for something to replace oil. Climate change, obviously, is another.\n\nBut oil has so far stubbornly resisted giving way to batteries. This is because machines that move around need to carry their own source of power with them - the lighter the better.\n\nA kilogram of petrol stores as much energy as 60kg of batteries, and has the convenient property of disappearing after use. Empty batteries, alas, are just as heavy as full ones.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Electric car company Tesla is also developing pioneering battery technology\n\nElectric cars are finally starting to break through. Electric jumbo jets are a tougher challenge.\n\nThere was a time when it seemed as though oil might simply start to run out - \"peak oil\" was the phrase - pushing prices ever higher, and giving us the impetus to move to a clean, renewable economy.\n\nIn fact, oil is being discovered far more quickly than it is being consumed.\n\nThis is partly thanks to the rapid growth of hydraulic fracturing, or \"fracking\", a controversial process in which water, sand and chemicals are pumped underground under high pressure to release oil and gas.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The US Energy Information Administration estimates that about half of the total US crude oil production comes from fracking\n\nFracking is more like manufacturing than traditional exploration and production.\n\nIt's standardised, enjoying rapid productivity gains and the process starts and stops depending on whether the price is right.\n\nMany critics have expressed fears about its potential long-term environmental consequences.\n\nHowever, the Permian Basin - home of the US fracking industry - already produces more oil than the 14 members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) group, apart from Saudi Arabia and Iraq.\n\nIt seems we are still drowning in the Devil's Excrement, and may continue to do so for some time.\n\nThe author writes the Financial Times's Undercover Economist column. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy is broadcast on the BBC World Service.
