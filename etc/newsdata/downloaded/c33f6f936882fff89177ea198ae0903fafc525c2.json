(Joshua Roberts/Reuters)\n\nAhead of what is expected to be a combative congressional hearing Tuesday, former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski said he is \u201cexcited\u201d about a chance to defend the president in front of what he characterized as \u201cangry Democrats.\u201d\n\nLewandowski has been subpoenaed to appear before the House Judiciary Committee as part of its ongoing probe into whether President Trump obstructed the investigation of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\n\u201cExcited about the opportunity to remind the American people today there was no collusion no obstruction,\u201d Lewandowski said in a morning tweet. \u201cThere were lots of angry Democrats who tried to take down a duly elected President. Tune in.\u201d\n\n\u201c#Senate2020,\u201d Lewandowski added, referencing his consideration of a challenge next year to Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.).\n\n[Trump touts a possible Lewandowski Senate bid from N.H., calling him \u2018a fantastic guy\u2019]\n\nTrump last month touted the possibility of a Lewandowski candidacy in New Hampshire, calling his former aide \u201ca fantastic guy\u201d who \u201cwould be a great senator.\u201d Lewandowksi has said he plans to make a decision about the race next month.\n\nLewandowski\u2019s appearance on Tuesday marks the first time House Democrats will have a key witness in the Mueller investigation testifying in public \u2014 a move they welcome even if he is fiercely loyal to Trump.\n\nAccording to the Mueller report, Trump tried to get Lewandowski to persuade then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to limit the special counsel\u2019s investigation, one of the possible areas of obstruction laid out by Mueller\u2019s team.\n\nThe White House, in a letter Monday, told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) that Lewandowski is not allowed to answer any questions about his communications with the president beyond what was in the Mueller report.\n\n\u201cMr. Lewandowski\u2019s conversations with the President and with senior advisers to the President are protected from disclosure by long-settled principles protecting Executive Branch confidentiality interests and, as a result, the White House has directed Mr. Lewandowski not to provide information about such communications beyond the information provided in the portions of the report that have already been disclosed to the Committee,\u201d the letter reads.\n\nStill, Democrats believe they will be able to impugn Trump by merely having Lewandowski confirm publicly what he already told Mueller\u2019s team.\n\n[White House blocks two former aides from testifying before House Judiciary Committee]\n\nTuesday\u2019s hearing was also scheduled to include testimony from Rick Dearborn, a former Trump campaign adviser and ex-White House deputy chief of staff, and Rob Porter, a former White House staff secretary.\n\nBut Trump has blocked their appearances, claiming they are \u201cabsolutely immune from compelled congressional testimony with respect to matters related to their service as senior advisers to the President,\u201d according to a letter sent to Nadler on Monday by White House Counsel Pat Cipollone.\n\nIn a radio interview last month, Lewandowski said he was \u201chappy to come\u201d testify publicly before the Judiciary Committee and that a subpoena was not necessary.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t have to subpoena me,\u201d Lewandowski said during an interview on Fox News Radio. \u201cThey could have just said, \u2018Hey Corey, will you show up?\u2019 I\u2019m happy to come . . . because I want to explain that there was no collusion, that there was no obstruction.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am an open book,\u201d he added. \u201cI want to go and remind the American people that these guys are on a witch hunt, right?\u201d\n\nIn his report, Mueller said he did not find sufficient evidence to bring criminal charges of illegal coordination between Trump or members of his campaign and Russia.\n\nHe offered no conclusions about whether Trump had obstructed the probe but detailed several episodes of possible obstruction. Attorney General William P. Barr subsequently decided not to bring obstruction charges.\n\nJosh Dawsey contributed to this report.\n\nRead more at PowerPost", "description": "The president\u2019s former campaign manager will be questioned by House Democrats about an episode of possible obstruction detailed in the report of special counsel Robert S.
