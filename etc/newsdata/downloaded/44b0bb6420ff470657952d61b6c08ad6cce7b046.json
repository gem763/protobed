Cover would have been declined if we had been made aware of these at the time of purchasing your policy.\"\n\nWhile her insurer did, eventually, pay out - the warning it there for all to see.\n\n\u201cFailing to declare something as humble as paint protection film or different alloy wheels could void a policy entirely, potentially costing thousands in the event of an incident, and even putting motorists at risk of a \u00a3300 fine and six penalty points,\u201d Griffiths said.\n\n(Image: Alamy Stock Photo)\n\nMark Barlow, managing director of IFM Insurance, told Mirror Money: \"This type of behaviour by a minority of insurers questions the credibility of the whole insurance sector.\n\n\"My advice to drivers would be to use a credible broker who would not place cover with any insurer who would consider invalidating a claim on such a technicality.\n\n\"If you are insuring direct with the insurer, ask them the question.\"", "description": "It's a six pointer that even the most loyal fan can do with skipping - but insurance small print could cost you unless you're careful", "authors": ["James Andrews", "Image", "Getty Images Istockphoto", "Alamy Stock Photo"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20650786.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_soccer-ball-in-an-old-car.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
