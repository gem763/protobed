I suffered 2 punctured lungs, broke a finger, both wrists, the head of my humerus and both shoulders. I also fractured all the bones in my neck including a break to one and had multiple fractures and breaks to every one of my ribs. I have had quite a few surgeries to sort all this and now have a large amount of metal in me. All of this will heal fully.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately I also suffered a complete sever to my spinal cord at T9. This means that I am paralysed from my belly button downwards. This is of course not something that will heal. Whilst I still have hard moments I have accepted the situation I am now in and won\u2019t be letting it stop me do anything that I want to (including triathlon!).\u201d\n\nBut Danson emphasised she was \u201cstill exactly the same person\u201d and wanted to be treated as \u201cthe same old Claire\u201d.\n\n\u201cI still have crazy hair and a mad laugh,\u201d she said. \u201cI am still the clumsiest person you have met and I will still tell the most long winded yet entertaining stories.\n\n\u201cHaving decided to share my story with you including all the highs and the lows I would like you to follow me and I would like you to learn all about spinal injuries with me. This world is so new to me I want to help educate others as to what it is like and what it involves.\u201d\n\nHer sister Alex, an Olympic gold medallist, paid tribute to Claire on Twitter, describing her as \u201cthe most resilient, hard working and inspiring person you will ever meet\u201d.\n\nShe added: \u201cHaving already overcome many challenges in her life before, I know she will reign a champion of this one too.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why this has happened, sometimes I hate the world, but I keep hearing something in the back of my head.....\u2019Claire Danson you are going to change the world\u2019.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Triathlete Claire Danson has revealed she is paralysed after being involved a cycling accident in August.
