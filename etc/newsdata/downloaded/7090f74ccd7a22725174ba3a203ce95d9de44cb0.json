In the what-have-you-done-for-me-lately NFL, Quinn taking this team to the Super Bowl has become a rapidly fading memory.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing pressure-wise that would be more than we normally feel because of all the people in that locker room, all the fans - we\u2019re doing it for everybody,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cWe want to make sure we do it right. So when we miss the mark like we did, yeah, it stings. It stings bad.\u201d\n\nThe Falcons (0-1) have a chance to change the narrative Sunday night when they take on the Philadelphia Eagles (1-0) in the home opener at Mercedes-Benz Stadium.\n\nBut it\u2019s clear that Year 5 of Quinn\u2019s tenure is crucial.\n\nOwner Arthur Blank expects results after spending hundreds of millions of dollars locking up key players such as quarterback Matt Ryan and receiver Julio Jones. Blank is undoubtedly mindful that his other team, Atlanta United, won a Major League Soccer championship last December in only their second year of existence.\n\nThe Falcons have been around since 1966 but have never won a title, their closest call coming at the end of the 2016 season when they infamously squandered a 28-3 lead to New England in the Super Bowl.\n\n\u201cYou want to do right \u2026 but not any more than any other time,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cThat\u2019s our bond to Arthur, that\u2019s our bond to the city that we want to put out and do right by them, so they have a team that we\u2019re all proud of.\u201d\n\nSome things to watch for when the Falcons host the Eagles in prime time:\n\nTHREE-HEADED MONSTER\n\nDarren Sproles, Jordan Howard and rookie Miles Sanders combined for 116 yards rushing on 26 carries in Week 1 against Washington, helping the Eagles rally from a 17-point deficit for a 32-27 win. Coach Doug Pederson prefers to rotate his backs and likes to take advantage of mismatches, so it\u2019s likely he\u2019ll continue mixing it up.\n\nThe Eagles should have opportunities to run more against Atlanta. The Vikings gashed the Falcons for 172 yards on the ground. \u201cObviously, the Vikings did a great job in the run game,\u201d Pederson said. \u201cBut they\u2019re going home, they\u2019re going to play in front of their crowd. It\u2019s going to be a different atmosphere for us, and it\u2019s going to be a different team that we\u2019re going to see.\u201d\n\nQUESTIONS UP FRONT\n\nThe Falcons struggled mightily on offense in their loss to the Vikings and are still trying to sort out things on the offensive line. First-round pick Chris Lindstrom went down with a broken foot and is expected to miss at least eight weeks, forcing Jamon Brown to take over at right guard after he was beaten out for the left guard spot by James Carpenter during the preseason. \u201cOf course I wanted to start,\u201d Brown said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s here. My opportunity is here. I\u2019ve got to make the most of it.\u201d\n\nAtlanta is also using a rotation at right tackle with rookie Kaleb McGary and Matt Gono. McGary will eventually be the full-time starter, but he\u2019s still working himself into game condition after undergoing a heart procedure during training camp. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take some time to catch up,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when I do catch up, no one is going to be more excited about it than me.\u201d\n\nTIGHTENING UP THE COVERAGE\n\nThe Eagles finished 30th against the pass last season and showed no signs of improvement in Week 1. Washington\u2019s Case Keenum threw for 380 yards against a suspect secondary that didn\u2019t get much help from the pass rush. The defense only sacked Keenum once and gave him way too much time to throw. Defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz doesn\u2019t blitz much, so he relies on the front four to get pressure on quarterbacks. When they don\u2019t, the secondary is expected to do more.\n\n\u201cWe needed to cover better to be able to get the pass rush home,\u201d Schwartz said. \u201cWe can do better certainly in pass rush, but I think in coverage we can make the quarterback hold the ball a little longer and buy time for our guys to get home.\u201d\n\nFLY, DESEAN, FLY\n\nDeSean Jackson shows no signs of slowing down at age 32, giving the Eagles\u2019 offense yet another weapon in the deep passing game. He caught eight passes for 154 yards in his first game back in Philadelphia since being cut by former coach Chip Kelly following his third Pro Bowl season in 2013. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a lot of different weapons,\u201d Falcons cornerback Desmond Trufant said.\n\nINVISIBLE JULIO\n\nWhile Jackson had a huge game, Jones was merely a blip in the Falcons\u2019 offense after an offseason dominated by protracted negotiations for a new contract. The two sides reached agreement on a three-year, $66 million extension just 24 hours before the season opener. Then Jones was held to 31 yards on six catches by the Vikings, his longest play covering 10 yards. The Falcons will be looking for Jones to a play a much bigger role in this game.\n\n___\n\nFollow Paul Newberry on Twitter at www.twitter.com/pnewberry1963 His work can be found at https://apnews.com\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Dan Quinn brushes off any suggestion that he's starting to feel some heat.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Paul Newberry"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/08/falcons_vikings_football_88429_c0-140-3359-2098_s1770x1032.jpg?f498f39771d9388f10517dfe3497ebc1ef4a6e51", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
