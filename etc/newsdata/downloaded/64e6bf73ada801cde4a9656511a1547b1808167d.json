At the moment, Alexa sources answers to such questions from a variety of places, including the Mayo Clinic and WebMD.\n\nUseful for people with disabilities who struggle with computers\n\nThe partnership does not add significantly to Alexa\u2019s skill-set, but it is an interesting step for the NHS. The UK\u2019s Department of Health (DoH) says it hopes the move will reduce the pressure on health professionals in the country, giving people a new way to access reliable medical advice. It will also benefit individuals with disabilities, like sight impairments, who may find it difficult to use computers or smartphones to find the same information.\n\nThe UK\u2019s Royal College of GPs welcomed the news, with the organization\u2019s chairwoman, Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard, saying in a press statement that the collaboration \u201chas the potential to help some patients work out what kind of care they need before considering whether to seek face-to-face medical help, especially for minor ailments.\u201d\n\nBut Stokes-Lampard also warned that the scheme could have downsides. She warned that it is \u201cvital that independent research is done to ensure that the advice given is safe, otherwise it could prevent people seeking proper medical help and create even more pressure on our overstretched GP service.\u201d\n\nOther experiments to improve NHS accessibility using technology have had mixed results. A partnership with healthtech firm Babylon, for example, which offers patient consultations via a smartphone app, has been criticized for gaming the UK\u2019s healthcare system. Doctors says the app mainly attracts young, low-maintenance patients, while pushing harder and more expensive cases back to regular GPs.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear if the new NHS answers will ever be available to Alexa users outside of the UK, or if the service will ever recommend that users seek a doctor instead. We\u2019ve contacted the NHS to clarify these points and will update this story if we hear more.", "description": "The UK\u2019s National Health Service (NHS) has announced a partnership with Amazon\u2019s Alexa to offer health advice from the NHS website.
