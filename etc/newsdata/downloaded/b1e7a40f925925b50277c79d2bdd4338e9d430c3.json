I think that's the largest factor\".\n\nRisks to financial stability are still a concern for the policy committee, he said.\n\n\"When interest rates have been low for a long time, it has some impact on the leverage of the whole economy... We need to be mindful of that impact on financial stability as well\".\n\nHigh household debt levels - at 78.7 per cent of GDP at the end of June - are \"not healthy\", Mr Veerathai said, adding he is hoping that will come down or at least the trend will stop.\n\nRecent government stimulus measures are helpful, and more are expected, Mr Veerathai said. He declined to give details as to exactly what he expected, but said it was not only about spending money.\n\nOn Sept 25, the BOT kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 1.50 per cent - just a quarter point above the record low.\n\nBut it cut its 2019 economic growth forecast 2.8 per cent - which would be the lowest since 2014 - from 3.3 per cent, and predicted falling exports. Last year's growth was 4.1 per cent.\n\nIn April-June, Southeast Asia's second-largest economy expanded just 2.3 per cent, the weakest pace in nearly five years.\n\nThe rate cut did little to curb the baht's strength and with low inflation and weak growth, some analysts expect further rate cuts later this year.\n\nThe central bank will monitor the movement of the baht closely and is ready to deploy measures on \"undesirable inflows\" to make sure that the baht's movement does not hurt the economy, Mr Veerathai said.\n\nBefore the end of the year, the central bank will announce more liberalisation on capital outflows for Thai investors to invest abroad to help better balance inflows and outflows, Mr Veerathai said.\n\nThat will be a \"substantial increase\" in the ceilings that let investors such as mutual funds invest abroad, while the limit that allows Thai investors to directly invest overseas will also be increased, he said.\n\nThere will be measures that allow exporters to have more flexibility in keeping foreign currencies abroad, instead of bringing them back to Thailand, Mr Veerathai said.\n\nThe baht is Asia's best performing currency this year, up nearly 7 per cent against the dollar, putting further pressure on Thailand's export-driven economy.\n\nMr Veerathai said he did not expect headline inflation to be negative and it should return to the central bank's 1-4 per cent target range next year.\n\nThe central bank will decide at the year-end whether it needs to impose a debt service ratio limit, he said.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [BANGKOK] In the face of a strong baht that has been Asia's best performing currency this year, Thailand will further relax rules on capital outflows before the end of the year, the central bank governor said on Friday. .
