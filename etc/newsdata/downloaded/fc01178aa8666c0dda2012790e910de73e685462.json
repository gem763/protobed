It made the same offer Tuesday and Wednesday, deploying a tool it hadn\u2019t used in a decade. This latest action follows the Fed\u2019s reduction in the interest rate on excess reserves, or IOER, another attempt to quell money-market stresses.\n\nThe prior operations have calmed markets, with repo rates declining Wednesday to more normal levels after jumping to 10% on Tuesday, four times where it was last week.\n\nAfter policy makers wrapped up a two-day meeting, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday that the central bank will keep doing these repo operations if that\u2019s what it takes to get markets back on track. He spoke hours after the effective fed funds rate busted through the central bank\u2019s cap, evidence Powell and his colleagues were losing their grip on one of their most important levers for controlling the financial system.\n\nTo keep things calm, \u201cthe Fed is going to have to keep coming in and doing these operations daily,\u201d said Scott Buchta, head of fixed-income strategy at Brean Capital. \u201cPowell kind of minimized the issues of this week at the press conference, but overall the Fed probably did the best they could do for now to address this. But they will likely need to take more action ahead or at least discuss those plans further at their October meeting.\u201d\n\nPowell also said the Fed would provide a sufficient supply of bank reserves so that frequent operations like the ones they\u2019ve done this week aren\u2019t required.\n\n\u201cIt is certainly possible that we\u2019ll need to resume the organic growth of the balance sheet sooner than we thought,\u201d Powell said, referring to the central bank potentially buying securities again to permanently increase reserves and ensure liquidity in the banking sector.\n\nFed policy makers on Wednesday also lowered their main interest rate for a second time this year.\n\nMany strategists had predicted the Fed would take even more aggressive measures to reduce pressures in overnight lending. One idea that\u2019s gotten a fair amount of attention is something called a standing fixed-rate repo facility -- a permanent way to ease funding pressures, as opposed to the ad-hoc operations the Fed has used this week. Many analysts even predicted a Wednesday announcement that the Fed would start expanding its balance sheet.\n\nThat didn\u2019t happen. However, with the Fed apparently ready to keep injecting liquidity whenever it\u2019s needed, \u201cit\u2019s enough for now,\u201d said Jon Hill of BMO Capital Markets.\n\n\u201cThough they didn\u2019t announce a standing repo facility, what they did in essence is set up a \u2018sitting\u2019 one that can stand up when it needs to,\u201d Hill said. \u201cThe market now knows the Fed will come in during stress conditions. So this will kind of operate in the pressure-valve way that was so needed.\u201d\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Liz Capo McCormick in New York at emccormick7@bloomberg.net;Alexandra Harris in New York at aharris48@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Benjamin Purvis at bpurvis@bloomberg.net, Nick Baker, Mark Tannenbaum\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Let\u2019s do it again tomorrow.The Federal Reserve made crystal clear that it doesn\u2019t want U.S. money market rates to spike again like they did early this week, announcing it will -- for the third day in a row -- inject cash into this vital corner of finance.On Thursday, the New York Fed will", "authors": ["Liz Capo Mccormick", "Alexandra Harris"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/yI3ThZB0PtYQpSNtS1euBA--~B/aD0yNTEyO3c9Mzg4ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/85f33a95ea1be1621135e6df05195b6e", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
