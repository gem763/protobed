Then I want to hear how they propose to repair the devastating damage Trump has done to all three branches of government \u2014 and to our trust in our institutions.\n\nFirst, Trump has to be sent packing. I shudder to think of what four more years of this chaos and decay would do to the nation. Trump is so unpopular, and has so neglected making any attempt to broaden his base, that the agenda of the eventual Democratic nominee is clear: motivate loyal Democratic constituencies to turn out in large numbers; win back at least some of the Rust Belt voters who chose Barack Obama in 2008 and Trump in 2016; and invite independents and anti-Trump Republicans along for the ride.\n\nNone of these tasks is mutually exclusive, and none involves rocket science. With just a couple of exceptions, I can see any of the Democrats onstage last Thursday getting the job done. But then would come the hard part.\n\nPerhaps the most straightforward and least complicated undertaking, since it would be entirely within the next president\u2019s purview, is rebuilding the executive branch from the corrupted ruin Trump will leave behind.\n\nOne of the most underreported stories about the Trump administration is its basic incompetence. Perhaps Trump\u2019s biggest con of all was convincing his supporters that he was some sort of business wizard with a genius for management. In truth, the Trump Organization was a mom-and-pop family business that he repeatedly micromanaged to the brink of collapse. He is doing exactly the same with the government of the United States.\n\nThe White House itself is less like \u201cThe West Wing\u201d than \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d Courtiers vie for the favor of the Mad King, unable or unwilling to perform normal duties for fear of risking Trump\u2019s ire. Usually, the White House is a place where information from outside sources is synthesized and digested so the president can make the best possible decisions. Under Trump, the flow is reversed \u2014 his whims, however ill-informed or contradictory or just plain loopy, are tweeted out and must be made into policy.\n\nAgencies vital to our national security \u2014 including the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency \u2014 lumber along, month after month, without permanent leadership. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to make moves when they\u2019re acting,\u201d Trump has said, but really the situation reflects his own insecurity. By keeping his underlings weak and beholden only to him, he limits their power \u2014 and thus hamstrings the departments they nominally lead.\n\nSo the first job of the next president will be to restock the executive branch with the kind of competent, dedicated professionals who have served both Democratic and Republican administrations in the past. This will be a big endeavor, but it\u2019s relatively straightforward.\n\nMore difficult is figuring out how to address the damage Trump has done to the legislative branch. With the help of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Trump has rendered Congress all but impotent. Even measures with upward of 90 percent public support, such as universal background checks for gun purchases, cannot get an up-or-down vote because Senate Republicans are so terrified of Trump\u2019s displeasure.\n\nEven if voters hand control of the Senate to Democrats, McConnell would still be able to use the Senate\u2019s rules to delay, deflect and disrupt. In that eventuality, would the next president push Senate leaders to get rid of the filibuster? And if the Republicans retain Senate control, which is a very real possibility, do the Democratic candidates have ideas for going over, under, around or through McConnell to make Congress a functioning legislature once again?\n\nHardest of all will be fixing what Trump has done to the judicial branch. Trump and McConnell have confirmed more than 150 new federal judges, most of them far-right ideologues. Their impact on jurisprudence in the coming decades will be bad; their impact on public perception of the judiciary is already worse.\n\nWe need to be able to believe that justice is blind, that our judges are fair and impartial \u2014 including those who serve on the ultimate tribunal, the Supreme Court. Trump\u2019s brazen court-packing threatens to shatter that belief, and I don\u2019t know whether anything but probity and time can restore that faith.\n\nBenjamin Franklin famously said the Constitutional Convention produced \u201ca republic, if you can keep it.\u201d Trump will leave behind a banana republic, and his successor is going to have to fix it.\n\nRead more from Eugene Robinson\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.
