Look, they\u2019re already almost orange. The taste will be fantastic,\u201d he said, seemingly already tasting the Riesling to emerge.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Improved quality\u2019 \u2013\n\nWine production in the Elbe valley goes back more than 850 years. It saw its zenith between the 16th and 18th centuries but later crumbled under successive wars and the whims of the changing weather and river flows.\n\nAfter World War II, wine production restarted during communist rule, with farming cooperatives put in charge of keeping it flowing for local restaurants.\n\nWine also served as a bartering tool, something that was common during the period, says Zimmerling.\n\nBut bottles that could be purchased in then East Germany were often imported from fellow Soviet bloc countries like Hungary.\n\n\u201cAfter reunification, things really developed,\u201d according to the Saxony federation of the wine-growing sector.\n\nSeveral vineyards were sold and private properties created and, most crucially, \u201cthe quality of wine improved greatly\u201d.\n\nIn May 1992, the Saxony wine route was inaugurated.\n\nAlong 55 kilometres between Pira, Dresden, Meissen and Diesbar-Seusslitz, trails for hikers and bikers were cleaned up to help bring in tourists.\n\nWhile Saxony\u2019s wine-growing industry remains small, providing only 0.4 percent of total German production, it is attracting attention for its quality but also evoking a certain nostalgia for former easterners.\n\nHotels in the Elbe valley have reported bookings jumping from half a million in 1994 to 1.37 million in 2018, said local hotelier federation Elbland Dresden.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Arrogance\u2019 \u2013\n\nZimmerling, who purchased the vineyard in 1992 after completing an apprenticeship in an Austrian winegrowing region, grew his holding bit by bit.\n\nToday, it covers about 4.5 hectares (11 acres), on which he tries out a variety of grapes.\n\n\u201cI wanted first to make organic wine, but then also obtain quality that is unexpected for the region,\u201d he said.\n\nHis business isn\u2019t particularly profitable, he conceded, without divulging figures though he noted that his wife, a sculptor, brings more income home.\n\nToday, he produces with a handful of employees about 15,000 litres of wine a year, including some that is prized among the best quality in Germany.\n\nWhile most of his vintage is consumed locally, some makes its way to Poland, Denmark and even Japan.\n\nSome is sold too in western German cities, but three decades after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Zimmerling bemoans that east German wine still suffers from an image problem.\n\n\u201cUntil today, they refuse to admit in the west \u2026 that wine produced in eastern Germany can be good,\u201d he said, calling out a certain \u201carrogance\u201d.\n\nThankfully, he added, \u201csuch prejudices don\u2019t exist abroad\u201d.", "description": "Dresden (Germany) (AFP) \u2013 Klaus Zimmerling was bored with his mechanical engineering job when the 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall gave him the impetus", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/27/d0aaff_winemaker-klaus-zimmerling-dumped-mechanical-engineering-job-bought-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
