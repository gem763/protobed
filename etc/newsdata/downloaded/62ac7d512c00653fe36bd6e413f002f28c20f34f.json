It is also just more than a year before the presidential election, with the Democratic campaign to elect a nominee already at a fever pitch.\n\nRep. Stephen Lynch Stephen Francis LynchPelosi, Democrats send message on foreign policy with high-profile trip GOP protest overshadows impeachment hearing House Dems demand documents from State Department in impeachment inquiry MORE (D-Mass.), who was on the trip, emphasized that the timing was just a coincidence. Still, the Syria withdrawal drastically altered the context of the conversations between the lawmakers and the leaders of both Jordan and Afghanistan, who expressed open concerns, Lynch said, about the commitment of the United States to its allies overseas.\n\n\u201cThat was palpable,\u201d Lynch said. \u201cThere is concern, I think, on everyone\u2019s part.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe message to the Jordanians was: \u2018The U.S. and Jordan have had a long relationship of mutual support, and we continue that,\u2019 \u201d he added. \u201cIn Afghanistan, it was a similar expression of congressional support.\u201d\n\nDays before leaving on the trip, the House last week overwhelmingly passed a resolution opposing Trump\u2019s decision. Just 60 Republicans opposed the measure.\n\nAnd as if to underscore Democrats\u2019 foreign policy efforts, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel Eliot Lance EngelCheney says Congress needs to place sanctions on Turkey despite Trump announcement Judge orders State Department to release documents on Trump dealings with Ukraine House Dems demand documents from State Department in impeachment inquiry MORE (D-N.Y.) released a rare joint statement this week with several of his European counterparts that expressed \u201cregret\u201d at Trump\u2019s withdrawal and condemned the \u201cabandonment\u201d of the Kurds.\n\nAsked about the statement, Engel said his goal was to \u201clet our allies know that as far as I\u2019m concerned, nothing has changed.\u201d\n\nEngel, who was also part of the delegation, said the trip was \u201cvery important\u201d to reassure allies after Trump\u2019s withdrawal.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cOur allies have to know that we are responsible allies, and we\u2019re not going to cut and run on them,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, when we travel, we don\u2019t talk ill of the president or anybody else, we just talk about positive things and indicate to them by our presence that they knew why we were there.\u201d\n\nAsked for elaboration on the timing of and thinking behind the trip, Pelosi\u2019s office did not comment on the record before the congressional delegation arrived back in Washington and did not respond to a follow-up request for comment after it returned.\n\nPelosi was originally scheduled to lead a congressional delegation to Afghanistan in January, before Trump scrambled plans for the trip by denying her the use of military aircraft.\n\nWhen the trip finally happened, it came amid an uproar \u2014 both in Congress and from U.S. allies \u2014 over Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from Syria.\n\nFollowing a phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Trump announced earlier this month he would withdraw U.S. forces from northeast Syria.\n\nThe withdrawal paved the way for Erdogan to move forward with a long-threatened offensive against Syrian Kurdish forces.\n\nAnkara considers the Syrian Kurds terrorists connected with a Turkish insurgency inside Syria. But the United States relied on Kurdish forces to fight ISIS, an effort in which more than 11,000 Kurdish fighters were killed.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump announced a five-day cease-fire brokered last week by Vice President Pence would become \u201cpermanent,\u201d declaring victory despite the firestorm being ignited by his withdrawal.\n\nLawmakers, including many of Trump\u2019s traditional GOP allies, have widely criticized Trump\u2019s withdrawal as abandoning the United States\u2019s Kurdish allies. Lawmakers have also expressed concerns that the move will allow ISIS to regroup as the Kurds focus more on fighting Turkey.\n\nWith that scene as the backdrop, Pelosi arrived Saturday with eight House members in Jordan, which has been worried about escaping ISIS fighters making their way over from neighboring Syria.\n\n\u201cWith the deepening crisis in Syria after Turkey\u2019s incursion, our delegation has engaged in vital discussions about the impact to regional stability, increased flow of refugees, and the dangerous opening that has been provided to ISIS, Iran and Russia,\u201d Pelosi said in a statement after the Jordan stop.\n\nIn Afghanistan, the visit coincided with Defense Secretary Mark Esper Mark EsperOvernight Defense: Trump lifts sanctions on Turkey | 'Small number' of troops to remain by Syrian oil fields | Defense official's impeachment testimony delayed five hours after Republicans storm secure room Iraqi defense minister: US troops leaving in four weeks Trump announces he's lifting sanctions on Turkey MORE\u2019s own trip there, which Pelosi said allowed them to \u201cbriefly compare notes.\u201d\n\nThe congressional group\u2019s trip to Afghanistan also comes after peace talks with the Taliban were aborted after Trump invited and then disinvited Taliban leaders to Camp David days before the Sept. 11 anniversary \u2014 another series of events that sparked bipartisan backlash.\n\n\u201cMeeting with and hearing directly from our troops and diplomats on the ground is essential for Congress to conduct effective oversight of our mission in Afghanistan,\u201d Pelosi said in a statement after the Afghanistan stop. \u201cWe will return to Washington strengthened with the facts and the first-hand knowledge we have gathered at this critical time for our nation\u2019s Afghanistan policy and inspired by the courage of our servicemembers and diplomats on the front lines.\u201d\n\nRep. Mac Thornberry William (Mac) McClellan ThornberryOvernight Defense: Trump weighs leaving some troops in Syria to 'secure the oil' | US has pulled 2,000 troops from Afghanistan | Pelosi leads delegation to Afghanistan, Jordan Pelosi, delegation make unannounced trip to Afghanistan Pelosi arrives in Jordan with bipartisan congressional delegation MORE (Texas), the ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee and the lone Republican on the delegation, said the timing of the trip was originally meant to coincide with when the results of Afghanistan\u2019s elections would be known. Preliminary results from the September election had been expected Oct. 19, but have been delayed.\n\nStill, Thornberry said, since the trip did end up happening after Trump\u2019s decision in Syria, it was important for members of both parties to reassure allies and U.S. troops alike.\n\n\u201cI do think after the Syria decision that it was important to touch base with key allies, Jordan, Afghanistan, and convey at least bipartisan support for them in the Congress,\u201d said Thornberry, who has announced he will not seek reelection in 2020.\n\n\u201cWhile I don\u2019t think we got indications from our allies or our military that anybody\u2019s panicking about the reliability of the United States,\u201d he added, \u201cobviously there are concerns about what further decisions the United States may make that will affect them or their mission.\u201d\n\nMike Lillis contributed.", "description": "House Democrats are sending an implicit message that President Trump and his administration aren\u2019t the only ones setting U.S. foreign policy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/pelosinancy_102219twitter.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
