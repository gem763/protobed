Roads around the structure, built in 1836 and a prominent local landmark, have been closed.\n\nWitnesses said shouts and wailing could be heard coming from the chimney in the early hours of this morning before police arrived on the scene, according to local reports.\n\nHe is said to be dangling by his clothes, but appears to be topless. The fire service have also released a desperate plea asking for anyone with a large cherry picker to get in touch with them.\n\nEmergency services have used helicopters and drones in their attempt to bring the man down safely.\n\nThe helicopter approach was abandoned due to fears the downdraft would blow the man from the chimney as police said they would revert to trying to reach him from below.\n\nReports suggest police have talked to the man on Monday morning, suggesting he is still alive.", "description": "A man has been left dangling upside-down from the top of a 270ft chimney for more than 10 hours as the emergency services deployed a helicopter in an attempt to rescue him.", "authors": ["Gareth Davies", "Breaking News Editor", "Norman Tebbit", "Asa Bennett", "Henry Smith", "John Longworth"], "top_image": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/E0vEgvz4mmk/mqdefault.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
