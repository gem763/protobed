Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) applauded a nine-year-old child who claims to be transgender during Thursday night\u2019s CNN Equality Town Hall, and she suggested that the child assist her with choosing her education secretary, should she be elected.\n\n\u201cMy name is Jacob, and I am a nine-year-old transgender American,\u201d Jacob Lemay said to applause from Elizabeth Warren and the audience. \u201cWhat will you do in your first week as president to make sure kids like me feel safer in schools, and what do you think schools need to do better to make sure that I don\u2019t have to worry about anything but my homework?\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me start by saying I want to have a secretary of education who both believes in public education and believes in the value of every one of our kids and is willing to enforce our civil rights laws,\u201d Warren said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had some secretaries of education who\u2019ve been better, and we\u2019ve had one that\u2019s been a whole lot worse,\u201d she added. \u201cHer name is Betsy DeVos. So, when I\u2019m president, she\u2019ll be gone.\u201d\n\nBefore closing, Warren indicated that she would like to have Jacob vet who she chooses as the secretary of education in her administration.\n\n\u201cI want to make sure that the person I think is the right secretary of education meets you and hears your story, and then I want you to tell me if you think that\u2019s the right person and then we\u2019ll make the deal,\u201d Warren said.\n\nJacob smiled and gave Warren a thumbs up as he took his seat.\n\nFollow Kyle on Twitter @RealKyleMorris and Facebook.", "description": "Democrat presidential hopeful Sen.
