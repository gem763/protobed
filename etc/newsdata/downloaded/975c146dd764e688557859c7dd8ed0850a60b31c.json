Alaska has paid out an annual Permanent Fund Dividend drawn from oil revenue since 1982 to each resident . (A working paper last year found that Alaska\u2019s dividend didn\u2019t appear to disincentivize work.) Last year\u2019s checks totaled $1,600 per person.\n\nStockton, Calif. is currently piloting a monthly $500 payment among 130 low-income residents. And a Chicago task force in February recommended a $1,000-a-month guaranteed income pilot for 1,000 low-income participants.\n\nA study released earlier this year on Finland\u2019s UBI pilot program found that recipients reported greater well-being, less stress, improved mental and physical health and more confidence in their futures.\n\nMeanwhile, a study released earlier this year on Finland\u2019s UBI pilot program found that recipients reported greater well-being, less stress, improved mental and physical health and more confidence in their futures.\n\nHowever, the payouts didn\u2019t improve their ability to find a job, the researchers found. Critics of universal basic income maintain that giving people free money would discourage people from seeking out work and point out that such proposals often lack clarity and detail.\n\nWhether they call it a Freedom Dividend or a baby bond, some of the 2020 Democratic contenders have embraced the tenets of UBI. Here is what they\u2019ve said:\n\nAndrew Yang\u2019s bold proposal\n\nYang, a former corporate lawyer and entrepreneur promoting an exhaustive list of policy proposals, wants to give $1,000 a month to every American over age 18 \u2014 a \u201cno strings attached\u201d policy meant to help workers sidelined by robots, artificial intelligence and other new tech innovations, he says. Yang notes on his website he would pay for this annual $12,000 \u201cFreedom Dividend\u201d by introducing \u201ca new tax on the companies benefiting most from automation.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would improve people\u2019s health [and] nutrition, it would elevate graduation rates, it would improve people\u2019s mental health,\u201d he told CNN in April. \u201cIt would help people make transitions in a time of historic change.\u201d\n\nShelling out $10,000 a year to some 300 million Americans would run a bill of more than $3 trillion a year, according to one estimate published by the Center of Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nYang had earlier launched his own UBI trial runs without the U.S. government\u2019s economic might, personally funding $1,000-a-month payments for a year to three families in New Hampshire, Iowa and Florida, his campaign said.\n\nWhere the leading candidates stand\n\nJoe Biden: Prior to his current presidential bid, the former vice president came out against UBI in a 2017 blog post for the University of Delaware\u2019s Biden School of Public Policy and Administration.\n\n\u2018The theory is that automation will result in so many lost jobs that the only plausible answer is some type of guaranteed government check with no strings attached. I believe there is a better way forward.\u2019 \u2014Former vice president Joe Biden, who is running for the Democratic nomination for president\n\n\u201cThe theory is that automation will result in so many lost jobs that the only plausible answer is some type of guaranteed government check with no strings attached,\u201d Biden wrote. \u201cI believe there is a better way forward. I believe we can \u2014 we must \u2014 build a future that puts work first.\u201d\n\nThe ex-veep instead stressed the importance of training and retraining workers for \u201cjobs of the future.\u201d He advocated for offering two free years of community college, providing aid to communities bearing the brunt of such transformation, and ensuring that benefits and workplace protections remain in place.\n\n\u201cWhile I appreciate concerns from Silicon Valley executives about what their innovations may do to American incomes, I believe they\u2019re selling American workers short,\u201d Biden added. \u201cThe future will not change the enduring American values that got us here.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Warren: After Vox\u2019s Ezra Klein raised the idea of UBI during a June podcast interview, the Massachusetts senator replied that \u201cthere\u2019s so much more that we should do before we get there.\u201d\n\n\u2018Start with universal child care and education and investment in education from zero on through college, and let\u2019s see what that starts to do.\u2019 \u2014Elizabeth Warren, who is running for the Democratic nomination for president\n\n\u201cStart with the wealth tax. Come on. Start with universal child care and education and investment in education from zero on through college, and let\u2019s see what that starts to do,\u201d Warren said.\n\n\u201cDo the student-loan debt forgiveness and that will start to close the black-and-white wealth gap. Use my housing plan and attack red-lining straight on. Help close the differences between the poorest in this country and the middle class. Give people more opportunities. Let\u2019s get everybody on board and try that.\u201d\n\nKamala Harris: The California senator in October proposed the LIFT the Middle Class Act to mitigate cost-of-living increases. While not exactly a universal basic income policy, the LIFT Act would give large refundable tax credits of up to $500 a month or $6,000 a year to families earning less than $100,000 annually. Single filers who earn below $50,000 annually could get up to $3,000 a year.\n\nKamala Harris\u2019s refundable tax credits would cost more than $270 billion in 2020, according to an estimate by the Washington, D.C.-based Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.\n\n\u201cI am running to guarantee working and middle class families an overdue pay increase. We will deliver the largest working- and middle-class tax cut in a generation \u2014 up to $500 a month to help America\u2019s families make ends meet,\u201d Harris said during her campaign kick-off in January. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll pay for it by reversing this administration\u2019s giveaways to big corporations and the top 1%.\u201d\n\nHarris\u2019s proposal would cost more than $270 billion in 2020, according to an estimate by the Washington, D.C.-based Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. The Tax Policy Center noted that the plan would provide substantial relief for low- and middle-income people and appeared to be an improvement on the Earned Income Tax Credit, but warned it would be \u201cextremely costly\u201d and \u201cadd significantly to the budget deficit.\u201d\n\nWhen a voter earlier this year asked Harris whether Yang\u2019s UBI proposal was feasible, she replied, \u201cI haven\u2019t analyzed that policy,\u201d the Washington Post reported.\n\nBernie Sanders: Asked during an Iowa town hall in April whether he supported Yang\u2019s UBI idea, the Vermont senator replied, \u201cNah, I got a better idea.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust think about it: You\u2019ve got an infrastructure which is crumbling. We can put millions of people to work doing that. Transforming our energy system in terms of weatherizing homes all over this country, building a more efficient transportation system. Putting more money into wind and solar and other sustainable technologies,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe can create millions of jobs doing that.\u201d\n\n\u2018We need more doctors in rural areas and in urban areas. We need more nurses. We have a dental crisis all over this country. We need to train dentists and get them out there.\u2019 \u2014Bernie Sanders, another Democratic presidential contender\n\nHe wasn\u2019t finished: \u201cThink about day care. You want a world-class child-care center? You need well-educated, well-trained, well-paid child-care workers. We need many of them,\u201d the senator said. \u201cWe need more doctors in rural areas and in urban areas. We need more nurses. We have a dental crisis all over this country. We need to train dentists and get them out there. We need more social workers. You want to reform our criminal justice system? You\u2019re going to need people to start working with prisoners. You want kids not dropping out of high school? You\u2019re going to need mentors working with them.\u201d\n\nIn sum, Sanders said, a better approach would be \u201cguaranteeing a job in this country to anybody who is prepared to work.\u201d\n\nSanders later emphasized in an August interview with Hill.TV that \u201cpeople want to work\u201d and \u201cbe a productive member of society.\u201d He promoted the federal jobs guarantee over UBI.\n\nYang tweeted a rebuttal: \u201cBernie ignores the facts that money in our hands would 1) create hundreds of thousands of local jobs and 2) recognize and reward the nurturing work being done in our homes and communities every day,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHe also assumes that everyone wants to work for the government which isn\u2019t true.\u201d\n\nPete Buttigieg: \u201cI think that it\u2019s worth taking seriously,\u201d the South Bend, Ind., mayor said in a March interview with \u201cPod Save America,\u201d pointing to the Stockton pilot program.\n\n\u2018A lot of evidence would suggest that by far the simplest and most effective and cost efficient way to [boost third-grade reading levels would be to] just give the family a little more cash.\u2019 \u2014Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind.\n\n\u201cI know there are many times where we\u2019ve been sitting around the table working on some elaborate policy contraption to do something like boost third-grade reading levels \u2014 when a lot of evidence would suggest that by far the simplest and most effective and cost efficient way to do it is [to] just give the family a little more cash,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cBecause it turns out not being poor is one of the best things that can help you make it to a third grade reading level, because of nutrition or stability or whatever it is.\u201d\n\nButtigieg likes the idea of connecting such a policy with work, he said, but would also want to broaden the definition of \u201cwork\u201d to include typically uncompensated roles like caregiving.\n\n\u201cI think with a richer and thicker understanding of what work is, some kind of relationship between a guaranteed income and work, and some kind of structure that makes it equitable \u2026 I don\u2019t know that anybody can say now that they have a fully informed, considered opinion on this, but I think that it\u2019s the right moment to have that conversation,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter Yang\u2019s cash-giveaway announcement Thursday night, Buttigieg replied, \u201cIt\u2019s original, I\u2019ll give you that.\u201d\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke: The former Texas representative in March said he did not support universal basic income, according to Texas Tribune reporter Patrick Svitek. But by early June, Svitek reported, O\u2019Rourke called the policy \u201can idea worthy of conversation and debate right now as we see more and more jobs being automated out of existence.\u201d\n\nCory Booker: The New Jersey senator last year introduced a bill to provide every American child with an \u201cAmerican Opportunity Account\u201d starting at birth.\n\nThe accounts, which would be managed by the Treasury Department with a 3% annual return and accessible once a child turned 18, would be seeded with $1,000 and receive up to $2,000 extra every year depending on family income. Recipients could only use the money for expenses like education costs and home ownership.\n\nThe senator\u2019s office estimates that an account holder whose family made under 100% of the federal poverty line would have $46,215 in the bank by the time they turned 18, having received the maximum $2,000 payment every year.\n\nThese funds, Booker says, would help close America\u2019s yawning wealth gap. \u201cIt would be a dramatic change in our country to have low-income people break out of generational poverty,\u201d Booker told Vox. \u201cWe could rapidly bring security into those families\u2019 lives, and that is really exciting to me.\u201d\n\nSo-called baby bonds would \u201cconsiderably narrow wealth inequalities by race\u201d among young adults, according to a 2018 working paper by Columbia University researcher Naomi Zewde. \u201cA universal baby bond program would be race-neutral in its implementation, race-conscious in its design, and racially and economically progressive in its impact,\u201d she concluded.\n\nResearchers in 2015 estimated that a baby-bond program would cost about $80 billion, assuming four million infants born every year and an average $20,000 endowment.\n\nFormer Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton also floated a $5,000 baby-bond plan during her 2008 presidential bid. She even considered proposing a universal basic income policy during her 2016 campaign, she wrote in her post-election memoir \u2014 but ultimately dropped the idea after she was unable to work out the math, she told Vox\u2019s Klein in 2017.\n\nThis story was updated on Sept. 13, 2019.", "description": "The businessman has centered his campaign around a $1,000-a-month UBI.", "authors": ["Meera Jagannathan"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HN022_dems_i_ZG_20190710105557.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-09"}
