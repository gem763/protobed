When don\u2019t knows are removed the margin is 73-27.\n\nLord Hain said: \u201cBrexit, especially a hard Brexit, is a green light to Scottish nationalists to push for a referendum, and similarly for Irish republicans.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been fearful that Brexit would make the break-up of the UK more likely, and this poll confirms it. We\u2019ve already seen in other surveys that Tory Leave voters want Brexit even if it means Scotland and Northern Ireland leaving the UK.\u201d\n\nNicola Sturgeon has said she intends to table a formal request before Christmas for the power to stage a new referendum, and the issue is set to be a central plank of the SNP\u2019s campaign in the expected snap election.\n\nBut Mr Johnson said during a visit to Scotland that he did not see why he should \u201cgo back\u201d on the result of the 2014 referendum, which delivered a 55-45 per cent margin in favour of staying in the UK.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Throughout the Brexit process we have been completely ignored. The past three years have underlined the rising and unsustainable cost to Scotland of not being independent.\n\n\u201cIt is no wonder that support for independence is at record levels. The people of Scotland deserve the choice of a better future than the Brexit Britain being imposed upon us against our will.\u201d\n\nThe BMG study did not include the views of people in Northern Ireland, but a recent survey by pollster Lord Ashcroft found the outcome of a border poll would be on a knife-edge, with 45 per cent saying they would vote to stay in the UK and 46 per cent to join the Republic.\n\nThe DUP\u2019s MP for Belfast East, Gavin Robinson, said, \u201cNorthern Ireland\u2019s future is best served inside the United Kingdom for economic, social, cultural and historic reasons.\n\n\u201cThe criteria for holding a border poll are clearly outlined and have not been met. However, the focus should not be on holding a divisive border poll and creating further community tension in Northern Ireland.\n\n\u201cWe want to see the Northern Ireland assembly and devolved institutions restored so that decisions can be taken on schools, hospitals and the other vital public services which everyone relies on.\u201d\n\nBMG questioned 1,504 adults in England, Scotland and Wales between 3 and 6 September.", "description": "Britain\u2019s voters are ready to let\u00a0Scotland and Northern Ireland choose whether they wish to remain part of the United Kingdom following Brexit, a new poll has suggested.
