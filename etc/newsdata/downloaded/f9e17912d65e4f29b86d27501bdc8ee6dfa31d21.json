The opera legend indicated that he would never again perform at the Met.\n\nDomingo had been scheduled to sing the title role in the season premiere of Verdi\u2019s \u201cMacbeth\u201d on Wednesday night, which would have been his first performance in the United States since the AP reported that numerous women had accused him of inappropriate behavior, including one soprano who said he grabbed her bare breast.\n\nThe Met had been under increasing pressure to cancel Domingo\u2019s appearances, but general manager Peter Gelb reiterated to performers after a dress rehearsal Saturday that the opera house was awaiting results of investigations by the LA Opera, where Domingo has been general director since 2003, and the American Guild of Musical Artists, the union that represents various opera staff.\n\nDomingo, who had sung in rehearsals, issued a statement saying his Met career was over after what the company said was 706 performances as a singer, plus 169 as a conductor.\n\n\u201cI made my debut at the Metropolitan Opera at the age of 27 and have sung at this magnificent theater for 51 consecutive, glorious years,\u201d the star said. \u201cWhile I strongly dispute recent allegations made about me, and I am concerned about a climate in which people are condemned without due process, upon reflection, I believe that my appearance in this production of \u2018Macbeth\u2019 would distract from the hard work of my colleagues both on stage and behind the scenes.\n\n\u201cAs a result, I have asked to withdraw,\u201d he added, \u201cand I thank the leadership of the Met for graciously granting my request. I am happy that, at the age of 78, I was able to sing the wonderful title role in the dress rehearsal of \u2018Macbeth,\u2019 which I consider my last performance on the Met stage.\u201d\n\nIn its statement, the Met said the long-married, Spanish-born superstar had \u201cagreed to withdraw from all future performances at the Met, effective immediately.\u201d\n\nGelb sent an email to the Met staff saying, \u201cWe are grateful to him for recognizing that he needed to step down.\u201d\n\nThe Philadelphia Orchestra, San Francisco Opera and Dallas Opera previously canceled upcoming concerts starring Domingo after the AP stories were published. But his reception has been far different in Europe, where he received lengthy ovations after concert performances of Verdi\u2019s \u201cLuisa Miller\u201d at the Salzburg Festival in Austria on Aug. 25 and 31, just weeks after the initial AP story.\n\nAngela Turner Wilson, the singer who allowed the AP to use her name in accusing Domingo of grabbing her breast, said she was \u201crelieved\u201d by the Met\u2019s action, but criticized Gelb for previously asserting that the opera house could not act without corroborated evidence and that all of Domingo\u2019s accusers were anonymous. She called Gelb\u2019s remarks \u201ca major concern to me and many others who wish to see the current culture of sexual harassment and retaliation removed from our industry. It is time.\u201d\n\nAnother of Domingo\u2019s accusers, Patricia Wulf, also called the withdrawal a relief.\n\n\u201cI feel like we accomplished something,\u201d said Wulf, who accused Domingo of repeatedly harassing her during performances at Washington Opera in the late 1990s, while he was general director of the company.\n\n\u201cThe Met finally stepped up and did the right thing,\u201d she told the AP.\n\nIn addition to announcing Domingo\u2019s withdrawal, Gelb said the Met was suspending tenor Vittorio Grigolo pending the outcome of an investigation opened Tuesday by The Royal Opera in London, which said he was alleged to be involved in a Sept. 18 incident when he sang the title role in Gounod\u2019s \u201cFaust\u201d on tour in Tokyo.\n\nGrigolo, 42, was scheduled to sing six performances of Alfredo in Verdi\u2019s \u201cLa Traviata\u201d at the Met in February and March. He did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nThe Met fired conductor James Levine in March 2018 after an investigation by a law firm retained by the company found evidence of sexual abuse and harassment. Levine, the company\u2019s music director from 1976-2016, was music director emeritus at the time and denied the allegations. He filed a breach of contract and defamation lawsuit that was settled last month.\n\nDomingo made his Met debut in September 1968 and is known to many beyond opera for his performances as part of The Three Tenors with Luciano Pavarotti and Jos\u00e9 Carreras. Singing far beyond the retirement age of most singers, he shifted to baritone parts in 2009, extending his repertoire to more than 150 roles. He sang 21 opening nights at the Met, breaking Enrico Caruso\u2019s previous record of 17.\n\nDomingo\u2019s next scheduled performance is in Verdi\u2019s \u201cNabucco\u201d at the Zurich Opera on Oct. 13. He is not slated to sing in the U.S. until Donizetti\u2019s \u201cRoberto Devereux\u201d at the LA Opera, which opens Feb. 22.\n\nZeljko Lucic, originally scheduled for later in the run, will replace Domingo and sing all six performance of \u201cMacbeth\u201d at the Met. Domingo also had been scheduled for four performances as Sharpless in Puccini\u2019s \u201cMadama Butterfly\u201d at the Met in November.\n\nOutside the Met entrance Tuesday night, a poster advertising the \u201cMacbeth\u201d production had Domingo\u2019s name whited out, with the name of his replacement covering it.\n\nCathy Soderquist, a retired U.S. government employee from Washington who planned to see \u201cMacbeth\u201d on Wednesday, called the Met\u2019s action an overreaction in the \u201c#MeToo era.\u201d \u201dToo many allegations are coming in and people are being accused and penalized,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean, he\u2019s being accused, but he hasn\u2019t been prosecuted. He hasn\u2019t gone to court.\u201d\n\nSaid her husband, Dick Soderquist, \u201cEuropeans are kind of laughing at us.\u201d\n\nBefore Domingo\u2019s withdrawal, the New York state senator whose district includes the opera house had called for his removal.\n\n\u201cI believe they have an obligation to hold their performers to a high standard, given the fact that they are one of the world\u2019s most important cultural institutions,\u201d said Brad Hoylman, a Democrat. \u201cThey should be thinking also not just about his celebrity and star power, but about the 20 women who allegedly have made complaints. The Met has an obligation to ensure the safety and well-being of their employees and I\u2019m concerned that if they don\u2019t take action on this, this matter might discourage future employees from coming forward.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Jocelyn Gecker, Jocelyn Noveck and Verena Dobnik contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Metropolitan Opera announced Tuesday that Pl\u00e1cido Domingo had agreed to withdraw from his slate of scheduled performances at the opera house following allegations of sexual harassment made by multiple women in two Associated Press stories.
