BHP Group dropped 1.2 per cent to $36.20, Rio Tinto fell 1.1 per cent to $91.20 and Fortescue Metals Group closed the session 1.9per cent lower at $8.79.\n\nShares in supermarket giant Woolworths also fell. The group reported strong sales growth during the first quarter of the year, far exceeding the performance of its rival Coles who reported on Tuesday.\n\nBut that result was offset by news the company had underpaid its staff by up to $300 million in what could be the biggest underpayment on record. Its shares fell 1.4 per cent to $37.20.\n\nCosta Group shares were whacked after returning from a six day trading halt, dropping 24 per cent to $2.63.\n\nThe company was forced into another hefty profit downgrade and launched a heavily-discounted capital raising of $176 million to shore up its balance sheet in order to ride through an extended downturn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSell-side research analysts were also bearish on the stock, with Macquarie, Citi and Credit Suisse all heavily cutting their price targets on the fruit and vegetable grower.\n\nBega Cheese shares extended their slide from the previous session as brokers cut their price targets on the dairy producer following its earnings warning on Tuesday.\n\nOn Wednesday, its shares fell 7.6 per cent to $3.65 as analysts from UBS, Morgans and Bell Potter all reduced their valuation on the stock.\n\nDespite Wednesday's fall, the local sharemarket remains just over 100 points shy of a new record high.\n\n\"Valuations in the market are high compared to historical norms but the market isn't expensive and that's simply a function of lower rates,\" said Firetrail Investments portfolio manager James Miller.\n\n\"What we've seen in the last month or two months has been some more positive signs of life in the global economy. The trade war is still out there but has really gone into the background.\"\n\nShares in lithium miners also moved higher. On Tuesday, the London Metal Exchange said it planned to create a committee to aid in the development of a lithium futures contract, in response to demand for price transparency and liquidity.\n\nPilbara Minerals was among the companies chosen to form the committee, but closed the session flat at 30\u00a2 while Orocobre firmed 4.3 per cent to $2.66 and Galaxy Resources rose 5.7 per cent to 93\u00a2.\n\nGenworth Mortgage Insurance shares also rose firmly, climbing 10.6 per cent to $3.96.
