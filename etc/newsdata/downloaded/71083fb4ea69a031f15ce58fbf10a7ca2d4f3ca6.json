Then the regular season begins and the league is reminded of how fragile expectations are for any team\u2014a cycle the Cleveland Browns showcased in spectacular fashion on Sunday.\n\nThe off-season had convinced many fans that the Browns would actually be good, even though they haven\u2019t finished with a winning record since 2007 or a playoff berth since 2002. But their years of misery finally netted them a collection of enviable young talent, highlighted by quarterback Baker Mayfield and the addition of one of the game\u2019s pre-eminent stars, receiver Odell Beckham Jr. After winning five of their last seven games last season, there was reason to think that the idea of Cleveland as a contender wasn\u2019t utterly crazy.\n\nThen the first game of the season happened: The Browns were summarily dispatched 43-13 at home by the Tennessee Titans. Mayfield was repeatedly hit hard and hampered by a hand injury that was wrapped up after the game.\n\nThe game was a reminder that, no matter how bullish expectations are for any team, it can all go haywire instantly. In just a matter of minutes, the most important players can go down and capsize the fortunes of their teams. At a time when the league is pushing to expand its schedule to 18 games, some of its top players have trouble surviving the first week\u2014a sign of why players have balked on the idea to lengthen the season so far.\n\nKansas City\u2019s 40-26 win over Jacksonville encapsulated this phenomenon. Patrick Mahomes sprained his ankle, and Chiefs receiver Tyreek Hill, went down with a more serious shoulder injury. In the same game, Jaguars\u2019 quarterback Nick Foles got injured and will be out for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe Browns Lost Badly\n\nThings didn\u2019t begin so horribly for the Browns. They marched down the field for a touchdown on the first drive of the game, finished the first quarter up 6-3 and looked poised to deliver on the expectations that preceded kickoff.\n\nFrom there, it wasn\u2019t so hunky dory. Mayfield was sacked five times and finished the game with three interceptions.\n\nTitans defenders tackle Browns running back Nick Chubb.

He had a wrap on his throwing hand following the game after absorbing a constant flood of pressure and knocks to the ground. Although tests on his hand reportedly came up negative, it raised questions about why he struggled and how the injury will affect him down the road. And even if his hand turns out to be fine, the offensive line\u2019s inability to protect him could be deeply problematic.\n\nNext week, the Browns will face the New York Jets, another team with a promising young quarterback, Sam Darnold, who disappointed in the opening week as his team blew a 16-0 lead and lost to the Bills.\n\nThe Chiefs Rolled\n\nThe Chiefs breezed past the Jaguars 40-26 in their season opener, which wasn\u2019t altogether surprising. Kansas City\u2019s offense has been the NFL\u2019s most vaunted since Patrick Mahomes took over at the start of last season, and that began where it left off last year. Mahomes threw for 378 yards, three touchdowns and completed 25 of 33 passes. Most of those yards came in the first half, before they could pump the brakes and claim their win.\n\nThe Chiefs rolled but had a brief scare when quarterback Patrick Mahomes injured his ankle.

In the second quarter, Mahomes went down, hobbled off with an ankle injury and entered the dreaded blue tent on the sidelines. Briefly, backup Matt Moore entered the game and missed on the only pass he attempted.\n\nBefore too long, Mahomes was back on the field and even though he appeared limited, and it wasn\u2019t particularly troubling because the Chiefs could cruise on their way to a win. Afterward, coach Andy Reid described the injury as an ankle sprain, but even Mahomes noted he wasn\u2019t as mobile afterward. \u201cThe adrenaline helped out, of course,\u201d he said.\n\nHis teammate\u2019s fate wasn\u2019t as promising. Hill, who escaped punishment from the NFL over the off-season after a police investigation into injuries suffered by his child and emerged with a lucrative new contract extension from the team, suffered a shoulder injury that could deprive Mahomes of his primary weapon for some time. Hill, who was fourth in the league in receiving yards a year ago, will miss at least a few weeks, according to ESPN.\n\nThe injury was a wake-up call. Mahomes\u2019s 2018 season, when he threw a league-high 50 touchdowns in his first year as a starter en route to winning Most Valuable Player, relied on him staying in top-top health throughout. That may be tough for Mahomes: he absorbed 84 hits last season\u201410 more than any other quarterback, according to Football Outsiders. And even though Mahomes is expected to continue playing, the injury could limit the mobility that makes so many of his throws possible.\n\nTough Break for Foles\n\nIn that same game against the Chiefs, the Jaguars launched their new look. The Blake Bortles era at quarterback was over, and the Nick Foles era started.\n\nJacksonville Jaguars quarterback Nick Foles walks on the field with his arm in a sling.

Foles, who won the Super Bowl with the Eagles two years ago and stepped in again for Carson Wentz last year, got his next chance at a full-time gig this off-season when he signed a rich new deal with Jacksonville. And the Jaguars got their hope for a strong offense after years with a promising defense but middling play at quarterback to support that.\n\nFoles, though, went down quickly after completing 5 of 8 passes for 75 yards and a touchdown. He\u2019ll have surgery on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s not the way you want to start your time here,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate.\u201d\n\nBut there was a bit of hope for Jacksonville: Gardner Minshew, a rookie sixth-round pick out of Washington State, completed 22 of 25 passes for 275 yards, two touchdowns and one interception in Foles\u2019s absence.\n\nShare Your Thoughts What were your biggest takeaways from Week 1 of the NFL season?
