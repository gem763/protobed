It was nothing new for the actress and pharmaceutical sales rep, then known as just Donna Rice. After all, she booked her first television spot, a Pizza Hut ad, in the ninth grade.\n\nShe had worked on \u201cdozens\u201d of national and regional commercials, and appeared on One Life to Live and Miami Vice. But then again, by 1987, Rice Hughes wasn\u2019t known for her acting career.\n\nRice Hughes\u2019 late twenties had torpedoed into a media firestorm after The National Enquirer published a cover photo showing the former pageant queen sitting on the lap of Gary Hart, a Democratic frontrunner in the 1988 presidential campaign.\n\nIn the wake of a tabloid feeding frenzy, Rice Hughes quit the marketing gig she loved. A Folgers ad shot where she played a young wife, shot before the scandal, was pulled from stations. To put it bluntly, as Rice Hughes did to The Daily Beast, \u201cI had no source of income.\u201d\n\nSo when reps from a then-unknown denim line called No Excuses got in touch with her agent, Rice Hughes felt it was time to button up her size zero jeans and get to work.\n\nRice Hughes wasn't alone: Marla Maples, Joan Rivers, and Monica Seles also donned the jeans, while Paula Jones and Nicole Brown Simpson\u2019s sister, Denise, became non-jeans wearing figureheads for the brand too.\n\n\u201cI agreed to do a commercial, not as an endorsement deal, but as an actor and a model,\u201d Rice Hughes said. \u201cAt the time, doing a TV commercial was consistent with my career, and therefore seemed to be one of the only offers coming in that was not exploitative of my situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlso, the name No Excuses seemed to work for me, as I had decided to take responsibility for my own choices and my own mistakes, while others involved in the 1987 situation avoided personal and professional responsibility,\u201d she added.\n\nRice Hughes enjoyed filming the 15-second commercial. \u201cI loved acting,\u201d she said. \u201cWe basically ditched the script and I did improvisation, which I enjoyed.\u201d\n\nBut the end result, where the camera grazed up Rice Hughes\u2019 acid wash-clad leg as she lounged on a chaise, before delivering the line, \u201cI make no excuses; I only wear them,\u201d felt cheap to the actress. Columnists across the world had much to critique, too.\n\n\u201cFar be it from me to judge Miss Rice in matters of the Hart, but to parlay her notoriety into quick little TV tricks is the sort of Madison Avenue behavior you generally run into only after dark\u2014like from the lady with the red spike heels on the corner of 53rd Street,\u201d the critic Bob Garfield wrote of the spot in his Ad Age column.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t happy with the finished TV spots because they added sexy music and panned my body with the camera, making the commercials more provocative as opposed to fun and campy,\u201d Rice Hughes said. \u201cI had many opportunities to make millions of dollars [after the Hart scandal], some legitimate and others exploitative; this turned out to be exploitative, not by me, but by the company. I regret it.\u201d\n\nRice Hughes also claims that No Excuses leaked news of the campaign to the press, labeling her as endorsing the label when all she wanted to do was act in one commercial.\n\n\u201c I wanted to be taken seriously and regain my credibility and reputation, which was shattered at the time. I also wanted my pain and trauma to count for something bigger than me \u201d \u2014 Donna Rice\n\n\u201cI had not wanted my name to be involved, which in hindsight was naive,\u201d Rice Hughes explained. \u201cI wanted to be taken seriously and regain my credibility and reputation, which was shattered at the time. I also wanted my pain and trauma to count for something bigger than me. So yes, I eventually went underground to heal.\u201d\n\nAfter nearly a decade out of the spotlight, Rice Hughes emerged as an early internet safety advocate. She is the CEO of the organization Enough Is Enough, where she has worked for 25 years.\n\nJoan Rivers succeeded Rice as a No Excuses spokesperson with the undeniably Rivers quip, \u201cIt was a tossup between me and Lady Di. I guess the real princess won.\u201d Monica Seles and Marla Maples followed in double-denim suit, with the latter\u2019s 1990 ad debuting months after being named the \u201cother woman\u201d in Donald and Ivana Trump\u2019s contentious divorce.\n\nMaples would eventually marry Trump after languishing in Page Six hell for four years. One No Excuses shot finds Maples doing her best earth mother in a field of flowers, throwing tabloids into a trash can. \u201cThe most important thing we can do today is clean up our planet,\u201d the copy preaches. \u201cAnd I\u2019m starting with these...\u201d\n\nLater, No Excuses donated $500,000 to both Paula Jones and Nicole Brown Simpson\u2019s sister, Denise, as publicity stunts. (Neither Jones or Denise Brown posed for campaigns.)\n\n\u201cI see this as an opportunity to take an unfortunate situation and turn it into a positive action,\u201d Jones told Maureen Dowd of The New York Times, who described the Rockefeller Center press conference as \u201creal life [racing] past satire.\u201d\n\nNeil Cole owned No Excuses, which later licensed more apparel, shoes, and perfume before fizzling out in the late \u201990s. \u201cWe wanted to do something very similar to the Calvin Klein, Brooke Shields commercial at the time,\u201d Cole said, referencing the 1981 standard-bearing ad for sexy jeans, where the young actress purred, \u201cNothing comes between me and my Calvins.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if these spokeswomen were trying to make a political statement, or maybe they considered it female empowerment. It was a different time,\u201d Cole offered.\n\n\u201c Frankly, a little bit of controversy at the press conferences didn\u2019t hurt us. I still to this day wonder at these women for their bravery. I\u2019m happy they did the ads, and I\u2019m proud of them \u201d\n\nDarci Marder was 22 years old when Cole hired her to be No Excuses\u2019 director of advertising and public relations. Her job often included press-training models, standing by them while they spoke to cameras, and shutting down reporter questions that didn\u2019t relate to denim.\n\n\u201cFrankly, a little bit of controversy at the press conferences didn\u2019t hurt us,\u201d Marder admitted. \u201cI still to this day wonder at these women for their bravery. I\u2019m happy they did the ads, and I\u2019m proud of them. I was invited to Marla\u2019s wedding [to Donald Trump], she was that happy and pleased with how the campaign turned out.\u201d\n\nMarder doesn\u2019t remember Donald Trump palling around on set with Maples, though she has a \u201cvague recollection\u201d of the then-developer looking over her contract. Cole said his family were tenants at Trump Tower \u201cduring the early days.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can go really far with [advertising] jeans,\u201d Jon Bond, who worked on the commercials when he led the agency Kirshenbaum Bond + Partners, said. \u201cIt\u2019s not BMW or a pharmaceutical product. It\u2019s just friggin\u2019 jeans, so no one gets hurt.\u201d\n\nBut, Bond insists that No Excuses \u201cgave these women a voice and a platform. They were a part of their story now, whereas they felt like they were exploited when they were just in the press or the media.\u201d\n\nNo Excuses was equal-opportunity in the snark department; though the brand is most famous for its Rice Hughes connection, Cole also hired industry legend George Lois to create ads for WWD that also lampooned errant men.\n\nHe called it the \u201cNo Excuses Award of the Month,\u201d dedicated to the principle that \u201cto err is human, but to take the heat and make no excuses for it is divine.\u201d\n\nThe publishing mogul Malcolm Forbes threw himself a lavish 70th birthday party in Tangier that boasted an 880-plus star-studded guest list. Critics called the f\u00eate a bacchanal, unnecessary display of wealth. Lois\u2019 cheeky copy read that Forbes won his honorary No Excuses Award, \u201cFor feeding 800 hungry people in Africa.\u201d\n\nForbes called Lois when the ad ran, and Lois\u2019 receptionist nervously put the call through. \u201cI said, \u2018Malcom, you got a problem with the ad?\u2019\u201d Lois remembered. \u201cHe said, \u2018God no, is there any way you can get me 880 reprints?\u2019 It was a scream.\u201d\n\nLois had no qualms parodying the misdeeds of the stupidly rich (or stupid and rich) like Leona Helmsley, Dan Quayle, and the execs of Exxon Valdez post-oil spill. \u201cIf [Exxon] sued me for that, that would have been great. I would have loved that,\u201d Lois laughed. \u201cThey almost destroyed the Alaska coastline.\u201d\n\nNo Excuses may be no longer, and even after a long career as a child's safety advocate Rice Hughes still says the campaign \u201chaunts\u201d her. She would not go back and do it again if given the chance. And yet, she still owns a pair of size zero No Excuses jeans.\n\n\u201cI believe I saved a pair,\u201d she said. \u201c[I\u2019m] not sure where they are now. They were cute and fit great.\u201d", "description": "Donna Rice Hughes remembers when she, along with Marla Maples, Joan Rivers, and Monica Seles donned No Excuses jeans\u2014a headline-friendly fashion line that made scandal wearable.", "authors": ["Alaina Demopoulos", "Style Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567367819/190901-demopoulous-no-excuses-tease_dwrfz5"}
