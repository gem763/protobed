Political deadlock has since delayed the appointment process to replace him, with the planned date of Oct. 31 for the U.K.\u2019s departure from the EU already meaning that Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid might wait until after then to name a new governor.\n\nThe Treasury advertised for a successor under Javid\u2019s predecessor, Philip Hammond, and a panel of officials prepared a shortlist that could conceivably be discarded by the current government.\n\nThe five people who are thought to have made it to that round are mainly current or former BOE officials, according to the FT. It identified them as Shriti Vadera, chair of Santander (MC: ) U.K., Financial Conduct Authority Chief Executive Officer Andrew Bailey, London School of Economics Director Minouche Shafik, Ben Broadbent and Jon Cunliffe -- both of whom are deputy governors at the central bank.\n\n(Updates with comment from Treasury in third paragraph.)", "description": "Carney May Be Asked to Extend BOE Term Again, FT Reports", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic9835db281f77548f8dfbb1720d07b199.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
