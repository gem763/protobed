He is a clinician scientist at the Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute at St. Michael\u2019s Hospital in Toronto.\n\n\u201cWe hope that our findings help inform public policy changes. This is no longer a question of whether free distribution of medicines can improve health outcomes. It is a question of whether governments will act,\u201d Persaud added in a hospital news release.\n\nThe list of 128 essential medicines made available to patients in the study was adapted from the World Health Organization\u2019s Model List of Essential Medicines and based on Canadian clinical practice guidelines, suggestions from doctors and patients and prescription data.\n\nCanada is a suitable place to assess the impacts of free medicine distribution because while health care services such as physician visits and hospitalizations are publicly funded, there are cost barriers to medications, Persaud explained.\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. National Library of Medicine offers advice about how to save money on medicines.\n\nCopyright 2019 HealthDay.
