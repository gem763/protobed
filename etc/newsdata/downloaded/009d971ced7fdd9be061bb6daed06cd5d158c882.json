The injury from Wuhan, it\u2019s getting worse, so I have to go home and take an MRI... take a break and do some treatment.\u201d\n\nFifth seed Bianca Andreescu survived a second-set onslaught from Aliaksandra Sasnovich to win her first match since her U.S. Open triumph. Her 6-2 2-6 6-1 victory over the Belarusian set up a third-round clash with Elise Mertens.\n\nA poor service game from Andreescu, which included six double faults, gave Sasnovich 16 break points but the unseeded 25-year-old was able to convert only four.\n\nThird seed Elina Svitolina won two tiebreaks to dispatch China\u2019s Wang Yafan 7-6(5) 7-6(1) while Belinda Bencic battled back from a set down to beat veteran Venus Williams 3-6 6-3 7-5.\n\nDefending champion Caroline Wozniacki sailed into the second round with a 6-1 6-3 win over American Lauren Davis.", "description": "Russia's Ekaterina Alexandrova upset sixth seed Simona Halep in straight sets in the second round of the China Open on Monday, recording a 6-2 6-3 win in Beijing for her first top-10 victory of the season.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
