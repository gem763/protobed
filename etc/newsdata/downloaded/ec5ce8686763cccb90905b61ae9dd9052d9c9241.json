More recently, Capital One said in July that data of six million Canadians was hacked, including about a million social insurance numbers. Desjardins said in June that the data of about 2.7 million accounts was hit with a breach.\n\nThe problem is that no system is foolproof, said Hasan Cavusoglu, an associate professor of management information systems at the UBC Sauder School of Business.\n\n\"The reality is this is a moving target. Organizations are every day exposed to new type of attack vectors, new kinds of threat actors.\"\n\nHe said customers have little choice but to have their data held with TransUnion and Equifax.\n\n\"As long as you do some kind of transaction, your data will inevitably fall into these companies.\"\n\nThe two credit monitoring agencies collect a variety of financial data to help banks and other lenders figure out how reliably a customer might pay them back. The model means the agencies want to collect as much information as possible to clearly represent someone's credit worthiness, said Cavusoglu.\n\nWhile breaches are impossible to rule out entirely, major financial institutions like credit agencies have significant incentives to keep the data safe, he said.\n\n\"Reputational damage as a result of these kinds of attacks is tremendous, let alone other kind of maybe regulatory sort of penalties as well as some legal costs associated with it. So they don't want that reputational damage.\"\n\nChicago-based TransUnion continues to look for ways to strengthen its defences against unauthorized access of any kind, and supports customers in efforts to protect their data, Blumberg said.", "description": "The personal information of about 37,000 Canadians held by TransUnion may have been compromised this past summer,\u00a0leaving both of Canada's credit monitoring agencies with data blemishes on their record.", "authors": ["The Canadian Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5253932.1570659856!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/transunion-debt-report-20190820.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
