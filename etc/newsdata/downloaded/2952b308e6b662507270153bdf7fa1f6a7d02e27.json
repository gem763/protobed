Now you can read their records.", "language": "en", "text": "At least 85,000 law enforcement officers across the USA have been investigated or disciplined for misconduct over the past decade, an investigation by USA TODAY Network found.\n\nOfficers have beaten members of the public, planted evidence and used their badges to harass women. They have lied, stolen, dealt drugs, driven drunk and abused their spouses.\n\nDespite their role as public servants, the men and women who swear an oath to keep communities safe can generally avoid public scrutiny for their misdeeds.\n\nThe records of their misconduct are filed away, rarely seen by anyone outside their departments. Police unions and their political allies have worked to put special protections in place ensuring some records are shielded from public view, or even destroyed.\n\nReporters from USA TODAY, its 100-plus affiliated newsrooms and the nonprofit Invisible Institute in Chicago have spent more than a year creating the biggest collection of police misconduct records.\n\nObtained from thousands of state agencies, prosecutors, police departments and sheriffs, the records detail at least 200,000 incidents of alleged misconduct, much of it previously unreported. The records obtained include more than 110,000 internal affairs investigations by hundreds of individual departments and more than 30,000 officers who were decertified by 44 state oversight agencies.\n\nSearch for police discipline records USA TODAY Network has gathered discipline and accountability records on more than 85,000 law enforcement officers and has started releasing them to the public. The first collection published is a list of more than 30,000 officers who have been decertified, essentially banned from the profession, in 44 states. Search our exclusive database by officer, department or state. Search database\n\nAmong the findings:\n\nMost misconduct involves routine infractions, but the records reveal tens of thousands of cases of serious misconduct and abuse. They include 22,924 investigations of officers using excessive force, 3,145 allegations of rape, child molestation and other sexual misconduct and 2,307 cases of domestic violence by officers.\n\nDishonesty is a frequent problem. The records document at least 2,227 instances of perjury, tampering with evidence or witnesses or falsifying reports. There were 418 reports of officers obstructing investigations, most often when they or someone they knew were targets.\n\nLess than 10% of officers in most police forces get investigated for misconduct. Yet some officers are consistently under investigation. Nearly 2,500 have been investigated on 10 or more charges. Twenty faced 100 or more allegations yet kept their badge for years.\n\nThe level of oversight varies widely from state to state. Georgia and Florida decertified thousands of police officers for everything from crimes to questions about their fitness to serve; other states banned almost none.\n\nSearch the database: Exclusive USA TODAY list of decertified officers and their records\n\nTarnished Brass: Fired for a felony, again for perjury. Meet the new police chief.\n\nThat includes Maryland, home to the Baltimore Police Department, which regularly has been in the news for criminal behavior by police. Over nearly a decade, Maryland revoked the certifications of just four officers.\n\nShow caption Hide caption Tamika Staton leaves a message at a memorial in the middle of the road where teenager Michael Brown died after being shot by a police...

These officers have been placed on Brady lists, created to track officers whose actions must be disclosed to defendants if their testimony is relied upon to prosecute someone.\n\nUSA TODAY plans to publish many of those records to give the public an opportunity to examine their police department and the broader issue of police misconduct, as well as to help identify decertified officers who continue to work in law enforcement.\n\nSeth Stoughton, who worked as a police officer for five years and teaches law at the University of South Carolina, said expanding public access to those kinds of records is critical to keep good cops employed and bad cops unemployed.\n\nIf you think this is important journalism, please support us. Subscribe\n\n\u201cNo one is in a position to assess whether an officer candidate can do the job well and the way that we expect the job to be done better than the officer\u2019s former employer,\u201d Stoughton said.\n\n\u201cOfficers are public servants. They police in our name,\" he said. There is a \"strong public interest in identifying how officers are using their public authority.\u201d\n\nDan Hils, president of the Cincinnati Police Department\u2019s branch of the Fraternal Order of Policemen union, said people should consider there are more than 750,000 law enforcement officers in the country when looking at individual misconduct data.\n\n\u201cThe scrutiny is way tighter on police officers than most folks, and that\u2019s why sometimes you see high numbers of misconduct cases,\u201d Hils said. \u201cBut I believe that policemen tend to be more honest and more trustworthy than the average citizen.\u201d\n\nHils said he has no issue with USA TODAY publishing public records of conduct, saying it is the news media\u2019s \u201cright and responsibility to investigate police and the authority of government. You\u2019re supposed to be a watchdog.\u201d\n\nThe first set of records USA TODAY is releasing is an exclusive nationwide database of about 30,000 people whom state governments banned from the profession by revoking their certification to be law enforcement officers.\n\nFor years, a private police organization has assembled such a list from more than 40 states and encourages police agencies to screen new hires. The list is kept secret from anyone outside law enforcement.\n\nUSA TODAY obtained the names of banned officers from 44 states by filing requests under state sunshine laws.\n\nThe information includes the officers\u2019 names, the department they worked for when the state revoked their certification and \u2013 in most cases \u2013 the reasons why.\n\nThe list is incomplete because of the absence of records from states such as California, which has the largest number of law enforcement officers in the USA.\n\nBringing important facts to policing debate\n\nUSA TODAY's collection of police misconduct records comes amid a nationwide debate over law enforcement tactics, including concern that some officers or agencies unfairly target minorities.\n\nA series of killings of black people by police over the past five years in Ferguson, Missouri, Baltimore, Chicago, Sacramento, California, and elsewhere have sparked unrest and a reckoning that put pressure on cities and mayors to crack down on misconduct and abuses.\n\nThe Trump administration has backed away from more than a decade of Justice Department investigations and court actions against police departments it determined were deeply biased or corrupt.\n\nIn 2018, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the Justice Department would leave policing the police to local authorities, saying federal investigations hurt crime fighting.\n\nLaurie Robinson, co-chair of the 2014 White House Task Force on 21st Century Policing, said transparency about police conduct is critical to trust between police and residents.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about the people who you have hired to protect you,\u201d she said. \u201cTraditionally, we would say for sure that policing has not been a transparent entity in the U.S. Transparency is just a very key step along the way to repairing our relationships.\"\n\nHelp us investigate\n\nThe number of police agencies and officers in the USA is so large that the blind spots are vast. We need your help.\n\nThough the records USA TODAY Network gathered are probably the most expansive ever collected, there is much more to be added. The collection includes several types of statewide data, but most misconduct is documented by individual departments.\n\nJournalists obtained records from more than 700 law enforcement agencies, but the records are not complete for all of those agencies, and there are more than 18,000 police forces across the USA. The records requests were focused largely on the biggest 100 police agencies as well as clusters of smaller departments in surrounding areas, partly to examine movement of officers between departments in regions.\n\nShare your stories of police misconduct with us We want to hear from you if you believe you\u2019ve encountered misconduct by a law enforcement officer or agency.
