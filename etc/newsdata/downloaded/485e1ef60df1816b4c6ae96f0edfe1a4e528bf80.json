REUTERS/David Mercado\n\nAn elaborate ceremony was staged to mark what was supposed to be a crowning achievement in Morales\u2019 plan to make Bolivia a global foods supplier - entry to China\u2019s massive market just as Beijing shops around for alternatives to U.S. producers.\n\n\u201cThis is just another tool to ensure we continue growing economically,\u201d said Bolivia\u2019s first indigenous president, who often goes as \u201cEvo,\u201d at the Aug. 28 event. The country would send 8,000 tonnes of beef to China next year, he added.\n\nOn the outskirts of the city, however, the cost of a rapid increase in farming was clearly visible. Wildfires were raging, likely sparked by a rise in slash-and-burn land clearances for cattle ranching or soy farming.\n\nThe Bolivian fires, which mirror those burning across swathes of Brazil, threaten to derail Morales\u2019 bid for a fourth consecutive term in office and another five years of \u201cEvonomics,\u201d his brand of capitalism mixed with socialist state intervention.\n\nCritics link the fires to laws Morales has passed encouraging farmers and ranchers to settle in forested areas in recent years. That includes permission this year to use slash-and-burn methods to ramp up output despite a drought.\n\nThe scale of the fires is massive, threatening what is seen as a natural bulwark against climate change. In recent weeks, they have swept over 2.1 million hectares (5.2 mln acres) in land-locked Bolivia, an area almost the size of New Jersey, burning more than 700,000 hectares of forest in protected reserves, according to a report by local conservation group FAN.\n\nAnd they have drawn attention to Morales\u2019 newfound support for an industry once at odds with his government and put him on the defence ahead of the Oct. 20 election.\n\n\u201cBefore (the fires) it was going to be hard for him to find support from undecided voters. Now it\u2019s going to be much harder,\u201d said political analyst Marcelo Arequipa. \u201cIt\u2019s looking complicated for him.\u201d\n\n\u201cCOURSE OF HISTORY\u201d\n\nMorales\u2019 support for farming has surprised some. Unlike far-right President Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil, who has called climate change a hoax, Morales is known as a strident environmentalist abroad, often talking about the need to protect \u201cPachamama,\u201d or Mother Earth, in global forums.\n\nBut Morales is also keen to push for development and economic growth in Bolivia, one of South America\u2019s poorest countries. At home, his government is increasingly becoming known as an ally of farming and ranching interests, calling agricultural commodities the \u201cnew gold\u201d that will help diversify the economy away from Bolivia\u2019s key export, natural gas.\n\n\u201cThese fires might change the course of history,\u201d said La Paz-based political scientist Franklin Pareja. \u201cThey\u2019re so big they\u2019ve started to expose other things. For example, that this isn\u2019t just about giving opportunities to poor people but favouring agroindustrial corporate interests.\u201d\n\nAfter a wave of criticism over his government\u2019s initial slow response to the fires, Morales leapt into action late last month, hiring a Boeing SuperTanker to douse flames with water and joining firefighters battling them on the ground with hoses.\n\nMorales\u2019 chances of electoral success may now hinge on whether the outrage over the fires can be leveraged by main rival Carlos Mesa. Some recent opinion polls indicate Mesa could triumph in a potential second round run-off.\n\n\u201cThis is a national disaster,\u201d Mesa told local broadcaster Red Uno. \u201cWe know who caused this disaster, Evo Morales and his irresponsible land-use policies.\u201d\n\nThe government has denied its policies have fuelled the fires, calling it \u201ca lie\u201d and promising to invest whatever was necessary to re-grow the forests.\n\nMorales, once a coca farmer himself, placed the blame on periodic droughts that hit hard this year. \u201cIf you smoke a cigarette and toss it out it\u2019ll spark and there\u2019s a fire,\u201d Morales told ranchers at the ceremony in Santa Cruz last week.\n\nKILL THE GOLDEN GOOSE\n\nA decade ago, Morales was so despised in Santa Cruz he avoided the agriculture fair it hosts ever year. The traditionally conservative farming province feared his plans to break up large rural estates.\n\nBut he has become less unpopular among farmers since he announced a plan in 2013 to triple Bolivia\u2019s farm land to 13 million hectares by 2025 - a target some say is only possible by destroying large swathes of forest.\n\nA series of government pardons for illegal deforestation starting that year encouraged landless settlers to push deeper into the Amazon, which saw deforestation from farming doubling from 2014-2018, Bolivia\u2019s forest authority said in an April report.\n\nMorales, South America\u2019s longest-serving left-leaning president, has also backed infrastructure projects such as a $580 million Chinese highway project and a proposed transcontinental railway to Peru\u2019s Pacific coast.\n\nThis year, Morales passed a rule to encourage more soy exports and, at the start of the dry season, authorized land clearings in Amazonian provinces now raging with fires.\n\nAgricultural business leaders said those measures were necessary to support industry, and urged Morales not to cede to demands to clamp down on the sector, despite the fires.\n\n\u201cThe laws were well thought out and... should not be repealed,\u201d said Oscar Pereyra, the president of a major cattle-growing association in Bolivia. \u201cWe can\u2019t kill the \u2018goose that lays the golden eggs\u2019 of the agricultural industry.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (10 Images)\n\nBut environmentalists and many locals fear that rampant deforestation and fires will have knock-on effects on the environment.\n\n\u201cEvery time I go out... I see new land clearings, whether for livestock or soy,\u201d said Robert Flock, a Catholic Bishop in the Santa Cruz region. \u201cThat means more drought.\u201d", "description": "In the tropical Bolivian city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, a wealthy farming hub on the edge on the Amazon rainforest, President Evo Morales gathered with ranchers late last month to celebrate a maiden shipment of beef to China.", "authors": ["Monica Machicao", "Daniel Ramos", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1427826277&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF880CB", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
