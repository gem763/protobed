Morgan Chase's stock drops after Buckingham backs away from bullish call", "language": "en", "text": "Shares of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, +1.97% fell 1.4% in premarket trading Monday, after the banking giant was downgraded by Buckingham Research analyst James Mitchell, who cited concerns over valuation. Mitchell said J.P. Morgan has produced \"best-in-class\" revenue growth and returns in recent years, and considering significant investment spend and management's record of successful execution, he sees no reason why these trends won't continue. However, he cut his rating to neutral from buy, saying that after \"materially outpacing the peer group in recent years,\" the stock now trades at nearly a 30% premium, which leads him to believe \"much of the fundamental outperformance is being priced in.\" The stock has gained 5.9% over the past 12 months through Friday, while the SPDR Financial Select Sector ETF XLF, +0.78% has edged up 0.9% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.14% has tacked on 4.1%.", "description": "Shares of J.P.
