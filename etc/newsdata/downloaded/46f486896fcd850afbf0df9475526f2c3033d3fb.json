REUTERS/Hannah McKay/File Photo\n\nSharif, 69, a three-time prime minister, is serving a seven-year jail sentence after a conviction for corruption last year. He denied the charges that he said were politically motivated.\n\nHe was taken to hospital in the city of Lahore on Monday and his party, the Pakistan Muslim League - Nawaz, PML-N, has raised concern about what it says is his alarmingly low platelet count.\n\n\u201cHe has undergone several scans and tests and doctors are still trying to find the cause,\u201d the party\u2019s deputy secretary general, Atta Tarar, told Reuters.\n\nThe government has dismissed party complaints about Sharif\u2019s treatment saying he is getting the attention he needs. It said Sharif had a low platelet count that might have been caused by medication he is taking.\n\nBut the party\u2019s secretary for information, Maryam Aurangzeb, condemned what she called a \u201cdeliberate delay\u201d in Sharif\u2019s move to hospital and in his treatment.\n\n\u201cThe government is crossing all limits of political victimisation against PML-N and the Sharif family,\u201d Aurangzeb said.\n\nThe government of Prime Minister Imran Khan denies that the legal action against Sharif and other members of his family including elder daughter Maryam Nawaz, who is also in detention for suspected graft, is politically motivated.\n\nThe provincial government has said Sharif could be sent abroad for treatment, as his party has suggested, if a court allowed it.\n\nMaryam, who recently assumed leadership of the party and was detained in August on suspected corruption, was allowed to visit her father in hospital late on Wednesday.\n\nHer medical condition is also poor, party officials say.\n\n\u201cMaryam Nawaz who was also admitted to the same hospital last night for medical reasons has been sent back to jail early Thursday,\u201d Aurangzeb said.\n\n\u201cIt also speaks of the government\u2019s ruthlessness.\u201d\n\nMaryam, who led big anti-government rallies across the country this year, is one of the few opposition figures to openly criticise Khan and the powerful military, accusing them of stifling her party\u2019s political activity.\n\nSharif\u2019s younger daughter, Asma Nawaz, was travelling back to Pakistan from abroad to see her father, said another party official.\n\n\u201cShe is deeply concerned about her father\u2019s health,\u201d the official, Azma Bukhari, told Reuters.\n\nTop officials of the other main opposition party have also been detained on suspicion of corruption.\n\nFormer President Asif Ali Zardari, widower of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, was arrested by the anti-graft agency in June.\n\nOfficials of his Pakistan People\u2019s Party say his detention is government persecution. The government denies involvement in the case.", "description": "Pakistan's main opposition party said on Thursday the health of its leader, jailed former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, is deteriorating and the government is victimising him by delaying treatment as part of a campaign against him and his family.", "authors": ["Mubasher Bukhari", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444409356&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N0H4", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
