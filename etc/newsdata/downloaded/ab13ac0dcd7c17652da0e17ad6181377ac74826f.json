But in her constituency of Don Valley, which she has represented for 22 years, that decision seems unlikely to be a costly one.\n\nExplaining her decision, Flint revealed a stark statistic: in the mining villages in this part of South Yorkshire, she wrote in the Sunday Times, 80% of voters backed leave in 2016 (over the whole constituency the figure was 68%). Parliament has not been listening to these people, she wrote: \u201cThe voices in our mining villages remain unheard, despite their support for Labour over many decades.\u201d\n\nIn Denaby Main, the most deprived of all the pit villages in Don Valley, where a three-bed terrace can cost about \u00a380,000, Flint\u2019s move was warmly received by voters on both sides of the debate. At the Dearne Valley leisure centre, built on top of the colliery after it was filled in back in 1986, Bob Davis broke into superlatives at the mere mention of her name.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Denaby Main in the Don Valley constituency, South Yorkshire.

She has listened to her constituents, it\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d said the 75-year-old, who set up his own engineering firm after his father forbade his son following him down the mine. Davis, who voted remain \u201cto keep my children happy\u201d, would vote out now: \u201cIt would be an insult to me to run a second referendum. I believe strongly in democracy.\u201d\n\nWaiting for his children to finish swimming, Andrew Hampson, 42, said he too voted remain but thought the UK should now probably leave the EU. A former advertising executive who swapped his City job to move to Yorkshire and become a cabinet maker, he thought the remain lobby were still scaremongering. \u201cIt\u2019s like with the Y2k crisis,\u201d he said, referring to the experts who warned that a computer bug was projected to create havoc at the beginning of the year 2000. \u201cI just don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be a disaster.\u201d\n\nYet he questioned exactly what Boris Johnson\u2019s deal really meant: \u201cI think he\u2019s left it purposefully vague. I do worry what Boris has agreed and I think it\u2019s nowhere near what a lot of people wanted.\u201d Many people wanted a real change in immigration policy, he said, particularly in the former coalfields in the north of England: \u201cI know plenty of liberal Guardian readers who will disagree, but the only reason for having immigration is to keep labour costs down. Working people get castigated for saying that, but it\u2019s true.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Plasterer Martin Lawton at Denaby Main in South Yorkshire.

It should be stricter,\u201d he said, saying that he charges \u00a315 an hour but had been undercut by eastern Europeans happy to work for the minimum wage.\n\nThough she campaigned for remain in the referendum, Flint has become increasingly outspoken against the EU. \u201cWhen it comes to workers\u2019 rights, the EU isn\u2019t God,\u201d she told the Commons on Saturday. \u201cThe fact is local authorities up and down the UK have to outsource contracts to the European Union at the detriment of workers in their local communities. We have seen a rise of zero-hours contracts and poor conditions partly because of that outsourcing.\u201d\n\nBadmouthing the EU is unlikely to lose her many votes. A petition to deselect Flint gained just 178 signatures and she was reselected by her constituency party last week. But her seat is not safe: her majority fell to 5,169 at the last election, down from 14,659 when she was first elected in the 1997 Tony Blair landslide. And in the 2019 European elections, the Brexit party topped the poll in Doncaster with 30,016 votes, with Labour a distant second on 11,393.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Colin Rufus of the Stars in Our Eyes charity.

Colin Rufus, who helps run Stars in Our Eyes, a charity that puts on talent shows, said he would now vote remain: \u201cWe were lied to. I voted on the understanding that however many millions each week would go to the NHS. And no one told me there would be a border in Ireland.\u201d\n\nFlint should be campaigning for another referendum, he insisted. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, she voted against what Labour people want. We want another go at it.\u201d", "description": "In leave-voting former pit villages, many agree with the MP\u2019s decision to support Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal", "authors": ["Helen Pidd"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe226c2b8b38db116d23437d7afc6e79529e9eb5/0_136_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=093f9c39c47117d0aabcee35eb11e931", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
