She said that \u201cprayer is a power of the mind and it is neither bizarre nor unintelligent.\u201d She also said that millions of other people are praying that Dorian doesn\u2019t hit land and that people mocking those prayers is part of the reason why the \u201cLeft\u201d has lost voters.\n\nSo far, Hurricane Dorian appears to be avoiding much of Florida and has not done the damage it was initially anticipated to do to the state. The storm is now moving northwest at 8 mph and is currently on Georgia\u2019s southeastern coast, approximately 150 miles south of Charleston S.C.\n\nWrite to Josiah Bates at josiah.bates@time.com.", "description": "Marianne Williamson seemed to post and then delete a tweet about Hurricane Dorian, saying the \"power of mind\" may have moved the storm.", "authors": ["Josiah Bates"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/dem-debate-june27-08.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}
