'It's the opinion of the national manager. He made a selection, he's decided the last two times.\n\n'Kyle respects it, I respect it. He does what's best for the national team. My opinion of Kyle doesn't change. He remains a top full back.\n\n'It's big challenge for him to show the England manager how good he is. We've always got a challenge in sport. We have targets and he has one in front of him in every single game.\n\nGareth Southgate picked Trent Alexander-Arnold and Kieran Trippier for the upcoming ties\n\n'He came here (from Tottenham) as an outstanding player and he still is. His physicality is strong, he's fast and we try to help him to be a better player.\n\n'I don't have doubts about Kyle. We needed competition for him and let him rest. Maybe when Joao plays in a good level, (then he can) take his position. That's how it is.'\n\nWalker, 29, still has the shirt at City and is expected to get the nod against Wolves on Sunday. Kevin De Bruyne will miss out through injury in midfield.\n\nWalker remains a first-team starter at City though Joao Cancelo was brought in to challenge\n\nGuardiola revealed Cancelo is beginning to adapt to his team's way of playing after starts against Preston and Dinamo Zagreb.\n\n'He has made a step forward,' the City boss added. 'He arrived late, not in the pre-season, and what he did with a previous team was completely different.\n\n'He's getting better. We don't have doubts with the ball and he's beginning to understand what we want without it.'", "description": "Pep Guardiola\u00a0insisted Kyle Walker will bounce back after his second omission from the England squad - but warned Joao Cancelo is breathing down his neck at Manchester City.", "authors": ["Jack Gaughan For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/13/19297022-0-image-a-6_1570193661149.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
