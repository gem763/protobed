You remain on the same bail as before.\u201d\n\nIn her written judgment, Judge Arbuthnot said she agreed with the Azerbaijani government\u2019s claim and added that there was evidence of Ms Hajiyeva\u2019s \u201cpart in the alleged conspiracy\u201d.\n\nShe added: \u201cThere is evidence from which dishonesty could be inferred. I find there is sufficient evidence of conspiracy to defraud.\u201d\n\nJudge Arbuthnot also found that there was very little evidence provided by the defence that the case against Ms Hajiyeva in Azerbaijan was \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d.\n\nShe added: \u201cI have concluded that the request is in fact not made for the purpose of prosecuting Ms Hajiyeva on account of her political opinions.\n\n\u201cIt is being made because her husband defrauded the bank of a large amount of money over a lengthy period of time in a dishonest conspiracy involving many others.\u201d\n\nBut the judge said that there was a \u201creal risk\u201d that Ms Hajiyeva\u2019s trial will suffer a \u201cflagrant denial of justice\u201d.\n\nShe added: \u201cI find that the combination of a judiciary which is not independent of the executive, lawyers who are punished if they take on cases of interest to the state, the approach of the court and the authorities to Mr Hajiyev\u2019s trial, all lead me to conclude that there is a real risk that Ms Hajiyeva whose case is high-profile and sensitive and not a \u2018normal\u2019 criminal case will suffer a flagrant denial of justice.\n\n\u201cThe assurance from the requesting state that she will receive a fair trial is not sufficient to relieve the many serious concerns the court has.\n\n\u201cI find that Ms Hajiyeva\u2019s extradition is not compatible with Convention rights within the meaning of the Human Rights Act and under section 87(2) of the EA 2003 I discharge her.\u201d\n\nBen Keith, representing the Azerbaijani government said: \u201cWe will likely appeal this case.\u201d\n\nA statement issued by Ms Hajiyeva\u2019s lawyers said: \u201cWe welcome the decision of the senior district judge today which confirms that our client, Ms Hajiyeva, will not be extradited to Azerbaijan.\n\n\u201cThere is much more that we would like to say but given ongoing proceedings in respect of other matters and the possibility that the Azeri government may appeal, we will not be making any further comment at this stage.\n\n\u201cWhilst we understand the interest in this case we ask that the press please respect her family\u2019s right to privacy.\u201d\n\nIn separate proceedings, two UWOs have been granted against Ms Hajiyeva as a High Court judge found she spent more than \u00a316m in Harrods between September 2006 and June 2016.\n\nShe was targeted by the National Crime Agency when so-called McMafia anti-corruption laws came into force last year.\n\nUK authorities want to know how she and her husband could afford to buy an \u00a311.5m Knightsbridge house a few minutes\u2019 walk from Harrods and a \u00a310.5m golf club in Ascot, Berkshire.\n\nWhen Ms Hajiyeva unsuccessfully attempted to overturn one of the UWOs in October, her lawyers claimed her husband\u2019s conviction was the result of a \u201cshow trial\u201d and that his guilt \u201chad been determined by the presidential administration in advance\u201d.\n\nThey also said the UWO was part of an investigative process, not a criminal procedure, and did not involve the finding of any criminal offence.\n\nMs Hajiyeva was granted permission to appeal against the High Court\u2019s decision by the Court of Appeal.\n\nThe PA news agency understands she has launched an appeal which will be heard in December.\n\nPress Association", "description": "The woman at the centre of the UK\u2019s first so-called McMafia order will not be extradited back to Azerbaijan to face fraud and embezzlement charges.
