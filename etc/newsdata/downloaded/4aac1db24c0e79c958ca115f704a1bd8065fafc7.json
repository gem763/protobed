Experts say increasingly violent storms and rising sea levels are already having an impact on the island nation.\n\nAustralia\u2019s Great Barrier Reef is dying An athlete swims near Australia's Great Barrier Reef on April 12, 2018.

Scientists say warming waters are what pose the greatest threat to the system, last year causing a \"mass bleaching event\" that \"cooked\" it, BBC News reports. And coral is struggling to regrow.
