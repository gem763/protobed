He has today been admitted to hospital and this office will not be making any further comments'.\n\nThe Commons Standards Committee eviscerated his reputation in their damning report published yesterday.\n\nThe MPs said there was 'compelling evidence' the veteran Labour politician, one of the most prominent figures in the party for years, had paid for sex during an encounter with two men in August 2016 and 'expressed a willingness' to purchase the Class A drug.\n\nIn a scathing report, it accused Mr Vaz, the former chairman of the home affairs committee, of trying to 'throw dust in the eyes' of the parliamentary authorities with his implausible explanations.\n\nKeith Vaz spotted at Heathrow Airport three days ago - he is now said to be in hospital\n\nMr Vaz denied offering to buy cocaine for a Romanian rent boy despite audio recordings by the Sunday Mirror - and said he had amnesia because his drink was spiked - MPs said his explanation was 'ludicrous'\n\nThe committee said his claims including that he had met the men to discuss painting and decorating and that his drink may have been spiked were 'not believable and, indeed, ludicrous'.\n\nThe shaming of Keith Vaz: What the damning report found about his night with rent boys Former Europe minister Keith Vaz, 62, committed a 'very serious breach' of code of conduct for MPs, said the House of Commons Standards Committee. The Sunday Mirror reported in September 2016 that Vaz, posing as an industrial washing machine salesman called Jim, invited two male prostitutes into his flat to engage in paid-for sex and offered to pay for cocaine for another man to use. Married with two children, Vaz, who was born in Aden to a family from Goa, has been the MP for the central England seat of Leicester East since 1987. 'I found Mr Vaz's account of the events that led to the media reports incredible,' said Kathryn Stone, the parliamentary commissioner for standards. 'I found his reason for being unable to assist me fully with my inquiry implausible.' The standards committee said his explanation that the men were there to discuss redecorating the London flat, and that he may have been given a 'spiked drink', was 'not believable and, indeed, ludicrous'. The committee concluded: That Mr Vaz's explanation of the incident on August 27 2016 is not believable;\n\nThat on this occasion Mr Vaz expressed a willingness to procure a Class A drug, cocaine, for the use of another person;\n\nThat on this occasion Mr Vaz engaged in paid-for sex.\n\nIt also questioned Mr Vaz's suggestion he could not remember what had happened because he had amnesia \u2013 as he did not mention this until four months into an investigation by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards.\n\nThe committee found Mr Vaz had committed a 'very serious' breach of the code of conduct for MPs. It said that by failing to co-operate fully with the Commons inquiry process, Mr Vaz had shown 'disrespect for the House's standards system' and caused 'significant damage' to the reputation and integrity of the Commons.\n\nThe report marks a spectacular fall from grace for Mr Vaz, who is renowned for his love of publicity.\n\nAfter entering Parliament as the MP for Leicester East in 1987, he became a prominent figure in the party and served as a junior minister under Tony Blair.\n\nMr Vaz was previously suspended from the Commons for one month in 2002 after the standards and privileges committee found he had recklessly made a damaging and untrue allegation against a former police officer who had made a complaint about him.\n\nMPs will now vote in the coming days on whether to accept the committee's recommendation that Mr Vaz be suspended for six months and that he face a recall petition that will lead to a by-election if 10 per cent of his constituents sign. However, he will be allowed to stand again if a general election is called in the meantime.\n\nAn investigation was launched into Mr Vaz after a Sunday newspaper reported he had met two men in his London flat to engage in paid-for sex in August 2016.\n\nIn the course of the encounter \u2013which was covertly audio-recorded by one of the men \u2013 Mr Vaz was said to have offered to buy illegal drugs for a third person to use.\n\nThe committee said the three-year investigation could have been concluded earlier if the MP had given a 'candid and co-operative account' from the outset.\n\nThe Commissioner for Standards, who produced a report for the committee, challenged Mr Vaz's claim he had not knowingly met the men before that evening.\n\nShe concluded: 'The recording reveals Mr Vaz has prior knowledge of the personal circumstances of the two men, as well as references to the 'last time' they met.'\n\nOn Mr Vaz's claim he had amnesia, the Commissioner said: 'I find it very surprising that he did not say from the start that he had no memory of the events in question.'\n\nA statement on Mr Vaz's website last night said he had been treated for a 'serious mental-health condition' as a result of the events of August 2016. 'He has nothing further to say on this matter,' the statement said.\n\nThe shaming of Keith Vaz: A sordid saga of sex and drugs - and a disgraceful bid to wriggle off the hook\n\nParty animal: Keith Vaz pictured with a belly dancer at the 2009 Labour Conference\n\nAccording to Keith Vaz, that night with the two rent boys was all a dreadful misunderstanding.\n\nThe young escorts he had invited to his flat with the words 'We need to get this party started' were, in fact, professional decorators.\n\nThey had kindly dropped round at 11.30pm on a Saturday evening 'to discuss interior d\u00e9cor' in his apartment and, because he was a busy MP, this was the only time he could meet them.\n\nSo begins the former chairman of the Commons' home affairs select committee's explanation for the sordid night three years ago when he paid two male prostitutes for sex and offered to buy cocaine for a third.\n\nYesterday, the married father-of-two's explanation was branded 'frankly ludicrous' by the Commons' standards committee.\n\nIn an excoriating 69-page report, they demolished the former Labour grandee's lies, obfuscation and desperate attempts to escape censure.\n\nAnd they revealed that, when Mr Vaz's absurd claims about the decorators began to unravel, he resorted to pleading amnesia.\n\nThe committee said paid-for sex between consenting adults was not illegal, but Mr Vaz's attempts to mislead the inquiry brought shame on him.\n\nCall me Jim\n\nThe inquiry by the standards commissioner concerned the evening of August 27, 2016, at a well-appointed \u00a3400,000 Edgware flat belonging to Mr Vaz, a 10-minute walk from his \u00a32.2million marital home.\n\nAs the rent boys undressed, one of them asked his name and the MP for Leicester East replied 'Jim', telling his Eastern European guests he was a washing machine repair man.\n\nAlas, the ruse was pointless because they were fully aware of his true identity and one of them was secretly recording the proceedings on his phone for the Sunday Mirror newspaper.\n\nEight days later, it published its expose, including extracts of the home affairs chairman \u2013 whose committee was tasked with monitoring crime, immigration and drugs policy on behalf of the nation \u2013 discussing illegal drugs, unprotected sex and money. He resigned as chairman days later.\n\nOnly now has Mr Vaz's 'implausible' version of events been made public, after the commissioner's inquiry finished and her findings were endorsed by the Commons' standards committee which published a report yesterday.\n\nIt tells how the MP insisted he and his wife had planned an 'ambitious' renovation at their house and needed to quickly refurbish the flat to serve as their temporary home.\n\nThe MP's wife of 26 years, Maria Fernandes, revealed in an interview with the Mail a week after the story broke how he had begged her for forgiveness. Mr Vaz and his wife Maria are pictured above in September 2016, a day after the revelations broke\n\nBecause of his crowded diary of engagements \u2013 which included a football match and a birthday party \u2013 he could not meet the 'decorators' until late in the evening on Saturday August 27.\n\nOn the Sunday Mirror's tape, Mr Vaz can allegedly be heard calling one of the men 'a naughty b****r', and informing him: 'I'm getting very horny.'\n\nYesterday the committee concluded: 'The notion that the men were at Mr Vaz's flat in connection with painting and decorating is incredible. The recording contains no evidence of any conversation about \u2026decorating.'\n\nPaid for sex\n\nCommissioner Kathryn Stone said: 'Mr Vaz has told me he has never paid for sex. Sexual activity took place...I believe Mr Vaz paid for that activity.'\n\nMr Vaz and his visitors reminisced about other prostitutes including one who 'forgot the condom', with the MP recalling: 'I had to f*** him without a condom.'\n\nThe report said: 'No reasonable person who has listened to the audio recording could believe his claim that the purpose of the two men's visit was to discuss interior decoration. Mr Vaz's claims \u2026 are, frankly, ludicrous.'\n\nDrugs\n\nAs the trio waited for a third rent boy \u2013 a Romanian \u2013 Mr Vaz offered to buy him cocaine, the report found.\n\nThe MP \u2013 who in 2010 demanded action against the 'dangerous' cocaine trade \u2013 said he did not want any but would be willing to pay for the Romanian to have some, the tape revealed.\n\nThe report said: 'The men can be heard discussing 'poppers', 'weed' and 'coke'. Mr Vaz was the first to mention 'coke' that evening.'\n\nIn 2016, the Met examined the case but did not to take any action. Mr Vaz told the commissioner the recording could not be relied on and insisted he had never taken drugs.\n\nAmnesia\n\nInitially, Mr Vaz tried to dismiss the Sunday Mirror's investigation as bearing 'no relation to what actually occurred'.\n\nBut when asked by the commissioner what had really occurred, he pleaded amnesia. He claimed his drink must have been spiked.\n\nThe inquiry said the one-hour-40-minute recording proved he had not been incapacitated, as he spoke freely to the prostitutes.\n\nThe report said: 'He knew about their pet dog, the study plans of one of the men, their travels and their overdraft. These are not the details most people would know about their decorators.'\n\nThe commissioner found it 'extremely puzzling' that Mr Vaz did not wheel out his amnesia claims until later in the inquiry.\n\nShe added that the fact Mr Vaz was calling himself a false name also undermined his claims.\n\nHis wife\n\nThe MP's wife of 26 years, Maria Fernandes, revealed in an interview with the Mail a week after the story broke how he had begged her for forgiveness \u2013 contradicting Mr Vaz's claims he had not spoken to her, said the standards commissioner, who added: 'Mr Vaz's wife said that she said she had had no inkling that her husband enjoyed sex with men. The article said Mr Vaz had told his wife 'something was going to break [in a newspaper], that it was bad...While he did not go into detail, he did concede \u2013 to his wife's incredulity \u2013 that his infidelity involved men'.'\n\nHis excuses\n\nThe report said Mr Vaz 'has done himself no favours by his inability to provide a single, consistent, plausible account.'\n\nIt revealed the lengths he went to 'throw dust in the eyes of the commissioner and the committee', adding he 'has done his best to complicate, obfuscate and confuse the inquiry'.\n\nThe MP claimed he was the victim of conmen and produced a 'dossier' of claims about the rent boys, including that one had a 'conviction for littering from a vehicle'. This was rejected as irrelevant.\n\nHe claimed the Sunday Mirror's tape was 'doctored' but an independent expert found it was not.\n\nHe complained he was the victim of 'entrapment'. But the committee said the sting had not 'fostered' Mr Vaz's misconduct, but rather had exposed it.\n\nThe report said: 'There is no evidence to suggest that Mr Vaz was being steered in directions he was unwilling to go.'\n\nThe committee said it was 'difficult, to put it mildly' to accept his excuses. It said the inquiry could have been finished long ago if he had told the truth.", "description": "The Leicester East MP revealed his admission to hospital shortly after a three-year inquiry found he had breached parliamentary rules and recommended he be suspended for six months.", "authors": ["Martin Robinson", "Chief Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/07/20314318-0-image-a-9_1572334682027.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
