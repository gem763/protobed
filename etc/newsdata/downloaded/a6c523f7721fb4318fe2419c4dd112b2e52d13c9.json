Sondland testified last week, and also said leveraging military aid would be wrong.\n\nSeveral other witnesses have already testified in the investigation, which is trying to determine if Trump withheld the aid to pressure Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. Joe Biden is a Democratic candidate for president next year. Trump has acknowledged withholding the aid, temporarily, and pressing Zelensky for a Biden investigation, but has maintained the two were never connected. Sondland also made that clear in his text messages to Taylor.\n\nWhite House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said last week Trump withheld the aid because of concerns about corruption in the Ukrainian government, not to pressure for an investigation of the Bidens.\n\nHouse Democrats will look to Taylor to corroborate the claims.\n\nPhil Reeker, the acting official at the State Department for European and Eurasian affairs, and Michael Duffey, associate director for national security programs at the Office of Management and Budget, will testify on Wednesday. Thursday, two Pentagon officials will appear to discuss military aid to Ukraine.\n\nThe White House has said it will not cooperate with the impeachment inquiry until the full House votes to approve the investigation.", "description": "Oct. 21 (UPI) \u2014 Acting U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor is among the Trump administration officials scheduled to testify in the House this", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
