Beijing said in September that he had been formally arrested on suspicion of spying.\n\nChina also detained six Japanese citizens in 2017 for alleged \"illegal activities\".\n\nSince 2015, at least 13 Japanese citizens -- all civilians -- have been detained in China on various charges including espionage, Kyodo News and the Asahi Shimbun reported.\n\nTokyo's ties with Beijing have been at times strained by rows over history and territorial disputes but have been improving recently, with Xi expected to visit Japan early next year.\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "Chinese authorities have detained a Japanese man in Beijing, a government spokesman in Tokyo confirmed Monday, following media reports that a university professor was being held on suspicion of spying. \"The Japanese embassy in China confirmed that a Japanese man in his 40s was detained by Chinese authorities in Beijing\u2026", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://japantoday.com/images/japan-today-social.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
