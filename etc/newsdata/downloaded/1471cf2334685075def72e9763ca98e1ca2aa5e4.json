'Uncivilised' owners would be discredited (file photo)\n\nChinese people are still learning to appreciate dogs as life companions - whether they own dogs or not.\n\nIn addition, many people are unaware of the responsibility that comes with a dog.\n\nSome of the most frequent complaints against pet dogs in China are that they are noisy, they bite people and their owners don't clean after them.\n\nAlso last year, the government of Wenshan, a city in Yunnan Province, banned its residents from walking dogs from 7am to 10pm as part of official efforts to 'improve residents' living conditions and maintain public safety'.\n\nThe move sparked a heated debate on the country's social media platforms.\n\nWhile some citizens strongly opposed the ban, others expressed their support citing security and hygiene concerns.\n\nWenshan authorities defended the ordinance following the outcry, saying this is a precautionary measure that must be taken.", "description": "The government of Shenzhen has drafted a law to prohibit residents from using leads longer than 20 inches while walking dog that are heavier than 24 pounds.", "authors": ["Tracy You For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/17/19694490-0-image-a-110_1571070578314.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
