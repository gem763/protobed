Birds of Prey puts Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn centre stage", "language": "en", "text": "Who needs Batman, the Joker, or indeed the other members of the Birds of Prey, when you have Harley Quinn? That seems to be the position taken by Cathy Yan, director of Margot Robbie\u2019s sophomore turn as Gotham City\u2019s lovable queen of crime. The debut trailer for Birds of Prey (And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn) focuses in hard on Robbie, with barely a glimpse of the other members of the DC ensemble: Mary Elizabeth Winstead\u2019s Huntress, Jurnee Smollett-Bell\u2019s Black Canary and Ella Jay Basco\u2019s Cassandra Cain.\n\nBatman and the Joker are missing, perhaps because Warner Bros has pretty much given up an integrated DC Extended Universe to focus, instead, on releasing quality individual efforts free from a wider web of saga-building. The last Batman encountered by Quinn, Ben Affleck, has been retired in favour of a new caped crusader for the forthcoming The Batman, to be played by Robert Pattinson. And it\u2019s hard to argue that this isn\u2019t for the best given the dark knight chose to punch out Robbie before snogging her back to life in 2016\u2019s ill-fated Suicide Squad.\n\nMeanwhile, the Australian actor\u2019s most recent screen partner as Mr J, the much underused Jared Leto, appears highly unlikely to return to in the role. It\u2019s not yet clear if Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s version of the clown prince of Gotham City will be back for further DC adventures after his fantabulous debut in Todd Phillips\u2019s Joker, so it probably makes sense to omit the supervillain while Warner works out where to go next. The only mention of Quinn\u2019s squeeze in the new trailer is a dismissive one: our (anti) heroine has split up with her partner in crime, and it appears it was not an easy break-up given that she is aiming darts at a mock-up of his features.\n\nAnd so we have a movie that places Robbie front and centre, just as Suicide Squad tried to do, despite that movie also ostensibly being an ensemble effort.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Achieving decent box office \u2026 Suicide Squad (2016).

Warner Bros knows the Robbie-Quinn combo is a thing of twisted splendour \u2013 that this spiky, tragic Gotham dame is its DC diamond in the rough. Dismissed by the critics and ruined by over-zealous studio interference in its edit, Suicide Squad nonetheless zoomed to a more than decent $746.8m (\u00a3600m) at the global box office, presumably largely the result of those zippy trailers with Robbie taking centre stage.\n\nWill she repeat the trick in Birds of Prey? Or will the other characters move to the fore in the final movie? Will Quinn be a Raymond Chandleresque narrator throughout? Or will Yan opt for a cheeky switcheroo in the final cut? Warner has a habit of making unreliable trailers, so it\u2019s hard to tell.\n\nSuicide Squad preferred wacky visuals over characterisation, and while Robbie had more screen time than her bad-guy counterparts we never really got under her skin. So it\u2019s unsurprising that Birds of Prey seems poised to give us the Harley Quinn movie fans have longed to see ever since her promo for Suicide Squad. Yet there has to be more to Birds of Prey, or why wouldn\u2019t Warner just title this one after its leading figure?\n\nMuch will come down to Ewan McGregor\u2019s Black Mask: not the most infamous of Batman supervillains in print, nor the most widely known. But cinema can shake up comic book hierarchies with deft casting and charismatic performances. Still, McGregor will have to grab Quinn\u2019s trademark baseball bat and knock this one out of the park if he is to convince audiences that the Joker and his fellow Gotham miscreants are best left lurking in the shadows.", "description": "Gotham City\u2019s lovable crime queen is bigged up in Cathy Yan\u2019s forthcoming movie, leaving Batman and co in the shade", "authors": ["Ben Child"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4e27ae189c30eb0d1264fd6d908ceb4d25f54c9/282_0_1292_775/master/1292.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=983ffb0ff18c751feec38db8ea853e36", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
