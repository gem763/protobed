After graduating high school, Senior came briefly to Canada as a Commonwealth Scholar to attend Carleton University in Ottawa. But it wasn't until the early 1990s that the prolific writer settled in Toronto full-time.\n\nSenior has published 18 books of fiction, nonfiction, poetry and children's literature, including Summer Lightning and Other Stories, Over the Roofs of the World, and The Pain Tree. Her work has been translated into several languages worldwide and has won many awards for her work, including the Commonwealth Writers' Prize, the OCM Bocas Prize for Caribbean Literature and F.J. Bressani Literary Prize.\n\nOlive Senior told the audience in Halifax's Central Library: 'this is the scariest thing I\u2019ve ever done' before starting her Margaret Laurence Lecture.

She chose Pablo Neruda, a Nobel Prize-winning Chilean poet who was also a diplomat and politician.
