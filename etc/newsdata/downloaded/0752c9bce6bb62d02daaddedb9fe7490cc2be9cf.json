I\u2019m not asking for a pardon. I\u2019m not asking for a pass. What I\u2019m asking for is a fair trial.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what the former National Security Agency contractor told CBS News in an interview that aired Monday on \u201cCBS This Morning.\u201d Snowden has been living in exile in Russia since leaking classified information about the government\u2019s mass surveillance of U.S. citizens in 2013.\n\n\u201cI would like to return to the United States,\u201d Snowden told CBS. \u201cThat is the ultimate goal. But if I\u2019m gonna spend the rest of my life in prison, the one bottom line demand that we have to agree to is that at least I get a fair trial. And that is the one thing the government has refused to guarantee because they won\u2019t provide access to what\u2019s called a public interest defense.\u201d\n\nThat type of defense would allow a jury to consider Snowden\u2019s motivations, which he says the government opposes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not hard to make the argument that I broke the law,\u201d he admitted to CBS, but said the government has not shown how his leaks caused harm. \u201cThey never show evidence for it even though we\u2019re now more than six years on, it would be the easiest thing in the world to show.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, the Wall Street Journal reported that the NSA was considering shutting down the once-secret surveillance program that he exposed because it lacks operational value.\n\nIn a separate interview aired Monday on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cThe 11th Hour\u201d with Brian Williams, Snowden said he was trying to \u201creform,\u201d not destroy, the NSA.\n\nSnowden, now a privacy advocate, added that he was alarmed by how governments and companies can now access vast amounts of personal data through digital devices such as cell phones.\n\n\u201cAnything you can do on that device, the attacker \u2060\u2014 in this case, the government \u2060\u2014 can do,\u201d Snowden told MSNBC. \u201cThey can read your e-mail, they can collect every document, they can look at your contact book, they can turn the location services on.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey can see anything that is on that phone instantly,\u201d he said, \u201cand send it back home to the mothership.\u201d\n\nNot coincidentally, Snowden has a new memoir, \u201cPermanent Record,\u201d coming out Tuesday.", "description": "\u201cI would like to return to the United States,\u201d Snowden told CBS News. \u201cThat is the ultimate goal.\u201d", "authors": ["Mike Murphy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HD731_snowde_ZG_20190211133058.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
