Top is secure and leakproof. Washes easily and the purple color is great. I love to get more.......\n\nRated 4 out of 5 by SonyaK from Doesn\u2019t close all the way It\u2019s a good looking tumbler but it doesn\u2019t close all the way and the contents easily spill. Very annoying.\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by Czarina from Love My Yeti I received my Yeti Tumbler as a gift and love the fact that it keeps the ice cubes frozen all day on the beach.\n\nRated 2 out of 5 by fred b from DON'T LET IT FALL OVER!! Purchased a Rambler 20 oz. tumbler to replace a Contico mug that we had lost. I bought it based on Yeti's reputation for making a quality product. While it does keep the coffee hot longer, it leaks if it falls over or is tipped when full. I would think Yeti could come up with a better lid that would not leak. Our Contico mug did not leak and did a pretty good job of keeping the coffee hot.\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by Finnmurph from Yeti always delivers We have many yeti products and give them often as gifts. They always deliver as promised and the quality is fantastic. Well done.\n\nRated 4 out of 5 by Sunrise61 from Best Available Tumbler to Keep Beverages Cold I utilize my tumbler for cold drinks on a daily basis. I purchased two accessories (the straw and lid combo and the handle) for this tumbler to create a custom container that suits my needs. This tumbler does a good job of keeping my water and ice cold, but does require that I add extra ice throughout the day. I have noticed that the longer I use it, the longer the ice seems to last, but hot days really challenge the ability to keep the ice from melting. Overall, I am satisfied with the performance as I have tried many different products and this is the best that I have found. It fits great in the cup holders of my SUV, truck, touring car and even the tractor. I cannot comment on the effectiveness of keeping hot beverages regulated in temperature as I do not partake in them.\n\nRated 4 out of 5 by PabloSL from Tumbler Leaks Love my tumbler. 4 stars cause I would love to see a leakproof lid in the future.", "description": "With the classic YETI Rambler 20 oz.
