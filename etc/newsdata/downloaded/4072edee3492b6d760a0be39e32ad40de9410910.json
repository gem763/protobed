But when Kent raised the issue with Biden\u2019s office, he was told the then-vice president didn\u2019t have the \u201cbandwidth\u201d to deal with the issue involving his son as his other son, Beau, was battling cancer, said the people familiar with his testimony.\n\nSubscribe to the Post Most newsletter: Today\u2019s most popular stories on The Washington Post\n\nThe testimony by Kent offers a reminder that as Democrats probe President Trump\u2019s alleged actions in pressuring Ukraine to dig up compromising information on Biden, the impeachment inquiry also threatens to keep alive questions about the former vice president\u2019s handling of his son\u2019s foreign work at a precarious moment for his 2020 presidential campaign.\n\nKent, who also testified about how Trump\u2019s associates raised unfounded allegations about the former ambassador to Ukraine, is the first known example of a career diplomat who raised concerns internally in the Obama administration about Hunter Biden\u2019s board position. The Washington Post has previously reported that there had been discussions among Biden\u2019s advisers about whether his son\u2019s Ukraine work would be perceived as a conflict of interest, and that one former adviser had been concerned enough to mention it to Biden, though the conversation was brief.\n\nDuring his testimony this week, Kent did not name the Biden staffer he said he communicated with, according to people familiar with his remarks.\n\nAlthough many of Trump\u2019s charges regarding Hunter Biden have been unfounded, the elder Biden has faced questions about why he didn\u2019t anticipate concerns about potential conflicts of interest as he took a leading role in carrying out U.S. policy toward Ukraine. Polls show Biden with an advantage over Trump in a potential general election matchup, and Biden has sought in recent days to focus attention on the actions of a president many Democrats see as corrupt and unfit for office. \u00a9 Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Hunter Biden in October 2012. A career State Department official testified Tuesday that he had raised concerns about Biden\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine in early 2015.\n\nA former senior Biden national security aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, had no recollection of hearing about Kent\u2019s concerns, and also never heard a concern raised by the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine at the time. The first time the aide recalls Hunter Biden\u2019s involvement surfacing as an issue was in December 2015, when the vice president traveled to Ukraine to deliver an anti-corruption speech and the New York Times wrote about his son\u2019s role. Hunter Biden\u2019s board appointment had been publicly announced the previous year and reported by the media at the time.\n\nThe aide said that Hunter Biden\u2019s position had no substantive impact.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand what the optics thing means other than someone thinking it looked bad in a political way,\u201d the aide said. \u201cDid it have any effect on US policies, either on what we were doing or what the Ukrainians were doing? It didn\u2019t\u2026. In the aggregate it didn\u2019t have any discernible effect.\u201d\n\nThe aide said that Joe Biden was dealing with a lot during Beau Biden\u2019s bout with cancer, but that it had a minimal impact on his work.\n\n\u201cDay to day the vice president was at work and he was pretty focused,\u201d the aide said. \u201cDoes that mean it\u2019s inconceivable that someone said, \u2018Hey look it\u2019s not the time to raise a family issue?\u2019 I guess it\u2019s conceivable. But I never saw evidence he wasn\u2019t capable of doing the VP role and dealing with his family at the same time.\u201d\n\nAndrew Bates, a Biden campaign spokesman, said in a statement that \u201con Joe Biden\u2019s watch, the U.S. made eradicating corruption a centerpiece of our policies toward Ukraine.\u201d\n\nHunter Biden joined the board of the Ukrainian gas company \u2014 which was headed by a former government minister investigated for possible corruption \u2014 in 2014, at the same time his father was leading U.S. efforts to crack down on corruption in that country.\n\nThe issue has erupted in recent weeks amid revelations about a July 25 phone call in which Trump asked Ukraine\u2019s president to \u201clook into\u201d the Bidens, particularly whether Joe Biden pressured Ukrainian officials to fire a prosecutor whose office had been investigating Burisma. The Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry is seeking to determine whether Trump withheld military aid and diplomatic support to Ukraine in an attempt to get information to use against Biden.\n\nTrump and his allies have made the unsubstantiated claim that Biden pressed for the prosecutor\u2019s firing to protect his son. In fact, according to former U.S. officials and Ukrainian anti-corruption activists, the investigation of Burisma was dormant at the time. And Biden, adding to the calls from others in the U.S. government and Western institutions, was urging Ukraine to tap a new prosecutor who would be more aggressive in combating corruption.\n\nBiden has said that he never spoke with his son about his dealings with Ukraine and has said that he only learned of his position on the Burisma board when he read about it in news reports.\n\nHunter Biden told ABC in an interview this week that he did \u201cnothing wrong at all\u201d but that he showed \u201cpoor judgment\u201d in accepting the position on the Burisma board.\n\nJoe Biden told reporters Wednesday that he wouldn\u2019t have changed anything about his actions, including discouraging his son from joining the board, and said he had no regrets.\n\n\u201cNo. No, I don\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause I never discussed with my son anything having to do with what was going on in Ukraine. That\u2019s a fact.\u201d\n\nBiden has pledged that, if president, no one in his family would have \u201cany business relationship with anyone that relates to a foreign corporation or foreign country.\u201d During the presidential candidates debate on Tuesday night, he twice dodged a question about why he did not have a similar policy as vice president.\n\nBut on Wednesday, he said his new policy was developed not because of anything Hunter Biden did but because of the actions of the Trump family.\n\nSlideshow by photo services\n\nDaughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, hold senior White House jobs, while Trump has retained ownership of his real estate business, which is being run by his sons and has been the subject of lawsuits alleging that the company has been a conduit for foreign governments to enrich Trump in violation of the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clause. On Thursday, the White House announced that Trump had awarded the 2020 Group of Seven summit of world leaders to his golf resort in Miami, using his public office to direct a large contract to his private company.\n\n\u201cIn my White House, none of my children or family have offices at the White House,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThey will not be invited to sit in significant meetings of a Cabinet-level post and they will have no foreign investment, and the reason to do that is not because of anything that went on in our administration. It is because of what Donald Trump has done. He has so debased the standard of what constitutes ethical behavior that the next president has to make it absolutely clear \u2014 absolutely clear \u2014 this will not happen again.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign has been attempting to move past any discussions about Hunter Biden, and his team considers most questions having already been addressed. Biden aides also pointed toward the debate on Tuesday night, where no candidate criticized Biden on the issue, as a sign that it is not resonating on the campaign trail.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been asked and answered,\u201d Kate Bedingfield, his deputy campaign manager, told reporters after the debate. \u201cDemocratic voters know that these lies are not getting traction and it's not the conversation they want to hear. And I think that was reflected in the fact that it was not a significant piece of the discussion.\u201d\n\nMichael Kranish, Josh Dawsey, Greg Jaffe and Karoun Demirjian contributed to this report.", "description": "George Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state, was told in 2015 that then-Vice President Joe Biden didn\u2019t have the \u201cbandwidth\u201d to deal with the matter.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAHQHun.img?h=218&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=934&y=746", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
