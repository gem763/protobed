He has six children and every time he sees them it reminds him of what he has done.\n\n\u201cHe is a talented artist and while in prison has just put his head down and got on with it. He has been working while in custody in the workshop and is a model prisoner.\u201d\n\nFor the most recent conviction, Judge Dean Kershaw handed the serial paedophile a sentence that will only begin when his current one ends.\n\n\u201cI have read the victim impact statement and it is harrowing,\" the judge said.\n\n\"This has affected her.\n\n\u201cThe victim was a very, very young child, some may even say a toddler. You managed to get away with this offence for all of these years.\n\n\u201cYou were in your late 30s and took advantage of a situation that arose.\n\n\u201cThe victim has suffered, I won\u2019t read out her statement in court, but it has had an impact on her. It had an effect on her relationship with her mother who did not initially believe her.\u201d\n\nDeakin is already on the sex offenders\u2019 register for life after the previous conviction.\n\nHe will also have to spend 12 months on licence following his current jail term.", "description": "Michael Deakin was handed a sentence extension after one of his victims spotted the serial sex offender in an online article", "authors": ["Matt Jackson", "Milo Boyd", "Image", "Stoke Sentinel Bpm Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20723575.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JOP_MDG_231019dea_1483-JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
