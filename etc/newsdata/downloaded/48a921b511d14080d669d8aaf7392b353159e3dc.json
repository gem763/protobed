(Mark Tenally/Associated Press)\n\nIt\u2019s not your imagination. The defenses of the undefeated San Francisco 49ers and New England Patriots have been ridiculously difficult to pass against. Historically ridiculous, in fact.\n\nThe 49ers have allowed 133.5 passing yards per game and the Patriots 148.4 passing yards per game. Over the season, that works out to 2,136 yards for San Francisco and 2,374 for New England. No defense has allowed fewer than 2,400 passing yards over a 16-game season since Washington (2,171) in 1980, according to Pro Football Talk.\n\nThe bad news for both the 49ers and the Patriots is they haven\u2019t exactly faced Peyton Manning in his prime so far. After this week\u2019s game against Carolina, the 49ers play Arizona twice, Seattle twice, Green Bay, Baltimore, New Orleans, Atlanta and the Los Angeles Rams. The Patriots, after Sunday\u2019s game against the Cleveland Browns, play Baltimore, Philadelphia, Dallas, Houston, Kansas City, Cincinnati, Buffalo and Miami.\n\nThe Ravens and Cowboys have byes this week.\n\nAll times Eastern.\n\n1 Seahawks at Falcons Fox 1 Broncos at Colts CBS 1 Buccaneers at Titans Fox 1 Cardinals at Saints CBS 1 Bengals at Rams CBS 1 Eagles at Bills Fox 1 Chargers at Bears Fox 1 Giants at Lions Fox 1 Jets at Jaguars CBS 4:05 Panthers at 49ers Fox 4:25 Raiders at Texans CBS 4:25 Browns at Patriots CBS 8:20 Packers at Chiefs NBC\n\nThe early shift\n\nSeahawks (5-2) at Falcons (1-6), 1, Fox\n\nWith left tackle Duane Brown out (biceps), Russell Wilson was flustered repeatedly in last week\u2019s loss to the Ravens. He was hit eight times and completed less than 50 percent of his passes for the first time since Week 15 of the 2017 season. Playing the Falcons, though, may be just what Seattle needs. Atlanta QB Matt Ryan was limited in practice after suffering an ankle injury in a loss to the Rams, a frustrating game typified by Devonta Freeman\u2019s ejection for throwing a punch at Aaron Donald. In what clearly is a lost season, it seems unlikely that the Falcons will press Ryan to play, although they have lost five in a row and the seat beneath Coach Dan Quinn remains extremely hot. Atlanta\u2019s offense converted only three of 12 third-down chances against the Rams and netted 224 total yards.\n\n[John Clayton: With the NFL trade deadline looming, here are some potential deals]\n\nBroncos (2-5) at Colts (4-2), 1, CBS\n\nWho woulda thunk, back when Andrew Luck announced his retirement, that the Colts would be 4-2 and atop the AFC South? Jacoby Brissett, a more consistent if less spectacular quarterback than Luck, and Coach Frank Reich apparently have the team on the right track and Brissett, with 14 touchdown passes through six games, is on pace to lead the NFL in TD passes. At his current pace, he\u2019d finish with 37. The three leaders in that department \u2014 Patrick Mahomes, Matt Ryan and Russell Wilson \u2014 each have 15, but have played in seven games.\n\nBuccaneers (2-4) at Titans (3-4), 1, Fox\n\nIn his first start since the benching of Marcus Mariota, Ryan Tannehill passed for 312 yards (topping 300 for the first time since 2016 when he was with Miami) and two touchdowns (with one interception) as the Titans snapped a two-game losing streak, helped by a 90-yard, one-touchdown performance by running back Derrick Henry. Tampa Bay\u2019s Jameis Winston is coming off a bye week that followed a five-interception horror show in a loss to Carolina in London and Bruce Arians addressed the elephant in the room: Winston\u2019s future in Tampa next year. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s just play it all out and let\u2019s see,\u2019\u2019 Arians said. \u201cCan we correct mistakes? Can we get better? Can we play like we did in Los Angeles six weeks in a row? Or in Carolina? And not have that game [in London] at the end of the day? Then again, that\u2019s a lot of guys around him. Part of being disappointed is sometimes guys around him are making mistakes that are affecting him.'' That includes the defense, the league\u2019s worst against the pass.\n\nCardinals (3-3-1) at Saints (6-1), 1, CBS\n\nIf there were an award for best coach over the first half of the season, Sean Payton would probably take the prize. By beating the Bears last week, the Saints won their fifth straight game since losing Drew Brees and did it behind Teddy Bridgewater, without Alvin Kamara, Jared Cook and Brees. That may be about to change, though, with Brees declaring midweek that he (and his surgically repaired thumb) would play if he can \u201cbe sure that I can be me.\u201d Is it better to play him against a defense that had eight sacks last week, with four by Chandler Jones, or give him the bye week before starting against a Falcons defense with zero sacks over the last four games? The Cardinals are in the midst of their first three-game winning streak since 2015, with rookie quarterback Kyler Murray progressing.\n\nBengals (0-7) at Rams (4-3), 1, CBS\n\nThe Rams broke out of a three-game losing streak with a win over Atlanta, with newly acquired cornerback Jalen Ramsey playing more than the team had initially indicated. Ramsey played on 83.9 percent of the Rams\u2019 snaps in the first half and lined up against Julio Jones on 17 of his 26 snaps over those quarters, allowing three receptions for 69 yards, according to Next Gen Stats. The Bengals hope to get running back Joe Mixon going. After leading the AFC in rushing in 2018 with 1,168 yards in only 14 games, has only 254 on 84 carries, with no touchdowns. A year ago, he averaged 4.9 yards per carry; this year\u2019s it\u2019s 3.0.\n\n[As Dolphins march toward winless season, NFL has no plans for NBA-style draft lottery]\n\nEagles (3-4) at Bills (5-1), 1, Fox\n\nThe Bills don\u2019t play a team with a winning record until Nov. 28, when they visit the Cowboys in Dallas. That starts a stretch in which they also play the Ravens and Patriots over the final five weeks. Eagles Coach Doug Pederson is unlikely to make any guarantees that he\u2019ll then un-guarantee this week. His team is coming off a loss to Dallas, in which Carson Wentz (8-10 in starts over the last two years) had three turnovers. Philadelphia is also dealing with injuries to Jason Peters, DeSean Jackson, Nigel Bradham, Ronald Darby, Fletcher Cox and Hassan Ridgeway. Topping it off, Philly\u2019s next four opponents (Buffalo, Chicago, New England and Seattle) have a 20-6 record.\n\nChargers (2-5) at Bears (3-3), 1, Fox\n\nThe Bears are the 37th team since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger to not have at least 300 yards of offense once through their first six games. \u201cRight now, we have no identity,\u201d quarterback Mitchell Trubisky said after the Bears averaged 8.5 yards per drive over three quarters and had only four first downs over that span in a loss to New Orleans. \u201cI know we need to run the ball more,\u201d Coach Matt Nagy acknowledged. \u201cI\u2019m not an idiot.\u201d The Chargers have lost three in a row next play the Packers, Raiders and Chiefs before their merciful Week 12 bye.\n\nGiants (2-5) at Lions (2-3-1), 1, Fox\n\nThe Giants got Saquon Barkley back Sunday. It didn\u2019t help, not when Arizona\u2019s Chase Edmonds rushed for a career-best 126 yards and scored on runs of 20, 20 and 22 yards. The Cardinals\u2019 defense had four sacks, an interception and a fumble recovery in New York\u2019s third straight loss. Coming off NFC North losses to the Packers and Vikings, the Lions made a midweek move ahead of the Oct. 29 trade deadline, sending safety Quandre Diggs and a 2021 seventh-round draft pick to Seattle for a fifth-round pick in 2020.\n\nJets (1-5) at Jaguars (3-4), 1, CBS\n\nThe Jets\u2019 33-0 loss to the Patriots left quarterback Sam Darnold \u201cseeing ghosts\u201d on the sideline and afterward he had to have a toenail removed.. Still, he\u2019s expected to play after the team finds the right footwear to minimize his discomfort. Meanwhile, Minshew Mania may be coming to an end, with Nick Foles (broken collarbone) practicing again and getting closer to reclaiming the Jacksonville quarterback job from Gardner Minshew II and his magnificent mustache. Week 11 is the target for Foles\u2019s return. In a win over the Bengals, Minshew led the Jaguars to 18 fourth-quarter points and finished with 255 yards passing. Leonard Fournette, who leads the AFC in rushing, gained 131 yards, the eighth time he has gained 100 or more yards in his career. On defense, Jacksonville forced four turnovers, including three interceptions of Andy Dalton.\n\nThe late games\n\nPanthers (4-2) at 49ers (6-0), 4:05, Fox\n\nQuarterback Kyle Allen, who is undefeated in four starts replacing Cam Newton (foot), will start in Santa Clara and the Panthers are looking for their third straight victory on the road. Carolina leads the NFL in sacks with 27 and its 15 takeaways are tied for second in the NFL. As for the Niners, it\u2019s tempting to write off a 9-0 win over the Redskins that looked as if it was being played in a kiddie pool at FedEx Field, but a couple of things are noteworthy. Arik Armstead and Dee Ford combined for five tackles and two sacks, and Nick Bosa had five tackles, four tackles for a loss and a sack. During the week, the Niners made a move to bolster Jimmy Garoppolo\u2019s options at wide receiver, trading 2020 third- and fourth-round draft picks to the Broncos for Emmanuel Sanders and a 2020 fifth-rounder. Interestingly, the trade sets Sanders up to potentially play in 17 games (seven already with Denver and 10 remaining with the Niners) \u2014 something NFL owners want all players to do in the future.\n\n[Best bets for NFL Week 8: Bills and Broncos cover, behind top defenses]\n\nRaiders (3-3) at Texans (4-3), 4:25, CBS\n\nRaiders cornerback Gareon Conley was traded last week to the Texans, who are coping with injuries to Johnathan Joseph and Bradley Roby. Conley, described as \u201clikely\u201d to play against his former team, started all six games for the Raiders and had 33 tackles, an interception and two passes defensed. The Texans led the AFC South before losing last week to the Colts. Both Tennessee and Jacksonville (at 3-4) remain in the race. The Raiders are coming off a thumping against Green Bay in which six Packers caught passes of 20 or more yards. The Raiders and their middling offense (ranked 16th in the NFL) will face a middling (17th-ranked) Houston defense.\n\nBrowns (2-4) at Patriots (7-0), 4:25, CBS\n\nThe Patriots have outscored opponents 233-48, but, because they\u2019ve been winning with defense, they felt the need to acquire wide receiver Mohamed Sanu from the Falcons. After dusting the Jets on Monday night, offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels told reporters that he\u2019d begun preparing for Cleveland at 4:30 a.m. Tuesday and Bill Belichick delivered a classic take: \u201cCleveland practiced so, I mean, they\u2019re already way ahead of us. We got a lot of catching up to do.\u201d Okaaaay. Meanwhile, Tom Brady refuses to shed any light on his future with the team.\n\nThe night game\n\nPackers (6-1) at Chiefs (5-2), 8:20, NBC\n\nIn a win over the Raiders, Aaron Rodgers had three or more passing TDs and at least one rushing TD for the fifth time, according to the NFL. Rodgers\u2019s relationship with Coach Matt LaFleur seems to be meshing nicely, thanks for asking. Green Bay has averaged 33 points over the last three games \u2014 more than they\u2019ve averaged over any three-game stretch since 2016. And they haven\u2019t had Davante Adams, Rodgers\u2019s favorite target, for any of those games. Adams (turf toe) returned to practice midweek and has a chance of playing. Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes wanted dearly to play and returned to practice Wednesday, six days after dislocating his kneecap in a win over the Broncos. But Matt Moore will do the honors at QB.\n\nRead more NFL coverage from The Post:\n\nEagles\u2019 Fletcher Cox scared off an intruder at his home with a shotgun\n\nThe biggest questions facing the NFL\u2019s top playoff contenders\n\nThe NFL is in the midst of a play-action boom and Kirk Cousins is reaping the benefits\n\nDaniel Jones has been mostly terrible, but the Giants aren\u2019t going back to Eli Manning\n\nSaints savagely mock Bears\u2019 Tarik Cohen over his height\n\nClayton: The biggest questions facing the NFL\u2019s top playoff contenders", "description": "The Patriots and 49ers are favored to remain undefeated as the season nears its midway point.", "authors": ["Cindy Boren", "Reporter Covering Sports", "With An Emphasis On Politics", "National Stories", "October At Am", "Cindy Boren Arrived At The Post In As An Assignment Editor In Charge Of Baseball", "Nfl Redskins Coverage.
