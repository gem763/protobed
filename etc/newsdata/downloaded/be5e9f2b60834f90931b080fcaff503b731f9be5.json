Why has Beto opted to pursue the single campaign strategy that seems most likely to hamstring his own political future within his state\u2014and thus perhaps do the most damage to his own party?\n\nThe idealist answer is that O\u2019Rourke simply doesn\u2019t care about all these fussy political machinations and triangulations\u2014that he\u2019s simply following what he believes to be right, and letting the chips fall where they may. It\u2019s a possibility, but one that\u2019s hard to reconcile with his refusal to consider challenging Cornyn: If achieving a more stringent gun policy were truly more important to Beto than becoming president, wouldn\u2019t he be doing his part to make sure Democrats get the necessary legislative seats to pass those policies\u2014because Democrats have to defeat Mitch McConnell in addition to Donald Trump if they want to pass their dream agenda.\n\nThen there\u2019s the more cynical answer: That Team Beto has simply decided that making moves that appear to work dramatically against their own private political interest is itself the foundation of a useful political brand. Plenty of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s recent decisions might lead one to suspect this is the case: Not just the gun policy swerve, but also recent changes such as his new habit of deploying ostentatious profanity in his TV appearances. Here\u2019s a guy who\u2019s too fed up to care about the regular, stuffy rules, Beto\u2019s new stance seems to say. And isn\u2019t that the kind of guy who\u2019d make a good president?", "description": "", "authors": ["Andrew Egger", "Thebulwark.Com Beto-Orourke-Is-Mortgaging-His-Future"], "top_image": ""}
