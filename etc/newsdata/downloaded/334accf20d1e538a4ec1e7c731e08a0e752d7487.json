Bush lost his job.\n\nThat gave him a unique view from the inside of a media maelstrom, and he\u2019s using it as a selling point to land interviews with celebrities in similar situations. The idea: I, more than anyone, know what you\u2019re going through and I\u2019m not going to make things worse.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve already connected with several people I\u2019m watching right now getting the flogging and the public shaming and the cancel culture and all that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m the first one to reach out and say, \u2018you know you\u2019re in good hands with me.\u2019\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m going to nurture you,\u201d Bush said. \u201cBut I am going to be extremely fair and empathetic of the human condition, which is that we\u2019re all hard-wired for good and evil and we\u2019re not at our best sometimes.\u201d\n\nFor competitive reasons, the only example that his executive producer, Lisa Gregorisch-Dempsey, will cite is a \u201cBachelor in Paradise\u201d contestant.\n\nGregorisch-Dempsey knew Bush in the early days of his career, before he moved to \u201cAccess.\u201d With George W. Bush in the White House, she looked for someone in the Bush family for \u201cExtra\u201d and jokes, \u201cwe thought they were going to bring us a really cute son of Jeb Bush.\u201d Billy Bush, a cousin of the president, had been working on a radio show in Washington.\n\nNow, with changes to her show, she considered Bush \u201cthe only person who could do what we\u2019re doing,\u201d because of his reporting ability.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a person I\u2019ve ever talked to who didn\u2019t say that he got a raw deal,\u201d Gregorisch-Dempsey said. \u201cLife is about second chances.\u201d\n\nBush had to wonder if that time would come. During his \u201cforced hiatus,\u201d as he calls it, he\u2019d hear from people who were interested in hiring him but terrified of the attention it could get. \u201cNobody wants that light to swing around on them,\u201d he said.\n\nHe considered changing careers.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018OK, now what?'\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll be a butcher. No, I\u2019m bad with knives. Maybe I\u2019ll go to law school? No, you\u2019re too old for that. And then I just realized this is really what I\u2019m good at. It\u2019s what I love, darn it. Open that door and let me back in.\u201d\n\nHe said he owns his behavior \u2014 laughing and not pushing back against coarse remarks \u2014 and isn\u2019t interested in playing the victim.\n\nStill, he said the irony that the person who controlled the conversation caught on the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape became president of the United States isn\u2019t lost on him. (He told Fox\u2019s \u201cGood Day New York\u201d that Trump never reached out to him). NBC, which owned \u201cAccess Hollywood,\u201d played its role, \u201cbut I\u2019m the one that paid,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOnce you get through the depression and break down and you\u2019re at the lowest of the low, you slowly come out and you realize, \u2018wow, I\u2019m glad that\u2019s behind me,'\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like going to the gym, you know. \u2018Oh, I hate going and I don\u2019t want to work out, but when I come out it\u2019s like OK, I feel pretty good.\u2019 And I feel stronger for the experience, although I\u2019d never want to relive it again.\u201d\n\nBush isn\u2019t interested in doing \u201cgotcha journalism\u201d and \u201cExtra\u201d isn\u2019t, either, Gregorisch-Dempsey said.\n\n\u201cHe really was very thoughtful about working on himself and improving himself, and he sort of went to the depths of where a person could go,\u201d she said. \u201cHe did the work and brought himself back and his new perspective is quite refreshing.\u201d\n\nStarting Monday, Gregorisch-Dempsey finds out if the chance she took will pay off.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Three years after being fired by NBC due to the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" tape with Donald Trump, Billy Bush is joining \"Extra\" as a host.", "authors": ["David Bauder", "Alicia Rancilio"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/billy-bush-new-gig.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
