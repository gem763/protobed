The state-level probe will examine a wide range of Facebook\u2019s activities, including its handling of user data, its effects on consumer choice, and the price of advertising, New York\u2019s attorney general said in a statement.\n\n\u201cEven the largest social media platform in the world must follow the law and respect consumers. I am proud to be leading a bipartisan coalition of attorneys general in investigating whether Facebook has stifled competition and put users at risk,\u201d James said. \u201cWe will use every investigative tool at our disposal to determine whether Facebook\u2019s actions may have endangered consumer data, reduced the quality of consumers\u2019 choices, or increased the price of advertising.\u201d\n\nFacebook did not immediately respond to our request for comment.\n\nIn addition to James, attorneys general from Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, and the District of Columbia will be on the investigation\u2019s leadership team, according to James\u2019 office.\n\nOn July 23, the U.S. Department of Justice announced that it has begun an expansive investigation into \u201cmarket-leading online platforms\u201d to determine whether they \u201care engaging in practices that have reduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers.\u201d\n\nThe following day, Facebook confirmed that it is facing antitrust probes from both the Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice. That revelation came on the heels of the FTC\u2019s announcement earlier the same day that it had fined Facebook a record $US5 ($7) billion for privacy violations in part stemming from the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Despite the substantial fine and increased restrictions on the company\u2019s privacy and transparency practices, the penalty was seen as inadequate by Democrats.\n\nU.S. state-level action against major tech firms is reportedly not limited to Facebook. Google is also expected to face an investigation from \u201cmore than half\u201d the state attorneys general, according to the Washington Post. That inquiry will reportedly be announced on Monday.\n\nDespite the flurry of attention from regulators, major tech companies have yet to suffer any lasting consequences that disrupt their businesses or meaningfully cut into their bottom lines. Indeed, Facebook\u2019s stock price jumped 1.8 per cent after the FTC revealed its fine. Maybe this one will stick?", "description": "New York Attorney General Letitia James launched a multi-state antitrust investigation into Facebook on Friday, applying a new layer of pesky regulatory scrutiny to the scandal-ridden social network....", "authors": ["David Nield", "Tegan Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/rfockfohptre9e5urom7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
