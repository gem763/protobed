As Fiat Chrysler talks merger with Peugeot maker, here's what to know", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE\n\nDETROIT \u2013 Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and PSA Groupe, best known for its Peugeot brand, reportedly have agreed to merge, creating one of the largest automotive groups in the world. The deal could cause ripples that would affect FCA\u2019s crosstown Detroit rivals, General Motors and Ford.\n\nFCA already brings a more international focus to Detroit\u2019s automotive scene, with its substantial Italian operations, headquarters in London and incorporation in the Netherlands \u2013 but a merger with the French automaker would broaden that dramatically.\n\nFor Americans, who might not have heard much about PSA Groupe, here\u2019s some perspective on the company and a potential merger with FCA:\n\nWhat does PSA Groupe sell?\n\nPSA Groupe, whose company roots spring from bicycle manufacturing, has brands beyond Peugeot \u2013 Citroen, Opel, Vauxhall and the luxury DS Automobiles, none of which are sold in the United States. Opel and Vauxhall might sound a bit more familiar to U.S. car fans, especially to anyone connected with GM. PSA Groupe grew substantially when it purchased the brands in 2017 from GM. GM saw them as money-losing operations, but in PSA\u2019s hands, the brands have flourished.\n\nWeren't Peugeot cars sold in U.S.?\n\nYes, but the brand pulled out in 1991 over its sales struggles. The Free Press noted at the time that Peugeot had sold just 4,261 cars in the United States in 1990 compared with 14,336 in 1986. The failure to connect with U.S. car buyers and decision to retreat mirrored struggles with other European brands \u2013 Britain\u2019s Sterling, France\u2019s Renault and Italy\u2019s Fiat (Fiat, of course, has returned but it\u2019s not clear how much longer the brand will stay). More recently, PSA Groupe has been pushing for a return to the U.S. market, even picking Atlanta last year for its North American headquarters.\n\nAuto giant: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles could merge with French automaker PSA Groupe\n\nWho runs PSA Groupe?\n\nCarlos Tavares is the chairman and chief executive officer. He was once considered Carlos Ghosn\u2019s \u201cright-hand man,\u201d serving as chief operating officer of Renault, the other big French automaker, which was in talks this year that were aborted in June to merge with FCA. Ghosn was once a legendary power in the international automotive industry before being accused of financial misdeeds in Japan. That drama is still playing out, and the FCA talk had added strain to an already strained Renault-Nissan alliance.\n\nAre PSA and FCA connected now?\n\nThey are. The companies have a partnership to make vans in Italy. FCA CEO Mike Manley praised the arrangement during an earnings call earlier this year. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the best partnerships that we\u2019ve had,\u201d Manley said at the time, noting then that FCA would \u201cabsolutely\u201d consider a partnership with PSA related to electrification \u201cunder the right circumstances.\u201d\n\nPSA has also been one of the many companies floated as a possible merger candidate in recent years for FCA. The ties between the two companies have some history to them as well. Chrysler Corp. used to own a piece of Peugeot, opting in 1986 to sell its 12.5% stake in the company. The Free Press reported at the time that then-Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca said it was a case of \u201cinvestment priorities.\u201d \u201cWe will use the money we get from selling our Peugeot shares in our program to keep Chrysler competitive in productivity and quality products.\"\n\nBefore that, Peugeot bought the European operations of the then-failing Chrysler Corp. That unit developed the car Dodge/Plymouth would build and sell in the United States as the Omni and Horizon.\n\nWhat complicates the deal?\n\nComplications, or pushback, could start in Europe, where labor unions have already expressed concerns. The potential for job cuts was one of the worries expressed during the Renault/FCA talks. As is the case with Renault, PSA\u2019s footprint overlaps FCA\u2019s in Europe.\n\nIan Fletcher, an analyst with IHS Markit and an expert on the European auto industry, noted Tavares\u2019 reputation, saying \u201che has made job cuts and rationalized production and been quite hard.\u201d Fletcher does not expect major changes to FCA\u2019s employment picture in North America. FCA is expecting to add almost 5,000 jobs as part of its massive expansion in Detroit.\n\nPSA's stakeholders could also pose an issue, although Fletcher doesn't believe one of those \u2013 the French government \u2013 will stand in the way. Instead, he pointed to Dongfeng Motor, a Chinese company, as a potential issue in light of the political realities in Washington.\n\nContributing: Mark Phelaneport. Follow Eric D.
