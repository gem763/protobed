According to interior designer Mandy Cheng, the big perk of these is that \u201cyou know your guests won\u2019t be sleeping on a foldout with metal bars digging into their back.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re on a budget (but looking for something clean and modern), Chang recommends this 40-pound LUCID foam mattress. \u201cSince the entire sofa is the mattress, that\u2019s the only weight you have to deal with. Pair it with some floor pillows, a colorful throw, and work the room like it\u2019s a low-key pouf lounge. Everyone loves a pouf lounge.\u201d", "description": "We asked interior designers to share their favorite sleeper sofas, from futons to chairs to sofas, from brands including Wayfair, Joybird, Interior Define, CB2, West Elm, and more.", "authors": ["Lori Keong", "Lauren Ro"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/strategist/2019/10/28/sleeper-sofas/28-sleeper-sofa.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
