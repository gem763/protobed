Parliament does not speak in code; if it intended to give Sars NIA-like [national intelligence agency-like] powers, it would have said so.\u201d\n\nThe party said: \u201cWhile Mr Gordhan was at its helm, Sars evolved from a revenue-gatherer to a state-funded detective agency, kitted out with all the things a good spy needs\u201d.\n\nThe party said the spying kit included surveillance cameras, tracking devices, wire taps \u201cand a host of other gadgets that are evidently sensitive enough to warrant redaction from the Public Protector\u2019s report\u201d.\n\nThe case, in which the EFF wants the apex court to overturn the high court interdict granted to Gordhan in July against Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane\u2019s report, will be heard on November 28.\n\nMkhwebane found in July that in terms of legislation, Sars was not included as one of the national intelligence structures established in terms of the National Strategic Intelligence Act.\n\nShe said: \u201cThe equipment was kept at Sars\u2019 premises and was the latest technical surveillance countermeasures equipment that could be used for video and audio recording, as well as the tracking devices.\u201d\n\nREAD: NPA to drop Sars \u2018rogue case\u2019\n\nMkhwebane\u2019s remedial action included a criminal investigation and that President Cyril Ramaphosa take disciplinary steps against Gordhan.\n\nHowever, the sanction has been put on hold by the high court pending the outcome of a review application to set aside the report.\n\nThe EFF told the Constitutional Court that other investigative reports, besides that of Mkhwebane, had also found the establishment of the Sars unit under Gordhan, who was then commissioner, to be unlawful.\n\nThese include the KPMG report and an Inspector-General of Intelligence report.\n\nHowever, KPMG had later withdrawn some parts of its report and the admissibility of the report of the Inspector-General of Intelligence was subject to another pending court hearing in which State Security Minister Ayanda Dlodlo wanted the report removed from the record of Gordhan\u2019s review application.\n\nThe rogue unit allegations date back to 2014, in which an investigation led by advocate Muzi Sikhakhane found prima facie evidence that the structure was unlawful.\n\nAn advisory committee led by retired Judge Frank Kroon agreed with Sikhakhane, but last year Kroon made a U-turn when he appeared before retired Judge Robert Nugent in an inquiry into Sars. Nugent did not investigate the unit but made a comment in passing that the unit was lawful.", "description": "In the hundreds of pages of affidavits and arguments filed in court, Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan does not point to a specific statutory source of power to establish the \u201crogue unit\u201d with its extraordinary powers.", "authors": ["Setumo Stone"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9165/331bf8c02d254c2da84e8ad63c69293c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
