New students are often forced to attend meetings and rallies just to be able to stay in the dormitories. Beating and bullying for having different views or defying the order of the leaders is common inside the universities.\n\nWhen school students taking part in the 2018 road safety protests were beaten by unknown attackers in helmets, BCL activists were widely blamed.\n\nIn the same year, BCL supporters attacked protesting students at Rajshahi University and pictures of one of the victims being beaten with a hammer went viral on social media.\n\nPolitical parties have been using their student wings as their muscle for a long time. Although the parties are not allowed to have official student wings, their existence is undeniable.\n\nNow even a senior leader of the Awami League has told BBC Bangla that it is time to rethink whether this kind of politics should be supported. Many people in Bangladesh share the same view, not least the parents who are dreaming of sending their children to Buet one day.\n\nOn Monday, students in Dhaka and other cities staged street protests, chanting slogans and blocking roads. Protests continued on Tuesday with students at Buet demanding the death penalty for those found guilty of the killing.\n\nFormer students and members of the teaching staff also joined the demonstration on the Buet campus.\n\n\"This is totally unacceptable that a student will die from torture in a residential hall,\" said AKM Masud, president of the Buet Teachers' Association, according to Bangladeshi site bdnews24.com.\n\n\"Abrar Fahad's death has proved the authorities' complete failure to ensure the safety of students.\"\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption There is widespread anger over Abrar Fahad's death\n\nA police spokesman said that, after examining CCTV footage, investigators detained nine men from Abrar Fahad's dormitory. At least five of them were BCL activists, police added.\n\nBy Tuesday the number of arrests had risen to 13, police said, all from Buet. Six more suspects are being sought.\n\nDhaka deputy police commissioner Munstasirul Islam confirmed to AFP news agency that the student had been beaten to death.\n\nBCL members quoted by local media said that Abrar Fahad had been \"questioned\" and beaten over alleged links to an Islamist party. That came after he wrote a post on social media criticising the government over a water sharing deal with India.\n\nIn a statement, the BCL said that after carrying out investigations it had expelled 11 members of its Buet division, bdnews24.com reported.", "description": "The brutal death of Abrar Fahad has shone fresh light on a culture of violence in universities.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/329B/production/_109155921_057138729.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
