The semi-finals now await after a seesawing contest against a battling Australia side who, for 65 minutes, made their opponents work extremely hard for their place in the tournament\u2019s last four.\n\nThe final margin did not entirely reflect an eventful game in which the Wallabies counterattacking excellence made life distinctly uncomfortable for England at times. Only in the final quarter did they finally establish a measure of forward control, built on the foundations of a rampaging 46th-minute score by their tighthead prop Kyle Sinckler which put crucial daylight between the teams.\n\nEngland v Australia: Rugby World Cup 2019, quarter-final \u2013 live! Read more\n\nTwo first-half tries from Jonny May also gave Jones\u2019s side a crucial early cushion, with a late intercept score from Anthony Watson and Owen Farrell\u2019s 100% contribution from the kicking tee also helping to keep England out of the Wallabies\u2019 clutches. It earned England a measure of consolation for their 33-13 defeat to their old rivals at the 2015 World Cup and was also the seventh win in a row for Jones over Michael Cheika\u2019s side.\n\nA one-sided outcome, however, did not always look on the cards. Australia had looked the brighter side initially, probing for gaps in England\u2019s defensive spacing and taking an early lead via Christian Lealiifano\u2019s first successful penalty. Their opponents took a while to make any kind of consistent front-foot impression, before two tries inside four minutes from May banished their jangling nerves.\n\nThe first was the product of a destructive hard line down the middle by Manu Tuilagi which sucked in the Australia defence and stretched the cover further out, allowing Farrell and Curry to put May over in the left corner. The Wallabies needed to strike back immediately but, instead, David Pocock\u2019s attempted pass to Lealiifano was intercepted by Henry Slade, whose chip ahead with his supposedly weaker right foot gave May another chance to show his searing pace.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kyle Sinckler runs through to score a critical try early in the second half after Australia had closed to within one point.

To their credit Cheika\u2019s side did not panic, attacking with verve and using purposeful pick-and-go tactics to try to fluster England. In terms of the scoreboard it yielded only a couple more penalties for Lealiifano to one from Farrell but at no stage could England entirely relax.\n\nAs well as enjoying 60% of first-half possession, the Wallabies were doing a good job of not allowing England to settle and the first score after the break felt important from both sides\u2019 perspective. Australia\u2019s second-half record against their opponents has not been great of late but within two minutes of the restart they had reduced the margin to a single point. Elliot Daly, under a bit of pressure, knocked on 40 metres from his own line and slick use of the resulting turnover ball all gave Marika Koroibete the space to burn off Daly and register only the third try against England in this tournament to date.\n\nWould it prove a decisive moment? The answer was soon delivered by a beaming Sinckler as he stormed untouched through the unguarded heart of the Wallaby defence to touch down by the posts. The Harlequins front-rower used to be a fly-half in his youth but this was the stuff of any prop forward\u2019s dreams.\n\nSinckler was also responsible for a crucial defensive rip as Australia pressed for another score before Watson\u2019s final intervention and Farrell\u2019s fourth conversion took England into 40-point territory.\n\nKoroibete looked to have scored a late consolation try but J\u00e9r\u00f4me Garc\u00e8s asked the TMO to have a look and Michael Hooper\u2019s pass was clearly forward, leaving the final score 40-16.\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email\n\nThere have been more conveniently-situated stadiums in World Cup history \u2013 exactly how and why two of rugby\u2019s showpiece games ended up in the Japanese equivalent of Cleethorpes remains a good question \u2013 but England will for ever remember their visit to this striking dome.\n\nAt the 13th attempt it was also the first time in Rugby World Cup history that a coach has guided another country to victory over his homeland. Jones will be rather less concerned about such minor details than making sure this is not the last success England enjoy at this tournament.", "description": "England have booked a place in the Rugby World Cup semi-finals after coming through a bruising, electrifying quarter-final against old rivals Australia in Oita", "authors": ["Robert Kitson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67e9b6046203170031bcf080771d25425efdf72b/0_99_4016_2411/master/4016.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=79719811c7a6c9103c1170f6e0993920", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
