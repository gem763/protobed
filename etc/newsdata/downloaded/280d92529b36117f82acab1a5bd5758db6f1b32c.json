He then told me to stop looking at him.\n\nMurray, who has flown back to the UK, still looked wound up at his presser (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018He told me to stop complaining, to have a sense of humour. I wanted to know where the sound came from and it came from him, which you\u2019re not allowed to do.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s against the rules, it\u2019s hindrance, you shouldn\u2019t do it. But he said I should have a sense of humour about that but in that moment neither of us were in a joking, laughing kind of mood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018He [umpire Fergus Murphy] wasn\u2019t saying anything to him. I was obviously frustrated with that. He wanted to engage with me, I probably shouldn\u2019t have done but I\u2019m not having him talk to me like that on the court.\u2019", "description": "Andy Murray continued his heated argument with Fabio Fognini in the locker room after the pair had clashed on court in Tuesday\u2019s second-round match at the Shanghai Masters.
