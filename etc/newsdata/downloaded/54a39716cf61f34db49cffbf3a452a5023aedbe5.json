During those months, Lara charged taxpayers $14,160 in total for his apartment in Sacramento, travel costs and other per diem expenses associated with his position, according to the records.\n\nLara spokesperson Michael Soller defended the charges, saying they don't violate state law, characterizing them as justified expenses, given travel and other demands associated with Lara's new position.\n\n\"The department staff vetted this and found it not only violated no laws but it also had the potential to benefit taxpayers by saving on hotel costs,\" he said.\n\nBut watchdogs say the unusual arrangement constitutes an ethical gray area at best.\n\n\u201cFor some jobs, you have to move \u2014 as millions of Californians will tell you,'' said Jessica Levinson, a professor of law and ethics at Loyola University in Los Angeles. \"The rent is high, and a good percentage of their salary goes to it \u2014 and that\u2019s how it goes. They don\u2019t get the taxpayers to pay for it. And frankly, neither should the insurance commissioner.\u201d\n\nAnd Lara's decision to file for rental reimbursement breaks precedent with two previous insurance commissioners. Republican Steve Poizner, who is from the Bay Area, did not charge living expenses to the state during his tenure as insurance commissioner. Neither did Democrat Dave Jones, though he did not have to commute far as a Sacramento resident.\n\nGov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, whose main residence was in Southern California, lived at the Hyatt Regency while in Sacramento but had his expenses paid by an outside foundation. Gov. Gavin Newsom, a former San Francisco mayor, recently moved from the Bay Area to a Sacramento suburb with his family at his own expense.\n\nNewsom, who endorsed Lara in his run for insurance commissioner, didn't respond to requests for comment Wednesday on Lara's ethical dilemma and legal questions he's facing about use of public funds.\n\nLara's entries show monthly reimbursement for \u201clodging\u201d and \u201crental\u201d costs ranging from $1,925 to $3,270 from January through June. Billings specified as \u201crailroad fare,\u2019\u2019 ranging from $570 to $700 per month, were also included. Soller said those entries actually \u201crefer to lodging\" and were entered in a transportation category because \u201cour accounting department didn\u2019t have a field to enter the lodging reimbursement for this purpose.\u201d\n\nLara, a 44-year-old Democrat who earns a $161,342 annual salary, did not respond to multiple interview requests. He previously served two terms in the state Assembly and was in his second term in the Senate when he was elected last November as insurance commissioner.\n\nThough Lara\u2019s primary residence is in Los Angeles \u2014 where there is also a state Insurance Commissioner office \u2014 \u201che rents a small studio apartment in Sacramento\u201d for a total cost of $700 a month, Soller said. He lives in the same apartment he rented as a senator.\n\n\u201cThe costs captured [in the bills he\u2019s submitted] represent the monthly lodging costs for the commissioner to conduct official state business in Sacramento,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nPOLITICO obtained Lara's expense records via a public records request to the state controller\u2019s office, which said it did not have copies of Lara's receipts. Soller didn't produce receipts for the rental property after several requests from POLITICO, saying they may have to be disclosed as part of a separate public records request.\n\nThe state Department of Human Resources manual mandates that executive branch employees who are required to obtain lodging due to state business \u201cshall only use commercial lodging establishments such as hotels, motels, bed and breakfast inns, public campgrounds, or short-term rentals (such as Airbnb) that cater to the general public.\u201d\n\nSoller said Department of Insurance legal counsel concluded that Lara's rental expenses comply with state law because he only bills taxpayers for days spent in Sacramento. He declined to provide the legal memo or the name of the lawyer.\n\nHe said the commissioner lives alone in the Sacramento apartment \u2014 though he declined to provide the address, neighborhood or the property\u2019s owner or landlord, saying that request breached the commissioner\u2019s right to confidentiality. And he said the expenditure is advantageous to state taxpayers compared with the $95 a night statewide elected leaders who don't live in Sacramento are entitled to before taxes.\n\n\"Department staff determined he could apply this lodging reimbursement to his rental rather than hotel bills,\u2019\u2019 Soller said. \u201cHis true costs for lodging would be higher if he weren\u2019t renting.\"\n\nSoller said Lara is \u201conly reimbursed for the time that he\u2019s here\u2019\u2019 at the $95 daily rate.\n\nDisclosure of the rental reimbursement requests comes after a spate of stories and editorials raising questions about Lara\u2019s coziness with insurance industry he regulates \u2014 prompting Lara to announce Tuesday he will release his public calendars and institute new fundraising and vetting procedures to deliver more transparency, and to reassure the public that he is meeting \u201cthe highest ethical standards.\u201d\n\nLara\u2019s case comes a little more than two months after Caltrans Director Laurie Berman stepped down after the Sacramento Bee reported she had been reimbursed for regular flights from her primary home in San Diego to Sacramento, as well as for most of her rent at a Sacramento duplex.\n\nDan Schnur, who formerly headed the California Fair Political Practices Commission, said Lara may no longer able to avoid blowback from his own Democratic Party. The spate of recent headlines has established \u201can overall impression that becomes increasingly hard to get past,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf he had an otherwise pristine record on ethical questions, this is the type of thing for which a heartfelt apology could allow him to move on without much damage,\u2019\u2019 said Schnur, a former GOP political consultant who is now an independent voter and a professor at USC\u2019s Annenberg School of Communications.\n\nSoller said the state controller\u2019s office, which is responsible for reimbursing state employees for travel and lodging costs, honored the legal opinion that Lara could obtain reimbursement for his Sacramento residence.\n\nJennifer Hanson, a spokesperson for Controller Betty Yee, said the Department of Insurance \u2014 like each state agency \u2014 \u201chas an internal accounting team that reviews travel claims and maintains receipts for auditing purposes.\u2019\u2019 The spokesperson said the Insurance Department's staff was in charge of approving the travel claim and then forwarding it to the controller's \"accounting and disbursements team for processing.''\n\nDisclosure of Lara\u2019s expenditures comes on the heels of San Diego Union-Tribune reports that raised questions about his coziness with the insurance industry after he reneged on a promise not to accept donations from insurers. Several editorials in major state newspapers have criticized Lara for decisions that have since appeared to benefit some of those industry donors.\n\nLara also raised eyebrows in Sacramento recently after POLITICO also obtained a video of an unannounced speech to industry executives at a private industry conference in which he assured industry attorneys that he was \u201creceptive\u201d to their ideas, which included allowing insurers access to telematics or vehicle computer data \u2014 an idea opposed by consumer advocates.\n\nLara said in a letter to consumer advocates this week that he takes \"full responsibility\" for failing to meet the highest ethical standards he set during his campaign, vowing to abide by \u201ca strict moratorium\u201d on political fundraising until year\u2019s end and to immediately release his public calendars \u2014 a move that he has resisted after several organizations and media outlets, including POLITICO, requested them.\n\nJamie Court, who heads Consumer Watchdog \u2014 an organization that has been critical of Lara\u2019s performance in office \u2014 said the latest development raises questions that Lara is potentially misusing public funds.\n\nClearly \u201cthe job of the insurance commissioner does not come with a second home in Sacramento,'' he said, noting Lara's home is within the same state, which means he can \u201ctake Southwest\u201d home when the work is done. He said Lara's justification of filing for \u201cper diem\u201d costs is also questionable.\n\nMembers of the California Legislature receive $201 in per diem allowance per day, in addition to their salary, when the Legislature is in session. While statewide officers \u2014 including the insurance commissioner \u2014 may be reimbursed for costs of doing state business, they do not receive the legislative per diem, according to the State Department of Human Resources.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s perfectly permissible to get reimbursed for overnight stays,\u2019\u2019 Court said. \u201cBut if these living expenses are related to setting up a second home, then this crosses the line of using public funds for private benefit.\u201d\n\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this report misstated where former insurance commissioner Dave Jones was from.", "description": "Lara has charged taxpayers thousands of dollars since his January inauguration for renting a residence in Sacramento, state records show.", "authors": ["Carla Marinucci", "Angela Hart"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/cf/dd/e7343ce542e48363a7b3717e1c08/ricardo-lara-900-ap.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
