The Trump Sons Have Plenty Too", "language": "en", "text": "Last month, the Trump family business received approval from a local government in Scotland for a major expansion of its golf resort near Aberdeen, marking the largest real estate development financed by the Trump Organization since the 2016 election.\n\nIn August, President Donald Trump\u2019s eldest son, Donald Jr., flew to Jakarta to help kick-start sales at a pair of Trump-branded luxury resorts planned for Indonesia. He appeared at a private event with wealthy prospective buyers and joined his politically connected billionaire Indonesian business partner at a news conference.\n\nAnd last year, Donald Jr. visited India to sell condos at future Trump-branded towers, appearing at an event that also featured India\u2019s prime minister.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here as a businessman,\u201d Trump told the gathering in New Delhi. \u201cI\u2019m not representing anyone.\u201d\n\nBut for the children of the politically powerful, personal business and public dealings can often be indistinguishable, especially when private projects depend on foreign governments that are looking to bolster ties with Washington.\n\nIn recent weeks, as the president has become embroiled in a scandal involving his interactions with Ukraine, Donald Trump Jr. and his brother Eric have taken to attacking Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, for his business dealings in Ukraine and China.\n\nThe brothers have accused him of leveraging his family name for personal gain while his father served in the Obama administration. Among other things, Hunter Biden was on the board of a Ukrainian energy company that has been a focus of the president\u2019s interest in the country.\n\n\u201cAt the VERY LEAST, there\u2019s the appearance of impropriety,\u201d Donald Trump Jr. wrote on Twitter. \u201cA clear conflict of interest.\u201d At a rally in Minneapolis on Thursday, Eric Trump\u2019s charged remarks about the former vice president\u2019s son inspired the crowd of Trump supporters to chant, \u201cLock him up!\u201d\n\nRepublicans, led by the president, have sought to make Hunter Biden\u2019s international business dealings an issue in the impeachment debate in Washington. But the high-profile attack roles being played by the president\u2019s eldest sons have now thrust their own business dealings into the spotlight, too.\n\nBoth sons have operated and promoted the Trump family business overseas during their father\u2019s presidency, even as he retains ownership. And while the Trump and Biden father-son relationships differ in many ways, the business dealings have set up a simple parallel.\n\n\u201cThey are criticizing the vice president\u2019s son for doing exactly what they are doing themselves,\u201d said Martin Ford, a member of the Aberdeenshire Council in Scotland, which voted last month to approve a proposal by the Trumps to build a 500-unit housing development. \u201cThey are conducting international business here in Scotland.\u201d\n\nEric Trump, in a statement to The New York Times, said there was a distinction between his father\u2019s career in business, with his recent turn to politics, and Biden\u2019s decades in public office.\n\n\u201cWhen my father became president, our family stopped doing international business deals,\u201d he said, a reference to a pledge by the Trump Organization not to begin new overseas projects during the Trump presidency. Hunter Biden, he said, did the opposite when his father became vice president.\n\nThe Trump business activities in India, Indonesia and Scotland were considered in compliance with the pledge, according to the company\u2019s ethics rules, because they were building on deals already in the works.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign declined to comment Friday. But in a tweet, the former vice president once again suggested that the attacks on his son were part of a political smear campaign. \u201cLet me make something clear to President Trump: I\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to destroy me. And you\u2019re not going to destroy my family. I don\u2019t care how dirty the attacks get.\u201d\n\nConducting business on the international stage has long been standard for the Trump Organization, which has placed the Trump name on hotels and towers in several countries.\n\nBut its international dealings have become far more complicated since Trump took office and his sons took leadership of the business, especially when foreign governments have been involved to the company\u2019s benefit.", "description": "Last month, the Trump family business received approval from a local government in Scotland for a major expansion of its golf resort near Aberdeen, marking the largest real estate development financed by the Trump Organization since the 2016 election.In August, President Donald Trump's eldest son", "authors": ["Eric Lipton", "Steve Eder", "Ben Protess"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/F4BGee5XzEBzYut6ja1OeA--~B/aD0zMzMwO3c9NTAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/5cf3d4d0-ecff-11e9-b2bf-1c84bc98d518", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
