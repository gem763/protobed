Fitch is also withdrawing the rating of class B notes because the debt-instrument rating has been taken private. The transaction is a securitisation of Australian conforming residential full-documentation mortgages originated by MyState Bank Limited. The notes were issued by Perpetual Trustee Company Limited in its capacity as trustee of the trusts. The transaction is a warehouse facility, featuring a multi-class structure that purchases receivables from the seller on a revolving basis. Purchased receivables are subject to eligibility criteria. The transaction has portfolio parameters in place to control the composition of the assets in the pool and triggers to protect the debt holders from deterioration in the credit quality of the portfolio, which must be rectified or it may cause an amortisation event in which all collections will be used to pay down the debt in sequential order.

Fitch undertook an onsite operational review and found that the operations of the servicer and originator were comparable with those of other Australian conforming lenders and there were no material changes that may affect the servicer's ongoing ability to undertake administration and collection activities. Asset Analysis: The asset model was not re-run, in accordance with Fitch's criteria. Asset composition and performance have not changed materially since the last asset-model analysis, cash flow distributions have been within Fitch's expectations since the last cash-flow model analysis and there have been no material changes to asset assumptions since the last asset-model analysis. The transaction has a revolving period. Therefore, Fitch's analysis is based on a proxy pool stressed to pool parameters. The parameters include limits on investment loans, interest-only loans and the weighted-average loan/value ratio. The 30+ and 90+ days' arrears, exclusive of loans in hardship, were 0.16% and 0.12%, respectively, at end-August 2019, tracking well below Fitch's 2Q19 conforming RMBS arrears of 1.17% and 0.59%, respectively. The transaction had hardship loans of 0.47% which were not included in the arrears figures. There has been one loss since closing, which was covered by lenders' mortgage insurance. Liability Analysis: Cash flow analysis was not performed, in accordance with Fitch's criteria. Asset composition and performance have not changed materially since the last asset-model analysis, cash flow distributions have been within Fitch's expectations since the last cash-flow model analysis and there have been no material changes to cash flow assumptions since the last cash-flow model analysis. Macroeconomic Factors: Fitch expects stable mortgage performance, supported by sustained economic growth in Australia and Tasmania, where there is a significant geographical concentration. Fitch forecasts steady GDP growth of 2.3% over 2020, stable labour markets and low interest rates in Australia. The Tasmanian state budget forecasts the gross state product to strengthen by 2.75% in the fiscal year ending 30 June 2020.. RATING SENSITIVITIES Not relevant as the ratings have been withdrawn. USE OF THIRD PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G -10 Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in relation to this rating action. DATA ADEQUACY Fitch has checked the consistency and plausibility of the information it has received about the performance of the asset pools and the transactions. There were no findings that were material to this analysis. Prior to the transaction closing, Fitch did not review the results of a third-party assessment conducted on the asset portfolio information. Fitch has not reviewed the results of any third-party assessment of the asset portfolio as part of its ongoing monitoring. As part of its ongoing monitoring, Fitch reviewed a small targeted sample of MyState's origination files and found the information contained in the reviewed files to be adequately consistent with the originator's policies and practices and the other information provided to the agency about the asset portfolio. Overall, Fitch's assessment of the asset pool information relied upon for the agency's rating analysis, according to its applicable rating methodologies, indicates that it is adequately reliable. SOURCES OF INFORMATION The information below was used in the analysis: - transaction reporting data at end-August 2019 provided by MyState; - loan enforcement details at end-August 2019 provided by MyState; and - discussions and updates from MyState in October 2019 The issuer has informed Fitch that not all relevant underlying information used in the analysis of the rated notes is public.

Reproduction or retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed. The information in this report is provided \"as is\" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers. For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale clients only.
