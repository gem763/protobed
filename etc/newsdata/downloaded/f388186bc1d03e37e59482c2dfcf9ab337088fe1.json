He was 23 of 32 for 338 yards and two touchdowns \u2014 a 92-yarder to Anderson and a 5-yarder to Ryan Griffin \u2014 and an interception.\n\nThe Jets put up 382 yards of total offense against the Cowboys after getting 233 combined in the last two games with practice squad player-turned-starter Luke Falk at quarterback.\n\nIt all resulted in New York's first win of the season, and first under coach Adam Gase.\n\n\"We've got to just continue to work out the details,\" Darnold said of the offense. \"Obviously, we got the win, which was awesome. Our defense played great. We played good at times, but there's a lot of things we can clean up.\n\n\"I think we left a lot of points on the field.\"\n\nStill, it was a huge positive step after the Jets \u2014 particularly the offense \u2014 barely resembled an NFL-caliber squad during Darnold's absence.\n\nIt was also proof that New York isn't exactly the bunch that people were making fun of the past three games during losses to Cleveland, New England and Philadelphia.\n\n\"We've got to build off each week, good or bad,\" Gase said. \"Those three weeks where Sam was out, those were some tough learning experiences for us. ... We really didn't give ourselves much of a chance.\"\n\nWHAT'S WORKING\n\nEverything, for the most part, seemed to be clicking with Darnold back in action. A big key was the offensive line, which was maligned for much of the first four games. It's still a work in progress as Gase tinkers with personnel, but the five big guys up front gave Darnold ample time to make plays against Dallas, and his ability to quickly improvise certainly helped.\n\nAfter allowing an NFL-leading 23 sacks through four games, the Jets' offensive line gave up just two \u2014 both by Robert Quinn \u2014 against the Cowboys.\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nThe running game. It seems silly to say that with Le'Veon Bell leading the way, but the Jets are averaging just 64 yards rushing per game. That ranks them 30th in the league, ahead of Miami (58.2) and Cincinnati (56.5).\n\nBell has run for 256 yards as a workhorse out of the backfield on 85 carries. But that's good for only a 3.0 average. With Darnold back and defenses unable to constantly stack the box anymore while not fearing New York's passing game, Bell and the rest of the Jets' backfield should start seeing some running lanes.\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nAnderson. The speedy receiver was mostly a non-factor through the first four games, catching 11 passes for 131 yards and no touchdowns.\n\nHe broke out with five receptions for 125 yards, including the 92-yard touchdown, in the win over Dallas. Having that deep threat is a huge key to the Jets' success by keeping defenses honest.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nLeonard Williams. The defensive lineman's name has come up in trade rumors, and Gase did little to defuse them. Teams are asking about him, but the Jets aren't actively shopping him \u2014 although a deal by the Oct. 29 deadline isn't out of the question.\n\n\"I really don't deal in the hypotheticals,\" Gase said, adding that GM Joe Douglas and his staff frequently get calls about players and potential trades and signings.\n\n\"I haven't had any of those conversations, so I don't know what other teams are thinking,\" he said. \"But right now, I like the way that our guys are rolling. Anything's always possible. Right now, I like how our team is.\"\n\nWilliams, the No. 6 overall pick in 2015, has no sacks this season and just two in his last 16 games.\n\nINJURED\n\nLeft tackle Kelvin Beachum has a sprained ankle that could sideline him a few games. Brandon Shell, formerly the starting right tackle, replaced him against Dallas and could do so while he's out. ... Linebacker C.J. Mosley has missed the last four games with a groin injury, but Gase expressed optimism that he could return to practice this week. ... Defensive end Henry Anderson (shoulder), cornerback Nate Hairston (knee), linebacker Neville Hewitt (stinger) and nose tackle Steve McLendon (hamstring) are day to day.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n92 \u2014 With his 92-yard touchdown toss to Anderson, Darnold became the youngest player in the Super Bowl era \u2014 at 22 years, 30 days old \u2014 to throw a TD pass of 90 or more yards. It was also the longest play from scrimmage in the NFL this season.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nThe Jets got their first win but take on AFC East rival \u2014 and undefeated \u2014 Patriots on Monday night. They'll be hard-pressed to pull off a two-game winning streak but should fare better than the 30-14 loss in New England three weeks ago with Falk making his first NFL start.\n\n\"It was good for the guys to go through it and see here's where we're at right now,\" Gase said. \"We've got to get better fast. We're not going to have a lot of room for error. We've got a tough opponent coming up this week, so we have to do a good job of finding a way of just getting better this week.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
