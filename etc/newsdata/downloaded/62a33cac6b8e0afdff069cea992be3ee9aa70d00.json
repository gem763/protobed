The game might dictate that you might sit back but we'll be going there looking for the win.'\n\n'You go into the game wanting to win and that won't change because of tonight's result.\n\nDenmark beat Switzerland and will host a Gibraltar side who have lost all five of their qualifiers\n\n'Playing for draws and stuff like that is dangerous anyway, so we always go out and try to win a game and Tuesday night will be no different.\n\n'We're going to play a top team but I believe in the lads and if we can be a little bit more composed, we can get a result.'\n\nSwitzerland have not lost a competitive match at home since Danny Welbeck scored twice to give England a 2-0 win in September 2014, picking up a 5-2 victory against top-ranked nation Belgium and a 2-0 win over Euro 2016 champions Portugal during that run.\n\nVladimir Petkovic's side can close the gap on Ireland to a point with two qualifying games left should they win, although Ireland would still be able to guarantee qualification with a win against Denmark in Dublin on November 18.\n\nColeman was encouraged by 19-year-old Aaron Connolly's international debut, watching the Brighton & Hove Albion striker go close twice after entering as a late substitute against Georgia.\n\nAaron Connolly was dejected not to have scored during a promising late debut for his country\n\n'He stretched them,' Coleman said of the youngster who scored twice in Brighton's 3-0 win at home to Tottenham in the Premier League before the international break.\n\n'He looked confident, he had a couple of chances - not clear-cut chances by any means, but he's dangerous.\n\n'He's a good lad, he's got that quiet confidence as well. Without putting too much pressure on him, we're delighted to have him and hopefully he can have a big future for us.'", "description": "Everton full-back Coleman, who saw his side almost snatch a win in Georgia, has called for an attacking performance against Switzerland, who are 17 ranking places ahead of Ireland.", "authors": ["Ben Miller For Mailonline", "Pa Sport Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/13/19653408-0-image-a-8_1570968637504.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
