The NHS says more than 100 babies in the UK die suddenly and unexpectedly every year in a tragic phenomenon sometimes known as \"cot death.\" The term Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is used to describe the sudden, unexplained death of an apparently health baby, usually within the first six months of its life.\n\n\n\nThe NHS infants born prematurely or with a low birthweight are at greater risk, and SIDS is slightly more common among baby boys. SIDS usually happens when a baby is asleep, which is how it came to be known as \"cot death.\" The NHS says there can be contributing factors, such as a parent smoking, a minor illness or breathing obstruction. There is also a link between co-sleeping and SIDs, and the NHS recommends not sharing a bed with your baby. NHS tips for ways parents can reduce the risk of SIDS: Do not smoke while pregnant or after your baby is born\n\nDo not sleep on a bed, sofa or armchair with your baby especially if either you or your partner smoke, drink or take drugs\n\nDo not let your baby get too hold or cold. The room temperature should be 16C-20C with lightweight bedding\n\nPlace your baby on their back while they sleep\n\nLet them sleep in the same room as you for the first six months\n\nEnsure their sleep environment won't cause your baby to become tangled in bedding\n\nUse a mattress that's firm, flat, waterproof and in good condition\n\nPlace your baby in the \"feet to foot\" position with their feet touching the end of their cot, Moses basket or pram\n\nKeep your baby's head uncovered - their blanket should be tucked no higher than their shoulders\n\nBreastfeed you baby if you can If you're worried about your baby at any point, see your GP or call NHS 111 for advice. Dial 999 for an ambulance if your baby: stops breathing or turns blue\n\nis struggling for breath\n\nis unconscious or seems unaware of what's going on\n\nwill not wake up\n\nhas a fit for the first time, even if they seem to recover\n\nShe has urged parents not to co-sleep with their children.\n\nMs Woodruff said: \"I agree with all the information that's out there. Be especially careful if your baby is tiny. Keep them in a cot. I know how hard it is not to keep them close.\"\n\nShe was helped through her grief by rekindling her passion for writing and publishing a book.\n\nThe mum also became fascinated with astrology, completed training in psychotherapy and now works as a healer, psychic and astrologer.\n\nShe runs her own business called Luna Attic, in Kelham Island, Sheffield, where she specialises in astrological birth charts and psychic and psychological services, courses and classes.", "description": "Laurie Woodruff, 30, blamed herself after her weeks-old son Arthur died of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) during a night feed at home in Chesterfield, Derbyshire", "authors": ["Sam Pickering", "Paul Whyatt", "Chris Kitching", "Image", "Derbyshirelive", "Supplied", "Handout"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20652334.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Mums-agony-at-babys-death-after-she-fell-asleep-breastfeedingIt-was-the-most-horrific-day-I-fe.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
