Here's how to find out", "language": "en", "text": "How much you pay in federal income taxes depends, in part, on what tax bracket you fall into.\n\nThere are seven tax brackets with tax rates ranging from 10% to 37%.\n\nYour tax bracket applies to only the amount you earn above the minimum income threshold for that bracket. For income below that limit, you pay the same amount of federal income taxes as everyone else, even if they earn less overall.\n\nRead more personal finance coverage.\n\nAmerica operates on a progressive tax system. That means as a person earns more and progresses through tax brackets, their income tax rate increases for each level of income.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's tax plan went into effect in January 2018, mandating new income tax brackets for nearly all American taxpayers. There are seven federal income tax brackets in total, which are adjusted each year for inflation.\n\nHow much you pay in income taxes depends on several factors, including whether you're single or married, and, of course, how much you earn. Below are the federal income tax brackets for income earned in 2019. Tax day 2020 \u2014 when taxes are due \u2014 is Wednesday, April 15.\n\nIf you earn $40,000 a year as a single filer, that puts you in the 22% tax bracket in 2019 \u2014 but while 22% of $40,000 is $8,800, you're not paying $8,800 in taxes.\n\nYour tax bracket applies to only the amount you earn above the minimum income threshold for that bracket. For income below that limit, you pay the same amount of federal income taxes as everyone else, even if they earn less overall.\n\nHere's how the calculation works for a single taxpayer in 2019:\n\nFigure out your taxable income: annual salary minus deduction(s). Everyone pays a 10% federal-income tax rate on their first $9,700 of taxable income. Everyone pays a 12% federal-income tax rate on their next $9,701 to $39,475 of taxable income. Everyone pays a 22% federal-income tax rate on their next $39,476 to $84,200 of taxable income. And so on and so forth.\n\nOne notable thing about this kind of tax setup is that the amount of taxes owed by someone steadily increases as that person's amount of income increases. It's not a monumental change when people jump from one tax bracket to another.\n\nLet's run through how this would work for an imaginary person: John, who earns $40,000. To keep it simple, let's say he makes all his money from his work salary and has no dependents.\n\nFor his 2019 taxes, John would subtract the standard deduction ($12,200) and take zero personal exemptions, since they were eliminated with the GOP tax law.\n\nThat makes his taxable income $27,800, putting him in the 12% tax bracket.\n\nHere's how to estimate how much he would owe in taxes:", "description": "How much you pay in income taxes depends on several factors, including whether you're single or married, and, of course, how much you earn.", "authors": ["Tanza Loudenback"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9698ed32bf0f04cd01a415?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
