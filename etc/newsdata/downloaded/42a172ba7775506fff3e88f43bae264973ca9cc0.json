But Labour is demanding that No 10 provide a full explanation for how the funds and favours were granted to Arcuri.\n\nJon Trickett, the shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, said: \u201cBoris Johnson must now give a full account of his actions in response to these grave and most serious allegations of the misuse use of public money in his former role as mayor of London.\u201d\n\nRory Stewart: \u2018If Boris Johnson gets a deal, my political career is over\u2019 Read more\n\nHe added: \u201cThe public has a right to know how and why these funds were used for the benefit of a close personal friend without on the face of it legitimate reason. This cannot be swept under the carpet. It is a matter of the integrity of the man now leading our country, who appears to believe he can get away with anything.\u201d\n\nArcuri\u2019s company Innotech was given \u00a310,000 in sponsorship from a mayoral organisation in 2013, the Sunday Times reports. Johnson was also the guest speaker at several of its events. At one he was appeared at Google hangout alongside Arcuri.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always happy to hang out at Innotech\u201d, the then mayor told Arcuri in 2014.\n\nA year later Arcuri won a \u00a315,000 grant under a government programme to encourage foreign entrepreneurs in the UK, the Sunday Times alleges.\n\nDespite Arcuri moving back to the US last year, earlier this year her latest company, Hacker House, won a \u00a3100,000 cyber skills grant intended to foster UK talent. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, which is responsible for the scheme, confirmed to the Guardian it was investigating how the payment was made. But it pointed out the funds were awarded to a UK-registered company.\n\nThe report also suggests that Arcuri was initially refused permission to attend two of the trade mission trips because her business did not meet the eligibility criteria. But after the intervention of Johnson she was allowed on to the missions, according to an email seen by the paper.\n\nIt points out that Johnson was bound by a Greater London Authority code of conduct to declare any private interests. He was also banned from providing undue benefits to friends.\n\nArcuri, now 34, was quoted by the Sunday Times as saying: \u201cAny grants received by my companies and any trade mission I joined were purely in respect of my role as a legitimate businesswoman.\u201d\n\nThere is precedent for members of the government being forced to resign over conflicts of interest. In 2011, the then defence secretary Liam Fox resigned after he was found to have procured high-level overseas meetings for his friend and adviser Adam Werrity.\n\nIn 2017 Priti Patel was forced to resign as international development secretary following a conflict of interest arising from secret meetings with the Israeli government. Patel was brought back into government in July when Johnson appointed her as home secretary.", "description": "PM allegedly gave money and access to trade missions to US entrepreneur Jennifer Arcuri while mayor", "authors": ["Matthew Weaver", "John Crace"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a96534b1cdb7f2e2a370c7fa77d3ed0e34856f9c/0_43_1000_600/master/1000.png?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=677d8ebc3ba063107ce39392f93e79da", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
