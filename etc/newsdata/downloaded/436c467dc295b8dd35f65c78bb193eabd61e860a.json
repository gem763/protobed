He has another 24 hours and then we\u2019ll make a firm diagnosis.\u201d\n\nIf Vunipola fails to pull through then Tom Curry or Mark Wilson will deputise in the back row, but his absence will still have a significant impact on England\u2019s ball carrying.\n\nTom Curry could come into the England side (Adam Davy/PA)\n\nMako Vunipola made his comeback from a hamstring injury against Argentina and would fill the void, but Hatley insists there are other options in the Red Rose ranks.\n\n\u201cWe plan for all eventualities and with what we have got in Ellis Genge, Mako Vunipola, Maro Itoje, Courtney Lawes and Kyle Sinckler, there are people to pick up the slack when Mako and Billy don\u2019t play,\u201d Hatley said.\n\n\u201cWe have played a lot of rugby without them. Billy is an important figure for us, but other people pick up the slack.\u201d", "description": "The England forward did not emerge for the second half against Argentina.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/07/wire-19382398-1570428515-365_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
