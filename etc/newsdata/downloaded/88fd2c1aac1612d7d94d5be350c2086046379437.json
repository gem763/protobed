Otherwise, he\u2019d kill me.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s Max Scherzer: intense, intensely private about pitching, intent on doing everything he can to win and prove anyone, or everyone, wrong. Talk to enough of his catchers since he began his college career \u2014 talk to 22 of them \u2014 and that\u2019s the pitcher who emerges.\n\nThe 35-year-old is and always has been at his best when told he can\u2019t do something. That includes food challenges at the University of Missouri. That includes minor league matchups with no one watching. And that will soon include the National League wild-card game, against the Milwaukee Brewers at 8:08 p.m. on Tuesday, Scherzer\u2019s next chance to lift the Washington Nationals and build his Hall of Fame r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\nThere was chatter of whether Scherzer or Stephen Strasburg should start for the Nationals in the one-game playoff. But Scherzer\u2019s catchers, past and present, saw why doubting him is dangerous. They saw it from right behind the plate.\n\n2004-06\n\nCOLLEGE YEARS\n\nMax Scherzer enrolled at the University of Missouri in the fall of 2003 as a top recruit from Parkway Central High. He didn\u2019t pitch much his freshman year, making just two starts, but he emerged with an 1.86 ERA in 106 innings during his sophomore season.\n\n\n\n(Courtesy of Mizzou Baseball)\n\nBrad Flanders\n\nUniversity of Missouri, 2004\n\nFlanders was a senior when the hard-thrower arrived at Missouri, itching to pitch. One day, the veterans challenged Scherzer to take down three Chipotle burritos in one sitting. \u201cJust because everyone said he couldn\u2019t do it,\u201d Flanders remembered before adding: \u201cAnd he didn\u2019t skimp on any of the toppings.\u201d\n\n\n\n(La Crosse Loggers Baseball Club)\n\nRich Russell\n\nLa Crosse Loggers, Northwoods League, 2004\n\nRussell, a catcher at Marshall University in the early 2000s, played for the La Crosse Loggers in the Northwoods League in the summer of 2004. Some of the country\u2019s best college talent gathers there each summer to compete in front of scouts. The Loggers needed a pitcher about a quarter of the way through the season. The coaches called Russell and gave him the address of a small high school gym in rural Wisconsin. They needed him to catch and evaluate a kid named Max Scherzer. Russell had never heard the name. The first thing Russell remembers is that Scherzer had different colored eyes \u2014 one brown, the other blue. Russell predicted he would throw in the high 80s or low 90s and that the Loggers would pass on Scherzer and pick up one of the studs from Cal Berkeley. But Scherzer threw much harder. Russell had trouble tracking the ball inside. And Scherzer made the team. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe a guy who threw that hard had such a good change-up and a nasty slider,\u201d said Russell, now a history teacher outside of Toronto. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t touch him.\u201d\n\n\n\n(Courtesy of Mizzou Baseball)\n\nJ.C. Field\n\nMissouri, 2005-06\n\nField got to campus a year after Scherzer, as a community college transfer, and heard the Scherzer buzz. He heard that Scherzer \u201cblew up\u201d in the Northwoods League. He heard, more than once, a tale that already was lore in the Missouri locker room: \u201cThis is the guy who apparently ate three burritos at one time,\u201d Field remembered thinking. \u201cSo that told me he wanted to be challenged on the mound.\u201d\n\n2007-09\n\nMINOR LEAGUES\n\nThe Arizona Diamondbacks selected Scherzer with the 11th pick in the 2006 draft. He signed with them about a year later, at 22, and began a minor league career that included three stops across two seasons.\n\nFrank Curreri\n\nVisalia Oaks, 2007; Tucson Sidewinders, 2009\n\nCurreri was Scherzer\u2019s first catcher after he signed with the Diamondbacks. They met with the Class A Visalia Oaks. Curreri was told he was needed to squat for a Scherzer bullpen session on the right-hander\u2019s first day in the quiet California town. Curreri expected Scherzer to be calm and shy while getting his bearings. He was wrong. \u201cWe figured it out day one,\u201d Curreri recalled. \u201cHe was down there barking at himself for throwing a change-up in the dirt.\u201d\n\nOrlando Mercado\n\nVisalia Oaks, 2007\n\nScherzer was untouchable June 12, 2007. The Visalia Oaks were facing the San Jose Giants. Pablo Sandoval was in the Giants\u2019 lineup. Scherzer, meanwhile, had a no-hitter through seven innings with Mercado behind the plate. But he hit his 90-pitch limit, a strict mandate from the major league front office, and Manager Hector de la Cruz came out to pull him. Scherzer was furious. He refused to give up the ball. But Mercado remembers de la Cruz pleading with Scherzer to leave the mound, and he eventually did. \u201c[Scherzer] was like: \u2018Come on, man. Give me another one!\u2019 \u201d Mercado recalled. \u201cThe manager was like: \u2018I understand. I have a job and two kids. I don\u2019t want to get fired here. You\u2019re, like, a top prospect.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\n\n(M. Spencer Green/Associated Press)\n\nJosh Ford\n\nVisalia Oaks, 2007\n\n\u201cYou knew little buttons to push with Max, little things that could spur him on,\u201d said Ford, who also matched up with Scherzer while playing at Baylor. \u201cInstead of 94, 95 [mph], you\u2019re going to get 96, 97. You just have to make a comment to him, \u2018Your stuff doesn\u2019t look that good,\u2019 and all of a sudden he would just blow guys away. \u2026 I also remember him trying to hit and taking massive swings in [batting practice] and telling our coach that he should be a pinch hitter.\u201d\n\n\n\n(M. Spencer Green/Associated Press)\n\nRobby Hammock\n\nTucson Sidewinders, 2008\n\nHammock can\u2019t recall the batter\u2019s name. He just knows the batter crushed fastballs. Everyone knew it. It was all over the scant scouting report passed around the Sidewinders\u2019 clubhouse in 2008. But Scherzer wanted to challenge the batter with all heaters, all up in the zone, all aimed at showing he could beat anyone with whatever he wanted. And he did. He struck him out on three fastballs. \u201cThat was a meaningless Triple-A game,\u201d said Hammock, now the Diamondbacks\u2019 catching coordinator. \u201cJust seeing that in the couple times I caught him, it was like, \u2018Wow, okay, this guy can do it.\u2019 It was part of the stubbornness.\u201d\n\nKonrad Schmidt\n\nVisalia Oaks, 2009\n\nSchmidt caught Scherzer one time, at the start of the 2009 season, because Scherzer needed a minor league tuneup before joining the Diamondbacks. Schmidt was excited to prove he could work with a major leaguer. The result of that outing wasn\u2019t all good. Scherzer pitched just 4\u2154 innings. But his fastball moved so late and came in so fast that Schmidt\u2019s glove was ripped to pieces. \u201cI didn\u2019t have an agent or equipment, but he tore the pocket out of my glove,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cI was kind of bummed about it because I couldn\u2019t afford another glove at the time. \u2026 It was the first game of the year, and I\u2019m coming into my single-A season with a broken glove. I\u2019m not talking about the laces. It tore the whole leather off it.\u201d\n\n2008-2009\n\nDIAMONDBACKS\n\nScherzer made 16 appearances, seven of them starts, in his first season with the Diamondbacks in 2008. He spent the rest of that year bouncing back and forth between the minors. He was young and certainly still developing and never got close to his full potential before Arizona traded him to the Detroit Tigers in December 2009.\n\nChris Snyder\n\nDiamondbacks, 2008-09\n\n\u201cHe had as a rookie what every pitcher wants now with their fastball,\u201d said Snyder, who caught Scherzer\u2019s major league debut against the Houston Astros on April 29, 2008. \u201cIt was hard and really just drove through the zone. The movement was great. If we were tracking spin rate then, I\u2019m sure it would have been great. He had a lot to work on. But the four-seam fastball was astounding from the start.\u201d\n\nLuke Carlin\n\nDiamondbacks, 2009\n\nCarlin was one of the Diamondbacks\u2019 backup catchers in 2009 and caught just one of Scherzer\u2019s starts that year. But they were close enough. That was until they passed each other during a charity golf tournament that offseason. Carlin tried to strike up a conversation. Scherzer, dialed in to winning, unwilling to turn his drive off, walked right past him. \u201cHe gave me the \u2018What\u2019s up?\u2019 and kept going,\u201d remembered Carlin, who now manages the Lake County Captains in the Cleveland Indians organization. \u201cI was like, \u2018Did he just big league me?!\u2019\u201d\n\nMiguel Montero\n\nTucson Sidewinders, 2008; Diamondbacks 2008-09\n\nBefore Montero was paired with Scherzer for parts of two seasons as the Diamondbacks\u2019 everyday catcher, he worked with him during a minor league rehab assignment. The organization wanted Montero\u2019s feedback on one of its top prospects. Scherzer didn\u2019t have his best stuff that day, and his slider was shaky, so Montero suggested he try throwing his change-up to right-handed hitters. Scherzer still does that when he\u2019s ahead in counts.\n\nMontero later saw Scherzer grow into a middle-of-the-rotation starter who was directionless in the weight room. He remembered the Diamondbacks trading him to the Tigers over shoulder concerns and was shocked how durable Scherzer became once he landed in Detroit. Scherzer has since made 30 or more starts in nine of 10 seasons. \u201cThey were scared he wasn\u2019t going to stay healthy,\u201d Montero said. \u201cI think that\u2019s why they traded him, and look how it ended up. I guess that wasn\u2019t a good trade.\"\n\n2010-14\n\nTIGERS\n\nThe Tigers acquired Scherzer in a three-team deal that, in hindsight, was a colossal steal. They got a pitcher who would win the Cy Young Award in 2013 and begin a run of seven consecutive all-star appearances.\n\nAlex Avila\n\nTigers, 2010-14\n\nIt was a regular June day at Kauffman Stadium in Kansas City in 2013. Scherzer was months from his first Cy Young Award but couldn\u2019t quite find his command against the Royals. Avila pondered how to get him on track. So he walked to the mound and offered a fantasy football trade. An intentionally bad one. Scherzer, confused for a moment, got fired up that Avila thought he would accept such a one-sided deal. He yelled a little. Then he threw seven innings to improve to 9-0. \u201cHe feeds off that type of adrenaline,\u201d said Avila, whose 107 games with Scherzer are the most of any catcher. \u201cAt first, it took him off guard, but he was absolutely into it.\u201d\n\nBryan Holaday\n\nTigers, 2012 and 2014\n\n\u201cHe was a little different back then,\u201d said Holaday, remembering his debut with the Tigers in 2012. The two have since become close friends and vacation together in the offseason. \u201cThey told me I was starting the next day, and I thought, \u2018If I catch anybody but Max, it\u2019ll be fine.\u2019 That spring training he was like a lunatic in the bullpen. He would throw a couple bad pitches, and he would start cussing and stomping around. And I couldn\u2019t tell if he was yelling at me. Sure enough, he was slated to throw that day. \u2026 That was a fun game to be my first one.\u201d\n\n\n\n(Courtesy of Brayan Pe\u00f1a)\n\nBrayan Pe\u00f1a\n\nTigers, 2013\n\nAt a random pitchers-and-catchers meeting in the summer of 2013, Pe\u00f1a remembers Scherzer telling him: \u201cPe\u00f1a, if I win the Cy Young, you\u2019re going to have a Rolex for Christmas.\u201d Pe\u00f1a laughed and didn\u2019t think much of it. He figured Scherzer was just messing around. But Scherzer won the Cy Young that October, and about a full calendar year later, Pe\u00f1a got a knock on his door. He had to sign for a FedEx package. He was now playing for the Cincinnati Reds. \u201cI opened the box, and I was like, \u2018Oh, my god,\u2019 \u201d Pe\u00f1a recalled. The Rolex arrived with a note. The beginning of it read, \u201cYou thought I forgot about you?\u201d\n\nVictor Martinez\n\nTigers, 2011 and 2014\n\nWhen Martinez first met Scherzer in Detroit, after the catcher spent the start of his career with the Cleveland Indians, he avoided Scherzer on start days. Pitchers don\u2019t like to be talked to or in some cases even looked at when they get ready to pitch. But Scherzer developed a start-day routine with Martinez\u2019s son, Victor Jr., from which he never strayed. He would take Victor Jr. into the outfield and throw him passes with a football. He also would send him on routes around the clubhouse. The kid was his good-luck charm. \u201cHe taught my son about the game of football. I don\u2019t know [expletive] about the game,\u201d Martinez said. He and Victor Jr. laughed in the car this September, near their home in Orlando, as they remembered those times. \u201cI was clueless about football,\u201d Victor Jr. added. \u201c[Scherzer] took me to my first game.\u201d\n\n2015-present\n\nNATIONALS\n\nThe Nationals signed Scherzer to a seven-year, $210 million contract in January 2015. The deal came as a surprise given that Washington already had Stephen Strasburg, Jordan Zimmermann and Doug Fister in its rotation. But now the Nationals had an unquestioned ace who since has become a franchise cornerstone.\n\n\n\n(John McDonnell/The Washington Post)\n\nWilson Ramos\n\nNationals, 2015-16\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll never forget when he first got to the team in 2015, and he takes me into a small room at the spring training complex,\u201d Ramos recalled at his locker in the visitors\u2019 clubhouse at Nationals Park in September. He plays for the New York Mets now. He smiled, almost wistfully, before offering the next part. \u201cHe looked at me very seriously and goes: \u2018I don\u2019t want to ever have to shake you off. Ever. You need to be on the same page as me all the time.\u2019 And, you know, I think it worked out for us. Two no-hitters and a 20-strikeout game together.\u201d\n\nJose Lobaton\n\nNationals, 2015-17\n\n\u201cHe had a plan for everybody. You just have to follow that plan and what he likes to do early and late,\u201d said Lobaton, now in the Los Angeles Dodgers organization, adding that Scherzer got him two watches: one for helping get his second Cy Young Award and a second for suggesting a small tweak two starts before Scherzer\u2019s first no-hitter. \u201cIt was harder for me with the signs. With a runner on second, he used a lot of stuff [to avoid sign stealing]. Really weird. That was the only hard part for me. The rest was just making the pitches look good and being on the same page.\u201d\n\n\n\n(Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\n\nPedro Severino\n\nNationals, 2016 and 2018\n\n\u201cI just got called up in 2015. I learned a lot that year,\u201d Severino, now with the Baltimore Orioles, said of first working with Scherzer. \u201cI was in the dugout almost every night, and he would sit close to me and ask: \u2018What pitch would you call in this situation? What pitch in this count?\u2019 It\u2019s like a real game but in the dugout. He started teaching me a lot about pitching and what pitch to call.\u201d\n\n\n\n(Jeff Roberson, Associated Press)\n\nMatt Wieters\n\nNationals, 2017-18\n\n\u201cI had great numbers against him until he started throwing a cutter,\u201d Wieters said, laughing, of facing Scherzer before he became his regular catcher in 2017. \u201cI first caught Max when we were on Team USA in college. You knew about the fastball. You sat on the heat because if not it would just whiz by you. But then came the cutter. I\u2019d be waiting for something and one time the ball literally hit my back foot. And I still swung.\u201d\n\n\n\n(Katherine Frey/The Washington Post)\n\nSpencer Kieboom\n\nNationals, 2018\n\n\u201cI once went to high-five him during a spring training start, and he just walked right past me. I didn\u2019t know that wasn\u2019t allowed,\u201d Kieboom remembered with a laugh. \u201cLater, when he was out of the game, he came up to me, and he goes: \u2018Sorry, I just don\u2019t do that. I am in the zone. I\u2019m pitching.\u2019 It\u2019s easy to imagine Max at 75 years old going all out in a game of bocce or something. And nothing will have changed.\u201d\n\nYan Gomes\n\nNationals, 2019\n\n\u201cI looked at him and asked, \u2018You\u2019re not going to pitch like that, right?\u2019 \u201d Gomes said of when Scherzer started and tossed seven scoreless innings with a broken nose June 19. He suffered the injury while attempting a bunt in batting practice. \u201cHis face was covered in bruises. There was a ton of blood when it first happened. Everyone was staring at him like, \u2018There\u2019s just no way.\u2019 But he went out there and dominated. I think, more than anything, it was because we all thought he shouldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\n\n(Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\n\nKurt Suzuki\n\nNationals, 2019\n\nA lot stands out to Suzuki from his first year catching Scherzer. They have been inseparable since early May, always around each other in the dugout, always talking sequences and scouting reports and how they can gain an edge. But of all that Suzuki has seen, on the field and off, he\u2019s most excited for what Scherzer could do next. \u201cYou\u2019re almost overconfident with him on the mound,\u201d Suzuki said of Scherzer starting the wild-card game for Washington. \u201cThere\u2019s not a pitcher on the planet that you\u2019d want instead of him in a one-game playoff. Guys start talking: \u2018We have Max. We\u2019ll be okay.\u2019 That\u2019s what it\u2019s like when you have the best.\u201d\n\nTop photos by Getty Images.
