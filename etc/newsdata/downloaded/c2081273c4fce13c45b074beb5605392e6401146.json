Opioids can cause a person to stop breathing enough to stay alive, while benzodiazepines can sedate someone to the point of passing out.\n\nEtizolam can be mixed with opioids such as fentanyl, shown here. Taking a combination of the two drugs can make reversing an overdose even more challenging. (CBC)\n\nIn Ottawa, drug users have reported taking benzodiazepines over the last several months, said Wendy Muckle, CEO of Ottawa Inner City Health.\n\n\"It's like a warm blanket over your brain,\" Muckle said, describing the effects of benzodiazepine abuse.\n\n\"You can understand that people who have had for example a history of trauma, whose brains are always fired up, would really enjoy that feeling of allowing their brains to relax.\"\n\nNaloxone has no effect\n\nBoth Muckle and Moore stressed the importance of calling 911 at the first signs of overdose including loss of colour and slow breathing. Benzodiazepine overdose can only be treated in hospital, and patients needs help right away to avoid organ damage or potential death.\n\n\"The paramedics will come and transport you to where you can get help, but they also come with oxygen and with the ability to take over for the body when the body can't really support itself,\" Muckle said.\n\nWhile naloxone kits can help reverse an opiod overdose, the antidote has no effect on etizolam overdose.\n\nBenzodiazepines like etizolam may be found in pill form on the street or mixed with an opioid that can come in a pill, powder, small chunks or crumbs, Muckle said.\n\nIn April, overdose and addictions experts in British Columbia warned of the presence of etizolam in drug cocktails, which made it more difficult to revive people suffering overdoses.", "description": "A drug that's 10 times more toxic than Valium and is often mixed with powerful opioids has killed at least five people this year in Ontario, and\u00a0public health officials worry there may be more deaths.", "authors": ["Laura Glowacki Is A Reporter Based In Ottawa", "Winnipeg.
