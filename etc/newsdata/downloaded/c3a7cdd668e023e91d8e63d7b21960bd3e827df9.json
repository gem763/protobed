Animals today often have elaborate thermoregulatory strategies to protect these tissues by shuttling hot and cool blood around various networks of blood vessels. We wanted to see if dinosaurs were doing the same things.\u2019\n\nFamous gigantic dinosaurs such as the long-necked sauropods or armoured ankylosaurs evolved big bodies independently from smaller-bodied ancestors.\n\nCo-author Professor Lawrence Witmer said: \u2018Small dinosaurs could have just run into the shade to cool off. But for those giant dinosaurs, the potential for overheating was literally inescapable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018They must have had special mechanisms to control brain temperature, but what were they?\u2019\n\nProfessor Porter said: \u2018One of the best ways to cool things down is with evaporation. The air-conditioning units in buildings and cars use evaporation, and it\u2019s the evaporative cooling of sweat that keeps us comfortable in summer.\n\n\u2018To cool the brain, we looked to the anatomical places where there\u2019s moisture to allow evaporative cooling, such as the eyes and especially the nasal cavity and mouth.\u2019\n\nSo the researchers, from Ohio University, looked to the modern-day relatives of dinosaurs \u2013 birds and reptiles. This showed evaporation of moisture in the nose, mouth, and eyes cooled the blood on its way to the brain.\n\nThe researchers obtained carcasses of birds and reptiles that had died of natural causes from zoos and wildlife rehabilitation facilities. Using a special CT scanning technique that highlights arteries and veins, they traced blood flow from the sites of evaporative cooling to the brain.\n\nThey also precisely measured the bony canals and grooves that conveyed the blood vessels.\n\nProf Porter said: \u2018The handy thing about blood vessels is that they basically write their presence into the bones. The bony canals and grooves that we see in modern-day birds and reptiles are our link to the dinosaur fossils.\n\n\u2018We can use this bony evidence to restore the patterns of blood flow in extinct dinosaurs and hopefully get a glimpse into their thermal physiology and how they dealt with heat.\u2019\n\n\u2018Dippy\u2019 is the famous Diplodocus fossil shown here at the Natural History Museum in 2017 (Getty)\n\nThe findings published in Anatomical Record show \u2018one size didn\u2019t fit all\u2019 with regard to how large-bodied dinosaurs kept their brains cool. Smaller dinosaurs such as the goat-sized pachycephalosaur Stegoceras had a very balanced vascular pattern with no single cooling region being particularly emphasised.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProf Porter said: \u2018That makes physiological sense because smaller dinosaurs have less of a problem with overheating. But giants like sauropods and ankylosaurs increased blood flow to particular cooling regions of the head far beyond what was necessary to simply nourish the tissues.\u2019\n\nThis unbalanced vascular pattern allowed the thermal strategies of large dinosaurs to be more focused.\n\nSauropods like Diplodocus and Camarasaurus emphasised both the nasal cavity and mouth as cooling regions \u2013 and ankylosaurs such as Euoplocephalus only the former.\n\nProf Porter said: \u2018It\u2019s possible that sauropods were so large \u2013 often weighing dozens of tons \u2013 that they needed to recruit the mouth as a cooling region in times of heat stress.\u2019\n\nOne problem that the researchers encountered was that many of the theropod dinosaurs \u2013 such as the 10-ton T Rex \u2013 were also gigantic. But the analysis showed they had a balanced vascular pattern \u2013 like the small-bodied dinosaurs. Prof Witmer said: \u2018This finding had us scratching our heads until we noticed the obvious difference \u2013 theropods like Majungasaurus and T Rex had a huge air sinus in their snouts.\u2019\n\nLooking closely at the bones showed it was richly supplied with blood vessels \u2013 pumping air in and out every time the animal opened and closed its mouth.\n\nProf Witmer added: \u2018Boom! An actively ventilated, highly vascular sinus meant we had another potential cooling region. Theropod dinosaurs solved the same problem \u2013 but in a different way.\u2019", "description": "Scientists used 3D modelling to uncover the answer", "authors": ["Metro Science Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_90162403_1571239225.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
