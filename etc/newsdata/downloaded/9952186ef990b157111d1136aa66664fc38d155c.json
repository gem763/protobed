Retail, catering, tourism and hotels had been severely hit, with some 600,000 people affected, she added.\n\nThe protests, which show no sign of abating, pose the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012 and are Hong Kong's thorniest political crisis since Britain returned it to China in 1997.\n\nWhat started as opposition to a now-withdrawn extradition bill has grown into a pro-democracy movement against what is seen as Beijing's increasing grip on the city, which protesters say undermines a \"one country, two systems\" formula promised when Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997.\n\nChina dismisses such accusations, saying foreign governments, including Britain and the United States, have fanned anti-China sentiment.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that if anything bad happened in Hong Kong it would be bad for the U.S.-China trade talks.\n\nAnd an increasing number of U.S. lawmakers voiced anger on Monday over the National Basketball Association's response to a Houston Rockets official's tweet backing the protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n'EXTRA THINGS'\n\nLam, who has said she must serve both the central government and the people of Hong Kong, was in Beijing last week for Oct. 1 National Day celebrations but said she did not meet any central government officials to discuss \"business\".\n\nAsked under what circumstances she would call upon Beijing for help to quell the protests, Lam said Hong Kong should be able to find solutions on its own to manage the crisis.\n\n\"I cannot tell you categorically now under what circumstances we will do extra things, including ... calling on the central government to help,\" she said.\n\nOn Sunday, personnel inside a People's Liberation Army barracks in the territory issued warnings to protesters who had shined laser pointers at the building. It was the first time the Chinese military had engaged with the demonstrators.\n\nOn Friday, Lam invoked the emergency powers for the first time in more than 50 years to outlaw face masks, which protesters have used to shield their identities.\n\nBut the move inflamed demonstrations over the weekend and thousands took to the streets wearing masks in defiance. Rallies deteriorated into running clashes with police firing tear gas and charging with batons to disperse protesters across the city.\n\nTwo teenage protesters have been shot and wounded, one in the chest and the other in the leg, during skirmishes with police in some of the recent violence.\n\nATMs, Chinese banks and scores of shops were vandalised during protests over the long weekend. Many restaurants and malls closed early over what is typically a very busy holiday period.\n\nHong Kong's metro, which carries about 5 million passengers a day, said on Tuesday some stations would not open for service because damaged facilities needed to be repaired. Train service would also end at 8 p.m. (1200 GMT), more than four hours earlier than normal.", "description": "Hong Kong's embattled leader Carrie Lam said on Tuesday her administration had no plans to use colonial-era emergency powers to introduce new laws, after a long weekend of violent protests saw widespread defiance of a ban on face masks.
