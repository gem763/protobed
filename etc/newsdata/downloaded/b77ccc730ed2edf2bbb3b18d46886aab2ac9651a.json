And fans will be paying more, especially at the high end.\n\nLong one of the concert industry\u2019s biggest acts, Madonna will open her latest tour, called \u201cMadame X,\u201d at Brooklyn Academy of Music\u2019s Howard Gilman Opera House, which seats 2,100 people\u2014a fraction of the roughly 20,000 capacity of New York\u2019s Madison Square Garden, where she played two shows four years ago on her last tour.\n\nThe prices will be higher: Around $300 on average, according to Arthur Fogel, Madonna\u2019s longtime tour promoter and the president of global touring at Live Nation, the world\u2019s biggest concert promoter. That\u2019s up from about $160 for the last tour, according to Pollstar, a concert-industry trade publication.\n\nThe rise is due largely to an increase at the higher end. Tickets for \u201cMadame X\u201d start at about $50 for the cheapest seats, not much more than her last tour. But she\u2019s charging roughly $750 for the costliest non-VIP tickets, not including fees\u2014substantially higher than the $350 tickets on her last three tours, according to Mr. Fogel. VIP packages, which can include perks like pre-show receptions and backstage tours, reach as high as about $2,000.\n\n\u201cMadonna\u2019s going to charge you what the market says those tickets are worth\u2014and then, at the same time, she\u2019s keeping her cheap seats,\u201d says Bill Werde, a former editor of Billboard magazine and the director of Syracuse University\u2019s Bandier music-industry program. \u201cI actually think this is a brilliant example of understanding the market.\u201d\n\nMadonna declined a request for an interview.\n\nThe \u201cMaterial Girl\u201d singer\u2019s ticket prices reflect a growing comfort among superstars with charging more-affluent fans what they can bear. While some holdouts like Ed Sheeran are keeping concert prices relatively low, stars from Jay-Z to Taylor Swift have been raising ticket prices in recent years, accentuating a trend that began when profits on recorded music were squeezed by digital forces like piracy, downloads and streaming.\n\nBy making premium tickets more expensive, superstars capture ticket-sales revenue that might otherwise go to scalpers, who snatch up desirable seats, mark them up and flip them for profit. The downside is expensive tickets can take longer to sell and prevent instant sellouts. \u201cFans are paying these prices no matter what,\u201d Mr. Werde says. \u201cI would prefer to see the money go to the legitimate music industry rather than to scalpers.\u201d\n\nTo compensate for the smaller venues, and satisfy the still-sizeable demand for her elaborate shows, Madonna is embarking on a series of extended runs in 11 U.S. and European cities, including 17 shows in Brooklyn and 15 in London. It amounts to something like a string of residencies, when stars play one venue in Las Vegas or elsewhere for a period of time.\n\nPerforming multiple small shows in one city can reduce stage set-up and take-down costs, which are typically borne by artists themselves, out of the fees they receive from concert promoters. These lower costs, in turn, pad profit margins.\n\nHistorically, residencies were mostly associated with past-their-peak performers. But that idea has faded. Today\u2019s hip-hop stars, for instance, often see Vegas residencies as a sign of clout, not career decline. And Bruce Springsteen \u2019s \u201cSpringsteen on Broadway\u201d\u2014a twist on the residency model\u2014proved artists could use residencies to offer something different. At the same time, aging acts like the Rolling Stones are opting for short stints of touring rather than stationary residencies or grueling global treks.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not just one way to do this anymore,\u201d Mr. Werde says. \u201cYou\u2019re starting to see [older stars] doing what they want to do\u2014what makes sense for their lives.\u201d\n\nShare Your Thoughts Would you pay a premium for a more intimate setting with an artist? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\n\nSome fans have groused about Madonna\u2019s high prices on social media. But for others, seeing Madonna in a theater for the first time may justify the expense, experts say. The average ticket price for \u201cSpringsteen on Broadway\u201d\u2014also an intimate theater affair\u2014was $506, according to Pollstar.\n\n\u201cEspecially in the wake of Springsteen and \u2018Hamilton\u2019 on Broadway, I don\u2019t think they need to be concerned about blowback,\u201d says Larry Miller, who heads the music-business program at New York University\u2019s Steinhardt School. \u201cFans will understand this is a super-special event.\u201d\n\nSome 98% of Madonna\u2019s Brooklyn tickets have been sold, as of last Thursday, according to Mr. Fogel.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s virtually zero risk of unsold inventory,\u201d New York University\u2019s Mr. Miller says. \u201cIf you need to be there, you\u2019re going to pay almost anything.\u201d\n\nWrite to Neil Shah at neil.shah@wsj.com", "description": "Her latest tour, which opens Tuesday, is planned around theaters rather than arenas, and fans will be paying more\u2014especially at the high end.", "authors": ["Neil Shah", "Neil.Shah Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107020/social", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
