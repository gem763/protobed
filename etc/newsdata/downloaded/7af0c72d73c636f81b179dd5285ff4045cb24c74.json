Critics also took issue with her claim that those posts -- described as \"homophobic\" -- came from a third party that allegedly hacked her site.\n\nThe Daily Beast, which had suspended Reid as a contributor, conducted its own investigation and concluded that claims made by Reid\u2019s cyber-security expert Jonathan Nichols that \u201cscreenshot manipulation\u201d took place were false.\n\nCritics have also pointed to the Internet archival service The Wayback Machine, which showed that the anti-gay articles were preserved at the time they were written and refuted the suggestion that hackers could have manipulated the archives.\n\nDespite the controversy, Reid appeared to win support from many of her colleagues in the media. Trump's Saturday tweet prompted a wave of responses from Twitter users in defense of the host.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nActress Mia Farrow responded to Trump's tweet with a link to Reid's book. Former Rep. Joe Walsh, who's challenging Trump for the 2020 Republican nomination, criticized the president for attacking \"a private citizen.\"\n\n\"Whereby the President of the United States once again personally attacks a private citizen. This time @JoyAnnReid. Trump will lose in 2020 because we can do much better than having such an unfit, thin-skinned, cruel, narcissistic bully in the White House,\" he tweeted.\n\nFox News' Joseph A.
