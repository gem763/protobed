Personnel may wear a clear or pale nail varnish whilst in uniform. False eye lashes may [also] be worn provided that they are trimmed, neat and natural in appearance,\u201d according to Proctor.\n\nSTOCK PHOTO/Getty Images\n\nAs far as jewelry is concerned, \u201crings may be worn on a maximum of two fingers,\u201d as well as \u201cone pair of stud/sleeper type earrings, one in each earlobe, when in uniform. Earrings are to be of a natural color to a maximum of five millimeters in diameter.\u201d No other body piercings will be allowed.\n\nMale and female personnel will also have gender-neutral hair guidelines which means that \u201clong hair can be worn in a bun \u2026 [or] can be in a single plait,\u201d according to the new guidelines.\n\nPersonnel can also wear \u201cplain hair clips, elastic bands or hair nets\u201d as long as they are not colourful and are unobtrusive. Hair ornaments such as \u201cribbons, headbands or \u2018scrunchies\u2019 are not to be worn,\u201d said Proctor.\n\nThese new changes will take effect as of Nov. 1 this year.\n\nProctor added: \u201cThe RNZN is a modern and professional organization that embraces individuality and personality. However, we are a military organization and with that comes certain expectations on our personnel in terms of their dress and appearance. These changes reflect that diversity and inclusion are critical to our success as an organisation, as are the unique traditions and characteristics of the RNZN.\u201d\n\nWhile men and women in the navy will now be able to wear makeup, nail polish, and eyelashes if they so choose, Proctor isn\u2019t concerned about the loosening up of previous regulations.\n\n\u201cGrooming standards are based on several elements including neatness, cleanliness, safety and military image. These standards are designed to present an inclusive, professional military image,\u201d he said.", "description": "The New Zealand Defense Force has released new gender-neutral guidelines around grooming and appearance for Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) personnel.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/nz-flag-rf-gty-ml-191023_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
