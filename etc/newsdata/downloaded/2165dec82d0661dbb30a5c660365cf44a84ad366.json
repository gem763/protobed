The drink is on track to expand nationwide by the end of 2019.\n\nHowever, cold brew lovers have slowly started to notice they can\u2019t get their Nitro-fix supersized (or, in Starbucks speak, venti-sized).\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe quandary has led to a slew of conspiracy theories suggesting it\u2019s the frothy beverage\u2019s caffeine levels, or it\u2019s Starbucks trying to prevent customers from \u201cgetting such a good deal\u201d on the cold brew by limiting the sizes they can purchase, seeing as the Nitro Cold Brew is served without ice, unlike the other cold brew or iced coffee options.\n\nHowever, a spokesperson for the coffee mega-chain told Fox News that the caffeine content \u2013 which clocks in at 280 milligrams for a grande, and is nowhere near the most caffeinated option at the store \u2013 is not the issue. It\u2019s the way the product is made that is the issue.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nThe statement from Starbucks to Fox News claimed Nitro Cold Brew is only served in tall and grande sizes to offer customers \u201cthe best experience of the beverage\u201d as with venti sizes, the drink loses its \u201cnitro cascade\u201d \u2013 meaning the drink loses the creamy, frothy texture and \"cascade of bubbles\" that makes the Nitro version different from its cold-brewed counterparts.\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\nSo, for now, you\u2019ll just need to buy a 12 oz. tall and an 8 oz. short to equal the 20 oz. venti \u2013 or swap out coffee altogether.", "description": "No \u2013 it\u2019s not because of the caffeine.", "authors": ["Alexandra Deabler", "Alexandra Deabler Is A Lifestyle Writer", "Editor For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/nitro-starbucks.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
