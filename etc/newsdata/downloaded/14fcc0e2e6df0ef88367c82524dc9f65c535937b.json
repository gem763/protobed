They have great market positions, they have a large agent network, they have very deep customer relationships, they have great brands over there.\"\n\nThe deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020 pending regulatory approvals.\n\nPeachtree City, Ga.-based Cooper Lighting Solutionst sells professional lighting and controls under the Corelite, Halo, McGraw-Edison and Metalux brands.\n\nIt reported 2018 sales of $1.7 billion, and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $187 million.\n\nING analyst Marc Hesselink, who rates Signify shares at \"hold\", said the deal was a \"good strategic fit for Signify and price paid seems reasonable.\"\n\nStill, Cooper would not add technology or new capabilities to Signify's portfolio and the deal would not really change the growth or margin profile of the company, he said.\n\nSignify said it intends to keep dividends steady or increase them after the acquisition, but its main focus will be to reduce debt of the combined company from two times net debt to EBITDA to one time in the next three years.\n\nDuring that time Signify will make further merger and acquisition activity less of a priority, Rougeot said.\n\n(Editing by Deepa Babington)", "description": "AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Signify <LIGHT.AS>, the Dutch-based lighting company, has agreed to buy U.S. firm Cooper Lighting Solutions from Eaton Corp. for $1.4 billion in cash to boost its presence in North America.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
