We are proud to say that more than 20,000 hotel properties have committed to our promise of safety and security for employees and guests. https://t.co/yVRhJPZ7qs \u2014 AHLA (@AHLA) October 7, 2019\n\nLast year, 17 hotel companies, including Marriott, Hyatt, Hilton and IHG, signed the AHLA\u2019s 5-Star Promise, a voluntary commitment to improve policies, trainings and resources related to employee safety.\n\nAHLA said an additional 39 companies have since signed the pledge.\n\n\u201cAs an industry of people taking care of people, we have always been deeply committed to safety and security for our employees and guests. We have a responsibility to ensure they feel safe and secure,\u201d Chip Rogers, the group\u2019s president, said in a statement. \u201cI\u2019m proud of the progress we have made as an industry over the past year, and we will continue our efforts to ensure America\u2019s hotels are safe places for all those who work in and visit them.\u201d\n\nAs the Los Angeles Times noted, leaders of unions that represent hotel workers lauded AHLA\u2019s announcement as a positive step forward, but said hotels need to ensure that the safety devices being provided to employees will actually be helpful.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a step in the right direction but it\u2019s no guarantee to bring help unless it\u2019s a real panic system,\u201d Kurt Petersen, a spokesman for Unite Here Local 11, which represents 30,000 hospitality workers in California and Arizona, told the paper.\n\nDevices that merely emit a loud noise like a whistle may not be effective if the employee in need is in an isolated part of the hotel, the LA Times noted. AHLA\u2019s pledge does not include a strict definition of what kind of safety device hotels should provide.\n\nMiami Beach passed the panic button law during #MeToo in July 2018. The hotel industry won a delay & the city prolonged confusion about the kind of tech required.\n\n\n\nEvery hotel housekeeper & room attendant has to have a panic button by today, Sept. 15.https://t.co/VhY0Fypcto \u2014 Taylor Dolven \ud83c\udfdd\ufe0f (@taydolven) September 15, 2019\n\nStates like Washington and New Jersey, as well as several cities including New York and Miami Beach, have recently passed legislation requiring at least some hotel workers to be given panic buttons at work. Though industry insiders and labor activists appear to agree that such devices can be effective in protecting hotel employees, some activists have urged hotels to also punish guests accused of sexual misconduct as a way to deter such behavior \u2015 a step that hotel companies have been unwilling to take.\n\nThough AHLA did not specify this week which hotels had already rolled out safety devices to their workers, Marriott has vowed to put a system in place that will allow employees to \u201cpress a button that will summon help if they feel their safety is threatened or if they encounter an emergency situation while at work.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have identified preferred technology vendors and will have fully activated systems in at least nine major markets across the region by the end of 2019,\u201d Marriott said in its pledge to AHLA, adding that it intends to \u201cwork toward full deployment\u201d by the end of 2020.\n\nHilton said it has deployed employee safety devices at its hotels in New York City; Washington, D.C.; Seattle; and Chicago.\n\nWyndham, which owns several hotel brands including La Quinta Inns, Ramada and Super 8, said it expects to \u201cdeploy safety devices to our managed team members and to make safety device options available to our franchise community in the third quarter of 2019.\u201d", "description": "The American Hotel & Lodging Association, whose members include Marriott and Hilton, said workers have received panic buttons and anti-harassment training.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9c545d2100002504338115.jpeg?cache=ppkk0mzy2m&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
