Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Dan Crenshaw got into a social-media spat this week about universal background checks ruining the ability to loan guns to friends.\n\nThe confrontation began on Twitter when Mr. Crenshaw, a Texas Republican, tweeted support for the Second Amendment on Tuesday in response to a Houston news story about a woman using her gun to prevent a robbery.\n\n\u201cSituations like this story are why we protect the 2nd Amendment. Side note: With universal background checks, I wouldn\u2019t be able to let my friends borrow my handgun when they travel alone like this. We would make felons out of people just for defending themselves,\u201d he said.\n\nMs. Ocasio-Cortez followed up Mr. Crenshaw\u2019s comment Wednesday, asking why he would loan guns to someone who can\u2019t pass a background check.\n\n\u201cYou are a member of Congress. Why are you \u2018lending\u2019 guns to people unsupervised who can\u2019t pass a basic background check? The people you\u2019re giving a gun to have likely abused their spouse or have a violent criminal record, & you may not know it. Why on earth would you do that?\u201d the New York Democrat said.\n\nMr. Crenshaw hit back hours later, asking whether the basis of her argument is that his friends might use the gun for nefarious purposes.\n\n\u201cJust so I\u2019m clear: you think my friends are domestic abusers/criminals? Seriously that\u2019s your argument? That they can\u2019t pass a background check? Wrong. People lend guns to friends, esp if they don\u2019t own a gun, for self-defense and hunting purposes. This is America outside NYC,\u201d he said.\n\nMs. Ocasio-Cortez responded: \u201cYou said w/ universal background checks, you wouldn\u2019t be able to \u2018lend\u2019 guns to friends. If a background check would be a problem, then you shouldn\u2019t \u2018lend\u2019 a gun. And btw, NY is one of the safest states in the country when it comes to guns, incl rural areas. Try to keep up.\u201d\n\n\u201cHerein lies an important point abt domestic abuse: most of it is hidden. You could know an abuser & have no clue. I\u2019ve had friends come out to me as victims. It\u2019s not obvious. Unsafe relationships are COMMON. That\u2019s why House Dems passed closing the boyfriend loophole in VAWA,\u201d she continued, referencing the Violence Against Women Act, which passed the House in April and has yet to be picked up in the Senate.\n\nThe \u201cboyfriend loophole\u201d is a domestic abuse provision which would prevent those dating partners convicted of abuse from obtaining a gun, which is already extended to married and recently divorced couples.\n\nAs of this publication, Mr. Crenshaw has yet to respond to Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s latest tweet.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers and presidential candidates have heightened their calls for something to be done about gun violence after mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, Dayton, Ohio, and Odessa, Texas, left more than 30 people dead.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
