Instead, it was visitors Crystal Palace who moved temporarily into the top four, a surprisingly lofty position at this stage of the season for a club who have recently been slow starters.\n\nPart of the difference this time is the presence of Gary Cahill. The 33-year-old was released in June by Chelsea, where he made only two Premier League appearances last season, and his league games for Palace have brought four wins, a draw and two clean sheets, as well as the club\u2019s player of the month award for September. He was the logical choice on Saturday to take over the captaincy from the suspended Luka Milivojevic and it was a sign of his influence that the Serb was barely missed.\n\nAt first glance, the centre of defence was not an area of their team where Palace needed reinforcements, but the chance to add a player with Cahill\u2019s record of success \u2013 two Premier League titles, two FA Cups, and a Champions League victory for starters, as well as 61 England caps \u2013 was too good to pass up.\n\n\u201cHe has been very good and I knew he would be very good,\u201d said Roy Hodgson, the Palace manager, who had Cahill under his wing when England head coach.\n\n\u201cWhen we signed him, we knew that both Mamadou Sakho and James Tomkins, who were outstanding last year, were going to be a while before they could come back. This club has been incredibly blessed with the quality of play from centre-backs for a period of time now.", "description": "The pre-match buzz around the London Stadium on Saturday concerned the possibility of West Ham United moving into third place in the Premier League.", "authors": ["Nick Szczepanik", "Luke Edwards", "Sam Wallace"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/06/TELEMMGLPICT000212120797-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqJN8gKE-i8DbyxNsC4odhn_YMzgNGwIGFqtaZw0zG4o.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
