In the final weeks of his campaign he has been doling out hard-line promises meant to draw more voters to his Likud party and re-elect him in Tuesday's unprecedented repeat vote.\n\n\"I intend to extend sovereignty on all the settlements and the (settlement) blocs,\" including \"sites that have security importance or are important to Israel's heritage,\" Netanyahu said in an interview with Israeli Army Radio, part of an eleventh-hour media blitz.\n\nAsked if that included the hundreds of Jews who live under heavy military guard amid tens of thousands of Palestinians in the volatile city of Hebron, Netanyahu responded \"of course.\"\n\nIsraelis head to the polls Tuesday in the second election this year, after Netanyahu failed to cobble together a coalition following April's vote, sparking the dissolution of parliament.\n\nNetanyahu calls for new elections in Israel\n\nNetanyahu has made a series of ambitious pledges in a bid to whip up support, including a promise to annex the Jordan Valley, an area even moderate Israelis view as strategic but which the Palestinians consider the breadbasket of any future state.\n\nTo protest that announcement, the Palestinian Authority held a Cabinet meeting in the Jordan Valley village of Fasayil on Monday, a day after Israel's Cabinet met elsewhere in the valley.\n\n\"The Jordan Valley is part of Palestinian lands and any settlement or annexation is illegal,\" Prime Minister Mohammed Shtayyeh said at the start of the meeting. \"We will sue Israel in international courts for exploiting our land and we will continue our struggle against the occupation on the ground and in international forums.\"\n\nCritics contend that Netanyahu's pledges, if carried out, would enflame the Middle East and eliminate any remaining Palestinian hope of establishing a separate state. His political rivals have dismissed his talk of annexation as an election ploy noting that he has refrained from annexing any territory during his more than a decade in power.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank and east Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 war.\n\nOver 2.5 million Palestinians now live in occupied territories, in addition to nearly 700,000 Jewish settlers. Israel already has annexed east Jerusalem in a move that is not internationally recognized. The international community, along with the Palestinians, overwhelmingly considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem illegal.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Netanyahu seeks a new term in high-stakes election\n\nTuesday's vote will largely be a referendum on Netanyahu, who this year surpassed Israel's founding prime minister as the country's longest-serving leader.\n\nHe has cast himself as the only candidate capable of facing Israel's myriad challenges. But his opponents say his legal troubles - including a recommendation by the attorney general to indict him on bribery, fraud and breach of trust charges - loom too large for him to carry on.", "description": "Hours before unprecedented do-over election, prime minister gives more detail of controversial annexation plan in apparent bid to lure nationalists", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/16/d45a45ef-9faf-4cfb-b0d5-7e959dba1d80/thumbnail/1200x630/45f87cd79bdce3fa72634cf080d20427/netanyahu-israel.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
