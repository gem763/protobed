The two hackers claimed they \"found a major vulnerability,\" and provided a sample of the stolen data.\n\nThe two demanded a $100,000 payment in bitcoin, to which Uber agreed. The payment was handled via the company's HackerOne bug bounty program, and Uber required the two hackers to sign a confidentiality agreement prohibiting the use of the data and public disclosure of the security breach.\n\nUber managed to keep its security breach quiet for more than a year, until November 2017, when Uber's new leadership learned of the company's past cover-up and decided to go public.\n\nAt the time, Uber execs told various news outlets that they knew who was behind the attacks -- naming a hacker in Florida and another one in Canada.\n\nFor its cover-up, the FTC placed Uber under a strict security audit, and the company was fined in the UK (\u00a3385,000) and the Netherlands (\u20ac600.000). It also agreed to pay $148 million in a class-action lawsuit settlement.\n\nThe LinkedIn extortion\n\nBut while the Uber extortion played well for the hacker duo, things didn't go the same with LinkedIn. Court documents reveal that when Glover and Mereacre reached out to LinkedIn in December 2016, the company entertained their extortion attempt, but chose to go public with the security breach after confirming its validity.\n\nIn their extortion attempt, the two hackers also tried to raise the ransom demand to a seven-digits figure.\n\n\"[P]lease keep in mind, we expect a big payment as this was hard work for us, we already helped a big corp which paid close to 7 digits,\" the two wrote in an email.\n\nLaw enforcement started an investigation shortly after Uber went public. Glover was arrested first. Mereacre was arrested in October 2018, when he visited Miami, TechCrunch reported at the time.\n\nToday, the two pleaded guilty in a California court. The New York Times, which first reported the guilty plea, said the two face up to five years in prison and a $250,000, each.", "description": "The two hackers stole 57 million user and driver details from Uber and 90,000 Lynda.com user details from LinkedIn.
