News of the lawsuit, filed in the Chancery Division of the High Court, was revealed Tuesday in a post on the couple\u2019s official website.\n\nThe post also included a strongly worded letter from Prince Harry, who outlined the couple\u2019s decision to file the suit. \u201cThough this action may not be the safe one, it is the right one,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBecause my deepest fear is history repeating itself. I\u2019ve seen what happens when someone I love is commoditised to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person. I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.\u201d\n\nMore from Deadline\n\nHarry\u2019s mother, Princess Diana, was killed in 1997 in Paris when her limousine crashed while attempting to evade tabloid paparazzi.\n\nThe lawsuit filed by Markle alleges misuse of private information, infringement of copyright and breach of the Data Protection Act 2018. It did not say what letter was at the center of the legal action, but the tabloid in February did publish contents of a private letter Markle had written to her father.\n\nSchillings, the law firm representing Markle, called the letter\u2019s publication \u201cintrusive and unlawful,\u201d and said it \u201cis part of a campaign by this media group to publish false and deliberately derogatory stories about her, as well as her husband. Given the refusal of Associated Newspapers to resolve this issue satisfactorily, we have issued proceedings to redress this breach of privacy, infringement of copyright and the aforementioned media agenda.\u201d\n\nPrince Harry called out the Mail on Sunday\u2018s \u201cruthless campaign that has escalated over the past year, throughout her pregnancy and while raising our newborn son.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis particular legal action hinges on one incident in a long and disturbing pattern of behaviour by British tabloid media,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe contents of a private letter were published unlawfully in an intentionally destructive manner to manipulate you, the reader, and further the divisive agenda of the media group in question. In addition to their unlawful publication of this private document, they purposely misled you by strategically omitting select paragraphs, specific sentences, and even singular words to mask the lies they had perpetuated for over a year.\n\n\u201cThere comes a point when the only thing to do is to stand up to this behaviour, because it destroys people and destroys lives. Put simply, it is bullying, which scares and silences people. We all know this isn\u2019t acceptable, at any level. We won\u2019t and can\u2019t believe in a world where there is no accountability for this.\u201d\n\nThe site said the couple is privately funded by the couple and proceeds from any court victory would be donated to an anti-bullying charity.\n\nA Mail on Sunday spokesperson told the BBC that \u201cWe categorically deny that the duchess\u2019s letter was edited in any way that changed its meaning.\u201d The publisher also owns Daily Mail, MailOnline and Metro.\n\nSign up for Deadline's Newsletter.
