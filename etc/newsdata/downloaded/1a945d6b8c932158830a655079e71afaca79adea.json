XR calls on BlackRock to disinvest from these sectors now and back renewables.\u201d\n\nThe crowds parted on at least three occasions to allow ambulances to pass.\n\nPolice were filmed arresting a 77-year-old rabbi who had joined the protests accompanied by around 30 Jewish activists.\n\nJeffrey Newman, Rabbi Emeritus of Finchley Reform Synagogue in north London, said he has been involved with global environmental movements for around 50 years.\n\n\u201cI am trying to get the Jewish community engaged with these issues,\u201d he told PA.\n\n\u201cMany of the younger people, the activists, have not had anything to do with the Jewish community for a long time.\n\n\u201cAnd for the first time, they have discovered that there is a potential for meaning within Judaism, because of its connection with issues that they really are concerned about.\n\n\u201cI think this is phenomenal.\u201d\n\nSix activists were also reportedly arrested outside the office of BAE Systems, the world's fourth largest arms manufacturer.\n\nThe group said it was highlighting the link between war and the climate crisis, as well as the sale of arms to Saudi Arabia.\n\nDespite the focus on the City, activists also maintained a strong presence at Trafalgar Square, where large numbers of people congregated carrying banners.\n\nSpeaking to The Independent, Extinction Rebellion spokesperson Jayne Forbes said: \u201cWe were delighted with what happened at BlackRock, morale is really high, we\u2019ve got lots of rebels who are really keen to engage. Everybody came out at 6.30 in the morning in the pouring rain, and there were 100-200 people there.\u201d\n\nMonday\u2019s protests came after more than 400 scientists endorsed the use of direct action to bring greater attention to the worsening climate crisis.\n\nIn a joint declaration, climate scientists, physicists, biologists, engineers and others from at least 20 countries broke with the caution traditionally associated with academia to side with peaceful protesters courting arrest warnings that failure could inflict \u201cincalculable human suffering\u201d.\n\nIn a statement on Monday afternoon, the London Metropolitan Police said: \u201cA total of 76 people connected to the Extinction Rebellion protests have been charged with offences including failing to comply with a condition imposed under Section 14 of the Public Order Act 1986, criminal damage, and obstruction of a highway.\n\n\u201cAs of 14:00hrs, a total of 1,405 people have been arrested in connection with the protests.\u201d\n\nThe protests came during a Queen\u2019s Speech in which the government set out its long-awaited Environment Bill, which includes measures to improve air quality, ensure nature is not damaged by building new homes, and make household recycling services more consistent.\n\nThe Independent has contacted BlackRock for comment.", "description": "Extinction Rebellion activists are planning to block roads outside MI5 on Tuesday morning on the eighth day of direct action, after the number of demonstrators arrested in London topped 1,400.", "authors": ["Harry Cockburn"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/14/18/Extinction-Rebellion-bank-of-england.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
