AIDA is Carnival\u2019s German-based cruise line. The introduction of this hybrid system will allow for lower emissions from the cruise ship as well as other benefits such as reduced noise and lower vibrations.\n\nCarnival said, \u201cthe fuel cells are expected to have a longer lifecycle than those currently being developed for automobiles, with early trials on land showing a lifespan of over 35,000 operating hours.\u201d The ships will run on the fuel cells but also will burn liquefied natural gas (LNG), one of the cleanest burning fuel sources currently available.\n\n\u201cWe have been investing in new green technology like fuel cells, LNG, and other emerging technology as an important part of our environmental strategy,\u201d said Roger Frizzell, senior vice president and chief communications officer at Carnival. \u201cThis is a journey that never ends for all of us.\u201d\n\nIt is a project that is a blend of public and private interests. The technology behind the fuel cell system was funded by Germany's Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure.\n\nIn its \u201c2019 Cruise Ship Report Card\u201d of the \u201cenvironmental footprint of 16 major cruise lines and 185 cruise ships,\u201d the Friends of the Earth organization gave Carnival an \u201cF\u201d grade. They were one of nine cruise lines to receive a failing grade in a survey that included topics such as \u201cSewage Treatment\u201d and \u201cTransparency\u201d among several other grading categories.\n\nTen ships under the Carnival umbrella that utilize liquefied natural gas (a clean-burning fossil fuel) will be hitting the open seas in the coming years. This is a development that Carnival says \u201csupports the company's environmental goals with the virtual total elimination of sulfur dioxide emissions (zero emissions) and particulate matter (95% to 100% reduction). The use of LNG will also substantially reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide.\u201d\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nIn addition, Carnival announced that an AIDA ship will utilize a lithium-ion battery power system to fuel its operations for one of its ships by 2020.", "description": "Carnival is going green with their cruise ships, one of their German-based lines will utilize a new hybrid fuel system.", "authors": ["Kristian Dyer"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/carnival-cruise-iStock.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
