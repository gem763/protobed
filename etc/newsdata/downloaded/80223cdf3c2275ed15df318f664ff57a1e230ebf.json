Feel free to keep score of who can tell the future most often or mock us as we go. Now, on to Week 6!\n\nAdrian Peterson, top-20 fantasy RB\n\nPlease understand, this particular bold prediction is not intended as a full-season endorsement of Adrian Peterson, who enters Week 6 averaging 2.7 yards per carry. TWO. POINT. SEVEN. Yikes. But when interim head coach Bill Callahan talks about running the ball with greater frequency, I am taking him at his word. That's gonna happen \u2014 in part because no Washington quarterback is particularly gifted at throwing the ball. No one should be shocked if Peterson handles 18-20 carries on Sunday at Miami. He's facing a defense that ranks dead-last in the league against the run (175.8 rush YPG) and he's in a rare situation in which game flow won't be an issue. If you're ever gonna start AP, do it now. - Andy Behrens\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nKyler Murray a top-three fantasy QB\n\nArizona's \"Little Red Corvette\" is starting to live up to the hype of the fantasy draft season. His 2.0 touchdown percentage is unsustainable, a trend that is bound to positively regress. Even if it doesn't, his 10-plus YPA achieved last week combined with his rising rushing totals arrow to steady top-five performances to come. In a Week 6 clash with ample high-scoring appeal, he's bound to spin his wheels. Atlanta has surrendered the fifth-most fantasy points, 8.5 yards per attempt, 263.2 pass yards per game and 2.6 passing touchdowns per game to signal-callers. Murray drives to 3-plus touchdowns, 350 combined yards, and a top-three fantasy finish. Love Murray, but don't leave him fast. - Brad Evans\n\nArizona Cardinals Quarterback Kyler Murray is starting to deliver on his fantasy promise, and has another great matchup on tap in Week 6.

Williams impressed during the preseason and gets a Washington secondary this week that\u2019s been struggling mightily, allowing the fourth-most fantasy points to wide receivers and the most TD passes (13) in the NFL this year. DeVante Parker is another sneaky play this week (he ranks top-15 in air yards this season) against a Washington pass defense that ranks 28th in DVOA, but it\u2019s clear Williams is Rosen\u2019s favorite target, making the rookie wideout an intriguingly cheap DFS flier and a top-30 WR this week. - Dalton Del Don\n\n[Play in Yahoo\u2019s NFL $300K Baller. $10 entry fee and $30K to first place]\n\nMohamed Sanu, overlooked streamer\n\nLast week I was all about Calvin Ridley getting right \u2026 and he did, corralling 5 balls for 88 yards and a score (WR13). But would you believe it if I told you that he was being out-snapped and out-targeted by eight-year vet Mohamed Sanu?\n\nLeading all Falcons receivers in snaps (82.5%), the 30 year old slot-man has been ultra-efficient, posting a catch rate of 80.6% (WR3) and averaging nearly 6 receptions per game (WR11). In Week 6, he gets a juicy matchup against the Cardinals secondary, which has given up a staggering 12 receiving TDs (tied for second-most with the Falcons, the Dolphins, and the Raiders). Interestingly, Sanu is tied for second in team red-zone looks with Austin Hooper (just behind Julio Jones), drawing two high-value targets in back-to-back efforts. Furthermore, he\u2019ll likely draw coverage from Tramaine Brock, who is allowing opposing receivers to convert at a rate of 72%, and opposing QBs a passer rating of 108.3 when targeted. Consider Sanu a high-floor WR3 for fantasy purposes. (Fearless Forecast: 5-56-1) - Liz Loza\n\nRobert Woods scores twice\n\nI understand you\u2019re busy with other stories in Los Angeles. Cooper Kupp\u2019s breakout has your attention. Todd Gurley\u2019s status has you refreshing the web every 30 seconds. And it might look like Woods is having a disappointing year with no touchdowns yet, after all.\n\nAlas, everything else in Woods\u2019s stat profile is in line with his breakout 2018 season. And touchdown rate can be a very noisy stat. Trust the system and the player, and make a pitch for Woods while the opportunity is still there. Nothing really has changed here. And you generally love Sean McVay when he has that extra prep time. - Scott Pianowski\n\nStefon Diggs ACTUALLY goes off\n\nLast time Stefon Diggs played these Philadelphia Eagles he put on a route running clinic that inspired GIFs the football world over. Of course, he\u2019s been dusting corners all season and still too infrequently getting the targets. This is a great matchup against an Eagles defense that bleeds passing production (sixth-most yards per game allowed) and swallows up rushing attacks. However, let\u2019s play a little psychological game here to really make the point.\n\nThe Vikings don\u2019t want to trade Diggs and have all the incentive in the world to keep the wildly talented and highly paid 25 year old wideout. They still need to make this work. Last week was the time for hard-ass Mike Zimmer to make his point about missing practice; slap Diggs with fines, not instruct the Kubiak-contingent to get the receiver going. Now that the point has been made, they can let Diggs in on the passing rebound fun here in Week 6. Diggs\u2019 quick separation skills will allow Kirk Cousins to get rid of the ball quickly against a pass rush that just flummoxed the Jets last week. - Matt Harmon\n\nListen to the Yahoo Fantasy Football Podcast", "description": "Our analysts reveal their biggest surprises of the week, including Adrian Peterson taking advantage of a favorable matchup.", "authors": ["Yahoo Sports Fantasy Staff"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/atoRTKvnoNfz7AtuvoZuMA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD02ODkuMDY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/JHaa8kWxzGG6dekunuayrQ--~B/aD0xODAwO3c9MzM0NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/51d15a90-eb70-11e9-b5ff-72c966f99c18", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
