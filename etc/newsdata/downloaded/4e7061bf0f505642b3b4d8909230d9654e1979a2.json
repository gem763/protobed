It\u2019s designed to be intuitive. \u201cIf you have basic computer skills, then two hours of training is enough,\u201d said Luis Miguel Artieda, program director of the Avina Foundation in Lima, Peru, which manages and helps to fund Minecraft redesign projects in Latin America. Mr. Westerberg and others said that even people who have never used a computer can build in Minecraft in three or four hours.\n\nAvina\u2019s biggest project is in the Villa El Salvador slum of Lima, an enormous park called Parque Mam\u00e1 Lucinda, built on a space that spent decades as a garbage dump. It\u2019s named for a resident, Lucinda Terrazas, now 80, who has been fighting for such a park for 40 years. \u201cThis was certainly her first experience with computers,\u201d Mr. Artieda said. \u201cShe sat at a computer with two or three people, so she didn\u2019t have to move the mouse herself.\u201d\n\nAfter the teams finish their designs, they present them one by one, and the group discusses priorities. This design process can last a weekend, or stretch out over multiple weeks \u2014 six Saturdays, for example.\n\nIn a Minecraft consultation, more people show up and give their idea than in a traditional community consultation. \u201cThere are power dynamics,\u201d Nicolette Pingo, development facilitation manager of the Johannesburg Development Agency, said of traditional consultations. \u201cMost of the time, it\u2019s men speaking a lot,\u201d she said. \u201dWe don\u2019t hear the voice of women.\u201d Or of youth, or homeless people \u2014 who care intensely about the design of public space. \u201cIn Minecraft, even if you are shy you can put your point across.\u201d Even if you don\u2019t speak the dominant language.\n\nMinecraft also helps people understand the project. An architectural drawing usually offers only a bird\u2019s-eye view. But in Minecraft, players walk around a building, go inside, look out windows, climb a tree, run around a soccer pitch.\n\nSome who work with Minecraft say it also encourages a richer discussion and more ideas. Many teenagers dream of playing video games for a living; James Delaney actually does it. Six years ago, when he was 17, he founded Blockworks, a company in London that conducts educational and marketing projects with Minecraft. (Here are some jaw-dropping examples; check out the three maps of London\u2019s Great Fire of 1666).\n\nIn the undergraduate thesis he wrote last year, Mr. Delaney told the story of the Victoria and Albert Museum. When it opened a new entrance in 2017, the museum recruited Blockworks to run a Minecraft workshop asking children to reimagine the building\u2019s dazzling white porcelain-tiled courtyard. None of the players had any verbal criticism of the courtyard. But most submitted redesigns that were very different; 75 percent of the players, for example, put in trees, water or plants.", "description": "To improve community structures with citizens\u2019 input, the United Nations uses a computer game inspired by Lego.", "authors": ["Tina Rosenberg"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/15/opinion/15FIXES-RosenbergADD-02/15FIXES-RosenbergADD-02-facebookJumbo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
