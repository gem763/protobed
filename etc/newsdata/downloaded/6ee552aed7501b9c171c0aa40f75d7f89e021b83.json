As the clean-up operation continues, the death toll is expected to rise.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption At least 15,000 people have been left homeless in the wake of Hurricane Dorian\n\nDorian was packing sustained winds of 295km/h (185mph) when it made landfall at Elbow Cay on the Abacos on 1 September.\n\nIt equalled the highest winds ever recorded for a hurricane at landfall when it struck the Abaco Islands.\n\nOn Thursday the US announced $4 million (\u00a33.2 million) in new humanitarian assistance for the Bahamas. The US Agency for International Development said the money would go towards providing shelter, food, medicine and water to those on the two worst hit islands.\n\nMore than 5,000 people have been evacuated from those islands to New Providence, where the country's capital Nassau is located.", "description": "More than 1,000 people are still missing following the hurricane two weeks ago.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0BE0/production/_108804030_79b7fca5-24b0-433a-a2b6-83dc2068d309.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
