In the past, North Korea often fired missiles at a lofted angle to avoid neighboring countries. Some experts say the weapon fired Wednesday is a medium-range missile, which North Korea stopped firing along with long-range missiles after it entered into talks with the United States early last year.\n\nJapan lodged an immediate protest, saying the missile landed inside its exclusive economic zone. If confirmed, it would be the first North Korean missile that has landed that close to Japan since November 2017.\n\nThe U.S. State Department called on North Korea \u201cto refrain from provocations, abide by their obligations under U.N. Security Council resolutions, and remain engaged in substantive and sustained negotiations to do their part to ensure peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and achieve denuclearization.\u201d\n\nSouth Korean military officials wouldn\u2019t officially disclose whether the missile was fired from a submarine, a barge or another platform. But during an emergency National Security Council meeting, officials placed weight on a submarine-launched missile test and expressed \u201cstrong concerns,\u201d according to South Korea\u2019s presidential office.\n\nMissiles launched from submarines are harder to detect in advance. Some experts say North Korea is attempting to raise the stakes and ramp up pressure on the United States before their nuclear negotiators meet on Saturday.\n\n\u201cThe North is trying to convey a message that time is not on the side of the United States and that it could take a different path if the working-level talks don\u2019t go the way it wanted,\u201d said Du Hyeogn Cha, a visiting scholar at Seoul\u2019s Asan Institute for Policy Studies.\n\nIf fired at a standard trajectory, the missile could have travelled 1,500-2,000 kilometers (930-1,240 miles), Kim Dong-yub, an analyst from Seoul\u2019s Institute for Far Eastern Studies, wrote on Facebook.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s Defense Ministry also declined to confirm whether it was a medium-range missile. But it said it flew higher than any other short-range weapons the North fired in previous 10 rounds of launches since May.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has downplayed the significance of recent short-range launches by North Korea, but it\u2019s unclear whether he would do the same this time.\n\n\u201cA submarine-launched ballistic missile is a very dangerous weapon. (North Korea) can place it on a submarine and covertly sail to a place it wants and fires the weapon. And the missile can fly much further if launched at a normal angle,\u201d said analyst Moon Seong Mook at the Seoul-based Korea Research Institute for National Strategy. \u201cTrump would find it difficult to say again everyone can conduct short-range missile tests.\u201d\n\nSeoul\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff statement said the weapon fired Wednesday is believed to be a Pukguksong-class missile. It refers to a solid-fuel missile that North Korea tested-launched from an underwater platform in 2016 with the hope that it could eventually be a part of its submarine weaponry. That missile flew 500 kilometers (310 miles), and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said at the time that his country had gained \u201cperfect nuclear-attack capability.\u201d\n\nNorth Korea has been trying to develop the ability to fire ballistic missiles from submarines, though the tests needed for that appear to have been put off amid talks with Washington.\n\nWhen North Korea\u2019s news agency in July publicized photos of a newly built submarine and said its operational deployment \u201cis near at hand,\u201d some outside experts said it was the North\u2019s biggest submarine with several launch tubes for missiles. An estimated 70 other submarines in the North\u2019s arsenal only have launch tubes for torpedoes, not missiles, according to the experts.\n\nCha said flight data provided by South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff suggested that it was more likely that the North tested the same type of missile it fired in 2016, instead of a new system. Some experts disagreed, saying North Korea likely tested a new version of the Pukguksong missile.\n\nJapanese Defense Minister Taro Kono called the launch \u201ca serious threat to Japanese national security.\u201d Kono also said the launch without advance warning was an \u201cextremely problematic and dangerous act\u201d for the safety of vessels and aircraft.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the North violated U.N. resolutions that ban it from conducting any launch using ballistic technology.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to cooperate with the U.S. and the international community and do the utmost to maintain and protect the safety of the people as we stay on alert,\u201d Abe said.\n\nSince his second summit with Trump in Vietnam in February collapsed without reaching any agreement, Kim has hinted at scrapping his self-imposed moratorium on nuclear and long-range missile tests and demanded that Trump come up with mutually acceptable new proposals by December. In Vietnam, Trump rejected Kim\u2019s calls for broad sanctions relief in exchange for partially surrendering the North\u2019s nuclear capabilities.\n\nThe latest launch came hours after Choe Son Hui, North Korea\u2019s first vice minister of foreign affairs, said his country and the U.S. had agreed to resume working-level nuclear negotiations on Saturday following a preliminary contact on Friday.\n\nU.S. State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus, traveling with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Rome, confirmed that U.S. and North Korean officials plan to meet within the next week.\n\nBoth North Korea and the United States didn\u2019t say where the meetings would take place.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo and Matt Lee in Rome contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "North Korea fired a ballistic missile from the sea on Wednesday, South Korea's military said, a suggestion that it may have tested an underwater-launched missile for the first time in three years ahead of a resumption of nuclear talks with the United States this weekend.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kim Tong-Hyung", "Hyung-Jin Kim"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/01/south_korea_north_korea_projectile_70829_c0-0-4000-2332_s1770x1032.jpg?6fa6f1358e32f79a7430670803768e97648eaf7e"}
