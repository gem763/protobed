The child\u2014she looks younger than 16\u2014has assumed the authoritative posture of the adult. But she\u2019s not an understanding New Age parent, trained in the Dr. Spock school of bighearted moms and dads. Thunberg is a severe and unforgiving moralist. \u201cYou can\u2019t just sit around waiting for hope to come. You\u2019re acting like spoiled irresponsible children,\u201d she told the European Economic and Social Committee. She ordered her audience to do its homework, chastising it for failing to read a United Nations report.\n\nOn the eve of Thunberg\u2019s arrival in the United States, I bought a collection of her speeches\u2014No One Is Too Small to Make a Difference\u2014recently published by Penguin. They rank among the most bracing rhetorical pieces of our time. Yet there\u2019s not a single soaring sentence in the anthology. It\u2019s a bit like reading a Barack Obama speech turned inside out. Politicians sprinkle addresses with the aspirational, and usually phony, pronouns us and we. Thunberg relies on the accusatory second person. \u201cYou say nothing in life is black or white but that is a lie, a very dangerous lie.\u201d Or \u201cI don\u2019t believe for one second that you will rise to that challenge.\u201d Where politicians and preachers hug the audience, she slaps it. What makes her style so effective and unnerving is that it comes from another age. Her vision of apocalypse is biblical, and so is her moral framework.\n\nIn her telling, she cannot help but speak in such unvarnished tones. Her biographical explanation for her raw truth-telling has the trappings of myth. At the age of 11, she fell into the dark hole of depression. \u201cI stopped talking and I stopped eating. In two months I lost about 10 kilos of weight.\u201d She was diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s syndrome and selective mutism. \u201cThat basically means I only speak when I think it is necessary,\u201d she says. \u201cNow is one of those moments.\u201d\n\nBeyond biology, what prodded her to begin her Friday school strikes were the students who survived the Parkland massacre, suggesting a pattern that is both inspiring and depressing. Where adult politicians have failed to provide moral leadership, children have been impressed into service. (See also: Malala Yousafzai.) They struggle against the charge that they are someone else\u2019s puppets, the suspicion that in the distance a grayhead pulls the strings. But that cynical charge is both cruel and wildly unpersuasive in Thunberg\u2019s case, given that her planned addresses so unmistakably track the rhythms of her conversational speech.\n\nMy 14-year-old daughter has been inspired by Thunberg to strike today, skipping classes to head to protests in downtown Washington, D.C. She has also suffered bouts of anxiety, and I long to build a seawall that can protect her from her fears. But her example, and Thunberg\u2019s doomsaying, have made me realize that my parental desire to calm is the stuff of childish fantasy; anxiety is the mature response. To protect our children, we need to embrace their despair.", "description": "The teenage climate-change activist has taken on anxieties far beyond her years.
