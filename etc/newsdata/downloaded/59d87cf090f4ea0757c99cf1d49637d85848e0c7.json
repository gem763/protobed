Unsworth added that Musk could \"stick his submarine where it hurts\".\n\nMusk responded by calling Unsworth a \"pedo guy\" in a tweet and a \"child rapist\" in an email to a BuzzFeed reporter.\n\nWilson wasn't persuaded by arguments from Musk's attorney, Robert Schwartz, that any alleged paedophilia was somehow relevant to the question whether Musk's submarine might have worked in the rescue or was public relations stunt.\n\n\"You're saying his being a pelophile is germane to the issue whether Musk had sincere motivation,\" Wilson said. \"That seems a bit of a stretch.\"\n\nThe judge said he would issue a written ruling later. However, by throwing out Musk's First Amendment defence that he was engaging with a public figure in a public controversy, Unsworth doesn't have to prove Musk acted with actual malice to win on his defamation claim.\n\nMusk's lawyers didn't have immediate comment on the ruling.\n\nThe case took a new twist this month after court documents showed that Musk, after his initial tweets in July of last year, had hired a private investigator to dig up dirt about Unsworth. It turned out the detective was a convicted conman.\n\nMusk then sent an \"off-the-record\" email to a BuzzFeed reporter in which he said Unsworth had married a 12-year-old child bride in Thailand. Unsworth says that's not what the investigator told Musk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnsworth said in court filings that he met his Thai wife in London when she was 32 years old. The caver also scoffed at Musk's defence that he didn't intend for his \"off-the-record\" email to be published.\n\nUnsworth said Musk \"admitted that he wanted the information published whether true or false, and told the reporter that publication is 'up to you'\".\n\nBloomberg", "description": "Elon Musk will have to go to trial in December after a federal judge rebuffed his latest request to throw out a defamation lawsuit filed by a UK caver after Musk referred to him as a 'pedo guy'.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2648%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_53/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/485709abda2419ec32a398655c1633f2acfe4f50", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
