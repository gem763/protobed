There\u2019s things that happen in my own community in trying to help my kids graduate high school and go off to college. That\u2019s been my main concern the last couple of years with my school.\u201d\n\nLeBron\u2019s sudden reticence about making pronouncements on political issues after years of political pronouncements and activism came after comments on Monday where he criticized Americans for supporting the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong and called our First Amendment rights of free speech a \u201cnegative\u201d thing.\n\nIn his controversial comments, James slammed Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey\u2019s tweet in support of the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong, calling Morey\u2019s support uneducated.\n\nOn top of dismissing the pro-democracy movement, James even criticized America\u2019s tradition of free speech as being \u201cnegative\u201d because it allowed criticism of the NBA\u2019s big-money deals with the oppressive Chinese government.\n\nLeBron says he believes Rockets GM Daryl Morey wasn\u2019t educated when he spoke about Hong Kong and that his tweet could have hurt a lot of people, including financially pic.twitter.com/UMj71DPQH7 \u2014 Darren Rovell (@darrenrovell) October 15, 2019\n\nSince his comments on Monday, James has tried to squirm out of controversy, but with every statement, James ends up deeper in trouble.\n\nAfter his comments Monday, James tried to explain further, saying, \u201cLet me clear up the confusion,\u201d James tweeted Monday. \u201cI do not believe there was any consideration for the consequences and ramifications of the tweet. I\u2019m not discussing the substance. Others can talk about that. \u2026 My team and this league just went through a difficult week. I think people need to understand what a tweet or statement can do to others. And I believe nobody stopped and considered what would happen. Could have waited a week to send it.\u201d\n\nBut this was only seen as James being more worried about Chinese money than in aiding the many minorities who are jailed, tortured, and killed by Chinese authorities on a daily basis.\n\nBy Tuesday, pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong were burning LeBron James merchandise and jerseys and wearing sad-faced LeBron James masks.\n\nProtesters slammed James as being \u201cabout money\u201d and not about freedom.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.", "description": "Progressive NBA star LeBron James is suddenly exclaiming that every political issue is not \"everybody's problem,\" as fallout over his", "authors": ["Warner Todd Huston"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/gty-640x480-640x480-R-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
