Reuters reported on Advent\u2019s being close to completing the fundraising in July.\n\nThe new fund will invest alongside Advent\u2019s flagship Global Private Equity fund (GPE IX), which it raised this year at its $17.5 billion cap.\n\nWith the new technology-focused fund, Advent is joining a crowded field. Private equity firms such as Silver Lake, Thoma Bravo and Vista Equity specialize in technology investment.\n\n\u201cWe have depth and strength in retail, healthcare and financial services, including payments, where technology is becoming important, and we intend to leverage these strengths in how we pursue investments,\u201d said Brian Taylor, global head of Advent\u2019s 20-member technology team, who joined Advent this year after serving as co-head of buyout firm TPG Capital\u2019s technology group.\n\nAdvent Global Technology will pursue its own deals, investing upwards of $50 million in \u201chigh-growth emerging businesses,\u201d the buyout firm said. Advent opened an office in Palo Alto, California, this year as part of its expansion in technology investments.\n\n\u201cFor tech at Advent, we have one team, one investment strategy but two pools of capital,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nAdvent said its technology fund has already made two co-investments alongside its flagship fund: the acquisition of majority stake in enterprise software firm Transaction Services Group and an investment in U.S. health date provider Definitive Healthcare.\n\nAdvent has been investing in technology since it was mainly a venture capital firm in the 1980s. It launched its private equity strategy in 1990, and since then has invested in technology companies worth a total of more than $14 billion, including debt.", "description": "U.S. private equity firm Advent International said on Wednesday it has completed fundraising for its first technology fund after six months, with total investor commitments reaching its cap of $2 billion.", "authors": ["Chibuike Oguh", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
