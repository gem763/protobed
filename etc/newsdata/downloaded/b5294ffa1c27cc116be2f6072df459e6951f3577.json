NSANY -0.08%\n\nRenault\u2019s board voted Friday to remove Mr. Bollor\u00e9 with immediate effect after he refused to resign. Three of Renault\u2019s 18 directors abstained from the vote while the rest backed the move, Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard said.\n\n\u201cI had hoped this would be done differently,\u201d Mr. Senard said.\n\nMr. Bollor\u00e9 didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. He told French newspaper Les Echos ahead of the meeting that \u201cthe brutality and the totally unexpected character of what is happening are stupefying.\u201d\n\nMr. Bollor\u00e9\u2019s ouster is part of Renault-Nissan\u2019s effort to sweep away executives who were close allies of Mr. Ghosn when he headed both companies. The alliance has been in upheaval since Mr. Ghosn was arrested in November and later charged in Japan with financial misconduct\u2014allegations he denies.\n\nThe Japanese car maker this week replaced Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa, a longtime lieutenant of Mr. Ghosn, with a triumvirate of executives.\n\nClotilde Delbos, chief financial officer of Renault, will take over as interim CEO.

The board was also worried about a decline in Renault\u2019s revenue and profit.\n\n\u201cThe alliance needs a breath of fresh air,\u201d Mr. Senard said. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing personal.\u201d\n\nRenault shares rose more than 3% on the news of Mr. Bollor\u00e9\u2019s departure. Renault\u2019s board tapped Chief Financial Officer Clotilde Delbos to take over as interim CEO while it searches for a replacement.\n\nRenault\u2019s sales chief, Olivier Murguet, and Jose Vincente de los Mozos, who heads manufacturing and supply chain, were named deputy managing directors to assist Mrs. Delbos.\n\nThe shake-up is a sign of how urgently Renault wants to heal the rift with Nissan. The French auto maker has been pushing to deepen the alliance and add new members to better cope with the industry\u2019s darkened outlook.\n\nEarlier this year, Renault was involved in a protracted merger dance with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, but a deal fell apart after the two car makers failed to secure the explicit support of Nissan. The merger negotiations were led by Mr. Senard, who came over from Michelin to take the chairmanship at Renault early this year.\n\nArndt Ellinghorst, an auto analyst with brokerage Evercore ISI, wrote in a note that Mr. Bollor\u00e9\u2019s ouster came \u201cas another blow for a company that urgently needs direction and stability.\u201d\n\n\u201cRenault has to deal with end-markets and customers and not with itself!\u201d Mr. Ellinghorst wrote. \u201cWe are worried that Renault\u2019s competitive position will further erode in an automotive world that\u2019s getting tougher by the day.\u201d\n\nWrite to Nick Kostov at Nick.Kostov@wsj.com and Stacy Meichtry at stacy.meichtry@wsj.com", "description": "Renault fired Chief Executive Thierry Bollor\u00e9 as the French car maker seeks to turn the page on auto titan Carlos Ghosn\u2019s decades of leadership and reboot its globe-spanning alliance with Nissan.", "authors": ["Nick Kostov", "Stacy Meichtry", "Nick.Kostov Dowjones.Com", "Stacy.Meichtry Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-116064/social", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
