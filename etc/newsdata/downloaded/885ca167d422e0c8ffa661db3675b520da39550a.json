Two missiles struck the Iranian tanker Sabiti traveling through the Red Sea off the coast of Saudi Arabia on Friday, Iranian officials said, the latest incident in the region amid months of heightened tensions between Tehran and the U.S. (SHANA via AP)\n\nBy NASSER KARIMI\n\nA senior Iranian security official said Saturday that an attack on one of the country's oil tankers won't go unpunished, the official IRNA news agency reported.\n\nAli Shamkhani, secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, said a day after two missiles struck the Iranian tanker Sabiti as it traveled through the Red Sea off the coast of Saudi Arabia that \"vicious behavior in international waterways will not go without a response.\" He didn't elaborate.\n\nShamkhani said an Iranian committee was able to glean some information about the attack from video images from the Sabiti.\n\nCabinet spokesman Ali Rabiei said, meanwhile, that Iran was investigating the case but \"avoiding hastiness.\"\n\nThe mysterious attack, which came amid months of heightened tensions at sea across the wider Mideast, damaged two storerooms aboard the tanker, Iranian officials said. Iran said the tanker will arrive at one of its ports in about 10 days.\n\nSaudi Arabia, meanwhile, broke its silence on the incident, saying through its state-run news agency that authorities received an electronic message Friday from the captain of the Sabiti \"that the front of the vessel has been broken, resulting in an oil spill in the sea from the cargo and tanks of the vessel.\"\n\nIt said the Sabiti continued moving and turned off its electronic tracker without offering more information.\n\n\"The kingdom affirms its commitment to the security and safety of maritime navigation, as well as international agreements and norms,\" the statement on the state-run Saudi Press Agency said.\n\nSaudi Arabia said it would launch a pollution control response to the spilled crude oil from the Iranian tanker.\n\nAs Washington and Riyadh weigh a response to a drone-and-missile strike on the kingdom's oil industry that shook global energy markets, Iran said any attack by the U.S. or Saudi Arabia will spark an \"all-out war.\"\n\nThe attacks come after President Donald Trump's decision to unilaterally withdraw America from Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers and impose crushing sanctions targeting Iran's crude oil sales and shipments. Iranian officials warned for weeks that if they couldn't sell their oil, neither would anyone else in the region.\n\nMeanwhile, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan was scheduled to meet Iranian leaders during his Sunday visit to Tehran following a visit to Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn anticipation of Khan's anticipated mediation between the regional rivals, Iran's Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said Iran was ready to enter a dialogue with the Saudis \"with or without a mediator\" to prevent misunderstandings that could result in third parties or foreign countries exploiting the regional situation.\n\nMousavi said Iran has always been open to those countries that seek \"a safe region through good will.\"\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.
