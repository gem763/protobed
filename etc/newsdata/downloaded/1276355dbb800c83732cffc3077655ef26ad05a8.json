As a result, the society's core values have been undermined,\" he told ZDNet.\n\nIn a move to block the passing of the proposed resolution, which requires 75% members' approval, Clarke along with other academics and practitioners have urged members to cast their votes or solicit proxies against the motion to \"rescue\" the ACS.\n\n\"The ACS executive abused its power in order to railroad the existing branch committees into supporting the unsupportable,\" Clarke said\n\n\"It then brazenly argued in favour of its own motion; failed to provide appropriate information on the arguments against the motion; and prevented arguments against the motion from being communicated to members.\"\n\nSee also: 56% of employees lack digital skills needed for future jobs (TechRepublic)\n\nWhile Clarke was unable to disclose how many proxies he has received against the motion, he said the support gained is \"sufficient to know that we're getting some traction\".\n\nMembers will be able to formally vote on the proposal during the organisation's general meeting scheduled for October 25.\n\nIf ACS becomes a company limited by guarantee (CLG), the company would also be regulated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), rather than Access Canberra. Any compliance agreement obligations would also fall under the Corporations Act 2001.\n\nACS CEO Andrew Johnson previously told ZDNet the unanimous decision by the management committee was part of the ACS' five-year strategy. He said one of the sections within the strategy highlighted \"the need for ACS to review its corporate form and governance structures, and to streamline its decision-making processes to enable it to be agile in the future, in order to more effectively achieve its objects and deliver its services\".\n\nJohnson said the CLG structure is the most common form of incorporating a national membership association under Commonwealth law, which means even under the structure change, ACS would remain as a membership body.\n\n\"Member centricity has been one of the guiding principles of change,\" he said.\n\nJohnson also assured that if the structural changes go ahead, any certification that individuals had received from ACS for completing courses, such as its migration skills assessment, would remain valid.\n\nThe proposal comes off the back of the ACS acquiring four competing data-centric organisations, for an undisclosed amount last month.\n\nThe ACS scooped up Data-Driven Marketing and Advertising (ADMA), Institute of Analytics Professionals of Australia (IAPA), Digital + Technology Collective (D+ TC), and Data Governance Australia (DGA), which will now sit under the ACS umbrella from the Australian Alliance for Data Leadership (AADL).\n\nClarke at the time wrote an open letter requesting signatures from ACS members and ex-members about the acquisition, criticising that it was \"completely untenable\" for ACS to absorb ADMA because ACS's stance was significantly different and at times opposite from ADMA. He received 61 signatures in the end.\n\nRelated coverage", "description": "ACS fellow and former director Roger Clarke has labelled the proposal as a \"hijack\" by board members.", "authors": ["Aimee Chanthadavong"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/03/03/f5af4d78-89c6-4741-a7c9-699a1aef4010/thumbnail/770x578/574e93260b821b813fbdd47513c8df6d/05w-moocs-istockphoto-rawpixel-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
