It shows a blatant lack of fair play, certain to ignite bitter political division. With a 53-47 majority in the Senate, the Republicans\u2019 only concern is losing the vote of one of their own \u2014 say, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine. With no filibuster, the GOP does not need any votes from Democrats.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s goal is to secure his political legacy as the man who cemented a conservative majority on the high court to counter the liberal ideas emerging from the rising number of younger, more racially diverse and more progressive voters in the country.", "description": "", "authors": ["Juan Williams", "Thehill.Com Opinion Judiciary"], "top_image": ""}
