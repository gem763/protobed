I\u2019m so so tired of living in a reality show. This is what I feel like is happening every single day, and now it\u2019s just become normal. It\u2019s become normal.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cThe thing that made me most irate is how he talked about General Mattis who served his country for 41 years. If you want to talk about democracy though, and people who have kept our democracy intact, it is people like General Mattis who stood next to our allies.

You think that\u2019s going to be a winning argument for yourself. I don\u2019t know how people can stand by the president when he says things about people like that.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "On Thursday's broadcast of ABC's \"The View,\" co-host Abby Huntsman said she was embarrassed by President Donald Trump.
