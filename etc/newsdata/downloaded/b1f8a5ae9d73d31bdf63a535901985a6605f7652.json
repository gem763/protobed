Next up is winless Tunisia (0-5) on Tuesday at 10 p.m. ET at Hiroshima's Green Arena.\n\nLewis said Sunday's win was important to build momentum and keep the players positive while adding his charges didn't prepare properly \u2014 \"we were not ready in the first set \u2014 but recovered after making adjustments.\n\nAustralian coach Mark Lebedew said his 1-4 squad wasn't ready to be active.\n\n\"We wait for the other team to do things,\" he explained. \"And when you let good teams play and see what they do, it turns out they will beat you every single time. At some point we have to learn this lesson.\"\n\nRyley Barnes added 10 points for Canada, which finished seventh at the last World Cup in 2015.", "description": "Stephen Maar scored a game-high 24 points and the Canadian men reeled off three straight wins after an opening-set loss to Australia to post their second win in a row at the volleyball World Cup on Sunday in Japan.", "authors": ["Cbc Sports"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5311017.1570376118!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/maar-stephen-191006-1180.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
