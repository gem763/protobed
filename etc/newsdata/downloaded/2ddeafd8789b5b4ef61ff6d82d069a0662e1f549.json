By cooperating with the investigation and not being removed from office, Begala said the \"stain\" is on former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich.\n\n\"In the Clinton days, we complied with, I looked it up, over 1,000 congressional subpoenas,\" Begala told CNN on Wednesday. \"We made three of Clinton\u2019s chiefs of staff available in the Starr investigation. Clinton himself personally testified, which Trump didn't have the guts to do, and he even gave blood...He gave frickin\u2019 blood to confirm that the DNA, in fact, was his.\"\n\nBegala said Trump is basically admitting that he is guilty by not cooperating with the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry, adding the reason why Clinton \"won\" over the scandal of his affair with Monica Lewinsky was because he talked about his agenda and not impeachment.\n\n\"He talked about child care, he talked about Head Start, he talked about his agenda he wanted to get back to that these terrible partisans like Newt Gingrich were distracting him from,\" he explained.\n\n\"Well I mean, he was impeached,\" anchor Alisyn Camerota said.\n\n\"He was and that\u2019s a stain on Newt Gingrich more than it is on Bill Clinton because he was found not guilty, even by a Republican Senate,\" Begala replied.\n\n\"I would say history has been kind on the Bill Clinton impeachment, but if President Trump is trying to avoid being impeached by the House, he\u2019s trying just a completely different tactic,\" Camerota said.\n\n\n\n", "description": ".10/09/2019 14:27:25PM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Cortney O'Brien", "Timothy Meads", "Guy Benson", "Leah Barkoukis"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/282/2452a682-0fff-43c5-91f9-dd99b274b001.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
