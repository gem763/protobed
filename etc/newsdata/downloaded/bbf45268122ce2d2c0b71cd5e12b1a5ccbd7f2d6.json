On Friday we about what to expect from FOMC and we\u2019ll touch on that again tomorrow, the eve before the Fed meeting. However for now, we\u2019d like to discuss the broad-based rally in the US dollar. The strengthened against all of the major currencies except for the Japanese yen. The decline in is consistent with the sharp decline in treasury yields and sell-off in stocks. Investors are nervous ahead of the Fed meeting for a number of reasons. First the most recent piece of US data \u2013 the was disappointing. Secondly, last night\u2019s Chinese economic reports fell short of expectations and lastly, the attacks on Saudi Arabia oil facilities has investors worried that it could escalate into a US attack on Iran.\n\nThe attacks are believed to have come from Iranian soil and shortly after the strikes, President Trump said the US military is \u201clocked and loaded,\u201d waiting to hear from Saudi Arabia \u201cas to who they believe was the cause of this attack and under what terms we would proceed.\u201d Iran dismissed US allegations as \u201cunacceptable\u201d and \u201cbaseless\u201d and threatened to retaliate on US bases. jumped well over 10% on the back of the attacks, shrugging off Trump\u2019s decision to release oil from the US\u2019 strategic petroleum reserve. While the actual disruption to the oil markets should be limited, the greater fear of armed conflict could keep oil prices and the Canadian dollar elevated. We expect to drop to 1.3150.\n\nThe and dollars are in focus as significantly weaker and numbers puts pressure on China to increase fiscal stimulus. The New Zealand dollar has been hit the hardest, falling for the fourth trading day in a row while softer Chinese data only stemmed the rise in A$. Part of this divergence can be attributed to the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s optimism. Tonight, the from the most recent RBA meeting will be released and the overall strength of the Australian dollar reflects their optimism. When they last met in September, the RBA recognized global uncertainty but also said they expect growth to strengthen gradually to around trend. They also noted upward pressure on wage growth and signs of a turnaround in the housing market that should support spending. If the minutes are optimistic, will extend to fresh 5-month highs. If they give investors any reason to believe that easing is still a possibility this year, A$ will extend its slide quickly, far outpacing the decline in NZ$.\n\nand also fell sharply on Monday. The euro was hit by dovish comments from ECB member Lane who said the convergence of inflation toward their goal has recently slowed and may have partly reversed. The is scheduled for release tomorrow and while investors may be pleased with the massive stimulus packaged expected from the central bank, the German economy is still very weak. Sterling on the other hand continues to be pressured by Brexit risks. Johnson and Juncker agree that more intensive talks are needed but the possibility of a delay to the October 31 Brexit deadline has been put to question by Luxembourg leader Bettel who said he would only delay Brexit if the deadline serves a purpose. The UK and the EU need Luxembourg on board because the decision needs to be unanimous.", "description": "Forex Analysis by Kathy Lien covering: EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY, AUD/USD.
