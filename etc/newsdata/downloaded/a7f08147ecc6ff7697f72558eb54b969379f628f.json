And it\u2019s driving the election in North Carolina\u2019s 9th District, which Trump carried handily in 2016 but became a surprising 2018 swing seat amid broad suburban backlash to the president.\n\nThe president will hold a rally for Republican nominee Dan Bishop on Monday night in Fayetteville, seeking to boost GOP turnout on one end of the district and outdo Charlotte and its immediate suburbs on the opposite end, where Democrats in Mecklenburg County are in ascendance.\n\nBoth Bishop and Democrat Dan McCready hail from Charlotte, giving them a close-up look at the demographic realignment of the Trump era. Bishop, a state senator, was one of just a few local Republicans to survive the Democratic wave election in 2018.\n\n\u201cObviously, Mecklenburg has changed,\u201d Bishop said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a bluer area in its entirety, even my [state] Senate district. So it\u2019s a little tougher there, and the president may have more headwinds there.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

And the GOP is going all-out to keep the seat, which has been held by Republicans since the 1960s, in the party\u2019s hands: Between House Republicans\u2019 official campaign arm and the top pro-GOP super PAC, Republicans have boosted Bishop with more than $5 million in outside spending.\n\nIn line with the district\u2019s historical GOP lean, McCready is campaigning as a bipartisan candidate who will put \u201ccountry over party.\u201d He opposes congressional efforts to impeach Trump but says the president should defeated at the ballot box next year.\n\nHis campaign has emphasized health care as the top issue, citing Bishop\u2019s votes in the state legislature against curbing prescription drug costs and opposition to Medicaid expansion.\n\nStill, especially in his efforts to connect with rural voters, McCready echoes some of the president\u2019s positions.\n\n\u201cThe first thing to understand about folks east of Charlotte is their communities have been devastated by the trade deals out of Washington \u2014 perpetrated by both parties,\u201d he said in an interview in his South Charlotte campaign office. \u201cThe textile jobs are largely gone. The main streets that used to be bustling at lunchtime 30, 40 years ago \u2014 many of them sit empty now. What you\u2019ve got to understand is that people feel that politicians in both parties have let them down, and they\u2019re right.\u201d\n\nBishop is campaigning as an ardent supporter of Trump and his agenda. In his interview here, Bishop described \u201can unrelenting trifecta of opposition\u201d to Trump as president from Democrats, the news media \u201cand even official law enforcement and intelligence agencies.\u201d\n\nAsked about his first priorities in Washington should he win Tuesday, Bishop suggested he would join the ranks of Trump\u2019s most outspoken attack dogs in Congress. \u201cI think defending the president \u2014 and being vocal about that \u2014 will be a role I intend to take immediately,\u201d he said.\n\nBishop is also leaning on some of Trump\u2019s core issues, particularly the still-growing economy and immigration. He\u2019s seeking to yoke McCready to prominent Democrats \u2014 in the interview, he name-dropped presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Beto O\u2019Rourke, Rep. Adam Schiff, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and actress Debra Messing \u2014 and Bishop is running a TV ad critical of the Mecklenburg County sheriff, who is refusing to work with federal immigration authorities.\n\nPublic and private polls show the two candidates running neck-and-neck ahead of Election Day. That\u2019s despite the fact that Trump carried the seat in 2016 by 12 percentage points.\n\nBut the winds quickly shifted ahead of the 2018 midterm elections. Last November, Republican pastor Mark Harris appeared to survive the Democratic wave, edging McCready by 905 votes. But credible allegations of absentee ballot fraud in Bladen County linked to Harris\u2019 campaign led the state board of elections to throw out the result and order a new election.\n\nMcCready, a first-time candidate and Marine combat veteran, won the Mecklenburg part of the district by 10 percentage points, despite Trump\u2019s 3-point win there two years earlier. McCready also carried five of the other six counties that comprise the district \u2014 which, while rural, also contain significant African-American and Native American populations that boost Democrats.\n\nBut McCready also lost Union County, a big Republican stronghold just across the interstate that rings Charlotte, by a whopping 20 points.\n\n\u201cIf you had to pick one district in the state that was the most honest cross-section of the state, it would be this one,\u201d said Jeff Jackson, a Democratic state senator from Charlotte. \u201cIt\u2019s got urban, suburban, exurban and rural. But it\u2019s also got other layers of things that are distinctly North Carolinian: It\u2019s got a major military population. It\u2019s got one of the nation\u2019s largest banking centers.\u201d\n\nAsked what Republicans can do to reverse their losses in cities and metro areas, Bishop said he thinks voters may eventually come back into the fold as cities change.\n\n\u201cLook at San Francisco. I mean, I see things on TV every day,\u201d said Bishop. \u201cIt\u2019s a fabulous place, but you have endless encampments of people on the street, and people defecating and urinating on the street, and drug[s] and needles. I mean, just a lot of stuff that you wouldn\u2019t expect to happen in a place that otherwise is known for affluence. And I don\u2019t want to see that kind of thing happen to Charlotte.\u201d\n\nBishop will join Trump Monday night for the rally in Fayetteville, a military-oriented community anchored by nearby Fort Bragg, where Bishop could benefit from a late Trump-driven turnout boost.\n\n\u201cRight now with the absentee voting, Cumberland [County] is running behind where it was in November of 2018,\u201d said Michael Bitzer, a political science professor at Catawba College who has analyzed the early voting numbers. \u201cA rural county, primarily military oriented with the bases \u2014 that seems fit for a Trump rally.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump will be in Fayetteville Monday, Vice President Mike Pence will stump for Bishop in the more suburban Union County earlier in the day.\n\n\u201cI really like having the vice president doing a noontime event and the president doing an evening event,\u201d said Michael Whatley, the state GOP chairman. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter so much where they\u2019re going to be. I think they\u2019re both going to be big draws.\u201d\n\nBoth candidates say the 2018 controversy that prompted the re-do election is not a major factor for voters. But both think it could help them on the margins of a close election.\n\n\u201cAll those votes were cast, and almost every one of them was a bona fide vote. And they were cast aside,\u201d Bishop said. \u201cThat\u2019s a loss that can\u2019t be overstated. I know there are people who are resentful of the fact that their votes were cast aside.\u201d\n\nMcCready, on the other hand, describes the do-over as a chance for voters to get \u201cjustice.\u201d Asked about the end of what has been a 27-month campaign for the office, McCready said the scandal had motivated him to keep running.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in God\u2019s hands now,\u201d McCready said. \u201cThis, for me, was a calling from the beginning. I was ready to go back to my four little kids and my clean-energy business after the race last time. But when we saw them steal people\u2019s most sacred right \u2014 the right to vote \u2014 I fought back because it was the right thing to do.\u201d", "description": "Tuesday\u2019s congressional election features a stark suburban-rural divide, one of the hallmarks of the Trump era.", "authors": ["Steven Shepard"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/0d/e7/2c0d2d7644d8b0bf4b6146517146/190908-nc-9-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
