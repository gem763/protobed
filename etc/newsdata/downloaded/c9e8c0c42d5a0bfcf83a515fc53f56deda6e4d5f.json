(Answer: It represented the burden of the national debt.)\u201d The Inquirer reported. \u201cSanford, who is challenging a politician obsessed with crowd size, interacted with just one person who wasn\u2019t a journalist, one of his two aides or the French teens.\u201d\n\nMr. Sanford, who joins primary challengers former Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh and former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, didn\u2019t appear fazed by the low turnout. He told The Inquirer that he\u2019s aware his campaign will be short-lived if he can\u2019t garner some level of excitement.\n\n\u201cNobody knows me in Philadelphia. I get it,\u201d said Mr. Sanford, a former South Carolina governor. \u201cI think in life we all do what we can do, what\u2019s within our power to have an effect. So we\u2019re just sort of moving along as we go along.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s an appetite in terms of people\u2019s concerns on the financial realities of our country and the way in which we are at a tipping point, then there\u2019s going to be some level of measure and movement with regard to the campaign,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd if there\u2019s not, there won\u2019t be. And it will be short-lived.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
