They\u2019ve just said no. It\u2019s sexism pure and simple.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s absolutely ridiculous to say women are more hardworking or polite.\u2019\n\nJorge said they stuck by their comments and mentioned it in a now deleted post on their Facebook page.\n\nHe added: \u2018They said \u201cin my opinion women are better on phone by taking takeaway orders of customers. They\u2019re patient, they are hard working.\u201d\u2018\n\nJorge, who was born female before transitioning, says it is \u2018absolutely ridiculous\u2019 to say women are better at the role (Picture: Kennedy News and Media)\n\nJorge sent his CV and covering letter saw the advert on Facebook, which he used to send across his covering letter and CV.\n\nAfter being refused by the chip shop, incensed supporters urged him to report the business for gender discrimination.\n\nHe added: \u2018My confidence hasn\u2019t been knocked because I\u2019ve had some nice comments, but I\u2019ve been looking for work now for the last few months.\n\n\u2018I\u2019d clean toilets if I had to \u2013 I\u2019m one of those people.\u2019\n\n\u2018People are telling me to report them and I think I probably should, for other people too.\n\n\u2018They need to know what they\u2019ve done it wrong. They can\u2019t know it\u2019s wrong because you wouldn\u2019t put it in writing, surely?\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA man who identified himself as the acting manager of Anchor Fish and Chips admitted to sending the message to Jorge.\n\nHe said: \u2018Nothing was about discrimination \u2013 it was just a misunderstanding.\n\n\u2018Basically, we have had a few guys working here answering the phone but they weren\u2019t doing the job properly.\n\n\u2018We have a girl who has been working with us for more than a year. So I thought it was right to have a female answer the phone talking to people.\n\n\u2018I did not know it was illegal. I did not mean to discriminate against people.\n\nThe owner of the chip shop has distanced himself from the manager\u2019s comments (Picture: Google Maps)\n\n\u2018I couldn\u2019t post the advert just for a female. In my opinion, females do this job better than male staff. I just said \u2018in my opinion. I didn\u2019t say it was a fact.\u2019\n\nAfter Jorge shared his complaint online, he says the chippy doubled down in a post on their Facebook account, which has now been deleted.\n\nThey said: \u2018In my opinion, women are better for this job.\n\n\u2018We do have men and women drive[r]s, which is absolutely fine. I believe women are better and [more] patient for taking takeaway orders.\n\nOffice worker crushed to death at his desk by tyres falling through roof\n\n\u2018If you run a business you need to have [the] right people in [the] right shifts and positions. I hope it\u2019s clear enough why.\u2019\n\nThe owner has since distanced himself from the manager\u2019s comments said he would be happy to hire a man or woman for the job.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe added: \u2018I\u2019ll change my password [to our social media page]. He is not supposed to post stuff like that.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ll definitely do something about this. That\u2019s not the case. It\u2019s not my opinion.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
