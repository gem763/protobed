(David J. Phillip/AP)\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke has already backed mandatory buybacks for assault weapons, but at Thursday\u2019s Democratic debate, he left no ambiguity about what that would mean. \u201cHell, yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,\u201d he said.\n\nLess than an hour later, O\u2019Rourke received what he described as a \u201cdeath threat\u201d from a fellow Texas politician. \u201cMy AR is ready for you Robert Francis,\u201d Briscoe Cain, a Republican state representative from the Houston area, wrote on Twitter, using O\u2019Rourke\u2019 legal name.\n\nCain did not respond to multiple requests for comment about his message. But many read it as clear threat of violence, and a spokeswoman for O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign told The Washington Post that staffers had reported the tweet to the FBI.\n\n\u201cThis is a death threat, Representative,\u201d O\u2019Rourke wrote on Twitter. \u201cClearly, you shouldn\u2019t own an AR-15 \u2014 and neither should anyone else.\u201d\n\nCain shot back: \u201cYou\u2019re a child Robert Francis.\"\n\nTwitter also took quick action, removing the lawmaker\u2019s tweet roughly two hours after it appeared. A spokesman told The Post that it violated the company\u2019s terms of service, which prohibit violent threats.\n\nThousands responded to the tweet before it was taken down, and Cain engaged with some. Asked if he had just threatened to shoot a presidential candidate and former member of Congress, he replied, \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot.\u201d When another critic told him they had saved a screenshot of his comments for the FBI, the lawmaker responded, \u201cCool bro.\u201d\n\nI get ratioed in the reg. Good summary though. Come and take it! \u2014 \ud835\udc01\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc02\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27 (@BriscoeCain) September 13, 2019\n\nCain\u2019s provocation came shortly after a moderator at Thursday night\u2019s debate asked O\u2019Rourke if his proposal to require assault rifle owners to sell their weapons to the government amounted to taking away people\u2019s guns. As The Post\u2019s Amy B Wang reported, the former Texas congressman didn\u2019t flinch, saying that assault weapons such as AR-15s and AK-47s were developed for combat, and use the kind of high-impact, high-velocity round that \u201cshreds everything inside your body because it was designed to do that, so that you would bleed to death on a battlefield, not be able to get up and kill one of our soldiers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we see that being used against children,\u201d he said, \u201chell, yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.\u201d\n\nSince Aug. 3, when a gunman armed with an AK-style rifle killed 22 people at a Walmart in O\u2019Rourke\u2019s hometown of El Paso, the candidate has been an outspoken proponent of stricter gun-control measures, including mandatory buybacks. He had previously supported banning the sale of new AR-15 rifles but stopped short of advocating for taking existing guns out of circulation, telling talk radio station KFYO in 2018, \u201cIf you purchased that AR-15, if you own it, keep it, continue to use it responsibly.\u201d\n\nSince the mass shooting in El Paso, O\u2019Rourke has been emphatic about what a mandatory buyback would mean. Asked by a reporter earlier this month if he could address fears that the government was going to take away people\u2019s assault rifles, he replied, \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d But his forceful \u201chell, yes\u201d on Thursday became one of the most memorable lines of the presidential debate. By the end of the night, it had turned into a slogan, appearing in red, white and blue letters on T-shirts sold on O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign website.\n\nThe proposal has widespread support among Democrats nationally \u2014 74 percent support a mandatory buyback program, compared to 31 percent of Republicans, a recent Washington Post-ABC News poll found.\n\nCain\u2019s assertion that his AR-15 was \u201cready\u201d struck many as insensitive in light of the mass shootings that took place last month in El Paso and Odessa, Tex., where a gunman armed with an assault-style rifle killed seven and injured 22.\n\n\u201cIn case you forgot, people were just killed in El Paso,\u201d responded Mary E. Gonzales, a Democratic member of the Texas House. \u201cPeople were murdered. The language you are using and the way you are using it is dangerous.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to reporters after the debate, O\u2019Rourke said that Cain\u2019s comment \u201csure reads\u201d like a death threat. \u201cI think it\u2019s a really irresponsible thing for him to do,\u201d he added, \u201cespecially somebody who is a public servant and in a position of public trust to be sending that kind of message.\u201d\n\nResponding to Texas State Rep. Briscoe Cain saying \"My AR is ready for you\" @BetoORourke says \"I think it;s a really irresponsible thing for him to do... we are a nation of laws and if that (mandatory buyback) ends up becoming the law.. we expect people to comply w/ it\" pic.twitter.com/Z5eUTMYTK2 \u2014 Tim Perry (@tperry518) September 13, 2019\n\nCain, an attorney, frequently uses his official social media accounts to air inflammatory and hyperbolic views. On Wednesday, for instance, he suggested on Twitter that the Texas legislature should \u201cabolish\u201d the famously liberal city of Austin.\n\nFirst elected to the Texas legislature in 2016, Cain was ranked the most conservative lawmaker in the state\u2019s House of Representatives the following year, and he also received the dubious distinction of appearing on Texas Monthly\u2019s list of the 10 worst legislators in the state in 2017. Typically, the publication explained, freshmen lawmakers are exempted from the list, but they cited Cain\u2019s \u201cuninformed and belligerent performance.\u201d\n\nAn outspoken supporter of Second Amendment rights, Cain was kicked out of the Texas Democratic Party convention in 2018 after he showed up with what appeared to be a sidearm and began handing out fake yard signs that said, \u201cThis home is a gun-free safe space,\u201d the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported.\n\nThe paper noted that when students across the nation left class to protest gun violence in the wake of a mass shooting that killed 17 in Parkland, Fla., last year, Cain responded by introducing legislation that would temporarily revoke state funding from any Texas schools where similar walkouts took place.\n\nDavid Hogg, a former Parkland student and co-founder of March for Our Lives, argued that Cain\u2019s tweet proved the necessity of mandatory buybacks.\n\n\u201cIf you threaten to kill a presidential candidate you should not have a gun,\u201d he wrote.", "description": "The lawmaker's tweet was removed for violating Twitter's terms of service, and O'Rourke's campaign said they had reported it to the FBI.", "authors": ["Antonia Noori Farzan", "Reporter For The Morning Mix", "September At Am", "Antonia Noori Farzan Is A Reporter On The Washington Post'S Morning Mix Team.
