The shambolic policymaking of the Trump administration has thrown the Middle East into further chaos, while countries are increasingly viewing Russia as a source of stability.\n\nThe high respect afforded to Russian President Vladimir Putin during his visit this week to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates speaks of a new geopolitical reality in the region. Both countries are traditional US allies, but it is Russia that appears to be the one held in more regard.\n\nRussia\u2019s pragmatic policy of \u201ctalking with everyone\u201d sees it maintaining good relations with a host of nations, notwithstanding that several of these nations are among themselves either estranged or implacable enemies. Putin is hosted by the Saudi and Emirati monarchs despite the fact that Moscow has a growing alliance with Iran \u2013 the perceived Shia nemesis of the Sunni potentates in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi.\n\nAlso on rt.com Just like home: UAE sends Russian road patrol after Putin to make him feel welcome (VIDEOS)\n\nRussia is a staunch defender of Syria which puts it at odds with an array Middle East states, including Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Israel, which have sponsored a proxy war to oust Syrian President Bashar Assad. Yet, in spite of this, Moscow has also attained close relations with Syria\u2019s adversaries. It\u2019s an impressive balancing act.\n\nThis is not just a matter of Russia sidling alongside everyone from an unscrupulous, expedient policy. Moscow has criticized Israel for its air strikes on Syrian territory, warning it to back off. Russia has also censored Saudi and other Gulf Arab states for hostility towards Iran and for blaming Tehran for sabotage attacks on shipping in the region without any evidence. Moscow has at times condemned the Saudi-led war on Yemen.\n\nRussia\u2019s foreign policy is principled and consistent. For nations it is historically aligned with, like Syria and Iran, it remains loyal in its strategic commitments. A classic example is Russia\u2019s military intervention from the end of 2015 to defend the Syrian nation from imminent defeat by Western, NATO and Arab-backed proxies.\n\nRussia has consistently backed Iran in terms of upholding the 2015 international nuclear accord, thereby defying Washington\u2019s bullying ultimatums for nations to boycott trading with Tehran.\n\nAlso on rt.com Putin visits Saudi Arabia for first time since 2007 \u2013 but can Russia be friends with EVERYONE in the Middle East?\n\nMoscow\u2019s policy demonstrated in the Middle East is an extension of its wider international outlook of supporting multilateralism and mutual cooperation with all nations. We see that in the way Russia has been a keen supporter of China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative for promoting global economic partnership. Russia is a linchpin for Eurasian economic development in which peace and prosperity are seen as mutual win-win outcomes from pursuit of respectful reciprocation.\n\nThis conduct of geopolitical relations is anathema to America\u2019s domineering policy. Washington\u2019s winner-takes-all approach to international relations necessarily divides the world into those who kowtow to American imperatives and those who are cast as enemies because they don\u2019t kowtow. The former camp are euphemistically described as US \u201callies\u201d, but they are essentially serfs and vassals for the gratification of American imperial interests.\n\nThe trouble is that such policy sooner or later runs into contradictions of its own making. Dividing-and-ruling the world can be advantageous to a point, as it was for many decades following WWII, during the Cold War with the Soviet Union. For the US militarized capitalist economy, zero-sum policy ensured lucrative profits, for a while. But sooner or later, the war economy and warmongering policies that underpin US geopolitical ambitions of dominance start to undermine its very own power.\n\nEssentially, the profoundly unethical and criminal policies that promote US unilateral power become impossible to conceal, despite the massive systematic help of deceitful Western corporate media which function to sanitize and obscure the crimes underpinning US would-be dominance. Eventually, even supposed allies of the rogue superpower begin to become unnerved and anxious from the boundless perfidy.\n\nAlso on rt.com Westerners who propped up Islamist \u2018moderate rebels\u2019 suddenly realize they're terrorists as they launch \u2018genocide\u2019 of Kurds\n\nThe past week has provided an astounding eye-opener of the sheer recklessness and destructiveness of the US in the Middle East.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s abandoning of Kurdish allies in Syria to the mercy of an onslaught by Turkey has left other American allies in the region shocked by the transactional treachery of Washington. Questions are being asked by Saudi rulers and in Israel about how reliable is their supposed protector, the US.\n\nThe Saudi ambassador to Britain is reported this week as saying that the House of Saud is \u201closing confidence\u201d in the Trump administration and its erstwhile promises that it would defend the kingdom in the event of a war with Iran. The same misgivings apply in Israel.\n\nThis fearful distrust of the US \u201cprotector\u201d was compounded by the drone and missile strikes on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil industry centers last month. The Saudis and Americans blamed Iran, even though Tehran flatly rejected the accusations, and in spite of the fact that the attacks were claimed by the Houthi rebels in Yemen.\n\nAlso on rt.com US defense failure\u2026 Why Washington has to blame Iran over Saudi attacks\n\nThe thing is, however, Washington balked at its accusations against Iran in terms of taking a military response. Just as well, for those accusations are probably false. But by the Trump administration\u2019s own actions, its words are evidently all bark and no bite.\n\nOver decades, the US has plied billions of dollars of weapons into Saudi Arabia, as with other countries across the Middle East. But paradoxically, those countries are today even more insecure and leery of Washington\u2019s strategic intentions.\n\nSince the US wars launched on Afghanistan and Iraq over the past two decades, the Middle East has become ever-more unstable and volatile. That is because American foreign policy is conducted on the basis of dominance which by definition involves aggression and military occupation.\n\nAmerica\u2019s military doctrine is driven by confrontation, selling weapons to other countries as part of its policy of projecting power, which is in itself aggressive. Thus, the world under the sway of US power will always be prone to tensions, conflicts, war, and killing, because the bottomline is America\u2019s warmongering corporate capitalism needs all that mayhem to make a financial killing.\n\nEventually, however, countries nominally allied with the US will end up reaping the bitter harvest that it sows.\n\nAlso on rt.com Putin gives Saudi king a GYRFALCON as gift, but the moment is somewhat ruined (VIDEOS)\n\nThat is why Russia is growing in stature as a leading power, especially in the Middle East. Western media may make cynical comments about Putin trying to make himself a \u201ckingmaker\u201d and \u201coffering himself as a peacemaker,\u201d but there is no need for this Russophobic cynicism.\n\nRussia\u2019s military doctrine and modern technology, such as the S-400 anti-missile system, is predicated on defense, not offense. This is the reverse of the American military doctrine. Hence, American so-called defense systems, like the Patriot, are inferior to Russian counterparts.\n\nThat difference revolves around the fundamental divergence between America\u2019s hegemonic ambitions and Russia\u2019s policy of pursuing multilateralism and partnership. That permits Russia to maintain relations and respect with all nations, even though it has priorities for certain allies. Nevertheless, the balanced policy enables nations to coexist and negotiate to overcome problems.\n\nThe Middle East needs more of Russia\u2019s type of balanced diplomacy. The region is evidently responding to Moscow with respect, whereas Washington\u2019s ruinous intrigues are seen with increasing contempt and repudiation.\n\nLike this story?
