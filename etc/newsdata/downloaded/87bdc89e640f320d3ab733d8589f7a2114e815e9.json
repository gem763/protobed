While I was there, on cue, the Italian government collapsed, and this timely juxtaposition of inner serenity and public turmoil prompted a few thoughts about our larger dispensation.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine a better place to ponder the arc of our civilization\u2019s history than the rich, hilly lands from Tuscany down to Rome. It\u2019s partly the views\u2014across vine-covered slopes and cypress-studded hilltops to gorgeous honeyed-stone villages\u2014and the long lunches of pasta and red wine that induce a contemplative mood under the relentless sun.\n\nBut it\u2019s also the ubiquitous reminders of our historical roots in this fresco landscape. You can make a solid case that the small swath of hilly terrain between Florence and Rome has had more impact on our civilization than any other territory anywhere on Earth.\n\nThe empire that grew out of the little city on the Tiber bequeathed a language, literature and institutions whose heritage continues to shape our lives today. A millennium after the collapse of that empire, the Florentines and their local rivals secured achievements in art, architecture, science and commerce that represent the most intense flowering of human creativity in history. The church that still calls itself universal and ruled much of this land for centuries has guided the lives of billions of adherents.\n\n\u201c The single-child family is almost standard, so millions of Italians have no siblings, aunts, uncles, cousins. \u201d\n\nBut what of it all now? The condition of modern Italy evinces the biblical lamentation for another lost civilization: Quomodo sedet sola civitas. How lonely the city stands.\n\nYou can see here a metaphor for the contemporary condition of the West. In Rome this week, they have just about finished putting together Italy\u2019s 62nd (I think) government in 75 years. The country\u2019s comic political instability was the source of humor for decades.\n\nBut no one is laughing now. Italy has had no real economic growth for almost 20 years. Its accumulated public debt is almost 1\u00bd times the value of its GDP. Just about all the ambitious Italians I meet want their children to be educated in the U.S. or U.K.\n\nThe country was among the first in the West to enter a demographic death spiral. The Italian birthrate is below replacement. The single-child family is almost standard, so millions of Italians have no siblings, aunts, uncles, cousins. The extended family, that natural community of love and support, is going extinct.\n\nThe traditional centerpieces of life\u2014family, workplace, community\u2014have been eroded to the bone. Religious observance has collapsed. In the beautiful Tuscan churches I visited, there were probably more priceless works of Renaissance art than there were worshipers. A Caravaggio for every communicant.\n\nThe Italian genius for creativity is undiminished, though. I was staying near Montalcino, a small city in southern Tuscany of almost ineffable beauty. Fifty years ago, it was headed the way of many similar European towns. But someone discovered that the local grapes produced one of the finest wines in the world\u2014Brunello\u2014and with investment, a lot of hard work and marketing flair, the place exploded with energy.\n\nIn much of the country, however, depopulation is advancing. Moving into the empty spaces have been waves of immigrants, many from North Africa and the Middle East. The migrants have filled vital gaps in the labor force, but the transformation of Italian towns has left increasing numbers of citizens resentful, fearful for their identity.\n\nIt was this fear that drove support for the League party and its charismatic leader, Matteo Salvini, who was pushed out of government in the political turmoil this month. Something tells me the unease that produced him means he will be back.\n\nThe common media trope is that he and his ilk across Europe are scary \u201cfar right.\u201d But their message\u2014strong borders, renewed national purpose, economic dynamism through tax cuts and smaller government\u2014resonates in this decaying economic and social landscape.\n\nWe tend to look at modern Italy and see an outlier, an extraordinary place whose past will far outlive its future. But maybe we should see it not as an exception but as a kind of pioneer of Western decline.", "description": "The country\u2019s rich history contrasts with today\u2019s economic and political turmoil.", "authors": ["Gerard Baker", "Gerard.Baker Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-EV893_BAKER_SOC_20190829153740.jpg"}
