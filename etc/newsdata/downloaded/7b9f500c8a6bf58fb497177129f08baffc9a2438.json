Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Tuesday refused to join Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) in calling for Twitter to shut down President Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter account.\n\nHarris \u2014 who has repeatedly called on Twitter to suspend the president\u2019s account \u2014 urged Warren to join her plea during Tuesday\u2019s Democrat debate. The California lawmaker urged Warren to \u201cjoin me in saying that his Twitter account should be shut down,\u201d to which Warren replied, \u201cno.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s figure out why it is that we have had laws on the books for antitrust for over a century and for decades now,\u201d Warren said, dismissing Harris\u2019s call.\n\n\u201cWe really need to address the elephant in the room, and that is how campaigns finance,\u201d she continued, reminding the audience of her pledge to refrain from taking money from big tech executives or Wall Street executives.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already agreed \u2014 Bernie and I \u2014 we\u2019re not taking any money from big pharma executives. You can\u2019t go behind closed doors and take the money of these executives and then turn around and expect that these are the people who are actually finally going to enforce the laws,\u201d Warren said.\n\n\u201cWe need campaign finance rules and practices that support us all,\u201d she added.\n\nHarris continued to push Warren to join her in calling for Twitter to ban Trump\u2019s account, but Warren did not budge.\n\n\u201cWhat I am saying is, that it seems to me that you would be able to join me in saying that the rule has to apply to Twitter the same way it does to Facebook,\u201d Harris said.\n\nWarren told Harris that she believes rules should apply across the board, to which Harris replied, \u201cso you would join me in saying Twitter should shut down that account.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to talk seriously about breaking up big tech, then we should ask if people are taking money from the big tech executives,\u201d Warren said, ignoring Harris\u2019s plea.", "description": "Sen.
