Elizabeth Warren speaks with reporters at the Manchester Democratic City Committee Flag Day Dinner in Manchester, N.H., June 14, 2019. (Brian Snyder/Reuters)\n\nThe more the media behave like the DNC\u2019s propaganda arm, the more Americans will dismiss them as such.\n\nElizabeth Warren is telling a lie about herself. Again. The media are covering for her. Again.\n\nIt is by now well established that Elizabeth Warren is a serial liar. She lied about her parents having to elope because of racism against her mother, who was white. She lied about being the first nursing mother to take the bar exam in New Jersey (which doesn\u2019t keep such records). She lied about being a \u201csingle mom\u201d when she met her second and present husband (she was still married, and had not yet filed for divorce). She lied about the death of Michael Brown, which was not a murder. Only recently, after more than 30 years, has she stopped lying about being a Cherokee and a woman of color.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLately Warren has been telling a story about how a boss supposedly fired her from a teaching gig after discerning at a glance that she was pregnant. Her own previous telling was otherwise: She walked away from that job.\n\nAfter teaching two days a week in 1971, \u201cBy the end of the first year I was visibly pregnant, and the principal did what principals did in those days: wished me luck, showed me the door, and hired someone else for the job,\u201d Warren says on the stump. The clear takeaway is that she was fired for being pregnant. On Twitter she added this week, \u201cBy June I was visibly pregnant \u2014 and the principal told me the job I\u2019d already been promised for the next year would go to someone else.\u201d (The principal in question, Edward Pruzinsky, died 20 years ago.)\n\nA Washington Free Beacon report found suggestive but not conclusive evidence: records from the Riverdale, N.J., Board of Education show that Warren was offered an extension on her contract as a two-day-a-week speech pathologist in April of 1971, but she resigned and her resignation was \u201caccepted with regret.\u201d True, it\u2019s conceivable that this is a kind of fiction and that Warren was forced to resign by that nasty principal who hated pregnant women. (Firing women for being pregnant has been illegal only since 1978). But the Free Beacon report happens to be perfectly consistent with Warren\u2019s previous version of the story, the version she told when she had no motive to whip up a tale of woe. In a 2007 interview, she said: \u201cI did that [teach] for a year, and then that summer I didn\u2019t have the education courses, so I was on an \u2018emergency certificate,\u2019 it was called. I went back to graduate school and took a couple of courses in education and said, \u2018I don\u2019t think this is going to work out for me.\u2019\u201d If the principal had fired her in June, why would she have needed to go to grad school over the summer to do course work?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe response from the media has been fatuous. Coverage falls into the following categories: Republicans pounce, and it must have happened to Warren because it happened to others, therefore the larger truth is what matters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA HuffPost piece by Amanda Terkel is a classic of partisan water-carrying: \u201cPeople Get Fired From Their Jobs Without Being \u2018Fired\u2019 All The Time.\u201d Yes, well, people win Nobel prizes all the time too, but I\u2019d still be lying if I said I was one of them. The issue is not whether the situation Warren describes ever happened to anyone else but whether she is telling the truth.\n\nUSA Today ran with this curiously discreet headline, seemingly constructed to warn readers that the matter was too trivial to read about: \u201cElizabeth Warren defends story that she was fired for being pregnant after more details surface.\u201d Instead of presenting facts as facts, it tarnished them as conservative-discovered details. This is one of the unloveliest tricks of the mainstream liberal press: They hate to do their jobs and dig up information if it might make preferred candidates look bad, so they get scooped by conservative outlets, then they sniff \u201cconsider the source\u201d when inconvenient truths appear. \u201cConservatives have latched on to the changes in her account as yet another example of a \u2018made up\u2019 story,\u2019 wrote the paper, \u201calong with the now-infamous claim to Native American ancestry.\u201d Which, er, has now been proven a lie.\n\nThe paper then buried Warren\u2019s lie under accounts of various women who said they had been discriminated against because they were pregnant. Note that when President Trump lies or says something that isn\u2019t true, the media happily set the record straight. There are only two issues allowed in the room: what Trump said, and the truth. No supporters are brought in to say they believe him. The HuffPost doesn\u2019t take pains to note that what Trump claimed has actually happened to others. And USA Today doesn\u2019t poison the wells by informing us \u201cliberals have latched on\u201d to something Trump said. Truth is framed as partisan only when doing so might aid the left.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe New York Times, taking on unpaid-publicist duties, served up the studiously non-judgmental headline \u201cElizabeth Warren Details Her Account of Losing Teaching Job Because of Pregnancy\u201d instead of something more pointed but also more informative, e.g. \u201cWarren Repeats Lie.\u201d The Times characterized her sticking to the lie as assertive and bold \u2014 \u201cpushing back against any suggestion that she had misrepresented\u201d her departure from the school. The paper claimed in a tweet that she was \u201crefuting\u201d rather than simply contradicting truthful reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe gong for most outlandish headline in a supposedly nonpartisan outlet goes to the Washington Post, though, for this beauty: \u201cConservatives claim Elizabeth Warren lied about pregnancy firing. Women reality-checked them on social media.\u201d A farrago of irrelevance, the piece noted that \u201cOn Twitter, women told stories of being fired outright for being pregnant\u2026or being told during interviews or meetings that pregnancy was a mark against them as they competed for positions, promotions and raises. They wrote of contracts not being renewed after they gave birth, and of positions that were revoked\u2026\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of this has any bearing on whether Elizabeth Warren lied. It\u2019s like saving other boys at Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s private school mistreated women, so he must have also. The WaPo went all-out to frame the question of truth as a matter of whatever the mob wants it to be: \u201cThe chorus of voices sharing tales of misconduct served as yet another rebuttal to a concerted campaign to undermine a prominent woman\u2019s account of misconduct.\u201d The story dismissed the details Warren supplied in 2007 as simply \u201can old interview\u201d that provided \u201csupposed evidence that she has been misleading,\u201d leaving unmentioned that 2007 Warren flatly contradicts 2019 Warren.\n\nBy covering for Warren\u2019s tall tale, the media are ensuring that the story will stay alive (because it\u2019s disputed), that Warren will keep lying (because she rightly thinks the media have her back) and that its self-image as a profession of brave truth-seekers will continue to decay.
