Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said on Friday that the Democrats' impeachment push isn\u2019t driven by facts, and added that the transcript of President Trump\u2019s phone call with the president of Ukraine is not an \"illegal quid pro quo.\"\n\n\"Washington is always a circus, but this is three rings with all the clowns and it\u2019s nuts right now,\" Cruz, a former practicing attorney, told \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom.\u201d\n\nCruz reacted to the House of Representatives moving forward on an impeachment inquiry this week, though they have not held a formal vote on the matter. Democrats accuse President Trump of abusing his office by requesting that Ukraine investigate his potential 2020 election rival, former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nKARL ROVE: PELOSI WAS FORCED TO PURSUE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY\n\nTrump's July conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky triggered a whistleblower complaint that touched off a political tempest in Washington, D.C. The complaint was released publicly Thursday, alleging Trump used the \"power of his office to solicit interference\" from Ukraine in the 2020 election -- and that White House officials subsequently tried to \"lock down\" records of that phone call.\n\nSome Democrats allege Trump implicitly sought a quid pro quo - by trying to trade U.S. military aid for dirt on Biden - but the White House has vigorously denied it.\n\nCruz said House Democrats are still angry about the 2016 election and are doing everything they can to uproot the president from office.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cAs a result, they\u2019re not doing their job.
