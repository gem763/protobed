The book will be released on Oct. 15.\n\n\u201cAll the press around it is nothing but good news for the sales prospects of the book,\u201d Jonathan Segura, the executive editor of the trade magazine Publishers Weekly, told FOX Business.\n\nThe book has drawn big headlines over new accusations that former \u201cToday\u201d host Matt Lauer raped another NBC News employee at the 2014 Sochi Olympics and company leaders were aware. It also details how film producer Harvey Weinstein allegedly got NBC to back away from the story about his own sexual misconduct \u2014 which Farrow had been working on \u2014 by letting network leaders know that he could reveal accusations against Lauer.\n\nLauer has denied the rape accusation in a public letter. NBC News chair Andy Lack has disputed Farrow's account in an internal memo, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Company leaders have said Farrow\u2019s story wasn\u2019t up to standards. He later published a piece on Weinstein in The New Yorker.\n\nThe headline-drawing back-and-forth drama involving big names and powerful executives may provide more fuel on the fire for sales of \u201cCatch and Kill.\u201d\n\nPublisher Little, Brown and Company declined to share any advance sales figures with FOX Business. But the book\u2019s early jump on Amazon indicates it could surpass sales of Farrow\u2019s last book, \u201cWar on Peace,\u201d which spent five weeks on The New York Times\u2019 nonfiction bestsellers list last year.\n\n\u201cWar on Peace\u201d detailed what Farrow described as the \u201cdecline\u201d of U.S. diplomacy and worldwide influence, drawing on his experience in the State Department. But publishers have seen some reader \u201cburnout\u201d on books reporting on politics and the Trump administration since the big success of Michael Wolff\u2019s \u201cFire and Fury\u201d and Bob Woodward\u2019s \u201cFear,\u201d according to Segura.\n\nWith \u201cCatch and Kill\u201d reportedly holding many revelations about headline-making scandals, Segura said Farrow likely has a subject that will hold the public\u2019s attention.\n\n\u201cThis is a different thing altogether,\u201d Segura said. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of interest around it.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe Said,\u201d by Times reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, who beat Farrow to breaking the Weinstein story, has spent three weeks on the best sellers list since it was released last month.\n\nAt the end of the day, the writing also just needs to be good for a title to sell well, according to Segura.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s nothing else that\u2019s true in this world right now, it\u2019s that people are hungry for narrative,\u201d he said.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "The upcoming book is getting a boost in sales from big buzz in the press.", "authors": ["James Leggate"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/catch-kill-farrow-getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
