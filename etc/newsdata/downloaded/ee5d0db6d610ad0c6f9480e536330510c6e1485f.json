A disorderly, no deal exit of the UK would be extremely harmful for all sides,\" said Markus J Beyrer, CEO of Business Europe in a statement.\n\nJohnson on Friday said he was \"cautiously optimistic\" before his meeting with Juncker, the first with the EU executive chief since he came to power at the end of July.\n\nA two-day European summit is scheduled to be held on October 17 in Brussels, which could be the last chance for an agreement between the two parties.\n\n\"We urge both sides to undertake all reasonable efforts and engage in constructive dialogue to avoid no-deal,\" Beyer said.\n\n\"In this context, we expect the UK government is able to bring viable options to the table as a matter of urgency,\" he added.", "description": "A shock exit by Britain from the EU without an agreement would be \"a disaster\", the European employers' organisation, Business Europe, has warned.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9354/7e8b050cc5d14a2e9d0076b0bd1488ad.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
