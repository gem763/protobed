Several neighbors lost their homes in the wildfire. Harrison Hill, USA TODAY\n\nFueled by high winds, the California wildfires threatening an estimated 20 million people have shown few signs of slowing down, leaving firefighters throughout the state working around the clock to keep residents safe.\n\nIn Southern California, LeBron James and his family were among many forced to leave their homes and relocate because of the Getty Fire. However, his presence was still felt on Tuesday, when he expressed his gratitude by dispatching a taco truck to the first responders' base camp to feed them lunch.\n\n\"It definitely takes a lot of bravery, a lot of commitment, a lot of sacrifice in any job that you take, but when you're at the risk of your life any time you're called upon, it's a different type of mind state that you have to be in,\" James told ESPN. \"So it definitely doesn't go without notice and without appreciation.\"\n\nLos Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti captured the moment in a tweet in which he thanked the Lakers star for his generosity.\n\nThank you, @KingJames, for generously sending a taco truck to support our @LAFD firefighters, first responders, and partner agencies working to fight the #GettyFire. pic.twitter.com/rgTSMgWXLU \u2014 Mayor Eric Garcetti (@MayorOfLA) October 29, 2019\n\nLater in the day, James and the Los Angeles Lakers had to turn their attention to a home game against the Memphis Grizzlies at Staples Center.\n\nHe doesn't expect to be at his best.\n\n\"Your body is definitely a little off track,\" James said. \"For me, I'm on a real sleep cycle when it comes to sleeping and preparing for the game. It's kind of been thrown off a lot.\"", "description": "After being forced to evacuate his home, Lakers star LeBron James dispatched a taco truck to feed first responders battling the Getty wildfires.", "authors": ["Steve Gardner", "Published P.M.
