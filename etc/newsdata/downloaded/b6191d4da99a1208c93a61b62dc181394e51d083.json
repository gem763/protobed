Links to the previous four articles are below.)\n\nWhy does a fund that has underperformed its benchmark for the past five, 10 and 15 years have $20.4 billion in it? The answer is that investors with long memories are still willing to pay professionals not only to screen stocks for quality but to gain further insight through access to management.\n\nThis may be especially important with systemic risks from the trade conflict with China and Brexit as the U.K. tries to leave the European Union, along with signs of a slowing U.S. economy.\n\nThe Franklin Rising Dividends Fund FRDPX, +1.27% seeks to achieve capital growth by investing at least 80% in companies that consistently raise their dividends. It makes no difference how high a stock\u2019s current yield is.\n\nThe fund has blown away its benchmark \u2014 the S&P 500 index SPX, +1.08% \u2014over a 20-year horizon, largely because of strong outperformance in the wake of the dot-com bubble and following the Great Recession. But it has struggled more recently, as a handful of technology stocks \u2014 which don\u2019t meet its investing criteria \u2014 have led the market.\n\n\u201cCompanies that have demonstrated sustained dividend growth tend to hold up well in challenging markets,\u201d Nicholas Getaz, a manager of the fund said during an interview. He has co-managed the fund since 2014. Donald Taylor has been the lead manager since 1996. The other co-manager is Matt Quinlan.\n\n\u2018Resilience\u2019 and Microsoft\n\n\u201cWe use very careful analysis of the resilience of any position,\u201d Getaz said. He named Microsoft MSFT, +1.17%, the fund\u2019s largest holding, as an example of a company with the advantages he and his colleagues are looking for, including \u201ca leading market position, products that are industry norms and standards, innovative growth drivers and a business model that increases resilience.\u201d\n\nHe was referring to the distribution model for Microsoft Office 365. Users pay annual subscriptions and get continual updates and cloud storage services. This brings in more revenue than the old model, when a user might wait many years before upgrading to a newer version and paying again.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s sales for its fiscal 2019 ended June 30 were up 12% from the previous year, while operating income was up 20%. The company\u2019s earnings show very strong numbers for various office and cloud services segments.\n\nMicrosoft is paying a quarterly dividend of 46 cents on its common shares, which makes for a yield of only 1.33%, based on the closing price of $137.86 on Aug. 30. Then again, the company increased its dividend by four cents, or 9.5%, in September 2018. With such strong numbers, it is reasonable to expect the company to increase the dividend again by a significant amount later this month.\n\nLooking back, Microsoft has increased its dividend by amounts ranging from 7.7% to 25% each year over the past nine years. During 2009, the company left the dividend unchanged, which wasn\u2019t surprising considering how long the postcrisis recovery took and how many companies were forced to cut their payouts.\n\nMicrosoft provides an excellent example of improving yield-to-cost. If you purchased shares of Microsoft at the close on Aug. 29, 2014 and decided not to reinvest your dividends (to keep our math simple), you would have paid $45.43 a share. The quarterly dividend at that time was 28 cents a share, for a dividend yield of 2.47%. Fast-forward five years and the current dividend yield on the shares is only 1.33%. But based on your original price of $45.43 and the current quarterly payout of 46 cents, the yield-to-cost for your shares is 4.05%. That\u2019s not bad, especially when you keep in mind that the share price has more than tripled.\n\n\u2018Culture investors\u2019\n\nOf course not every company that steadily increases its dividend will triple its share price in five years, as Microsoft has.\n\nGetaz said he, the other fund managers and their analysts follow \u201ca debate-driven consensus-oriented process,\u201d to narrow down investment candidates after an initial screen that includes:\n\n\u2022 Dividend increases during at least eight of the past 10 years, with no cuts.\n\n\u2022 A payout ratio below 65% of earnings.\n\nIf a company stops meeting that criteria, \u201cwe won\u2019t add\u201d to positions, Getaz said. But the fnd managers might not sell should they believe the condition is temporary or if it would otherwise be an inopportune moment to sell.\n\nFollowing the screens, Getaz and his colleagues focus on analyzing business models to \u201cbe reasonably sure\u201d that the next 10 years will be successful, after looking back 10 years during the initial screening process.\n\nGetaz emphasized the access Franklin Templeton has to corporate management teams as a crucial component of the team\u2019s management strategy. It\u2019s obvious that corporate executives cannot tell Getaz anything that wouldn\u2019t be disclosed publicly. However, the meetings can shed light on a company\u2019 strengths and weaknesses, he said.\n\n\u201cOne of the advantages with meeting with management is taking a sampling, over the long term, of how they answer the same question,\u201d he said.\n\nFranklin Templeton Investments Nicholas Getaz, co-portfolio manager of the Franklin Rising Dividends Fund.\n\n\u201cI call us \u2018culture investors\u2019 to some extent,\u201d Getaz said. After starting with senior executives, he tries to talk to divisional leaders as well, to \u201cproduce a mosaic.\u201d\n\nA company with a strong culture from the top down can \u201coften find a way to prosper through difficult environments\u201d because it can continue to innovate and make operational improvements, he added.\n\n\u201cThat is a real benefit to sitting down with a CEO or CFO,\u201d Getaz said. \u201cWhenever I meet with leadership, I always ask them to in their own words characterize the company\u2019s culture. Some are less passionate; some have been incredibly passionate.\u201d\n\nTwo other companies Getaz discussed with cultures he admires are Linde PLC LIN, +0.18% (a position reflecting the fund\u2019s previous investment in Praxair, which Linde acquired in May) and Air Products and Chemicals APD, +0.82%.\n\nWhen discussing Air Products and Chemicals, Getaz said, \u201cboring is beautiful.\u201d Discounting the \u201cexcitement premium\u201d put on some stocks, he said there are advantages holding companies that focus on operational excellence rather than branding.\n\nHe said the industrial gasses provided by Linde and Air Products \u201cplay a pivotal role in production techniques,\u201d as well as health care (the giant oxygen tanks you see outside hospitals, for example) and even energy production.\n\nFund holdings\n\nHere are the 15 largest holdings (out of 64) of the Franklin Rising Dividends Fund as of July 31:\n\nPerformance\n\nThe Franklin Rising Dividends Fund has various share classes with different annual expense ratios, depending on how shares are distributed. So if you consider purchasing shares of this or any other fund, it\u2019s very important to consider the entire expense picture, including the annual fee for your investment adviser (if you have one). The adviser\u2019s portion of your total fee may vary depending on the share class.\n\nThe Class A shares FRDPX, +1.27% have a 5.5% sales charge (or load); however, that is typically avoided as it is currently set up with distribution through advisers. The Class A shares have annual expenses of 0.88% of assets, a level considered \u201clow\u201d by Morningstar for actively managed funds in its Large Growth fund category.\n\nWe are using the Class A shares for the following total-return comparisons because that is the oldest share class.\n\nTotal returns (with dividends reinvested and excluding any sales charges) for the Franklin Rising Dividends Fund\u2019s Class A shares have lagged those of the S&P 500 for various long periods, with Getaz pointing out that the outperformance during the financial crisis has \u201crolled off,\u201d because more than 10 years have passed since the postcrisis low in March 2009. But the performance pattern is fascinating as you look further back.\n\nFirst, here\u2019s a comparison of average annual returns for various periods through Aug. 30:\n\nAverage return - 3 years Average return - 5 years Average return - 10 years Average return - 15 years Average return - 20 years Franklin Rising Dividends Fund - Class A 11.7% 9.7% 12.5% 8.2% 8.4% S&P 500 index 12.6% 10.1% 13.4% 9.0% 6.1% Source: FactSet\n\nThe fund has underperformed for all periods on the table except 20 years, for which it has outperformed considerably. The 20-year outperformance (illustrated in the second chart below) is quite similar to the pattern of performance for Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway BRK.B, +0.64% BRK.A, +0.65% .\n\nGetaz said the fund\u2019s underperformance against the index over the past five years reflects the very strong performance of Apple AAPL, +1.70% and the rest of the FAANG group (Facebook FB, +2.60%, Amazon.com AMZN, +0.60%, Netflix NFLX, +0.77% and Google holding company Alphabet GOOG, +1.11% GOOGL, +1.09%.\n\nThese companies haven\u2019t meet the fund\u2019s criteria for dividend growth, but they have been viewed by investors as \u201ca collective high-growth theme,\u201d Getaz said. He also said that over the past 12 to 18 months, \u201cthe market seems to have broadened its appetite for quality, which we believe has benefited the [fund\u2019s] strategy.\u201d\n\nThese two charts point to two remarkable aspects of the performance of the fund and the benchmark index.\n\nFirst, 15-year total returns through Aug. 30:\n\nFactSet\n\nAnd now 20 years:\n\nFactSet\n\nThe fund has greatly outperformed the S&P 500 for 20 years. It\u2019s also worth pointing out that the S&P 500\u2019s 20-year total return is significantly lower than its 15-year return, while the fund\u2019s 20-year performance is much greater than its 15-year return.\n\n\u201cThe 20 year look-back captures both the financial crisis, as well as the dot-com crash,\u201d Getaz said, illustrating his point about higher-quality stocks providing stability as part of an investor\u2019s portfolio.\n\nRecent articles on dividend-stock investing in a world of very low interest rates:\n\n\u2022 25 dividend stocks selected for value by an outperforming money manager\n\n\u2022 This dividend-stock strategy is for investors who want an attractive monthly income stream\n\n\u2022 Seeking attractive dividend stocks?
