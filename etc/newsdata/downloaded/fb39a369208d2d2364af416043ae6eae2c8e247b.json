Maybe that is why I get that extra special feeling, scoring here and the times I\u2019ve played here I have won, so it\u2019s been a good place for me, but the main focus was winning and we did that,\u201d Mount told Chelsea TV.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

You always get a bit of swelling when you\u2019ve had an injury, but I\u2019m fine and having four boys going (to England duty), we\u2019re looking forward to it and buzzing.\u201d\n\nLampard echoed Mount\u2019s sentiments about finishing strongly before his players left Cobham to link up with their national teams.\n\nTammy Abraham celebrated his England recall with the opener in the 17th minute, poking over Angus Gunn and getting enough on the ball for it to cross the line before Southampton defender Maya Yoshida could clear.\n\nIt was his ninth goal of the season and the former Aston Villa loanee, who is joint-top of the Premier League scoring charts with Sergio Aguero, continues to justify the faith of his manager despite competition in the form of Olivier Giroud and Michy Batshuayi.\n\n\u201cWhen people are in good form, you talk about things happening for them and for me that is down to how Tammy has handled himself all season from the early moments of pre-season and when people were questioning him in different ways,\u201d Lampard said.\n\n\u201cI trusted Tammy at the start of the season and I felt it was his time to come back to Chelsea.\n\n\u201cI know people will talk about the circumstances (transfer fan), but he also has Oli Giroud as a World Cup winner and Batshuayi \u2013 a top class Premier League striker in my opinion \u2013 is there.\n\n\u201cTammy has made the place his own in the short-term, but he has to keep going because competition is key. Over the course of the season we will need everyone. He deserves this great week and deserves this start to the season, but I\u2019ll keep on him because I want more.\u201d\n\nCallum Hudson-Odoi created Abraham\u2019s opener in his first league start since April after an Achilles injury. The 18-year-old has only played four games this term, but has provided an assist or scored in every fixture.\n\nLampard added: \u201cI thought Callum did well, it was a great assist for Tammy\u2019s goal and a great ball. His work rate was good.\n\n\u201cHe will get better because he has had a serious injury. Fitness has been a bit of an issue and looking after him, but now he is showing he is getting towards match fitness.\u201d\n\nSouthampton have now lost three of their last four games, with their only victory in that run being a 4-0 Carabao Cup win over Portsmouth. Danny Ings pulled one back for the hosts in the 30th minute, but N\u2019Golo Kante and Batshuayi added further goals for the visitors.\n\nSaints boss Ralph Hasenhuttl said: \u201cWhen you don\u2019t take points or get wins, you struggle a little bit and the belief starts to go down.\n\n\u201cIt is not enough to win in the cup against a League One team (Portsmouth), the Premier League is different. We are not quick enough in our mind or disciplined enough in situations and then against strong teams, you don\u2019t have any chance.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Mason Mount was delighted to score at Southampton\u00a0and help Chelsea go into the latest international break with momentum after they claimed another three points on Sunday.
