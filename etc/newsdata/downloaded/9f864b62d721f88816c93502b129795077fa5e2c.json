REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s right-wing Likud failed, for the second time in five months, to secure a clear election victory. The centrist Blue and White party led by ex-armed forces chief Benny Gantz has a slight lead with nearly all votes counted.\n\nGantz has so far rebuffed Netanyahu\u2019s calls to join a unity government.\n\nNear-final results show Blue and White will be the largest single party in the new parliament with 33 of the 120 seats, while Likud has won 31 seats, three less than it had before.\n\nPresident Reuven Rivlin on Sunday began consultations with the parties about choosing a leader to put together a coalition.\n\nIn a meeting with Likud party leaders, Rivlin said it was up to the \u201ctwo biggest parties, the first and second that are almost equal in size, to join forces ... so that you together manage and establish a system that brings a stable government.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is what the people want. None of us can ignore that,\u201d he said.\n\nThere were only narrow differences in the two main parties\u2019 campaigns on many important issues, and an end to the Netanyahu era would be unlikely to bring significant changes in policy on relations with the United States, the regional struggle against Iran, or the Palestinian conflict.\n\nNetanyahu and Gantz will now seek potential coalition allies, prominent among whom is the far-right former defence minister Avigdor Lieberman. He secured eight seats for his Yisrael Beitenu party, making him a potential kingmaker.\n\nLieberman on Sunday reiterated his call for a unity government and said he would not recommend either candidate in his meeting with Rivlin.\n\nGantz, however, got a boost from the Arab-dominated Joint List, which said it was ending it usual policy of not supporting any of the main candidates after elections.\n\n\u201cWe want to bring an end to the era of Netanyahu, so we recommend that Benny Gantz be the one to form the next government,\u201d party head Ayman Odeh told Rivlin.\n\nAn increased turnout by Israel\u2019s 21-percent Arab minority saw the Joint List win 13 seats, making it the third largest grouping.\n\nIts support does not mean it will sit in the governing coalition, but its backing gives Gantz\u2019s centre-left bloc 57 seats, compared to Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing bloc of 55.\n\nReligious parties representing Israel\u2019s Ultra-Orthodox communities, known as Haredim, remain a significant force, with Shas winning nine seats and United Torah Judaism eight seats.\n\nThe right-wing Yamina won seven seats, the leftist Labor-Gesher six, and the Democratic Union five. Full official results are due to be published on Wednesday.", "description": "Israel's president on Sunday began consulting with party leaders to discuss who should lead the country after no clear victor emerged from last week's election, suggesting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud join forces with its main rival.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190922&t=2&i=1432663990&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8L0L7", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
