The problem, Gruden said, was that he didn\u2019t think Haskins was ready to step in as soon as the antsy fans wanted.\n\n\"People are excited when you take a guy at 15, you want to see him play right away,\u201d Gruden told The Dan Le Batard Show. \u201cBut it was our professional opinion that he wasn't ready to step in and play in the first five games of the season, in my opinion.\u201d\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nFive games is how long Gruden was given this season \u2014 the Redskins went 0-5 to that point \u2014 before being fired by the Washington Redskins last week. Gruden gave Haskins some backhanded praise in explaining why he started Case Keenum to begin the season and then turned to Colt McCoy initially in what would be Gruden\u2019s final game as Redskins coach, a loss to the New England Patriots.\n\nDwayne Haskins didn't appear to be the handpicked choice of his former Redskins head coach. (Getty Images)\n\n\u201cIt will take some time for him. He only played 13 or 14 games as a college player. He's very raw, but he's very talented. And it will take some time with him,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cHe just wasn't ready when I was there. And maybe he'll get ready in the next coming weeks, but it was the direction we decided to go.\u201d\n\nThat in and of itself is hardly damning. But Gruden clearly made it sound as if Haskins was not his personal choice when he said \u201cwe chose to take him as an organization.\u201d\n\nGruden added that Keenum\u2019s short contract and the broken leg McCoy suffered last season necessitated a QB selection.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThe fact of the matter is we had to get a quarterback in the draft somewhere, sometime,\u201d he said.\n\nGruden also said that \u201cthere were some other quarterbacks that some people in the building liked later on in the draft, but we chose Dwayne and tried to make the most of it. He's still got a chance to be a great player without a doubt, it's just gonna take some time.\u201d\n\nSome time with a different coach, that is.\n\nIt\u2019s believed that Daniel Jones was the apple of Gruden\u2019s eye, but Jones ended up in the Big Apple \u2014 drafted by the New York Giants with the sixth overall pick. Many felt the Giants should have waited to take Jones at No. 17 in Round 1, but he likely wouldn\u2019t have made it that far if the chatter about Gruden liking Jones are correct.\n\nJones and the Giants beat the Redskins in Week 4, 24-3. The rookie QB completed 23-of-31 passes for 225 yards with a TD and two interceptions against Washington.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Jay Gruden all but admitted that he wasn't behind the Redskins drafting Dwayne Haskins.", "authors": ["Eric Edholm"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/NMHMAGiq2Ttrao2a5JELTw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD05MjkuMDY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/PNm3Yp6I4O3XMYjBKMEabQ--~B/aD0yODQ2O3c9MzkyMztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/803b8ef0-ef80-11e9-bdff-4fedaf06ab7e", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
