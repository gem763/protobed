Indeed, the administrators proved themselves deaf to virtually everything but the current political mandate which decrees that only one perspective on gender identity is to be accommodated.\n\nOver the last seven years, I taught French and did many other things at West Point High \u2014 coached sports, sponsored clubs, managed special funds, even drove a school bus. I thoroughly enjoyed all of that, and my joy was reflected not only in a warm rapport with my students and fellow faculty but in excellent professional evaluations.\n\nJust over a year ago, one of my favorite students \u2014 a smart, witty girl, thoroughly engaged in my classes \u2014 announced that she had started identifying as a boy. She told me her new name \u2014 a traditionally masculine name \u2014 and said she would also like to change her French name, the one that we use in class.\n\nMore than just allow her to choose a new, masculine French name, I offered all my students the opportunity to select new French names, so she would not be singled out.\n\nI also made it a point not to refer to her with feminine pronouns. In fact, I avoided pronouns altogether, which wasn\u2019t particularly difficult since you usually refer to your students by name in class.\n\nThe pronoun issue is important to me. I am, after all, a language teacher. Pronouns mean something\u2014they refer to a person\u2019s biological sex. I believe that sex is biological, not psychological, and that it cannot be changed, no matter how much physical and emotional effort a person invests to that end. It\u2019s simply a fact of life, as far as I\u2019m concerned. It\u2019s also a fundamental tenet of my religious beliefs \u2014 beliefs that teach that it\u2019s wrong to tell a lie.\n\nThose beliefs soon put me on a collision course with school administrators. Though I\u2019d been trying hard not to offend this student, it wasn\u2019t enough. When school officials understood that I wasn\u2019t proactively using male pronouns with this female student, they told me that I\u2019d have to immediately make a concerted effort to do so or risk losing my job.\n\nUsing the wrong pronouns would mean denying not only my faith, but objective reality. What\u2019s more, it would mean sacrificing my freedom of conscience. I\u2019d also be permitting the administrators to violate my legally protected freedom of speech by allowing them to compel me to express ideas I don\u2019t agree with.\n\nI tried as gracefully as I could to explain all of that \u2014 to the student, her family, school officials, and the division superintendent. They would not listen. My spotless record was irrelevant. My reputation for fairness among my students and peers counted for nothing. My willingness to go several extra miles for this student didn\u2019t mean anything if I wouldn\u2019t go one final inch.\n\nIn the end, they fired me, and now I\u2019ve filed suit against the school division in state court.\n\nI\u2019m not looking for an official endorsement of my point of view \u2014 only the freedom to exercise my profession while maintaining my convictions. This freedom is the right of all Americans \u2014 the freedom to honor our personal convictions and our religious beliefs \u2026 the freedom not to speak a message we don\u2019t believe.\n\nI don\u2019t mind not using a pronoun that might offend this student, but I\u2019m not willing to use one that offends my conscience. It seems a simple, fair request, but division administrators turned a deaf ear to it. I can only hope that a judge will not.\n\n\u2022 Peter Vlaming is a French teacher who has filed suit against the West Point School Board over his dismissal.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
