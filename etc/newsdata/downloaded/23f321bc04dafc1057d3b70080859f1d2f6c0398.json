They\u2019re focused on other factors, economic factors, all things relating to how they can administer the game, and yet the safety of players and resolution of this issue has gone without any attention. \u201cThe integrity of our game is going to damaged when the safety of players is not at the forefront, and Major League Baseball has dropped the ball on the wet bag subject.\u201d\n\nBoras called for MLB to seek safer bag options during wet conditions after Harper\u2019s 2017 injury.\n\nBryant rolled his ankle after his right foot slipped off the bag during Sunday\u2019s game.\n\nKris Bryant leaves the game after this awkward play at first pic.twitter.com/q3tAX0d3KR \u2014 Cubs Talk (@NBCSCubs) September 22, 2019\n\nMLB responds\n\nAn MLB spokesman told the Sun Times Monday that safer options aren\u2019t available.\n\n\u201cTo date no one has come up with a bag that has proven to be better safety-wise than the bag we use now,\u201d the spokesman said.\n\nKris Bryant's agent blamed MLB for not acting to make bags safer in wet conditions. (Reuters)\n\nStory continues\n\nBoras: \u2018They\u2019ve done nothing\u2019\n\nBoras argued that MLB was guilty of inaction on the issues.\n\n\u201cThe issue for me is they\u2019ve done nothing,\u201d Boras said. \u201cThey have completely skirted this issue. They had an MVP player having an MVP season dramatically get hurt and miss time. It affects playoff races and the entire safety of players, and the integrity of the game. When they are very diligent to get umpires and teams to play during rain, during precipitation, trying to get the games played. \u201cThere\u2019s been no discussion, no resolution, absolutely nothing done in this area except the player is to bear the burden of slippery and wet bags.\u201d\n\nThe Cubs have lost six straight games and fallen four games behind in the NL wild-card race. They\u2019ll be without one of their best players as they seek a long-shot chance to make up ground in the final week of the season.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Kris Bryant's agent blamed MLB for not acting to make bags safer in wet conditions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/PayoqV8iMrlXQfa7DdjeFA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/zQXVmow6ygm4A06FdxiV0A--~B/aD0yOTY4O3c9NDQ1MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/a32b4760-de60-11e9-bddf-a20bbd920f1f"}
