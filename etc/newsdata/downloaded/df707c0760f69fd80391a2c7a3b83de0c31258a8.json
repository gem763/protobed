The subpoena sought eight years of the president\u2019s personal and corporate tax returns as the office investigates the role that the Mr. Trump and his family business played in hush-money payments made in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election.\n\nBoth Mr. Trump and the company reimbursed Michael D. Cohen, the president\u2019s former lawyer and fixer, for money Mr. Cohen paid to buy the silence of Stormy Daniels, an adult film actress who said she had an affair with Mr. Trump. The president has denied the affair.\n\nFederal prosecutors said in a court filing in July that they had \u201ceffectively concluded\u201d their investigation into possible crimes committed by the president\u2019s company, the Trump Organization, or its executives. Neither the company nor any of its leaders were charged. However, the office of the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., is exploring whether the reimbursements violated any New York State laws.\n\nThe lawsuit filed on Thursday was the latest effort by the president and his legal team to stymie multiple attempts to obtain copies of his tax returns, which Mr. Trump initially said he would make public during the 2016 campaign but has since refused to disclose.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s lawyers have sued to block attempts by congressional Democrats and New York State lawmakers to access his tax returns and financial records. But their arguments in those cases had been made on narrower grounds.", "description": "The president\u2019s legal team is trying to block a subpoena seeking his tax returns, claiming that any criminal investigation of Mr. Trump is unconstitutional.", "authors": ["Michael Gold"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/19/nyregion/19nytrump/19nytrump-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
