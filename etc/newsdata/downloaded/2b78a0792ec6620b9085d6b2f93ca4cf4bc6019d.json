I've also learned from medical reports that encouraging elderly people to play mahjong is a way of preventing Alzheimer's disease.\"\n\nOn Monday morning, the bureau deleted the original announcement and posted a revised version hours later, saying registered mahjong parlors will not be affected by the regulations and that the campaign is aimed at cracking down on illegal gambling.\n\nAccording to Zhang Xiangyong, a lawyer from Jiangxi Hongzheng Law Firm, a ban on all mahjong and chess parlors would confuse law enforcement, as the distinction between gambling and entertainment remains unclear.\n\n\"The one-size-fits-all ban will contribute to the anti-gambling campaign, but government sectors are not granted the right to close legally registered parlors if they are not providing gambling services,\" he said. \"Also, such entertainment involving a small amount of money is legal.\"\n\nAccording to Jiangxi's administrative punishment standard, entertainment activities involving gambling of more than 200 yuan ($28) will face punishment.\n\nAlthough the circular has sparked an intense discussion among the public, the ban is widely supported by netizens as the campaign could help maintain social order and security.\n\n\"In my hometown of Nanchang, capital of Jiangxi, some people play mahjong from day to night and disturb others. The ban is an iron fist against unhealthy social trends,\" a netizen named Yomi commented on Weibo.", "description": "The public security department in Jiangxi province amended a recent announcement that banned all mahjong parlors after public criticism of the department's one-size-fits-all approach.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/23/5dafb34da310cf3e97a289d7.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
