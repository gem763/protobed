Considering that multiple USD majors and crosses displayed bearish reversal candles on Tuesday before extending losses yesterday suggests it\u2019s likely the USD correction is genuinely underway. So, in light of improved sentiment, USD/CNY (and therefor USD/CNH also) could also retrace against their parabolic moves seen since May. Or we could consider trading ASEAN trade partner such as USD/SGD, as there are loose correlations among such trading partners.\n\nUSD/SGD Daily Chart\n\n\n\nWe can see on the daily chart that USD/SGD had printed a bearish pin bar and hammer as part of a bearish wedge pattern. Moreover, the hammers have coincided with a bearish RSI divergence, in a similar vein to the prior top in May. Yesterday\u2019s sell-off was it\u2019s a most bearish session in two months (just like USD/CNY..) and has broken vital support at the time of writing.\n\nIt appears USD/SGD has topped and today\u2019s break of support opens up a run towards 1.3725\n\nThe prior counter-trend move saw it shed -315 pips. If a similar movement is to be repeated over the coming weeks, it could be headed towards 0.6325 support\n\nA break above 1.3942 assumes bullish continuation, although, for trade management purposes, yesterday\u2019s high around 1.3904 could be considered to \u2018step aside\u2019 if it breaks higher.\n\nKeep in mind that SGD is partially pegged to a basket of (undisclosed) currencies, and MAX (Monetary Authority Of Singapore) limit the volatility. But, with the correct theme and trend, remains a viable instrument to consider trading.\n\nRelated analysis:\n\nRand Bid as Monetary Policy Still Accommodative\n\nThe Closer You Look At ISM's PMI, The Uglier It Gets | EUR/USD, USD/CHF\n\n\"Disclaimer: The information and opinions in this report are for general information use only and are not intended as an offer or solicitation with respect to the purchase or sale of any currency or CFD contract.
