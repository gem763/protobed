Check out maps. This nonsense has never happened to another President. Four days of corrupt reporting, still without an apology. But there are many things that the Fake News Media has not apologized to me for, like the Witch Hunt, or SpyGate!\n\n\"The LameStream Media and their Democrat partner should start playing it straight. It would be so much better for our Country!\"\n\nThe NWS did not comment when asked for clarification about Mr Brown's comments.", "description": "Donald Trump reportedly ordered a Coast Guard rear admiral to give a statement publicly defending\u00a0the US president\u2019s\u00a0misleading\u00a0claims\u00a0about the chances of a hurricane striking Alabama.", "authors": ["Tom Embury-Dennis"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/05/08/Trump-map.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
