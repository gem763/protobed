They take up far less space (and cost fewer pennies!) than a countertop mixer, too.\n\nWhile hand mixers vary across the market, from the most basic to high-tech gadgets, it\u2019s clear that many are now so adept at the task in hand that they can rival most larger countertop counterparts.\n\nMany also offer great value for money, coming with a number of additional attachments such as whisks, dough hooks and beater attachments.\n\nWhen testing, we looked for a number of criteria, including models that were easy to grip and control (not so light the mixer and batter went everywhere, not so heavy to be cumbersome or arduous), more powerful than a standard hand-held whisk, easy to use and easy to clean.\n\nWe also looked at aesthetics, size, sound and storage. In the interest of fairness, we made the same shortbread batter with each hand mixer.\n\nBreville hand mixer with heatsoft technology VFM021: \u00a369.99, Lakeland\n\nWhile this was slightly larger than some of the models we tested, it ticked all of the boxes, making it a clear winner. With its matte grey, white and copper finish, it certainly looks the part, and its functionality also delivers. Its 270w power output is lower than some models on the market, but its easy-to-slide 7-speed control and added \u201cboost\u201d button ensure a powerful and efficient output, all while being ergonomically pleasing to hold.\n\nProving it's a jack of all trades, the Breville mixer comes with dough hooks, beaters and a whisk, plus a storage case to home them all . A special mention goes to its innovative \u201cheatsoft\u201d button, which heats ingredients such as butter, rather than having to wait for them to reach room temperature, to achieve the ideal bake.\n\nBuy now\n\nDualit chrome hand mixer: \u00a357.94, Amazon\n\nErgonomically pleasing and with a sleek matte white or chrome finish to boot, this is a stylish model that you\u2019ll want to keep on your countertop. With three attachments \u2013 a flat beater, balloon whisk and dough hook \u2013 it efficiently whisks, beats and mixes with little splashback. It also has a powerful 400w motor, plus four variable speed settings. Its retractable cord tidy and integral plug storage are an added bonus.\n\nBuy now\n\nKitchenAid 9-speed hand mixer 5KHM9212BAC in 'almond cream': \u00a3109.99, Lakeland\n\nKitchenAid is celebrated for its quality stand mixers, and its hand mixer doesn\u2019t disappoint. With its nine-speed setting and LED indicator, it feels like one of the most advanced models on the market. It also fits the hand well, so you have complete control over whatever you\u2019re mixing. Its 16-wire whisk is ideal for making sauces, puddings and whipped eggs and cream, and it also comes with a mixing rod, dough hooks and turbo beaters \u2013 the latter can tackle denser doughs such as cookie dough and cake batter with ease. We also liked the fact that it comes with a handy storage bag for the attachments.\n\nBuy now\n\nBosch MFQ3030GB hand mixer with 4 accessories: \u00a328, AO\n\nIt may not look like much but this is nifty, controlled and one of the quietest mixers we tested, which is surprising considering it boasts a 350w power output. On top of being lightweight, it has a great ergonomic grip, feels sturdy to hold, and you have total control when mixing ingredients. Its four speeds are easy to control with a flick of a thumb, and it has the added bonus of being BPA-free and made from non-toxic plastic.\n\nBuy now\n\nKenwood silver hand mixer HM536: \u00a329.99, Lakeland\n\nThis is an incredibly sturdy, compact and efficient model that\u2019s great value for money. It also benefits from a sleek design, thanks to its shiny chrome finish. It has a 280w motor, plus a five-speed setting and a pulse button for extra oomph, both of which are easily thumb operated. Attachments are dishwasher-friendly and most conveniently, the mixer is incredibly space efficient; the attachments tuck into the bottom of the device, plus the cord can also wrap around the bottom.\n\nBuy now\n\nWilko white hand mixer: \u00a36, Wilko\n\nFor an affordable, functional, does-what-it-says-on-the-tin type model, you can\u2019t go wrong with this Wilko hand mixer which, for its price, is a steal. It\u2019s a basic device, recommended for those who aren\u2019t necessarily seasoned bakers but who want a model which offers a bit more power than a hand whisk. It has a five-speed setting, plus a turbo button for extra oomph, and can fold, whip, cream, beat and even mash potatoes on its highest and turbo setting. Its only attachment is the whisk, so if you\u2019re after additional hooks this isn\u2019t for you. But considering the price, it\u2019s surprisingly lightweight, functional and simple.\n\nBuy now\n\nCuisinart 3in1 cordless hand blender: \u00a3128.06, Amazon\n\nSome models we tested had short leads, so it was a delight to test this cordless mixer, which sits conveniently on its compact charging stand on your countertop. It\u2019s a great all-rounder, and also comes with blending and mashing attachments, which you can pop in the dishwasher. We found it easy to use, thanks to its large on/off button and convenient safety lock. Its five-speed settings are easy to zip through, and it\u2019s so powerful you think it might take off, but it is still sturdy and mixing is controlled.\n\nThe base isn\u2019t the lightest on the market, but the mixer is easy to hold. The whisk attachment is ideal for achieving light batters, meringues and frothing milk, but you may want to look at a dedicated hand or stand mixer if you\u2019re looking to be more industrious in the kitchen.\n\nBuy now\n\nSwan Fearne hand mixer with 3 accessories: \u00a335, AO\n\nThere\u2019s more to this stylish hand mixer than meets the eye.
