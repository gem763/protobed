Iraq's semi-official high commission for human rights said about 500 people had been released from the 800 detained last week.\n\nIraq's military said on Tuesday one member of an Interior Ministry force was killed and four wounded when they came under fire from unknown assailants in Sadr City, where 15 people died the previous night in riots.\n\nIn a telephone call with Abdul Madhi, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo condemned the violence, urging the government to exercise maximum restraint and take steps to tackle protesters' grievances, the U.S. State Department said late on Tuesday.\n\nThe two officials spoke recently, it said in a statement, but did not mention the date.\n\nThe violence has been the worst in Iraq since it put down an insurgency by the Sunni Muslim Islamic State group nearly two years ago, and the biggest test for Abdul Mahdi, in office for a year.\n\nThe spread of the violence to Sadr City this week could heighten the security challenge. Unrest has historically been hard to put down in the district, home to about a third of Baghdad's 8 million people, with little electricity or water and few jobs.\n\nProtesters set fire to tires outside the municipal council building and courthouse in Mudhaffar Square, police said, adding that gunfire that targeted the security forces came from a crowd of protesters.\n\nDemonstrators say they have come under attack from members of the security forces using live ammunition. Reuters journalists have witnessed protesters being killed and wounded by snipers firing from rooftops into crowds.\n\nIraq's military on Tuesday called back into service those officers and soldiers dismissed on suspicions they abandoned cities and towns to an Islamic State onslaught in 2014.\n\nParliament, which on Tuesday held its first session since the crisis began, discussed the move and reform plans aimed at pacifying protesters.
