By driving behavioural change, such as moving away from the overconsumption of meat and putting pressure on governments and companies, civil movements have the power to drive the transformation needed in the next decade, say the report\u2019s authors.\n\nChristiana Figueres, a former top climate official at the UN, said: \u201cI see all evidence that social and economic tipping points are aligning. We can now say the next decade has the potential to see the fastest economic transition in history.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Christiana Figueres, a former top climate official at the UN.

All of them are judged possible to achieve by 2030.\n\n\u201cWhile the scale of transformation is unprecedented, the speed is not,\u201d said Johan Rockstr\u00f6m, the director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. \u201cThis is now a race against time, but businesses and even entire industries have made many significant transitions in less than 10 years.\u201d\n\nSocial movements will be a top priority because consumers can put pressure on the companies whose goods they buy, and public support makes it possible for political leaders to adopt bolder policies. Countries including the UK, France, Sweden and Norway have adopted a net-zero-carbon target for 2050.\n\nOwen Gaffney, the director of strategy at the Stockholm Resilience Centre, a co-author of the report, called on digital platforms such as Facebook, Amazon and Google to play a part.\n\n\u201cGiven that [these platforms] are now mediating behaviour and consumption, they might do more to support societal goals, for example around advertising and the promotion of high-carbon [activities]. Governments might look here too as a place for policy innovation.\u201d\n\nHe said governments also needed to do more to support behavioural change, from dietary choices to making public transport more available.\n\nHowever, the detailed policy measures required to meet 2050 net-zero-carbon targets have yet to be worked out by national governments. The report\u2019s authors believe they can demonstrate that taking action now across sectors such as energy generation, buildings, transport and food production and consumption will make it possible. Putting off taking action will result in higher costs and make more rapid change necessary in the future, they say.\n\nThe report did not examine the potential costs but Gaffney pointed to a study last year by the New Climate Economy that estimated the economic benefit of a lower-carbon future at $26tn (\u00a321tn) by 2030. The UK\u2019s Committee on Climate Change has estimated the cost of reaching net zero at 1-2% of GDP by 2050.\n\nThe need to move to net zero carbon by 2050 \u2013 effectively reducing most of the world\u2019s output of carbon dioxide emissions, and increasing the absorption of carbon by vegetation and other means \u2013 is based on the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nIn its report last year, the body of leading climate scientists found there would be dire effects if temperatures were to exceed 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, and found reducing carbon to near zero by mid-century was the best way to avoid this.\n\nThe organisations behind the Exponential Roadmap report included academic institutes, green campaigning groups and private sector companies.", "description": "Strong civil society movements are needed to ramp up pace of change, says study", "authors": ["Fiona Harvey"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03509e636ce13eb46347c26f3e58088ad3ce30bd/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2a3931bf15f74ce4ca5affc129c9c437", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
