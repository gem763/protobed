I have three or four at home,\u201d Kemp told the convicted killer when the judge handed her the Bible. \u201cYou just need a tiny mustard seed of faith. You start with this.\u201d\n\nAnd Kemp wasn\u2019t done there. She referenced John 3:16, embraced Guyger and offered an essential truth that can benefit all of our lives: \u201cYou haven\u2019t done so much that you can\u2019t be forgiven. You did something bad in one moment in time. What you do now matters.\u201d\n\nThis was a moment that further touched many hearts, but some critics like writer Jemele Hill took a starkly different view on the matter, calling Kemp\u2019s handling of the matter \u201cunacceptable.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow Botham Jean\u2019s brother chooses to grieve is his business. He\u2019s entitled to that,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cBut this judge choosing to hug this woman is unacceptable. Keep in mind this convicted murderer is the same one who laughed about Martin Luther King Jr\u2019s assassination, and killing ppl on sight.\u201d\n\nHill is entitled to her opinion, but she and others miss the mark on the true depths of the remarkable moment that unfolded before the eyes of a weary and divided nation \u2013 a country so culturally splintered and desperate for hope, forgiveness and compassion that the bold audacity displayed by both Jean and Kemp stopped nearly everyone in his or her tracks.\n\nTheir extraordinary display placed grace, humanity, love and forgiveness in front of hate, anger and condemnation. As for Kemp \u2013 an official charged with upholding the law \u2013 she could have simply left the courtroom; she could have chosen to ignore Guyger and move on with her day.\n\nBut, instead, the judge looked beyond herself and outside of the terrible and horrific mistakes that Guyger made, and she saw a human being \u2013 an individual in need of truth, restoration and the saving grace that can only be found in the gospel narrative.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nRegardless of what one believes about faith and God, the judge\u2019s kind act is not only commendable, but it\u2019s essential. It doesn\u2019t wipe away Guyger\u2019s crime; instead, it offers her a pathway to the only spiritual antidote available.\n\nPerhaps people don\u2019t realize the true call Christians have to \u201clove God\u201d and \u201clove others.\u201d These aren\u2019t mere words. They are a true and oft-times difficult calling for believers to live like Jesus. In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus implores his followers to love their enemies and \u201cpray for those who persecute you.\u201d In Romans, Paul tells Christians to feed and help their enemies.\n\nOn the cross, Jesus himself asks God to forgive those crucifying him, saying, \u201cthey do not know what they are doing.\u201d I could go on and on, as this is the central message of the Bible.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nKemp both saw Guyger as more than a convicted killer. She saw her as a human being in need of God\u2019s love, and that\u2019s a powerful reminder of the level of kindness and compassion that we are called to as Christians and human beings.\n\nNo matter what you believe about faith, it shouldn\u2019t be difficult to understand this judge\u2019s pure motive to help this woman seek true heart change.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY BILLY HALLOWELL", "description": "Americans are captivated by the amazing forgiveness story out of Texas \u2013 a young man\u2019s bold decision to not only forgive, but to openly embrace the ex-cop who killed his brother.", "authors": ["Billy Hallowell", "Billy Hallowell Is The The Director Of Communications", "Content At"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/03/694940094001_6091844070001_6091847643001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
