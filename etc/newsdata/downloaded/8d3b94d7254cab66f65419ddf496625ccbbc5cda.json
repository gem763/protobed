In fact, in South Africa you can already buy a Mercedes-Benz via your smartphone.\n\n\"The digitalisation is changing the way we live and do business. Customers around the world expect to be able to interact online with their brands anywhere and at any time,\" said Britta Seeger, Member of the Board of Management of Daimler AG, responsible for Mercedes-Benz Cars Sales & Marketing.\n\nThe automaker hosted its Best Customer Experience 4.0 earlier this year with large scale updates to its Mercedes Me app, the Mercedes me ID, a transformation of its dealerships into experience.\n\nCheck out a Twitter thread:\n\nMercedes Me app, the Mercedes me ID, is a physical retail as a point of experience and the seamless customer journey across all online and offline channels.\n\n\"Cars have already turned into smartphones on four wheels - always on and connected,\" Seeger says. \"With the Stuttgart-based company's MBUX (Mercedes-Benz User Experience), they feel they have the best platform for digital access.\n\n\"Picture a scenario whereby you see a car on Instagram, click on the link to set up a test drive, and order the car via your tablet once you get back home. It can be done.\n\n\"The overarching theme of the company's Best Customer Experience 4.0 is aiming to \"seamlessly merging digital channels with physical brand experience - from online to offline.\"\n\nImage: Mercedes-Benz\n\nOn the topic of a physical brand experience, Mercedes-Benz Sandton, located at 92 Rivonia Road, can also be referred to as a Brand Appearance Retail store.\n\nBy implementing the strategy showcased at Best Customer Experience, the close to 10 000sqm flagship dealership in the Sandton CBD is fully equipped to keep up with the growing digital demands of its customers.\n\nWhen I visited the showroom earlier this year, I was given a tour on how the architecture, people and processes, and lastly, media and formats.\n\nThe beautifully-designed building houses a showroom floor of over 4000sqm, a workshop area of over 5000sqm and no less than 50 workshop bays.\n\nThe Sandton building ushers in a new experience for new and existing customers by offering 'personal contact and digital tools in the sales and service space'.\n\nImage: Mercedes-Benz\n\nFrom hearing the vision of what I heard at Best Customer Experience 4.0 at The Hague and seeing that dealership, to what Mercedes-Benz SA has done in Sandton, is encouraging.\n\nIt shows how important South Africa is to the the vision and we are worthy of investment. Customers are able to use their Mercedes Me ID to log on and receive alerts for service appointments, test drives, and even signing documents.\n\nIt's not the future, it's the reality.\n\nImage: Mercedes-Benz", "description": "At the Best Customer Experience 4.0 held in The Hague, Mercedes-Benz said 25% of its cars will be bought online.
