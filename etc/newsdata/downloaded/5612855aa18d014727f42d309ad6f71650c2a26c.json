My mum died of lung cancer in January 2018.\n\n\"Last year I started to get out of breath, even walking up the stairs. My GP sent me for an X-ray and I was told I had an enlarged heart.\u201d\n\nThe 88 acres of land was purchased by Berkeley Group from the National Grid in 2013 as part of a \u00a31billion development.\n\nWith a prized connection to Crossrail, Southall Waterside will include 3,750 homes and up to 500,000 sq ft of commercial space.\n\nContractors set up a \u201csoil hospital\u201d to clean up before \u00adconstruction could begin. But locals say it hasn\u2019t protected them from the chemical effects.\n\nNow, after two years of complaining to Ealing Council, Berkeley Group, the Environment Agency and Public Health England, \u00adresidents are bringing legal action.\n\n(Image: Andy Stenning / Daily Mirror)\n\nNina Bedi, 53, lives with her 79-year-old father, who was recently diagnosed with cancer. Their garden, which overlooks the \u00addevelopment, is often covered with dust.\n\n\u201cMy sister who lives abroad, came to stay with us for nine months,\u201d she says. \u201cIn August she was \u00addiagnosed with bone marrow cancer.\n\n\"She\u2019s 51. My question is, did these \u00adchemicals cause the cancers?\u201d\n\nBaphinder Athwal, 57, says his garden is covered with dust too. \u201cI have had problems with my eyes, my blood pressure, and I\u2019ve had heart palpitations. My family don\u2019t like to visit because of the smell.\u201d\n\nLocal mum Angela Fonso, 51, founded CASH. \u201cDepending on the direction of the wind, some days are worse than others,\u201d she says. \u201cSome of the residents have now paid for \u00admonitoring devices and some of the data is alarming.\u201d\n\nAmrik Mahi, 56, is \u00adfrightened. \u201cOne day, I was walking down the road and my chest felt like it was exploding,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cYet when I leave the area, I\u2019m fine. My daughter was here with my granddaughter and we went to the park, but the smell was too strong. I told them to go home, I am not having my granddaughter poisoned.\u201d\n\nA council spokesman said: \u201cAfter concerns about odour from the Southall Waterside development we asked Public Health England (PHE) to carry out a report on possible health effects.\n\n\"Air quality monitoring is being reviewed by PHE and it has now published three reports which show that it is \u2018unlikely that there is a direct toxicological risk to the long-term health of the nearby population\u2019.\n\n\"We will continue to monitor the site and want to hear from anyone \u00adexperiencing problems.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for Berkeley said: \u201cCleaning contaminated land is a highly regulated activity and all our work was monitored and approved by the authorities, including the London Borough of Ealing and the Environment Agency.\n\n\"Berkeley\u2019s \u00adremediation work is now complete and cleaning this land has brought it into use for much-needed housing, including affordable homes for Ealing residents.\u201d\n\nJo Sidhu QC, who grew up in Southall, is supporting CASH.\n\n\u201cWhen developers appealed to the Mayor of London in 2010, I attended the hearing and warned him the pollution threat would be catastrophic for the \u00adcommunity\u2019s health,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cBut it felt like he had already made up his mind and he gave it the green light in a matter of minutes.\n\n\u201cThis land is dangerous, it is contaminated with poisonous \u00adchemicals. In the last year my own mum, who lives close to the site, \u00addeveloped severe breathing problems that put her in hospital three times.\n\n\u201cWe all know there are desperate housing shortages, but we can\u2019t just build on poisoned brownfield sites without a care for the health of \u00adordinary folk living nearby. It\u2019s happening up and down the country.\u201d\n\nThe legal action, he says, is a \u201cDavid and Goliath battle which is literally a matter of life and death for working-class residents\u201d.", "description": "Southall Gasworks and a chemical factory is being developed for housing after former mayor Johnson used special powers to push development through", "authors": ["Ros Wynne Jones", "Image", "Adam Gerrard Daily Mirror", "Andy Stenning", "Daily Mirror"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20554262.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Campaigner-Janet-Griffths-holds-a-portrait-of-her-mother-Katharina-Griffiths-who-passed-away-in-January-2018.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
