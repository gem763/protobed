Olson, who argued for robust executive power in senior Justice Department posts under Republican presidents, will face off against lawyers from President Trump\u2019s Justice Department in a case over Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to shut down a program that shields some 700,000 young undocumented immigrants from deportation and allows them to work.\n\nIn an interview in his office, Mr. Olson said he had generally taken a broad view of presidential authority, particularly in the realm of immigration.\n\n\u201cExecutive power is important, and we respect it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it has to be done the right way. It has to be done in an orderly fashion so that citizens can understand what is being done and people whose lives have depended on a governmental policy aren\u2019t swept away arbitrarily and capriciously. And that\u2019s what\u2019s happened here.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Us Politics Theodore-Olson-Dreamers-Supreme-Court.Html"], "top_image": ""}
