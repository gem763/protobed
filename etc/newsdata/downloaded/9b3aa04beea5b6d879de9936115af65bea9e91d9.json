No one bothers to fix things up because his team may be moving on soon.\n\nSeated at a table nursing a glass of water, Guaid\u00f3, 35, seems tired. His eyes are intense \u2014 and bloodshot. He's dealing with multiple challenges, including on-again, off-again negotiations in Norway between the opposition and representatives for authoritarian President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Guaid\u00f3 is just off the phone with U.S. Vice President Pence, one of his most vocal supporters.\n\nDuring a break on Wednesday afternoon, he sat down for an interview with NPR to discuss his efforts to bring about regime change in Venezuela, which is suffering from hyperinflation, power outages, and chronic shortages of food, medicine and fuel.\n\nInterview Highlights\n\nOn recent negotiations in Oslo, Norway\n\nGuaid\u00f3 said two rounds of talks this month had yielded no concrete results. The Norwegian government also brokered a 2016 peace deal between neighboring Colombia and Marxist guerrillas, which took four years. But Guaid\u00f3 said Venezuelans don't have the luxury of taking that long because people are dying by the day.\n\n\"Time is not on our side,\" he said. \"Time is running against all Venezuelans.\"\n\nStill, he said, the opposition remains open to more talks.\n\nOn what the opposition demands\n\nMaduro must leave office, and then Venezuela could hold free and fair elections.\n\nAsked whether a Maduro government could oversee new elections, Guaid\u00f3 referred to fraud-marred balloting last year, saying, \"We can't have another false election. Maduro as president would manipulate the elections. We need an impartial electoral council and international observation.\"\n\nGuaid\u00f3 didn't say whether Maduro should be allowed to participate in new elections, but he did say that given the president's low job-approval rating, Maduro would be \"the worst candidate that the ruling Socialist Party could field.\"\n\nOn why his April 30 call for a military rebellion fell on deaf ears\n\nGuaid\u00f3 said most military officers do not support Maduro but fear reprisals should they be caught conspiring with the opposition. He added that Cuban counterintelligence agents keep a close watch on the barracks.\n\n\"The main factor is fear, and we have to figure out a way to overcome the fear,\" Guaid\u00f3 said. He denied that the April 30 uprising was a mistake and declared, \"I would do it again.\"\n\nOn his close ties to U.S. officials and the possibility of a foreign invasion\n\nReferring to what he described as the presence of Colombian guerrillas and Cuban agents in Venezuela, Guaid\u00f3 said, \"We already have foreign military intervention.\"\n\nHe said that he would prefer a peaceful solution to the country's problems but that throngs of Venezuelans are already dying on a daily basis thanks to shortages of food and medicine.\n\n\"If you ask any Venezuelan, 'How do you think we should get out of this crisis?' They will say: 'By any means necessary.' Kids are dying, so the [military] option could be a way to stop the tragedy and the humanitarian catastrophe.\"\n\nOn where the opposition goes from here\n\nGuaid\u00f3 said, \"We can't be afraid to maintain hope\" for a better future. He claims the opposition remains united and is far stronger than it was six months ago, thanks to international recognition, growing foreign pressure on Maduro, and efforts by Norway and other countries to promote a negotiated solution.\n\nOn the risks he faces\n\nGuaid\u00f3 noted that his chief of staff was recently jailed and that his own brother has gone into exile to avoid arrest. But the Maduro government has been warned by U.S. officials not to touch Guaid\u00f3, and he says he is taking advantage by traveling the country and speaking to large crowds. By contrast, he said Maduro would get shouted down.\n\n\"I go everywhere, unlike Maduro, who can't show his face to the Venezuelan people,\" he said.", "description": "\"Time is not on our side,\" opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 told NPR in an interview in Caracas on Wednesday. \"Time is running against all Venezuelans.\"", "authors": ["John Otis"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/05/29/ap_19146701964952_wide-dfede0834462fe0580aa588ceee811eb7bf74771.jpg?s=1400"}
