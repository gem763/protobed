Amazon software tracks drivers\u2019 progress, and a dispatcher in an Amazon warehouse can call them if they fall behind schedule. Amazon requires that 999 out of 1,000 deliveries arrive on time, according to work orders obtained from contractors with drivers in eight states.\n\nAmazon has repeatedly said in court that it is not responsible for the actions of its contractors, citing agreements that require them, as one puts it, to \u201cdefend, indemnify and hold harmless Amazon.\u201d Just last week, an operations manager for Amazon testified in Chicago that it signs such agreements with all its \u201cdelivery service partners,\u201d who assume the liability and the responsibility for legal costs. The agreements cover \u201call loss or damage to personal property or bodily harm including death.\u201d\n\nAmazon vigilantly enforces the terms of those agreements. In New Jersey, when a contractor\u2019s insurer failed to pay Amazon\u2019s legal bills in a suit brought by a physician injured in a crash, Amazon sued to force the insurer to pick up the tab. In California, the company sued contractors, telling courts that any damages arising from crashes there should be billed to the delivery companies.\n\n\u201cI think anyone who thinks about Amazon has very conflicted feelings,\u201d said Tim Hauck, whose sister, Stacey Hayes Curry, was killed last year by a driver delivering Amazon packages in a San Diego office park. \u201cIt\u2019s sure nice to get something in two days for free. You\u2019re always impressed with that side of it. But this idea that they\u2019ve walled themselves off from responsibility is disturbing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got this wonderful convenience with this technology,\u201d he added, \u201cbut there\u2019s a human cost to it.\u201d\n\nAmazon, the world\u2019s largest retailer, is famously secretive about details of its operations, including the scale of its delivery network. In many of the accidents involving its contractors, drivers were using cars, trucks and cargo vans that bore no hint of Amazon\u2019s corporate logo. The truck involved in Gabrielle Kennedy\u2019s death, for example, was marked only \u201cPenske Truck Rental.\u201d\n\nAmazon declined to answer questions about the demands it places on drivers, the anonymity of delivery vehicles or any requirement that these contractors indemnify Amazon.", "description": "Amazon directs the destinations, deadlines and routes for its network of contract delivery drivers.
