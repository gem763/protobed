We can\u2019t allow this, it can\u2019t happen. Girls cannot play football\u2019. So they took away the players from our coaches and assigned a male coach instead,\u201d says Sarah El Jizi, head coach in the Beirut area for Right to Play\u2019s sports and humanitarian assistance project.\n\n\u201cThey were worried because the girls were wearing shorts \u2013 by shorts, I mean long shorts \u2013 and shirts with half sleeves. They were not comfortable with the girls wearing these uniforms and playing in front of everyone.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An education centre in Nahr el-Bared refugee camp.

Or rather, build behind a wall. \u201cThere was a space at the back of an education centre,\u201d explains El Jizi. \u201cSo Right to Play renovated it and built a football pitch for the female players to play without being seen by the community.\n\n\u201cThe female coaches kept on convincing the players and their parents to continue the training, and now they have more girls participating than before and can play freely.\u201d\n\nShielded from public view, the girls are cheered on from the sidelines by male family members and friends. There are also mixed games, used by the coaches to foster female leadership and a wider spirit of inclusion. In one such activity, called girls score, female team captains are nominated and tasked with choosing team-mates \u2013 and monopolising the scoresheet.\n\n\u201cOnly girls can score the goals,\u201d explains Nimtaz-Tanya Noordin, Right to Play\u2019s senior UK communications manager. \u201cThis puts girls at the heart of the team and gives them confidence. Importantly, it ensures boys pass the ball to the girls and see them as equal.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hidden from public view, girls and boys watch a game of football in Nahr el-Bared refugee camp. Photograph: Courtesy of Right to Play\n\n\u201cBy involving boys\u2026 we are sowing the seeds of long-term social change to overcome the deep-rooted discrimination and attitudes that persistently disadvantage girls and women.\u201d\n\nThe battle is far from won. Girls may now able to play football in one sequestered corner of Nahr el-Bared, but women remain prohibited, their participation limited to occasional tournaments staged outside the camp by Right to Play.\n\nSlowly, though, attitudes are changing \u2013 not least among the girls themselves. \u201cThey are becoming more confident,\u201d says El Jizi. \u201cIt\u2019s changing their lives and how they interact with their neighbours, families, brothers, sisters.\u201d\n\nIt is also transforming their prospects. One girl, Latifa Kilani \u2013 \u201cshe is better than all the boys,\u201d says El Jizi \u2013 now plays for the national under-16 women\u2019s team. Another, Sanaa el Cheikh, has opened up her own football academy in Quobbeh, Tripoli, enabling her to support her brother and sister following the death of her parents. She was recently selected as a coach for Ansar Al Mawada Sports Club, a third division men\u2019s team in Tripoli \u2013 a rare precedent.\n\nSuch achievements would once have been unthinkable for anyone from Nahr el-Bared. Twelve years ago, the camp was razed to the ground in a conflict between Lebanese security forces and Islamist militants. In the aftermath, the UN Relief and Works Agency declared it the scene of a \u201cchronic humanitarian crisis\u201d. The reconstruction effort that followed was the largest project ever mounted by the organisation.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Without Right to Play I wouldn\u2019t be where I am today\u2019: Zeinab Halabi.

Of the 27,000 residents forced to leave in 2007, the majority have returned to the camp. However, an estimated 7,137 people \u2013 1,600 families \u2013 are still waiting. \u201cThe majority of these are renting private accommodation or living in temporary shelters, many of which are in extremely poor condition,\u201d said a UN spokesman.\n\nEl Jizi paints a bleak picture of life in the camp: \u201cThe refugees experience poverty and their electricity keeps cutting off; they don\u2019t have safe spaces and there is no access to public facilities.\u201d\n\nFootball pales into insignificance in such circumstances. But if day-to-day survival remains the imperative for many in Nahr el-Bared, Zeinab Halabi, from Lebanon, who started as a volunteer with Right to Play three years ago, is living proof of the shaping influence that sport can have on the fortunes of girls and women.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018I always support the girls\u2019: Zeinab Halabi. Photograph: Courtesy of Right to Play\n\n\u201cWithout Right to Play I wouldn\u2019t be where I am today,\u201d says Halabi, 28, a former kickboxer who once claimed the title of strongest Arab woman in a weightlifting competition. \u201cI take self-confidence from sport.\u201d\n\nIn a country where female football coaches are few and far between at any level, Halabi has managed Montada North Lebanon, a Lebanese Women\u2019s Football League side, and is currently match commissioner for the men\u2019s first division, a role no woman has previously held. But it is her decision to divorce her husband over his refusal to let her be involved in football that has given her a measure of fame.\n\nA kickboxer who became her coach and then her spouse, Halabi\u2019s former husband asked her to turn her back on the game soon after they were married. \u201cHe asked me to stop, even though I had a girl\u2019s team and not a men\u2019s,\u201d she recounts.\n\n\u2018I watched my family die\u2019: Shatila refugees' suffering laid bare Read more\n\n\u201cHe said: \u2018You have to stay in and wait for me to come home and cook and clean.\u2019 So I told him: \u2018I\u2019m not a slave, I have my own world and you told me you respect that. I have my own life, and it\u2019s about football. It\u2019s your world and my world \u2013 we cannot stay together.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe subsequent parting was acrimonious, with Halabi threatening to call the police on her husband when he turned up to a training session and became abusive. But she takes pride in her actions and has become a role model for young girls in Nahr el-Bared.\n\n\u201cI always support the girls and tell them that they can do what I\u2019m doing today,\u201d says Halabi. \u201cI tell them: \u2018If you want to be like me \u2013 and you can be better than me \u2013 you have to do sport and, in time, you can find what you want.\u201d", "description": "After religious leaders tried to stop girls taking part in the sport, local coaches came up with an unlikely solution", "authors": ["Les Roopanarine"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4387bf40c1e8dede5726b8263b3bc6dd83cc4e46/1109_424_3973_2384/master/3973.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e6a4aa2fd4eb41319b7770d1619ab6f4", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
