Draper then went on to say: 'I'm having one of these and cruising the Adriatic, because I'm worth it.'\n\nBoth schools are headed by ex-government education advisor Mr Draper who is CEO of the Lakes Academies Trust.\n\nWater Hall Primary School received an 'outstanding' rating in March 2013 but was graded 'inadequate' earlier this year. It was also placed under special measures.\n\nThe second school under the trust, Knowles Primary School, was also rated inadequate by Ofsted, having been told that it required improvement in 2016.\n\nThe angry Instagram post was seen by horrified parents and when a screenshot was widely shared, the account was changed from public to private.\n\nOne parent said on Facebook: 'I believe it's down to the leadership of the one in charge, he probably hasn't got the greatest team around him but then again one must wonder how on earth he decides to manage his team from the Adriatic sea!'\n\nAnother parent asked: 'His school failed Ofsted so what impression does this give us parents?'\n\nHe made the comments after two of the Milton Keynes schools he heads were graded as 'inadequate' by the regulatory board.

Who likes Ofsted anyway?' said one.\n\nWater Hall Primary School (pictured) received an 'outstanding' rating in March 2013 but was graded 'inadequate' earlier this year.
