He\u2019s also environmentally aware and understands he should treat the Earth with respect.\n\nHis mother, 47-year-old Shanti Hodges, credits this to how he\u2019s been hiking with her since birth. Shanti is the accidental founder of a movement that is now well over 200,000 families strong. Hike it Baby began right after Mason was born, when Utah-based Shanti found herself feeling cooped up indoors and out of touch with the hiking community she loved.\n\n\u201cWhen I had Mason, I knew it would feel isolating,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t expect to feel like I had no friends or that I couldn\u2019t get out into nature.\u201d\n\nHodges knew about various active mom groups, such as Stroller Strides, but that wasn\u2019t what she was after. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to work out, I just wanted to get outside,\u201d she says. \u201cI knew it would be good for me and for the baby.\u201d\n\nWhile the outside part was key, so too was the socialization she could find with a group of like-minded newer parents.\n\n\u201cYou can try meetup groups, but they end,\u201d Hodges says. \u201cI wanted to be part of an ongoing community. When we\u2019re out there, we help each other with the kids, our energy is lighter and we feel better after.\u201d\n\nThe new mom got things rolling by inviting a few others to meet up with their babies and young children at a local trail. In short order, their numbers swelled. Hodges named the group Hike it Baby, started a newsletter and found her tribe. Six years in, she says, Hike it Baby has been good for both her and Mason.\n\n\u201cRight away, Mason was easier to manage,\u201d she says. \u201cHe was happier, we got along better, and I was able to spend time with other adults with an appreciation for the outdoors.\u201d\n\nResearch backs up what Hodges intuited \u2014 that nature is good for kids on many levels. A recent systematic review in Health Place found that immersive nature experiences for children benefits self-esteem, self-efficacy, resilience and academic-cognitive performance.\n\nLawrence Rosen, a pediatrician and founder of the Whole Child Center, agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s never too early to get kids outside,\u201d he says. \u201cWe always want evidence of safety when prescribing things for babies and young children, but there are also things we just know, and this is one of them.\u201d\n\nRosen points to the many benefits children and families can garner from time in nature. \u201cWe know from thousands of years of experience in a variety of cultures that families who are more connected to nature tend to be happier and healthier,\u201d he says. \u201cYou are away from electronics and pollution, and you forge community with others.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also the sleep factor with babies and young children, who are notorious for depriving parents of the same, he says.\n\n\u201cBeing outside in the fresh air, running around and exploring promotes good sleep,\u201d Rosen says.\n\nHodges has found this to be true with Mason.\n\nCollin O\u2019Mara, president and chief executive of the Reston, Va.-based National Wildlife Federation, says the same applies to his children, ages 2 and 7. \u201cTheir sleep definitely improves after outdoors time,\u201d he says.\n\nO\u2019Mara and his wife have made outdoors time a priority for their family from the start, he says.\n\n\u201cWe want to encourage a lifelong love of nature because it has so many auxiliary benefits,\u201d he says. \u201cIt helps children develop critical thinking and gives them hands-on learning, all of which [can] lead to improved ability with math and science when they enter school.\u201d\n\nIn an era where so much of children\u2019s lives are scheduled and scripted, O\u2019Mara values the creativity his children develop in nature.\n\n\u201cTake a kid to a playground and they\u2019ll get bored after a little while,\u201d he says. \u201cBut take them to the woods and they will play for hours and never tire of it. A rock, for instance, can take on multiple roles over several hours.\u201d\n\nRosen says that by taking children into the great outdoors, parents are modeling healthy habits. \u201cFrom birth, kids pick up on their parents\u2019 physical activity levels and mind-set,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you get your kids out early, they will follow suit.\u201d\n\nFor many new parents, the idea of getting their babies and young children outside might hold appeal, but can feel intimidating. On a practical level, Rosen says parents with access to parks and forests should consider sun protection, checking for ticks and proper clothing for the temperature.\n\nHodges has learned from experience how to make hiking with babies an easier experience. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to think you need to bring everything when you have a baby,\u201d she says. \u201cBut think about the distance and adjust your gear accordingly.\u201d\n\nA short hike, for instance, might require that you bring little more than a diaper and a few wipes in a Ziploc bag.\n\n\u201cOne important tip is to always carry a plastic bag,\u201d Hodges says. This will help keep dirty diapers and the like separated from everything else.\n\nFinding a community like Hike it Baby is also a good way to go. \u201cThen if you do forget something, you have somebody there to back you up,\u201d Hodges says. \u201cAlso, if you have older kids, they can help keep the younger kids hiking on and like the role of \u2018leader\u2019 to toddlers.\u201d\n\nThink small when you first begin venturing out.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t try to get epic when you first start hiking with a baby,\u201d Hodges says. \u201cGo for things around your neighborhood. While you might have been an avid hiker pre-baby, things are different, especially in the beginning with a new baby or toddler.\u201d\n\nBut take heart, keep at it and before you know it, your child will be leading the way when it comes to the outdoors.\n\nSays O\u2019Mara: \u201cGiven a choice between going fishing and watching the latest Disney movie, our kids will choose fishing every time. They\u2019re waiting to get outdoors as soon as they\u2019re up.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nPlaying outside seems to help kids\u2019 vision\n\n10 ways to help kids fall in love with being outside\n\nPeople who spend more time outdoors lead more fulfilling lives, research shows", "description": "Outdoors group finds that nature is good for their kids on many levels.", "authors": ["Amanda Loudin", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/UHx-w51QGhzoHWySc3ws7g_hMpE=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EOL2ZGF7OMI6TKFQP3MKBVO4LU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
