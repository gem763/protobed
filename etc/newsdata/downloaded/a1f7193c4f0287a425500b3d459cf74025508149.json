Welcome to Last Minute Week. Gifts for all kinds of moms. Photo: Courtesy of the retailers\n\nHow do you even make a mom-themed gift guide? Some moms are in their 20s. Some moms are in their 90s. Some moms like to cook. Some moms like to drink. Some moms like linen. Some moms like lavender. Coming up with the best gifts for a mom is an impossible task! (Gifts for dads can be tricky, too.) So, what we\u2019ve attempted to do below is find gifts for several dozen specific mom archetypes that we hope will at least spark some ideas.\n\nFor the coffee-drinking mom who\u2019s retro\n\nIlsa Neapolitan 6-Cup Aluminum Coffee Maker Writer Matthew Kassel told us about this French stovetop-coffee-making invention: \u201cHere\u2019s what\u2019s special about it: It makes the perfect amount of coffee for one person \u2014 I know it says six, but it makes about four cups\u2019 worth max \u2014 and produces a clean but concentrated cup. The texture doesn\u2019t get as muddy as French-press coffee, and it\u2019s a little less intense than Moka coffee.\u201d $35 at Amazon Buy $35 at Amazon Buy\n\nFor the coffee-drinking mom who\u2019s minimal\n\nFor the mom who\u2019s over Drunk Elephant\n\nFor the mom who misses Michelle\n\nBecoming by Michelle Obama $16 (was $33, now 52% off) If she hasn\u2019t read it already, it\u2019s still not too late to join the 10 million \u2014 and counting \u2014 who own a copy. $16 at Amazon Buy $16 at Amazon Buy\n\nFor the mom who\u2019s always asking for a foot rub\n\nFor the mom who likes linen\n\nLinoto Luxurious Pure Linen Bed Sheet Set And speaking of linen: Some of the best flaxen sheet sets can be bought on Amazon. We just updated our guide to shopping for linen sheets and were delighted to find that this small company, with a workshop in upstate New York, makes heirloom-level linen bedding. From $329 at Amazon Buy From $329 at Amazon Buy\n\nFor the candle-loving mom who\u2019s kind of fancy\n\nFor the mom with a Drybar habit\n\nDyson Supersonic Hair Dryer In her review of the Dyson hair dryer, Linda Wells writes: \u201cSir James Dyson turns his unease into inventions that improve the sometimes dirty, always inefficient annoyances of daily life. His current triumph is the blow-dryer, which he and his 103 engineers transformed into a sexy, supersonic object of desire.\u201d $400 at Amazon Buy $400 at Amazon Buy\n\nFor the mom who needs new pajamas\n\nEberjey Gisele Two-Piece Pajama Sleepwear Set These pajamas are a perennial Strat favorite. Among those who recommends them is Cup of Jo\u2019s Joanna Goddard: \u201cA few years ago, my husband and I went on a trip with another couple. The first morning, I stumbled into the kitchen, where my friend was making eggs in a classic pajama set. She looked so beautiful and elegant that I was immediately converted. Eberjey makes the softest, most buttery version.\u201d From $89 at Amazon Buy From $89 at Amazon Buy\n\nFor the mom who\u2019s part of the food co-op\n\nFor the mom who\u2019s always redecorating\n\nMay I Come In?: Discovering the World in Other People\u2019s Houses $35 (was $65, now 46% off) Our very own Wendy Goodman has a book out, documenting all the eccentric, lavish, singular interiors she\u2019s had access to over the past 20 years. Some of the homeowners are famous \u2014 Amy Sedaris, Todd Oldham \u2014 but many aren\u2019t. Regardless, inspiration and ideas abound. $35 at Amazon Buy $35 at Amazon Buy\n\nFor the mom who draws\n\nSara Berman\u2019s Closet, by Maira and Alex Kalman $18 (was $28, now 36% off) Filled with illustrations, this book is \u201ca charming, quirky, and sentimental tribute to the life of Sara Berman, beautifully illustrated by her daughter, artist Maira Kalman. It is an immigrant\u2019s tale of reinvention and finding contentment in the simple things later in life,\u201d say Michael Lyons Wier and Deanne Shashoua, the directors of the Lyons Wier Gallery. $18 at Amazon Buy $18 at Amazon Buy\n\nFor the mom always asking for more pictures of the grandkids\n\nNixplay Wi-Fi Cloud Digital Photo Frame 18.5\u201d This excellently reviewed digital picture frame brand makes frames that are simple to set up and have a very easy-to-use app, so you can remotely drop new photos in there, and she can be surprised with, say, a just-thinking-of-you selfie, or a real-time photo from the kid\u2019s piano recital. $290 at Amazon Buy $290 at Amazon Buy\n\nFor the mom who wants to hang pictures of the kids on the fridge\n\nFor the mom going through old family photos\n\nEpson Perfection V600 Color Scanner This scanner can handle old photos as well as slides, negatives, and medium-format panoramic film, which means your mom will be able to preserve all of the family\u2019s memories. $230 at Amazon Buy $230 at Amazon Buy\n\nFor the gorpcore mom\n\nFor the mom working on her core\n\nVivora Luno Sitting Ball Chair $50 (was $60, now 17% off) Chiropractors still endorse sitting on balance balls at work, but the nice thing about this one is the fabric (or leather) zip covers. You can get the benefits without making your office look like a gym. From $50 at Amazon Buy From $50 at Amazon Buy\n\nFor the mom working on her gut health\n\nThe Nue Co. Prebiotic + Probiotic The latest in probiotics is actually prebiotics, which are essentially fibers (found naturally in foods such as bananas, leeks, and garlic) that help probiotics thrive. This stylish line carries several varieties, some for skin health, some for digestion, but this simple combination is good place to start. $85 at Amazon Buy $85 at Amazon Buy\n\nFor the mom who wants her home to smell like a spa\n\nAsakuki Essential Oil Diffuser $26 (was $36, now 28% off) This squat little aromatherapy diffuser looks slicker than some of its bamboo counterparts, more closely resembling a mid-century Braun device. $26 at Amazon Buy $26 at Amazon Buy\n\nFor the mom who wants her home to smell like New Mexico\n\nLuna Sundara Palo Santo Smudging Sticks High Resin Palo Santo from Ecuador Palo Santo, or holy wood, usually comes in wooden stick form. It smells earthy and ethereal all at once. $9 at Amazon Buy $9 at Amazon Buy\n\nFor the mom who\u2019s a little glamorous\n\nFor the mom who likes to cook\n\nFor the mom who really likes to cook\n\nChefSteps Joule Sous Vide Grub Street editor Alan Sytsma was initially skeptical of the high-tech ChefSteps Joule, but it quickly won him over and turned him into \u201csomething of sous-vide maniac.\u201d In his review he praises the in-app temperature-control precision and general ease of use. $179 at Amazon Buy $179 at Amazon Buy\n\nFor the mom who likes to cook (and hates clutter)\n\nMercer Culinary Genesis 6-Piece Forged Knife Block Set Among chefs, most knife sets are considered gratuitous. Our colleague Maxine offers another way of looking at them: \u201cInstead, think of kitchen knife sets as starter packs, not definitive tool kits.\u201d This Mercer set is good for intermediate cooks \u201cangling at getting the most blades for their money.\u201d One major perk: The knives are suspended neatly in this stand, so water and grime won\u2019t collect in a wooden block. $140 at Amazon Buy $140 at Amazon Buy\n\nFor the mom who wants to make nut milk\n\nVitamix A2500 Ascent Series Smart Blender $500 (was $600, now 17% off) Time and time again, we\u2019ve pointed out that the much-hyped Vitamix really is as powerful and agile as the price tag suggests. \u201cThe Vitamix Ascent 2500 has ten speeds,\u201d wrote Maxine, \u201cand you can easily switch between them while you\u2019re using the blender with the turn of a dial. That gives you way more versatility when you\u2019re cooking.\u201d $500 at Amazon Buy $500 at Amazon Buy\n\nFor the mom who likes her lattes\n\nKeepCup Reusable Coffee Cup (12 ounces) Designed by baristas for baristas, the size and shape of the KeepCup travel mug makes it easy to measure out lattes versus cortados. And, crucially, for baristas to keep making latte-heart art for your mom. $30 at Amazon Buy $30 at Amazon Buy\n\nFor the mom who likes her Pinot Grigio\n\nFor the mom who likes her Cab Franc (and who\u2019s clumsy)\n\nFor the mom who likes her Pinot Noir (but just one glass)\n\nCoravin 100015 Model One System $178 (was $179, now 1% off) This wine-sealing contraption is $200, but think of all the good wine mom will save by keeping opened bottles free from oxidation. $178 at Amazon Buy $178 at Amazon Buy\n\nFor the mom who just became a mom\n\nFor the mom who just became a mom for the second time\n\nMarpac Dohm Classic White Noise Sound Machine, Tan This white-noise machine might not be the most attractive nightstand accessory, but, as editor Alexis Swerdloff wrote in her review of the Dohm white-noise sound machine, \u201c[I]t\u2019s what puts me (and now my husband) to sleep every night, like a warm cup of milk,\u201d which is just the kind of sleep a new mom needs. $45 at Amazon Buy $45 at Marpac Buy\n\nFor the mom hooked on K-beauty\n\nSeoul Ceuticals Vitamin C Hyaluronic Acid Serum $17 (was $40, now 58% off) This enthusiastically reviewed serum is a remarkable three-fer: it has vitamin C and ferulic acid, which help protect skin and even skin tone, as well as hyaluronic acid, which locks in moisture. $17 at Amazon Buy $17 at Amazon Buy\n\nFor the mom who believes Goop\n\nDeciniee Jade Roller for Face 2 in 1 Gua Sha Tools $17 (was $30, now 43% off) The rose quartz face roller is the quintessential Goop recommendation (second only to the jade vagina eggs). Besides the loving energetic vibes you (allegedly) get from rose quartz, these tools assist in lymphatic draining and boosting circulation in the skin. Good for tired moms. $17 at Amazon Buy $17 at Amazon Buy\n\nFor the mom who wears no-makeup makeup\n\nFor the mom who\u2019s always behind on salon touch-ups\n\nColor Wow Root Cover Up \u201cMy mom\u2019s experience with the Color Wow was major,\u201d said Rio, after she used it to brush up her mother\u2019s grays. \u201cWithin seconds, her bright-gray roots were completely and totally concealed, with no evidence that they ever existed. And, even better, she said it didn\u2019t feel like there was anything in her hair, the way pigmented sprays can get dry and crusty. $35 at Amazon Buy $35 at Amazon Buy\n\nFor the mom who needs a bath towel upgrade\n\nKontex Organic Cotton Towels (Set of 3) These organic towels hail from Imabari, the cotton capital of Japan, and claim to be \u201cas soft and silky as cashmere yet durable enough for everyday use.\u201d (For more bathroom-centric gift ideas, click here.) $113 at Amazon Buy $113 at Amazon Buy\n\nFor the mom whose ankles swell\n\nVIM & VIGR Stylish Compression Socks \u201cThe beauty of Vim & Vigr is that it takes nice-feeling black or tan compression socks and injects them with actual style,\u201d said Allison Freer, who actually gifted to these her post-op mom. (Her mom cried when she opened them.) From $24 at Vim & Vigr Buy From $33 at Amazon Buy\n\nFor the mom who is trying to stay hydrated\n\nbkr Glass Bottle With Silicone Sleeve, 16 oz. In her investigation into the next status water bottle, writer Karen Iorio Adelson writes: \u201cIf there\u2019s one bottle most likely to steal S\u2019well\u2019s throne as a fitness-class favorite, it\u2019s the silicone-encased glass Bkr bottle.\u201d And it\u2019s endorsed by famous moms such as Reese Witherspoon, Jennifer Garner, and Minka Kelly. $38 at Amazon Buy\n\nFor the bath-loving mom\n\nDr. Singha\u2019s Mustard Bath This mustard-seed powder is one of the best bath soaks, full stop. It emulsifies in hot water and relaxes muscles instantly. As a bonus, it leaves skin silky and soft. $29 at Amazon Buy $29 at Amazon Buy\n\nFor the mom who just heard of Elena Ferrante\n\nMy Brilliant Friend $10 (was $17, now 41% off) It is possible \u2014 unlikely, but possible \u2014 that Ferrante fever could have bypassed your mom. A solid choice if she\u2019s binged the HBO adaptation and now wants to read the book before season two premieres. From $10 at Amazon Buy From $10 at Amazon Buy\n\nFor the mom ready to take composting to the next level\n\nFood Cycler Platinum Indoor Food Recycler Also featured in our recent roundup of actually stylish compost bins, this one only takes three hours to go from scraps to beautiful, garden-ready compost \u2014 no worms required. $299 at Amazon Buy $299 at Amazon Buy\n\nThe Strategist is designed to surface the most useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.
