PR of IAEO (Iran's Atomic Energy Organization)/WANA (West Asia News Agency) via REUTERS\n\nThe deal curbed Iran\u2019s disputed nuclear programme in exchange for relief from sanctions, but has unravelled since the United States withdrew last year and acted to strangle Iran\u2019s oil exports to push it into a broader security agreement.\n\nFrance, Germany and Britain have tried to launch a barter trade mechanism with Iran protecting it from U.S. sanctions but have struggled to get it off the ground, and Tehran on Wednesday set a 60-day deadline for effective European action.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately the European parties have failed to fulfil their commitments... The deal is not a one-way street and Iran will act accordingly as we have done so far by gradually downgrading our commitments,\u201d said Ali Akbar Salehi, director of Iran\u2019s nuclear energy agency.\n\n\u201cIran will continue to reduce its nuclear commitments as long as the other parties fail to carry out their commitments,\u201d Salehi said, speaking after meeting the acting head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog (IAEA), Cornel Feruta, in Tehran on Sunday.\n\nFeruta, whose inspectors monitor Tehran\u2019s nuclear programme, also met Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif who told him that Iran\u2019s breaches were permitted under Paragraph 36 of the nuclear accord, the semi-official Fars news agency reported.\n\nREVERSIBLE STEPS\n\nIranian officials say the paragraph allows one party to the deal to cut its commitments if others do not live up to theirs.\n\nIran says its retreat from terms of the deal is reversible if European signatories manage to restore its access to foreign trade promised under the nuclear deal but blocked by the reimposition of U.S. sanctions.\n\nFeruta reiterated that IAEA inspectors would carry out its verification activities in a \u201cprofessional and impartial\u201d manner, Fars added. The IAEA\u2019s 35-nation Board of Governors will discuss Iran at a quarterly meeting that begins on Monday.\n\nSince May, Iran has begun to breach caps on its nuclear capacity set by the deal in retaliation for U.S. pressure on Iran to negotiate restrictions on its ballistic missile programme and support for proxy forces around the Middle East.\n\n\u201cThe actions they have taken are negative but not definitive. They can come back (to full compliance) and the path of dialogue is still open,\u201d French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves le Drian said on Sunday.\n\nRelated Coverage Iran says cuts in commitment allowed under nuclear deal - Fars\n\nUpping the ante in its stand-off with Washington, Tehran said on Saturday it was now capable of raising uranium enrichment past the 20% level of fissile purity and had launched advanced centrifuge machines in further breaches of the deal.\n\nIAEA inspectors reported in July that Iran had cranked up enrichment to 4.5% purity, above the 3.7% cap suitable for civilian energy generation set by the 2015 accord.\n\nUnder the deal, Iran is allowed limited research and development on advanced centrifuges, which accelerate the production of fissile material that could, if enriched to the 90% threshold, be used to develop a nuclear bomb.", "description": "Iran's nuclear chief said on Sunday the European parties to the 2015 nuclear deal have failed to fulfil their commitments under the pact, a day after Tehran announced further breaches of limits on its nuclear activity set by the pact.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190908&t=2&i=1427581554&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF870H5", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
