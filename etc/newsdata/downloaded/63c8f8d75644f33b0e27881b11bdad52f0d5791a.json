Not only did Osaka beat Gauff 6-3, 6-0 in their first match against each other, but the interaction between the two tennis stars afterward was a pivotal moment in the history of the sport.\n\nAfter winning the match, Osaka asked an emotional Gauff to join her during her winners\u2019 interview with ESPN. \u201cThese people are here for you,\u201d the 21-year-old Osaka told the 15-year-old Gauff. \u201cI think it\u2019s better than going into the shower and crying. We have to let these people know how you feel.\u201d Through tears, both women praised each other in the interview, with Osaka giving a shout-out to Gauff\u2019s parents. \u201cYou guys raised an amazing player,\u201d she said. \u201cI used to see you guys training in the same place as us. The both of us made it and are working as hard as we can. I think this is the most focused I have been since Australia.\u201d\n\nLater, during a press conference, Gauff described Osaka\u2019s kind gesture toward her as proof she was a \u201ctrue athlete,\u201d saying, \u201cthe definition of an athlete is someone who on the court treats you like their worst enemy, but off the court can be your best friend. And I think that\u2019s what she did today.\u201d Osaka also shared that her invitation to Gauff was \u201cinstinctive.\u201d \u201cI feel like the amount of media on her right now is kind of insane for her age,\u201d Osaka said. \u201cI just want her to, like, take care of herself.\u201d\n\nA moment that transcends the sport...#USOpen \ud83d\ude4c pic.twitter.com/dBQC3EUWX6 \u2014 US Open Tennis (@usopen) September 1, 2019\n\nLast year, Osaka displayed the same kind of grace after beating her idol, Serena Williams, during 2018\u2019s controversial U.S. Open final. Williams had lost to Osaka in a straight-sets defeat after she was given triple code violations from chair umpire Carlos Ramos, leading her to accuse him of sexism. During the trophy ceremony, the crowd booed Williams\u2019s loss, and Osaka was in tears. At the time, Williams displayed compassion and good sportsmanship toward her opponent, asking the fans not to boo, and she also did so in a letter she wrote to Osaka afterward.\n\n\u201cI thought I was doing the right thing in sticking up for myself. But I had no idea the media would pit us against each other,\u201d Williams had written. \u201cI would love the chance to live that moment over again. I am, was, and will always be happy for you and supportive of you. I would never, ever want the light to shine away from another female, specifically another black female athlete. I can\u2019t wait for your future, and believe me I will always be watching as a big fan!\u201d Osaka responded: \u201cPeople can misunderstand anger for strength because they can\u2019t differentiate between the two. No one has stood up for themselves the way you have and you need to continue trailblazing.\u201d\n\nWilliams has also shown support for Gauff, saying she admires the teen\u2019s \u201cexcitement\u201d on the court. \u201cI think she\u2019s just incredibly talented, you know. I think anyone that\u2019s 15 playing like that, people are going to be drawn to them,\u201d she said.\n\nBoth Osaka and Gauff are at the beginning of their careers, both of which will undoubtedly reach extraordinary success. The sports industry, especially tennis, can be a ruthless, petty place. It\u2019s refreshing to see these young women support each other, despite being positioned by the world\n\nas enemies.\n\nStay in touch.
