And Friday\u2019s big U.S. jobs report is still to come.\n\nRead: Stocks mark worst start to a quarter since 2008 financial crisis as recession fears accelerate\n\nWe\u2019ve seen 48 hours of equity dumping by investors from unsettling economic, political and trade headlines. Welcome to the \u201crealm of emotional selling,\u201d cautions CrackedMarket blogger Jani Ziedins. \u201cEmotional sell-offs go further and last longer than routine dips.\u201d\n\nWhere are the optimists when you need them? Enter our call of the day from Citi strategists, who say it\u2019s \u201dtoo early to call the end of this 10-year global bull market,\u201d as they forecast more gains for global equity markets, led by the S&P 500.\n\nIf the biggest threat to their call \u2014 a global recession \u2014 can be avoided, the S&P can reach 3,300 by the end of 2020, predicts a Citi team led by Robert Buckland. That\u2019s just over a 14% gain from Wednesday\u2019s close.\n\nWhile Buckland and his team admit the risks to the global economy are rising, they note only four out of 18 factors on their so-called Bear Market Checklist are flashing sell signals for stocks. That compares to 2000 and 2007, when 17.5 and 13 factors, respectively, were saying get out of equities.\n\n\u201cIn previous cycles, the BMC red flags have accumulated gradually before rising exponentially in the last year of the bull market,\u201d they add.\n\nWorrying factors for now, they say, include stretched corporate balance sheets and cyclically high profitability for companies. Another concern is an inverted U.S. yield-curve \u2014 when the yield on the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, -3.91% is below that of the yield on the 2-year note TMUBMUSD02Y, -6.73% \u2014 because it has been a \u201cgood lead indicator of previous recessions,\u201d the collapse of company earnings and global bear markets, they say.\n\nHere\u2019s that checklist:\n\nThe market\n\nA third day of losses is building.
