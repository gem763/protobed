In one, a woman can be heard requesting medical attention for Hart at his house, saying the actor was \"not coherent at all.\" A witness who made a different call from the scene of the accident claimed he saw Hart being pulled from the driver's side window.\n\nAn unidentified man called 911 and described seeing \"the driver\" out of the car who looked \"hurt.\" He clarified to TMZ that the person he was referring to was the 40-year-old comedian. The witness assumed Hart was the driver because of where he was rescued from. According to the collision report, it was Hart's friend, Jared Black, who was behind the wheel.\n\nKevin Hart arrives at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards at Radio City Music Hall in New York City on August 20, 2018.

Black and passenger Rebecca Broxterman were still inside the destroyed 1970 Plymouth Barracuda when Hart left. The 911 caller said Black and his fianc\u00e9e were conscious, but \"scared because they're stuck in there.\" He added, \"The roof is crushed and the car is pretty totaled.\" You can hear the witness yell to both of them, \"Stay calm, help's coming!\" Black was eventually rescued from the driver's seat and the extent of his injuries are unknown. Broxterman was pulled out relatively unharmed.\n\nCHP spokesman Weston Haver tells Yahoo Entertainment that, as of Wednesday morning, they are not investigating whether Hart was driving.\n\n\"I know social media was trying to talk about, you know, 'Kevin Hart was driving,' but as far as the CHP is concerned we're not investigating that unless new evidence comes up suggesting that, whether that be a witness or some sort of cell phone footage,\" he explained. \"It might be looked at then, but as of right now there's nothing that's showing signs of that, no evidence.\"\n\nOfficer Haver also clarified that Hart is not in trouble for leaving the scene of the accident.\n\n\"No, it's not something we're going to investigate any further unless there's something that needs to be investigated,\" he said. \"[Kevin] left the scene, but still called 911 or someone from the house he went to called 911, so there's no sort of investigation in that sense.\"\n\nThat 911 call was made from the Harts\u2019 Calabasas home. An unidentified female caller described Hart as \"not coherent at all\" adding he \"can't move.\" She said the actor was okay and breathing, but \"something on his back is pulling out on his spine.\" She said no blood or bone was sticking out. The woman, who made the call at 2:13 a.m. Sunday morning, gave the dispatcher conflicting information about details of the crash. She said the accident happened about \"20 minutes ago... outside of our gated community.\" However, the Plymouth Barracuda went off Mulholland Highway at 12:45 a.m.\n\nThe CHP is looking into whether excessive speed was a factor in the crash, but officer Haver noted that's \"not really unique\" to this specific incident.\n\n\"It's something we look at with pretty much every collision, so it's not really unique to this collision,\" he stated. \"A lot of time speed is a factor... but that is something the investigating officer is looking into.\"\n\nHart was taken to a local hospital after suffering \"major back injuries.\" He successfully underwent back surgery on Sunday and is expected to make a full recovery. However, TMZ reports he will need extensive physical therapy in the coming weeks.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:\n\nWant daily pop culture news delivered to your inbox?
