My children are not going to sit in on Cabinet meetings.'\n\nKushner, a power broker at 38, is President Donald Trump's son-in-law. He told Israel's Channel 13 that Biden is 'entitled to his opinion, but a lot of the work that the president's had me doing over the last three years has actually been cleaning up the messes that Vice President Biden left behind.'\n\n'We inherited an ISIS caliphate, Iran was strong, Libya was a mess and a lot of our allies felt abandoned,' Kushner said. 'We worked very hard over the last three years to try and rebuild the Middle East and to put it in a much more stable framing.'\n\nSenior White House policy aide Jared Kushner told an Israeli TV interviewer that much of his work has consisted of 'cleaning up the messes that Vice President Biden left behind' in the Middle East, citing Iran, Syria, Libya and the ISIS caliphate as examples\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden called President Trump an 'idiot' in a '60 Minutes' interview and blasted him for employing family members in critical jobs\n\nTrump has had his daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, on his White House team since his inauguration; Kushner is Jewish and Ivanka converted before they were married in 2009\n\nThe president, he said, deserves credit for forcing the Middle East into 'a different paradigm,' and suggested Biden and Barack Obama deserve blame for showing indifference for eight years.\n\n'When we got into office Syria was a mess, in the middle of a civil war that's killed a half-million civilians,' Kushner added.\n\n'We've taken back the territorial caliphate of ISIS. And the work that the president's led, along with the military, and with the Special Forces and the intelligence community, to kill the leader of ISIS, is a very, very big step forward.'\n\nKushner gives very few television interviews. His last sit-down was in late May with Axios \u2013 a tense and uncomfortable encounter in which a journalist asked him why he had cozied up to Saudi prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nBefore that, his last television interview came in October 2018 with CNN.\n\nBiden questioned Trump son in law Jared Kushner's credentials to negotiate Mideast peace\n\nBiden referenced Trump's daughter, Ivanka, and said his own children would not work in his White House\n\nBiden had also questioned the president's intelligence during his '60 Minutes' interview.\n\n'He's an idiot ... Everybody knows it. Nobody doubts it,' he said, referring to Trump's frequent complaint that the long-lasting Russia probe was 'a hoax.'\n\nAnd he fended off Trump's claim that he's 'corrupt' for allegedly paving the way in China and Ukraine for his son Hunter to cash in on lucrative business deals while he was vice president.\n\n'Yeah. Mr. President, release your tax returns. Let's see how straight you are, okay old buddy? I put out 21 years of mine. So show us your tax returns ... You want to deal with corruption? Start to act like it. Release your tax returns or shut up,' Biden jabbed.\n\nPublic exposure of Hunter Biden's windfalls wherever his powerful father waved his hand has driven down the former VP's polling in New Hampshire and Iowa, two states whose voting results are critical for presidential primary candidates.\n\nBiden is trailing Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders in New Hampshire, while potential Iowa Caucusgoers put him in second place behind Warren.", "description": "Kushner said: 'We inherited an ISIS caliphate, Iran was strong, Libya was a mess and a lot of our allies felt abandoned.
