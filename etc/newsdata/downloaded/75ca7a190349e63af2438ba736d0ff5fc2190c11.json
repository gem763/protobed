They have no water. They have no nothing. They\u2019re dying. No medicine. Their hospitals are closed or don\u2019t even have electricity,\u201d Trump observed. Then came a note of reassurance. \u201cJust put this in the back of your mind,\u201d he told the journalist. \u201cIt\u2019s all going to be fine.\u201d\n\nIt was a stark reminder that the political turmoil over a whistle-blower complaint concerning Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine risks leaving a number of his urgent foreign-policy initiatives\u2014very serious unfinished business, such as curbing North Korea\u2019s nuclear-weapons program, preventing Iran\u2019s provocations, and striking a trade agreement with China\u2014in limbo.\n\nThis was especially evident with Venezuela as world leaders convened this past week. The struggle for legitimacy that has been playing out so fiercely in Caracas, where Maduro and Guaid\u00f3 lead a bizarre and extremely volatile coexistence, arrived in New York City.\n\nRead: How an elaborate plan to topple Venezuela\u2019s president went wrong\n\nMaduro skipped the gathering and instead visited with Vladimir Putin in Moscow, while Guaid\u00f3 flirted with the idea of attending but ultimately decided against it, instead beaming in by video to panels around New York on the situation in Venezuela.\n\nInside the United Nations, where it retains Venezuela\u2019s seat, the Maduro government racked up victories. Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza strutted through the halls, embracing friendly dignitaries while bashing Trump\u2019s hypocritical approach to sovereignty and the \u201cparallel government\u201d that \u201cnobody invited\u201d circling the UN like \u201cghosts.\u201d One of Maduro\u2019s delegates ostentatiously read a book about the national hero Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar in protest as Trump delivered remarks from the dais of the General Assembly hall, pledging to help Venezuelans \u201ctrapped\u201d in a \u201cnightmare\u201d of Maduro\u2019s making.\n\nOutside the United Nations, the Guaid\u00f3 government held sway. French President Emmanuel Macron, whose government recognizes Guaid\u00f3, greeted anti-Maduro protesters demonstrating just around the corner from the Maduro-controlled Venezuelan mission to the United Nations. A meeting of the Organization of American States, which has turned Venezuela\u2019s seat over to the Guaid\u00f3 government, concluded with an agreement to harmonize a system of escalating sanctions against the Maduro government. The United States pledged more humanitarian aid for Venezuela and Trump chaired a meeting on the way forward there, though it ended off-message with the U.S. president declaring to reporters that he was the victim of \u201cthe single greatest witch hunt in American history,\u201d as Guaid\u00f3 officials and Latin American leaders looked on.\n\nRead: The U.S. is running low on options to force Maduro out\n\nJulio Borges, a Colombia-based Venezuelan opposition leader who led Guaid\u00f3\u2019s UN delegation and oversees the foreign-relations portfolio, told me that one of his main goals in New York was to stress that it was Maduro who walked away from the Norway-sponsored dialogue.", "description": "\u201cIt\u2019s a do-or-die moment for every Venezuelan.\u201d", "authors": ["Uri Friedman"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/RTX74KIK/facebook.jpg?1569701906", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
