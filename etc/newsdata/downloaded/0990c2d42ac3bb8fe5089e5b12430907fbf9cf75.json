Exactly how much, nobody knows.", "language": "en", "text": "Other lawmakers are trying to outsource the math problem to tech companies, asking them to put a price on user data and regularly report that number to regulators.\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s a new challenge in the digital age to measure and value consumer data, fed to tech giants by tracking us via our many devices, including work computers, phones and even smart TVs.\n\nAD\n\nSigning up for Facebook or using Google\u2019s search engine is free. But consumers are trading their data \u2014 and the ability for those companies to help target them with ads \u2014 in exchange for those services. That\u2019s one of the reasons that pair of sneakers you eyed online on one website might appear to chase you in ads around the Internet.\n\nGoogle\u2019s ad arm brought in $32.6 billion in advertising dollars for the second quarter, while Facebook took in $16.6 billion in the same period. Facebook said that its 2.41 billion monthly active users generated an average of $7.05 each in revenue during the quarter between ad activity and other payments and fees.\n\nAD\n\nIn Powell\u2019s speech, he referenced research by MIT and the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. They found that people would have to be paid $17,530 per year to stop using search engines. Another group of researchers studied how much the average user would need to be paid to deactivate their Facebook account for one year. The result: more than $1,000, according to the researchers from Kenyon College, Susquehanna University, Michigan State University and Tufts University.\n\nAD\n\nConsumers have their own ideas. To help fuel the multimillion-dollar advertising businesses of Google and Facebook, Joshua Rivera, an avid Twitter user, said he guesses his personal data is worth about $10,000 a year.\n\n\u201cThose companies take the same data and can use it for really good purposes or really bad purposes,\u201d said the Albuquerque-based software engineer. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can really do about which one they choose.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nFor years, consumers have been willing to turn over their data in exchange for ads. But new concerns have surfaced about the type and volume of data collected, plus the way outside parties may abuse it.\n\nFacebook, which has borne the brunt of public scrutiny over data privacy, said in September that it had suspended tens of thousands of apps for possibly mishandling user data. The announcement came a year after reports that political consultancy Cambridge Analytica had accessed the data of 87 million Facebook users and targeted them with political ads.\n\nAD\n\nState attorneys general have launched antitrust investigations into Facebook and Google, questioning in part the industry\u2019s access to vast amounts of data, while lawmakers and regulators are probing all of the major tech companies for potential antitrust violations.\n\nAD\n\nTech companies are responding to those concerns. Facebook launched a tool that allows users to limit the data they share with apps, businesses and other groups. Google has rolled out ways for users to automatically delete certain data and ensure other data won\u2019t be saved to the user\u2019s account.\n\nFacebook declined to comment. In a statement, Google spokesman Aaron Stein said the company is \u201cconstantly investing in tools that help users control their data and automatic protections that secure it.\u201d\n\nHow officials choose to value user data and Internet-powered economic gains will affect how regulators police some of the world\u2019s most-profitable companies, including the fines and taxes imposed upon those organizations. Plus, data that more adequately captures the digital age could allow economists to explain why U.S. productivity has slowed in recent years.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn remarks this week, Powell said that some at the Fed have proposed valuing the services customers derive from their digital devices based on data volume. The research is in the early stages, he said.\n\n\u201cGood decisions require good data, but the data in hand are seldom as good as we would like,\u201d Powell said.\n\nOthers say they think the value shouldn\u2019t be measured at all.\n\nIn a statement, analyst Karen Gullo of the nonprofit organization Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group, said privacy is a human right, and valuing data could trigger more problems. Gullo said the foundation opposes anything that could threaten to create a situation in which privacy is seen as \u201cproperty that can be bought and sold,\u201d even if users get paid in the process.\n\nNewsom, California\u2019s governor, is behind one such proposal that would require big tech companies to pay users for their data.\n\n\u201cGiving out handfuls of dollars in exchange for data just lets companies\u2019 invasive data collection remain unchecked,\u201d said Gullo.\n\nAD", "description": "U.S. officials are struggling to quantify the value of digital activities and integrate those numbers into public policy.", "authors": ["Marie C.
