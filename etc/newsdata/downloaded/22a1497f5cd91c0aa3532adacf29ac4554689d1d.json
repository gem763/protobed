Think again. The social media platform now lets anyone create their own filters, and artists have wasted no time in getting creative. To try out their designs, simply go to an artist\u2019s account homepage, tap on the filter icon (a smiley face with sparkles) and select the one you want to use. If you come across a design you love so much that you want to use it all the time, follow its creator, and the filter will be added to your account. There are countless designs to explore, but to get you started, here are nine filters we think you\u2019ll love.\n\n5 vintage camera filter apps to give your photos that #throwback look\n\nYP reporter Nicola looks adorable with the Angel Shine filter!

Thanks to motion-tracking technology, these shimmering gold and silver wings and halo will follow you wherever you go.\n\nManga Anger by @filt.ar\n\nWe all need ways to express our anger from time to time. Been scolded by your parents? Missed out on that A+ grade by just half a point? Switch this filter on, open your mouth, and you\u2019ll instantly look as if you\u2019re about to explode, with red cheeks and smoke coming out of your ears. It\u2019s a definite #mood.\n\n5 apps to take your Instagram stories to influencer level\n\nHalloween from @insveta\n\nWith Halloween fast approaching, here is a filter that is absolutely perfect for the spooky season \u2013 the best part being that it will save you from spending hours applying layers of heavy face paint. With one tap, this filter will transform you into an extra on The Walking Dead. Be warned though: the effect is pretty realistic, so steer clear if you\u2019re squeamish.\n\nBeauty Stars by @sarah\n\nThanks to this genius beauty filter, you can achieve that no-make-up make-up look in an instant: soft brown eyeshadow, peach-coloured blush and a matte pink lip, all without picking up a single brush. Oh, and did we mention that every time you blink, a trail of glitter will literally come out of your eyes?\n\nJoanne shines bright with the Lucez no Roso filter. Photo: Veronica Lin\n\nLuzes no Rosto by @dearcintia_\n\nThe name of this filter \u2013 which means \u201cface lights\u201d in Portuguese \u2013 says it all. It will give your skin a gorgeous warm, sunset glow, highlighting your features in a way that would require at least five different shades of foundation to create in real life.\n\nI am EGG by @nikita.shabalin\n\nRemember that World Record Egg that broke the internet earlier this year? (check out our exclusive interview with the masterminds behind the Egg if you haven\u2019t already.) Well, now you can steal its enviable look. Honestly, it\u2019s just fun to see yourself transform into an egg, before flying around the kitchen on a silver spoon.\n\nHANA by @yeahwowcool\n\nIf you\u2019re into abstract art, or just feeling a little camera-shy, give HANA a go. It will transform your features into thousands of flower petals and autumn leaves. The artist, Vit Haratek, has several other cool filters \u2013 check out Cyber for a slightly edgier look.\n\nKeep calm and scroll on with these 10 soothing Instagram accounts\n\nLooking for something a bit more abstract? The HANA app turned Veronica into rose petals. Photo: Veronica Lintran\n\nArachnophobia by @nelzster01\n\nBillie Eilish fans rejoice! This filter, similar to Billie\u2019s iconic You Should See Me in a Crown music video, in which the singer has tarantulas crawling out of her mouth and all over her face, is great for pranking unsuspecting friends while getting into the mood of Halloween.\n\nMona Lisa by @bma_japan\n\nLeonardo da Vinci\u2019s famous creation has been inspiring artists to make their own imitations for years. If you\u2019ve ever wanted to put your own creative spin on the Renaissance masterpiece, now\u2019s your chance! Thanks to face tracking technology, you can manipulate the Mona Lisa\u2019s elegant features into whatever comical expression you like.", "description": "The social media platform now lets anyone create designs, from creepy spiders for your Halloween posts to an effortless no make-up look.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/instagram.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
