Champ closed with a 3-under 69 to finish at 17-under 271 at Silverado Resort.\n\nChamp raised both arms then shared a long embrace with his caddie before breaking into tears as he hugged his father on the green. Champ\u2019s grandfather, Mack, is fighting stomach cancer and is in hospice in Sacramento. Mack introduced Champ to golf at a young age.\n\nHadwin birdied the final three holes for a 67 to tie Champ at 16 under, then watched from nearby as Champ nearly chipped in for eagle on the par-5 18th before making the short birdie putt.\n\nMarc Leishman (65) was third at 14 under. Justin Thomas (69), Charles Howell III (68) and Zac Blair (68) were 13 under.\n\nChamp missed every fairway on the front nine but made several big second shots to stay in front. None was more impressive than after he drove into the far left rough on the par-5 fifth, pitched up and over a tall tree and onto the green 17 feet away and two-putted for birdie.\n\nChamp bogeyed No. 8, but rebounded with a birdie on No. 9. He had a short chip-in for par on No. 11 after chunking his approach shot.\n\nChamp\u2019s only other tour victory came last October in Mississippi at the Sanderson Farms Championship. He hadn\u2019t finished higher than sixth since, missing the cut 12 times.\n\nLPGA TOUR\n\nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) - Mi Jung Hur played bogey-free with the lead Sunday and never gave anyone a chance, closing with a 4-under 68 for a four-shot victory at the Indy Women in Tech Championship for her second LPGA Tour victory this year.\n\nHur opened with a 63 and went wire-to-wire for the first time in her career. The 29-year-old South Korean had 26 birdies for the week at Brickyard Crossing.\n\nNanna Koerstz Madsen birdied her last two holes for a 67 to finish alone in second, moving her from No. 70 to No. 44 in the Race to the CME Globe.
