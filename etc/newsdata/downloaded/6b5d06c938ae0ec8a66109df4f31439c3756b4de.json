All was going smoothly before he left to rehydrate and eat a big meal.\n\nBut, when it came time for his opponent Robin van Roosmalen (2-0 MMA, 0-0 BMMA) to weigh in, the craziness began. Contracted to a featherweight fight with Lencioni (5-2 MMA, 2-2 BMMA), van Roosmalen weighed over nine pounds heavier than the divisional limit at 155.25.\n\nWhile commission head Mike Mazzulli said they\u2019d allow the fight to carry on, Bellator and Lencioni could not comes to terms.\n\nAfter weigh-ins, MMA Junkie spoke to Lencioni, who shed light on the situation.\n\n\u201cWe were at the media day yesterday and I\u2019m not like a (expletive) talker or a crap talker, but I met (van Roosmalen) and he seemed like a nice guy,\u201d Lencioni said. \u201cI could just feel something was off. I felt something was off and then I just knew. I don\u2019t know how to explain it. I just had a feeling and you can call it whatever you want.\u201d\n\nIn Lencioni\u2019s mind, the miss wasn\u2019t an accident. The fight was scheduled to be van Roosmalen\u2019s first for a major MMA promotion. Lencioni thinks he may have gotten cold feet.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t get preachy up here,\u201d Lencioni said. \u201cTen pounds? That\u2019s a difference where someone does that intentionally to get out of a fight. I think his camp picked me and then realized, \u2018Oh crap. This guy is legit.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m baffled. Ten pounds is a whole other weight class. Weight classes exist for a reason. I will move down. I\u2019m not moving up. I\u2019m a nice scrawny guy. I like my muscles.\u201d\n\nIf it was a pound, or two pounds, or even five, Lencioni indicated the situation would be different. But van Roosmalen nearly missed by double digits, which is simply too much for Lencioni to justify.\n\nWhile he veered away from revealing any \u201cpillow talk\u201d between himself and the promotion, Lencioni said he didn\u2019t like the offers presented to him to keep the fight afloat. Given the circumstances, Lencioni didn\u2019t feel comfortable fighting for anything less than what he was due. To do so would be a disservice to MMA.\n\n\u201cI put some feelers out there and I didn\u2019t really like what I was hearing,\u201d Lencioni said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to treat this professionally, not personally. Too many fighters are too emotional. This is a business. We\u2019ve got to take this seriously. If someone doesn\u2019t, it just belittles and degrades the sport.\u201d\n\nOn top of preventing him from getting a win bonus and ruining his opportunity to compete this weekend, Lencioni sees van Roosmalen\u2019s miss as a potential shift in attention from media and fans.\n\n\u201cI was ready to fight and I know I was going to win,\u201d Lencioni said. \u201cThat\u2019s a fact. Ten pounds is too much. It\u2019s disrespectful. It\u2019s so unprofessional from a three-time world champion in another sport.\n\n\u201c\u2018GLORY kickboxing champion misses weight (by) ten pounds.\u2019 That\u2019s the headline. It\u2019s going to steal my thunder, man. Instead of, \u2018Cris Sunshine knocks out three-time glory champion.'\u201d\n\nBellator 232 takes place Saturday at Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville, Conn.
