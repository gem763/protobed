I'm not saying everyone should be walked home but having some awareness really helps.\"\n\nShe said the Good Samaritan had called to the man while they were on the bus saying: \"Why don't you sit back here? There's loads of seats.\"\n\nKitty said the man repeatedly asked where she was getting off.\n\nOnce the bus had driven past the town he said he was getting off, she quizzed him why he had not got off and he replied he was going to 'ride it to the end of the line'.\n\nBut around 10 minutes later, he immediately jumped up when she went to leave.\n\nKitty said she attempted to report the incident to police but was told because no crime was committed there was nothing they could do.", "description": "Kitty Lunness, 18, was so hysterical from the incident she didn't get chance to thank the kind bus passenger", "authors": ["Emma Grimshaw", "Amber Hicks", "Image", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20725955.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_RIP-Kind-strangers-gesture-after-seeing-girl-harassed-on-bus.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
