Jonny Evans came sprinting over to tell us we could get the record if we carry on doing what we're doing.\n\n\"We've gone all the way to the end and managed to do it, but it's a great victory and a great performance from the lads.\n\n\"I think it was a complete performance. We know when you've got ten men it can be difficult, but we also knew if we carried on with our game plan we could cause them lots of problems.\n\n\"As you can see from the result, it's credit to the boys and a great win.\"\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nWhen asked how this team compares to the Leicester team that won the Premier League title, Vardy added: \"I think football-wise it's obviously different - there was a lot of counter-attacking when we won the league.\n\n\"Tonight we showed we can attack, keep the ball really well do it at pace and hurt anyone.\"\n\nGary Neville heaped praise on Foxes boss Brendan Rodgers before the match, claiming he's good enough to get one of the top jobs in English football.\n\n(Image: Plumb Images)\n\n\"You look at Manchester City changing to Pep Guardiola and you probably won't see Brendan Rodgers' name linked with that job because people at the club will be thinking, maybe, someone else,\" said Neville.\n\n\"But why not? if you look at what he's done in terms of the football he plays and the improvement he has on players on the pitch.\"\n\n\"People say he hasn't won that much silverware but then people talk about Mauricio Pochettino really highly and he's not won silverware in England and then don't speak as highly of Brendan Rodgers. I know Pochettino got to a Champions League final.\n\n\"So in Brendan Rodgers' view - if he gets the top four this season - he should now be linked with the very best jobs in English football.\"", "description": "Leicester City ran out 9-0 winners over Southampton at St Mary's on Friday night", "authors": ["Jake Polden", "Image", "Sky Sports", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Pa", "Plumb Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20726993.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screen-Shot-2019-10-25-at-221110.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
