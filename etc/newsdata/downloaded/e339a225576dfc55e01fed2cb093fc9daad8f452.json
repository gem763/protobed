Now it\u2019s happened.\n\nFunds that track broad U.S. equity indexes hit $4.27 trillion in assets as of Aug. 31, according to Morningstar, giving them more money than actively-managed, stock-picking rivals for the first-ever monthly reporting period, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nFunds that try to beat the market had $4.25 trillion as of that date.\n\nThe passing of the torch is the is the latest chapter in one of the most dramatic transformations in the history of financial markets.\n\nAs the Journal reported, in the past decade, nearly $1.36 trillion in net flows were added to U.S. equity mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that mimic market indexes while some $1.32 trillion fled higher-costing actively managed counterparts.\n\n\u201cThat shift lowered the price of investing for individuals, reduced the influence of stock pickers and turned a handful of Wall Street outsiders into the biggest power brokers in the industry,\u201d the Journal wrote.\n\nIt\u2019s been a boon for indexing giants such as BlackRock, Vanguard Group and State Street Corp. , which \u201cnow wield considerable power over corporate America and can cast pivotal votes that determine everything from who sits on a company board to how executives deal with issues ranging from climate change to pay equity.\u201d\n\nThe Journal added that the rise of indexing has attracted scrutiny from those who are worried market-mimicking funds could distort prices and exacerbate market turbulence. \u2018\u2019Index giants have so far dismissed those concerns as fear mongering as they continue to grow,\u2019\u2019 the paper added.\n\n-- John Kimelman", "description": "Nearly $1.36 trillion in net flows were added to U.S. equity mutual funds and ETFs that mimic market indexes while some $1.32 trillion fled higher-costing actively managed counterparts.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-108181/social", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
