It has huge effects on their normal development, it renders children vulnerable to abuse and trafficking, and it massively impacts their life chances. And these dire statistics apply even to what we would see as well-run orphanages \u2026 The effect on children is universally poor.\u201d\n\nRowling was launching a three-year global campaign to challenge attitudes toward orphanage tourism and volunteering, #HelpingNotHelping. The campaign is backed by recently revised travel advice from the UK Foreign & Commonwealth Office warning of the potential harm of orphanage tourism and volunteering.\n\nHuge numbers of volunteers, tourists and backpackers visit residential children\u2019s institutions every year, creating a multimillion-dollar tourism industry that leaves children at risk of all forms of abuse, according to Lumos.\n\nChildren in institutions are 500 times more likely to take their own lives, 40 times more likely to have a criminal record and 10 times more likely to be involved in prostitution, the charity claims.\n\nResearch published on Thursday by Lumos and YouGov suggests volunteers are largely unaware of the potential harm their visits can do. An estimated two-thirds of UK students believe volunteering at an orphanage overseas would enhance their CV or career prospects, and one in five have either visited or volunteered at an orphanage overseas \u2013 or know someone who has.\n\nThe vast majority of students are also unaware that 80% of the 8 million children currently living in orphanages worldwide have at least one living parent, the research found.\n\n\u201cMost children in orphanages are not even \u2018orphans\u2019 \u2013 they are placed there due to reasons such as poverty, disability, or to receive an education, and many have a family who could care for them, given the right support,\u201d said Alex Christopoulos, deputy CEO of Lumos.\n\n\u201cIt is a tragedy that the vast sums of international funding and support that these orphanages receive could be used to help keep families together.\u201d\n\nRuth Wacuka, a One Young World ambassador from Kenya, was placed in a Nairobi orphanage with her three siblings while she was a young child, despite having two living parents. Her parents were told that she would be fed and educated, yet schooling was rare and she said she often went hungry \u2013 even as thousands of tourists visited the orphanage each year.\n\n\u201cThe orphanage was next to a giraffe sanctuary, so you can imagine how many visitors we would get,\u201d she told the audience at the four-day summit.\n\n\u201cThey would come to the sanctuary to take photos of the giraffes and then come to the orphanage to take pictures of me. But children are not tourist attractions. They are not animals. They have lives and destinies.\u201d\n\nEvidence to be published in the coming months by Lumos will show that children worldwide are increasingly being trafficked into institutions to attract donations and volunteers, said Chloe Setter, Lumos\u2019 senior adviser on anti-trafficking.\n\n\u201cMany orphanages, in particular unregistered orphanages, are run like a business and it\u2019s not a coincidence that they\u2019re often located in tourist areas,\u201d said Setter.\n\n\u201cWhat we see on the ground is families, and their children, being targeted by \u2018child-finders\u2019 who are sometimes paying them or otherwise encouraging them to give their child up to the orphanage for a \u2018better life\u2019, with education being one of the main reasons, usually because of poverty.\u201d\n\n'Closing orphanages isn\u2019t enough': the centres supporting children and families in Uganda Read more\n\nIn its official advice on volunteering with children, the FCO highlights how orphanage volunteers and visitors may \u201cunknowingly contribute towards child exploitation\u201d and put themselves at risk of \u201caccusations of improper behaviour\u201d. It also notes that a \u201cregular turnover of volunteers without relevant training and experience can be harmful to children\u2019s development and emotional wellbeing.\u201d\n\nThe #HelpingNotHelping campaign is calling on schools, colleges and universities for support, as most students who have previously visited orphanages did so through educational organisations, research found.\n\nRowling said students hoping to travel overseas for their gap year, or to volunteer abroad, should investigate the institutions with which they were hoping to work.\n\n\u201cMy message to young people today is: yes, volunteer \u2013 but plan carefully and thoughtfully. Your time and energy are precious: use them wisely and they will help change the world. Do not volunteer in orphanages. Instead, look at what drives children into institutions and dedicate your time to projects that tackle poverty or support communities with vital services.\u201d", "description": "Author highlights evidence suggesting that \u2018orphanage tourism\u2019 drives families apart and makes children vulnerable to abuse", "authors": ["Kate Hodal"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27b2a49cfc27a5eb24a365fcc951c8469e219d1a/693_760_1489_893/master/1489.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=33ba72a55ccc5810dfcad9d25307afec", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
