But if he does put on a helmet again, one former general manager thinks it could be a very familiar landing spot.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nJeff Diamond, former general manager of the Minnesota Vikings and president of the Tennessee Titans, sees Brown possibly back in the NFL as early as next season. While this all assumes that Brown is cleared of a litany of legal matters and isn\u2019t serious about his college studies at this juncture, there will undoubtedly be a certain level of interest in the former All-Pro wide receiver.\n\nAlready this year, Brown has been on three teams. The Pittsburgh Steelers traded him before the NFL Draft to the Oakland Raiders, who summarily cut him in September after an alleged physical altercation. Days later, the New England Patriots signed Brown, then released him within two weeks after he played one game.\n\nImage 1 of 9 \u25bc Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Antonio Brown, right, celebrates with DeMarcus Ayers after scoring his first of two touchdowns during the first half of an AFC wild-card NFL football game against the Miami Dolphins in Pittsburgh, Sunday, Jan. 8, 2017. (AP Photo/Don Wright)\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s done for the year. I think he\u2019s going to try to claim the Raiders [who] owe him some guaranteed money and the Patriots with the signing bonus,\u201d Diamond told FoxBusiness.com. \u201cHe\u2019ll take his time for this year but I expect him to land somewhere in 2020. I think he\u2019ll try to end this and all that, if \u2014 and that\u2019s a big one, if the sexual assault claims are not substantiated, then I expect him to be back somewhere in 2020.\u201d\n\nThat landing spot, Diamond thinks, is in New England.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Patriots have a reputation for being willing to take on rehabilitation projects and Brown was already targeted by the organization as fitting that mold. There also were reports that quarterback Tom Brady was disappointed to see Brown cut as the offense lost a potentially potent component.\n\nWhen asked where Brown might land, especially since he is considered a liability around the NFL, Diamond admitted the market is likely small. But his last team might just welcome a return.\n\n\u201cI think there are probably just a handful [of teams]. Honestly, the Patriots seem like one of the candidates and maybe that can resurface at some point if he\u2019s cleared of all these charges,\u201d Diamond said.\n\n\u201cI think they could potentially [sign him], if he\u2019s cleared of these charges. We\u2019ll see. It\u2019s hard to say, there\u2019s 32 teams out there. All it takes is one. The guy is obviously a physical talent, we know that. But he\u2019s a head case right now and in that regard, nobody wants to deal with that at this stage of the game. I won\u2019t be surprised \u2013 anything that happens with Antonio Brown would not surprise me.\u201d\n\nClick here to read more on Fox Business", "description": "Antonio Brown is likely done for the year but one former NFL general manager thinks he returns to the field next year but it might be with an old team.", "authors": ["Kristian Dyer"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/AP19258622133093.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
