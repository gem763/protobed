About half of the newly-constructed building\u2019s sprawling space will house art from the famed Paris museum, the world\u2019s biggest.\n\nConservation workrooms, study halls and a photo studio in the new center will be used for research.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Louvre has opened a new art conservation center some 200 kilometers (120 miles) from Paris to protect the museum's priceless artworks from its flood-prone reserves.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
