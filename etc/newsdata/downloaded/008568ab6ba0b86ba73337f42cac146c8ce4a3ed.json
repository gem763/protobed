A new book by a speechwriter for former Defense Secretary James Mattis reportedly recounts that Trump instructed Mattis to \u201cscrew Amazon\u201d out of a lucrative contract, because he was angry at coverage in The Washington Post, which is owned by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation found that Trump tried to persuade aides to lie and obstruct justice. And of course, the current impeachment investigation has turned up a growing pile of evidence that Trump directed subordinates to extract a quid pro quo from Ukraine, and may have illegally withheld military aid.\n\nAides have long treated the president like a child, unable to control his whims and in need of tutoring. Supporters have tended to put this a different way, arguing that Trump\u2019s flaws should be forgiven because he is \u201cnot a politician.\u201d These claims of ignorance no longer hold water. After nearly three years as president, he is no longer an outsider, and as the nation\u2019s top executive-branch officer, Trump can be expected to understand the law and follow it. Yet Kelly is plain: Without someone to stop him, the president will commit impeachable offenses.\n\nRead: John Kelly is a Trumpist after all\n\nWhether leaving was really up to Kelly, or whether it would have mattered if he had stayed, is up for debate. First, by the time Kelly left, he was reportedly not on speaking terms with Trump. (Perhaps this explains why his advice went unheeded or unheard; the president denied in a statement that Kelly ever said it.) Moreover, the idea that Kelly succeeded at keeping Trump in line is self-serving but absurd\u2014congressional committees may stay busy for years investigating matters that took place on his watch. And Kelly was ideologically in sync with Trump on many issues, diverging largely on execution and style.\n\nBut the Kelly era at the White House was placid only by comparison to the unprecedented chaos of the Reince Priebus period. The president remained capricious and reckless, and he engaged in extensive, uncharged obstruction of justice. It is remarkable that at this late stage in the president\u2019s term, some people still believe that he can be controlled or cajoled into running an orderly, law-abiding government, or that unelected aides are the proper stewards.\n\nNonetheless, Kelly\u2019s warnings about the president surrounding himself with sycophants were dramatically illustrated by the White House\u2019s response. \u201cI worked with John Kelly, and he was totally unequipped to handle the genius of our great president,\u201d Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement that must have sounded better and more rational in her head than it did on the page. If some Trump lieutenants are convinced that the president is bound to break the law, others loudly insist that he is infallible.\n\nNeither view is encouraging. Americans should expect that their president can withstand criticism and scrutiny, but they also can\u2019t place their hopes for rule of law in unelected staffers restraining the duly elected president. A president who can\u2019t be trusted not to commit impeachable offenses on his own is a president who can\u2019t be trusted to be president.", "description": "In the absence of an aide willing to tell the president he can\u2019t break the law, it was inevitable that Trump would commit impeachable acts, claims his former chief of staff.", "authors": ["David A.
