We've got Jesse (Lingard) playing in that three in midfield.\n\n\u201cMarcos played a World Cup final in a back three, Harry and Jonah (Phil Jones) were involved in a back three in a semi-final (for England).\u201d\n\nUnited have scored more than once in a game only three times in their past 25 outings, an alarming statistic, and not since their 4-0 opening day victory over Chelsea.\n\nA dearth of creativity from midfield is compounding problems for an attack that is already short of a proven goal scorer but Solskjaer is hoping to see United create more with two central strikers, such as Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial, and an advanced midfielder operating in behind, such as Lingard or Andreas Pereira, although the manager hinted that Daniel James could play in that position or upfront as he did against Liverpool. The system also helps to compensate for the absence of a natural right sided winger, a longstanding problem.\n\n\u201cDan can play in many positions, as can so many others,\u201d Solskjaer said. \u201cAndreas can play there (in the hole), Juan (Mata) can play there, Jesse can play there.\n\n\u201cSo we've got loads of players who can play behind two forwards. It's just about whos's fit, who's in form and what do we decide is the best against Norwich.\n\n\u201cThat (Rashford and Martial playing as a two) could happen, definitely. I thought Marcus and Dan James caused Liverpool problems, so it depends on who\u2019s fit.\n\n\u201cWe're looking more dangerous up front with two at the moment.\u201d\n\nAlthough Martial scored the decisive penalty against Partizan, Solskjaer was frustrated by the lack of intensity with which the France forward, in particular, pressed Partizan\u2019s defence. But the manager believes Martial\u2019s return after eight weeks out with a thigh injury will give him more options in attack.\n\n\u201cWe've not created as many (chances) as we like, we\u2019ve not scored as many goals as we'd like but Anthony's back, he got a goal and I'm sure you'll see us improve as a team with Anthony in the team because he does give us something different,\u201d Solskjaer said.", "description": "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has suggested he could persist with a back three after being encouraged by the way his Manchester United players have reacted to the change of system.", "authors": ["James Ducker", "Northern Football Correspondent", "Sam Dean", "Jamie Carragher", "Fiona Tomas"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/25/TELEMMGLPICT000214017258-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqFpD80NKTcqAzQqPjMGntoBwAGrDL23K10TDaOib4iLU.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
