The coach has kept a core of experience with Alun Wyn Jones leading the side on his 134th appearance for Wales, backed up by fellow Lions Jonathan Davies, Ken Owens, Justin Tipuric and Ross Moriarty.\n\nBut players who have had a minor role at the tournament in Japan, such as Hallam Amos, Nicky Smith and James Davies, will also get an outing, along with Owen Lane who arrived last week as a replacement for Liam Williams.\n\nEngland fined for V-shaped formation facing New Zealand\u2019s haka Read more\n\nWales have not beaten New Zealand since 1953 and have lost all 11 Tests to the All Blacks since Gatland, who is returning home to coach the Chiefs after the tournament, took charge at the end of 2007.\n\nNew Zealand made eight changes from the side that was overwhelmed by England in last Saturday\u2019s semi-final. Kieran Read leads the side from No 8 in his last Test while Ben Smith and Sonny Bill Williams will also have their final outings in the black jersey before moving to play abroad.\n\n\u201cIt was a tough team to select because everyone wanted to play,\u201d said the New Zealand head coach, Steve Hansen, who is in charge for the last time. \u201cThere has been a lot of external talk about this being a game no one wants, but we can\u2019t wait to play it. Everyone, players and management, wants to show that our last performance was not at the high standard we know we can play at.\n\n\u201cThis is a Test match against opponents who will be keen to make a statement. We will need attitude, intent and work ethic. It will be physical and fast and we are looking forward to it. It is another chance to wear the jersey and represent our country with pride.\u201d\n\nWales: 15-Hallam Amos, 14-Owen Lane, 13-Jonathan Davies, 12-Owen Watkin, 11-Josh Adams, 10-Rhys Patchell, 9-Tomos Williams, 8-Ross Moriarty, 7-James Davies, 6-Justin Tipuric, 5-Alun Wyn Jones (captain), 4-Adam Beard, 3-Dillon Lewis, 2-Ken Owens, 1-Nicky Smith.
