It is also imposing its own sharp limits on who is eligible for asylum. That\u2019s an unwelcome development for growing numbers of asylum-seeking Cubans who had long benefited from a generous U.S. approach and their government\u2019s unwillingness to take its people back.\n\nFor decades, Cubans fleeing the communist-governed island had for the most part enjoyed unique privileges. Even after the cold war ended, they were given a certain path to legal residence once they touched U.S. soil through the policy known as \u201cwet foot, dry foot.\u201d\n\nBut an agreement reached during the final days of the Obama administration ended that and required Cuba to take back citizens who receive deportation orders going forward and consider on a case-by-case basis the return of the thousands of other Cubans who had received such orders over the decades but remained in the U.S. because their country wouldn\u2019t take them back.\n\nSince Trump took office, more Cubans arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border have encountered new limits, including a policy introduced last month that denies protection to asylum seekers who have passed through another country before reaching Mexico and have not sought asylum there.\n\nDespite the new agreement, Cuba remains reluctant to take its people back, and is one of 10 countries that the U.S. government labels \u201crecalcitrant.\u201d That makes it difficult for the administration to enforce its aggressive measures against asylum \u2014 and leaves many Cubans in limbo.\n\nMany, like Sanchez, are baffled by their predicament.\n\nSanchez is married to Barbara Rodriguez, a naturalized U.S. citizen who lives in Miami, but was unable to apply for a visa in Cuba to join his wife in the U.S. because the Trump administration pulled most of its embassy staff out, outsourcing family-related visa petitions to consular services in Colombia or Guyana. Rodriguez claims Sanchez was facing increasing political persecution after having brushes with local authorities over such episodes as damaging a referendum ballot as a sign of protest.\n\nThe couple agreed he had to get out of Cuba, saying they had learned he was being investigated and could face jail time. Feeling they had no time to waste \u2014 and with no visa services available in Cuba \u2014 Sanchez traveled to Nicaragua and through Mexico to seek asylum in the U.S., at a port of entry where authorities detained him and later sent him to Immigration and Customs Enforcement for long-term custody.\n\n\u201cThis is plain cruel, despite arriving in this country and demonstrating that you are persecuted and that you have credible fear. After all, this gets thrown away,\u201d said his wife, Rodriguez, who talks to Sanchez on the phone daily. \u201cThe worse thing is that now I feel all that is left for him is deportation.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear how the Cuban government treats people who are deported from the U.S., but rights advocates and lawyers say they could face retaliation for claiming asylum, especially those who claimed they were being persecuted. By contrast, deportees to Mexico and Central American countries typically get a warm welcome home.\n\nCuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodr\u00edguez Parrilla told The Associated Press the increase in deportations stems from the country \u201cdiligently fulfilling its commitments\u201d outlined in the accord with the Obama administration, but at the same time he blasted the U.S. for cutting consular services in Havana.\n\n\u201cIt is a shame to politicize the human bond between people and between nations,\u201d he said.\n\nA chartered U.S. government flight landed in Havana on Sept. 27 with 96 Cubans aboard, and another with 120 arrived Aug. 30. U.S. officials say Cuba\u2019s acceptance of this limited number of deportees is a small step, but they believe the nation is still largely unwilling to work with the U.S. on repatriations. They note 39,243 Cubans living in the U.S. with deportation orders.\n\n\u201cCuba is kind of a thorn in their side in this area,\u201d said Julia Gelatt, senior policy analyst at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute.\n\nCuba remains on a U.S. government list of \u201crecalcitrant\u201d nations with nine other countries: China, Vietnam, Iran, Bhutan, Cambodia, Eritrea, Hong Kong, Laos and Pakistan.\n\nAbout 21,000 Cubans have presented themselves to officials at U.S.-Mexico crossings since last October, triple the number seen the previous 12 months, according to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection statistics.\n\nThousands more Cubans have been stranded in northern Mexico cities on wait lists to request asylum and through a program that forces migrants to wait south of the border for their asylum cases to play out.\n\nOf the Cubans who have been allowed into the U.S., many have been released from custody while they await court dates for their asylum cases, but hundreds have been turned over to ICE custody.\n\nAbout 5,000 Cubans have received deportation orders since the new U.S.-Cuba agreement, and 1,300 of them have been deported, according to ICE data.\n\nLuis Dayan Palmero left Cuba in April, traveling from Guyana to Brazil and Colombia, before passing through Central America and arriving in northern Mexico in August.\n\nHe crossed the Rio Grande and surrendered to Border Patrol agents, who sent him to Matamoros, Mexico. He now has a U.S. court appearing set this month.\n\n\u201cI plan to ask for asylum, and whatever happens is what God wants,\u201d Palmero said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Michael Weissenstein contributed to this story from Havana.", "description": "MIAMI (AP) \u2014 After seeking asylum in the United States at the Mexican border, Pablo Sanchez was placed in a detention center and is now facing what has", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/10/def959_immigration-deported-cubans-73741-barbara-rodriguez-in-aug-2019-photo-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
