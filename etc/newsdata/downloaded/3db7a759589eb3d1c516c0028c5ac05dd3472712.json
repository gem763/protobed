Washington Mystics coach Mike Thibault joked that his wife Nanci, though an athlete in her high school days, \u201cfeels like she\u2019s the lone wolf in the whole thing.\u201d\n\nFor the winningest coach in WNBA history, the coaching profession became a family affair. Thibault\u2019s daughter Carly Thibault-DuDonis and her husband Blake DuDonis both coach at the collegiate level, and son Eric Thibault has served on his father\u2019s staff for all seven seasons he\u2019s spent in Washington.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always a game on, there\u2019s always some discussion,\u201d Eric Thibault said. \u201cWe all have other interests, we all like other things, but I think it always kind of ends up coming back around to basketball.\u201d\n\nLike most players on Washington\u2019s roster, the father and son are setting out to capture their first WNBA championship. The No. 1 seed Mystics off their latest playoff run Tuesday when they host the Las Vegas Aces in Game 1 of the league semifinals. If they succeed, Eric Thibault will have played a vital role.\n\nLast winter, the Mystics elevated the younger Thibault, 32, from assistant to associate coach, but his family and Washington\u2019s players aren\u2019t the only ones who see his value and potential. Mike Thibault told The Washington Times that another WNBA team offered his son a head coaching job.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s clearly ready to be a head coach,\u201d the elder Thibault said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we made him an associate coach. That\u2019s why he turned down another head coaching job in this league in the last year, because I think eventually he\u2019s the obvious heir apparent when I give this up. I don\u2019t know when that will be.\u201d\n\nEric Thibault smiled as he said of his soon-to-be 69-year-old dad, \u201cHe\u2019s gonna coach for 15 more years, anyway, no matter what he says.\u201d\n\nThe younger Thibault went to the University of Missouri to study journalism, but he missed the sense of team that sports provided and basketball called him back. Throughout his college summers, Thibault helped his dad with scouting and individual workouts when he coached the Connecticut Sun.\n\n\u201cHe grasped things early on as a little kid,\u201d Mike Thibault said. \u201cHe has a great feel for players and how to talk to certain players and get through to certain players, and he\u2019s a great teacher. You don\u2019t have to be a great player to be able to teach the things that are important. He just had that knack.\u201d\n\nWhen the Mystics hired his father. Mike asked himself a tough question: Will a father-son collaboration work?\n\n\u201cI kind of debated and I asked some of my players in Connecticut who he had been around,\u201d Mike Thibault sad. \u201cKara Lawson, Asjha Jones \u2026 They said I would be crazy if I didn\u2019t hire him. They respected him and they were all older than him. I thought that was a great endorsement of their respect for his knowledge and his demeanor.\u201d\n\nThe Thibaults and the rest of the staff now face the task of getting the Mystics ready for a healthy and dangerous Aces team in the semifinals. Though the chance for his first WNBA title hangs in the balance, Mike Thibault said he feels the same as he does any day during the season.\n\n\u201cThe job of a good coach is to be a steady influence for your team,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need to know that what I\u2019m doing is putting them in their best position to win. That\u2019s the trust factor that they have with each other and with me.\n\n\u201cWe built up to this, and here we are.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
