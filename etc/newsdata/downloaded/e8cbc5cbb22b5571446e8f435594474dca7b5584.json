IF YOU STAY UP ALL NIGHT YOU MAY AS WELL BE 'DRUNK'\n\nYou may want to re-think that last minute exam cramming, as 'not sleeping for 16 hours can make you behave as if you have a blood alcohol level of .05 per cent'.\n\nAnd according to SA Health, a BAC of .05 - .08% is likely to make you at risk of impaired judgement and reduced inhibitions.\n\nThis fact has been backed up in multiple research projects, with one Australian study finding that after 17\u201319 hours without sleep, subjects' performance on some tests was equivalent or worse than that at a BAC of 0.05%.\n\nResponse speeds were also found to be as much as 50 per cent slower for some tests and 'accuracy measures were significantly poorer than at this level of alcohol'.\n\n2. EVERYBODY DREAMS, EVERY NIGHT\n\nEverybody dreams four to seven times each and every night.\n\n'If you can't remember them, you're not alone. Most people forget 90 per cent of their dreams,' Goodnight Co. wrote.\n\nAccording to Very Well Mind, common reasons for why dreams are forgotten include medication that suppresses REM sleep and sleep disorders.\n\n'As a general rule, dreams fade quickly after waking. The electrical signals and chemical signatures that constitute the experience of the dream may disappear as wakefulness ensues,' they wrote.\n\n'It is possible for elements of the dream to be recalled later in the day, perhaps triggered by an experience that reactivates the same area of the brain that created the dream overnight.\n\n'It is more likely that dreams will be remembered if your state of REM sleep is fragmented. Alarm clocks notoriously interrupt REM sleep towards morning.'\n\nThe brain can't create people, so it uses registered faces in your dreams - so even if you can't identify them, you've seen them before\n\n3. SHIFT WORKERS ARE AT INCREASED RISK OF DISEASE\n\nAccording to the International Classifications of Sleep Disorders, shift workers are at increased risk for chronic illnesses, cardiovascular diseases and gastrointestinal diseases.\n\nThis is because those who follow a schedule outside of the typical '9 to 5' tend to struggle with sleep disturbance and end up with 'shift work sleep disorder' - a circadian rhythm sleep disorder.\n\n'Circadian rhythm refers to the ~24hr rhythmic output of the human biological clock,' the Sleep Foundation reports.\n\n'It is considered a disorder because of the frequency with which people suffer from sleep disturbance and excessive sleepiness in trying to adapt to a shift work schedule.'\n\nHow can you manage shift work and your sleep? Out of everyone in the world, these people probably find it hardest to adapt to a regular sleeping routine. But you don't have to compromise your sleep hygiene or health just because of late nights: Avoid working consecutive shifts longer than 12 hours After night shifts, it is recommended that you have at least 48 hours off so your body can recover. When you have a day or two off from work, it is good idea to catch up on rest. Create an inviting sleep space Try using a diffuser with essential oils to create ambiance and relaxation, and if you're sleeping during the day, consider a Silk Sleep Mask to block out the light. Reduce screen time Light, noise, and content from televisions, smartphones, and tablets are stimulating and can cause difficulty falling asleep.

THE 'STRANGERS' IN YOUR DREAMS ARE REAL PEOPLE\n\nThe brain can't create people, so it uses registered faces in your dreams - so even if you can't identify them, you've seen them before.\n\n'An individual person could encounter dozens or even hundreds of human faces on a daily basis from commuting to and from school or work, or from seeing people on the news or in television and movies,' Erica Seigneur of the Stanford Neurosciences Institute, said.\n\n'Most of these people will remain strangers to our conscious selves, but their faces and figures will still be perceived and processed by our brains.\n\n'Because of this, it would be impossible to say for certain that you had never seen a person or face outside of your dream before.'\n\nShe did add, however, that while this theory cannot be tested in a 'meaningful or accurate way' it is 'more likely that our sleeping brain recycles previously seen faces rather than creating new ones'.\n\nWhat are dreams made of? During wakefulness our thoughts are influenced by input from both the external environment - i.e., the people and things we see, hear, and interact with - as well as our internal environment, i.e., our memories. During sleep, however, our brains receive very little input from the external environment, which leaves our memories as the source for most, if not all, of the material that makes up our dreams.

BLIND PEOPLE DREAM WITHOUT VISUALS\n\nAccording to The Goodnight Co., 'blind people are more likely to report feelings of touch, taste, and smell in their dreams compared to sighted people'.\n\n'This likely corresponds to their waking experience which relies more on these senses.'\n\nSpeaking to Vice Serbia, Nikola Zekic, who has been blind since birth, said his dreams consist mostly of 'sounds'.\n\n'As a child, I would often dream that I was falling. I would just keep falling all night long. I used to like it because it made me feel like I was flying.'\n\nHave a routine before you sleep: Try using a diffuser with essential oils to create ambiance and relaxation, and if you're sleeping during the day, consider a Silk Sleep Mask to block out light\n\n6. EVERYONE HAS DIFFERENT SLEEP NEEDS\n\nThe National Sleep Foundation released new guidelines in 2015 after experts from sleep, anatomy, physiology and neurology revised the recommended sleep ages.\n\nThey released the following:\n\nNewborns (0 to 3 months): 14 to 17 hours\n\nInfants (4 to 11 months): 12 to 15 hours\n\nToddlers (1 to 2 years): 11 to 14 hours\n\nPreschoolers (3 to 5 years): 10 to 13 hours\n\nSchool-age children (6 to 13 years): 9 to 11 hours\n\nTeenagers (14 to 17 years): 8 to 10 hours\n\nYounger adults (18 to 25 years): 7 to 9 hours\n\nAdults (26 to 64 years): 7 to 9 hours\n\nOlder adults (65+ years): 7 to 8 hours\n\nFactors such as illness, exercise, pregnancy and chronic problems should also be taken into account when deciding on the right amount of sleep for you.", "description": "From the science behind dreaming to the impact of an 'all-nighter' on your health and the secret to a good night's sleep, The Goodnight Co. recently shared their top facts, and they don't disappoint.", "authors": ["Laura House For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/01/19565874-0-image-a-3_1570754136440.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
