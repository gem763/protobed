Caressing, nudging. They\u2019re an invisible army on a peacekeeping mission, a peaceable horde. They mean no harm.\u201d\n\nLethem lets loose a riot of language across the subsequent pages, remaking a classic detective story with an uncontrollable flow of words. In his intelligent, engrossing and derivative adaptation of \u201cMotherless Brooklyn,\u201d Edward Norton has something tidier in mind.\n\nNorton, who wrote, directed, produced and stars in the film, has shifted the story from the \u201890s to the \u201850s, taking a then-contemporary twist on an old genre and sending it back to its late-noir heyday, along with all the period-appropriate trench coats, automobiles and venetian blinds. Norton first sought out the book more than 20 years ago - this is a longtime \u201cpassion project\u201d finally come to fruition - and it\u2019s clear that he wanted to enlarge the story\u2019s ambitions. He\u2019s after a \u201cChinatown\u201d for New York.\n\nLionel Essrog (Norton) is private dick whose mentor Frank Minna (Bruce Willis, whose infrequent appearance in movies of late has only heightened his powerful presence), adopted Lionel and raised him in his private investigator business. When Minna is killed in the film\u2019s opening scenes, Essrog throws himself into discovering the murderers, whipping up his fellow detectives - Tony (Bobby Cannavale), Gilbert (Ethan Suplee) and Danny (Dallas Roberts) - to join in the search.\n\nEssrog, at times donning the guise of a reporter, follows a trail of clues that leads him across the metropolis and into a broad city hall conspiracy that rises to the penthouse-heights of New York power. Along the way are trips through a not-yet-razed Penn Station, a handsome Washington Square Park and a pivotal Harlem jazz club (where Michael K. Williams plays a trumpet player). He befriends a black attorney, Laura Ross (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), who helps him realize the full scope of the corruption revolving around \u201cslum clearance\u201d policies of redevelopment, and how Minna figures into it.\n\nNorton is leading Essrog into foundational midcentury New York history. Just as Jake Gittes unwittingly uncovered the water supply sins on which Los Angeles was built in \u201cChinatown,\u201d \u201dMotherless Brooklyn\u201d winds its way through the neighborhood-destroying freeway laying of Robert Moses\u2019 New York. \u201cMotherless Brooklyn\u201d is more indebted, ultimately, to Robert Caro\u2019s \u201cThe Power Broker\u201d than Lethem\u2019s novel.\n\nThe Robert Moses doppelganger here is named Moses Randolph and played with perfection by Alec Baldwin, who\u2019s making something of a habit of playing New York\u2019s real-estate villains. In one fine moment with a large map of New York behind him, he insists that he\u2019s not above the law, \u201cI\u2019m ahead of it.\u201d\n\nTo some, this well-known history (there is also a Jane Jacobs-like figure protesting Randolph\u2019s brute-force policies) is too familiar to be particularly intriguing. It\u2019s a little like a gumshoe wandering into a text book. But not everyone is deeply versed in Moses\u2019 overwhelming imprint on New York City. And what makes \u201cMotherless Brooklyn\u201d respectable and even novel is this grafting of social history onto a genre tale. It\u2019s not exactly commonplace in today\u2019s movies to be taken down a rabbit hole about urban development. It\u2019s a laudable impulse, and Norton\u2019s film provides a welcome reminder of what we\u2019ve been missing.\n\nThere\u2019s certainly more to be gained from that side of \u201cMotherless Brooklyn\u201d than the showcase of Norton\u2019s performance. The actor, who famously played a stuttering schizophrenic in \u201cPrimal Fear,\u201d largely pulls it off with a full diet of tics, mannerisms, jerks and blurts. \u201cIt makes me say funny things, but I\u2019m not trying to be funny,\u201d Essrog, nicknamed \u201cFreakshow,\u201d tells someone. But the performance never feels like much more than an acting challenge.\n\nNorton, who last directed the 2000 romantic comedy \u201cKeeping the Faith,\u201d has made a resolutely sturdy movie, filled with excellent actors (Willem Dafoe is also in the mix) and composed - Dick Pope (\u201cMr. Turner\u201d) supplies the slick and shadowy cinematography - with a vivid feel for New York. \u201cMotherless Brooklyn\u201d is done well enough that you wish it had struck out on its own path, rather than crib from Robert Towne and Roman Polanski. It\u2019s hard to forget it, but that\u2019s \u201cChinatown.\u201d\n\n\u201cMotherless Brooklyn,\u201d a Warner Bros. release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America for language throughout including some sexual references, brief drug use, and violence. Running time: 144 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jonathan Lethem's novel about a private eye with Tourette's syndrome, \"Motherless Brooklyn,\" starts with a brilliant burst of uncontrolled profanity and an explanation of its protagonist's condition.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jake Coyle"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/30/film_review_-_motherless_brooklyn_59813_c0-103-2477-1547_s1200x700.jpg?98dc6d89072c546a7f929bf01988f7abd43628e7", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
