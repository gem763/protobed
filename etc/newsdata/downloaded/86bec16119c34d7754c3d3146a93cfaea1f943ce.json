Last September, he wowed the industry with a runway show in Brooklyn on the grounds of a 19th-century free black community, featuring black models and a gospel choir. Mr. Jean-Raymond\u2019s rumination on everyday black life\u2014as well as his high-concept, socially conscious designs\u2014made him a star.\n\nA few months later, he won a prize sponsored by the Council of Fashion Designers of America and Vogue for promising designers. But in a surprise move, he decided not to present a runway show the next season or release clothes according to fashion\u2019s traditional calendar. It was his way of rebelling against a system that can burn out designers by demanding new collections every few months.\n\nWhile some observers worried the 32-year-old Mr. Jean-Raymond would lose momentum without a high-profile presentation at New York Fashion Week in February, his absence instead seemed to stoke interest in the coming show. CB Rucker, Pyer Moss\u2019s operations director, says the label\u2019s Sept. 8 event will be \u201cemotional.\u201d The show at the Kings Theatre in Brooklyn, where the Haitian-American designer grew up, is one of the week\u2019s most anticipated events. Here are five reasons why:\n\nPyer Moss\u2019s September 2018 fashion show was at a Brooklyn center devoted to the historic preservation of a 19th-century free black community.

They didn\u2019t produce a show, Mr. Rucker said, in part because they wanted Pyer Moss\u2019s Sept. 2018 collection to register with fans before rushing out a new one.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going against the grain, basically saying, \u2018I don\u2019t need to do that. I have my following and if they\u2019re ready to roll with me, they will,\u2019 \u201d said Sharifa Murdock, who co-owns Liberty Fairs, a trade show that spotlights new, contemporary men\u2019s fashion and lifestyle brands.\n\nPyer Moss aims to treat \u201ccollections as ideas and messages rather than months on the calendar,\u201d Mr. Rucker said. The label presents clothes when they are ready, flouting the tradition of releasing spring and fall collections every six months.\n\n\u201c\u201cHe\u2019s forcing change in the systems that just don\u2019t work anymore.\u201d said Jennifer Minniti, chair of fashion at Pratt Institute. The college honored Mr. Jean-Raymond with the Pratt Fashion Visionary award in May.\n\nLast fall, Pyer Moss relaunched its retail strategy, pulling out of stores and building up its own e-commerce site. Mr. Jean-Raymond has since resumed selling clothes through a number of brick-and-mortar and online shops. \u201cOur customers resonate with Kerby\u2019s brand values and the message he puts forth through his collections,\u201d said Federico Barassi, senior director of menswear buying at Ssense, a Montreal-based retailer.\n\nHe has his finger on the pulse of contemporary culture\n\nTo the 70,000 followers of his personal Instagram account and 131,000 of his label\u2019s, Mr. Jean-Raymond endears himself by being down to earth and funny. On Instagram recently, he raunchily chronicled his unsuccessful efforts to get a Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen chicken sandwich.\n\nMr. Jean-Raymond celebrates hip-hop music, black culture and black style, which have all influenced pop culture. \u201cHe resonates because he has such a compelling story that comes from an authentic perspective,\u201d said Jian DeLeon, editorial director of Highsnobiety, a streetwear-to-high fashion media brand. Seeing Mr. Jean-Raymond in a prominent position inspires and validates members of Highsnobiety\u2019s audience, which includes many people of color, Mr. DeLeon said.\n\nShare Your Thoughts What in Pyer Moss\u2019s approach and designs do you find appealing?

There\u2019s something personal,\u201d said Steven Kolb, president of the CFDA. \u201cHe\u2019s very into telling his story in a way that relates to his customer base.\u201d\n\nA board of sketches and reference points in preparation for Pyer Moss\u2019s Sept. 8 fashion show.

His September 2018 show put portraits of black families by artist Derrick Adams onto clothing and featured collaborations with Cross Colours and FUBU, brands created by blacks in the late \u201980s and early \u201990s.\n\nThe sneakers he designs with Reebok have been a hit. \u201cKerby has injected the brand with fresh ideas while maintaining his unapologetic voice and design point of view,\u201d said Reebok president Matt O\u2019Toole. Reebok recently expanded the partnership, which includes clothes and accessories, naming Mr. Jean-Raymond artistic director of a new creative division.\n\nComing Up on the Runway New York Fashion Week, which runs Sept. 6-11, will feature notable events as the city tries to assert its relevance and cool factor. The week will be shorter, but jam-packed, under the aegis of Tom Ford, the new chairman of the Council of Fashion Designers of America. Rihanna will host the second annual show for her lingerie line, Savage X Fenty. Last year\u2019s set was a hothouse jungle with a glowing pond and diverse models of all shapes and sizes, including a few belly-baring pregnant ones. Model Slick Woods went into labor after and gave birth to a boy. This time, promoters promise a \u201cone-of-a-kind event blending music, fashion and culture\u201d and performances \u201cfrom some of the hottest acts in music.\u201d After taking his theatrical, no-expense-spared shows to Los Angeles, London, Milan, Shanghai and Paris, Tommy Hilfiger returns to New York with an \u201cexperiential runway event\u201d at the Apollo Theater in Harlem. It will feature the designer\u2019s second collaboration with actress Zendaya. Last season\u2019s Paris blowout included a performance by Grace Jones. Jason Wu, who catapulted to fame after Michelle Obama wore an embroidered silk chiffon one-shoulder gown he designed to her husband\u2019s 2009 inaugural ball, returns to the catwalk after two seasons off from runway shows to regroup amid waning buzz and a changed retail landscape. Zero + Maria Cornejo and Hyundai Motor Company will debut a sustainable collection made from upcycled car-seat waste. Prabal Gurung is celebrating his label\u2019s 10th anniversary, a milestone for a young designer in a fickle business. He moved his show to Spring Studios from Hudson Yards after the Manhattan site\u2019s developer, Stephen Ross of Related Companies, hosted a fundraiser for President Donald Trump.\n\nWrite to Ray A.
