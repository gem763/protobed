It\u2019s unclear how he died or how his death could have gone unnoticed for so long, but a close friend told Stuff that the man would sometimes \u201cgo off the grid for a week or so.\u201d\n\nThe man\u2019s stepfather recently contacted his friends on Sunday looking for him, the dead man\u2019s friend said, according to Stuff.\n\n\u201cHe contacted my friends first to try and reach him and when they couldn\u2019t, he told us he would call the police,\u201d the friend told the outlet.\n\nThe school and the man\u2019s family are working with law enforcement in their investigation and a coroner will determine his cause of death, New Zealand police said in a statement.\n\nIn her own statement, University Vice-Chancellor Professor Cheryl de la Rey said that it was \u201cinconceivable to imagine how these circumstances could have occurred.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Bus Driver, Aide Fired for Allegedly Kicking Elementary Schoolers Off Bus for Eating Chips \u2014 \u2018Deplorable\u2019\n\n\u201cWe are devastated by what has happened and extend our deepest sympathy to the family,\u201d de la Rey said. \u201cThis is an extremely distressing time for University students and staff.\u201d\n\nFew details about the incident have been made public \u2014 but New Zealand Education Minister Chris Hipkins acknowledged to the Associated Press that no one should be left in a dorm room for so long.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going into a hall of residence or a hostel, you are paying top dollar for not just a roof over your head but also the pastoral care that goes with that,\u201d Hipkins said. \u201cAnd I think clearly that\u2019s not been present in this case.\u201d\n\nThe incident has raised concerns among students about the level of care and attention provided at the university\u2019s resident halls, Stuff reported. Hipkins echoed those concerns to the AP.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be looking very closely at the regulatory and legal arrangements around the halls of residence and hostels to make sure they are as strong as they need to be,\u201d he said. \u201cBut clearly I\u2019m really concerned about this case.\u201d", "description": "N.Z.
