It centres on the fortunes \u2013 amorous and political \u2013 of Genji, the son of an emperor. The original manuscript of the story no longer exists, with the oldest versions of the story believed to have been transcribed by the poet Teika, who died in 1241.\n\nTop 10 books about Japan Read more\n\nUntil now, just four chapters of the 54-chapter story are confirmed to be Teika\u2019s transcriptions, but now a fifth chapter, which depicts Genji\u2019s encounter with the girl who becomes his wife, Murasaki, has also been identified as Teika\u2019s. The manuscript had been kept in an oblong chest in a storeroom at the Tokyo home of Motofuyu Okochi, a descendant of the former feudal lord of the Mikawa-Yoshida Domain in Aichi Prefecture, the Japan Times reported.\n\nExperts at Reizeike Shiguretei Bunko, a foundation for the preservation of cultural heritage, have now confirmed its authenticity, with the handwriting of the text, and the cover of the manuscript, identical to other Teika manuscripts. The foundation said although the newly-found manuscript \u201cmostly\u201d matches the common version of the story, there are some grammatical differences.\n\nAccording to the Asahi Shimbun, family records show the manuscript has been in the hands of the Okochi family since 1743, when it was handed down from the Kuroda family of the Fukuoka feudal domain.\n\nKyoto University professor Junko Yamamoto told the paper that previous research on the chapter has relied on manuscripts of The Tale of Genji that were completed about 250 years later. \u201cIt is very significant that this discovery of the manuscript edited by Teika will be available for researchers,\u201d she said.", "description": "A fifth part of The Tale of Genji, which was completed around 1010 by a woman later named Murasaki Shikibu, has been found in a house in Tokyo", "authors": ["Alison Flood"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4f06075ec0e60c45a6e1a884b0f535ba597408f/91_55_3701_2221/master/3701.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1aecad797fe36637e40fd10e96abff63", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
