Hardly Swears and Keith Yeung rattle through the line to mug Travel Datuk and Neil Callan. #HKracing #HappyWednesday pic.twitter.com/mpT4rcqSt1 \u2014 HKJC Racing (@HKJC_Racing) October 9, 2019\n\nOne of the most important people in Yeung\u2019s career is his old boss Almond Lee and in a nice touch to the occasion, Hardly Swears has a connection to the former trainer.\n\n\u201cThe main thing for me is that horse was bought by Almond for that owner. So that means something to me,\u201d Yeung said.\n\n\u201cOf course, Jimmy did a great job with the horse. The horse was injured for a season and to come back and get two wins straight away is a great effort. Even the last time I won on him, the thought passed through my head that if Almond was still here, that winner would be his.\n\n\u201cTo get my 250th winner on a horse bought by Almond, that means something special to me.\u201d\n\nYeung doesn\u2019t expect anything to change with the loss of the two-pound claim, keeping his approach very simple.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll just keep doing my job,\u201d he said. \u201cKeep trying, keep training and give every horse the best possible chance and ride the best race I can, that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nTing confirmed Yeung will keep the ride on Hardly Swears, who looks a likely type with a sharp turn of foot.\n\nThe gelding failed to impress in his Hong Kong debut last season, but he has strung together back-to-back victories to start this term and looks to have more upside.\n\n\u201cLast time he raced over 1,000m I said this horse would be better over 1,200m. The reason he won last start was because the pace was too fast and it was suitable for him to come from behind and win. I thought he had a very good chance of winning,\u201d said Ting, who also tasted success with Ballistic King.\n\n\u201cAt this stage we\u2019ll keep him at the Valley. In the morning he gets very nervous, but he\u2019s much more calm when he comes here. Maybe after one or two more races, we\u2019ll go to Sha Tin. Later on, I think 1,400m will be his best distance.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of trainers glad to get a win with a horse, Caspar Fownes was in a similar boat with Aurora Pegasus, who captured the second section of the Class Four Nakayama Handicap (1,200m).\n\nFownes had endured a horror run of seconds to begin the season \u2013 he had one winner and 10 runner-up finishes before the meeting started \u2013 and just as importantly, he did it with a horse who had faced his own share of difficulties.\n\n.@zpurton pockets a double as the Caspar Fownes-trained Aurora Pegasus breaks his duck at start 4 in Race 4. #HKracing #HappyWednesday pic.twitter.com/7g0xryxJml \u2014 HKJC Racing (@HKJC_Racing) October 9, 2019\n\n\u201cHopefully we can kick from now, they\u2019re racing well,\u201d Fownes said. \u201cI\u2019m just happy to get a win with him because he was one of those horses stuck on that shipment in New Zealand that kept getting delayed for eight months because of the strangles. He was never sick but we had to wait to get him.\u201d\n\nFownes later earned a double of his own when the promising Snap Fit made it a hat-trick of wins to start his career.\n\nTop jockey Zac Purton rode both of them to snare a treble after prevailing with the Paul O\u2019Sullivan-trained Starlot in the opener.\n\nFlash Famous has it for @SchofieldChad! That was the jockey's 3rd ride for the Frankie Lor stable this term... the same number as in the whole of last season. #HKracing #HappyWednesday pic.twitter.com/ccpVfoQx04 \u2014 HKJC Racing (@HKJC_Racing) October 9, 2019\n\nTrainer Frankie Lor Fu-chuen also enjoyed a double as Flame Lily (Joao Moreira) and Flash Famous (Chad Schofield) saluted.\n\nDanny Shum Chap-shing leapt to the top of the trainers\u2019 championship as All Wongchoy gave jockey Blake Shinn his second Hong Kong winner in the sixth race.
