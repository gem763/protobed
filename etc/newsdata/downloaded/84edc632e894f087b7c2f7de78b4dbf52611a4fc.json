One of the best performances I've seen in a long time but...... the fans will be unbearable\".\n\nEngland dominated the All Blacks throughout in Yokohama, booking a first final spot since 2007.\n\nJones was remaining focused after the final whistle however and insisted he doesn\u2019t care if the Red Rose are favourites when they meet either South Africa or Wales.\n\n\"We don't bet. We don't look at the bookies, we aren't concerned. Our expectation is to get better every day.\n\n\"We have another week in the competition, the prospect to work hard and see where we can take our game and get better.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\n\"We had great tactical discipline. You try and play at their game, you come off second best. We stuck to our game really well.\n\n\"I thought the discipline of our players was outstanding in attack and defence.\u201d\n\nJones added: \"They played really well, Steve Borthwick and Neal Hatley do a fantastic job with them, well drilled, tactically aware.\u201d\n\nEngland's hero of their 2003 World Cup success, Jonny Wilkinson, said the modern-day players were \"superheroes\".\n\n\"You look at the back-row guys, Curry and Underhill, their impact, it's immense,\" he said.\n\n\"It's easy to look at New Zealand and call them superheroes, but you have to do the same thing for our boys and give them credit.", "description": "England booked their World Cup Final place, a week after the ex-One Direction star's Ireland had been defeated by the All Blacks", "authors": ["Alex Richards", "Image", "Dave Hogan Getty Images For Bmi", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20728943.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_2019-BMI-London-Awards.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
