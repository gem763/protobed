Ol\u2019 Bug Eyes is the lead guest on \u201cThis Week,\u201d where he\u2019ll discuss all things impeachment. Among the inevitable topics: Tim Morrison\u2019s upcoming testimony; Friday\u2019s big court win for House Democrats on access to the Mueller probe\u2019s grand jury material; the House GOP\u2019s stunt in the SCIF earlier this week; and the timeline on impeachment, which Dems initially wanted to wrap up by Thanksgiving but which seems destined to carry over into December. And maybe beyond.\n\nOne question I\u2019d like to see Schiff answer is whether Democrats will move to impeach once they feel their case on Ukraine is made or whether they\u2019ll pause to look at other potential wrongdoing. The Mueller material is one possible avenue, but there\u2019s also the fact that Trump officials seem not to want to give straight answers on whether anyone has been pressuring China during trade talks to investigate the Bidens.\n\nDemocrats could branch out even further if they like:\n\nTrump called Mattis in summer 2018 and directed him to \"screw Amazon\" out of $10 billion cloud contract. \"Relaying the story to us during Small Group, Mattis said, 'We're not going to do that. This will be done by the book, both legally and ethically.\" https://t.co/wAdf7eH3GS \u2014 Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) October 26, 2019\n\nAmazon did end up being \u201cscrewed out of\u201d that contract, with news breaking late Friday night that it had gone to Microsoft instead in a surprise. Democrats could slow down impeachment in order to look at all of this, knowing that the longer it takes, the stronger the Republican argument becomes for letting voters decide all of this next November. Whereas if Dems decide to ignore all of it in the name of speeding up impeachment, they\u2019ll essentially forfeit any opportunity to look at it later. They only get one shot at impeaching Trump. Once the Senate acquits him on the Ukraine matter, any attempt to impeach him again will be scoffed at by voters as proof of Trump Derangement Syndrome by Pelosi\u2019s caucus.\n\nIt\u2019s mostly Democrats elsewhere on the dial this morning too, with Amy Klobuchar the star guest on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d and Eric Swalwell the top interview on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d for God knows what reason. Even the most prominent Republican scheduled (at least as I write this on Saturday) is Trump-skeptical: That would be Will Hurd, who\u2019s retiring from the House this year and who\u2019ll follow Schiff on \u201cThis Week.\u201d Hurd may be in Trump\u2019s corner on impeachment, though, as he\u2019s one of the Republicans on the Intel Committee who signed a letter this week blasting Schiff for how he\u2019s managed this process. Stay tuned.
