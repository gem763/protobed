Netanyahu might return his mandate from President Reuven Rivlin if negotiations fail, Likud has said.\n\nRivlin would likely turn to Benny Gantz, the former general and leader of Blue and White, to try to form a government. The president\u2019s attempts to glue the two big parties together in a power-sharing deal haven\u2019t worked so far, but their negotiating teams and leaders will meet again on Wednesday.\n\nIsrael has held two inconclusive elections in less than a year, resulting in political paralysis that may continue through the end of the year at a time of mounting diplomatic and regional security challenges. Netanyahu is also facing the prospect of being brought to trial on corruption charges. His legal woes may have given him an added incentive to stay in power, amid speculation he\u2019s been seeking to pass a law that would shield an incumbent leader from prosecution.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s Likud party slightly trailed Blue and White in the Sept. 17 election, but he had a slim lead when the factions were asked to recommend their choice for premier to Rivlin. Nearly two weeks on, little progress has been made in resolving the political stalemate.\n\nTo assemble a majority in parliament, Netanyahu\u2019s options are to secure a power-sharing pact, peel off lawmakers from the rival camp, or win the endorsement of former Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman. Liberman\u2019s refusal to join Netanyahu\u2019s coalition after April\u2019s election led to the do-over vote, and he has called for a unity government. Netanyahu resisted Liberman\u2019s calls to cut ultra-Orthodox military draft exemptions and has courted religious parties in the country.\n\nAny new talks will be clouded by a crucial hearing this week into the corruption allegations against the premier, which have undermined the last three years of his tenure and are complicating his bid to stay in power.\n\nGantz has said that Blue and White won\u2019t sit in a government whose potential leader is facing a serious indictment.\n\nNetanyahu allegedly received expensive gifts from wealthy businessmen and is accused of reshaping the country\u2019s communications landscape to benefit a media mogul in return for sympathetic coverage. He\u2019s denied the allegations and said they are politically motivated.\n\nHis hearing before Israel\u2019s attorney general, Avihai Mandelblit, is scheduled to begin on Oct. 2. Israeli television reported that Mandelblit aims to deliver a verdict some time in November.\n\n(Updates with information on political standoff from third paragraph.)\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Alisa Odenheimer in Jerusalem at aodenheimer@bloomberg.net;Thomas Seal in London at tseal@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Shaji Mathew at shajimathew@bloomberg.net, Andrew Davis, James Amott\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will make a last ditch effort to form a government after elections this month produced a parliamentary stalemate, his Likud party said in a text message.Talks on Sunday morning with the rival Blue and White party to form a unity government ended", "authors": ["Alisa Odenheimer", "Thomas Seal"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5TA9ULakki9RN0wG1ePZTQ--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/ecca6038a35427e92b9cd7acfe3681dc", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
