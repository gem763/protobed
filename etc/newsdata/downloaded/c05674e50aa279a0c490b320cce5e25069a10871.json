The New York Times noted that he hadn\u2019t \u201cadjusted his material\u201d for Broadway and was still making jokes about transgender people.\n\nVICE said to avoid it for not being sufficiently woke: \u201cBut now he chooses to blatantly ignore the historic criticism against his style of comedy and new loud-and-clear criticism from the trans community.\u201d Paste Magazine called it \u201cboring, hypocritical, and out of touch.\u201d And blue-checked \u201cfat girl on the web\u201d Stephanie Yeboah actually narc\u2019d on a Red Cross volunteer who criticized her \u201ccanceling\u201d of Chappelle. Nice.\n\nBrandon Morse of Twitchy sister-site RedState wrote a great piece on how Chappelle\u2019s special had at one point a 0 percent fresh rating on the review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nDave Chappelle Gets the 0% Treatment on Rotten Tomatoes at the Hands of Salty Critics https://t.co/H8Nqz2FY2J \u2014 Brandon Morse (@TheBrandonMorse) September 3, 2019\n\nMorse writes:\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder either. When the crowd thought Chapelle was making fun of Trump, Chappelle was actually making fun of them. He also said some things about guns and abortion that the left truly didn\u2019t appreciate. If you have the ability to do so, I recommend that you go see it for yourself. As I detail in a previous article, all the bad things you hear about it are things said by a leftist media that is aghast that someone would dare fall outside the approved boundaries they\u2019ve set.\n\nThe critic score no longer stands at 0 percent, but check out the discrepancy between the audience and critic scores:\n\nThis is the best example I can give that liberals are WAY over-represented in who gets to have a public voice\u2026.. pic.twitter.com/RTGFq9khbL \u2014 Educat\u00ebdHillbilly\u2122 (@RobProvince) September 3, 2019\n\nI've never even heard of Hannah Gadsby, and I already know just by looking at her how that show goes. \u2014 Eric Spencer (@JustEric) September 3, 2019\n\nWe can't leave important decisions like what's funny to mere peasants. \u2014 Ricky Dickburn (@rickydickburn) September 3, 2019\n\nI can't believe Nanette got that high with audiences.

Then when they have apologised people will contact employers and insist they're fired for being phobic. \u2014 Crist\u00f6f Taylor-Keogh (@SirChrisofKeogh) September 3, 2019\n\nHe said a lot of things that needed to be said. \u2014 Greg (@gregashaw) September 3, 2019\n\nAnd apparently the audience is skipping the warnings from VICE and Paste et al. anyway and really enjoying it.\n\nRelated:", "description": "Dave Chappelle's standup special has a 99 percent audience review score, but critics won't touch it.", "authors": ["Brett T.", "Posted At Pm On September"], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/chappelle.jpg"}
