They never counted on it being so hard for the race to move away from a 76-year-old who\u2019s lost two other presidential campaigns, with a long record full of potential hazards and a history of putting his foot in his mouth.\n\nBut many Democratic voters don\u2019t just have PTSD from 2016\u2014they have a daily, constantly refreshed panic about 2020. To these voters, it\u2019s understandable why the prospect of Uncle Joe, wrapping his arm around America and saying it\u2019s going to be all right, has resonated deeper now than it did when Biden and top aides first started privately laying out a potential campaign pitch over two years ago, still early into Trump\u2019s first term.\n\nRead: Joe Biden remembers when\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge help for him that he\u2019s running against someone so controversial,\u201d Elizabeth Thayer, a 28-year-old from Litchfield, New Hampshire, told me last Saturday. She was waiting to see South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg at a picnic in a park in Manchester.\n\nBiden has expressed annoyance over the past few months that people keep expecting his campaign to collapse. \u201cYou all said I was going to fail from the beginning. You said, \u2018Biden is going to start off and he\u2019s going to plummet,\u2019\u201d he said on his second trip to Iowa in June, pointing at me. (As I told him then, I hadn\u2019t said that, though it\u2019s true that I\u2019d reported other people said that.)\n\nHis campaign isn\u2019t coy about how much he owes to Trump. In a conference call with reporters last week, a person who according to the ground rules set for listening could only be identified as a \u201csenior campaign official,\u201d said, \u201cWe think voters are really in a serious mood,\u201d adding, \u201cthe fear about [Trump] being reelected is deep and it\u2019s defined.\u201d This person insisted that the campaign\u2019s research shows voters are inclined to choose Biden for his character and sense of stability, not just as a guy who can beat Trump. \u201cProbably the most common word used to define Trump these days is \u2018erratic,\u2019\u201d the campaign official said. \u201cFour years ago, the most common word to describe Trump was \u2018disruptor\u2019 \u2026 It\u2019s a totally different calculation. It\u2019s actually a very complicated and detailed assessment that voters have.\u201d\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, in her Saturday afternoon address to the New Hampshire Democratic Party convention in Manchester, took a clear dig at Biden. \u201cThere is a lot at stake, and people are scared. But we can\u2019t choose a candidate we don\u2019t believe in because we\u2019re scared,\u201d she said. \u201cI am not afraid, and for Democrats to win, you can\u2019t be afraid, either.\u201d The hundreds of volunteers Warren\u2019s campaign bused in to cheer for her as she took the stage chanted, \u201cWin with Warren!\u201d", "description": "The septuagenarian former vice president maintains a comfortable lead in the polls as Democrats head into the third debate.", "authors": ["Edward-Isaac Dovere"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/AP_19236718174516-1/facebook.jpg?1568149258", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
