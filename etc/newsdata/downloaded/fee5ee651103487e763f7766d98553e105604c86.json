He can also assign two board seats and will get a roughly US$185 million consulting fee.\n\nWeWork, reeling since it scrapped a planned public offering in September, had been considering two separate rescue packages from SoftBank and JPMorgan Chase & Co., to keep it from running out of money as soon as next month. The deal, which values the office-sharing startup at about US$8 billion, marks a shocking fall from grace for a business emblematic of the latest tech boom that bankers had once privately estimated could reach a valuation of as much as US$65 billion in the public markets.\n\nSoftBank, WeWork and JPMorgan either declined to comment or couldn\u2019t immediately be reached. Dow Jones earlier reported details of the deal.\n\nAs part of the deal, SoftBank is buying shares from Neumann as part of a broader offer to buy as much as US$3 billion from existing shareholders, one of the people familiar with the matter said. The investment firm will also provide Neumann with a US$500-million credit line, secured by some of his stock.\n\nSoftBank is WeWork\u2019s largest investor, and had committed more than US$10 billion to the company even before the bailout. As its estimated valuation cratered, WeWork last month ousted Neumann as chief executive officer and, eventually, pulled its IPO paperwork.\n\nThe cancelled public offering also left WeWork, which lost US$900 million in the first half of the year, without a crucial source of funding: a US$6-billion loan that had been contingent on a successful entrance into the public market.\n\nSoftBank\u2019s intervention into WeWork\u2019s implosion is happening at a particularly sensitive time for the Japanese investment powerhouse. SoftBank is currently looking to raise funding for a second version of the Vision Fund, its US$100-billion tech fund that reshaped the way the Silicon Valley startup world works by dint of its sheer size. Today, investors are expressing hesitance about the fund\u2019s second iteration, which SoftBank hopes to make even bigger than the first.\n\nIn a recent interview with the Nikkei Business magazine, Son said he was \u201cembarrassed and impatient\u201d with his recent track record. WeWork is not the only big bet for SoftBank that went south. It was also the largest investor in Uber Technologies Inc., whose stock price is down about a third since its May IPO.\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "Neumann is expected to sell about US$1 billion of stock to the Japanese investment firm as part of the deal, sources said", "authors": ["Gillian Tan", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/wework-6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
