Thousands are leaving the country or moving their assets abroad. Eskom and other SOEs' \u201ctroubles\u201d and the state that is at war with itself are daily news. Retail sales are down, new car sales are down, a poor economic outlook and violent unrest and strikes with criminal acts with major disruptions to various local communities across the country are evident. Extremists and racial tensions are on the rise, orchestrated by people with their own political agenda.\n\nAll this is aggravated because we only hear these negative reports and news in all the different media formats. Surely there are positive things you and those who are not against you are doing that will result in changes and improvements that will be forthcoming as a result.\n\nThe following suggestions are made to counteract the negativity and boost the morale of business and the citizens at large.\n\nEvery minister should report to you once per month on the positive changes that have taken place in their areas of responsibility, during the month. An abridged report by the Presidency can then be submitted to all the media. This can also be used as a base for a monthly TV broadcast by yourself to highlight some of the achievements or plans that are in place, this opportunity can also then be used for you to express your concerns, and to condemn any inappropriate behavior from whatever source. Demand that those individuals in any public office that do not abide by the rules and regulation or are guilty of any misconduct be removed from office promptly.\n\nIn short, communicate with your people and demand positive change from all ministers, and local authorities, that will result in turning the tide of doom and gloom and make us all proud South Africans again.\n\nMy best wishes to you and a quote of inspiration:\n\n\u201cThe bravest are surely those who have the clearest vision of what is before them, glory any danger alike, and yet notwithstanding, go out to meet it.\u201d\n\nKind regards,\n\nJames Coetzer\n\nKnysna", "description": "Communicate with your people and demand positive change from all ministers, and local authorities, that will result in turning the tide of doom and gloom and make us all proud South Africans again.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8935/4e48859ebfbb425083c4e6f5c75ece2e.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-08-08"}
