Lorenzo gives his locks for the weekend. USA TODAY\n\nIt feels like the potential rebirth of a West Coast rivalry.\n\nThe Los Angeles Rams and San Francisco 49ers will play Sunday afternoon at the Coliseum and, for the first time in 18 years, they will face each other as winning teams.\n\nAnd like Dec. 9, 2001, when \u201cThe Greatest Show On Turf Rams\u201c turned away Jeff Garcia\u2019s 49ers 27-14, both teams could be headed to the postseason.\n\nThat is, if the two-time NFC West champion Rams (3-2), who have lost back-to-back games for just the second time under head coach Sean McVay, can find a way to steady the ship.\n\n\u201cEvery game is so important,\u201cMcVay said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been fortunate to have some success over the last couple of years, specifically in our division. But every single game represents a new chance to rewrite the narrative.\u201d\n\nRams head coach Sean McVay's team is dealing with injury issues as it tries to halt a two-game losing streak. (Photo: Kirby Lee, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nWEEK 6 PICKS: Do Dolphins or Redskins break into win column?\n\nSan Francisco, 4-0 for the first time since 1990, will attempt to do just that Sunday.\n\n\u201cI think any time you play someone in the division, it\u2019s got a little bit more juice than outside the division,\u201d San Francisco head coach Kyle Shanahan said. \u201cThis is our first divisional game, so we\u2019re excited about that.\u201d\n\nLeading the NFL in rushing and second in total defense at the quarter mark, San Francisco opens its divisional schedule coming off an impressive 31-3 beating of the Cleveland Browns Monday night.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t done a good job in our division these last two years and we definitely want to change that,\u201d Shanahan said. \u201cTo do that against a team like the Rams, who really have dominated these last two years, would be a very good start for us.\u201d\n\nIt may only be mid-October, but a defeat would pin Los Angeles three games in the loss column behind San Francisco in the division standings.\n\n\u201cWe go into every game trying to win,\u201d Rams quarterback Jared Goff said. \u201cI think especially a division game. That\u2019s where the pressure lies. It is a division game and we want to go out and win.\u201d\n\nThe Rams don\u2019t just find themselves looking up in the division the first time in the McVay Era, the head coach has some injury issues to navigate as he attempts to end the two-game losing streak.\n\nRunning back Todd Gurley has been ruled out with a quadriceps injury suffered in the 30-29 loss in Seattle on Oct. 3.\n\n\u201cI think he knows his body as well as anybody,\u201d McVay said.\n\nThat opens the door for backup Malcolm Brown to start and could hand third-round draft pick Darrell Henderson his first significant NFL opportunity.\n\n\u201cWe feel more than confident (Brown) can handle that and Darrell will look to get in there as well,\u201d McVay said.\n\nSamson Ebukam, who started at outside linebacker last season, steps into the role vacated by Clay Matthews III. Matthews suffered a broken jaw in Seattle and is expected to miss at least a month.\n\n\u201cI think (Matthews) had six sacks already in five games, so it tells you what he can do,\u201d McVay said. \u201cPlus, in the run game, I thought he played tremendously well against everybody\u2019s tight ends.\n\n\u201cBut Samson\u2019s played and he\u2019s started for us and he\u2019s done some good things. We feel comfortable with him playing there.\u201d\n\nFormer starter Troy Hill is set to fill in for starting cornerback Aqib Talib, who has been declared out with a rib injury.\n\n\u201cHe played a lot of football last year,\u201d McVay said of Hill. \u201cWe think he\u2019s a starting-caliber player. He\u2019s got great short-space quickness, good agilities, good lateral movement. He\u2019s got a good understanding of what we\u2019re trying to get done.\u201d\n\nHill grabbed his first NFL interception last season in San Francisco.\n\n\u201cWhen Troy\u2019s played, he\u2019s played well,\u201d McVay said. \u201cHe\u2019s played at a high level and we\u2019re very confident in Troy.\u201d\n\nThe two teams have split the home-and-home series last two seasons, but that\u2019s largely because the Rams were resting up for the postseason in consecutive Week 17 home losses, 48-32 in 2017 and 34-13 last year.\n\nSo, as this NorCal-SoCal rivalry turns a new page, the Rams find themselves in a position they have yet to experience in McVay\u2019s three seasons.", "description": "For the first time in 18 years, the 49ers (4-0) and Rams (3-2) will face each other as winning teams, but Los Angeles is trying to end slide.", "authors": ["Joe Curley", "Published A.M.
