Breitbart News reported earlier this month that Apple had removed a pro-democracy map application from its App Store that was designed to help protesters in Hong Kong avoid abusive police tactics. Other applications on the App Store, such as Waze, serve a similar function in letting users notify others of the presence of police officers.\n\nWhile Cook isn\u2019t the only tech industry executive to have served on the board, his chairmanship comes at a particularly fraught moment for Apple, when any relationship with China is likely to be closely scrutinized. The company faced a wave of criticism earlier this month when it removed a crowdsourced map of Hong Kong police presence from the App Store that was used by pro-democracy protestors. Cook defended the decision in an email to employees, arguing that the app had become a dangerous tool for tracking police \u2014 an idea that the app\u2019s developers have pushed back on.\n\nCook will serve a three-year team as the Chairman of Tsinghua University\u2019s economics school. Cook isn\u2019t the first Silicon Valley leader to take on a role at the university. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has previously served on the board of directors at Tsinghua University.\n\nStay tuned to Breitbart News for more updates on this story.", "description": "Apple CEO Tim Cook was named the chairman of a top Chinese business school this week amidst concerns about the relationship between the United States and communist China.", "authors": ["Tom Ciccotta"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Tim-Cook-Apple-CEO-in-China-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
