In the same interview she added, \u201cI was informed by an old school mentality, which is \u2014 you want to preserve your career and your success and your productivity, and there are people in the world who don\u2019t like you, and they don\u2019t like that you date girls, and they don\u2019t like that you don\u2019t identify as a quote unquote \u2018lesbian\u2019, but you also don\u2019t identify as a quote unquote \u2018heterosexual\u2019. And people like to know stuff, so what the fuck are you?\u2019\u201d\n\nAlthough it may, at times, appear as though LGBTQ representation and participation in Hollywood has achieved some semblance of parity, Stewart\u2019s experience is far from unique. Several young, openly LGBTQ actors such as Ellen Page and Ezra Miller have talked about how their gender and sexuality have affected how people talk to them about their careers.\n\nEllen Page, star of Inception, Juno, and Tallulah, came out as gay in 2014. \u201cI was distinctly told, by people in the industry, when I started to become known: \u2018People cannot know you\u2019re gay.\u2019,\u201d she said to Porter Edit earlier this year. \u201cAnd I was pressured \u2014 forced, in many cases \u2014 to always wear dresses and heels for events and photo shoots. As if lesbians don\u2019t wear dresses and heels. But I will never let anyone put me in anything I feel uncomfortable in ever again.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEzra Miller, who has starred in Justice League, Madame Bovary, and the most recent Harry Potter franchise Fantastic Beasts, came out as queer in 2012 to Out, and told GQ in 2018 that their gender is fluid.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m comfortable with all the pronouns. I let he/his/him ride, and that\u2019s fine,\u201d Miller said.\n\nBut Miller said they were told not to be open about their sexuality and gender by a number of people who thought it would damage their acting career.\n\nIn 2017, Miller said, \u201cI won\u2019t specify [who told me not to come out.] Folks in the industry, folks outside the industry. People I\u2019ve never spoken to. They said there\u2019s a reason so many gay, queer, gender-fluid people in Hollywood conceal their sexual identity, or their gender identity in their public image. I was told I had done a \u2018silly\u2019 thing in\u2026thwarting my own potential to be a leading man.\u201d\n\nSarah Paulson, who also chooses not to label her sexual identity, told Porter Edit in 2017 said that she was told that her relationship with Holland Taylor could be a liability for her career.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEarly on, when people found out I was with Holland, some said: \u2018I think you have to be careful, I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s going to affect your career negatively,'\u201d the Ocean\u2019s 8 actor said.\n\nOne of the most notorious examples of Hollywood reacting negatively to an actor\u2019s sexuality was Rupert Everett, star of My Best Friend\u2019s Wedding and A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream, who said that he stopped getting offers for roles in 2007. He has since focused on writing scripts and roles that he could play, such as poet and playwright Oscar Wilde.\n\nHe said in 2010, to BBC\u2019s Radio 4, that Hollywood is \u201can extremely conservative world\u201d that \u201cpretends to be a liberal world.\u201d\n\nAlthough LGBTQ character diversity in films is increasing in some respects, Hollywood has a lot of progress to make on LGBTQ inclusion. According to GLAAD\u2019s 2019 Studio Responsibility Index, LGBTQ characters had more screen time than in previous years \u2014 of the 20 LGBTQ-inclusive films released last year, 10 featured more than 10 minutes of screen-time for an LGBTQ character. When looking at each of the 45 LGBTQ characters GLAAD counted, 26 had less than three minutes of screen time and 16 had less than one minute of screen time. Transgender characters were absent from the 110 major studio releases for the second year in a row.\n\nAnd there is often tremendous buzz around movies\u2019 supposed LGBTQ representation, only to ultimately fail to deliver anything meaningful in terms of screen time or actual representation of a queer relationship.\n\nOften there is only a hint of a relationship, or a wink and a nod, rather than representation in line with relationships between straight people. Beauty and the Beast\u2019s live action remake was applauded for featuring a gay LeFou, but he was only very briefly shown dancing with a man in drag during a ballroom scene, largely for comedic effect. Finding Dory briefly showed two women together in a park, which some audience members interpreted as a lesbian couple and others didn\u2019t, and they were only shown in a speechless reaction shot. When questioned about the women, the movie\u2019s co-director Andrew Stanton said, \u201cThey can be whatever you want them to be. There\u2019s no right or wrong answer.\u201d Most recently, Marvel\u2019s Avengers Endgame tossed in a quick throwaway line alluding to a gay relationship, a scene Disney pumped up as the first openly gay character in the largest box office franchise in cinematic history.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome LGBTQ viewers were upset with the representation of Harry Potter character Albus Dumblemore in Fantastic Beasts: Crimes of Grindelwald, who J.K. Rowling said had a relationship of a \u201csexual dimension\u201d with Gellert Grindelwald. But when it came time to show that relationship onscreen and address Dumbledore\u2019s sexuality in general, the director, David Yates, said those things would not be explicit in the film. Similarly, in Thor: Ragnarok, the character Valkyrie \u2014 portrayed by out actress Tessa Thompson \u2014 had a scene which made her sexuality explicit but was ultimately cut from the film. Some of that representation may improve soon, however \u2014 In Thor: Love and Thunder, the next sequel in the same franchise, Valkyrie will reportedly get more explicit representation of a relationship with a woman, according to i09. Marvel Studios confirmed a romantic storyline of Valkyrie seeking a new queen.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/kristen-stewart.jpg?w=1920&h=1080&crop=1"}
