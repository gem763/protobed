There must also be a \"massive campaign\" to teach older men that gender-based violence will not be tolerated.\n\n\"In society, we need to address this demon of patriarchy,\" Ramaphosa said.\n\n\"We need to send a very clear message that there is no man that owns a woman.\"\n\n\"We need to stress that men must respect women and treat them with dignity,\" Ramaphosa said.", "description": "A billion rands is not enough to eradicate gender-based violence, which is caused by the  \"demon of patriarchy\", President Cyril Ramaphosa told the National Council of Provinces on Thursday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9410/3d3d19a013e5423dafca54f762f9b039.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
