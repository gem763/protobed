Serially successful entrepreneur Elon Musk claims that this method of transport poses a significant threat to the safety of people on the ground.\n\n\u201cThere will be zillions of these things flying all over the place and, inevitably, somebody\u2019s not going to service their car properly and they\u2019re going to drop a hubcap and it\u2019s going to guillotine somebody,\u201d Musk said at an event last year.", "description": "A \u201cflying taxi\u201d, dubbed the future of city transport, has been pulled over by police during tests along the River Seine in Paris.
