(Ricardo Moraes/Reuters)\n\nBrazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, under international pressure to curb the fires now spiking across the Amazon, is trying to crack down on the farmers and loggers who clear land by burning the rainforest.\n\nBut he\u2019s up against long-standing traditions, practices, laws \u2014 and some of his own rhetoric.\n\nFarmers in Brazil use fire to clear land. A decades-old law encourages them to invade the Amazon. And Bolsonaro, backed by Brazil\u2019s powerful agricultural lobby, campaigned on promises to open the rainforest to more farming, logging and mining \u2014 and against what he called \u201can industry of fines\u201d at Ibama, the environmental protection agency.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t allow Ibama to go around issuing fines left and right,\u201d the climate-change skeptic said shortly after his election last year. \u201cThe party is going to end.\u201d\n\nAnd he delivered: Since he took office in January, the agency says it has issued 29.4 percent fewer fines for violations, including illegal burning and deforestation.\n\nBut now Bolsonaro is trying to apply the brakes. He has declared a 60-day ban on the fires. He has sent troops to northern Brazil to crack down on deforestation. And authorities are investigating reports of coordinated arsons last month in what farmers and loggers on social media called a \u201cDay of Fire.\u201d\n\nBut there, again, is the conundrum for Bolsonaro: Rural leaders in the Amazon of state Par\u00e1 allegedly organized the fires along a highway across the rainforest to show support for Bolsonaro\u2019s loosening of environmental restrictions, the newspaper Globo Rural reported.\n\n\n\nHighway patrol officers show wood that has been confiscated from illegal loggers at a checkpoint in Altamira in April.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nFarmers have long used fire to cut through jungle too dense for machines. The burned vegetation makes the soil fertile and cuts down on pests. But fire also plays a key role in illegal deforestation.\n\n[Why the Amazon is burning, and why it\u2019s likely to get worse]\n\n\u201cFires mark one of the last stages in deforestation,\u201d said Raoni Raj\u00e3o, a professor of environmental management at the Federal University of Minas Gerais. \u201cFirst, the expensive wood is removed. Then, the bush is left to dry. Finally, fires are set to clear the land before grass can be planted for pasture.\u201d\n\nBrazilian farmers say they\u2019re being blamed unfairly for the fires. Marcos da Rosa, a former president of Brazil\u2019s Soy Producers Association, said they\u2019re often caused by inexperienced settlers, who use fires to clear land without understanding the risks.\n\n\u201cThe guy sparks a fire to clear one or two hectares outside his house and the wind comes and spreads it,\u201d said da Rosa, a soy and cattle farmer. \u201cSuddenly, it takes over his whole pasture.\u201d\n\nMore experienced farmers stopped using fire to clear land decades ago because it can be so difficult to manage, he said.\n\nBrazil has long provided incentives for farmers to move into, burn and develop the Amazon.\n\nThe government owns vast, uninhabited swaths of the rainforest. In an effort to settle that land in the 1970s, lawmakers approved legislation that allows squatters who can establish economic activity on a parcel for five years to buy the title at a discount.\n\nFire allows farmers to clear land for pasture quickly and cheaply.\n\n\u201cThere is this Wild West logic to the law in the Amazon,\u201d Raj\u00e3o said. \u201cThe idea was that Brazil must integrate the Amazon to maintain control over it.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, pressured by the country\u2019s agricultural lobby, lawmakers expanded the law to allow for the privatization of larger patches of land. Last year, the government issued 90,000 such land titles throughout the country, according to the Ministry of Agriculture.\n\n[As the Amazon burns, breathing problems spike]\n\nSpeculation has also fueled deforestation. The risk of being fined by Ibama pales in comparison to the potential profits. Deforested land in the Amazon that has been converted to pasture can be sold at up to six times the price paid to the government, Raj\u00e3o said.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand, you give concrete incentives for deforestation, and even subsidize it,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other, you fine people who get caught doing it. It creates a logic of outsmarting the system.\u201d\n\n\n\nFarmers walk among the smoke and dust left by the fires in the Amazon rainforest, near Porto Velho, Brazil, on Aug. 29. (Joedson Alves/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\n\nFarmers take advantage during periods of lax government oversight to grab and deforest more land. The activity has grown under Bolsonaro: Through July, deforestation was up 40 percent, compared to the same period last year, Brazil\u2019s National Institute for Space Research reported last month.\n\nIn an open letter to the government, more than 400 Ibama employees warned that the country\u2019s environmental protection system was on the brink of collapse \u2014 and blamed the fires on cuts in resources. They said the agency\u2019s budget was cut by 45 percent from 2010 to 2019.\n\n\u201cWe cannot dissociate these factors from the clear increase in deforestation and fires,\u201d they wrote.\n\n[Putting out the Amazon fires isn\u2019t just a physical challenge \u2014 it\u2019s a political one]\n\nNow Brazilian police are investigating reports that more than 70 farmers and loggers used a WhatsApp group to organize the Day of Fire on Aug. 10.\n\nMore than 30,000 fires burned in the rainforest in August alone, a nine-year high, according to the space research institute.\n\nThe fires have prompted activists to call for boycotts of Brazilian goods. Fifteen fashion labels, including Vans, Kipling and Timberland, have said they will not import Brazilian leather. Finland has called for a ban on Brazilian beef imports to the European Union.\n\n\n\nAn aerial view of a burned tract of the Amazon near Porto Velho, Brazil, on Aug. 29.

(Ricardo Moraes/Reuters)\n\nNow Bolsonaro is under pressure from the agricultural lobby that helped get him elected to ease tensions with the international community before boycotts impact their profits.\n\nBolsonaro has said farmers and loggers would no longer be allowed to use fires to clear land. But critics said the efforts would be hard to enforce without changes. Ibama is unable to effectively patrol a rainforest that covers 60 percent of Brazil\u2019s territory.\n\nGovernors of the Amazon states have warned that land ownership laws must be rewritten before they can clamp down on deforestation.\n\n\u201cWithout land reform, we have great difficulty holding accountable the people who commit this crime,\u201d Wilson Lima, governor of Amazonas state, told Bolsonaro in a meeting last month. \u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly whose land it is.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nBrazil\u2019s Bolsonaro says he might accept G-7 offer to help fight Amazon fires \u2014 if Macron apologizes\n\nThe world wants to save the Amazon rainforest. Brazil\u2019s Bolsonaro says hands off.\n\nThe Amazon is burning. Bolsonaro says his critics are setting the fires, to make him look bad.\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Farmers have long used fire to cut through jungle too dense for machines.
