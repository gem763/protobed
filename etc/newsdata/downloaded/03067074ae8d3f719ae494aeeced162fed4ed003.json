Chief Executive Officer Corie Barry delivered a five-year plan that sees revenue and profitability improving by offering new services, expanding its e-commerce arm and moving into new areas like health care.\n\nThe company forecast revenue of $50 billion in 2024, which implies growth of about 3% annually over five years, according to Morgan Stanley. That would be an acceleration from 1.7% last year. Best Buy also expects to reduce costs by an additional $1 billion on top of the $2.1 billion it has saved over the past five years, it said in a statement Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe financial goals were better than we and the market were expecting,\u201d Simeon Gutman, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said in a note. \u201cWe were expecting a flattish margin outlook.\u201d\n\nBest Buy, whose stock was little changed on Wednesday, shared more details of its plan with investors in New York, the company\u2019s first such event under Barry, who took the reins from Hubert Joly in June. Interest is high in the expansion of its fledgling health unit, which Morgan Stanley says could deliver as much as $46 billion in additional revenue over the next 10 to 20 years. The strategy ranges from selling fitness machines to sensor networks to help care for the growing population of aging Americans.\n\nBest Buy said Wednesday it will serve five million seniors over the next five years, part of a broader goal to double the number of \u201csignificant customer-relationship events\u201d like in-home sales consultations and annual tech support to 50 million.\n\nGrowth Initiatives\n\n\u201cThe strategy is the right one and we are headed in the right direction,\u201d Barry said in a presentation to reporters. \u201cThe question now is, where do we accelerate?\u201d\n\nBest Buy gave more details on new programs like total tech support, where customers can pay $200 a year to get help with any product they own, no matter where it was purchased. The service has 2 million paying members, about double the number in January. It also has an army of 600 salespeople who make free house calls to recommend products and services tailored to a customers\u2019 needs. Those customers spend more with Best Buy and visit its stores more often, the company said Wednesday.\n\nRemote monitoring of aging Americans, using unobtrusive sensor networks, is a market with \u201csignificant potential,\u201d Best Buy said, and it\u2019s already acquired several businesses in the space. The company plans to serve 5 million seniors in five years, up from about 1.1 million today.\n\nThose new initiatives are expensive to ramp up but should deliver fatter margins than Best Buy\u2019s core business of selling smartphones and TVs. The company forecast adjusted operating profit margins increasing to 5% in five years from 4.6% last year.\n\nAnalysts peppered Barry with questions about the health-care strategy, with some wondering aloud what Best Buy would bring to the table that\u2019s unique while others tried to figure out how much revenue the company could generate for each sensor network it deploys.\n\nTariff Cloud\n\nWhile Best Buy painted a rosy future, there are some clouds on the horizon. The retailer in August lowered the high end of its 2019 sales forecast, citing consumer \u201cuncertainty\u201d in the back half of the year. Growth in the consumer-electronics sector has been sluggish, although Barry said Wednesday that the industry is \u201cmore stable than often perceived.\u201d The trade war with China will also make her job tougher, especially as Best Buy is among the most exposed retailers to the latest round of tariffs, which could force the company to raise prices.\n\nBest Buy\u2019s five-year plan assumes that the impact of tariffs \u201cnormalizes over time,\u201d according to a company presentation.\n\nThe next big test for Barry is the holiday selling season, and expectations are high as the company has delivered two consecutive strong holiday performances. Rivals like Walmart Inc. and Target Corp. have beefed up their consumer-electronics offerings, while Amazon.com Inc. now promises next-day delivery of millions of items for members of its Prime program. Best Buy, meanwhile, said 40% of its online sales are picked up in its stores, and 80% of those orders are ready for pickup in 30 minutes or less.\n\nInvestors also heard from Chief Operating Officer Mike Mohan, finance chief Matt Bilunas and the heads of the company\u2019s health-care business and supply chain.\n\n(Updates with details on presentation in 10th paragraph and tariff assumptions in company forecast in 12th paragraph)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Matthew Boyle in New York at mboyle20@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Crayton Harrison at tharrison5@bloomberg.net, Lisa Wolfson, Jonathan Roeder\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- New Best Buy Co.
