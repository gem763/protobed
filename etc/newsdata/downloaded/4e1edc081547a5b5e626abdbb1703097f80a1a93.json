Whether you go for that or not, it is something else and we shouldn\u2019t be invaded by it.\n\n\u2018And so that\u2019s a big issue, and we need the theatre owners to step up for that, to allow theatres to show films that are narrative films.\u2019\n\nEarlier this week the director delivered a talk at Bafta\u2019s David Lean lecture in the Royal Opera House on Saturday where he launched into a scathing attack on Marvel, lamenting that \u2018theatres have become amusement parks.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Where do young people go to get their films financed now? I have no idea. They are not going to go to a Hollywood studio,\u2019 he told a packed-out hall.\n\nThe veteran director accused Marvel movies of taking over cinema (Picture: Rex)\n\n\u2018And then when you get it made, where is it going to be shown, when the theatres are all being taken over by the theme park films? Theatres have become amusement parks. That is all fine and good but don\u2019t invade everything else in that sense.\u2019\n\nHe continued: \u2018If you have a child and the child wants to see the picture, what are you going to do? It\u2019s up to you. The audience that sees them now, the fans that see those pictures now, they were raised on pictures like that.\n\n\u2018The technique is very well done but there is only one Spielberg, there is only one Lucas, James Cameron, it\u2019s a different thing now.\n\nMarvel actors have yet to respond to the director\u2019s comments (Picture: Rex)\n\n\u2018It\u2019s an invasion, so to speak, in the theatre.\u2019\n\nThe 76-year-old \u2013 who directed Taxi Driver, Goodfellas and Gangs Of The New York \u2013 previously told Empire magazine that he \u2018tried\u2019 to watch the Marvel films but he didn\u2019t feel they were \u2018cinema.\u2019\n\n\u2018Honestly, the closest I can think of them, as well made as they are, with actors doing the best they can under the circumstances, is theme parks. It isn\u2019t the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe isn\u2019t the first person to disparage the franchise. Jennifer Aniston claimed Marvel films are \u2018diminishing\u2019 cinema.\n\nExplaining her return to television with The Morning Show, she said: \u2018You\u2019re seeing what\u2019s available out there and it\u2019s just diminishing and diminishing in terms of, it\u2019s big Marvel movies.\n\nOr things that I\u2019m just not asked to do or really interested living in a green screen.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
