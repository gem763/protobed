Doug Jones (D) and Nancy Worley, the current head of the party, has revived painful allegations of racial discrimination, never far from the surface in a state at the heart of the battle for civil rights \u2014 even though both Jones and Worley are white and their chief allies are black.\n\nBut what makes matters complicated are the countercharges of generational discrimination and acrimony between the African American Democrats who were on the front lines of the fight for civil rights in the 1950s and 1960s and a younger group of rising leaders who say they are being shut out of the party they will soon control.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe dispute has even roped in Tom Perez Thomas Edward PerezClinton\u2019s top five vice presidential picks Government social programs: Triumph of hope over evidence Labor\u2019s 'wasteful spending and mismanagement\u201d at Workers\u2019 Comp MORE, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), who has withheld money meant to build up the state party and threatened to leave Alabama\u2019s delegation out of next year\u2019s party convention in Milwaukee. Legal costs have decimated the state party\u2019s campaign coffers, just a year before Jones faces reelection.\n\nIn a letter to Perez, two of Alabama\u2019s representatives to the DNC called it \u201ca urinating contest\u201d between factions at war over the future of the state party.\n\nThe feud began last August, when Jones made known he wanted Worley to step aside. But Worley ran for another term \u2014 beating back the entire slate Jones supported.\n\n\u201cHe went after Nancy\u2019s seat. He lost,\u201d said Joe Reed, a civil rights veteran who heads the Alabama Democratic Conference, the state\u2019s principal African American Democratic club, and Worley\u2019s most powerful ally. \u201cDoug\u2019s slate lost. He came back. He got with Perez. They then came up with a scheme to challenge Nancy\u2019s election.\u201d\n\nTwo groups of Alabama Democrats did challenge the election results, and Worley\u2019s handling of the meeting, in an official complaint lodged with the DNC. A detailed report found a series of rules and parliamentary violations and raised questions about the accuracy of the vote count.\n\nIn February, after that investigation, the DNC\u2019s Rules and Bylaws Committee vacated the August election results and ordered the state Democratic Party to come up with new bylaws meant to increase representation of minority and members of the LGBT community among party leadership.\n\nBut Worley and her allies ignored two DNC-set deadlines to present new bylaws in accord with DNC rules. In retaliation, the DNC revoked Worley and her vice chair\u2019s credentials to the party\u2019s summer meeting in August.\n\nEarlier this month, Worley held an executive committee meeting to approve yet another set of new bylaws \u2014 and again the DNC said those bylaws did not conform to national standards.\n\nInstead, the DNC has accepted bylaws passed by a rump faction of executive committee members, led by state Rep. Chris England (D), which held its own meeting earlier this month. In a letter to Worley, Perez said the DNC would recognize the results of the meeting held by England\u2019s faction and not the results of the meeting her faction held.\n\nIn statements after the dueling October meetings, Jones said the new bylaws would \u201ccreate a more transparent, diverse and inclusive Alabama Democratic Party.\u201d\n\nNow the two factions have set dueling meetings for November, when both intend to elect a new state party chair. Perez said he would recognize only the results of the England faction\u2019s meeting, scheduled for Nov. 2.\n\nEngland declined to be interviewed for this story. But at 43 years old, he is one of the leaders of the rising younger generation that is chafing to earn seats at the table.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s now a holding on to power, and from what I understand, many younger people, importantly including younger blacks and younger black legislators, simply feel as if they have no role in the party because Joe Reed has a throttle hold on which blacks become members of the party,\u201d said Harold Ickes, the longtime DNC rules expert whom Perez dispatched to observe the rival October meetings.\n\nWhen England\u2019s faction convenes early next month, he is likely to run for Worley\u2019s position. It is not clear if Worley, who says she will run for election too, will show up. If Worley decides to run for chair at her own meeting two weeks later, two different candidates may declare themselves the rightful chairs of the Alabama Democratic Party \u2014 less than a year before Jones is on the ballot.\n\n\u201cYou never know what will happen when it gets in court,\u201d Worley said in an interview. \u201cIf you\u2019re in a foxhole, I don\u2019t think you\u2019d want [Jones] in there with you.\u201d\n\nThe dispute has taken on racial overtones in a state where virtually everything political is viewed through the still-raw lens of racial division.\n\nThe bylaws at the heart of the DNC\u2019s complaint are the legacy of a decades-old plan meant to increase black representation within the state party. Reed says the new rules the DNC wants will substantially reduce black representation on the executive committee.\n\n\u201cWhat [Perez] is trying to do is turn the party over to Doug Jones and to strip black people of our traditional way of electing people to the\u201d executive committee, Reed said.\n\nReed called the England-led faction the \u201cDixiecrats,\u201d a reference to the white Democrats who left the party in the 1940s and 1950s in opposition to civil rights.\n\nBut today, the DNC says those rules no longer conform to national standards that require representation from other minorities, those with disabilities and those of other sexual orientations.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, Worley and Reed have made the situation quite racial,\u201d Ickes said.\n\nA spokesman for Perez, a former prosecutor in the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division and a civil rights adviser to the late Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) and former President Clinton, declined to comment on the record.\n\nFew outside Reed\u2019s circle see Jones as anything but a civil rights defender. As a U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Alabama, he prosecuted two members of the Ku Klux Klan for the 1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham. Four young black girls were killed in the bombing.\n\nIn 2007, the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute gave Jones a Distinguished Service Award for his work on the case.\n\nA group of younger black political leaders in Alabama is siding with Jones over Worley and Reed. In an open letter to Worley last week, 17 young black leaders accused her of keeping them off the central committee.\n\n\u201cWe continue to be treated as second class citizens by Ms. Worley and the SDEC, and it is time for that to stop,\u201d the group, led by Young Democrats of America Vice President Terri Chapman, said in its letter. \u201cWe deserve better. It is time for Nancy Worley and the SDEC to stop discriminating against us and include us at the table.\u201d\n\nKyle Whitmire, a columnist at the Alabama Media Group, said in a Reddit commentary that the divide reflects a long-running schism within Alabama\u2019s African American Democratic community.\n\nReed\u2019s group, the Alabama Democratic Conference (ADC), has been fighting with another group of black activists, the New South Coalition (NSC), since the 1980s, Whitmire said. Because of Reed\u2019s alliance with Worley, Reed\u2019s ADC holds more seats than those affiliated with the NSC on the state Democratic Party\u2019s executive committee.\n\nJones allies are worried that the dysfunction will hinder the party\u2019s ability to build a field operation in the months leading up to his reelection bid.\n\nJones, who won a special election in 2017 to fill a seat left vacant when President Trump Donald John TrumpKey witness in impeachment investigation asks federal judge to rule on testifying Pompeo voices support for work of diplomat criticized by Trump Biden, Sanders defend themselves over questions of age MORE tapped Jeff Sessions Jefferson (Jeff) Beauregard SessionsSanctuary city policies are a threat to decent people Trump attacks Sessions: A 'total disaster' and 'an embarrassment to the great state of Alabama' Ocasio-Cortez fires back at Washington Times after story on her 'high-dollar hairdo' MORE (R) to be his first attorney general, is the most endangered incumbent running for reelection next year.\n\nReed and other Worley allies said Perez had withheld more than $100,000 in state partnership funds, money meant to build capacity among state parties that rarely raise enough to operate at high levels on their own. He compared the unspent funds to Trump withholding military aid from Ukraine.\n\n\u201cPerez may be thinking he\u2019s helping Doug Jones, but he\u2019s hurting the Democratic Party,\u201d Reed said in an interview. \u201cThey\u2019re doing to Alabama what Trump is doing to Ukraine.\u201d\n\nBut Jones won his first election without the help of what his allies called a virtually nonexistent state party apparatus. Sources close to Jones said the campaign is preparing to rebuild the same type of field effort, one that\u2019s run in-house rather than through a state party organization.\n\nThe more immediate threat is to Alabama\u2019s delegation to the 2020 Democratic convention. The national party has not approved Alabama\u2019s delegate selection plan, which lays out how delegates awarded in the state\u2019s March 3 presidential primary are allocated. Without a delegate allocation plan, the DNC\u2019s convention credentials committee may not agree to seat the Alabamians who show up in Milwaukee claiming to represent their state.\n\n\u201cThe Alabama party as it exists under Worley\u2019s leadership has really put into question whether the Democratic National Committee will approve a delegate selection plan. And if that doesn\u2019t happen, Alabama will have no delegates to the national convention,\u201d Ickes said.\n\nEven more worrisome, Alabama state law requires a political party to certify candidates to appear on the ballot. To qualify for the March 3 presidential primary, candidates must file papers with the state Democratic Party by Nov. 8 \u2014 only days after England\u2019s faction holds its meeting.\n\nIf Worley does not back down, it is possible that two different people could claim to be chairman. A spokeswoman for Secretary of State John Merrill (R) declined to comment on the politics at play, but it is unclear which potential chair Merrill\u2019s office would recognize.\n\nIn a state Trump carried by nearly 28 percentage points in 2016, Jones cannot afford anything but complete party unity as he seeks a full term next year. In interviews, those in Worley\u2019s camp made clear the raw feelings that already exist are likely to continue until Election Day.\n\n\u201cInstead of us spending a whole year arguing among each other, we should have spent a whole year getting folks organized for Doug Jones. If a house divided cannot stand, a party divided cannot win. This thing has gotten to be a racial war. That\u2019s what it is,\u201d Reed said.", "description": "A struggle between the only Democratic senator in the Deep South and the head of his own state party organization has exploded into charges of discrimination and intimidation.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/jonesdoug_071019as.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
