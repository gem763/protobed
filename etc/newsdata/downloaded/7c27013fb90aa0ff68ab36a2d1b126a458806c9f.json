It\u2019s an American tradition that goes back a long way, though Europeans seem largely puzzled by it. How much you tip and what considerations go into your decision-making process when calculating the tip are a personal matter, though most of us probably take most of the same factors into account.\n\nWell, you can forget about everything I just said, at least according to Michelle Singletary at the Washington Post. You\u2019re supposed to tip 20% every time, no matter what. And the reason he provides for this new rule is rather startling. You see, you\u2019re not tipping based on the service you receive. You\u2019re making up for the wait staff\u2019s evil employer failing to pay them a living wage.\n\nTipping is not about you. When eating out at a restaurant, many diners believe that they should tip on a sliding scale based on the service they receive \u2014 good or bad\u2026 Employers \u2014 either to increase their profit margins or out of concern they will lose business because of higher prices \u2014 force customers to supplement their employees\u2019 wages with tips. But the price of my meal should include what it takes for the company to make a fair profit and pay its workers a living wage.\n\nSo all of you insufficiently woke people need to toe the line here. Until the day when all wait staff workers are earning a living wage, you need to just plan to cough up an extra 20 percent for every meal you have.\n\nPardon my saying, but this is an insane proposition and a product of someone who\u2019s been left soaking in the socialist waters for a bit too long.\n\nFirst and most obviously, tipping has always been about service. It\u2019s the basis for the practice. The waiter or waitress provides a big part of the entire \u201cexperience\u201d of eating out, and it\u2019s an experience that involves much more than just the quality of the food. In fact, I make a point of never downgrading the tip even if the food was less than satisfactory. That\u2019s not the waiter\u2019s fault. They don\u2019t cook the food.\n\nAs long as the person was pleasant, presented a clean appearance, took the orders correctly, kept the water glasses full and checked to see if you needed anything else, they will get a good tip from me. If the food is excellent on top of that it\u2019s just a happy bonus. (And unless you\u2019re in a new place, you probably know which restaurants and diners serve the sort of food you like anyway.) But a grouchy waiter who ignores your table or messes up the orders isn\u2019t going to do as well, and probably won\u2019t last long at one of the higher-end restaurants.\n\nAs far as the economics go, we\u2019ve been through all of this here before. Good waiters and waitresses can make far above minimum wage, even at busy breakfast or lunch diners, to say nothing of really upscale eateries. And the people who go into (and stay in) that line of work understand how the pay system works. So do their employers. As a customer, it is not your job to \u201cmake up for\u201d what you deem to be an insufficient wage arrangement. That\u2019s between the employer and the boss.\n\nGreat wait staff workers make great tips. Good waiters get good tips. Bad waiters don\u2019t last in the business very long. It\u2019s really not that complicated.", "description": "That's not how this works.
