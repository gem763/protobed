I\u2019m biting my lip as I sit across from her, pretending not to pay attention to the painfully slow click, click, click on the computer.\n\nI\u2019ve been banished to this side of the room. My offer to help her has been unceremoniously shut down. And it\u2019s eating me alive.\n\nRead Another POV From This Writer: I'm A Cool Mom: Spilling The Tea On Kids' Slang\n\nI open my mouth to ask: Does she have a punchy opener? Is there enough meat in the middle? How about a catchy closer?\n\nBut she quickly puts me in my place: \u201cThis is MY homework. Parents aren\u2019t allowed to help.\u201d\n\nWell excuse me, but doesn\u2019t she know who I am? I don\u2019t mean to brag here, but in Grade 8 I rocked my class speech contest. In fact, I won it for the whole school! How? My parents helped me. A lot.\n\nIs it wrong to want to do more than simply police my kid\u2019s education?\n\nI know that sounds wrong. And I blush a little as I type it. But \u201ccollaborating\u201d with my parents on my kickass speech that won the school contest is one of my favourite childhood memories. It was also the most valuable.\n\nAs a 12-year-old, I didn\u2019t have a clue how to write a compelling oral presentation. And while I had some wonderful teachers, the reality is that they didn\u2019t have the time to help me learn how to craft a speech. It was my mom and dad who instilled what components made for an interesting piece. And the thrill of succeeding ignited in me a lifelong passion for writing.\n\nBut as a parent, I struggle with how involved I should be in my kid\u2019s homework. There\u2019s a definite vibe that I should be a responsible parent who ensures my child completes her assignments. But when it comes to the actual nitty gritty of the work, I\u2019m supposed to back off. Is it wrong to want to do more than simply police my kid\u2019s education?\n\nYou'll Also Love: Top 7 Homework Excuses (And How To Handle Each One)\n\nApparently some people think it is. While most school boards suggest parents should help kids set up a quiet place and a regular work schedule, they otherwise recommend a hands-off approach. And some studies conclude that too much parental support can be detrimental to a kid\u2019s ability to work independently.\n\nBut not everyone agrees. A 2018 study showed that students develop a healthier and more positive attitude towards learning when they have a deeper understanding of how it will enhance their lives down the road. It seems to me that\u2019s where parents come in.\n\nWhat I want for my daughter, more than anything, is to help light a spark for her to want to learn. It\u2019s important she understand how she\u2019ll be able to apply her speech writing skills beyond the classroom. Maybe it\u2019ll be a job interview, arguing a case in court or running for office \u2014 or maybe it'll be an even more compelling argument as to why she should finally get her own YouTube channel.\n\nFor now, I remain on my side of the room as she clicks away at her speech. I\u2019m giving her the space to figure it out for herself.\n\nBut If she changes her mind and wants my help, this former speech-contest champ is ready, able and more than willing to pitch in.", "description": "My kid is sitting on the other side of the room, two-finger typing a speech for her class contest.\n\nI open my mouth to ask: Does she have a punchy opener?
