Public libraries in the more populated cities of New York, Los Angeles, Houston and Chicago still charge them.\n\n\u201cWe know that for some residents, the prospect of a late fee can act as a deterrence to using library services in the first place,\u201d Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego said after the vote.\n\nPhoenix City Librarian Rita Hamilton said the move would allow the system comprised of 17 libraries to ensure \u201cthat access to our resources is as equitable as possible.\u201d\n\nThe Phoenix has been charging 20 cents per item per day, which can add up quickly into dollars owed, an extra expense some families cannot afford. Other libraries around the nation charge 25-35 cents per item per day.\n\nPhoenix\u2019s move is part of a new worldwide trend by libraries to eliminate fines the American Library Association considers \u201ca form of social inequality.\u201d\n\nAt its January meeting, the association encouraged libraries to consider dropping the fees, saying they \u201cpresent an economic barrier to access of library materials and services.\u201d\n\nBaltimore\u2019s Enoch Pratt Free Library last year eliminated fines on overdue books and other materials. The Salt Lake City Public Library System stopped charging the fees July 2017 and that same year, libraries in Columbus, Ohio and Nashville, Tennessee, dropped them. The library in Broomfield, Colorado, went fine-free Jan. 1, and Oakland, California, public libraries followed suit in July.\n\nOther libraries have scratched late fees for children, who often depend on adults to help return books, or offer amnesty days when borrowers can bring back late materials without sanction.\n\nThe campaign for fee forgiveness also comes as libraries struggle to stay relevant amid the flood of e-books and other new forms of digital entertainment.\n\nLibraries around the U.S. have added e-books and digital movies to their stacks of traditional books with paper pages, and now offer access to computers for people who don\u2019t have their own for work and school assignments, and spaces where people can study and hold meetings.\n\nPhoenix library spokesman Lee Franklin said research doesn\u2019t show overdue fines encourage borrowers to return materials faster. But she said studies do show the fees \u201cdisproportionately affect people with lower incomes, creating a financial burden.\u201d\n\nFranklin said the Phoenix libraries get about $200,000, or less than 1% of its annual operating budget, from overdue fines. She said much of that loss will be offset with an extra $170,000 annually from the Maricopa County Library District that Phoenix belongs to.\n\nThe Phoenix system is still working on an exact date in November the new policy will take effect for its 1 million accounts, Franklin said. Phoenix libraries will keep charging borrowers the full replacement cost of lost or damaged materials.\n\n\u201cWe do want our materials back,\u201d Franklin said, \u201cbut we also want to remove shame and blame for returning them late.\u201d\n\nAfter the measure passed Tuesday, Councilman Michael Nowakowski noted that many Phoenix families depend on city libraries for computer access and other educational resources.\n\nBut Councilman Carlos Garcia said many people in south Phoenix\u2019s working class neighborhoods have stopped borrowing books and other materials because of the possibility of fines they can\u2019t afford.\n\n\u201cI hope moving from punitive practices continues to be a trend for programs in our city to make them more inclusive for all,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nFollow Anita Snow: http://twitter.com/asnowreports .\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Phoenix residents with overdue library books might want to wait a bit before bringing back their borrowed copies of the current best sellers.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Anita Snow"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/13/forgiving_overdue_book_fines_41596_c0-150-3000-1899_s1770x1032.jpg?166a3c9ee4c5161046c06ad50c13cb3ed6ce9265", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
