Now, they are largely limited to people arrested almost immediately after crossing the Mexican border.\n\nU.S. District Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, ruling late Friday in Washington, said the administration\u2019s expansion of \u201cexpedited removal\u201d authority violated procedural requirements to first seek public comment and ignored flaws in how it has been used on a smaller scale at the border. The shortcomings, which were not challenged by government lawyers, include allegations that some people entitled to be in the country were targeted for deportation, translators weren\u2019t provided, and authorities made \u201cegregious errors\u201d recording statements of migrants who said they feared persecution or torture if sent back to their homelands.\n\n\u201cWith respect to the policy at issue here, the potential devastation is so obvious that (the Department of Homeland Security) can be fairly faulted for its unexplained failure to predict, and attempt to mitigate, the fully foreseeable future floods,\u201d Jackson wrote.\n\nJackson, an appointee of President Barack Obama, hasn\u2019t ruled on merits of the case, but her decision prevents the administration from expanding fast-track authority nationwide while the lawsuit proceeds.\n\nEarlier Friday, a federal judge in Los Angeles blocked new rules that would allow the government to detain immigrant children with their parents indefinitely, saying the move conflicted with a 1997 settlement agreement that requires the release of children caught on the border as quickly as possible to relatives in the U.S. and says they can only be held in facilities licensed by a state. The Flores agreement \u2014 named for a teenage plaintiff \u2014 will remain in place and govern conditions for children in custody, including those with their parents.\n\nAlso Friday, another federal judge in Los Angeles blocked U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement from relying solely on flawed databases to target people for being in the country illegally. The decision affects detainers issued by an ICE officer in the federal court system\u2019s Central District of California.\n\nThe fast-track deportation powers were created under a 1996 law but didn\u2019t become a major piece of border enforcement until 2004, when Homeland Security said it would be enforced for people who are arrested within two weeks of entering the U.S. by land and caught within 100 miles (160 kilometers) of the border. Defenders say it relieves burdens on immigration judges \u2014 their backlog of cases recently topped 1 million \u2014 while critics say it grants too much power to Border Patrol agents and other immigration enforcement officials and jeopardizes rights to fair treatment.\n\nKeven McAleenan, the acting Homeland Security secretary, said in July that U.S. authorities don\u2019t have space to detain \u201cthe vast majority\u201d of people arrested on the border, leading to the release of hundreds of thousands with notices to appear in court. He said expanded authority would likely cause illegal entries to decline and result in people getting more quickly removed from the country than in immigration courts, where cases can take years to resolve.\n\nThe Justice Department said Saturday that the judge overstepped her authority and undermined laws enacted by Congress with careful consideration by the administration on how to enforce them. The White House echoed that view in a statement and added that the administration has been trying since its inception to enforce immigration laws and that \u201cmisguided lower court decisions have been preventing those laws from ever being enforced_at immense cost to the whole country.\u201d\n\nThe potential impact of expanding fast-track powers is difficult to predict. McAleenan said in July that 20,570 people arrested in the nation\u2019s interior from October 2017 through September 2018 had been in the U.S. less than two years, which would make them subject to the new rule. Critics say the impact could be more far-reaching because many in the U.S for longer than two years may be unable to prove they have been in the country that long.\n\n\u201cThe court rejected the Trump administration\u2019s illegal attempt to remove hundreds of thousands of people from the U.S. without any legal recourse,\u201d said American Civil Liberties Union attorney Anand Balakrishnan, who argued the case on behalf of Make the Road New York and other advocacy groups. \u201cThis ruling recognizes the irreparable harm of this policy.\u201d\n\nThe administration\u2019s setbacks followed two recent victories for its immigration policies at the Supreme Court, one allowing diversion of Defense Department money to build a border wall and another denying asylum to anyone who enters the country at the Mexican border after passing through another country and not applying there.", "description": "A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration\u2019s move to vastly extend authority of immigration officers to deport people without allowing them to...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS265_deport_ZG_20190929160838.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
