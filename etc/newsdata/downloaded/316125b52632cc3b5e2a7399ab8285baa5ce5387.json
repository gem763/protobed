Throughout his career in the Senate, which began shortly after the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on Roe, Biden stuck to a moderate\u2019s line: While he understood that abortion may need to be legal, he felt personally uncomfortable with it, he said. He consistently voted for the Hyde Amendment, which prevents the federal government from paying for most abortions through its public programs.\n\nAfter facing significant criticism on the campaign trail this year, however, Biden reversed his position, saying he would work to repeal the Hyde Amendment as president. On the debate stage last night, he reaffirmed his new stance, calling for the legislative codification of the principles laid out in Roe. \u201cThe public is already there,\u201d he said. \u201cThings have changed.\u201d\n\nBiden also vowed to campaign against legislators in states such as Ohio and Alabama, which have passed restrictive abortion laws. \u201cReproductive rights are a constitutional right, and, in fact, every woman should have that right,\u201d he said. Notably missing from his impassioned answer, however, was the word abortion. Other candidates\u2019 answers followed directly in this spirit, diverging little on matters of policy.\n\nThe big exception was Gabbard. \u201cI agree with Hillary Clinton on one thing,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the 1990s, when Bill Clinton was president and she said abortion should be safe, legal, and rare, I think she\u2019s correct.\u201d As a presidential candidate, of course, Hillary Clinton effectively reversed this position, all but embracing abortion up until the end of pregnancy.\n\nLast night, Gabbard defied the rest of the Democratic field, arguing that there should be restrictions in place.\n\n\u201cI support codifying Roe v. Wade while making sure that during the third trimester, abortion is not an option unless the life or severe health consequences of the woman are at risk,\u201d she said.\n\nLeana Wen, the recently ousted president and CEO of Planned Parenthood, cheered Gabbard\u2019s answer. It was \u201ccourageous\u201d of Gabbard \u201cto bring up nuances,\u201d Wen tweeted. \u201cMost Americans hold complex truths: they can both personally oppose abortion & support others\u2019 right to choose; they can both feel uncomfortable about abortion & not want women to die from back-alley procedures.\u201d\n\nGabbard\u2019s views line up with the American public\u2019s much more closely than the rest of the Democratic candidates\u2019 do. Two-thirds of Americans have consistently told Gallup that they believe third-trimester abortions should generally be illegal, outside of dangerous medical situations. Democratic voters are far more likely than Republican voters to say that abortion should be legal in all or most cases, but even those voters are split on whether there should be some legal limits on the procedure, according to the Pew Research Center.", "description": "The 2020 Democratic presidential candidates have gone further in embracing abortion rights than ever before.
