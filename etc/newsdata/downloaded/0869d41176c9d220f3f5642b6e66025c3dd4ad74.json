He missed most of September with right elbow inflammation. And he knew right away that this injury was serious. He wanted to stay in for the rest of the inning, so he finished the last 10 pitches before walking off, but afterward he talked to Manager Dave Martinez.\n\nSuzuki wanted to hit, but the pain overwhelmed him and he decided he \u201cwould be doing a disservice to the team\u201d if he continued. The Nationals pinch-hit Gerardo Parra, and Parra struck out as the Nationals zoomed toward a 4-1 Game 3 loss which sliced their World Series lead to 2-1. The team replaced him with Yan Gomes in the seventh. Martinez later told reporters Suzuki might get an MRI, but he cautioned he wouldn\u2019t know more until Saturday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt was one of those things where you try to fight through it, but I just wouldn\u2019t \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t have been helping the team,\u201d Suzuki said. \u201cSo ... \u201d he trailed off.\n\nWhen asked how he felt in the moment, he frowned and appeared to be in discomfort.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how I feel tomorrow.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals consider Suzuki an invaluable piece. He struggled at the plate this postseason until, in Game 2, he rocketed a home run off Astros starter Justin Verlander which sparked a six-run seventh inning and broke the game open. The struggles returned in Game 3, when he struck out in each of his only two at-bats. But his real value lies in handling the rotation. He\u2019s the personal catcher for Game 3 starter An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez as well as ace Max Scherzer, who\u2019s lined up to start Game 5. Scherzer raved this season about the veteran catcher\u2019s game-calling ability, and his numbers with Suzuki (99 2/3 innings, 2.08 ERA) compared favorable to Gomes (72 2/3, 4.09).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe only grin Suzuki flashed in the clubhouse after Game 3 was a rueful one when he pointed out the injury happened at a fortunate time because lined up to start Saturday\u2019s Game 4 is Patrick Corbin, who has Gomes as his personal catcher.\n\nSuzuki tried to stay hopeful. The results of his manual tests with trainers came back positive. His recovery window had a small buffer. This is the first time he\u2019s ever hurt his hip flexor.\n\n\u201cA lot of first times this year,\u201d he joked about injuries.\n\nBut the catcher\u2019s words didn\u2019t reflect his expression. He maintained upbeat words while his expression didn\u2019t change. He understood the stakes. This was his team\u2019s first World Series and they needed him.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou try to stay positive,\u201d Suzuki said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you can wait until the next series. You got to come back as soon as you can.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD", "description": "The Washington Nationals catcher, highly valued by Max Scherzer and An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez, appeared in discomfort in the clubhouse after the game.", "authors": ["Sam Fortier", "Sports Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/6ZMs6hqkJc34E9IubYfPXdoZxUg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/L3Q7ZAXVIEI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
