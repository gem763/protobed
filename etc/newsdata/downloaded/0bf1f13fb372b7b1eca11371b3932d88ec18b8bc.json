We have the great currency, power, and balance sheet.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe morning message marked the first time the president has publicly suggested negative interest rates, a step the U.S. has never taken but has been implemented in Japan and some European nations. Such a move would likely exhaust much of the Federal Reserve's firepower to fight a future recession at a time when the U.S. economy is still growing.\n\nTrump continued his rant in another post, writing online: \u201cThe USA should always be paying the the lowest rate. No Inflation! It is only the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve that doesn\u2019t allow us to do what other countries are already doing. A once in a lifetime opportunity that we are missing because of \u2018Boneheads.\u2019\u201d\n\nTrump has leveled increasingly harsh broadsides against his handpicked Federal Reserve chief in recent weeks, as Powell has declined to explicitly commit to the campaign of aggressive rate cuts the president has sought.\n\nAfter Powell pledged last month that the Federal Reserve would \u201cact as appropriate\u201d to support the record-long U.S. economic expansion, but did not hint at an imminent reduction in rates, Trump savaged the chairman on Twitter \u2014 pondering whether Powell or China\u2019s communist leader Xi Jinping was America\u2019s \u201cbigger enemy.\u201d\n\nTrump, who has maintained he has \u201cthe right to fire\u201d Powell, expressed regret last week over his decision in November 2017 to nominate him as chairman, tweeting: \u201cWhere did I find this guy Jerome? Oh well, you can\u2019t win them all!\u201d Powell said in July he would not leave his post if the president attempted to oust him.\n\nTrump has also complained about U.S. interest rates in relation to those of other countries, claiming that fellow heads of government at last month\u2019s G-7 summit in Biarritz, France, were indeed \u201cgiddy\u201d about their interest costs, and charging that the Federal Reserve \u201ccannot \u2018mentally\u2019 keep up with the competition\u201d abroad.\n\nTrump\u2019s intense criticisms of the Fed chairman come as the U.S. economy stares down financial warning signs indicating a possible recession, but Powell said last week the central bank is \u201cnot forecasting or expecting\u201d such a crisis.\n\nVictoria Guida contributed to this report.", "description": "The president's tweets marked the first time he has publicly suggested negative interest rates.", "authors": ["Quint Forgey"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/70/cd/006def7d4bd3855cdf42ae9b9766/190911-trump-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
