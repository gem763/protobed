(Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nPresident Trump said Monday that some state Republican parties are opting out of holding presidential nominating contests because they \u201cdon\u2019t want to waste their money,\u201d sidestepping the issue of whether the trend makes it more difficult for his three GOP challengers to rack up delegates.\n\nIn an exchange with reporters outside the White House late Monday afternoon, Trump said he has \u201cnothing to do with\u201d the decision by several state parties to cancel their primaries and caucuses.\n\nEarlier Monday, the Arizona Republican Party became the latest to do so, following on the heels of the state parties in South Carolina, Kansas and Nevada.\n\n\u201cThose four states don\u2019t want to waste their money,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHaving primary campaigns and having a primary election is very expensive.\u201d\n\nSome state parties have previously called off their primaries and caucuses in past elections when an incumbent is running for reelection.\n\nTrump faces three challengers for the Republican presidential nomination \u2014 former Illinois congressman Joe Walsh, former South Carolina congressman Mark Sanford and former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld.\n\nThe president argued that \u201cif there was a race,\u201d state parties would \u201ccertainly want\u201d to hold primaries and caucuses. But he dismissed his competitors, noting that polling shows them barely registering among likely Republican voters.\n\n\u201cLook, the three people are a total joke. They\u2019re a joke. They\u2019re a laughingstock,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s overall approval rating is underwater, he remains immensely popular among the Republican base. A Monmouth University poll last month showed that 84 percent of Republicans approve of the president\u2019s job performance.\n\nIn his remarks to reporters, Trump did not clarify whether he was speaking about taxpayers or state Republican parties bearing the costs of presidential primaries and caucuses.\n\nThe responsibility for the cost of early presidential nominating contests varies from state to state.\n\nIn South Carolina, for instance, the state pays the costs of holding a primary, while in Arizona, the state reimburses counties a certain amount per active voter, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nNevada and Kansas typically choose their presidential nominees through caucuses, which are organized and paid for by the state party.\n\nA Nevada Republican Party spokesman told CBS News that the state party would save as much as $150,000 by canceling its 2020 caucuses.\n\nTrump\u2019s challengers, naturally, are not enthused by the disappearance of some state nominating contests this cycle.\n\n\u201cCanceled primaries?\u201d Weld tweeted Sunday. \u201cWhat are you afraid of, Mr. No-Show? Intelligent, experienced, honest and decent competitors? Now more than ever, @realDonaldTrump, you can run but you cannot hide.\u201d", "description": "In an exchange with reporters, the president sidestepped the issue of whether the trend denies his three GOP challengers the chance to rack up delegates.", "authors": ["Felicia Sonmez", "National Reporter On The Washington Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/L2puTwInpJW4-551s7mA0GX-4ok=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DLDQY2WTHYI6TBVMB4SQZSIXLA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
