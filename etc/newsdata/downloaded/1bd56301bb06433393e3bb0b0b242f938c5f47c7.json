But in the end, it was Donatella Versace who won the week with her Friday night slot.\n\nHere are key takeaways from the Spring-Summer 2020 event.\n\nThe moment\n\nRevisiting one of her own most significant fashion contributions, Versace had J.Lo ignite the runway in a remake of the jungle green dress the singer wore to the 2000 Grammys.\n\nAt the time, so many people searched images of the garment that Google was inspired to create Google Image Search.\n\nAt the end of her show, which riffed heavily off the green palm print so synonymous with that gown, Versace's voice came over the sound system: \"OK Google, now show me the real jungle dress.\"\n\nJennifer Lopez walked the runway at the Versace show during Milan Fashion Week Spring-Summer 2020.
