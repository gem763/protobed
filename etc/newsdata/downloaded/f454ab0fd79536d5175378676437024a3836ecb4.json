During all this, the Mumbai government decided to cut 2,702 trees to build a metro 3-car shed in Aarey colony. This decision has left the country furious and the BMC received over 82,0900 objections to this proposal by the Mumbai Metrorail Corporation Limited.\n\nDeforestation/ tree felling leads to serious consequences which can and will irreversibly damage the environment. Here are some facts about the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Deforestation leads to loss of oxygen and the Aarey tree fellings will lead to a loss of 16 lakh kilograms of oxygen per year.\n\nTrees are our main source of oxygen and on an average, a tree produces almost 120 kilograms of oxygen per year. Cutting down more than two thousand trees is going to heavily impact the oxygen levels of the areas surrounding the Aarey colony. The people will lose out on almost 16 lakh kilograms of oxygen per year and will be at risk for dire respiratory health issues.\n\nReuters\n\n2. Air pollution levels drastically increase and lead to respiratory diseases.\n\nAbsence of trees leads to a tremendous rise in air pollution levels which pose a serious threat to the residents of the city. Breathing problems like asthma are a common occurrence in cities which lack trees and young children are at the highest risk of developing these problems.\n\nDon't Miss 461 SHARES 509 SHARES 342 SHARES 26.2 K SHARES 3.3 K SHARES\n\nReuters\n\n3. Extinction of wildlife takes place due to deforestation and 3 species have gone extinct in the last one year.\n\nWildlife is disappearing at an alarming rate due to deforestation and the planet cannot afford to have another species added to its list of extinct animals. Felling of trees rids animals of their habitats and takes away their only source of food.\n\nReuters\n\n4. Desertification is increasing at an alarming rate, affecting the livelihood of animals and human beings.\n\nFelling of trees leads to extreme soil erosion and that leads to an increase in desert areas. Desert areas are on a significant rise and this will interfere with the earth\u2019s natural vegetation.\n\nReuters\n\n5. Deforestation leads to an increase in air pollutants which damage the ozone layer.\n\nThe ozone layer is the earth's guard against harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun and is made up of mass of oxygen or O3 atoms. Oxygen reacts with carbon monoxide and an increase in the latter will interfere with the layer's stability. Carbon monoxide particles going up in the atmosphere will lead to a decline in oxygen.\n\nReuters\n\n6. 2016 was the warmest year recorded due to global warming and deforestation will only make the crisis worse.\n\nTrees play a vital role in preventing global warming. Trees control greenhouse gases from infiltrating the environment but deforestation leads to the complete opposite and is a hazard to this planet.\n\nReuters\n\n7. Water resources depletion is another impact of deforestation and Delhi is already predicted to run out of groundwater by 2020.\n\nTrees provide water-filtering since their roots help in maintaining ground stability. Lack of trees ruins the local water system and the increase in soil erosion contaminates the groundwater. This further interferes with the availability of water which can be used for several purposes.\n\nReuters\n\nIf the impact of taking such a harmful step is something the whole world is aware of, why is the planet still suffering? The world does not need another crisis. We already are in one.", "description": "Deforestation/ tree felling leads to serious consequences which can and will irreversibly damage the environment.
