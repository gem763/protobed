He was the founder and leader of ISIS, the most ruthless and violent terror organization anywhere in the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe died after running into a dead-end tunnel, whimpering and crying and screaming all the way,\u201d Trump said, describing the raid as \u201cabsolutely perfect.\u201d\n\nWhile most of the nation was celebrating, Lee-Curtis appeared less than impressed, pointing out the suffering endured by those in warfare that Trump has never experienced.\n\n\u201cHe may have died a coward @realDonaldTrump but ALL living things suffer when they are blown up. Anyone who has experienced warfare, unlike yourself, would know that,\u201d she wrote on Twitter. \u201cWar is brutal. Dogs are brave, bold, loyal, loving and healing.\u201d\n\nHe may have died a coward @realDonaldTrump but ALL living things suffer when they are blown up. Anyone who has experienced warfare, unlike yourself, would know that. War is brutal. Dogs are brave, bold, loyal, loving and healing. \u2014 Jamie Lee Curtis (@jamieleecurtis) October 27, 2019\n\nThe phrase \u201cDie Like a Dog\u201d may seem counterintuitive given that most canines die peacefully of natural causes. However, The Free Dictionary notes that its origins began in Ancient Greece, where dying like a dog was worse than a typical death \u201cbecause it signified being left unburied, a fate regarded with dread.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the 60-year-old \u201cScream Queen\u201d has never been one to dish out praise to the current president. Last year, she admitted that she is \u201cscared every day\u201d by life in America under the Trump adminstration.\n\n\u201cYou know, life\u2019s a little scary. I live in America,\u201d she told an audience at the Toronto Film Festival. \u201cThis (expletive\u2019s) getting real, so I\u2019m scared every day.\u201d\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "Jamie Lee Curtis unloaded on President Donald Trump following the death of Islamic State leader\u00a0Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/02/JamieLee1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
