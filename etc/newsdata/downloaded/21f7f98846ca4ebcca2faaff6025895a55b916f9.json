That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying, and we\u2019re waiting to see it,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar, Minnesota Democrat, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day.\u201d\n\nMs. Warren, who has risen to the top of some recent polls on the 2020 Democratic presidential field, found herself on the receiving end of such critiques from candidates like Ms. Klobuchar and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, at Tuesday\u2019s debate.\n\nThe Massachusetts senator has been evasive on whether the middle class would have to pay more in taxes under her universal health care plan.\n\nMs. Klobuchar said Ms. Warren has been implying that people with different approaches aren\u2019t \u201cfighting\u201d for things.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fighting \u2014 I just think I have a better way,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said. \u201cI like her. I think she is really bringing something strong [to] this discussion \u2014 that is for sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t like the implication that just because you have different ideas of how to reduce the prices of pharmaceuticals, or how to bring down the cost[s] of college, that somehow those ideas aren\u2019t good enough,\u201d she said. \u201cI think they\u2019re just different ideas, and I\u2019m fighting for those just as hard as she is.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
