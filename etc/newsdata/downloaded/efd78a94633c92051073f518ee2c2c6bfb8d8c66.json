While the measure is likely to pass the House, a veto is expected \u2014 and Wednesday\u2019s tally showed there are more than enough Republicans ready to sustain Mr. Trump.\n\nDemocrats cast the vote as another legislative black eye for Mr. Trump, with nearly a dozen Republicans joining in the rebuke.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about Republicans and Democrats,\u201d said Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat. \u201cThis is about checks and balances, not about Republicans and Democrats, and the need for the Senate to rein in an out-of-control executive.\u201d\n\nThe vote was a do-over. Congress held a similar vote in March, after Mr. Trump, furious that Congress approved only $1.375 billion in its 2019 spending bills for wall construction, declared a border emergency and said he would siphon nearly $7 billion from other accounts to use for the wall.\n\nBoth the House and Senate voted to overturn the emergency, but Mr. Trump issued a veto and it was sustained, allowing him to begin tapping some Pentagon money Congress had designated for drug interdiction.\n\nWeeks ago the Defense Department announced it was also digging into military construction funds and would halt more than 100 projects across the globe to use that money for more wall.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 campaign committee has gleefully pointed to projects that will be halted in vulnerable GOP senators\u2019 states, hoping to build pressure on Republicans to buck the president.\n\nSen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican up for re-election next year, said she has backed border wall money in the past, but said she was voting to end Mr. Trump\u2019s emergency declaration to make a statement about checks and balances.\n\n\u201cI cannot support the president unilaterally deciding to take money that has been appropriated for one purpose and diverting those billions of dollars for another purpose, no matter how important or worthy that goal may be,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, supported Mr. Trump and said Democrats were creating a false choice between defense spending and border wall money.\n\n\u201cThe only reason there\u2019s any trade-off is that Democrats have refused to work with the president,\u201d Mr. McConnell said.\n\nHe said Congress could easily backfill the money Mr. Trump wants to siphon from the military, so that the Pentagon can keep its projects on schedule and the president can get his wall money.\n\nThe Senate will vote later Wednesday on a non-binding measure to do just that.\n\n\u201cEven my Democratic colleagues who don\u2019t support the administration\u2019s border security agenda should not take out their frustration on our armed forces,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cEvery single member of this body should be able to support the measure to fully fund military construction.\u201d\n\nFat chance, said Sen. Patrick Leahy, Vermont Democrat, adding that he expects even if Congress did back-fill the money, the administration would just grab it again, siphoning it away for another round of wall-building.\n\n\u201cMr. President, I believe you said Mexico was going to pay for your wall, not our troops, not their families, and not future generations of American citizens,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
