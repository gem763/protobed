France have woken up to modern rugby and sculpted this side around the flair of Clermont Auvergne and Toulouse, the two best teams in the Top 14 last year. They have started to look more the French sides of the late 80s and 90s, with willingness to play from anywhere. Argentina showed their attacking ability at the last World Cup, and the Jaguares have played some of the most entertaining rugby in the world in the last few years. There should be tries... Argentina made some interesting decisions when naming their squad, opting to stick with largely home-based players who have grown together in the environment, and leaving out two of their better individuals. Facundo Isa and Santiago Cordero will be missed, but this is a cohesive side that has been built at club level, with the Jaguares reaching the Super Rugby final this year. Mario Ledesma has done a solid job since taking over from Daniel Hourcade, and Los Pumas challenged all three of the Southern Hemisphere heavyweights in the Rugby Championship this summer. You'd make them favourites, just about, but it'll be interesting to see how these two teams go. France are odd. They've an odd coaching situation, with next head coach Fabien Galthie brought into the group for this tournament before taking over from Jacques Brunel afterwards, and they continuously make odd selection decisions, like seemingly settling on Camille Lopez at ten ahead of the tournament but ditching him for this opener in favour of Romain Ntamack, who barely started for Toulouse at the pointy end of the Top 14 season, and when he did it tended to be at 12.\n\nThey've also left out their most destructive runner in Fijian-born wing Alivereti Raka. Odd. This is a particularly intriguing game. Both have had relatively strong warm-up campaigns, but are flawed sides, and may well be competing for second spot behind England in Pool C. Advertisement TEAM NEWS - Argentina Argentina also had a choice to make at fly-half, coincidentally between two players who ply their trade in France. Benjamin Urdapilleta's silky skills looked to be the coming force, but it is Nicolas Sanchez who retains the starter's shirt. The strength of Los Pumas is, perhaps, the back five of the pack, with athleticism, power and grit aplenty. Pablo Matera leads from the blindside, while ubiquitous former captain Agustin Creevy will add his leadership from hooker. TEAM NEWS - France Romain Ntamack has won the battle for the French ten jersey over Camille Lopez, and will have to contend with a new look midfield outside him, with Wesley Fofana's injury (shocker!) meaning Virimi Vakatawa slips into the inside centre berth. There has been a restructuring up front, too - Arthur Iturria slides one row up to start at lock, a position he is more than comfortable at, with Charles Ollivon and Wenceslas Lauret on the flanks. Greogry Alldritt is preferred to Louis Picamoles at number eight. We'll bring you Jack De Menezes' report from Australia-Fiji in Sapporo later, but for now we will switch attentions to today's second game - it's France vs Argentina. This could, quite literally, go anywhere and everywhere, with two of the more mercurial sides in rugby getting their tournaments underway. Let's check in on the team news... Advertisement The World Cup has properly begun, now, you feel, after a sloppy opening affair in Tokyo yesterday. Fiji and Australia's clash was open and pulsating, and I've a sneaking suspicion France and Argentina might just throw caution to the wind in the heat at Tokyo Stadium. Still New Zealand against South Africa to come today, of course. What a day! It was a real scare for Australia, with Fiji leading 21-12 early in the second half, but Michael Cheika's side have accelerated away from the Fijians in the final quarter, and in the end it looks rather comfortable for the Wallabies - 39-21 is how it has finished in Sapporo. Good morning morning. It's Super Saturday in Japan, three of the tournament's very best group stage games scheduled back-to-back-to-back for the rugby world's viewing pleasure. Australia have been given a scare against Fiji, and once business is concluded in Sapporo we'll be switching our focus back to the capital, with Tokyo Stadium playing host to France and Argentina, competitors to England in Pool C. Welcome to The Independent's live coverage of the Rugby World Cup Pool C clash between France and Argentina, brought to you from the Tokyo Stadium. With kick-off scheduled for 8:15am back in the UK, we'll begin our full build-up to the match from 7:15am.
