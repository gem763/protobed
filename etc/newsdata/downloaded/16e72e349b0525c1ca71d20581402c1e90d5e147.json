Compared with a year ago, production declined 0.1 percent.\n\nThe production numbers largely confirmed the contraction in the manufacturing sector signaled by surveys such as the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s Purchasing Managers Index and regional Fed surveys.\n\nSomewhat softening the blow, the weaker September numbers followed a strong report for August. Both the overall production and the manufacturing figures were revised up in August, indicating that some of the production expected in September had already occurred.\n\nMotor vehicle production fell 4.2 percent compared with a month earlier, highlighting the drag from the General Motors strike. Mining fell a steep 1.3 percent, a decline that probably also weighed on factory production because mining operations require factory-made equipment.\n\nPerhaps more troubling for the broader economy is the decline in business equipment production, down 0.7 percent for the month and 0.8 percent on the year. Sluggish business investment has been one of the major factors giving rise to fears that the economy could slip into recession next year or the year after that.", "description": "Overall industrial production declined in September following strong growth in August, driven down by the GM strike.| Economy", "authors": ["John Carney"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/01/0c9778_united-auto-workers-on-strike-gm-weeks-prompting-furloughs-facilities-e1570406513517-638x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
