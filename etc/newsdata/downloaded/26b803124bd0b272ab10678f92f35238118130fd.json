PSG coach Thomas Tuchel paid the price for heavily rotating his lineup against a mid-table opponent.\n\nRachid Alioui scored from a free kick in the 88th minute and then again in the fifth minute of stoppage time for Angers, which is the surprise of the season in France.\n\nLille is in third place, two points behind the top two, after winning 2-0 at home to Strasbourg. Nantes remained tied on points with Lille thanks to a 1-0 home win over Rennes, the other side to beat PSG this season.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Paris Saint-Germain slumped to its first home defeat in the French league in 16 months by losing 2-0 to Reims on Wednesday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/25/france_soccer_league_one_02799_c0-138-3293-2057_s1770x1032.jpg?0f2ae1ee26c233d571ba0f1674e0fd6702df20e3", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
