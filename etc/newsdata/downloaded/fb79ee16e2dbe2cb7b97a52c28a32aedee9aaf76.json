Forests across the Southwest are using a mix of logging, mechanical thinning and prescribed burns to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires that threaten the Mexican spotted owl and its habitat.\n\nU.S. District Judge Raner Collins said the U.S. Forest Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service have shirked their responsibility to count the Mexican spotted owl as part of a recovery plan and no longer can use budget concerns as an excuse.\n\n\u201cDefendants have had over 20 years to find a workable way to monitor MSO occupancy to measure progress towards delisting\u201d as a threatened species, Collins wrote.\n\nKent Reid, director of the New Mexico Forest and Watershed Restoration Institute at New Mexico Highlands University, said he wants to see the injunction lifted or more narrowly tailored to exclude projects such as forest thinning.\n\nEven then, he said companies that cut trees on national forests through logging or restoration contracts could see business decline to the point of closing if the injunction stays in place long.\n\nThe Santa Fe, New Mexico-based WildEarth Guardians alleged in a 2013 lawsuit that U.S. wildlife managers failed to consider the impacts on the owls from widespread thinning and logging and had not done their jobs in tracking the bird\u2019s numbers.\n\nThe dark-eyed Mexican spotted owl is one of the largest owl species in North America. It nests and forages in steep canyons and in old-growth forests with thick, multi-layered canopies.\n\nIt was listed as a threatened species in the U.S. in 1993 and is found in Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, parts of west Texas and Mexico but not uniformly.\n\nA 2012 Fish and Wildlife recovery plan estimated the number of owl sites, known as protected activity centers, at more than 1,300 and said the total has increased over the years. Collins said that doesn\u2019t mean the owl population has grown.\n\n\u201cWhether or not the population is stable or drastically declining or increasing in one place and declining in another is totally speculative at this point,\u201d said John Horning, executive director of WildEarth Guardians.\n\nThe Forest Service\u2019s Southwestern Region said it is complying with the order and \u201cis committed to our continued efforts at recovering the Mexican spotted owl.\u201d The Fish and Wildlife Service declined comment on the court order, citing ongoing litigation.\n\nThe order issued Sept. 11 doesn\u2019t define timber management activities, other than to say they cause irreparable harm and include timber harvesting.\n\nHorning said forest restoration projects in the Gila National Forest on the Arizona-New Mexico border, and on the Lincoln National Forest near Cloudcroft, New Mexico, could be halted. Permits for Christmas trees and firewood likely wouldn\u2019t be impacted.\n\nThe court said Fish and Wildlife and the Forest Service must consult formally about what projects affect the owls and their habitat. The Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s website said that could take up to three months, then it would have 45 days to issue a new biological opinion.\n\nThe Fish and Wildlife Service said Thursday it\u2019s working with the Forest Service on a pilot project to evaluate trends in the owl population based on occupancy monitoring, but it doesn\u2019t have a strategy or funding to do the work across the owl\u2019s entire range.\n\nWildEarth Guardians had asked for an injunction on all 11 national forests in Arizona and New Mexico, but the court earlier this year ruled the request moot for a handful of Arizona forests that had updated biological opinions since 2012.\n\nThe order covers Lincoln, Santa Fe, Cibola, Carson and Gila national forests in New Mexico, and Tonto National Forest in central Arizona.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A U.S. judge has halted tree-cutting activities across thousands of square miles of the Southwest until federal agencies can get a better handle on how to monitor the population of a threatened owl.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Felicia Fonseca"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/19/threatened_owl_timber_projects_56347_c0-177-2000-1343_s1770x1032.jpg?92efc0d6b405c4f2ced30083e11265d3f66dffb4", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
