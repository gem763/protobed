He's very disappointed in himself, embarrassed. He's apologized to his team, our AD.\n\n\"That's way out of character for who he is. He's gotta own it and learn from it. But very pleased with how he's taken ownership and been accountable. But he had a long bus ride home last night, plenty of time to think about it.\"\n\nBooth threw the punch at Louisville's Trenell Troutman after Troutman was covering a punt. Booth wrestled Troutman to the ground before taking a swing.\n\nTV audio caught Swinney apologizing to Louisville coach Scott Satterfield on the field after the game.\n\nBooth has three tackles this season.
