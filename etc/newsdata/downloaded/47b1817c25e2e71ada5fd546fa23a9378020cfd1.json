The house had been cordoned off while police attended to the scene.\n\nSpokesperson of the Benoni SAPS, Captain Nomsa Sekele, confirmed that the identity of the person whose remains it is, is still unknown. She says investigations are still underway.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve opened an inquest and we\u2019re waiting for the forensic report. That could take up to six weeks,\u201d Captain Sekele says.\n\nAn unidentified neighbour told Benoni City Times that she hadn\u2019t seen the occupant of the house for over two years, which piqued her suspicions.\n\nAnother neighbour who didn\u2019t want to be named told the local newspaper that the occupant of the house was a traditional healer.\n\n\u201cThe resident was well known, so we all became suspicious when we stopped seeing the resident.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s been no confirmation that the remains belong to the occupant of the house.", "description": "It\u2019s believed the skeletal remains have been there for over two years.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9095/52d442b8829a4d9d9cc4400ce833fec3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-10"}
