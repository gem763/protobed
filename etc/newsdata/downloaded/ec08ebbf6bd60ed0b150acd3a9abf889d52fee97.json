The show aired from 1979 until 1984.\n\nROBERT WAGNER GETS CANDID ABOUT HIS STAR-STUDDED LOVE LIFE AND SECRET AFFAIR WITH A HOLLYWOOD STAR\n\n\u201cWe chose to be together,\u201d Powers, 76, told The Daily Mail about her on-screen marriage to Wagner, 89.\n\n\u201cWe loved each other,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe adored everything about each other \u2014 I\u2019m talking about Jonathan and Jennifer\u2026 It was a fantasy. An escapist romantic comedy adventure. We just had to keep that bubble in the air\u2026 You didn\u2019t have to worry about bad language or X-rated [scenes]. The whole family enjoyed it.\u201d\n\nThe outlet shared that the show\u2019s creators originally wanted Wagner\u2019s wife, Natalie Wood, to appear in their series. But Wagner, who previously worked with Powers, felt she was the best choice for the role.\n\n\u201cIt was not an overnight success, but once people discovered us, it took off,\u201d said Powers. \u201cI remember the screams of fans when we won the People\u2019s Choice Awards [in 1980] and we suddenly realized: \u2018Oh my God, they really like us!\u2019\u201d\n\nJAMIE LEE CURTIS HONORS DAD TONY CURTIS ON 9TH ANNIVERSARY OF HIS DEATH\n\nPowers also shared that she and Wagner have remained very close long after the series came to an end.\n\n\u201cWe can push each other\u2019s buttons today,\u201d she said. \u201cWe laugh all the time.\u201d\n\nThe actress reveals that while Wagner lives in Aspen with his wife, Bond girl Jill St. John, they still reach out to Powers whenever they\u2019re in Beverly Hills.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s coming in next week, so we\u2019ll get together,\u201d said Powers.\n\nBURT REYNOLDS\u2019 PALS REMEMBER \u2018SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT\u2019 STAR A YEAR AFTER HIS DEATH: \u2018HE ALWAYS HAD YOUR BACK\u2019\n\nThe star also insisted that while some fans have long believed she and Wagner were really a couple, they have a completely different kind of relationships.\n\n\u201cSiblings who really like each other,\u201d she clarified. \u201cWhen we were working together, sometimes we would get into laughing fits and they\u2019d have to send us home. In the context of what our personal relationship actually is, that is actually hysterical.\u201d\n\nStill, Powers admitted there was something special about the chemistry she shared with Wagner when cameras were rolling.\n\n\u201cIf I knew what the ingredients were, I would bottle it and make a fortune,\u201d she said.\n\nJUDY GARLAND\u2019S DAUGHTER LORNA LUFT SAYS SHE ISN\u2019T WATCHING NEW BIOPIC: \u2018I HAVE TO PROTECT HER LEGACY\u2019\n\nAccording to the outlet, both stars were involved in relationships when \u201cHart to Hart\u201d went on the air. While Wagner was married to Wood, Powers was in a relationship with William Holden.\n\nIn November 1981 both Wood and Holden died. The \u201cRebel Without a Cause\u201d actress drowned at age 43 while she was on a weekend sailing trip with Wagner. Holden, a known alcoholic, was found dead in his home at age 63 after tripping and gashing his head.\n\nPowers is aware that there continues to be speculation surrounding Wood\u2019s death. In 2018, Wagner was named \u201ca person of interest\u201d by authorities investigating her passing. A rep for Wagner slammed Wood\u2019s younger sister Lana Wood and boat captain Dennis Davern for accusing the actor of being involved in the death of his movie star wife.\n\n\u201cThey are despicable human beings, capitalizing on the accidental death of a beloved member of the Wagner family,\u201d Wagner\u2019s rep told Fox News. \u201cThey should be ashamed of themselves.\u201d\n\nLUCILLE BALL ENDURED RUTHLESS CRITICISM ON \u2018LIFE WITH LUCY,\u2019 SAYS CO-STAR: \u2018THEY WERE SO BLOODY\u2019\n\nIn response to the allegations, Powers said: \u201cThere are people who, whenever they can, try to make some money off of selling the story. I\u2019m sure it gets to [Wagner].\u201d\n\nPowers admitted the sudden passings that occurred that fateful November was difficult to cope with.\n\n\u201cThat was a very, very tragic period,\u201d said a tearful Powers.\n\nThe show, however, had to go on.\n\n'ROOM 222' STAR KAREN VALENTINE RECALLS 'AWFUL' ENCOUNTER AFTER 'THE DATING GAME'\n\n\u201cWe had an obligation,\u201d she said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have much choice.\u201d\n\nPowers said she and Wagner relied on each other to make sense of the double tragedy.\n\n\u201cWe were very close anyway,\u201d she explained. \u201cWe held each other up.\u201d\n\nThe outlet revealed that at the time of Holden\u2019s death, he and Powers had separated but still kept in close contact. They were previously together for nine years.\n\n\u2018BUCK ROGERS\u2019 STAR ERIN GRAY SAYS SHE WAS INITIALLY \u2018SCARED TO DEATH\u2019 OF PLAYING COL. WILMA DEERING\n\n\u201cThe middle seven years were brilliant,\u201d she reflected. \u201cThey were bookended [by alcoholism]. Alcohol was his mistress. It was inevitable that something bad was going to happen.\u201d\n\nToday, Powers said she\u2019s still proud of her time playing Jennifer Hart and what it offered her both professionally and personally.\n\n\u201cAn awful lot of people still hold that show very dearly,\u201d she said. \u201cMy contractor said he was channel-surfing last night and he found \u2018Hart to Hart.\u2019 He said, \u2018I was transfixed. It gave me the nicest nostalgic feeling.\u2019 I thought, \u2018Isn\u2019t that lovely.\u2019\u201d\n\nDespite the loyal fan following \u201cHart to Hart\u201d still has, Powers couldn\u2019t imagine what the show would be like today.\n\nEDIE ADAMS\u2019 SON EXPLAINS WHY HER LATE HUSBAND ERNIE KOVACS IS SEEMINGLY FORGOTTEN IN HOLLYWOOD\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think RJ [Wagner] would be interested in running after villains now \u2014 unless he had a power-wheelchair,\u201d she chuckled. \u201cBut we\u2019d still be together. And it would still be a liability to be a friend of ours!\u201d\n\nIn 2010, the Los Angeles Times reported Powers released an autobiography titled \u201cOne From the Hart\u201d where she opened up about her affair with Holden that lasted nearly a decade and her friendship with Wagner.\n\nAt the time, Powers said she hoped the book would set the record straight on Holden.\n\n\u201cThere was another book about Bill that had \u2018direct\u2019 quotes from people that I know the author could never have gotten because they were dead by the time he wrote the book,\u201d she told the outlet. \u201cI thought, 'son of a gun, all that has ever been written about Bill is going to remain the standard by which everybody judges him. Maybe I should write down the truth \u2014 the truth about our relationship and the truth about him as I saw it and put him in the light, not the light of a knight in shining armor but in the light of what the real man was.'\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nPowers also shared the secret behind her show\u2019s lasting success.\n\n\u201cIt came at the right time,\u201d she said. \u201cIt proselytized a kind of romance and relationship that really were ideal. They were two people who didn\u2019t have to qualify their relationship and didn\u2019t seem to have to in any way sacrifice anything in order to be together. They were on equal footing, and they regarded each other as partners in everything they did.\u201d", "description": "Stefanie Powers still has fond memories of working alongside Robert Wagner.", "authors": ["Stephanie Nolasco"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-93765692.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
