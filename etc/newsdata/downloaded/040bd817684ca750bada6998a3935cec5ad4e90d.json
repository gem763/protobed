For now, a solid labour market is keeping the economy on a moderate growth path.\n\nThe raft of weak data could prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates again this month to keep the longest economic expansion in history, now in its 11th year, on track. The U.S. central bank cut rates last month after reducing borrowing costs in July for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis.\n\n\u201cThis downturn is starting to spread and that means the tea leaf readers at the Fed are going to be teeing up a third rate cut this year when they next meet again at the end of this month,\u201d said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.\n\nThe ISM said its non-manufacturing activity index fell to a reading of 52.6 in September, the lowest since August 2016, from 56.4 in August. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index falling to 55.1 in September.\n\nThe ISM reported on Tuesday that its measure of national manufacturing activity plunged in September to its lowest level since June 2009, when the Great Recession was ending.\n\nIt said services industry businesses \u201care mostly concerned about tariffs, labour resources and the direction of the economy.\u201d The ISM said 13 industries, including public administration, and finance and insurance, reported growth last month. Educational services and other services reported a contraction.\n\nThe dollar fell against a basket of currencies on the services industry data, while U.S. Treasury prices rallied. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher on expectations of a rate cut this month.\n\nSeptember\u2019s drop in services sector activity reflected declines in measures of production and new orders, which tumbled 6.6 points to a reading of 53.7, a three-year low. But order backlogs increased as did new bookings for exports, offering hope that activity in the sector could rebound.\n\nA gauge of services industry employment fell to 50.4 last month, the lowest reading since February 2014, from 53.1 in August. The ISM said some businesses reported that the \u201cnumber of new employees starting to level off,\u201d and others said \u201ctightening workforce is leading to a more competitive market for qualified potential employees.\u201d\n\nThis together with a sharp decline in the ISM\u2019s measure of manufacturing employment to more than a 3-1/2-year low last month bolstered economists\u2019 expectations that the government\u2019s closely watched employment report on Friday would show another month of moderate job growth in September.\n\nFILE PHOTO: People shop at Macy's Department store in New York City, U.S., March 11, 2019.

Job gains have averaged 158,000 per month this year, still above the roughly 100,000 needed each month to keep up with growth in the working-age population.\n\nThe unemployment rate is forecast unchanged at 3.7% for a fourth straight month in September.\n\nSOLID LABOUR MARKET\n\nSlowing job growth could curb consumer spending, which has been the economy\u2019s main growth engine.\n\n\u201cYes, the economy is slowing,\u201d said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors, in Holland, Pennsylvania. \u201cNo, it is not in recession and there is no reason to believe it will go into the red this year.\u201d\n\nThe weak manufacturing and services sector surveys have prompted economists to slash their gross domestic product growth estimates for the third quarter to as low as a 1.3% annualised rate from as high as a 2.1% pace. The economy grew at a 2.0% pace in the second quarter, slowing from a 3.1% rate in the January-March period.\n\nIn addition to the U.S.-China trade war, which is pressuring business investment, the economy is also losing momentum as the stimulus from last year\u2019s $1.5 trillion tax cut package fades.\n\nDespite the deterioration in the ISM employment measures and also signs that employers are becoming cautious about hiring more workers, layoffs remain low.\n\nIn a separate report on Thursday, the Labour Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 219,000 for the week ended Sept. 28.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast claims increasing to 215,000 in the latest week. Claims have now advanced for three straight weeks.\n\nSome of the rise in claims could be the result of an ongoing strike by workers at General Motors. While striking workers are not eligible for unemployment benefits, the work stoppage has affected production, impacting non-striking employees at suppliers. There was a jump in manufacturing claims in Michigan during the week ended Sept. 21.\n\nFILE PHOTO: People wait in line to attend TechFair LA, a technology job fair, in Los Angeles, California, U.S., January 26, 2017.
