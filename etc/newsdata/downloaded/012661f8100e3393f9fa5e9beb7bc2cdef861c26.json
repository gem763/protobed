Confident that the crime would remain a secret, the Saudis initially affected innocence. \u201cWe have nothing to hide,\u201d bin Salman told Bloomberg the day after the killing, adding that the Turks were welcome to search the consulate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut within days, Erdogan\u2019s press aide Fahrettin Altun, considered Turkey\u2019s \u201csecond most powerful man,\u201d began leaking the details of what had actually happened. Initially, the information was vague. On October 6, for example, three days after the murder, the New York Times reported that \u201cTurkish investigators believe a well-known Saudi dissident was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, five people involved in the investigation, or briefed on it, said on Saturday.\u201d\n\nThree days later, this suggestion had hardened to \u201c[an] official described a quick and complex operation in which Mr. Khashoggi was killed within two hours of his arrival at the consulate by a team of Saudi agents, who dismembered his body with a bone saw they brought for the purpose. \u2018It is like \u2018Pulp Fiction,\u2019 the official said.\u201d\n\nThe bylined reporters, David Kirkpatrick and Carlotta Gall, felt constrained to add, \u201cIt remains unclear how the Turkish government determined that Mr. Khashoggi had been killed.\u201d\n\nAs international outrage over alleged Saudi behavior mounted, Donald Trump, the ultimate target of the Turkish leak campaign, reacted, saying on October 15 that Turkey was being \u201ctough, very tough.\u201d Clearly, Erdogan saw an opening in which to force a break between Trump and MBS by reducing the feckless Saudi\u2019s name to mud in Washington. (The two Islamic leaders are bitter rivals in the battle for influence in the Middle East.)\n\nTwo days later, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo paid a hurried visit to Istanbul just as the Times relayed another damning leak: not only had Khashoggi been chopped up, the Turks had irrefutable proof in the form of audio recordings from bugs inside the consulate, which they obligingly played for CIA chief Gina Haspel (she knows Turkey well, having previously served there in an undercover role).\n\nErdogan then upped the ante, demanding that the Saudi government \u201clay bare all perpetrators from top to bottom and hold them accountable before the law\u201d and for the \u201cexecution team\u201d to be extradited to Turkey. As Bulent Alireza of the Center for Strategic and International Studies explained, Erdogan\u2019s goal was \u201cto try to force the Trump administration, which had been backing MBS without any apparent reservation prior to the murder as a key partner in its Middle East plans, to review its relationship with him. Lacking significant direct leverage over Riyadh, Erdogan hoped to induce pressure by Trump\u2014inconceivable before Khashoggi\u2019s murder\u2014to either force MBS out or to weaken him into ineffectiveness.\u201d\n\nBut despite the proof furnished by the recordings, Trump still stuck by his Saudi friends, who, as he would later declare, \u201cpay in cash.\u201d\n\nHowever, a review of the copious leaks makes one thing clear: Erdogan himself may very well have been just as guilty of the monstrous crime of Khashoggi\u2019s murder as Mohammed bin Salman and his team of killers. As is evident from the now extensive record of leaked recording transcripts, Turkish security followed the planning, as well as the execution, of Khashoggi\u2019s murder over the course of several days\u2014almost certainly in real time.\n\nFollowing Khashoggi\u2019s first visit to the consulate on September 28 to request legal documents in connection with his divorce, officials there discussed a \u201ctop secret mission\u201d with senior security officials close to the prince\u2019s office in Riyadh. Such discussions continued until October 2. On that day, the hidden microphones picked up the murder team discussing the mechanics of dismembering the soon-to-be victim. At the end of the conversation, one of them asks whether the \u201canimal to be sacrificed\u201d has arrived. At 1:14 p.m., another member of the hit squad says, \u201c[he] is here.\u201d The last minutes of Khashoggi\u2019s life are then chillingly replayed.\n\nGiven Khashoggi\u2019s prominence as a journalist and close relations with the Turkish regime at its highest levels, the operative question is surely: what did Erdogan know about the murder plan and when did he know it? If Turkish intelligence was keeping him informed, why was Khashoggi allowed to be \u201csacrificed?\u201d Could it be that the Turks might have prevented this grisly nightmare but chose not to for geopolitical purposes?\n\nIf so, as one close observer of these events said to me, \u201cHow cynical is that?\u201d\n\nAndrew Cockburn is the Washington editor of Harper\u2019s Magazine and the author of five nonfiction books, including Kill Chain: The Rise of the High-Tech Assassins (2016).
