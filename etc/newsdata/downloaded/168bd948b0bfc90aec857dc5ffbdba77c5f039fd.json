We are sick of being unemployed and living in garbage.\"\n\nThe UPM, together with other civil society organisations, filed its court application in February, calling for the dissolution of the local council. The organisations argue that the council has violated sections 151 and 152 of the Constitution, by failing to \"ensure the provision of services to communities in a sustainable manner\".\n\nThe application accused Makana Municipality of corruption, failure to provide water and sewerage services, and serious neglect of municipal infrastructure, leaving roads filled with potholes and garbage.\n\nJudge Igna Stretch reserved judgment.", "description": "The Unemployed People's Movement (UPM) wants the Makana Municipal Council to be dissolved for violating its constitutional mandate by failing to provide basic services to the community.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5240/dd076652579b4869a79587c69b815492.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
