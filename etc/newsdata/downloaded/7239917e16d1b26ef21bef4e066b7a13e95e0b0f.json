But new data from the JP Morgan Chase Institute says you may only need to have six weeks \u2014 or about three paychecks \u2014 worth saved.\n\nHowever, the research also showed that 65% of families studied didn't have that much in combined savings and checkings.\n\nTo build up that emergency cushion, save when you have an income spike, so you can hit pause when it dips. Take advantage of three paycheck months to put more into savings, and be careful when it comes to handling your tax refund.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nThe good news is that stretching to fund a six-month emergency cushion might be unnecessary. The bad news is that many of us don't even have six weeks' worth saved.\n\nHow big of an emergency cushion is enough? How many months do you need to have \u2014 in liquid, easy-to-access cash \u2014 in case you lose a job, become ill or injured, or have some other life event that makes it impossible to work in the short term? The standard wisdom has long been three to six months' worth of expenses. My rule has been three for dual income families (figuring one earner will likely stay in the workforce while the other is out) and six for one income families (where there isn't another earner to take over). But as it turns out, both numbers may be excessive \u2014 and there is some new data from the JP Morgan Chase Institute to prove it.\n\nChase has 40 million account customers; of them, six million use their checking and/or savings accounts as their primary accounts. It's the account their paychecks are deposited into, and from which they pay their bills, explained economist Fiona Grieg, the Institute's Director of Consumer Research. Those six million accounts were the ones studied, and what came to light was that every five and a half years, on average, these folks experienced an income dip at the same time they had an expenditure spike \u2014 in other words, something happened to force them to tap into whatever emergency funds they had on hand.\n\n\"In order to weather that event, people needed six-weeks worth of take-home income, or about three paychecks worth,\" Grieg said, adding that the six-week number was consistent among families of very different incomes.\n\nUnfortunately, the research also revealed what other studies on saving have shown \u2014 65% of families didn't have enough in checking and savings combined to weather the storm. But thankfully, it also shed some light on what many of them could do to get there.", "description": "You don't actually need six months' worth of emergency savings.
