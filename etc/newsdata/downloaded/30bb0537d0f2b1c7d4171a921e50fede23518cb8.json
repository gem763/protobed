REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach\n\nIt is part of global efforts to clean up markets after banks were fined $9 billion (7.33 billion pounds) for trying to manipulate the London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor, and its variants to boost their trading positions.\n\nDubbed the world\u2019s most important number, Libor is an interest rate based on quotes from banks on how much it would cost to borrow money from each other. It is a price reference for derivatives to home loans and credit cards worth over $300 trillion globally.\n\nAttempts by banks to rig the 50-year old benchmark denominated in sterling, yen, Swiss franc, dollar and euro, prompted central banks to come up with their own \u201crisk free\u201d or harder-to-rig alternatives.\n\nWidespread use of Libor is set to end by December 2021 in Britain and the United States. The euro zone is taking a more hybrid approach.\n\nU.S. and UK markets already use central bank alternatives for new derivatives contracts, bonds and loans. But switching to the new rates in outstanding contracts will be a massive exercise, costing $300 million to $400 million for big banks. Britain alone has an estimated 200,000 Libor-linked mortgages.\n\nWHAT IS ESTR?\n\nEstr is compiled by the European Central Bank. After a pilot, the ECB will formally publish it for the first time on Oct. 2, reflecting trading on Oct. 1.\n\nIt is based entirely on daily money market transactions, rather than the quotes from banks used in the Libor stable of benchmarks. Transactions can be traced to verified market activity, making Estr harder to rig.\n\nIt will replace Eonia, or euro overnight index average, which is referenced in derivatives contracts worth a notional 22 trillion euros.\n\nEonia was based on quotes from banks, but from Tuesday it is redefined as the Estr rate plus a fixed spread 8.5 basis points. It will be discontinued at the end of 2021.\n\nIS THIS THE SAME AS EURIBOR?\n\nNo. Estr is for short-term contracts. The separate Euribor benchmark, created in 1999 when the euro was introduced, is for contracts that stretch from a week to 12 months.\n\nDerivatives contracts worth over 100 trillion euros reference Euribor, which is based on quotes from banks. Debt securities based on Euribor total about 1.6 trillion euros.\n\nA reformulation of Euribor was approved by Belgian regulators in July for use in the European Union, described as an important step towards the durability of the benchmark.\n\nWHAT ARE OTHERS DOING?\n\nThe euro zone is playing catch-up with other countries.\n\nThe Federal Reserve began daily publication of its secured overnight financing rate, or Sofr, in April 2018, based on daily trades worth around $800 billion.\n\nThe Bank of England took over an industry-compiled sterling overnight index average, or Sonia, revamped it and began calculating and publishing the rate in April 2018.\n\nThe Swiss franc-denominated Libor is set to be replaced by the Swiss average rate overnight, or Saron, administered by the SIX Exchange.\n\nThe Bank of Japan\u2019s Tokyo Overnight Average Rate, Tonar, is set to replace yen Libor. A separate Tibor \u2014 Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate \u2014 compiled by Japanese banks is expected to continue in a reformed version alongside Tonar.\n\nJOB DONE THEN?\n\nFar from it.\n\nCentral banks want faster take-up of the new rates to avoid a large pile of financial contracts still referencing benchmarks from the Libor stable at the end of 2021.\n\nUsing the \u201crisk free\u201d rates for new contracts is the easy bit. Banks are making changes, but their customers need prompting in some cases.\n\nThe new rates are backward-looking overnight benchmarks, unlike Libor, which has \u201cterms\u201d or variants stretching months and years into the future to underpin loans, bonds and derivatives.\n\nComing up with \u201cterms\u201d to complement overnight rates that don\u2019t significantly alter a contract\u2019s value is a challenge. Industry is looking how to compound or bolt on a top-up rate to the overnight rate to mimic Libor\u2019s forward terms.\n\nMarkets also need fallbacks, a plan for what would happen to contracts if regulators suddenly deemed Libor no longer safe to use.\n\nWhat happens to the inevitable hard core of \u201clegacy\u201d contracts that won\u2019t get shifted to a new rate by the end of 2021? Regulators are thinking hard about that.", "description": "The European Central Bank starts publishing Estr, its new interest rate benchmark, on Wednesday, in the biggest change for market plumbing since the introduction of the euro two decades ago.", "authors": ["Huw Jones", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435861019&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF902GW", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
