Nicholas Haining, vice president of discovery oncology at Merck Research Laboratories; Dr. Alexander Mason, an associate professor of immunology at the University of California San Francisco; and E. John Wherry, a professor of systems immunology at the University of Pennsylvania, began to talk about the current state of the art in cancer diagnostics and therapies and the technologies powering cell-based therapies to potentially cure cancer.\n\nParker suggested that rather than have each of these researchers spin their technologies out into separate companies that would develop one discrete innovation that would be needed to get to a cell-based therapy for solid tumors, the researchers should combine forces and build an arsenal of tools for the discovery and development of potential cures.\n\n\u201cI look at this as a tour de force of a combination of bringing academics together who typically would start separate companies and get them working together with a dream team management team,\u201d says Beth Seidenberg, the founder of Westlake Village BioPartners and an investor in ArsenalBio.\n\nIndeed, the management team is just as impressive as the researchers behind the project. Kleiner Perkins founding partner, Brooke Byers recruited Dr. Ken Drazan to serve as a consultant to the company as it was getitng off the ground Drazan, now the company\u2019s chief executive, was the former President of the cancer research and diagnostics startup Grail has served as an executive and founder at a number of healthcare startups and large medical companies.\n\nWith Drazan on board, the company quickly recruited the rest of the management team. Jane Grogan, the former principal scientist in charge of adaptive tumor and cell therapy at Genentech; Michael Kalos, the former vice president of immuno-oncology and cell therapies at Janssen Oncology; and Tarjei Mikkelsen, the former vice president of biology at 10x Genomics.\n\nArsenalBio initially formed as a shell company with seed financing from investors in 2018, basically on the back of its technical team and nascent executive staff.\n\nAlongside the powerhouse executive team and scientific founders, ArsenalBio has now raked in $85 million in financing from investors including Westlake Village, the PICI, Kleiner Perkins, the Unversity of California, San Francisco Foundation Investment Company, Euclidean Capital and Osage Venture Partners.\n\nThe idea is to improve the ability of T cell therapies to fight a broader range of cancers more effectively. T cell treatments have already shown amazing promise with certain types of cancer, but have not been able to effectively treat the solid tumors that represent the deadliest manifestation of the disease.\n\nTo tackle solid tumors like sarcomas, carcinomas, and lymphomas doctors need to figure out how to deliver the T cells first to the area around the tumor and then to the right tissues where the tumor is spreading. That requires a set of biological instructions which in many cases have yet to be discovered.\n\n\u201cWe need to get the cells to deal with the tumor microenvironment,\u201d says Seidenberg.\n\nT cells are the human body\u2019s natural response to fighting off infections and disease. Cancers essentially turn off that natural immune response by signaling to the cells that a tumor is actually something they should ignore rather than attack.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to program [cells] by delivering additional instructions to tell the T cell to ignore the instructions from the tumor\u2026 to ignore the signals,\u201d says Drazan.\n\nThe company is still developing its first product strategies now, Drazan says. But ArsenalBio will be selling two different types of technologies. The first will be the medicines themselves that will be used to cure certain types of cancer. The second will be the sequences of genes that can be used to counteract or override the signals that are coming from different types of tumors which prohibit T cells from performing their normal functions.\n\nDrazan compared those sequences to programs on Github that other researchers, clinicians and companies could use to develop their own therapies.\n\n\u201cArsenalBio allows us to rewrite vast stretches of code to give T cells dramatic new functions\u2013that means they can be made to be more effective at killing cancer and a broad spectrum of other diseases,\u201d said Sean Parker, founder and Chairman of PICI and ArsenalBio director, in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s also very rewarding to see ArsenalBio born from the deep collaboration of PICI investigators\u2014who worked together across research centers, hospitals and universities on the science behind these technologies. The company\u2019s very existence demonstrates how much faster and better we can get therapies from bench to bedside when we collaborate and put patients first.\u201d", "description": "The story behind ArsenalBio begins with Sean Parker\u2019s Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy.
