The last time Pittsburgh scored five goals in a period came on Jan. 16, 2017 against Washington.\n\nThe Penguins\u2018 Evgeni Malkin left in the second period and did not return with an undisclosed injury. He ran into D Kris Letang near center ice and awkwardly fell into the boards. Malkin, the 2012 NHL MVP, scored a power-play goal in the season-opening loss Thursday against Buffalo.\n\nMcCann tied a career high with three points. The other time came as a member of the Florida Panthers when he had a goal and two assists on March 20, 2018. McCann scored two goals once with Pittsburgh on March 23 last season against Dallas.\n\nPatric Hornqvist scored twice and Letang had a power-play goal, while Teddy Blueger and Marcus Pettersson also scored for Pittsburgh. Alex Galchenyuk, acquired from Arizona in a trade for Phil Kessel, recorded two assists for his first two points with Pittsburgh. Sidney Crosby also had two assists.\n\nMatt Murray made 28 saves and is now two wins from 100 in his NHL career.\n\nGustav Nyquist scored his first goal for Columbus and Zach Werenski scored for the Blue Jackets, who lost their second game in as many days. Columbus lost its season-opener 4-1 to Toronto at home. Elvis Merzlikins stopped 31 shots in his NHL debut.\n\nPittsburgh opened the scoring at 1:45 of the second when Hornqvist tipped Jack Johnson\u2019s point shot past Merzlikins. The Penguins took a 2-0 lead 2:29 later when Pettersson\u2019s shot from the top of the left circle caromed off Merzlikins\u2019 glove and behind the line.\n\nNot long after Pittsburgh\u2019s second goal, Werenski was left alone at the right side of the crease and cut the Blue Jackets\u2019 deficit in half.\n\nBut the Penguins regained their two-goal cushion, 3-1, two minutes later when McCann sent a blocker-side wrist shot behind Merzlikins during a two-on-one.\n\nMcCann scored his second of the game 14 seconds after a fighting major to Crosby. McCann took a backhand pass from Galchenyuk at the blueline and sent another blocker-side wrist shot past Merzlikins.\n\nLetang scored Pittsburgh\u2019s fifth goal of the second period with 1.2 seconds to play. He beat Merzlikins with a slap shot from the right faceoff dot.\n\nNOTES: Crosby passed Larry Murphy for sole possession of 42nd-place on the NHL\u2019s all-time points list with 1,218. \u2026 Werenski, with 39 goals, is two from the Blue Jackets\u2019 record for most by a defenseman. \u2026 Murray has nine wins in 12 games all-time against Columbus. \u2026 Pittsburgh has won eight straight home games against Columbus and 16 of 20 all-time. \u2026 The Penguins have won eight of their last 10 games against Columbus. \u2026 Brandon Tanev and Dominik Kahun, acquired in the offseason, recorded their first points with Pittsburgh.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBlue Jackets: Host Buffalo on Monday\n\nPenguins: Continue a season-opening four-game homestand Tuesday against Winnipeg.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jared McCann scored twice as the Pittsburgh Penguins had five goals in the second period to beat the Columbus Blue Jackets 7-2 on Saturday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dan Scifo"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/05/blue_jackets_penguins_hockey_06353_c0-142-3390-2118_s1770x1032.jpg?14cf148400b293caf8685ce655c67c75b785cb37", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
