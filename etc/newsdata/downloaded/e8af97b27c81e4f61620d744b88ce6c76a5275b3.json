The status granted depends on how long they have been living in the UK. The government states that people's rights will be different depending on which status they get.\n\nGuidelines state applicants will usually get settled status if they\u2019ve lived in the UK for a continuous five-year period. Pre-settled status will be granted to those who have not lived in the UK for five years, or cannot demonstrate that they meet this requirement.\n\nThe government states that both settled and pre-settled status confer the right to:\n\nWork in the UK.\n\nUse the NHS.\n\nEnrol in education or continue studying.\n\nAccess benefits and pensions.\n\nTravel in and out of the UK.\n\nThere are some significant differences though. Those with settled status will be allowed to stay in the UK as long as they like, and can spend up to five years in a row outside the UK without losing their status.\n\nThose with pre-settled status are allowed to stay in the UK for a further five years, which would allow them to apply to convert it into settled status. Those with pre-settled status can spend up to two years in a row outside the UK without losing their pre-settled status.\n\nThe status granted also affects any children people might have. With settled status, any children born in the UK will automatically be British citizens. With pre-settled status, the child would be born with pre-settled status, unless it qualified for British citizenship directly through one of the parents.\n\nThe deadline for applying is 30 June 2021, or 31 December 2020 if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. Irish citizens, or those who already have indefinite leave to remain, do not need to apply.\n\nMartin Belam", "description": "Threat of no-deal Brexit on 31 October prompts rush of applications for settled status", "authors": ["Lisa O'Carroll"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b39240d0a906000f93864072729d21635a4db296/0_38_4639_2785/master/4639.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=84d984ac859bb785bab7bbdac007d594", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
