In some moments, it comes across like a tribute to Wes Anderson, all Rushmore eccentricity and meticulous aesthetics. Gwyneth Paltrow, Margot Tenenbaum herself, plays Georgina Hobart, Payton\u2019s mother, who wears jewel-toned caftans and is conducting a wistful love affair with her horse trainer (played, absurdly, by Martina Navratilova). Bob Balaban (Moonrise Kingdom, The Grand Budapest Hotel) is Payton\u2019s father, who collects first editions and tries to leap to his death from a window above a $6 million Chippendale commode when he discovers Georgina\u2019s infidelity. Julia Schlaepfer plays Alice, Payton\u2019s girlfriend, a kind of Margot-lite with a severe blond bob and countless cashmere twinsets. (\u201cI\u2019m reducing,\u201d Alice says when offered a cupcake, as if she were a silent-era Gloria Swanson instead of a 2019 high-school senior.) There are pastel colors and lunk-like twins (Payton\u2019s brothers, Martin and Luther); there\u2019s also a pervasive sense of anachronistic whimsy.\n\nThis being a Ryan Murphy series, though, there\u2019s also a defiant kind of glibness, a reluctance to make space for emotional candor or psychological depth or even Andersonian melancholy. Suicide, murder, Munchausen by proxy, the violent impulses underlying toxic masculinity\u2014all of these subjects exist at eye level, but when you scratch the surface, there\u2019s nothing underneath. Characters state, rather than embody, their motivations. \u201cI\u2019m not a good person,\u201d Payton confesses to his school principal in one scene. \u201cThat\u2019s my flaw. I\u2019m ambitious, I\u2019m political, I\u2019m conniving.\u201d He\u2019s other things, too, Platt\u2019s soulful performance makes clear, but the show rarely gives him the space to reveal what they might be.\n\nThe subplots contain other elements of cultural imitation. Jessica Lange plays a grotesque grandmother inflicting unnecessary medical treatments on her granddaughter Infinity (Zoey Deutch) in exchange for free Olive Garden meals and trips to Busch Gardens, in a story that visually apes that of Dee Dee and Gypsy Rose. (Lange\u2019s performance, complete with dubious West Virginia accent, is high Grand Guignol compared with Patricia Arquette\u2019s Emmy-winning turn as Dee Dee in Hulu\u2019s The Act.) A story line in which Payton gets close to someone only for things to end in tragedy has thematic ties to the musical that made Platt famous and scored him a Tony, Dear Evan Hansen.\n\nSome of these scenes are more fun to watch than others. Platt, as an actor, is all heart, which makes his casting as the possibly sociopathic Payton seem like a strange choice. In reality, though, Platt is what holds The Politician together: His rubberized, animated face, his toothy smile, and his patrician manner humanize a character who otherwise could be disastrously robotic. Payton knew from the age of 7, he explains in his Harvard admissions interview, that he was going to be the American president one day. Virtually every word written for him involves a reiteration of this goal, and the necessity of everyone falling in line around it. \u201cDo not screw with my dream!\u201d he shouts. \u201cI\u2019m on a singular path \u2026 I will win at all costs. I know what my future\u2019s going to be and I know how to get there. And I will not be stopped.\u201d", "description": "Ryan Murphy\u2019s first show for Netflix is a sumptuous but glib study of high-school zeal.", "authors": ["Sophie Gilbert"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/Politician_101_Unit_02478_R/facebook.jpg?1569521735", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
