Reuters\n\nAt 432 Park Avenue, New York City's tallest completed residential building, the 95th-floor penthouse was originally listed for $82 million for the full floor, but it sat on the market for more than two years. In late 2018, the condo was split into two separate listings \u2014 penthouse 95A for $41.25 million and penthouse 95B for $40.75 million, as Curbed reported. One faces north and one faces south, but the layouts aren't much different.\n\nJust a few blocks away at 520 Park Avenue, developers split a 12,398-square-foot triplex penthouse, first listed in 2014 for a staggering $130 million, into two separate units: One simplex listed for $40 million and one duplex penthouse asking between $80 million and $100 million, according to The Real Deal.\n\nThe Real Deal pointed to this as part of a trend of \"developers opting to split once-massive penthouses into two or more smaller units.\"\n\nSplitting huge penthouses into smaller apartments often gets them off the market.\n\nIf past sales are any indication, this strategy might be a good one.\n\nA few months after being split into two separate listings, the $82 million penthouse at 432 Park Avenue finally sold as two apartments: for $30.7 million and $30.2 million respectively.\n\nAnd back in 2016, a 12,000-square-foot, $80 million penthouse at 160 Leroy Street in the West Village was split into two smaller units: One asking $31.5 million and the other $48.5 million, according to Curbed. And it worked \u2014 the cheaper one sold in 2017 and Michael Rubin, part owner of Philadelphia's 76ers and the New Jersey Devils, bought the larger unit in 2018 for $43.5 million, Forbes reported.\n\nThat being said, the penthouse has not entirely lost its appeal, or its status, in 2019. Ken Griffin's $238 million purchase of the penthouse (floors 50 through 53) at 220 Central Park South shattered the US real-estate record in the first weeks of January. The record had previously been held by Barry Rosenstein's $137 million Hamptons home purchase in 2014.", "description": "Some real-estate developers are splitting NYC's penthouses into multiple smaller, cheaper units to get them off the market \u2014 and often, it works.", "authors": ["Katie Warren"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d6e92672e22af048c4259fa-2732-1366.jpg"}
