Photo: Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n\nA report from the inspector general of the Department of Justice about James Comey\u2019s handling of classified documents detailing his conversations with Donald Trump gave Comey what amounted to a sharp verbal reprimand. Conservatives had hoped the report would discredit the former FBI director and perhaps lead to his incarceration. Here\u2019s how the New York Times \u2014 beneficiaries of one key leak that led to the probe \u2014 characterized the findings:\n\nThe Justice Department inspector general released on Thursday a report that was highly critical of the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey\u2019s handling of memos detailing his interactions with the president, accusing him of setting \u201ca dangerous example\u201d for officials with access to government secrets.\n\nThe findings were the result of a lengthy investigation by Michael E. Horowitz, the inspector general, who examined whether Mr. Comey had acted inappropriately when he gave one of the memos to a confidant who later provided its contents to The New York Times. Mr. Comey has said he helped make the information public in part to bring about the appointment of a special counsel.\n\n\u201cComey violated F.B.I. policy and the requirements of his F.B.I. employment agreement when he chose this path,\u201d the report said.\n\nBut because there was no intent to break laws, the report suggests, the DOJ decided against prosecuting Comey.\n\nIt\u2019s one of those situations that invites spin over the meaning of the report. The president and his allies are sure to gloat over the report\u2019s criticism of Comey, who has emerged as a bitter Trump critic as well as a devil figure for conservative conspiracy theorists who claim an elaborate deep state effort, centered in the FBI, to prevent Trump\u2019s election and then obstruct his agenda. Shortly before the OIG report\u2019s release, the president\u2019s favorite talking head, Sean Hannity, predicted big trouble for Comey:\n\n[W]e\u2019re also being told that the report \u2026 has referred Comey for federal prosecution for stealing government documents, leaking confidential government memos that detailed conversations with the president a clear violation of the Espionage Act.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s technically accurate, but the referral was definitely in the past, and led to the decision not to prosecute, which Comey himself is treating as a vindication:\n\nDOJ IG \"found no evidence that Comey or his attorneys released any of the classified information contained in any of the memos to members of the media.\" I don\u2019t need a public apology from those who defamed me, but a quick message with a \u201csorry we lied about you\u201d would be nice. \u2014 James Comey (@Comey) August 29, 2019\n\nIn the short term, what probably matters is that the rebuke of Comey will provide what Axios calls \u201cjet fuel for President Trump and allies determined to aggressively investigate the intelligence community\u2019s conduct.\u201d One of the president\u2019s top congressional allies and the ranking Republican on the House Oversight Committee, Jim Jordan, offered this immediate reaction:\n\nToday\u2019s report is a disappointing reminder that the former FBI Director put partisanship and personal ambition over patriotism and his legal obligations to the American people. By leaking his confidential communications with the President in an attempt to save face in the wake of his firing, Mr. Comey believed he was above the rules of the DOJ.\n\nYou can expect that conclusion to broaden into a more general condemnation of alleged Trump enemies in federal law enforcement. Stay tuned to the president\u2019s Twitter account to see how broad and deep and loud this use of the report will become.", "description": "A report from the Inspector General of the Department of Justice on former FBI director James Comey\u2019s handling of documents involving his interactions with the president harshly criticized him for breaking FBI rules\u2013but not enough to be prosecuted.", "authors": ["Ed Kilgore"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/08/29/29-james-comey-fbi.w1200.h630.jpg"}
