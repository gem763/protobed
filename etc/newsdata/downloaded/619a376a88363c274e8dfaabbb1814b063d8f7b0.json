For once, a British spokesman in Brussels echoed him: \u201cThere is still a significant amount of work to be done. Technical-level talks will continue tomorrow.\u201d\n\nLondon and Brussels are trying to achieve in a few days what they had failed to do in the more than three years since Britons first voted to leave the European Union after nearly 50 years \u2014 agree the terms of Britain\u2019s departure.\n\nOngoing technical talks are variously described as \u201cintense\u201d or \u201cconstructive\u201d, but no-one familiar with the closed-door process would point to progress on issues like Northern Ireland\u2019s place in or out of the EU customs zone.\n\n\u201cNo breakthrough yet. But the good news is: Intensive discussions continue,\u201d a European diplomat told AFP.\n\n\u201cOverall not an easy starting position and only a few days remain until the European Council. If the British government wants a solution, it must move quickly now. The clock is ticking.\u201d\n\nIn London, Downing Street said Johnson had told his cabinet to brace for a cliff-hanger finish.\n\nThe British leader said \u201ca pathway to a deal could be seen but that there is still a significant amount of work to get there and we must remain prepared to leave on October 31.\u201d\n\nJohnson rose to power in July on a promise not to extend Brexit for a third time this year \u2014 even for a few weeks.\n\nBreaking that pledge could come back to haunt him in an early general election that most predict for the coming months.\n\nBut, thanks to a law passed by rebel British MPs, Johnson is also under parliamentary orders to seek a extension until January 31 of next year if no deal emerges by Saturday.\n\nJohnson has promised to both follow the law and get Britain out by October 31 \u2014 a contradiction that might end up being settled in court.\n\nOutgoing European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker said British politics were getting more difficult to decipher than the riddle of an \u201cEgyptian sphinx\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf the British ask for more time, which they probably will not, it would in my view be a historical nonsense to refuse them,\u201d Juncker told Austria\u2019s Kurier newspaper.\n\n\u2013 Pressure from parliament \u2013\n\nIreland\u2019s Prime Minister Leo Varadkar hinted on Thursday that he could support the talks running up to the October 31 deadline if a deal seemed within reach.\n\nBritain will only avoid a chaotic breakup with its closest trading partners if the agreement is also passed by the UK parliament \u2014 something it has failed to do three times.\n\nJohnson heads a minority government and must rely on the full backing of not only his own fractured Conservatives but also Northern Ireland\u2019s small Democratic Unionist Party.\n\nDUP\u2019s parliamentary leader Nigel Dodds warned Johnson that \u201cNorthern Ireland must remain entirely in the customs union of the United Kingdom\u201d and not the EU.\n\n\u201cAnd Boris Johnson knows it very well,\u201d Dodds told Italy\u2019s La Repubblica newspaper.\n\nThe comments do not necessarily rule out DUP support.\n\nUK media are presenting Johnson\u2019s mooted compromise as a \u201cdouble customs\u201d plan that could be interpreted to mean that Northern Ireland is leaving EU rules.", "description": "London (United Kingdom) (AFP) \u2013 British and European negotiators on Sunday played down hopes of a rapid breakthrough in their last-ditch bid to", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/13/b1c634_britain-prime-minister-boris-johnson-brexit-by-31-is-absolutely-crucial-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
