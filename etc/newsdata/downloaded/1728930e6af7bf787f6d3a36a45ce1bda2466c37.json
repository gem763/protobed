[ECILT/EU]\n\nForward-looking indicators in the survey suggest there is no upside to those forecasts as overall demand fell at the fastest rate since mid-2013, leading firms to again run down backlogs of work to keep active. The composite new business index fell to 48.7 from 50.5.\n\nAs growth stalled, services firms cut back on hiring plans. The employment index fell to 53.0 from 53.2, its lowest since January.\n\n- Detailed PMI data are only available under licence from IHS Markit and customers need to apply for a licence.\n\nTo subscribe to the full data, click on the link below: here\n\nFor further information, please phone IHS Markit on +800 6275 4800 or email mailto:economics@ihsmarkit.com", "description": "Euro zone business growth stalled in September as an ongoing contraction in manufacturing activity is increasingly affecting the services industry, according to a survey which showed little chance of an improvement this month.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436592917&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF920PO"}
