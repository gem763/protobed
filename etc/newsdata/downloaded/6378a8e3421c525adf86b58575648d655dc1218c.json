Much of the harbour area appeared to be abandoned farmland just a year ago, according to earlier images CSIS analysed.\n\nIt dwarfs an existing harbour nearby, where destroyers and other warships are docked.\n\n\u201cWe can see slow but steady progress on the hull, but I think the really surprising thing these images show is the extensive infrastructure buildup that has gone on simultaneously,\u201d said CSIS analyst Matthew Funaiole.\n\n\u201cIt is hard to imagine all this is being done for just one ship,\u201d he added. \u201cThis looks more like a specialised space for carriers and or other larger vessels.\u201d\n\nSingapore-based military analyst Collin Koh said the modern, purpose-built facility on a sparsely populated island in the Yangtze may provide better security than the congested shipyards of Dalian in northern China. It could also help deepen co-operation between commercial and military shipbuilders.\n\nThe London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies noted this year that China\u2019s military shipyards were focusing increasingly on larger surface warships, \u201cadding to the sense that Chinese naval-capability development may be entering a new phase.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s navy has recently launched four large Type 055 cruisers and its first large helicopter carrier, known as the Type 075.\n\nChina\u2019s military has not formally announced the plans for the third carrier, designated Type 002, but official state media have said it is being built.\n\nThe Pentagon said it in its annual survey of China\u2019s military modernisation, published in May, that work on the third carrier had begun.\n\nChina\u2019s Ministry of Defence did not respond to questions from Reuters.\n\nFunaiole said the latest images appeared to confirm the earlier photos, which suggested the latest carrier would be somewhat smaller the 100,000-tonne \u201csupercarriers\u201d operated by the U.S. but larger than France\u2019s 42,500-tonne Charles de Gaulle.\n\nThe images are due to be released by the CSIS China Power Project later Thursday.\n\nAsian and Western militaries are tracking developments closely. They say this carrier would represent a vital step in China\u2019s ambitions to create a far-ranging navy that can project power around the world to serve Beijing\u2019s expanding global interests.\n\nA series of recent Reuters Special Reports showed how that effort is challenging decades of U.S. strategic superiority in East Asia.

U.S. carriers routinely deploy with nearly four times the number of aircraft.\n\nForeign military attaches and security analysts say the Type 001 ships are expected to essentially serve as training platforms for what they believe will be fleet of up to six operational carriers by 2030.\n\nThey say the construction and deployment of aircraft carriers is considered exceptionally difficult to master. Protecting such a large and vital surface target with escort ships, submarines and aircraft is a core part of the problem.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\n\u201cThe PLA navy is not saying much in detail about its plans now, but we can see from their building works that their ambitions are vast,\u201d said one Asian military attache, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter. \u201cAnd they will get there.\u201d\n\nKoh, a research fellow at Singapore\u2019s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, said the new Jiangnan facilities looked permanent and reflected China\u2019s long-held ambitions to bulk up its fleet with more carriers and other large vessels.\n\n\u201cWe are talking about infrastructure being built quickly and on a large scale. It could well be the start of a \u2018factory,\u2019 if you like, for carriers and other very large vessels,\u201d he said.", "description": "High-resolution satellite images show that the construction of China's first full-sized aircraft carrier is progressing steadily alongside expansive infrastructure work that analysts say suggests the ship will be the first of several large vessels produced at the site.", "authors": ["Greg Torode", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441768745&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G0G1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
