These are likely to become the navy's Z-20F and carry out anti-submarine duties.\n\nObservers noted similarities between the Z-20 and the Black Hawk in shape, layout and size, although the Chinese chopper has five rotor blades instead of four.\n\nChina bought 24 Black Hawks in 1984 for service in the plateau region and they are still in operation today.\n\nSong Zhongping, a military commentator in Hong Kong, said that despite similarities in appearance, the Z-20 has home-developed lift, transmission, flight control, and avionics systems, and should not be regarded as a copy of the US machine.\n\n\"The Z-20 is already much more advanced than those imported Black Hawks, although it might not be as mature as the latest Black Hawk variants,\" he said.\n\nChina has made aviation one of its key industries and has invested heavily in both military and civilian aircraft of all kinds, including fixed-wing, rotary, manned and unmanned technology.\n\nSong said the Z-20 was a significant improvement but had a problem plaguing Chinese aviation \u2013 a lack of powerful engines.\n\nChina's aviation engines were generally not as advanced as those built in other countries, Song said. \"This problem needs to be tackled from the ground up.\"\n\nVisitors to the four-day show were also treated to some unusual helicopter design concepts, including the flying saucer-like Super White Shark armed helicopter, and many rotary unmanned aerial vehicles.\n\nThe Super White Shark concept model was described as a two-seat turbojet stealth aircraft with a ceiling of 6,000 metres (19,685 feet), a top speed of 650km/h (404mph) and a range of 2,950km.\n\nAlthough the Super White Shark's developer \u2014 known as the Parrot Laboratory \u2014 claimed to have learned from designs such as the US's AH-64 Apache ground attack helicopter and Russia's Ka-52 reconnaissance and combat chopper, it said no country had yet succeeded in developing and perfecting such wing-body-fusion technology.", "description": "One analyst said that China's new Z-20 helicopter is a \"significant improvement\" over earlier models.", "authors": ["Liu Zhen", "South China Morning Post"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da867d04af909089c2697a4?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
