The American Medical Association recently reiterated its opposition to physician-assisted suicide as \u201cfundamentally incompatible with the physician\u2019s role as healer[.]\u201d\n\nThe AMA also clarified its terminology and recommended that the term \u201cphysician-assisted suicide\u201d continue to be used. Euphemisms like \u201cmedical aid-in-dying\u201d obfuscate the cold, hard reality: What is at stake here is suicide, plain and simple.\n\nThe AMA\u2019s action is a step in the right direction, but clearly insufficient to stem the rising tide of state laws.\n\nPolicymakers continue to play an important role in educating the public about the dangers of physician-assisted suicide and protecting the most vulnerable from this grave evil.\n\nSo, what\u2019s so wrong about physician-assisted suicide?\n\nPhysician-assisted suicide is antithetical to the practice of medicine. Medicine is supposed to be about promoting the well-being of the patient, not doing away with the patient.\n\nOnce physician-assisted suicide is on the table, doctors, families, and insurers encounter perverse incentives to end the lives of the most vulnerable\u2014the sick, the disabled, the very young, or very old.\n\nNo amount of superficial safeguards can prevent doctors and family members from pressuring their loved ones to prematurely end their lives.\n\nNone of the most common safeguards\u2014written consent, mandatory waiting periods, witnesses\u2014address the monetary incentives for insurance companiesto end the lives of patients who require more care (and therefore cost more).\n\nWhen physician-assisted suicide is an option, there are fewer incentives to pursue ethical alternatives in end-of-life care.\n\nPhysician-assisted suicide is not just a threat to individual patients. It is like Pandora\u2019s Box: Once it\u2019s open, it\u2019s nearly impossible to contain its negative effects.\n\nOnce our culture grants the premise of physician-assisted suicide\u2014that some lives are more valuable than others\u2014we begin our descent down a slippery slope.\n\nOther countries that have legalized physician-assisted suicide paint a dreary picture.\n\nIn Canada, as legislators contemplated expanding who qualified for physician-assisted suicide, Toronto\u2019s Hospital for Sick Children unveiled a plan to expand this practice to children, with or without parental consent.\n\nIn the Netherlands, where caretakers recently allowed a teenage girl to starve herself to death because of her trauma after several sexual assaults, there has been frequent abuse, including the non-voluntary euthanasia of patients.\n\nEven Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, one of the architects of Obamacare, noted in the Atlantic as far back as 1997, \u201c[T]he persistence of abuse and the violation of safeguards, despite publicity and condemnation, suggest that the feared consequences of legalization are exactly its inherent consequences (emphasis added).\u201d\n\nPhysician-assisted suicide leads to euthanasia practically by necessity.\n\nEveryone deserves to die with dignity, but physician-assisted suicide does not provide dignity. It undermines it. It treats life as disposable, and that ultimately jeopardizes the most vulnerable.\n\nPhysician-assisted suicide is a dangerous practice that creates victims out of patients to the detriment of all of society.\n\nThis new law in Maine is a mistake, for which we will pay dearly.\n\nThere is still time to change course, to move the conversation away from suicide and towards ethical alternatives for the terminally ill.\n\nThat conversation begins now.", "description": "Maine on Wednesday became the eighth state (plus the District of Columbia) to\u00a0legalize physician-assisted suicide\u2014a practice that turns medicine on its head.\u00a0\n\nInstead of promoting the health and wholeness of the patient, physician-assisted suicide promotes the dangerous idea that some lives are not worth living.\n\nThat message has far-reaching effects for the medical profession, familial relationships, and the culture.", "authors": ["Monica Burke", "Former Research Assistant", "Monica Burke Was A Research Assistant In The Devos Center For Religion", "Civil Society At The Heritage Foundation."], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_optimized/public/images/2019-06/GettyImages-840915374.jpg?itok=URvRztjN"}
