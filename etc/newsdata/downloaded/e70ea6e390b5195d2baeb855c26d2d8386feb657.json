Value stocks often produce \u201clumpy\u201d returns\u2014doing nothing or even declining for long periods before experiencing prodigious rallies. This has been especially so lately for much-ignored small-cap value stocks.\n\nIn the past three years, large-cap growth stocks in the Russell 1000 Growth Index have produced strong 16.9% annualized returns versus a meager 6.5% for small-cap value companies. Yet academics have found that small-value stocks beat more popular growth ones if you can wait out the fallow periods. Jeff John, senior manager of the American Century Small Cap Value fund (ticker: ASVIX), employs a quality tilt\u2014favoring companies with strong balance sheets and consistent free cash flow\u2014to improve his portfolio\u2019s results in the meantime.\n\n\u201cQuality has been the hallmark of how we invest,\u201d says John. \u201cWe believe that quality over long periods of time will generate excess returns with lower volatility of returns.\u201d The fund has beaten 95% of its peers\u2014and its benchmark\u2014with an 8.4% annualized return in the past five years, but with similar volatility.\n\nSince the 2008 financial crisis, skittish investors have had little desire to own weak, debt-ridden companies. \u201cWith small companies, when you have an adverse event, oftentimes that means permanent destruction of capital,\u201d John says. \u201cSo strong balance sheets are incredibly important.\u201d\n\nJohn and his co-manager, Miles Lewis, are part of American Century Investments\u2019 well-established value manager group. John joined American Century as an analyst at the small-cap value fund in 2008. He became co-manager in May 2012, and then took over the leading role when the shop\u2019s 16-year small-cap veteran, Benjamin Giele, retired at the end of 2014. Lewis joined American Century as an analyst in 2010 and stepped up as the small-cap fund\u2019s co-manager with Giele\u2019s retirement.\n\nThe managers have three supporting analysts. Lewis is based in New York, with another analyst specializing in technology in California. John and the rest of the team are in American Century\u2019s Kansas City, Mo., home. Being spread out helps the team find more small undiscovered companies.\n\nAs of Sept. 30, financial-services stocks were the fund\u2019s largest sector, representing 38% of the portfolio. \u201cBank stocks are pricing in a recession today,\u201d Lewis says. \u201cIf a recession doesn\u2019t happen\u2014or if it happens and it\u2019s not as bad as what\u2019s being priced in, which we would argue is the case\u2014then there\u2019s a significant amount of upside over three to five years.\u201d\n\nAmerican Century Small Cap Value Note: Holdings as of 9/30.

Lewis says it has one of the best balance sheets and most conservative loan-underwriting policies in the industry. Historically, the company has avoided taking on too much risk, \u201cbreezing through the financial crisis in terms of their credit costs,\u201d Lewis notes. CEO Ira Robbins is wringing further operational efficiencies out of Valley by investing in technology, reducing head counts, and shrinking the bank\u2019s branch count significantly.\n\n\u201cThese initiatives are going to help Valley grow earnings over the next couple of years irrespective of the interest-rate environment,\u201d Lewis says. Even if the economy stumbles and there\u2019s another financial crisis, Valley\u2019s strong loan underwriting will enable it to be a haven in the bank sector, according to Lewis. The stock trades at just 11 times its 2020 earnings estimates and has a 4% dividend yield, he adds.\n\nThe fund also favors insurers such as ProAssurance (PRA), a medical-malpractice specialist. \u201cThe payouts from the juries in these medical-malpractice cases are getting bigger, and that\u2019s pressuring the earnings of the malpractice insurance industry,\u201d Lewis says. \u201cSo, you might say, \u2018Well that\u2019s a really bad thing,\u2019 but we have begun to see insurance pricing increases for several consecutive quarters as a result.\u201d As premiums increase and weaker rivals go out of business, ProAssurance should emerge triumphant when the dust settles, he says, because it has \u201cthe strongest balance sheet of any malpractice underwriter in the country.\u201d\n\nPerhaps more surprising is the fund\u2019s 13% allocation to tech stocks. \u201cWe\u2019ve found over time some pretty substantial success in buying legacy technology companies that were once viewed as growth darlings but have seen growth decelerate over time,\u201d John says. Such companies can still have strong management teams, balance sheets, and cash flow, but have been \u201cdismissed by growth investors who are going to chase the next great unicorn.\u201d They often end up being acquired by private-equity investors seeking steady investments after the fund purchases them, John says.\n\nOne tech pick is Teradata (TDC), a database warehouse and management company. Its stock has declined recently because the company has been transitioning to a subscription-based sales model from an upfront purchase model, John says, temporarily slowing revenue growth. \u201cCustomers, instead of buying a big lumpy piece of hardware and software upfront, are now spreading that over a longer-term contract. Investors look at that and say, \u2018Boy, that company is really seeing a deceleration in sales.\u2019 \u201d But John and Lewis are patient enough to realize that investments in such misunderstood companies eventually pay off. And their focus on quality should insulate them until that happens.\n\nEmail: editors@barrons.com", "description": "The American Century Small Cap Value fund places its bets on small-cap companies, with a focus on those with strong balance sheets and consistent free cash flow.
