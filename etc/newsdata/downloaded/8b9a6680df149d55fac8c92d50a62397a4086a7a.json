Instead, he ran into the back of Garrett Smithley, who was 12 laps down in 35th place.\n\nBusch, the regular-season champion, dropped to a 19th-place finish and went from first to fourth in the playoff standings. Clearly aggravated after Sunday\u2019s race, he was blunt about the incident with Smithley, who was among 23 drivers on the track that day who are not in the 16-driver playoff field.\n\n\u201cI was told he was going to go high. I thought he was going to go high,\u201d Busch said of the instructions he received from his spotter. \u201cWe went middle because I thought he was going to go high. Killed our day. I don\u2019t know. Should have run fourth probably. Instead 19th. We\u2019re at the top echelon of motorsports, and we\u2019ve got guys who have never won Late Model races running on the racetrack. It\u2019s pathetic. They don\u2019t know where to go.\u201d\n\nThe comments have drawn sharp criticism, with some saying they came off as entitled simply because another driver didn\u2019t get out of Busch\u2019s way. Some responses came from some lesser-known drivers on underfunded teams and helped spark a debate over on-track etiquette during the playoffs.\n\nTommy Joe Martins, an Xfinity Series driver when he can piece together a deal to get in a non-competitive car, on Tuesday supported \u201cmy friend\u201d Smithley and called him a \u201creally good racecar driver.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis fear for any of us driving for a small team: become a controversy,\u201d Martins posted on Twitter. \u201cWe all just want to race & be respected. Stuff like this proves how bitter the divide is between 2 sides of this garage. It\u2019s depressing to me.\u201d\n\nSmithley will be Rick Ware Racing\u2019s driver for Saturday night\u2019s race at Richmond Raceway, the second event in NASCAR\u2019s 10-race playoff series. It will be his 13th career Cup Series start; he has one top-five finish in 133 starts across the Xfinity and Truck series.\n\nBusch has always driven for one of NASCAR\u2019s top teams. His break in the Cup Series came with Hendrick Motorsports and he was then hired at Joe Gibbs Racing, which has won 14 of 27 races this season and placed all four of its drivers in the playoff field. Busch has 207 victories across NASCAR\u2019s three national series and won the 2015 Cup championship.\n\nHis criticism of the smaller teams and the drivers trying to claw their way up to Busch\u2019s level prompted a lengthy rebuke from Smithley.\n\nHe noted that, unlike Busch, who followed his older brother, Kurt, into a ride at NASCAR\u2019s top level, Smithley \u201cdidn\u2019t grow up in a racing family, and we certainly didn\u2019t have the funds to race. The only race car my parents ever bought was a used Bandolaro race car when I was 15. I didn\u2019t think I had a chance starting that late.\u201d\n\nSmithley said he won enough races that a local golf cart shop owner stepped in as a sponsor, bought him a Legends car and helped Smithley move up to touring level. Then he decided to relocate to North Carolina, the hub of NASCAR, and try to make it in the big leagues.\n\n\u201cWhen I decided to move to Charlotte to pursue a career as a professional driver there is no doubt I had to basically give up the chance to win races in order to \u2018fund\u2019 getting the opportunity to race,\u201d he continued. \u201cI am one of only a handful of drivers that actually has never spent any of my own money to race. So spending money to go win in a late model was never an option, because the only way I can afford to race is if someone else pays for it.\u201d\n\nSmithley said he sells his own sponsorship, which he then brings to a team in order to secure seat time. He said most companies and sponsors prefer to back \u201csomeone like Kyle\u201d to get the marketing value they want.\n\n\u201cNobody that is considered \u2018in the way\u2019 wants to be,\u201d he wrote of the incident with Busch. \u201cWe are simply doing the best we can\u201d and \u201cI do think I can be competitive in the right equipment and I will even go a step further and say, with time and equal funding my teams with Rick Ware Racing, Johnny Davis Motorsports can be competitive, too.\u201d\n\nNASCAR is attempting to address the current model and financial distributions, and team owners such as Bob Leavine of Leavine Family Racing have repeatedly said they believe a balance can be struck between the wealthy front end of the garage and the small teams in the back that spend each week short on tires, parts, personnel and everything else needed to be competitive.\n\nAny solution will not come quickly.\n\nJoey Gase penned a similar tale of his struggle to make it in NASCAR. Gase and Smithley were both running near each other when Busch ran into Smithley. Gase\u2019s post included photos from late model races he won, noted he needed outside financial support to continue his career because his father worked in a coal power plant and his mother was a hairstylist and couldn\u2019t afford for Gase to race as his childhood sport.\n\n\u201cWe have to work for every sponsor we get and I am proud to say I have 30 different sponsors this year and would not be here without them,\u201d Gase wrote.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The massive divide between NASCAR's heavyweights and the underdog teams just scraping by received renewed attention following Kyle Busch's damning assessment of how backmarkers raced in the playoff opener over the weekend.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jenna Fryer"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/16/NASCAR_Las_Vegas_Auto_Racing_44828.jpg-c24ab_c0-0-5042-2939_s1770x1032.jpg?fef7eb75f9f94da85bdfec56b5752eb23ac4bedd", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
