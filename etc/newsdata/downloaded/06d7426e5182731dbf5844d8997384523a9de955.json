I am a bit ropey on \u201cmay\u201d and \u201cmight\u201d and got it wrong last week when I discussed why Jo Swinson failed to stand for the Liberal Democrat leadership straight after after the 2017 election.\n\nI said that Vince Cable was a strong candidate and that \u201cshe may not have beaten\u201d him. Thanks to Richard Thomas for pointing this out. It has been changed to \u201cshe might not have beaten him\u201d. The \u201cmay\u201d implies a contest that took place, the result of which remains unknown, while \u201cmight\u201d refers to a contest that could have taken place but didn\u2019t.\n\nHundred per cent: In a report about plans for heavier taxes on private schools we said \u201c43 per cent of the 100 most influential news editors and broadcasters\u201d were educated privately. As Bob Erskine reminded us, \u201cper cent\u201d means \u201cper 100\u201d, so just \u201c43 of the 100\u201d was all that we needed.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

The allegation concerns devices that \u201ccan extract identifying information from mobile phones, including their geolocation\u201d. What\u2019s the difference, he asked, between the geolocation of a mobile phone and its location?\n\nWell, strictly, its geolocation is where the technique known as geolocation guesses it is from GPS (the Global Positioning System that uses satellites) and mobile phone masts. As anyone who uses \u201cFind My iPhone\u201d knows, it is pretty accurate, and I so don\u2019t think it mattered whether we had the \u201cgeo-\u201d or not.\n\nChequemate: We reported new research from Shelter, the housing charity, under this headline: \u201cNearly half of private renters \u2018one pay check away from losing home\u2019.\u201d This was a direct quotation from Shelter, who are entitled to use the American spelling if they wish, but our style is to spell it \u201cpay cheque\u201d. Thanks to John Schluter for pointing it out.\n\nIt\u2019s a familiar enough phrase, I suppose, but as hardly anyone gets paid by cheque these days it might have been better to have ditched it altogether and to say something like \u201cone month\u2019s pay away from losing home\u201d.\n\nTrumped up charges: Time for another reminder that impeaching Donald Trump does not mean removing him as president. A president can be removed only if convicted \u2013 of a \u201chigh crime or misdemeanour\u201d \u2013 and the whole process is entirely political. Impeachment requires the vote of a simple majority in the lower chamber of congress. Conviction requires a two-thirds majority in the Senate, which requires Republican votes and is therefore much less likely.\n\nBill Clinton, for example, was impeached by the House but acquitted by the Senate.\n\nWe made this clear in our report that the House of Representatives moved closer to impeaching the president by voting to set the rules for hearings, noting that \u201cthe Republican-led Senate is unlikely to convict him and remove him from office\u201d.\n\nBut we tripped up by referring to the possibility that the House might recommend \u201cimpeachment charges against the president\u201d. Impeach means charge. We might have said \u201cimpeaching the president\u201d or \u201cdraw up articles of impeachment against the president\u201d.", "description": "An actual mea culpa from me.
