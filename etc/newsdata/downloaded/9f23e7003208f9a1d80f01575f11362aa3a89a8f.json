And when I think about that, I always forget that Audible has a free month trial where you get two free audiobooks to keep even if you cancel before the month is up. I\u2019m going to be real with you: The best part of this free trial (besides it being free) is that you get to keep the two free books you download during it. That means you get two free audiobooks to keep, forever. If you decide right after listening to Michelle Obama narrate Becoming that audiobooks aren\u2019t for you, that\u2019s no problem. You can cancel immediately without being charged. Plus, Audible books can be streamed basically anywhere. Access any audiobook through the Audible app on all Apple and Android devices, stream through Alexa-enabled devices, and even listen on your Kindle. Stream bestsellers like The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao (narrated by Lin-Manuel Miranda) while you\u2019re preparing dinner or listen to Roy Dotric read you A Game of Thrones: A Song of Ice and Fire on your commute to work. It\u2019s really a no-brainer if audiobooks have been on your radar. After the free month trial is over, it\u2019s $14.95 a month with access to two Audible Originals and an audiobook every month.\n\nScouted is internet shopping with a pulse.
