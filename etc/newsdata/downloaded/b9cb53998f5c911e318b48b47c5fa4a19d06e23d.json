He wrote that \u2014 based on a Thursday discussion with federal prosecutors \u2014 it \u201cis clear that no indictment has been returned.\u201d\n\nMcCabe\u2019s legal team provided The Washington Post with a copy of the emails. Spokespersons for the Justice Department and the U.S. attorney\u2019s office declined to comment.\n\n\u201cIn substance, the decision whether to resubmit a case, following a no true bill, to the same grand jury \u2014 or submit the case to a new grand jury \u2014 is entrusted to your discretion,\u201d Bromwich wrote. \u201cWe believe that for the reasons we have presented to you and the Deputy Attorney General in person and in writing, you should not resubmit this case.\u201d\n\nA \u201cno true bill\u201d case refers to a situation when grand jurors are asked to bring an indictment and decline to do so.\n\nTo bring charges against McCabe, prosecutors would have to convince 12 of 23 grand jurors that there was probable cause he had committed a crime \u2014 a low legal bar. This week, it seemed prosecutors were on track to do so. The panel that had been investigating McCabe was resummoned after a months-long hiatus, and McCabe was told Thursday that his final bid to persuade the deputy attorney general that charges should not be brought had failed.\n\nBut grand jurors came and went with no public indictment being returned. That could be a sign they balked, though it is also possible they have filed a determination under seal or could be asked to return later.\n\n[Justice Department authorized prosecutors to charge Andrew McCabe]\n\nMcCabe and his team have waged an aggressive behind-the-scenes battle to dissuade prosecutors from moving forward with the case. Last month, after being informed that line prosecutors had recommended moving forward with charges, they met with Liu, and later \u2014 after Liu endorsed prosecutors\u2019 recommendation \u2014 with Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen. They were waiting to hear back from the No. 2 Justice Department official when the grand jury was suddenly brought back in this week.\n\nBromwich cited some of that effort, and noted that if grand jurors declined to bring an indictment, Justice Department policies would advise them not to continue pursuing the case. The policies, Bromwich wrote, call for prosecutors to bring charges only if they believe \u201cthe admissible evidence is sufficient to obtain and sustain a guilty verdict by an unbiased trier of fact.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the evidence presented by your office was insufficient to convince 12 members of the grand jury to find probable cause to believe that Mr. McCabe had committed any crimes, no attorney can reasonably believe that \u2018the admissible evidence is sufficient to obtain a guilty verdict by an unbiased trier of fact,\u2019 \u201d Bromwich wrote. \u201cIf the grand jury voted not to approve charges, it did not find probable cause. Therefore, it is simply not reasonable to believe that a trial jury would find Mr. McCabe guilty of any charges employing a far more rigorous and exacting standard \u2014 beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d\n\nIt is rare, but not unheard of, for grand juries to decline to indict. In a famous case from the 1980s, a grand jury declined to indict former professional tennis player Vitas Gerulaitis in a drug case, after his attorney waged a public campaign to present his side of things and said he expected charges before they were filed. In 1993, a grand jury declined to indict U.S. Sen. Charles S. Robb of Virginia on obstruction and wiretapping charges \u2014 though that case had an unusual wrinkle in that the Justice Department\u2019s No. 2 official told grand jurors explicitly that the decision to indict was theirs alone.\n\nA grand jury also famously declined to indict police officer Darren Wilson in the fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., in 2014.\n\nThose in legal circles often joke that prosecutors can get a grand jury to \u201cindict a ham sandwich\u201d because the standard for returning an indictment is low, and because defense attorneys are not allowed to present grand jurors their side of a case. When a grand jury fails to return an indictment, there is sometimes speculation that it is because prosecutors did not try very aggressively to persuade the panel.\n\nAccording to Justice Department statistics, there were just five \u201cno true bill\u201d cases returned by federal grand juries from October 2012 through September 2013, the last year for which data is publicly available \u2014 compared with nearly 86,000 prosecutions in federal district courts that year.\n\nEven if a grand jury rejected charges, it is possible the Justice Department could continue pursuing the case, perhaps with new evidence or a new grand jury, though the previous grand jury\u2019s decision would almost surely hamper that effort and any future trial.\n\nMcCabe, 51, was involved in supervising two of the bureau\u2019s most politically sensitive cases: the investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server and the inquiry into possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia to influence the 2016 election.\n\nThe allegations against McCabe stem from the fall of 2016, a particularly fraught period in the bureau when the Clinton email case was wrapping up and the Russia investigation was gaining traction. A Wall Street Journal report published around that time detailed tension inside the FBI and Justice Department over the Clinton email case and a separate investigation of the Clinton family foundation.\n\nMcCabe has acknowledged he authorized two FBI officials to speak to a reporter. But he initially denied having done so when FBI officials \u2014 and, later, the inspector general\u2019s office \u2014 tried to determine who might have spoken to the media.\n\nThe inspector general determined McCabe lied four times to investigators, a possible federal crime, regarding his contacts with members of the media. Based on those findings, Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired McCabe from the FBI.\n\nProsecutors began using a grand jury last year after the Justice Department inspector general referred his investigation to the D.C.
