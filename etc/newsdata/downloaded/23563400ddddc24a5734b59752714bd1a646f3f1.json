REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo\n\nMizuho Bank said it will raise bank transfer fees using ATM machines by as much as double the amount currently charged beginning in March 2020 to \u201cenhance its service to customers.\u201d\n\nThe move comes amid heightening market expectations that the Bank of Japan could ease monetary policy as early as this month possibly by deepening negative interest rates - a move that will further strain financial institutions\u2019 profits.\n\nAs years of ultra-low rates squeeze profits from core lending operations, Japan\u2019s banking regulator is also warming to the idea of allowing commercial banks to charge depositors maintenance fees for their bank accounts, sources familiar with the matter say.\n\n\u201cBanking is a service industry. It\u2019s natural to charge fees for providing services such as maintaining bank accounts,\u201d an official at the Financial Service Agency (FSA) said.\n\nWhile the additional revenue is attractive, many banks are cautious of charging fees for fear of angering depositors and prodding them to flee to their rivals - or shift to cash, the sources say.\n\n\u201cDepositors are accustomed to holding bank accounts free of charge,\u201d an official at a regional bank said. \u201cJust announcing plans of a fee would face heavy resistance.\u201d\n\nThe debate could affect the BOJ\u2019s decision on how quickly to ease and whether to deepen negative rates if it were to act.\n\nThe BOJ has signaled its readiness to ramp up stimulus to fend off shocks to the economy. But it has also stressed it would be mindful of any side-effects such an action could have, including the impact on financial institutions.\n\nCommercial banks in Japan, unlike those in many countries, do not charge maintenance fees for bank accounts and have flatly denied the possibility of applying negative rates to deposits.\n\nGiven strong public resistance to being charged bank fees, the topic is politically sensitive, particularly after household were hit by a increase in a sales tax hike this month.\n\n\u201cWe may have no choice but to do so if the BOJ deepens negative rates,\u201d an official at another regional bank said.\n\nUnder a policy dubbed yield curve control, the BOJ guides short-term rates at -0.1% and long-term rates around 0%.", "description": "The Bank of Japan's ultra-loose monetary policy is prodding commercial banks to slowly diversify their source of revenue, with industry giant Mizuho Bank announcing on Tuesday a plan to hike some fees for its automatic teller machines (ATM).", "authors": ["Takahiko Wada", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438387529&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF970JV", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
