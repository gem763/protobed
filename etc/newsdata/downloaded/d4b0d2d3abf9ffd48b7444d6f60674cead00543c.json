Hutchinson had five saves.\n\nTampa Bay's top line of Point, Stamkos and Kucherov \u2014 which had 318 points last season \u2014 finished with 11 points Thursday in their first action together this season.\n\nThe Lightning were coming off a 4-3 overtime loss at Carolina on Sunday. In that game, the Hurricanes built a 44-13 advantage in shots.\n\nFollowing a wild first period that saw a combined seven goals, 27 total shots and a 4-3 lead for the Lightning, the Leafs pushed back in the second.\n\nBut Point \u2014 who missed a chunk of training camp before signing a three-year, $20.25 million contract as a restricted free agent and then sat out the Lightning's first three games following offseason hip surgery \u2014 scored his second goal of the game.\n\nStamkos left a pass for Kucherov, who saw his quick shot deflected home by Point at the lip of the crease at 10:46 to put Tampa up by two.\n\nVasilevskiy, who allowed three goals on 13 shots in the first, made a nice save on Trevor Moore later in the second before stopping a tip by Matthews.\n\nMoments after Matthews saw a good chance blocked by Victor Hedman early in the third, Tampa put the game out of reach at 3:58, when Palat's centering pass glanced off Leafs winger Kasperi Kapanen and past a surprised Andersen for his second.\n\nKucherov added his second of the game after stepping out of the penalty box at 6:57, when Andersen gave the puck away to Stamkos, who fed his linemate down low. He beat the Toronto netminder between the pads to make it 7-3.\n\nThat was it for Andersen, who was pulled for Hutchinson.\n\nTampa Bay, which tied an NHL record with 62 wins last season, got off to a fast start in the first.\n\nPoint got things started at 2:28 on his second shift of the season. He pounced on a rebound that Andersen couldn't control.\n\nToronto responded at 4:19, when Johnsson took a pass off the rush from Matthews on a power play and beat Vasilevskiy for his first.\n\nToronto then went up 2-1 at 7:46 when Tavares snapped a two-game point drought with a deflection.\n\nBut the Lightning responded on a man advantage of their own when Kucherov took a quick pass from Hedman and scored past Andersen for his second at 11:24.\n\nShattenkirk made it 3-2 1:21 later, moving past Morgan Rielly and firing a backhand home for his third.\n\nMikael Sergachev hit the post behind Andersen on shot that nearly put the Lightning up by two. Moments later, Matthews responded with his sixth after Vasilevskiy coughed up a rebound at 17:56.\n\nStamkos restored Tampa Bay's lead with 42.7 seconds left in the period when he snapped his third past Andersen for a 4-3 lead.\n\nNOTES: Point's assist on the Lightning's fourth goal was the 200th point of his career. ... Toronto visits the Detroit Red Wings on Saturday, while Tampa visits Ottawa. ... Attendance was 19,387. ... Hedman played in his 700th NHL game.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nLightning: At Ottawa on Saturday.\n\nMaple Leafs: At Detroit on Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
