It\u2019s not absolute but it\u2019s definitely pretty substantial,\u201d Kamarck added.\n\nIt is similar to the strategy Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton followed in 2008 and 2016, respectively, to win the nomination. Harris\u2019 team also hopes to perform well on Super Tuesday with a focus on Southern states and her home turf of California in what one adviser dubbed \u201cthe SEC primary meets the West Coast offense.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re staying focused and disciplined on is that this is a race for delegates,\u201d Biden\u2019s campaign manager, Greg Schultz, said on former Obama adviser David Plouffe\u2019s Campaign HQ podcast in September.\n\nBiden is leading the field among black voters nationally at 36 percent, according to Quinnipiac. In South Carolina, Biden has 50 percent support among black voters, a Fox News poll this month showed. But Warren has slowly gained in surveys of black voters: In the same October Quinnipiac poll, Warren jumped from 10 percent to 20 percent among black voters nationally. In South Carolina, Warren is at 8 percent and Sanders at 9, a statistical tie.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign has called attention to Warren\u2019s lack of support among minorities in polling. In late August, his deputy campaign manager, Kate Bedingfield, said on MSNBC: \u201cNo Democrat is going to win the nomination for president of the United States without African American support. Nor should they.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s campaign has kept quiet about their game plan, leading some Democratic operatives to wonder whether she\u2019ll try to plot a different course for amassing delegates that relies less on winning black votes in the South.\n\nIn a memo to supporters last month, Warren campaign manager Roger Lau wrote vaguely that the campaign intends to focus on states like Minnesota, Maine, Michigan, and Georgia. He did not mention any of the Super Tuesday states, including ones with large black electorates like Alabama, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas. Over the past two months, the Warren campaign confirmed hiring state directors in California and Texas, but have been mum on others.\n\n\u201cWe are organizing in all 57 states and territories, but we're not going to telegraph our entire strategy here to everyone,\u201d the campaign told POLITICO when asked about their Super Tuesday strategy.\n\nWarren\u2019s campaign did acknowledge hiring a state director in North Carolina, Maggie Thompson, who has been on the job for at least one month. Warren\u2019s team also sent organizer Chelsey Cartwright to Alabama last week, where she attended and helped organize events on maternal health for rural black women and historically black colleges and universities, according to her Twitter posts . Warren organizers have also mobilized potential supporters in Arkansas in recent weeks.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

But, she added, \u201cIt is true that Elizabeth Warren has a lot of work to do in the South and Southwest in the states that are majority people of color.\u201d\n\nSome of Biden's loyal supporters, like Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.), who endorsed the former vice president last month, insist Warren can't beat Biden in South Carolina even if she triumphs in Iowa. He argued that Warren as the nominee could spell doom for Democrats: \"The states, I could just line them up that we're gonna lose\" with her at the top of the ticket.\n\nWarren could conceivably win the nomination without a majority of black voters, though it would be exceedingly difficult. She would need to keep to Biden\u2019s margin among African Americans narrow, while winning white voters handily. Warren would also need the Democratic field to shrink dramatically.\n\nA recent Morning Consult poll captured the potential for Warren\u2019s candidacy if the field winnows. A majority of voters who currently favor Biden, Harris or Buttigieg named Warren as their second choice. Sanders and Warren supporters named Biden as their no. 2 preference.\n\nTheodore Johnson, a senior fellow with the Brennan Center for Justice whose research covers racial identity in electoral politics, recently crunched the numbers in a hypothetical match-up between Biden and Warren, based on the assumption that everyone else running dropped out.\n\n\u201cIf [Warren] can stay within 20 points of Biden on the black vote, then she's got a shot,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cShe can't afford to get wiped out by 40 or 50 points with black voters in the Southern states,\u201d he added, \u201cor in the urban areas in [states like] Pennsylvania and Ohio and Michigan.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["-", "Elaine Kamarck", "Dnc Member"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/4a/0c/5bd0108f4751b4ec17d8dd0b3dea/191017-biden-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
