In those letters, Democrats asked for all records surrounding Trump's call with the Ukrainian president and documents about the delay of military aid for the country.\n\nThe subpoena demands documents by Oct. 18.\n\nMore: Trump to tell Pelosi that White House won't cooperate on impeachment until the full House votes\n\nMore: Read the summary of President Trump's call with Ukraine president about Biden\n\nThe chairmen of the House committees \u2014 Reps. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., Adam Schiff, D-Calf., and Eliot Engel, D-N.Y. \u2014 who are leading the investigation wrote in a letter to Mulvaney that they regretted that Trump \"has put us \u2014 and the nation \u2014 in this position, but his actions have left us with no choice but to issue this subpoena.\"\n\n\"The White House has refused to engage with \u2014 or even respond to \u2014 multiple requests for documents from our Committees on a voluntary basis,\" the chairman said. \"After nearly a month of stonewalling, it appears clear that the President has chosen the path of defiance, obstruction, and cover-up.\"\n\nThe letter to Mulvaney also includes a warning should the White House not comply with the request: \"Your failure or refusal to comply with the subpoena, including at the direction or behest of the President or others at the White House, shall constitute evidence of obstruction of the House's impeachment inquiry and may be used as an adverse inference against you and the President.\"\n\nFriday's subpoena follows yet another intense day of developments in the House's impeachment inquiry. House Democrats asked Vice President Mike Pence for documents on his involvement in the Ukraine scandal and the House Intelligence Committee questioned Michael Atkinson, the intelligence community inspector general, about a whistleblower complaint that brought Trump's requests about Biden to light.\n\nThe president also was asked about text messages between Trump's then-special envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, and other U.S. diplomats that showed concern the president was dangling a U.S.-Ukraine meeting and military aid in exchange for investigations that would help him politically.\n\nThe White House has so far indicated that it will not cooperate with document requests unless and until the full House votes to authorize the impeachment inquiry, a move that Democratic leaders argue is not needed to launch an impeachment inquiry.\n\nDemocrats had threatened earlier this week that a subpoena may be issued after not receiving any response.\n\nEarlier this week, White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham slammed the threat as a waste of time.\n\n\"This is nothing but more document requests, wasted time, and taxpayer dollars that will ultimately show the President did nothing wrong,\" she said. \"The Dems can continue with their kangaroo court, the President will continue to work on behalf of this country.\"\n\nMore: Ukraine: Text messages show U.S. diplomats believed U.S. aid was linked to Trump's demand for Biden probe\n\nMore: Impeachment pressure: Trump says China should also investigate Joe Biden, family\n\nDemocrats have also issued subpoenas to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for documents and Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal attorney.\n\n\"She hands out subpoenas like they're cookies,\" Trump has said of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. \"'You want a subpoena? Here you go. Take them.' Like they're cookies.\"\n\nContributing: David Jackson\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Impeachment inquiry: House Democrats subpoena White House", "description": "The House Oversight, Foreign Affairs and Intelligence committees, notified the White House Friday evening in a letter to\u00a0President Donald Trump's acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney.", "authors": ["Christal Hayes", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cBj4Hbv7Z9yf9kwaZsnX2A--~B/aD0xNjE3O3c9MjQyNTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/7b624acc990d1e26e67a292f7a142c01", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
