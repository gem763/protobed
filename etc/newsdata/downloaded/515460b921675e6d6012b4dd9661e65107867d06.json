What we hear about young Nigerian people is that we are lazy. But we are hardworking. We want to make it.\"\n\nHe was just expecting a couple of dozen people in his network to tweet \u2014 but within an hour, he says, the hashtag went viral in Nigeria, prompting thousands of responses. People started sharing posts that promoted not just their side hustles but also their main gigs, from coding to baking to making art.\n\nThe hashtag has garnered the praise of Bashir Ahmad, the personal assistant of President Muhammadu Buhari, who wrote on Twitter: \"Spent over an hour reading every tweet under #ThisIsMyHustle hashtag, every single tweet made me happy genuinely ... I am super proud of you all.\"\n\nHi my name is damilola\n\nI am a computer engineer,\n\nRepairing of laptops and desktops #ThisIsMyHustle pic.twitter.com/pgee1KdnQC \u2014 Faranuvo (@faranuvo) March 14, 2019\n\nMy name is Ruqayya and #ThisIsMyHustle A homebased p\u00e2tisserie located in kaduna.\n\nInstagram: swirlsandcrumbs pic.twitter.com/MphdKSA2iJ \u2014 chimchim (@amantediragno) March 16, 2019\n\nHi guys I\u2019m Khalifa, and i take portraits and make videos\n\nHelp a brother out with a RT \u270c\ud83c\udffc#ThisIsMyHustle pic.twitter.com/KiPOpWEIlL \u2014 Mr.K \ud83e\udd8c (@khalifa_shema) March 14, 2019\n\nHello guys, My name Bulama Baba.

According to Nigeria's National Bureau of Statistics, the unemployment rate in the country was at 23 percent as of the third quarter of 2018.\n\n\"Young people finish school and then are not able to find a job,\" he says. \"So they start selling anything they can to make an income. They don't want to burden their parents.\"\n\nAbubakar knows what that's like. He graduated from the University of Leeds in the U.K. in 2013 with an MBA but says he has not been able to find a white-collar job in his homeland.\n\nSo he decided to start his own company. In 2014, he launched Beta Business Forum, which helps small-business owners with marketing and sales. He's also earning money as a real estate agent and a farmer. And he plants cash crops like sorghum and corn.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ahmed Yahya Ahmed Yahya\n\n\"This hashtag actually opened my eyes. I had no idea that there were this many Nigerians hustling out there,\" he adds.\n\nA number of the tweets are about agriculture, which has been hard to sell to youth in sub-Saharan Africa as a viable career.\n\n\"Young people [in Africa] face particular barriers that often lead to skepticism about farming as a viable future,\" wrote Kanayo F. Nwanze, former president of the International Fund for Agricultural Development, in 2018. \"Youth and other marginalized groups do not see farming as a business, as an economic enterprise.\"\n\nHello Twitter.

After he posted his tweet, he says, \"my life has never been the same. I got buyers around the world, like Canada, Dubai, even North America.\"\n\nAs with many other hashtag campaigns, some people on Twitter had hilarious responses to the tweets.\n\nPls u need to wear protective clothes and gloves.
