In this context, giving the green light to new coal mines only means deceiving locals and miners,\" it added.\n\nDuring the two-year legal battle, Bankwatch argued that the expansion had initially been granted without properly consulting locals and that the environmental impact of such an expansion had not been assessed.\n\nIt also added that it would pollute the area, including underground water, and that endangered species would also be negatively impacted.\n\nCEO wanted to expand Rosia's 1,450-hectare coal mine by a further 280 hectares, 235 of which are currently covered by forest which would have had to be cut off, according to Bankwatch.\n\nIn a statement to Euronews, CEO deplored that the court has not yet revealed why it sided with Bankwatch.\n\n\"Complexul Energetic Oltenia complies with all the environmental rules imposed by the EU, certified fact and by the two environmental expertise required by the court,\" it added.\n\nIn 2015, Romania had already achieved the European Union's renewable energy target for 2020.\n\nIts main energy source back then was natural gas (29%), followed by oil (26%), renewables (19%), coal (17%), and nuclear (9%), according to scientists.", "description": "An energy company wanted to expand Rosia's 1,450-hectare coal mine by a further 280 hectares, 235 of which are currently covered by forest which would have had to be cut off, according to environmental network Bankwatch", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/25/28/14/1000x563_cmsv2_04a50e69-0fe0-5424-b332-01a32910b11d-4252814.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
