(AP Photo/Gregory Payan)\n\nThe long annals of unexpected, unpredictable and often unreal Nate Diaz developments hit a new level Thursday when Diaz announced he was out of his UFC 244-headlining fight with Jorge Masvidal on Nov. 2 in New York.\n\nDiaz took to social media to reveal that he had, apparently, tested positive for some kind of performance enhancing drug. He then vehemently denied the charge and speculated that the test was a set-up by some entity \u2014 The United States Anti-Doping Association? The UFC?\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nHe then took it even a step further by suggesting someone in power told him to hide the results until after the fight, the way other fighters do it, opening an entire different scandal if true.\n\nEven by Diaz standards this was crazy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not gonna make it out to NYC for fight week next week because they say I tested with elevated levels that they say might be from some tainted supplements,\u201d Diaz wrote in a tweet. \u201cI call false on that [because] I only take Whole Food or natural food supplements. I don\u2019t even eat meat.\n\n\u201cSo until [the] UFC, USADA or whoever is [expletive] with me fixes it, I won\u2019t be competing,\u201d Diaz concluded.\n\nDiaz is a devout vegan who trains relentlessly, including as a triathlete. He has long called out other fighters for being on PEDs and is so respected that Masvidal took to Twitter to say he too didn\u2019t believe Diaz flunked any tests and that he\u2019d fight him no matter what USADA claimed.\n\n\u201cYou are one of the cleanest mofo\u2019s,\u201d Masvidal wrote. \u201cI know your name is clean.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Diaz offered no explanation or details about why he thinks someone is apparently making up positive drug tests about him.\n\nStory continues\n\nNeither Diaz nor his management team responded immediately to texts seeking further comment. The UFC has yet to make any statement with the situation ongoing, and the fight hasn\u2019t officially been canceled.\n\nUSADA has at times been embroiled in controversy and criticism from athletes but never in purposely tainting tests to take them down. Likewise, the UFC has millions to lose by having Diaz, one of its most bankable stars, pulling out of a Madison Square Garden pay-per-view on short notice. The promotion has been at odds in the past with Diaz, but that isn\u2019t uncommon in the fight game.\n\nJorge Masvidal squares off with Nate Diaz at a news conference for UFC 244 on Sept. 19, 2019, in New York. (AP)\n\nThe UFC certainly didn\u2019t need UFC 244 falling apart. It is a stacked card but the big draw was Diaz-Masvidal fighting for the Diaz-inspired \u201cBaddest Mother[expletive]\u201d belt. After that, Diaz was eyeing a potential trilogy fight against Conor McGregor which might smash existing mixed martial arts pay-per-view numbers.\n\nAnd while fighters say a lot of things, Diaz is known to back his talk up. The 34-year-old recently took three full years away from the Octagon in the prime of his career because he didn\u2019t think the UFC was offering him proper fights. He has stated he doesn\u2019t care about fighting for belts and just wants great competition that he respects \u2014 it\u2019s why he asked specifically to fight Masvidal.\n\nThere is a lot of true-believer in him.\n\nThe Stockton, California, native notes that he has already made more money than he ever thought possible and isn\u2019t going to do anything that he doesn\u2019t believe in. He seems more than content riding his bike, running a CBD business and a gym with his older brother Nick, and enjoying his passion for smoking marijuana.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to play their game and try to hide it or keep it quiet, as they suggested,\u201d Diaz wrote, not making it clear who, exactly, \u201cthey\u201d are. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna have my name tainted as a cheater like these other mother[expletives] who keep quiet until after the fight just so they can get paid. [Expletive] cheaters.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t give a [expletive] about some money over my dignity and my legacy,\u201d Diaz said. \u201cI\u2019m not playing along with this [expletive]. I\u2019m not staying quiet and figuring it out after the fight. That\u2019s cheating.\n\n\u201cSo fight game, I\u2019ll see you when I see you.\u201d\n\nObviously there is a lot to unpack in Diaz\u2019s statement, which brings many more questions than answers. The allegations are huge, but the details nonexistent.\n\nDiaz, though, sees himself as a very principled person and his willingness to call out people in power has long made him one of the most beloved fighters of the era.\n\nSince an August victory over Anthony Pettis, Diaz appeared ready to embark on a busy and exciting period of his career \u2026 big fights and big money lined up for the foreseeable future.\n\nNow this. Now this out of nowhere.\n\nDiaz out. Conspiracy theories and accusations in. Details scarce.\n\nWho knows what could possibly be coming next?\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Even by Diaz standards this was crazy.", "authors": ["Dan Wetzel"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/hfTGE6fDW4PHsFtgJxcHlQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/aZyfblrNxZk36RT8RDG5ug--~B/aD00MTE4O3c9NjE3NztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/b7dfd8f0-f6a8-11e9-bff5-76b96ed7556d", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
