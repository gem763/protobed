Two tech IPOs were delayed last week, citing market conditions, and yacht maker Ferretti SpA late on Monday reduced the price range for its upcoming sale.\n\nNot everyone is getting shy: special-effects company DNEG is exploring selling shares in London to raise 150 million pounds to fund growth, it said Tuesday.\n\nChoppy Markets\n\nAfrican and Middle Eastern companies have helped to keep the London IPO market alive, although with mixed results. Airtel Africa Ltd. has lost a third of its value since listing in June.\n\nHelios already had to cancel an IPO attempt last year. It was one of three African tower firms that tried to sell stock in London or New York. The most optimistic estimates gave them a potential combined value of $15bn before choppy markets scuppered the plans and Helios\u2019s two peers went down other routes.\n\nThe biggest, IHS Towers, decided to raise $1.3bn via the debt market in two offerings that will close next week. The other, Eaton Towers, is being bought by American Tower.\n\nHelios serves carriers including Airtel Africa, MTN and Vodacom. It\u2019s the only independent tower operator in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Tanzania, has operations in Ghana and launched in South Africa this year.", "description": "Helios Towers  rose 1.8% in London after raising 288 million pounds ($364 million) in a long-delayed share sale that gives investors a foothold in Africa\u2019s fast-growing wireless tower industry.", "authors": ["Swetha Gopinath", "Loni Prinsloo"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7097/3ac22b78cc0f49ecb08b153f338f6f7c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
