It was trading at $1.2675 at 1500 GMT.\n\nDeutsche Bank said it was no longer negative on the pound.\n\n\u201cThis represents a significant change of tune by the Irish government, that has so far been relatively pessimistic about the prospect of talks moving forward,\u201d Deutsche\u2019s foreign exchange strategist, Oliver Harvey, told clients.\n\nJPMorgan, meanwhile, predicted a deal would be struck, noting the two sides appeared to have found a solution to the thorny Irish border issue.\n\nThe bank now sees a 50% chance of a withdrawal agreement being struck with a \u201cmodified/time-limited\u201d Irish \u201cbackstop\u201d that could get round a major sticking point over customs and border arrangements between Ireland and the UK province of Northern Ireland.\n\nIt had previously put the likelihood at just 5%.\n\nSome remain doubtful. For one, time is short and any deal British Prime Minister Boris Johnson brings back from Brussels will need the British parliament\u2019s approval, including from hardline pro-Brexit factions.\n\nThe British government is therefore likely to request an extension to the Brexit deadline and then hold a general election, UBS Wealth Management said. But it acknowledged that the chances of a Brexit agreement had nonetheless increased.\n\n\u201cThe chances of a deal seem to have improved and the pound has moved accordingly but hurdles still remain,\u201d said Dean Turner, economist at the wealth manager.\n\n\u201cTime to thrash out the details of the deal are tight, and then there is the question of parliamentary approval.\u201d\n\nA deal would prolong the rally in the pound, Turner said, predicting sterling would hit $1.35 and trade in the \u201clow 80s\u201d against the euro if there was an agreement.\n\nMorgan Stanley upped its chances of a Brexit deal to 55% from 35% before the latest developments. The investment bank said a deal would be negotiable if London agreed to a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom, although it was uncertain such an arrangement would be approved by the current parliament.\n\n\u201cWe continue to see elections as the most plausible mechanism to decide the way forward on Brexit and expect them to be held before Brexit,\u201d the bank\u2019s economists Jacob Nell and Brunca Skarica wrote in a note to clients.\n\n\u201cHowever, given that a Johnson government seems to have switched to supporting a negotiable deal, we now see a significantly reduced risk of a no-deal outcome after elections, since even a Johnson government would prefer an orderly exit to a no-deal outcome.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nGoldman Sachs was ahead of the bunch, however, sending a recommendation late last Friday for clients to buy sterling against the dollar, with a target of $1.30 compared with the then spot pound value of around $1.23.\n\nIt assessed the probabilities of a Brexit deal being struck at 60%.\n\nPolitical risk consultancy Eurasia Group raised its probability of a Brexit deal from 5% to 10%. But barriers to one were still substantial, it cautioned.", "description": "Major investment banks said on Friday they had become more optimistic on the prospects for a Brexit deal, following an upbeat meeting between British and Irish leaders that buoyed the pound.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439745256&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A1L6", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
