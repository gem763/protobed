It\u2019s the students\u2019 choice of who they want to support as homecoming royalty,\u201d Holland wrote in the comments section.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m exceedingly proud to be the principal of our amazing school,\u201d she continued. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to agree but disrespectful comments will be deleted. WSHS loves and supports everyone regardless of who they are or what they believe. Thank you for the love and light from so many of you.\u201d\n\nWhite Station High School made the switch to gender-neutral titles this year, forgoing the traditional titles of homecoming king and queen.\n\nEmmett Campbell, the student photographer who snapped the picture of Allen, said his principal had made a phenomenal impact at the school since she stepped up from her previous role as vice principal this year.\n\n\u201cShe genuinely cares about us as students and puts in the effort to make us feel comfortable at school,\u201d Campbell told HuffPost.\n\nJoris Ray, the superintendent of Memphis\u2019 Shelby County Schools, said he supported efforts to boost student voice and expression:\n\nRegarding @SpartansWSHS Homecoming: Shelby County Schools policy prohibits discrimination, and the District is committed to ensuring a positive and respectful school environment where everyone is treated with dignity. Homecoming queen and king is a tradition... \u2014 Dr. Joris M. Ray (@SCSSuptRay) September 29, 2019\n\n...based 100 percent on student votes. As Superintendent, I support student voice and expression. \u2014 Dr. Joris M. Ray (@SCSSuptRay) September 29, 2019\n\nAllen said he\u2019d been stressing before the event, and described his win as a big relief. Of the negative Facebook posts, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t really care.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am so happy my principal stood up for me,\u201d Allen added. \u201cShe is such an awesome principal.\u201d\n\nHis message to other students looking to break down barriers: \u201cDon\u2019t you dare ever change yourself for anyone else but you! You are beautiful you are unique and you\u2019re special. Don\u2019t ever second guess your existence or feelings for a second.\u201d", "description": "Brandon Allen's principal had a message for online haters after his Tennessee high school shared a stunning picture of him receiving his crown in a gold ...", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d917c70220000cd04dfe966.jpeg?cache=v1qyx4kpqj&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
