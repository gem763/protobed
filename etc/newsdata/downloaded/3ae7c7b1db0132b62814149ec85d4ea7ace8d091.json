Prudential lost 10%.\n\nAmong midcaps, Capital & Counties Properties jumped 8.2% after luxury property developer Nicholas Candy's investment arm said it was in early talks for a possible cash offer for the property manager.\n\nIndustrial fastener maker Trifast plunged 15% on the UK small-cap index after forecasting lower earnings for the year, while peer-to-peer lending platform Funding Circle advanced 7% after reporting strong loan growth.\n\n(Reporting by Muvija M and Shashwat Awasthi in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur)", "description": "By Muvija MOct 21 (Reuters) - UK midcaps recovered from early losses to  edge higher on Monday on hopes that a no-deal Brexit will be  avoided even though...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
