No minimum deposits or loan documentation were obtained.\n\nSeparately, another buyer related to the director of the former joint venture partner of Pearl Discovery Development wanted to rescind the purchase, and apply the amount paid for the unit to the purchase of another unit bought by the buyer's relative.\n\nThis did not constitute an interested person transaction under the Singapore Exchange's listing rules, but RSM noted it was not disclosed to the board or audit committee after the CEO had already cleared it.\n\nIn its recommendations to Pacific Star's board and management, RSM said there needs to be sufficient and formal due diligence on sales recognised and follow-ups on outstanding deposits and payments due from buyers.\n\nRSM added there needs to be a robust delegation of authority to govern any changes to a sales contract, including approval from the board.\n\nPacific Star will also ensure appropriate approval for any waiver of deposits and matters related to financial oversight. RSM also called for improvements to the company's finance function.\n\nThe company has agreed to review and update its policies to include all RSM recommendations, to update its delegation of authority, and to implement new procedures and monthly reporting in relation to sale and purchase agreements.\n\nIts executive chairman now has direct oversight of the group\u2019s finance function, and the company has reiterated to its finance team on their responsibility for the group's finances and reporting any accounting issues as needed.\n\nCatalist-listed Pacific Star had in May announced the liquidation of its aluminium business as it seeked to focus on property development instead.\n\nIts shares were unchanged at S$0.159 as at 10.05am.", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Companies & Markets - INTERNAL auditor RSM Risk Advisory has conducted an independent review of Pacific Star's internal controls after revenue for the sale of 17 property units were included in its Q3 and Q2 2019 financial results despite risks\u00a0of non-fulfilment by buyers. .
