But back then, photography was less than a decade old, color photos hadn\u2019t come along yet and Pantone didn\u2019t exist.\n\nLuckily, Darwin had an ally to help pinpoint the colors of the dizzying spectrum of wildlife he witnessed: Werner\u2019s Nomenclature of Colours.\n\nAD\n\nThe 1814 color guide, inspired by German geologist Abraham Gottlob Werner and written by Scottish artist Patrick Syme, was a taxonomy of the colors found in the natural world. It contained hand-tinted swatches of 108 colors along with names and examples of where they could be found in nature. Darwin used the color names to precisely record his observations of phenomena like a \u201cprimrose yellow\u201d snake he spotted in Chile.\n\nAD\n\nDarwin wasn\u2019t the only scientist to prize the guide, which featured colors like \u201ccampanula purple\u201d and \u201ccelandine green\u201d and used things like \u201cthe white of the human eyeballs\u201d to help readers pinpoint colors. It and other color dictionaries of the time were used by other scientists until photography, and Pantone, made it easier to standardize color references.\n\nWerner\u2019s Nomenclature is still relevant today, inspiring a new collection, Colour by Nature, from Farrow & Ball paint. Andrea Hart, the head of the special collections library at London\u2019s Natural History Museum, talks about why the book is so precious in an interview at bit.ly/wernersnomenclature.\n\nAD", "description": "Werner\u2019s Nomenclature of Colours, an 1814 color guide, is still relevant today.", "authors": ["Erin Blakemore"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/vUR1aiuDfgytklNtY8lkhqTg2hw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WU54XDXLRUI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
