Pictured: Ashlyn Myers of the Coalition for Life St Louis waves to a Planned Parenthood staff member, June 2019\n\nMissouri's health department said concerns about the abortion clinic arose from inspections in March.\n\nAmong the problems investigators cited were 'failed abortions' such as one case in which a woman had to have up to five procedures to complete the abortion.\n\nIn another cases, a doctor failed to recognize that a patient was pregnant with twins, requiring a second procedure to remove the second fetus.\n\nThe health department has sought to interview physicians involved in those abortions, including medical residents who no longer work there.\n\nPlanned Parenthood has said it can't force its current or former employees to talk and that the state's concerns were addressed long ago.\n\nAttorneys for the health department wrote in legal filings to the commission that physicians' refusal to talk 'presents the final, critical obstacle.'\n\nA ruling on the license from Commissioner Sreenivasa Rao Dandamudi isn't expected until February at the earliest.\n\nThe battle comes as abortion rights supporters raise concerns that conservative-led states, including Missouri, are attempting to end abortion through tough new laws and tighter regulation.\n\nMissouri's recent law was signed Republican Governor Mike Parson in May and bans abortions at or beyond eight weeks of pregnancy.\n\nIt is one of the most restrictive in the nation and activists contend it effectively forbids most abortions since many women do not know they are pregnant yet at eight weeks.\n\nAbortions are allowed after the eighth week only in the case of medical emergencies, and there are no exceptions for victims or rape or incest.\n\nAny provider who performs abortions after eight weeks could be sentenced up to 15 years in prison.\n\nSeveral other US states with Republican-controlled legislatures have passed similar laws in what is seen as not just a political, but also a moral, fight.\n\nFive states - Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi and Ohio - have all passed restrictive abortion laws after six weeks' gestation.\n\nAlabama has passed what is perhaps the most extreme restriction, banning abortion from the time a woman 'knows she is pregnant'.\n\nThere are no exceptions for rape and incest and doctors who perform abortions can be charged with a felony and be sentenced up to 99 years in prison.\n\nHowever, all these bills have been blocked by federal judges and none of them are in effect.\n\nWhile the Missouri case unfolded, Planned Parenthood quietly built a new abortion clinic in Illinois, just across the Mississippi River from St Louis.\n\nThe 18,000-square-foot 'mega-clinic' in Fairview Heights is just 13 miles east of St. Louis and opened on Wednesday.\n\nMissouri women have been increasingly getting abortions at the Hope Clinic for Women in Granite City, Illinois, another St Louis suburb.\n\nAlison Dreith, deputy director of the clinic, said 58 percent of the abortions performed at the Hope Clinic through August of this year involved Missouri women, compared with 37 percent involving Illinois women.\n\nAnother abortion clinic sits in Overland Park, Kansas, a Kansas City suburb. The clinic is two miles from the state line.\n\nInformation from the state of Kansas shows about 3,300 of the 7,000 abortions performed there last year involved Missouri residents.", "description": "Hearings began on Monday about whether or not the last abortion clinic in Missouri, a Planned Parenthood in St Louis, can keep its license after alleged concerns about patient safety.", "authors": ["Associated Press", "Mary Kekatos Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/16/wire-20287438-1572280102-469_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
