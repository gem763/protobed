Interesting... But we had an emotional morning this morning because both of us just want to go home to our babies.\n\n(Image: staceysolomon/Instagram)\n\n\"We got an earlier train.\"\n\nShe captioned the video: \"We love each other very much, but we're realised alone time is nice for a little while then it just hurts the tummy.\"\n\nStacey then filmed Joe driving back to their house, and she said: \"We are in London and finally almost home, can't bloody come quick enough.\n\n(Image: staceysolomon/Instagram)\n\n\"It was lovely, wasn't it?\"\n\nJoe replied: \"Yeah... I mean, it was what it was.\"\n\nStacey continued: \"The company was great, it's just that...\"\n\n(Image: realjoeswashy/Instagram)\n\nJoe interrupted: \"Brussels is s**t!\"\n\nLaughing, diplomatic Stacey said: \"No, no... It's not terrible, it's just different and I want my baby.\"\n\nThey share five month old baby Rex together, and Stacey has 11 year old Zachary and seven year old Leighton from a previous relationship, while Joe is father to 12 year old Harry from a previous relationship.", "description": "Joe Swash complained Stacey Solomon's birthday celebrations were dragging on too long and they ended up heading back home early", "authors": ["Verity Sulway", "Image", "Instagram", "Staceysolomon Instagram", "Realjoeswashy Instagram"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20507395.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Joe-Swash.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
