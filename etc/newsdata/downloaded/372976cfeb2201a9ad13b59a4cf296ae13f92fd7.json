'I don't understand how he can do it because the ball is far away. If you bring down a player in full sprint, when the ball is not around, it is for me only one colour. It's dangerous as hell.\n\nMohamed Salah was left in a heap after he was hacked down by Hamza Choudhury at Anfield\n\n'I don't want to cause the boy any problems but he has to calm down. He is a super player, super development in the last two years. But these kind of challenges? No.\n\n'If you are quick someone needs to make sure that not everything is allowed to bring you down. The ball is not even close.'\n\nAnd Klopp added: 'I don't need to be a football manager to know this can cause serious injury. I only need two eyes.'\n\nThe Egyptian was left holding his ankle after being hacked down by Leicester's Choudhury\n\nBut Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers defended his player.\n\n'I don't think it was a really bad challenge,' he said.\n\n'The emotion of the game, it might seem worse than it was. He is an honest boy Hamza, he makes challenges but I don't think there was anything malicious.'\n\nJurgen Klopp was in disbelief that Choudhury was only a shown a yellow for his lunge on Salah", "description": "Jurgen Klopp labelled Leicester midfielder Hamza Choudhury 'dangerous as hell' after his challenge on Mo Salah left the Egyptian hobbling with an ankle injury.", "authors": ["Rob Draper For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/19/19339132-0-image-a-15_1570298695650.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
