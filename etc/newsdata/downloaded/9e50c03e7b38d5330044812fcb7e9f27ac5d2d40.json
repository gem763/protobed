The school denies it.", "language": "en", "text": "Abrahm DeVine, the Pacific-12 swimmer of the year in 2018 and a two-time member of the U.S. national team at the world championships, said in an Instagram post this week that he had been kicked off the Stanford swimming team because he is gay.\n\n\u201cPlain and simple: there are surface reasons I was kicked off the Stanford swim team, but I can tell you with certainty that it comes down to the fact that I am gay,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIn a statement attributed in separate media outlets to both Stanford assistant athletic director Brian Risso and Cardinal swimming coaches Greg Meehan and Dan Schemmel, the school confirmed DeVine no longer was on the team but said his sexuality had nothing to do with it.\n\n\u201cIt is truly unfortunate Abe feels this way,\u201d the statement read. \u201cThat said, Abe wasn\u2019t invited back to train with us this fall, as a postgraduate, for reasons entirely unrelated to his sexuality. We take pride in the inclusivity and supportiveness that exists on both our men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams, but we will continue to strive, as always, to improve those aspects of our culture.\u201d\n\nSwimSwam reports that DeVine had been training at the school as a professional after graduating in June. In August, about a month after competing at the world championships in South Korea, he joined Team Elite Aquatics in San Diego.\n\n[From The Lily: Niagara women's swimmers say men's team harrassed them and school did nothing]\n\nDeVine came out as gay in a September 2018 interview with Swimming World, describing his teammates as supportive when he told them.\n\n\u201cI remember that being a pretty emotional time, and just feeling my whole team wrap around me and feeling that love in a place where I hadn\u2019t really felt it, that was definitely pretty special for me,\u201d DeVine said in that interview. \u201cJust seeing them kind of prove me wrong was definitely special, something I\u2019ll never forget.\u201d\n\nBut in an Instagram story he posted after his initial accusation, DeVine said he now felt differently.\n\n\u201cCoaches trying to intimidate me, friends turning their backs, cis straight white men trying to deny something they dont want to understand,\u201d he wrote in one, an image of which can be seen at SwimSwam. \u201cHistory is repeating itself in front of me and its sad to see.\n\n\u201cBut I cannot allow this to stop me for standing up for what is right.\u201d\n\nIn another Instagram story, Devine denied that he was trying to use his sexuality as leverage.\n\n\u201cFinally: I am going to address the accusation that I am using my sexuality flippantly or that I am \u2018playing a card\u2019 to my advantage,\u201d he wrote. \u201cF--- that! I am way too proud.\u201d\n\nDeVine, 23, finished 10th in the 200-meter individual medley at the 2017 world championships and eighth in the same event at this year\u2019s world championships. According to his Instagram, he received an undergraduate computer science degree from Stanford in June.\n\nRead more about Olympic sports:\n\nNow a mom, Natalie Coughlin returns to the pool after a three-year break\n\nAlberto Salazar, track coach who trained Olympians, banned four years by U.S. Anti-Doping Agency\n\nIsrael\u2019s historic Olympic baseball team has something new: Israeli citizens\n\nUSA judo\u2019s Jack Hatton, an Olympic hopeful and \u2018true role model,\u2019 dies at 24\n\nThis group is supposed to handle Olympic sex abuse complaints.
