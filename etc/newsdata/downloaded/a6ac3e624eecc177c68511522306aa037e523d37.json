Alec Baldwin was in the hot seat as the subject for Comedy Central's latest roast.\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2013 If you call your daughter a \u201cthoughtless little pig\u201d on a voicemail, people don\u2019t forget about it.\n\nThat much was clear Saturday night at taping of the Comedy Central Roast of Alec Baldwin (airing Sept. 15 at 10 p.m. ET/PT), when Baldwin was the butt of jokes made by roast master Sean Hayes and roasters including Robert De Niro, Caitlyn Jenner and Blake Griffin.\n\nThe infamous message that the actor left to his now-23-year-old daughter Ireland was one of several themes of the evening of Baldwin-bashing. Other common refrains: Baldwin\u2019s parking spot flap, his unceremonious American Airlines exit, his second marriage to the much-younger Hilaria and his strained relationship with his brothers.\n\nBut the Emmy-winning man of the hour \u2014 who, along with Comedy Central, contributed a combined $1 million to nonprofit Exploring the Arts in honor of the roast \u2014 took most the jokes in stride. Throughout the event, Baldwin laughed both earnestly and sarcastically, frowned dramatically, made a look of shock and not-so-subtly used his middle finger to scratch his face.\n\nThe latter gesture was made after Ireland, herself, became an impromptu roaster. Not to worry: The move was followed by a bear hug.\n\nView photos Ireland Baldwin hugs her dad onstage after roasting him at the Saban Theatre. More\n\nWhat else got a reaction out of Baldwin? Here are some of the night's best (printable) burns:\n\nHayes said, referencing \"30 Rock\": \u201cI promise this will be the funniest thing you\u2019ve been a part of that Tina Fey didn\u2019t carry you through.\u201d\n\nComedian Nikki Glaser quipped, \u201cIt\u2019s an honor roasting Justin Bieber\u2019s wife\u2019s oldest, fattest uncle.\u201d\n\nJenner joked about her own gender transition when she told Baldwin, \u201cBack when I was Bruce, we were brothers. That\u2019s another brother you\u2019ll never talk to again.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look like if Jimmy Fallon drowned three days ago,\u201d said Griffin.\n\nDe Niro joked about Baldwin, \u201cI once saw him take a selfie and punch his own face.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to be the daughter of an iconic movie star,\" said Ireland from the mic. \"But I\u2019m not here to talk about my mom and her Oscar.\u201d\n\nRoast regular Jeff Ross congratulated Baldwin on his Trump impression, but then insisted that Trump is actually doing a Baldwin impression, because Trump \"calls people names, married an immigrant half his age. The difference: Trump calls his daughter a fox; not a pig.\u201d\n\nHayes showed his gratitude for the opportunity to host the evening with this line: \u201cThank you for having me ... is something your kids will never say.\"\n\nWhen it was finally time for Baldwin to get out of the hot seat, he ended on a high note.\n\nHe went into a rendition of \"My Way\" with assistance by \u2014 surprise \u2014 the song's writer Paul Anka.\n\n\"I didn't (find success) by starring in hit after hit, or by keeping cool. I did it my way,\" he said.\n\nIn closing, Baldwin announced, \u201cI love all of you. If you don\u2019t believe me, check your voicemails.\u201d\n\nAlec Baldwin talks 'SNL': He's 'so done' playing Trump on 'SNL': 'They should find somebody who wants to'\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: The best jokes from Alec Baldwin's Comedy Central Roast", "description": "Alec Baldwin's past controversies provided plenty of material for roast jokes made by Robert De Niro, Caitlyn Jenner and daughter Ireland.", "authors": ["Carly Mallenbaum", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/hisPX496QyF2Di7fJ25cZA--~B/aD0xOTIwO3c9MTI4MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_entertainment_893/a3d89fc5f52e7f48b4ecfbcdcc8789e5", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
