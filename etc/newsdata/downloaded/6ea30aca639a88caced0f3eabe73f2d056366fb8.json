The GroKo is down, but not out (yet)\n\nEven if the incumbent parties managed to hold on to first place in both Brandenburg, where the Social Democrats (SPD) have reigned supreme since German reunification, and in Saxony, where the Christian Democrats (CDU) of Chancellor Angela Merkel have long been dominant, the writing is on the wall.\n\nWhile Sunday\u2019s results are unlikely to trigger the immediate collapse of Germany\u2019s so-called grand coalition \u2014 or \u201cGroKo\u201d \u2014 between the CDU and the SPD, its future is no more certain after this weekend.\n\nThe same is true for the question of whether CDU leader Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, who has had rough start in the role, will become the party\u2019s next chancellor candidate. (Merkel has said she will not seek another term after 2021.) At most, the CDU\u2019s defense of Saxony granted her a reprieve.\n\nDespite their victories, the two establishment parties suffered significant losses. The SPD finish in Saxony, where it won just 7.7 percent, is the party\u2019s worst-ever score in a state election in its nearly 130-year history. Martin Dulig, the SPD\u2019s lead candidate in Saxony, had little more than gallows humor left after the results rolled in. \u201cWe may have the worst result, but we\u2019re the coolest [SPD] regional branch,\u201d he told supporters in Dresden in an attempt to let the tension out of the room.\n\nFew in Berlin were laughing. Even though the SPD managed to hang on to first place in Brandenburg and the CDU did so in Saxony, the incumbent ruling coalitions in both \u2014 SPD/Linke in Brandenburg and CDU/SPD in Saxony \u2014 were voted out.\n\n2. The AfD is closer than ever to gaining real power\n\nFor now, all of the parties represented in Germany\u2019s federal parliament maintain their steadfast refusal to govern together with the AfD. The question is how long that pledge will last if the far-right party continues to score results like Sunday\u2019s. A look around Europe suggests not long.\n\nWith the AfD controlling about one-quarter of the vote in both Brandenburg and Saxony, the coalition-building process promises to be complicated. Above all, it will force together strange bedfellows.\n\nIn Saxony, for example, the Christian Democrats\u2019 will most likely have to partner with the SPD and the Greens to form a government after Sunday's results, even though the CDU\u2019s local leader has said his own group has nothing in common with the environmental party.\n\nIn Brandenburg, the Greens are likely to join an SPD-led left-leaning coalition with Die Linke, parties with which it has deep ideological differences when it comes to the question of coal mining, a pillar of the local economy.\n\nThe ideological gyrations necessary to justify such coalitions to the public will likely fuel the AfD\u2019s argument that it is a victim of the political establishment.\n\nMeanwhile, some conservative politicians have begun to adopt some AfD positions in an effort to outmaneuver the far-right party. The CDU\u2019s lead candidate in Saxony, Michael Kretschmer, opted to campaign against his own party \u2014 opposing Western sanctions on Russia, for example, and even traveling to St. Petersburg to meet with Vladimir Putin. Despite his protestations, it would seem that at some point, a coalition with the AfD would not be a bridge too far.\n\n3. Germany remains a land divided\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing Sunday\u2019s results confirm, it\u2019s that 30 years after reunification, Germany\u2019s two halves are growing apart, not together.\n\nDespite a steep drop in unemployment and years of economic growth in the region as a whole, many east Germans feel they\u2019ve been left behind. The region\u2019s loss of about 3.5 million mostly young people, the majority of who relocated to western Germany in search of better jobs, is particularly bitter for eastern residents, who fear they\u2019ve been robbed of their future.\n\nMost of that population decline has occurred outside urban centers in rural communities, the same areas where the AfD is strongest. Moreover, worries about immigration, triggered by the refugee influx in 2015, have made them easy prey for the AfD\u2019s populist rhetoric.\n\nWhile the AfD has built a strong following in a number of western states, it typically wins no more than 10 percent of the vote there, a far cry from the nearly 28 percent the party won in Saxony.\n\nWhile turnout was up considerably in both state elections Sunday, the AfD was the main beneficiary, as people who didn\u2019t vote in the previous election turned out in large numbers to support the populists.\n\n4. All that glitters isn\u2019t Green\n\nThe sharp increase in support for Germany\u2019s Greens over the past year has captured the imagination of political pundits far beyond the country\u2019s borders. The party, which won less than 10 percent in 2017\u2019s federal election, has been steadily polling in the mid-20s nationwide, neck and neck with the Merkel's Christian Democrats.\n\nThey were also projected to post considerable gains in Sunday\u2019s regional elections. And while the party did well, its showing was below what pollsters anticipated.\n\nPOLITICO's Poll of Polls put the Greens at 14.4 percent in Brandenburg and 10.9 percent in Saxony, but the party finished with 10.8 in Brandenburg and 8.6 percent in Saxony. Though the results mark major gains for the Greens in both states, they also signal the \u201cGreen wave\u201d is unlikely to become a tsunami in the east anytime soon.\n\n5. Welcome to Germany\u2019s new normal\n\nThe one thing that Germany\u2019s west and east do have in common is that their political landscapes are fracturing.\n\nPost-war Germany implemented a 5-percent threshold that parties have to cross in order to win seats in parliament. The idea was to prevent a return to the political fragmentation seen in the pre-war Weimar Republic, where the presence of 10 or more parties in parliament led to political paralysis which in turn contributed to the rise of the Nazis.\n\nMuch of Germany's postwar era was therefore dominated by two parties \u2014 the CDU and the SPD, dubbed Volksparteien (or people's parties) for their broad appeal.\n\nDespite the AfD\u2019s rise, Germany does not appear to be in danger of falling back into authoritarianism. But its political system has become more divided, less predictable and \u2014 some argue \u2014 more democratic, with the inclusion of a greater diversity of views.\n\nSunday\u2019s results signal that the decline of Germany\u2019s once dominant Volksparteien and the fragmentation of its political landscape is set to continue.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more polling data from across Europe visit POLITICO Poll of Polls.", "description": "The far-right Alternative for Germany scored second place in two state elections Sunday.", "authors": ["Matthew Karnitschnig", "Judith Mischke"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1165483784-1-1200x628.jpg"}
