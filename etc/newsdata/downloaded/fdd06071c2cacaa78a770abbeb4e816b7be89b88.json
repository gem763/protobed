If only that had been the enduring image to be drawn from Harry (right) and Meghan's trip to southern Africa\n\nInstead, the recurring theme will be their decision to vent their frustrations in a television interview at the scrutiny they feel they are suffering at the hands of the media.\n\nThe decision will, I believe, prove to be as ill-judged as Diana's Panorama interview, and Prince Charles's confession about his failing marriage to Jonathan Dimbleby.\n\nBoth were initiatives that started off with the noblest of aims, to correct what they felt were misconceptions about their roles and lives.\n\nThe decision will, I believe, prove to be as ill-judged as Diana's Panorama interview, and Prince Charles's confession about his failing marriage to Jonathan Dimbleby (pictured, the pair together in Canada in 1991)\n\nBut both are remembered chiefly for their admissions of adultery. This was the high-water mark in what became known as the War of the Wales's, an unedifying tit-for-tat in which both sides of an increasingly bitter marital dispute waged a public war of abuse against the other.\n\nWhispered briefings here, a murmured tip-off there. It damaged both the reputations of the Prince and Princess of Wales and, in the process, the monarchy.\n\nExtraordinary\n\nI should know. As both a friend of Harry's mother and this newspaper's reporter on the crisis, I had a ringside seat on the whole sorry saga.\n\nNow, Harry's moment in the TV sun is turning the clock back to those dark days. His admission of a rift with William in that same TV interview has already triggered a series of unforeseen consequences.\n\nIn a carefully considered response of brotherly affection, Prince William let it be known that he was 'concerned' for Harry. A Kensington Palace aide went further, suggesting that the Prince and Meghan were in 'a fragile place'.\n\nCNN, not known for its royal coverage, reported its source as saying that the institution around the Royal Family was full of people 'afraid of and inexperienced at how to best help harness and deploy the value of the royal couple'\n\nUnderstandably, these comments provoked considerable public debate and, perhaps aghast at the reaction, sources close to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex yesterday returned to the fray. An unnamed aide hit out at the 'hysteria' surrounding the reporting of Harry's comments.\n\nThis was straight from the Charles and Diana playbook.\n\nBut it is what happened next that threatens to take the couple into completely unchartered waters. In an extraordinary intervention, the aide told CNN that Harry and Meghan were single-handedly modernising the monarchy, then launched a rant at those who surround the royals.\n\nCNN, not known for its royal coverage, reported its source as saying that the institution around the Royal Family was full of people 'afraid of and inexperienced at how to best help harness and deploy the value of the royal couple'.\n\nThe only conclusion to be drawn is that they amount to an attack on the Queen and Prince Charles's approach to monarchy.\n\nOnce again, the parallels with Panorama are uncanny. For it is reminiscent of Diana's assertion that questioned Charles's fitness to be king. Certainly, it is an incendiary step that will horrify the rest of the Royal Family and only polarise attitudes to the Sussexes.\n\nHowever, it also begs brutal questions. Who has asked Harry and Meghan to modernise the monarchy? Isn't one of the great strengths of the Crown its tradition and longevity?\n\nIndeed, the monarchy today is more popular, more loved and more respected than it has been for generations.\n\nIt has come through difficult and testing times, none more so than in the aftermath of the death of Diana. But the fact is that its approval ratings are now higher than ever. The durability of the Queen has ushered in this era of stability. She is a great unifying figure who brings together the nation, but she is not alone.\n\nInevitably, as she has aged, the focus has shifted to the younger members of the family \u2014 William and Kate, who conducted themselves with great panache in Pakistan last week and, yes, Harry and Meghan.\n\nOutpouring\n\nEach generation has introduced a new style to what they do. No one, I would argue, did more in that regard than Diana, but even she recognised that the institution needed only the lightest of touches, and never once was she arrogant enough to suggest she was the answer to the monarchy's long-standing welfare. The tragedy is that only 18 months ago, Harry and Meghan were demonstrating that they absolutely got this. The whole country was behind them at their Windsor Castle wedding \u2014 a ceremony that embraced modernity.\n\nThere was the gospel choir and the American preacher, a black episcopal bishop, with his homily about the power of love quoting Martin Luther King.\n\nPerhaps the most important element was Harry introducing to the Royal Family a bride with a mixed-race background. The crowds and the outpouring of affection for them was both genuine and heartfelt.\n\nBut it's what happened next that gave pause for thought.\n\nThere was nothing 'modernising' about concealing from the public the date of their baby's birth or where he was born. And what is 'modern' about declining to announce the names of the godparents?\n\nThere was nothing 'modernising' about concealing from the public the date of their baby's (pictured) birth or where he was born\n\nMaster Archie Mountbatten-Windsor is seventh in line to the throne and, while he may have no royal title, his grandfather will be king as, in turn, will his uncle and his first cousin Prince George. And, despite his parents' wish that their son leads a life independent of the Royal Family, it will inextricably be governed by the fortunes of that family.\n\nHow could they fail to understand that the clamour over the few glimpses the public were afforded of baby Archie was not sinister, but simply because people wanted to share in the couple's happiness? One might also be tempted to ask what is modernising about a very wealthy couple using \u00a32.4 million of public funds to refurbish their new home and their use of private jets while preaching about the dangers of climate change.\n\nIn truth, so much of the goodwill that followed their May 2018 wedding has been squandered. The psycho-drama over Meghan's father Thomas Markle was a homegrown catastrophe. And, if Harry and Meghan couldn't see that it was a disaster waiting to happen, what about the people around them?\n\nInstead of ensuring he was included in all the excitement of the wedding, and then the birth of his grandson, Markle was neglected. It was an act of self-inflicted folly, and it is no wonder he has reached out to the media in his frustration.\n\nNow, there is the decision by aides to brief CNN. Who thought it a good idea to confide in a U.S.-based broadcaster?\n\nThis whole episode has uneasy echoes of the Nineties when, as Harry's parents' marriage deteriorated, an acrimonious turf war was played out in the media.\n\nUnwittingly maybe, the Sussexes have fired the first shot in a new war.
