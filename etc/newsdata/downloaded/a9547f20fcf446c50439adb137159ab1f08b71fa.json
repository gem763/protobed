According to the sensational language in the IMF\u2019s World Economic Outlook released Tuesday, the global economy remains precarious, risks are significant, central banks have limited ammunition, manufacturing is turning down, and trade barriers are rising. The result will be a \u201csignificant drop\u201d in global growth this year to 3.0 per cent from 3.6 per cent last year.\n\nWhile concerned about slowdown, IMF pushes risky carbon plans\n\nThe IMF\u2019s warnings of a world economy precariously poised on the brink were somewhat offset by predictions that the global growth rate could be back up to 3.6 per cent within a year or so, and continue marching forward at that rate through to 2024. So whether the world faces a significant growth crisis remains debatable, despite the IMF alarmism. In other words, it might be bad but it might not be all that bad.\n\nWhile the IMF is appropriately uncertain about its medium-term economic outlook, the agency pulls no punches when it comes to long-range climate change risks. \u201cThe risks from climate change are playing out now and will dramatically escalate in the future, if not urgently addressed,\u201d said Tuesday\u2019s outlook. \u201cCurbing greenhouse gas emissions and containing the associated consequences of rising global temperatures and devastating climate events are urgent global imperatives.\u201d In its Fiscal Monitor last week, the same IMF had no hesitation in declaring the \u201cclimate crisis is urgent and existential.\u201d Policy makers \u201cneed to act urgently to \u2026 reduce the damaging and deadly effects.\u201d First priority, it said, was a global carbon tax of US$75 a tonne, or about $100 Canadian.\n\nThe IMF describes carbon taxes as the single most powerful tool to reduce national carbon emissions, although the discussion in the Fiscal Monitor around the effectiveness of carbon taxes is far from convincing. Among other things, a US$75 carbon tax would raise consumer costs for electricity, transportation, gasoline and other products, creating even more global turmoil than Trump\u2019s trade war.\n\nThe global price of coal would rise 200 per cent, forcing electricity prices in coal-dependent Australia to rise between 70 and 90 per cent compared with 30 per cent in Canada. The price of natural gas would rise 70 per cent. Gasoline prices would increase between five and 15 per cent, which is \u201cwell within the bounds of price fluctuations experienced during the past few decades.\u201d In that case, the impact on consumer consumption of gasoline would likely be nil.\n\nThe IMF, so obsessed with current global growth crises, seems little inclined to fret about any growth problems created by carbon taxes and other major state interventions. And there will be lots of intervention.\n\nThe first problem is that \u201cEven with robust carbon pricing, investments in low-carbon technologies \u2014 essential for the transition to the cleaner energy systems necessary for lower emissions \u2014 may be insufficient.\u201d The IMF warns of \u201cvarious technology related market failures and impediments\u201d to a carbon-reducing economy, all of which will require more government intervention in the economy, including feebates, regulations and other measures that would have to be implemented \u201cmore aggressively\u201d and \u201cmore efficiently.\u201d But aren\u2019t carbon prices supposed to be the most efficient and effective means to lower carbon emissions?\n\nThe cost to the global economy of embarking on massive economic reforms to rid the world of carbon emissions is not clearly outlined by the IMF. The best it could do is claim that the cost of achieving emissions reductions \u201cwould be lower than the costs to people and the planet from climate change.\u201d\n\nFurther complicating the climate catastrophe claims is the fact that the worst economic projections are set in sand\n\nBut claims that the drastic economic interventions today can save the world from larger climate-induced economic crises tomorrow are under increasing challenge. Steve Ambler, professor of economics at Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, recently summarized the doubtful claims of climate economy alarmists. The most extreme version of the climate \u201ccatastrophe,\u201d Ambler wrote in a recent Financial Post commentary, \u201cwould be a world in which those alive in 2100 would have incomes that were on average only double ours instead of 2.2 times higher.\u201d\n\nFurther complicating the climate catastrophe claims is the fact that the worst economic projections are set in sand. University of Colorado professor Roger Pielke Jr. recently outlined reasons for doubting the foundation for the United Nations\u2019 baseline \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d predictions that the world is heading for environmental crises if carbon emissions continue to rise.\n\nThese baseline projections, referenced by the IMF in its new climate paper, suggest environmental disaster looms. But Pielke says such assessments are a form of \u201cclimate porn,\u201d since the most alarming predictions are nothing more than extreme scenarios that should not be used to form policy. Pielke quotes one of the creators of the scenarios, known as representative concentration pathways (RCPs): \u201cThe RCPs should not be interpreted as forecasts or absolute bounds \u2026 no likelihood or preference is attached to any of the individual scenarios in the set.\u201d\n\nHow much monetary or fiscal policy advice would the IMF offer any nation or group of nations if they were looking at forecasts from their economists who said there was no likelihood that any one of their forecasts might be accurate?", "description": "The IMF, so obsessed with current global growth crises, seems little inclined to fret about the growth problems created by carbon taxes", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/imf-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
