That penalty wasn't enforced, however, as it offset with a Bills holding penalty.\n\nAllen remained on the ground for several moments before getting up under his own power. He was briefly examined in the blue tent on the sideline before running toward the locker room. The team confirmed he was being evaluated for a head injury.\n\nMatt Barkley entered the game and promptly completed a 28-yard pass to John Brown on his first play, but the Bills then turned the ball over on downs at the New England 3-yard line.\n\nTrailing 16-10 in the final minutes, Barkley's arm was hit as he threw, and Jamie Collins' interception with 1:27 left sealed the Patriots' victory.\n\nAllen was 13 of 28 for 153 yards, three interceptions and a fumble before leaving. Barkley finished 9 of 16 for 127 yards and the game-ending pick.", "description": "Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen left after sustaining a head injury during the fourth quarter of Sunday's 16-10 loss to the New England Patriots in Orchard Park, N.Y., and did not return.", "authors": ["Field Level Media"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5302184.1569790292!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/1177919109.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
