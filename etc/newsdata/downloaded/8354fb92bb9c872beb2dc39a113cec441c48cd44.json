That puts total sales over the 100 million mark for the console, which debuted in November 2013.\n\nWith total sales to retailers of 102.8 million, according to Daniel Ahmad, an analyst with Niko Partners, the PS4 surpassed the original PlayStation and now trails only the PlayStation 2, released in 2000 and the best-selling console game system ever, surpassing 155 million units sold.\n\nThe PS4 is the consoles that has hit the 100 million mark the fastest, Ahmed says.\n\nStreaming video: HBO Max will be more expensive than Netflix, Disney or Apple. Does that mean it'll be a tough sell?\n\nSpotify: Music service launches standalone music app for kids\n\nHere is official PlayStation shipment data from Sony.\n\n\n\nThe PSP and PS2 numbers are actually slightly higher as Sony stopped reporting back in 2012 despite continuing to ship units after.\n\n\n\nSony never reported PS Vita sales so it's impossible to say if PS4 has outsold it yet... pic.twitter.com/hm6xcc7dTK \u2014 Daniel Ahmad (@ZhugeEX) October 30, 2019\n\nBut PS4 sales are slowing. The 2.8 million sold in the previous quarter is below the 3.9 million sold in the same quarter a year ago.\n\nSales of PS4 software also approaching a milestone. Sony had sold 876 million games to consumers by the end of 2018. With another 158.9 million sold to retailers (but not yet to consumers) so far in 2019, Sony is nearing 1 billion PS4 games sold.\n\nPlayStation 4 sales will likely be solid over the holiday season with new games such as \"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare\" and \"Death Stranding\" arriving.\n\nBut Sony is at work on a successor, the PS5, which is due during the holiday season next year. Microsoft has its own Project Scarlett, a new console to succeed the Xbox One, coming at about the same time next year, too.\n\nSony on Tuesday announced it would shutter its PlayStation Vue live TV subscription service, citing high costs of content acquisition and problems making network deals.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2019/10/30/ps-4-sales-surpass-100-million-sony-says-topping-first-playstation/4095131002/", "description": "Sony says its PlayStation 4 video game console, released in 2013, has sold more than 100 million units, making the PS4 its second-best selling system.", "authors": ["Mike Snider", "Published A.M.
