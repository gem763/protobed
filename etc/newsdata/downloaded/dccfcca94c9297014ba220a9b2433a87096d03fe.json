Trump has endorsed such a move, and Sanders this week launched a slick website that further fueled speculation. In the meantime, she signed on to Fox News as a contributor \u2014 a move that will keep her in the public eye.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201906/1807/1155968404_6049294022001_6048083150001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\nHer website also notes that she \u201cadvises major companies and non-profits.\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019 potential work with Teneo would mark a lucrative opportunity and provides a path that has generally been closed to many other top former Trump officials. The situation marks a contrast to Obama White House officials, who landed high-profile gigs at corporations like McDonald\u2019s, United Airlines, Amazon and Uber.\n\n\u201cCorporate America have basically banned Trump people from making a payday afterwards,\u201d said the person familiar with the matter. Sanders is \u201cstill getting corporate America, but she\u2019s got to do sleight of hand \u2026 Nobody in Corporate America will ever pay a Trump person.\u201d\n\nTeneo, which has more than 800 employees with around 20 offices around the world, was founded in 2011 by Declan Kelly, who worked in Hillary Clinton\u2019s State Department, and Doug Band, a close aide for former President Bill Clinton, as well as Paul Keary.\n\nIt also has attracted controversy, including for hiring Huma Abedin, a close aide to Hillary Clinton, while Abedin simultaneously worked in the State Department.\n\nThe CEO advisory firm has evolved and worked actively to build contacts in the Trump era. Jason Miller, a former top staffer on Trump\u2019s campaign who worked at Teneo after the 2016 election, recently left the firm after leveling crude personal insults on Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) on Twitter.\n\nKen Kurson, who was the editor of the Jared Kushner-owned New York Observer, also joined Teneo as a senior managing director, but is no longer at the firm.\n\nTeneo\u2019s major clients include Dow Chemical, Coca-Cola, Weight Watchers, Delta and GE.\n\nSix Teneo employees recently registered as foreign agents as part of the Foreign Agent Registration Act in their work for Neom, a $500 billion effort to build a new city in Saudi Arabia that describes itself as the \u201cworld\u2019s most ambitious project.\u201d Neom is controlled and funded by Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund.\n\nOne of Sanders\u2019 major assets is her close relationship with Trump. The president sung her praises when he announced she was leaving the White House, calling her \u201ca very special person with extraordinary talents, who has done an incredible job! I hope she decides to run for Governor of Arkansas \u2014 she would be fantastic.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump loves her,\u201d said one of the people familiar with the Teneo arrangement. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t love many people. He loves her. He loves her. She\u2019s his girl.\u201d\n\n", "description": "Sanders\u2019 potential work with Teneo would mark a lucrative opportunity as she weighs a run for Arkansas governor.", "authors": ["Daniel Lippman"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/ea/21/6455dad94948b16b3d13c67c2b9a/190828-sarah-sanders-gty-773.jpg"}
