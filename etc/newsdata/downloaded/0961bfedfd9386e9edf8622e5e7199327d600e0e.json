But a growing number of others anticipate a financial crunch as they try to plan for their future on a fixed income, uncertain how far their savings and retirement funds will stretch.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAging in place is a major financial commitment, one that may be at odds with retirees\u2019 plans to downsize their lives and budgets and squirrel away cash in anticipation of rising health-care costs.\n\nA report released Wednesday by Harvard University\u2019s Joint Center for Housing Studies may fuel these concerns. It cites growing income disparity for older Americans in the wake of the Great Recession, and says \u201censuring financial and housing security in retirement will be a struggle.\u201d\n\nFor those 65 and older, it says, \u201cthe number of households with housing cost burdens has reached an all-time high.\u201d\n\nBankruptcy concerns\n\nBy 2050, almost one-quarter of Americans will be 65 or older, according to the Census Bureau. Surveys conducted over the past decade show that older adults overwhelmingly want to age in their homes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYet many houses aren\u2019t suited to \u201caging in place,\u201d said Abbe Will, associate project director of the Remodeling Futures Program at Harvard.\n\n\u201cCurrently, a lot do not have single-floor living \u2014 especially in certain parts of country. There are lots of stairs and multistory homes when land is more valuable,\u201d she said. And \u201cmany homeowners don\u2019t necessarily have the funds to do aging in place.\u201d\n\nHome modifications and costs vary widely \u2014 starting with those simple safety features in the bathroom or lever doorknobs throughout the house \u2014 to more extensive changes, such as widening doorways or lowering light switches to wheelchair height. Will said simple retrofits, such as grab bars, \u201ccould be several hundred dollars,\u201d but a \u201cwhole bathroom remodel would be in the thousands or tens of thousands.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s coming down the pipeline as we age,\u201d said sociologist Deborah Thorne of the University of Idaho, lead author of a study that found skyrocketing bankruptcy rates among those 65 and older.\n\nAD\n\nThe research, recently published in the journal Sociological Inquiry, finds the share of older Americans filing for bankruptcy has never been higher. \u201cAnd bankrupt households are more likely than ever to be headed by a senior \u2014 the percent of older bankrupt filers has increased almost 500 percent since 1991,\u201d the study found.\n\nThe Harvard report also cited the burden of debt among those ages 65 to 79, with nearly half of those homeowners carrying a mortgage in 2016. And people are carrying substantially more student loan and credit card debt into retirement as well.\n\nAD\n\nJames Gaines, an economist at Texas A&M University, attributes the rise in late-life debt \u201cto the labor market and employment downsizing and letting older people go first. It can force them into retirement whether they\u2019re ready for it or not. Retirement income may not be enough to carry their debts, and they don\u2019t have enough savings.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe leading edge of baby boomers has not hit 75 yet,\u201d said Jennifer Molinsky, lead author of the Harvard report. \u201cWhen you think about the next five, 10 or 15 years when they\u2019re in their 80s, you\u2019re really going to see the needs shift.\u201d\n\nMolinsky said just what financially challenged seniors should do about housing \u201cis a good question and is a tough question.\u201d Many states have loan and grant programs for home modifications if individuals have a documented disability, she said, yet \u201cwhat we need more of are programs that help you do this before you need it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMolinsky said communities need to create housing near city centers so seniors don\u2019t have to drive. And in the suburbs, communities need to offer more multifamily options, including condos and apartments to buy and rent.\n\n\u201cWe just need options,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to think about housing options that help people stay in that community. Low-income people need housing that\u2019s affordable. Some people want to trade that single-family home for a condo. Others want to reassess their money and sell their home for a rental. Not everybody wants the same thing.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nA $300,000 remodel\n\nFor most of U.S. history, people have moved in with relatives or gone to a care facility to live out their final years. Baby boomers don\u2019t want either, and those with resources have generally created the modern idea of remaking old age to fit their lifestyle and retrofitting their homes for aging in place. Design and construction firms are coming up with safety features that look good as well. Think of it as the age-defying home.\n\nAD\n\nThe Cavners are closely watching details of the renovation, but this dramatic late-life relocation wasn\u2019t a hard decision.\n\nThey are rebuilding their house \u2014 assessed at $700,000 around the time of the sale \u2014 from a shell. The remodel could easily cost $300,000 in the hot Austin market.\n\nLeaving nothing to chance, the Cavners are paying for a number of modifications they might never need. For instance, neither uses a wheelchair, but contractors are making all doorways three feet wide \u2014 just in case. The master bath roll-in shower, flat and rimless, will provide room to maneuver. In the kitchen, drawers, rather than cabinets, will allow easy access in a wheelchair.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDon and Lynn Dille, both 75, built their Austin home with the intention of staying there a long time. After living in California, Virginia and elsewhere in Texas, they moved to Austin in 2012 and, within a year, began drawing plans with an architect for an energy-efficient home to age in place.\n\nTheir home was featured this summer in Austin\u2019s annual Cool House Tour for its design making the most of natural light, cross-ventilation and solar panels, as well as wider-than-normal doorways and level floors for wheelchair use.\n\nOne key feature of the construction acknowledges that they might need live-in help down the road to avoid long-term nursing care. Just as the Cavners may convert a bedroom and bath on the opposite side of their new home into caregiver quarters, the Dilles constructed a second floor above their detached garage that could convert into living space.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe think having a separate apartment where we could have a caretaker or part-time help to maintain our property makes us able to stay where we\u2019d like to be and be independent,\u201d said Don Dille, who retired from the federal government.\n\nThe renovations are meant to meet personal needs, but that doesn\u2019t mean they wouldn\u2019t appeal to others and even add to the resale value down the road.\n\nFor his part, Dennis Cavner, an investment adviser and co-founder of a new health-care start-up, said he believes what they\u2019re spending to renovate the house for the years ahead will prove a sound investment: \u201cThe modifications we\u2019re making are not going to make it less desirable. It will feel more spacious.\u201d\n\nKaiser Health News (KHN) is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.
