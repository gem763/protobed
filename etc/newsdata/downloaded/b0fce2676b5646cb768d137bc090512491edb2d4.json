It's a very simple answer. They should investigate the Bidens,\u201d the president told reporters about Ukraine on the South Lawn of the White House. \u201cLikewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens. Because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine.\"\n\nTrump and his allies have claimed that Hunter Biden convinced China to put $1.5 billion in a fund for an investment firm he had a stake in when his father, Joe Biden, was in office. Lawyers for the former vice president's son have denied those assertions.\n\nThe statement came moments after Trump said the U.S. has \u201ca lot of options\u201d to get Beijing to bend to its will in the trade talks.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t do what we want, we have tremendous power,\u201d he said.\n\nBy late Thursday, the controversy had opened a new front in the impeachment inquiry and spurred rebukes from Democrats across the board.\n\nThe top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), called on the White House, Treasury Department and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to explain whether the Biden issue had actually been raised in the context of trade talks and to produce any relevant documents.\n\n\u201cLinking trade negotiations to Donald Trump\u2019s wide-ranging effort to fabricate foreign accusations against political rivals is a complete abuse of the powers of the president,\u201d said Wyden in a statement. \u201cI am increasingly concerned that he is using the leverage of trade threats for personal gain, just as he did with foreign aid to Ukraine. The Chinese communist government has a long record of concocting false evidence to convict political enemies, and I have no doubt they would happily fabricate evidence against the American president\u2019s enemies in exchange for trade concessions from the United States.\u201c\n\nFor its part, China is unlikely to heed Trump\u2019s call for the purpose of getting the U.S. to ease up on tariffs and other trade demands, said experts with experience in the country.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think China seriously entertains this a quid pro quo in terms of the trade negotiations,\u201d said Jude Blanchette, a China scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nHe said Beijing would be \u201cextraordinarily stupid\u201d to act on Trump\u2019s suggestion in order to secure a deal, considering the backlash it could get from Congress and hard-liners in Trump\u2019s inner circle.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re treating every utterance of the president to be followed in tandem by an action,\u201d Blanchette said.\n\nThe Chinese embassy didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on Trump\u2019s request and its relationship to the trade talks.\n\nTrump has made China a major focus of his presidency, vowing to address trade practices blamed for wholesale theft of U.S. technology and a ballooning U.S. trade deficit.\n\nEven as Beijing has balked at U.S. demands that would force major changes to its laws and policies, the two sides could be working toward a preliminary deal aimed at easing global economic tensions that have resulted from a tariff battle that has hit hundreds of billions of dollars of trade.\n\nA potential mini deal with China already faces the prospect of being the subject of intense political blowback not only from Trump\u2019s Democratic challengers, but also a growing majority of Congress that has made a bipartisan call to crack down on Beijing.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese have no wish or intention to become involved in partisan politics in the United States,\u201d said Craig Allen, president of the US-China Business Council. \u201cWhile they will pursue their own interests, they will do so blind to the partisan implications.\u201d\n\nMichael Pillsbury, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, said there is no equivalent word in Mandarin to \u201cimpeachment.\u201d\n\nBeijing still has difficulty trying to analyze the separation of powers in the U.S. political system, said Pillsbury, an outside adviser to the Trump administration who was involved in U.S.-China policy in the Nixon era.\n\n\u201cFor a long time [China] didn\u2019t understand Watergate. They didn\u2019t believe it was important,\u201d he said. \u201cUltimately, they began to see it was a major issue.\u201d\n\nBut he said he didn\u2019t expect the president\u2019s latest statement to upend the negotiations. \u201cI fully expect them to show up,\u201d Pillsbury said.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/06/20/a93147b044b7b198615e7127e895/191003-trump-gty-773.jpg"}
