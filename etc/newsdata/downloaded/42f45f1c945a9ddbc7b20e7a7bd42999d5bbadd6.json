The leaks and rumours have already begun, with Google even releasing its own image in a baller power move earlier this year. But there have been some updates since then, including some pretty massive spec leaks. Here's everything we know so far. Read more\n\nGoogle is looking set to unveil the Pixel 4 during its New York event in October after months of rumours and alleged leaks. We're expecting two models, a regular size and the XL, and specs-wise, it'll supposedly come with an OLED screen, 6GB of RAM, a Snapdragon 855 chip and a 2,800mAH battery \u2060\u2014 a slight downgrade from the Pixel 3 battery.\n\nWe already have a very good idea of what it looks like due to numerous, and consistent, leaks. It's likely to have a thicc camera bump and it comes in an outlandish coral finish and a Google ad in New York City's Time Square, recently spotted by Reddit users, seemed to confirm it.\n\nHow do I watch it?\n\nThe event will begin at 10am on Tuesday, October 15 in New York City. For Australians, that translates to 1am on Thursday, September for Sydney, Melbourne and Hobart. As Brisbane doesn't sign up for daylight savings, it's midnight on the Wednesday for them. Adelaide, is 12.30am and in Perth, it's 10pm on Tuesday, October 15.\n\nYou can view it below on Made By Google's YouTube channel.\n\nIs it just the Pixel 4 launch?\n\nWhile the Pixel 4 is expected to be the biggest announcement, there's supposedly more on the way. Google's been a bit tight-lipped about its cloud gaming service, Google Stadia, but a leaked slide show indicates the service's app will be available from next year on Android TV and Google has previously stated it'll be ready for public release in some countries, like the US, by November 2019. It's not yet clear if or when Australians will get the service.\n\nEarlier this year, Google said it was out of the business of making tablet devices but 9to5Google is suggesting a new PixelBook might be on the way. The site noticed a listing with the US Federal Communications Commission, suggesting one's on the way.\n\nAside from those potential announcements, a new Nest Mini (re-branded from Home Mini) and Nest WiFi router are also expected to be unveiled.", "description": "Google has just announced an event for October 15 in New York City where it's expected it'll finally reveal the much-leaked Pixel 4.
