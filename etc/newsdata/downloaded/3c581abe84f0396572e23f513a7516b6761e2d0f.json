Passengers are often verbally disruptive, physical assaults are less frequent, according to Congress' independent watchdog agency. About 10 percent of those agents surveyed experienced physical confrontations.\n\nThe congressional investigative agency said comprehensive figures, such as frequency and the nature of the assaults are hard to find. However, the report cites alcohol consumption, frustration over fees for checked or carry-on baggage, and long lines as factors that can contribute to agitation among passengers.\n\nThe accountability office was ordered by Congress to investigate these violent occurrences after media coverage revealed passengers being disruptive or violent toward airline customer service agents, which raised questions over agents' safety.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2017, a \"near riot\u201d ensued at a Spirit Airlines ticket counter at a Florida airport after the airline canceled several flights. Following the unrest, three passengers were charged with disorderly conduct.\n\nIn the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018, airlines were required to provide de-escalation training to all employees. They were also required to submit plans to the FAA by January 2019 over how airlines will respond to passenger assaults. In July 2019, FAA issued a notification to airlines reminding them to submit their plans, according to the report, which added that officials will continue to follow up with airlines, who missed the deadline, until they receive the plans.\n\nThe accountability office said a number of laws generally prohibit certain intentional acts of verbal and physical aggression against another individual, adding that these laws, though not specific to customer service agents, can be used in charging and prosecuting passengers.\n\nOf agents who reported an incident with a customer, more than half said they believed that somebody from their airline, airport or law enforcement took action ranging from talking to the passenger to arresting them.\n\nInterfering with an airline crew on board a flight, however, is considered a federal crime, while incidents at airports are usually covered by state or local laws.\n\nGAO said the Federal Aviation Administration and the Transportation Security Administration said their roles in handling passenger assaults at airports were limited mostly to in-flight incidents or airport security, respectively.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS.\n\nFive of the airlines refused to share information about incidents with the accountability office. The sixth, which was not identified, said its records for the second half of 2018 showed 1.2 assaults for every 1,000 passengers.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Dozens of airline customer service agents reported being verbally threatened from passengers in 2019.", "authors": ["Daniella Genovese"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/spirit-airlines-Getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
