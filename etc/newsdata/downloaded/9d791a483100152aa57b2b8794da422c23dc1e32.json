Still, he was rather dominant for seven innings, striking out 12 batters and finishing off each one with an off-speed pitch.\n\nThe Cardinals, quite simply, can\u2019t hit in this NLCS: They have a grand total of two runs and 11 hits through three games. Washington\u2019s three starters have a combined ERA - no calculator necessary for this one - of 0.00.\n\nYes, that\u2019s zero-point-zero-zero.\n\nNow it\u2019s Patrick Corbin\u2019s chance to see if he can match his rotation-mates. The $140 million lefty will start for the Nationals in Game 4 on Tuesday night, when they can close out a sweep at home. Rookie right-hander Dakota Hudson will be on the mound for the Cardinals.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get a lead at some point in this series. Hard to win a game if you can\u2019t get a lead,\u201d St. Louis manager Mike Shildt said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to figure out a way to create some offense early in the game and be able to hold it there. It\u2019s the first time our pitching hasn\u2019t been able to contain this offense. I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll be able to do that tomorrow.\u201d\n\nWashington hasn\u2019t put a baseball team in the World Series since 1933, when the Senators lost to the New York Giants in five games. The nation\u2019s capital owns only one MLB championship; the Senators won all the way back in 1924. There wasn\u2019t even a baseball team at all in Washington for more than three decades until the Montreal Expos franchise moved to town before the 2005 season and was renamed the Nationals.\n\nUntil this season, the Nationals hadn\u2019t won a playoff series, going 0-4 since 2012, but they sure look as if they\u2019re making up for lost time.\n\n\u201cShoot, maybe we\u2019re finally coming around,\u201d third baseman Anthony Rendon said.\n\nIt all starts with the pitching.\n\nAgainst S\u00e1nchez in Game 1, the first hit for the Cardinals arrived with their 27th batter. Against Scherzer in Game 2, it was their 21st batter. But even when the Cardinals did something right against Strasburg, they erased it by doing something wrong.\n\nTheir fourth batter, Marcell Ozuna, doubled to the left field corner in the second, then quickly erased himself with some poor baserunning, going too far toward third on a comebacker and getting tagged out by Strasburg, who is enjoying a postseason to remember.\n\nHe was the No. 1 overall pick in the 2009 amateur draft, then was infamously shut down before the playoffs three years later to protect his surgically repaired right elbow. Strasburg is now hale and hearty, throwing 117 pitches Monday, his most since totaling 118 in a May 2017 game.\n\nAnd this sort of October excellence is what the Nationals were hoping for: Strasburg has a 3-0 record and 1.64 ERA, with 33 strikeouts and one walk - he didn\u2019t issue a free pass Monday - in 22 innings this postseason.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been a blast this year. It\u2019s been good to be around him. I\u2019ve seen him kind of transition into the guy he is now, dominant out on the field. He\u2019s definitely having fun in the clubhouse,\u201d Kendrick said. \u201cIt\u2019s special to see what he\u2019s doing this year.\u201d\n\nMuch to the delight of a red towel-twirling crowd of 43,675, Washington\u2019s batters kept delivering, led by Kendrick, who has eight RBIs in the past four games, including a 10th-inning grand slam in Game 5 of the NL Division Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nThe Nationals roughed up Jack Flaherty for four runs, all in the third inning; the Cardinals\u2019 23-year-old starter hadn\u2019t allowed that many in a game since July 2, a span of 18 appearances.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t been able to play our brand of baseball in full,\u201d Shildt said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been able to get in rhythm or sync, but we still have more baseball to play.\u201d\n\nSeven of Washington\u2019s eight runs came with two outs, and there were contributions from up and down the lineup: Ryan Zimmerman delivered two run-scoring hits, Victor Robles homered in his return after a five-game absence with a leg injury, and Rendon heard \u201cMVP!\u201d chants after a slick defensive play at third base and an RBI double.\n\n\u201cI think we put together some good at-bats. We got some guys on and some guys put some good swings on the ball,\u201d Kendrick said.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nNationals: CF Robles missed five postseason games with a strained right hamstring he hurt in Game 2 of the NLDS.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCorbin took the loss in each of Washington\u2019s two defeats this postseason. One was a start - in Game 1 of the NLDS, when he allowed just one unearned run, with nine strikeouts - and one came in relief. Corbin also came out of the bullpen to retire one Cardinals batter in Game 2 of the NLCS on Saturday.\n\nHudson, who turned 25 last month, joins Flaherty to give the Cardinals two starters that age or younger in the same postseason for the sixth time. In his only postseason start, in Game 4 of the Cardinals\u2019 NLDS against Atlanta, Hudson allowed one earned run in 4 2/3 innings and did not factor in the decision as St. Louis won 5-4 in 10 innings.\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Stephen Strasburg took his turn silencing the Cardinals' struggling bats, Nationals postseason star Howie Kendrick doubled three times and drove in three more runs, and Washington moved one win from the city's first World Series appearance in 86 years by beating St. Louis 8-1 Monday night to take a 3-0 lead in the NL Championship Series.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Howard Fendrich"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/14/nlcs_cardinals_nationals_baseball_49458_c0-114-2704-1691_s1200x700.jpg?fc366930ce005f887f0c0151ac4fe608bd277708", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
