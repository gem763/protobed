Beyond unsurprising restrictions on graphic nudity, sex and violence, China's censors can balk at anything from men wearing earrings to ghosts.\n\nIts censors also won't allow homosexuality to be depicted on screen, leading to controversy surrounding 2018's \"Bohemian Rhapsody.\" Even Rami Malek's Oscar acceptance speech for playing Freddie Mercury in the film was censored on one of China's biggest streaming networks.\n\nHowever, China's sensitivity on domestic political issues is what often causes some of the harshest \u2014 and, to Americans, most absurd \u2014 acts of censorship.\n\nPerhaps the most extreme example was the 2018 decision to not allow Disney's \"Christopher Robin\" to be released, purportedly because Chinese President Xi Jinping's resemblance to Winnie the Pooh had become a joke among activists who resisted the country's Communist regime.\n\nCensors also blocked the release of 2013's \"World War Z,\" amplifying the film's relative financial disappointment for its studio, Paramount. Theories for its ban range from a reference to the film's zombie outbreak starting in China to a Chinese shadow ban on its leading man, Brad Pitt, for starring in \"Seven Years in Tibet\" in 1997.\n\n2012's \"Red Dawn\" saw its entire original plot, which featured China invading America to reclaim its debt, rewritten after filming to feature North Korea as its enemy instead \u2014 and still couldn't get a Chinese release.\n\nMany American films do get released, but only with copious cuts to please the censors. While these usually involve slicing scenes of violence or sex, they often involve more politically-minded edits.\n\n2012's James Bond film \"Skyfall\" finally got released in China in 2013, but only after it cut references to prostitution in Macau and had its subtitles changed to mask references of torture by Chinese police.\n\nAnother popular franchise entry, 2007's \"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,\" had roughly 10 minutes of footage involving Chow Yun-fat's character cut over a determination that his portrayal somehow vilified the Chinese people.\n\nAnd 2006's \"Mission Impossible III\" had footage cut from its opening sequence \u2014 a Tom Cruise chase sequence in Shanghai \u2014 because censors believed the underwear hanging to dry on clotheslines presented the country in a bad light.\n\nThe bottom line: Despite the handwringing over China's economic ability to suppress Americans' freedom of speech, Hollywood film studios have willingly ceded their artistry to China's censors for years \u2014 on issues big and small \u2014 in pursuit of the almighty dollar.\n\nGo deeper: China's vise grip on corporate America", "description": "The NBA firestorm only highlights a long trend for America's premier cultural exporter.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/BgMRY1yzOK9IWb6b9R8_tuKCdZc=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/10/10/1570669376517.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
