That\u2019s how silly it is.\u201d\n\nTries by Samoan-born Timothy Lafaele, Kazuki Himeno, Kenki Fukuoka and Kotaro Matsushima in Toyota, plus 18 points from the boot of Yu Tamura, put Japan in control of their own destiny.\n\nHowever, Scotland lurk in a crunch fixture in Yokohama next weekend with the winners likely to progress, although the Six Nations side\u2019s short turnaround could prove key.\n\nJapan won three games at the 2015 World Cup under Eddie Jones and still failed to reach the knockout phase \u2014 a fact not lost on Joseph.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s game by game,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was always going to come down to the final match and it\u2019s building up to be a real ripper.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first time Japan\u2019s ever got themselves in the position where they can top the pool, so it\u2019s new territory for us,\u201d added Joseph.\n\n\u201cBut Scotland are a very, very good team with a lot of experience, a lot of X-factor and we saw how clinical they were beating Samoa last week.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Bit frantic\u2019 \u2013\n\nJapan struggled against Samoa\u2019s physicality as the Pacific islanders came out with a point to prove after being crushed 34-0 by the Scots.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely going to be a tough one,\u201d said winger Lomano Lemeki, looking ahead to next weekend.\n\n\u201cBut for the winner of this pool, it doesn\u2019t get easier \u2014 you play New Zealand or South Africa.\u201d\n\nThe hosts could also consider themselves fortunate that lock James Moore avoided a yellow card for a late hit on full-back Tim Nanai-Williams at the end of a tight first half.\n\n\u201cWe were a bit frantic in the first half,\u201d admitted Joseph.\n\n\u201cBut we showed incredible belief and worked to the very end.\u201d\n\nJoseph believes the Brave Blossoms have captured the hearts of a nation traditionally more interested in baseball and football.\n\nWhile every refereeing decision flashes up on the stadium screens with a bite-sized explanation, Japan\u2019s breathless rugby has indeed caught the public\u2019s imagination.\n\nThe noise when poster boy Matsushima darted in for Japan\u2019s bonus-point try in added time \u2014 his fourth of the tournament and 10th in his last nine Tests \u2014 was ear-splitting.\n\n\u201cThe Japanese public are really behind the team,\u201d beamed Joseph. \u201cIt makes us very proud. We\u2019re playing for 125 million people \u2014 most of them don\u2019t normally support rugby and they\u2019re right behind us.\u201d", "description": "Toyota City (Japan) (AFP) \u2013 Japan coach Jamie Joseph toasted the \u201cnever-say-die\u201d attitude of his players after the Rugby World Cup hosts", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/05/931343_japanese-public-got-team-joseph-urges-world-cup-hosts-japan-grasp-awesome-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
