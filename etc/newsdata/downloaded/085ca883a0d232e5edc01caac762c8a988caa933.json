Will Fake News NBC allow a McCarthy style Racist to continue? ABC fired Roseanne. Watch the double standard!\u201d\n\nMr. Trump plans a Sept. 17 fundraiser in Beverly Hills, California, which prompted Ms. Messing to call for the president\u2019s donors to be publicly disclosed. Hollywood has long served as a piggy bank for liberal candidates.\n\n\u201cWill and Grace\u201d co-star Eric McCormack has said his call last week for publicizing a list of Trump donors was \u201cmisinterpreted in a very upsetting way\u201d and that he doesn\u2019t support blacklists.\n\nThe feud prompted game-show host Pat Sajak to poke fun at Ms. Messing satirically Thursday on Twitter.\n\n\u201cI, like so many others, truly dislike ketchup on hotdogs, and I prefer not to be around anyone who uses ketchup on hotdogs,\u201d Mr. Sajak tweeted. \u201cI call upon all hotdog stands to post a list of those who ask for ketchup on their hotdogs.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
