And two former CIA officials who spoke with Yahoo Finance were skeptical of Kucherena\u2019s claims.\n\nLawyer Anatoly Kucherena shows a picture of fugitive and former U.S. spy agency contractor Edward Snowden in refugee documents granted by Russia in 2013. (Photo: Maxim Shemetov/Reuters)\n\n\u201cMy only sort of instinct is that [Kucherena] works for the security services and that's his talking point,\u201d John Sipher, a former CIA station chief in Moscow and former head of the agency's Russia operations, told Yahoo Finance. \u201dHe can't \u2026 say what he believes the truth is.\u201d\n\nSteven L. Hall, also a former chief of the CIA\u2019s Russia operations, said that anything akin to a normal tech job for Snowden was unlikely.\n\n\u201cMy assessment is that it would be very unusual, and I would say very doubtful, that the Russians would want to have him involved in anything like that,\u201d Hall told Yahoo Finance. \u201cBecause they're very dark, and they're very counterintelligence-aware.\u201d\n\nHall added that the Russians \u201cwould say, \u2018Look, let's be safe rather than sorry. Let's keep him away from all of that stuff so that we can maintain positive control over him.\u2019 So I think it's unlikely that he's legitimately working for a tech company in Russia, as I think Kucherena has indicated.\u201d\n\nKucherena\u2019s office previously told Yahoo Finance that he would discuss the inquiry about Snowden\u2019s employment with Snowden and respond with any relevant information. The office did not respond to follow-up inquiries.\n\nSnowden\u2019s new book mentions Kucherena only briefly, noting that the lawyer helped him obtain asylum and \u201cproved as adept at obtaining last-minute tickets to the opera as he is at navigating my legal issues.\u201d\n\nThe scant detail about Kucherena belies the well-connected lawyer\u2019s deep involvement in setting up Snowden\u2019s life in Russia.\n\nEdward Snowden captured the world\u2019s attention in June 2013 after he allegedly removed more than 1.5 million classified U.S. documents while working as a contractor for the NSA in Hawaii and then flying to Hong Kong, providing an estimated 200,000 documents to American journalists, identifying himself in a video published by the Guardian, providing more documents to the South China Morning Post, meeting with Russian officials, and flying to Moscow with WikiLeaks advisor Sarah Harrison on June 23, 2013.\n\nThe reverberation of his leaks are still being felt in the U.S. government \u2014 Congress will soon decide whether to extend the problematic NSA domestic phone records program that Snowden exposed \u2014 despite the American starting a new life once he arrived on Russia soil.\n\nSnowden and Harrison arrived at Moscow\u2019s Sheremetyevo International Airport and were promptly escorted off the flight operated by Aeroflot, Russia\u2019s largest airline and de facto national carrier. \"They were getting luggage straight from the plane into the car. It seemed a little strange. I saw three pieces of luggage,\" an American Aeroflot passenger told AFP at the time.\n\nA journalist shows a picture of Edward Snowden to airline passenger at the arrival gate of the Sheremetyevo International Airport in Moscow.

Snowden reappeared on July 12 at a press conference at the airport where he thanked countries that were supporting him and said he would seek asylum in Russia.\n\nEdward Snowden meets with representatives of human rights groups and Russian officials at Moscow's Sheremetyevo International Airport in July 2013.

Or as the Russians would refer to it: the legend of how Snowden is living out his life.\u201d\n\nSee also: Edward Snowden: The complicated man behind an epic heist\n\n\u2018He is almost out of money\u2019\n\nOn Aug. 1, 2013, Russia granted Snowden temporary asylum and Kucherena escorted Snowden out of the airport and to an undisclosed location. The lawyer, who claimed to be Snowden\u2019s \u201conly link with the outside world,\u201d told reporters that Snowden was running out of money.\n\n\u201cHe is not a rich person, and the money that he had he spent on food in the transit zone,\u201d Kucherena told reporters (translated from Russian). \u201cOf course he knows that going forward he has to work in order to live.\u201d\n\nAnatoly Kucherena, center, the Russian lawyer assisting Edward Snowden, enters a restricted area at Sheremetyevo airport in Moscow. (Photo: Maxim Shemetov/Reuters) More\n\nSnowden had told journalists in Hong Kong that he withdrew \u201cenough financial resources to survive on my own for years without anyone\u2019s assistance.\u201d But according to Kucherena, the former CIA technician was paying for bodyguards with his own money.\n\n\u201cSo far, he has been paying them himself from the money he had,\u201d Kucherena told RT when asked about the bodyguards in September 2013. \u201cBut \u2026 he is almost out of money.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear who provided security for Snowden. Former CIA analyst Ray McGovern, who visited Snowden in October 2013, told Reuters that he had to pass through metal detectors and some kind of official Russian security detail protected Snowden.\n\nExperts have long held that the FSB, which is responsible for Russia\u2019s domestic security and counterintelligence, are heavily involved in the American\u2019s ongoing asylum. In 2015, Kucherena said that Snowden lived under permanent protection. (Snowden\u2019s memoir makes no mention of bodyguards.)\n\nSnowden on a boat in 2013. (Photo: Russian media) More\n\n\u201c[The Russian government] may be charging him or forcing him to hire a 'friendly' private security firm,\u201d Mark Galeotti, a specialist on Russia\u2019s security services currently at the Institute of International Relations in Prague, told Yahoo Finance in an email. \u201cIf he can't afford it, I doubt the Russians wouldn't protect him, because 'security' in this context is as much about controlling as guarding him.\u201d\n\nA few days after Kucherena announced Snowden\u2019s job \u2014 declining to name the company \"for security reasons\u201d \u2014 he reiterated to reporters that the cost of Snowden\u2019s living expenses meant that he was almost broke.\n\n\u201cThe savings he had, he has almost entirely spent on food, rent, security, and so on,\u201d Kucherena reiterated in November 2013.\n\n\u2018He is a unique specialist; the company won't let him go\u2019\n\nThe country\u2019s largest internet companies denied that they had hired Snowden. VKontakte, the country\u2019s largest social media company, declined to comment on the news after the founder had previously offered Snowden a job.\n\n\u201cCurrently Edward tries to keep a low profile, and my offer was public: It could be a problem,\u201d VKontakte founder Pavel Durov, who fled Russia the following year after allies of Putin took control of the social media website, told a conference in Berlin at the time.\n\nIn the years that followed, Kucherena repeatedly told journalists that Snowden worked in IT. (The Russian lawyer also sold the rights to his novel about Snowden to filmmaker Oliver Stone for $1 million.) However, no evidence has emerged to corroborate Kucherena\u2019s assertions.\n\nRussian lawyer Anatoly Kucherena at a presentation of his book \u201cTime of the Octopus.\u201d (Photo: Russia media) More\n\nIn December 2014, Kucherena told Russian media that Snowden was \u201cworking as an IT consultant in one company.\u201d In February 2015, Kucherena told reporters: \"He has long worked for a Russian company. He is a unique specialist; the company won't let him go. ... His salary is commensurate with his skill level, so he has no problems making a living.\u201d In March 2015, Kucherena said: \"Edward is under protection, we take measures to ensure his safety. He is working and learning Russian.\u201d\n\nOn June 23, 2015, the two-year anniversary of Snowden arriving in Russia, Kucherena stated: \u201cToday he has now \u2014 if one can put it like this \u2014 settled in. \u2026 He is working in an IT company. We are not revealing this information, and it is understandable on what grounds. So today, I thank God, everything is fine. He is working. He is satisfied by the work he is doing.\u201d In January 2017, while announcing a three-year extension to Snowden\u2019s Russian residency permit, Kucherena said: \"He has not broken the law, he has a permanent job, so there are no grounds to deny [the extension].\"\n\nSnowden\u2019s main source of income in Russia, according to American lawyer Ben Wizner, came from being paid to speak to audiences via video chat. Snowden made more than $200,000 from speaking fees in 2015 and 2016, Yahoo News previously reported, including events at various American universities.\n\nIn Snowden\u2019s memoir, he notes his work with Freedom of the Press Foundation as a board member and then as president/chairman. Tax documents show he draws no salary and worked an average of five hours or less per week for the nonprofit organization from 2014 to 2017. Amid a relative slowdown in digital speaking appearances, Snowden\u2019s book likely provided him with a further source of income.\n\nHowever, the U.S. government filed a civil lawsuit against Snowden and the publisher, Macmillan, in an attempt to \u201crecover all proceeds earned by Snowden because of his failure to submit his publication for pre-publication review in violation of his alleged contractual and fiduciary obligations.\u201d\n\nEdward Snowden's new memoir, \"Permanent Record.\" (Photo: Macmillan Publishers) More\n\n\u2018He is a sort of ghost\u2019\n\nSnowden\u2019s new book does not provide many details about his life in Russia, beyond stating that he lives in a two-bedroom apartment with his partner, Lindsay Mills, travels within Russia\u2019s borders, and picks up Burger King.\n\nAnd despite the world-famous American\u2019s assertions that he rides \u201cthe subway like everybody else,\u201d Snowden has rarely been photographed in public.\n\nThe only photographs of Snowden in public since he landed in Moscow were either published in 2013 and 2014 by Russian state media outlets or posted on Instagram by Mills (or, in another sighting, journalist Glenn Greenwald).\n\nIn his new book, Snowden recounts agreeing to being in a selfie taken by a young tourist at a museum in Moscow \u2014 and then immediately worrying that the photo would show up on social media. (It apparently never did.)\n\nA man who looks like Edward Snowden pushing a shopping cart. (Photo: Russian media) More\n\n\u201cHe is a sort of ghost,\u201d Russian investigative journalist Andrei Soldatov, who co-wrote definitive books on the post-Soviet security services and the history of the Russian internet, said about Snowden\u2019s new life as of November 2017. \u201cIt looks like he\u2019s there, but since he\u2019s banned from talking to Russian journalists or Moscow-based foreign journalists, \u2026 he speaks only to journalists coming specifically to interview him, so they are all approved [by the Russian government] in advance. So he is almost nowhere.\u201d\n\nSnowden writes in his memoir that he spends \u201ca lot of time in front of the computer.\u201d During some of the more than 200 digital appearances while in exile, Snowden has said that he primarily lives on the internet.\n\n\u201cI have to lay my head down in Moscow on a pillow at night,\u201d he told an Israeli audience in November 2018, \u201cbut I live on the internet and every other city in the world.\u201d\n\nSnowden appears via connection from Russia during the Wired Next Fest 2019 in Milan, Italy. (Photo: Rosdiana Ciaravolo/Getty Images) More\n\n\u2018They can always run that stuff by him\u2019\n\nIn the end, the veracity of Kucherena\u2019s statements about his client\u2019s purported job may not matter if the lawyerly assertions serve the interests of Russian authorities.\n\n\u201cWhat they want to do is continue with this fiction that somehow Snowden is ... a normal individual,\u201d Hall said. And a Russian lawyer assigned to someone like Snowden, Sipher explained, would \u201close their job and lose their ability to have clients if they did not work in concert with the FSB. ... it's impossible that [Kucherena] is not working directly for, or in concert with, the security services.\u201d\n\nThe most important aspect of the situation to Kucherena, presumably, is Snowden\u2019s value to his Russian hosts.\n\n\u201cHe is a propaganda tool for them and a constant irritant to the United States and to the West,\u201d Hall said. \u201cThe other thing is that he would be very useful to them if they have ongoing questions. If some new system pops up, or some new question arises that he had expertise in previously, they can always run that stuff by him.\u201d\n\nMichael is an editor and head of audience development at Yahoo Finance.
