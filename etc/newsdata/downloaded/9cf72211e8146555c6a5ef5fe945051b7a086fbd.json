(AP) - Le\u2019Veon Bell has waited long enough.\n\nThe star running back will make his debut for the New York Jets on Sunday in the season opener against the Buffalo Bills. And, he\u2019s looking to pick up right where he left off 20 months ago.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t even explain it, bro,\u201d Bell said Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I played football. A lot of people are excited to watch me play. Just quadruple that. That\u2019s how excited I am to play.\u201d\n\nA lot has happened since Bell\u2019s previous appearance in a game that counted - back on Jan. 14, 2018, with Pittsburgh in the playoffs.\n\nHe sat out all last season in a contract dispute, became a free agent, signed a four-year, $52.5 million deal with the Jets in offseason and then went through the preseason without taking a snap in a game. So, when he takes the field for New York at MetLife Stadium, Bell wants to hit the ground running.\n\nLiterally.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t predict how many plays we\u2019re going to have, but I will say this: When I spoke to him (Tuesday), he said, \u2018Don\u2019t hold back,\u2019\u201d coach Adam Gase said. \u201cSo, he feels like he\u2019s ready to go and I think he\u2019s pretty excited to get out there.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s an understatement.\n\n\u201cI could carry 50 times if they ask me to,\u201d Bell said. \u201cWhen I said, \u2018Don\u2019t hold back,\u2019 I mean literally that. I don\u2019t want to go out here and (they) try to sprinkle me in or things like that. I\u2019m ready to play football. I\u2019ve been waiting a long time for this moment.\u201d\n\nWhen everyone most recently saw Bell in a game, he was perhaps the most versatile running back in the NFL. His 312 receptions since he entered the league in 2013 lead all running backs during that span. And, he ranks second with 7,996 yards from scrimmage.\n\nEven though he missed an entire season.\n\nBell\u2019s presence as a dual threat out of the backfield is evident particularly in one eye-popping stat: His 129 yards from scrimmage per game is the highest average in NFL history among players with at least 50 games played.\n\n\u201cHe can do everything, man,\u201d said safety Jamal Adams, who openly recruited Bell to join the Jets in the offseason. \u201cI strongly believe he changed the game, as far as running backs, with his stop and his acceleration, to stop on a dime, to have patience in the backfield, letting his backs clear, let his pulls clear.\n\n\u201cAnd, not only that, he can block and he can catch the ball. He\u2019s a hell of a teammate.\u201d\n\nBell knows all eyes will be on him Sunday, with fans eager to see if he\u2019s still that dynamic, dominant player who could change a game on one carry.\n\nThere have been plenty of skeptics along the way, wondering how the 27-year-old Bell could possibly be the same after such a lengthy layoff. Bell is aware of all that, and says it\u2019s \u201ckind of human nature\u201d for people to have their doubts. But, he\u2019s not concerned about any of that.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to prove anybody wrong,\u201d Bell insisted. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to prove the Steelers wrong. Everybody is trying to format me with the Steelers. I\u2019m not talking about the Steelers anymore. I\u2019m done talking about the Steelers. I want to worry about the Bills and I want to worry about the Jets. That\u2019s it.\n\n\u201cI want to go out there and prove to myself I\u2019m still the same player, if not better. I want to prove to my teammates I\u2019m the same player, if not better. And, the Bills. That\u2019s all that matters to me.\u201d\n\nBell can count his coach as a believer.\n\nGase raved all through training camp about how Bell is \u201cfootball smart\u201d and quickly picked up the playbook. Although Bell worked out on his own in Florida during the team\u2019s offseason workouts, he was in great shape for training camp and participated in every practice.\n\nGase said he has never coached a running back with as much talent as Bell - \u201cnot even close\u201d - and is fired up about having him in his offense.\n\n\u201cI love it,\u201d Gase said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be fun. It\u2019s one thing to call plays at practice, but to know that you have him back there and then possibly going back and watching some Pittsburgh tape just to remind ourselves who that is back there, it\u2019s a good feeling.\u201d\n\nAs far as Bell is concerned, that guy never left.\n\nSure, he\u2019s on a new team in new colors and in a new city. But, with the same fire he had 20 months ago.\n\n\u201cObviously, there\u2019s going to be a lot of butterflies, anxiety and nerves,\u201d Bell acknowledged. \u201cAll types of things are going to be hitting me before I hit the field. But when I get out there, when we run that first play, it\u2019s going to be gone.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be ready to play football.\u201d\n\nNOTES: WR Robby Anderson (calf), CB Trumaine Johnson (hamstring), G Brian Winters (shoulder) and WR/PR Braxton Berrios (hamstring) were limited at practice. \u2026 Darnold, S Jamal Adams, LT Kelvin Beachum, NT Steve McLendon, S Rontez Miles and LB C.J. Mosley were voted team captains by the players. \u2026 The Jets signed former Bengals WR Josh Malone to the practice squad.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Le'Veon Bell has waited long enough.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dennis Waszak Jr."], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/04/jets_preview_football_34614_c0-153-3648-2279_s1770x1032.jpg?bd537fada304e30c9d63c0bfcd3db5af8899a7bf"}
