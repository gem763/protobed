Yet even after the 2000 ceasefire, the town continued to poison relations when Ethiopia refused to comply with the internationally brokered Algiers Peace Accord, which included ceding Badme to Eritrea.\n\nYears of animosity and ill will followed, turning into decades.\n\nBut a week after Ethiopia\u2019s Badme announcement, Eritrea sent a delegation to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia\u2019s capital\u2014the ball was rolling.\n\nThen on July 8, Abiy became the first Ethiopian leader to visit Eritrea in nearly two decades. After touching down at the airport in Asmara, the Eritrean capital, Abiy embraced Isaias before conducting an official state visit during which Eritrean state television showed the two leaders smiling and laughing together.\n\n\u201cWe have agreed to open up embassies in our respective countries, allow our people to visit each other\u2019s cities, and allow our airlines and ports to operate freely,\u201d Abiy said at a banquet capping the historic visit and officially announcing the normalization of relations. \u201cLove is greater than modern weapons like tanks and missiles. Love can win hearts, and we have seen a great deal of it today here in Asmara.\u201d\n\nThis was followed in mid-July by Isaias making an equally historic visit to Ethiopia, where he reopened the Eritrean embassy in Addis Ababa as people danced and ululated in celebration.\n\nAbiy has swiftly turned Ethiopia\u2019s stagnant political scene on its head since coming to power in April after the shock resignation of his predecessor, which itself came after more than two years of anti-government protests that rattled the country.\n\nAbiy has introduced a wave of reforms, releasing journalists and opposition figures from prison and opening the state-run economy.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t peace between two ordinary neighbors,\u201d Hallelujah Lulie, a political analyst specializing in the Horn of Africa, posted on Twitter in response to the Asmara visit. \u201cEthiopia and Eritrea share complex memory and heritage. Recognizing their intertwined past and common destiny will have a positive political and socio-economic dividend for them, and will redraw the geopolitical map of the Horn.\u201d\n\nNearly 30 years ago, when Eritrea was Ethiopia\u2019s most northern province, the current leaders of the two countries were fellow rebels in the struggle against their nation\u2019s communist dictatorship. But after defeating that dictatorship and following a peaceful referendum that gave Eritrea its independence in 1993, relations began to sour over political and economic frictions.\n\nIn 1998, Eritrea invaded Badme, claiming that it was historically Eritrean land. Two years of fighting followed at a cost of more than $4 billion to the two already desperately poor countries, characterized by trench warfare that left more than 80,000 dead.\n\nBut even after the 2000 ceasefire, a state of war persisted due to the unresolved issue of Badme and the Algiers Peace Accord never being properly implemented.\n\nEthiopia and Eritrea became locked in their own Cold War of deadly subterfuge and smoke and mirrors, with significant regional fallout. Both countries engaged in proxy fights against the other in neighboring Somalia and South Sudan, helping to destabilize an already volatile region.\n\nThat appears to have finally changed. Abiy\u2019s reforming strategy includes, observers say, linking political, social, and economic transformation in Ethiopia to regional dynamics, with Eritrea a natural focus given how close the two countries are.\n\nAt the same time, Eritrea\u2019s relations with Arab countries, and even with the West, have improved, Hallelujah notes, making the Eritrean regime more open to rapprochement.\n\nBehind the scenes, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which have forged increasingly close ties with Eritrea over the past few years, have likely helped mediate and lay the groundwork for the breakthrough.\n\nThe West, on the other hand, has been roundly criticized for not doing more to heal the rift between Eritrea and Ethiopia, especially when the fallout was badly impacting the region.\n\nThe result of that strife was that Eritrea became increasingly isolated and subjected to international sanctions. Life was miserable for Eritreans\u2014hence the unending exodus of Eritrean refugees into Ethiopia or further afield to Europe\u2014as the Eritrean government grew increasingly repressive and militarized.\n\nBut lately the U.S. has signaled a shift in its dealings with Ethiopia, which some observers say may have influenced the Ethiopian government to be more conciliatory towards Eritrea.\n\nOn April 10, the House of Representatives unanimously adopted House Resolution 128, encouraging inclusive governance in Ethiopia with an emphasis on human rights.\n\nThe bill\u2014unusually outspoken in its criticism of Ethiopia\u2019s government\u2014though non-binding, will still be taken note of by the Ethiopians, observers say, due to the billions of dollars in financial aid that America provides to Ethiopia every year.\n\n\u201cThe passage of HR-128 by the U.S. House of Representatives without any opposition was a historical achievement,\u201d says Tewodrose Tirfe, chair of the Amhara Association of America, a U.S.-based advocacy group for the Amhara, Ethiopia\u2019s second largest ethnic group. \u201cThe Ethiopian-American community is finally understanding how the American democratic process works, and believe they can make a difference in Ethiopia by being engaged in the democratic process.\u201d\n\nThe formal end of hostilities between Ethiopia and Eritrea, and with it the vicious cycle it fed into, could clear the way for an end to mandatory conscription in Eritrea and even to reform in a country that\u2019s been called the North Korea of Africa due to its closed authoritarianism.\n\nBut even with relations between the two countries normalized, the complex process of returning disputed territory and figuring out what happens to those affected poses significant challenges, ever shadowed by the possibility of more disagreements flaring up.\n\n\u201cIt will be important to watch what happens when these two very different yet historically connected places draw closer to each other after all this time,\u201d says Jennifer Riggan, an associate professor of international studies at Arcadia University in Pennsylvania, who studies Eritrean refugees in Ethiopia. \u201cPeace with Ethiopia is not the same as political, human rights, and civil rights reforms in Eritrea, and until those are changed people will keep leaving the country.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, many watching the whirlwind of events remain optimistic that the shared history of the two countries, underpinned by a shared culture, religion, and familial ties, will overcome the differences.\n\nThousands of families separated by the war\u2014in particular those of mixed Ethiopian-Eritrean marriages\u2014could now be reunited. And beyond the obvious economic and political benefits of the detente could come psychological and emotional healing after decades of trauma and loss.\n\n\u201cMoving this quickly and firmly towards peace between the two countries is very emotional and emotionally important for the people of the two countries,\u201d Riggan says. \u201cIndeed, this conflict was never about people, but governments.\u201d\n\nJames Jeffrey is a freelance journalist who splits his time between the Horn of Africa, the U.S., and the UK, and writes for various international media.
