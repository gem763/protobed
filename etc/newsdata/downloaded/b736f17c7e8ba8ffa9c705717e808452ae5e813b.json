Many of them booked important family, holiday or business trips months ago. A further 120,000 are waiting to see if their flights on or around 27 September will be cancelled.\n\nBoth sides advance plausible cases: the British Airline Pilots\u2019 Association (Balpa) cites the sacrifices made by flight crew during the lean years. It rightly points to the impeccable professionalism and outstanding safety record of BA\u2019s pilots. The union says its members deserve a bigger share of the airline\u2019s recent impressive profits.\n\nBritish Airways counters that nine out of 10 employees \u2013 mainly ground staff and cabin crew \u2013 have already agreed to the inflation-beating pay offer. Any significant concession from BA to the pilots would trigger an immediate demand by the GMB and Unite unions for matching rises. London is both the world capital of aviation and the most ferociously competitive airline market on the planet, and no carrier can afford to have costs \u2013 and thus fares \u2013 out of line with its rivals.\n\nThe failure to find a settlement will, in the short term, slice around \u00a3100m from BA\u2019s profits purely from the direct loss of revenue and extra costs from the first two-day strike.\n\nTougher to quantify is the longer-term damage. Some hitherto-loyal customers will book away from an airline they perceive as prone to disruption. And exasperated passengers, caught in the crossfire between well-heeled foes who really should have the same direction of travel, may carry out their vows to switch to Virgin Atlantic or easyJet in the future.\n\nThis increasingly bitter dispute infuriates the 90 per cent of British Airways staff who fear the airline\u2019s profitability will be trashed. It does neither side any credit. But already the winners are clear: BA\u2019s rivals.\n\nYours,\n\nSimon Calder\n\nTravel correspondent", "description": "For years to come, the British Airways pilots\u2019 strike of 2019 will be cited in business-studies courses as a textbook example of industrial-relations hubris.
