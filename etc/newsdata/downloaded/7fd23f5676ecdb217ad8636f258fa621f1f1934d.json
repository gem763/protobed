Rooney Won\u2019t Rule Out Impeachment: It\u2019s \u2018Certainly Clear\u2019 There Was Quid Pro Quo", "language": "en", "text": "A day after \u201cacting \u201c White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney remarkably admitted military aid to Ukraine was contingent on their investigation into an insane conspiracy theory involving the 2016 election, Rep. Francis Rooney (R-FL) said that he could not rule out impeachment while saying Mulvaney laid out a \u201cclear\u201d quid pro quo.\n\n\u201cWhatever might have been gray and unclear before is certainly clear right now,\u201d Rooney told CNN\u2019s Poppy Harlow on Friday morning. \u201cThat the actions were related to getting someone in the Ukraine to do these things. As you put on there, Senator Murkowski said it perfectly: We\u2019re not to use political power and prestige for political gain.\u201d\n\nHarlow, meanwhile, wanted to know if Rooney felt this rose to the level of an impeachable offense.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something I can\u2019t answer,\u201d the Florida lawmaker replied. \u201cI\u2019ve been reading about this impeachment business. I\u2019m not really\u2014I went to law school but didn\u2019t practice law. I did read something today. That impeachment is whatever the House members and majority say it is. I guess anything is.\u201d\n\nThis prompted the CNN anchor to press Rooney on the issue of impeachment, noting that he had said it was \u201cvery clear\u201d there was a quid pro quo as it relates to Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I want to study it more,\u201d he responded. \u201cI want to hear the next set of testimony next week from a couple more ambassadors. But it\u2019s certainly very, very serious and troubling.\u201d\n\nHarlow continued to grill Rooney on why he was still unsure on the matter, causing the Republican congressman to say he still wants to see if this is \u201cgrave and serious\u201d enough to impeach the president.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this is as much as Richard Nixon did,\u201d Rooney continued. \u201cBut I\u2019m very mindful of the fact that back during Watergate everybody said it\u2019s a witch hunt to get Nixon. Turns out it wasn\u2019t a witch hunt but it was absolutely correct.\u201d\n\nMoments later, during a discussion on the situation in Syria and the bipartisan backlash the president has faced for abandoning America\u2019s Kurdish allies following Turkey\u2019s invasion, Rooney said he was worried about America\u2019s safety as Trump was ceding the Middle East to Russia.\n\n\u201cDo you agree at all with the assessment then from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in the private meeting with the president earlier this week where she reportedly said to him, \u2018Sir, all roads lead to Putin, lead to Russia.\u2019 Do you share that concern?\u201d Harlow wondered.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve read some of that,\u201d the GOP lawmaker answered. \u201cI was skeptical of it, like most Republicans. But I have to say this business about the Ukraine server, which no one heard about until it was mentioned recently, tells me what\u2014are we trying to exculpate Russia, who all our trained intelligence officials have consistently corroborated that Russia was behind the election meddling, not the Ukraine.\u201d\n\nAsked whether he agreed with Pelosi, the Republican eventually stated that \u201cshe has a point.\u201d\n\nRooney isn\u2019t the only potential crack in the Republican dam when it comes to impeachment. Following Mulvaney\u2019s disastrous comments, which he\u2019s since tried to walk back, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AL) said: \u201cYou don\u2019t hold up foreign aid that we had previously appropriated for a political initiative.\u201d\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGot a tip?
