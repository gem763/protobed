I certainly hope not.\u201d\n\nThe senator played golf with Trump, as well as professionals Gary Player and Annika S\u00f6renstam, at the president\u2019s club in Sterling, Virginia on Saturday morning, according to a White House pool report. It seemed likely Trump and Graham had plenty of time to strategise how to reclaim the political narrative.\n\nQ&A How do you impeach the US president? Show Hide Article 1 of the United States constitution gives the House of Representatives the sole power to initiate impeachment and the Senate the sole power to try impeachments of the president. A president can be impeached if they are judged to have committed \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\" \u2013 although the constitution does not specify what \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d are. The process starts with the House of Representatives passing articles of impeachment. A simple majority of members need to vote in favour of impeachment for it to pass to the next stage. Democrats currently control the house, with 235 representatives. The chief justice of the US supreme court then presides over the proceedings in the Senate, where the president is tried, with senators acting as the jury. For the president to be found guilty two-thirds of senators must vote to convict. Republicans currently control the Senate, with 53 of the 100 senators. Two presidents have previously been impeached, Bill Clinton in 1998, and Andrew Johnson in 1868, though neither was removed from office as a result. Richard Nixon resigned in 1974 before there was a formal vote to impeach him. Martin Belam\n\nGraham has changed his tune on impeachment. In 1998-99, as a member of the House of Representatives, he helped manage the impeachment of Democratic president Bill Clinton, insisting the process was \u201cabout restoring honor and integrity to the office\u201d.\n\nBut Graham distinguished himself in Trump\u2019s eyes a year ago with his furious defence of Brett Kavanaugh, whose nomination to the supreme court was almost derailed by allegations of sexual assault.\n\nOn Friday the senator sent a fundraising email to supporters that said: \u201cI can still remember the exact moment it started, one year ago today \u2026 I spoke from the heart against the false and uncorroborated accusations leveled against Brett Kavanaugh for political purposes.\u201d\n\nGraham added: \u201cMy remarks on the Democrats\u2019 despicable treatment of Justice Kavanaugh had struck a powerful chord with folks who enthusiastically supported President Trump\u2019s pick to our nation\u2019s highest court.\u201d\n\nYou can\u2019t even get a parking ticket based on hearsay testimony. But you can impeach a president? I certainly hope not Lindsey Graham\n\nThe email contained a photo of a smiling Graham with a distressed protester in the background, and the caption: \u201cStand with me against the left\u2019s angry mobs!\u201d\n\nGraham, who chairs the Senate judiciary committee, will appear on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation on Sunday, along with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, a key figure in the impeachment inquiry given his attempts to pressure Ukraine.\n\nThe New York Post\u2019s PageSix reported that Graham was overheard on a flight coordinating talking points with the White House.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re told that the South Carolina pol was on a JetBlue flight from Washington DC, to Charleston and was chatting loudly with \u2018Jared\u2019 \u2013 presumably White House adviser Jared Kushner \u2013 before takeoff,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cIt was a \u2018full-blown, loud conversation\u2019 according to an airborne spy. \u2018His phone rang and he answered, \u201cHey, Jared!\u201d He was \u2026 saying he\u2019s going to be on Face the Nation on Sunday. He said, \u201cListen \u2013 this is what I\u2019m going to lay out,\u201d\u2019 we\u2019re told.\u201d\n\nQ&A What is the Trump-Ukraine whistleblower scandal? Show Hide On 25 July, US president Donald Trump called Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. During the course of the call he reportedly asked the Ukrainian leader eight times to investigate former US vice-president Joe Biden and Biden\u2019s son Hunter. It is additionally reported that Trump ordered his staff to withhold nearly $400m in aid to Ukraine days before the call took place. Biden is one of the frontrunners to win the Democratic nomination and take on Trump in the 2020 presidential election. Trump confirmed he discussed the Bidens with Zelenskiy, and accused the pair \u2013 without offering any evidence \u2013 of corruption. A US intelligence community whistleblower filed a report after becoming alarmed at Trump\u2019s behaviour in the matter. The White House refused to release the substance of the whistleblower complaint, setting up a confrontation with Congress over the release of information. Complaints of this nature are usually reported to Congress within seven days. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, has admitted asking the Ukrainians to investigate the Bidens. It is illegal for a political campaign to accept a \u201cthing of value\u201d from a foreign government. Democrats say an investigation into a political opponent \u2013 for which Trump appears to have been pushing \u2013 would amount to a thing of value.\n\nThe report added that Graham was overheard saying: \u201cThis is Kavanaugh on steroids! This is hearsay \u2013 and this person has bias.\u201d\n\nGraham and others might find the Ukraine case tougher than Kavanaugh or the Mueller report, which summed up special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation of Russian election interference, links between Trump and Moscow and possible obstruction of justice by the president.\n\nDavid Brock, a political activist and founder of the progressive watchdog Media Matters for America, told the Guardian: \u201cTheir playbook is very predictable. It\u2019s one we\u2019ve seen before. We\u2019re seeing it play out now. But I do think that they\u2019re dealing with a weaker hand this time and at least so far they\u2019re struggling to find a counter-narrative they would like to tell.\n\nThey\u2019re struggling to find a counter-narrative \u2026 they\u2019re throwing a lot at the wall to see what sticks David Brock\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they have it yet and so it feels like they\u2019re throwing a lot at the wall to see what sticks but there\u2019s not as much of a coordinated counter-offensive as there has been in the past.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s because they\u2019re overwhelmed with the reality of what this complaint says and it\u2019s very hard to spin your way out of it. They\u2019re certainly trying but I wonder about the effectiveness of it.\u201d\n\nTrump continued to punch back on Saturday, branding Democrats \u201csavages\u201d. He tweeted: \u201cCan you imagine if these Do Nothing Democrat Savages \u2026 had a Republican party who would have done to Obama what the Do Nothings are doing to me. Oh well, maybe next time!\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Lindsey Graham speaks to the media on Capitol Hill. Photograph: Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA\n\nGraham may find it difficult to target Biden, an old friend. And his bellicose defence of Trump represents a striking u-turn. In May 2016 the former Republican primary candidate and close friend of late senator John McCain wrote on Twitter: \u201cIf we nominate Trump, we will get destroyed \u2026 and we will deserve it.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats are determined to move fast. On Friday they issued subpoenas demanding documents from secretary of state Mike Pompeo and scheduling legal depositions for other state officials.\n\nTrump's 'spy' comments are not far off from real US whistleblower policy Read more\n\nOn Saturday, Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, expressed concern over a Washington Post report that the White House restricted access to the transcript of a 2017 Oval Office meeting in which Trump told two senior Russian officials he was unconcerned about interference in the 2016 election because the US did the same in other countries.\n\nIf true, Schumer said, the reports \u201care extremely harmful to both our national security and the integrity of our elections. It\u2019s one of the most disturbing things we\u2019ve learned yet.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe White House should immediately provide the congressional intelligence committees with all the records of that meeting so we can get to the bottom of it.\u201d\n\nTrump tried to defend himself by sharing an old report in which his then national security adviser, HR McMaster, described conversation as \u201cwholly appropriate\u201d.\n\nThe president wrote: \u201cThank you to General McMaster.
