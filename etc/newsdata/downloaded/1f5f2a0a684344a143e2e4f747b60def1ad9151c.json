New York-based private school consultants told the Daily Beast they\u2019ve received dozens of calls from frantic WeGrow parents scrambling to find spots for their children in the city\u2019s byzantine web of exclusive educations.\n\n\u201cYet another dumb idea for a school is closing,\u201d said Amanda Uhry, founder and CEO of Manhattan Private School Advisors. \u201cAnd the parents are desperate.\u201d\n\nShe said her company has received between 10 and 20 calls from WeGrow parents. The school enrolled roughly 100 students ages 2 to 11 and charged as much as many universities\u2014between $26,000 and $48,000.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re furious,\u201d she added. \u201cThey\u2019re kicking themselves for getting involved.\u201d\n\n\u201cWeGrow has stranded a number of parents,\u201d said Max Mets, a partner at New York Private School Consultants. \u201cThey\u2019re very concerned, to say the least.\u201d\n\nMets said his firm has also been receiving calls from WeGrow parents in the past two weeks, and some have worried the school may close sooner than the end of the school year. Neither consultant made their clients available for interviews, citing non-disclosure agreements. Neither WeGrow parents nor the school responded to requests for comment.\n\n\u201cIf the parents don\u2019t have a connection or point of entry at another private school, they may need to enroll their students in public school,\u201d Mets said.\n\nWeGrow offered a bevy of seemingly unrelated curricular options\u2014Hebrew, weekly field trips to a Neumann-owned farm, a daily yoga routine dubbed WePractice\u2014in a designer Chelsea facility detailed on the school\u2019s half-finished website.\n\nRun by Rebekah Paltrow Neumann, wife of former WeWork CEO Adam Neumann and cousin of Goop\u2019s Gwyneth Paltrow, WeGrow was designed to be a \u201cconscious entrepreneurial school\u201d\u2014a project she started after turning up her nose at available schooling options for the five Neumann children.\n\n\u201cMaking the wife the head of the school? Please! The woman had no experience,\u201d Uhry lamented.\n\nShe said parents should have been more cautious in their embrace of WeGrow.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re shocked, but I\u2019m shocked they sent their kids there. You\u2019re making a deal with the devil when you send them to a school like this, a brand new one. You give a school like this five years to see if everything they say is true,\u201d Uhry said.\n\nAs WeGrow parents scramble, Adam Neumann, WeWork\u2019s co-founder and former CEO, could walk away from the company with as much as $1.7 billion.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, Japanese mega-corporation Softbank\u2014WeWork\u2019s largest investor\u2014will buy nearly $1 billion of Neumann\u2019s shares in the company, furnish him with a $500 million credit line to repay a loan, and pay him a $185 million consulting fee. The deal with the former CEO values the company at $8 billion, an order of magnitude less than the $47 billion valuation the company hovered around in January.\n\nThe Softbank takeover comes as WeWork\u2019s low cash reserves hang by a thread; the company was recently forced to delay layoffs because it couldn\u2019t afford severance costs, the Journal reported.\n\nNeumann will also step down from the board. He resigned as CEO in September amid a fiasco of an initial public offering, when Wall Street investors balked at both his management style and the company\u2019s growing losses. His wife resigned from WeWork and WeGrow at the same time.\n\nNew schools in New York City, Uhry said, don\u2019t often stay open. The competition is fierce. She compared WeGrow to other high-profile private schools that closed or sold in recent years and left students in similar situations\u2014Mandell, Basis, and AltSchool, to name a few.\n\nThe students\u2019 prospects, however magical their WeGrow education, seem grim to the consultants. Private schools in New York City admit most students in kindergarten, sixth grade, and ninth grade, the advisers told The Daily Beast, and few spots are available for first-through-fourth graders changing schools. WeGrow\u2019s close, Mets said, puts students at a \u201chigh disadvantage.\u201d Applications are typically due in March, and how much assistance WeGrow will provide with next year\u2019s placements remains unclear.\n\nSharon Thompson, CEO of the education consultancy Dream Workshop, said WeGrow parents will likely find open slots for their children at schools similar to their old one.\n\nWeGrow\u2019s students were largely children of WeWork employees or on scholarship and Rebekah Neumann told CNN that bringing employees closer to their children was one of the school\u2019s big goals.\n\n\u201cA for-profit school that\u2019s new and not particularly prestigious. Those are the types of places that have space,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are parents who went to an experimental school, but what WeGrow offered more than anything else was convenience.\u201d\n\nThe parents may be the ones making panicked calls, but it\u2019s students who will suffer the disruption, Uhry said.\n\n\u201cThe kids will be the collateral damage when the school closes,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m scared for some of these parents. Who knows where they\u2019ll get in when this is over?\u201d", "description": "One education consultant likened signing up for WeGrow to \u201ca deal with the devil.\u201d", "authors": ["Blake Montgomery"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_675,w_1200,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571801230/191022-hatmaker-wegrow-tease_wpyfzd", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
