That's life and death. Our problems are playing a game we enjoy.\n\n'For me to hear about the news was upsetting, as it's a place close to my heart. I'm sure it was upsetting for a lot of people from a Pakistani Kashmir background.'\n\nRashid (right) celebrates taking the wicket of Anton Devcich of a New Zealand XI during the first of England's warm-up games ahead of the Twenty20 series\n\nRashid has revealed how a visit to his ancestral home of Kashmir, which was struck by a devastating earthquake in September, put his injury troubles into perspective\n\nEngland's T20 schedule UK times shown Final warm-up match Tuesday New Zealand XI (12am, Lincoln) T20 series Friday Game One (1am, Christchurch) Sunday Game Two (1am, Wellington) November 5 Game Three (1am, Nelson) November 8 Game Four (5am, Napier) November 10 Game Five (1am, Auckland)\n\nRashid assisted Birmingham-based charity Islamic Relief while he was there. He told the BBC: 'I helped them hand out kit and went round seeing the areas that were damaged.'\n\nHaving been the leading ODI wicket-taker between the 2015 and 2019 World Cups, Rashid was never at his best during the competition. He finished with 11 wickets at a modest 47, and cost 5.71 an over \u2013 more than any of his team-mates.\n\nBut he insisted: 'Even if my shoulder was falling off, I'd have been keen to play. I had to find a way. If I didn't take the injection, I don't reckon I would have played a part because it was actually that bad.'\n\nThe suggestion from the England camp is that he is still operating at only 85 per cent, though the wrong'un which lured the Tim Seifert to his doom on Sunday was good news for the tourists.\n\nRashid practises his bowling during an England net session in Lincoln over the weekend\n\nEven so, Rashid admitted: 'I've still not quite got my snap that I would like. Hopefully that will come as time goes on \u2013 maybe before the first T20.'\n\nEngland are scheduled to play their second and final warm-up game in Lincoln tonight/last night, with the five-match series starting in Christchurch on Friday.", "description": "LAWRENCE BOOTH IN CHRISTCHURCH: Adil Rashid has described how a trip to his ancestral home in earthquake-hit Kashmir helped him rediscover his perspective after a tough summer.", "authors": ["Lawrence Booth For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/06/20268810-0-image-a-26_1572243484170.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
