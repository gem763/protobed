You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIn an appeal to the powerful, the open letter said: \"We do not want the powerful to force on the people a Brexit that will damage the economy in both the UK and the EU, threaten the peace process in Northern Ireland, as well as lead to years more uncertainty and chaos.\n\n\"Please do not turn your back on this last chance to stop us turning in on ourselves.\n\n\"Allow us to check whether we want to proceed with this Brexit. Let us decide in a People's Vote.\"\n\nThe Independent has been campaigning for a Final Say referendum since 2018, a fight which has secured the backing of more than 1.3 million people.\n\nBefore the final Brexit deadline, the open letter will be delivered to Downing Street and the parliament, as well as the European parliament and the Consilium Building in Brussels where the European Council meets.\n\nMPs will be also be sent a list of signatories from their constituencies.\n\nIt comes ahead of a make-or-break week for the prime minister, as he tries to push his Brexit deal through parliament before the 31 October deadline.\n\nMr Johnson's efforts to secure MPs backing for his plan were spectacularly derailed at an historic Saturday Commons sitting, when the Commons backed a rebel amendment by Sir Oliver Letwin to withold approval until the full Brexit legislation has passed.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
