The former senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has a lot to say to the House of Representatives, and none of it will make the Trump administration look good. The question will be just how bad it might get:\n\nMichael McKinley, the former senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo until his sudden resignation last week, will tell House impeachment investigators Wednesday that career diplomats were mistreated during his tenure and some had their careers derailed for political reasons, according to a person familiar with his testimony. McKinley will outline how his concerns culminated with the recall of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, a punitive action he and many other rank-and-file diplomats viewed as wholly unjustified. \u201cThe unwillingness of State Department leadership to defend Yovanovitch or interfere with an obviously partisan effort to intervene in our relationship with Ukraine for the political benefit of the president was too much for him,\u201d said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to be candid.\n\nMcKinley left the job last Friday after 37 years of work at the State Department. Pompeo never bothered to thank him for his work, which says something about the relationship between the two within Foggy Bottom. However, McKinley won\u2019t directly go after Pompeo in his opening remarks, according to the Washington Post\u2019s source:\n\nThe person familiar with McKinley\u2019s statement said the veteran diplomat will not criticize Pompeo directly, though he will discuss his concern over the politicization of the agency in the Trump administration.\n\nHow would that work? If Donald Trump is politicizing the State Department, he\u2019s not doing it by moving into the Secretary of State\u2019s offices. That kind of effort would require at least the cooperation of Pompeo, if not his outright direction. Otherwise, it sounds more like people at State are acting as if rather than being directed \u2014 acting as if Trump\u2019s electoral politics are the highest priority, acting as if they are receiving directives. That could very well be true, but it\u2019s not going to stick in an impeachment, where overt actions are needed to effectively establish wrongdoing.\n\nThat might just be an opening position in McKinley\u2019s testimony, however. He didn\u2019t resign his 37-year position just to offer the House a 30,000-foot view of the State Department, which he could have done while remaining employed. His resignation is clearly a protest, and that protest reflects those above him in the organization \u2014 and there were few if any people besides Pompeo above McKinley at State.\n\nOne has to wonder whether McKinley\u2019s resignation and quick turnaround as an impeachment inquiry witness prompted this development today:\n\nIn a surprise, Kurt Volker returned to the House SCIF where members had been gathered to question former Pompeo adviser Michael McKinley \u2014 Manu Raju (@mkraju) October 16, 2019\n\nOther reports had Volker returning to review his previous testimony. That\u2019s usually something a witness does when they think they have misstated a material fact and need to correct the record before a perjury charge gets leveled. Perhaps it\u2019s just a coincidence, but McKinley\u2019s sudden change of status might mean that Volker\u2019s worried about whether McKinley will contradict him.\n\nPerhaps it has something to do with Volker\u2019s membership in the \u201cThree Amigos\u201d on Ukraine policy, which the Washington Post reported this morning. Volker was the only State Department figure in a triumvirate that managed Ukraine policy, and it was chief of staff Mick Mulvaney rather than Pompeo that was in charge:\n\nActing White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney organized a meeting this spring in which officials were determined to take Ukraine policy out of the traditional channels, putting Energy Secretary Rick Perry, U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland and special U.S. envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker in charge instead, a top State Department official told lawmakers Tuesday. George Kent, the deputy assistant secretary of state responsible for Ukraine, told House investigators he was instructed to \u201clay low,\u201d focus on the five other countries in his portfolio and defer to Volker, Sondland and Perry \u2014 who called themselves the \u201cthree amigos\u201d \u2014 on matters related to Ukraine, Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.) told reporters Tuesday. Kent took that as a sign, Connolly added, that having been critical of the plan he was being pushed aside \u201cbecause what he was saying was not welcome\u201d at high levels of the government. Mulvaney\u2019s meeting, which Kent told lawmakers took place on May 23, according to Connolly, was just days after the administration recalled Marie Yovanovitch from her post as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. Yovanovitch spoke to House investigators last week about the campaign against her, which she and other former diplomats have said was organized by President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani.\n\nMcKinley would certainly have been in position to see that unfold, as well as what it produced and what its objectives were. That might have made Volker nervous enough to review what he told the House panels earlier.\n\nStill, this leaves some dots unconnected. Presidents have wide latitude in diplomacy and can deputize even \u201cprivate\u201d citizens for diplomatic missions. That\u2019s why Giuliani\u2019s presence in Ukraine alone isn\u2019t a violation, although given how it\u2019s turned out it wasn\u2019t a great idea either. Two of the \u201cThree Amigos\u201d have been confirmed by the Senate for their current positions, and Mulvaney has an official administration position \u2014 more than one, in fact. If Trump trusts them more than some State Department officials to run his Ukraine diplomacy, that\u2019s well within his authority to decide.\n\nFurthermore, presidents have wide latitude to deploy their political agendas through administrative agencies, and State more than most thanks to diplomacy being almost entirely an executive-branch function. Those policies and actions can certainly be scrutinized and criticized, but punishment for unpopular agendas comes most properly from the voters who elected the president. To act otherwise is to transform Congress into a parliament and the executive as its subordinate branch, which would directly conflict with the Constitution.\n\nIf, however, the House can establish as a fact that Trump was using congressionally appropriated aid as an explicit quid pro quo for his own electoral purposes, that\u2019s an argument for an abuse of power rising to the level of an impeachment. So far, though, no one\u2019s substantiated that, and at least from the Washington Post\u2019s description of McKinley\u2019s testimony, he\u2019s not going to offer anything like that.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say he won\u2019t offer testimony that might be politically damaging to Trump, but it will likely fall more into the \u201coppo research for 2020\u201d column than legitimately impeachable conduct. That\u2019s still good enough reason for the White House to be very worried about his deposition today, and perhaps for Volker and others to ask for a second look at their earlier testimony.", "description": "Plus: The return of an Amigo?", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/trump-pompeo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
