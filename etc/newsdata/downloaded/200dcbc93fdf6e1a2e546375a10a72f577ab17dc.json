It is a less commoditized approach, which should give them early access to some exciting categories,\u201d the analyst wrote in a note to clients. He highlighted the company\u2019s partnership with brewer Molson Coors TAP, +0.77% as one that offers an early mover advantage in cannabis drinks.\n\nRead: Sundial sued in U.S. for failing to disclose half-ton of cannabis was returned by client\n\nKirk reiterated his buy rating on the stock and C$12 price target.\n\nIn a separate note published Thursday, Kirk said the black market in Canada is thriving a year into legalization \u2014 and that\u2019s bad news for the big licensed producers. Provinces are too slow in opening stores and the price gap with legal weed is widening.\n\nOn Wednesday, Statistics Canada released crowdsourced price data for the black and legal markets and found an average legal price in the third quarter of C$10.23 a gram, almost double the black market average price of C$5.59 a gram.\n\n\u201cWith surveyed consumers showing a strong sensitivity to price, we believe the widening of these price gaps limits the growth and addressable market for current legal product offerings. In combination with slower provincial buying and delayed Ontario openings, we still believe 3Q results for Canadian LPs will likely fall short of consensus expectations,\u201d Kirk wrote.\n\nTilray Inc.

Cherney reported. McConnell is attending at least two days\u2019 worth of meetings with industry executives and advocates in the Golden State to discuss possible banking reform, among others issues, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\n\u201cI think this is absolutely positive that McConnell is meeting with stakeholders in the cannabis market,\u201d PI Financial analyst Jason Zandberg told MarketWatch. \u201cThe U.S. market needs the banking act to flourish, without it \u2014 there are legitimate companies that are following the rules that are facing major obstacles. Banking legislation would be a huge positive catalyst.\u201d\n\nFor more on this, read: Mitch McConnell meets with pot execs in California, pitched need for cannabis banking reform\n\nElsewhere in the sector, Green Organic Dutchman shares TGODF, -18.04% TGOD, -18.88% fell 13%, a day after the company said it\u2019s reviewing its financing options for the completion of construction at two facilities.
