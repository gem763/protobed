The Guerrillas in the Mist skill \u2014 which added a 50 per cent critical damage boost for eight seconds \u2014 is being reduced to a 25 per cent boost for six seconds.\n\nFL4K mains will have to take it for a spin to be sure, but this nerf doesn\u2019t seem as though it kills FL4K\u2019s crit builds, just thins the insane performance lead they have over every other option in the game.\n\nA few of the less-appealing weapon types that have become a joke in the last two weeks are also getting a leg up. Maliwan weapons, for example, were widely derided for their trademark elemental stat boost hardly being worth their low damage and the charge time required to fire them. They\u2019ll be getting a 25 per cent damage boost, while their fire rate will be upped 20 per cent.\n\nThe hotfix also comes on the heels of the first major Borderlands 3 patch, released yesterday. It was a more wide-ranging update, tweaking UI glitches, fixing optional boss Killavolt\u2019s overpowered Shield Storm attack and nerfing the popular Porcelain Pipe Bomb grenade mod.\n\nUpdates such as these underscore that while Borderlands 3 feels very much like its predecessors, Gearbox is effectively treating Borderlands 3 like a live service game, balancing its characters, gear and loot drop rates as needed \u2014 as well as fixing some weird problems that the game shipped with, such as how often your character screams when suffering from elemental damage. (Thank God.)\n\nHopefully these updates and seasonal events like next month\u2019s Halloween-themed Bloody Harvest event keep Borderlands 3 interesting and well-balanced for a good long time.", "description": "Borderlands 3 players disappointed in Zane\u2019s endgame performance, don\u2019t give up your main yet: The Operative is about to get a pretty nice buff....", "authors": ["Jackson Ryan", "Alex Walker"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/rpoc8wfhn2vfxlbo73bq.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
