Maybe you weren't really into sports but they insisted you go out and play.\n\nMaybe they had you in a summer project group. But if they sent you for music lessons, you should thank them for it.\n\nSure, you probably argued with your parents as a kid about not wanting to go, maybe you wanted to be doing other things rather than learning the piano or guitar or what have you. Maybe just practicing it over and over was seriously boring. But as it turns out they had the right idea. Because science indicates that all those hours you spent at class or poring over music sheets actually did some good. Scientists have often said, with various studies, that learning music improves your cognitive abilities in surprising ways. So here are some of the things you may have working for you because of music, according to science.\n\n1. Your reading and verbal skills got better\n\nMultiple studies have found that there seems to be a strong connection between a child's ability to process the pitch of a music, and their ability to process language. One study from the Northwestern University for instance theorized that there are five key skills that govern how well we learn a language: \"phonological awareness, speech-in-noise perception, rhythm perception, auditory working memory and the ability to learn sound patterns.\"\n\nIn their study, they had a group of kids assigned to reading lessons, while some also received a random assignment of musical training, painting, and other visual arts. They found that the kids learning music outperformed all the others when it came to reading.\n\n2. Music may have raised your IQ\n\nThough you would think music would more likely affect your empathy, it actually encourages the growth of a kid's IQ more than EQ. Numerous studies claim it makes you smarter in general, even if music lessons don't turn you into Einstein.\n\n3. Mathematics becomes a breeze\n\nWhat many people don't realise is that music has math baked into it. Especially if you're learning to read music, you know that it's all a bunch of symbols denoting time, like how long you hold a note, or what rhythm to keep. And it's been shown that even this kind of exposure to math in music is enough to give kids a boost in the subject in school.\n\nOne study mentions how when groups of first graders were given music instruction including skill development and musical games involving rhythm and pitch, they scored significantly better in math after just six months. Another from UCLA showed that while kids involved in the arts tended to develop faster academically than those not, and those involved in music saw the most gains, all the way up to Grade 12. \"We have some pretty good data that music instruction does reliably improve spatial-temporal skills in children over time,\" says Dr Kyle Pruett, a clinical professor of child psychiatry at Yale School of Medicine. \"These skills come into play in solving multistep problems one would encounter in architecture, engineering, math, art, gaming, and especially working with computers.\"\n\n4. Your exam scores were probably better for it\n\nIn 2007 Christopher Johnson, a professor of music education and music therapy at the University of Kansas, carried out a study on elementary schools. He found that those with better music education programs had their kids on average score 22 percent higher in English and 20 percent higher in Math. Another study from Canada years later in 2013 reached the same conclusion.\n\n5. You pick up languages faster\n\nOther studies also say that kids learning to develop musical ability also improve the speed at which they learn the vocabulary of a new language. Not just the first language a kid learns either, but all of them that follow. One of those studies was even co-written by a researcher at Christ University in Bangalore, and the authors they say music saw improvements in the language-learning abilities of Indian kids as well,\n\n6. You learn how to listen better\n\nAside from learning how to play, music also teaches you to listen carefully for changes in rhythm, key, and more. Scientists believe this practice can help stave off peripheral hearing loss, which is when the transmission of sound through the outer or middle ear canal is impeded. This kicks in during old age, but people used to listening intently to music are a little bit better off there too.\n\n7. It will slow the effects of aging\n\nJust as musical training has shown to improve cognitive development, it's also shown to help delay cognitive decline from aging. Emory University in a study found that even if musicians stop playing as they age, the training has rewired their neurons in such a way that they usually perform better at memory exercises than non-musicians. However, these changes required at least 10 years of musical experience to take effect.\n\n8. It improved your working memory\n\nEven your current day short-term memory benefits from music, according to one 2013 study. It found that, since practicing and repeating a piece of music is a great workout for your short-term memory, it slowly strengthens its effectiveness over time.\n\n9. Music helps manage stress\n\nAccording to researchers at the University of Vermont College of Medicine, playing an instrument can help you suffer less from anxiety. Not just using the hobby as a relaxation method either. Brain scans of musicians between the ages of 6 through 18 revealed a thickening in the cortex areas related to depression, aggression and attention problems. Basically, the part of their brains that helps manage these negative emotions got more powerful.\n\n10. A tune or two can boost your self-esteem\n\nMultiple studies have indicated that kids that learn to play music have better self-confidence than those that don't. And if your kid has good self-esteem, they're automatically more likely to try their hand at challenging new things, in school and out.\n\n11. Your creativity is through the roof\n\nCreativity is a little hard to measure, but scientists still believe that the inherent nature of music makes a practitioner more creative. One study from the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm found that people with long-term experience in music and improvisation had more activity in the areas of their brain associated with creativity. Music training also enhances communication between the right and left hemispheres of the brain. Indeed, they say this could also mean that learning music could be a good way to promote motor recovery after a stroke or disease.", "description": "Parents often like to foist extracurricular activities on their kids.
