The discovery was made public a day later.\n\n\u201cWe collectively ask that the media not pass judgment on the Klopfer family,\u201d Sheriff Kelley said Thursday, adding that they have been cooperating with investigators.\n\nWill County officials said there is no evidence Klopfer performed abortions on the property. They will hand off further police work to law enforcement in Indiana, where Klopfer operated three abortion clinics between 2000 and 2002, the time period the remains have been forensically dated to.\n\n\u201cThis is still an open investigation,\u201d Sheriff Kelley said. \u201cWe\u2019ve concluded what we can do here in Illinois.\u201d\n\nAsked if the state should press charges, Will County Prosecutor James W. Glasgow responded curtly: \u201cIf Mr. Klopfer did something wrong, it\u2019s irrelevant because he can\u2019t be prosecuted.\u201d\n\nKlopfer died Sept. 3 of natural causes, according to Will County Coroner Patrick K. O\u2019Neil.\n\nIndiana outlaws transferring fetal remains across state lines and the non-burial of fetal tissue. Officials did not say when they believed Klopfer transferred the fetal remains to his garage.\n\nIllinois law does not mandate burial for fetal remains or medical waste.\n\nAsked how investigators determined 2000 to 2002 as the period during which the fetal remains were aborted, Will County officials called that information \u201cprivileged.\u201d\n\nAccording to the family\u2019s attorney, Kevin Bolger, Klopfer\u2019s widow and sister did not know the contents of the boxes.\n\nKlopfer ran abortion clinics in Indiana in Fort Wayne, Gary and South Bend before his medical license was suspended in 2016. State investigators found that he had failed to do things like ensure that qualified staff was present when patients received or recovered from medications given before and during abortion procedures.\n\nThe case already has drawn comparisons to Philadelphia abortion doctor Kermet Gosnell, who is imprisoned for life for snipping spinal cords of three aborted babies who had lived for a few moments outside the womb.\n\nInvestigators found that Gosnell stored dismembered remains in milk jugs and glass jars at his clinic.\n\nIn the 1980s in California, more than 16,000 fetuses were discovered in a cargo container that was repossessed from a medical laboratory operator\u2019s home.\n\nOn Wednesday, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a Democratic presidential candidate, talked to reporters about the remains, saying he hoped the discovery would \u201cget caught up in politics at a time when women need access to health care.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike everyone, I find the news out of Illinois, extremely disturbing,\u201d said Mr. Buttigieg. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that what happened here is disturbing, it\u2019s unacceptable and it needs to be looked at.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
