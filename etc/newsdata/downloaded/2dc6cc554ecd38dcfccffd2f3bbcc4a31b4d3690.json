The Jays decided they didn\u2019t want him to suit up for them again, and the Astros worked out a buy-low trade for Osuna that squarely placed the prospect of winning over humanity. Plenty of negative publicly followed the move, enough to carry into this season and enough, apparently, to trigger Taubman to yell at the reporters in question: \u201cThank God we got Osuna. I\u2019m so f---ing glad we got Osuna.\u201d\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe timing was suspect, since Osuna had given up a game-timing home run before the Astros came back to win on a walk-off homer and clinch their World Series trip. His beef, according to the ensuing investigation, was with one particular reporter who wore a domestic-violence awareness bracelet and would sometimes tweet the domestic violence hotline when Osuna entered games.\n\nA story by Sports Illustrated\u2019s Stephanie Apstein revealed the scene in the Astros clubhouse and set in motion an entire week of controversy that\u2019s followed the Astros through a series of botched statements, two losses at home to begin the series and finally the firing of Taubman on the World Series travel day.\n\nStory continues\n\nThen Friday night, in Osuna\u2019s first appearance of the series, Nationals fans responded with a loud chorus of boos.\n\n\n\n\n\nOsuna got quite a reception pic.twitter.com/xrXFgJFqUe \u2014 A Nats Fan (@NatsCurlyW) October 26, 2019\n\nThe Nats fans in attendance had other reasons to boo Osuna, sure. His presence meant the Nats were down to their final outs in the first home World Series game in franchise history. Osuna did his job and got the final three outs without issue.\n\nThe Astros won Game 3 in D.C. to make the series 2-1, but it seems like they\u2019ll continue to take Ls on this topic for the foreseeable future.\n\nRoberto Osuna was booed by Nationals fans as he came into World Series Game 3.
