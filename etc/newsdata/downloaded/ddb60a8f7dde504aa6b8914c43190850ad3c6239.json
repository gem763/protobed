You have no idea. It\u2019s really hard to understand what it\u2019s like. I know what it seems like it should be, but it\u2019s a very different thing.\u201d\n\nRecalling her conversations about the topic with Prince Harry (and sharing her nickname for him, too), the mom of one said, \u201cI have said for a long time to H, that\u2019s what I call him, \u2018It\u2019s not enough to just survive something.
