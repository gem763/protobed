'Suspects' families are never informed of the decisions or of the whereabouts of their relatives.'\n\nOn the issue of North Koreans who have fled to China, Quintana said in the past six months he has received information from family members living in South Korea of an increasing number of these escapees being detained in China.\n\nHe said any North Korean who escapes should not be forcibly returned because there are substantial grounds they would be tortured or subjected to other human rights violations.\n\n'I appreciate the government of China's increased engagement with me on this concern, and I hope that this will lead to greater compliance with international standards,' he said.\n\nQuintana said North Korea has accepted 132 recommendations from other U.N. member states, including one 'to grant immediate, free and unimpeded access to international humanitarian organizations to provide assistance to the most vulnerable groups, including prisoners.'\n\nHe said this could lead to the first international access to places of detention, 'and could therefore be an opportunity to improve prison conditions.'", "description": "Tomas Ojea Quintana told the General Assembly's human rights committee that 140,000 children are estimated to be suffering from 'undernutrition,' including 30,000 who 'face an increased risk of death.'", "authors": ["Joe Middleton For Mailonline", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/12/20080376-0-image-a-15_1571829370816.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
