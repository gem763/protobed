Jennifer Aniston also recently put down the comic book fare in an interview.\n\nRobert Downey Jr., who played Iron Man for more than a decade, and Natalie Portman of \u201cThor\u201d defended the flicks. But Gunn has taken a prominent role in the superheroic effort to fight back for the billions-earning blockbusters.\n\nGunn did not mention Coppola by name, but he did use \u201cdespicable\u201d in his response Sunday on Instagram.\n\n\u201cMany of our grandfathers thought all gangster movies were the same, often calling them \u2018despicable\u2019,\u201d Gunn wrote. \u201cSome of our great grandfathers thought the same of westerns and believed the films of John Ford, Sam Peckinpah, and Sergio Leone were all exactly the same.\u201d\n\nGunn likened the bias to a certain space opera that has enchanted film fans for ages.\n\n\u201cI remember a great uncle to whom I was raving about Star Wars,\u201d Gunn wrote. \u201cHe responded by saying, \u2018I saw that when it was called 2001, and, boy, was it boring!\u2019 Superheroes are simply today\u2019s gangsters/cowboys/outer space adventurers. Some superhero films are awful, some are beautiful. Like westerns and gangster movies (and before that, just MOVIES), not everyone will be able to appreciate them, even some geniuses. And that\u2019s okay. \u2764\ufe0f\u201d\n\nGunn had tried to maintain a diplomatic tone in replying to Scorsese\u2019s words as well.\n\n\u201cMartin Scorsese is one of my 5 favorite living filmmakers,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cI was outraged when people picketed The Last Temptation of Christ without having seen the film. I\u2019m saddened that he\u2019s now judging my films in the same way.\u201d\n\nMartin Scorsese is one of my 5 favorite living filmmakers.
