IG requests urgent meeting with Congress", "language": "en", "text": "One of the things we\u2019re watching this morning is this meeting this morning between both Republican and Democratic House and Senate committees and the State Department\u2019s IG, who requested an urgent meeting yesterday.\n\nAccording to reports, he\u2019s bringing documents with him:\n\nThe State Department's IG has requested to meet tomorrow with a number of Senate and House committees \"to discuss and provide staff with copies of documents related to the State Department and Ukraine,\" per a letter first reported by WashPosthttps://t.co/CKctnaViIM \u2014 Axios (@axios) October 2, 2019\n\nThe urgent request for a meeting was called \u201chighly unusual and cryptically worded\u201d:\n\nCNN: State Dept inspector general has requested an urgent Hill briefing with relevant committees tomorrow related to Ukraine. The email that went to staff suggested it was urgent. A Congressional aid described the State IG\u2019s request as \u201chighly unusual and cryptically worded.\u201d \u2014 Shimon Prokupecz (@ShimonPro) October 1, 2019\n\nNobody knows what the meeting is about, but Dems already like it:\n\nthe system seems to be working again. IG's who believe in the rule of law are asserting their constitutional authority. The state IG will be on the Hill tomorrow and he's not their representing Pompeo but the Constitution \u2014 Joe Lockhart (@joelockhart) October 2, 2019\n\nThere\u2019s speculation the meeting is in response to Sec. Mike Pompeo\u2019s statement yesterday that put deposition on hold:\n\nStanding next to John Dean before a town hall, @ericswalwell says Pompeo\u2019s letter sent a \u201cdon\u2019t snitch\u201d message to State Dept. employees. He says that he\u2019s encouraged that the State Dept. IG is talking to Congress. pic.twitter.com/45Wy0irIbE \u2014 Leigh Ann Caldwell (@LACaldwellDC) October 2, 2019\n\nDems are also claiming that Sec. Pompeo is conflicted and \u201cshould not be making any decisions regarding witness testimony or document production\u201d:\n\nSmart point. Committee Chairs' letter to DOS points out Pompeo's conflict of interest: 1. He was in on Ukraine call (for which, I'd add, there's serious concerns a crime, in addition to impeachable conduct, was committed) 2. He's acting to block State Dept officials testifying pic.twitter.com/mFwgKPNx0h \u2014 Ryan Goodman (@rgoodlaw) October 2, 2019\n\n***\n\nRelated:", "description": "\"The system seems to be working again.\"", "authors": ["Greg P.", "Posted At Am On October"], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/3bbe62de-7a45-453d-844e-7d8a20ffc26b-1.jpeg"}
