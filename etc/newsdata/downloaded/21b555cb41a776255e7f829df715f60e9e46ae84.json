It\u2019s traditionally cooked in a clay pot over and under hot coals, a difficult setup to replicate; instead, I pour the batter into a cast-iron pan lined with banana leaves, which char as the cake bakes, infusing it with their scent. (You can cut the ribs off the leaves to make them more malleable.) Nearly halfway through baking, the cake is topped with salted duck egg, an ingredient available at Asian specialty groceries. If you can\u2019t find it, the cake will be more forthrightly sweet, lacking that sly note of brine. As a final touch, if you have a kitchen torch available, char the edges of the banana leaves, so a little smokiness suffuses the delicate cake.\n\nFeatured in: Angela Dimayuga\u2019s 10 Essential Filipino Recipes.", "description": "Bibingka is a cake made of rice flour, so it\u2019s naturally gluten-free, chewy but tender throughout, with a souffl\u00e9-like fluffiness It\u2019s traditionally cooked in a clay pot over and under hot coals, a difficult setup to replicate; instead, I pour the batter into a cast-iron pan lined with banana leaves, which char as the cake bakes, infusing it with their scent (You can cut the ribs off the leaves to make them more malleable.)
