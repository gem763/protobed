A panel of three Republican-appointed judges from the court, including one nominated by Trump, had originally rejected the case in July.\n\nThe decision gives D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine and Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh a new chance to argue that the president is violating the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clauses by accepting payments from foreign and domestic parties through his Trump International Hotel.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to arguing our case before the full panel to stop President Trump from violating the Constitution and profiting from the presidency,\u201d Racine and Frosh said in a joint statement Tuesday.\n\nAG @BrianFrosh and I look forward to arguing our case before the full Fourth Circuit to stop President Trump from violating the Constitution and profiting from the presidency. #emoluments pic.twitter.com/2otm802SFH \u2014 AG Karl A.

He holds a lease on the government property through the General Services Administration, which prohibits elected officials from benefiting from such deals. Although a 2017 review found that the lease was not technically in violation of the policy, an inspector general\u2019s report from January concluded that a \u201cconstitutional cloud\u201d hangs over the property.\n\nIn the meantime, the Trump International has become a favored place for foreign governments and other interests to book rooms and events \u2014 efforts widely seen as attempts to influence the president. It has also hosted Trump fundraisers and served as a meeting place for those in the president\u2019s orbit, including his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and his associates implicated in the Ukraine scandal.\n\nTrump lawyer Jay Sekulow has previously called the emoluments cases \u201cpresidential harassment.\u201d The president has not commented on the 4th Circuit\u2019s rehearing decision and the Justice Department did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment.", "description": "A federal appeals court will rehear the lawsuit from Maryland and D.C. after it previously tossed claims the president is illegally profiting from the ho...", "authors": ["Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da745e6200000b00c505e1f.jpeg?cache=no1yn7uah1&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
