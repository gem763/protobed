Democrats claim that Trump urged Zelensky to investigate Vice President Joe Biden as part of a quid pro quo involving the withholding of U.S. military aid.\n\nWHITE HOUSE ANNOUNCES IT WILL NOT COMPLY WITH 'ILLEGITIMATE AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL' IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY\n\nWhile the White House released both the transcript of the call and the complaint from a whistleblower who alerted the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general, Democrats in the House announced a formal impeachment inquiry. But White House Counsel Pat Cipollone slammed what he called a \u201cpartisan and unconstitutional inquiry\u201d and said the White House would not cooperate. Democrats have warned that a refusal to cooperate by the White House could be a criminal act of obstruction.\n\nAs both sides stake out their claims ahead of a bruising impeachment fight, legal experts note that impeachment is not clearly defined by the framers of the Constitution.\n\n\u201cBoth House Democrats and the White House are making political arguments\u2026Impeachment is a political process, and so both sides are trying to win in the court of public opinion,\u201d David Rivkin, a lawyer in the Reagan and Bush 41 administrations in the White House Counsel\u2019s Office and Department of Justice, told Fox News. \"However, the House\u2019s political arguments happen to be false and White House\u2019s political arguments happen to be meritorious.\u201d\n\nAttorney George Conway, a fierce opponent of Trump, described the letter as \u201can impeachable offense\u201d by itself. Harvard law scholar Laurence Tribe said the \u201cstonewalling\u201d by the White House, as well as the administration's decision not to let E.U. Ambassador Gordon Sondland appear at a deposition, \u201csignals another ground for his impeachment: obstruction of Congress.\u201d\n\nTRUMP ADMINISTRATION BLOCKS AMBASSADOR FROM TESTIFYING IN HOUSE IMPEACHMENT DESPOSITION\n\n\u201cThe House Judiciary Committee in 1974 identified President Richard Nixon\u2019s direction of systematic defiance of congressional impeachment inquiries by his administration as an obstruction of the constitutional role of Congress and thus a violation of the president\u2019s duty faithfully to execute the laws,\u201d Tribe wrote in USA Today. \u201cSuch a charge is manifestly warranted against Trump today.\u201d\n\nJonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University gave a similar take, saying that \u201ca president cannot simply pick up his marbles and leave the game because he does not like the other players. A refusal to cooperate with a constitutionally mandated process can itself be an abuse of power.\u2019\n\n\"The letter rightfully raises concerns over the lack of a House vote of the body and the secrecy of proceedings,\" he wrote. \"The Democrats have limited Republicans in their effort to question witnesses and secure material. However, that is not a legitimate basis for refusing to cooperate or supply clearly material evidence.\"\n\nBut Rivkin dismissed the idea that a refusal to cooperate was itself an impeachable offense.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing about impeachment that turns the president into a ward of the legislature,\" he said. \"The Executive Branch has every right to defend its constitutional prerogatives, including executive privilege. Once there is a final judicial determination on whether the House or the White House are right on the document production and testimonial issues, that would have to be complied with. Until that happens, rejecting House\u2019s demands is a perfectly appropriate course of action.\u201d\n\nAlso unclear is the White House claim that a vote should be held to open an impeachment inquiry. Votes of the whole House were held ahead of prior impeachment hearings, but the inquiry this time was announced in a press conference by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.\n\n\u201cYour contrived process is unprecedented in the history of the Nation and lacks the necessary authorization for a valid impeachment proceeding,\u201d Cipollone wrote to Democrats.\n\nEarlier this week, Turley wrote in The Hill that \u201cthe decision to avoid a full vote robs the House of the legitimacy and substance that comes from a vote of the entire body.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\u201cThe current impeachment \u2018inquiry\u2019 rests on the authority of one person. Until the entire body votes, it remains the Pelosi impeachment effort rather than a House impeachment process,\u201d he said.\n\nOther lawyers suggested that while not absolutely necessary, a vote involving the full House would be a correct way to proceed.\n\n\u201cThe correct piano chord is to call a vote, call the House of Representatives to vote on a motion to start an impeachment inquiry,\u201d former federal prosecutor Doug Burns told Fox News. \u201cInstead this was a highly calculated political gambit, but in the end, the House is going to determine whether they have 217 votes.\u201d\n\nBut Rivkin told Fox News that even though he disagrees with how the House is proceeding, it is not constitutionally compelled to hold a vote or accede to other Trump demands.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cThe framers left it to Congress to work out the specifics of the impeachment process,\" he said. \"It did expect Congress to proceed in a politically accountable fashion, accountability being the major disciplining check on the use of impeachment power. But proceeding in an accountable fashion \u2013 which the House is manifestly not doing now \u2013 is a matter of upholding the constitutional values; it is not a matter of being constitutionally compelled to do so.\u201d\n\nBut as the legal debate continues, it seems that neither Congress nor the White House is willing to shift its position and are hunkering down for an ugly political fight. Trump on Wednesday called the inquiry \"a continuation of the greatest Scam and Witch Hunt in the history of our Country!\"", "description": "As the White House pushes back hard against House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry, legal experts are weighing in\u00a0on the validity of the objections raised by the administration.", "authors": ["Adam Shaw"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/04/ContentBroker_contentid-7438266048304f638563190cb8af7153.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
