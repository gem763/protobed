I think we can all agree Justin Trudeau is afraid of his record,\" Scheer said early in the debate.\n\n\"We can all agree on that. We can now sing Kumbaya and keep going,\" May said in support.\n\nWatch: Debates have been a hallmark of Canadian elections since 1968, but what effect do they actually have on voters?\n\nDebates have been a hallmark of Canadian elections since 1968, but what effect do they actually have on voters? Strategists will tell you they\u2019re critical to elections and a lot of planning goes into them. Researchers, on the other hand, say there\u2019s evidence they can change votes, though often they don't. 8:39\n\nAnd kept going they did, unloading on Trudeau's record for the better part of two hours. Trudeau, meanwhile, was at an Edmonton rally where he couldn't respond to the many reputational slights.\n\nTrudeau refused an invitation to this televised exchange, saying he'd only commit to the two debates organized by the debates commission and another one in French on the widely watched Quebec network TVA.\n\nThere isn't a rich tradition in this country of leaders' debates taking place without the sitting prime minister, let alone with an empty podium on stage to remind voters of a leader's absence, but that's what organizers of the debate did Thursday.\n\nBritish network ITV gave former prime minister Theresa May the \"empty chair\" treatment in 2017 when she declined an invitation to participate in a debate. Current British Prime Minister Boris Johnson faced similar treatment by another network, Channel 4, this summer during the Conservative leadership race.\n\nDespite some pointed attacks designed to paint him as sort of Doug Ford \"lite,\" Scheer proved reluctant to engage with his two progressive opponents.\n\nA Conservative majority government depends on a strong showing from the NDP and Green parties on Oct. 21 and a divided centre-left vote.\n\nWatch: Scheer refuses to rule out appealing decision that awarded billions to Indigenous children\n\nConservative Leader Andrew Scheer came under attack for refusing to rule out appealing a Canadian Human Rights Tribunal ruling that awarded billions to Indigenous children. 0:51\n\nWhen attacked by Singh on pharmacare and by May on the environment, Scheer pivoted to what he called Trudeau's failings on the same issues.\n\n\"Justin Trudeau is trying to do to Canada what Kathleen Wynne and the Liberals did to Ontario,\" he said at one point when pressed on what sort of cuts a Conservative government would make to balance the books.\n\nEven when accused of cozying up with the Yellow Vest movement, which includes some blatantly racist and white nationalist elements, Scheer kept calm. \"Try to stick to the facts,\" Scheer said to Singh on that charge.\n\n'None of what Mr. Singh just said is true'\n\nBeyond attacking Trudeau, Singh and May traded barbs throughout the night as they both look to bring disaffected Liberal voters into their respective parties.\n\nMay questioned Singh's math on a costly plan to dramatically expand a proposed national pharmacare program to include things like dental care, mental health and hearing aids. She said public dental care would cost federal coffers $38 billion and Singh's pledge to close tax loopholes and target offshore tax havens simply wouldn't produce the kind of money he needs.\n\nNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is trying to highlight how his party is different from both the Liberals and the Greens. (Frank Gunn/The Canadian Press)\n\nShe swatted away what she called a \"ludicrous\" suggestion from Singh that the Greens would prop up a Conservative minority government.\n\nSingh, meanwhile, mocked May's suggestion that SNC-Lavalin should go to work building infrastructure projects on First Nations reserves. \"Why can't you just accept it \u2014 it was a bad idea,\" Singh said.\n\nWatch: Singh and May spar over infrastructure projects on First Nations reserves\n\nNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh called Green Party Leader Elizabeth May's suggestion that SNC-Lavalin should go to work building infrastructure projects on First Nations reserves 'ridiculous.' 1:05\n\n\"I am not going to go down the little rabbit hole that Mr. Singh created. People can check \u2014 none of what Mr. Singh just said is true,\" May said.\n\nThe two parties have been locked in a battle for progressive voters not just at the federal level but also in provincial races where Greens have eaten into the NDP's share of the left-wing vote in places like Atlantic Canada and in British Columbia.\n\nThe dynamic has soured even more in recent days after some New Brunswick NDP candidates jumped to the Greens en masse.\n\nThe NDP has struggled to distinguish itself in an era when the country is led by arguably the most progressive prime minister the country has seen since former Liberal prime minister Pierre Trudeau or Lester B. Pearson before him.\n\nJustin Trudeau has implemented the generous Canada Child Benefit program and hiked taxes on the wealthy, all while promising further reforms like a national pharmacare plan and ambitious investments in the nation's housing stock, two policies long part of the NDP playbook.\n\nElizabeth May, leader of the Greens, was the most experienced debater of the three candidates on stage. (Frank Gunn/The Canadian Press)\n\nIn his closing remarks, Singh promised to go further and deeper than the Liberals. \"We don't fight for the powerful and the wealthy. We will fight for you.\"\n\nThe Green Party, meanwhile, has seen a steady increase in its polling fortunes since the Liberal government announced it would purchase the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion from its U.S. parent, Kinder Morgan.\n\nMay has also sought to frame herself as an ethical alternative for voters frustrated by politics as usual.\n\n\"The time for status quo decision-making is over. The time for status quo, short-term politics where every party goes out to beat their own drum and kick the others in the shin is over,\" she said.\n\nScheer just looked ready for the next debate, when he can take on the man he clearly sees as his only worthy opponent: Trudeau.", "description": "Justin Trudeau 's decision to skip the first federal leaders' debate Thursday left his rivals free to go after his record with impunity.", "authors": ["Parliamentary Bureau", "John Paul", "J.P.", "Tasker Is A Reporter In The Cbc'S Parliamentary Bureau In Ottawa.
