President Trump has at times expressed an openness to more comprehensive background checks for prospective gun buyers, after back-to-back mass shootings just weeks earlier in Dayton, Ohio, and El Paso, Texas. But the case illustrates the difficulty in preventing such massacres and the ways in which people who are barred from gun ownership can skirt the law.\n\nRelated Video At least seven people have died so far and more than a dozen were injured in the West Texas cities of Midland and Odessa after a shooter began randomly firing at people Saturday.

Records of the gunman\u2019s mental health ruling would have been submitted to an FBI database used to check the backgrounds of prospective gun buyers.\n\nThe database, known as the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, has come under scrutiny as it failed to prevent other mass shooters to buy their guns. Lapses in the system, for example, allowed the man who killed nine people in a historically black church in South Carolina in 2015 to buy his weapon despite having admitted to possessing drugs, which should have blocked the purchase. Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered a review of the system in 2017, after a gunman passed a background check to buy guns he used in the slaughter of more than two-dozen people at a Texas church because the Air Force failed to report his criminal history to the FBI.\n\nBut in the latest attack, the background check system seems to have worked when the shooter previously tried to buy guns. The FBI declined to immediately comment about the attempted purchase, or the effectiveness of its database.\n\nAtor had been struggling before Saturday\u2019s shooting, authorities said. In the hours before he opened fire in Odessa, he was fired from his job and called 911 and an FBI tip line with what officials described as rambling statements about some of the \u201catrocities\u201d he had experienced. But in neither call did he make any threats.\n\nFederal law prohibits gun ownership for anyone who has been \u201cadjudicated as a mental defective\u201d or has been committed to a mental institution. It also makes it illegal to sell a weapon to such a person who the seller knows has been prohibited.\n\nAtor shot 29 people as he drove between Odessa and Midland on Saturday afternoon, firing at random and hijacking a U.S. Postal Service van, authorities said. He died after officers intercepted and shot him outside a movie theater.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has opposed stricter gun laws, said on Twitter that Ator had previously failed a background check to purchase a gun in Texas and didn\u2019t go through one before buying the gun he used in the shootings.\n\nAfter 22 people were shot and killed at a Walmart in El Paso, Mr. Trump has at times said he favors more meaningful background checks, but has alternately backed away from that stance under pressure from gun-rights groups. He has also cited mental illness as a prominent factor in mass shootings.\n\nWhite House officials have been meeting with lawmakers and congressional staff in hopes of moving legislation when Congress returns from recess. It is unclear whether there is enough political will to approve legislation.\n\nWrite to Dan Frosch at dan.frosch@wsj.com and Sadie Gurman at sadie.gurman@wsj.com", "description": "A man who went on a deadly mass shooting spree across West Texas Saturday was barred under federal law from owning or buying firearms because a court had previously determined he was mentally unfit.", "authors": ["Dan Frosch", "Sadie Gurman", "Dan.Frosch Wsj.Com", "Sadie.Gurman Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103628/social"}
