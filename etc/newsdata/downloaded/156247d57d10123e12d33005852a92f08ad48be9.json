The transcripts that could doom Trump", "language": "en", "text": "Experts say the Ukraine call could be the tip of the iceberg \u2013 how many more compromising conversations have there been?\n\nWhat did the president say and when did he say it?\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s politically catastrophic phone call with the leader of Ukraine, sufficient to prompt an impeachment inquiry, might just be the tip of an iceberg that could doom his presidency.\n\nBernie Sanders cancels campaign events after being hospitalized with blocked artery \u2013 live Read more\n\nOn Monday it emerged that Trump urged Australia\u2019s prime minister during a recent phone call to help the US attorney general gather information that he hopes will undermine Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into alleged collusion with Russia.\n\nThe White House restricted access to the call\u2019s transcript to a small group of presidential aides, the New York Times reported, noting this was an unusual decision similar to the handling of the July call in which he pressed Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy to dig for dirt on a political rival.\n\nIt raised questions: how many more compromising conversations have there been? Will the transcripts inevitably leak out with the help of more whistleblowers? And could their combined effect be enough to persuade Senate Republicans it is time to dump Trump, just as an incriminating tape led to the downfall of President Richard Nixon?\n\n\u201cI think the conversations between Trump and world leaders stored in the White House server are critical, and could very well seal his fate,\u201d said Chris Whipple, author The Gatekeepers: How the White House Chiefs of Staff Define Every Presidency.\n\n\u201cA single conversation, recorded in black and white by a notetaker, has already been a game-changer. Trump\u2019s mafia-style shakedown of the president of Ukraine has moved the needle dramatically. If there are other, similarly damning conversations to be found in the White House server, impeachment could gain critical mass in a hurry. And even this Senate might convict when confronted with that kind of evidence: Facts are stubborn things.\u201d\n\nWhipple added: \u201cThe House must move quickly to preserve the notes of those conversations.\u201d\n\nUnlike Nixon, or indeed any other US president in history, Trump had no prior political or military experience. His shallow knowledge, short attention span and tendency to wing it have been brutally exposed on the world stage. The public comments at a joint press conference with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, siding with the Russian president against his own intelligence agencies, were bad enough.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Trump shakes hands with Putin after their conversation at the summit in Helsinki in 2018.

This included storing reconstructed transcripts of the calls on \u201ca highly classified computer system\u201d normally intended for closely guarded government secrets.\n\nLast week the Washington Post reported that in 2017, Trump told Russian officials in the Oval Office that he was \u201cunconcerned about Moscow\u2019s interference in the 2016 US presidential election because the United States did the same in other countries, an assertion that prompted alarmed White House officials to limit access to the remarks to an unusually small number of people.\u201d\n\nThen there was the Ukraine call with its request for an investigation into former vice president Joe Biden, a potential opponent in next year\u2019s presidential election. White House officials moved the summary of it to a \u201cstandalone computer system reserved for codeword-level intelligence information, such as covert action,\u201d according to an intelligence community whistleblower\u2019s complaint.\n\nA note in the complaint\u2019s appendix said: \u201cAccording to White House officials I spoke with, this was \u2018not the first time\u2019 under this administration that a Presidential transcript was placed into this codeword-level system solely for the purpose of protecting politically sensitive \u2013 rather than national security sensitive \u2013 information.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the transcripts appeared to have been concealed to avoid embarrassment rather than security reasons. Democrats pursuing impeachment would give much to get their hands on this material, not least the content of the president\u2019s dialogues with Putin, to whom his continued deference remains one of the great mysteries of the age.\n\nAdam Schiff, the chair of the House intelligence committee, told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on Sunday: \u201cIf those conversations with Putin or with other world leaders are sequestered in that same electronic file that is meant for covert action, not meant for this, if there\u2019s an effort to hide those and cover those up, yes, we\u2019re determined to find out.\u201d\n\nBut whereas the White House was quick to release a rough transcript of the Ukraine conversation, implying a failure to comprehend its gravity, it is unlikely to be so forthcoming next time. Putin has already warned against it and independent observers warn that such disclosures would set a dangerous precedent, given foreign leaders\u2019 expectations of confidentiality.\n\nYet secrets find a way, and the political momentum could become irresistible. Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow in the governance studies programme at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington, told an audience there on Monday: \u201cIt is very interesting how this issue may begin with Ukraine but end with Russia or Saudi Arabia or another country because it has now come out that there are hidden communications.\n\nTrump can do more damage than Nixon. His impeachment is imperative | Robert Reich Read more\n\n\u201cIt reminds me of the revelation of the White House taping system during Watergate. Again, it was a throwaway: to was something that nobody ever even knew about, nobody knew it was going to happen. Once it was out there everybody said, \u2018Oh, my god! This can do it.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe West Wing tapes included the \u201csmoking gun\u201d evidence that Nixon told aides to order the CIA to shut down the FBI\u2019s investigation into a break-in at the Democratic National Committee offices at the Watergate complex. It confirmed testimony by John Dean, the former White House counsel, that Nixon tried to cover up the burglary. The president\u2019s once seemingly invincible support among Republicans collapsed and he was forced to resign before he could be impeached.\n\nWhile Nixon\u2019s offence was purely domestic, Trump directly solicited the intervention of a foreign power, an act that history may judge to be more heinous. While Nixon\u2019s fate was sealed by big and clunky tapes, the key to Trump\u2019s downfall may be locked in a hi-tech computer server.\n\nKamarck added: \u201cNow, I would assume that at some point in this process a subgroup of Democrats and Republicans with the properly high security clearances are going to have a look at that server and they\u2019re going to have to say, \u2018What\u2019s in here? Is it all covert operations and military movements, or is it something else?\u2019\n\n\u201cWhat makes you suspicious is that server began to be used the day after the famous meeting between Trump and the Russian foreign minister and the Russian ambassador, where they threw out the Americans and let the Russians stay. So there\u2019s just a lot more to happen here.\u201d", "description": "Experts say the Ukraine call could be the tip of the iceberg \u2013 how many more compromising conversations have there been?", "authors": ["David Smith"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08641153ffadeb17151560f88e34f0f50ce765e3/0_281_4233_2540/master/4233.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d4f157ec64d0bf36a3365762df94a107"}
