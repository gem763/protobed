I call false on that cause I only take Whole Food or natural food supplements. I don't even eat meat. So until UFC, USADA or whoever is (expletive) with me fixed it, I won't be competing. I'm not gonna play their game and try to hide it or keep quiet, as they suggested. I'm not gonna have my name tainted as a cheater like these other (expletives) who keep quiet until after the fight just so they can get paid. (Expletive) cheaters. I don't give a (expletive) about some money over my dignity and my legacy. I'm not playing along with this (expletive). I'm not staying quiet and figuring it out after the fight. That's cheating. So fight game I'll see you when I see you.\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe real baddest mother (expletive) in the game.\"\n\nWhat Diaz's withdrawal means for UFC 244, which takes place Nov. 2 at Madison Square Garden in New York, remains to be seen.\n\nDiaz's publicist and UFC officials were did immediately respond when contacted by MMA Junkie for comment.", "description": "Nate Diaz says he is out of the UFC 244 headliner vs. Jorge Masvidal, apparently due to a drug testing issue with USADA.", "authors": ["Mike Bohn", "Mma Junkie", "Published P.M.
