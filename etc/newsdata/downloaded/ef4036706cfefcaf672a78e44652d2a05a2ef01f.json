Williams, who turns 38 this month, appeared to be cruising along to a straightforward victory when she took an awkward step while up at the net for a volley.\n\nShe tumbled to the ground and sat there, cross-legged, right in the middle of Arthur Ashe Stadium for a few moments. Williams has dealt with various health issues all season, including one that ended her stay at the Australian Open.\n\nMight that sort of thing be happening again? Williams immediately asked for a trainer, who added tape to her lower right leg and foot during a medical timeout at the ensuing changeover.\n\nSerena Williams holds her ankle after falling to the court during her Women's Singles fourth round match against Petra Martic of Croatia on day seven of the 2019 U.S. Open on Sept. 1, 2019, in the Queens borough of New York City.

She felt like maybe she couldn't move that well anymore,\" Martic said. \"Her shots were really precise. Serve was unbelievable. And when she hits those backhands and those first serves that well, it's not easy to play against her.\"\n\nWilliams ended things by raising both arms after smacking an ace at 118 mph, her fastest of the afternoon, punctuating an overpowering performance that included 38 winners to Martic's 11.\n\n\"I didn't know what to expect from her ball. I knew she (hits it) hard,\" Martic said, \"but until you feel it on your own racket, you just don't know what to expect.\"\n\nSerena Williams of the United States shakes hands with Petra Martic of Croatia. Getty\n\nThe scene Sunday brought back memories of Williams' Australian Open quarterfinal in January against Pliskova. Williams was way ahead \u2014 holding a match point at 5-1, 40-30 in the third set \u2014 when she turned her left ankle awkwardly. From there, Williams dropped every point she served the rest of the way.\n\nShe failed to convert four match points in all that day, ceded six games in a row and lost 7-5 in the third. That time, Williams didn't call for a trainer, which surprised many. Didn't make that mistake this time. And a couple of hours later, she was walking without any apparent hitch in her step. She figured she'd know more about the ankle based on how it responds Monday; she plays Wang on Tuesday.\n\nWilliams has not managed to complete a non-Slam tournament in 2019, withdrawing from each with one ailment or another, including a viral illness, a hurt left knee and, most recently, back spasms. She hasn't won a title since returning to the tour after having a baby; her daughter, Olympia, was born exactly two years ago Sunday.\n\n\"Best day of my life,\" Williams called it.", "description": "A couple of hours later, Williams was walking without any apparent hitch in her step", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/02/c647b30c-8bf8-408a-a285-7330b92a74a4/thumbnail/1200x630/205cc2c8d5419fb841984fc1f41f4eca/gettyimages-1171577921.jpg"}
