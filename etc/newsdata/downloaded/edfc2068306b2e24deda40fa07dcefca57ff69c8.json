Ron DeSantis.\n\nIn October 2018, Morgan contributed $250,000 to Gillum\u2019s political committee, Forward Florida. When the powerful Orlando trial lawyer asked Gillum for his money back, Morgan said he was told \u201cno.\u201d\n\nRELATED STORY: Background on the Twitter feud\n\n\u201cIf he does decide to run again, I do believe I have a cause of action,\u201d Morgan told the crowd of political insiders on Wednesday. \u201cI do believe I will sue him to get that $3.7 million back to the ones that gave at the end. I do believe that.\u201d\n\nGillum responded to Morgan\u2019s Tiger Bay comments on social media, tweeting, \u201cWhen keeping my name in your mouth makes you relevant\u2026\u201d\n\nWhen keeping my name in your mouth makes you relevant... pic.twitter.com/Z79yIeVyxj \u2014 Andrew Gillum (@AndrewGillum) August 28, 2019\n\nThis is not the first time bad blood between the two men has been in full view.\n\nMorgan and Gillum have engaged in a series of Twitter spats, with the influential lawyer raising questions about the political candidate\u2019s unspent campaign funds.\n\nMorgan summed up the feud on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cAndrew Gillum kept that money to promote Andrew Gillum,\u201d he said. \u201cI gave my money to promote things I believe in.\u201d\n\nAfter his November loss to DeSantis, Gillum, a former Tallahassee mayor, said he would use the money to register and \u201cre-engage\u201d 1 million voters for next year\u2019s presidential election.\n\nMorgan quipped earlier this summer \u2014 and again on Wednesday \u2014 that Gillum should use the money to help felons pay for restitution, fees and fines, so they can get their voting rights restored.\n\nUnder a new law approved by the Republican-dominated state Legislature this spring, Floridians who have been convicted of felonies must pay all court-ordered financial obligations before they are eligible to have their voting rights restored. The state law carried out a constitutional amendment, approved in November, that restored voting rights to felons who have completed their sentences.\n\nBut Gillum, responding to Morgan this summer on Twitter, insisted the money was already committed to the voter registration effort.\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d Morgan sarcastically asked Wednesday. \u201cHow many have you registered?\u201d\n\nMorgan said Gillum\u2019s move is hard to comprehend because over the years, he has learned that \u201cit is very hard to beat money\u201d in Florida politics.\n\nWhile he blasted Gillum for almost half of his 40-minute lunchtime talk Wednesday, Morgan also spoke about his two passions: the push to legalize medical marijuana and his latest fight to raise Florida\u2019s minimum wage to $15 an hour.\n\nMorgan spent about $4 million of his and his law firm\u2019s money backing a constitutional amendment that broadly legalized medical marijuana in 2016. More than 71 percent of Floridians supported the amendment.\n\nNow, Morgan is bankrolling a proposed constitutional amendment that would gradually raise Florida\u2019s minimum wage.\n\nIn July, he gave more than $1 million to the political committee Florida For a Fair Wage, which is trying to get the amendment on the November 2020 ballot. Morgan and his law firm have contributed more than $4 million toward the effort, according to the state Division of Elections website.\n\nMorgan said the fight for a higher minimum wage should not be seen as a political issue, pointing to lessons he has learned in church about loving God and your neighbors.\n\n\u201cThis is an issue of morals and ethics and religion,\u201d he said.", "description": "Remarks at Tiger Bay in Tallahassee include a threat to sue.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.tampabay.com/resizer/T_vflkWpBnfnkwQeFfxgd7dOBSs=/800x450/smart/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tbt.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3PTOQEKDCZG2NFTFFZ7PRN4ZX4.JPG", "published_at": "2019-08-28"}
