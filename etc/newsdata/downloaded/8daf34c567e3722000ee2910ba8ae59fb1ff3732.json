John Hickenlooper. | Charlie Neibergall/AP Photo elections 'Offensive': Democrats blasted over Hickenlooper endorsement The national party is boosting favored Senate candidates across the country, alienating progressives.\n\nWhen the Senate Democratic campaign arm endorsed John Hickenlooper the day after he announced he would challenge GOP Sen. Cory Gardner, the backlash was swift.\n\nA half dozen women already running penned a scathing letter attacking the committee for perpetuating a good ol\u2019 boy system by throwing its weight behind a moderate, white man in a diverse primary field.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cOffensive,\u201d was how state Sen. Angela Williams, who signed the letter, put it. \u201cFor someone to think just one candidate, one man, can win this is not who we are in the state,\" she said. \"And we\u2019re better than this.\"\n\nNational Democrats view Hickenlooper, a former two-term governor who flamed out of the presidential race, as their best bet in Colorado, a must-win for the Senate majority. He isn\u2019t the only candidate they\u2019ve endorsed in aprimary: The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has also picked favorites in a handful of races across the country rather than allowing primaries to play out unimpeded.\n\nIt\u2019s a risky decision after similar endorsements have backfired for the party in recent cycles, and it\u2019s already created a fierce reaction within their own ranks \u2014 before Democrats even get to taking on Republicans incumbents. But Democrats defend the decisions as a necessary boost for candidates they see as best-positioned to prevail.\n\nThe DSCC has already backed Theresa Greenfield in Iowa and state House Speaker Sara Gideon in Maine, two battleground states with multiple Democratic contenders, and endorsed Mark Kelly in Arizona, where the primary field was cleared of potential rivals. They\u2019re also officially behind Rep. Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n in New Mexico and Jaime Harrison, a former state party chairman, in the reach state of South Carolina.\n\nThe endorsements can provide candidates with party resources and much-needed fundraising boosts. But they have left some progressives livid, saying the party should allow the process to play out and force their preferred candidates to prove themselves without help. Rival candidates are angry at the detrimental effect on their bids, while other Democrats say the DSCC involvement kept them from running at all.\n\nThen-Governor John Hickenlooper (center) and Angela Williams (right) during a bill signing in Denver on May 2014.

They point out Hickenlooper already has major local endorsements, including from former Sen. Ken Salazar and Rep. Ed Perlmutter, and that he won two gubernatorial races in 2010 and 2014 \u2014 two banner years for Republicans. Recent polling shows Hickenlooper with a massive lead in the primary.\n\nOne state lawmaker, who requested anonymity to speak frankly, said some candidates and activists frustrated by the endorsement fail to grasp the scope of the race, which will be a top contest for control of the Senate.\n\n\u201cThe women candidates have failed to present themselves as serious contenders, and I think that's what a lot of people understand,\u201d the lawmaker said, pointing to low, early fundraising totals.\n\nOthers were more blunt.\n\n\u201cSometime between when we put away the shorts and start waxing our skis, people will realize that the goals for 2020 are to beat Gardner, [Senate Majority Leader Mitch] McConnell and [President Donald] Trump,\u201d said Curtis Hubbard, a Democratic strategist who has worked for Hickenlooper, calling him \u201cour best hope for all three.\u201d\n\nHickenlooper\u2019s detractors roundly disagree with that analysis. Several other Democrats in the race are well funded, they argue, and more in line with the state\u2019s progressive base. And despite winning two terms as governor, they point to Hickenlooper's failed presidential campaign as evidence of his weakness as a candidate \u2014 including his statements about the Senate race, saying he's not \"cut out to be a senator.\"\n\n\u201cFor the DSCC to put their money on a guy who has some serious flaws as a leader, I just find it to be abysmal,\u201d said Joe Salazar, a former state lawmaker who helped draft the letter the women candidates signed.\n\nThe DSCC and its allies vehemently defend endorsing in primaries, arguing every decision is in service of winning control of the Senate after next year's elections. Candidates they have backed also have significant local support: Gideon announced more than 60 Maine endorsements on the day she launched in June, and Greenfield announced endorsements Thursday from nine local elected officials, party chairs and activists, adding to a list that already included unions and former statewide elected officials.\n\nDan Sena, who ran the House campaign committee in 2018 when Democrats took back the majority \u2014 after getting involved in primaries behind a number of candidates \u2014 argued that endorsements come after significant local engagement and data.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Sens. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.) and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) both have GOP challengers, and Republicans face crowded and potentially divisive primaries in Alabama and Kansas, two red states they must win to maintain their majority.\n\nRepublicans have already tried to drive a wedge in Democratic primaries, spending money on billboards lifting up lower-tier Democratic challengers with fewer resources they view as easier general election opponents.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to stop Mitch McConnell from gutting access to affordable health care, confirming partisan judges to lifetime appointments on the federal bench and Supreme Court, and attacking reproductive rights, then we need to win Senate seats,\u201d said Stewart Boss, a DSCC spokesperson. \u201cWe\u2019re working with candidates who will do exactly that and help Democrats take back the Senate.\"\n\nBut some liberals say that to get involved this early shuts the door on potential candidates who could prove themselves as majority-makers. There is lingering frustration from 2016, when the committee backed former Gov.Ted Strickland in Ohio and former Sen. Evan Bayh in Indiana only to see both flop on the campaign trail.\n\nRebecca Katz, a progressive Democratic strategist, worked with John Fetterman, then a local mayor, in the three-way Pennsylvania Senate primary in 2016. The DSCC endorsed Katie McGinty in that race, aiming to block former Rep. Joe Sestak, who lost a Senate race in 2010, from becoming the nominee \u2014 but Katz said the interference alsodiminished energy for Fetterman. McGinty won the primary but failed to unseat Republican Sen. Pat Toomey in the general election. Fetterman won the lieutenant governor\u2019s race two years later.\n\n\u201cThe DSCC should be out there looking for the best candidates, but they shouldn't be stifling energy. And when they make endorsements like this, that's exactly what they're doing,\u201d Katz said. \u201cOnce again, they are ignoring what Democratic primary voters want for who may look better on paper.\u201d\n\nStacey Walker, a county supervisor in Iowa, was considering running for Senate earlier this year and said the DSCC's endorsement was the primary reason he stayed out to protect his nascent political career.\n\n\u201cI couldn't risk damaging myself by going up against the establishment's preferred choice,\u201d Walker told POLITICO in an interview. \u201cGetting involved a year out without letting the field settle itself, and everything that comes along with that, just makes it real hard to have a competitive primary.\u201d\n\nMike Franken, a retired three-star Navy admiral who entered the Iowa race this week \u2014 well after the national consolidation around Greenfield \u2014 said he preferred a primary contest without interference but wasn't deterred by the DSCC's endorsement.\n\n\u201cThey do choose presidential candidates here, and I certainly think that in stride they can choose the best senatorial candidate,\u201d Franken said. \u201cLet's just let the voter decide.\"\n\nEven in states where the DSCC hasn\u2019t endorsed candidates, they\u2019ve taken heat. Matt Jones, a sports radio host in Kentucky, launched an exploratory committee Thursday eyeing a run against McConnell. He\u2019s been critical of Amy McGrath, who has not been endorsed but has significant national backing that helped her raised $2.5 million the day she launched.\n\n\u201cTo take down the [Democratic] Party first, and the Republican party second, that's not exactly easy,\u201d Jones said on his radio show Thursday.\n\nIn Maine, Democrats have rallied around Gideon, who entered the race against GOP Sen. Susan Collins in June with a flood of local endorsements and raised $1 million in a week.\n\nGideon said in an interview earlier this month that she was glad to have support from national organizations like the DSCC and End Citizens United, but also said she\u2019s \u201creally proud to have the support of many, many people in Maine.\u201d\n\nBut Betsy Sweet, a progressive activist and lobbyist who placed third in last year\u2019s gubernatorial primary, is running to Gideon\u2019s left and has become a vocal critic of the national involvement.\n\n\u201cNo one ever talked to me,\u201d Sweet said. \u201cNo one ever reached out to me.\u201d\n\nBurgess Everett contributed to this report.", "description": "The national party is boosting favored Senate candidates across the country, alienating progressives.", "authors": ["James Arkin"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/2d/7b/9804f4b14bf6b42458cb9e93ad5c/19829-hickenlooper-ap-773.jpg"}
