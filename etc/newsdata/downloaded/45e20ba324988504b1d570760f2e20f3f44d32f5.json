A source told Reuters that Trump, as of a few hours ago, had not agreed to any deal. A key sticking point revolves around enforcement of any agreement, the source said.\n\nMajor U.S. stock indexes were trading sharply higher on hopes the talks would produce some sort of a deal, with the S&P 500 index .SPX up about 1.7%. The MSCI world equity index .MIWD00000PUS also jumped.\n\nAsked whether investors were right to be hopeful, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters at the White House \u201cthe stock market is always right.\u201d Mnuchin, who participated in the talks this week, noted that Trump would be briefed on the outcome of the talks before his meeting with Liu.\n\nChina extended an official invite to Mnuchin, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and their teams for trade talks in China ahead of next month\u2019s APEC summit, a CNN reporter tweeted.\n\nStriking an optimistic note, Trump tweeted earlier on Friday that \u201cgood things\u201d were happening in the talks.\n\nA Chinese state newspaper said on Friday that a \u201cpartial\u201d trade deal would benefit China and the United States, and that Washington should take the offer, reflecting Beijing\u2019s aim of cooling the row before more tariffs kick in.\n\nBoth sides have slapped duties on hundreds of billions of dollars of goods during the dispute, and Trump had threatened to raise tariffs to 30% from 25% on about $250 billion in Chinese goods on Oct. 15 if there was no progress on a deal.\n\nA currency pact and a delay of the planned higher U.S. tariffs were included in a partial deal as of Thursday night, another source familiar with the talks told Reuters.\n\nOn Thursday, Liu said China is willing to reach agreement with the United States on matters that both sides care about so as to prevent friction from leading to further escalation of the trade war. He stressed that \u201cthe Chinese side came with great sincerity.\u201d\n\nAdding to that, the official China Daily newspaper said in an editorial in English on Friday: \u201cA partial deal is a more feasible objective.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot only would it be of tangible benefit by breaking the impasse, but it would also create badly needed breathing space for both sides to reflect on the bigger picture,\u201d the paper said.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump holds a campaign rally in Minneapolis, Minnesota, U.S., October 10, 2019. REUTERS/Leah Millis\n\nTrump has previously insisted he would not be satisfied with a partial deal to resolve his two-year effort to change China\u2019s trade, intellectual property and industrial policy practices, which he argues cost millions of U.S. jobs.\n\nCHINA\u2019S ACTIONS\n\nChina\u2019s securities regulator on Friday also unveiled a firm timetable for scrapping foreign ownership limits in futures, securities and mutual fund companies for the first time. Increasing foreign access to the sector is among the U.S. demands at the trade talks.\n\nBeijing previously said it would further open up its financial sector on its own terms and at its own pace.\n\nChinese officials also are offering to increase annual purchases of U.S. agricultural products, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday, citing unidentified sources.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) on Thursday confirmed net sales of 142,172 tonnes of U.S. pork to China in the week ended Oct. 3, the largest weekly sale to the world\u2019s top pork market on record.\n\nA U.S.-China currency agreement is being floated as a symbol of progress in talks between the world\u2019s two largest economies, although that would largely repeat past pledges by China, currency experts say, and will not change the dollar-yuan relationship that has been a thorn in Trump\u2019s side.\n\n\u2018ONLY WINDOW\u2019\n\nAnalysts have noted China sent a larger-than-normal delegation of senior Chinese officials to Washington, with its commerce minister, Zhong Shan, and deputy ministers for agriculture and technology also present.\n\nThe optimism about a potential de-escalation of the trade war, which has roiled financial markets and uprooted global supply chains, is in stark contrast to gloomier predictions in business circles just days ago on the heels of a series of threatened crackdowns on China by the Trump administration.\n\nOn Tuesday, the U.S. government widened its trade blacklist to include Chinese public security bureaus and some of China\u2019s top artificial intelligence startups, punishing Beijing for its treatment of Muslim minorities.\n\nSurprised by the move, Chinese government officials told Reuters on the eve of talks that they had lowered expectations for significant progress.\n\nFriday\u2019s China Daily editorial also warned that \u201cpessimism is still justified\u201d, noting that the talks would finish just days before Washington is due to implement higher tariffs.\n\nThe negotiations were the \u201conly window\u201d to end deteriorating relations, it added.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin (R) and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer welcome China's Vice Premier Liu He before the two countries' trade negotiations in Washington, U.S., October 10, 2019. REUTERS/Yuri Gripas/File Photo\n\nThere have also been reports that the Trump administration is readying additional measures aimed at China, with unknown consequences for trade negotiations.\n\nSuch wildly shifting expectations have been a persistent feature of the trade war, and observers remained cautious over what might emerge from this week\u2019s talks.\n\n\u201cChina wants peace, but I don\u2019t think China will give more,\u201d one Chinese trade expert said on condition of anonymity.", "description": "U.S. officials on Friday signaled good news was coming after a second day of trade talks with China ended, boosting investor hopes that the world's two largest economies would agree to cool the fires of their 15-month tariff war.", "authors": ["Jeff Mason", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439781013&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A1HG", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
