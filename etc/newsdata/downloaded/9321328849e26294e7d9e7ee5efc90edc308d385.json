Now, a video of that performance has been released.\n\nLed by Nobu Adilman and Daveed Goldman, everyone sang Smith's 1988 anthem, \"People Have the Power.\" Smith provided vocals and played a \"Brazilian samba frying pan,\" according to Choir! Choir! Choir! \"Don't forget it, use your voice,\" Smith exclaims, at the end of the performance.\n\n\"What happened was pure magic and we're still pinching ourselves,\" the group wrote on its YouTube channel.\n\nNext month, Choir! Choir! Choir! will head even further south, to the U.S./Mexico border to perform the Beatles' \"With a Little Help From my Friends\" with singers in San Diego and Tijuana.", "description": "Together, they performed 'People Have the Power' in New York City.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5290136.1568917526!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/patti-smith.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
