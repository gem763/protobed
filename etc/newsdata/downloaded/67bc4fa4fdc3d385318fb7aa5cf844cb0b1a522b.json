I know Pochettino got to a Champions League final.\n\n\"So in Brendan Rodgers' view - if he gets the top four this season - he should now be linked with the very best jobs in English football.\"", "description": "Leicester City have moved to second in the Premier League with a huge 9-0 win over Southampton at St Mary's", "authors": ["Jake Polden", "Image", "Pa", "Plumb Images", "Empics Sport"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20726818.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Southampton-v-Leicester-City-Premier-League-St-Marys-Stadium.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
