He said Tuesday that the fact that the individual\u2019s knowledge of Trump\u2019s phone call and the White House restricting records came secondhand should not invalidate his reporting.\n\n\u201cThis person appears to have followed the whistleblower protection laws and ought to be heard out and protected. We should always work to respect whistleblowers,\u201d Grassley said. \u201cComplaints based on second-hand information should not be rejected out of hand, but they do require additional leg work to get at the facts and evaluate the claim\u2019s credibility.\u201d\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/9f/5e/efb5847e4b42a358b4de7e606b6b/ukraine-site.png\"\n\nGrassley also said media reports on the identity of the whistleblower \u201cdon\u2019t serve the public interest\u2014even if the conflict sells more papers or attracts clicks.\u201d The New York Times and Washington Post both reported that the whistleblower is a CIA officer but did not identify him by name.\n\nFor now, Grassley is something of a lonely voice in the party, though Maine Sen. Susan Collins pushed back forcefully against Trump\u2019s suggestion last week that the whistleblower\u2019s sources are spies. The whistleblower claimed administration sources said Trump moved to \u201cabuse his office for personal gain\u201d when speaking to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky about former Vice President Joe Biden in July, then tried to restrict access to the call-record of the conversation. The complaint and a transcript of the call are the basis for House Democrats' impeachment inquiry.\n\nOn Tuesday at a short Senate session, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) said he left it up to reporters as to whether the media should reveal more about the whistleblower and said much more should be learned about this person.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d assume if you were going to dig into this you\u2019d want to know who the sources are that the whistleblower relied on. And I\u2019d assume we\u2019d want to know whom the whistleblower himself or herself is and if they\u2019re credible,\u201d Hawley said.\n\nLast week, a number of Republicans mounted attacks on the whistleblower as a secondhand source with no direct knowledge of the inner workings of the administration.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not really a whistleblower, so it\u2019s really more hearsay,\u201d South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott said Friday.\n\nGrassley said \u201cthe distinctions being drawn between first and secondhand knowledge aren\u2019t legal ones.\u201d He did not mention Trump or his attacks on the whistleblower specifically in his statement, instead asserting that \u201cno one should be making judgments or pronouncements without hearing from the whistleblower first and carefully following up on the facts.\u201d\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/76/1d/89d23a804d4d95f3083b6e9593d4/trumpimpeachment.jpg\"\n\nThe intelligence community's inspector general pushed back Monday against reports and comments from conservative media and politicians that said the whistleblower complaint system was recently changed.\n\nGrassley has made sure to bring up whistleblowers in public forums with the Trump administration. He said earlier this year he asked Attorney General William Barr in a meeting how he would handle whistleblower complaints as attorney general. Barr was confirmed by the Senate this year with Grassley\u2019s support.\n\n\u201cThey all say they\u2019re going to respect whistleblowers but they end up not doing it,\u201d Grassley said of administration officials. \u201c Every Cabinet person that comes in is well intended about protecting whistleblowers and then they\u2019re treated like a skunk at a picnic.\u201d\n\nTrump has suggested he wants to find out the identity of the whistleblower, who issued a complaint on Aug. 12 to congressional intelligence committees about Trump leaning on Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate Biden, a leading political rival.\n\n\u201cSo if the so-called \u2018Whistleblower\u2019 has all second hand information, and almost everything he has said about my \u2018perfect\u2019 call with the Ukrainian President is wrong (much to the embarrassment of Pelosi & Schiff), why aren\u2019t we entitled to interview & learn everything about the Whistleblower, and also the person who gave all of the false information to him,\u201d Trump tweeted on Tuesday. \u201cThis is simply about a phone conversation that could not have been nicer, warmer, or better.\"\n\nThus far, Republicans who are defending the president are largely relying on the White House summary of his call with Zelensky in July, which they say shows no explicit quid pro quo and is just how Trump talks.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any evidence yet of any crime. Or any evidence approaching a crime. If there is any evidence or if there are any actual facts to that effect, I hope somebody will come forward with them. But what we have right now is a bunch of speculation,\u201d Hawley said. \u201cWe do have the transcript. It\u2019s the only actual hard piece of data that we\u2019ve got. It doesn\u2019t show a crime.\u201d\n\nAnd despite being on opposite pages with Trump, Grassley made clear in his statement he is not endorsing Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s impeachment inquiry approach, either. On Monday, he also sided firmly with conservatives when his office made public a letter from Grassley and Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) in which the senators asked Barr to investigate any ties between Ukraine and Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign.\n\nOn Tuesday, in his statement on the whistleblower, Grassley's message was essentially that everyone should slow down.\n\n\u201cUninformed speculation wielded by politicians or media commentators as a partisan weapon is counterproductive and doesn\u2019t serve the country,\u201d Grassley said. \u201cInquiries that put impeachment first and facts last don\u2019t weigh very credibly. Folks just ought to be responsible with their words.\u201d\n\nMarianne LeVine contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/35/bb/2baf10d7474491de4d907b6cadc7/190531-chuck-grassley-gtty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
