The 2019 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to James Peebles, Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz. Claudio Bresciani/TT News Agency/via REUTERS\n\nPeebles, of Princeton University in the United States, was awarded half of the 9-million-Swedish-crown ($910,000) prize while Mayor and Queloz, from Switzerland\u2019s University of Geneva and Britain\u2019s Cambridge University, shared the rest.\n\n\u201cThis year\u2019s Nobel laureates have painted a picture of our universe far stranger and more wonderful than we could ever have imagined,\u201d Ulf Danielsson, a professor and member of the Nobel Committee for Physics, told reporters as the prize was announced.\n\nThe Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said the scientists\u2019 research had \u201ctransformed our ideas about the cosmos\u201d.\n\nMayor and Queloz said it was \u201csimply extraordinary\u201d to be awarded a Nobel for what they described as \u201cthe most exciting discovery of our entire career\u201d.\n\nPeebles thanked the Nobel committee for the award but said his advice to young people wanting to go into science would be not to be lured by the prospect of such prizes.\n\n\u201cThe awards and prizes, well, they are charming and very much appreciated, but...you should enter science because you are fascinated by it. That\u2019s what I did,\u201d he told reporters via telephone after the award announcement.\n\nPhysics is the second Nobel to be awarded this week; William Kaelin, Gregg Semenza and Peter Ratcliffe shared the medicine prize on Monday for discoveries about how cells respond to oxygen levels.\n\nAmong the Nobels, physics has often taken centre stage with winners featuring some of the greatest names in science like Albert Einstein, Marie Curie and Niels Bohr, as well as ground-breaking inventors such as radio pioneer Guglielmo Marconi.\n\nUsing theoretical tools and calculations, Peebles was able to interpret trace radiation from the infancy of the universe and so discover new physical processes, the academy said.\n\nIt said that Mayor and Queloz announced the first discovery of a planet outside our own solar system, a so-called \u201cexoplanet\u201d, starting a revolution in astronomy. Over 4,000 exoplanets have since been found in the Milky Way.\n\n\u201cWith numerous projects planned to start searching for exoplanets, we may eventually find an answer to the eternal question of whether other life is out there,\u201d it said.\n\nFor a graphic of Nobel laureates:\n\nhere", "description": "Canadian-American cosmologist James Peebles and Swiss scientists Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz won the 2019 Nobel Prize for Physics on Tuesday for revealing the wonder of the evolution of the universe and discovering planets orbiting distant suns.", "authors": ["Niklas Pollard", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438398381&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF970LB", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
