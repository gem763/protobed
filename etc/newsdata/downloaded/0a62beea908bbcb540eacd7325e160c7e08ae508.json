Neo-Nazi demonstrations in Charlottesville, Virginia, had turned deadly when a far-right protester drove a car through a crowd, killing one and injuring dozens. Some movement leaders regrouped. Instead of stoking outrage, they set out to build support with another tack: Looking normal.\n\nThe larger goal was what many white nationalists call \u201cPhase 2\u201d \u2014 gaining mainstream acceptance for far-right ideas widely rejected as repugnant and getting white nationalists into positions of influence. The normalization effort included softened rhetoric and social gatherings that, for many groups, would increasingly replace confrontational rallies.\n\nMembers of the ShieldWall Network hold up balloons decorated as the face of Adolf Hitler and give a white-power hand signal as they celebrate the German fascist's birthday. \u201cThe strategy is internally focused now \u2014 having families get together,\u201d said alt-right blogger Brad Griffin, a self-avowed white nationalist from Montgomery, Alabama. He fondly recalled a river-tubing trip he organized in 2018 for friends who had attended a local white nationalist conference. The goal of such low-key gatherings, he said, is to spread far-right ideology away from the public spectacle of a public protest. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot more fun to do that than to go out and tangle with Antifa\u201d \u2014 members of America\u2019s far-left \u201canti-fascist\u201d movement \u2014 \u201cand get hit with piss balloons in the street.\u201d Griffin spoke in an interview before last weekend\u2019s massacre in El Paso, Texas \u2014 an event that has scrambled the calculus for the movement\u2019s aspiring normalizers. On Saturday, authorities say, 21-year-old Patrick Crusius shot and killed 22 people and wounded two dozen more shortly after a manifesto appeared online explaining his motivation and decrying a \u201cHispanic invasion\u201d of the United States. The El Paso attack has also put new pressure on a man some white nationalists praise as helping advance their movement: Donald Trump. The U.S. president has come under sustained criticism for his racially incendiary rhetoric since launching his candidacy in 2015 \u2014 including his repeated use of the word \u201cinvasion\u201d to describe immigration along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nJeff Schoep, former chairman of the National Socialist Movement, speaks during a rally at the state capitol in Little Rock. On Monday, Trump issued his most forceful disavowal of white supremacism to date. \u201cIn one voice, our nation must condemn racism, bigotry and white supremacy,\u201d Trump said in response to the weekend\u2019s shootings. \u201cThese sinister ideologies must be defeated.\u201d After Charlottesville, the lie-low approach was seen as a necessity by some in the movement. Many white nationalist groups were sued and lost access to social media, which has caused them to avoid public confrontations, said Heidi Beirich, who studies far-right groups for the Southern Poverty Law Center, a nonprofit civil rights organization that tracks extremists. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen many rallies since Charlottesville,\u201d she said. The combination of bad press, prosecutions and lost access to social media, has \u201cdepressed people in the movement\u201d and created a sense that \u201cmaybe the softer approach is the way to go.\u201d The shootings, and Trump\u2019s repudiation, leave the normalizers in a difficult, perhaps impossible spot. Their gambit was always a stretch.\n\nNational Socialist Movement member Harry Hughes patrols in the desert for undocumented immigrants south of his home in Maricopa. A Reuters photojournalist has observed the approach up close \u2014 at a children\u2019s nursery in a \u201cchurch\u201d run by the Ku Klux Klan (KKK); a restaurant-and-bar that caters to white supremacists in Georgia; a barbecue held in Arkansas by the ShieldWall Network, a self-avowed neo-Nazi group with dozens of members. Even as they described their hopes of mainstreaming, many members of these and other groups also voiced the violent tropes that animate the movement. One is the so-called Great Replacement conspiracy theory, common in white nationalist circles, which holds that leftist elites are engineering the replacement of white majorities globally through policies that encourage mass migrations as white birth rates decline. The manifesto tied to the El Paso shooting referenced the replacement theory in explaining why the shooter chose to kill Hispanic people.\n\nBilly Roper of the ShieldWall Network, a white nationalist group, attends a party at a home outside Atkins. Asked in a May interview how whites could regain demographic dominance, ShieldWall\u2019s leader, Billy Roper, told Reuters that promoting a higher birth rate among white people is helpful, but \u201cbullets\u201d would be faster. Roper said his organization doesn\u2019t advocate anything illegal but that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t disagree\u201d with the goals of the mass shooter who murdered 51 people at two Muslim mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand in March. That killer, too, had cited the replacement theory as a motive. In a phone interview after the Texas massacre, Roper said he didn\u2019t support the killings. But the victims, Roper said, \u201cwere just pawns in the Jewish game of demographic replacement of whites,\u201d adding that such \u201ccultural conflicts\u201d are an \u201cunfortunate fact of modern life\u201d in an increasingly diverse nation moving closer to racial \u201cbalkanization.\u201d\n\nSymbols of white nationalism are displayed on the jacket of a member of the National Socialist Movement as they gather before attending a rally at the state capitol in Little Rock. The strategy of trying to couch such extreme views in mainstream rhetoric is not new. One of the highest-profile examples of the normalization tack is that of David Duke, a former KKK grand wizard who traded the klan\u2019s signature white robes and pointy hats for a business suit, adopted more mainstream conservative talking points, and made the runoff election for Louisiana governor in 1991. Duke lost by a wide margin but drew support from about half the state\u2019s white voters. The normalization effort is also not universal. Some far-right groups are still known for confrontation, including the Proud Boys, who last October fought with people protesting a Republican Club event in New York City.\n\nArtwork depicting a Ku Klux Klan member resting on a hammock made of two lynched black corpses, tied at the feet, is seen on a menu at the Georgia Peach Oyster Bar. In Draketown, Georgia, Pat Lanzo runs a restaurant-and-bar that white supremacists have claimed as their own. Lanzo insists the Georgia Peach Oyster Bar is merely a celebration of free speech. \u201cWe\u2019re not racist,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hate everyone equally.\u201d The decor inside his bar is filled with the kind of racist tropes that remain a hard sell with mainstream America. His menus feature a drawing of a Klan member relaxing on a hammock made of two lynched black corpses tied together at the feet. And Lanzo has rented his property to neo-Nazis and klan members for cross burnings, a traditional show of force by the KKK in the American South. The image-scrubbing by today\u2019s white nationalists belies a long history of violence by far-right ideologues. In the ten years ending in 2018, murderers motivated by far-right ideology took the lives of 124 people in 62 incidents, according to the U.S. Extremist Crime Database, a collaboration of criminal justice researchers from multiple universities. The statistics include white supremacists but also those with other far-right agendas that are not focused on race, such as anti-government militants.\n\nHigh chairs are seen in a building owned by The Knights Party, outside Harrison, Arkansas. The organisation is opening an education center for the children of white nationalists. Thomas Robb, the national director of The Knights Party, a group formerly named the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, said the movement should think beyond confrontations and rallies. \u201cWhen the rally\u2019s over, what do you do?\u201d said Robb in an interview before the El Paso shootings. \u201cOur goal isn\u2019t so much to get membership, but influence. When people come to our website, they see responsible people who aren\u2019t using the \u2018N word\u2019 in every sentence.\u201d Instead, Robb said, the aim is to \u201cspeak like Corporate America\u201d as a way to make far-right ideas more palatable to a broader audience.\n\nJohn Carollo, a member of the ShieldWall Network, holds up a photo montage of (clockwise from top left) Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, Adolf Hitler, founder of the American Nazi Party George Lincoln Rockwell, Charleston church shooter Dylann Roof and Hitler\u2019s deputy Rudolf Hess, while attending a party at a home outside Atkins, Arkansas. White nationalists have always debated whether putting \u201creasonable clothing\u201d on their movement would get them further than street clashes and violence, said Mike German, a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice, a left-leaning policy institute. But the approach appears to have gained momentum under Trump in part because of the president\u2019s racially divisive rhetoric, said German, who previously spent years undercover with white nationalists as an agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). \u201cBefore, white nationalists were trying to shove their way into the mainstream,\u201d German said. \u201cNow, they\u2019re being invited in.\u201d It\u2019s far from clear whether many true believers are ready for life in the mainstream.\n\nA new member of the ShieldWall Network, Nicholas Holloway, and other members of the white nationalist group go boating to celebrate Adolf Hitler's birthday. This past April in Russellville, Arkansas, a lakeside college town, three members of the ShieldWall Network gathered to rent a houseboat and cruise around Lake Dardanelle. A Reuters photojournalist went with them. Moods were light; they toasted one another with Fireball whiskey shots, laughed when one of them dropped his phone in the lake and cooed as another cuddled with his pregnant wife. Later that night, the group would initiate a new recruit, Nicholas Holloway, and burn wooden swastikas.\n\nShortly after being initiated into the ShieldWall Network, a white nationalist group, new member Nicholas Holloway watches as a swastika is burned to celebrate Adolf Hitler's birthday.\n\nStory Two months later, in June, Holloway and two other ShieldWall members on the boat that day \u2014 Julian Calfy and John Carollo \u2014 were arrested for allegedly beating a gay man and holding a gun to his head after luring him to Calfy\u2019s home with a false dating advertisement, according to police reports. Calfy remains in jail, while the other two members are free on bail, according to a spokesman for the Pope County, Arkansas, Sheriff\u2019s Office. Each is charged with third-degree battery, first-degree terroristic threatening and first-degree criminal mischief in connection with the attack. Neither the defendants nor their attorneys could be reached for comment. Griffin, the alt-right blogger, condemned the El Paso shooting in stronger terms than other extremists who spoke to Reuters, calling it and other mass shootings by avowed white nationalists \u201cinsane tragedies.\u201d At the same time, Griffin said he supported resegregation of the races, echoing one of the core principles of the manifesto that authorities tied to the Texas shooter. The continuing violence, he said, undermines any attempt by the movement to gain more mainstream acceptance. At this point, he said, most white nationalists would rather just \u201cstay out of the debate.\u201d", "description": "Two years ago, America\u2019s white nationalist movement stunned the country.
