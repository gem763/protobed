Ron Wyden (D-OR) introduced a sweeping new data privacy bill aimed at forcing tech platforms to mind their own business and face tough penalties if they fail to meet new privacy and security standards.\n\nWyden\u2019s \u201cMind Your Own Business Act\u201d is the official version of a draft bill he circulated around to other members and consumer groups late last year. The legislation would empower the Federal Trade Commission with new authorities to fine tech companies that violate user privacy and bolster the agency with more resources to better regulate the industry in the future.\n\n\u201cMark Zuckerberg won\u2019t take Americans\u2019 privacy seriously unless he feels personal consequences,\u201d Wyden said in a statement. \u201cA slap on the wrist from the FTC won\u2019t do the job.\u201d\n\nIf approved, the bill would allow the FTC to establish minimum privacy and cybersecurity standards for tech platforms and give it the authority to issue fines of up to 4 percent of a company\u2019s annual revenue for first-time offenses, similar to provisions in the GDPR. The FTC has resolved a number of privacy investigations into companies like Facebook, YouTube, and Equifax over the past year, but officials have faced significant criticism for not taking stronger action.\n\nFTC Chairman Joe Simons has pleaded with Congress to empower the Commission with new authorities to fine companies for first-time privacy violations. Wyden\u2019s bill would do just that, and also make it a crime for senior executives of tech companies to knowingly lie to the agency in regards to privacy.\n\n\u201cConsumers must be able to control their own private information, companies must provide vastly more transparency about how they use and share our data,\u201d Wyden said. \u201cCorporate executives need to be held personally responsible when they lie about protecting our personal information.\u201d\n\nState attorneys general would be able to enforce the regulations in the Mind Your Own Business Act, too, putting more \u201ccops on the privacy beat\u201d other than just the FTC, according to a press release for the measure.\n\nWyden\u2019s bill would institute a federal Do Not Track requirement, giving users the option to opt out of data tracking that\u2019s used to target ads. Platforms like Facebook and Twitter would also be required to offer \u201cprivacy-protecting\u201d versions of their products for a fee. Interestingly, Wyden\u2019s measure would extend the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s Lifeline program for low-income people to use to obtain these privacy-focused versions of products so \u201cprivacy does not become a luxury good,\u201d as his office put it.\n\nLawmakers in both the House and Senate have introduced data privacy bills, but so far none have been put up for a vote. Leaders on the Senate Commerce Committee have said that they\u2019d introduce their own bill by the end of the year, but that\u2019s looking less likely as time goes on. One of the main sources of conflict has been whether to preempt states from legislating their own privacy regulations. Wyden\u2019s bill would not bar any states from creating those rules.", "description": "Wyden\u2019s \"Mind Your Own Business Act\" is the official version of a draft bill he circulated around to other members and consumer groups.
