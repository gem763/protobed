There's a reason for that: The video contains a sponsorship with the audiobook platform Audible, and her contract said there couldn't be other in-video ads on it. That meant that when YouTube put ads on the video (whose revenue went to UMG), it put her in violation of her contract, she said.\n\n\"It's not just the loss of income; it's a contract in breach,\" Ellis told Business Insider.\n\nEllis said that for many sponsorships on YouTube, creators will agree to turn off AdSense (revenue earned through in-video ads) on videos. But YouTube allows those who make a copyright claim, like UMG, the option to turn back on video ads, even though the creator had selected for them to be turned off.\n\nShe said Audible didn't break her contract or sue her, but she did receive a letter from the brand questioning why the video now contains ads.\n\nYouTube says 'the claim is valid'\n\nThe heart of Ellis' disagreement with YouTube and UMG is whether the copyright claim against her video is valid.\n\nIn the video, Ellis plays a portion of the song \"Song of the Roustabouts\" from the Disney film \"Dumbo,\" and in a voice-over, she breaks down the lyrics of the song and notes certain historical stereotypes within the lyrics.\n\nEllis said her use of the clip was protected under \"fair use,\" a part of US law that allows the limited use of copyrighted material without permission and often applies to cases like criticism of a work.\n\n\"It was such a clear-cut case of fair use, which YouTube claims to care about and to uphold, but functionally they do not,\" Ellis said.\n\nYouTube, for its part, said that UMG's claim was \"valid.\"\n\n\"Our Copyright team looked into this and confirmed that the claim is valid,\" YouTube wrote on Twitter in response to Ellis. \"We see that you've appealed the claim, which provides UMG with 30 days to review your appeal. If you would like to resolve the issue directly with them, please DM us for more info.\"\n\nWhen YouTube says a copyright claim is \"valid,\" that is usually determined by its software detecting copyrighted material in the video \u2014 in this instance, the clip. It doesn't account for things like fair use and lets the parties themselves \u2014 in this case, Ellis and UMG \u2014 resolve that type of dispute.\n\nBut in doing so, it favors the copyright holder, Ellis said. Even though there has been no legal action against her by UMG, YouTube has put ads in her video, with the revenue from them going to UMG.\n\nAnd though Ellis hasn't yet heard back from YouTube or UMG on her appeal, her contract with Audible has already been put in jeopardy.\n\nFor more on the business of influencers, according to YouTube and Instagram stars, check out these Business Insider Prime posts:", "description": "Lindsay Ellis said YouTube's way of handling a copyright claim from Universal put one of her sponsorships in jeopardy.", "authors": ["Amanda Perelli"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db75581dee0195347089e4c?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
