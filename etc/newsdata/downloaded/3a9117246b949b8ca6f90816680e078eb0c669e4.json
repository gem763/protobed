This allowed an unauthorized person to compose and send tweets via text message from the phone number,\u201d Twitter said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe account is now secure, and there is no indication that Twitter\u2019s systems have been compromised,\u201d Twitter added.\n\nMr. Dorsey, 42, co-founded Twitter in 2006. His account on the popular social networking service is followed by more than 4.2 million users.\n\n\n\nIn a letter sent in June in response to questions raised by members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mr. Dorsey said he protects his personal Twitter account using two-factor authentication \u2014 a security best practice in which a user is required to provide additional credentials beyond their password before gaining access to an account.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
