The two partygoers who were killed were not identified.\n\nThe investigation, which was being aided by the Texas Rangers and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, was hampered by a lack of cooperation from those in attendance, Meeks said.\n\n\"It appalls me that as many folks that were there have not been able to give us a better description of this shooter,\" he said, adding that investigators had interviewed 20 people.\n\n\"With this many people there, normally we would have a really good description of the shooter,\" he added.\n\nLater, on Sunday night, gunfire erupted during a vigil held for the victims shot at the homecoming party, an NBC Dallas-Fort Worth reporter, tweeted.\n\n\"Our news unit was hit at least three times,\" she said, adding that she had not seen anyone injured.\n\nThe Dallas Police Department was not immediately available to comment on reports regarding gunfire at the vigil.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Peter Szekely in New York, additional reporting by Subrat Patnaik in Bengaluru; Editing by Nick Zieminski and Himani Sarkar)", "description": "\"We believe this is a separate incident,\" Hunt County Sheriff Randy Meeks told a news conference on Sunday morning.
