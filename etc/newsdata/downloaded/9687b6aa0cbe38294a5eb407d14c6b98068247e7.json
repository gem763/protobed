It is no wonder that vexed voters are filled with fatigue and frustration over it all \u2014 longing for a return to a productive and convivial Congress and a chance to enjoy the best U.S. economy in 50 years.\n\nYes well.\n\nMeanwhile, one mysterious factor continues to percolate, and that is concern for the deep state \u2014 the so-called shadow government that has been working on a \u201csilent coup\u201d against Mr. Trump since before he even took office. Concern continues. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, in fact, on Thursday referred to the \u201cdeep state staff\u201d he believed to be at work within the Federal Reserve. Several newly released books are also exploring the deep state phenomenon. And lest we forget, talk radio kingpin Rush Limbaugh recently coined the helpful term \u201cdeep media\u201d to describe news organizations which appear to support deep state activities.\n\nAmericans haven\u2019t forgotten about the deep state either. A new Economist/YouGov poll has asked the trillion dollar question here: \u201cDo you think the \u2018deep state\u2019 is working to overthrow President Trump?\u201d\n\nThe answer: 38% of all Americans agree with that statement \u2014 up three percentage points since the pollster asked the question in September. Not to be overlooked, 81% of those who voted for Mr. Trump agree that the deep state is, indeed, at work. Find more numbers in the Poll du Jour at column\u2019s end.\n\nA MOMENT OF CIVILITY\n\n\u201cMy warmest condolences to the family and many friends of Congressman Elijah Cummings. I got to see first hand the strength, passion and wisdom of this highly respected political leader. His work and voice on so many fronts will be very hard, if not impossible, to replace,\u201d said President Trump on the sudden passing of the Maryland Democrat.\n\n\u201cAs a mark of respect for the memory and longstanding public service\u201d of the late lawmaker, Mr. Trump has also ordered the flag of the United States to be flown at half-staff at the White House, all public buildings, military posts and naval vessels through Friday.\n\nAOC REACHES \u2018UNFAVORABLE\u2019 TERRITORY\n\nShe was a young, outspoken, newly elected lawmaker showcased by an adoring media and featured in a documentary movie even before she set foot on Capitol Hill. Ten months later, however, and her favorability rating appears to be eroding, according to an academic source.\n\n\u201cAOC\u2019s unfavorability rating now rivals Trump and Pelosi levels. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has nearly as high an unfavorable rating during her short time in office as more seasoned politicians such as President Trump, Nancy Pelosi, Mitch McConnell and Joe Biden,\u201d writes New York Post political analyst Bob Fredericks, after reviewing the deep numbers of a new George Washington University survey.\n\n\u201cThe freshman Queens lawmaker was rated very unfavorable by 36% of voters and somewhat unfavorable by 9% for a total unfavorability rating of 45 percent,\u201d the analyst said.\n\nThat\u2019s almost up there with Mr. Trump, who had an overall 52% unfavorability mark, with 44% having a very unfavorable view. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi totaled 51% with 41% with a very unfavorable view. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden had a 49% overall unfavorable rating, with 34% with a very unfavorable view.\n\nSen. Bernard Sanders had an overall unfavorable rating of 48%, with 38% with a very unfavorable impression of the Vermont independent, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, meanwhile, notched an overall unfavorable mark of 44%, with 33% calling her very unfavorable.\n\nOO-LA-LA: MADE IN THE USA\n\nPresident Trump, first lady Melania Trump, several Cabinet members and dignitaries, Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner were among those who visited the Texas Hill Country on Thursday to tour a brand new Louis Vuitton handbag workshop located on 256 acres in rural Johnson County.\n\nVuitton chairman Bernard Arnault and top executives were there to greet them, in a moment of luxury, diplomacy and business.\n\nThe luxury handbags and totes produced at the new site will be emblazoned with four of Mr. Trump\u2019s favorite words: \u2018Made in the USA.\u201d\n\nThe company, incidentally, will employ 1,000 local people at the stone-and-glass facility \u2014 which will provide \u201cextensive training in leather goods craftsmanship\u201d to all employees, according to Women\u2019s Wear Daily. Also of note: Louis Vuitton sold $47 billion worth of merchandise last year.\n\nMUST-SEE CONSERVATIVE TV\n\nIt looks like the media moguls are finally understanding that there is a huge audience of conservative viewers around the nation. The consistent, record-breaking ratings at Fox News is evidence of that. Here comes some competition though: Viacom has \u201cquietly\u201d debuted a conservative news channel on Pluto TV, a digital platform it acquired for $340 million in March, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nThe channel is simply called First and will feature two initial offerings: \u201cI\u2019m Right\u201d with Jesse Kelly and \u201cThe Buck Sexton Show.\u201d Mr. Kelly is a U.S. Marine Corps vet and former congressional candidate in Arizona, Mr. Sexton is a syndicated talk-radio host.
