The Georgians provided a genuine contest, making 128 tackles in the first half to put up a defensive wall as the Wallabies struggled to translate an attacking game plan for the slippery conditions.\n\nGeorgia finished with 201 tackles against a Wallabies lineup that dominated the ball but failed to capitalize.\n\n\"I thought we defended with big hearts today,\" Georgia coach Milton Haig said. \"We did the country proud.\"\n\nIt wasn't until a Koroibete moment of individual brilliance that Australia put real distance between itself and Georgia on the scoreboard.\n\nPoor passes went to ground in three consecutive movements by the Australian backline, before Koroibete swooped on a loose ball, picked it up running toward the wrong end, before turning and straightening up, stepping inside and outside two defenders, and then cutting back inside the cover defense to score in the 60th.\n\nToomua converted to make 17-3 but it was the Georgians who scored next, against the run of play. After a wild tap for a Georgian lineout win, flyhalf Lasha Khmaladze stepped through a big gap in the midfield and fed left wing Alexander Todua to sprint into the corner.\n\nIt cut the margin to 17-8 but the fatiguing Georgians struggled to keep matching the Australians late.\n\nBack-rower Jack Dempsey barged over from a driving maul following a close-range lineout in the 75th, and replacement scrumhalf Will Genia finished off an enterprising attacking raid just before fulltime to secure the bonus point.\n\nAustralia is on top of Pool D, but Six Nations champion Wales finishes off the pool against Uruguay on Sunday and is expected to remain unbeaten and clinch the pool to move into a quarterfinal against France. s\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.
