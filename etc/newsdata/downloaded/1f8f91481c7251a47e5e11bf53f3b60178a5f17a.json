When it does, the Transit PHEV can be set to switch automatically to full-electric drive based on GPS data.\n\nThat won\u2019t be happening in the U.S., though. A company spokesperson told Fox News Autos that the Transit PHEV won\u2019t be coming to the U.S. anytime soon because it is based on the one-ton version of the van, not the two-ton currently built and sold here.\n\nFord is working on an all-American all-electric hauler, however, in the form of a battery-powered F-150 that's scheduled to go on sale in a couple of years.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM", "description": "Knows when to switch.", "authors": ["Gary Gastelu", "Gary Gastelu Is Foxnews.Com'S Automotive Editor.
