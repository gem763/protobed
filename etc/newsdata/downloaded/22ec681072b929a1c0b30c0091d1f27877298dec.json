(Like a number of the Democratic presidential candidates, Ms. Warren is in favor of decriminalizing unauthorized border crossings.) And the sense that Ms. Warren, who has voted in Congress for a ban on assault weapons, is soft on gun rights also plays into the notion that she would leave Rockland unprotected. The 49-year-old voted for Mr. Trump in 2016 and fully plans to do so again in 2020, with the \u201cgood job\u201d the president is doing on the economy. (After speaking to me, he climbed into a car with a National Rifle Association sticker affixed to the back windshield.)\n\nAs Ms. Warren\u2019s Senate campaigns attest, she is by no means uniformly unpopular in Rockland or, for that matter, in neighboring communities with a similar socio-economic profile.\n\n\u201cI love Elizabeth Warren,\u201d said a welder and member of a plumbers union local, age 68, by phone. \u201cShe\u2019s my bulldog. She is 100 percent for us \u2014 for the working man, the exploited person, the underdog.\u201d He is from Weymouth, next door to Rockland. \u201cIf she were a man, they would love her.\u201d He paused. \u201cOr they would like her more.\u201d\n\nAs he explained, places like Rockland, on the South Shore of Massachusetts, need to be understood as products of \u201cwhite flight\u201d from Boston, following court-ordered school busing in the mid-1970s.\n\nShould she win the Democratic nomination, it\u2019s easy to see the difficulties she will face in gaining the allegiance of the white working class in a matchup with Mr. Trump. White flight also defines a number of working-class suburbs in the Midwest, as in the metropolitan Detroit region.\n\nBut even though the Warren Paradox will be a real challenge, she still has the opportunity to impress potentially unreceptive voters with her \u201cbulldog\u201d tenacity, as in her visit this year to a small town in West Virginia to talk about the opioid crisis \u2014 a state, 93 percent white, taken by Mr. Trump in 2016 by nearly 42 points. She has also put gut economic issues at the centerpiece of her agenda: For instance, her \u201cPlan for Economic Patriotism,\u201d an industrial-policy tack calling for such steps as \u201cmore actively managing\u201d the currency value of the dollar \u201cto promote exports and domestic manufacturing\u201d and a tenfold increase in government spending on job apprenticeship programs, won praise from the Fox News commentator Tucker Carlson. \u201cIt\u2019s just pure old-fashioned economics: how to preserve good-paying American jobs,\u201d he told his audience, a form of \u201ceconomic nationalism.\u201d\n\nAnd to be sure, while white working-class voters get a great deal of attention in battleground states like Michigan, if Democrats can increase turnout among African-American voters in 2020, that would help counterbalance any weakness among white working-class voters.", "description": "She has struggled with white, working-class voters like those important to winning Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.", "authors": ["Paul Starobin"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/18/opinion/18starobin/18starobin-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
