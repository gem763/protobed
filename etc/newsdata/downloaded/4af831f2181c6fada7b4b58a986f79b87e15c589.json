If you play it later, then that's when we are finished for Christmas so you'd have Santa Claus giving us the World Cup.\"\n\nChanging the time frame could affect competitions such as Europe's Six Nations, traditionally staged in February-March, and the southern hemisphere's Rugby Championship - already curtailed in a World Cup year - as well as major domestic leagues.\n\nWorld Rugby is not a one member, one vote organisation - the Six Nations and the Four Nations countries have three votes each for example.\n\nWorld Rugby's plan for a new World League collapsed earlier this year when the major powers couldn't agree, suggesting attempts to move the World Cup might prove equally thorny.\n\nSome observers point to how FIFA, football's governing body, responded to the outcry over the decision to stage the 2022 World Cup in Qatar's summer heat by moving it to November-December, interrupting several major domestic leagues.\n\nBut World Rugby officials do not have the same freedom of action.\n\nTellingly, the outcry at this World Cup only really started when Japan-Scotland, which has become a decisive game, was under threat from Hagibis.\n\nEngland coach Eddie Jones, a former Japan boss, said the weather row should not detract from the first World Cup to be staged in Asia.\n\n\"We are in the midst of a great tournament,\" he said, adding the \"typhoon gods\" had smiled on England by giving them extra preparation time for the quarter-finals.\n\nNow Scotland will hope they smile on them as well.", "description": "How has it come to this, that ahead of one of the most eagerly anticipated games of the RWC, the talk is of weather forecasts and threats of legal action?", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2481/c59518ac81c3448b84618e12d21a7101.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
