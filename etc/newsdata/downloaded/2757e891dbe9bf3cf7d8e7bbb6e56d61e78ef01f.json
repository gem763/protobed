Mazloum Abdi of the Syrian Democratic Forces, said his intelligence unit had a source who was privy to the layout of al-Baghdadi\u2019s secret compound near the Turkish border. According to Abdi, the source passed along such details to U.S. Special Ops, who used it to formulate their plans to strike the terror chief\u2019s hideout over the weekend.\n\n\u201cThe source, whom Abdi described as one of al-Baghdadi\u2019s security advisers, proved to U.S. intelligence that he had direct access to al-Baghdadi this summer by turning over the ISIS leader\u2019s used underwear and later a sample of his blood,\u201d NBC News reports. \u201cU.S. intelligence tested those samples and got positive DNA matches for al-Baghdadi, kicking the hunt into high gear. The informant stole the underwear about three months ago and the blood sample was taken roughly one month ago, a Kurdish official said.\u201d\n\nThe revelation comes after President Donald Trump confirmed Sunday morning that al-Baghdadi was killed in a U.S. military operation in northwest Syria.\n\nPresident Trump said that the terror chief fled from U.S. military personnel during the Saturday operation and detonated a suicide vest in a dead-end tunnel, killing himself and three children.\n\nAn on-site DNA test confirmed Baghdadi\u2019s identity.\n\nPresident Trump revealed that al-Baghdadi had been under surveillance for weeks leading up to the operation, which involved the assistance of Russia, Turkey, Syria, Iraq, and Syrian Kurds.\n\n\u201cHe was whimpering, screaming and crying, and frankly, I think it\u2019s something that should be brought out so that his followers and all of these young kids that want to leave various countries \u2013 including the United States \u2013 they should see how he died,\u201d the president said of al-Baghdadi\u2019s final moments. \u201cHe didn\u2019t die a hero, he died a coward \u2013 crying, whimpering, and screaming and bringing three kids with him to die. Certain death.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo personnel were lost in the operation,\u201d he added, \u201cwhile a large number of Baghdadi\u2019s fighters and companions were killed with him.\u201d\n\nThe UPI contributed to this report.", "description": "A Kurdish general revealed an informant stole the underwear of ISIS leader\u00a0al-Baghdadi to prove to his credibility U.S. intelligence.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-underpants-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
