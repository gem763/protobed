Will it be the moment when we stopped the madness of Brexit or when we amputated ourselves from our continent?\n\nTomorrow is a defining moment in our nation\u2019s history, both in parliament and on the streets. MPs will vote on Boris Johnson\u2019s terrible sell-out deal. And hundreds of thousands of people will march on Parliament Square in favour of a Final Say referendum.\n\nThis is our chance to make a difference. We can defeat the Prime Minister\u2019s deal; we can force through a People\u2019s Vote; and we can then win that referendum and stay in the EU.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nPro-European MPs are still finalising their plans. One idea is to reject the deal until and unless legislation passes \u2013 at which point they could push for a referendum. Another is to fight for a referendum tomorrow. But whatever precise mechanism is decided, we must stop the deal and then go to a Final Say vote.\n\nOur future is on a knife-edge, so everybody must do their bit. Lobby your MP; turn up at tomorrow\u2019s march; bring your friends and family. People power can really make a difference.\n\nJohnson has negotiated an even worse deal than Theresa May. He has turned Northern Ireland into a colony of the EU and plans an extremely hard Brexit for Great Britain \u2013 out of its customs union and single market. About the only good thing that people can say about his deal is that it gets Brexit done, and even that isn\u2019t true. This is just the first stage: the divorce. We will be negotiating our future relationship with the EU for years. The only way to get shot of Brexit is to stop it entirely.\n\nIf the prime minister really believed he had done a good deal, he would put it to the people in a referendum, but even he is sick and tired of Brexit. He wants to talk about the NHS, schools, more bobbies on the beat and investment in infrastructure. And he\u2019s right. We desperately need to fix our country. But Brexit is no solution to these problems. It will make them worse.\n\nJohnson\u2019s deal will thwack the economy and so knock the public finances by up to \u00a349bn year, according to a new report by The UK in a Changing Europe. Think of how many hospitals and schools we could afford if only we stay in Europe.\n\nIt's not just about money, though. Politicians will be obsessing about the fallout from Brexit until the cows come home. The best way to get them to focus on the real problems Britain faces is just to stop Brexit.\n\nLet\u2019s also remember the value of Europe, too \u2013 what I call the four \u201cPs\u201d: peace, power, prosperity and people. The EU underpins peace throughout our continent. It is not something far away or in the distant past. It is here and now. Removing borders has helped foster peace in Northern Ireland. Europe leverages our power on the world stage. Our alliance with 27 other like-minded countries lets us stand up to bullies anywhere, whether Donald Trump or Vladimir Putin. It also means we can make a bigger difference in the big global challenges such as the battle to stop our planet succumbing to climate change.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
