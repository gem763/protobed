The way both his legs flew out was a real tell-tale sign for any experienced match official so I was surprised Pitana was taken in.\n\nThat free-kick led to the first goal. Some questioned whether it should have stood with Paul Pogba in an offside position. He didn't touch the ball and wasn't interfering with play so the goal was rightly allowed.\n\nRef Nestor Pitana got the big decision right during the World Cup final with France's penalty\n\nThey were awarded a penalty after a VAR review adjudged Ivan Perisic to have handled the ball\n\nOlivier Giroud (right) and Lucas Hernandez were among the French players calling for a pen\n\nLater in the half France took a corner which Blaise Matuidi flicked on and the ball was knocked out of play by Ivan Perisic who appeared to use his hand. Pitana and his on-field team were unsighted and, as it was a serious offence which was not seen, it was correct to review it.\n\nVAR did its job in suggesting that the on-field referee look at replays and decide for himself.\n\nDisappointingly there appeared to be technological issues when Pitana went to watch those replays.\n\nThere was plenty of debate around what constitutes deliberate handball but the movement of the arm to the ball means it was deliberate and a penalty was the correct decision.\n\nPitana reviews footage of the incident thanks to VAR as play is halted for him to see it back", "description": "GRAHAM POLL - MY VERDICT: Croatia, masters of the dark arts, were initially undone by a dive which fooled Nestor Pitana, the Argentinian referee.", "authors": ["Graham Poll For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/15/22/4E4A225E00000578-0-image-a-6_1531689658474.jpg", "published_at": "2018-07-15"}
