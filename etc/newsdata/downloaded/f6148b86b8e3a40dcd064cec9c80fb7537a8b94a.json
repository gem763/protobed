But the event, which ushered in the game\u2019s eleventh season and its all-new redesigned map, was one of the biggest singular online gaming events to date \u2014 with more than 7 million concurrent viewers across Twitch, Twitter, and YouTube.\n\nEpic Games tells The Verge that the black hole event, officially called \u201cThe End,\u201d amassed record-breaking viewership on Twitter and Twitch. It also clocked in as one of the most viewed YouTube gaming events ever, although far from the biggest live event on that platform.

That\u2019s \u201cthe platform\u2019s peak concurrent record on a single game category,\u201d Epic says.\n\nOn Twitter, the black hole event was the \u201cmost viewed gaming event on Twitter, with 50.7 million minutes watched and 42.8 million views.\u201d Epic says it peaked at 1.4 million concurrent viewers. On YouTube, far and away the largest of the three platforms, Fortnite black hole viewership hit 4.3 million concurrent viewers across all channels. The company is not sharing how many players tuned in for the live event in-game, although that figure may be revealed at some point in the future.", "description": "It\u2019s been just over a week since Fortnite came back online following a two-day, black hole-induced hiatus.
