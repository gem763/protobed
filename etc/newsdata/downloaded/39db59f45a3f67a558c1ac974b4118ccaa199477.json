So he\u2019s got a 50 basis point cut and then that\u2019s sufficient? Well, that doesn\u2019t seem very likely.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe more bullish sentiments are something which probably permeates the Fed more than you see in the dots,\u201d Ruskin said. \u201cYou have a dove there, but someone who is not really prepared to stick his neck out in terms of some of the longer term thinking. I would have thought the more extreme doves would have had dots at 1% next year, they could have had dots below 1%. That\u2019s perfectly reasonable. It\u2019s reasonable to think that maybe even Fed funds hits zero. There are extreme views out there and Bullard has shown he is really not one of them,\u201d Ruskin said.\n\nThere will be several more Fed speakers on Friday. Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida will be interviewed on CNBC at 10 a.m. and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren will give a speech at New York University around 11:20 a.m. Eastern.", "description": "St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said Friday a slowing economy was one reason he wanted the central bank to cut short-term interest rates by a more...", "authors": ["Greg Robb", "Senior Economics Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR703_bullar_ZG_20190920061047.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
