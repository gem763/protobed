During the course of the traffic stop, police discovered the 19-year-old had an outstanding warrant.\n\nBanks tells the officers that he plays for the Tennessee Volunteers, and asks them to call his head coach Jeremy Pruitt.\n\nThe officers do get Pruitt on the phone, though, despite being aware of the previous traffic ticket, Pruitt says he did not not know about Banks\u2019 warrant for failing to appear in court.\n\nBanks eventually becomes belligerent with the officers while sitting in the back of the cruiser.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the police, bro. Hell nah. Y\u2019all police are some p*****s, bro. Real shit, I don\u2019t f*ck with y\u2019all.\u201d\n\nDirecting his tirade at a female doing a ride-along with the officers, Banks said: \u201cYou don\u2019t wanna be an intern because where I\u2019m from we shoot at cops. I\u2019m from Memphis, Tennessee.\u201d\n\nThe video released by WBIR is over an hour long, however, Banks begins ranting at the officers around the 13:50 mark.\n\nWatch:\n\nBanks released a statement apologizing for the incident on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI want to sincerely apologize to my family, the University of Tennessee and the law enforcement community. I deeply regret my language and attitude in the video.\u201dI have great respect for our policemen and women, and I am embarrassed by my actions that night. That\u2019s not who I am. I promise to be a better representative for the University of Tennessee moving forward.\u201d\n\nVolunteers head coach Jeremy Pruitt also commented on the matter, \u201cWe will address the matter internally. I\u2019m determined to do what I can to help Jeremy grow up and become a better man. Our team and staff respect our law enforcement and we will continue to educate our players on how to carry themselves at all times.\u201d\n\nBanks did not play in Tennessee\u2019s game against Florida on September 22nd.\n\nFollow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn", "description": "Police have released footage of the September arrest Tennessee linebacker Jeremy Banks, where he tells officers, \"Where I'm from, we shoot", "authors": ["Dylan Gwinn"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/AP-Photo_Wade-Payne-1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
