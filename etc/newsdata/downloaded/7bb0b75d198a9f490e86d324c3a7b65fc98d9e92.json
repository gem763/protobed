In the UK he has the right to change his gender on his own birth certificate so why not his child's? Surely if you are going to move with modern times, the law has to finish the journey it has started.\n\n\"Equality shouldn't have to come at a price, but this case has taken three years, hours of work and manpower, public attention and yet the courts still failed to help this family set out its actual family structure correctly in terms of its legal status.\n\n\"A birth certificate will stay with a child for life and it will be factually and legally inaccurate under current rules.\n\n\"Freddy is considering whether he wishes to appeal, and we have no instructions on that at present.\n\n\"We hope though others will pick up the chalice as well and look to bring UK law in line with other more progressive countries.\"\n\nRead more from Yahoo News UK:\n\nLondon-Sydney flight times to be cut to four hours by 2030s\n\nPope urges people to stop using adjectives to describe Christianity\n\nPoll shows 43% of the country thinks Boris Johnson should resign\n\nMr McConnell, 32, who had a child using a sperm donor, claims in the documentary Seahorse: The Dad Who Gave Birth that pregnancy would be taken more seriously if more men gave birth.\n\nIn the film, which portrays his fatherhood journey over three years, he says: \u201cIf all men got pregnant then pregnancy would be taken so much more seriously and talked about.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cF***, it\u2019s f***ing awful.
