The septuagenarian professional politician is swooping over the American landscape in her billowing jackets, threatening to once again lay waste to the presidential election process. Last time around, Republicans were relieved to have survived her reign of error. As All Hallow\u2019s Eve draws near, it is her own Democrats who are faced with uncertainty over what her threatened political resurrection might unleash.\n\nThe former first lady cum Democratic presidential wannabe, currently on a national tour with daughter Chelsea to promote \u201cThe Book of Gutsy Women\u201d as their new brand of feminism, spooked the party establishment recently with a less-than-subtle threat to upend the crowded field of contenders with her soliloquy on the 2020 presidential election.\n\n\u201cAll that matters is that we win,\u201d Mrs. Clinton told an audience of admirers at Revolution Hall in Portland, Oregon, as reported by news station KGW8. \u201cI hate to be so, you know, simplistic about it. We have to nominate the best . I say all of that because it\u2019s hard to know who\u2019s going to be the best candidate to beat this president, assuming this president is still running. I mean this is a really complicated political environment.\u201d\n\nTranslation: None of the current crop of candidates stands head and shoulders above the others, and no one has yet proved to have the chops to beat President Trump. So a certain someone (you know who) might yet prove to be the best candidate.\n\nFor the dozen or so Democrats struggling to reach the top of the candidacy heap, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s pointed comments are like an enchanted silver dagger in the heart, or the back. Thus far, the party faithful face a choice of candidates positioned on the left, more left and most left along the political spectrum, each one running on promises to spend money on socialist programs costing anywhere from trillions to tens of trillions of dollars that the nation doesn\u2019t have.\n\nHillary has singled out Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, for a special spell, charging her with being a \u201cRussian asset,\u201d though offering no evidence: \u201cShe is a favorite of the Russians,\u201d Hillary cackled to the Campaign HQ podcast hosted by former Obama campaign manager David Plouffe. \u201cThey have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far. That\u2019s assuming Jill Stein will give it up, which she might not because she is also a Russian asset.\u201d\n\nSo Ms. Stein, whose third-party run in 2016 cost Hillary votes, was a Russian puppet, and Ms. Gabbard, a major in the Hawaii Army National Guard, is too. This from the woman who jeopardized national security when she placed sensitive secrets on an unsecure email server and whose campaign paid for a dossier on Mr. Trump filled with unverified political dirt provided by foreign sources. Nonsense.\n\nTo be sure, Hillary has choice words as well for the man who denied her the political prize she craved \u2014 and still covets. In recently rehashing her loss to Mr. Trump on PBS News Hour, she raised the possibility of a rematch. \u201cI mean, obviously, I can beat him again,\u201d she boasted. Her peculiar definition of \u201cbeat\u201d \u2014 winning the popular vote, losing the Electoral College and thus the White House \u2014 smacks of the musing of someone seriously out of touch with reality.\n\nDemocratic voters have moved on even if Hillary has not. The candidate with momentum is Elizabeth Warren, a slightly younger version of Hillary \u2014 blondish, Ivy League-ish, and without the decades of baggage that has left the former secretary of State sagging beneath the weight. Ms. Warren may fall short in her campaign erected upon promises to quadruple federal spending on schools to the tune of $800 billion, and to shake every piggybank from coast to coast for the trillions to spend on Medicare for All and the Green New Deal, but \u201cI\u2019m with her\u201d isn\u2019t going to fly in 2020, broomstick or not.\n\nHillary\u2019s bold talk of a rematch with Donald Trump is nothing more than a flight of fancy, but her incessant murmurings about getting even are spooking the political landscape. For the sake of her party, the angry lady ought to drop the \u201cHilloween\u201d routine and save her incantations for those private conversations with the ceiling before bitterness gives way to sleep.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
