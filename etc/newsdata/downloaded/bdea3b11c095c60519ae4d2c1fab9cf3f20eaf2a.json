Jim Jordan (R-OH) reacted to Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, finally speaking out regarding his business dealings with companies in Ukraine and China.\n\nJordan said from the beginning that the American public knew something was \u201cwrong\u201d about Hunter Biden getting the board position with Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma when he had no experience in the field, adding it is time to \u201cdeal with the issues that the American people care about\u201d rather than attacking President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cWe just know that this stuff smells,\u201d Jordan emphasized. \u201cI mean, the whole arrangement with China, the billion dollars from the subsidiary bank of the Bank of China, this arrangement with Burisma, this company in the Ukraine where Biden had no experience, didn\u2019t know the language, no experience in the energy sector and not an expert on Ukraine and gets this position. I think the American people, again, they saw this for what it is. They know it smells, they know it\u2019s wrong and that\u2019s the facts. Look. let\u2019s deal with the issues that the American people care about now.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Democrats] are so focused on attacking the president. That\u2019s all they want to do in this process that they\u2019ve begun,\u201d he added.\n\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent", "description": "Tuesday, Rep.
