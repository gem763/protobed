But the enemy soon learned that they could not weaken the spirit of our people. In times of distress, the heart of the American patriot only grows stronger and more determined,\" Trump said. \"Here on the western side of the Pentagon, we saw brave men and women rush into the fire and race into the scorching flames to rescue their colleagues. When evil seeks to do us harm, the incredible men and women of the United States military answer with unyielding valor and unstoppable resolve.\"\n\nOn September 11, 2001, the world witnessed the power of American defiance. pic.twitter.com/ivPsnxer9h \u2014 The White House (@WhiteHouse) September 11, 2019\n\n\"If anyone dares to strike our land, we will respond with the full measure of American power and the iron will of the American spirit.\" pic.twitter.com/RU7QOeiI1Z \u2014 The White House (@WhiteHouse) September 11, 2019\n\nThe President also said the United States is hitting the Taliban harder than ever before.\n\n\"We had peace talks scheduled a few days ago. I called them off when I learned that they had killed a great American soldier from Puerto Rico and 11 other innocent people. They thought they would use this attack to show strength. But actually, what they showed is unrelenting weakness. The last four days, we have hit our enemy harder than they have ever been hit before, and that will continue,\" he said. \"And if, for any reason, they come back to our country, we will go wherever they are and use power the likes of which the United States has never used before. And I'm not even talking about nuclear power. They will have never seen anything like what will happen to them. No enemy on Earth can match the overwhelming strength, skill, and might of the American Armed Forces.\"", "description": ".09/12/2019 3:04:43AM EST.", "authors": ["Katie Pavlich", "Beth Baumann", "Alex Nitzberg"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/254/587b1b05-cb38-42c2-8c89-7d51a4b05e77.png", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
