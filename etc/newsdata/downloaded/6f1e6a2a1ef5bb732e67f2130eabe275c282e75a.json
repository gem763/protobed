Check Out Municipal Bonds\n\nBy Randall W.Forsyth\n\nBarron's\n\nAug. 30, 2019 1:19 pm ET\n\n...\n\nEven higher tax-free yields can be found in another relatively obscure\n\npart of the fixed-income market, closed-end muni funds. CEFs differ\n\nfrom open-end mutual funds in two important respects: They issue a set\n\nnumber of shares, which aren\u2019t redeemed, but instead trade like stocks\n\nat prices that may be above or below their net asset values, and they\n\noften borrow money to leverage their portfolios. That increases both\n\nyield and risk.\n\nThe main danger is that their cost of borrowing can rise, cutting\n\ndistributions, and, in turn, the share price. That typically happens\n\nwhen the Fed is raising its policy rates. The current likelihood is\n\nthat those rates will fall, however; federal-funds futures put a 95.8%\n\nprobability on a quarter-point cut at the policy meeting ending on\n\nSept. 18, according to the CME Group\u2019s FedWatch site, as of midday\n\nFriday.\n\nKotok also points out that muni closed-end funds tend to have limited\n\nliquidity, because most are most small- or microcap stocks. That\n\nshould be less of a problem for individual investors looking to buy or\n\nsell the bigger funds. And the rewards are tax-free yields over 4% in\n\nmany cases,\n\nBut investors should look beyond just yield and take into account\n\nvaluation. For instance, Pimco Municipal Income Fund II (ticker: PML),\n\nyields 4.9%, but trades at 23.97% above its net-asset value, according\n\nto CEFconnect.com. Paying $1.24 for a dollar\u2019s worth of assets isn\u2019t\n\nexactly a value play.\n\nSlightly lower yields are available at significant discounts from the\n\nNuveen Quality Municipal Income fund (NAD), with a 4.42% yield at a\n\n10.36% discount, and Nuveen AMT-Free Quality Municipal Income fund\n\n(NEA), 4.47% yield at a 9.52% discount. These funds have respective\n\nmarket capitalizations of $3.2 billion and $4.1 billion, which should\n\nmake for better liquidity than smaller funds.\n\nInvestors looking for a return of capital at a future date, similar to\n\na bond, can consider the BlackRock Municipal 2030 Target Term Trust\n\n(BTT), one of Barron\u2019s top income picks for 2019. Its lower yield of\n\n3.14% reflects less risk from possible rising yields and falling bond\n\npriwces, owing to the fund\u2019s shorter effective duration. It also is\n\namong the larger muni CEFs, with a $1.8 billion stock-market value.\n\n...", "description": "Want Good, Safe Yields?
