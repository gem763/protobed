The zone was excluded from an earlier restart announced on Aug. 26.\n\nThe company was not immediately available for a comment outside regular business hours.\n\nThe mining industry is grappling with a rising number of illegal miners, also known as artisanal miners, who break into sites in search of metals. At least 43 illegal miners died at a Glencore facility in July in Congo after a landslide.", "description": "Canadian miner Iamgold Corp has partially halted work at its Rosebel gold mine in Suriname after an influx of illegal miners blockaded operations, local media reported on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}
