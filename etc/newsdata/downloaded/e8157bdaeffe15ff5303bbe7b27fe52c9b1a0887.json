Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n\nIn a quest for a safer helmet, the NFL is starting a $3 million program aimed at the development of new headgear that outperforms anything currently available.\n\nManufacturers, engineers and entrepreneurs all are welcome to submit prototypes in the NFL Helmet Challenge, with the goal of reducing head trauma.\n\nThe league will provide $2 million in grant funding to support development, with as much as $1 million awarded for a prototype that would be used to help reduce concussions.\n\n\u201cHelmet technology is advancing at an impressive rate. Yet we believe that even more is possible,\u201d said Jeff Miller, the NFL\u2019s executive vice president for health and safety, in a news release. \u201cThe NFL Helmet Challenge represents an unprecedented combination of financing, research, data and engineering expertise in an effort to create a more protective helmet.\u201d\n\nThe NFL Helmet Challenge will culminate in May 2021. Participants will have access to the NFL\u2019s video review data on helmet safety as well as models of modern football helmets.\n\n\u201cInnovation can be catalyzed if we engage with creative and talented people from across disciplines to attack this challenge together,\u201d Miller said. \u201cIn collaboration with the NFL Players Association, we are making changes on and off the field in an effort to improve protection for every player. Trying to ensure that players wear the best possible helmet is a substantial part of that commitment.\u201d\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "In a quest for a safer helmet, the NFL is starting a $3 million program aimed at the development of new headgear that outperforms anything currently available.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429211894&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B21P-OCASP"}
