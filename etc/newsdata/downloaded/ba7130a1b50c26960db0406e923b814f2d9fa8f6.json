I\u2019m Grandma Winnie. I\u2019m 100 years old, and all I want for my birthday is for someone to impeach this \u2026 sucker.\u2019\n\nAfter pausing for comedic effect, Grandma Winnie then throws her MAGA hat to the side with a smile.\n\nHopefully Grandma Winnie gets her wish! \ud83d\ude02 pic.twitter.com/fdohMHJL1t \u2014 Monica Graham (@graham_monica) October 22, 2019\n\nShe\u2019s got company, as a new CNN poll reports that 50% of Americans say Trump should be impeached and removed from office, with 43% disagreeing \u2014 the first time support for his impeachment and removal has significantly outpaced opposition. It led to the term \u201chalf of Americans\u201d trending on Twitter again early Tuesday, after earlier polls have also suggested that support is growing for the impeachment inquiry.\n\nRelated: How to make sense of different polls on impeachment\n\nSupport is split largely along partisan lines, with 87% of Democrats in the new CNN poll wanting to see Trump impeached and removed, joined by 50% of independents \u2014 with 6% of Republicans sharing that preference. The CNN report noted that Trump\u2019s overall approval rating is still holding steady at 41%.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the Grandma Winnie video is legit, however. The original clip appears to have first been shared on Instagram on Monday by activist art project Indecline 2020, which has used street art, film and parody to \u201cexpose justices carried out by both corporations and government agencies.\u201d The lead clip on its Indiegogo page even parodies a Trump ransom video, where an actor pretending to be the president (whose wrists are in handcuffs) asks for donations for the art project. The group has raised a little over $19,000 toward its $250,000 goal. It did not immediately respond to a MarketWatch request for comment.\n\nBut many on Twitter were indeed eating the video up, with several expressing surprise at Grandma Winnie\u2019s appearing to be a Trump supporter at first but then ending her video on the cusp of dropping an F-bomb against the president.\n\n\u201cOmg. Saw the hat and thought she was MAGA,\u201d wrote one commentator.\n\n\u201cLove how she tosses the hat at the end,\u201d added another user under the name Ex-GOP Outcast.\n\n\u201cAnd we all know that \u2018sucker\u2019 could have been a different word,\u201d chimed in a user named Jeri.", "description": "A new poll finds half of Americans support impeaching Trump.
