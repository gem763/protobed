An accord would mean a much lower rate, below 5% in both years.\n\n\u201cIn the event of a disorderly, no deal Brexit, the key channels through which the economy will be affected will be through shocks to the exchange rate, trade, consumption and investment, leading to a marked deterioration in economic conditions,\u201d according to the bank.\n\nIreland\u2019s economy is considered the most vulnerable in the EU to a no-deal Brexit -- talks on a divorce settlement have stalled over how to keep the Irish border invisible after the U.K. exits the bloc. In a no-deal scenario, growth would ease to 0.8% in 2020, as opposed to 4.3% if a deal can be agreed.", "description": "No-Deal Brexit Would Cost Ireland 73,000 Jobs, Central Bank Says", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic3973a0c113278de598d2748eb969c9fd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
