I remember seeing myself on screen and thinking: 'Oh my God, it is really falling out.'\n\n'One of my mates had a transplant and he looked so much better afterwards that I didn't recognise him.\n\nChange: The TV had noticed his hair loss for some time and was swayed to get the procedure after seeing himself on screen (pictured in June 2018)\n\n'I was blown away by the improvement and he told me he wished he had done it earlier.\n\n'I thought if I am going to do it, I should act now so that I can get the benefits for longer.\n\n'I want to get my hair back to what it was like before so that I can style it at the front any way that I like. It would great to be in a position to have an Elvis quiff and really have some fun with my hair.'\n\nJack said: 'I decided to have it done because my hair loss has really escalated in the last year, particularly at the front of my scalp'\n\nAt the start of Coronation Street's two week Christmas break, Jack had the same follicular unit extraction procedure as stars such as Wayne Rooney and Calum Best.\n\nFollicles were removed individually from the back of Jack's scalp and then replanted by Dr Shahmalak in the balding areas around his temples and at the very front of his hairline.\n\nBecause it takes up to a year for the transplanted hair to grow back fully, viewers won't notice any difference in character David Platt's appearance.\n\nHe added: 'I remember seeing myself on screen and thinking: 'Oh my God, it is really falling out''\n\nJack revealed he has been losing his hair for the last decade but felt it had only become noticeable in the last decade.\n\nHe said: 'I could see the difference when I watched myself on screen and when I was travelling in a lift and the mirror would highlight my hair loss.\n\n'A few of the make-up girls at Corrie suggested that I should have it done and I have talked it through with a few people at work. 'My hair loss has definitely accelerated in the last year.\n\n'I have had a few personal issues off-screen which have been stressful and I am also an insomniac which just adds to my stress levels.\n\n'No one likes to lose their hair and hopefully I can make really difference to my appearance because I am losing it right at the front where you notice it the most.'\n\nProcedure: Follicles were removed individually from the back of his scalp and then replanted by Dr Shahmalak in the balding areas around his temples and at the very front of his hairline\n\nOn screen: Because it takes up to a year for the transplanted hair to grow back fully, viewers won't notice any difference in character David Platt's appearance\n\nHaving worked as an actor since childhood, Jack reckons his hectic career may also have aged him prematurely.\n\nHe said: 'I have been working around adults since I was ten. So I have always felt really old - like I was about 80! I would not say that I was vain, but I just want to be able to do what I want with my hair.'\n\nJack was swayed to go to Dr Shahmalak after seeing his work on other male clients.\n\nHe said: 'A hair transplant is just about the only cosmetic procedure us blokes can have. It is the modern day version of the boob job.\n\n'People would raise a few eyebrows if a woman had a boob job 20 years ago, but now it is just seen as perfectly normal. It is the same with hair transplants for men.\n\nLoss: Jack revealed he has been losing his hair for the last decade but felt it had only become noticeable in the last decade\n\n'I decided if I was going to have it done I would go to one of the world's best surgeons. You want your hair to look right and for the transplant to be completely natural.\n\n'Dr Shahmalak was recommended to me and, so far, I have been delighted with the results.\n\n'I cannot wait to see what it looks like when the transplanted hair is fully grown back in a year's time.'\n\nDr Shahmalak said that he treated a lot a famous men who feel under pressure to look younger, claiming that since Wayne Rooney had a hair transplant, bookings have gone up by 25 percent.\n\nLast month, Jack gave an update on his transplant and admitted that he considered giving up acting after his hair loss had an impact on his mental health.\n\nIn a tweet, he wrote: 'He wrote: '9 months it\u2019s been since my hair transplant, I decided to get one as my hair was falling out and it was affecting my mental health to the point where I considered giving up acting and not being in the public eye. Thank you @drasimshahmalak @CrownClinicUK for everything.'\n\nHe said: 'A hair transplant is just about the only cosmetic procedure us blokes can have. It is the modern day version of the boob job'\n\nJack added: 'People would raise a few eyebrows if a woman had a boob job 20 years ago, but now it is just seen as perfectly normal.
