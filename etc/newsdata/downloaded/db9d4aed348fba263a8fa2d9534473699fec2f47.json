Philip Morris (ticker: PM) is up more than 18% in 2019, just trailing the broader market. The company\u2019s previous earnings report came in better than expected, with management telling Barron\u2019s that it was strategically moving toward a tobacco-free future and touting the success of its heat- not-burn iQOS device.\n\nAnalysts have been quick to praise the company\u2019s strategy, and while regulations are always a concern with tobacco stocks, many argue that Philip Morris is actually in a good position to weather changes.\n\nShare Your Market Predictions Barron\u2019s wants to know your thoughts on the market, the economy, and the political landscape.

Those talks were soon confirmed, and while some analysts pointed to synergies, the shareholders never got on board.\n\nBoth Philip Morris and Altria saw their stocks gain when the negotiations ended, as many saw the two better off as separate, with Philip Morris benefiting from strong international markets. Others think that iQOS will be key, especially as some consumers may see it as a safer alternative to vaping, which has been linked to potential health risks.\n\nWhat\u2019s new. Early Thursday, Philip Morris delivered better-than-expected third-quarter results, but the shares fell after the company provided muted fourth-quarter guidance on the conference call.\n\nLooking ahead. CFO Martin King spoke with Barron\u2019s following the report, and he says that while there are some timing issues affecting the fourth-quarter outlook, he urged investors to focus on the year as a whole: Excluding China and the U.S., industry volumes were down 2.5%, at the lower end of 2.5% to 3% estimates, and within that Philip Morris is seeing smaller declines, indicating a pickup in market share.\n\nEditor's Choice\n\nKing also touted the company\u2019s pricing power, as well as expanding margins\u2014despite its investments in R&D\u2014which he attributes to good cost controls. \u201cYou can see a very good underlying business and a very good year, and the fact that the fourth quarter has some distortions in timing doesn\u2019t take away from that,\u201d he said.\n\nThe company\u2019s heated-tobacco products were a highlight in the quarter, and King says that Philip Morris is well on its way to hitting its unit-shipment volume target of 90 to 100 billion by 2021, thanks to ongoing strength in key markets like Russia, Japan, and Europe. He also says that iQOS\u2019s launch in the U.S. (being spearheaded by Altria) is off to a good start, and that Philip Morris is \u201chappy with the relationship\u201d and believes Altria is \u201cfully focused on maximizing the opportunity iQOS represents in the U.S.\u201d\n\nKing argues that recent negative headlines about vaping make iQOS all the more attractive. \u201cIf you\u2019re an adult smoker considering alternatives, iQOS has to be near the top of your list,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s delivering the goods in terms of scientific substantiation, it\u2019s regulated properly through the Food and Drug Administration, consistent with protection of public health, and it\u2019s coming from a reputable manufacturer.\u201d\n\nPhilip Morris is down 0.2%, at $78.91, in recent trading. The S&P 500 is up 0.3%.\n\nWrite to Teresa Rivas at teresa.rivas@barrons.com", "description": "The tobacco giant\u2019s chief financial officer tells Barron\u2019s that the company is taking market share and seeing success with its reduced-risk products.", "authors": ["Teresa Rivas"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-113738/social", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
