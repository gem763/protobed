Lo and Chrissy Teigen since the year 2000, and although the rest of the guests attempt to steal Heidi\u2019s thunder, she always wins best dressed.\n\nPrevious years have seen the supermodel dress up as Princess Fiona from Shrek, a scarily convincing old lady, and even a sultry IRL version of Jessica Rabbit. But that time in 2011 when she dressed up as that creepy human body figure in your high school science classroom definitely takes the cake.\n\nSo what the fuck is she wearing this year?\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first teaser we\u2019ve seen from her either, with the former Project Runway host sharing another Halloween prep video back on August 22nd, proving that whatever this costume is, it has taken some serious prep work.\n\nAll we know so far is that the costume has taken months to prep and will take a whopping 10 hours to prepare. The videos she\u2019s posted haven\u2019t really given anything away, but fans are already tweeting their excitement for her annual costume reveal. All hail Heidi Klum, the queen of the \u2018ween.\n\nCan\u2019t stop thinking about what Heidi Klum is gonna be for Halloween this year \u2014 mol (@mollyerin_) October 17, 2019\n\nPetition to rename Halloween \u201cNational Heidi Klum Day\u201d \u2014 julien (*\u02c9\ufe36\u02c9*) (@JulienRouleau1) October 16, 2019\n\nAnyone else thinking about who or what @heidiklum will be for Halloween this year? ???????? \u2014 leonipepperoni\u264e\ufe0f (@leonihunt) October 16, 2019", "description": "Supermodel and reality TV personality Heidi Klum has revealed a sneak peek of her highly anticipated Halloween costume on Instagram.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/pjimage-55.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
