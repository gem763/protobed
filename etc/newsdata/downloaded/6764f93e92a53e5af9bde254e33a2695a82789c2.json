The Syrian army has advanced into parts of the area, and Russia deployed its troops in some areas to act as a buffer force.\n\nRussia has powerful sway with all the multiple parties vying for the border. Turkey has suggested it wants Russia to persuade the Syrian government to cede it control over a major chunk of territory in the northeast.\n\nThe Kurds are hoping Russia can keep Turkey out and help preserve some of the autonomy they carved out for themselves during Syria's civil war.\n\nSyrian President Bashar Assad has vowed to reunite all the territory under Damascus' rule. On Tuesday, Assad called Erdogan 'a thief' and said he was ready to support any 'popular resistance' against Turkey's invasion.\n\nErdogan wants to create a 20-mile wide 'safe zone' along Turkey's southern border, while Putin is trying to improve the territorial integrity of Syria after allying with the regime\n\n'We are in the middle of a battle and the right thing to do is to rally efforts to lessen the damages from the invasion and to expel the invader sooner or later,' he told troops during a visit to the northwestern province of Idlib.\n\nThe immediate question was the fate of the U.S.-brokered cease-fire, which was to run out at 10 p.m. (1900 GMT) Tuesday evening.\n\nErdogan said 1,300 Syrian Kurdish fighters had yet to vacate a stretch of the border as required under the deal. He said 800 fighters had left so far. The Kurdish-led force has said it will carry out the pullout.\n\nIf it doesn't, Erdogan warned Tuesday, 'our offensive will continue from where it left off, with a much greater determination.'\n\n'There is no place for the (Kurdish fighters) in Syria's future. We hope that with Russia's cooperation, we will rid the region of separatist terror,' he said.\n\nUnder the accord, the Kurdish fighters are to vacate a stretch of territory roughly 120 kilometers (75 miles) wide and 30 kilometers (20 miles) deep between the Syrian border towns of Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ayn.\n\nBut that leaves the situation in the rest of the northeastern border unclear.\n\nCurrently, other than the few places where Syrian troops have deployed, they are solely in the hands of the Kurdish-led fighters - a situation Ankara has repeatedly said it cannot tolerate.\n\nTurkey considers the fighters terrorists, because of their links to Kurdish insurgents inside Turkey.\n\nBashar al-Assad was out visiting Syrian troops on the front line Tuesday as he described Erdogan as a 'thief' and vowed to unite all Syrian territory under his rule\n\nAssad visited government troops in al-Habit, in Idlib province, hours before a ceasefire between Turkey and the Kurds - who are fighting in the north of the country - was due to expire\n\nThe Syrian government has entered into a defence agreement with the Kurds to protect them from Turkish troops in return for territory\n\nTurkey wants to control a 'safe zone' extending more than 400 kilometers (250 miles) along the border, from the Euphrates River to the Iraqi border. There, it plans to resettle about 2 million of the roughly 3.6 million Syrian refugees currently living in Turkey.\n\nRussia sent a new signal to Turkey about the need to negotiate directly with Assad. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov emphasized that only Damascus could authorize the Turkish troop presence on the Syrian territory.\n\nAssad gave a symbolic show of Damascus' goal of regaining the border, visiting troops in northwestern Idlib province, where his forces are battling rebels.\n\nIdlib is adjacent to an enclave along the border that Turkey captured several years ago in another incursion.\n\nTurkey also has observation points inside Idlib, negotiated with Russia, to monitor a cease-fire there between the government and opposition fighters and jihadi groups.\n\nAssad called Erdogan 'a thief, he stole the factories and the wheat and the oil in cooperation with Daesh (the Islamic State group) and now is stealing the land.'\n\nHe said his government had offered a clemency to Kurdish fighters - whom it considers separatists - to 'ensure that everyone is ready to resist the aggression' and fight the Turkish assault.\n\nSyrian state media reported Tuesday that government forces entered new areas in Hassakeh province at the far eastern end of the border, under the arrangement with the Kurds.\n\nTurkey's incursion into Syria has led to an international outcry, which has in turn enraged Erdogan, who has accused his NATO allies of not standing by Turkey.\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk on Tuesday condemned the incursion and called on Turkey - which is a candidate for EU membership - to pull out troops.\n\nAssad said that his forces allied with the Kurds were ready to repel the Turkish invasion, if Erdogan restarts his attacks\n\nAssad reviews battle plans with his generals in Syria, who agreed to step in and help the Kurds defend themselves against Turkey\n\nTurkey invaded Syria, sparking the deal between Assad (pictured) and the Kurds after Donald Trump agreed to withdraw American troops\n\n'No one is fooled by the so-called cease-fire,' Tusk told EU lawmakers. Any course other than a Turkish withdrawal 'means unacceptable suffering, a victory for Daesh (the Islamic State group), and a serious threat to European security,' he said.\n\nGerman Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer proposed the establishment of an internationally controlled security zone in Syria, 'with the inclusion of Turkey and Russia.'\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. troops pulling out of Syria were heading to neighboring Iraq, but Iraq's military said Tuesday the troops did not have permission to stay in the country.\n\nThe Iraqi military in a statement said the American troops currently withdrawing from Syria have acquired permission from the Iraqi Kurdish regional government to enter Iraq to later be transferred out of the country. It added that these troops do not have any approval to stay in Iraq.\n\nThe statement appears to contradict U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper who has said that under the current plan, all U.S. troops leaving Syria will go to western Iraq and the military will continue to conduct operations against the Islamic State group to prevent its resurgence.\n\nEsper said he has spoken to his Iraqi counterpart about the plan to shift the more than 700 troops leaving Syria into western Iraq.", "description": "The presidents of Turkey and Russia met in Sochi on Tuesday to talk about security in the Middle East, before a ceasefire between President Erdogan's troops and the Kurds was due to end.", "authors": ["Chris Pleasance For Mailonline", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/15/20039774-0-image-a-188_1571754763564.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
