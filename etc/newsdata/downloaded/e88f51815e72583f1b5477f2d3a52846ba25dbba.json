But one rises sharply from the rest: Hua\u2019ao Island. This 66 million-year-old island is home to the region\u2019s last remaining salt flats, and area farmers have been harvesting sea salt here for at least 1,300 years. These salt flats, or seawater evaporation pools, are not mere historical relics, though: China is currently one of the largest sea salt producers in the world, exporting about 66 million tonnes a year.\n\nAfter the island\u2019s farmers pump seawater into ponds, the water begins to evaporate. Farmers then remove sediments and drain the rest of the water, leaving a fine layer of sea salt that is then filtered, cleaned and shipped. Just 40 of the island\u2019s 1,000 residents harvest salt, with the majority of locals employed in the island\u2019s growing tourism industry, which centres on the Hua\u2019ao Stone Forest: an area of sea-sculpted volcanic rock formations that cover the islet\u2019s craggy shores.\n\n(Video by Runze Yu, text by Emily Cavanagh)\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"The Essential List\".
