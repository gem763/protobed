This piece has been updated to reflect the latest news.\n\n(CNN) The President of the United States has a massive platform. He holds the most powerful office in the world. With just a few words, a president can launch a war, move markets, inspire millions, and quite literally change the course of world history.\n\nJill Filipovic\n\nSo, of course, Donald Trump is using that privilege to attack a celebrity he thinks doesn't love him enough.\n\nApparently seething about an MSNBC town hall on criminal justice, where participants issued what he deemed insufficient praise for a piece of criminal justice legislation Trump signed, the President tweeted, \"I SIGNED IT INTO LAW, no one else did, & Republicans deserve much credit. But now that it is passed, people that had virtually nothing to do with it are taking the praise.\" And then: \"Guys like boring musician @johnlegend, and his filthy mouthed wife, are talking now about how great it is - but I didn't see them around when we needed help getting it passed.\"\n\nThat \"filthy mouthed wife\" is Chrissy Teigen, a model, author, and Twitter personality in her own right. Teigen leaned into the characterization , tweeting a (to my mind) delightfully filthy response that even worked in one particularly lewd word for female genitalia that the President had previously been caught on tape claiming to grab (Trump: \"I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab them by the p****. You can do anything.\" Teigen: \"lol what a p**** a** b****. tagged everyone but me. an honor, mister president.\")\n\nDonald Trump is a bad-insult machine, and he regularly targets men, too. But his objection to foul, filthy language is primarily directed at women. Chrissy Teigen is a \"filthy mouthed wife.\" Ilhan Omar is \"Foul Mouthed Omar.\" Elizabeth Warren \"has a nasty mouth.\" Congresswomen who criticized him should apologize for the \"foul language they have used, and the terrible things they have said. So many people are angry at them & their horrible & disgusting actions!\" (\"Disgusting,\" by the way, is a word he mainly reserves for women he disdains .)\n\nRead More", "description": "The model and author is unafraid to give as good as she gets in an unseemly Twitter spat conducted by a fame-thirsty President who, behind all the bluster and misogyny (not lost on women voters), is fundamentally seeking the approval from the many who have long rejected him, writes Jill Filipovic.", "authors": ["Opinion Jill Filipovic"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190909144347-chrissy-teigen-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
