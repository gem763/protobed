Strange.\"\n\nEric Goodwin, the school board president, said a one-time charitable donation would not help families address underlying problems, the Courier Post reports.\n\n\"Simply erasing the debt does not address the many families with financial means who have just chosen not to pay what is owed,\" he told the Inquirer.\n\nHow has this become a political issue?\n\nDemocratic presidential candidates have lambasted the policy and used it to bolster their campaigns.\n\n\"No child should go hungry at school - period,\" Cory Booker posted on Twitter. \"As president, I will fight for universal free school lunch and relieve all school lunch debt.\"\n\n\"'School lunch debt' is not a phrase that should exist,\" Bernie Sanders said.\n\nElizabeth Warren labelled the policy as \"cruel and punitive\".\n\n\"Every kid needs and deserves a nutritious meal in order to learn at school,\" she posted on Twitter.", "description": "A school district in the US city rejects a businessman's offer to pay off pupils' debts.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/150B1/production/_109339168_schoollunch.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
