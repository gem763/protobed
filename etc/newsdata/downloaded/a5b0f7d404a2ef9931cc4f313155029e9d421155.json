Cabinet ministers believe Mr Johnson must at least go down fighting, or the Tories could be eaten alive by Nigel Farage's Brexit Party at the looming election.\n\nBoris Johnson has warned French President Emmanuel Macron (pictured right together in August) that the EU should not assume there will be a Brexit extension at Halloween\n\nThere are claims the premier could take a case to the Supreme Court (president Baroness Hale pictured centre in London last week) in a bid to avoid obeying what he has dubbed the 'Surrender Act'\n\nWith time running out to secure an agreement ahead of next week's EU Council, the Prime Minister used a phone call with Mr Macron yesterday to insist: 'We have to push forward.'\n\nHe said the EU should not be lured into the mistaken belief that the UK extend the Halloween deadline, saying the bloc must now 'match the compromises' the UK has made.\n\nBut Instead of signing up to intensive talks on the UK plan, EU leaders have set Mr Johnson a fresh deadline of Friday to make further compromises.\n\nMr Macron told the PM that the bloc would 'evaluate at the end of the week whether a deal is possible that respects European Union principles'.\n\nOpposition MPs believe they have Mr Johnson trapped and the Benn Act - demanding he seeks an extension on October 19 to avoid No Deal - is watertight.\n\nHowever, there is speculation the PM will launch a challenge in the Supreme Court in an effort to avoid having to write to the EU.\n\nMr Johnson could even give evidence in court to persuade judges against forcing him to ask for a Brexit delay, according to the Daily Telegraph.\n\nIn the phone call with Mr Macron, Mr Johnson told the French leader that the EU should not be lured into the mistaken belief that the UK will stay in the EU after October 31 and urged the EU to 'match the compromises' the UK has made.\n\nAnd a senior No 10 source said: 'The Surrender Act and its authors are undermining negotiations, but if EU leaders are betting that it will prevent No Deal, that would be an historic misunderstanding.'\n\nYesterday, Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay went to the Netherlands for talks and is expected in other EU capitals today and tomorrow.\n\nMr Johnson's EU 'sherpa' David Frost will return to Brussels this morning and the PM is expected to continue telephone diplomacy.\n\nBrexit Secretary Steve Barclay (pictured with host Andrew Marr facing away) went for talks in the Netherlands and is expected at other EU capitals today\n\nBut there was precious little sign of the momentum needed to get a deal done in time. On Saturday, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier demanded 'different proposals' from the UK saying that otherwise talks could not 'advance'.\n\nToday, a Scottish court is expected to rule in a case brought by Remain campaigners which seeks to force Mr Johnson to show his hand on extension.\n\nIf they win, it could mean any attempt to avoid asking for a delay would leave Mr Johnson facing contempt of court proceedings.\n\nJudges could also bar him from sending a second letter or asking EU leaders to ignore his formal request for an extension.\n\nIn Westminster, Jeremy Corbyn will meet the leaders of other opposition parties to scrutinise the Government's new Brexit proposals and decide the next steps to \"hold the Government to account\".\n\nThe Labour leader will hold talks with the SNP's Ian Blackford, Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson and the Greens' Caroline Lucas - as well as Anna Soubry of the Independent Group for Change and Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts - on Monday afternoon.\n\nParliament will sit for two days this week and then is expected to prorogue before a Queen's Speech next Monday.\n\nBrussels officials have all but killed off the idea of getting a deal based on Mr Johnson's proposal done by next week's EU summit or by October 31.\n\nThey are expected to make an 11th hour offer of a time-limited Northern Ireland-only backstop that would keep it inside the customs union.\n\nHowever, No 10 has insisted this is a red line for Mr Johnson as it would treat parts of the UK differently.", "description": "Boris Johnson will hit the phones to other European leaders today as he steps up the scramble to get a deal before a crunch summit on October 17.", "authors": ["James Tapsfield", "Political Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/09/19384728-0-image-a-18_1570435291380.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
