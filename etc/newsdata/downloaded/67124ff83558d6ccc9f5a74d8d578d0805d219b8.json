It was rescheduled \"following the completion of a joint NASA/Northrop Grumman investigation into a Pegasus sensor reading that was not within normal limits during previous ferry and launch attempt flights. The cause of the issue is understood, and the flight hardware has been modified to address the issue,\" according to NASA\n\n\"After years of work, I'm excited to get into orbit and turn on the spacecraft, open the doors on all our instruments,\" said Thomas Immel, ICON principal investigator at the University of California, Berkeley. \"ICON carries incredible capacity for science. I'm looking forward to surprising results and finally seeing the world through its eyes.\"\n\nICON, or the Ionospheric Connection Explorer, will capture a closer view from within the upper atmosphere itself, 350 miles above Earth. ICON can also directly measure particles and how they move. It will operate amid bright bands of color known as airglow.\n\nRead More", "description": "NASA's ICON mission to explore where Earth's weather meets space weather is expected to launch Thursday evening at 9:30 p.m. ET from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180104151739-01-nasa-gold-mission-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
