Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had forecast a small improvement of 0.2% growth.\n\nShares in auto-parts maker Continental AG were among the biggest declines on Monday, falling 2.2%. The company last month confirmed it would close production plants in several countries. Its competitor, Michelin, also said in September it would shut a factory in Germany.\n\nThe U.S.-China trade row has weighed on Germany's manufacturing and export-heavy economy throughout the year. But the latest figures also showed that domestic demand had weakened, falling 2.6%, while international orders climbed slightly, by 0.9%.\n\nYields on German 10-year bunds ticked lower to -0.600%. Yields on bonds fall as prices rise.\n\nMeanwhile, a snapshot of European investor sentiment from research firm Sentix slipped in October, falling deeper into negative territory from the month before.\n\n\"Investor confidence in the eurozone is still in near free-fall, and last month's tepid rebound is increasingly looking like a dead-cat bounce,\" said Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, in a note.\n\nU.S. economic data have recently suggested that weakness in factories may be spreading to other parts of the economy. Last week the ISM manufacturing index slipped to its lowest reading since 2009, while the services sector dropped to a score of 52.6 in September, its worst reading since August 2016.\n\nAny expectations for a broad trade deal between China and the U.S. had been misguided, said Geoffrey Yu, head of the U.K. investment office at the wealth management arm of UBS.\n\n\"I'm surprised expectations were that high in the first place. It was clear that China wanted to separate the tech side of things out and focus on the tariff side of things alone,\" Mr. Yu said.\n\nMarkets have had their hopes pared back, and as a result, even a partial deal might be enough \"to help keep things on track,\" he said. Investors would be watching the attitude of the U.S. consumer, and the agricultural sector in particular, for a positive response to any reduction in trade hostilities, Mr. Yu said.\n\nIn Asia, Japan's Nikkei slipped 0.2%, while Korea's Kospi edged up 0.1%. Markets in Hong Kong and mainland China remained shut for a national holiday\n\nChinese Vice Premier Liu He is expected to resume discussions with U.S. counterparts later this week.\n\nLee Hardman, currency analyst at MUFG, said there had been a number of reports that China may not be as willing to compromise as much as the Trump administration hopes.\n\n\"The U.S. would like a trade deal with China, a wide-ranging deal, but those demands look like they're unlikely to be accepted by China. Things like intellectual property rights and other structural issues like state subsidies look unlikely to be resolved,\" he said. \"China may buy more agricultural goods but it's unclear whether or not that partial agreement will be a big enough win for the U.S.\"\n\nThe Chinese offshore yuan was down 0.3% against the dollar, a move some analysts said reflected worsening prospects of a breakthrough in trade relations with the U.S. The offshore yuan could reach a new low if there isn't resolution in trade talks by the end of the year, according to MUFG analysts.\n\nIn commodities, global oil benchmark Brent crude edged up 0.3%, and haven asset gold slipped 0.3%.\n\nThe head of the Kansas City Federal Reserve, Esther George, said Sunday that she would support a further cut in interest rates if economic data weakened, but that the economy was \"in a good place\" at the moment.\n\nThe yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury rose to 1.524% on Monday, from 1.515% on Friday.\n\nThe WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the currency against a basket of its peers, inched up 0.1%.\n\nWrite to Anna Isaac at anna.isaac@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 07, 2019 06:59 ET (10:59 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
