S&P 500 e-minis <EScv1> were up 1.75 points, or 0.06% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis <NQcv1> were up 15.25 points, or 0.19%.\n\nApple <AAPL.O> edged 0.3% higher in premarket trading after U.S. trade regulators approved 10 out of 15 requests for tariff exemptions filed by the iPhone maker amid a broader reprieve on levies on computer parts.\n\nApple supplier Micron <MU.O>, which manufactures computer memory drives, rose nearly 0.5%.\n\nBoeing <.BA.N> dropped 0.7% after a Reuters report that European antitrust regulators were set to investigate the plane maker's $4.75 billion bid for the commercial aircraft arm of Brazil-based Embraer SA <EMBR3.SA>.\n\nAdditionally, the chief of the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration is set to detail progress on the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft to international air regulators, who are divided about returning the grounded jet to flight after two fatal crashes.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Medha Singh in Bengaluru)", "description": "The indexes recorded their worst session in about two weeks on Friday - ending a three-week run of gains - after a Chinese agriculture delegation canceled a visit to Montana, dampening optimism about the trade talks.
