He has gone to Loter\u00eda game nights put on by LULAC and was the only top-tier candidate who appeared at the group\u2019s forum. He's also held \u201cUnidos Con Bernie\u201d aimed at the Latino community.\n\nBeyond the first-in-the-nation caucus state, Sanders\u2019 team thinks Latinos are critical to his pathway to the nomination in Western states he hopes to dominate. In 2016, Sanders performed better with Nevada Latinos than expected, resulting in a narrow loss to Hillary Clinton in the state. In California, however, he appeared to underperform with Latino voters as Clinton beat him in some of the state\u2019s most heavily Latino counties and won the state 53-46. At the same time, a Political Data survey of voters who cast their ballots by mail in California's primary showed Sanders and Clinton were tied at 50 percent among Latinos.\n\nFast forward to the current race: Sanders is tied for first place with Biden in Nevada at 22 percent, according to the latest CNN poll. And even as he\u2019s slipped to third and fourth place in Iowa in some surveys, Sanders is in a three-way tie for California with Biden and Elizabeth Warren, per an October Public Policy Institute of California survey.\n\n\u201cI have been running campaigns for 30 years and the Latino vote program has always been the last thought, if not an afterthought,\u201d said Chuck Rocha, a senior adviser to Sanders. \u201cBut with Bernie\u2019s campaign, it\u2019s one of our first priorities.\u201d\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. | Kena Betancur/Getty Images\n\nSanders\u2019 aides are hopeful that Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s endorsement will energize Latino voters not just in Iowa \u2014 where Ocasio-Cortez is expected to stump with Sanders soon \u2014 but in California, Nevada and other states with sizable Latino populations.\n\n\u201cWe're going to utilize her as much as we possibly can,\u201d Sanders said of Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nIn the past week, Sanders has launched two digital ads in Iowa featuring the freshman congresswoman from the Bronx. Ocasio-Cortez \"really visually draws the picture that we\u2019re trying to draw,\" said Sanders' campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, \"that we want a multiracial working-class movement to defeat Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nSeveral surveys have shown Sanders and Biden as the top choices among Latinos. In a Univision survey of Latino primary voters released in September, Sanders and Biden were statistically tied with 20 percent and 22 percent, respectively. Sanders, who has vowed to put a moratorium on deportations, was the No. 1 choice in that survey among Latino Democrats who know someone who is an undocumented immigrant.\n\nAnd last week\u2019s Morning Consult poll had Sanders leading among Latinos nationally at 29 percent, followed by Biden at 24 percent and Warren at 16 percent.\n\nTo win, Sanders needs to persuade Latinos who rarely or never vote to come out for him, too.\n\nIt\u2019s a tall order: In past presidential elections, Democrats have tried but failed to boost turnout among Latinos. Latino voters were touted as a sleeping giant in the lead-up to the 2016 election. But just 47.6 percent of the Latino electorate came to the polls that year, compared to 48 percent in 2012, according to Pew. Turnout overall was just over 61 percent.\n\nBut next year might be different for Latinos, or so Sanders\u2019 campaign hopes. Latino voter turnout jumped from 27 percent in the 2014 midterms to 40 percent in 2018 \u2014 increasing more than any other ethnic group, according to U.S. Census data.\n\nIn 2016, Sanders lost the nomination largely because he was unable to win over middle-aged and older voters of color. Of the 11 primary states with the largest Latino populations in 2016, Sanders won one, Colorado, according to an analysis by Univision. His senior staff was criticized as being overwhelmingly white and male.\n\nHis 2020 campaign has a diverse group of aides, including at the top of his team. Instead of focusing almost exclusively on voters in the majority-white early states of Iowa and New Hampshire like he did at the start of his first bid for the White House, he also planted a flag in Nevada and South Carolina, where black voters cast a majority of Democratic primary ballots, early this time.\n\nEven Sanders\u2019 aides acknowledge that significantly boosting Latino turnout will be difficult. But Misty Rebik, Sanders\u2019 Iowa state director, underscored the importance of increasing Latino turnout to the campaign in a memo to top allies and surrogates last week.\n\n\u201cFor far too long, Democrats have ignored Latinx people, and we are preparing to engage with the Latinx community like no other presidential campaign ever has in Iowa,\u201d she said in the message. There's an enormous untapped potential in the community, Rebik added: Of 85,000 Latinos eligible to participate in the 2016 caucuses, only 1,500 to 3,000 turned out.\n\n\"We look forward to fundamentally transforming the Iowa electorate,\" she wrote.\n\nSanders\u2019 team said its Latino outreach program features TV, radio, digital, mail, phone and texting. In one recent example, Sanders\u2019 army of volunteers has begun texting a Spanish-language digital ad about Sanders\u2019 immigrant background to potential Latino supporters.\n\nThe fact that Sanders is the son of an immigrant is one reason his aides believe he can resonate with Latino voters. They also think his Medicare for All, $15 minimum wage, student loan forgiveness and pro-union proposals are a draw.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

That\u2019s my grandfather\u2019s story,\u201d said Rocha. \u201cThat\u2019s the story of Latinos across Nevada and the entire country.\u201d\n\nSanders' campaign boasts more than 70 Latino staffers, including top aides such as Rocha and national political director Analilia Mejia. His team said three of his employees who are recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, are helping write his immigration policy, which, Sanders said, would be released \u201csoon.\u201d\n\nOf the first four early states, Sanders has recently been polling the strongest in Nevada and New Hampshire. But Latino activist Leo Murrieta says he's hearing young Latinos in Nevada increasingly talk about Elizabeth Warren and Juli\u00e1n Castro.\n\n\u201cSanders still has a base of Latino supporters,\u201d said Murrieta, Nevada director for Make the Road Action, which organizes immigrant and minority communities politically. \u201cBut I've seen more and more in the last couple of months, other people really taking up that [progressive] space.\u201d\n\nBut Sanders is confident that his support within the Latino community is strong and based on the substance of his agenda and his family story.\n\n\u201cThe issues that we are talking about appeal to the Latino community and young people in general, and that is a lot of Latinos are working for starvation wages \u2014 they want to see that minimum wage raised,\u201d said Sanders. \u201cI'm the son of an immigrant myself, my father came from Poland without any money. I think I know a little bit about the experience.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["-", "Democratic Presidential Candidate Bernie Sanders"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/1d/f1/ea963a5149aa987258e78c9e3b2e/191029-bernie-sanders-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
