It has opposed options dubbed no Brexit, hard Brexit and soft Brexit, and voted against staging a second referendum on whether to stay in the European Union or leave it. The only thing the lawmakers have agreed upon is that Britain will not leave the E.U. at the end of October without a proper withdrawal agreement \u2014 which is exactly what Johnson threatens to do.\n\nEarlier this month, a so-called rebel alliance of politicians hastily passed legislation that requires Johnson to ask the E.U. on Oct. 19 for a three-month delay in implementing Brexit, if the two sides have not struck a deal.\n\nJohnson has vowed he will not seek a delay and repeatedly has promised that Britain will leave the European Union \u2014 deal or no deal, \u201cdo or die\u201d \u2014 on Oct. 31.\n\nThe numbers in Parliament do not suggest a way forward. Johnson\u2019s Conservative Party government has lost its paper-thin majority and is running on fumes.\n\nJeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party, told BBC Radio that Johnson should apologize to the British public and to the queen, whose advice he sought in shuttering Parliament.\n\nBut Corbyn added that he would not call for a vote of no confidence \u2014 which could lead to the government\u2019s downfall \u2014 until it is \u201cvery clear\u201d that Britain will not careen out of the European Union at the end of October with no deal.\n\nIn New York City, Johnson addressed a mostly empty hall at the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday night, giving a speech on the lurking dangers of all-seeing, all-knowing technology, artificial intelligence and the prospect of deadly \u201cpink-eyed terminators.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat will synthetic biology stand for \u2014 restoring our livers and our eyes with miracle regeneration of the tissues, like some fantastic hangover cure?\u201d Johnson asked at the United Nations. \u201cOr will it bring terrifying limbless chickens to our tables?\u201d\n\nNobody was quite sure what to make of that.\n\nHow Johnson slept on the rushed night flight home went unreported.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s proven time and again he can\u2019t be trusted,\u201d said Jo Swinson, leader of the ascendant Liberal Democrats, who have staked out a firm anti-Brexit stance.\n\nSwinson said politicians \u201csimply cannot afford to wait until the 19th of October to see whether or not the prime minister will refuse to obey the law again.\u201d She suggested that opposition politicians would try to find new ways to prevent a no-deal Brexit.\n\nIn a scathing editorial, the Financial Times, said it was \u201crefreshing that judges saw through Downing Street\u2019s skulduggery.\u201d The establishment newspaper called on Johnson to step down.\n\n\u201cFaced with such a damning judgment, any premier with a shred of respect for British democracy and the responsibilities of his office would resign,\u201d the editorial said.\n\nDespite his devastating defeat at the Supreme Court, however, there were no signs that Johnson was considering such a step.\n\n\u201cAnybody other than Johnson would surely resign immediately, but Johnson is not like any other prime minister in my lifetime,\u201d said Iain McLean, a senior research fellow at Oxford University.\n\nJohnson is not going anywhere, his aides say. Except Parliament, where he may appear Wednesday afternoon.\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "But, no surprise, British lawmakers remain gridlocked over Brexit.", "authors": ["William Booth", "London Bureau Chief", "Karla Adam", "London Correspondent Covering The United Kingdom"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/6abV07JEbJP76o8RFRYXd1DBU2g=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FABTT7G7SII6TMMZ6Y4L6LBUB4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
