Now, it\u2019s ready to grow up \u2014 and beyond these three cities \u2014 with a fresh injection of $27.6 million in capital raised in a Series A round led by Ibex Investors.\n\nThe equity round included newcomer Toyota AI Ventures and further investments from Blue Collective, Launch Capital and Maniv Mobility.\n\nThe capital will, as it often does with startups, allow Revel to scale up. CEO and co-founder Frank Reig said this growth will extend to its fleet of scooters within the cities it currently operates as well as expand into new markets. Reig wouldn\u2019t name where the New York-based startup will launch next, although he provided some hints. Large U.S. cities with the right population density and more temperate weather are at the top of the list.\n\nRevel is targeting about 10 cities by mid-2020, Reig added.\n\nHow that growth occurs, and who is behind its operations, is what Reig believes differentiates Revel from other shared electric vehicle providers such as scooter startups that have had a record of deploying in cities before getting approval from local authorities.\n\nMany startups in the shared industry, including Revel, talk up their focus on safety and desire to be responsible partners with cities. Revel\u2019s choice of vehicle \u2014 along with a few other decisions \u2014 helps it stick to those promises.\n\n\u201cThese mopeds are motor vehicles,\u201d Reig noted. \u201cThis means there\u2019s no regulatory gray area: you have to have a license plate. To get that license plate you have register each vehicle with the Department of Motor Vehicles in each state and show third-party auto liability insurance. And then because it\u2019s a motor vehicle, it\u2019s clear that it rides in the street, so we\u2019re completely off sidewalks.\u201d\n\nRevel caps the speed of its mopeds to 30 miles per hour. The company also provides two helmets \u2014 and single-use liners \u2014 on every ride and requires users to be licensed drivers aged, 21 or older who pass an initial safe driving history check. About one out of every 12 applicants does not make it past this screening, according to Revel.\n\nAny concerns about users bypassing the protective headgear are largely erased because both New York and Washington D.C. have helmet laws, Reig said.\n\nNo giga workers\n\nThe company, unlike most on-demand mobility startups, does not have any gig economy workers either. Revel only has full-time employees, said Reig, adding that it\u2019s decision he intends to stick with it even as his company grows.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t use gig economy in anything we do and I see a ton of value in that,\u201d Reig said. \u201cWe need a well-trained workforce that is really committed and cares about the vehicles, because if not it\u2019s something we\u2019re going to be throwing out every 60 days.\u201d\n\nRevel\u2019s shared mopeds have a 3-year asset life, Reig said based on their in-house estimates. To ensure the mopeds last, which has become a key factor in the unit economics of shared mobility businesses, they remain on street.\n\nThe mopeds are removed by employees for routine maintenance that occurs every four to six months. Otherwise, the mopeds aren\u2019t loaded into vans by gig economy workers who make money by charging them up \u2014 a common practice with the small stand-up scooters that have inundated cities like San Diego and San Francisco. Instead, employees swap out the batteries on the mopeds, which have a range of about 50 miles.\n\n20 months and 1,400 scooters\n\nThe idea for Revel was borne out of Reig\u2019s travels to Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he witnessed locals on every form of two-wheeled vehicle.\n\n\u201cA sort of light bulb went off my head, and I asked myself, \u2018why is it not a thing in the U.S?,\u201d Reig told TechCrunch in a recent interview. \u201cI came back to New York, started studying the market more and saw all these electric moped operators had been popping up in Europe over the last few years and just realized that if I don\u2019t do it, somebody else will.\u201d\n\nThe company started with a small pilot of 68 mopeds in a few neighborhoods within Brooklyn. In May, after a nine-month pilot, Revel pulled the original mopeds it used in its limited pilot and has replaced them with 1,000 new models built for two riders and equipped with kickstands for parking. With more mopeds in its fleet, Revel expanded the service to more than 20 neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens. In August, Revel launched its service in Washington D.C., where there are now more than 400 mopeds.\n\nRevel rides cost $1 per person to start, followed by $0.25 per minute to ride and $0.10 per minute while parked. Revel says it will cut the cost by 40% for eligible riders \u2014 and give them a $25 credit \u2014 through its Revel Access program. Riders who use public assistance programs like SNAP or live in NYCHA housing are eligible for the program.", "description": "In less than two years, Revel has gone from an idea to a shared electric vehicle startup with more than 1,400 mopeds across Washington D.C., and Brooklyn and Queens, New York.
