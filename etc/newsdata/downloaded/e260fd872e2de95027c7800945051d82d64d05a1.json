That was up from 1.733% on Wednesday and a recent low of 1.456% on Sept. 4, marking the largest six-session increase since just after the U.S. presidential election in 2016.\n\nGovernment-bond yields on both sides of the Atlantic initially fell after the European Central Bank cut its key interest rate and committed to a period of monetary stimulus.\n\nSome investors and analysts said the recent upturn in yields, which rise when bond prices fall, can largely be attributed to profit-taking from traders who rode a furious bond rally throughout August. Yet some positive economic developments have contributed to the selling.\n\nThough a global manufacturing downturn remains a concern, investors have been encouraged by evidence of strength in other parts of the economy as well as tentative signs that inflation could be accelerating.\n\nThe European Central Bank cut its key interest rate and committed to a prolonged period of monetary stimulus.

Higher inflation weighs on bonds because inflation erodes the purchasing power of fixed returns.\n\nU.S. yields dropped earlier Thursday as the ECB said it would cut its key interest rate by 0.1 percentage point, to minus 0.5%, and start buying \u20ac20 billion ($22 billion) a month of eurozone debt. The asset-purchase program is expected to \u201crun for as long as necessary.\u201d\n\nDespite the recent selling, the yield on the 10-year note remains close to its all-time closing low of 1.366%, which is favorable for borrowers.\n\nThis week has shaped up to be busy for sales of new speculative-grade corporate bonds. As of Wednesday, some $11.8 billion of new speculative-grade corporate bonds was expected to be sold by the end of the week, the second-largest one-week total of 2019, according to LCD, a unit of S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nThat total was set to rise as Uber Technologies Inc. on Thursday was poised to sell $1.2 billion of new eight-year notes, marking its first bond sale since its May initial public offering.\n\nThe company was set to sell the bonds with a 7.5% yield after increasing the size of the offering from $750 million, an investor said.\n\nUber\u2019s existing 8% notes due in 2026, which were marketed and sold to a limited group of investors last year, recently traded at 104 cents on the dollar for a yield of 7.053%, according to MarketAxess. That was unchanged from Wednesday.\n\nWrite to Sam Goldfarb at sam.goldfarb@wsj.com", "description": "Longer-term U.S. government yields erase a drop triggered by the European Central Bank\u2019s commitment to prolonged monetary stimulus.", "authors": ["Sam Goldfarb", "Sam.Goldfarb Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106565/social", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
