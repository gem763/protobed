We bought the house ten years ago.\n\n\"From what we understand, this housing development has been in the works for at least 15 years.\n\n\"Since the works started, it has just been one thing after another and it's really dragging us down.\n\n\"We were initially on holiday when the works started and when we came back, we found that our bamboo fence had been ripped out from our boundary along with the plants that were situated along our property border.\n\n\"We were told that the entrance to the estate would be on Prebend Lane and that construction traffic should not be using Poachers Rest as an entrance to the estate because it wasn't suitable.\n\n\"This turned out to be a lie as a makeshift entrance was created at the end of Poachers Lane and since then we have suffered with heavy construction traffic.\n\n\"We have vans, lorries... one week we had a full-blown crane that got stuck.\"\n\nSandy describes how construction workers struggled to get down the narrow lane, and would regularly block her driveway.\n\nBut she says that when she asked them to move, she was faced with a torrent of abuse.\n\n(Image: Lincolnshire Live/BPM MEDIA)\n\n\"I work as a child-minder so mornings are busy for me as I have the school run,\" she said.\n\n\"One time I was blocked in my drive by a member of the utilities team. At this point we were so sick of the traffic and the nuisance, so I beeped my horn for him to move.\n\n\"Instead he yelled out of the window at me saying that he had 'a ***ing job to do'.\n\n\"Another time, one of the men had parked their car at the end of my driveway on a Saturday night and was playing his music so loudly that his speakers were straining.\n\n\"When I asked him to turn it down, he told me that he 'could play his music as loud as he *** liked' and then when I said to him that wasn't acceptable, he said to me 'what's the matter love, got nothing better to do?'\"\n\nAn official complaint has been made with West Lindsey District Council about the levels of noise and the lack of notification residents received before works began.\n\n\"One weekend they turned up and started drilling at 8am,\" Sandy said.\n\n(Image: Lincolnshire Live/BPM MEDIA)\n\n\"We have since been told that they shouldn't have started before 9am at the weekend.\n\n\"Then we've had issues with the dust. We left a pram outside for a day and when I came back to it, it was completely covered in dust and ruined. We can't leave any washing out or wash cars or windows because they'll just be covered.\n\n\"It's like they're gaining and we're losing out. I'm not trying to fight the building of homes - we know that needs to happen. I'm fighting the way it has been done and how we have been treated.\n\n\"I feel like I'm under scrutiny every time I leave my house. They make me feel like this middle class housewife who has nothing better to do. I\u2019m glad that I\u2019m a child-minder because it\u2019s working with the kids that pulls me through.\n\n\"All we wanted was for them to be courteous and communicate with us.\"\n\nThe utility company Power on Connections say works have now completed at the Poachers Rest end of the development and that they are investigating the allegations of abuse. They also concede that works should not have begun earlier than 9am at the weekend.\n\n\"We have been offered compensation from Beal Homes for the fence that was ripped out, which we do appreciate, but it all feels a little too late, to be honest,\" said Sandy.\n\nRick Reynolds said: \"There have been several complaints now put through to the council over this matter.\n\n\"It's been a living nightmare, to be honest. It\u2019s been absolute chaos - there was debris everywhere.\n\n\"Many of the residents on the estate have been very upset. One of our neighbours has been ill because of the works through stress and has suffered from migraines.\n\n\"Sandy has been very distraught.\"\n\n(Image: Lincolnshire Live/BPM MEDIA)\n\nFellow resident Paul Langley is also unhappy.\n\nHe said: \"The traffic we've had to endure over the last several weeks has been horrendous.\n\n\"The noise, the vibrations waking us up, the language from the fencers outside is not acceptable and not what your young child should be hearing.\n\n\"The number of times I've wondered whether one of the reversing trucks is going to hit our parked cars - or, heaven forbid, hit a child.\n\n\"We have not been consulted at all for the recent works being carried out and to start work on the weekend at 8.20am was beyond irresponsible and against current guidelines. Something needs to be done.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Power on Connections said they were carrying out 'essential reinforcement electricity works' in Bishops Green, Welton.\n\n\"We apologise for any disruption or inconvenience caused to local residents and the surrounding area, as we look to minimise this wherever possible,\" he said.\n\n(Image: Lincolnshire Live/BPM MEDIA)\n\n\"The work were completed yesterday and a thorough clean-up of the area is currently taking place.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Beal Homes said: \"We always strive to have an excellent relationship with local residents at all of our development sites and aim to minimise the impact of construction and related activities on the local community.\n\n\"We also engage strongly with schools, community groups and charities as part of our commitment to be a good neighbour and considerate developer.\n\n\"We have spoken to Mr Reynolds and explained that the works near his home are being carried out by contractors connecting utilities for the development and are essential and unavoidable. All of the works and the time-frames and working hours have been agreed with West Lindsey District Council.\n\n\"We have also agreed to replace a dilapidated garden fence as a gesture of goodwill for Mr Reynolds and a neighbour of his.\n\n\"We have explained to Mr Reynolds that access for construction traffic will be from Prebend Lane, which is a considerable distance from his property, so the current situation is temporary.\"", "description": "Villagers are furious with property developer Beal Homes who are building 350 homes at Bishops Green in Welton, Lincolnshire", "authors": ["Emily White", "Image", "Lincolnshire Live Bpm Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20551277.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_LIN_Bishops-Green-02-copy.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
