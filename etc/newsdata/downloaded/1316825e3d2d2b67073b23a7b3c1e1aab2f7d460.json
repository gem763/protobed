REUTERS/Luke Macgregor/Files\n\nThe pound held at five-month highs of $1.2874 against the dollar, down from Thursday\u2019s peak of $1.2988. It was little changed against the euro, at 86.28 pence.\n\nNews of the Brexit deal sent the pound soaring on Thursday. But sterling erased the gains before UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s next challenge: getting the deal approved in parliament, where he has no majority.\n\nThe Democratic Unionist Party, the Northern Irish party that props up Johnson\u2019s government, said it will not vote for the deal.\n\n\u201c(The pound is) reflecting pessimism over the likelihood of whether the deal will be able to pass through parliament tomorrow,\u201d said Lee Hardman, currency analyst at MUFG. \u201cWe think it\u2019s going to be a close call. We\u2019re a little more optimistic.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s rejected you might get a knee-jerk pound selloff, but we don\u2019t think the downside risks are that great. We think there\u2019d be an extension and an election. We don\u2019t see no-deal risks coming back to the market.\u201d\n\nMembers of parliament will vote on the deal on Saturday - the first Saturday session since 1982. Britain\u2019s scheduled departure date from the European Union is Oct. 31.\n\nThe most decisive move on Friday would be a change in the DUP\u2019s position, but that looked unlikely, MUFG\u2019s Hardman said.\n\nOpposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn has also said he could not support the deal.\n\nUnderscoring that the market is on alert for further wild swings in the pound, options linked to volatility expiring within the next week have more than doubled in price since last Friday.\n\nImplied overnight volatility on sterling rose to more than 18%, a new seven-month high.", "description": "The pound retreated on Friday morning, as relief that a Brexit deal had been agreed was replaced by doubts the proposed deal will get through the British parliament in Saturday's vote.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Howcroft", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442215894&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H0O5", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
