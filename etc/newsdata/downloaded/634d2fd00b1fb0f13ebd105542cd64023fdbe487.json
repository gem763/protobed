A proposed package worth around \u00a3300m is said to have been agreed in principle between the Six Nations and CVC, which would also mean the latter owning a 15 % share of autumn and summer tour commercial rights.\n\nSouth Africa reveal scope of random drug testing at Rugby World Cup Read more\n\nWith CVC, previously involved in Formula One, having already bought into the Gallagher Premiership and looking to tie up a further partnership deal with the Guinness Pro14, the prospect of radical alterations to the existing international and club structure is steadily increasing, potentially undermining World Rugby\u2019s authority as the sport\u2019s governing body.\n\n\u201cSomeone who is as big an investor in the sport as a private equity firm like CVC will create influence. That is something that in some areas could concern us,\u201d said Brett Gosper, World Rugby\u2019s chief executive. \u201cWhen you have a high-funding commercial owner of the sport that isn\u2019t the governing body then certain calls can be made which we might think aren\u2019t in the interests of the sport\u2019s growth, player welfare or other areas. We would want to make sure things are being done for the right reasons and that our influence wasn\u2019t usurped.\u201d\n\nWorld Rugby will now be pressing for further details, having previously failed to reach their own agreement with CVC to back their rejected World League proposal which would have involved the world\u2019s leading 10 nations playing against each other to create more interest in non-World Cup years. \u201cThe Six Nations have decided to take another route but I\u2019d have to say we don\u2019t know enough about the ins and outs of that deal,\u201d said Gosper.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t really comment at this stage whether it\u2019s good or bad. But many of our biggest members have welcomed this increased funding and so we can only recognise it as a positive. We just have a couple of concerns and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll have a chance to discuss those with CVC and the Six Nations. Given the recent positions CVC have taken in the game it would be madness for us not to be in some source of communication with them. We all want a healthy, growing sport.\u201d", "description": "World Rugby officials have expressed their concern at the potential implications of Europe\u2019s major rugby-playing nations signing a game-changing new deal with a private equity firm", "authors": ["Robert Kitson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d180d95bc60db9eba78ecd337f220779b0b9259d/0_71_4331_2598/master/4331.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d7212efecba69ce26f01f80832157515", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
