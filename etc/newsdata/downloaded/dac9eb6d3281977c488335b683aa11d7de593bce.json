Nor did the other luminaries who eulogized Cummings this afternoon: Bill and Hillary Clinton, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, or Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, the congressman\u2019s widow and his possible successor in the House.\n\nBut just as he was when McCain was laid to rest a year ago in Washington, D.C., Trump seemed a spectral presence at Cummings\u2019s funeral\u2014an object of implicit scorn in contrast with the deceased; a figure who was, in internet speak, subtweeted in speech after speech. Cummings died at the pinnacle of his power, 10 months after becoming chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee and just as he was about to assume a prominent role in the impeachment inquiry into Trump.\n\n\u201cHe stood against corrupt leadership, like King Ahab and Queen Jezebel,\u201d said Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state, comparing Cummings to his biblical namesake.\n\nWhen her husband spoke, he observed with wonder how Cummings could befriend so many Republicans at a time of such intense partisanship.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t run a free society if you have to hate everybody you disagree with,\u201d the former president said, as again the mourners cheered what they saw as a reference to the current one. Those in the pews included two of Trump\u2019s most loyal congressional GOP allies, Representatives Mark Meadows of North Carolina and Jim Jordan of Ohio. Meadows was a close friend of Cummings, and Jordan sparred with him as the top Republican on the oversight panel.\n\nLike McCain, whose service in Vietnam Trump denigrated, Cummings spent the last months of his life in the president\u2019s rhetorical crosshairs. Trump called out Cummings\u2019s beloved Baltimore as \u201ca disgusting rat and rodent infested mess\u201d and blamed the Democrat for the city\u2019s struggles with crime and poverty. Trump didn\u2019t attend Cummings\u2019s funeral. Nor did he go to McCain\u2019s. But his daughter Ivanka and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, sat in the church last year as the late senator\u2019s daughter Meghan McCain castigated their father without naming him. \u201cThe America of John McCain has no need to be made great again,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause America was always great.\u201d\n\nRead: Elijah Cummings, reluctant partisan warrior\n\nThis afternoon, Cummings\u2019s widow drew the sharpest contrast between her late husband and the president who attacked him. She began by acknowledging Obama and the Clintons in the front row. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have any challenges like we do now,\u201d Rockeymoore Cummings told Obama, drawing a laugh from the former president. She noted how Cummings was a fierce defender of Hillary Clinton against \u201cvery spurious claims\u201d made by Republicans over the years. \u201cThen he had to go on fighting for our democracy against very real corruption,\u201d she added, as Clinton herself nodded along.", "description": "The unnamed, uninvited president was a spectral presence at the funeral of Representative Elijah Cummings.", "authors": ["Russell Berman"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/RTS2STOR/facebook.jpg?1572027364", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
