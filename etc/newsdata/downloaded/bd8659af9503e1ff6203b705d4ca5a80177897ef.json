In this article, we define cash burn as its annual (negative) free cash flow, which is the amount of money a company spends each year to fund its growth.

Generally speaking, a listed business can raise new cash through issuing shares or taking on debt. Commonly, a business will sell new shares in itself to raise cash to drive growth. By comparing a company's annual cash burn to its total market capitalisation, we can estimate roughly how many shares it would have to issue in order to run the company for another year (at the same burn rate).\n\nLajin Entertainment Network Group has a market capitalisation of HK$438m and burnt through HK$62m last year, which is 14% of the company's market value. As a result, we'd venture that the company could raise more cash for growth without much trouble, albeit at the cost of some dilution.\n\nHow Risky Is Lajin Entertainment Network Group's Cash Burn Situation?\n\nEven though its falling revenue makes us a little nervous, we are compelled to mention that we thought Lajin Entertainment Network Group's cash runway was relatively promising.
