This is your ultimate wish list", "language": "en", "text": "Who cares about obvious trends when fashion has so much more to offer now, from moving backstories to luxurious, sustainable fabrics?\n\nMy 2019 autumn/winter wish list takes us from Myanmar to Uruguay (not literally, that would be one serious carbon footprint), via London, New York, Paris and Milan, while bathing us in a glow of cream, caramel, smoky greys and - because - pink.\n\nIt all works together and apart, as a capsule should, and although every piece feels of the moment, there's nothing here that screams 'this moment only'. Which is as it should be, because each and every item has been built to last.\n\n-----\n\n1. CREAM ON TOP\n\nCream coats are the new mink coats, reimagined for a fur-shunning, mindful generation of consumers - deluxe, movie-star glamorous and halo-effectful. Glorious when you're still sun-kissed and can go bare-legged, and stunning when you're ready to do your Snow Queen thing.\n\nThere's a version at nearly every major fashion house, but Brunello Cucinelli's obsession with quality yarns and at-its-own-pace production - in the medieval village of Solomeo he happens to own - is the quintessence of buying to last and to treasure.
