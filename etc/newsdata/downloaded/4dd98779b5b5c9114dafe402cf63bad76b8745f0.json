(AP) - Thirteen companies have submitted proposals to run New Hampshire\u2019s new sports betting system, lottery officials said Monday.\n\nRepublican Gov. Chris Sununu signed a law in July that legalizes betting on professional and most Division I college sports, excluding games involving New Hampshire schools.\n\nMobile betting and retail gambling at 10 locations will be allowed, and the wagering is expected to produce an estimated $7.5 million for education in fiscal year 2021 and $13.5 million two years later.\n\nThe new law created a Division of Sports Wagering within the New Hampshire Lottery, which said Monday that it expects to approve final contracts by the end of November and launch sports betting by early 2020.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased and encouraged at both the robust number of responses and the overall quality of the proposals,\u201d lottery director Charlie McIntyre said in a statement.\n\nVoters in New Hampshire communities will have a chance to weigh in on permitting the operation of betting locations. The lottery is working to provide information on sports betting to cities with November elections.\n\nSince a U.S. Supreme Court last year ended Nevada\u2019s monopoly on legal sportsbooks, they\u2019ve opened in 12 more states. They\u2019ve also been legalized but have not yet opened in another five - including New Hampshire - plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. The issue is going to voters in Colorado this November.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Thirteen companies have submitted proposals to run New Hampshire's new sports betting system, lottery officials said Monday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
