REUTERS/Tuqa Khalid/File Photo\n\nThe seasonally adjusted IHS Markit UAE Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI), which covers manufacturing and services, fell slightly to 51.1, from 51.6 in August.\n\nAlthough the non-oil sector remained in growth territory \u2014 figures above 50 indicate expansion and below that, contraction \u2013- it was the UAE\u2019s weakest growth rate since May 2010.\n\nNew orders were at the softest they have been since the survey began more than 10 years ago, demonstrating weak demand in the country\u2019s non-oil economy.\n\nAlthough it picked up from last month, output remained near a six-year low.\n\nEmployment growth was positive but weak, with most firms keeping employment unchanged following a contraction last month.\n\nThe UAE, which has the most diversified economy in the region, raised its expectations for economic growth in 2019 to 2.4% last month, driven by faster growth in the oil sector, after lowering them earlier this year.\n\nThe economy grew 1.7% in 2018, according to preliminary data released by the government.\n\n\u201cCompanies reported further competitive pressures, while also seeing a slowdown in customer movement despite sustained price discounting,\u201d said David Owen, economist at IHS Markit and author of the report.\n\n\u201cWith this in mind, businesses were more downbeat toward the one-year outlook,\u201d he added.", "description": "Growth in the United Arab Emirates's non-oil private sector slowed to a nine-year low in September, amid record low new orders reflecting soft demand, a survey showed on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436504861&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF92084"}
