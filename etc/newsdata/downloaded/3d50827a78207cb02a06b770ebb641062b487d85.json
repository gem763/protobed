Discovered in 1959, the seamount rises from 4,600 metres in depth and makes a patch of rock that at its shallowest point lies at 26 metres underwater. Nutrient rich deepwater is transported by currents upslope and eventually hits the sunlit upper layers of the water column.\n\nVema is one of the few seamounts that reach close to the water surface and hence is at diveable depths. The sunlit peaks and parts of the plateau are dominated by Kelp habitats and home to seaweeds, crustaceans, seastars and other spineless animal species.\n\nDue to its location in High Seas, there was no fisheries control or management leading to a huge population of Tristan lobster, the most expensive lobster species worldwide, to be overfished. It was been under strict protection since 2007. The crew of the Arctic Sunrise want to see if anything has changed since and clean up some litter while they\u2019re at it.\n\n\n\nThe journey is part of Greenpeace\u2019s Pole-to-Pole campaign to rally support for a Global Oceans Treaty which will see 30% of the world's oceans become protected by 2030 under the UN.\n\nLocally, the project is highlighting the impacts of overfishing on local fishing communities in Kalk Bay.\n\nGreenpeace offered Business Insider South Africa a sneak tour onboard to give us glimpse of what life is like on the icebreaker:\n\nWe found a gym:\n\nAptly nick named the \u2018Washing Machine\u2019 by its crew, the Arctic Sunrise icebreaker is one helluva rocky ride as it does not have stabilisation rudders \u2013 it can\u2019t have them as they\u2019ll get scraped off when navigating through ice fields.\n\nThey've got bikes and darts to keep them entertained:\n\nAs well as an ongoing CrossFit challenge.\n\nThe Arctic Sunrise has been part of the Greenpeace fleet since 1995 when she took her first trip to the North Sea to document marine pollution by oil from offshore installations. The ship was bought under a pseudonym as sellers did not want Greenpeace to purchase it.\n\nThere was parsley in the bathoom.\n\n\n\nSince then, she has been all over the planet, including the Congo, the Amazon and most recently a three-month expedition to the Antarctic to conduct scientific research on biodiversity in the region.\n\nTom the Puffin is their cabin mascot.\n\nThe ship made its way down the African coast from Dakar, Senegal, on September 15.\n\nThey've got cool graffiti over surfaces:\n\nOnce at the Vema Seamount, researchers will take tissue samples of Kelp to be analysed for their genetic information. No samples of Vema Kelp have ever been taken.\n\nThere was even a shopping list:\n\nSecondly they want to take underwater video footage using an underwater drone. The Remote Operated Vehicle footage will be analysed by researchers to tell the species visible on the images. This has also never been done before on Verma.\n\nFinally their lounge had plenty of wine, books and guitars hanging from the ceiling:\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\n\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "On 20 October it sets sail on an expedition to document Tristan lobsters and to recover \u2018ghost nets\u2019 (abandoned fishing gear).", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9490/0ec01e1eabc646bd9ce04e3a437d31ef.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
