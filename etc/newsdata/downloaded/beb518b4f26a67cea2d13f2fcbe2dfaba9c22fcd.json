This party of Gandhi and Subhas, of Nehru and Patel, of Azad and Rajaji, all those who constitute the greatest generation in India\u2019s history shall not be allowed to die.\n\nAstute world leaders like Sheikh Hasina know this, so they hug. Manmohan Singh, who bore many a humiliation at the hands of the Gandhis while he was PM, has morphed into a sort of father figure for the family and the party. He looked on as the hug went on.\n\nThe princelings say that there must be introspection. Why? What role did any of the princelings play in rescuing the party from the debacle of 2019? Why should they now be rewarded with plum posts, of chief ministers and leaders of the party\u2019s state units? Why don\u2019t they stay loyal to the party as Manmohan Singh is doing?\n\n2014 and 2019 happened because of the magic of one man, Narendra Modi. But how long will Modi\u2019s magic last? Indira Gandhi\u2019s popularity waned within four years of 1971. Plus the PM is getting on in age. Is there anyone in the Sangh to replace him once he departs from the scene? Claimants there are a many, but truth be told, all of them have been riding on his coattails.\n\nThey also serve who stand and wait. Politics is the art of waiting and watching. The economy is in a rut. The government does not have a financial wizard like Manmohan Singh or even P. Chidambaram (yes, a shout out to you, PC. Keep your chin up! We all know what you have done for the country, especially after 26/11.) to jolt the economy. In NDA2, there was the mantra of the world\u2019s fastest growing major economy. Now that has been discarded for the cry of a $5 trillion economy. If wishes were horses, beggars would ride them.\n\nFinancial wizardry is not learnt on the job as minister. You have to be a financial wizard before you become finance minister. None of the Big 4 ministers can lay claim to financial wizardry. None of the second-tier can do so as well. The PM still has a cult following, but if he\u2019s not careful, and with the global economy slowing down, India\u2019s dire-straits economy could spoil his second term. And by dire straits, I don\u2019t mean the rock band.\n\nThe good news for the Congress is that Priyanka Gandhi is now permanently in active politics. With Rahul playing hard to get, finally, the mother might see that it makes sense to push Priyanka into the limelight. Sure, Robert Vadra is like an albatross around Priyanka\u2019s neck, but that\u2019s her personal problem. Let\u2019s leave her to deal with it.\n\nIt\u2019s unfathomable that a person with the political nous of Priyanka would have run the chowkidar chor hai campaign against the PM. Sure she participated in it, but she\u2019s a loyal sister so perhaps went along for the ride. With people like Manmohan Singh taking her along to meet world-leaders like Sheikh Hasina, the party top brass seems to have realized that she is now the one to groom as leader of the party.\n\nWhat many in the party have been wanting for years is finally occurring now. Better late than never. A match-up between the PM and Priyanka in 2024 would be irresistible to watch. Two charismatic leaders at the top of their game. But the PM would be at the fag end of building his legacy. She would only just be getting started.", "description": "As Shashi Tharoor takes on a higher and higher profile, as the Congress President takes on a lower and lower one, as the man who would have been king disappears god alone knows where, as...", "authors": ["Sunil Sharan"], "top_image": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/unnamed.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
