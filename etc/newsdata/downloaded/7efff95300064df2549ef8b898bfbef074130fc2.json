Its first accounts in 2014 showed it had minus \u00a341,540 in shareholders\u2019 funds.\n\nThe Guardian also understands that Arcuri attended an event hosted at Buckingham Palace by the Duke of York in December 2014. Her latest company, Hacker House, apparently later claimed to have the backing of Prince Andrew for a scheme providing cyber badges for children.\n\nContacted by the Guardian, Arcuri broke her week-long silence to declare: \u201cThe stories you are writing are more and more false. These are fake news.\u201d\n\nBut when a reporter pointed out that government documents publicly available on the internet prove she was accepted on to the entrepreneur scheme months after Johnson promoted her business, asking her to clarify which part was false, she replied: \u201cNo comment.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Johnson stonewalled repeated questions about his friendship with 34-year-old Arcuri \u2013 first revealed by a Sunday Times investigation \u2013 as he visited New York for a UN summit. There is no suggestion Johnson intervened in helping Arcuri win the visa.\n\nArcuri first met the politician in 2012 after moving to the UK to study for an MBA. Johnson appeared at four events for Innotech, which organises summits for young technology entrepreneurs. In October 2013, Innotech received a \u00a310,000 grant from London and Partners, which Johnson had oversight of as mayor. A further \u00a31,500 was given by L&P to sponsor an event the firm held at parliament.\n\nShe relocated back to the US last June but her latest company, Hacker House, won a \u00a3100,000 cyber skills grant from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport earlier this year, which is now subject to an investigation by the department over whether the firm was eligible for the grant, which is only intended for UK-operating companies.\n\nArcuri spoke publicly after her struggles to obtain a visa in a Sunday Times interview in July 2013, telling the paper that she was nearly ready to pack up and go home to the US.\n\nAccording to the story, she needed \u00a3200,000 of investment to remain in the UK, allowing her to apply for a tier 1 entrepreneur visa, giving her a three-year stay. She successfully won the money earlier that month, the article reported, quoting her as saying: \u201cMost of us give up. We come here, spend a lot of money on studies and have to leave because it\u2019s too tough.\u201d\n\nMonths earlier, on 26 April 2013, Johnson attended an Innotech Summit, helping Arcuri promote her new venture and raise its profile. He said: \u201cThere are 24,000 tech business here in London: nanotech, fintech, biotech, greentech, Innotech. There are huge numbers of brilliant people coming here to London.\u201d\n\nAnd speaking at an Innotech event in 2012, Johnson said: \u201cThis is exactly the kind of entrepreneurship that I think is going to lead London, lead this country, out of recession. I hope very much that I can do everything in my power to encourage Tech City and everybody who works in it to flourish.\u201d\n\nThe Sirius scheme helps provide visas for \u201cinternational graduates with ambitions to start and grow a business \u2026 in the UK\u201d. It said that \u201cteams with ideas for a business or existing startups in the early stages should apply for this programme\u201d.\n\nA 2015 brochure for the scheme \u201cintroducing some of the world\u2019s most talented graduate entrepreneurs\u201d shows Arcuri\u2019s Innotech successfully won a place after the visa programme was launched in July 2013. It stated: \u201cInnotech Summit is the only event to bridge the gap between entrepreneurs, investors and policy-makers in order to stimulate the growth of tech clusters around the world.\u201d\n\nIn May 2014, Arcuri spoke about how grateful she was for the visa. \u201cI\u2019m very thankful to the Sirius programme for allowing me to come to the UK \u2026 and to build a company to rock the world with!\u201d\n\nA former employee of Arcuri\u2019s said: \u201cShe had visa problems, which is why she had to raise a certain amount of money in 2013 after completing her MBA.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, according to a source, Arcuri attended an event at Buckingham Palace in December 2014 hosted by Prince Andrew. The event, Code Club at the Palace, was held for delegates of D5, a Cabinet Office-run summit bringing together \u201cadvanced digital governments and reinforc[ing] the UK\u2019s position as a digital world leader\u201d.\n\nIt was later claimed that Hacker House won the backing of Prince Andrew for a scheme that would award cyber badges to children.\n\nDetails of the prince\u2019s endorsement were mentioned during an extradition hearing for Lauri Love \u2013 who met Arcuri in 2015 and worked for Hacker House. In June 2016, Love successfully fought extradition to the US over allegations that he stole huge amounts of data from government agencies. But the cyber badges scheme never got off the ground, according to a source.\n\nMeanwhile, an interview given by Arcuri in 2016 mentioned that Hacker House was developing \u201ccyber badges for schools, on request of the Duke of York, to understand the awareness and ethics of cybersecurity\u201d.\n\nArcuri denied that Prince Andrew backed her firm but when asked to explain why it was mentioned in the article, she failed to respond.\n\nA spokesman for the Duke of York declined to comment.\n\nThe Department for International Trade declined to comment.", "description": "US tech boss given right to stay months after Boris Johnson gave speeches at Innotech", "authors": ["Simon Murphy", "Matthew Weaver", "John Crace"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1a01eb9e2569e23d7ea1dc217364945cba75d53/111_96_2088_1253/master/2088.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=28ecaaaded8ba0c25e176515c41891d5", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
