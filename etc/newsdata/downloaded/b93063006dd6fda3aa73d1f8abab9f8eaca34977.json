The second complaint came after Trump\u2019s call to President Zelensky on July 25:\n\nI did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government\u2019s support of Ukraine. I realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained.\u201d\n\nVindman, a Ukrainian-American immigrant who was wounded by a roadside bomb while serving in Iraq, was also concerned by \u201coutside influencers promoting a false narrative of Ukraine inconsistent with the consensus views\u201d inside the intelligence agency. According to all indications, \u2014 and additional documents reviewed by the New York Times \u2014 that\u2019s the crack team of Rudy Giuliani. Though Vindman intends to testify that he is \u201cnot the whistleblower,\u201d his testimony suggests he may be one of the aides that the intelligence officer referenced discussing the matter with in their initial complaint.\n\nAside from corroborating the testimony of ex-NSC official Fiona Hill \u2014 which established the national security apparatus\u2019 extreme hesitancy toward Trump\u2019s actions and Giuliani\u2019s presence \u2014 Vindman\u2019s account as the first current White House official to appear before the House impeachment inquiry also shows that the president\u2019s efforts to suppress testimony aren\u2019t going to succeed beyond true believers in the administration or on his payroll. Vinland won\u2019t be the last White House official to testify this week. On Thursday, as the House intends to vote on impeachment proceedings, NSC official Tim Morrison will appear before the inquiry. Morrison, who was reportedly the first official on the July 25 call, intends to testify even if the White House makes an effort to block him.", "description": "National Security Council Ukraine expert Alexander Vindman will become the first current White House official to testify before the impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Matt Stieb"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/29/trump_impeachment.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
