They told border guards they were from Iran.\n\nA source at the Kent port told The Daily Telegraph: 'The migrants inside were kicking off at the French patrol vessel, firing flares up and being a nuisance because they didn't want to go back to France. By then they were in British territorial waters so had to be picked up by the British.'\n\nMeanwhile another small boat made it to the Kent coast, landing near the famous Shakespeare cliff.\n\nIt is believed eight people were on board that boat. The Home Office said four were later found in Dover.\n\nIn the third incident of yesterday, two more men were found in Dover and said they had arrived in the back of a lorry. They will be interviewed by immigration officials.\n\nBorder Force officers are pictured dealing with those who arrived in Dover this morning\n\nIn a separate incident, eight people made it to shore are Shakespeare Beach in Dover\n\nThe migrants are the latest to make it into Britain as record numbers have reached the country this year.\n\nNearly 1,500 have made the perilous trip across the Channel - more than the whole of 2018 - with most of them crossing in small boats.\n\nSome extremely desperate migrants have even made it over in kayaks in their bid for asylum.\n\nIn August a record 336 made it to the UK from France, including 86 in one day. During that surge, two migrants died.\n\nOne of them was a woman who drowned after falling overboard, sparking a huge search and rescue operation by British and Belgian authorities. Her body was found on Dutch waters weeks later.\n\nA 48-year-old Iraqi man died trying to swim from France. He was found off the coast of Zeebrugge in Belgium wearing diver fins and with plastic bottles strapped to him as a makeshift life jacket.\n\nFour of those who made it ashore were found in Dover after leaving wet clothes on the beach\n\nThe crisis sparked Home Secretary Priti Patel to draw up an action plan with her French counterpart - even after the Government had already spent millions of pounds on trying to tackle the problem.\n\nMore patrols of French beaches are now being carried out in an effort to clamp down on evil people smugglers who charge migrants thousands to risk their lives in dinghies to get to Britain.\n\nA Home Office spokeswoman said: 'We work with partners across Europe and beyond to tackle illegal migration and recently agreed a plan with France, which has seen patrols on French beaches doubled and action to disrupt criminal gangs intensified as part of our work to prevent migrants crossing the Channel in small boats.\n\n'The people who facilitate this are ruthless and do not care about the risk to life.'", "description": "There are widespread concerns about the increasingly dangerous routes people are taking to try to get to the UK after 39 people died inside an airtight, container in Essex last week.", "authors": ["Richard Spillett For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/10/20320448-0-image-a-22_1572345698108.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
