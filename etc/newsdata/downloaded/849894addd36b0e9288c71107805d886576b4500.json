The Cowboys met much more resistance in the Superdome, where the Saints\u2019 defensive front was bolstered by the return of defensive tackle Sheldon Rankins from an Achilles tendon tear that had sidelined him since January.\n\nDallas (3-1) finished with 45 yards on the ground.\n\nDak Prescott gave Dallas one last shot when he found Randall Cobb over the middle for 32 yards to the Dallas 48 and spiked the ball with 2 seconds left. But his desperation heave was rushed by a Saints blitz and safety Marcus Williams came down with an interception and New Orleans\u2019 third forced turnover of the game.\n\nTeddy Bridgewater made his second start in place of Drew Brees, who attended the game with a cast on his surgically repaired right thumb. Bridgewater was 23 of 30 for 193 yards and was intercepted once, albeit on an accurate pass that bounced off of Ted Ginn Jr.\u2019s hands near midfield in the first quarter.\n\nEzekiel Elliot scored the game\u2019s only touchdown in the third quarter to give Dallas a 10-9 lead, but finished with just 35 yards and his longest run was 6 yards. He was also stripped by Bell on a fourth-and-short run.\n\nPrescott finished 22 of 33 for 223 yards.\n\nWhile the Saints (3-1) could not get in the end zone, they sustained several productive drives with the help of receiver Michael Thomas, who had nine catches for 95 yards, and running back Alvin Kamara, who had 69 yards rushing and 20 yards receiving.\n\nThe Saints were in range of a field goal that could have put them ahead by five when blitzing Jaylon Smith sacked Bridgewater back at the 47-yard line, forcing New Orleans to punt, up by less than a field goal, with 1:45 to go.\n\nDefensive tackle David Onyemata had the Saints\u2019 only sack of Prescott on the first play of Dallas\u2018 final drive. The Cowboys briefly recovered with a first down, but were pushed back on Amari Cooper\u2019s offensive pass interference call with 30 seconds left.\n\nDallas\u2018 defensive end Robert Quinn had two sacks, one week after he had a sack and a career-high seven QB pressures in his Dallas debut against Miami following a two-game suspension for violating the NFL\u2019s policy on performance enhancers.\n\nYELLOW FEVER\n\nOnly a few days before the game, Saints coach Sean Payton mentioned that New Orleans was 12-1 with the officiating crew headed by referee Carl Cheffers that worked the game, and joked that his players better be nice. The Saints were penalized nine times for 80 yards, and a pass interference call against linebacker Damario Davis on third down extended Dallas\u2018 first touchdown drive in the third quarter. The Cowboys were penalized six times for 64 yards.\n\nINJURIES\n\nCowboys: Reserve safety Kavon Frazier left the game in the first half with a pectoral injury.\n\nSaints: Reserve defensive end Trey Hendrickson, who entered the game leading the Saints in sacks with three, was taken to the locker room with a neck injury in the second quarter and did not return.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCowboys: Host Green Bay on Sunday.\n\nSaints: Open NFC South play at home against Tampa Bay on Sunday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Vonn Bell's forced fumble and two recoveries helped the Saints stifle a Dallas offense that had rolled through its first three games, and Wil Lutz kicked four field goals to lift New Orleans to a 12-10 victory over the Cowboys on Sunday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Brett Martel"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/29/cowboys_saints_football_93329_c0-229-5472-3419_s1770x1032.jpg?6f9ce78ee1a3a25672569ab4bf84dc3559d8855e", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
