Having amassed a fortune from artillery factories and the invention of dynamite and other explosives, the Swedish businessman had an eye on his legacy.\n\nThe fund set up five prizes to be awarded annually to those whose work in the preceding year was deemed to \u201chave conferred the greatest benefit on mankind\u201d. He named five prizes: physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature and peace.\n\nIn 1968, a donation from Sweden\u2019s central bank established the Nobel memorial prize for economics, which family members argue is not a real Nobel. All are handed out from Sweden apart from the peace prize, which Nobel stipulated without explanation should be awarded from Norway.\n\nHow do you win one?\n\nNo one can put themselves forward, but each year thousands of professors, members of national academies, Nobel laureates and even parliamentary assemblies lobby the Nobel committees on behalf of their favoured candidates. Nominations open the preceding September and close in January.\n\nThe Nobel Foundation\u2019s penchant for secrecy ensures that nominees are not revealed for 50 years. Nomination does not ensure success, however. Lise Meitner, who helped split the atom, never received the Nobel prize despite being nominated 48 times.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Austrian-Swedish physicist Lise Meitner, pictured in 1927, was nominated 48 times.

Nobels have been doled out for inventions such as integrated circuits, MRI machines and a host of microscopes, and for discoveries from subatomic particles and the HIV virus to the twisted ladder of DNA and gravitational waves.\n\nSerendipity often plays a role: in 1965, Robert Wilson and Arno Penzias feared that pigeon droppings were to blame for the annoying interference that plagued their new radio telescope. They later realised its true origins: the afterglow of the big bang.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The latest generation of satellite telescopes at a facility on Sierra Negra in Mexico.

The award has done a good job of rewarding men who create mathematical models of the world, none of which predicted that major banks would drive themselves into the ground in 2008-09.\n\nThe literature committee pores over the life\u2019s work of each nominee for evidence that they have brought something new into the world. Humour is rarely rewarded. For Mo Yan, the first Chinese citizen to win the prize, it was \u201challucinatory realism\u201d, while Doris Lessing \u201can epicist of the female experience\u201d subjected \u201ca divided civilisation to scrutiny\u201d. Bob Dylan, author of the line \u201cwiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup\u201d was honoured for creating \u201cnew poetic expressions\u201d.\n\nThe peace prize is by far the most political Nobel. Unusually, it can be given to entire organisations, with past recipients ranging from the International Committee of the Red Cross and the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the European Union. But plenty of individuals have won in their pursuit of peace: Dr Martin Luther King, leader of the civil rights movement; Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the human rights and anti-apartheid activist; and Malala Yousafzai, for her struggle against the suppression of children.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dr Martin Luther King and his wife, Coretta, wait to board a flight to Oslo to collect his peace prize in 1964.

But since most of the prizes are shared between two or three people, the individual winnings can be as low as 2.25m kronor.\n\nFor some laureates (or their families) the gold medals are more lucrative. In 2014, James Watson became the first living laureate to auction his medal. It was bought by Alisher Usmanov, the richest man in Russia, for $4.1m (\u00a33.3m), who then announced he would return the medal to Watson. A year earlier, the family of Francis Crick, who died in 2004, sold his medal for $2.27m.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Nobel medal awarded to the late Colombian novelist Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez.

Invitations to give talks, attend parties and pronounce opinions on a wide variety of topics come flooding in. Some are thrilled to have a platform from which to raise political issues and gain access to politicians, business leaders and the media. For others, this comes as a downside. The Anglo-Dutch laureate Sir Andre Geim joked that \u201cjournalists\u2019 questions\u201d were one of the negatives.\n\nAnother physics laureate, Brian Schmidt told New Scientist magazine: \u201cOne of the pitfalls of being a Nobel winner is that our voices are too loud when it comes to providing personal opinion \u2013 and in this respect, I need to be far more careful than I used to be about what I say and what I write.\u201d\n\nA Nobel may be expected to boost a person\u2019s influence within their own field of expertise, but at least in some cases the reverse seems to occur. One study, which tracked the publication record of 204 Nobel laureates from 1980 to 2009, found that papers published after the award were cited less and published in more lowly journals.\n\nMartin Chalfie, who won the chemistry Nobel in 2008, complained that he\u2019d even struggled to recruit students since winning the prize, which he speculated could have been because people were put off by the \u201cinsufferable laureate\u201d stereotype. \u201cThe number of people that apply to the lab, certainly, doesn\u2019t grow and may actually plummet. No one is quite sure why that is,\u201d he said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Martin Chalfie was among a trio to win a Nobel in 2008 for their work on the green fluorescent protein (GFP).

Gerald Murnane, who pulls pints at his golf club in Goroke, 250 miles north-west of Melbourne, must be a contender. But there are plenty more: Ngugi wa Thiong\u2019o, the Kenyan author who was jailed for a year without trial in 1978; a slew of Americans from Joyce Carol Oates to Don DeLillo and Thomas Pynchon, and Haruki Murakami, who is always one of the bookies\u2019 favourites.\n\nWe could see a medicine or chemistry prize for gene editing go to Jennifer Doudna, Emmanuel Charpentier and Feng Zhang. It\u2019s too soon for those behind the Event Horizon Telescope to win the physics prize for the first image of the point of no return around a black hole. But Alain Aspect and others are in with a chance for their work on quantum entanglement, described by Einstein as \u201cspooky action at a distance\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, the US researchers Colin Camerer and George Loewenstein have a shot at the economics prize for their work on behavioural economics and \u201cneuroeconomics\u201d.\n\nThe 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg has been nominated for the peace prize. But unless she was nominated before the January deadline, she cannot be considered for this year\u2019s prize. Pope Francis is in with a chance.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Greta Thunberg gives evidence before a US congressional committee last month. Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters\n\nIs there a diversity problem?\n\nThe statistics don\u2019t look good. Very few women have been recognised over the years. When Donna Strickland was awarded the prize in physics last year, she broke a 54-year exclusively male run and became the third woman to receive it. There have only been five female chemistry winners and it\u2019s alarming that the economics prize, supposedly a modern addition to the gongs, has the worst ratio of female to male winners, with only one woman, Elinor Ostrom, winning since 1969. Since 1901, only three women have won the physics prize.\n\nAn argument often wheeled out in discussions about the scarcity of women is that since Nobel prizes are often awarded to people late in their careers, the honours list reflects a time when laboratories were even less diverse than they are today. It is worth noting, that the age of winners has been increasing. Between 1931 and 1940 the average age of physics winner was 41; this decade it has been 68.\n\nThere have also been criticisms that the awards have a western bias with the US, Canada and western Europe accounting for more than 81% of the total number of laureates since 1901. Africa is the region with the fewest \u2013 just 17, of which only seven were outside South Africa.\n\nMore men called John have won Nobels than have Africans.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The former Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf is one of just 17 Nobel laureates from Africa. Photograph: Nic Bothma/EPA\n\nHave any awards turned out to be misjudged?\n\nOne of the most clearcut cases is Johannes Fibiger, who won the 1926 prize in medicine \u201cfor his discovery of the Spiroptera carcinoma\u201d. Fibiger discovered a tiny parasitic worm which he concluded caused stomach cancer in rodents, but the animals were later shown to have skin problems caused by vitamin A deficiency. His discovery was considered \u201cthe greatest contribution to experimental medicine\u201d at the time, but later declared \u201cone of the biggest blunders made by the Karolinska Institute\u201d.\n\nAnother heavily criticised choice was the 1949 prize in physiology or medicine awarded to the Portuguese neurologist Ant\u00f3nio Egas Moniz for his development of the prefrontal lobotomy, a procedure that was later discredited and banned \u2013 but only after tens of thousands of patients were subjected to it.\n\nThere are also prizes that just seem a bit odd in hindsight. Nils Gustaf Dal\u00e9n won the 1912 prize in physics for inventing a new kind of lighthouse valve that automatically switched off the beacon at sunrise. A boon for lighthouse keepers, but a leftfield choice, given that Einstein had just come up with the theory of relativity.\n\nThe peace prize committee arguably have the hardest task, nominating a person or organisation responsible for \u201cthe most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses\u201d. Many criticised as absurdly premature the award to Barack Obama, who was nominated within 12 days of taking office; the 1991 prize to Aung San Suu Kyi has been mired in controversy after her failure to do anything about the persecution of Rohingya Muslims by Myanmar\u2019s military. Gandhi never received the Nobel peace prize, although he was nominated five times and decades later, in 2006, a Nobel committee declared this as the organisations \u201cgreatest omission in our 106-year history\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rohingya refugees gather behind a barbed wire fence in a temporary settlement between Myanmar and Bangladesh. Photograph: Ye Aung Thu/AFP/Getty Images\n\nDo the prizes ever cause problems?\n\nThere are controversies aplenty. When the then US secretary of state, Henry Kissinger, was awarded the peace prize in 1973, two Norwegian Nobel committee members resigned in protest. Kissinger had ordered a bombing raid of Hanoi while negotiating the ceasefire.\n\nThe 2010 peace prize award to Chinese writer and human rights activist Liu Xaiobo triggered a diplomatic row between the unamused communist authorities and Norway.\n\nThe 2008 prize for medicine should have been the German virologist Harald zur Hausen\u2019s finest hour. But the prize, awarded for his discovery that HPV causes cervical cancer, was overshadowed by an anti-corruption investigation by the Swedish police over links between the pharmaceuticals company AstraZeneca, which had a major stake in HPV vaccines, and two members of the medicine prize\u2019s selection committee (charges were never brought).\n\nThe rule of three for the science and economics prizes has been criticised for promoting the myth of the lone genius. There are also those who believe the wrong people who have been recognised. In 2003, the US doctor Raymond Damadian took out full-page adverts in several newspapers over the \u201cshameful\u201d decision to overlook his contributions to developing MRI, which went to Paul Lauterbur and Sir Peter Mansfield. Others are more philosophical. Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell, who was overlooked for her discovery of quasars, told the Guardian she felt she had \u201cdone very well out of not getting a Nobel prize\u201d because she had won another award almost every year since, which is \u201cmuch more fun\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Last year\u2019s Nobel prize banquet in the Stockholm\u2019s City Hall, Sweden. Photograph: Jonathan Nackstrand/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhat happens at the ceremony?\n\nThink pomp, royals and a touch of madness. The prizes are presented to winners on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel\u2019s death. The science, literature and economics prizes are handed out by the King of Sweden in Stockholm, while the chair of the Norwegian Nobel committee awards the peace prize in Oslo.\n\nWith diplomas and medals in hand, the freshly minted laureates head off to a banquet. Cue tooting trumpets, vigorous organ playing, toasts, music, dance, speeches, gallons of champagne and plates bearing such items as turbot cupolas, pumpkin gel, guinea hen mosaics, watercress foam, potato pithiviers, clouds of fruit and deep fried rice paper.\n\nIn case time drags, there is plenty of entertainment. Last year the Royal Swedish Ballet, Opera and Orchestra performed four acts on the theme of courage. In 2015, the Swedish singer Anna Ternheim sang about loneliness to the accompaniment of a string octet and a saw, followed by another singer joined by a man with a laser harp.\n\nIn 2012, it was the acrobats who stole the show. Cirkus Cirk\u00f6rperformed three acts which found their way to the question: \u201cIs it possible to knit peace?\u201d It certainly is, according to the banquet programme. \u201cOne person is never too small to be part of a world-wide knitting for peace,\u201d it declares.", "description": "For some they are the pinnacle of recognition, for others they reek of western bias and sexism.
