Police were called to the scene at about 6:15 p.m.\n\n\"The initial reports were there was some guy running around on the street wielding a machete and he struck a woman repeatedly, knocking her to the ground,\" said Const. David Hopkinson, spokesperson for the Toronto Police Service. \"We even have reports that the attack continued, then he got into a car and fled.\n\n\"Her injuries were very, very bad. She succumbed to her injuries on scene.\"\n\nInvestigators say they have a man in custody who is believed to be responsible for the attack. Both he and the victim are in their 30s, police say.\n\n\"The public can rest assured there's not some crazed, machete-wielding guy out there,\" Hopkinson said.\n\nIt's too early to say what led to the attack, he added.\n\nInsp. Stacey Davis told reporters the man drove to 42 Division and turned himself in after the attack. He and the victim had a \"previous domestic relationship,\" she said.\n\nThe victim lived in the neighbourhood, she added.\n\nPolice are still looking for the machete.", "description": "A woman is dead after a machete attack in Scarborough Wednesday evening, police say.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5280428.1568254516!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/machete-attack.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
