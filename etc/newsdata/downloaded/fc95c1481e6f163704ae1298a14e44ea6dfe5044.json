In the Party Tradition\n\nMr. Clinton's package, notwithstanding a few conservative flourishes, is very much in the Democratic tradition: seeing an active role for government to supplement the free market.\n\nHis blueprint, which is far more specific than any economic plan offered by President Bush or Mr. Perot, seeks to do far more than outline his vision of a reborn American economy. It also aims to force his two main opponents to replace their vague economic oratory with specific plans and to shift the campaign's focus onto the area where he feels most comfortable: issues.\n\nHe vowed to cut the Federal budget deficit in half in four years. And to raise revenues, he said he wanted to increase taxes for the richest 2 percent of the population.\n\nThe Arkansas Governor argued that it was time to move on from the Reagan-Bush era's laissez-faire policies, which he said cut taxes for the rich in the hope that they would invest and create jobs for the less well-off. He said that this trickle-down approach has failed, and he instead backed what some call a trickle-up approach. His hope is that by strengthening workers' skills and by creating modern infrastructure in which to do business, his program will keep and attract industries that provide high-paying jobs. Drawing Criticism\n\nBut his plan quickly drew criticism from many Republicans. \"His investment plan just sounds like it's high tax, high spend,\" said Lawrence Kudlow, a Reagan Administration economist who is now the chief economist with Bear Stearns. \"I think he will have a devil of a time defending it.\"\n\nStill Mr. Clinton took pains to show that he was not just another tax-and-spend Democrat. He pledged to cut the budget deficit to $141 billion in 1996 from close to $400 billion this year. He said he would eliminate 100,000 jobs in the Federal Government and would order Government departments to reduce their administrative expenses by 3 percent a year for four years.", "description": "", "authors": ["Steven Greenhouse"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png", "published_at": "1992-06-23"}
