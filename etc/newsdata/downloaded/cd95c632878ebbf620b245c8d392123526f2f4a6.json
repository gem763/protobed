(Anushree Fadnavis/Reuters)\n\nTwitter CEO Jack Dorsey announced Wednesday that the mammoth social media company will halt all political advertising on the platform globally.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made the decision to stop all political advertising on Twitter globally,\u201d Dorsey wrote in the first of a string of tweets. \u201cWe believe political message reach should be earned, not bought.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve made the decision to stop all political advertising on Twitter globally. We believe political message reach should be earned, not bought. Why? A few reasons\u2026\ud83e\uddf5 \u2014 jack \ud83c\udf0d\ud83c\udf0f\ud83c\udf0e (@jack) October 30, 2019\n\nThe chief executive went on to share some of the rationale for the company\u2019s decision, saying internet advertising comes with \u201csignificant risks to politics,\u201d including \u201cunchecked misleading information\u201d and \u201cdeep fakes.\u201d\n\n\u201cA political message earns reach when people decide to follow an account or retweet,\u201d he wrote. \u201cPaying for reach removes that decision, forcing highly optimized and targeted political messages on people. We believe this decision should not be compromised by money.\u201d\n\nDorsey also took a thinly-veiled shot at some of his competitors, namely YouTube and Facebook, over their political advertising policies. YouTube, a Google subsidiary, said last month that content created by political figures and leaders will be allowed to remain on the site even if it violates the company\u2019s \u201ccommunity guidelines.\u201d Around the same time, Facebook said it would not fact-check posts by politicians, and would allow such content to remain on the platform even if it breaks the company\u2019s content rules.\n\n\u201cIt\u2018s not credible for us to say: \u2018We\u2019re working hard to stop people from gaming our systems to spread misleading info, buuut if someone pays us to target and force people to see their political ad\u2026well\u2026they can say whatever they want!'\u201d Dorsey wrote.\n\nFacebook and Twitter came under fire for negligence during the last presidential-election cycle, when they allowed Russian actors, among others, to spread misinformation and attempt to sow discord on the site.", "description": "Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey announced Wednesday that the mammoth social media company will halt all political advertising on the platform globally.", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle", "Andrew T.
