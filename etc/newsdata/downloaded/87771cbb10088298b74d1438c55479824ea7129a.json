Her suit also claims that payments for the drugs had been blocked.\n\nThe physician last year launched the website Aid Access, which aims to safeguard access to the abortion pills as clinics across the U.S. are driven out of business by increasingly restrictive state laws. A handful of states have only one clinic that provides abortions, forcing patients to travel hundreds of miles to obtain services.\n\n\u201cFor many women seeking to terminate their unwanted pregnancies ... their only practical option is found on the internet,\u201d states Gomperts\u2019 lawsuit. The FDA is \u201cactively using the power of the government to deny ... patients their constitutionally protected right to terminate\u201d their pregnancies.\n\nIn 1991, Gomperts famously launched Women on Waves and provided reproductive health care and abortions in international waters to dodge nations\u2019 restrictive laws.\n\nNow Gomperts consults with patients online, writes prescriptions and provides instructions on how to request the medication from an exporter in India, NPR reported. The pills are then shipped to patients\u2019 homes.\n\nAccording to Gomperts\u2019 lawsuit, 37,000 women from all 50 states in the U.S. have contacted Aid Access since it started in March 2018. She has prescribed abortion pills to more than 7,000 American women seeking to end first-trimester pregnancies, the suit states.\n\nThe drugs, mifepristone and misoprostol, are both approved by the FDA to induce abortion under a doctor\u2019s direction.\n\nThe FDA has refused to comment on the suit.\n\nIn March, the agency issued a warning letter accusing Aid Access of violating federal law by misbranding and facilitating the improper distribution of the drugs, which it called an \u201cinherent risk to consumers.\u201d The agency ordered Aid Access to stop distributing the medications in the U.S.\n\nGomperts has continued to write prescriptions through Aid Access and insists that what she is doing is safe.\n\n\u201cI sincerely believe there is a human right here to be defended,\u201d she told Vice recently. \u201cWhat I\u2019m doing is in accordance with all the human rights agreements that exist, as well as the U.S. Constitution.\u201d", "description": "\"There is a human right here to be defended,\" said Dr. Rebecca Gomperts, who sees the internet as a way around America's most restrictive anti-abortion l...", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7714743b0000039fd0c415.jpeg?cache=c1takuhtku&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
