Those words asked to open the investigation and to get at the truth.\n\nMost Americans will ignore an attack on investigating corruption as just politics.\n\nWHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT ON UKRAINE CALL RELEASED, ALLEGES TRUMP SOLICITED FOREIGN 'INTERFERENCE' IN ELECTION\n\nHowever, when Americans learn how deeply involved Hunter Biden was in China and Ukraine while his father was vice president, they will see a scandal involving a lot of money which is easy to understand and easy to condemn.\n\nThe Biden-Ukraine money problem is not something new. Five years ago, on May 14, 2014, The Washington Post headline warned: \u201cHunter Biden\u2019s new job at Ukrainian gas company is a problem for U.S. soft power.\u201d\n\nVice President Biden\u2019s intervention to protect his son, and his son\u2019s company Burisma, from a Ukrainian corruption investigation, was heavy-handed and amazingly arrogant. And there is no question that Biden interfered. In his own words to the Council on Foreign Relations on Jan. 23, 2018, Biden clearly pushed to have the prosecutor who was investigating his son fired:\n\n\u201cI was supposed to announce that there was another billion-dollar loan guarantee. And I had gotten a commitment from [former Ukrainian President] Poroshenko and from [former Prime Minister Arseniy] Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the state prosecutor. And they didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cSo they said they had\u2014they were walking out to a press conference. I said, nah, I\u2019m not going to\u2014or, we\u2019re not going to give you the billion dollars. They said, you have no authority. You\u2019re not the president. The president said\u2014I said, call him. (Laughter.) I said, I\u2019m telling you, you\u2019re not getting the billion dollars. I said, you\u2019re not getting the billion. I\u2019m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: I\u2019m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money. Well, son of a b*tch. (Laughter.) He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.\u201d\n\nAs Deroy Murdock, who is a member of the council, wrote for Fox News, \u201cBiden\u2019s actions reek of extortion and obstruction of justice.\u201d\n\nNow that the Hunter Biden corruption scandal is beginning to threaten his candidacy, Vice President Biden is trying to come up with a new story.\n\nAs Mark Thiessen wrote for The Washington Post and Fox News in his syndicated column on Tuesday, the former vice president is now claiming he never discussed his son\u2019s business dealings overseas. As Thiessen points out, this claim is \u201cflatly untrue.\u201d Hunter Biden, has already told The New Yorker that Vice President Biden discussed the Ukraine business with his son, saying, \u201cDad said, \u2018I hope you know what you are doing,\u2019 and I said, \u2018I do.\u2019\u201d\n\nAgain citing The New Yorker, Thiessen reported: \u201c\u2018In December, 2015, as Joe Biden prepared to return to Ukraine, his aides braced for renewed scrutiny of Hunter\u2019s relationship with Burisma. Amos Hochstein, the Obama administration\u2019s special envoy for energy policy, raised the matter with Biden. That same month, The New York Times published an article about how Hunter\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine undermined the vice president\u2019s anti-corruption message, which quoted a Biden spokesman saying it had no impact.\u201d\n\nHowever, Ukraine is not the only site of scandalous self-enrichment by Hunter Biden. China is an even bigger center of money going to the former vice president\u2019s son \u2013 money which would not have gone to him if his name had been Hunter Smith.\n\nPeter Schweizer has become a remarkable researcher and writer about corruption. In a May, 11, 2019 New York Post article, he wrote extensively about the Bidens and China.\n\nThe investment firm Hunter Biden operated (along with former-Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s stepson Chris Heinz and their family friend and operative Devon Archer) in his dealings with China was Rosemont Seneca Partners, which formed in 2009.\n\nBy 2010, Hunter Biden and Archer \u201cwere in China meeting with top Chinese officials,\u201d Schweizer wrote. By the way, Rosemont also partnered with the Thornton Group, which is led by James Bulger (the nephew of the infamous mobster James \u201cWhitey\u201d Bulger).\n\nIn 2013, Hunter Biden flew to China with his dad on Air Force Two. Within two weeks, Rosemont secured what eventually grew into a $1.5 billion private equity deal with a part of the Bank of China (which is owned by the Chinese Communist Party). So, as Schweizer put it, \u201cthe Chinese government-funded a business that it co-owned along with the son of a sitting vice president.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, Schweizer wrote that the Thornton Group only touted its China meetings on its Chinese language website, saying \u201cChinese executives \u2018extended their warm welcome\u2019 to the \u2018Thornton Group, with its US partner Rosemont Seneca chairman Hunter Biden (second son of the now Vice President Joe Biden).\u2019 The purpose of the meetings was to \u2018explore the possibility of commercial cooperation and opportunity.\u2019\n\nOne of these meetings between Hunter Biden\u2019s company and Chinese officials happened on the same day Vice President Biden met with then-Chinese President Hu Jintao in Washington as part of the Nuclear Security Summit. And this was the rule rather than the exception.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nSchweizer pointed out several more instances where Vice President Biden\u2019s official business intersected with Hunter Biden\u2019s private business. As he pointed out:\n\nTwelve days after Hunter flew on Air Force Two to Beijing, Rosemont and the Bank of China entered \u201ca first-of-its-kind investment fund\u201d called Bohai Harvest RST (BHR).\n\nIn December 2014, the Chinese state-backed company Gemini Investments Limited made a $34 million investment into a fund managed by Rosemont.\n\nIn August 2014, Gemini Investments bought 75 percent of Rosemont Realty, a Rosemont Seneca sister company. The terms included a $3 billion commitment from the Chinese. The company then became Gemini Rosemont.\n\nFinally, On April 16, 2014, Archer met with Vice President Biden at the White House. Five days later, Joe Biden met Ukrainian officials in Kiev about a United States Agency for International Development program to help the Ukrainian natural gas industry \u2013 including the promise of $1 billion in the U.S. and International Monetary Fund aid for Ukraine\u2019s economy.\n\nOn April 22, 2014, Archer joined the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian natural-gas company.\n\nOn May 13, 2014, Hunter Biden\u2019s membership on the board was announced. \u201cNeither Hunter Biden nor Archer had any ground or experience in the energy sector.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAs Michael Kranish and David L. Stern wrote in The Washington Post on July 22, for more than 20 years, Hunter Biden\u2019s professional career has followed his father\u2019s political career, \u201cfrom Washington to Ukraine to China.\u201d\n\nSpeaker Pelosi has raised the correct standard that in America no one is above the law. However, the person who may be found guilty by that standard is former Vice President Biden.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM NEWT GINGRICH", "description": "When Speaker Pelosi declared this week that, \u201cno one is above the law\u201d her target was President Trump \u2013 but she did far more damage to former Vice President Joe Biden.", "authors": ["Newt Gingrich", "Former Speaker Of The U.S. House Of Representatives Newt Gingrich Is The Host Of The"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/25/694940094001_6089351816001_6089347117001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
