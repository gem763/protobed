Minor got Red Sox batter Chris Owings to pop up into foul territory for what would have seemingly been the second out of the inning.\n\nBRYCE HARPER'S WIFE REVEALS NATIONALS FANS WERE USING THEIR INFANT SON IN 'CLASSLESS' TRASH-TALKING\n\nMinor, catcher Jose Trevino and first baseman Ronald Guzman all ran toward the ball but no one caught it. Instead, Guzman allowed the ball to drop into foul territory and thus giving Minor another chance to reach the milestone as the at-bat against Owings was allowed to continue.\n\nMinor then struck out Owings for his 200th strikeout of the season \u2014 the first time in his career he reached the number. He told reporters after the game that he was yelling at Guzman to drop it.\n\n\u201cWe were yelling, telling him to drop it because there's going to be two strikes,\u201d Minor said. \u201cHe dropped it, and then he looked at me like, 'What? Why?' And then everybody started booing or whatever. I had to thank him for that, because [the fans] didn't understand.\u201d\n\nYANKEE PITCHER DOMINGO GERM\u00c1N ON LEAVE THROUGH WORLD SERIES AMID DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ALLEGATION\n\nRangers manager Chris Woodward said he didn\u2019t \u201clove\u201d that his players allowed the ball to drop.\n\n\u201cI didn't love the idea that we dropped the popup at the end,\u201d he said. \u201cBut on the other side of that, they swung at three pitches in a row in the eighth inning down by two. If they have any beef with that, obviously I'm pretty sure [Red Sox manager Alex] Cora did, they chose to not try and win the game as well. They were trying to keep him from striking a guy out.\u201d\n\nWoodward added that Guzman was lucky Minor struck Owings out because it was \u201cborderline crossing the line.\u201d\n\nCora didn\u2019t comment on the play only saying, \u201cI'm just happy our guys are playing the right way.\u201d\n\nRed Sox beat writers and fans were not happy about the play.\n\nNonetheless, the Rangers won the game 7-5.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTexas improved to 76-83 on the season while the defending World Series champions dropped to 83-76.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "It\u2019s almost unreal how a meaningless game at the end of September between two teams who are not going to the postseason can draw so much controversy.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is An Editor For Fox News.
