Was that in consultation with our great American ally?\" Cambon asked, to applause from some of the other delegates.\n\nHe was referring to President Donald Trump's abrupt decision to pull U.S. troops out of northeastern Syria, which was the catalyst for the Turkish offensive. Ankara views the YPG Kurdish militia in northern Syria as terrorists linked to a Kurdish insurgency being waged inside Turkey.\n\n\n\n\n\nTURKEY'S ROLE\n\nU.S. and Kurdish troops previously fought together against the Islamic State, and the Kurds have accused Trump of stabbing them in the back.\n\nCambon called on the North Atlantic Council, NATO's main decision-making body, to convene. He said it should \"speak loudly and clearly in defense of the values of democracy and peace that characterize NATO's work\".\n\nIn response, Stoltenberg reiterated that he had expressed his deep concerns during his meetings in Istanbul.\n\n\"The only way you can understand what is going on there is also to understand the important role Turkey has played,\" said Stoltenberg, a former Norwegian prime minister.\n\n\"Turkey is important for NATO. It has proven important in many ways, not least in the fight against Daesh. We have used, as NATO allies, the global coalition, all of us have used infrastructure in Turkey, bases in Turkey in our operations to defeat Daesh.\n\n\"And that's exactly one of the reasons why I'm concerned about what is going on now. Because we risk undermining the unity we need in the fight against Daesh.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Estelle Shirbon and Alistair Smout; Editing by Gareth Jones)", "description": "NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Monday defended his stance on Turkey's attack on Kurdish militants in northeastern Syria as he came under pressure from some members of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly to be tougher with Ankara.
