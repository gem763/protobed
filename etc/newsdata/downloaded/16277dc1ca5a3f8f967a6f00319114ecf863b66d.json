But, I find this sudden change in the attitude of U.S. President towards trade issue looks evident enough to remain only a cautious optimism about global economic prospects because equity investors still feel that an end to trade friction is far from certain. President Trump said on Wednesday - a day after a stinging rebuke to China for its trade practices - that Beijing wanted to make a deal \" very badly\". Secondly, the United States is imposing sanctions on certain Chinese entities for knowingly transferring oil from Iran, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in what he called fresh actions to intensify pressure on Iran.\n\nOn the other hand, in India, passenger vehicle sales in the three months to August were down by nearly 27% compared with the same period last year, the sharpest fall for at least 16 years. Falling sales have led to tens of thousands of layoffs by domestic motor manufacturers, parts makers and distributors, which are rippling through the rest of the economy and labor market. Lower sales will also translate into slower growth in the vehicle fleet and fuel consumption, especially gasoline, over the next year.\n\nSecondly, India's central bank has cut interest rates four times so far in 2019 and the union government has announced an ambitious package of corporate tax cuts to stimulate the economy. I find that until the demand side does not recover, the impact of boosting moves to increase sale will remain only futile attempts to boost the Indian economy.\n\nFinally, I conclude that the need of the hour is to keep a vigil eye over the movements of , which reflects the real impact of the changing geopolitical moves over the movements of global equity markets. I find that as the has futures expiry for September, on September 26th, 2019; volatility may remain on a higher scale till closing. I find that today\u2019s closing level of Nifty 50 and will definitely be a decisive juncture for further directional moves of Indian equity markets. No doubt that some sell-off may be seen during the last hour, before the closing of today\u2019s trading session.
