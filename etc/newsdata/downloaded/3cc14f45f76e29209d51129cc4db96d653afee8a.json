Mohammad Nawaz and Mohammad Rizwan, who was called into the squad for this series, might be slotted right back into the side. Apart from this, we can't expect too many changes to the combination which appeared in their last World Cup match in July. Mohammad Hafeez has been dropped from the squad as well while Shoaib Malik has retired.\n\nUnder-pressure Sri Lanka face a tough challenge\n\nWatch the experienced vs youth series of Pakistan vs Sri Lanka \ud83c\udfcf LIVE on SONY SIX & SONY SIX HD.\ud83d\udcfa\n\n.\n\n.#PAKvSL #SPNSports pic.twitter.com/DTHsqbDEgu \u2014 SPN- Sports (@SPNSportsIndia) September 27, 2019\n\nWith 10 key players not available for this tour, stand-in captain Lahiru Thirimanne will have a tough time choosing the first XI. Players like Danushka Gunathilaka, Sadeera Samarawickrama, Aviskha Fernando, Dasun Shanaka will have to play a key role if Sri Lanka aspires to win this series.\n\nThe only uncapped player in the side is Minod Bhanuka, but he might not get an opportunity straight away.\n\nInterestingly, the last ODI played on this ground was also between these two teams way back in 2009. Sri Lanka were the victors on the occasion. Considering the past records of this ground, the pitch is good for batting but there is often something for the bowlers as well. We can expect a good match of Cricket with a balance between the ball and the bat.", "description": "SLRC (Channel Eye) is the official broadcaster of the series in Sri Lanka.
