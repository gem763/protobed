To ensure that anyone who needs to use a period product feels comfortable in doing so with Always, we updated our pad wrapper design. Our mission remains to ensure no girl loses confidence at puberty because of her gender or period and we do this through our puberty education programs, by providing access to period products with programs such as #EndPeriodPoverty, and by using our brand voice to tackle societal barriers and stigmas like we did with #LikeAGirl.\n\nHowever, feminist campaigner Julie Bindel said removing the symbol from the packaging is essentially \u201cdenying the existence of women\u201d and wrote Monday that she is upset by the company\u2019s decision to do so:\n\nI wrote this. I am VERY angry today: By caving into trans activists, Always have eliminated women https://t.co/JqNbKqNht2 via @TeleWonderWomen \u2014 Julie Bindel (@bindelj) October 21, 2019\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re now moving towards the total elimination of women\u2019s biology,\u201d she commented. \u201cThe women\u2019s symbol has been used by feminists for decades. This is pure cowardice and virtue signalling from these big corporate brands who are capitulating to the trans agenda.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, Always tweeted that it was proud to take part in \u201cNational Period Day\u201d which feminists hoped would raise awareness of so-called \u201cperiod poverty\u201d:\n\nHappy #NationalPeriodDay! We\u2019re excited to join forces with @periodmovement to continue raising awareness of the need for access to period products and #MenstrualEquity!
