Rich Froning and Scott Panchik will take on the opening workout, for bragging rights and to set the tone in the competition, at the Rogue Iron Game show in Austin, Texas, 6:30pm Central Standard Time.\n\nThe Open is an online competition. CrossFit will release a weekly workout for five weeks. Participants complete the exercises and upload their scores. The score measurements depend on the workout \u2013 for example, they can be as many rounds as possible in a given time, or quickest to finish a particular circuit. The top athletes video themselves as proof of their score.\n\nThe winner earns a place at the CrossFit Games.\n\nFroning and Panchik will kick off the competition, but who is favourite?\n\nFroning\u2019s packed trophy cabinet\n\nThe American is the king of the sport. He won four CrossFit Games titles from 2011 to 2014, a feat only matched by Mat Fraser when he won his fourth title at the 2019 Games. Froning, 32, then turned his attention to team competitions. Froning and his team, Mayhem Freedom, won four titles from 2015 to 2019, and finished second in 2017.\n\nFroning has an equally impressive pedigree in the Open, having finished first in 2012, 2013 and 2014. In 2015, he went head to head with Mat Fraser in a similar set up to Thursday\u2019s battle with Panchik and won. Froning lost to Fraser the following year, marking his one and only live Open announcement loss.\n\nPanchik the underdog\n\nPanchik, 31, has a wealth of experience but is still the underdog. He has eight Games appearances to his name. He finished fourth in 2012, 2013 and this year. He\u2019ll be hoping he can build on his 2019 results to take down the king.\n\nPanchik and Froning\u2019s last two Open results have been similar. The former finished 13th and 11th in 2018 and 2019 respectively. Froning was 10th both times, so it could prove a close contest.\n\nRumours are flying around that Panchik could be in line to join Froning\u2019s Mayhem Freedom team \u2013 maybe this is his final test.\n\nJustin LoFranco wrote in CrossFit blog Morning Chalk Up: \u201cScott Panchik had another great individual performance at the 2019 CrossFit Games, finishing in 4th overall. Regardless, given Froning\u2019s Open track record, in particular, I just don\u2019t see it happening for Panchik.\u201d\n\nFans love an upset \u2013 but one seems unlikely on Thursday.", "description": "The CrossFit competition is opening with a bang, as four times Games winner takes on one of the most consistent athletes in the sport", "authors": ["Mark Agnew"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/10/489585aa-eb34-11e9-9e8e-4022fb9638c4_image_hires_174927.JPG?itok=sUvF-wlJ&v=1570700972", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
