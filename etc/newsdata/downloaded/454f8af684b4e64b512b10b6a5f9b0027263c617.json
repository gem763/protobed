You don't have to put the stylus down to operate the iPad, either \u2014 you can tap it on the screen to start apps, and drag things around with the tip of the stylus.\n\nNot all iPads work with the Apple Pencil, however, and in fact there are two different pencil models \u2014 the original round stylus, and the newer Apple Pencil that has a flat edge.\n\nThis can be confusing, especially since some of the latest iPad models only work with the older Pencil.
