Sign up for the Today\u2019s WorldView newsletter.\n\n\n\n(Munir Uz Zaman/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 About two years ago, Bangladesh let in some 750,000 Rohingya people fleeing a military-led campaign of ethnic cleansing on the other side of the border. Authorities in Myanmar view the Rohingya, a predominantly Muslim minority, as interlopers and noncitizens \u2014 a position largely rejected by the international community. Marooned in squalid camps, the Rohingya in Bangladesh face a hopeless situation. Do they contemplate returning home to a country where their political rights will not be guaranteed and threats of violence remain? Or do they remain in limbo in the camps, eking out a bleak existence in a country that is straining under their presence?\n\nIn her speech last week from the dais of the U.N. General Assembly, Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said the international community must \u201cunderstand the untenability\u201d of the status quo. Her nation, she added, is dealing with \u201ca crisis which is Myanmar\u2019s own making.\u201d\n\nHasina is sympathetic to the Rohingya plight. \u201cIt\u2019s a big burden for Bangladesh, no doubt about it. But what they faced was almost some kind of genocide,\u201d she told Today\u2019s WorldView at a midtown hotel in Manhattan on Friday, referring to the violence meted out on Rohingya communities in 2017. \u201cKilling, torturing, arson, rape, so many things happened. They were bound to run away from their country for their safety and security.\u201d\n\nAlthough there have been agreements with Myanmar, also known as Burma, to repatriate small numbers of refugees, the overwhelming majority are too afraid to return. Rohingya rights advocates say the refugees fear returning to a precarious state in Myanmar, where they could be vulnerable to attacks from the sort of pro-government vigilante mobs and military forces who razed their villages and murdered and raped their loved ones.\n\nThey demand a guarantee of citizenship from state authorities, something the government of Myanmar is hardly willing to oblige. A citizenship law enacted in 1982 stripped the Rohingya of the same privileges and citizenship rights of other ethnic minority groups in the country. Officials in Myanmar cast the Rohingya as a \u201cBengali\u201d population and describe the violent campaign in 2017 as a counterterrorism operation against dangerous insurgents in Rakhine state, which borders Bangladesh.\n\n'We've seen Myanmar could not win Rohingya's trust in creating a conducive situation (in Rakhine) for their dignified return,' says Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. https://t.co/1AS1Hu5k6W \u2014 Rappler (@rapplerdotcom) September 12, 2019\n\nOthers are not so convinced. \u201cThe Myanmar government are unaffected and maintain that these were efforts to fight terrorists,\u201d lamented Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad at the United Nations last week. \u201cThis is what we are disappointed with, because we know that what is truly happening is a genocide.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not exactly hyperbole. A recent U.N.-commissioned report warned that the same violent conditions that provoked the 2017 exodus persist in Rakhine state. \u201cThere is a strong inference of genocidal intent on the part of [Myanmar\u2019s government], there is a serious risk that genocidal actions may recur, and Myanmar is failing in its obligation to prevent genocide, to investigate genocide and to enact effective legislation criminalizing and punishing genocide,\u201d the report concluded.\n\nOn the sidelines of U.N. meetings last week, the top U.S. official for foreign aid, Mark Green, spoke to ABC News about what he saw on a fact-finding trip to western Myanmar and the refugee camps in Bangladesh: \u201cI\u2019ll never forget this: A young Rohingya father looked me in the eyes and said, \u2018There are no teachers; my kids can\u2019t go to school. We don\u2019t have a mosque, so we can\u2019t worship. I\u2019m not allowed to leave without written permission, which I never get. And the only food I\u2019ve got is what you give me. What do I tell my kids?\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cMyanmar has done nothing to dismantle the system of violence and persecution and the Rohingya who remain in Rakhine live in the same dire circumstances that they did prior to the events of August 2017,\u201d Yanghee Lee, the U.N. special rapporteur on Myanmar, told reporters earlier this month.\n\nThe situation in Bangladesh is also grim. Hasina said that what is now her country\u2019s burden could turn into a regional crisis. An increasingly disaffected, jobless refugee population is ripe for radicalization and extremism, she said. \u201cIf they stay longer, very easily they can be converted or join\u201d militant groups, Hasina said.\n\nHer government confirmed new measures last week to build barbed-wire fences around Rohingya camps and to patrol their perimeters. Bangladeshi authorities already have cut Internet and cellphone access to the Rohingya and, in some instances, confiscated smartphones and SIM cards from refugees. It also plans to relocate possibly tens of thousands of refugees to large facilities erected on a low-lying silt island off the Bangladeshi coast known as Bhashan Char, which critics fear could be subject to flooding and other natural disasters.\n\nA statement this month from Human Rights Watch warned that such moves \u201cmade matters worse by imposing restrictions on refugee communications and freedom of movement.\u201d The organization earlier this year cited a local journalist who described the operation at Bhashan Char as potentially a kind of \u201cprison.\u201d\n\nHasina balked at the \u201ctalk\u201d from nongovernmental organizations and international agencies and said her government is acting in the interests of the refugees\u2019 \u201csafety and security.\u201d She pointed to reports of girls and young women falling prey to illicit human-trafficking networks that have reached into the ramshackle camps, home to more than 1 million Rohingya refugees.\n\n\u201cThrough these mobile phones, they are doing drugs business, arms business, even women and child trafficking,\u201d Hasina said.\n\nThe Bangladeshi prime minister says the Rohingya are welcome to stay for now. \u201cThey are in my soil,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat else can we do?\u201d\n\nShe said she hopes the international community can apply more pressure on her neighbor. \u201cThe problem with Myanmar is that they don\u2019t listen to anybody,\u201d she said. When asked what more can be done to squeeze Myanmar \u2014 including a possible arms embargo and tougher sanctions than those already imposed by the United States on the country\u2019s top brass \u2014 she demurred.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to fight with anybody. I want a peaceful solution, because they are my next door neighbor,\u201d Hasina told Today\u2019s WorldView. \u201cBut if the international community thinks that those kind of sanctions work, then fine, well and good. But I can\u2019t suggest that.\u201d\n\nHasina indicated that she has discussed the matter with Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel laureate and Myanmar\u2019s de facto civilian leader who has presided over the country\u2019s now-stalled democratic transition.\n\n\u201cShe blamed the military. She told me that the military doesn\u2019t listen to her that much,\u201d Hasina said, referring to a 2016 conversation at a regional summit hosted in India. Suu Kyi has since followed in lockstep with the country\u2019s military and refuses to even use the word \u201cRohingya\u201d to describe the ethnic group long persecuted by the central state in Rakhine.\n\n\u201cNow I can see she has changed her position,\u201d Hasina added.\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday, along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions?
