Next year we mark the 400th anniversary of the landing of the Pilgrims. In 2021, it\u2019s the 400th anniversary of the first Thanksgiving.\n\nWe\u2019re four years away from the 250th anniversary of the Boston Tea Party. A little more than five years away from the 250th anniversary of those first shots heard \u2019round the world at Lexington and Concord. And about six years away from the 150th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.\n\nThose of us around in 1976 remember the Bicentennial of the Declaration. It was a grand celebration of parades, flags, fireworks and tall ships. Given the mood of the country today, we have to wonder: What kind of celebrations are we now headed for?\n\nON THE FOURTH OF JULY, WE CELEBRATE THE UNIQUENESS OF AMERICA -- DEFINED IN THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE\n\nWe got a good hint from The New York Times this year with the publication of its 1619 Project, which aims to \u201creframe U.S. history by marking the year when the first enslaved Africans arrived on Virginia soil as our nation\u2019s foundational date.\u201d It is full of assertions such as \u201ca re-education is necessary\u201d and \u201cif you want to understand the brutality of American capitalism, you have to start on the plantation.\u201d\n\nThe 1619 Project has a school curriculum which, in the hands of good teachers, can make for some thought-provoking lessons. But in the end, it distorts the nation\u2019s history by focusing almost exclusively on its sins.\n\nAmerican history is the story of a great people who time and again have managed to save themselves and others, to correct wrongs, and to preserve what is still the world\u2019s last best hope.\n\nFor decades now, this has been a problem with many textbooks and social studies lessons. They tend to highlight the bad \u2013 obsessing on blemishes, failings, and atrocities \u2013 and go light on the good. The goal, it seems, is to teach that there is nothing exceptional about our country. In fact, the message is that American turns out to be a pretty lousy place.\n\nSo it\u2019s not hard to imagine comments from elites in the media and academia during the coming anniversaries. The Boston Tea Party patriots who disguised themselves as Mohawk Indians were appropriating a culture they ravaged. The authors of the Declaration of Independence were rich white men who were greedy for their own liberty but intent on oppressing everyone else.\n\nHere\u2019s an old-fashioned but much-needed proposal: Let\u2019s not be shy about actually celebrating this country\u2019s history and its greatness. Yes, study and understand the times we\u2019ve failed, sometimes badly. But enough of this running down the country again and again. It\u2019s tearing us apart.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nHow about if, in teaching American history, we start with President Abraham Lincoln\u2019s great assertion that this country is the \u201clast best hope of Earth\u201d?\n\nHow about if we explain that ours was the first nation in history created out of the belief that people should govern themselves? That twice in the 20th century, the U.S. led the way in saving the world from tyranny \u2013 first from the Axis powers, then from Soviet totalitarianism? That over the decades, American capitalism has lifted millions from poverty?\n\nHow about helping students understand that in those times when we fell short of our ideals \u2013 such as when we failed to eliminate slavery at the nation\u2019s founding \u2013 Americans of all backgrounds and races worked hard to prod our consciences and make us live up to those ideals, however belatedly?\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nYes, teach about the history of racism and oppression. But that is not the beginning or the center of the American story. To try to make it so is dishonest and an injustice to our students.\n\nAmerican history is the story of a great people who time and again have managed to save themselves and others, to correct wrongs, and to preserve what is still the world\u2019s last best hope. It is one of the most magnificent stories since the dawn of civilization. Let\u2019s take pride and celebrate it together as we observe some momentous anniversaries in 2020, 2026 and beyond.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY BILL BENNETT", "description": "Study and understand the times America has failed, sometimes badly.
