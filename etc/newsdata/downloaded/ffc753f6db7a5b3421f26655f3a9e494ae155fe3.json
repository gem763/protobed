Because it's so impractical. I don't know how you'd even do it. It would be such a rallying cry for people that say they're overstepping their bounds,\" Bloomberg said.\n\n\"That is not the way to win this issue,\" he continued. \"First thing, AK-47s should not be in the hands of individuals. They are guns built, not [for] hunting, they're guns built to kill the maximum number of people as quickly as you can, and we shouldn't have them.\"\n\nBloomberg said Democrats should instead focus on going after the gun manufacturers and passing universal background checks, \"but how you would go and get those back out \u2014 you might have an incentive program and maybe people would turn them in, but I don't even think that would happen.\"\n\nBloomberg continued to hit O'Rourke's plan as \"so impractical\" because \"people who have guns, tend to have lots of guns\" and calling for confiscation \"just isn't all that productive.\"\n\n\u201cHell yes, we're going to take your AR-15 and your AK-47,\u201d @BetoORourke has said.\n\n\n\nGun safety advocate @MikeBloomberg reacts: \"That's why I won't be the candidate of the Democratic Party....
