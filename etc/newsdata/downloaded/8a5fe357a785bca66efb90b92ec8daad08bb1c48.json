Using a large number of previously undiscovered weaknesses in the operating system, the malicious websites were able to gain near-total control of visiting devices without the users becoming aware, or having to do anything other than open the website in their browser.\n\nThe campaign was discovered by researchers at Google and shut down by Apple after the company was notified.\n\nEven before the Chinese link was reported, many researchers assumed the attack was a state-backed campaign, since the value on the open market of one \u201cno-click jailbreak\u201d \u2013 a vulnerability that can take control of a phone without user interaction \u2013 is more than $1m (\u00a3830,000).\n\nWhile the iOS attacks were the most noteworthy, the campaign also targeted more widely used devices, according to Thomas Brewster of Forbes.\n\n\u201cThat Android and Windows were targeted is a sign that the hacks were part of a broad, two-year effort that went beyond Apple phones and infected many more than first suspected,\u201d Brewster wrote.\n\n\u201cOne source suggested that the attacks were updated over time for different operating systems as the tech usage of the Uighur community changed.\u201d", "description": "Android and Windows devices also targeted in campaign believed to be state-backed", "authors": ["Alex Hern"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79cf20dcde3abe54b45ca98c311fdb3da273db1b/0_130_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bb043e734e612a382a21d057991c1fcf"}
