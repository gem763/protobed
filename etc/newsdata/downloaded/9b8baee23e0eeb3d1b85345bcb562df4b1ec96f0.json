It would require 20 Republicans to side with Democrats in convicting Mr. Trump, and few observers believe that will happen.\n\nMr. McConnell, his allies said, regards the impeachment fight in much the same way as he did the struggle last year to confirm Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, in which he was primarily concerned with protecting his Senate majority by insulating vulnerable incumbents. Then, as now, they said, Mr. McConnell is focused on keeping Republicans as united as possible, while allowing those with reservations about Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct and their own political considerations to justify their decision to their constituents.\n\n\u201cI think he will play it straight,\u201d said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas and a close McConnell ally, who noted his party\u2019s narrow voting margin. \u201cI don\u2019t think he has any alternative. When you are operating with 53 you have thin margins and you can\u2019t jam anybody or you end up with undesirable consequences.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Us Politics Mcconnell-Impeachment-Senate.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
