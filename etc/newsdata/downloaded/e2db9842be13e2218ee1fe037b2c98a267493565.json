Researchers speculated that, ironically, these costs might be resulting from insurance companies\u2019 attempts to lower waste. Does such high waste mean our health care system broken? Can we fix it? And most of all, have our attempts at fixing it made things worse?\n\nSTOCK PHOTO/Getty Images\n\nAdministrative complexities wasted $265 billion annually, the report said. Administrative complexities refer to behind-the-scenes administrative tasks, such as billing, completed by physicians and insurance companies. Government agencies and insurance companies mandate many of these tasks.\n\n\u201cIn payers\u2019 [insurance companies, Medicare, Medicaid] attempts to lower costs with measures like requiring prior authorizations for certain medications or procedures, there has actually been an increase in costs on the providers\u2019 [physicians, nurse practitioners] side,\u201d Dr. William Shrank, Chief Medical Officer at Humana and lead author of the study, told ABC News.\n\nThus there has been a mismatch between insurance companies and health care providers on what will actually decrease costs. This discrepancy has increased waste.\n\nThe second-highest category of waste was the high prices of medications, lab tests, imaging, and office visits, which led to $240 billion in waste. Study authors commented that prices are much higher than they need to be due to a lack of transparency and competitive markets in US health care. To this, Shrank states, \u201cNo single policy change will address this. We need a thoughtful policy approach to allow the market to function competitively.\u201d\n\nWhile the results may seem dismal, the study offers an optimistic outlook. In addition to the loss of money, researchers found potential opportunities for saving.\n\nInterventions to decrease hospital-acquired infections and ensure that people have outpatient treatment set up before they leave the hospital already occur. They can be further optimized to reduce waste. Integration of behavioral and physical health, disease prevention initiatives, and expansion of hospice access can also help. The study estimated $191 to $282 billion in potential savings.\n\nShrank is hopeful about the state of the health care system. \u201cConsidering that we have so many good things in our health care system, if we take a more active role to eliminate waste, address affordability, and improve care, we don\u2019t need to fundamentally disrupt the health care system,\u201d he said.\n\nDr. Saumya Bhutani is a resident in psychiatry in New York working with the ABC News Medical Unit.", "description": "The highest burden of waste came from administrative costs.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/medical-waste-stock-gty-jef-191018_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
