Their ominous relationship is undeniable.\n\nFactSet, UBS\n\n\"Most importantly, perhaps, is that this has been the point where the equity market moves into what we call the Risk-Aversion phase of the equity cycle,\" the UBS strategists said.\n\nTrahan and Blackman refer to this transition as the \"Grey Zone\" \u2014 otherwise known as a soft spot for equities when sentiment changes from a moderate risk-off to full-blown risk aversion. The last two times stocks dipped into \"grey\" territory was in 2000-2001 and 2007-2008. Those were two periods \u2014 the tech bubble and the financial crisis \u2014 that saw stocks get slaughtered.\n\nHowever, if there's a silver lining to the situation, it's that there's still time.\n\n\"Looking back at the last two times the equity market transitioned from Risk-Off to Risk-Aversion (i.e., the ISM crossed below 50) it is clear that it's not an \"on and off\" switch for equities,\" Trahan and Blackman said.\n\nBefore the Great Recession, it took around 5 months for S&P 500 to start its decline once ISM New Orders fell below 50.\n\nThe chart below depicts the lag between an ISM New Orders reading below 50 and a corresponding drop in the S&P 500.\n\nUBS\n\nThe S&P 500 fell even quicker in the midst of the tech bubble when the ISM broke below 50. Same scenario, quicker unwind.\n\nThe chart below depicts the 2 month span between a fall in ISM and a dramatic undoing of the S&P 500.\n\nUBS\n\nThe Fed's futility\n\nMany financial pundits have been comparing today's era to that of the 1990s \u2014 an age in which the Federal Reserve side-stepped a potential recession with timely interest rate cuts. In that time period, there was a strong inverse correlation between rate cuts and stock pricing. In other words, if the Fed moved rates lower, stocks would go higher.\n\nHowever, that relationship no longer exists today.\n\nIn today's market environment, following Fed rate cuts, stocks have moved lower in lockstep, leaving the US central bank powerless in the midst of a decline.\n\nThe charts below shows the correlation between Fed rate cuts and stocks in 1995 \u2014 a clearly inverse relationship \u2014 against today's highly-correlated connection.\n\nUBS\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Trahan and Blackman are skeptical at best in their equity outlook.\n\n\"Indeed, there are now 157 companies in the S&P 500 with negative forward earnings versus just 68 at the beginning of the year,\" they said. \"Moreover, the weakness of LEIs [leading economic indicators] in recent months suggests that the deterioration in earnings breadth will get worse from these levels.\"", "description": "UBS says stocks have entered a crucial period similar to the months preceding the Great Recession and Tech bubble.", "authors": ["Christopher Competiello"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d936ebd2e22af5e8f5cb5fc?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
