None Are Great", "language": "en", "text": "(Bloomberg) -- AT&T Inc. and activist investor Elliott Management Corp. seem to agree on one thing: DirecTV, the phone giant\u2019s shrinking satellite service, is a drag on the company. But solving the problem won\u2019t be easy.\n\nAT&T acknowledges the faster-than-predicted decline at DirecTV. But Randall Stephenson, chief executive officer and architect of the company\u2019s $48.5 billion purchase, sees the service as one of two key businesses -- the other being mobile phones -- that will allow the company to pipe entertainment and advertising to millions of customers.\n\nThe problem is that AT&T lost 2.3 million TV customers in the past year, and expects to lose up to 350,000 more this quarter, Chief Financial Officer John Stephens said at a Sept. 11 investor conference. The division, including the online streaming service DirecTV Now, is being sued for allegedly misleading investors about its subscriber numbers, and its value today is below what AT&T paid for the business four years ago.\n\nStephenson met with officials of Elliott Management on Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the matter. In a letter to AT&T last week, Elliott said it had acquired a $3.2 billion take in the phone company, highlighted areas for improvement and raised the possibility of divesting DirecTV.\n\nHere are some of the options that AT&T has for DirecTV, along with the pros and cons.\n\nDish Deal\n\nAT&T and Dish Network Corp. -- the other major satellite TV provider -- are suffering the steepest subscriber losses in the pay-TV industry. And in June they said they are open to a combination.\n\nBut the creation of pay-TV colossus with almost 30 million subscribers would almost certainly face regulatory opposition, even today when viewers have so many new options available, like Netflix and new streaming services from media giants including Walt Disney Co. and Comcast Corp.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s been tried from a regulatory perspective,\u201d Stephens said on Sept. 11. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been successful, and I don\u2019t know that there is any change in that regulatory perspective.\u201d\n\nStill, the rationale of pairing two declining businesses has its fans.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s complicated but not impossible,\u201d said Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst with New Street Research. \u201cOn the right terms, it could get financing.\u201d\n\nThere would be benefits to combining the businesses: With scale comes negotiating leverage, lower content costs and potentially lower overhead. The cash generation is attractive. And add a dynamic management team, and it could be run successfully, Chaplin said.\n\nBut there are also concerns: Depending on how a deal is structured, AT&T could lose a key distribution arm for its emerging media strategy and suffer a crippling loss of cash flow. DirecTV has $25.5 billion in annual revenue and generates about $4.5 billion in free cash flow, according to estimates by Walt Piecyk, an analyst at LightShed Partners LLC.\n\n\u201cMarkets always believed they bought this declining asset with steady cash flows as a stop-gap measure to strengthen their balance sheet and credit metrics,\u201d said Todd Lowenstein, managing director of Highmark Capital Management Inc.\n\nSpinoff or Sale\n\nAT&T could separate its TV business in a variety of other ways, including a sale to private equity investors or a spinoff to shareholders.\n\nThe proceeds of a sale could help AT&T reduce some of its $194.5 billion in total debt. That would provide the biggest boost to its credit rating, according to a report Friday from Neil Begley, a Moody\u2019s Corp. analyst.\n\nSimilarly, AT&T could distribute stock in DirecTV to its current shareholders via an an exchange offer. That would reduce AT&T\u2019s stock outstanding and trim its dividend burden, Begley wrote.\n\nAs part of such a transaction, DirecTV could also take on debt and pay AT&T a dividend to reduce its own borrowing and compensate for the loss of cash flow. Such an arrangement is \u201cprobably one of the more credit favorable ones after an outright sale,\u201d Begley said.\n\nAgain, with a deal AT&T would potentially lose a customer base for its advertising and media products. And even freed of DirecTV, the company will still have a lot on its plate. AT&T faces a heavy spending burden for 5G network expansion, its dividend and further debt reduction. The company\u2019s newly acquired WarnerMedia division is ramping up the production of movies and TV shows to support its new streaming efforts.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- AT&T Inc. and activist investor Elliott Management Corp. seem to agree on one thing: DirecTV, the phone giant\u2019s shrinking satellite service, is a drag on the company.
