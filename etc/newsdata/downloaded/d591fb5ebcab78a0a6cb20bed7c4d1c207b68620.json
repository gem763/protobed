We know that the EU want us to leave, we know that we have a deal that allows us to leave.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nUnsigned Brexit extension letter from Boris Johnson (Picture: Twitter/Donald Tusk)\n\nAnti-Brexit activists marched for a \u2018People\u2019s Vote\u2019 on Saturday as Parliament debated Brexit\u2019s next steps (Picture: Rex)\n\nHe added: \u2018We are going to leave by October 31. We have the means and the ability to do so and people who \u2013 yesterday we had some people who voted for delay, voted explicitly to try to frustrate this process and to drag it out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I think actually the mood in the country is clear and the Prime Minister\u2019s determination is absolute and I am with him in this, we must leave by October 31.\u2019\n\nMr Johnson got a senior diplomat to send an unsigned photocopy of a letter asking the EU for an extension on Saturday evening.\n\nIn a second note to European Council President Donald Tusk, the PM said the delay requested would be \u2018deeply corrosive\u2019.\n\nThe Prime Minister had been legally required to send the letter and stressed to Brussels he was only sending it at Parliament\u2019s bidding.\n\nBoris Johnson vows to press on despite losing a crunch vote on Brexit (Picture: AFP)\n\nShadow chancellor John McDonnell said the response from the PM could put him in contempt of Parliament over Brexit.\n\nMr McDonnell hit out at the way Mr Johnson distanced himself from a legally required request to the EU for a Brexit extension which he refused to sign.\n\nThe shadow chancellor accused the PM of \u2018behaving a bit like a spoilt brat\u2019 over the issue.\n\nHe told Sophy Ridge: \u2018Parliament made a decision, he should abide by it and this idea that you send another letter contradicting the first, I think it flies in the face of what both Parliament and the courts have decided.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
