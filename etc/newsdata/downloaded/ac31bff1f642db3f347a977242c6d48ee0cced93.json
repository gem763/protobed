Another pair was stuck in a Daytona Beach cove after Hurricane Dorian raised water levels. (iStock/iStock)\n\nFor days, the manatee and her young calf tried to get over the metal wall separating them from the open water. The pair had wound up on the wrong side of a marina barrier in Daytona Beach, Fla., after Hurricane Dorian raised water levels in the Halifax River, according to the Daytona Beach News-Journal. When the water receded, mother and baby discovered that they were trapped.\n\nBy Wednesday, six days after someone first spotted the stranded sea cows, officials with the city of Daytona Beach and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) had decided to launch a rescue mission. As spectators watched from lawn chairs and a TV news helicopter hovered over the city-owned Halifax Harbor Marina, a barge carrying a crane sidled up beside the barrier. Workers in safety vests spent hours removing a portion of the wall to give the manatees a way out. Late in the afternoon, FWC announced the two had swum to freedom.\n\n\n\nAuthorities spent hours trying to rescue two stranded manatees Wednesday. (Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission/Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission)\n\n\u201cIf they were two adult manatees, you could have up to a couple weeks,\u201d said aquatic biologist Patrick Rose, who serves as executive director of the nonprofit group Save the Manatee Club and watched the effort via a TV news live stream. \u201cBut with the calf, every day is important to get her back out and, of course, make sure that they stay together.\u201d\n\n[Someone impaled this sea turtle with a 3-foot spear. Rescuers want to know who.]\n\nFlorida\u2019s manatee population, once down to the hundreds, has rebounded over the past four decades \u2014 so much so that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 2017 downgraded the West Indian manatee from endangered to threatened. But conservationists and scientists including Rose criticized the move, saying the problems facing the state\u2019s estimated 6,300 manatees still remain, including algae blooms and scrapes with boats.\n\nThe Sunshine State employs five manatee rescue coordinators who spring into action when the beloved animals find themselves in trouble. Rescuers are on high alert when hurricanes and other types of weather bring higher-than-normal water levels, which often lead to manatees ending up in places they wouldn\u2019t typically be.\n\n\u201cWhen the water returns to normal levels, they can be trapped in there,\u201d FWC spokeswoman Michelle Kerr said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s really important for members of the public to keep an eye out for any unusual situations like this.\u201d\n\nThe manatee and her calf, which Rose estimated to be around 3 months old, were reported to FWC last Thursday. Authorities considered how to best free the two \u2014 a task that Kerr said was complicated by \u201csteep slopes, major depth and dangerous conditions for both the human rescue team and the manatees.\"\n\nCatching and manually lifting the manatees out of the cove would have been stressful to the animals and difficult for the humans because the mother weighs more than 1,000 pounds, according to the News-Journal. Removing part of the barrier wasn\u2019t exactly easy, either, the newspaper reported: The support piles extend more than 26 feet below the riverbed.\n\nAs authorities weighed the best course of action, locals watched the animals struggle to get out on their own. Janet Lynn, who lives in an apartment building near the marina, told the News-Journal she had seen the mother attempt to overcome the wall.\n\n\u201cShe just fell in the water after trying too hard,\u201d she said. \u201cThat baby was right next to her.\u201d\n\n[Are you smarter than a jellyfish? Then you should care about our oceans, an aquarium says.]\n\nOn Wednesday, the paper reported, a few hundred people watched the rescue attempt unfold. By midafternoon, the opening had been made, and rescuers were waiting to see whether the manatees would swim through it to freedom. No one saw their great escape, FWC marine mammal biologist Nadia Gordon said. But the rescuers waited 40 minutes to see if the mammals surfaced. When no manatee noses appeared, they grew confident the duo were free.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited the manatees were able to swim out to freedom,\u201d she said.\n\nIT'S HAPPENING! Workers removed the panels and now we are waiting to see if the adult #manatee & her calf will move through the new opening so they can swim freely into the river.

They are expected to be just fine. Still, the pair\u2019s plight seemed to strike a chord.\n\n\u201cWhat endeared them so much to me is they\u2019re an animal I just don\u2019t see [having] any capability of being aggressive in any way,\u201d Rose said. \u201cThey do well if left alone. Oftentimes those things that man has built and done create what has become traps for them. That\u2019s kind of what happened here.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\n\u2018Frozen dragon of the north wind\u2019 flew over North America 77 million years ago, scientists say\n\nEPA chief directs agency to dramatically reduce animal testing\n\nDangerous new hot zones are spreading around the world", "description": "Onlookers said the pair tried to escape on their own but couldn't.", "authors": ["Brittany Shammas", "September At Pm", "Brittany Shammas Is A General Assignment Reporter For The Washington Post.
