(Or, to put it another way, they are both the other Michelle Williams.) However, the differences between singer Michelle Williams of Destiny\u2019s Child fame and Fosse/Verdon star Michelle Williams are numerous enough that you\u2019d think most people could tell them apart most of the time. Not so for the trolls and fans who flooded singer Michelle Williams\u2019 social media accounts Monday following actress Michelle Williams\u2019 impassioned Emmys speech Sunday night. As Williams lamented on her Instagram stories: \u201cI\u2019m so sorry my namesake upset you, but can\u2019t you see that I\u2019m black?!\u201d\n\nIf the world wasn\u2019t a smoldering trash heap, the mix-up between the pair would result in, at worst, a few misplaced congratulations in the comment section. However, it is, so Michelle Williams has to field insults from confused trolls looking for Emmy-winner Michelle Williams to chide her for her speech\u2026 supporting women of color in the entertainment industry? \u201cI stand beside Michelle Williams on her speech, okay?\u201d said the singer. \u201cShe was beautiful, she was brilliant.
