Although the unemployment rate is still just 3.7% \u2014 near its 50-year low \u2014 monthly job growth has slowed to 158,000, compared with 223,000 a month a year ago. And the 130,000 jobs created in August failed to meet economists\u2019 expectations.\n\nThe overall slowdown in the U.S. economy, due to uncertainty over tariffs and trade policy, is prompting concerns about how much further things might decelerate in coming months.\n\n\u201cYou need to run scared. Push yourself hard.\u201d Carl E. Van Horn, director of the John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers University\n\nAlthough the Federal Reserve Board is likely to reduce the risk of recession by cutting its benchmark interest rate a quarter point at its meeting next week, that won\u2019t reassure many economy watchers. For instance, Ray Dalio, founder of the world\u2019s largest hedge fund, just told Bloomberg News that he sees a 25% chance of a U.S. recession this year and in 2020.\n\nWhat happened to older workers in the last recession?\n\nHere\u2019s why this matters so much to older workers: In the last recession, it took much longer for unemployed people over 50 to get hired, on average, than for younger people without jobs. What\u2019s more, the older ones were also more likely to become part of the long-term unemployed \u2014 out of work for six months or longer. And when they finally landed a job, their wages were typically much lower than in their previous one and below the level of their reemployed younger peers.\n\nAccording to the Urban Institute research report, Age Disparities in Unemployment and Reemployment during the Great Recession and Recovery, nearly half of people age 25 to 34 who lost their jobs during the 2007-09 recession were reemployed within six months. Yet it took more than nine months for half of the unemployed ages 51 to 60 to find work.\n\nAs the chart below indicates, long-term unemployed workers ages 51 to 60 also took a big hit to their monthly household income \u2014 a nearly 40% drop. That\u2019s larger than other age groups since the 50s are typically peak earning years.\n\nUrban Institute Urban Institute: \u201cFinancial Consequences of Long-Term Unemployment during the Great Recession and Recovery.\u201d Richard W. Johnson and Alice G. Feng. Brief #13, April 2013.\n\nWhat about the next recession?\n\nAnd for the next recession, whenever it may come\u2026?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not particularly optimistic that things will be better for older workers,\u201d says Richard Johnson, senior fellow at the Urban Institute and director of its program on retirement policy.\n\nWith good reason. A forthcoming article in Generations: Journal of the American Society on Aging will note that long-term unemployment has remained at heightened levels. More than one in four job seekers ages 55 and older had been unemployed for more than six months in March 2019, it says; for those 54 and younger, one in five were.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: This city\u2019s real estate market is the least likely to tank during the next recession\n\n\u201cThe labor market is brutal for older workers,\u201d says Carl E. Van Horn, director of the John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers University and co-author of the article with Maria Heidkamp, director of the New Start Career Network at the Heldrich Center.\n\nA combination of factors is at play. There\u2019s age discrimination by employers, of course, but also the toxic stigma that often attaches to the long-term unemployed. Dismissive phrases like \u201cThere must be something wrong with him\u201d or \u201cIt must be her fault she isn\u2019t working.\u201d\n\nBut, counters Van Horn, \u201cThese are people who are victims of acts of economic violence. There\u2019s no more reason to stigmatize them than people who drive Hondas.\u201d\n\nJob-protection advice for older workers\n\nSo what should you consider doing now to help protect yourself and your job when the recession arrives?\n\nAn intriguing suggestion comes from Robin Johnson, lead trainer at CareerForce, Minnesota\u2019s career development and talent matching resource. She says: Practice looking for a job, but not applying for jobs. The value of this exercise is it acquaints you with what employers are looking for in their job postings. The effort also helps you focus on where you might look for work should that become necessary.\n\nSee: Brace yourself: 10 steps to take now to prepare for the next recession\n\nAnother precautionary step: Pay increased attention to your network of colleagues, former workmates and acquaintances. Most job referrals these days come through personal networks and many people get hired after someone puts in a good word about them to the hiring employer.\n\nTroubled by high rates of joblessness among those 45 years and older, Van Horn and colleagues at the Heldrich Center created the New Start Career Network in 2015 for older unemployed New Jerseyans. The motivating idea was to see if providing digital and human job counseling in a cost-effective way would help the long-term unemployed get work. New Start Career Network\u2019s counselors are professional coaches volunteering their time.\n\n\u201cWe have concluded that it can be replicated,\u201d says Van Horn. \u201cIt is cost-effective. It supplements what is out there now.\u201d\n\nAmong the lessons Van Horn learned from the New Start Career Network: Once you lose your job, don\u2019t wait around to look for another. Try to avoid the unjust stigma faced by the long-term unemployed and get to work right away finding a new employer.\n\nSee: Age discrimination is still a major obstacle for older workers\n\n\u201cYou need to run scared,\u201d Van Horn says. \u201cPush yourself hard.\u201d\n\nJohnson echoes his advice. \u201cYou need to get serious,\u201d she says. \u201cNo one likes looking for work. It isn\u2019t fun. You need to show up for the process.\u201d\n\nTapping into your network immediately is critical. But Van Horn notes that this step is often easier said than done. Losing a job is traumatic and, with networking, you\u2019re supposed to openly tell people you\u2019re out of work and looking for employment.\n\nBut it can pay off.\n\nVan Horn tells the story of a lawyer he knows who was well-respected in the orthodox Jewish community and out of work. Van Horn asked him if he had talked to people in his temple. The man said he hadn\u2019t, and Van Horn implored him to start. \u201cI understand why he didn\u2019t do it,\u201d says Van Horn. \u201cBut he had to do it.\u201d\n\nAfter networking this way, the man got a job at a religious school.\n\nRelated: Absolutely no economic reason for a recession, but \u2018we\u2019ll probably have one anyway\u2019\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: The rise of the long-term unemployed doesn\u2019t reflect individual failings. Losing a job could happen to any of us. And the evidence is overwhelming that individuals are willing to do their part to get work. Society, however, needs to devote more resources keeping people attached to the job market and knocking down barriers of age discrimination.\n\nMeanwhile, put together your action plan.
