Trump\u2019s announcement that he would be pulling troops out of Syria was followed by another announcement that the United States would send 1,800 troops to Saudi Arabia. This weekend, U.S. Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper announced that the roughly 1,000 U.S. troops in Syria would be shifted to western Iraq.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Monday, Esper said that not all U.S. troops may be leaving Syria anyway. During a visit to Afghanistan, the secretary said that a residual force of U.S. troops may stay to guard oil fields from the Islamic State and others who could \u201cseek that revenue to enable their own malign activities.\u201d\n\nThis chaotic reshuffling of troops in the region comes amid considerable debate about their presence there at all. The practice has put not only the lives of Americans at risk in wars that often have no obvious benefit to the United States but has done little to calm things. Polls of U.S. veterans have shown that a majority believe U.S. military engagements in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria were not worth it.\n\nHowever, as Trump has shown, withdrawing troops from these countries can set back other priorities. In Afghanistan, where Esper announced Monday that troop numbers had quietly been scaled back by 2,000, talks with the Taliban have broken down \u2014 with the extremist organization effectively discovering that one of its key demands in negotiations is effectively happening anyway.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn Syria, the removal of support for Kurdish forces led to the military intervention of Turkey, the spread of influence from the Syrian government and Russia, and the potential for a group like the Islamic State to regroup. U.S. troops serving in Syria are \u201clivid\u201d about a cease-fire agreement touted by Trump, according to a senior official who spoke to The Washington Post on the condition of anonymity.\n\nTrump\u2019s words: Bring them home.\n\nTrump\u2019s action: Send them to Iraq. https://t.co/yMAoFVMejV \u2014 Justin Amash (@justinamash) October 20, 2019\n\nBut Trump\u2019s apparent desire for a smaller military footprint abroad, if not his methods, makes him some unlikely allies. During a debate among the Democratic candidates for the 2020 election last week, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) called for the United States to \u201cget out\u201d of the Middle East. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should have troops in the Middle East,\u201d she added.\n\nThough many Democrats are skeptical of U.S. intervention in the Middle East, Warren\u2019s comments were unusually forthright. Warren, who serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee and is the leading candidate in recent polls, has stated she would pull U.S. troops out of Afghanistan before a peace deal is reached.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHer ideas about the Middle East were criticized by her rival, former vice president Joe Biden, who suggested they are naive. \u201cI have never heard anyone say with any serious background in foreign policy, \u2018Pull all troops out of the Middle East,'\u201d Biden told reporters in Ohio on Wednesday.\n\nWarren\u2019s campaign tried to clarify the candidate\u2019s remarks in a subsequent statement that said she \u201cwas referencing combat troops, not those stationed in the Middle East in noncombat roles.\u201d Spokeswoman Alexis Krieg added that Warren \u201cbelieves we need to end the endless wars\u201d and wanted to \u201cresponsibly remove U.S. troops from combat in the Middle East.\u201d\n\nThe explanation belied the complexities of the U.S. presence in the Middle East. The United States has tens of thousands of troops stationed in the region who are not directly involved in conflict but certainly support conflicts, including those stationed in major (and expanding) air bases like Al Udeid in Qatar or the naval base in Bahrain.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt is not clear if Warren\u2019s standard would apply to the 5,200 troops in Iraq who support Iraqi security services but do not engage in direct conflict, the 1,000 troops in Syria who supported the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces or even the 1,800 troops heading to Saudi Arabia to help deter Iran and its proxies.\n\nBut the idea that the U.S. position in the Middle East needs rethinking does have cache. \u201cDoes anybody think that what we\u2019ve been doing for the past 20 years has actually been working?\u201d tweeted Ilan Goldenberg, Middle East security director at the Center for New American Security and a former State Department and Pentagon official.\n\nBefore Trump and Warren, President Barack Obama had his own ideas about bringing troops home. \u201cThe time has come for us to end this engagement in Iraq,\u201d he said on the campaign trail in Chicago in 2007. He said he was determined to bring troops home from Afghanistan before the end of his second term, and repeated the mantra that there was \u201cno military solution\u201d for disputes around the world.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile Obama did pull U.S. troops out of Iraq in 2011, he sent thousands back in 2014 as the Iraqi military crumbled under pressure from the Islamic State. Meanwhile, his plans to pull out of Afghanistan completely never came to pass. During his two terms, the United States conducted airstrikes or military raids on seven nations: Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria and Yemen.\n\nObama may have succeeded in ending U.S. involvement in the worst of the fighting, but he left troops deeply embedded in regional conflicts that proved just as hard to decisively end. Trump\u2019s complaints about U.S. military presence overseas appear far broader \u2014 he has taken aim at relationships like the basing of U.S. troops in South Korea, Japan and Germany \u2014 but also more contradictory.\n\nWhen American troops first arrived in North Syria, kurds received them as heroes with flowers and ululation.\n\n\n\nNow terrified Kurds in Syria are throwing tomatoes and stones at departing American forces.@akhbar pic.twitter.com/mRWJeZINBK \u2014 Jenan Moussa (@jenanmoussa) October 21, 2019\n\nOn Monday, the same day that U.S. troops pulled out of Syria as Kurds threw stones and rotten fruit at them, Trump warned that \u201cwe may have to get in wars, too\u201d and pointed toward ongoing tensions with Iran. \u201cIf Iran does something, they\u2019ll be hit like they\u2019ve never been hit before. I mean, we have things that we\u2019re looking at.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat muddled view only adds to the strains on America\u2019s military presence abroad. That presence has already sprawled further then imagined \u2014 one 2015 estimate puts it at 800 bases in 70 countries, far more than all other nations combined \u2014 because of a combination of the legacies of World War II, the Cold War, the war on terrorism, security interests of the host nations and even plain old mission creep.\n\nObama tried to solve the puzzle of U.S. troops locked in foreign wars, while Trump is hoping to ignore it. But for now, it still seems to be that keeping U.S. troops in the Middle East is proving far easier than bringing them home.\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday, along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions?
