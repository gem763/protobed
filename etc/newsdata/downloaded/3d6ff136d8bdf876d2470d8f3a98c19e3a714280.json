The group said each container holds enough supplies for the activists to remain at the site for several days.\n\nBanners read \u201cDeforestation made in France\u201d and French President \u201cEmmanuel Macron complicit\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe refinery at La Mede is a centre of deforestation imported into France, which imports 550,000 tonnes of palm oil per year, which corresponds to 64 percent of French consumption,\u201d Clement Senechal of Greenpeace France told AFP.\n\nWhen launching the La Mede biorefinery earlier this year Total pledged it would process no more than 300,000 tonnes of palm oil per year \u2014 less than half of the total volume of raw materials needed and that would be certified as being sustainable according to EU standards.\n\nIt said the certification ensured there had been no deforestation to produce the oil and would result in at least a 50 percent reduction in carbon emissions compared to fossil fuels.\n\nFrance\u2019s constitutional court earlier this month rejected a bid by Total to secure a tax break for using palm oil to create biofuel.\n\nFrench legislators in 2018 had excluded palm oil from biofuel inputs eligible for tax breaks.", "description": "La M\u00e8de (France) (AFP) \u2013 Greenpeace activists on Tuesday blocked the entrance to a refinery in southern France where oil giant Total uses", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/29/e9d46a_greenpeace-activists-blocked-entrance-total-biorefinery-in-la-mede-marseille-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
