There is no place for that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that laws in these other countries don\u2019t really accommodate what the United States has done about 230 ... it is just inappropriate right now to insert this liability protection into trade agreements, and as a member of the working group that is helping to negotiate that agreement, I am pushing hard to make sure that it just isn\u2019t there,\u201d she added.\n\nCommittee chairman Rep.
