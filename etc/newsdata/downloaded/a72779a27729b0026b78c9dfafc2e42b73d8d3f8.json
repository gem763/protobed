Turns out, he was right.\n\nChase Cord threw for 175 yards and three touchdowns in relief of injured starter Hank Bachmeier and No. 14 Boise State beat Hawaii 59-37.\n\nThe Broncos (6-0, 3-0 Mountain West) remained perfect at home against the Rainbow Warriors in seven meetings, despite losing Bachmeier early in the second quarter when he was scrambling for a first down and spun to elude oncoming linebacker Kana\u2019i Picanco.\n\nBachmeier absorbed a hit in his lower back and promptly fumbled. He walked gingerly off the field with the aid of staff trainers before going to the locker room. In the second half, he returned to the sidelines in street clothes.\n\n\u201c(Hank\u2019s injury) was something along the lines of a hip pointer,\u201d Harsin said after the game. \u201cHe got hit in the side and was out, and he was not going to go back in. At that point . we decided to just roll with Chase. He was already in the game plan with some packages. So we decided to give Hank a chance to rest up a bit. . He\u2019s going to be fine moving forward.\u201d\n\nWith Bachmeier out, Cord ensured that the Broncos\u2019 passing offense that ranks second in the conference didn\u2019t miss a beat, throwing TD strikes of 33, 42, and 8 yards and finishing with 12 for 18 passing.\n\nHawaii (4-2, 1-1), which entered the game with the Mountain West\u2019s top passing offense and fourth nationally, fell behind early and never seemed to have an answer defensively for any of the three quarterbacks Boise State played.\n\n\u201cThe defense played well in the first half but awful field position,\u201d Hawaii coach Nick Rolovich said. \u201cWe gave them some real short plays and they took advantage of it. Our defense didn\u2019t play nearly as poorly as the score indicated, but in the second half we gave up some really big plays that we uncharacteristic for us.\u201d\n\nDespite Cord\u2019s commanding presence, the Broncos mixed up the play calling, using five players at quarterback.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all intelligent enough to do that, so we\u2019re able to have a little bit of fun,\u201d Harsin said. \u201cEverything we\u2019re doing, it\u2019s about how we can get all these players involved.\u201d\n\nOne of those players was Boise State receiver John Hightower, who had seven catches for 141 yards and two touchdowns. He also ran a play with an option to pass.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough seeing somebody go down,\u201d Hightower said. \u201cBut all the quarterbacks are prepared and they know what they\u2019re doing. It\u2019s nice to see all of them make plays we already know what they\u2019re capable of making.\u201d\n\nJaylon Henderson also played significant time at quarterback as the Broncos\u2019 trio of signal callers combined for 315 yards passing.\n\nHawaii quarterback Cole McDonald threw for 251 yards and three touchdowns, moving past Garrett Gabriel for fifth place on the school\u2019s career passing yardage list.\n\nSTATS THAT MATTER\n\nIn the first half, Boise State\u2019s average starting field position was its own 47, aided by three fumbles.\n\nHawaii finished with four turnovers, which proved costly in the second quarter when Boise State blew open a tight game to take command.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nHawaii: The Rainbow Warriors raised some eyebrows early with wins over Pac-12 foes Arizona and Oregon State but fell flat against another Top 25 opponent. The last time Hawaii beat a ranked team was Nevada in 2010. If Hawaii intends to rekindle its glory from earlier the past decade, it needs to find a way to beat one of the country\u2019s top teams.\n\nBoise State: The Broncos played their most complete game of the season, and did so without Bachmeier for most of the contest. That\u2019s exactly the kind of performance Boise State coach Bryan Harsin has been pleading for from his team, and the type of play it will need if the Broncos intend to stay in the driver\u2019s seat for a New Year\u2019s Six bowl game berth among the Group of 5 schools.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nBoise State could possibly move up after a couple losses by teams above the Broncos.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nHawaii returns home next Saturday to face Air Force.\n\nBoise State will take a break from conference play next week and hit the road for a game with burgeoning regional rival BYU.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "After holding a competitive contest for the starting quarterback job, Boise State coach Bryan Harsin has insisted that the Broncos are well stocked at the position.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jason Chatraw"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/13/hawaii_boise_st_football_93413_c0-151-3615-2259_s1200x700.jpg?937da9677b4bb5e1da1bd63dfd761e68aac4bc62", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
