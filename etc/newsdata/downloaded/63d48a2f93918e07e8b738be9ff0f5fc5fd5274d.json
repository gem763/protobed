At the time, Brunel had just been the subject of a 60 Minutes documentary accusing him of drugging and raping at least three models. Later, he would be accused by two women of supplying girls to Epstein to be sexually abused. (Brunel has denied the allegations.)\n\nRecords accessed by The Daily Beast list Mnuchin as the New York Department of State process for Next Management Corporation. According to department officials, the DOS process is the person who files a company\u2019s registration papers and receives lawsuits and other official documents on their behalf\u2014usually a lawyer or some other legal representative.\n\nA Treasury Department official said Mnuchin did not know he was listed as the DOS Process for Next Management Corp. before The Daily Beast\u2019s inquiry. He said it was \u201cnot clear\u201d how Mnuchin wound up serving in that role, and added that the Secretary not recall ever meeting either Brunel brother and has never done business with either of them.\n\nMnuchin\u2019s office did confirm that he was longtime friends with Faith Kates, the owner of Next modeling agency. The Brunel brothers co-founded the Next agency with Kates in 1989, and their company, Next Management Corp. owned a 25 percent stake in the agency for several years. The address listed under Mnuchin\u2019s name in State Department records is the first address for Kates\u2019 company, Next Management Company.\n\nModels Say Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s Closest Pal Drugged, Raped Them\n\nJeffrey Epstein\u2019s Modeling Ties Go Much Deeper Than Victoria\u2019s Secret\n\nReached by The Daily Beast, Kates denied any involvement with setting up Next Management Corporation, and said she had nothing to do with Mnuchin serving as the DOS process.\n\n\u201cMs. Kates was never involved with Next Management Corp. in any way,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cGiven that, she never designated anyone, including Sec. Mnuchin, to be a DOS process or any officer or director of Next Management Corp.\u201d\n\nThe spokesperson added that Kates\u2019 agency sued Next Management Corp. 25 years ago, over allegations that the Brunel brothers had \u201craided\u201d the agency, and said Kates has not had any contact with them since then. She said Kates had \u201cno knowledge\u201d of why her company\u2019s address was listed in official records for Next Management Corp.\n\nKates has her own connections to Epstein, as The Daily Beast previously reported. Former employees say the financier regularly dropped in on the agency\u2019s New York offices, and tax filings show he donated tens of thousands of dollars to charities connected to Kates and her family. At least two former Next models have been romantically linked to Epstein, and a third appears in his infamous address book.\n\nA spokesperson for Kates said neither she nor the Next agency had any business or financial ties to Epstein, and that Kates never introduced the financier to any models.\n\nMnuchin has been friends with Kates for approximately 30 years, according to the Treasury Department official, and once helped Kates set up a business \u201cas a friend.\u201d A spokesperson for Kates confirmed the two had been friendly for decades. She said Munchin had offered Kates business advice when she started Next Management Company, and served as her real estate broker.\n\nMnuchin\u2019s spokesperson said the Secretary had no ownership in any of Kates\u2019 businesses or served them in any business capacity.\n\nThe Daily Beast was unable to reach Jean-Luc or Arnaud Brunel for comment. The ties between Jean-Luc Brunel and Epstein, however, have been widely reported. Flight records show Brunel flew on the financier\u2019s private plane more than 20 times between 1999 and 2005, and house staff said in depositions that the modeling agent was a regular presence at Epstein\u2019s Palm Beach estate. When Epstein was arrested in 2008, Brunel visited him nearly 70 times in jail.\n\nOne of Epstein\u2019s first public accusers, Virginia Roberts (now Giuffre), claimed Epstein forced her to sleep with Brunel and many other powerful men in the years he kept her as his \u201csex slave.\u201d She also accused Brunel of using his modeling industry connections to supply Epstein and other wealthy men with foregin girls to abuse.", "description": "Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/Photos Getty/HandoutIn the late 1980s\u2014before he was a member of Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet, or even a high-rolling hedge fund manager\u2014Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin served in an official capacity for a business run by one of Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s most infamous associates", "authors": ["Emily.Shugerman Thedailybeast.Com", "Emily Shugerman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MhjjzLR5Nl9Q3wQdbgtgsw--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/42384f33ba55a33570be04107b15809e", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
