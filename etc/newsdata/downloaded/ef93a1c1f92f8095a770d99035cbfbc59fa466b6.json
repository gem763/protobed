Improvements have increased both quality of life and life expectancy, alongside which, unmet needs emerge. Cancer epitomizes this challenge. While enormous strides have been made, it is one of the most significant health challenges we face in the 21st century,[i] and it continues to place a heavy burden on those affected.\n\nA newly published report, Supporting Women With Cancer, shows women living with cancer often face challenges for which support is sorely lacking, whether from their employer, or at home managing family or caregiving responsibilities. Many of the women surveyed perceived themselves to be stigmatized more than men by their disease. Women of childbearing age also reported that they aren\u2019t always being offered fertility advice, which is so important when making treatment and life decisions following a diagnosis.\n\nEvery woman should have access to care, feel supported, empowered with information and reassured that they are not alone on this journey, regardless of where they live or their socio-economic status.\n\nThere needs to be a shift in the way we support and empower women living with the life-changing burden of cancer. Every woman should have access to care, feel supported, empowered with information and reassured that they are not alone on this journey, regardless of where they live or their socio-economic status.\n\nWomen living with cancer speak out\n\nThrough a survey we conducted with 4,585 women across 23 countries, we identified three core areas where there is a need for the cancer community to take action.\n\nAn urgent priority is to increase awareness of the services available for women looking for financial, emotional, employment or fertility support to ensure they can maintain their daily activities following a cancer diagnosis.\n\nOnly 20 percent of the women surveyed believed they received enough support to manage their family responsibilities or fit work around their condition. A further 34 percent reported receiving no support at all from their employer following their diagnosis and, in lower-middle income countries, 74 percent of women believed that cancer and its treatment had impacted their personal finances. To enhance the lives of women living with cancer, we need to identify areas where more support services may be required or raise awareness of the options available, so that women can receive the help they need.\n\nAn essential action is to improve the awareness of and access to cancer screening programs to facilitate earlier diagnosis of cancer in women.\n\nOf the women surveyed, 47 percent had never attended a cancer screening program. The three most significant reasons included: not taking their symptoms seriously (52 percent); fearing a diagnosis (38 percent); and delaying a visit to a health care professional due to cost (29 percent). Women aged 18-40 were more likely to face delays in diagnosis (49 percent) compared to other age groups. This was mainly due to not taking their symptoms seriously (43 percent). Some women are underestimating the risks associated with cancers that are not widely considered \u2018women\u2019s cancers\u2019, such as lung and colorectal cancer.\n\nWhile screening programs will differ from country to country and cancer types, the number of women not participating in screening programs is too high everywhere. It\u2019s critical we do more to improve screening efforts and uptake to ensure women living with cancer have the best chance of survival.\n\nWe need to help women recognize and take seriously the signs, symptoms and risk factors of cancer.\n\nOnly 45 percent of women surveyed reported they were aware of cancer signs and symptoms before receiving their diagnosis. Older women, and women living in lower- and upper-middle income countries, were found to be less aware prior to their diagnosis, compared to those in high-income countries. This suggests a greater focus is needed, globally, to improve women\u2019s understanding and recognition of the signs, symptoms and risk factors of all cancers, and particularly those of high risk in women.\n\nIt\u2019s time we put women first\n\nSupporting women living with cancer is one of the most significant public health challenges we face. Finding solutions to turn the insights of the report into meaningful outcomes for women living with cancer will be critical to improving their quality of life. To achieve this, we must work collectively \u2014 across governments, the private sector, non-governmental organizations and patient advocacy groups \u2014 to make sure women feel supported. Only together can we drive better outcomes for women.\n\nFinding solutions to turn the insights of the report into meaningful outcomes for women living with cancer will be critical to improving their quality of life. To achieve this, we must work collectively.\n\nAbout Supporting Women With Cancer\n\nThe Supporting Women With Cancer report is based on a survey, supported by Merck and designed with input from the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC), of 4,585 women across 23 countries.\n\nThis research, aimed at understanding the unique challenges that women living with cancer face across the globe, is part of Merck\u2019s commitment to the Healthy Women, Healthy Economies initiative. Healthy Women, Healthy Economies is a global initiative that convenes multisector stakeholders to address women\u2019s health so they, and their families, can thrive in their communities and live better lives. Health and prosperity are intertwined for women and that is why Merck is committed to doing its part by generating knowledge through research, forming meaningful collaborations, advocating for change and living the mission through our internal, company commitments.\n\nFor more information, read the full report and its recommendations here.\n\n[i] World Cancer Research Fund.
