Past trends, however, suggest that ebbs in migration patterns will be difficult to sustain in the face of ongoing violence and poverty in Central America.\n\nThough the number of arrests at the southern border has plunged nearly 60 percent since a 12-year high in the spring, experts said the progress has been built on potentially unreliable tools that could prove temporary \u2014 including increased cooperation from the governments in Mexico and Guatemala and court rulings.\n\n\u201cThe administration is reaching for every lever they can . . . and some of those are having significant gains,\u201d said David Inserra, a policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation. \u201cBut the reality is that the measures Trump is entertaining are mostly executive agreements and [court] decisions on regulations. All of them can be undone or undermined by new court hearings or decisions elsewhere.\u201d\n\nTrump and his advisers view the immigration efforts as a political winner, and the president touted his policies during a campaign rally in Rio Rancho, N.M., in a heavily Latino state that leans Democratic. Polls show broad disapproval from Democrats over Trump\u2019s handling of immigration, while large majorities of Republican voters support his approach.\n\nAs the presidential entourage arrived here, Trump posted an image on Twitter with his face superimposed in front of a bollard wall and the message, in Spanish, \u201cNo M\u00e1s,\u201d meaning \u201cno more.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s critics have faulted him for trampling over long-standing U.S. asylum policies aimed at offering relief to vulnerable migrants fleeing persecution in their homelands.\n\nThe administration has forced at least 42,000 migrants, most of them from Central America, to remain in makeshift conditions in Mexican border towns as their asylum cases are litigated under a program called the Migrant Protection Protocols, or MPP. And a ruling last week from the Supreme Court permits federal officials to enforce new regulations to deny asylum to those migrants as a legal fight over the rules plays out in court.\n\nImmigrant rights advocates have accused Trump of employing draconian tactics to respond to a problem of his own making. The number of migrants taken into U.S. custody at the southern border peaked in May at more than 144,000 \u2014 the highest monthly total in a dozen years. Experts cited a rush to cross the border as Trump unsuccessfully pursued other hard-line measures, such as a policy that resulted in the separation of thousands of migrant children from their families.\n\nThough migration numbers traditionally dip in the hot summer months, federal officials have credited the significant decline in border crossings since May to the MPP program, as well as a crackdown from the Mexican government, which under threats of new tariffs from Trump dispatched thousands of National Guard troops to its northern and southern borders.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re certainly showing us that they are doing all they can to take credit and message that the actions they\u2019ve been taking are bearing fruit,\u201d said Doris Meissner, a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute who served as at top immigration official in the Clinton administration.\n\n\u201cIs it a durable solution? That\u2019s another issue,\u201d Meissner added. \u201cEverything we know about migration and the way migration works is that when you have strong push forces and when you have strong pull forces, things may be interrupted for a while, but then there\u2019s adaptation\u201d from migrants and smuggling networks.\n\nTrump aides defended their tactics as a justifiable emergency reaction to the humanitarian crisis in the spring.\n\nAdministration officials have faulted Congress for failing to pass a comprehensive immigration policy overhaul and pointed to the fast-growing number of asylum applications in recent years as evidence that Central American families are abusing lax U.S. policies. Most migrants who apply for asylum are released into the country while awaiting their court hearings, which can take months because of lengthy backlogs.\n\nIn addition to the new asylum restrictions, the Trump administration has reached an agreement with Guatemala that could compel migrants from El Salvador and Honduras who are seeking entrance to the United States to apply instead for asylum in that country.\n\nThe cumulative effect of their efforts, officials said, is to construct an obstacle course of physical, legal and bureaucratic hurdles that will drive down unauthorized immigration.\n\nTrump administration officials have said they expect to complete more than 450 miles of replacement and new border barriers by the end of 2020, but only a small fraction of that has been completed to date. The president also has failed to deliver on promises to get Mexico to pay the billions of dollars it is expected to cost, instead using emergency powers to tap into money that was allocated to Pentagon projects.\n\nThe Pentagon has compiled a list of projects overseas that will be eliminated due to the shift of dollars, and military officials have warned privately that the moves could put personnel at risk.\n\nThe Interior Department announced Wednesday it was transferring administrative jurisdiction of approximately 560 acres of federal land to the Army to build roughly 70 miles of border barriers.\n\nOn Tuesday, acting homeland security secretary Kevin McAleenan and several of his senior aides visited a makeshift courthouse in the border town of Laredo, Tex., established under the MPP program to expedite asylum hearings, the first of five planned facilities that could cost up to $155 million. And on Wednesday, the group conducted an aerial tour of the border fence here.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a false narrative out there that this is the president\u2019s vanity wall,\u201d said Mark Morgan, acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection. \u201cThat\u2019s false. He reached out to experts and agents on the front lines.\u201d\n\nImmigration experts warned that Trump is at risk of prematurely declaring victory.\n\nIn July, the Trump administration cut millions of dollars in aid to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, where most of the migrant families are coming from, a move experts said could depress efforts in those countries to improve economic and security conditions.\n\nFurthermore, Trump\u2019s threats of tariffs to force Mexico to crack down on migrants have engendered widespread political opposition in that country, said Alan Bersin, who served as CBP commissioner in the Obama administration. He added that Mexico\u2019s deteriorating economy could propel more migrants from that country to try to cross the border, even if the number of Central Americans continues to drop.\n\nBut Trump was enthusiastic during his tour. When a construction worker suggested the president join the team in signing their names on the steel bollard fencing, the president didn\u2019t hesitate.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll sign it,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nNakamura reported from Washington.", "description": "The visit comes as the administration has felt emboldened after winning new legal authority to move forward in funding a border wall and gaining additional powers to enforce asylum restrictions.", "authors": ["Philip Rucker", "White House Bureau Chief", "Nick Miroff", "Reporter Covering Immigration Enforcement", "The Department Of Homeland Security", "David Nakamura", "Reporter Covering The White House", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/UKdjFNaYZkshX7itzXFr15zMKcg=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BGUAFRW2MUI6TLDDGALHCFKD7Y.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
