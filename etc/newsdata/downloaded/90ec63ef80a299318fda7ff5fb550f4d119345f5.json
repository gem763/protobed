His team regularly finishes near the top of tournament brackets, winning the Rocket League Championship Series season six finals last year. Arruda has made a career from the game and gained more than 530,000 subscribers to his YouTube channel, where he uploads instructional gameplay montages.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA week before the start of RLCS season eight, The Post tapped into Squishy\u2019s rock-solid understanding of the game\u2019s mechanics to help aspiring players emulate his moves.\n\nPractice with training packs. A lot.\n\nArruda said any serious Rocket League player should spend 30 minutes to an hour training in free-play mode before starting their first match.\n\n\u201cA lot of pros would say the same,\u201d he added. \u201cA lot of their time is in free play.\u201d\n\nWhen he was starting out, Arruda said he only practiced in free play because he didn\u2019t have an Internet connection to compete against others. Now, players can utilize all the training packs from Rocket League \u2014 and countless more from the community \u2014 to hone specific skills or run set plays.\n\nAD\n\nArruda\u2019s recommendation: Make the most of it.\n\nUse time in training to focus on controlling the ball in the air and winning it off nearby walls, Arruda said. Fancier moves, such as the \u201cmusty flip,\u201d are fun to master and well-received on the community hubs such as the Rocket League subreddit, but remember there are no style points in competitive matches.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be going for unnecessarily flashy stuff if it\u2019s not going to be useful,\" Arruda said.\n\nWork on different skills in different modes\n\nOnce you\u2019re ready for a match, take a moment to mull over what mode to pick \u2014 whether it\u2019s 1v1, 2v2 or a traditional 3v3 match.\n\nOne-on-one games allow for more opportunities to practice dribbling and ball control. By nature, the matches are a series of 50-50 matchups, and those situations prepare players for the rare occasions when you find yourself with just one defender to beat in a traditional match.\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, 2v2 matches help players mitigate risk, Arruda said. One fewer player on the field forces you to play more conservatively on the ball, helping you build up a better instinct for when to challenge the ball and when to drop back.\n\nAnd finally, in a 3v3 match, you\u2019ll want to practice rotating off the ball with teammates. Arruda said two of the most important details to team play are spacing and anticipating the next touch on the ball.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt all comes down to being able to read the game,\u201d he added.\n\nOn defense, control the ball; don\u2019t clear it\n\nWhen you\u2019re on defense, always dribble or pass the ball out of your half of the pitch.\n\nPlayers can develop bad habits by simply clearing the ball for their opponents to control and bring back. In short, you\u2019ll create a \u201cping-pong\u201d effect where you have few opportunities for a clear shot on goal. As in many sports, possession is key.\n\nAD\n\nOnce you get possession, there are a few ways to put the opposing team on its heels, Arruda said. Take their boost from the back corners and, after that, get the ball in the air to force players to challenge the ball on their heels.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re pretty much just trying to put them in a position where they\u2019re going to second-guess their decisions every time,\u201d Arruda explained.\n\nAD\n\nWatch the tape\n\nExcelling at Rocket League starts with incremental improvements. Arruda does not recommend using your recent match record as an indication that you\u2019re getting \u201cbetter.\u201d Ranked matches will always place you against progressively better players if you\u2019re winning, or worse players if you\u2019re losing, so using your record can be a bit flawed.\n\nAD\n\nSave a match on your console and watch the tape a month or so later. That way, you\u2019ll be able to see how much you have improved over time. Replays also help show the flow of the game. Use the perspective to your advantage, Arruda said. Watch when you\u2019ve been scored on and why. Try to find trends or gaps in your defense. Often, teams are exposing the same mistake for most of their goals.\n\n\u201cThe thing about pro-level gameplay is you have maybe one to two seconds max with the ball,\" Arruda said. \"So you have to do something within that time period.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nProfessional play in RLCS matches has become a series of \u201cmind games on mind games,\u201d Arruda said, with players feinting off the ball to expose the defense. As soon as you hesitate, it becomes an opportunity for a goal. The best advice Arruda has is to be decisive and fully commit when you\u2019re challenging a ball.\n\n\u201cYou just got to trust your instinct,\u201d Arruda said. \u201cThere is no time to hesitate in this game. You have to be going, like, full speed almost the entire time.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Looking to improve on your mechanics? Want to grind to a higher rank?
