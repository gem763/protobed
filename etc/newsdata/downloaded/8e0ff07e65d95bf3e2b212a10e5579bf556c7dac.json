The reason is its bundled Dual Screen accessory, a wallet-style flip case that adds an entire full-sized secondary OLED display to what is otherwise a competent but pedestrian device.\n\nThe resulting combination isn\u2019t quite a folding phone, like Samsung\u2019s $1,980 Galaxy Fold, but it can be quite a lot of fun. And at a surprisingly low price of $699 for the bundle, it\u2019s LG\u2019s most intriguing US-bound offering in a while. There are certainly better all-around phones in its price bracket, but the G8X does enough different that it might just find a niche audience.\n\nOur review of LG G8X ThinQ Verge Score 7 out of 10 Good Stuff Awesome for multitasking\n\nGood battery life\n\nHeadphone jack Bad Stuff Unremarkable as a regular phone\n\nSoftware is half-baked\n\nHaptics are bad Buy for $779.99 from AT&T Buy for $699.99 from LG\n\nLet\u2019s start with the phone itself. LG phones have started to blur into one another over the past couple of years \u2014 the G7, V40, and G8 are all extremely similar devices that had the same pros and cons and the occasional stand-out gimmick. True to form, the G8X ThinQ \u2014 yes, LG appends \u201cThinQ\u201d to the name, and no, I\u2019m not going to from now \u2014 is no more or less remarkable than any of those models.\n\nBut while you\u2019d expect the G8X to share a lot in common with this year\u2019s G8 in particular, that isn\u2019t really the case. The G8\u2019s headline feature, its sensor array that allowed you to control the phone with motion gestures or unlock it by scanning your hand, is gone. The G8X still looks like an LG phone, and it shares the G8\u2019s Snapdragon 855 processor, but its spec sheet is otherwise mostly new.\n\nThe OLED screen has jumped up in size to 6.4 inches while taking a bump down in resolution to 1080p, which isn\u2019t something that bothered me at all. The loss of the G8\u2019s sensors has allowed LG to go with a smaller camera notch, even though the selfie camera has been upgraded to a 32-megapixel sensor. The phone remains 8.4mm thick without a camera bump on the rear, but LG has increased the battery capacity to 4,000mAh. There\u2019s a 12-megapixel rear-facing camera and a 13-megapixel ultrawide, a must-have 2019 feature that LG deserves credit for pioneering in 2016.\n\nAs a standalone device, the G8X is completely unremarkable. There\u2019s nothing about its industrial design that jumps out, and it doesn\u2019t even come in any colors other than a fingerprint-collecting glossy black. The most unusual thing about this phone is that it has a headphone jack \u2014 even Samsung dropped that feature in its latest models \u2014 and LG continues to offer the best smartphone audio quality thanks to the ability to activate a quad DAC when using wired headphones.\n\nThe Dual Screen is really the only reason to consider this phone\n\nAnother LG trademark feature is mysteriously gone, however. From the V30 on, the company set itself apart from other Android manufacturers with its best-in-class haptic feedback system, which made its phones much more enjoyable and responsive to use. Disappointingly, the G8X is a regression in this regard. It\u2019s not quite as bad as the can of pebbles you get from certain other companies, but I miss the ultra-precise vibrations. Holding down the backspace key just isn\u2019t what it used to be.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing really wrong with the G8X, nor is there much that is excellent. The camera is passable, the battery life is good, and the software is a little slicker than before. It\u2019s a solid phone that, if it sold by itself at LG\u2019s usual $800+ price point, would serve anyone who bought it well enough, but would be very hard to recommend over something like a OnePlus 7T unless you deeply cared about wireless charging, a headphone jack, and an official water/dust resistance rating. (The G8X\u2019s is IP68.)\n\nBut the G8X isn\u2019t $800+, and it isn\u2019t sold by itself. It\u2019s sold for $700 with a completely over-the-top accessory called the Dual Screen that adds not one, but two displays to the device. It is really the only reason to consider this phone at all.\n\nThe G8X slips in and out of the Dual Screen pretty easily, and links to the second display through a USB-C connector. This blocks the phone\u2019s own USB-C port, meaning you have to attach a somewhat cumbersome pogo pin adapter to a power cable if you want to use wired charging. Wireless charging, however, thankfully still works fine with the Dual Screen connected, and that\u2019s the way I\u2019ve been using the phone.\n\nWhen you pick up the phone with the Dual Screen closed, you\u2019ll see a small, low-res, monochrome OLED panel that shows you the time, date, battery level, and a few notification icons. The combination feels a little bulky, particularly since I don\u2019t normally use phones with cases at all, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s significantly bigger than a regular wallet case, and I didn\u2019t have any problems fitting it into my pockets. Opening the case up will wake the G8X\u2019s main screen, and you can unlock the phone with an optical in-display fingerprint sensor, which worked reliably enough for me but isn\u2019t as fast as more recent takes on the tech by Vivo and others.\n\nWith the G8X unlocked and the Dual Screen activated, you\u2019ll see what looks like two identical but separate phones. The second screen is indistinguishable from the G8X\u2019s \u2014 it even has the same notch cutout, despite the lack of camera \u2014 and comes with its own home layout and app drawer. This isn\u2019t like the Galaxy Fold where the extra pixels give you more screen space. Most of the time, other than the ability to expand Chrome across both screens, you\u2019ll just be running two regular phone apps side by side.\n\nThis is kind of cool or kind of unfortunate, depending on your perspective. The gap between the screens is honestly too big to ignore when content spans the two, and I find it more useful to have two apps running at once. It\u2019s pretty great, for example, to be able to keep up with #NBATwitter at the same time as the actual NBA. Or you can just keep a YouTube video running on one screen while doing other stuff on the other, saving you from paying for a YouTube Premium subscription.\n\nThere were times using the G8X when I felt vastly more productive than I could be on almost any other phone. Just being able to keep track of a Slack conversation while delving into Chrome, Google Drive, or Twitter for research is hugely useful. And, since it\u2019s one phone with one clipboard, it\u2019s easy to copy information between two apps at once. It\u2019s not far away from running two iPad apps side-by-side in split view on an iPad mini, except the multitasking UI is much easier to understand with standard Android navigation buttons on each screen.\n\nAgree to continue: LG G8X ThinQ Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it \u2014 contracts that no one actually reads. It\u2019s impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements. But we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit \u201cagree\u201d to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don\u2019t read and definitely can\u2019t negotiate. To use the LG G8X with its Android software and the Play store, you must sign into a Google account and agree to: Google Terms of Service\n\nGoogle Play Terms of Service\n\nGoogle Privacy Policy (included in ToS)\n\nInstall apps and updates: \u201cYou agree this device may also automatically download and install updates and apps from Google, your carrier, and your device\u2019s manufacturer, possibly using cellular data.\u201d The following agreements are optional: Use location: \u201cGoogle may collect location data periodically and use this data in any anonymous way to improve location accuracy and location-based services.\u201d\n\nAllow scanning: \u201cAllow apps and services to scan for Wi-Fi networks and nearby devices at any time, even when Wi-Fi or Bluetooth is off.\u201d\n\nSend usage and diagnostic data You also have to agree to LG\u2019s EULA and privacy policy. Sending activity logs to LG \u201cto prevent errors while your phone is in use\u201d is optional. Final tally: six mandatory agreements and four optional agreements during initial setup, which may rise if you want to use other Google services.\n\nBut it feels like the G8X\u2019s two displays aren\u2019t really aware of each other, which turns out to be awkward in practice. Why is there no option, for example, for a shared home screen? Why do I have to deal with LG\u2019s notoriously fiddly method for arranging apps in a drawer twice? Most of the time, the only thing you can do to control what\u2019s on each screen is to press a little floating shortcut button and swap the content. LG\u2019s built-in apps do have some neat features, like the ability to send a photo thumbnail to the other screen at full size, but third-party support is non-existent and there\u2019s very little sense that this is a device running software designed for its form factor.\n\nTake typing. It would be great if, when entering text on one app, a larger keyboard would come up across both screens. Instead, you just get the regular-sized Android keyboard on one screen, which turns out to be near-impossible to thumb-type on due to the G8X\u2019s clamshell form factor. I found myself folding the second screen back 360 degrees whenever I needed to type, which isn\u2019t the end of the world but feels pretty ridiculous. What am I carrying this bulk around for, again?\n\nThe one part of the G8X\u2019s software that does make an effort to have the two screens work in tandem is LG\u2019s Game Pad app, which takes up the entirety of one screen with a virtual game controller. It works like a standard external controller for any Android game with built-in support, and you can create your own custom mappings for touch-only titles. But without triggers, shoulder buttons, or other additional physical inputs, the utility is limited. The only real advantage is that you\u2019re not covering up the action with your thumbs, but even then it\u2019s often easier just to play directly on a single screen, since most games are designed to be played that way.\n\nOther elements of the software experience feel less like they haven\u2019t been thought through and more that they just haven\u2019t been finished. One bizarre glitch, for example, is that you can\u2019t use the G8X\u2019s evening mode, which makes the screen colors warmer, with the Dual Screen attached \u2014 and a message pops up to tell you as much. This isn\u2019t a feature that everyone uses, granted, but it is one that I use, and let me tell you it has not been fun using the G8X in the evening this past week. Out of all the screens in my life, including my LG TV, these are the only two that blast aggressive blue light into my retinas after the sun goes down. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t act like a multitasking power user at that time of day anyway, but come on.\n\nOne area of the G8X where I have no complaints is its battery life. I was a little concerned about this, given that recent LG phones haven\u2019t had the greatest endurance records and the G8X has twice as many full-sized OLED screens to power, but it turned out better than expected. Yesterday I got close to six hours of screen time with both displays switched on, one of them constantly streaming various live sports while I used the other for general phone things. That\u2019s better than most flagship Android phones that only have one screen. One thing worth noting is that the Dual Screen switches itself off at 10 percent charge and won\u2019t let you turn it back on until the phone has more juice.\n\nThe LG G8X does not provide a sleek, futuristic experience. It is, however, still a phone that can do things that no other phone can do, and if those things sound useful to you, it\u2019s a good deal at $699. The multitasking setup is the best I\u2019ve ever had on a phone, for one thing, even if LG does get there by brute force.\n\nYou\u2019d really have to want the Dual Screen\n\nYou\u2019d really have to want the Dual Screen for this to make sense as your daily phone, though, which means you\u2019d really have to be okay with a bulky device that requires some effort to get the most out of. The G8X is not competitive as a traditional smartphone, and I can\u2019t recommend it over a $599 OnePlus 7T, a $699 iPhone 11, or even an on-sale Galaxy S10.\n\nBut that\u2019s because I don\u2019t know if you, the reader, are someone who would have any use for a wacky dual-screen wallet case. If you know that you are, I think you\u2019ll enjoy the LG G8X.", "description": "The G8X is both the most boring phone LG has ever released and one of its most experimental at the same time.
