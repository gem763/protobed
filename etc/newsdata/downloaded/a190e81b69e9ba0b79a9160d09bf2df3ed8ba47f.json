We had the lead and obviously Australia were throwing everything at us,\u201d said Farrell. \u201cWe wanted to play the game at our pace not theirs, and we did that in the second half.\u201d\n\nWith his contract up after the World Cup, the defeat appears to have ended Michael Cheika\u2019s five-year stint as Wallabies coach whose highlight was reaching the World Cup final in 2015.\n\n\u201cThe better team won, that\u2019s the way it is. You\u2019ve got to suck that up sometimes,\u201d said a disconsolate Cheika, a former team-mate of Jones at Sydney\u2019s Randwick club.\n\n\u201cI was supposed to get this done for the people here and the Australians. It\u2019s so disappointing.\u201d\n\nAustralia looked dangerous early on but England seized the advantage with May\u2019s quickfire try double.\n\nEngland stretched the Australian defence as they attacked right and then left, before man of the match Tom Curry drew the final defender to give the left wing an easy score in the corner.\n\nHenry Slade then intercepted the ball on halfway and raced towards the try-line before chipping into space with a kick that was deftly gathered by the England wing.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Little bit surreal\u2019 \u2013\n\nThree Christian Lealiifano penalties kept Australia in touch at 17-9 at half-time, and they came storming back after the restart when Marika Koroibete skinned Elliot Daly to cross for the Wallabies.\n\nBut England hit back almost immediately when Farrell picked out Sinckler with a bullet pass and the prop burst through a gap for his first international try.\n\nWatson\u2019s late intercept try completed the job for England, who equalled their record margin of victory against Australia \u2014 and beat them for a third time in the World Cup quarter-finals.\n\nIn Saturday\u2019s second match the All Blacks, going for their third straight title, will start as firm favourites against an Ireland team who are yet to hit their stride in Japan.\n\nHowever, both teams are mindful of the fact that Ireland have won two of their last three games against the world\u2019s top-ranked side, after 2016\u2019s 40-29 win in Chicago and a 16-9 victory in Dublin last year.\n\nConor Murray and World Player of the Year Johnny Sexton, one of the world\u2019s most settled and formidable half-back pairings, lead Irish hopes against a youthful New Zealand back line.\n\nBeauden Barrett remains at fullback behind fly-half Richie Mo\u2019unga in Hansen\u2019s double playmaker ploy, while Jack Goodhue comes into the centres and Sevu Reece and George Bridge are on the wings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit surreal, it\u2019s a little bit \u2018I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s finally here\u2019. This time four years ago I was a spectator like you guys and it\u2019s not a great place to be,\u201d said Sexton, who missed Ireland\u2019s 2015 quarter-final \u2014 a 43-20 defeat to Argentina \u2014 with a groin strain.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m really looking forward to going out there on the biggest stage and trying to show what we can do against the best team in the world, a team that hasn\u2019t lost for two World Cups.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, Wales face France in Oita and hosts Japan, the tournament\u2019s surprise package, play the first World Cup quarter-final in their history against South Africa in Tokyo.", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 England showed they will take some beating at the Rugby World Cup as they thumped their old enemy Australia 40-16 to become the first", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/ad6023_england-jonny-may-scored-two-in-minutes-england-send-out-world-cup-message-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
