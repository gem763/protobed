USA TODAY\n\nBOSTON \u2014 Three parents have agreed to plead guilty to charges in the nation's college admissions scheme in the last 24 hours, the largest collection of parents to cave to prosecutors in the blockbuster \"Varsity Blues\" since April.\n\nManuel Henriquez, founder and CEO of the venture capital firm Hercules Capital, and Michelle Janavs, a former executive of the company that makes Hot Pockets, on Friday became the latest to agree to plead guilty in court Monday, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Boston said.\n\nThe moves signal a major shift in the historic admissions case \u2014 and it could mean additional parents still fighting charges might also flip instead of going to trial next year.\n\nBoth defendants had pleaded not guilty to charges in April.\n\nManuel and Elizabeth Henriquez arrive at federal court in Boston on Wednesday, April 3, 2019, to face charges in a nationwide college admissions bribery scandal.

His notice was filed with the court Thursday.\n\nThe three guilty pleas means more than half, 27 out of 52 people charged in the nation's college admissions case, will have pleaded guilty. That includes 18 out of 35 parents charged with crimes.\n\nMore: Former Pimco CEO to plead guilty for $500,000 bribes in college admissions scandal\n\nWilliam \"Rick\" Singer, CEO of Edge College & Career Network leaves the federal courthouse in Boston Tuesday.

The transactions occurred between 2015 and 2018.\n\nElizabeth Henriquez is not scheduled to plead guilty with her husband. Her attorney Aaron Katz declined to comment.\n\nProsecutors have also accused Henriquez of conspiring to bribe Gordon Ernst, the former head tennis coach at Georgetown University, with a $400,000 payment to designate their older daughter as a tennis recruit to get her into the school.\n\nMichelle Janavs, former executive of a food manufacturer, makes her way out of the courthouse after giving her plea in front of a judge for charges in the college admissions scandal at the John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse in Boston on March 29, 2019.

She is an heiress of her family's food manufacturing company Chef America, which makes the microwave snack Hot Pockets.\n\nProsecutors say Janavs paid Singer $50,000 in 2017 after having someone fix her daughter's ACT exam answers and another $50,000 in 2018 to the USC Women's Athletic Funds after her daughter was admitted into USC as a fake beach volleyball recruit. They say she wired Singer's sham nonprofit an additional $25,000 in February after someone changed answers on the ACT for Janavs' younger daughter.\n\nMore: Felicity Huffman is just the beginning: Who's pleaded guilty in the college admissions scandal \u2014 and who's still fighting\n\nThe plea reversals come after the sentencing this fall of 10 parents charged in the scheme who pleaded guilty in the spring. Only one avoided prison.\n\nOn Friday, U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani sentenced Robert Flaxman, a developer who specializes in luxurious resorts, to one month in prison for paying $75,000 to Singer to have someone change answers on his daughter's ACT exam.\n\nepa07432753 Crown Reality and Development CEO Robert Flaxman leaves the Los Angeles Federal Court of Justice where he attended a hearing in Los Angeles, California, USA, 12 March 2019.

Mark Riddell, a private high school counselor paid by Singer, helped them answer questions as a group, prosecutors say. Riddell advised them to answer questions differently to not alert the ACT to the cheating.\n\nFlaxman's attorney, William Weinreb, said Flaxman cheated out of desperation to help his daughter who was struggling and needed a safe place to recover. Court documents have redacted details of his daughter's issues.\n\n\"I apologize to the students who work hard and don\u2019t cheat no matter what,\u201d Flaxman told the judge before starting to sob. \u201cI\u2019m sorry \u201c\n\nEighteen parents, including actress Lori Loughlin, have pleaded not guilty to charges and are on track for trial next year.\n\nCLOSE The college admissions scam involving Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman shows how some rich families use a \u201cside door\u201d to game an already unfair education system.
