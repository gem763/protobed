The Kardashians aren't shy when it comes to obsessing over throwback fashion, but tracking down high-end garments of yesteryear is easier said than done thanks to a surge in popularity and a finite supply. Kourtney's sparkling Dior number was actually borrowed from an ultra-private showroom hidden away in a Hollywood Hills home that celebrity stylists consider to be the mecca of high-end vintage marketplaces. All 3,500 pieces available for rent are carefully curated by Chicagoan Janet Mandell, a longtime couture collector and one of the industry's best-kept secrets.\n\n\n\nMandell flies under the radar, but she's responsible for the sartorial success of dozens of celebrities, including Priyanka Chopra Jonas, who donned her ruched cherry-colored Tom Ford belted dress for an interview on The View. Mandell also sent Gigi Hadid a 1980s Chanel number to wear at Karl Lagerfeld's memorial \"Karl Forever,\" this summer.\n\nThe collector's eponymous showrooms (she's also got a second location in Chicago) contain over $2.3 million of drool-worthy designer rags, from archived Chanel suits to Saint Laurent dresses with diving d\u00e9colletage to glittering Van Cleef & Arpels necklaces. Her collection of 1990s Manolo Blahnik sandals would send Carrie Bradshaw into cardiac arrest.\n\nPhoto credit: Edward Berthelot - Getty Images More\n\nAlthough Mandell does offer fresh-off-the-runway finds, it's her covetous trove of 1990s Valentino, Gucci, Versace, and Chanel\u2014which makes up about 20 percent of her inventory\u2014that attracts her celebrity clientele. It's also what sets her business apart from other resale or renting competitors like Rent The Runway, The Real Real, and Armarium.\n\n\"All these really ageless fashion girls like Bella and Gigi [Hadid] and Kim and Kourtney [Kardashian], they don't want anything that's current. I have the sickest Chanel suits that I bought off the runway last year and they love it, but they're like, 'You know what Janet? I can't wear that,\" Mandell tells ELLE.com. \"They don't want to be seen in something that somebody else might possibly wear. They want Pucci 1990s, Versace 1990s and it has to be Gianni Versace. It can't be just Versace.\"\n\nMandell works directly with stylists to determine what, in her vintage collection, will suit their client. Then, after a consultation, she allows items to be rented for seven days and also offers \"temporary tailoring,\" to alter a garment's size.\n\nKourtney Kardashian's stylist Dani Mitchell says she prefers Mandell's collection over others because of their one-of-a-kind nature. \"What's so special about Janet's pieces are, besides their label status, their style,\" Mitchell tells ELLE.com. \"Janet has an amazing eye for the most special pieces, and curating a heaven where archives can be accessed. Walking into her showroom takes your breath away... If you love fashion, you need to know about Janet Mandell.\"\n\n\n\nPhoto credit: Instagram @kourtneykardash - Getty Images More\n\nStory continues", "description": "The Hadid sisters are clients, too", "authors": ["Rose Minutaglio"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KH_b6jecnJm3Lh8jGqJWzQ--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/elle_865/085bec1e1aaece78489e3ac12fdecd42", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
