I\u2019ve followed this issue of LED light bulbs and so forth and there have been huge breakthroughs, you all know that.\n\n\u201cWe use much less electricity, these light bulbs last a lot longer and it is a major breakthrough that also speaks to the issue of energy efficiency.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIf you can get electricity from a light bulb that utilises one-tenth of the power that an old incandescent light bulb used, of course you\u2019re going to do that.\u201d\n\nThe rollback is another example of Mr Trump\u2019s attempts to remove environmental protections that his administration claims are a burden on businesses.\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s efficiency standards were set to come into effect on 1 January 2020.\n\nAgencies contributed to this report", "description": "The Trump administration has finalised its rollback of an Obama-era rule that would have required light bulbs to be more energy efficient.
