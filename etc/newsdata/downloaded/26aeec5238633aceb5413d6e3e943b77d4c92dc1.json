She told \"Good Morning America\" she is unable to work and tries to manage her daily expenses.\n\nBurnham is exactly the type of person Julie Curry, the owner of Bake'n Babes in Tampa, wanted to help during Breast Cancer Awareness Month. To do so, the shop is selling its \"Freak Shakes, which are over-the-top milkshakes, to fundraise for Burnham. This month, the eatery has sold almost 100 of them.\n\nTo get a sense of the social media-worthiness of the sweet treats, look no further than an Instagram post by singer Lizzo, who appears to love the custom-made Freak Shake she was served and even gave Bake'n Babes a shout-out in the caption.\n\nCurry said she was inspired to sell a Freak Shake called \u201cThink Pink\u201d throughout October after one of her bakers, Jen Ingandela, revealed her own personal battle with breast cancer. Curry said Ingandela told her people would often say they had donated to walk-a-thons or another cause in her honor, but Curry \u201cwished they would\u2019ve donated the money to her.\u201d\n\nAfter this conversation, Curry wanted to get involved and went on the hunt to find a woman battling the disease she and the bakery could help directly.\n\n\u201cJen was pretty adamant about find[ing] a local person,\u201d Curry said.\n\nCurry was soon connected by a friend to Burnham and then decided to make her the beneficiary of the fundraising effort.\n\n\u201c[I] wanted her to make sure she didn\u2019t feel this was a charity case,\" Curry said. \"I wanted her to know [there were] other women in the community who care for her.\u201d\n\nBeyond her own diagnosis, Burnham is no stranger to the disease.\n\n\u201cMy mom was diagnosed and died when I was at 8,\" she said, noting that her sister beat stage 4 breast cancer, and that two of her aunts also had battles with cancer.\n\nCurry told ABC affiliate WFTS in Tampa that this initiative is sparking an important conversation in an unexpected place.\n\n\"I know it's not something a bakery would normally talk about,\" she said.\n\nWhat's more, the bakery has featured a different breast cancer survivor each day in October on social media, telling their stories and encouraging others to get checked.\n\nJulie Curry, owner of Baken Babes\n\n\u201cPeople are coming in and wanted to buy,\" Curry told \"GMA.\" \"Every day we are sharing a survivor story because I want everyone to feel that love and support.\"\n\nBurnham does and said she wants those fighting breast cancer to know that \u201cit may be hard right now, but it will get better.\"\n\n\"Make sure you get checked,\" she said. \"I saw a lump before my 23rd birthday, so that\u2019s crazy.\u201d", "description": "Bake\u2019n Babes", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/victoria-burnham-shake-ht-jt-191010_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
