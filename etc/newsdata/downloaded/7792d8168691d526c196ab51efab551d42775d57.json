I cannot stand by as good, loyal moderate Conservatives are expelled.\"\n\nShe called the expulsions from the party \"an attack on decency and democracy.\"\n\nRudd also told the Times she was \"surprised, unfortunately, by the lack of work and preparation that is going into getting a deal with the European Union.\"\n\nShe added that \"what I had expected to see was a huge government-centered effort to get a deal and at the moment there is a lot of working going on into no-deal and not enough into getting a deal.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Rudd told the BBC's Andrew Marr \"it's like 80-90 percent of government time going into preparing for no-deal.\"\n\nIn April 2018, Rudd resigned as home secretary in Theresa May's government following allegations she had misled the public over her department\u2019s targets to remove illegal immigrants.\n\nIn the wake of revelations that legal Caribbean migrants who moved to Britain decades ago \u2014 the so-called Windrush generation \u2014 were ordered to leave the country because they did not have the correct documentation, pressure mounted on the government over its policy to create a \u201chostile environment\u201d for illegal immigrants.\n\nRudd claimed there was no government \u201ctarget\u201d to increase deportations of illegal immigrants. However the Guardian reported she had written to May about the department\u2019s aspiration to increase \u201cremovals\u201d by 10 percent. She came back into Cabinet when Johnson took over as PM.", "description": "\u2018I cannot stand by as good, loyal moderate\u00a0Conservatives\u00a0are expelled.\u2019", "authors": ["Paul Dallison"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/GettyImages-1125806527-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
