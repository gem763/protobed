A major turning point occurred when Williams failed to convert two set points while up 5-4 in the first.\n\nAfter falling behind 0-5 in the second set, Williams stormed back to force the tie-break, which Collins won 7-5.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really play great the entire way through so I wasn\u2019t too happy with my performance even though I got the win, but I was happy to pull it out and sometimes you have to win ugly,\u201d said Collins.\n\nCollins has now won both of her encounters with Williams, her previous win coming in last year\u2019s Miami quarterfinals.\n\nWilliams was the 2015 Wuhan Open champion, but hadn\u2019t played in the tournament since 2016 when she lost to Svetlana Kuznetsova in the second round. The 39-year-old is now 7-8 in matches played outside of the U.S. this year.\n\nCollins will next play defending champion Aryna Sabalenka, who defeated fellow Belarussian Aliaksandra Sasnovich 6-1, 6-2 in the pair\u2019s first meeting.\n\nSabalenka broke her opponent\u2019s serve four times and was a perfect three for three on break points saved as she cruised to a quick victory.\n\nSabalenka was a champion at Shenzhen earlier this year, and won her first Grand Slam doubles title at the U.S. Open last month with Elise Mertens.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "American Danielle Collins beat seven-time Grand Slam champion Venus Williams 7-5, 7-6 (5) in the opening round of the Wuhan Open on Sunday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
