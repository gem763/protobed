(AP) - A Connecticut businessman convicted for his role in a human trafficking ring that preyed on young men who were mentally ill and intellectually disabled is fighting a court-ordered HIV test.\n\nThe Hartford Courant reports Bruce Bemer is arguing that the order violates his constitutional rights against unreasonable searches. He\u2019s asking the state Supreme Court to overturn the test order. Some of the victims allege Bemer knew he was HIV-positive but never disclosed it while having unprotected sex.\n\nBemer was sentenced to 10 years in prison in June but is free pending an appeal of his conviction. A jury found the Glastonbury resident guilty of patronizing victims of human trafficking in April.\n\nBemer, who owns the New London-Waterford Speedbowl racetrack, admitted he patronized prostitutes, but denied any role in human trafficking.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Hartford Courant, http://www.courant.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A Connecticut businessman convicted for his role in a human trafficking ring that preyed on young men who were mentally ill and intellectually disabled is fighting a court-ordered HIV test.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
