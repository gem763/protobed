Garrabrant/Getty Images\n\nThe United States is on the brink of securing the top spot in Group K following Saturday's 69-53 victory over Greece at the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup.\n\nThere were fireworks on the court after the game, with ESPN's Brian Windhorst noting players from both teams had to be separated when the U.S. took exception to a hard foul Thanasis Antetokounmpo committed on Harrison Barnes.\n\nSince Tuesday's close call against Turkey, Team USA has performed much better in the past two games. The defense, in particular, has been excellent in wins over Japan and Greece with a combined 98 points allowed.\n\nUSA head coach Gregg Popovich and his staff still have some things to clean up before the knockout phase begins Tuesday. Kemba Walker (15 points) and Donovan Mitchell (10 points) were the only players to reach double-figures in scoring, and the team shot just 36.4 percent overall.\n\nSpeaking to Windhorst prior to taking on Greece, Popovich noted the difficulties of trying to prepare for different countries that have such unique and diverse ways of playing.\n\n\"In the NBA, you know each night the Os and Xs and what people are going to run and that sort of thing,\" Popovich said. \"But here every team has a different take on the way they want to play. It's actually enjoyable and challenging as each team is a different artwork to be figured out.\"\n\nEven though the United States hasn't always run like a well-oiled machine, Popovich has his team operating at a level that allows them to keep winning games.\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo did everything he could to help the Greek squad get a win. The reigning NBA MVP had 15 points on 7-of-11 shooting and grabbed 13 rebounds. He received virtually no support from his teammates, who went 14-of-55 from the field.\n\nGreece head coach Thanasis Skourtopoulos' strategy throughout this tournament has been unusual, especially when it comes to his best player.\n\nAntetokounmpo has seemingly been lost in the rotation at times. His 11 attempts against the Americans were his most in this World Cup, but they all came in the first three quarters.\n\nIn Brazil's 79-78 comeback win over Greece on Tuesday, Antetokounmpo took seven shots in the game and played just 13 minutes in the first half.\n\nKostas Sloukas (13 points) once again led Greece's offense with 12 field-goal attempts. He did make three of his six shots from three-point range. Georgios Papagiannis, who entered Saturday as the team's second-leading scorer at 13.8 points per game, was held scoreless on three shot attempts in eight minutes.\n\nSaturday's loss drops Greece to last place in Group K with a 2-2 record, but it can still make it out of group play over .500 with a win Monday against the Czech Republic.\n\nThe United States (4-0) is the only undefeated team in Group K and has secured a spot in the knockout phase.\n\nWalker, Mitchell and Team USA will close out group play Monday against Brazil at 8:30 a.m. ET.", "description": "The United States is on the brink of securing the top spot in Group K following Saturday's 69-53   victory over Greece at the 2019  FIBA Basketball World Cup ...", "authors": ["Adam Wells"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/826/968/hi-res-da60325345cee695d2af3eee1c03e00c_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
