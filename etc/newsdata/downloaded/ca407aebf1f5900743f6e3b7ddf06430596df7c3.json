He is the author of the new book \"United States of Jihad: Investigating America's Homegrown Terrorists.\"\n\n(CNN) The mass killing in Orlando this weekend fits a grim pattern: Every lethal terrorist attack in the United States in the past decade and a half has been carried out by American citizens or legal permanent residents, operating either as lone wolves or in pairs, who have no formal connections or training from terrorist organizations such as al Qaeda or ISIS.\n\nBecause 9/11 was carried out by 19 Arab foreign-born terrorists, many Americans may think that terrorist attacks in the United States are carried out by foreigners, rather than by U.S. citizens.\n\nBut Omar Mateen, who on Sunday carried out the deadliest terrorist attack in the United States since 9/11, is an American citizen who was born in New York to parents who immigrated to the United States from Afghanistan.\n\nIn fact, since 9/11, a plot which was directed by al Qaeda from Afghanistan and involved only foreign operatives, the real terror threat in the United States has been American citizens or legal permanent residents such as the Tsarnaev brothers, who carried out the Boston Marathon bombings in 2013, and Nidal Hasan, the U.S. Army major who killed 13 at Fort Hood, Texas, four years earlier.\n\nIn other ways, Mateen is also typical of jihadist terrorists in the States. He was on the radar of the FBI as a possible militant, just as Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was investigated by the bureau because of a tip from the Russian government in 2011 that he might be a militant.\n\nRead More", "description": "Every lethal terrorist attack in the States in the past decade and a half has been carried out by American citizens or legal permanent residents, writes Peter Bergen", "authors": ["Peter Bergen", "Cnn National Security Analyst"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160612132853-20-orlando-shooting-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2016-06-12"}
