It hurt to watch Christine Blasey Ford recount a traumatic incident to a panel of repugnant old men, then be questioned and disbelieved publicly and cast aside to be alone with her death threats. It was emotionally and physically draining to watch a woman go through what so many women go through, but at the hands of the United States Congress; at America\u2019s hands. Where would all that rage go? (It went nowhere; pushed down inside again, shoved back into the painful wound it had left behind, to press uncomfortably on our hearts forever.)\n\nFrom out of that wound springs another: The spectacle of watching the national Democratic leadership demonstrate, over and over again, that they do not understand (or pretend not to understand) where this kind of anger comes from, or how to use political anger to their advantage. Republicans have been very successful in marshaling the rage of their base. During President Barack Obama\u2019s tenure, it was almost too easy. Everything, from the First Lady suggesting children should eat vegetables to the president disrespectfully raising his latte at the troops, could be spun into white resentment of the stubbornly black president.\n\n\n\nNot so for the Democrats. Throughout the Trump presidency\u2014which has engendered (much more righteous) fury among the Democratic base\u2014that anger has been squandered. The Kavanaugh confirmation fight was emblematic of this pathology. Republicans raised a hue and cry about the outrageous treatment of this Good Man whenever Democrats even timidly suggested that maybe it was in the public interest to determine whether or not the Supreme Court nominee sexually assaulted a woman. They had to be pushed to press this case. Ryan Grim reported in his book We\u2019ve Got People earlier this year that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer \u201crepeatedly told outside allies that a furious stand against Kavanaugh would enrage Trump supporters and only disappoint progressive voters. We have no power, he explained repeatedly.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s unsurprising, then, to see how senior Democrats are responding to the latest allegations against Brett Kavanaugh. Politico reported on Monday that senior Democrats were \u201cmoving quickly to snuff out calls to impeach Brett Kavanaugh,\u201d because such calls were not \u201crealistic.\u201d \u201cGet real,\u201d said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin. Having an old man tell women and activists who do not believe a man who might have had a proclivity for waving his dick in women\u2019s faces should be on the Supreme Court, \u201cget over it\u201d: That\u2019s just what we call good politics.\n\n", "description": "The newly embattled Supreme Court justice has nothing to fear from a party that's terrified of wielding power.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/76b2a8858f555e9a85d9fcad614b17a44aedc889.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
