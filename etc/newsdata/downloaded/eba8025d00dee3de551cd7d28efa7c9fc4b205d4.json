Against this back-drop, this week is poised to be another busy one for markets.\n\nAs the situation stands now, President Donald Trump on Friday unleashed another hike on the rate of tariffs for some Chinese goods. This announcement came after China earlier in the day Friday announced it planned to impose new tariffs on $75 billion worth of U.S. imports \u2013 a move that itself had been a response to the Trump administration\u2019s previously announced tariffs set to take effect in September and December.\n\n\u201cThis illustrates the speed at which the trade war is now escalating and there is no way of knowing where it will end,\u201d Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist for Capital Economics, said in a note. \u201cIt is fears about where the trade war is going that will now weigh even more heavily on financial markets and business investment in the coming months \u2013 and that is where the real damage to the US economy will be done.\u201d\n\nIndeed, White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said on Sunday that Trump \u201cregrets not raising the tariffs higher.\u201d\n\nInvestors will be monitoring the trade situation, and piecing together new U.S. economic data releases for signs of whether this trade sparring has weakened some of the last bastions of strength in the domestic economy.\n\nRecent data has highlighted a bifurcation in the U.S. economy as the trade-sensitive manufacturing sector softened, while the consumer-led service sector held up more strongly.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump gestures during family photo session at the G7 summit in Biarritz, France August 25, 2019. REUTERS/Christian Hartmann/Pool More\n\n\u201cThe next batch of activity data for July are likely to highlight the divergence between the struggling manufacturing sector and resilient consumers, with core durable goods orders dropping back but real consumption rising at a solid pace,\u201d Andrew Hunter, senior U.S. economist for Capital Economics, wrote in a note Friday.\n\nManufacturing activity indices from the Dallas and Richmond Federal Reserves are both expected to show negative readings again for August, albeit slightly less so than from July. These surveys come on the heels of a report from IHS Markit last week showing U.S. manufacturing activity slid into contractionary territory in August, reaching the lowest level in nearly a decade.\n\nMoreover, orders for durable goods, or manufactured products intended to last at least three years, are expected to have risen at a slower pace in July from June, according to consensus economists. And non-defense capital goods orders, excluding aircraft, are expected to have been flat in July. These orders are widely seen as a proxy for future business investment. Data on durable goods and capital goods orders are set for release Monday.\n\nEconomists have widely pointed out that the trade uncertainty has muddied visibility for businesses, making it difficult for them to commit to capital projects and make plans to build out their operations.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s part of the reason we see the divergence between what\u2019s happening with investment, where you see investment being very weak, as opposed to consumer spending, which is much healthier,\u201d International Monetary Fund chief economist Gita Gopinath said in an interview with Yahoo Finance last week.\n\nBut the consumer has remained a stronger part of the U.S. economy, as evidenced by July\u2019s estimates-beating retail sales figures, as well as better-than-expected results from retailers including Target (TGT) and Walmart (WMT) this earnings season.\n\nEconomists expect that the second print on second-quarter U.S. gross domestic product \u2013 which is set for release Thursday \u2013 will affirm this stance. The first print showed growth of 2.1% in the second-quarter, beating expectations. This had been driven by much better-than-expected personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which grew 4.3%, or the most in six quarters.", "description": "Another wild week in the markets sent the Dow more than 600 points lower last Friday alone, as investors considered the latest escalations in the U.S.-China trade war.
