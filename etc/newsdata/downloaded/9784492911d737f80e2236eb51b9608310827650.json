The indictment claims the two women conspired to bring a two-year-old girl across the border with a U.S. birth certificate belonging to the woman\u2019s actual child.\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Homeland Security Investigation (HSI) agents identified a child being smuggled with two adults falsely claiming to be the child\u2019s relatives, according to Del Rio Sector Border Patrol officials. The two women crossed the border with the small child and claimed to be a family. HSI agents conducted an investigation that concluded the adults had no familial relation to the child, Breitbart Texas reported in September.\n\nIn a statement released on Friday by ICE officials, the grand jury indicted 42\u2013year-old Aida Martinez of Eagle Pass, TX, and 20-year-old Aida Rodriguez, a U.S. citizen who resided in Piedras Negras, Coahuila, Mexico, at the time of the offense, for \u201cone count of conspiracy to bring an alien into the U.S., one substantive count of bringing an alien into the U.S., and one count of making a false statement to a federal agent.\u201d\n\nThe heavily redacted indictment obtained by Breitbart Texas asserts Martine and Rodriguez conspired with each other and others to baring an alien child illegally across the border from Mexico into Texas for money. It further asserts that the duo actually did smuggle the alien child illegally across the border by presenting a false birth certificate for the child and later Rodriquez lied to investigators about being related to the child.\n\nRodriquez told investigators that the \u201cminor female that accompanied her was her daughter,\u201d the indictment states in Count Three. Rodriguez allegedly \u201cpresented her daughter\u2019s birth certificate to corroborate her claim.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe defendant then and there knew the minor female she was traveling with was not her daughter,\u201d Count Three of the indictment concludes.\n\nICE officials stated:\n\nAccording to court records, on September 23, 2019, the defendants brought an undocumented female, approximately two years old, into the U.S. through the Eagle Pass Port of Entry while fraudulently using Rodriguez\u2019s actual daughter\u2019s birth certificate. Later that day, federal and state authorities arrested the defendants and recovered the unknown child as they were traveling northbound on Highway 57 near Batesville, TX. The defendants initially provided conflicting statements to investigators, but later admitted their intent was to take the child to unknown individuals in San Antonio, collect payment for the child, then return the money to co-conspirators in Piedras Negras.\n\nOfficials have not reported who the child\u2019s actual parents are or how the Texas mother and daughter came into possession of the child.\n\n\u201cProtecting innocent children must be the number one priority of our border security system,\u201d U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Texas John F Bash said in a written statement. \u201cThis office stands ready to prosecute anyone who commits a federal offense that harms a child.\u201d\n\nICE officials turned the migrant child over to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n\u201cHSI\u2019s message is clear \u2013 our priority is to protect the children,\u201d HSI Special Agent in Charge Folden added. \u201cHSI will continue to partner with the Border Patrol to identify and dismantle the criminal organizations using fraud to smuggle children.\u201d\n\nDel Rio Border Patrol Sector Chief Patrol Agent Raul L. Ortiz concluded, \u201cOf all the people that smugglers exploit, children are the most vulnerable. Thanks to the cooperative efforts between HSI and Border Patrol, this child was removed from a dangerous situation and properly cared for.\u201d\n\nThe HSI Eagle Pass office led the investigation that resulted in the indictment of Martinez and Rodriquez on Wednesday. The Texas Department of Public Safety and U.S. Border Patrol provided assistance in the case.\n\nIf convicted on the charges, Martinez and Rodriguez could each face up to ten years in federal prison.", "description": "A Texas federal grand jury indited a Texas mother and her daughter over an alleged fraudulent migrant family human smuggling scheme", "authors": ["Bob Price"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/12/GettyImages-591865008.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
