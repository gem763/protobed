There were the claims that American media was the \u201cenemy,\u201d and that the supposed conspiracy involving Biden and Ukraine also extended to right-wing bogeymen like George Soros. There was the notion that a \u201cdeep state\u201d had roped in its allies in the media to stifle the news about the billions of dollars supposedly flowing directly into Biden\u2019s coffers, all while the Obama administration threatened Ukraine with retribution if they didn\u2019t investigate Donald Trump himself.\n\nIn a bizarre year, this one was an exceptionally bizarre moment.\n\nBuried within Giuliani\u2019s claims, though, was a new reality with which Americans on both sides of the political aisle will have to contend moving forward. All of us\u2014in the U.S., in Kyiv, in Moscow and Beijing and elsewhere\u2014watched the president\u2019s personal lawyer go on television, admit that he pressured another government to open an investigation into a presidential rival, and did so with the effective blessing of the sitting president himself.", "description": "Kyiv may have said \u201cno,\u201d but Trump\u2019s personal lawyer has opened the floodgates for other governments to follow the president\u2019s bidding and investigate and throw dirt on his rivals.", "authors": ["Casey Michel"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568997997/190920-rudy-tease_yp02en", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
