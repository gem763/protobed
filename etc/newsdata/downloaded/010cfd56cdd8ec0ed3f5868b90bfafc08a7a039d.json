(AP) - The flood of 1937 hit the Greenup area hard. Vintage photos from around the local region show businesses submerged and homes abandoned to the mercies of an angry Ohio River.\n\nLifelong Greenup resident Mattie Coldiron remembers the flood through the eyes of a 6-year-old child at the family home in downtown Greenup. The single-story home where she and her father lived was engulfed in the flood, and the pair were forced to evacuate. When the waters receded, her father decided that he needed a two-story home on Main Street in Greenup.\n\nIt is a home Coldiron lives in to this day.\n\n\u201cI was born in the little house on the corner,\u201d Mattie Coldiron said, pointing from her porch down the City of Greenup\u2019s Main Street.\n\n\u201cDaddy bought this house after the \u201837 flood because he was going to have an upstairs. That house didn\u2019t have one, and the water went almost over the top of it. That house was the one he was raised in.\u201d\n\nThe home Coldiron has lived in since she was six has two bedrooms upstairs and a bath, but the downstairs could accommodate other bedrooms (which it once did) should she choose to rearrange its current layout. The porch, she pointed out, used to go around the home, and there were three small rooms on one side. This had to be removed due to damage, but the rest of the house is in good shape, Coldiron said.\n\nIt was shortly after they moved in that Coldiron\u2019s father decided to turn part of the house (the three downstairs rooms) into a Tourist Home. \u201cIt was during the marriage racket,\u201d Coldiron said with a laugh. \u201cEveryone was coming to Greenup to get married at that time because you didn\u2019t have to wait three days. It was before the war started (World War II) and everyone ran to Greenup to get married. A lot of them stayed in the house afterwards.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce the war got started, it was hard to get fuel, so it slowed down quite a bit. I remember my Daddy put a big round sign up that said, \u2018Closed for the Duration, or after Hitler\u2019s Funeral.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut during the several years that Coldiron\u2019s father ran the Tourist Home, she said that there were always people there. Many of the couples would show up, and her father would call the local preacher to come down and marry them.\n\n\u201cA lot them got married right there in the living room, and I would have to be a witness,\u201d Coldiron said. \u201cEven though I was only 6 or 7.\u201d Given the situation, she believes it is possible she has witnessed more marriages than anyone. She remembers the time fondly and said that it was a good time in her life.\n\nA lot of the patrons, Coldiron said, came from Ohio. Greenup had a ferry at that time, and many people would travel that route to Greenup. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many people actually got married or stayed here,\u201d Coldiron said. \u201cBut there were a lot of them, and they would show up at all hours of the day and night. Even when Daddy would put up a \u2018No Vacancy\u2019 sign, we would still have people knocking on the door in the middle of the night looking for rooms.\u201d\n\nAfter her father closed the Tourist Home, Coldiron said there was a big push to collect scrap metal. People would bring what they collected to the courthouse and drop it off, and she remembers she and her friends collecting all of the scrap metal they were able to find as well.\n\nHer father, she said, didn\u2019t reopen the Tourist Home after the war. But Coldiron herself stayed there even after she married and lives there today with fond memories of her childhood, friends and family, and all the visitors she has watched pass through the City of Greenup.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Independent, http://www.dailyindependent.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The flood of 1937 hit the Greenup area hard.
