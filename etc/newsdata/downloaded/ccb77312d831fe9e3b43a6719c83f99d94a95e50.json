GLOBAL MARKETS-Asia shares cheered by Sino-.U.S. trade progress\n\n* Asian stock markets : https://tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4\n\n* Nikkei futures rise, trade thin with Tokyo on holiday\n\n* Yen, bonds nurse losses on Sino-U.S. trade progress\n\n* Sterling rally pauses as EU summit looms over Brexit\n\nBy Wayne Cole\n\nSYDNEY, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Asian share markets pushed higher\n\non Monday as signs of progress in the Sino-U.S. trade standoff\n\nwhetted risk appetites, while pressuring safe-haven bonds and\n\nthe yen.\n\nLiquidity was lacking, however, with Japan off and a partial\n\nmarket holiday in the United States for Columbus Day. MSCI's\n\nbroadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan\n\nedged up 0.5%.\n\nAustralia's main index gained 0.9% and South Korea\n\nfirmed 1.3%.\n\nWhile Tokyo was on holiday, Nikkei futures were trading at\n\n22,105 compared with a Friday close of 21,798 in the\n\nNikkei index. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 also added\n\nanother 0.36% after jumping on Friday.\n\nSentiment had been boosted when U.S. President Donald Trump\n\noutlined the first phase of a deal to end a trade war with China\n\nand suspended a threatened tariff hike, though officials on both\n\nsides said much more work needed to be done. The emerging deal, covering agriculture, currency and some\n\naspects of intellectual property protections, would represent\n\nthe biggest step by the two countries in 15 months.\n\n\"The substance is more in the vein of an extension of the\n\ntruce \u2013 though that was the best the market could have hoped\n\nfor,\" said Tapas Strickland, a director of economics and markets\n\nat National Australia Bank.\n\n\"Still, it is unlikely the 'partial deal' will do much to\n\ngive certainty to firms investment and hiring decisions in the\n\nU.S. or elsewhere,\" he cautioned. \"As such it is still likely\n\ntrade uncertainty will weigh on economic activity, and the Fed\n\nwill cut rates to ward-off the headwinds.\"\n\nFutures imply around a 72% chance the Federal Reserve will\n\ncut interest rates at its meeting later this month. FEDWATCH\n\nBIG WEEK FOR BREXIT\n\nThe progress on trade was still enough to slug safe-haven\n\nbonds with yields on U.S. 10-year Treasury notes climbing 23\n\nbasis points last week to stand at 1.74% .\n\nThe yield curve also steepened as short-term rates were held\n\ndown by news the Fed would start buying about $60 billion per\n\nmonth in Treasury bills to ensure \"ample reserves\" in the\n\nbanking system. The rally in risk assets saw the yen ease across the board\n\nand the dollar was steady at 108.40 early on Monday after\n\nhitting a 10-week top around 108.61 on Friday.\n\nThe dollar fared less well elsewhere, partly due to a jump\n\nin sterling, and was last at 98.431 against a basket of\n\ncurrencies after losing 0.5% last week.\n\nThe dollar also dipped on the Chinese yuan to stand at\n\n7.0868 .\n\nThe pound was trading cautiously at $1.2608 having\n\nsurged to a 15-week high around $1.2705 on Friday on optimism\n\nBritain could reach a deal on Brexit with the European Union.\n\nHowever, officials from Downing Street and the EU said on\n\nSunday a lot more work would be needed to secure an agreement on\n\nBritain's departure from the bloc. The two sides will hold more talks on Monday ahead of a\n\nsummit of EU leaders in Brussels on Thursday and Friday.\n\nThe general improvement in risk sentiment saw spot gold ease\n\nanother 0.4% to $1,483.90 per ounce .\n\nOil prices steadied after jumping on reports an Iranian\n\nstate-owned oil tanker had been attacked in the Red Sea. O/R\n\nInvestors were also anxiously watching Turkey's incursion\n\ninto Syria as the White House threatened to impose heavy\n\nsanctions on Ankara. Brent crude futures were up 8 cents at $60.59, while\n\nU.S. crude rose 9 cents to $54.79 a barrel.\n\nAsia stock markets https://tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4\n\nAsia-Pacific valuations https://tmsnrt.rs/2Dr2BQA\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n\n(Editing by Jacqueline Wong)", "description": "GLOBAL MARKETS-Asia shares cheered by Sino-.U.S. trade progress", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEB6208D_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
