But if it happens regularly around your period, it\u2019s likely what experts often refer to as the \u201cperiod flu.\u201d\n\nWhile \u201cperiod flu\u201d is not a formal medical term or diagnosis, Dr Alyssa Dweck, Westchester-based gynaecologist and assistant clinical professor at the Mt. Sinai School of Medicine, knows exactly what I\u2019m talking about. \u201cMy patients complain about all kinds of different illness that seem to come about right before their period, and they\u2019re always cyclical,\u201d she says. It\u2019s common for women to experience flu-like symptoms and even a fever between ovulation and the start of their period.\n\nSo what\u2019s really going on with your body? Below, doctors weigh in on this period phenomenon and how to Get. Some. Relief. Already.\n\nCan your period make you feel like you have the flu?\n\nWell, you don\u2019t actually have the influenza virus, but your body is mimicking similar symptoms. \u201cMy feeling from a medical standpoint is that this is all part of PMS syndrome, which can have both physical and emotional symptoms,\u201d Dr Dweck says. Some of her clients\u2019 most common PMS complaints are all reminiscent of flu symptoms, including irritability, breast soreness, headaches, joint pain, and excessive fatigue.\n\nDr Dweck also points out that often times women with pre-existing conditions, like autoimmune issues or rheumatoid arthritis, will even experience exacerbation or a flare-up of their symptoms just before their period\u2014and then things get better after they menstruate. \u201cSo it does make you wonder, [even though] it\u2019s not in the literature if there\u2019s some sort of immune hit that occurs just before your period bringing these flu-like symptoms to life,\u201d Dr Dweck notes.\n\nThere are no studies that show your immune system is actually taking a hit. So you can just blame the hormonal rollercoaster that is PMS until there\u2019s more conclusive science on this.\n\nREAD MORE: 4 Reasons Why Your Period Is So Damn Heavy Right Now\n\nWhy does it happen for some people with periods but not others?\n\nOne word: hormones. \u201cIn the mid-portion of your cycle when you ovulate, your estrogen and progesterone levels start to surge, and they decline when you do not get pregnant and get your period,\u201d Dr Dweck explains. \u201cSo that precipitous decline, particularly in estrogen, is what causes a lot of the symptoms.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s not all (lucky you!). \u201cThe other thing that\u2019s going on as we get into our periods is that the uterus cranks out a chemical called prostaglandin,\u201d says Dr Jane Minkin, clinical professor in the department of obstetrics, gynaecology, and reproductive sciences at the Yale University School of Medicine.\n\nProstaglandin causes that annoying AF uterine cramping. It also causes the muscles to contract and can give you gastrointestinal discomfort and diarrhoea. According to Dr Minkin, \u201cprostaglandins can also make you feel like you have the flu and even give you a temperature.\u201d Fun, right?\n\nBut many women also change up their lifestyle habits before their period starts, Dr Dweck points out. For instance, you might up your sugar and salty snack intake, which can cause swelling and inflammation, she explains. And you may have increased water retention, which could lead to joint pain, Dr Dweck says. The effects of these diet and lifestyle changes right before your period can mimic flu-like symptoms too. So that\u2019s definitely something you want to keep in mind.\n\nREAD MORE: \u201cI Tried Out Livia \u2014 A Device That Promises To End Period Pain \u2014 And Was Pleasantly Surprised\u201d\n\nShould feeling sick before your period ever be a cause for concern?\n\nIn other words, is period flu\u2026dangerous?\n\nPeriod flu symptoms usually last between ovulation and the start of your period. When menstruation begins, both Dr Dweck and Dr Minkin generally see their patients\u2019 symptoms dissipate. So, in general, while you might feel icky, you\u2019ll be totally fine in a few days.\n\n\u201cIf your symptoms are so bad, physical or emotional, that they\u2019re interrupting with your day-to-day life or interfering with your relationship, then you need to get checked out,\u201d Dr Dweck says. There could be a different underlying issue at play, and the timing with your period is a coincidence. For example, maybe you have a thyroid disorder, which exhibits similar symptoms (excessive fatigue, weakness, muscle and body aches) Dr Dweck notes.\n\nAnd while prostaglandin can make you feel feverish, if you have an actual temperature of 101 or 102, that\u2019s not period flu \u2014 that\u2019s something else, Dr Dweck says. \u201cAnd if that\u2019s persistent, you should get that checked out.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: 7 Reasons You\u2019re Spotting The Week Before Your Period\n\nIf I do feel like crap around my period, how can I find some relief?\n\nThese are the best cures for those pesky flu-like symptoms:\n\nPop a NSAID. These are technically known as prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors. \u201cThey block the making of more prostaglandins,\u201d Dr Minkin says. \u201cSo the key there is taking them early when you start feeling achy, and fluish.\u201d These pills include aspirin and Advil.\n\nThese are technically known as prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors. \u201cThey block the making of more prostaglandins,\u201d Dr Minkin says. \u201cSo the key there is taking them early when you start feeling achy, and fluish.\u201d These pills include aspirin and Advil. Move around. Exercise helps everything (but you already knew that, right?). \u201cExercise has been shown over and over again to help with menstrual cramps and PMS symptoms overall,\u201d Dr Dweck says. Aerobic exercise will bring you right back to life by also reducing water retention and excess fluid in your joints.\n\nExercise helps everything (but you already knew that, right?). \u201cExercise has been shown over and over again to help with menstrual cramps and PMS symptoms overall,\u201d Dr Dweck says.

Your estrogen levels decline when you get your period, as you learned. So taking birth control can be a huge help. \u201cBirth control pills keep your hormone levels steady throughout the month by preventing ovulation,\u201d Dr Dweck says.\n\n\n\nYour estrogen levels decline when you get your period, as you learned.

Instead of upping your caffeine intake to stay awake or eating more junk food (because: cravings), which can create inflammation that leads to flu-like joint pain, try drinking tea (it\u2019s naturally anti-inflammatory). And next time you want to go in on that entire bag of potato chips, try a snack lower in sodium instead.\n\nIf no intervention is really working for you and you keep feeling horrible when flow is comin\u2019 to town, speak with your gynaecologist. They can do a proper workup and help you feel A-okay when your period comes your way.\n\nThis article was originally published on www.womenshealthsa.co.za\n\nImage credit: iStock", "description": "", "authors": ["Alexis Jones"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7927/3fa3a33be0944a489cbeee2daebd877c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
