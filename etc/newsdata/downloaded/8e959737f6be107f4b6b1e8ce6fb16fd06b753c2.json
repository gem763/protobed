Maguire is the first witness in the Democrats\u2019 formal inquiry into whether to impeach President Trump.\n\nMaguire will testify about the explosive whistleblower complaint that the Justice Department directed him to keep from Congress, in apparent violation of the law, and several new developments in this developing scandal will sharpen the questioning that he\u2019ll face.\n\nFirst, The Post reports extraordinary new details about the whistleblower complaint. As you know, the complaint involves a July 25 call in which Trump pressed Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to interfere in a U.S. election by investigating the role that Joe Biden, a likely general-election opponent, played in a fake scandal that Trumpworld invented out of nothing.\n\nAs the Post investigative team reveals, the whistleblower complaint focuses on that call, but it has a lot more: It paints a picture of efforts by Trump and his lawyer Rudy Giuliani to pressure Ukrainian officials that were much broader and more sustained than we knew.\n\nThere\u2019s also this, from a person who has read the complaint:\n\nThe complaint also alleges a pattern of obfuscation at the White House, in which officials moved the records of some of Trump\u2019s communications with foreign officials onto a separate computer network from where they are normally stored, this person said. The whistleblower alleges that is what officials did with Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Zelensky, an action that alarmed the intelligence community inspector general and prompted him to request that the White House retain records of the Zelensky call, the person who read the complaint said.\n\nThe New York Times further fleshes out this notion of a much broader pressure campaign on Ukraine by reporting on a second call Trump placed to Zelensky, just hours after Zelensky was elected on April 21:\n\nHe urged Mr. Zelensky to coordinate with Mr. Giuliani and to pursue investigations of \u201ccorruption,\u201d according to people familiar with the call, the details of which have not previously been reported.\n\nAt this point, the Times reports, Giuliani had already been actively trying to pressure Ukraine to investigate Biden. It\u2019s clear Giuliani had been doing all of this at Trump\u2019s behest, because Giuliani has admitted that he consults with Trump about everything he does on this front.\n\nSo what we have now is that the campaign involved multiple calls by Trump to Zelensky, as part of a much broader effort by Trump and Giuliani to press Ukraine to interfere in a U.S. election on Trump\u2019s behalf \u2014 and on top of that, White House officials tried to hide records of calls he made as part of this effort.\n\nImportantly, all of that is in the whistleblower\u2019s complaint, and even worse, when the inspector general of the intelligence community read that complaint, he grew \u201calarmed\u201d enough to demand that the White House retain records of the key July 25 call.\n\nThis further underscores the seriousness of keeping all this from Congress. Indeed, after Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the chair of the Intelligence Committee, read the complaint, he commented that the Justice Department\u2019s role in blocking it from Congress \u201cthrows the leadership of the department into further ill repute.\u201d\n\nAt Thursday\u2019s hearing, Maguire will be asked about his role in all of this \u2014 and also the role that Attorney General William P. Barr and the Justice Department played in it.\n\nQuestions for Maguire\n\nAt this point, it\u2019s important to recall that the complaint was referred to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution. Legal analyst Rick Hasen argues that Trump\u2019s pressure on the Ukrainian president might amount to soliciting a thing of value from foreign sources, a campaign finance crime. But the Justice Department declined to prosecute without even mounting a full investigation.\n\nSo it will be reasonable to ask Maguire whether he thought that Trump\u2019s pressure \u2014 not just in the July 25 call, but in other episodes recounted by the whistleblower \u2014 amounted to possible criminality.\n\nBarr\u2019s role in all of this should also come under scrutiny. The details of the call show Trump directing Zelensky to talk not just to Giuliani, but also to Barr, about investigating Biden. Though the Justice Department has denied any such role, here we have Trump casually suggesting that the U.S.\u2019s chief law enforcement official should play a lead role in collaborating with a foreign power to investigate his political opponent.\n\nWhat does Maguire think of that?\n\nAlso, it\u2019s worth asking Maguire whether Barr\u2019s role in all of this should have led the attorney general to recuse himself from any role in deciding that the complaint didn\u2019t merit further Justice Department action. And how deeply was Barr involved in that decision?\n\nThe biggest question of all\n\nBut in the end, perhaps the biggest question relates to Maguire\u2019s role, as DNI, in defending our elections from outside interference. We know that the whistleblower, an intelligence officer, saw Trump\u2019s actions as a threat to our elections. We also know that multiple other national security officers were working furiously behind the scenes to prevent Trump from mounting that pressure on Zelensky \u2014 so they, too, apparently saw this as a threat in similar terms.\n\nThis threat is twofold, by the way. It concerns both the pressure campaign directed against Zelensky and the efforts documented by the whistleblower to cover that campaign up.\n\nSo: Does Maguire view what the whistleblower complaint details about Trump\u2019s conduct as a serious threat to our free and fair elections?\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: The Trump-Zelensky readout is a devastating indictment of our president\n\nMax Boot: The rough transcript is devastating.
