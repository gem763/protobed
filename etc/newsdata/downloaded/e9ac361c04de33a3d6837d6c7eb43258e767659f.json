(Hillary Johnstone/CBC News)\n\nAs for the Ottawa pilot project, which already has council's approval, Landry said it will look at the benefits of mobile versus fixed photo radar, as well as the cost and potential financial benefits of the cameras.\n\nStaff haven't settled on precise locations for the first speed cameras, Landry said. They will use the information gathered from the pilot project to determine how to best curb speeding near schools, he said.", "description": "The City of Ottawa says it's ready to roll out photo radar as soon as it gets the green light from the province, expected later this fall.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4841603.1564416868!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/photo-radar-calgary.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
