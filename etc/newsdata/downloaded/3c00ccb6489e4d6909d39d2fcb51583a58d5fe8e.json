It comes disassembled, to allow any new owner full customisation.\n\nYou can build your multi-tool up as a four-, six- or eight-bit configuration.\n\n\n\nTraditional bike multi-tools attempt to squeeze a lot of bits in a fixed structure and that often makes the tool too wide to get into difficult to reach parts of the bike frame or componentry. The ability to make this tool narrower or wider, by adding or removing bits, means you won\u2019t have an issue.\n\nDIY bike mechanics can also rearrange the individual bits to enable a specific Allen key or Torx bit to engage those difficult to reach screws or bolts.\n\nThe Touch Bike Parts multi-tool is also comparatively longer than most bike tools and that generates better leverage, to loosen those stubborn bolts and screws which might have started corroding.\n\n\n\nThe multi-tool also features a very open design with large tolerances. This allows a rider to easily pry open the various tool bits for use, especially when wearing full fingered cycling gloves.\n\nThe Touch Bike Parts multi-tool features rails are made from 6061 aluminium, whilst the tool bits are all stainless steel and feature tumble polished tips. It looks good and should last for years.\n\nAvailable online and in select bike shops, the Touch Bike Parts customisable multitool retails for R900.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "The ergonomics were specifically designed to enable ease of use with cycling gloves.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7841/a0bfde707d6444a5aede903207b87b7c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
