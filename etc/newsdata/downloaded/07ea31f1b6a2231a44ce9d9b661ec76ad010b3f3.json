Facebook Dating will exist inside Facebook\u2019s main app, but users will be able to pull photos from their Instagram profiles into their dating profile, and by the end of the year be able to publish their Instagram Stories to their dating profile as well.\n\nFacebook daters can also use their Instagram followers for a feature called \u201cSecret Crush,\u201d which could match them with another Facebook Dating user from their Instagram network. Users can\u2019t be matched with one of their Facebook friends simply by listing them as a \u201csecret crush\u201d\u2014 an effort to avoid embarrassing or awkward connections. They can, however, match with a friend if both people add each other. The secret crush list had been limited to a user\u2019s Facebook friends, but has been expanded to include Instagram contacts as well.\n\nWhile the two services have always shared resources and data behind the scenes, including information gathered for targeted advertising, Facebook and Instagram have historically operated independently. Those lines began to blur in early 2018 as Facebook executives demanded Instagram help spur growth through product changes that would drive more users to Facebook\u2019s core app from Instagram. Facebook pushed Instagram to find more ways to link users back to their Facebook profile, for example, while simultaneously scaling back its effort to increase Instagram usage from within the Facebook app.\n\nInstagram co-founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger ultimately left Facebook last year after clashing with Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg over Instagram\u2019s autonomy. Since then, multiple Instagram teams have been restructured to report to Facebook, employees have been given Facebook email addresses to replace their Instagram ones and Facebook is working behind the scenes to connect the two apps\u2019 messaging services.\n\nDespite the changes, Instagram\u2019s product has always felt independent from Facebook\u2019s core app. It\u2019s not uncommon for users to be unaware that Facebook owns and operates Instagram, too. Facebook dating will likely be a small feature within the broader Facebook service, but the symbolism of combining the products on the consumer level is notable, especially given the other changes happening at Facebook behind the scenes.\n\nFacebook launched dating in May 2018\u2014shortly after the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal\u2014with the idea that the social network\u2019s mission to bring people closer together should include romantic relationships. The company declined to say how many people use the feature, but has expanded it to 20 countries, including Brazil, Mexico and Vietnam, in the past 16 months. The service is free.\n\n\u201cRight now it\u2019s a really feel-good mission, it\u2019s just connecting people,\u201d said Nathan Sharp, the product executive leading Facebook\u2019s dating efforts. \u201cThere are no plans for ads and no plans for subscriptions.\u201d\n\nFacebook\u2019s efforts could become significant competition for Match Group Inc., which owns the currently most-popular dating site, Tinder. With its new service, Facebook could potentially leverage its extensive web of connections among people and data on relationships as well as its massive financial resources to compete with rivals.\n\nMatch shares tumbled as much as 7% Thursday after Facebook\u2019s announcement. They are still up 91% this year. Such gains prompted an ill-timed upgrade from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, which wrote in a note published earlier in the day that Match was seeing \u201csustained momentum\u2019\u2019 in the third quarter, and that it has \u201cfurther room to grow.\u201d Facebook shares gained 2%.\n\nSharp says Facebook has put a lot of thought into the dating feature and its privacy implications\u2014an effort Facebook wants to highlight given the company\u2019s repeated privacy missteps. Data from a user\u2019s dating profile, for example, won\u2019t be used for targeted advertising, Sharp said. If you use Facebook dating, your Facebook friends won\u2019t be alerted or matched with you, he added. (Unless you are matched with your \u201csecret crush.\u201d)\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Facebook is\u00a0launching\u00a0its dating service in\u00a0the U.S., allowing users to combine Facebook and Instagram elements to create a dating profile.", "authors": ["Kurt Wagner"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/facebook-secret-crush.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
