One of them has to step up, but who will decide to leave Ramsay Street?\n\nScarlett (Christie Whelan Browne) has Ned (Ben Hall) completely fooled and sees an opportunity to get exactly what she wants and could lead Ned to doing something he will most definitely regret. Will she manage to come between Ned and Yashvi (Olivia Junkeer)?\n\nAnd one couple finds themselves at the centre of a sex tape scandal that could ruin Lassiters!\n\n1. The Brennans\u2019 bad news means huge changes\n\nAre the Brennans about to say goodbye? (Picture: Channel 5)\n\nMark, Chloe and Aaron are beside themselves over Fay\u2019s disappearance, but just when they lose hope they learn she\u2019s been found and their fear turns to joy. But their happiness is short lived. It becomes clear her Huntington\u2019s has progressed significantly and her health is going rapidly down hill. She needs round the clock supervision and it\u2019s proving too much for Piper and Tyler, so someone else is needed to help with her care. It gets Mark thinking \u2013 what\u2019s left for him in Ramsay Street? Perhaps it\u2019s time for him to leave\u2026\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Ned cheats with stalker Scarlett?\n\nScarlett is getting exactly what she wants (Picture: Channel 5)\n\nScarlett is gutted to realise Ned is pining after Yashvi and decides she needs to up her game. When she finds she has a free house she tells Ned her stalker ex is back and he comes to her rescue. It\u2019s all a bit weird though when the police reveal they can\u2019t find any evidence.\n\nNed, however, doesn\u2019t twig, although Bea certainly has her suspicions considering she barely survived Scarlett\u2019s last attempt at winning Ned. Scarlett\u2019s game is nearly thwarted when Kyle confirms to Yashvi that Ned is missing her, forcing Scarlett to sneak into Ned\u2019s house to delete Yashvi\u2019s text before he sees it. She finds him asleep on the couch in his bathers, so she slips down to her bikini and joins him. But who should come over and see them apparently all wrapped up together? Yashvi of course. Chalk that up to a win for weirdo Scarlett.\n\n3. Sex tape scandal hits Ramsay Street!\n\nPaul and Terese arrive back to chaos at the same time as Amy and Kyle return from their steamy night alone at Lassiters. Roxy and Harlow are at each other\u2019s throats for one and Paul and Terese come back to Earth with a bump as they catch up on what\u2019s been going on for the last few weeks.\n\nThey\u2019re interrupted by a call from Lassiters calling Terese to urgently come and sort a matter out. When she arrives at the hotel she discovers the plumber has found a secret hidden camera \u2013 aimed at the bed Amy and Kyle have spent the night in! Is this a remnant of Ryan Prescott\u2019s reign of terror? As Terese tries to investigate without getting the police involved she thinks she\u2019s sorted it all. That is until we see a mystery person watching a video of Kyle and Amy together getting frisky. Who is spying on them and why have they made a secret sex tape?!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Mackenzie\u2019s heartbreak\n\nMackenzie faces a whole world of hurt thanks to her dad (Picture: Channel 5)\n\nMackenzie has been on a roller coaster ride trying to find her dad, and when Shane gets a sudden lead things look hopeful. After a slight disappointment when it appears the lead has gone nowhere, Shane is shocked when Grant suddenly gets in touch.\n\nMackenzie is overcome with nerves when she finally gets the chance to meet her dad and though it\u2019s a rocky start, they manage to work through it to the point she\u2019s willing to give him a chance. Later, Mackenzie makes a huge decision and invites her dad to the school formal. It\u2019s a huge step in their relationship and it feels like they\u2019re getting back on track. But her joy is short lived when the dance turns into a disaster; not only does a rejected Hendrix kiss someone in front of her, she\u2019s gutted to realise Grant is a no show.\n\n5. Ned\u2019s reeled in\n\nBea for one seems to be able to see through Scarlett, and after Yashvi dumps Ned for catching him sleeping semi naked with Scarlett, she feels she has to act. Finn tries to tell her to keep out of it, but there\u2019s just something about it all that doesn\u2019t sit right \u2013 Ned would never cheat on Yashvi. She decides to confront Ned about the whole sorry affair, but before she can Scarlett interrupts with the latest from her \u2018stalker\u2019. She\u2019s found a photo of herself in her locker with the eyes scratched out. Ned is completely taken in but Bea most definitely smells a rat. Could Bea be the key to bringing unhinged Scarlett down? Or could she once again be putting herself in harm\u2019s way?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Pierce\u2019s public shame\n\nHendrix gets his own back on his dad (Picture: Channel 5)\n\nHendrix is fuming after being rejected by Mackenzie and forces a kiss on Harlow, to the horror of his dad Pierce. Pierce is disgusted at Hendrix\u2019s lack of understanding about the issue of consent over the kiss, Hendrix clearly has no respect for women, and Pierce\u2019s horror is compounded when he learns of the damage Hendrix has done to a hotel room. So Hendrix does what he does best, goes into his childish mode, gets drunk and grabs the mic \u2013 telling everyone at the formal what a terrible father Pierce has been. Will anything stop this kid?!\n\nScenes air from Monday 7th October at 1.45pm and 5.30pm on Channel 5.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Here's what's ahead on Neighbours next week.", "authors": ["Katie Baillie"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/neighbours-week-41_1570190065.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
