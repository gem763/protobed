Amazon\n\nFilling your kitchen with cooking tools and gadgets is fun, but it can get expensive.\n\nThese days, you can find lots of quality kitchen supplies at budget prices, though some are better than others.\n\nThe Vremi Mixing Bowl Set ($18.99) is cute, affordable, and has more than enough pieces for all of my mixing and measuring needs. I've yet to feel the need for a more expensive option.\n\nOutfitting a kitchen can be an expensive pursuit. There are some essentials everyone needs, and depending on your cooking abilities and lifestyle, there are plenty of other cooking tools and kitchen gadgets you'll probably want, too. But, if you're not a pro chef or are living by a budget, you probably don't want to spend a fortune on mixing bowls, knives, and the like. And luckily, you don't have to.\n\nIt's not hard to find cheap kitchen and home goods these days, but not all are created equal. I've been thoroughly impressed with my $19 Vremi Mixing Bowl Set, which contains 13 pieces that are all you need for mixing and measuring. If you're already sold, you can head to Amazon to buy it now. If you want to learn more about the product, keep reading for a quick breakdown of all the specs.\n\nWhat you get\n\nFor less than $20, you'll get four measuring cups, five measuring spoons, two mixing bowls, a colander, and a strainer. Everything in this set can be stacked onto each other. The nesting style maximizes your space for easy storage, as everything fits into each other perfectly.\n\nThe products come in a fun rainbow of colors, and everything included is made of BPA-free plastic. Plus it's all dishwasher safe for easy clean-up.\n\nWhy you'll love it\n\nThis set can be used for meal prep, serving, washing, mixing, measuring, and more. While 13 pieces may not seem like enough for all of your kitchen needs, I've found the set to be beyond sufficient.\n\nOn top of the utility, the quality is great \u2014 especially at this price point. After multiple runs in the dishwasher, nothing has changed and every piece looks good as new. But remember, this is still plastic, so if you treat it like a stainless steel mixing bowl you can probably expect some damage over time.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThis set of mixing bowls, measuring cups, and measuring spoons isn't particularly unique, but at just $18.99, it's a great value. It's space-saving, versatile, easy to clean, and affordable \u2014 all great things if you ask me. In my experience, and according to some 700 happy Amazon shoppers, the products hold up well over time. The cute, colorful aesthetic doesn't hurt either.", "description": "This under $20 mixing bowl set is practical, cute, and affordable.
