Now I\u2019m running, jumping on my right leg that was injured so I\u2019m really happy for that.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great. When you are a player you want to have the contact with the ball, with the guys on the pitch, the routine of training. It\u2019s what I love to do.\n\n\u201cThe games, the atmosphere at Anfield, the away games, all games when I watch on the TV, I just think how I want to play, I want to be there, I want to help my team-mates. I\u2019m looking forward (to being back), I can\u2019t wait any more!\u201d\n\nAdrian, who only joined Liverpool four days before the Norwich game, replaced Alisson in that match, and has subsequently helped them win the Super Cup \u2013 making a save in the penalty shoot-out that sealed the triumph \u2013 and claim victory in each of their Premier League games.\n\nAlisson said: \u201cI think the boys are doing very well, all the team (and) Adrian especially.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a special guy who came late in the season, he just came and shows everyone his value, not just as a player but as a person and that is the more important thing.\n\n\u201cHe is doing very well on the pitch. I have peace to recover in a proper way so it\u2019s better for everyone.\u201d\n\nPA Sport also contributed to this report", "description": "Liverpool\u00a0goalkeeper Alisson Becker has handed Jurgen Klopp a boost by revealing he is\u00a0\u201cnearly there\u201d as he nears a return from injury.
