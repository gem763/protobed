As soon as his target is fulfilled, he will say \u2018I am a good guy and I will adhere to international pressure\u2019. And all of this will be done under the umbrella of the alleged peacemaker Vladimir Putin. It is a nightmare for the Kurdish people and, alas, predictable.\u201d\n\nThe other winner, L\u00e9vy asserts, is Iran. The practical consequence of the withdrawal of US troops is to aid its effort to establish a corridor of military control from Tehran to Beirut.\n\nIn a speech aired on Iranian television on Monday, Qassem Soleimani, commander of the Quds Force of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, boasted that Iran has now created \u201cterritorial continuity\u201d by connecting Iran, Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.\n\n\u201cIran has completed it goal,\u201d L\u00e9vy says. \u201cIsis, which was on the edge of being defeated, has regained its head. That the word of America is becoming worthless is the source of great anxiety for Israel, and the US has no regional ally that can now sleep quietly.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday the US vice-president, Mike Pence, announced that Turkey had agreed to a five-day ceasefire in Syria,to allow Kurdish fighters to leave the strip of territory where they have set up their administration. Trump tweeted that it was \u201ca great day for civilization\u201d, but the deal essentially gives Turkey what it had sought to achieve with its incursion and places no obligation on Erdo\u011fan to withdraw his forces.\n\nL\u00e9vy, no enemy to dressing simplistic ideas in shiny, philosophical costume, has made two films about the Kurdish resistance: Pershmerga and The Battle of Mosul, and he argues that when the US abandons the Kurds it abandons its own values.\n\n\u201cThis is an act of suicide for America directed by Donald Trump and we Europeans are taken in the process.\n\n\u201cFor the principles of America, for the values of America, for the creed of America, this is suicide. Whatever Trump says in the next hours, days or weeks, his words have no value, and it will take time for American words again to have value. For the moment they are worth zero.\u201d\n\nL\u00e9vy is no stranger to controversy himself. He has written extensively about his love for America, has come under fire for his support of France\u2019s burqa ban, his \u201cunconditonal love\u201d of Israel and claimed a role in encouraging the overthrow of Libya\u2019s Muammar Gaddafi, throwing the country into violent chaos.\n\nEqually controversial has been his criticism of rape cases against Roman Polanski and Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former managing director of the IMF. L\u00e9vy claimed Strauss-Kahn, a friend, had been \u201cthrown to the dogs\u201d.\n\nBut he is deeply concerned over America\u2019s retreat from its role on the world stage.\n\nL\u00e9vy says his friends in America, from both sides of the political spectrum, \u201care ashamed of what is happening\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have seldom seen such a betrayal. Of course in all wars you have blood on your hands. Generally it is the blood of your enemies. In this case it is the blood of your friends.\u201d", "description": "The French philosopher condemns Trump for withdrawing troops: \u2018I don\u2019t know which of his justifications is more stupid\u2019", "authors": ["Edward Helmore"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac96fe3a9825d8ec32a499f82eaaaf45392d23ee/0_295_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=63bc7312d7c1ce4b9bc3b02960ea1ab7", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
