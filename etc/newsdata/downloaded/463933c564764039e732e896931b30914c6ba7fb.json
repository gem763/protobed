Protest spokesman Simon Oosterman says \"we are in the middle of a climate emergency.\" \"The thing is, ANZ isn't just lending money, they are encouraging the fossil fuel industry,\" he says. \"The reason why we are here is because we believe that all life has the right to thrive. Some people call us protesters, I think we are protecters. \"We've got a really simple choice, either we make history, or we're history.\" The protesters then stage a die-in for all the people suffering as a result of climate change.
