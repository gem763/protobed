These Brave Athletes Are Standing Firm.", "url": "https://heritage.org/gender/commentary/womens-sports-are-facing-crisis-these-brave-athletes-are-standing-firm", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-07-02", "downloaded_at": "2019-09-02 07:02:55.017142+00:00", "text": "The U.S. women\u2019s national soccer team recently earned a historic victory on the world stage, but not all is well for girls who might want to follow in its footsteps.\n\nIn fact, girls sports has become one of the most tragic battlefields of the culture war.\n\nIn Connecticut, high school track runner Selina Soule recently joined two other girls in filing a civil rights complaint with the Department of Education. Soule lost out on potential college scholarships and recruitment opportunities after she lost a race\u2014and a spot in the state championship\u2014to two transgender, biological males.\n\nThese girls argue that the Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference has violated Title IX\u2019s prohibition on sex-based discrimination by allowing biological males to compete in female competitions.\n\nConnecticut isn\u2019t the only state to go down this path. The nation\u2019s capital has adopted a similar policy allowing boys to compete with girls, prompting the all-girls Oakcrest School to withdraw from its athletic conference over concerns about \u201csafety and fairness.\u201d\n\nThis issue has united conservatives and progressives alike who believe that biological sex determines important social realities. Telling girls they must compete with boys and share locker rooms and bathrooms with boys is wrong, they say. It\u2019s not fair, and it fails to account for the privacy and safety concerns many women have in intimate facilities.\n\nHaving to compete against boys isn\u2019t the only obstacle women are beginning to face. What if you had to wear a certain design on your jersey that endorses a message unrelated to your sport, your team, or your ability to play in order to participate?\n\nThis is what happened to Jaelene Hinkle, who was invited to play soccer for the U.S. women\u2019s national team but withdrew, citing her reluctance to compete in a jersey adorned with LGBT pride colors.\n\nLast summer, Hinkle was interviewed by the Christian Broadcasting Network about her life, her passion for soccer, and her Christian faith. A clip from that interview resurfaced a few days ago on Twitter.\n\nThe clip documented Hinkle\u2019s decision to withdraw from competition for the women\u2019s national team in 2018\u2014she did not feel that she could wear a jersey bearing pride colors in good conscience. The jersey change was not made by the players, but by higher-ups in the organization in a nod to Pride Month celebrations.\n\nAshlyn Harris, a goalie for the team, wrote in response, \u201cHinkle, our team is about inclusion. Your religion was never the problem. The problem is your intolerance and you are homophobic. You don\u2019t belong in a sport that aims to unite and bring people together. You would never fit into our pack or what this team stands for.\u201d\n\nBut is Hinkle really intolerant for declining to display a message that she disagreed with? Is she homophobic for not wanting to actively celebrate conduct that she and many others of the same faith, other faiths, and even no faith might find objectionable?\n\nThese are not fair conclusions. Hinkle didn\u2019t force anyone else to withdraw, or to not wear the jerseys or even change the jerseys.\n\nAs she explains well in the short Christian Broadcasting Network interview, she felt that she could not in good conscience don a jersey that celebrated behavior with which she disagreed. She was there to represent her country. She wanted to play for those stars and stripes that, at their best,\u00ad\u00ad unite all Americans\u2014not the rainbow that often divides them.\n\nHinkle now plays defender for the North Carolina Courage. It\u2019s a fitting team name for her.\n\nAs an American, she has the legal right to live by her faith and her moral convictions. The First Amendment to our Constitution protects the free exercise of religion and the freedom of speech.\n\nBut the efficacy of these protections will ultimately depend on public opinion. If people don\u2019t value religious freedom or free speech\u2014if they believe only certain kinds of religious expression or speech are worth protecting\u2014then there\u2019s only so much the law can do.\n\nCulture informs how judges apply the law, and in the long term, we can\u2019t expect these protections to last if culture turns squarely against them.\n\nAs if to underscore this hostility, Fox Sports commentator Rachel Bonnetta tweeted in response to Hinkle\u2019s leaving the team, \u201cWhy\u2019d they even give this girl a mic?\u201d\n\nWhy\u2019d they even give this girl a mic? \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 \u2014 Rachel Bonnetta (@rachelbonnetta) July 15, 2019\n\nThey gave her a mic because they knew she had a story to tell. They knew she had a story that was worth listening to. Hinkle is an example for people of faith, and for young girls across America who might face similar challenges in the years ahead.\n\n\u201cIf I never get a national team call-up again, that is just part of his plan, and that\u2019s OK. And maybe this was why you were meant to play soccer.\u201d", "description": "The U.S. women\u2019s national soccer team recently earned a historic victory on the world stage, but not all is well for girls who might want to follow in its footsteps.\u00a0\n\nIn fact, girls sports has become one of the most tragic battlefields of the culture war.", "authors": ["Monica Burke", "Commentary By", "Former Research Assistant", "Summer Member Of The Young Leaders Program At The Heritage Foundation"], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_optimized/public/images/2019-07/GettyImages-1153079466.jpg?itok=JkVvjCkl"}
