Zarda, Bostock v. Clayton County, and R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. EEOC, are about whether employees can legally be fired for their sexual orientation or gender identity. Harris Funeral Homes involves Aimee Stephens, who was fired from her job because, she says, her boss disapproved of the fact that she is transgender. The employees in Zarda and Bostock are gay men who say they were fired because of their sexual orientation.\n\n\u201cFor LGBTQ workers and for LGBTQ people in general,\u201d the court\u2019s decision in the cases \u201cwill be a declarative and transformative statement of our legal rights under federal law,\u201d Chase Strangio, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union who will be arguing in the Harris Funeral Homes case on behalf of Stephens, told Vox. A decision against the workers could affect not just employment but housing, health care, and education as well and even contribute to the epidemic of violence against trans women of color.\n\nMany feminist groups, including the National Women\u2019s Law Center, have filed amicus briefs in support of Stephens and the other employees in the cases. But as Katelyn Burns reported at Vox last month, some anti-trans groups that purport to be feminist, including one called the Women\u2019s Liberation Front, are siding with the employer in Harris Funeral Homes, arguing that giving anti-discrimination protections to trans women will harm cis women.\n\nHowever, advocates for Stephens and the other employees say the opposite is true. The three cases before the court on Tuesday actually threaten the civil rights of everyone in America, regardless of gender identity or sexual orientation. If the court finds in favor of the employers, the advocates say, it wouldn\u2019t just erase the protections that allow LGBTQ people to pursue careers and support their families \u2014 it would essentially destroy sex discrimination law as we know it.\n\nThe three cases will have an enormous impact on the lives of LGBTQ Americans\n\nThere is no federal law protecting people from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, as Vox\u2019s Ian Millhiser explains. Moreover, only 22 states have such protections for sexual orientation and 21 have them for gender identity.\n\nBut historically, LGBTQ workers have been able to seek legal recourse under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bans discrimination on the basis of sex. In particular, they\u2019ve been able to point to the 1989 Supreme Court case Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, which found that employers cannot discriminate against employees based on sex stereotypes \u2014 for example, a boss cannot fire a woman for being, in the boss\u2019s view, too masculine.\n\nOver the years, many lower courts have found that discrimination against LGBTQ people at work is essentially discrimination based on sex stereotypes. For example, \u201ca trans person by definition does not meet expectations of how a man or woman should be \u2014 that is, to have been assigned a particular sex at birth,\u201d Strangio explained.\n\nBut President Trump\u2019s Department of Justice, in a Harris Funeral Homes brief, is asking the Supreme Court to find that employers can discriminate based on sex stereotypes as long as they do so for both men and women. \u201cThey want to create a world where it would be lawful to fire someone for being insufficiently feminine, as long as you could show you would fire someone for being insufficiently masculine,\u201d Strangio said.\n\nHarris Funeral Homes is making a similar request itself, as Irin Carmon reports at New York magazine. In a brief, the employer argues that it \u201cwould have responded to a female employee who insisted on dressing as a man while working with grieving families the same way it responded to Stephens.\u201d Essentially, Harris Funeral Homes wants the right to fire someone if the way that person dresses is not in keeping with gender roles as Harris Funeral Homes defines them.\n\nIf the court rules in their favor, the implications for LGBTQ rights are immense. LGBTQ people already face high rates of employment discrimination, Strangio said. \u201cYou already have people that are pushed out of the workplace because of bias, and it\u2019s already hard to prove employment discrimination even where you are protected,\u201d he explained. A decision against the workers would only make matters worse.\n\nAnd the decision could have implications far beyond the workplace, experts say.\n\n\u201cThe way that the federal civil rights laws have developed is that these statutes look to each other,\u201d explained Sunu Chandy, legal director at the National Women\u2019s Law Center. Courts and federal agencies will look at how Title VII is interpreted when they are interpreting Title IX, which governs sex discrimination in education, for example. That means LGBTQ people could stand to lose not just their jobs as a result of the three cases at issue Tuesday, but also potentially their housing and access to health care and education as well.\n\nThose losses could create a cumulative effect in people\u2019s lives, with employment and housing discrimination pushing them into homelessness, which in turn would leave them vulnerable to violence, Strangio said: \u201cThere is a direct correlation between the outcome of this case and the epidemic of violence that is already being experienced against black trans women.\u201d\n\nThe cases could also change the face of sex discrimination law\n\nFor these reasons and more, many medical and legal groups have filed amicus briefs in support of Stephens and the other employees in the cases, as Burns notes. But some groups that purport to be feminist are siding with the employers. A group called the Women\u2019s Liberation Front (WoLF) has filed an amicus brief in Harris Funeral Homes on behalf of Stephens\u2019s employer, arguing that \u201cStephens is a man\u201d who \u201cwanted to wear a skirt while at work.\u201d\n\nWoLF told Vox in a statement that \u201cthe redefinition of the word \u2018sex\u2019 to mean \u2018gender identity\u2019 would have myriad harmful effects on women and girls, and women and girls as a distinct category deserve civil rights protections.\u201d As Burns notes, WoLF is part of a larger group of \u201ctrans-exclusionary radical feminists\u201d (they prefer the term \u201cgender-critical feminists\u201d) who believe that trans rights are a threat to cisgender women.\n\nBut advocates on behalf of Stephens and the other employees in the cases before the court say that actually, women and girls \u2014 and, in fact, Americans of all genders and sexual orientations \u2014 will lose protections if the employers get their way.\n\nIf the court rules that discrimination on the basis of sex stereotypes is legal, anyone who doesn\u2019t conform to an employer\u2019s view of femininity or masculinity could be at risk, the advocates say. Women, in fact, would likely bear the brunt of this new reality, Chandy said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s often women who are held to these very tight and strict gender norms, and if there\u2019s going to be a change in the law so that sex stereotyping is allowed, you can be sure that that is going to harm women\u201d whether they\u2019re cis or trans, she explained. For example, \u201ca cisgender woman who wants to wear her hair short\u201d could legally be fired if discrimination based on sex stereotypes became legal.\n\nThough women might experience a disproportionate impact, it\u2019s hard to imagine a group in society who wouldn\u2019t be affected by such a change. Cisgender, straight men could be vulnerable to discrimination if they have primary responsibility for their children, said Suzanne B. Goldberg, director of Columbia Law School\u2019s Center for Gender and Sexuality Law and the co-author of an amicus brief on behalf of the employees in the three cases before the court on Tuesday.\n\nWhat\u2019s left of sex discrimination law if employers can fire people for being insufficiently masculine or feminine? \u201cI think that\u2019s the right question,\u201d Goldberg said. \u201cIf the court were to reject the LGBT employees\u2019 claims here, there might not be much left to sex discrimination law under Title VII.\u201d\n\nOf course, the court could try to issue a narrower ruling than the one the Trump administration is asking for, arguing that Title VII protects straight, cisgender Americans but not LGBTQ people. However, advocates for LGBTQ rights and gender equality in the workplace say there\u2019s no real way to do this that makes legal sense.\n\n\u201cSex discrimination is illegal,\u201d Chandy said, \u201cand it\u2019s not credible to say that sexual orientation or gender identity are separate and apart from sex discrimination.\u201d\n\nShe gave herself as an example. \u201cI have a picture of my spouse, a female spouse, at my desk, that I\u2019m looking at.\u201d If an employer were to fire her for having such a picture but allow a man to keep a picture of his wife at his desk, \u201cthat\u2019s absolutely sex discrimination.\u201d\n\nThe broad implications of the case make it \u201cincredibly tragic\u201d that purportedly feminist groups are siding with the Trump administration, Strangio said. \u201cIf you start carving out and narrowing the scope of federal civil rights protections, that\u2019s going to hurt you too,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we truly are pitted against each other, then we all lose out in the end.\u201d\n\nListen to Today, Explained\n\nAfter a sleepy spring term, the Supreme Court of the United States is back and looking to weigh in on abortion, immigration, and LGBTQ rights.\n\nLooking for a quick way to keep up with the never-ending news cycle?
