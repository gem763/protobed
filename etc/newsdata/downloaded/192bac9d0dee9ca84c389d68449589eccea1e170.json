Sign up here.\n\nThe rights of LGTBQ workers in the United States could hinge on one man: conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch, President Donald Trump\u2019s first appointee to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Supreme Court heard arguments Tuesday in three cases that all deal with the same question: Are LGBTQ employees protected by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, a federal law that blocks workplace discrimination \u201cbecause of sex\u201d? In his questions to lawyers, Gorsuch repeatedly suggested that his answer might be yes \u2014 and if it is, his vote to join the four liberal justices could help the employees win.\n\nThe justices first heard arguments in Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia and Altitude Express Inc. v. Zarda, a pair of cases so similar they were bundled together. Both Daniel Zarda, a skydiving instructor who died in 2014, and Gerald Bostock, a child welfare services coordinator, sued their respective employers after they were allegedly fired for being gay.\n\n\u201cBut isn\u2019t sex also in play here?\u201d\n\nBostock and Zarda argued that their firings violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, even though the law doesn\u2019t explicitly mention sexual orientation or gender identity. Past Supreme Court cases have found that the Civil Rights Act\u2019s ban on sex discrimination also bars employers from discrimination that\u2019s based on gendered steretoypes \u2014 like, say, the stereotype that men are only attracted to women.\n\nAt one point during arguments Tuesday, a lawyer representing Bostock and Zarda\u2019s employers tried to draw a line between discrimination on the basis of somebody\u2019s sex and discrimination on the basis of their sexual orientation.\n\n\u201cBut isn\u2019t sex also in play here?\u201d countered Gorsuch. When the lawyer tried to respond, Gorsuch interrupted, \u201cAnd isn\u2019t that enough?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn what linguistic formulation would one say that sex, biological gender, has nothing to do with what happened in this case?\u201d the conservative justice added later in the day.\n\nGorsuch also signaled his agreement with the very argument the lawyers for the two gay men were trying to make. He suggested to the U.S. solicitor general that if somebody is fired over their sexual orientation, their sex is \u201cat least one contributing cause.\u201d\n\nThe other new conservative on the bench, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, stayed relatively quiet throughout the arguments. He once asked a question about the \u201cliteral meaning\u201d versus \u201cordinary meaning\u201d of the term \u201cbecause of sex\u201d but did not clarify what either of those phrases meant to him.\n\nWhile the more-liberal justices didn\u2019t go easy on the attorneys representing the gay men, they\u2019ll probably rule in their favor, given that they all ruled to legalize same-sex marriage. But Anthony Kennedy was the swing justice in that 5-4 decision in 2015, and he retired in 2018. On Tuesday, Gorsuch was the only member of the court\u2019s right wing who signaled any willingness to budge.\n\nThe second hour of arguments Tuesday moved on from Title VII\u2019s relationship with sexual orientation and focused instead on gender identity for another case: R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes, Inc. v. EEOC. An employee at a Michigan funeral home, Aimee Stephens, sued when she was fired from her job shortly after revealing to her coworkers that she was transgender. If she had been assigned female at birth, she\u2019s arguing, her employer would have no problem with her living as a woman.\n\nGorsuch, once again, showed some apparent sympathy for the LGTBQ petitioners. \u201cI\u2019m with you on the textual evidence. It\u2019s close, OK?\u201d Gorsuch, a textualist, told an attorney for Stephens. \u201cIt\u2019s close. The judge finds it very close.\u201d\n\nBut he also seemed concerned, like many of the justices, that a ruling for Stephens could bring sweeping changes to a nation where only about half of the states have enacted protections for LGTBQ workers. That\u2019s a heady proposition for a man who recently remarked that the founders of the United States did not want \u201cnine old people in Washington, sitting in robes, telling everybody else how to live.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, should he or she take into consideration the massive social upheaval that would be entailed in such a decision?\u201d Gorsuch asked the lawyer, apparently referring to himself in the third person. The better remedy, he suggested, might be found through the legislature, not the judiciary.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a question of judicial modesty,\u201d Gorsuch said.\n\nCover image: In this Sept. 4, 2019 file photo, Justice Neil Gorsuch speaks during an interview in his chambers at the Supreme Court in Washington.
