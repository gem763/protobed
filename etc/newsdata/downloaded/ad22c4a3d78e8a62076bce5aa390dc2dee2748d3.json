Biden\u2019s left eye appeared to fill with blood during Wednesday\u2019s CNN town hall on \u201cthe climate crisis,\u201d raising questions about his health.\n\nMr. Biden, 76, took questions from the audience and moderator Anderson Cooper during his 30-minute segment as part of the seven-hour town hall, even as his eye grew redder.\n\nWhile the Democratic presidential frontrunner didn\u2019t seem to notice the eye bleed, the episode created a stir on social media.\n\nMr. Biden underwent surgery after he suffered two cranial aneurysms in 1988 while serving in the Senate. In his 2007 book \u201cPromises to Keep,\u201d he said doctors gave him a 50% chance of surviving the surgery.\n\nHis campaign offered no immediate public comment. Mr. Biden was one of 10 Democratic presidential primary contenders to appear during the seven-hour climate marathon.\n\nUh, hey guys.
