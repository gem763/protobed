As drivers apparently were heeding advice to be extra careful, police said they were not immediately seeing more traffic accidents as a result of the power outage that has affected up to 2 million Californians.\n\n\"It may be too early to say,\" said Officer John Fransen, spokesman for the California Highway Patrol's Golden Gate Division, \"but as of right now, there doesn't seem to be an increase.\"\n\nVehicles back up on Highway 12 as traffic signals remain dark during a power outage on Oct. 9, 2019, in Boyes Hot Springs, Calif. More\n\nThe blackouts were ordered Wednesday and Thursday by Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison in windy areas as a precaution against power lines that could spark wildfires.\n\nThe move immediately complicated lives for anyone behind the wheel. Some gas stations were unable to power pumps, leaving motorists to search other places for fuel. Street lighting was out. And motorists were being reminded to treat any intersection with a non-functioning traffic light as a four-way stop.\n\nNot all vehicles could stay on the move in blackout areas. Waste Management, the trash hauler serving Shasta County, said it would be unable to collect the garbage Thursday from 1,200 rural residents. Spokesman Paul Rosynsky said it was \"due to the inability to fuel our collection trucks because of the PG&E power outage.\"\n\nCars and trucks that pulled into a normally busy Simi Valley gas station in Ventura County found yellow tape surrounding the pumps and a handwritten sign on the door informing customers of the closure early Thursday afternoon.\n\nBut the outage didn't last long. Just after 2 p.m. PST, the lights came back on. Minutes later, an employee was unfurling the yellow tape. Cars and trucks pulled in and drivers grabbed a drink inside or filled up their tanks.\n\nOne special concern: tunnels that no longer had lighting.\n\nMore: 'PG&E clearly hasn\u2019t made its system safe.' California lawmakers slam utility amid widespread power outage\n\nCaldecott Tunnel, which connects Oakland and Contra Costa County\u2019s populous suburbs, like Walnut Creek, was threatened with closure.\n\nAt Caldecott, Caltrans had to install generators Wednesday morning and switched power over at midday, before power was cut Wednesday evening.\n\nAt the Tom Lantos Tunnels, which carry traffic between San Francisco and coastal cities to its south, authorities had to borrow power from one of two grids connected to the tunnel to ensure the lights remained on for the Wednesday morning rush hour, Caltrans spokeswoman RocQuel Johnson said.\n\nOn Tuesday night, city officials in nearby Half Moon Bay feared the tunnels would be closed on Wednesday, but by 7 a.m. they got word that a solution had been worked out overnight.\n\n\u201cSo far we haven\u2019t had to lose power on any tunnels and tubes, so we\u2019ve been able to keep them open and keep traffic flowing,\u201d said Bart Ney, spokesman for Caltrans' San Francisco Bay Area office.\n\nPublic transportation was generally operational in the Bay Area, though one Caltrain station in Morgan Hill lost power. Trains were still running but travelers could not buy tickets from vending machines or swipe their fare cards at the station.\n\nIn San Leandro, a bayside suburb south of Oakland, officers were doing their best to move motorists safely through the city.\n\n\"We've had an increased police presence in anticipation of the power outage since Tuesday morning,\" said city spokeswoman Alice Kim. \"And they've been working around the clock ever since.\"", "description": "Stoplights were out at intersections and getting gas or charging up an electric car took some planning.
