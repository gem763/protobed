The impact from a higher sales tax could further weigh on the economy.\n\nJapan rolled out a twice-delayed increase in the sales tax to 10% from 8% on Oct. 1, a move considered critical for fixing the country's tattered finances.\n\nWhile the government has taken steps to ease the burden on consumers by offering vouchers and tax breaks, there are fears the higher tax could dent spending and tip the economy into recession.\n\nWeak wage recovery is also a concern for private spending.\n\nSeparate data showed real wages adjusted for inflation fell for an eighth straight month in August, which could hurt consumption following the sales tax hike.\n\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe pledged on Friday to deliver \"all possible steps\" if risks to the economy intensified, signalling his readiness to boost fiscal spending if this month's sales tax hike triggers a sharp downturn in growth.\n\nExpectations have also grown that the Bank of Japan will implement additional stimulus after its governor Haruhiko Kuroda signalled the central bank won't rule out loosening monetary policy as early as its Oct. 30-31 meeting.
