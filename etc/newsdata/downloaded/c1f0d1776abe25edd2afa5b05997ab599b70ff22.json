Vassell was an offender serving a sentence for serious firearm offences.\n\n\u2018On one occasion when Barnes was on duty, she was in a cell for 19 minutes engaging in inappropriate behaviour with Vassell.\n\n\u2018She hid from her colleague when he checked the cell on two occasions, clearly showing she recognised what she was doing was wrong.\n\n\u2018However, this was not a one-off incident.\n\n\u2018Rather, it was a pattern of behaviour in which she allowed a prisoner to have the use of a mobile phone and sent him repeated messages, some of which were of a sexual nature.\n\n\u2018Barnes\u2019 behaviour clearly falls into the category of willful misconduct, and to such a degree that it amounted to an abuse of the public\u2019s trust.\n\n\u2018She will now have to face the consequences of her actions in relation to future employment opportunities.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNotorious prisoners to have served time at Belmarsh jail include Soham murder Ian Huntley and hate preacher Abu Hamza.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
