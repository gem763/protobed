The infamous clash between George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore in 2000 was settled by a mere 537 hotly disputed votes. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, won last year by just 32,000 votes out of more than 8 million ballots cast.\n\nFloridians now find themselves at ground zero in the voting rights battle after the approval last year of Amendment 4, a ballot measure that allowed former felons \u2014 other than those convicted of murder or serious sex offenses \u2014 to register to vote once their punishment is complete.\n\nBilled as a way to end a racist, restrictionist policy dating from the state\u2019s Jim Crow days that impeded blacks from voting, Amendment 4 passed by 64.6%, with support from Republicans, Democrats and independents.\n\nBut that result plunged the state into a raging debate over how to define a complete sentence of punishment.\n\nThe Republican-controlled state Legislature in Tallahassee approved a proposal this year stipulating that punishment is complete when all court fines, fees and legal restitution to victims are paid. Opponents such as the American Civil Liberties Union and the NAACP likened the proviso to the revival of a poll tax from the segregationist era.\n\nSupporters of the Legislature\u2019s move said lawmakers had a responsibility to implement the amendment in orderly fashion with little direct instruction from the text.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here today because we have a tough problem to solve,\u201d state Rep. James Grant, a Tampa Republican and one of the main architects of the legislation, told Politico in March.\n\nThe Florida Court Clerks & Comptrollers, a statewide, nonprofit member association, estimated that more than $1 billion in felony fines are on the books from 2013 to 2018 alone, with payback rates at less than 20% a year. One analyst estimated that the Legislature\u2019s move would still block voting rights for up to 80% of ex-felons who have completed their prison time.\n\nMr. DeSantis, who opposed Amendment 4, signed the legislation with an eye on fighting it later, local pundits say. At the time, he wrote a letter saying the law \u201cconfirms that the amendment does not apply to a felon who has failed to complete all the terms of his sentence.\u201d\n\nPaying it back\n\nThe spotlight then fell on the complexity of paying fines, especially restitution to victims.\n\nFlorida has no central database for such payments, which vary widely across its 67 counties. Adding to the confusion, fines range from a few hundred dollars to massive million-dollar awards and can be collected while felons are in prison or out on parole. Payments move through intermediaries such as court clerks or the state Department of Corrections.\n\nThe Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, a nonprofit Amendment 4 supporter, has estimated that 500,000 of 1.4 million former felons would be prevented from registering to vote because of the law. The liberal Brennan Center for Justice said most of those affected are likely to be black and have low incomes.\n\nThe ACLU, NAACP and League of Women Voters filed a lawsuit against the Legislature\u2019s move that was heard in federal court this week.\n\nAt a hearing in downtown Tallahassee, state attorneys argued that the Legislature\u2019s requirements were reasonable interpretations of the language in Amendment 4.\n\nBut U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle, an appointee of President Clinton, strongly disagreed and accused lawmakers of creating a \u201cmess\u201d that has left former felons afraid to register to vote.\n\n\u201cWhat we have now is an administrative nightmare,\u201d Mr. Hinkle said Tuesday.\n\nWith a ruling expected in the coming weeks and Florida\u2019s presidential primary set for March 17, Democratic and Republican Party operatives are monitoring the proceedings closely.\n\nPollsters say the injection of former felons onto the voter rolls only adds more uncertainty to a politically unpredictable state. Florida has roughly 4.4 million registered Republicans, about 4.6 million Democrats and nearly 3 million independents.\n\nLocal media have noted that the Trump 2020 presidential campaign is already building a more sophisticated network than it had in 2016 to deal with the murky situation.\n\n\u201cThe Florida electorate is fluid and in a constant state of reinvention,\u201d said Mr. Amandi, who specializes in Hispanic voting patterns. \u201cThe political perspectives of Latinos and African-Americans, Generation X, millennials, retiring baby boomers, hard-line conservative Cubans \u2014 these all react to multiple variables.\u201d\n\nBut, he added, \u201cit is easy to see why the state\u2019s Republican leadership is slow-rolling Amendment 4\u2019s implementation. Most of those who register because of it will be Democrats.\u201d\n\n\u2981 This article is based in part on wire service reports.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
