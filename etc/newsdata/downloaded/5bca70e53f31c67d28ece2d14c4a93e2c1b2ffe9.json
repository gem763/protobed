Literally just walked out of a screening of Joker. Way too terrifying to be there with all this going on the way the movie glamorizes gun violence and mental health issues.'\n\nBoth Phoenix and director Todd Phillips have defended the film, with the actor saying he trusts audiences to know the difference between right and wrong.\n\nPhillips recently revealed he was surprised by the criticism of Joker because he took measures to instill 'real-world implications' of violence not often found in cartoon films and television shows.\n\nJokes: Despite receiving critical acclaim, social media monitoring FBI agents in the US have warned it could inspire screening attacks from incels - a term which refers to men who are 'involuntarily celibate' and blame their situation on women\n\nThe 48-year-old director revealed during the New York Film Festival on Wednesday night that his depictions of violence were a needed departure from the glorification found in other action movies.\n\nPhoenix portrayed the character as bullied man Arthur Fleck who \u2014 after living on the outskirts of society \u2014 snaps and begins to take revenge on those who have wronged him.\n\n'That's the surprising thing to me,' he said at the movie's East Coast premiere. 'I thought, isn't that a good thing, to put real-world implications on violence?'\n\nPhillips feels as though he has acted responsibility as a creative to show audiences what the real implications of violence are.\n\n'Isn't it a good thing to take away the cartoon element about violence that we've become so immune to? I was a little surprised when it turns into that direction, that it's irresponsible,' he said.\n\n'Because, to me, it's very responsible to make it feel real and make it have weight and implications.'\n\nDespite receiving critical acclaim, social media monitoring FBI agents in the US have warned it could inspire screening attacks from incels - a term which refers to men who are 'involuntarily celibate' and blame their situation on women.", "description": "The R-rated supervillain flick smashed October opening-day box office records after taking home $39.9 million in domestic ticket sales on Friday, is on pace to take in a\u00a0$92 million weekend total.", "authors": ["Ciara Farmer For Mailonline", "Keith Griffith For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/16/19335588-0-image-a-15_1570288158975.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
