But while playing co-op or local competitive games is relatively easy when you\u2019re sitting on the couch with a console, local multiplayer can be more difficult for PC gamers, whose platform of choice is primarily tailored for solo and online multiplayer experiences.\n\nLuckily, Valve has begun beta testing an all-new Steam feature, Remote Play Together, that lets users play locally-based multiplayer games online with others. As per the official announcement on Steam\u2019s community page, Remote Play Together allows between two and four players (sometimes more, in select cases) to:\n\n\ufeffPlay local multiplayer games with Steam Friends online.\n\nStream video, audio, input and voice between players.\n\nUse your own controllers, or share control of the keyboard & mouse.\n\nPlay together across PC, Mac and Linux.\n\nRemote Play Together only requires the host player to own the game on Steam, so your friends can play along with you even if they don\u2019t have a copy in their Steam library. A surprisingly long list of games already supports the feature and Valve says plenty more are on the way. Some games may not work perfectly at first \u2014 this is still an unfinished feature, after all \u2014 but bugs and compatibility issues will hopefully be addressed in routine updates while Remote Play Together is in beta phase.\n\nHow to play Steam games using Remote Play Together\n\nScreenshot: Brendan Hesse, Steam settings menu", "description": "We live in a golden age of gaming, one where we can easily access tons of games from every era, genre, console and niche you could possibly think of.
