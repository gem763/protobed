So they started working with us in a much more constructive way.\u201d\n\nMr. Sanders says his opponents came to their senses and joined him. But a close examination of the Vermont lawmaker\u2019s record as mayor shows that at times he also went to them, working with Republicans, police and business on key issues facing the community\u2014sometimes to the frustration of his liberal allies.\n\n\u201cThe city was run in the 1980s as a coalition between what you would now call the progressives and the Republicans,\u201d said John Franco, assistant city attorney in the Sanders administration. \u201cBernie is a fiscal conservative. The saying in Vermont is he\u2019s tighter than the bark on a tree.\u201d\n\nA supporter of Bernie Sanders makes a last-minute appeal on the streets of Burlington in 1983.

What emerges is a picture of an executive who had the same goals for governance as he does today, but won favor with Republicans when his administration audited the city\u2019s finances, joined with the business community on a controversial development project and once sided with the police and factory workers over protesters.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll listen to the points of the other person. And as long as the goal is not just to, you know, feather the nests of the wealthy,\u201d he will work with people, Mrs. Sanders said.\n\nIt is a period that the senator doesn\u2019t often discuss on the campaign trail. His deal-making past could help him reach out to centrist voters but could also alienate supporters who are looking for an uncompromising candidate to upend the system. (On a recent episode of \u201cThe View,\u201d Mr. Sanders struggled to name a Republican he worked with who wasn\u2019t dead or retiring.)\n\nLouie Manno, a radio host here in the 1980s, said Mr. Sanders did a \u201cpretty good job\u201d as mayor because his governing was less radical than his campaigns.\n\nMr. Manno is a supporter of President Trump, but he said he isn\u2019t worried about a Sanders presidency upending the country: \u201cIf he became the president of the United States, we\u2019d still be a free-market economy, we would still have an army, we\u2019d still have a Second Amendment.\u201d\n\nBernie Sanders is sworn in as mayor of Burlington in 1981.

Ms. Baird remembers Mr. Franco turning to her and proclaiming: \u201cWelcome to the revolution.\u201d\n\nBut in his first term in office, one key initiative of Mr. Sanders\u2019s administration was more quotidian: Cleaning up the city\u2019s finances, a move that earned trust from some Republicans. Mr. Franco said they wanted to prove to skeptics they knew how to govern.\n\nThe Sanders administration audited the city\u2019s finances and found a surplus of nearly $2 million, which it invested into capital improvements.\n\nMr. Sanders also formed some alliances with the business community over the Burlington waterfront, which local developers wanted to revamp. Mr. Sanders said during his campaign that the city wasn\u2019t for sale. But once in office, he decided to back a commercial development plan.\n\nThe Sanders campaign headquarters in Burlington.

This is one of the really big inconsistencies about Bernie,\u201d said Rick Sharp, who runs Burlington Segway tours and opposed commercial development of the waterfront.\n\nMr. Sanders again found himself on opposite sides of progressive activists in June 1983, when hundreds of antiwar activists protested General Electric Co. for making military weapons at a plant here. Greg Guma, a progressive journalist who was involved in the antiwar movement, remembers telling Mr. Sanders of the plans to protest.\n\n\u201cHe was very upset with us,\u201d said Mr. Guma, who wrote a book about Mr. Sanders\u2019s tenure as mayor. Mr. Sanders told the group to demonstrate at congressional offices instead, Mr. Guma said.\n\nMr. Sanders followed up with a call to tell Mr. Guma that if he protested at the plant, he would be arrested. Mr. Guma went anyway. Eighty-eight people were arrested, including Mr. Guma, who went back to the protest after getting out of jail and was arrested again. Mr. Sanders observed the arrests and didn\u2019t intervene, Mr. Guma said.\n\n\u201cMy view was you had hundreds and hundreds of jobs that were decent-paying union jobs. You shut them down here, they\u2019re just going to move someplace else,\u201d Mr. Sanders told The Wall Street Journal.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Do you think Bernie Sanders could work across the aisle if he were to be elected president? Join the conversation below.\n\nSome of those same protesters who stood outside the General Electric plant more than three decades ago now stand outside Mr. Sanders\u2019s Senate office on Church Street to protest his support for basing F-35 fighter jets at the Burlington Airport. As with GE, Mr. Sanders says he supports the F-35 program because of the local jobs involved.\n\nWhile Mr. Sanders did occasionally make surprising alliances, he still had plenty of critics\u2014especially establishment Democrats. Mr. Sanders beat an incumbent Democrat for the post and that first year the Board of Aldermen attempted to block his every move and his cabinet. Despite working with Republicans on occasion, he had a GOP opponent every election cycle.\n\nErnie Pomerleau, a Republican developer, said he worked with the Sanders administration at times. But he always tried to sink Mr. Sanders when election time came around. Mr. Pomerleau said that one campaign cycle, he informed Mr. Sanders that his friends had been encouraging him to be Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign manager.\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d asked Mr. Sanders.\n\n\u201cEverybody I have supported has lost,\u201d Mr. Pomerleau replied.\n\nMr. Sanders laughed.\n\nDuring his time as mayor, Bernie Sanders formed some alliances with the business community over the Burlington waterfront.
