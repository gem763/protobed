Every move AJ Hinch made was rewarded.\n\nFor Washington, it was a home stand to forget. They didn't do the little things that have brought them so much success over the season. In 27 innings, they managed just three runs - a stat that must improve if they are to win the World Series.\n\nThe Nationals return to Texas hoping to repeat their success of game two, as star pitcher Stephen Strasburg once again faces Astros ace Justin Verlander. It is a brilliant match-up of two of the sport's greats, and now has the added spice of the World Series being on the line.\n\nGame six on Tuesday could be the best of the series. Victory for Houston and they are champions, and a win for Washington will mean winner takes all in game seven.", "description": "The Houston Astros are closer to a second World Series title in three years after beating the Washington Nationals 7-1 in game five.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/1867A/production/_109426999_gettyimages-1183856391.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
