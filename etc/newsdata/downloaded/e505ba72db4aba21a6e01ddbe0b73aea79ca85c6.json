Barr to fill the position again, Trump chose a prominent Republican lawyer with extensive government experience to run the Justice Department.\n\nBarr has publicly supported some of Trump\u2019s criticisms of the Mueller investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. It\u2019s not known how Barr would reflect those positions in his interactions with the investigation.\n\nBut when Donald Trump announced Jeff Sessions\u2019s nomination as his attorney general, the position was seen as a reward for Sessions\u2019s early endorsement of the president\u2019s 2016 campaign. And the president wanted loyalty in return.\n\n\u201cThe only reason I gave him the job,\u201d Trump said, \u201cwas because I felt loyalty. He was an original supporter. He was on the campaign.\u201d\n\nMany people predicted that Trump indeed would have a loyal foot soldier as head of the Justice Department.\n\nBut the president\u2019s wish was not realized. Feeling betrayed when Sessions recused himself from the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, Trump turned Sessions into a regular target for his Twitter assaults.\n\nTrump ended their fraught relationship by asking for Sessions to resign after the 2018 midterm election and replacing him with Matthew Whitaker. Whitaker is known as a critic of the Mueller investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s possible collusion with Russia.\n\nThe Whitaker appointment provoked questions among Trump critics, including George Conway, husband of the president\u2019s counselor, Kellyanne Conway, about its constitutionality and its wisdom.\n\nHowever, others welcomed the alliance between Trump and Whitaker. Margot Cleveland, an adjunct law professor at the University of Notre Dame, argued that \u201cthere is nothing nefarious about the (acting) attorney general loyally serving the president of the United States.\u201d\n\nFor me as a legal scholar who has studied controversies surrounding the role of prosecutors and prosecutorial decisions, all of this has a familiar ring.\n\nIndeed, throughout American history, there have been different visions of the role of the attorney general and his or her relationship to the president.\n\nPart-time official\n\nThe office of attorney general is not mentioned in the Constitution. It was created when the First Congress passed the Judiciary Act of 1789.\n\nThat act called for the appointment of a person \u201clearned in the law, to act as attorney general for the United States.\u201d It said that the attorney general\u2019s duty \u201cshall be to prosecute and conduct all suits in the Supreme Court in which the United States shall be concerned, and to give his advice and opinion upon questions of law when required by the President of the United States, or when requested by the heads of any of the departments.\u201d\n\nThe act gave the attorney general limited duties relating strictly to matters of law. In fact, the attorney general was to be a part-time official, carrying out quasi-judicial functions, but responsible to the president who appointed him.\n\nTwo days after the Judiciary Act became law, George Washington appointed Edmund Jennings Randolph to be the first attorney general of the United States.\n\nRandolph had been a delegate to the Constitutional Convention and Virginia\u2019s attorney general. He was \u201clearned in the law,\u201d but he was also Washington\u2019s confidante and close political ally, having served as the general\u2019s chief of staff and personal secretary in 1775.\n\nDuring Randolph\u2019s term as attorney general, Washington relied on him for support on matters that went well beyond the formal duties of his office. In one such instance, Randolph helped Washington handle foreign relations with France and Great Britain and, in others, advised him on his dealings with Congress.\n\nThus, \u201cfrom the beginning,\u201d writes law professor Susan Low Bloch, \u201cthere were questions about whom the attorney general represented, who should and would control the incumbent attorney general, and what it means to represent the \u2018interests of the United States.\u2018\u201d\n\nCarving out a role\n\nAs other scholars have noted, the role of the attorney general has been variously defined by the occupants of that office.\n\nSome have followed in Randolph\u2019s footsteps, serving as close political allies of the president. Others have seen themselves as different from the rest of the president\u2019s Cabinet and kept their distance from the president. They acted primarily as defenders of the rule of law.\n\nExamples of the first type from the early years of the country include President Andrew Jackson\u2019s attorney general, Roger Taney, who worked hand-in-hand with Jackson to end funding for the Bank of the United States.\n\nJackson subsequently nominated Taney to the Supreme Court, where he wrote the decision in the infamous Dred Scott case.\n\nIn the 20th century, President Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s attorneys general regularly helped him in political battles. Some of those battles involved the Justice Department and some did not.\n\nFor example, Robert Jackson, who served as FDR\u2019s attorney general in 1940 and 1941 before being elevated to the Supreme Court, played a key role in the effort to circumvent the Neutrality Act in order to provide war equipment to Great Britain before America\u2019s entrance into World War II.\n\nOther close political allies of the president who appointed them include Robert Kennedy, who was appointed at age 35 by his brother, President John F. Kennedy, and widely criticized as unqualified for the job. President Reagan\u2019s second attorney general, Edwin Meese, was a longtime friend of Reagan\u2019s.\n\nSo common is this tendency to appoint friends and supporters to be attorneys general that, since FDR, many presidents have chosen their campaign manager or their party\u2019s national chairperson to be attorney general of the United States. Examples include J. Howard McGrath, who served under President Truman, and Herbert Brownell, attorney general under President Eisenhower.\n\nAttorneys general who have tried to eschew a clearly political role and be bureaucratic servants of the rule of law include, in the early 19th century, William Wirt.\n\nWirt was attorney general from 1817-1829 under Presidents James Monroe and John Quincy Adams. He insisted that the attorney general should not be drawn into partisan activities and should adhere to what he called \u201cthe strict limits prescribed for\u2026 [that office] by law.\u2019\u201d\n\nTwentieth-century exemplars of this more independent role include Calvin Coolidge\u2019s attorney general, Harlan Fiske Stone, and Edward Levi, who served under President Gerald Ford.\n\nBoth of them came to office in the wake of scandals. Stone took office after the Teapot Dome scandal and Levi after Watergate. Each restored integrity to the Justice Department by instituting new guidelines designed to limit political interference in its work.\n\nThroughout American history, when presidents have appointed political cronies to be attorney general, they were looking for people only to help them pursue a policy agenda. President Nixon\u2019s efforts to enlist Attorney General John Mitchell in the Watergate cover-up and get one of Mitchell\u2019s successors, Elliot Richardson, to fire the Watergate special prosecutor stand out as important, but rare, exceptions.\n\nOther presidents have not expected or asked their attorneys general to shut down investigations or protect them from possible criminal liability.\n\nBut that is exactly what Trump\u2019s vision of the attorney general\u2019s role seemed to entail. Like Nixon, he wanted more than a political ally. What he wanted from his attorney general posed a serious threat to the rule of law. With his appointment of Barr, perhaps that will change.\n\nThis story has been updated to reflect the nomination of William P. Barr as attorney general.", "description": "President Trump has been criticized for the appointment of political allies as attorney general.
