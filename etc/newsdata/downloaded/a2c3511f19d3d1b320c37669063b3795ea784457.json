The venue is within the imposing building that has been known for decades as the Valentino Palazzo.\n\nOnce you enter the building you walk through what feels like miles of corridors, lined by literally hundreds of framed magazine covers.\n\nPresumably it was once known as something else; it dates back centuries, after all. But given it\u2019s been a temple of glamour for decades, who cares? Valentino, founded way back in 1960, by Mr Valentino and his lifelong friend and business partner, Giancarlo Giammetti, is Rome.\n\nTo reach the inner sanctum, one must cross a courtyard, past the monumental bronze of a fragmented head the pair long ago commissioned from Polish sculptor Igor Mitoraj. Because you can frame it beautifully through the arch from the street, it is a much photographed attraction, despite plenty of competition in the city of Caesar, La Dolce Vita and Roman Holiday.\n\nOnce you enter the building itself and climb immediately to the piano nobile \u2013 the first floor is always the grandest in an Italian palazzo \u2013 you walk through what feels like miles of corridors, lined by literally hundreds \u2013 hundreds \u2013 of framed magazine covers, mixing the old era and the new; Vogue, Elle, W, Vanity Fair stretching back for years.\n\nPierpaolo Piccioli in his trademark black T-shirt. Getty Images\n\nOh look, there\u2019s a baby Cindy Crawford in Valentino. And then there\u2019s her baby, the model Kaia Gerber, in Valentino by Pierpaolo Piccioli. There\u2019s a teenage Naomi Campbell, then Queen Naomi next to row upon row of actual European royalty on the covers of Amica, Oggi, \u00a1Hola! and Hello.\n\nHoused above are the ateliers where the magic happens: white, light, high-ceilinged rooms, overseen by those mature ladies in traditional white lab coats, who appeared on the catwalk, and staffed by others young and old, male and female, all of them cutting, stitching, patchworking and ironing (lots of ironing) in the process of creating clothes from cloths of gold, turquoise, pistachio and rose.\n\nOn a tailor\u2019s dummy, positioned up on a table, there\u2019s a gown made entirely of squares of flamingo-pink moir\u00e9, held together just by a single stitch to every corner. The craftswoman wielding the needle removes the pin she has clasped between her teeth and, with a huge smile, announces she\u2019s been working on it for weeks. (2010 hours, to be precise. They keep track.)\n\nOf course the grandest room of all, back on the first floor, is what was once Mr Valentino\u2019s office. The first time I ever came here \u2013 it must have been the early \u201990s \u2013 there was such a sense of drama, with mad little pug dogs darting around like court jesters getting under everyone\u2019s feet. It\u2019s calmer now, more democratic. Mr Valentino always kept his distance behind a gilded table (still here, I notice, although it does not look like it gets much use).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPierpaolo's daughter Benedetta Piccioli, Naomi Campbell, Valentino Garavani and Gwyneth Paltrow at the Valentino Haute Couture Fall/Winter show as part of Paris Fashion Week on July 03, 2019 Getty Images Europe\n\nPiccioli and I, instead, sit in a pair of low-slung mid-century modern chairs. The art has changed \u2013 I guess the Hockneys and the Warhols were shipped to the French chateau or ski chalet in Gstaad \u2013 replaced by large canvases by artists whose names I don\u2019t recognise, which Piccioli says is fine because they are not well known, art-as-investment not being his thing. He stretches out his sneakered feet as we move on to politics, behaving as if he has all the time in the world.\n\n\u201cThese are tough times,\u201d he is saying as we talk about little Greta Thunberg (the teen activist whose protests outside the Swedish parliament have ignited youthful climate change protests across the world). He is aware of what goes on beyond this ivory tower. He has a real life, children in their late teens and early 20s to keep him on point, plus he travels to work each morning on a busy commuter train.\n\nWhile he was born in Rome, Piccioli\u2019s family home is in the provincial seaside town of Nettuno, where he himself grew up, an hour south of the Italian capital. His mother ran a small boutique, his father worked in the office of a local business. He moved back to Rome to study literature while his then girlfriend/now wife read law, then switched to Istituto Europeo di Design to study fashion.\n\nHe has talked in the past of feeling like an outsider; posh to his seaside mates, straight in the world of fashion, etc. It\u2019s a balance that seems to have kept him grounded. That said, while the morning train ride is to beat Rome\u2019s notorious morning traffic, he gets chauffeured back home every night.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to do clothes, I\u2019m doing fashion,\u201d he states. \u201cFashion means delivering my values through my job.\u201d He believes clothes have a special power that speaks louder than words. \u201cMy ideas have more relevance if they come through clothes. I feel that if you create an image which reflects how you think, of course it\u2019s more difficult to do it, but if it works, it really works. I try for something delightful for the soul. I try to bring romance. You can be romantic and assertive.\u201d\n\nLady Gaga in Valentino at the Golden Globe Awards in January. Getty Images\n\nThus, in the face of growing racism in Italy, especially against those seeking sanctuary by crossing the Mediterranean, he likes to cast in his shows such beauties as the South Sudanese-Australian Adut Akech, whose early life was spent as a refugee in Kenya. \u201cI think that we all need hope, we need joy. I don\u2019t feel that you really need to be loud to say something relevant. You can whisper, and sometimes, it arrives more deeply.\u201d\n\nOur chat meanders through diversity, gender politics, inclusivity. He staged his cruise collection this past May on Fifth Avenue, New York, out on the street so everyone could see it. \u201cI don\u2019t like dividing the world into genders, or something stupid. But I divide the world in people I like, people I don\u2019t,\u201d he adds.\n\nHe can be blunt. He wore a \u201cF---k Donald Trump\u201d baseball hat on a recent trip to Russia, despite Moscow\u2019s legions of Valentino fans being somewhat more likely to be on the side of the American President\u2019s mate, President Putin, given the high price of the clothing and what you need to be worth to afford it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile he creates ready-to-wear (not exactly accessible when it comes to prices in the thousands), it\u2019s at haute couture that his talent and imagination really soars. (Don\u2019t even ask \u2013 a gown can cost more than a car.)\n\nFrom Valentino's 2019/20 collection. Supplied\n\n\u201cI feel that we have to react to tough times with grace,\u201d he says, fully aware that to do that through handmade clothing might be viewed as an anachronism. \u201cFirst, I don\u2019t think you need to own couture to enjoy couture. You can go to a museum and a beautiful exhibition; you don\u2019t have to own the exhibition at your home to enjoy it emotionally.\u201d\n\nWhat he loves most is the blank page at the beginning of a season. \u201cI think it\u2019s fantastic, then I try to make progress from something beautiful for now.\u201d Hence dresses tend to be loose, often with long sleeves, almost prim, yet also somewhat punk. His is a fey sensibility that focuses more on ease, less on the corsetted fit of Mr Valentino\u2019s day.\n\nNot that he can\u2019t amp it up. Naomi, Gwyneth in Grecian goddess mode, Lady Gaga going full Gaga all epitomise Piccioli\u2019s majestic couture, while such eternal girl-women as Keira Knightley and the ethereal Lily Collins choose the ready-to-wear, as does kick-arse rising star Tessa Thompson.\n\nIn Mr Valentino\u2019s day, it was dinner, it was jewels, or it was jumping onto a yacht to sail to Capri with a bag of evening gowns and bikinis. While still sun-kissed, Piccioli\u2019s vision is more of flowers in your hair, perfect for those three-day weddings the young wealthy favour now, where every bale of hay is curated to spell \u201cfestival\u201d but you don\u2019t have to cope with a drop toilet.\n\nPiccioli\u2019s vision is more of flowers in your hair, perfect for those three-day weddings the young wealthy favour now.\n\nThe challenge, though, of being so of the moment is that taste can move on. Piccioli has no fear of that. \u201cWhen everybody praises you, you can stay in your territory but I don\u2019t care to do this. I really love what I do, I deeply love fashion but I know everything can change tomorrow.\u201d\n\nSo instead, every season, he goes absolutely Crazy in Love. Hence the immense capes at the July show, the wild folkloric fringing on a coat, the bustier of scrunched and voluminous tangerine taffeta worn atop lavender satin pants, accentuated with a flourish of mint green chiffon at the waist.\n\nThe models, including Lauren Hutton who is 75, make it look like it would be normal to walk off the catwalk and into real life in, say, an ankle-length dress in apple green teamed with fire-engine-red leather gauntlets and boots the colour of ginger. The balance is an extraordinary one; down to earth and divine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom left: Hamish Bowles, Frances McDormand, Pierpaolo Piccioli, Anne Hathaway, Adam Shulman, Adut Akech and Troye Sivan at this year\u2019s Met Gala in New York. Getty Images\n\nI press Piccioli further on how one translates values into clothes, especially for a label that was once the epitome of the gilded rich. \u201cIt\u2019s all about changing the perspective from a brand which was about lifestyle, to a brand which is about community,\u201d Piccioli says. \u201cYou can be inclusive even if you talk about something that few people can afford. For me, inclusivity is about culture. If you think about \u2018lifestyle\u2019, you see a group of people who like the same holiday, the same kind of villa. I think that this is very old. This is not something that belongs to me for sure.\u201d\n\nHis interest lies in those who share values, not vacations in St Barts. \u201cIt\u2019s not because you are rich or poor, men, women, whatever. I don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t like to be surrounded by people who are ordinary. I love passion, enthusiasm, the need to do fashion. \u2014 Piccioli on his team at Valentino\n\nHe does listen though. He prides himself on it. \u201cI like young people,\u201d says the father who has three of his own at home. \u201cLots of people in my team are young and I learn everyday to re-see things with new eyes. When you do a creative job, you have to be very open. I have a team of 50 people and all of them can [speak up]. If not, then my fear is to be the naked king.\u201d\n\nBut what if one of them is the next royal who will dethrone him? \u201cWhy not? I don\u2019t like to be surrounded by people who are ordinary. I love passion, enthusiasm, the need to do fashion.\u201d\n\nPiccioli\u2019s journey to Valentino has been a long, straight Roman road. His fashion career began when, not long out of college, his friend and fellow Roman, Maria Grazia Chiuri \u2013 you might recognise her name because she is now the creative director of Dior \u2013 got him a job at Fendi, where she had just been hired.\n\nPiccioli with then joint creative director Maria Grazia Chiuri at the 2016/17 collection in Paris. Getty Images\n\nThey worked together there for a decade, during which time Karl Lagerfeld (who served 54 years at Fendi, even longer than his 36-year tenure at Chanel) was in charge, alongside Silvia Fendi, daughter of one of the formidable five sisters who founded the brand. In 1999, Chiuri and Piccioli moved to the even more quintessentially Roman brand, Valentino. So Piccioli has been here for 20 years.\n\nWhen Mr Valentino announced his retirement at his January couture show in Paris in 2008, his successor was Alessandra Facchinetti, an accomplished designer but not the right fit; her tenure was brief. By the end of 2008, Chiuri and Piccioli got the joint top job for which they were destined and became co-creative directors. That led to the \u201cRockstud\u201d accessories line (inspired by the brass studs along the base of the vast wooden doors of the Valentino Palazzo), which drove brand revenues beyond the \u20ac1 billion ($1.6 million) mark for the first time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet it was only when Chiuri headed to Dior in July 2016, ending their business partnership, that Piccioli took a design label, already at cruising altitude, further into the stratosphere. Revenues for 2018 topped \u20ac1.2 billion.\n\nElizabeth Taylor dances with designer Valentino at his anniversary party celebrating 30 years in the fashion business. Getty Images\n\nIt has been no small task to shift a brand that had exclusivity as its DNA; Mr Valentino\u2019s clients included Jackie Kennedy and Elizabeth Taylor, and he worked hard to get and keep them. The spoiled son of an affluent electrical supplier, Mr Valentino was more often described as \u201cthe son of an electrician\u201d as if that were something tawdry.\n\nIn Rome, the upper echelon of society, with its duchessas and principessas, is very tight. A friend of mine, who is titled, recalls the horror of the doyenne of a noble family on hearing that the younger generation were socialising with a dressmaker.\n\nNo wonder Mr Valentino learned to out-snob the snobs. Suddenly I\u2019m reminded of another friend\u2019s story of a trip on his yacht, where she was puzzled by a persistent humming sound coming from a cabin following every dip in the sea. It was a hairdryer rendering the emperor\u2019s coiffure perfect for on-deck photogenic lounging.\n\nBackstage at Valentino's Haute Couture collection in Paris in July. Supplied\n\nThen I recall how I happened to follow him and Mr Giammetti down the red carpet for the Zoolander 2 premiere a few years ago; the pair being squired by a solicitous young man who seemed humble in their presence. He turned around and it was Ben Stiller, who wrote, directed and starred in the movie.\n\nI feel that I belong to a renaissance kind of heart. The past is your present here. \u2014 Piccioli on working in Rome\n\nBut why not live large? Unlike those who work until their last breath, Mr Valentino and Mr Giammetti sold out in 1998 for about $US300 million ($438 million) to Holding di Partecipazioni (HdP), an Italian conglomerate controlled, in part, by the late Gianni Agnelli, the head of Fiat.\n\nIn 2002, Valentino SpA, with revenues of more than $US180 million, was sold to the Milan textile giant, Gruppo Marzotto, for $US210 million. Five years later, in 2007, it was on-sold to Permira and then, in 2012, Valentino was acquired for \u20ac700 million by the investment vehicle, Mayhoola for Investments, the fund overseen by Sheikha Mozah bint Nasser al-Missned, mother of the Emir of Qatar. (Piccioli\u2019s financial terms are undisclosed.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile there are many ways in which the present creative director differs from the past, there is continuity in his respect for the craftspeople, who he brings in early to the creative process, \u201cto involve them in my idea and not to just explain. It\u2019s not just about the dress itself, but it\u2019s about what the dress can express. And I try to involve people in my same dream not only in terms of the ruffle or the bow, but about defining an idea, because to do the amazing alone can be empty.\u201d\n\nMr Valentino with Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis at a New York benefit in 1976. Getty Images\n\nPiccioli, who once dreamed of being a film director, adored Daniel Day Lewis\u2019 Oscar-nominated portrayal of a couturier of monstrous ego in Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s 2017 drama Phantom Thread. \u201cHe was alone. He was super fragile. He was insecure.\u201d\n\nPiccioli\u2019s confidence doubtless comes from his private life but also from the Eternal City itself. His favourite church, of the more than 400 in Rome, is the baroque wonder, Santa Maria del Popolo, where you can marvel at two masterpieces without any queue. Caravaggio\u2019s The Conversion of Saint Paul and The Crucifixion of Saint Peter inside the church surely rank among the greatest free-to-view works of art you can see anywhere.\n\n\u201cI love that Caravaggio kept his own identity when painting. That his limits, the boundaries [he was humble-born and wild-living] became his strength. He painted like a local. I think that if you look for your tenacity, it can become your strength.\n\nMy impression of him is that he is possessed of something I so rarely encounter in interview subjects: an awareness of his own good fortune.\n\n\u201cI feel that I belong to a renaissance kind of heart. The past is your present here,\u201d says Piccioli, of working in Rome. \u201cThe past is not something dead, it\u2019s something kind of alive. Every day, you walk into the past when you see a Madonna on the corner of the street and on the same corner, you see maybe a little kiosk selling ice-cream, then you see nuns walking by like in a Pasolini movie.\u201d\n\nIs it terribly sacrilegious to think that the nuns look oh-so minimalist chic?\n\n\u201cNo. I think the same!\u201d he replies.\n\nPiccioli lights another Marlboro Gold, inhales then says, \u201cWhen I was a kid, everything was looking so far from me. Fashion, movies \u2026 everything was so far. I didn\u2019t know how to be the super cool guy. But when you arrive at being very aware of your strengths, of your weakness, it\u2019s fine \u2026\u201d\n\nWhat Rome, and being years in the shadows of a master, then years in a duo and only in your middle years becoming a solo star, has taught Piccioli is to relish his own joy and then to endeavour to translate that into cloth.\n\nMy impression of him, as we sit and chat for an hour \u2013 and despite the fact he smokes a lot and yes, that\u2019s a dreadful habit \u2013 is that he is possessed of something I so rarely encounter in interview subjects: an awareness of his own good fortune, which in turn allows him to be happy. \u201cYou live all this,\u201d he tells me. \u201cYou know yourself.\u201d\n\nThe author travelled to Rome with assistance from Valentino.\n\nThe September issue of AFR Magazine is out on Friday, August 30 inside The Australian Financial Review.
