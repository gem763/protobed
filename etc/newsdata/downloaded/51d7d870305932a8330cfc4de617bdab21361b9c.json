(Reuters) - SpaceX\u2019s Crew Dragon astronaut capsule will be ready for its first manned test flight into orbit in the first quarter of next year, provided that \u201ceverything goes according to plan\u201d in upcoming tests, NASA chief Jim Bridenstine said on Thursday.\n\nOn a visit to the SpaceX headquarters, Bridenstine praised Elon Musk\u2019s company for its \u201cfail fast, then fix\u201d approach to spacecraft design after a personal tour and briefing at the sprawling manufacturing plant - a display of unity amid a rare public spat between the two key space figures.\n\nBut he also emphasized NASA\u2019s concern for astronaut safety, saying the timeline could slip.\n\n\u201cWe are not going to take any undue risk,\u201d Bridenstine said, standing beside Musk outside a clean room that contained a Crew Dragon capsule.\n\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration is paying commercial launch contractors SpaceX and Boeing Co (BA.N) $6.8 billion to build rocket-and-capsule systems to return astronauts to the International Space Station from U.S. soil for the first time since America\u2019s space shuttle program ended in 2011.\n\nBridenstine\u2019s visit to SpaceX headquarters in the Los Angeles suburb of Hawthorne comes as SpaceX works to overcome key technical challenges on the Crew Dragon. SpaceX has so far never flown humans into orbit, only cargo.\n\nMusk and Bridenstine said they were working together through concerns over re-entry parachutes and other technical challenges, some of which were first publicly detailed by Reuters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty arduous engineering job to get the parachutes right,\u201d Musk said, declaring that Crew Dragon\u2019s parachutes will have \u201ctwice the safety factor\u201d than those used in the Apollo era.\n\n\u201cTesting will be complete and hardware at the Cape (Canaveral) by the end of December,\u201d he added.\n\nWhile Musk and Bridenstine provided few concrete details on their joint investigation into an explosion during a capsule ground test in April, Musk said incidents were inevitable during complex development processes and rigorous testing.\n\nFILE PHOTO: NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine speaks to media during a visit to NASA's Michoud Assembly Facility where engineers are preparing to add the final section to the core stage of the rocket that will power NASA\u2019s Artemis 1 lunar mission, in New Orleans, Louisiana, U.S., August 15, 2019. REUTERS/Jonathan Bachman\n\nThe visit follows a dispute over the last two weeks between Musk and the NASA chief, who bristled at Musk on Twitter for celebrating an unrelated milestone achieved on SpaceX\u2019s deep-space Starship rocket while completion of the Crew Dragon project remained delayed.\n\nMusk quickly shot back during a series of interviews, at one point citing a rival NASA moon rocket dubbed the Space Launch System that is years behind schedule and billions of dollars over budget. He also told CNN \u201cmost of the work\u201d left to complete on Crew Dragon was related to \u201ca long series of safety reviews\u201d by NASA.\n\nBoth the Boeing and SpaceX capsules have been beset by delays and testing mishaps that have prevented either company from achieving goals for manned orbital missions in 2019.\n\nRACE TO THE STATION\n\nSpaceX successfully launched an unpiloted Crew Dragon in March to the International Space Station, a $100 billion orbital research laboratory that flies about 250 miles (400 km) above Earth.\n\nBridenstine told reporters on Thursday that a high-altitude abort test of a system designed to propel the capsule to safety in the event of an emergency on the way to orbit would happen in \u201cshort order,\u201d though he did not provide a specific date.\n\nOther testing includes 10 additional mid-air \u201cdrop tests\u201d to test parachute resilience and performance, Bridenstine said.\n\nNASA and SpaceX have had a strained relationship at times in recent years. SpaceX\u2019s rise to become a dominant launch services provider for satellites over the last decade has been fueled in part by NASA contracts and the agency\u2019s transformative strategy to buy services from private companies rather than owning the technology itself.\n\nThe top executive for Boeing\u2019s rival Starliner program, John Mulholland, told a conference on Wednesday that its own key test of an abort system that propels astronauts to safety during an emergency was slated for Nov. 4, while its unpiloted orbital test flight was set for Dec. 17.\n\nUnder that time frame, the first Starliner manned mission is all but certain to slip into 2020.\n\nFILE PHOTO: SpaceX owner and Tesla CEO Elon Musk speaks during a conversation with legendary game designer Todd Howard (not pictured) at the E3 gaming convention in Los Angeles, California, U.S., June 13, 2019. REUTERS/Mike Blake\n\nWith no current means of flying astronauts into orbit from U.S. soil, NASA has been paying Russia about $80 million per ticket for rides to the space station.\n\nBridenstine said NASA was \u201cstill buying seats\u201d for ride-alongs aboard Russia\u2019s Soyuz as an \u201cinsurance policy\u201d against future delays in the crew capsule development.\n\nAsked about his jab at Musk on Twitter, Bridenstine said he was \u201csignaling\u201d to SpaceX and all other NASA contractors that \u201cwe need more realism built in to our development time frames.\u201d", "description": "SpaceX's Crew Dragon astronaut capsule will be ready for its first manned test flight into orbit in the first quarter of next year, provided that \"everything goes according to plan\" in upcoming tests, NASA chief Jim Bridenstine said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Steve Gorman", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439296208&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF990SE", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
