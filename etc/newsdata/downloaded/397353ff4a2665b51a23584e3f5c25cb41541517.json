Which is why we found the rules inadequate to the problem that we had been given.'\n\nMiss Atwood's winning novel The Testaments, the eagerly awaited sequel to the dystopian classic The Handmaid's Tale, was 'politically urgent' and 'beautiful in its depth', Mr Florence said.\n\nMiss Evaristo's Girl, Woman, Other, a collection of sometimes interwoven stories from 12 women of colour living in London, was described as 'groundbreaking' and praised for showcasing the 'wonderful spectrum of black British women today'.\n\nThe plots, critics' thoughts and odds of the contenders for the Booker Prize award are pictured before tonight's ceremony\n\nThe judges were unable to choose between the two after they initially spent three and a half hours deliberating.\n\nThey told Gaby Wood, the Booker Prize's literary director, who refused a request for the award be shared.\n\nHowever, after further deliberation the panel stuck to their decision, forcing Miss Wood to call Baroness Kennedy hours before the ceremony began at London's Guildhall.\n\nIt was only after a second call to Baroness Kennedy, which was made on speakerphone so all the judges could hear, that she decided there was 'nothing they could do' about the decision.\n\nMiss Atwood and Miss Evaristo beat four others on the shortlist: former winner Salman Rushdie's (left) novel Quichotte (right), Elif Shafak for 10 Minutes 38 Seconds In This Strange World, An Orchestra Of Minorities by Chigozie Obioma and Lucy Ellmann, whose 1,020-page novel Ducks, Newburyport consists mostly of a single sentence\n\nMiss Wood insisted the controversial outcome would not set a precedent. 'They essentially staged a sit-in in the judging room,' she said.\n\n'It was a rebellious gesture, but it wasn't a fighting gesture. It was a generous gesture.'\n\nThe Testaments sold more than 100,000 copies in its first week, helped by the worldwide interest garnered by The Handmaid's Tale \u2013 particularly after it was adapted into a hit American TV series.\n\nJudges were subject to a non-disclosure agreement to allow them to receive their copies before the novel was published last month.\n\nMiss Atwood and Miss Evaristo beat four others on the shortlist: former winner Salman Rushdie's novel Quichotte, Elif Shafak for 10 Minutes 38 Seconds In This Strange World, An Orchestra Of Minorities by Chigozie Obioma and Lucy Ellmann, whose 1,020-page novel Ducks, Newburyport consists mostly of a single sentence.\n\nLast year's winner was Northern Irish author Anna Burns for Milkman, a novel following a teenage girl during the Troubles.", "description": "A remarkable rebellion by the five judges saw the \u00a350,000 prize for fiction split between Margaret Atwood (left) and Londoner Bernardine Evaristo (right).", "authors": ["Alisha Rouse", "Showbusiness Correspondent For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/00/19715016-0-image-a-79_1571094136214.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
