The Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all closed the day up.\n\nSchatz says investors don't seem to be reacting to every twist and turn in the trade saga as they did a month to three months ago.\n\n\u201cInvestors should worry less about the tweets and more about other things in the markets. You know, earnings and the economy, and certainly sentiment,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I don't think it's the clear-and-present danger it was several months ago.\u201d\n\n(Photo by Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/Getty Images) More\n\nA new round of talks is scheduled to take place in Washington in early October. Ahead of those talks comes reports that the Chinese may cut out some of the non-trade issues that have complicated progress, including U.S. involvement in the Hong Kong protests. That comes along with reports that China made its biggest purchase of U.S. soybeans since June, which could point to a willingness to come to a deal.\n\n\u201cI'm not sure the Chinese are actually in a position of strength, per se,\u201d says Schatz. \u201cBut they're not in the position of weakness that the administration is selling.\u201d\n\nThat's because, he says, there is no incentive for them to make a deal in the next 14 months leading up to the 2020 presidential election. \u201cThey know what they have in Trump. If they try to wait him out and he loses, perhaps they will get a better deal with somebody else,\u201d Schatz say. \u201cBut frankly, 14 months to the Chinese is nothing.\u201d\n\nJoanna Campione is a producer for Yahoo Finance.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "Paul Schatz, president of Heritage Capital, says investors aren't reacting to every twist and turn of U.S.-China trade war anymore.", "authors": ["Joanna Campione"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/A_qNhuDSqUCPr_3qOeC_MA--~B/aD0yOTEyO3c9NDM2ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/ee2d0710-d020-11e9-bfbb-ea7c788fc0ad", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
