Japan's first large-scale arch dam which opened in 1955, the Kamishiiba Dam \u4e0a\u690e\u8449\u30c0\u30e0 is situated near Shiiba Village \u690e\u8449\u6751, which should be included in your itinerary for the day. Known as one of Japan's \"three great out-of-the-way places\" nihon dai-san hiky\u014d \u65e5\u672c\u5927\u4e09\u79d8\u5883 (the other two being Iya Valley in Tokushima Prefecture and Shirakawa-g\u014d in Gifu Prefecture), the village has been designated a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization.\n\nMajestic Kamishiiba Dam in November\n\nKamishiiba Dam stretches across the Mimi River, which flows eastward to the Pacific. Standing 110 meters high at its tallest point and spanning 341 meters, the majestic dam is respectfully called \"Her Honor\" kyakka \u95a3\u4e0b within Japanese dam enthusiast circles.\n\nIf you visit in November when the fall \"color line\" reaches Kyushu, you can be guaranteed a beautiful sight as you observe the yellows, oranges and red hues of the fall foliage against the impressive backdrop of the Kamishiiba Dam.\n\nSpecial Floodgate Opening for Tourists\n\nIf you can time your visit for Nov 16, Kyushu Electric Power will be conducting a special floodgate opening for the benefit of tourists.\n\nPhoto: PR Times\n\nIf you attend, you'll understand why Kamishiiba Dam was awarded the top prize in the \"Water Release\" category at the 2016 Dam Awards. You'll surely be impressed as floodwaters gush from the ski-jump-shaped ramps at either end of the dam and collide, a system designed to reduce the force of the flow as the waters of Hy\u016bga Shiiba Lake, the reservoir behind the dam, spill into the Mimi River.\n\nIn a mere 70 minutes, no less than 96,000 cubic meters of water, or the equivalent of 40 Olympic-size swimming pools, will be released.\n\nHere are the details of the event:\n\nDate: Nov 16 (Sat.), rain or shine\n\nTime: 11:30 to 14:40 (test from 10:00 to 12:00)\n\nWater release rate: 10 to 40 cubic meters / second\n\nDetails on Kyushu Electric Power's website here\n\nKamishiiba Dam All Year Round\n\nNot planning a fall foray into Miyazaki Prefecture? No worries! Whether it's cherry blossoms in spring or beautiful fireworks launched from the dam heights in summer, you can still count on Kamishiiba Dam to provide a memorable and scenic side trip during your visit to Shiiba Village.\n\nSource: PR Times\n\nRead more stories from SoraNews24.\n\n-- Musical Calculator Gives Nostalgic Twist To Neon Genesis Evangelion And Legend Of Zelda Themes\n\n-- The Eerie Costumers Of Japan\u2019s Night Parade of One Hundred Demons\n\n-- A Look at Japan\u2019s Magical Sailor Moon Cafe Menu for 2019\n\nExternal Link\n\nhttps://grapee.jp/en/\n\n\u00a9 grape Japan", "description": "If you're planning to visit Japan's southwesternmost island this autumn, you may already have included some of Kyushu's most famous fall tourist attractions, such as soaring in cable cars above the forests of Mt Unzen Nita Pass in Nagasaki, marveling at the cliffs and stone pillars jutting out from the\u2026", "authors": ["Grape Japan"], "top_image": "https://japantoday-asset.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/img/store/06/73/d02dbb52bf7e5908e4850a8aec7528bfc78b/MF_eyecatch.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
