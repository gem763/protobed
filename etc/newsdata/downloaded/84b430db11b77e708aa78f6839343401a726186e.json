This report found that nearly R2 billion was stolen from the bank. The South African Reserve Bank released the report to the public in October 2018.\n\n\u201cAs we all know, Advocate Terry Motau\u2019s report revealed that a cash sum of R5 million was apparently \u2018stolen\u2019 from VBS Mutual Bank, allegedly to bribe Dr Matjila to obtain his cooperation in facilitating the funding of VBS Mutual Banks\u2019 requirements by the PIC. Famously, the money was reportedly carried by helicopter from Makhado to Lanseria Airport,\u201d Holomisa wrote.\n\n\u201cIf the alleged report is anything to go by, one could argue that Dr Matjila had personally benefited from nearly R7.5 million of VBS Mutual Bank money,\u201d Holomisa continued.\n\nMatjila appeared at the inquiry in Pretoria for the first time today to begin his testimony.\n\nWhen asked about the contents of Holomisa\u2019s letter, the advocate representing Matjila said: \u201cWe don\u2019t know anything about that.\u201d\n\nThe failure to disclose the R2.5 million VBS loan \u201cmay constitute a conflict of interest and even possible criminal conduct\u201d, Holomisa wrote.\n\nThe UDM leader quoted from an alleged forensic review report commissioned by the PIC board and produced by Nexus Forensic Services.\n\nHolomisa said he had received an e-mail from Lubbe on July 6 where Lubbe informed Holomisa, according to the rules of the PIC Inquiry, that he might be implicated in evidence to be submitted by Matjila.\n\nAccording to the alleged report, Matjila, as well as the PIC\u2019s former chief risk officer, Paul Magula, and the PIC head of legal, Ernest Nesane, received loans from VBS.\n\nMagula and Nesane previously sat on the VBS board. Prior to the bank\u2019s downfall the PIC held a 25% stake in VBS.\n\n\u201cThe term of Dr Matjila\u2019s loan is alleged to be a 30-year period, which raises the questions where: (a) the loan was extended at arm\u2019s length and (b) such a lengthy repayment period was standard for VBS Mutual Bank,\u201d Holomisa wrote.\n\n\u201cIn terms of the conditions of the loan, it is allegedly unclear whether the loan was intended to ever be repaid, or whether it is/was in fact being repaid. The only way to establish the veracity of this allegation is to scrutinise the dates of disbursement and repayment,\u201d Holomisa wrote.\n\nIf there was any truth in these allegations, it raised serious concerns about Motau\u2019s report, Holomisa said.\n\n\u201cWhy did Advocate Motau\u2019s report omit Dr Matjila\u2019s alleged loan, especially given his position as [former] PIC CEO,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cWhy did Advocate Motau\u2019s report exclusively focus on Magula and Nesane? Common sense would dictate that Advocate Motau would have declared Dr Matjila\u2019s alleged loan even if no wrongdoing was apparent.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe alleged report apparently states that Dr Matjila holds 10 directorships, but according to the whistle-blower, about two have not been disclosed as required,\u201d Holomisa said.\n\n\u201cNexus Forensic Services\u2019 alleged report apparently recommended that the PIC board should pursue criminal investigation. If that is true, the question is what has the board done about this recommendation and if nothing, why?\u201d\n\n\u201cI wanted to establish whether the commission is aware of this alleged report and if not, could the commission make an enquiry into obtaining the said report to assist in its investigation,\u201d Holomisa said.\n\nThe PIC Inquiry continues.", "description": "A former Public Investment Corporation (PIC) CEO allegedly could have \u201cpersonally benefited\u201d from VBS Mutual Bank money to the tune of nearly R7.5 million.", "authors": ["Justin Brown"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7503/7c913e0f4acb49b680b76ae80c24c67c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-08"}
