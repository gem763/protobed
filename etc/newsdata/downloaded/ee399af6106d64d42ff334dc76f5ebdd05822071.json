Cory Booker\u2019s third-quarter fundraising announcement. Booker\u2019s campaign announced this week that he raised $6 million, following a theatrical, last-minute fundraising drive in September, when his campaign manager warned supporters that Booker might have to drop out unless donors sent in an extra $1.7 million right away.\n\nMeanwhile, Yang \u2014 who started the campaign completely unknown, without political aides and with an email list composed of his Gmail contacts, as he tweeted Wednesday \u2014 is one of a handful of presidential candidates who have improved their standing, either financially or in polls, since the beginning of the year. Only Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Harris have posted a better single fundraising quarter than Yang so far this year.\n\nPresidential campaign veterans called Yang\u2019s third-quarter fundraising haul a dividing line for the Democratic field \u2014 one that separates the candidates with the resources to run national campaigns from those who have to bunker down in an early state and hope to generate a surprise there.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re one of the other candidates, you look at your resources. You\u2019ve got to be looking to do something to make a big mark on the scene,\u201d said Ed Brookover, who managed Ben Carson\u2019s insurgent campaign for president in 2016 and later became a senior adviser to Donald Trump\u2019s campaign. \u201cThat could be a surprise finish in an early primary.\u201d\n\nYang\u2019s fundraising guarantees him nothing when the voting starts, and he trails far behind the front-runners in every poll so far. But he has mobilized a large number of dedicated supporters, something many other candidates lack: the \u201cYang Gang,\u201d which is especially active online.\n\nThat includes a large number of small-dollar givers. The details in Yang\u2019s most recent fundraising report will not be released for two weeks, but in his most recent Federal Election Commission disclosure, Yang raised 69 percent of his funds from donors who contributed $200 or less.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/22/ae/7e60d6384f7a9ada12fe622e6aed/yangregular.png\"\n\nThe bottom line of Yang\u2019s $10 million cash haul, said Joe Trippi, who managed Howard Dean\u2019s trailblazing 2004 presidential campaign, is that \u201cyou now have the resources to do something.\u201d\n\nCandidates without those finances will need to make difficult choices in the fall, as they try to concentrate their resources in ways that could still help them make an impact on the 2020 race.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t keep waiting for next month\u2019s debate as your moment. That\u2019s the mistake the entire field\u2019s made. If they don\u2019t put the organizational stuff together and make their stand, there won\u2019t be a stand to make,\" Trippi said.\n\nDean raised major sums as the first candidate to tap into online grassroots fundraising and organizing. But those throngs of online supporters, of course, did not translate into votes. Dean headed into the Iowa Caucus an energetic front-runner but lost unexpectedly to John Kerry, and soon after his campaign had gone kaput.\n\nYang now averages 3 percent support in national polls, according to RealClearPolitics \u2014 good for sixth in the Democratic field. While Yang\u2019s financial support has gone up dramatically, the people supporting him in polls has slowly expanded beyond his core group to a broader anti-establishment electorate, said Patrick Murray, director of polling at Monmouth University.\n\n\u201cYang is tapping into a similar type of voter that Bernie Sanders would usually get,\u201d Murray said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s been able to build from that. He\u2019s not in double-digits with his support, but he\u2019s been able to be seen as a viable participant in the process \u2014 and that\u2019s key for him.\u201d\n\nIn a new sign of his supporters\u2019 enthusiasm this week, three Yang organizers started a super PAC called Abundance for America that aims to raise money to help sponsor grassroots pro-Yang projects on its own.\n\nAs Yang supporters spontaneously organize by, for example, building websites featuring video clips of Yang or trying to engage minority communities, the super PAC will try to fund their activities, said Quintus Jett, the super PAC\u2019s president. The group will seek contributions from large-dollar donors.\n\n\u201cA lot of people in Yang Gang may be short on money, and at the same time, there are people out there in the world who support Andrew Yang who have a lot of money but not time,\u201d Jett said.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/9a/d5/03db9425494586f982540578906c/20191002-andrew-yang-ap-773.jpg"}
