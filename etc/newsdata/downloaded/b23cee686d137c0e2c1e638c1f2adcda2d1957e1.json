Benett/Dave Benett/Getty Images for LOVE Magazine)\n\nDaisy Lowe has revealed she had an abortion because she wasn\u2019t ready to be a mum.\n\nThe 30-year-old admitted that her decision was \u2018heartbreaking\u2019 but said she is \u2018grateful\u2019 she chose not to have the baby.\n\nThe model discussed her decision on Mel B\u2019s new podcast, The Truth Flirts with Badoo, when she was asked if she would date somebody who was anti-abortion.\n\nDaisy said: \u2018I wouldn\u2019t be able to date someone who had conflicting ideas on abortion, no.\n\n\u2018Because it\u2019s every woman\u2019s right to do whatever they do. Ultimately there are a lot of very unwanted, unwell kids in the world who need a whole lot of love.\n\nDaisy joined Mel and Ben Hunte on The Truth Flirts\n\n\u2018The planet is overpopulated enough, so why should we bring unwanted kids into the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I think it\u2019s important. It\u2019s a heartbreaking decision to make.\u2019\n\nThe former Strictly Come Dancing star continued: \u2018The only time when it has come up in my relationship was when I did get pregnant and I did need to make the choice and I chose to have one.\n\n\u2018He was supportive, but I had to go to the clinic and it was heartbreaking.\n\nDaisy is rumoured to be dating Jack Penate (Picture: Dave Benett/Getty Images for Hearst)\n\n\u2018He called me when I was having the scan and there was a healthy heartbeat, he said, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to keep it, we\u2019ve got to keep it\u201d. I was like, \u201cAre you f****** kidding me?\u2019 I was like \u201cI can\u2019t\u201d.\u2019\n\nDaisy added: \u2018I wasn\u2019t ready to be a mum.\n\n\u2018It was heartbreaking. But I\u2019m so grateful I didn\u2019t have that baby. I would have sacrificed a lot and I wouldn\u2019t have been the best mum at the time.\u2019\n\nDaisy \u2013 who in the past has dated Matt Smith, Thomas Cohen and Mark Ronson \u2013 also spoke about her bad relationships on the podcast, shaming an ex who had called her \u2018disgusting\u2019 for gaining weight.\n\nThe star said: \u2018We had been seeing each other for a while but I knew at this point that it was definitely over.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018He was in a bad mood or whatever, so I was like \u201cyou\u2019re in a really bad mood so I\u2019m just going to leave you in here and go shower\u201d\u2026 got in the shower and because obviously he didn\u2019t like that I had said that to him he came into the shower.\n\n\u2018Bearing in mind, I am starkers and showering, he pointed at me and said \u201cyou\u2019re so disgusting, you need to lose weight so you can get work\u201d.
