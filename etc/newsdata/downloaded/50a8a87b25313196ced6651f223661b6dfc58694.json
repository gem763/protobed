It\u2019s just a one-off game and we\u2019re prepping to bring the best out of us tomorrow.\u201d\n\nEngland\u2019s 33-13 defeat by Australia ultimately cost them a place in the knockout stage four years ago under Stuart Lancaster\u2019s doomed stewardship.\n\nDespite a six-game losing streak against England, defiant Wallabies coach Michael Cheika has backed his players to spring another upset, declaring: \u201cThe fear inside us is dead.\u201d\n\nBut Youngs believes the two weeks England have spent in Miyazaki preparing after last week\u2019s devastating typhoon washed out their final pool fixture against France, has helped their cause.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve certainly been able to get our teeth into Australia a lot earlier,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe feel fresh and we feel ready to go. We basically have to make sure we take the game to them, get ourselves on the front foot and come out with an intensity that marries up with our preparation,\u201d added Youngs.\n\n\u201cThe waiting\u2019s over now. It\u2019s great that so many people will be cheering (in England) tomorrow, up early, wearing the shirt \u2014 we certainly feed off that and it helps the belief within the side.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Fantastic occasion\u2019 \u2013\n\nYoungs started in England\u2019s 19-12 loss to France the last time they reached a World Cup quarter-final and predicts that building an early lead will be key against Australia.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic occasion, I was lucky to play in one,\u201d he said. \u201cI suppose my experience of that is just making sure the intensity of the game doesn\u2019t shock you at the beginning.\n\n\u201cI imagine the first 20 minutes will be pretty full-on, so we\u2019ve got to make sure we get off to the start that we want.\u201d\n\nWith captain Owen Farrell switching to fly-half in place of George Ford, Jones selected a fit-again Henry Slade alongside Manu Tuilagi in a dynamic midfield pairing.\n\n\u201cHenry is massive for us,\u201d said Tuilagi. \u201cHe can play, he can run, he can kick \u2014 he\u2019s an all-rounder. For him to be back just adds a massive part to our game, especially with Faz at 10.\u201d\n\nSamurai imagery has been all the rage at this World Cup, but Youngs flashed a sheepish grin when asked if former Jones, previously coach of Japan, had asked the players to summon the warrior spirit this weekend.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy without a samurai sword,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got some boys in this team who don\u2019t know when they\u2019re beat. Everyone involved is going to fight right to the end.\u201d", "description": "Oita (Japan) (AFP) \u2013 England\u2019s rocky recent World Cup record will count for nothing when they lock horns with fierce rivals Australia in", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/17/cf85cc_england-scrum-ben-youngs-can-wait-get-his-teeth-australia-toothy-england-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
