The question now is, who?\n\nREAD: Wednesday is D-Day for Botswana\n\nThe incumbent, Mokgweetsi Masisi, has declared a long weekend. Batswana have been given Wednesday to Friday to go vote and would only return to work on Monday after election results have been announced.\n\nTuesday was a \u201chalf day\u201d, so people could travel to different areas and vote in their constituencies. Botswana is divided into 57 constituencies that vote for a member of parliament. The party that wins 29 constituencies takes the helm.\n\nMasisi and other presidential hopefuls continued to crisscross Botswana on Tuesday. The Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) leader was spotted at a local shopping centre, Main Mall, where he made an early morning public appearance.\n\nThe fifth president of the BDP, who took over from former president Ian Khama 18 months ago, Masisi, is vying for a fresh term as Botswana\u2019s head of state.\n\nFighting for retainment\n\nThe BDP has governed Botswana since its independence 53 years ago. Masisi is facing a huge task of keeping this party \u2013 which was co-founded by the diamond-rich country\u2019s first President, Sir Seretse Khama, who is also Ian Khama\u2019s father, 66 years ago \u2013 on top.\n\nThings are not easy for the BDP. The party is facing a fierce contest from the Botswana Patriotic Front (BDF) which may only be a few months old, but counts Ian Khama among its members and is led by the BDP\u2019s former member of parliament, Biggie Butale.\n\nMasisi was live on Facebook earlier today urging the people of Molepolole, north west of Gaberone to allow him to continue as the president of Botswana.\n\n\u201cBy voting for them [the BDP leaders] you are voting for me. It is time for the BDP to go fix things. I am here to tell you and I urge you to go tell others\u2026 you need water in Molepolole and I promise you a bill that will ensure you get water. Vote BDP,\u201d he said.\n\nMasisi \u2013 who has had a falling out with his predecessor, Ian Khama, that is believed to have led to the latter leaving the BDP for the BPF months ago \u2013 has been promising to \u201cfix things\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf you want to see change, choose the BDP because the BDP of today is not that of 2014; it is youthful, modern and beautiful,\u201d he said.\n\nThis could be easily understood to be a swipe at the BDP that was led by Khama when it won the elections in 2014.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t vote for anyone else \u2026 especially those of umbrellas because some of them have joined forces with the people we never thought they would align themselves with,\u201d Masisi said.\n\nThis could also be taken as a reference to the alliance between the opposition party, Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC), and the BPF.\n\nThe UDC leaders were known critics of Ian Khama and his leadership but now were working with his party, the BPF. The latter was contesting in 19 constituencies and the agreement was that they would urge their supporters to vote for the UDC in areas where their party was not contesting.\n\nThe two parties were not clear on whether this would lead to a coalition after elections.\n\nThere is also the Alliance for Progressives (AP), which is led by Ndaba Gaolatlhe, who has been tipped to be the possible kingmaker as the next Botswana parliament takes shape post-elections.\n\nThe frontrunners\n\n- Biggie Butake, BPF; lawyer and pastor\n\nA former assistant minister under BDP, Butale studied law and is also a preacher. He promised to strive for an economy that would create local wealth, business opportunities for locals and create jobs. The 47-year-old wants procurement to be done locally as well. \u201cClose our borders so that Botswana companies can grow,\u201d he said.\n\n- Mokgweetsi Masisi, BDP; the educationist\n\nA former teacher with a masters degree in education, 57-year-old Masisi is hoping for the majority of the Batswana to give him and his 66-year-old party a fresh mandate. He is promising a change in governance by his party, which is still governing.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe may be in government, but we want to change things\u2026 I would be lying if I said that most of our economy is in the hands of Batswana. We need to have citizenship, economic empowerment and increase opportunities for Batswana,\u201d he said.\n\n- Duma Boko, UDC; the advocate\n\nA Harvard Law School graduate and human rights lawyer, Boko is burning with passion to remove the BDP from power.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur country has shocking problems\u2026 there are those who plunged it into this mess and those who must pull it out. We are serious when we say we will create 100 000 jobs in 12 months,\u201d said the 50-year-old presidential hopeful.\n\n- Ndaba Gaolathe, AP; The Numbers Man\n\nHe is the son of a former Botswana finance minister, Baledzi Gaolathe. A former BDP member, the 47-year-old holds an MBA in finance and degrees in mathematics and economics, all obtained in the US. \u201cWe need to build a strong economy inclusive of every Motswana (a singular for a Botswana citizen) \u2026an economy where people have land. Our economy is not in Batswana\u2019s hands,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Botswana\u2019s sweltering heat did little to deter political campaigners and presidential hopefuls from taking to the streets in a final attempt to woo voters ahead of the national elections tomorrow.", "authors": ["Poloko Tau"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9501/f02bc81e9227434b84fd91ccc1d8aa99.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
