REUTERS/Naseem Zeitoun\n\nThe expansion of tiny but gas-rich Qatar\u2019s liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities, already the world\u2019s largest, is one of the energy sector\u2019s most lucrative projects, and the world\u2019s top oil and gas majors have been racing to secure a stake.\n\nInvitations to bid were sent out last month and the result is due to be announced in the first quarter of 2020, Saad al-Kaabi, who is also minister of state for energy, said - if Qatar decides to go with partners at all.\n\n\u201cWe like the partnership model for many benefits. But because we don\u2019t need the partners, what\u2019s going out is basically a set of criteria that we have, to demonstrate to us what added value we get for Qatar if you come in,\u201d said Kaabi.\n\n\u201cMaybe they can give us something outside,\u201d he said, referring to LNG assets outside its domestic market.\n\nQP wants to lift its LNG production to around 110 million tonnes per annum from today\u2019s 77 mtpa over the next five years by building four new production facilities.\n\nSpeaking from his office in Doha, Kaabi told Reuters that with the remaining contracts for its completion set to be awarded by the end of 2019, it was now asking a shortlist of majors to bid for a stake in the completed project.\n\nHe did not say how large a slice of the asset would be on offer, and declined to comment on which companies had been shortlisted.\n\nTotal, Exxon Mobil, Shell, and Italy\u2019s Eni have all offered QP stakes in prize assets abroad in a bid to secure a stake in the project.\n\nThose assets, from stakes in sought-after exploration blocks to partnerships in petrochemical facilities, have helped transform QP into a significant international player in top gas and oil provinces from Mexico to Mozambique.\n\nAlthough it says it is confident it can go it alone on developing its LNG resources, finding a home for all the extra supply it is expecting to come online is something oil majors can offer significant help with.\n\nQatar sees another 33 million tonnes of LNG flowing from the new facilities in 2024, and it will also need buyers for another 35 million tonnes as existing contracts expire over the next five years.\n\nKaabi declined to elaborate on the criteria that could help land partners a stake.\n\nUPPING THE ANTE\n\nHe said QP\u2019s decision to self-finance the project, tender for its construction, and drill appraisal wells before offering partners a chance to buy in was part of a strategy to up the ante on what majors must now offer Qatar for a piece of its top asset.\n\nA recently drilled appraisal well produced double the yield that was expected, a potentially good omen for what lies ahead, said Kaabi.\n\n\u201cIt means we have a great project with great reserves, and the North Field is very prolific.\u201d\n\nBut the super-wealthy country also faces significant challenges. Global LNG demand is flagging due among other things to the U.S.-China trade war at a time supply from competitors like Australia, the United States and Russia is rising.\n\nMounting tensions between the West and Iran in the Gulf may also affect the country\u2019s ability to ship out gas, while an economic embargo by its neighbors could hurt regional sales.\n\nKaabi said QP would seek more long-term LNG supply deals, including in Europe, after it last month signed an agreement for unloading services at Belgium\u2019s Zeebrugge LNG Terminal, securing its full capacity through 2044.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to do more in Europe - you\u2019re going to see,\u201d he said.\n\nQP also expects to sign at least one upstream block in the United States - typically exploration rights or a field in development - before year-end as it looks to capitalize on its $10 billion Golden Pass LNG export terminal in Texas.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The logo of Qatar Petroleum is seen at its headquarters in Doha, Qatar, July 8, 2017.
