The text will then either be dropped or move toward adoption, diplomats said.\n\nOn Thursday, US President Donald Trump raised the possibility that the United States mediate the conflict between Turkey and the Kurds, and a US official said Trump had asked American diplomats to broker a ceasefire.", "description": "United Nations (United States) (AFP) \u2013 The UN Security Council is considering a US-drafted text calling for Turkey, currently engaged in an", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/10/446a40_smoke-rises-syrian-town-tal-abyad-in-picture-turkish-border-turkish-flag-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
