Shares of Delta were down 3.5% in premarket trading.\n\nDelta\u2019s pilots received record overtime this summer as the carrier flew a heavy schedule, in part because of demand tapped from competitors that canceled flights due to the grounding of Boeing 737 MAX planes, Reuters reported on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe size of the demand surprised us,\u201d Bastian said in a telephone interview.\n\nAtlanta-based Delta does not own the 737 MAX, which has been grounded since March after two fatal crashes. As a result, it is able to increase flight capacity at a time when growth at MAX carriers like Southwest Airlines (LUV.N) and American Airlines (AAL.O) remains at a standstill.\n\nDelta is forecasting capacity growth of around 4.5% in the fourth quarter, though costs per available seat mile, excluding fuel, are also seen rising between 4% and 5% in the period.\n\nCosts, excluding fuel, rose 2.4% in the third quarter due to higher employee wages, demand volume and weather incidents, Delta said.\n\n\u201cGiven the high volume that we\u2019ve experienced and the demand for the product, it\u2019s created a need for additional resources across all of our work groups (...) and getting this staffing in sooner,\u201d Bastian said.\n\nNet income climbed 13.1% to $1.5 billion in the quarter to Sept. 30 on total adjusted revenue of $12.56 billion.\n\nAdjusted earnings per share reached $2.32, beating analysts\u2019 expectations for profit of $2.26, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Analysts were forecasting revenue of $12.6 billion.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, Delta expects earnings per share in the $1.20 to $1.50 range, below analyst estimates for $1.51.\n\nThe airline, the first of its peers to report quarterly earnings, is among the U.S. airlines hardest hit by a new 10% tariff on European-made Airbus (AIR.PA) planes.\n\nBastian said the tariff is not expected to have an impact this year because its remaining Airbus deliveries will come from the European planemaker\u2019s plant in Mobile, Alabama, which is exempt from the levy.\n\nDelta is \u201clooking at all of our options to make sure that we don\u2019t incur any increases to our already negotiated prices with Airbus\u201d for deliveries due next year, Bastian said.\n\nLast month, Delta pledged to buy 14 more A350s, which are assembled in Europe, as part of a strategy to grow in Latin America through the acquisition of a 20% stake in LATAM Airlines Group.\n\nThe airline is also still targeting an investment of around 100 million euro ($109.80 million) in the rescue of Italian flagship carrier Alitalia, Bastian said.", "description": "Delta Air Lines hopes to speed up the hiring of pilots, flight attendants, reservation and airport staff after \"surprise\" demand growth fueled better-than-expected third-quarter profit, Chief Executive Ed Bastian told Reuters.", "authors": ["Tracy Rucinski", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439282582&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF990W7", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
