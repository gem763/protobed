But you have to understand, that\u2019s basically how it works. Bernie Sanders had, what, 20,000 people at an event in New York? Suppose each one of those people gave $100,\u201d said Joe Cotchett, a major Bay Area bundler for Biden. \u201cDoes Joe have the ability to have 20,000 people at a rally right now? The answer is no. But hopefully for Joe, it will come.\u201d\n\nHarold Schaitberger, head of the International Association of Fire Fighters, which has already endorsed Biden, said it would likely commit to a Biden super PAC.\n\n\u201cWe would be in a position to support that effort,\u201d said Schaitberger. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly capable of spending in the six figures.\n\nDonors\u2019 willingness to up the ante is exactly what the Biden campaign was counting on, fretting that it can\u2019t manage both a primary campaign against 18 rivals as well as a fusillade from Republicans trained almost solely on him. On Thursday, it took the risky step of embracing a super PAC in a primary where nearly all of his rivals reject the fundraising vehicles as emblematic of the pernicious influence of big money in politics.\n\nThe campaign\u2019s bet is premised on the idea that the benefits of accepting super PAC support outweigh the likely blowback from rivals and reform-minded primary voters.\n\nA super PAC could saturate the airwaves with ads that amplify the campaign\u2019s message on Ukraine, pushing back against Donald Trump\u2019s relentless attacks about the Biden family\u2019s alleged corruption, or boost Biden against his better-funded Democratic foes.\n\nWithout a robust online fundraising operation that can match top-tier rivals like Sanders or Elizabeth Warren, the Biden campaign still could run low on money as the long, costly primary season drags toward Super Tuesday. And it\u2019s not yet clear how much money a potential vehicle backing Biden could raise.\n\nBut the prospect breathes new energy into his effort, some donors say, giving more certainty that it will have the resources to move forward.\n\nCotchett noted that donors are also looking ahead to the massive amounts of cash needed to compete on Super Tuesday, when 14 states hold contests on the same day, and predicted that by then, nearly every candidate will be cash-strapped, and perhaps even ready to accept outside support.\n\nAnother top Biden fundraiser, John Morgan, said he\u2019s ready to give but would like to see how the super PAC spends its money and expressed concerns that his money could be used to underwrite consultant fundraisers.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like to pay commissions,\u201d Morgan said.\n\nMorgan said he\u2019s confident Biden will win the primary, in part because Warren and Sanders will continue to divide the progressive vote.\n\n\u201cBernie isn\u2019t leaving the race even if he\u2019s in ICU,\u201d Morgan said, referring to the 78-year-old\u2019s recent heart attack. \u201cWe\u2019ve all got life expectancy, planned obsolescence. It\u2019s just how life is.\u201d\n\nWhile a Biden super PAC is not yet established, the idea to form one began weeks ago \u2014 and it faced initial opposition from Biden\u2019s campaign. On Thursday, the campaign sent a signal that it would drop its opposition.\n\nThe donors and consultants involved in discussions surrounding the creation of a super PAC, some of whom would speak with POLITICO only on background, insisted that they haven\u2019t discussed their plans with the campaign and therefore did not run afoul of laws prohibiting coordination with an outside entity funded by unlimited contributions.\n\nThe campaign\u2019s statement, they said, was released without their knowledge, which the campaign said as well.\n\nUnderpinning the prospective Biden super PAC is a circle of highly regarded operatives. Longtime Florida operative Steve Schale, a Barack Obama alum and frequent Biden booster, is in talks to help lead the effort.\n\nSchale declined to comment for this story.\n\nAlso involved is Julianna Smoot, who served as Obama\u2019s national finance director in 2008 and his deputy campaign manager in 2012. Mark Riddle, a strategist who this cycle has helmed the outside spending group Future Majority, will also take on a leadership role, sources say, and Larry Rasky, a longtime Biden friend who worked on the former vice president\u2019s 1988 and 2008 presidential bids will play a major role.\n\nOne source with knowledge of the effort said potential donors are poised to get more information next week.\n\nThe campaign has insisted that it had the necessary funds to compete through the early state contests, pointing to some polls showing Biden holding his own or gaining traction. But some critics panned Biden\u2019s move as a cry for help.\n\n\u201cIf they are going to have one, at least disavow it so you can pretend to be reform minded,\u201d said Brian Fallon, a former communications director for Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign. \u201cThat they are blessing it means they are desperate for it to happen and want donors to know they want them to give to it.\u201d\n\nBiden himself has said he\u2019s not concerned about having the resources to compete.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re on a course to do extremely well,\u201d Biden said in a 60 Minutes interview set to air Sunday. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about being able to fund this campaign. I really am not, truly.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, the campaign framed the situation confronting Biden as unique and daunting.\n\nAnti-Biden spending from Republicans is \u201cpouring into this race with one goal: ensure Joe Biden is not the nominee that faces Donald Trump in 2020,\u201d the campaign said, adding that \u201cno Democratic contender has ever faced this kind of onslaught from Republicans while still having to win the party nomination. It is simply unprecedented.\u201d\n\nThe former vice president\u2019s reversal was welcome news to donors who talked to POLITICO. Some had grown frustrated with the campaign, especially after it reported spending more than it took in during the third quarter of the year.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

I did my job right. Do yours.\u2019 I\u2019m not the only one who feels this way. And some of us think Biden needs the help, we know it, whether he wants it or not.\u201d\n\nWhile Biden drew criticism from Sanders and Warren for his decision, allies said the benefits for him are worth the expected pummeling from the left and the right.\n\n\u201cThere is always a risk to appearing too much like the status quo candidate or taking too much money,\u201d said Steve Westly, a former California state controller and a Biden supporter. \u201cAs someone who has run for office myself, there\u2019s a bigger risk of showing up without enough money to get your message out.\u201d\n\nMichael Adler, a Miami developer and Biden donor who has been friends with Biden since the 1972 Democratic National Convention in Miami Beach, said Biden shouldn\u2019t unilaterally disarm by renouncing a super PAC, considering super PACs aided Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. And, he pointed out, Trump has loads of outside help as well.\n\n\u201cWith what the president is doing in raising money, it would almost be malfeasance for any candidate that wins the nomination to be in a competitive disadvantage to make an ideological point about who\u2019s funding them,\u201d Adler said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with small-dollar contributors. But $5 contributors shouldn\u2019t determine the whole election. The whole electorate should determine the election. And people who can make larger contributions should be able to express themselves.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Maggie Severns"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/ce/a5/2191ff094fac9bd2c434e6617823/191025-joe-biden-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
