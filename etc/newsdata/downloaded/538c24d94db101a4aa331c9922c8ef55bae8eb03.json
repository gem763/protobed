So nervous, in fact, that they\u2019re engaged in their quadrennial ritual of fantasizing.\n\nMICK MULVANEY STRUGGLES AS WHITE HOUSE LEAKS SAY HIS JOB IS IN JEOPARDY\n\nWhat superhero is ready to don a cape, swoop in to rescue them and capture the White House?\n\nThe media love such fantasies, of course, because it\u2019s an exciting story line and the chance to pump up a new personality.\n\nRemember when Oprah made a few comments and the press was seized by the idea that she could be president? The only problem was, well, she didn\u2019t want to be president.\n\nNow comes a New York Times report that Democratic donors and insiders are \u201cfretting about who is in the race and longing for a white knight to enter the contest at the last minute.\u201d\n\nThe reason, obviously, is a lack of confidence that any of the current field can defeat Donald Trump\u2014who, even after a likely impeachment vote, is virtually certain to survive a trial in the Republican Senate.\n\nThe current polls show several Democratic candidates besting Trump, but that could look very different in the fall of 2020 after the nominee is battered by zillions in Republican advertising along with Trumpian attacks.\n\nJoe Biden probably has the best chance to oust Trump, but there is rising concern that his uneven debate performances and anemic fundraising may sink his primary campaign. Biden could have dominated as the target of Trump\u2019s Ukraine efforts, in my view, but he has still not done an interview since impeachment exploded.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nElizabeth Warren is viewed by the prognosticators as having the best shot at the nomination, but there is growing fear that she\u2019s too far left to win a general election. Even as she\u2019s taking a second look at Medicare for All, having ducked questions that it would force a middle-class tax hike, Warren is saddled with other positions that delight Democrats but could be viewed as socialistic in a general election.\n\nIf you assume that Bernie Sanders can\u2019t win as a 78-year-old heart attack survivor, that leaves two moderate alternatives to Biden.\n\nPete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar both had strong debate outings last week, and Mayor Pete has surged into third place in the latest Iowa poll. But neither seems a surefire bet to beat Trump. And thanks to Nancy Pelosi, both are getting far less media oxygen because of the overwhelming focus on impeachment.\n\nSo who do the Democratic dreamers want?\n\nThe Times says Sherrod Brown is getting a lot of calls (his wife confirms this). But if the Ohio senator thought he could win the nomination, he would already be in the race.\n\nEric Holder is toying with the idea of getting in. But Barack Obama\u2019s attorney general has never won an election.\n\nMike Bloomberg? He was a very good New York mayor, but he threatens to run every four years and never does. He wound up deferring to Biden this time. He\u2019s 77. Not happening.\n\nHillary? You know she\u2019s thought about it. But she also knows she\u2019s had her shot.\n\nMichelle Obama? I\u2019m sure she\u2019d look good in Democratic polls. One unnamed person \u201cmused\u201d about her to the Times. She was a popular first lady. But unlike Hillary, Michelle has never exhibited the urge to be a politician herself. I have the sense that she devoted eight years to public service and is happy to have her life back.\n\nLate entries can kick up a fuss, but they never win, not after the current candidates have raised millions, set up organizations and developed their ground games.\n\nSo this is really about a collective unease that Biden won\u2019t win the nomination and that Warren might.\n\nIt\u2019s like a fantasy football league, lots of fun to play and game out the possibilities. But this is a contest you only win with flesh-and-blood players on the field.", "description": "As President Trump calls impeachment a \u201clynching\u201d\u2014with all the blowback you\u2019d expect from such a racially raw term\u2014you might think the Democrats would be feeling good about their chances.", "authors": ["Howard Kurtz", "Howard Kurtz Is A Fox News Analyst", "The Host Of"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/22/694940094001_6096857793001_6096858459001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
