That they finally overcame their playoff demons just eight months after Harper signed with the Philadelphia Phillies was not lost on the baseball-watching public.\n\nNor did people forget that Harper had an ironic slip of the tongue during his introductory press conference in Philadelphia: \u201cWe want to bring a title back to D.C.\u201d\n\nWith all that, many have wondered how Harper took it as his old team powered its way into the World Series.\n\nHarper told The Athletic he wasn\u2019t envious of his former Nationals teammates getting as far as they did so soon after he chose to leave.\n\n\u201cNo, because like I said, I made my decision, and that was my decision,\u201d Harper said. \u201cAnd it was the final decision that I made. You know, jealousy isn\u2019t good. For me, it\u2019s about having the gratitude to go out and do what I do each day and not having an attitude towards anybody else.\u201d\n\nHarper even admitted that by not signing him back, the Nationals were able to spend on more pitchers last offseason, most notably starters Patrick Corbin and Anibal Sanchez.\n\nBut he didn\u2019t say the Nationals were better off without him. And again, he swore he wasn\u2019t jealous.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s about being able to be the person that I am and not saying to myself, \u2018Oh my gosh, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m not a National,\u2019\u201d Harper said. \u201cOr, \u2018Oh my gosh, those guys are doing what they\u2019re doing. I can\u2019t believe it. I\u2019m so jealous.\u2019 No. I\u2019m so happy for them. You know how hard it is to get into the postseason and win games.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
