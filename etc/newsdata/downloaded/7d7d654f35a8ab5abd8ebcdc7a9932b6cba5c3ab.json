However, starting with a stunning stoppage loss to Rose Namajunas in November 2017, Jedrzejczyk has found herself in a slump, having lost three out of her last four fights.\n\nWhen she reflected on her career at UFC on ESPN+ 19 media day held Thursday, Jedrzejczyk ran through the ups and downs. Each loss was a learning experience, and that was no different in her most recent fight against Valentina Shevchenko last December at UFC 231.\n\nOne of the most valuable takeaways for Jedrzejczyk? The confidence she can hang with the \u201ctrue\u201d 125-pound champion.\n\n\u201cAfter the fight, even though I lost, I was proud of myself and my team,\u201d Jedrzejczyk told reporters, including MMA Junkie. \u201cI kept my head up because I put on a good fight with Valentina Shevchenko. We saw her performing with Liz Carmouche, and she just ripped her head off. I was very proud I could stand with the real champ for all five rounds.\u201d\n\nEach new camp is a mental reset for Jedrzejczyk (15-3 MMA, 9-3 UFC), who takes on Michelle Waterson (17-6 MMA, 5-2 UFC) in the main event of UFC on ESPN+ 19.\n\n\u201cAfter resting and taking this break, I got to the point to where I wanted to be,\u201d Jedrzejczyk said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I didn\u2019t feel the power anymore, and I wasn\u2019t motivated to train. But stepping into the octagon for a new camp, it\u2019s always like a debut for me. I\u2019m getting excited because I love my job.\n\n\u201cMy big passion and hobby, sacrificing for so many years, it became by job. I can make a living off of it. Sometimes we get too far, and we want more and more. I always 100 percent want what I\u2019m doing in life. This is what I was doing. I was giving myself, but I forgot about myself.\u201d\n\nAs for her weight cut, Jedrzejczyk was reluctant to touch on the issue. A major storyline during UFC Tampa fight week has been her reported struggles to reach 116 pounds. Jedrzejczyk wasn\u2019t eager to address the rumors, but indicated she is on track to hit her mark Friday morning.\n\n\u201cThe next 24 hours are going to be beautiful because I feel great,\u201d Jedrzejczyk said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I should tell you if I\u2019m not going to make the weight or if I\u2019m going to make the weight tomorrow. \u2026 Is she going to make it?\n\n\u201c\u2026 I know who am I and why I am where I am,\u201d Jedrzejczyk said. \u201cWhy you people ask me how I feel? I feel great, man. I\u2019m going to be on weight, and I will face Michelle Waterson on Saturday. \u2026 Beautiful weight like there\u2019s nothing to worry about. I\u2019m a professional, and I always take my business from the beginning to the end.\u201d\n\nA win over Waterson, could put her back into title contention, according to the 32-year-old Polish strawweight. One way or another, Jedrzejczyk vowed that UFC gold will be wrapped around her waist in the near future.\n\nIf she has it her way, Jedrzejczyk will face off with Weili Zhang in a stadium show in Poland next year.\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s going to happen very soon,\u201d Jedrzejczyk said. \u201cWe fight, and after we win very quick this Saturday, I can step to the octagon very soon. I had some interviews with the Asian media outlets yesterday. They\u2019ve been asking me. They\u2019re super pumped for this fight. They know what\u2019s up and what\u2019s coming.\n\n\u201cThey ask me if I\u2019d like to fight Weili Zhang in Poland, for example, because she\u2019s having problems with the U.S. visa. I said of course, we had an amazing brand new stadium \u2013 60,000 people with one MMA show. So it\u2019s time for the UFC to take over.\u201d\n\nUFC on ESPN+ 19 takes place Saturday at Amalie Arena in Tampa, Fla.
