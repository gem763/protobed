A handful of 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls say yes.\n\nThe roughly 20-strong field looking to beat President Donald Trump next year aligns in its plans to rejoin a Paris Climate Agreement that includes leading U.S. allies, and most candidates want to end new fossil-fuel leasing on public lands. Widening the lens, however, their environmental proposals reveal key differences, and not just when it comes to U.S. oil, where to find it and how to sell it.\n\n\u201cOne area where candidates overwhelmingly agree (15 candidates) is ending new leases for fossil-fuel development on federal lands. Investors should take note because this is something that a president can do unilaterally, without congressional approval,\u201d says James Lucier, who leads the energy, environmental and tax practices at Capital Alpha.\n\nRead: UN chief warns of \u2018dramatic climate emergency\u2019 as G-7 pledges $20 million for Amazon fire\n\nFederal lands offshore and onshore currently produce 13% of U.S. natural gas and 24% of U.S. oil CL.1, -0.07% . U.S. crude oil exports will nearly double to 9 million barrels a day by 2024, the International Energy Agency forecasts. That\u2019s enough to surpass Russian shipments and threatens to overtake Saudi exports. But the U.S. should be investing in alternative energy sources, not pouring oil onto the global market, say early poll leaders Sen. Bernie Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, along with Sen. Cory Booker and select others.\n\nCapital Alpha Note: This graphic was created before candidates John Hickenlooper and Jay Inslee dropped out of the presidential race and before Andrew Yang detailed his proposals.\n\nLess than a third of the field have put a price tag on their climate-change ideas \u2014 although count Warren, Booker, former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Kirsten Gilliband among those that have. How exactly they\u2019ll fund ambitious environmental fixes will have to be hammered out as the group narrows.\n\nAbout half of the field is backing a \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d that has already been factoring into the election conversation; some are adding their own features to the pact rolled out by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other members of Congress earlier this year. Sanders, Gillibrand, Sen. Kamala Harris, Warren, Booker, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar all signed off on the Green New Deal legislation.\n\nFuture Returns: What would the Green New Deal mean to investors?\n\nFollowing the lead of major states such as California and New York, the candidates with the more advanced plans are moving to endorse features of the Green New Deal, such as a 100%-clean-electricity goal (10 candidates of the 19 tracked by Lucier and Capital Alpha) and a net-zero emissions target by 2050 (nine candidates). Many other candidates have been vocal supporters of the deal, which is at least as much a job-creation bill as climate-protection bill.\n\nSurprisingly, few candidates (only four) lead with an explicit carbon price \u2014 a cost applied to carbon pollution to encourage polluters to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases they emit into the atmosphere. Most candidates are choosing emissions targets instead as a means of stopping ozone depletion. Those that favor a carbon price do generally have less developed policies than those who follow a Green New Deal approach. Still, a majority of candidates are at least open to a carbon price, notes Lucier. Entrepreneur Andrew Yang, out with his $5 trillion proposal Monday, plays up the use of nuclear energy more than his competition.\n\nRelated: Andrew Yang urges Americans to move to higher ground because response to climate change is \u2018too late\u2019\n\nThe Democratic National Committee, by a vote of 222-137, last week ruled against allowing a climate-only debate that former climate-focused 2020 candidate Gov. Jay Inslee and activists had pushed for. Inslee has since announced his withdrawal from the presidential race to run again for Washington governor. On Sept. 4, in New York, CNN will host a candidate town hall on climate policy for select candidates.\n\nOpinion: How to make sure your ESG fund does what you think it does\n\nUsing the candidates\u2019 own proposals and analysis from Capital Alpha, here\u2019s a snapshot of climate-policy positions among the higher-polling names or those who have made climate change a particular priority. Not all candidates are included, nor are the highlights exhaustive of each candidate\u2019s environmental proposals to date.\n\nBiden: The Obama administration\u2019s vice president wants 100% clean energy and net-zero emissions by 2050. He\u2019ll work with other major international carbon-emitting nations to create enforceable pacts, he says. He\u2019ll advance a $1.7 trillion federal investment and $5 trillion total public-private spending on climate initiatives.\n\nSanders: The long-serving Vermont senator, who considers himself a Democratic Socialist, will push for the end of exports of coal, natural gas and crude oil, while phasing out nuclear energy. He recently detailed a $16 trillion climate plan that builds on the Green New Deal.\n\nWarren: The Massachusetts senator will spend $2 trillion over 10 years in green research, manufacturing and exporting; $1.5 trillion of federal energy product procurement over 10 years; and $100 billion in foreign aid for clean-energy deployment. She\u2019ll ban new fossil-fuel leases offshore and on public lands and will regulate companies to disclose climate risks. Warren has said corruption and lobbying are big obstacles to U.S. action on climate change.\n\nHarris: The California senator is so far light on a climate-specific plan, at least one that details spending, but her climate-focused state keeps her in the spotlight. She has included a climate cooperation pledge as part of foreign policy that she says will restore U.S. footing with allies. As senator, she has co-introduced legislation to block efforts to roll back fuel-emissions standards by the Trump administration.\n\nRead: Trump is reportedly working to prevent more automakers from California emissions rollback defection\n\nBooker: The Newark mayor-turned-New Jersey senator will ban fracking. He\u2019ll triple the Superfund tax and increase fees on coal mine operators to fund environmental cleanups. He\u2019ll also ban U.S. crude-oil exports. Clean-energy promotion will feature in a planned $1.7 trillion in federal investment and $5 trillion in total investment.\n\nKlobuchar: The Minnesota senator hasn\u2019t yet been explicit in her climate plans, at least to the degree of her competitors, the Capital Alpha analysis finds. She is a Green New Deal backer. She will reinstate tougher CAFE standards, the Corporate Average Fuel Economy regulations, which determine auto fuel efficiency, as well as a clean-power plan.\n\nGillibrand: The upstate New York senator will look to spend a combined $10 trillion in public and private funding on climate initiatives over a decade, paid for in part by a proposed $100 billion tax on fossil-fuel production. She\u2019ll push for trade negotiations to include environmental provisions. She also gets more specific than most candidates on carbon, including: net-zero carbon and greenhouse gas emissions by 2050; 100% clean, renewable, zero-carbon electricity by 2030; and setting a $52/metric ton carbon price.\n\nYang: In his $5 trillion \u201cLower Emissions, Higher Ground\u201d plan released Aug. 26, Yang says he would allow the U.S. to achieve net-zero emissions by the middle of the century. His plan includes: a transition away from fossil fuels to renewable energy and upgrading infrastructure and farming practices; moving populations to higher ground; researching the removal of carbon from the atmosphere, including using \u201cspace mirrors\u201d to deflect sunlight. Compared to climate-change plans from most other candidates, Yang\u2019s would focus on keeping nuclear energy. He didn\u2019t say exactly how he\u2019d pay for the $5 trillion proposal, although a carbon tax is included.\n\nSouth Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg: Mayor Pete\u2019s proposals call for a carbon tax-and-dividend plan \u2014 taxing polluters and distributing that revenue as a dividend for individuals \u2014 as well as no new drilling on public lands. He\u2019ll explore carbon capture and he\u2019ll push for collaboration with other countries to create climate goals more ambitious than the Paris agreement.\n\nFormer Texas Congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke: The oil-country politician would provide no new fossil-fuel leases and would change the royalties that oil and gas companies pay taxpayers for pumping from public lands to reflect the greater demands of climate change. He too looks to surpass the Paris agreement, in 2030 and after.\n\nRead: Here\u2019s where the 2020 presidential candidates, including Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, stand on affordable housing\n\nAnd: Where the 2020 candidates stand on student debt and college affordability", "description": "The roughly 20 Democratic hopefuls for the 2020 presidential race align on rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement, protecting federal lands and supporting...", "authors": ["Rachel Koning Beals", "News Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ163_warren_ZG_20190826150535.jpg"}
