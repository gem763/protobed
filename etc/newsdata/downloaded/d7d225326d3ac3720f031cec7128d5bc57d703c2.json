You tried, but the market just wasn\u2019t on your side.\u201d\n\nFalih was abruptly dropped on Sunday as energy minister just over three years into the job, after being unable to deliver the same thing that eluded Naimi toward the end of his career: the high prices critical for funding Saudi Arabia, which despite attempts to restructure, remains a nation extremely dependent on its oil.\n\nWhile they may be a generation apart, Naimi, who just turned 84, and Falih, who remains under 60, had similar career paths.\n\nBoth were educated at renowned U.S. schools\u2014Naimi attended Stanford, Columbia and Harvard, and Falih went to Texas A&M. Both began at Saudi state oil company Aramco (Naimi, in fact, joined in 1947, as an \u201coffice boy\u201d, when he was just 12), rising through the ranks to occupy the highest office in the world\u2019s oil industry.\n\nAlong the way, they displayed starkly different personalities.\n\nNaimi had an iron-will to do things his way\u2014a trait best characterized by his decision to keep Saudi oil production roaring amid plunging prices to try and kill off America\u2019s least profitable but most prolific shale drillers.\n\nFalih Did The Job ...\n\nFalih was essentially a yes-man who did the market bidding of his boss, Mohammed bin Salman\u2014Saudi Arabia\u2019s powerful Crown Prince, often referred to by his initials, MbS, and described as the \u201creal power\u201d behind the throne of his father, King Salman.\n\nSome were, therefore, surprised to learn that despite his loyalty to MbS, Falih was removed in the early hours of September 8 through a royal decree issued in Riyadh by King Salman. Others had seen it coming\u2014just a week earlier, Falih had also been replaced as the head of Aramco, a position he held jointly with his ministerial portfolio. The king announced the new energy minister as Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, another of his sons and an elder brother to MbS.\n\nIf there was a reason to be surprised by Falih\u2019s dismissal, it was because as long as he was on the job, he appeared to do whatever was possible under the circumstances to turn the market in favor of the Saudis and the OPEC cartel led by the kingdom.\n\nSometimes he won. And sometimes he lost spectacularly, as he battled a market that became increasingly volatile and challenging with Naimi\u2019s departure.\n\nThe moment he came on, Falih reversed the produce-at-will course set by his predecessor, sealing the first of two output cutting pacts between OPEC and key allies led by Russia. The second iteration of that agreement, a commitment hatched in December to cull 1.2 million barrels per day until the market rebalances, remains in effect till today.\n\n\u2026 But Under-Delivered\n\nStill, in the numbers game, Falih may have under-delivered. The price of , the international benchmark for oil, went from just under $50 per barrel in March 2016\u2014when Falih took office\u2014to above $62 this week. While that\u2019s a near 25% jump over three years, it\u2019s still well below the $80 per barrel often cited as what the Saudis need for funding their budget.\n\nBrent Oil Futures Weekly Chart\n\nJohn Kilduff, founding partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital, summed up Falih\u2019s predicament using a sporting analogy:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like in baseball. We know that the team that loses games all year round is really a terrible team. But it\u2019s the manager that gets fired, because you can't fire the whole team.\u201d\n\nWhatever Falih may have done for market rebalancing, it was Prince Abdulaziz who was credited on Monday with helping to negotiate the current so-called OPEC+ agreement between the cartel and its key allies, including Russia. Traders also took note that he had been in office since 1995 as deputy oil minister.\n\nThe new energy minister\u2014referred to by the market as AbS, in the same cryptic manner as his brother MbS\u2014announced that the pillars of Saudi policy would not change and that the OPEC+ deal would survive.\n\nRinging Endorsements For AbS\n\nAnd endorsements were ringing in straight away. Phil Flynn, an oil bull and analyst at Chicago\u2019s Price Futures Group, told CNBC that AbS is \u201cbullish for oil prices.\u201d He added:\n\n\u201cPrince Abdulaziz bin Salman is known as an oil production cutter. He has been instrumental in securing production cuts in the past.\u201d\n\nThe AbS-euphoria helped oil prices hit six-week highs in early Asian trading on Tuesday, extending Monday\u2019s 2% rally, as Brent traded closer to $63 per barrel and the U.S. benchmark WTI above $58.\n\nGiven AbS' long service as a Saudi delegate to OPEC and work behind the scenes in helping secure production pacts, his contribution to further market tightening may be par for the course. It will certainly help in taming OPEC\u2019s first production overrun in months, after Iraq pumped a new record-high average of 4.88 million barrels a day in August, well above its agreed ceiling under the OPEC+ deal.\n\nAbS\u2019 Brand Will Be Proven By Market And Aramco Listing\n\nBut beyond the OPEC Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC) meeting on Thursday and expectations of rate cuts by the this week and next, it remains to be seen if the AbS brand itself will be bullish for oil.\n\nGlobal investors will also be closely watching how the two Salman brothers handle the listing of Aramco, a process that began before the end of Naimi\u2019s tenure and has now gone beyond that of Falih.\n\nSaudi Arabia plans to list 1% of the Aramco equity on the Riyadh stock exchange before the end of 2019 and another 1% in 2020, Reuters reported on Monday, quoting sources familiar with the matter. That\u2019s a radical change from earlier listing plans that had reportedly targeted the New York or London stock exchanges.\n\nKilduff, the partner at Again Capital said,", "description": "Commodities Analysis by Investing.com (Barani Krishnan/Investing.com) covering: Brent Oil Futures, Crude Oil WTI Futures.
