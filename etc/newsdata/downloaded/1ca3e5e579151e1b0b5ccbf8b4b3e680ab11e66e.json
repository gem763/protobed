But in BE AFRAID: The Science of Fear, a documentary from The Nature of Things, we meet a researcher from the Netherlands who is testing a method that may be able to cure phobias after a single treatment session.\n\nPhobias are a type of anxiety disorder characterized by a persistent, intense and irrational fear of an object, activity or situation. Some phobias are thought to be rooted in past traumatic experiences, while others may be inherited or learned from family members.\n\nAccording to the Canadian Psychological Association, phobias occur in more than one in 10 Canadians. There are three major categories of phobias: agoraphobia (the fear of public places), social anxiety disorder (formerly known as social phobia), and simple or specific phobias. Specific phobias are centred around a particular animal, person, environment or situation.\n\nFor some, dealing with their phobia is as easy as avoiding its stimulus. But while it might be easy to avoid snakes if you have ophidiophobia, other phobias can be much harder to sidestep, like a fear of leaving your home. For these phobias, treatment tends to involve drug treatment and psychotherapies like cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), where patients may be gradually exposed to the object of their phobia and taught ways to cope.\n\nBut these therapies aren\u2019t effective for everyone. \u201cThe exposure therapy would seem to work at times, but then suddenly I\u2019d relapse,\u201d says John, a past research participant of clinical psychologist Merel Kindt. \u201cOnce the relapse happened, I would be back where I started and would have to begin the therapy all over again.\u201d\n\nKindt is also a professor and researcher with the University of Amsterdam, and she\u2019s developed what she calls the Memrec Method for phobia sufferers like John. This method is based on a premise from McGill University researcher Karim Nader: that our brains re-save memories and that these memories are malleable.\n\nIn BE AFRAID: The Science of Fear, Kindt explains how her method works. \u201cFirst [we] trigger the fear memory by exposing people to a situation or stimulus that they fear,\u201d she says. Kindt then adds something new to the experience, such as challenging a patient afraid of heights not close his or her eyes. \u201cThis is a signal to the brain to update the memory,\u201d she says. \u201cThe memory trace is temporarily in a destabilized state.\u201d\n\nUsually, that fear memory would be re-saved in the brain overnight as the patient sleeps. But Kindt has found that if the patient takes a single dose of a beta-blocker called propranolol after the memory is triggered, it disrupts the re-saving process.\n\nPropranolol was originally developed to treat angina, but it has since been used to treat many health conditions including tremors, cardiac arrhythmias and \u2014 since it lowers heart rate and blood pressure \u2014 anxiety.\n\nIf the treatment is successful, the memory is altered as the patient sleeps and a strong fear response will no longer be triggered. The treatment appears to be effective at treating a range of specific phobias that can be directly confronted (more abstract fears, such as the fear of death, can\u2019t be treated through this method).\n\nKindt\u2019s clinic says that 80 per cent of patients that have tried the Memrec Method had their phobia cured after only one session. None of the patients have reported any relapses to Kindt, although, because the method is so new, she says she doesn\u2019t have the data to say whether or not relapse may be possible after longer periods of time.\n\nWhen it does work, the treatment can result in a dramatic change. \u201cWe often hear from patients that it is only after the treatment that they realize how much the fear used to limit them,\u201d says Kindt.\n\nTake Eva Holland, a Canadian journalist who reached out to Kindt Clinics for her upcoming book Nerve: A Personal Journey Through the Science of Fear. When she was offered the chance to try the treatment to address her fear of exposed heights, Holland jumped at the opportunity.\n\nTo treat Holland\u2019s phobia, Kindt first had her climb inside a basket mounted on a ladder of a fire truck and then lifted it up to its fullest height, triggering her fear response. \u201cIt was horrible. It was completely, full-body terrifying,\u201d Holland recalls. Kindt discouraged her from looking away.\n\nBack on the ground, Holland took the propranolol pill and let it work through her sleep cycle. When she ascended in the basket the next day, she was no longer terrified. In fact, after trying the Memrec Method, she was able to go ziplining on a trip to Utah.\n\nMORE:\n\nThe science of the scare: Designing the perfect haunted house\n\nHolland is mindful of the fact that the method isn\u2019t designed to treat all fears. \u201cThe cure is only meant to cure irrational fears, not necessary fears,\u201d she says, but adds that it can be hard to tell the difference between the two at times. \u201cIt\u2019s been kind of a process of re-learning when my fear is appropriate and when it\u2019s not. I definitely have felt a reduction in the irrational panic, I think.\u201d\n\nThe Memrec Method is still being studied, with future clinical trials on the horizon, but it could mean hope for phobia sufferers everywhere. Having said that, because of the nature of triggering a fear memory, the Memrec Method should only be done under the supervision of a trained professional.\n\nWatch BE AFRAID: The Science of Fear on The Nature of Things.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/natureofthings/content/images/episodes/BeAfraid_CurePhobias_1920.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
