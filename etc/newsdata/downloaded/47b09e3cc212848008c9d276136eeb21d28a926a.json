Rayners picked up a poor square pass from Alfred Ndengane, drove forward and sent a low shot beyond the reach of goalkeeper Wayne Sandilands to put the hosts ahead against the run of play.\n\nThe goal boosted Stellies\u2019 confidence and the Cape side began putting together some fast-paced attacks, calling Sandilands into some significant action as the pace and movement of Waseem Isaacs and Rayners pulled the Bucs defence all over the park.\n\nPirates re-established control in terms of possession, but their attempts to find an equaliser before the half-time interval were thwarted by a solid defence from Stellenbosch.\n\nThe Soweto side then made a double change early in the second half, introducing Kabelo Dlamini and Frank Mhango to boost their attack.\n\nPirates again dominated possession and tested De Jong with a few sharp efforts, but the longer they remained a goal down, the more their frustration grew.\n\nIn addition, the Buccaneers lacked the precision and creativity to consistently open up their hosts\u2019 defence.\n\nStellies had a number of good chances to extend their lead with efforts on the counterattack, including an ambitious long-range attempt from Marc van Heerden that nearly caught Sandilands out of position.\n\nPirates nearly broke through in the 79th minute when substitute Justin Shonga met a right-flank cross and glanced a header towards goal, but his effort rebounded off the outside of the near post. Ten minutes later, Mabasa hit the same piece of woodwork with an acrobatic volley.\n\nThat proved to be the last hurrah for Pirates, who slumped to their third league loss in the 2019/20 campaign, while Stellies racked up a successive league victory.\n\nPirates will next take on Highlands Park at Makhulong Stadium in Tembisa on Tuesday.", "description": "Orlando Pirates suffered a shock 1-0 defeat to Stellenbosch FC in Cape Town yesterday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9523/7959f4a26ae84e2a9794fa386c79279d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
