Downing Street said that \u201cboth sides strongly reiterated their desire to reach a Brexit deal\u201d and hoped to meet in person later in the week.\n\nHowever when Coveney was asked earlier about the Downing Street briefings that accused Varadkar of derailing talks with inflexibility over the backstop, he said there had been a \u201clot of misinformation\u201d and an attempt to pressure Ireland.\n\nWithout naming Johnson, Dominic Cummings or any other figure in the British government, Coveney said there were \u201cconflicting reports\u201d from London and \u201ca hard line\u201d from those briefing the media.\n\nCoveney said that Ireland had welcomed Johnson\u2019s Brexit proposals last week as a \u201cstep forward\u201d while stressing that more work was needed to find a solution.\n\n\u201cThere is an ongoing conversation in Brussels and we want to contribute to that in a constructive way ... the taoiseach wants to find a compromise that works. But he is not willing to be boxed into a corner.\u201d\n\nDublin had been \u201cupfront and honest\u201d in highlighting problems with Downing Street\u2019s plan, said Coveney. \u201cWe can\u2019t pretend we\u2019re solving problems when we\u2019re not.\u201d\n\nThe foreign minister, who doubles as deputy prime minister, said a blame game seemed to be eclipsing a search for solutions: \u201cBut this is too enormous an issue to be focusing on the politics of blame.\u201d\n\nCoveney was due later to travel to Brussels to meet Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator.\n\nEU and Irish officials have criticised Downing Street\u2019s plan as unworkable for taking Northern Ireland out of the EU\u2019s customs union and for giving the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) a veto over trading arrangements.\n\nOn Tuesday, a No 10 source accused the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, of making a deal impossible. Brussels responded by accusing Johnson of trying to play a \u201cstupid blame game\u201d.\n\nDespite Coveney\u2019s insistence that a last-minute deal was still possible, there was a growing sense of dread in Dublin that no-deal Brexit was edging closer, heralding political instability in Northern Ireland and economic pain on both sides of the Irish border.\n\nIreland\u2019s finance minister, Paschal Donohoe, warned of turbulence while presenting the annual budget to the D\u00e1il on Tuesday. \u201cThis is a budget that has been developed in the shadow of Brexit,\u201d he said.\n\nThe country has enjoyed strong growth and tax receipts, but Donohoe said the increasing likelihood of the UK exiting the EU without a deal posed a \u201cpressing and immediate risk\u201d to Ireland\u2019s economy.\n\nThe government deferred tax cuts and allocated \u20ac1.2bn, excluding EU funding, to cushion any shock. Donohoe earmarked \u20ac650m to support the agriculture, enterprise and tourism sectors, as well as regions that would be most affected by a no-deal Brexit.\n\nAt sombre press conferences following the budget announcement, successive ministers detailed their departments\u2019 no-deal Brexit contingency plans. One minister referred to the preparations as \u201ctriage\u201d.\n\nThe teetering Brexit talks have caused the gulf between political parties in Northern Ireland to widen.\n\nArlene Foster, the DUP leader, claimed that an Irish plot had been exposed. \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s proposals have flushed out Dublin\u2019s real intentions to trap Northern Ireland in the EU customs union forever, where Dublin rather than the United Kingdom\u2019s elected representatives would be in the driving seat.\u201d\n\nSinn F\u00e9in\u2019s deputy leader, Michelle O\u2019Neill, accused the DUP and \u201cother delusional Brexit cheerleaders\u201d of exposing Northern Ireland to potentially catastrophic consequences.\n\n\u201cThe north\u2019s economy cannot withstand being excluded from the customs union and the single market, and that is the message we will be bringing loud and clear to the EU.\u201d", "description": "Ireland%20hits%20back%20at%20No%2010%20accusation%20that%20it%20sabotaged%20Brexit%20deal%20%7C%20Ireland%20%7C%20The%20Guardian", "authors": ["Rory Carroll"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
