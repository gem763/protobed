The 6-foot-5 forward averaged 19.5 points and 8.2 rebounds per game as the Mystics finished with a league-best 26-8 record.\n\nDelle Donne is also considered the frontrunner for the league\u2019s MVP award, a title she previously earned in 2015.\n\nBeyond Delle Donne, the AP also recognized Mystics coach Mike Thibault as coach of the year. Thibault, who has been coaching the Mystics since 2013, is the WNBA\u2019s all-time winningest coach.\n\nThe Mystics have the top seed in the WNBA Playoffs, which begin Wednesday. Washington has a bye in the first round and will not play until next Tuesday.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
