However, there is a catch. There are some affordable luxury sedans on the market today that do not come from luxury brands. The plus side is that they\u2019re more affordable than similarly equipped cars from luxury brands, and the only downside is that you don\u2019t get the prestige that comes with fancy luxury brand emblems.\n\nHere are six of the top luxury cars from nonluxury brands in 2019.\n\nChevrolet Impala Premier\n\nThe Chevrolet Impala is unfortunately on the chopping block as General Motors GM, +1.08% prepares to seriously cut down on sedan production in favor of more trucks and SUVs, but despite being on death row, this big, comfy sedan is still worth a look. There\u2019s a lot to like about the Impala, like its cavernous interior, sharp looks and surprisingly good fuel economy. The nicest Impala you can get is the Premier trim starting at $36,720 which includes a strong V6, leather seating, which is heated in front, Bose premium surround-sound audio, navigation and more as standard equipment. You can get it even more loaded with the Confidence package which adds more safety tech and the Convenience package, which throws in ventilated front seats, a heated steering wheel and a dual-pane sunroof.\n\nHonda Accord Touring\n\nThe Honda HMC, +0.15% Accord has always been a class leader in practical family sedans, and that\u2019s still very true of the current generation. In its most luxurious form, the Accord Touring gives more expensive luxury sedans some serious competition, and it starts at just $34,990. Like the Impala Premier, the Accord\u2019s better engine option is standard in the top trim along with a head-up display, leather seats that are heated both in front and in back, plus ventilated front seats, wireless charging, navigation and advanced driver assistance tech like adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assist, traffic sign recognition and more. There\u2019s also an efficient hybrid option that returns 48 miles per gallon in the city and 48 mpg on the highway.\n\nAlso see: The best EVs and plug-in hybrids in 2019\n\nKia K900\n\nKia The the Kia K900 starts at $59,900.\n\nYou might be surprised to see a Kia on a list about luxury cars, but the Kia K900, starting at $59,900 is a true luxury car by anyone\u2019s standards. The K900 is all new for 2019, and it\u2019s better and more luxurious than ever. Unfortunately, you can\u2019t get one with a V8 anymore, but its new sole engine option is a stellar twin-turbo V6, and all-wheel drive (AWD) is now standard. The K900 only has one trim level, making it easy to shop for, and it comes standard with a user-friendly 12.3-in UVO infotainment system, leather seats that are heated and ventilated in front, a sunroof, a head-up display, trizone climate control and a suite of modern driver assistance tech. A VIP package is available, which basically makes the back seats a lot fancier.\n\nNissan Maxima Platinum\n\nRefreshed for 2019, the Nissan Maxima is touted by Nissan NSANY, +0.08% as the \u201c4-door sports car.\u201d Whether it\u2019s truly a sports car is debatable, but either way, it\u2019s a nice, big sedan with a brawny V6 and a fun-to-drive factor that few competitors can match at its price point. If you\u2019re looking for luxury, you\u2019re going to want the range-topping Platinum model, which starts at $41,440. The Maxima Platinum comes with luxuries such as leather seating that is heated and ventilated in front, a rear power sunshade, a panoramic moonroof, Bose premium audio, active noise cancellation and, if you add the Reserve package, quilted leather upholstery and a 2-tone steering wheel.\n\nYou might like: 2019 BMW Z4 review: the Roadster returns\n\nToyota Avalon Limited\n\nThe Toyota Avalon is all new for 2019, and it has a bold look that is a welcome evolution from its rather bland predecessor. The Avalon is pretty luxurious in every trim, but if you want a level of comfort and feature content that truly rivals luxury brands, you\u2019re going to want to upgrade to the Limited model which starts at $41,950. It comes loaded with leather upholstery, heated and ventilated front seats, heated back seats, a head-up display, JBL premium audio, a head-up display and much more. It also has a premium interior design that might make you surprised to be sitting in a Toyota TM, -0.08% . There\u2019s also a hybrid variant with an impressive fuel economy rating of 43 mpg city/44 mpg highway.\n\nVolkswagen Arteon SEL Premium\n\nVolkswagen The VW Arteon.\n\nThe Volkswagen Arteon is an all new addition to the VW VWAGY, +2.49% lineup as the brand\u2019s premium flagship sedan. It has a huge cargo area thanks to its liftback design and an impressive level of refinement in the cabin. The top trim is the SEL Premium model and it has some awesome tech features, but it also gets pretty expensive starting at $46,210. For the cost, you\u2019re getting massaging front seats, parallel and perpendicular parking assist, a surround-view camera, and some of the other comfort and convenience features you\u2019d expect like heated and ventilated leather seats, a heated steering wheel and premium audio.", "description": "You don\u2019t have to pay for fancy luxury brand emblems to enjoy comfort and great technology.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS909_at_lux_MG_20191008184839.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
