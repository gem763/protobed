BP ADRs are up about 4% to 5% early Monday morning in New York. Let's check out the charts and indicators with how they looked at Friday's close and add in a little imagination.\n\nIn the daily bar chart of Action Alerts PLUS holding BP, below, we can see that the stock price was already moving up ahead of this supply shock. A low in the middle of August can be seen and this is just a slight and temporary break of the late December low, which was also near $36. Prices were testing the declining 50-day simple moving average line last week and we should gap above it Monday. The slower-to-react 200-day moving average line has a negative slope and intersects just below $41.\n\nThe pattern of volume is interesting in that we can see much heavier volume from the middle of July into the middle of August as prices made that low. The daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line turned up from the middle of last month signaling a shift from aggressive selling to aggressive buying.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator crossed to the upside last month for a cover shorts buy signal and this week we should see it cross the zero line for an outright buy signal.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of BP, below, we can see that the $36 area has been a key level the past two years and each time it was reached it was a buying opportunity.\n\nPrices are below the declining 40-week moving average line but we can see the weekly OBV line turn up and the MACD oscillator narrow toward a cover shorts buy signal.\n\nIn this long-term weekly close only Point and Figure chart of BP, below, we can see that the software has projected a possible downside price target of $28. A weekly close at $45 or higher will turn this chart very bullish, in my opinion.\n\nBottom-line strategy: The attack and the eventual retaliation has only just begun in my humble opinion. Tensions will rise further and this will be in the feedback loop of energy prices. BP should be approached from the long side risking below $37. The key level above the market in $45.", "description": "BP Is Set to Rally - The Only Question Is How Much?...BP", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Bp Is Set To Rally - The Only Question Is How Much", "The Stock Price Was Already Moving Up Ahead Of This Supply Shock.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Jim Cramer", "James", "Rev Shark", "Bob Lang", "Carolyn Boroden", "Real Money"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/6e1867ff-294b-11e9-8a9a-bfb3b2a6c761.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
