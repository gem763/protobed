You can debate how dark a Moor is supposed to be in Shakespeare\u2019s vision, or in Verdi\u2019s, but as the predominantly white world of the performing arts gradually opens its eyes to the world around it, it seems increasingly problematic to cast white people in roles written for and about people of color.\n\nThe problem with Otello, however, is that there are very few tenors, white or black, who are able to sing the role. Thomas, now, is one of them, and the opera world is eager to seize on him, not only as an Otello but also as a representative of the diversity that the field claims to be desperately seeking.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYet in forcing Thomas and other black artists to be spokespeople for diversity, the field is essentially overlooking just what it is that makes them such notable artists in the first place. It\u2019s a sign of how opera, as well as other areas of the classical performing arts, continues to stubbornly otherize people who don\u2019t conform to the white template that has been the norm for so long \u2014 and hasn\u2019t, in fact, come very far at all.\n\n\u201cI am not an Otello,\u201d Thomas says over a recent brunch at a restaurant near Chinatown. It\u2019s a weekend morning that happens to be free of rehearsals, and Thomas is taking a break to discuss life with his son, Austin (who stays in Atlanta with his grandmother now that he\u2019s started school); his dream roles (he\u2019d like to sing more bel canto, the lighter melodious operas of Bellini and Donizetti); and, of course, diversity in opera, the topic he can\u2019t avoid. There needs, he says, to be more black administrators \u2014 an avenue he\u2019s starting to explore himself. \u201cIf you\u2019re not going to change the structure of the institutions,\u201d Thomas says, \u201cwhat\u2019s really going to happen?\u201d\n\nAs to his not being a true Otello, Thomas has some people fooled: The WNO production is his third outing this calendar year. (He has also sung the role two times in concert.)\n\nBut what Thomas is saying is rooted in a vocal self-knowledge he has had since he was a young singer. His voice, he says, is on the lighter end of the spectrum of voices capable of singing the role at all. Otello calls for a big, loud, dramatic voice that can pump out sound over the orchestra. \u201cI can put out a lot of sound,\u201d Thomas says, \u201cbut my voice doesn\u2019t thrive on that. It thrives on the softer moments. It thrives on the finesse.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAfter I do it,\u201d he adds, \u201cI just want to drink a whole bunch of water and lie down. And the next day I want to do nothing.\u201d\n\nAs a result, Thomas is wisely restricting future Otello performances. His next stage outing in the work will be in 2022. Yet the invitations continue to pour in.\n\nThomas always knew that as soon as he started doing Otello, he would risk being pigeonholed in the role. It\u2019s an extension of what has long been a problem with \u201cPorgy and Bess,\u201d an opera once again in the spotlight because of the current Metropolitan Opera production. That opera has traditionally been a mixed blessing at best for talented black singers; once you were invited to sing in \u201cPorgy,\u201d opera companies had even less incentive to cast you in anything else. Times have changed, though, as most of the Met\u2019s current \u201cPorgy\u201d cast have appeared in other roles with the company, and black male singers, who used to have particular difficulty breaking opera\u2019s color barrier, are better represented today on international stages than ever.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYet there\u2019s still quite a bit of pigeonholing. Issachah Savage, another black tenor who sings Otello, says he has a similar problem. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be only Otello,\u201d he says, \u201ceven though I love the role.\u201d\n\nSavage notes that standards may not be equal, either. \u201cFor so many years as Otello, we have endured Caucasian men in painted face,\u201d he says. \u201cNow that they\u2019re finally allowing African American men to do the role, the pressure is very steep.\u201d Black singers are examined under a more exacting lens than white ones in the same role.\n\nStereotyping black tenors certainly isn\u2019t new. George Shirley, 85, was the first African American tenor to perform a leading role at the Met. He recalls that in 1965, Gian Carlo Menotti asked him to do \u201cOtello\u201d at the Spoleto Festival, despite the fact that his lyric tenor voice was more suited to Mozart and the lighter Puccini operas. And that was long before houses saw any social pressure to start casting roles with more racial sensitivity and awareness.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut now that audiences and companies are becoming more aware of the cultural complications of casting white singers in nonwhite roles like Otello, Shirley is also concerned about typecasting.\n\n\u201cOpera is about the singing voice,\u201d he says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to do with what you look like. If it did, most of the stars we revere wouldn\u2019t have been onstage in the first place.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what costumes and makeup are for. You can\u2019t costume and makeup the voice.\u201d\n\nWhat you can do is add shadings to it \u2014 the finesse that Thomas describes, which he has been working for years to attain. When he arrived at the Metropolitan Opera\u2019s prestigious Lindemann Program as a young artist, James Levine promptly told him that he should sing only Mozart \u2014 no more Puccini. Thomas swallowed and plunged into learning Mozart roles. Eventually, he saw the benefits. \u201cOver time, I noticed that my voice was able to do more things,\u201d he says. \u201cIt had a bigger range of colors.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThomas gradually returned to the heavier repertoire that suits his voice \u2014 to Levine\u2019s chagrin. Long after leaving the program, after he had begun establishing himself on the world\u2019s stages, he returned to the Met to perform, and Levine asked him anxiously why he was singing so much Verdi. Thomas eventually gave him an answer \u2014 by singing aria after aria in a private vocal session, until Levine was convinced that Thomas had, after all, found his vocal home.\n\n\u201cBut don\u2019t sing Otello!\u201d Levine warned him, before wheeling out of the room.\n\n\u201cI had already agreed to do Otello in concert in Atlanta,\u201d Thomas says with a chuckle. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t tell him that.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nStill, the greatest compliment an opera company could pay Thomas, after hearing his Otello, would be to see him not as a black singer, but as just a singer \u2014 in short, to invite him to sing something else.\n\nOtello Oct. 26-Nov. 16 at Washington National Opera.\n\nAD", "description": "The opera singer will take on the role in the WNO season opener Oct. 26.", "authors": ["Anne Midgette", "Classical Music Critic"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/-iQkcjX0Vw95Clpwd8YzeV9vAwg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3G2OANHLRII6THDNINVA35HTDU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
