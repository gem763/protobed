Get out! Turn that phone off now, sir, ma\u2019am, whoever you are. Just, please, kindly.\u201d\n\nWhile the TV host's reaction drew a mixed reaction of laughter and shock from the audience, Williams immediately reminded the crowd that \u201ctickets are free,\u201d and the only caveat in attending a taping of the talk show is that all cellular devices must be turned off before the filming begins.\n\nThe Emmy-nominated host and author slightly pulled back on the reigns after firing off at the disruptor and admitted that she \u201cwas being overdramatic\u201d before once again asking her audience to silence their devices. \"Thank you,\" she added.\n\n\u201cThe Wendy Williams Show\u201d is currently airing its 11th season and has been renewed through 2022.\n\nLIFETIME DEVELOPING WENDY WILLIAMS BIOPIC\n\nNever one to hold her tongue, Williams has been taking her ex-husband and former business partner Kevin Hunter to task for reportedly having a baby with his alleged mistress, Sharina Hudson. Last week, Williams threw shade in both of their directions during her anticipated \u201cHot Topics\u201d segment.\n\n\u201cI used to say this as a joke on \u2018Hot Topics': Poke a hole in the condom and get pregnant, but that backfired on me, didn\u2019t it?\u201d she said, alluding to Hudson's alleged love child. \u201cTurnabout\u2019s a fair game, I\u2019m a fair game player and a straight shooter, too. Pow, pow!\u201d\n\nWilliams then further shaded Hudson.\n\n\u201cLife is not what you think it is behind the scenes, trust me. Homegirl is miserable,\u201d she said as she rocked a pretend baby. \u201cIn the meantime, I'm over here.
