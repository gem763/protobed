Wall Street Is Excited Anyway.", "language": "en", "text": "Text size\n\nBeyond Meat stock is volatile\u2014as seen in its 3.9% drop on Wednesday. Learning to trade hot, new, disruptive technologies trade is challenging, to say the least. That hasn\u2019t stopped Wall Street from feeding the frenzy over the stock.\n\nWednesday, Canadian doughnut chain Tim Horton\u2019s announced plans to scale back some Beyond Meat (ticker: BYND) promotions. That could have caused the drop. Or perhaps the decline was catalyzed by charges alternative meat is too heavily processed, making nutrients less \u201cbioavailable.\u201d That\u2019s what celebrity chef James Peisker said on Fox Business show Varney & Co. Wednesday morning.\n\nHigher volatility is something investors need to be ready for when buying into big new trends. Alternative-meat\u2014meat that mimics actual animal protein and is intended as a substitute for meat eaters and not only vegetarians\u2014is so new even seemingly small changes can impact corporate valuation meaningfully. Still, Wall Street believes in the alternative-meat industry.\n\n\u201cThe meat industry stands at over $1.4 trillion and is set to reach $2.7 trillion by 2040,\u201d writes Jefferies equity strategist Simon Powell in a Tuesday research report. \u201cAlternative meat is still in an embryonic stage\u2014our best case is $470 billion of total meat market by 2040, worst case a mere $90 billion.\u201d\n\nPowell says a \u201cmeat tax\u201d implemented by environmentalists or China\u2019s pork crisis could be catalysts for rapid alternative-meat adoption. Don\u2019t forget, African swine fever is threatening a huge portion of Chinese supply, and China is the world\u2019s largest consumer of pork.\n\n\u201cThere are emerging calls for a Meat Tax, given the impact on the climate and increasing focus on the possible negative health consequences of a meat-heavy diet,\u201d adds Powell in his report. \u201cThe recent introduction of increased sugar taxes around the world is one example of how the meat industry could be subject to a similar tax.\u201d\n\nThose are bold ideas and huge numbers. Beyond Meat, after all, is expected to sell about $416 million worth of alt-protein in 2020. If Powell is correct and Beyond Meat captures just 5% of his addressable market, then Beyond sales could grow to $23 billion, growing sales 22% a year on average for a generation. Early in a new product\u2019s life-cycle, when market share is low, the possibilities seem limitless.\n\nIt sounds great, but investors need to beware of playing that game. Any end market, including protein, is complex, making top-down analysis a risky starting point.\n\nWithin the market for protein, for instance, there are different cultures, different animals, and different cuts of meat coming from the different animals. David Lipman, chief science officer of privately held Beyond competitor Impossible Foods, tells Barron\u2019s that form and flavor aren\u2019t barriers to product expansion. Still, there could be a limit to what consumers adopt. Maybe there won\u2019t be a Beyond Meat rib-eye, bone-in steak in the future. If that\u2019s the case, analysts could be overcooking the total addressable market.\n\nBarron\u2019s has already advised caution when considering Beyond stock, recently writing we would avoid Beyond Meat shares. So is this just sour grapes on our part? No, but we have to admit we have been wrong thus far. The company\u2019s execution has been strong, with new products popping up in new locations, but we can\u2019t get over valuation. Beyond trades for more than 20 times estimated next year\u2019s sales. Since our story appeared more than three months ago, Beyond Shares have climbed 50%. It has been a bumpy ride though\u2014shares hit more than $234 before falling to $153.99.\n\nOf course, it is important to consider big secular trends, like Powell\u2019s report does, but it\u2019s equally important to stay grounded and not depend on the most optimistic scenarios to justify stock purchases.\n\nJefferies is hosting an \u201cAlternative Meats Day\u201d in New York in early December. Maybe that will be a catalyst for the alternative-meat sector. hopes to attend,\n\nPowell is an equity strategist at Jefferies, he doesn\u2019t cover or recommend the stock. Analyst Kevin Grundy covers the stock for the brokerage, and rates shares Hold with a $190 price target.\n\nWrite to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.com", "description": "Beyond Meat stock is volatile.
