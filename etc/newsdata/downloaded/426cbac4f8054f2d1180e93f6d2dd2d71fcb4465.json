But that would only happen with a lot of political weight,\" a source told ZDNet, adding that right now, there also seems to be no social pressure to halt the decision.\n\nIt is also possible that the concerns outlined in congressman Figueiredo's bill will only be considered after the board of the National Data Protection Authority (ANPD) is chosen and work actually begins. The five names leading the ANPD have yet to be announced by president Bolsonaro - it is understood that the group will include at least two representatives of the military.\n\nGovernment plans to set up a single citizen database have been criticized for reasons including the fact that it is the type of decision where the ANPD should have input and participation, to ensure compliance with Brazil's data protection regulations, to be enforced in August 2020.", "description": "A new bill aims to reverse the president's decision to centralize and share personal data across the public sector.", "authors": ["Angelica Mari"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/28/e4b06a81-b03c-4e4b-91d0-d308fb0939cf/thumbnail/770x578/582a61175aed89b780a11970a0b0b57f/technology-science-and-cloud-computer-3d-illustration.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
