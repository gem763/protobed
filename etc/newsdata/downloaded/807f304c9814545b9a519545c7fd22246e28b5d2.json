He worked for the London Review of Books and the Independent on Sunday before moving to Italy in 1999. He published The Dark Heart of Italy in 2003 and has written three detective novels set in Italy. He returned to Somerset for 14 years to co-found Windsor Hill Wood offering sanctuary to people in crisis (the subject of his 2015 book A Place of Refuge). In 2017 Jones moved back to Parma, where he lives with his wife Francesca and three children. His latest book is Ultra: The Underworld of Italian Football.\n\nWhat got you interested in the ultras?\n\nI\u2019ve always been fascinated by subcultures and I\u2019ve always been a football nut. And I suppose the main themes of my professional career have been crime and community, both of which the ultras seemed to encapsulate.\n\nYou spent a lot of time with the hardcore supporters of Cosenza, a relatively obscure team from the south. Was it hard to gain their trust?\n\nI was concerned it would be, but I found them surprisingly welcoming and open \u2013 and actually exit has almost been harder than access. Critical distance is difficult when you\u2019ve been hanging out with people for two or three years, going to their houses and meeting their families.\n\nDid you feel any trepidation about entering these groups?\n\nI remember going to one of the ultra dens of a very big club, to write a story [for the Guardian], and the Italian journalist I was talking to advised me very strongly not to go, and phoned me every half hour to check I was OK. Those kind of things make you nervous. But I quickly worked out how to do it: present yourself as a writer rather than going in the side door without telling anyone. If they say yes, then happy days.\n\nYou approach a particularly intimidating senior figure and ask if his ultras haven\u2019t become too arrogant. That struck me as a bit touch and go.\n\nYeah. A lot of them have a short fuse, and they openly talk about their own violent nature. But they are also very intelligent, canny operators, and they\u2019re not going to beat up an English writer unless he does something really, really stupid. Actually I did get a kicking once, but I didn\u2019t put it in because I didn\u2019t want the book to be about me and my psychology.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nI was walking by myself with a Cosenza scarf on, thinking I\u2019d hook up with the Cosenza fans on the way to the stadium. Then I was surrounded by seven people with different coloured scarves and they told me to take mine off. I refused and that\u2019s when it kicked off. But it\u2019s absurd: why would I, a boy from Somerset, refuse to take off a scarf of a Calabrian team that I\u2019d only discovered a couple of years before?\n\nYou mostly use \u201cwe\u201d rather than \u201cI\u201d when writing about your exploits with the Cosenza ultras. Were you trying to efface yourself from the story or is it also a sign that you were getting caught up in the action?\n\nIt\u2019s interesting: about a year ago a friend sent me a YouTube video of me singing [for Cosenza] with the veins popping in the neck and I thought, blimey, is this too immersive? But [using \u201cwe\u201d] is partly me trying to convey a sense of the absolute safety and exuberance and ecstasy that you feel when you\u2019re in a massive crowd singing a song after a couple of beers.\n\nThe book also shows what a grim, exhausting existence it can be for many ultras. Can you understand why people dedicate their lives to these movements?\n\nYeah I can, and I think belonging is at the centre of it. It\u2019s a truism, but in an age of alienation and loneliness, people are so desperate for any kind of belonging, even if it comes with some dark or scary aspects. In the book, I was really trying to show that a lot of these lads \u2013 they\u2019re mostly lads \u2013 were fatherless or without family or vulnerable in some way, and this was the only tribe they had. I\u2019m fortunate to come from a settled family, but I can still find [ultra life] incredibly beguiling.\n\nViolence is a central part of what they are, and they\u2019re very honest about that\n\nUltras are widely derided as \u201canimals\u201d, but the book challenges that narrative. Tell me about some of the more positive things you witnessed.\n\nA lot of charitable work goes on. They\u2019ve all got causes \u2013 maybe one of their daughters has cancer and they fund her medical bills. I\u2019m well aware of the criticism here: the mafia gives money to hospitals; fascist parties give out food parcels to the destitute. It\u2019s not unproblematic. But they always complain that journalists never write about this side of things.\n\nThey are also eloquent critics of modern football and what it has become. The money in the football industry is so immense and even journalists are often uncritical, because the football circus pays the bills. Whereas the ultras point out what\u2019s wrong about football. Everything they stand for, modern football is the opposite. They stand for rootedness and football is completely rootless. They\u2019re loyal and football is disloyal. The fascism, the far-right extremism, all of that exists and it\u2019s repugnant. But there are many terraces that claim to be inclusive. They would argue that they are places of tolerance where anyone can go.\n\nWhat connections exist between ultras and the far right in Italy, and how important is the ultra movement to far-right politicians?\n\nFor a very long time, through the 70s, 80s and 90s, hardcore ultra groups gave visibility to certain symbols and gestures associated with fascism, in a time when you would never see a Roman salute or a swastika. When a lot of middle-aged, far-left ultras left the scene, there was a vacuum into which the neofascist parties, most of all Forza Nuova, sent their troops. Now you can see an overlap of personalities between certain terrace leaders and leading figures in the far right. If your group has a membership in the thousands, that\u2019s a big electorate that needs to be wooed. Some of the rhetoric the ultras were using in the 80s and 90s, Matteo Salvini is now tweeting almost identical phrases.\n\nDid your basic understanding of ultras evolve while researching this book?\n\nBehind the news stories and the ferocious, snarling facades, it\u2019s amazing how many of them are retired accountants, lawyers or university professors, as far removed from thuggery and the far right as you can imagine.\n\nYou quote one ultra saying that football without violence is like cooking without salt. Does that apply, even with the retired accountants?\n\nI think so. I\u2019ve yet to meet an ultra who doesn\u2019t say that [violence] is a central part of this way of life, that\u2019s just what it is. They\u2019re very honest about that.", "description": "The author of a book on the hardcore fans discusses their political connections, charitable deeds \u2013 and the day he got a kicking", "authors": ["Killian Fox", "Tobias Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5f033652a2388cb80583a38cb72fb94ce37be05/0_99_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f179bbefbd749995487efc288e6f0747", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
