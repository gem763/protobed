The U.S. State Department is \u201cdeeply shaken\u201d and \u201creeling,\u201d thanks in part to Donald Trump\u2019s political appointees who are politicizing the department \u201cin ways that undermine U.S. ties to other countries.\u201d Attorney General Bill Barr, meanwhile, is endangering our relationships abroad, prompting backlashes among American allies, in pursuit of assorted conspiracy theories.\n\nMuch of the administration\u2019s foreign policy initiatives have completely unraveled, including the failed nuclear negotiations with North Korea.\n\nAnd then, of course, there\u2019s Donald Trump, who\u2019s come up with a new policy in Syria.\n\nThe U.S. military has moved its forces away from the Turkish border with northern Syria, after the White House said Sunday night that Turkey would soon begin an operation in a part of northeastern Syria where it wants to resettle Syrian refugees \u2013 and that U.S. forces wouldn\u2019t be there to help or stop them. The U.S. has not received orders to commence a large-scale withdrawal from the region, remaining in a \u201cwait and see\u201d position, according to a U.S. official with direct knowledge of the situation. In a statement issued late Sunday, the White House said Turkey would \u201csoon be moving forward\u201d with its \u201clong-planned operation\u201d in northern Syria and that the United States wouldn\u2019t be involved.\n\nIf it sounds like Trump is abandoning the Kurds just a few days after the Trump administration said the opposite, it\u2019s because that\u2019s precisely what\u2019s happening.\n\nThe president\u2019s new policy, if anyone can call it that, goes against \u201cthe recommendations of top officials in the Pentagon and the State Department,\u201d whose judgment the president tends to disregard.\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, it\u2019s understandable. It was 10 months ago when Trump, following a conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, announced an impulsive and unexpected troop withdrawal from Syria, blindsiding our allies, U.S. military leaders, and the White House\u2019s own congressional allies.\n\nAnd here we are again, watching Trump announce another impulsive and unexpected troop withdrawal from Syria following a conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, blindsiding our allies, U.S. military leaders, and the White House\u2019s own congressional allies.\n\nBrett McGurk, who served as the special presidential envoy for international coalition to combat ISIS, argued on Twitter overnight, \u201cDonald Trump is not a Commander-in-Chief. He makes impulsive decisions with no knowledge or deliberation. He sends military personnel into harm\u2019s way with no backing. He blusters and then leaves our allies exposed when adversaries call his bluff or he confronts a hard phone call.\u201d\n\nFor his part, the Republican president has published a series of very strange tweets on the subject, acknowledging his abandonment of the Kurds, claiming Russia is \u201cunhappy\u201d with his decision (despite the opposite being true), asserting that he\u2019s \u201cobliterated\u201d Turkey\u2019s economy in the past, and claiming to have \u201cgreat and unmatched wisdom.\u201d\n\nNo, really, that\u2019s what he wrote. It\u2019s not my attempt at creating some kind of ridiculous caricature of Trump; it\u2019s what Trump actually published online.\n\nWhat I continue to find amazing is the absence of a policymaking process. A coherent foreign policy is rooted in a mature, deliberate decision-making process, where consequences are weighed carefully.\n\nWith Trump, none of that happens. There\u2019s no interagency process. There\u2019s no consultation with Congress or key U.S. military leaders. There\u2019s no coordination with allies. There\u2019s just a reckless amateur president, acting on impulse, following conversations with foreign leaders he struggles to understand.", "description": "There's no policymaking process, per se.
