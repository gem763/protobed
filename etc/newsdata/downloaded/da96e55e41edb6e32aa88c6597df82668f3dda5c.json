We will take a comprehensive look to uncover these core recommendations, factoring respective salaries into the analysis.\n\nPlease note, these player picks were organized early in the day. For MLB contests, always check lineups and weather closer to game time. Rain, wind, or unexpected managerial decisions could open up additional sources of value. Be sure to keep an eye on the MLB Headlines and Injuries desk.\n\nWe\u2019re cooking with 14 games tonight.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nPITCHER\n\nJacob deGrom \u2013 New York Mets (at Reds)\n\nWhen evaluating pitchers, it\u2019s easy to get caught up secondary considerations. deGrom is visiting Luis Castillo at power friendly Great American Ballpark. While it\u2019s obviously a challenging combination of opponent and venue, what really matters is deGrom himself. He projects to deliver close to seven innings and nine strikeouts. For many of the other good pitchers in the slate, that\u2019s their upside. With deGrom, it\u2019s just a 50th percentile outcome. Since he\u2019s cheaper than Shane Bieber and comparably priced to Charlie Morton, I do expect deGrom to be the most-owned pitcher.\n\nAlso Consider: Shane Bieber, Clayton Kershaw, Charlie Morton, Zack Greinke, Anibal Sanchez (value), Steven Brault (value)\n\nCATCHER / FIRST BASE\n\nMitch Garver \u2013 Minnesota Twins (vs Eric Skoglund)\n\nStory continues\n\nA common play is to leave the catcher slot for a cheap value play. Tonight, Garver represents an opportunity to flip the script. He\u2019s the second-rated hitter \u2013 behind a teammate who we\u2019ll discuss in a moment. He has a nearly 40 percent chance for a home run. It\u2019s not just a homer-or-bust profile either \u2013 Garver works counts and hits for a high average. Skoglund is in the mix for worst pitcher in the majors. The Royals bullpen is weak too.\n\nAlso Consider: Will Smith, Yasmani Grandal, Cody Bellinger, Max Muncy (value), Freddie Freeman, Jose Abreu, Pete Alonso, Joc Pederson (value)\n\nSECOND BASE\n\nGavin Lux \u2013 Los Angeles Dodgers (vs Peter Lambert)\n\nIf you\u2019re rostering Garver at catcher, you\u2019ll need to cut some corners elsewhere. Fortunately, Lux rates around the fifth best at second best despite a bargain price tag. The Dodgers top prospect has produced mixed results through his first 49 plate appearances. Nobody is getting excited about a .267/.327/.467 batting line. It\u2019s merely decent. However, a peek under the hood at his batted ball profile reveals what should be a high BABIP, high-powered approach. I\u2019d hazard to say he\u2019s been unlikely. A matchup against Lambert is an opportunity for him to blast off.\n\nAlso Consider: Max Muncy, Gleyber Torres, Jeff McNeil, Whit Merrifield, Jonathan Schoop (value)\n\nTHIRD BASE\n\nJosh Donaldson \u2013 Atlanta Braves (vs Tyler Beede)\n\nOn his good days, Beede is effectively wild. Donaldson\u2019s superb plate discipline should serve him well in selecting hittable pitches to wallop deep into the night. Beede is homer prone (1.67 HR/9), and Donaldson is among the league leaders in power production. He has around a one-in-four chance for a big fly. Compared to the other top third basemen in this slate, he\u2019s relatively cheap.\n\nAlso Consider: Anthony Rendon, Miguel Sano, Yoan Moncada, Justin Turner, Matt Chapman (value)\n\nSHORTSTOP\n\nFrancisco Lindor \u2013 Cleveland Indians (vs Drew Smyly)\n\nAlthough Smyly has pitched passably for the Phillies, he\u2019s remained ridiculously homer prone - 1.99 HR/9 for Philly, 2.64 HR/9 on the season. Over his career, Lindor has better plate discipline versus southpaws. He projects for around one-third of a home run to go with all the myriad other ways he might produce DFS value. Lindor is the only elite name in the Indians offense, and yet a full stack could prove to be a sneaky-good option.\n\nAlso Consider: Tim Anderson (value), Gleyber Torres, Jorge Polanco, Trea Turner, Manny Machado (value)\n\nOUTFIELD\n\nNelson Cruz \u2013 Minnesota Twins (vs Eric Skoglund)\n\nIf Garver looks attractive, then Cruz is downright irresistible. He\u2019s the likeliest hitter to hit a home run. And as we saw last night, one blast can easily be followed by another. There\u2019s nothing complicated to this analysis. Skoglund and friends will almost certainly serve up multiple home runs. Cruz is the best bet to be a part of the action.\n\nFranmil Reyes \u2013 Cleveland Indians (vs Drew Smyly)\n\nHome runs are the name of the game tonight with several games expected to include oodles of the big lies. Reyes is nearly as likely as Cruz to ring the bell. He even has similar opportunity for a multi-homer extravaganza. The downside to Reyes is that he often zeroes out when not posting big point totals. It\u2019s an all-or-nothing approach that\u2019s better served to GPPs than 50/50s and smaller contests.\n\nAlso Consider: Cody Bellinger, Yordan Alvarez, Ronald Acuna, Aaron Judge, Juan Soto, Jeff McNeil, Eloy Jimenez (value), Yasiel Puig (value), Joc Pederson (value), Ryan McBroom (value)", "description": "Brad Johnson finds the best MLB DFS Plays for Friday, September 20.
