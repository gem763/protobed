One second later, Jones wrapped his arm around Tate\u2019s chest and right arm well before a pass from Daniel Jones arrived. The interference seemed obvious in real time. In slow motion, it looked nothing less than indefensible.\n\n\n\nThe officials disagreed. The call went to vice president of officiating Al Riveron for review in New York and it stood. And just like that, one mistake showcased one huge mess that is getting under the skin of head coaches.\n\nGiants head coach Pat Shurmur reacts after losing a challenge in the first half against the Patriots. He would be just as upset in the second half after losing a challenge over a non-pass interference call (AP)\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, download it here.]\n\nIt was the kind of call that left Shurmur giving a resigned explanation: \u201cWe see that replay doesn\u2019t overturn much, so I\u2019m not surprised.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Tate could only offer, \u201cI\u2019m not the referee and I don\u2019t make the rules.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\n#NFL officials have gone rogue. 100-percent. This wasn\u2019t called on the field and then wasn\u2019t changed after it was flagged by the #Giants. So they ruled TWICE that this wasn\u2019t defensive pass interference. Which is just blatantly wrong and a purposeful refusal to change the call. pic.twitter.com/BY2rRE6gQc \u2014 Charles Robinson (@CharlesRobinson) October 11, 2019\n\nThe way pass interference challenges have been called this season looks like the league\u2019s officials (and Riveron specifically) are thumbing their noses at coaches. To the New Orleans Saints\u2019 Sean Payton, who championed the pass interference challenge in the offseason. To the Dallas Cowboys\u2019 Jason Garrett, who delivered an impassioned speech to help drive it though. And also to guys like the Kansas City Chiefs\u2019 Andy Reid and Patriots\u2019 Bill Belichick, who urged coaches to work hard on getting some kind of rules resolution to the problem of blown calls.\n\n\n\nAfter all that work, after the debacle in the NFC title game that arguably cost the New Orleans Saints a Super Bowl berth, after everything that could have gone wrong with these challenges, it\u2019s the least expected breakdown that\u2019s causing a ruckus: The NFL\u2019s officials aren\u2019t just getting things wrong with pass interference \u2014 it looks like they\u2019re upholding the wrong call out of sheer stubbornness after being challenged.\n\nThe NFL\u2019s coaches raised hell in the offseason to get an opportunity to correct mistakes on the field and now they\u2019re being blunted by some of the same officials they were trying to overcome. To the point that in the first month of the season, only seven reversals were made in 31 pass interference challenges. A 22.6 percent reversal rate through four games wouldn\u2019t be so bad \u2014 except that in bouts of ridiculously poor judgement, some officiating crews are doing things like what we saw Thursday night between the Patriots and Giants.\n\n\n\nSimply put, they\u2019re ignoring the right call and sending a message to coaches that even obvious penalties aren\u2019t going to be called right. Why? Because it\u2019s a judgement call.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s the get-out-of-jail-free card for officials in this fiasco: Not only is the initial pass interference call (or non-pass interference) based on an official\u2019s judgment \u2014 the replay is, too. That means officials can get something wrong in real time and then get it wrong again via instant replay, merely because they\u2019re given the latitude to do it.\n\n\n\nHow\u2019s that for an effective rule?\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s the truth: It\u2019s not. If anything, it\u2019s a bigger problem than it was when the NFC title game mistake occurred. At least in that debacle, you didn\u2019t know if the official meant to get the call wrong. What happened Thursday was clear. It was the wrong call once. Then it was the wrong call twice. And now the system looks like it\u2019s broken. Or worse, corrupted by humans who can\u2019t accept their own failure.\n\n\n\nIf the NFL thought it had a mess on its hands last January, then it should be hitting a panic button right now. It\u2019s one thing to get something wrong and accidentally change the outcome of history. If something like Thursday night\u2019s mistake repeats itself in a game that matters \u2014 or heaven forbid, in the postseason \u2014 the league will have given the ultimate unchecked freedom to officials.\n\n\n\nThe ability to acquit themselves of their own mistakes simply because they can.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The way pass interference challenges have been called this season looks like officials are thumbing their noses at coaches.", "authors": ["Charles Robinson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/bN6KdbaktqADTijUAV5XAA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NDYuOTMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/WqR8SvRqt54eqaj9qqcS4w--~B/aD0zMTU4O3c9NDc3MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/f9880470-ebf0-11e9-bf5b-795dac675d84", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
