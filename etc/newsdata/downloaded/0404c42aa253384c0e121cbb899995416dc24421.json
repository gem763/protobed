In the fifth inning, Soto sent a home run deep into the night and carried his bat to first base, mimicking the move done by Astros star Alex Bregman earlier in the game.\n\nAD\n\nAlex Bregman carried his bat to first base after homering.\n\n\n\nJuan Soto made sure he did too when he gave the Nationals the lead \ud83d\udc40\n\n\n\n(via @FOXSports)pic.twitter.com/pQigeey6uG \u2014 Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) October 30, 2019\n\n\u201cI love him carrying that bat to first base, everything,\u201d Beal said. \u201cIf they\u2019re going to do that, return the favor: Smack that [expletive] out the park and then you drop the bat right at first base.\u201d\n\nBeal joins teammate John Wall in the Juan Soto fan club. Wall\u2019s baseball tweets consist of him simply typing an elongated version of the 21-year-old\u2019s name, and last week Wall wore a Soto No. 22 jersey. Soto\u2019s popularity with these NBA players certainly has something to do with the unconventional way he plays a traditional game.\n\nAD\n\nWhile Beal, a former shortstop in his youth, loves Soto, he hates baseball\u2019s stuffy rules about showing emotion. In the NBA, a scream after a dunk or a stare-down after crossing someone over are part of the game. So in that sense, Soto \u2014 with his antics in the box and that bat-carrying taunt \u2014 has the swag of a basketball player.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t disagree \u2026 with balls and strikes. You can\u2019t really celebrate and taunt like you want to. It sucks, but I\u2019m glad I play basketball,\u201d Beal said. \u201cAt the end of day, they\u2019re pro athletes, too. They work on their craft. They get excited. They get emotional about the game, too, so why not let them have some celebrations after they hit a home run? Why not? Let a pitcher do the same thing when he strikes somebody out. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s disrespecting the game.\u201d\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nAD", "description": "With the Wizards hosting Houston's NBA team, the Rockets, at the same time as Game 7 between the cities' MLB franchises, Capital One Arena will play the World Series on its scoreboard postgame.", "authors": ["Candace Buckner", "National Basketball Association With An Emphasis In Covering The Washington Wizards."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/OY4jtM35XK_Eb38BvC-XWspWyD0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/G64KHKHWAAI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
