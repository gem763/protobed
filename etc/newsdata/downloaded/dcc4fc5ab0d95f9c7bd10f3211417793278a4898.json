She broke the American three times, including the first game of the match, to take the first set in just 33 minutes.\n\n\"She's a very good server, so I had to make sure my serve went well today,\" Andreescu said. \"I think when I do play big servers, my serve kind of levels up with them unconsciously. I don't know how but it does, which is a good thing. I'm really pleased with that.\"\n\nIt was much of the same in the second set as Andreescu mixed her powerful forehand with soft, deft drop shots to propel her to victory. The Canadian won the second set 6-3.\n\n\"I think today was a very solid match from my end,\" she said. \"I executed the right tactics, I stayed as positive as I could because yesterday wasn't so (good) on the attitude aspect of things.\n\n\"Today, I'm really proud with my attitude. I think that was the main thing today, and my serve.\"\n\nWhat Andreescu has done this season is nothing short of remarkable and it is continuing in Beijing.
