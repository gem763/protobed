Inflation is curbing affordability while an expected economic slowdown in Germany will test current prices, UBS said.\n\nGlobally, the bank said price growth rates have continued to slow in a majority of cities and average price growth stagnated for the first time since 2012. Lending is matching gross domestic product growth for the most part in contrast to the years before the 2008 financial crisis when outstanding mortgage volumes increased at as much as 2.5 per cent faster than GDP, UBS said.\n\nFrankfurt was the only city to see double-digit percentage increases in house prices, which were common in previous years, the bank said.\n\nHowever, affordability remains a key risk as the median price-to-income ratio has risen from five to seven years as the time needed to pay for an apartment in cities over the last decade, with Hong Kong and London the worst affected while Singapore was the most improved, the study showed.\n\nVancouver ranked 10th on that metric at eight years while Toronto was 20th most expensive at six years, the report showed.\n\n\u201cBuying a 60-metre-square (650-square-feet) apartment exceeds the budget of people who earn the average annual incomes in the highly-skilled service sector in most world cities,\u201d UBS said. \u201cUnaffordable housing is often a sign of strong investment demand from abroad, tight zoning and rental market regulations.\u201d", "description": "Vancouver is sixth, according to UBS", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/toronto.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
