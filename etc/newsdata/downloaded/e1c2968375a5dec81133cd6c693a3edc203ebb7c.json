Zoey was having 10 seizures a day and, on the advice of her neurologist, she was treated with phenobarbital, a common drug for epilepsy.\n\nInterested in Marijuana? Add Marijuana as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Marijuana news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nBut Zoey\u2019s mother, Dawn Lee-Carty, was unaware of the drug's side effects. Two weeks later, she realized the long road ahead when Zoey began to have an adverse reaction. For years, their lives centered around medications, doctor\u2019s visits and numerous hospital admissions. And the frequency of the seizures only increased.\n\nThen, in 2016, -- when Zoey was 8 years old -- Lee-Carty flew to Colorado to learn all about cannabidiol oil after watching an interview about medical marijuana. She said it had a dramatic impact, and that Zoey\u2019s seizures decreased by half.\n\nWashington D.C., where the family lives, allows the use of medical marijuana to those with a license. But the family hit a roadblock when Zoey, who just turned 12, was told that her charter school would not permit the drug to be administered on school grounds.\n\nEarlier this month, in response to Zoey's case, the city council passed the \"Student Medical Marijuana Patient Fairness Temporary Amendment Act of 2019\" -- emergency legislation to clarify existing law and ensure that qualifying students can be given medical marijuana by a school nurse.\n\nWith its passage, Washington D.C. joins eight states that have put a similar law on the books -- though the number is a fraction of the 33 states -- in addition to the District of Columbia -- that allow medicinal marijuana at all, according to the National Conference of State Legislators.\n\nEight minors in Washington D.C. hold medical marijuana licenses, according to to the Washington Post, which cited data from the district\u2019s Department of Health.\n\nFrederic J. Brown/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cMedical marijuana works different from typical prescribed medications,\u201d said Dr. Anand Dugar, an anesthesiologist and the owner of Green Health Docs. \u201cMedical marijuana binds to the endocannabinoid system which is present throughout the body. Typical prescription medications do not bind to this system and instead affect other receptors in the body.\u201d\n\nAccording to Shane Khalepari, the Regulatory Affairs Coordinator for Americans for Safe Access, several states like California are currently reviewing their policies to allow medical marijuana on campuses.\n\n\u201cMedical marijuana should be treated as an EpiPen, where a physician can administer the medication to students,\u201d Khalepari said. \u201cCities and States need to take the necessary steps to give the appropriate access for seriously ill children.\u201d\n\nZoey's mother first became aware of cannabidiol oil in 2016, when Zoey was 8 years old and Lee-Carty saw an interview about medical marijuana. After she traveled to Colorado, Zoey eventually got a prescription. Within a month, Zoey\u2019s seizures had decreased by fifty perfect, her mother said.\n\n\u201cZoey was having up to 65 seizures a day while she was on prescribed medication,\u201d Dawn-Lee Carty said. \u201cThe doctors couldn\u2019t get them to stop and she had exhausted all of her pharmaceutical options.\u201d\n\nNow, Lee-Carty grows medical marijuana for her daughter and has made it her life\u2019s mission to advocate for its use. She founded SpeakLife, an organization that supports research and the legalization of the drug.\n\nLee-Carty said she is now struggling to obtain a license for herself.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a struggle every day,\u201d Lee-Carty said. \u201cBut I have a beautiful little girl who is my best friend. I will continue to fight for her.\u201d", "description": "Eight states and now Washington D.C. also allow prescribed medical marijuana in school.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/General/marijuana-02-as-dc-gty-190927_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
