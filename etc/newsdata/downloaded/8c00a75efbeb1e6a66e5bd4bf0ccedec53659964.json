They continued towards the middle of the road, started panicking.\n\n\u2018I continued braking, throughout the whole time, from the time I saw them on the kerb until the time I stopped, my foot was slammed down the whole time.\n\nJason Imi\u2019s wife Sarah said Coopey did not care about anyone \u2018but himself\u2019 (Picture: INS News)\n\n\u2018They got to about halfway and I was very close, I do not know but it looked like they were panicking from my view, they continued quickly, tried to make it.\n\n\u2018One of them went in front, the other followed him, behind him. From my point of view, it looked like they were panicking and quickly tried to run across the crossing and quickly get across.\u2019\n\nLawyers for Mr Imi and Mr Shackley\u2019s families have now said Coopey\u2019s account suggests he could have been speeding.\n\nAdventurous dog went on solo bus ride for an hour before anyone noticed\n\nIt means the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) could potentially charge him with causing death by dangerous driving.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe lawyers told the inquest that a tyre mark on the road showed Coopey had only applied the brakes at the point of impact, despite having two seconds to react.\n\nPC White was then asked by assistant coroner Alison McCormick whether Coopey\u2019s evidence \u2018means he was likely to have been going more than 50mph\u2019.\n\nHe responded: \u2018I would have to consider a range of speeds.\u2019\n\nGrandfather John Shackley died instantly in the crash (Picture: INS News)\n\nMs McCormick then asked if his report conclusion would be different given the additional evidence, to which he replied: \u2018The reconstruction process would have been different in the sense that I would have considered, is he saying that he saw them and braked straight away?\u2019\n\nCoopey, who was 17 at the time of the crash, was previously accused of showing no remorse as he complained in court that the incident had affected his mental well-being.\n\nMr Shackley\u2019s daughter Danielle, 31, said: \u2018Coopey is basically sat there laughing at us. We cannot rest and we cannot grieve.\n\n\u2018We are not getting any justice at all and we are not being treated properly. How can you get behind the wheel of a car while you are high on drugs, kill two people and not go to prison for it?\u2019\n\nCatholic priest caught trying to meet 'paedophile' to abuse his son, 2\n\nWhile Mr Imi\u2019s widow, Sarah, said: \u2018As we try to rebuild our lives, we are reminded that this boy just does not care about anyone but himself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018His parents are both serving police officers, as yet there is no decency in either of them \u2013 not once have they attempted to apologise for our loss.\u2019\n\nCoopey is currently facing a possible jail sentence for the separate crime of illegally driving a car just weeks after killing Mr Shackley and Mr Imi.\n\nHe also has a string of previous convictions dating back to when he was 12, including common assault, robbery and drugs.\n\nA spokesperson for Thames Valley Police confirmed that a review of Coopey\u2019s new statement is \u2018currently being undertaken\u2019.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
