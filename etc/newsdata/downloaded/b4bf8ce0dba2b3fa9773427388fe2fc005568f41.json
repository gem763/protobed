She already left is what we need to remember, so we were so lucky to have these last seasons with her in it.\"\n\n\"And it was just so fun to have her back and she brought so much to the show that I am just living in the gratitude of her second return,\" he continued. \"And I hopefully will live in the gratitude of her third return. Because we are much like the mob, you can't get out. And I do hope and think that she will come back sometime.\"\n\nCohen went on to discuss the possible ways that Frankel might pop up in new seasons of the Real Housewives.\n\n\"She's [still such] a part of everything that's going on, that you almost could see her dropping in,\" he mused. \"And it's like, 'Oh my god!' You know? \u2026Bethenny's at a party or Bethenny's on this trip or\u2026you never know.\"\n\nWhen asked to dish on the drama that prompted her departure, Cohen remained tight-lipped, stating, \"I'm gonna leave it in my gratitude.\"\n\nIn late August, Frankel confirmed to ET that she had decided to \"leave the Housewives franchise to explore my next chapter. It's time to move on and focus on my daughter, my philanthropy and my production partnership with Mark Burnett, producing and starring in shows which represent a shift in the conversation for women.\"\n\nFrankel has been a part of RHONY since 2008. She left the show after the third season in 2010, before rejoining in 2015.\n\nSince, she's been keeping busy. After Hurricane Dorian battered the Bahamas through the weekend, Frankel flew into Miami on Tuesday and she, along with her disaster relief initiative, bstrong, have been coordinating aid for survivors.\n\nSee loads more on the Real Housewives below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nBethenny Frankel Travels to Florida and the Bahamas to Help Hurricane Dorian Victims\n\nBethenny Frankel Explains Decision to Leave 'RHONY' and Her Tweet About Still Being Married\n\nBethenny Frankel Reveals She's Still Legally Married to Jason Hoppy\n\nRelated Articles:", "description": "Hear the show's executive producer weigh in on Frankel's departure.", "authors": ["Scott Baumgartner"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/LIPJSAHR1WBMVTPg90JnSA--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/fdebb18d976bcc8e23aa3895710e4a31"}
