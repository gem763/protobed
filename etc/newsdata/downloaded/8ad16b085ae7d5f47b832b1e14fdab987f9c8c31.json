And one of our best values in America is free speech. We\u2019re allowed to say what we want to say and we\u2019re allowed to speak up on injustices, and that\u2019s just how it goes.\u201d\n\n\u201cDaryl Morey was right,\u201d he added, definitively. \u201cWhenever you see something going on wrong anywhere in the world, you should have the right to say that\u2019s not right, and that\u2019s what he did.\u201d\n\nAcknowledging that you sometimes \u201chave to tiptoe around things\u201d when it comes to business, O\u2019Neal added, \u201cHere, we have the right to speak. And especially with social media, we\u2019re going to say whatever we want to say, when we want to say it.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Neal\u2019s comments stood in sharp contrast to those made by current NBA star LeBron James, who waded into the controversy last week, saying, \u201cYes, we do have freedom of speech. But at times, there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you\u2019re not thinking about others, when you only think about yourself.\u201d He went on to say that Morey was \u201cmisinformed\u201d on the situation in Hong Kong.\n\nLater, when Charles Barkley pushed back, saying that \u201ctrashing\u201d China could hurt both the NBA and Nike, O\u2019Neal held firm. \u201cChina can't tell us what to do and we can't tell them what to do, that's the bottom line,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe all have responsibility to our employer,\u201d Barkley fired back. \u201cI can\u2019t come on TV and say anything I want to politically. I can\u2019t do that.\u201d When O\u2019Neal said he doesn\u2019t \u201chave a problem\u201d with what Morey tweeted, Barkley added, \u201cDaryl Morey has done a good job, but his allegiance is to the Houston Rockets and the NBA and listen, he can quit if he\u2019s not happy with it.\u201d\n\nShortly after the segment aired, the official NBA on TNT Twitter account posted a tweet that read, \u201cInside the NBA discusses recent surrounding the NBA and China\u201d and included a video clip of the moment. But moments later, it appears to have been quickly deleted.\n\nMorey also quickly deleted his original tweet, which read simply, \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d But that did not stop China from suspending all ties with the Houston Rockets franchise and threatening the league\u2019s ability to broadcast games in that massive international market.", "description": "\u201cChina can't tell us what to do and we can't tell them what to do, that's the bottom line,\u201d the former NBA star said on opening night.", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1439,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571783555/Shaq_hi6kwf", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
