attacks and fires at oil refineries in Saudi Arabia as a smoke screen to cheat drivers out of savings at the petrol pumps.\n\nThe average price of unleaded fell by almost 1p a litre in September, marking a second consecutive month of declining costs for the nation's motorists.\n\nHowever, comparisons of wholesale and petrol pump prices made by the RAC showed there was room for retailers to pass on savings of an additional 4p per litre.\n\nSmoke screen: RAC Fuel Watch said the UK average price of unleaded was around 4p a litre higher than it should have been at the end of September\n\nDrones launched by Iran-backed militants sparked blazes at the world's largest oil processing facility and a major oilfield in Saudi Arabia on 14 September, igniting fears of supply issues and a spike in forecourt prices.\n\nDespite this, average unleaded prices fell by 0.87p a litre over the course of September, ending the month at 127.95p.\n\nHowever, RAC Fuel Watch said retailers had used the attacks in the Middle East to pull wool over the eyes of drivers.\n\nIt accused them of profiting by almost 4p on every litre of petrol by not reflecting lower wholesale costs at the pumps.\n\n'The saving in the wholesale price is not being passed on at the forecourt, with retailers potentially thinking drivers would just be grateful that prices have not shot up after the supply disruption,' the fuel analysts said.\n\nThe only part of the country that appears to be charging a fair price for fuel is Northern Ireland, where the average price of a litre of unleaded is 2p a litre cheaper than the rest of the UK.\n\nDiesel, which rose 0.35p to 132.07p, is also more than 2p a litre less in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe RAC said the UK forecourt price of diesel is also nearly 3p a litre too high.\n\nRAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: 'If they [retailers] can afford to charge less there, they can afford to elsewhere: this can only mean that drivers in the rest of the UK are being taken advantage of.\n\n'We would very much like to hear retailers' justification for this price differential.\n\n'Northern Ireland is more often a cheaper place for petrol and diesel due to greater competition among retailers, but in the last two months we've seen this gap widen which can only mean drivers in the rest of the UK are losing out.'\n\nAt an average price of 127.95p a litre, UK petrol drivers are paying \u00a370.37 (48p less than August) to fill up a 55-litre family car.\n\nIn Northern Ireland the cost is \u00a31.15 cheaper at \u00a369.22.\n\nA tank of diesel is an average of \u00a372.64 (up 19p on August) across the UK but \u00a371.34 in Northern Ireland \u2013 \u00a31.3 less.\n\nDrones launched by Iran-backed militants sparked blazes at the world's largest oil processing facility and a major oilfield in Saudi Arabia on 14 September, igniting fears of supply issues and a spike in forecourt prices\n\nMotorists looking to save the pennies should ultimately visit the big four supermarkets for fuel, all of which were around 4p a litre cheaper than the UK average.\n\nAccording to records, Asda, Morrisons, Sainsbury's and Tesco already provide almost half (45 per cent) of all fuel pumped into Britain's vehicles.\n\nWilliams added: ' If supermarket fuel is priced much lower than the UK average as it is now, this usually indicates independent retailers aren't passing on enough of the savings in the wholesale price.\n\n'This doesn't mean there isn't scope for the supermarkets to do more by lowering their prices more, it means that independent retailers simply are choosing not compete as much or simply aren't able to for financial reasons.'\n\nHe went on to say that the impact of the attacks in the Middle East is unlikely to be as substantial as many had feared after Saudi's state-owned oil company released extra crude reserves to retain supplies.\n\nFears of a global economic slowdown also helped to reduce the price of oil.\n\n'If this continues, it should translate into lower pump prices for drivers in the UK,' Williams said.\n\nThe fires at Abqaiq in Buqayq, which contains the world's largest oil processing plant, and Khurais, the country's second largest oilfield, have now brought under control shortly after the drone attacks.\n\nTensions are running high in the region after attacks in June and July on oil tankers in Gulf waters that Riyadh and Washington blamed on Iran.", "description": "Comparisons of wholesale and petrol pump prices made by the RAC showed there was room for retailers to pass on
