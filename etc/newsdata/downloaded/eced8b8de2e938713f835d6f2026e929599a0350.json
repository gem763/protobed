You win 5-3 and I\u2019m miserable for a month. But that\u2019s the standard we\u2019ve set. We\u2019ve \u00adexpectations of \u00adourselves and don\u2019t expect to be doing laps of honour for qualifying.\u201d\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nIf England win in the Czech Republic, \u00adqualification is assured and if, as seems overwhelmingly likely, they finish top of Group A, they as good as guarantee themselves three home games to start Euro 2020 next summer.\n\nSouthgate said: \u201cThe fact we\u2019ve three matches at \u00adWembley in the group stage is hugely exciting, so to qualify for any major tournament is a big deal. Just \u00adbecause to this point we\u2019ve made it look comfortable, we should never take it for granted.\u201d\n\nBut outside the squad, England wins have been taken for granted, such has been their form in qualifying.\n\nThey put five past the Czechs in March and have scored 19 in four group \u00adfixtures.\n\nSouthgate\u2019s feared front three will this time consist of Raheem Sterling, Harry Kane and Jadon Sancho, with \u00adMarcus Rashford missing out. And Southgate believes there will soon be others pushing for a spot in his attack, including Arsenal teenager Bukayo Saka.\n\n(Image: Eddie Keogh for The FA/REX)\n\nHe said: \u201cWe\u2019ve Callum Hudson-Odoi coming through and others are \u00ademerging so quickly. You\u2019ve Bukayo at \u00adArsenal just dipping his toes in the first team as well. So, we\u2019ve really good \u00adplayers, we need more than three. The guys know Tammy Abraham is going to push and Callum \u00adWilson is going to push.\u201d\n\nRashford\u2019s club form and Sancho\u2019s stellar display against Kosovo means the United man will be on the bench in Prague.\n\nBut the club form of Chelsea midfielder Mason Mount, 20, means he will make his first start in an \u00adEngland jersey.\n\nAnd it will be a moment Southgate has envisaged for a long time.\n\nAsked what he thought of Mount over the past few days, Southgate said: \u201cExactly what I thought of him when I saw him at 16 playing for our under-16s. He\u2019s a \u00adquality player, an \u00adintelligent footballer, presses well, has a real eye for goal, good quality.\n\n(Image: Eddie Keogh for The FA/REX)\n\n\u201cSo, nothing I\u2019ve seen \u00adsurprises me at all. We\u2019ve had him marked as a player from the first time I saw him at St George\u2019s Park.\n\n\u201cChelsea would be the same on that, I think, but of course he\u2019s now been able to have the opportunity to play in the \u00adPremier League and display that against top teams.\u201d\n\nMount\u2019s inclusion will bring the average age of the England side down a notch \u2013 another reason to believe the future is increasingly bright.\n\nSouthgate agreed, saying: \u201cEnglish football, with these young players coming through, looks in a healthy state. There\u2019s lots of potential but it is only when the players deliver on big stages can we really say we\u2019re there.\u201d\n\nAnd that is why, if their Euro 2020 spot is confirmed \u00adon Friday, the champagne will stay on ice.", "description": "Gareth Southgate's side will qualify for Euro 2020 with victory in the Czech Republic on Friday evening", "authors": ["Andy Dunn", "Image", "Pa", "Eddie Keogh For The Fa Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20556046.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_England-Press-Conference-Sinobo-Stadium.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
