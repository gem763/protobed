They are being questioned.\"\n\nWithin hours of the attack early on Wednesday morning, police arrested two upper-caste men - Rameshwar Yadav and Hakim Yadav.\n\nRoshni and Avinash were cousins, but Roshni had been brought up by Avinash's parents and lived with them.\n\nAvinash's father, Manoj, says that as a daily wage labourer, he cannot afford to build a toilet at his house. He also says he has been unable to access a government subsidy as part of a flagship scheme to build toilets for the poor.\n\nImage caption Women who go out at night to defecate are often at risk\n\nThe Swachh Bharat Mission or Clean India programme seeks to end open defecation by increasing toilet infrastructure and improving sanitation across the country. When Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the program in 2014, he vowed to make India \"open defecation free\" by 2 October 2019.\n\nManoj's village - Bhavkhedi - has been declared \"open defecation free\", a tag given by the government to villages and cities have successfully ended open defecation.\n\nResearch has shown that while the construction of toilets has increased rapidly, lack of water, poor maintenance and slow change in behaviour have stood in the way of ending open defecation.\n\nBut many have praised Mr Modi for highlighting the issue and launching a major scheme to address it - the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation honoured him this week, describing the Swachh Bharat Mission as \"a model for other countries around the world that urgently need to improve access to sanitation for the world's poorest.\"", "description": "Police in India say the two men allegedly beat two Dalit children to death for defecating in the open.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/B227/production/_108970654_gettyimages-497844768.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
