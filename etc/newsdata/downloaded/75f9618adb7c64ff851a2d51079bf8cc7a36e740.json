In 2014, he headed al-Qaida in the Indian Subcontinent, or AQIS.\n\nThe National Directorate of Security announced Umar\u2019s death on Twitter. He was cited as a Pakistani citizen, though officials said that may be because he was found with Pakistani identification.\n\nAQIS claimed responsibility for a 2014 attack on the naval yard in Karachi, during which they tried to hijack a Pakistani frigate. The group also said it was behind multiple activist and journalist killings in Bangladesh, including a U.S. citizen and embassy employee.\n\nUmar studied at two madrassas well known for producing terrorist commanders, and is said to have met al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden at one point while he trained in Afghanistan.", "description": "Oct. 8 (UPI) \u2014 A joint attack by U.S. and Afghan forces has killed the leader of al-Qaida\u2019s southern Asia operations, Kabul\u2019s", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
