Huntington\u2019s disease is an illness caused by a faulty gene in your DNA (the biological \u2018instructions\u2019 you inherit which tell your cells what to do). On average, patients live for between 10 and 20 years after their diagnosis. The NHS says there is currently no way to stop it getting worse. The incurable condition, which strikes 8,500 adults in the UK and around 30,000 in the US, occurs as a result of a fault in the huntingtin gene. Huntington\u2019s can cause changes with movement, learning, thinking and emotions. Once symptoms begin, the disease gradually progresses, so living with it means having to adapt to change, taking one day at a time. Huntington\u2019s is not something you can catch; it is inherited. Every child conceived naturally to a parent who carries the Huntington\u2019s gene has a 50 per cent chance of inheriting it.\n\nFudan University academics conducted several tests to find compounds that could clear the mutant protein without affecting the normal one.\n\nDr Boxun Lu and team found four promising ones, which reduced levels of the faulty huntingtin and had no impact on the other in all of the trials.\n\nTests on human neurons showed fewer of them died when exposed to the molecules \u2013 dubbed 10O5, 8F20, AN1 and AN2.\n\nFlies bred to have Huntington's and given the treatment were better able to climb and survived longer, compared to their untreated counterparts.\n\nAnd mice with the rodent equivalent of the condition also saw a benefit \u2013 they performed better on tests of their motor function than mice not treated.\n\nExperts not involved in the research, including Dr Huda Zoghbi of Houston's Baylor College of Medicine, have welcomed the study.\n\nShe said future trials should look for any 'off-target effects', including whether the compounds inadvertently clear any other vital proteins.\n\n'Even effects that initially seem inconsequential might build up over the course of long-term therapy, becoming as problematic decades later as the original toxic protein,' she said.\n\nBut Dr Zoghbi, writing in a linked editorial, added the evidence was 'encouraging' and said the treatment produced 'functional improvements'.\n\nThe compounds bind to the mutant protein and a crucial component of the neuron's internal mechanism for clearing out invaders.\n\nProfessor John Hardy, a neuroscientist at University College London, said the study was 'interesting' but a long way from clinical trials.\n\nDr Edward Wild, of UCL's Huntington\u2019s centre, said: 'Unfortunately, so far, nothing that has worked in a mouse model has slowed the disease in patients.\n\n'So it is important to study these new drugs thoroughly to get the best possible idea of whether the approach is safe and effective enough to be taken forward to human trials.'\n\nProfessor Tara Spires-Jones, of the University of Edinburgh, said: 'This is an interesting and potentially important paper.'", "description": "Researchers at Fudan University in Shanghai, China, found four compounds that can clear the mutant protein behind the crippling condition, which kills vital brain cells.", "authors": ["Stephen Matthews Health Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/11/20371124-0-image-a-15_1572434343455.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
