Mark Milley, the new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who had stressed trilateral cooperation between Washington, Tokyo and Seoul.\n\nSchriver urged Korea to reconsider its decision not to renew the military intelligence-sharing pact with Japan.\n\nAlso in Tokyo last Saturday, David Stilwell, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, said, \"We do of course encourage the Korean side to return to this agreement because it benefits us, benefits you and it certainly benefits them as well.\"\n\nKorea has said that it is still possible for Seoul, Washington and Tokyo to continue sharing military intelligence based on a trilateral information-sharing agreement signed in 2014, but Stilwell warned this would not be as effective or quick.\n\nStilwell arrives in Seoul on Nov. 5, when he will likely make the same point directly.\n\nMeanwhile, the State Department last Saturday asked Seoul for a huge increase in its upkeep contribution for the U.S. Forces Korea, saying President Donald Trump has been clear that Seoul \"can and should contribute more of its fair share.\"\n\nThe intelligence-sharing pact with Japan expires on Nov. 23 and the deadline for the upkeep negotiations is the end of this year.\n\n", "description": "U.S. Pushes Korea over Intel-Sharing Pact, Upkeep Cost", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://image.chosun.com/facebook/newson.gif", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
