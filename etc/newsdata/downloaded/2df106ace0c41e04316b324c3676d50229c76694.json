But these fragrant fungi will cost you.\n\nIn 2014, the world\u2019s largest white truffle was flown to New York, accompanied by a security guard, and sold at auction for $US61,000. Discovered in Italy, this gigantic fungus weighed almost 2 kilos.\n\nSo what is it that makes them so expensive?\n\nThere are a lot of types of truffles. There at least 40 species, many of which aren\u2019t edible \u2013 and new species have been discovered as recently as 2018.\n\nYou\u2019ve probably seen luxury truffle products in supermarkets or fancy restaurants. But the unique truffle flavour you recognise might not be real truffle at all. Cheap truffle oil often hasn\u2019t been anywhere near a real truffle.\n\nMany cheaper truffle products use 2,4-dithiapentane, a synthesized compound containing one of the main aromatic compounds in foot odor \u2013 guaranteed to give it that that \u201cearthy\u201d taste.\n\nReal truffles are seasonal and pricey, with a short shelf life. They were originally sniffed out using truffle pigs, but these days dogs are much more common truffle-hunting companions. These fungi can be found across the world, but they all require a very specific climate to grow. While different varieties may have somewhat different requirements, one thing is certain: You can\u2019t have truffles without trees.\n\nEven when you have exactly the right conditions, truffles aren\u2019t guaranteed. And hunting them is a labour-intensive process. Once you know where to look, you have to sniff out and dig up each truffle by hand, and they can be tricky to find. It may take a while, but finding a good one can make it worth the work, a 80g truffle can be worth over $US100.\n\nTruffles also have a short season, often appearing for only a few months of the year. And even when you do get your hands on them, they have a very short shelf life. After just five days, the pungent truffle smell will have halved.\n\nYou can farm many truffle varieties, besides the rare Italian whites. Many people have been successful in setting up truffle orchards, but it\u2019s not easy. Trees need to be planted in the right soil conditions, inoculated with truffle fungus, and often irrigated constantly. It can take as long as six years before you get a good truffle harvest, and there\u2019s no guarantee that the fungi will grow at all.\n\nThese days, farming has taken over as our primary source of truffles \u2013 and today, 70% of the world\u2019s truffles are cultivated.\n\nThrough the loss of woodland and climate change, the number of wild truffles has decreased significantly. Since the 19th century, production in France has fallen from over 1,000 tonnes a season to just 30 tonnes. And climate change could mean that truffles will disappear altogether in the future.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
