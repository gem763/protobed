It is moving westwards and is projected to hit or skirt areas along the U.S. east coast, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said Monday. It\u2019s likely to remain a Category 4 hurricane as it approaches the continental U.S., but is still \u201cextremely dangerous,\u201d the NHC says.\n\nThe NHC has issued a hurricane watch for Florida\u2019s east coast from Deerfield Beach north to the Volusia and Brevard county line. Officials in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina have all declared states of emergency ahead of Dorian.\n\nThe eye of catastrophic Cat. 5 #HurricaneDorian lingered over #GrandBahamaIsland overnight and into this morning, as seen in this close-up GeoColor loop from #GOESEast.

McMaster also ordered schools and state government offices in eight countries to close starting Tuesday until further notice.\n\nThe South Carolina evacuation order covers approximately 830,000 people living in eight coastal countries. In Georgia, around 300,000 people living east of Interstate 95 have been told to evacuate. Authorities in Florida have also ordered mandatory evacuations in some vulnerable coastal areas. On Saturday, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis warned residents along the state\u2019s Atlantic coast that \u201cwe\u2019re not out of the woods yet.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a list of the counties, towns, cities and other communities under evacuation orders as Hurricane Dorian approaches the U.S. east coast.\n\nFlorida Hurricane Dorian Evacuations\n\nMartin County\n\nPalm Beach County\n\nBrevard County\n\nSt. Lucie County\n\nSt. Johns County\n\nThe following counties have issued voluntary evacuations: Flagler, Nassau, Osceola, Glades, Hendry, Okeechobee, and Highlands counties.\n\nALERT: #Dorian EVACUATION BEGINNING NOON TOMORROW, September 2, 2019: Colleton Zones A, B; Beaufort Zone A;\n\nJasper Zone A; Charleston Zones A, B, C; Dorchester Zone D; Berkeley Zones B, G; Horry Zone A Georgetown Zone A https://t.co/J3bs5wRCmq #sctweets #alert pic.twitter.com/cxni3lx0Us\n\n\u2014 SCEMD (@SCEMD) September 1, 2019\n\nGeorgia Hurricane Dorian Evacuations\n\nBryan\n\nCamden\n\nChatham\n\nGlynn\n\nLiberty\n\nMcIntosh Counties\n\nStarting noon tomorrow, individuals east of I-95 in Bryan, Camden, Chatham, Glynn, Liberty, and McIntosh Counties must evacuate due to Hurricane #Dorian. @GeorgiaEMA and @GADeptofTrans will start westerly contraflow on I-16 at 8 AM on Tuesday, Sept. 3.
