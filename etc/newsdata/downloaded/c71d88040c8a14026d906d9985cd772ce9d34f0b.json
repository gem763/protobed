Draghi will preside over the ECB\u2019s press conference at 8:30 a.m. Eastern, marking his last meeting as he is set to formally retire at Oct. 31.\n\nThe ECB\u2019s latest easing measures announced in September has split members of the central bank, leaving the incoming Christine Lagarde, the former International Monetary Fund chief, with the job of bridging this divide.\n\nSee: Mario Draghi saved the euro, but leaves ECB at a crossroads\n\nIn economic data, the Markit PMI surveys for the manufacturing and services sector in France in October came in above expectations, but the broader survey for the eurozone and Germany showed that industrial activity continued to contract. The prevailing weakness across the euro zone has underlined the global economic growth doldrums that have prevented global bond yields from rising.\n\nAs for the U.S., weekly jobless claims, durable goods orders for last month were due at 8:30 a.m. Eastern, followed by a flash reading of the Markit PMI surveys in October at 9:45 a.m. Then, new home sales data for September would be released at 10 a.m.\n\nIn money market news, late Wednesday the Federal Reserve increased the sizes of both its overnight and term repurchase agreement operations from Thursday to smooth out potential volatility in the funding markets at the end of the month.\n\nThe New York Fed will offer at least $120 billion of financing at its overnight repo operation as of Thursday, up from $75 billion, according to its website. It will offer at least $45 billion at its 14-day term actions on Oct. 24 and Oct. 29, which is $10 billion more than previously. The increased size of the term operations will cover the Oct. 10 offering that matures Thursday as there is about $42.6 billion rolling off.\n\nThe central bank has been injecting liquidity into the funding markets since Sept. 17, when the rate on overnight general collateral repo jumped to 10% from around 2%. The Fed has also begun buying Treasury bills to add reserves into the system. These efforts have mostly calmed repo rates.\n\nWhat are market participants\u2019 saying?\n\n\u201cImproved market optimism regarding Brexit and a temporary let up of US-China trade tensions is has so far failed to improve the outlook much, as economic data across the globe remain weak,\u201d wrote Bas van Geffen, an analyst at Rabobank.\n\n\u201cPresident Draghi\u2019s farewell may not be the party he was hoping for. The ECB\u2019s latest policy decision caused quite some division in the Council. Moreover, the ECB President is waving goodbye against an economic backdrop that is not as bright as he would have liked to see it as he leaves office,\u201d he said.", "description": "Treasury yields struggle for direction after the European Central Bank announced it would keep policy rates unchanged at Mario Draghi\u2019s last meeting.", "authors": ["Sunny Oh"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
