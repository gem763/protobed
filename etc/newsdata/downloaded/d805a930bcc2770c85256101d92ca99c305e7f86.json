The descent to junk status affects one of the largest corporate bond issuers in the U.S. outside the financial sector.\n\nInvestors have traded Ford\u2019s debt for roughly the past year at levels that implied the company was headed for junk. Hackett has struggled to win over Wall Street with an overhaul that includes cutting thousands of jobs, reviving an aging line of SUVs and ditching slow-selling sedans.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty precarious situation that they\u2019re in,\u201d Charlie Chesbrough, senior economist of Cox Automotive, said by phone. \u201cWhen a company gets a junk status rating, it will mean they have to pay a higher interest rate and it means a lot of institutional investors will have to think twice.\u201d\n\nFord\u2019s most actively-traded bonds, Ford Motor Credit Co.\u2019s 5.113% bonds due 2029, weakened relative to Treasuries Monday afternoon after Moody\u2019s issued its release. The extra yield, or spread, the notes pay widened 0.3 percentage point to 3.45 percentage points, according to Trace. The automaker\u2019s shares plunged as much as 4.2% to $9.14 in late trading.\n\n\u201cFord remains very confident in our plan and progress,\u201d the carmaker said in an emailed statement. \u201cOur underlying business is strong, our balance sheet is solid and we have plenty of liquidity to invest in our compelling strategy for the future.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time that Ford carried a high-yield rating: The company and its peer General Motors were downgraded to junk by S&P Global Ratings in 2005. Moody\u2019s and Fitch Ratings followed suit later that year. But unlike GM and Chrysler, Ford managed to avoid bankruptcy and government bailouts during the financial crisis.\n\nStill, losing investment-grade status forced Ford to finance itself by essentially putting everything in hock, from its inventory to the rights to its blue oval logo. Chairman Bill Ford described the predicament as \u201cenormously emotional,\u201d saying the founding family was \u201cpledging our heritage.\u201d\n\nWhen the company reclaimed its investment-grade ratings in 2012, Bill Ford said it was \u201cone of the best days I can remember.\u201d\n\nRatings Elsewhere\n\nS&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings have a BBB rating on Ford, which is two steps above junk. Both have a negative outlook. As long as the company has at least two ratings above junk, it\u2019s eligible to stay in the biggest investment-grade bond indexes, which means many bond investors won\u2019t be forced to sell all their holdings.\n\n\u201cWe think there\u2019s a high probability that if they were to downgrade Ford to BBB-, it would come along with a stable outlook,\u201d said Joel Levington, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. \u201cAnd if that happened, then you would still be an investment-grade issuer for bond index purposes.\u201d\n\nIn July, Ford issued an annual profit forecast that disappointed investors as the automaker struggles to compete in China\u2019s slumping car market. New versions of Ford\u2019s Explorer and Escape SUVs debut this year, and it\u2019s bringing back the Bronco off-roader in 2020.\n\nThe downgrade comes just three months after Hackett installed a new Chief Financial Officer, Tim Stone. The former finance executive for Amazon.com Inc. and Snap Inc. is the first CFO the automaker has hired from outside the company since the 1940s.\n\nLots of \u2018Ifs\u2019\n\nFord hasn\u2019t issued unsecured bonds from the parent company level since December 2016, but its finance unit, Ford Motor Credit, is a routine borrower in the investment-grade market, having just sold $2 billion of bonds last month. The downgrade affects both issuers, which have a combined $35 billion of debt listed in the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Corporate Bond Index. The company has a total of $157.2 billion of debt outstanding, which includes operating lease liabilities.\n\nThe cost of insuring Ford\u2019s bonds against default jumped in the derivatives market. Guaranteeing Ford Motor debt now costs 1.9% a year, up 0.22 percentage point from Friday\u2019s levels, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That\u2019s the biggest one-day jump since March.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Ford Motor Co. was dealt a blow by Moody\u2019s Investors Service, which cut the carmaker\u2019s credit rating to junk on doubts that a turnaround plan by Chief Executive Officer Jim Hackett will generate earnings and cash quickly enough.Moody\u2019s downgraded Ford to the highest junk rating, Ba1, saying", "authors": ["Molly Smith", "Keith Naughton"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/yHMalq6ptjvohdZzYORoNA--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/e21cced889dd4f3677e935e79dc5419f", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
