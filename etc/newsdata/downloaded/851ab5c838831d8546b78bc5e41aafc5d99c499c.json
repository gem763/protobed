Four years ago, she finally escaped from sex trafficking.\n\nOne of her traffickers, she says, branded her with a tattoo which read \u201cLove is Loyalty\u201d. It\u2019s what he did to most of the women who worked for him - either that or \u201cLove is Royalty\u201d.\n\n\u201cHe wants to put his name on you. Like a keepsake - like you\u2019re his possession. Everybody knows you\u2019re his bitch,\u201d she says.\n\nHollie, 36, was sold into sex slavery at 15 years old, after a childhood of deprivation and abuse.\n\n\u201cBy the time I was 17 or 18 I had been raped more times than I can count\u201d Hollie\n\nDespite this difficult start in life, Hollie says she initially excelled in school.\n\n\u201cIt was an escape from my reality. In first grade, there was a teacher with the same last name as me. I used to pretend she was my mother because I longed for a relationship with my [real] mother.\u201d\n\nUnable to cope, Hollie\u2019s mother gave her to her own parents to be looked after.\n\n\u201cI remember being called \u2018a hooker\u2019, \u2018a whore\u2019, \u2018a worthless piece of shit like my mother\u2019, before I even knew what any of these things meant.\u201d\n\nHollie says that from the age of 12 she was smoking marijuana every day at home, before quickly moving on to harder drugs.\n\n\u201cIt was my \u2018normal\u2019 - that was just what my life was like.\u201d\n\nShe says she was in and out of juvenile detention centres for misdemeanours like truancy and underage drinking, before finally running away from one at 15 to go back to live with her mother.\n\n\u201cIt was one of the worst decisions of my life because within two weeks of being there, we were using drugs together. Within a month we were prostituting together.\u201d\n\nHollie says that at a point at which she was vulnerable and tired of being exploited by her mother, she was targeted by a man who asked her to join his team of sex workers.\n\n\u201cIt looked glamorous - he had fancy jewellery, nice shoes, nice clothes, lots of money and women all around him. It looked like he took care of them and got drugs whenever they wanted it. So, I did it. I joined his team and I entered into hell.\u201d\n\nWhat followed, Hollie says, were years of violence, sexual abuse and death threats.\n\n\u201cBy the time I was 17 or 18 I had been raped more times than I can count. I\u2019d been kidnapped. I\u2019d been held hostage, stabbed and shot at.\u201d\n\nThe environment Hollie was working in was extremely violent, and rape is often used by gangs to exert control over their trafficking victims.\n\nSo for Hollie, the tattoos forced upon her to show her loyalty to the gang became more than just undesirable adornments. They became symbols of years of trauma.\n\nHollie\u2019s finger tattoo - before and after\n\nAfter her escape, she heard about a charity called Survivor\u2019s Ink - which covers branding tattoos of sex trafficking survivors for free.\n\nShe went along to choose a design to cover up the \u201cLove is Loyalty\u201d tattoo at the top of her back.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a flower blossoming into a butterfly, soaring into freedom. Because I feel free now. I have the choice to make decisions on my life and where I move next. I never had that before. Somebody was always controlling me like a puppet. And today, nobody controls me.\u201d\n\nHollie\u2019s new back tattoo", "description": "", "authors": ["Elaine Jung"], "top_image": "https://news.files.bbci.co.uk/include/extra/shorthand/assets/news/VSUj7yai4n/assets/dbNYj1iRn8/horzantal-still3f-1920x1080.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
