Just the whole experience.\n\n\u201cI had my people get in contact with the WWE so we could go to the training center and just mess around and see if I could even do this. I was there for a week, (and) I loved it. From then on, I\u2019ve just been in talks with the WWE. We\u2019ve had meetings here and there, and finally I\u2019m here.\u201d\n\nBefore he was able to officially put his name on the dotted line, Velasquez made a call to UFC president Dana White. Velasquez said the conversation was respectful, and White offered his blessing without hesitation.\n\n\u201cWe ended up talking on the phone,\u201d Velasquez said. \u201cHe just supported me 100 percent. It was just a good, respectful talk that we had. He thanked me for everything that I did. I thanked him and the company for everything that they did. He just gave me his full blessing. He said, \u2018This is awesome, what you\u2019re doing. Go ahead, you have my full consent to go ahead and do what you want to do.'\u201d\n\nSince signing with WWE, Velasquez has been in touch with Cormier. When asked if fans should expect to see him tag-team with Cormier in the future, Velasquez laughed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve talked here and there,\u201d Velasquez said. \u201cHe loves what I\u2019m doing. \u2026 But, yeah, we\u2019ve been keeping in touch. It\u2019s just kind of crazy this road that I\u2019ve gone into. It\u2019s been such a short amount of time, but I\u2019ve had a goal in mind of what I want to do in this sport\n\n\u201c\u2026 \u2018DC\u2019 loves it. He\u2019s a big fan. That wouldn\u2019t surprise me (to see us tag team).\u201d\n\nVelasquez said the official beginning of his wrestling career marks the end of his MMA run. A two-time UFC heavyweight champion, Velasquez has reached the highest peaks in MMA. He\u2019s also experienced the lows as numerous injuries through the years have kept him on the shelf.\n\nVelasquez\u2019s first fight in two-and-a-half years took place earlier this year at UFC on ESPN 1, and it ended with a 26-second TKO loss to Francis Ngannou. To boot, Velasquez suffered a knee injury.\n\nNow his newfound love for pro wresting will offer new challenges.\n\n\u201cAs of right now, the chapter is closed on my MMA career,\u201d Velasquez. \u201cI\u2019m focusing on the task at hand with the WWE. I love this sport. I\u2019ve rebirthed myself into reliving it and loving it again. I\u2019m all in on doing this. I\u2019m diving deep into doing this, and this is what I\u2019m doing for right now.\u201d", "description": "Cain Velasquez is officially a WWE superstar, which means \"as of right now, the chapter is closed on my MMA career.\" Brock Lesnar awaits.", "authors": ["Nolan King", "John Morgan", "Christian Stein", "Mike Bohn", "Matt Erickson", "Ben Fowlkes"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/cain-velasquez-wwe-video.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
