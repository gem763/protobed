As of 2018, it had just 72,971 members, although union sources insist membership has \u201cbottomed out\u201d and is starting to grow again.\n\nUnder national secretary Daniel Walton, the third-youngest in the union's history, the union is experimenting in innovative ways of recruiting members in both new and old industries.\n\nOrganisers are stepping into hairdressing salons and the union has entered into an alliance with the maritime union to organise the offshore oil and gas industry on the west coast, with apparent success.\n\nThe union is even returning to its old pastoral stomping grounds by organising the agriculture and horticulture sectors and has entered into alliances with Coles and other right-wing unions to combat supply chain exploitation.\n\nBut the gains are unlikely to achieve the efficiencies of scale now seen as necessary for organising blue-collar workers or be enough to counter gains made by the left.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe recent merger of the right-wing National Union of Workers with the dominant-left union United Voice, formally scheduled for November 11, looms large.\n\nIt is the biggest amalgamation in the last 20 years, not only creating the largest blue-collar union in the country but also shifting delegates to the left in Labor caucuses.\n\nAgainst this background, the AWU and other blue-collar unions are under pressure to scale up to compete.\n\nMerger talks are still in their preliminary stages and may not see results, with some sources arguing factional rivalries between the AWU and the left-wing AMWU make any merger \"a pipe dream\".\n\nThe AWU also does not have a good history with union mergers.\n\nIn 1974, its NSW branch merged with the conservative Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association, known as the \"shoppies union\".\n\nBut the marriage soon unravelled when branch secretary Charlie Oliver, in an extraordinary move, proposed an industrial threesome with the communist-controlled Building Workers Industrial Union.\n\nThe union's last major amalgamation was with the right-wing Federated Ironworkers Association in 1991 and it almost destroyed both unions.\n\nA merger with the AMWU would be \"a massive bridge across the traditional political divide\u201d.\n\nThe merger was part of a wave of amalgamations in the early 1990s urged on by then-ACTU secretary Bill Kelty to reduce hundreds of small unions into 20 super unions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn echoes of the present day, the merger was also a response to the formation of the blue-collar, left-wing behemoth, the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union, which had just joined with the mining and timber unions.\n\nAs then-AWU national secretary Ian Cambridge said, \u201cthere was a lot of political pressure exerted on a lot of people within the AWU to get the amalgamation up with [FIA]\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou had to get that up because we had to have something that would buttress the Right\u2019s position against the big left-wing union, the CFMEU, that had just been formed.\u201d\n\nBut personality clashes, conflicting union structures and allegations of financial improprietry saw the AWU engulfed in years of civil war with its own merger partner.\n\nLudwig, then heading the union's largest branch, AWU Queensland, clashed with FIA head Steve Harrison and succeeded in exempting his branch from the new structure's centralised financial controls.\n\nAccusations of financial misappropriation flew, legal action was launched and the union did not hold a national convention until 1999 as the opposing parties could not agree on when, where or how to hold it.\n\nAs AWU Victorian secretary Ben Davis told academic Nick Dyrenfurth in A New History of the AWU \u201cwe wrote the book on how not to amalgamate\u201d.\n\nThe Abbott government's Trade Union Royal Commission would revisit some of those financial misconduct claims two decades later, scrutinising a slush fund set up by then-AWU WA leader Bruce Wilson and incorporated as an association by Gillard, then a lawyer at Slater & Gordon and romantically involved with Wilson.\n\nUnknown to Gillard and the AWU, employer donations worth hundreds of thousands of dollars poured into the fund and were allegedly used to purchase a house for Mr Wilson in Melbourne.\n\nBut even though the AWU-FIA merger nearly saw the collapse of the AWU, Dyrenfurth argues it also proved to be \"the most enduring of the early-1990s union mergers\", comparing favourably to umbrella-like mega unions like the AMWU and the CFMEU.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was a sign of the AWU's resilience.\n\nWhen Shorten took the reins as national secretary in 2001 he managed to unite the warring parties and lead a recovery that saw membership grow for the first time in a decade.\n\nThe rebound continued under his successor Paul Howes and following Rudd's election in 2007.\n\nWhile Rudd had a frosty relationship with the AWU, new workplace laws allowed the union's membership to grow by almost 25,000 between 2008 and 2012.\n\nThose gains were wiped out in the following years, however, due to an unprecedented downturn in manufacturing that included the closure of aluminium operations across the country, timber mill shut-downs in Western Australia and the end of the car-making industry in 2017.\n\nWith the re-election of the Morrison government and the emergence of a new left blue-collar behemoth, addressing this decline has become more urgent.\n\nBut, unlike the FIA amalgamation, a merger with the AMWU would be, in the words of one former senior AWU official, \"a massive bridge across the traditional political divide\u201d.\n\nThe FIA, whose remnants are now fully dissolved into the AWU, operated as a Cold War-era opposition to the communists in the metal workers union, the AMWU's predecessor.\n\nIronically, as politics has moved on, it may now become part of that very union.\n\nThe question is how big the need for change is.\n\n\"Change is difficult in big democratic organisations and people have to be convinced the imperative for change is there,\" one former senior official said.\n\n\"But it certainly needs to happen, things cannot stay as they are.\"", "description": "Declining blue-collar membership mean Australia's oldest union must make large-scale changes to survive.", "authors": [], "top_image":
