All I know is John Wayne don\u2019t run away.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt was a difficult time to sell a story about two renegade robbers. By the late 1960s, the western was considered to be a genre in terminal decline. Novelist and playwright Goldman had been researching the true story of the outlaws Harry Longabaugh (The Sundance Kid) and Robert LeRoy Parker (Butch Cassidy) since 1959. Goldman had become so enamoured with the story of Sundance that he even used a variation of the gunslinger\u2019s name \u2013 Harry Longbaugh \u2013 as a pseudonym for a novel.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIn 1968, while working as a lecturer in creative writing at Princeton University, he finally completed his draft of the screenplay The Sundance Kid and Butch Cassidy. The ace up his sleeve was the wily literary agent Evarts Ziegler \u2013 whose clients included Joan Didion, Mario Puzo and John Cheever \u2013 who sang Goldman\u2019s praises to Richard Zanuck, son of 20th Century Fox co-founder Darryl F Zanuck. The young Zanuck was authorised to spend $200,000 on a new script. He ended up paying $400,000 for the Sundance story, a record sum for a screenplay, equivalent to \u00a32.8m today. \u201cIt was a brilliant piece of agenting,\u201d said Goldman, particularly as there was no star attached to the project.\n\nBy the time Fox hired George Roy Hill as the director, Goldman\u2019s script had been revised slightly and re-titled as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, on the basis that Butch was being played by Paul Newman, a four-time Oscar nominee whose recent success in Cool Hand Luke confirmed his status as one of Hollywood\u2019s leading men.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Films to watch before you die 1/42 Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) With this update and upgrade of the 1930s serial adventure, Steven Spielberg turns what could have been pastiche into a practically perfect film. Harrison Ford\u2019s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe\u2019s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams's finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO Rex 2/42 The Wings of the Dove (1997) Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn\u2019t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role; the masquerade of her and Linus Roache's motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart out at the end. PS Miramax Films 3/42 Spirited Away (2001) Japanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki's films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there's meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki's fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it\u2019s unparalleled. HO Toho 4/42 Un Chien Andalou (1928) Luis Bu\u00f1uel and Salvador Dal\u00ed changed the face of cinema with this 16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage, which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PS 5/42 Avengers (2012) Yes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HO Marvel Studios 6/42 The Shining (1980) Stanley Kubrick\u2019s creep-show classic is remembered for the indelible images of that violent finale chase, but its reputation and influence stem from the slow-winding tension that precedes it. Jack Nicholson is the struggling writer whose sanity frays over a winter season at an isolated and haunted hotel; Shelley Duvall plays his increasingly desperate wife. Touching on questions of domestic violence as well as delivering a ghost story for the ages, this will get under your skin and stay there. HO Warner Bros/Hawk Films/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock 7/42 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978) One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman\u2019s beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland\u2019s lugubrious health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PS 8/42 The Royal Tenenbaums (2001) Wes Anderson's meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making one last attempt at redemption. With a who\u2019s who of Hollywood in support, it\u2019s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as family life itself. HO Buena Vista Pictures 9/42 Lawrence of Arabia (1962) David Lean\u2019s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles \u2013 notably the attack on Aqaba \u2013 with psychological insight into the toll that the war took on Lawrence\u2019s mind. The white-led casting of Arab characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HO Rex 10/42 Bicycle Thieves (1948) A devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica\u2019s neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job \u2013 but it requires a bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in compassion and empathy. HO Rex Features 11/42 Farewell My Concubine (1993) Spanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance both between Zhang Fengyi\u2019s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng\u2019s Dieyi, and between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HO Miramax Films 12/42 Brazil (1985) Originally titled 1984\u00bd, Terry Gilliam\u2019s crazily ambitious riff on Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point: one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce\u2019s befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the best sci-fi production design ever. PS 20th Century Fox 13/42 Tokyo Story (1953) Pauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the \u201ckiss kiss bang bang\u201d of action and romance, but Yasujir\u014d Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It\u2019s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it\u2019s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HO Rex Features 14/42 Double Indemnity (1944) If we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That\u2019s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray\u2019s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck\u2019s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck\u2019s ruthless determination warping MacMurray\u2019s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO Rex Features 15/42 Days of Heaven (1978) Terrence Malick\u2019s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros\u2019s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere\u2019s younger sister. PS Paramount Pictures 16/42 Citizen Kane (1941) The problem with calling something \u201cthe greatest film ever made\u201d is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles\u2019s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What\u2019s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HO 17/42 Les Enfants du Paradis (1945) Nirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carn\u00e9's luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema's Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It\u2019s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you\u2019ll ever see. PS Rex Features 18/42 Rear Window (1954) Whether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it\u2019s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart\u2019s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero \u2013 as in Vertigo \u2013 increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won\u2019t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly\u2019s plucky girlfriend in the lion\u2019s mouth. HO 19/42 It Happened One Night (1934) Claudette Colbert's eloping heiress and Clark Gable's hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra's evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that's one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert's skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable's smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PS 20/42 Hoop Dreams (1994) The trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James\u2019s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy\u2019s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PS Kartemquin Films 21/42 The Apartment (1960) This blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it\u2019s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon\u2019s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless; he carries entire scenes without a word. HO Rex 22/42 Paris, Texas (1984) The title of Wim Wenders\u2019s Palme d\u2019Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take t\u00eate-a-t\u00eate, it's a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PS 23/42 Synedoche, New York (2008) It\u2019s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork \u2013 literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit \u2013 Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life \u2013 lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It\u2019s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PS Sony Pictures Classics 24/42 Before Midnight (2013) C\u00e9line (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater\u2019s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives \u2013 self-inflicted by now \u2013 only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PS 25/42 Le M\u00e9pris (1963) Other Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PS 26/42 Casablanca (1942) Some films strain under the weight of greatness; Casablanca\u2019s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart\u2019s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism; opposite him Ingrid Bergman\u2019s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin' at you, kid. HO 27/42 Meet Me in St Louis (1944) On the surface, Vincente Minnelli's Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It's a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary; and the subtext of \u201cHave Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\u201d is anything but merry. PS Rex 28/42 A Trip to the Moon (1902) Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they\u2019re still beautifully designed and executed. HO Rex Features 29/42 Out of the Past (1947) Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can\u2019t escape old associates \u2013 especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who\u2019s perhaps noir\u2019s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it\u2019s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PS 30/42 His Girl Friday (1940) A screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks's remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there's never a moment to question what\u2019s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HO 31/42 The Conversation (1974) Who's eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PS Paramount Pictures 32/42 Blow Out (1981) John Travolta's Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman's \u00e9lan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It\u2019s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that\u2019s played for keeps. PS Filmways Pictures 33/42 City of God (2002) There\u2019s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio\u2019s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love; on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director K\u00e1tia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO 34/42 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986) The diverging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there's already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen\u2019s modes and tones. PS Rex 35/42 Raising Arizona (1987) The Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PS 20th Century Fox 36/42 Cach\u00e9 (2005) This looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke\u2019s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it\u2019s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HO Rex 37/42 The Bourne Supremacy (2004) Straight up the best Bourne movie \u2013 an experience Ultimatum can\u2019t help but want to repeat, more falteringly \u2013 because of Paul Greengrass\u2019s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon\u2019s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that\u2019s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it\u2019s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PS 38/42 The General (1926) Orson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton\u2019s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton\u2019s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton\u2019s beautifully composed routines. You\u2019ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HO Rex 39/42 The Babadook (2014) The Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can\u2019t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can\u2019t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent\u2019s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PS 40/42 When Harry Met Sally (1989) Is it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it's a paean of sorts to Woody Allen's early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (\"I'll have what she's having\"). It's still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan's careers. Columbia Pictures 41/42 Inside Out (2015) Toy Story revolutionised animation; Up and Wall-E vie for the best opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter\u2019s head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure through the mind itself. What\u2019s dazzling here is that two completely separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on a quest; adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think and feel. It\u2019s wonderful. Getty 42/42 True Romance (1993) Disinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called The Open Road \u2013 the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born Killers \u2013 Tony Scott's True Romance is a pulpy, hyperviolent twist on a damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score that is based on Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on the lam, chased by Christopher Walken's suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash \u2013 and totally brilliant. Rex 1/42 Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) With this update and upgrade of the 1930s serial adventure, Steven Spielberg turns what could have been pastiche into a practically perfect film. Harrison Ford\u2019s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe\u2019s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams's finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO Rex 2/42 The Wings of the Dove (1997) Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn\u2019t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role; the masquerade of her and Linus Roache's motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts.

PS Miramax Films 3/42 Spirited Away (2001) Japanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki's films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually).

But it\u2019s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HO Rex Features 14/42 Double Indemnity (1944) If we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That\u2019s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray\u2019s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck\u2019s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck\u2019s ruthless determination warping MacMurray\u2019s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO Rex Features 15/42 Days of Heaven (1978) Terrence Malick\u2019s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros\u2019s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere\u2019s younger sister. PS Paramount Pictures 16/42 Citizen Kane (1941) The problem with calling something \u201cthe greatest film ever made\u201d is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles\u2019s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What\u2019s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HO 17/42 Les Enfants du Paradis (1945) Nirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carn\u00e9's luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema's Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It\u2019s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you\u2019ll ever see. PS Rex Features 18/42 Rear Window (1954) Whether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it\u2019s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart\u2019s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero \u2013 as in Vertigo \u2013 increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won\u2019t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly\u2019s plucky girlfriend in the lion\u2019s mouth. HO 19/42 It Happened One Night (1934) Claudette Colbert's eloping heiress and Clark Gable's hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra's evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that's one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert's skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable's smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PS 20/42 Hoop Dreams (1994) The trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James\u2019s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy\u2019s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PS Kartemquin Films 21/42 The Apartment (1960) This blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it\u2019s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon\u2019s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless; he carries entire scenes without a word. HO Rex 22/42 Paris, Texas (1984) The title of Wim Wenders\u2019s Palme d\u2019Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take t\u00eate-a-t\u00eate, it's a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PS 23/42 Synedoche, New York (2008) It\u2019s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork \u2013 literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit \u2013 Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life \u2013 lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It\u2019s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PS Sony Pictures Classics 24/42 Before Midnight (2013) C\u00e9line (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater\u2019s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives \u2013 self-inflicted by now \u2013 only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PS 25/42 Le M\u00e9pris (1963) Other Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PS 26/42 Casablanca (1942) Some films strain under the weight of greatness; Casablanca\u2019s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart\u2019s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism; opposite him Ingrid Bergman\u2019s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin' at you, kid. HO 27/42 Meet Me in St Louis (1944) On the surface, Vincente Minnelli's Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It's a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary; and the subtext of \u201cHave Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\u201d is anything but merry. PS Rex 28/42 A Trip to the Moon (1902) Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they\u2019re still beautifully designed and executed. HO Rex Features 29/42 Out of the Past (1947) Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can\u2019t escape old associates \u2013 especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who\u2019s perhaps noir\u2019s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it\u2019s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PS 30/42 His Girl Friday (1940) A screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks's remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there's never a moment to question what\u2019s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HO 31/42 The Conversation (1974) Who's eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PS Paramount Pictures 32/42 Blow Out (1981) John Travolta's Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman's \u00e9lan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It\u2019s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that\u2019s played for keeps. PS Filmways Pictures 33/42 City of God (2002) There\u2019s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio\u2019s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love; on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director K\u00e1tia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO 34/42 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986) The diverging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there's already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen\u2019s modes and tones. PS Rex 35/42 Raising Arizona (1987) The Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PS 20th Century Fox 36/42 Cach\u00e9 (2005) This looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke\u2019s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it\u2019s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HO Rex 37/42 The Bourne Supremacy (2004) Straight up the best Bourne movie \u2013 an experience Ultimatum can\u2019t help but want to repeat, more falteringly \u2013 because of Paul Greengrass\u2019s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon\u2019s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that\u2019s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it\u2019s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PS 38/42 The General (1926) Orson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton\u2019s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton\u2019s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton\u2019s beautifully composed routines. You\u2019ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HO Rex 39/42 The Babadook (2014) The Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can\u2019t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can\u2019t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent\u2019s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PS 40/42 When Harry Met Sally (1989) Is it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it's a paean of sorts to Woody Allen's early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (\"I'll have what she's having\"). It's still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan's careers. Columbia Pictures 41/42 Inside Out (2015) Toy Story revolutionised animation; Up and Wall-E vie for the best opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter\u2019s head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure through the mind itself. What\u2019s dazzling here is that two completely separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on a quest; adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think and feel. It\u2019s wonderful. Getty 42/42 True Romance (1993) Disinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called The Open Road \u2013 the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born Killers \u2013 Tony Scott's True Romance is a pulpy, hyperviolent twist on a damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score that is based on Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on the lam, chased by Christopher Walken's suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash \u2013 and totally brilliant. Rex\n\nNewman was Goldman\u2019s choice from the moment the film was bought, but the casting for Sundance was trickier. Fox initially wanted Jack Lemmon, who had appeared in a 1958 western called Cowboy along with Glenn Ford. Lemmon was not keen on spending a lot of time riding horses again and told them he was not interested. The studio then turned their attention to Steve McQueen and although he liked the script, he dropped out, reportedly in a disagreement over who got top billing.\n\nNewman\u2019s wife Joanne Woodward suggested 32-year-old Redford, who had appeared in a few films but was better known as a stage actor. Zanuck, who was a production manager on the film, thought Redford was too lightweight for the role and changed his mind only after seeing raw footage of Newman and Redford together and realising that they had a true chemistry on screen. \u201cI wasn\u2019t that well known at the time and although my agency thought I would be right for the part, 20th Century didn\u2019t want me,\u201d Redford told a television interviewer more than 40 years later. \u201cThey wanted Steve McQueen. But George, the director, went to the mat for me. They kept forcing him to look at other candidates but eventually they ran out of other actors.\u201d\n\nIt seems almost ridiculous in hindsight to imagine that anyone needed to be convinced that Redford was perfect to play Sundance, the moustachioed loner with the piercing, soulful eyes. Redford was catapulted to stardom by the role, and Newman and Redford, who made only two films together \u2013 they paired up in 1973\u2019s The Sting, but a proposed collaboration on A Walk in the Woods 35 years later did not happen \u2013 became one of Hollywood\u2019s greatest double acts.\n\nThe pair were helped by Goldman\u2019s script, which gave them terrific lines as witty anti-heroes. \u201cAll I ever wanted to be was a storyteller,\u201d said Goldman, who was born in 1931 near Chicago. His own past had been tough and tragic. His mother Marion told him when he was a young boy that her deafness was the result of complications giving birth to him. When Goldman was 15, his alcoholic businessman father Maurice killed himself. His misplaced guilt over his father\u2019s death, blaming himself for not having been around to save him, blighted his youth.\n\nGoldman was by nature an outsider. He decided that with Butch and Sundance he wanted to flout the normal conventions of the western. Parker and Longabaugh were the leaders of the Wild Bunch \u2013 also known as the Hole in the Wall Gang \u2013 who held up banks and robbed trains in the Rocky Mountains in the 1890s. They were usually presented as grim, ruthless criminals but Goldman audaciously reinvented them for a Sixties audience, turning Butch and Sundance into lovable rogues. Their dialogue was charmingly insouciant, summed up by the following exchange:\n\nButch: \u201cYou know, when I was a kid, I always thought I was gonna grow up to be a hero.\u201d\n\nSundance: \u201cWell, it\u2019s too late now.\u201d\n\nButch: \u201cWhat\u2019d you say something like that for? You didn\u2019t have to say something like that.\u201d\n\nGoldman acknowledged that Hill brought a dimension and depth to his script that helped create a memorable piece of cinema. It was Hill\u2019s idea, for example, to have a bohemian love escapade scene, in which Sundance\u2019s girlfriend, Etta Place, enjoyed a flirtatious, clowning bicycle ride with Butch. Setting the scene to BJ Thomas singing Burt Bacharach\u2019s romantic pop song \u201cRaindrops Keep Fallin\u2019 on My Head\u201d only added to the charm. Place, who was played by Katherine Ross, was a schoolteacher in the film, although Hill said she had apparently been a prostitute in real life.\n\nNewman did the bike stunts himself \u2013 including an even more dangerous one in which he had to ride between two mules. He was luckier than one of the professional stuntmen on the movie, who fractured his pelvis after crashing from a rooftop \u2013 after being shot \u2013 and landed on wooden boxes that were too flimsy to cushion his fall. Hill was full of praise for Newman and Redford, who would come in on their days off to rehearse lines and practise action sequences. The film\u2019s comedy is sure-footed, never too broad. During rehearsals, there was lots of discussion about whether the film was a comedy or a serious western. \u201cYou don\u2019t play funny or sad, you play real,\u201d Hill told his leading pair.\n\nThe behind-the-scenes tales from the production, which began on 16 September 1968, were revealing. The film has lots of explosions and the \u201cdynamite man\u201d, as he was known on set, had to be extremely accurate to make sure the actors and the members of the 165-strong crew were not injured. Spare a thought, though, for the bull called Bill, who was part of the bicycle scene. Bill was an extremely placid animal and the only way they could get him to charge at Newman\u2019s stunt double was to spray the bull\u2019s large balls with hot lotion.\n\nThe movie, much of which was filmed in Utah\u2019s Zion National Park, was beautifully shot and another consequence of painstaking attention to detail. Hill watched 50 westerns before finally choosing cinematographer Conrad Hall, who had earned an Oscar nomination for his work on the Burt Lancaster/Lee Marvin western The Professionals. \u201cConnie gave me that wonderful washed-out desaturated look, over-exposed with dust and smoke,\u201d Hill said.\n\nThe film opens in sepia with newsreel footage that gives away the fate of the main characters \u2013 \u201cthe Hole in the Wall Gang, led by Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, are all dead now\u201d reads the caption \u2013 and closes with a sepia photograph, freeze-framing their mythic deaths in a shootout with the Bolivian army in November 1908, after the pair were cornered in the dusty village of San Vicente.\n\nIt seems unbelievable, but what refuses to die is the legend that they survived the shootout with hundreds of Bolivian soldiers and actually lived on in America. \u201cThere are varying stories of their deaths in Bolivia and in fact some people in Utah, including Butch\u2019s sister, say that Butch escaped and made it back to Utah and lived there until a few years ago under an assumed name,\u201d said Hill in 1969. \u201cOn the other hand, most historians agree about that a whole company of Bolivian cavalry were brought in at the end to get them and it seems unlikely that either one could have survived that. In fact, I was concerned that bringing in so many men would be dramatically unbelievable, even though it was historically accurate.\u201d\n\nButch Cassidy\u2019s sister, Lula Parker Betenson, met Newman and Redford and visited the set on several occasions to watch filming. In one classic scene she witnessed, Newman defied a mutinous gang member by kicking him unexpectedly in the balls. \u201cIs this what the movie\u2019s going to be like?\u201d she asked Newman afterwards. She told Newman he had captured her brother perfectly. The studio was keen to get her \u201conside\u201d for promotional purposes. Redford was asked to help persuade her to attend a premiere in New Haven. \u201cThey told me to talk to her get her to say nice things about the film,\u201d he admitted. Redford and Lula became friends and stayed in touch until her death in 1980.\n\nAccording to Bill Betenson, Butch Cassidy\u2019s biographer and great-grandnephew, the family alone knew where Cassidy was buried after his alleged \u201creal death\u201d in 1937. \u201cMy great-grandmother, Butch\u2019s little sister Lula, was very clear. She said that where he was buried, and under what name, was a family secret; that he was chased all his life and now he had a chance to finally rest in peace \u2013 and that\u2019s the way it must be,\u201d he said in 2011.\n\nBetenson said there were 20 well-documented sightings of Cassidy after his supposed death at 42 and claimed that when he was 59, the outlaw survivor met Lula, returning in a shiny new Ford motor car to visit his ailing father in 1925. After the shootout with the Bolivian authorities, the bodies of Butch and Sundance were identified by Carlos Pero, the courier for the Aramayo, Francke and Cia mining company. Pero had been robbed by the pair, although they had been wearing masks at the time. They were supposedly buried in an unmarked grave in a San Vicente cemetery. No photographs of the bodies were taken to provide proof.\n\nIn her 1975 memoir Butch Cassidy, My Brother, Lula Betenson claimed that a friend of the outlaw had planted the story of the death in Bolivia so that he would no longer be pursued by the Pinkertons. Butch came back and lived under an alias she said she would never disclose. She later told Welsh author Bruce Chatwin that her brother had died of pneumonia in Washington State in 1937.\n\nIn 1977, Montana author Larry Pointer caused a stir when he wrote a book claiming to prove that Cassidy had lived on as William T Phillips, who worked as a machinist in Spokane until his death in 1937, having had plastic surgery to help evade detection. To add to the confusion, this was a separate person from the man Betenson claimed had lived on until 1937.\n\nIn 2012, however, Pointer self-published a book called Butch Cassidy\u2019s Story: Bandit Invincible in which he admitted he had got it wrong in 1977. He said he had since found compelling evidence that William T Phillips was actually a man called William T Wilcox, who had robbed banks with Cassidy in the late 19th century and knew enough inside information about the outlaw from that time to have been able to present himself as the real Cassidy.\n\nLawyer Anne Meadows and her husband Dan Buck also tried to solve the mystery of what really happened to the bandits in their book Digging up Butch and Sundance (1991). They interviewed other members of Cassidy\u2019s family, who said that Lula Betenson\u2019s book was \u201ca pack of lies\u201d. They hired Clyde Snow, the forensic anthropologist who identified the remains of Nazi war criminal Josef Mengele, to solve the mystery of Butch and Sundance\u2019s final resting place. Snow received permission from Bolivian authorities to exhume two bodies. He was guided to their supposed grave by an elderly Bolivian villager who said his father had witnessed the shootout. After a comparison of DNA to the relatives of Cassidy and Longabaugh, Snow found there was no match. Instead, one of the skeletons unearthed was thought to be that of a German miner named Gustav Zimmer.\n\nIt is possible, of course, that the bodies of the famous desperados remain buried elsewhere in the San Vicente cemetery or scattered somewhere else in the town. Without conclusive proof of what happened to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, their fate remains a mystery that inspires speculation. A book in 2016 even claimed that Cassidy had lived on as a rancher in Utah until 1936 and had been buried in Duchesne City Cemetery. San Vicente is keen not to lose its claim to fame and has held celebrations re-enacting the shootout to bring in tourists.\n\nPerhaps it is the mystery and uncertainty over what really happened that makes the ending of the film so perfect, the pair frozen in time having gone out all guns blazing at the hands of faceless soldiers. Hill described the performance of Newman and Redford in the final scene as \u201cone of the great acting achievements\u201d in cinema history.\n\nWhen the film was released on 24 October 1969, Hill was initially nervous about the reaction to work he had so carefully crafted. \u201cI have spent exactly a year and three months on this film, and at this point, I don\u2019t know yet how it\u2019s going to be received,\u201d Hill said in the 1969 documentary The Making of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good film, I think the guys are great in it, and I think the relationships work,\u201d added Hill. \u201cIt was a hell of a lot of hard work doing it, and actually even more fun, and if audiences don\u2019t dig it, I think I\u2019ll go out of my f***ing mind.\u201d\n\nThe first signs were worrying. New Yorker critic Pauline Kael said she felt \u201cdepressed\u201d and \u201crather offended\u201d after viewing such a \u201cfacetious, empty western\u201d. Time magazine was equally scathing, dismissing an \u201cabsurd and anachronistic\u201d movie. The public loved the film, however. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid became the top-grossing movie of 1969, taking in more than $102m. The movie won four Academy Awards: best writing, best cinematography, best original score and best original song for \u201cRaindrops Keep Fallin\u2019 on My Head\u201d. It was also nominated for best picture, best director and best sound. Bacharach won a Grammy for the score and the movie won a record nine Bafta awards in the UK.\n\nGoldman went on to win another Oscar for his script for All the President\u2019s Men (1976) and his memoir Adventures in the Screen Trade: A Personal View of Hollywood and Screenwriting was notable for its caustic assessment of the movie business, an industry where \u201cnobody knows anything\u201d. Although he continued to write popular screenplays, including for the Stephen King thriller Misery, he insisted that screenplay writing was not an art form. \u201cIf you only write screenplays, it is ultimately denigrating to the soul,\u201d he told Publishers Weekly four years before his death in 2018. \u201cYou may get lucky and get rich, but you sure won\u2019t get happy.\u201d\n\nNewman and Redford reunited with Hill when he directed the Oscar-winning 1973 movie The Sting. They retained a deep affection for the year they spent pretending to be outlaw pals. \u201cThe film was the start of a lifelong friendship and I had the most fun of any film I ever made,\u201d said Redford. In 1981, Redford founded a non-profit organisation dedicated to the development of independent filmmakers. There was only one possible name. The Sundance Institute was born and since 1985 the associated Sundance Film Festival has helped rustle up critical recognition and acclaim for thousands of movies.", "description": "The multiple Oscar-winning Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid was a groundbreaking revisionist western, with Paul Newman and Robert Redford giving a timeless portrayal of a pair of law-breaking adventurers in one of Hollywood\u2019s greatest examples of the \u201cbuddy film\u201d.", "authors": ["Martin Chilton"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/02/21/shutterstock-editorial-1543554a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
