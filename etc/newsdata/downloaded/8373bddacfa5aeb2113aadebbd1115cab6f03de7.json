Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing's (HKEX) <0388.HK> offer requires the LSE to ditch the Refinitiv purchase.\n\nBut a person close to the Hong Kong exchange said a rejection of an initial approach was common in takeovers and HKEX was already considering its next step. Informal discussions between HKEX and LSE shareholders have begun, the person added.\n\nThe Financial Times reported on Thursday that HKEX was open to considering a higher element of cash in its offer, citing a person familiar with the matter.\n\nAn LSE spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nThe proposed deal, announced on Wednesday, aims to create an exchange powerhouse spanning Asia, Europe and the United States which would be better able to compete with U.S. rivals such as Intercontinental Exchange Inc <ICE.N> and CME Group Inc <CME.O>.\n\nHowever shares in HKEX fell more than 3% on Thursday as investors raised concerns about the political and regulatory risks involved in its move to take over one of Britain's marquee financial institutions.\n\nThe UK government said authorities would examine the proposed deal closely as the LSE was a \"critically important part\" of the British financial system.\n\nHowever a takeover could face regulatory scrutiny beyond British shores; the London bourse also owns the Milan exchange and has a significant American presence through its FTSE Russell index subsidiary and LCH, its derivatives clearing house which dominates the U.S. dollar swap market.\n\nThis means a deal could also draw the attention of watchdogs in Italy and the United States, which is locked in a trade war with China.\n\nHKEX declined to comment.\n\nThe Hong Kong exchange's indicative offer for the LSE also received a cool reception in London, where LSE shares finished up 5.9% on Wednesday, far short of the proposed takeover's implied premium.\n\nAnother major sticking point is the requirement for the LSE to abandon its acquisition of financial information provider Refinitiv from U.S. private equity firm Blackstone Group Inc <BX.N> and Thomson Reuters Corp <TRI.TO>, the parent of Reuters News.\n\nThat deal, which went public in late July, caused LSE's shares to leap 15% on hopes Refinitiv's business would boost its long-term profitability. LSE said in a statement on Wednesday that it remained committed to the Refinitiv deal.\n\nHKEX has 28 days to make a firm bid for the LSE, whose shares closed up nearly 1% at 7,274 pence on Thursday or walk away for six months.\n\nThe source close to the LSE said that while the Hong Kong deal offered a gateway into China's economy, the LSE had already established its own entry point with a recently launched stock market link with Shanghai.\n\n\n\n\n\nPROTESTS AND POLITICAL RISK\n\nAnalysts said a perception that Beijing is exerting growing influence over Hong Kong could become another key sticking point for an LSE takeover, given the Hong Kong government's close links with the HKEX.\n\nFitch Ratings said that \"increasing control by Chinese authorities over Hong Kong\" could raise regulatory concerns in Britain and the United States about data and information security.\n\nHong Kong is entering a fourth month of sometimes violent protests sparked by legislation that would have drawn the former British colony closer to the Chinese legal system.\n\nThe government's handling of the protests has been criticized internationally, as has the political pressure applied by Beijing to Hong Kong companies not to support the pro-democracy movement.\n\n\"The transaction will require various regulatory approvals, which will stress-test the world's understanding of Hong Kong's 'one country, two systems' constitution,\" said David Blennerhassett, an independent analyst writing on the SmartKarma research platform.\n\nStory continues", "description": "HONG KONG/LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The London Stock Exchange's  board will meet in coming days to decide on the Hong Kong bourse's surprise $39 billion takeover proposal, a source close to the British company said on Thursday, as the market poured cold water on the deal.
