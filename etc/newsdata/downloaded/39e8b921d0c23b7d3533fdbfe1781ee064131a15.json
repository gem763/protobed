It\u2019s a haunting reference to the Bermuda Triangle, the real-life location where many aircraft and ships have supposedly gone missing. It\u2019s beautiful.\n\nCrashed freighters are already a feature of No Man\u2019s Sky, and using the Terrain Manipulator to unearth them will yield you special technology. After you unearth your first one, though, they\u2019re nothing special to look at. When I see one, I\u2019m reminded of a chore I have to do more than the wonder of a procedurally generated universe. This collection of bases puts an emphasis back on the aesthetics of the remains of a massive object that\u2019s fallen from space.\n\nBermuda is four bases, built collaboratively by a team of seven people, depicting massive freighters that have crashed into the natural environment. According to one of the builders on the project, it\u2019s made up of around fifteen thousand individual pieces. The level of detail and care that\u2019s been put into this build is clear to see.\n\nThe crashed freighters all lay against the landscape, embedded into it, like they\u2019ve been there for thousands of years, abandoned. They\u2019re in various states of disrepair, with some more or less intact, and others in pieces, scattered throughout a mountain. Most impressive to me are the models of ships that are designed to look like they\u2019re hauling off parts of these wrecks.\n\nThe video above from one of the builders, BoidGaming, includes the glyphs that will allow you to use a portal to visit the planet if you so desire. I might have to.
