Even Tories in the area know it \u2014 for Boris, every move, every step has been a calculation to Number 10.\"\n\nHe cites conversations with local residents on the doorstep who say Johnson has been a \"terrible\" constituency MP, as well as his recent pledge to spend \u00a31.2 billion extra on hospitals \u2014 none of which is going to Hillingdon, the hospital in his local constituency.\n\n\"Not a penny of that is coming to his own local hospital,\" Milani says. \"He's more interested in running the country than he is in Uxbridge & South Ruislip.\"\n\nMilani, meanwhile, plans to talk up his own local credentials on the doorstep, and try to win over Conservative voters who want a representative who cares about local issues.\n\n\"The fact that I'm a local councillor and a local resident means that I can speak to people in [community] terms,\" he says.\n\n\"So if you ask me about the local schools I know them. My Spad [special advisor] doesn't need to come and whisper in my ear what they are. When I talk about the local hospital and how it needs investment, it's because I had surgery in that hospital.\n\nMilani's profile sits in stark contrast to the Eton-educated prime minister. Unlike Johnson, Milani grew up as an immigrant on a council estate, lost friends to knife crime, and witnessed his mother become homeless while he was studying at university.\n\n\"We're talking about unseating a sitting prime minister. It's never happened before, so of course it's not going to be easy,\"\n\nHe became politicised as he watched the government cut educational maintenance allowance \u2014 grants given to school pupils from low-income backgrounds \u2014 and arrived at university after the same government had trebled tuition fees and hiked interest rates.\n\n\"We're talking about unseating a sitting prime minister. It's never happened before, so of course it's not going to be easy,\" Milani says.\n\n\"But what's at stake for me is everything I went through coming to this country, everything I went through on that council estate with my friends, losing friends to knife crime, the poverty my mum went through.\n\n\"All of these things have led me to this point at which I can make a difference. And I am lucky enough to be in a seat and a campaign that can not only make a difference in Uxbridge, but can send a message to the country. That's enough energy for me to fight two general election campaigns.\"", "description": "The Labour candidate fighting Boris Johnson for his seat is increasingly confident that he can unseat the prime minister and make political history.", "authors": ["Thomas Colson"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8e39b12e22af7538633912-960-480.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
