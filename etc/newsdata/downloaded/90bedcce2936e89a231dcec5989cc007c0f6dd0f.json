A young man who had travelled from the youth set-up in Juventus across continents in search of his big break.\n\nLittle did he know, he was just about to receive his.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nMost in the position of Leicester City\u2019s chairman may have smiled at the sob story, recognised there are no longer any fairytales in \u00adprofessional sport and moved politely onwards. Not \u2018Kun\u2019 (Mister) Vichai.\n\nAfter a brief discussion, the offer of a contract was made. In the football equivalent of Cinderella going to the ball, Lorenzo was about to find one at Leicester.\n\nHe was offered a short-term deal. If he had a dream and was prepared to follow it, then Vichai was prepared to give the 25-year-old a shot. And so it was that Lorenzo was added to Leicester\u2019s development squad. It wasn\u2019t ever likely to work \u2013 and didn\u2019t \u2013 the striker was simply nowhere near the required standard and he was released last summer.\n\nBut if dreams are made to come true, then why should the man who embraced Leicester to his heart \u2013 and received that affection back in spades \u2013 not try his best to realise them?\n\n(Image: Sunday Mirror)\n\n(Image: CameraSport via Getty Images)\n\nOf course, in the beginning there were more grand gestures. Jose Mourinho\u2019s Real Madrid were invited to the King Power to play a pre-season friendly. The cost was \u00a31million. It was to put a stake in the ground.\n\nHowever, it is the untold stories, the little secrets, the tales that aren\u2019t supposed to reach the public domain that make the difference. Such as the one where Kun Vichai spotted a family being shown around the King Power Stadium.\n\nHe engaged them in \u00adconversation and it turned out that they had come to discuss scattering the ashes of a loved one.\n\nRealising that paying for the wake was going to be a struggle, Leicester\u2019s chairman stepped in and paid for the lot at his own expense, hosting the event at the stadium.\n\nAs Leicester\u2019s supporters\u2019 club chairman Cliff Ginneta said at the time of his death: \u201cThe \u00adSrivaddhanaprabha family are loved by the Leicester public \u2013 not just for what they have done for the football club \u2013 but also for the city.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cThey have put the city on the map worldwide.\n\n\u201cThey have put millions of pounds into the club and lots more into hospitals and children\u2019s care.\u201d\n\nThousands will benefit from that patronage, of course, but it is the more personal touches that possibly mean more.\n\nSuch as that involving Richard Page, whose son Ellis suffers from a rare chromosome disorder.\n\nPage Snr cycled to all of \u00adLeicester\u2019s 23 away matches during the 2013-14 promotion campaign, raising money to raise awareness. Vichai intervened, upon hearing of Ellis\u2019 plight, and the youngster was the mascot for the away fixture at QPR, skipper Wes Morgan carrying him on to the pitch.\n\n(Image: Getty Images Europe)\n\nThe campaign\u2019s target was \u00a3100,000 but had fallen some \u00a330,000 short until the chairman and his son, Aiyawatt, donated the cash to push it over the line.\n\nThe Very Reverend David Monteith will lead the eulogy at Sunday\u2019s service.\n\nHe said: \u201cKun Vichai was supportive of so many important causes in Leicester and it\u2019s \u00adheartwarming to see his legacy.\u201d\n\nThe city of Leicester mourned as one 12 months ago when Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha\u2019s helicopter plunged from the sky.\n\nAnd they will unashamedly come together again today to embrace and celebrate the life of a man who became one of their own.", "description": "One year on, the legacy left by Vichai Svriaddhanaprabha following his tragic death continues to touch the people of Leicester", "authors": ["Neil Moxley", "Image", "Getty Images", "Sunday Mirror", "Camerasport Via Getty Images", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Getty Images Europe"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20732529.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FILE-Owner-of-Leicester-City-FC-Vichai-Srivaddhanaprabha-Confirmed-Dead-After-His-helicopter-Crash.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
