That means he got greater than expected backing from his own disaffected MPs (both europhile and eurosceptic) and from Labour politicians crossing the floor (or at least abstaining).\n\nHe's very close to the line; and Letwin and some of his 10 ex-Tory colleagues who backed the amendment are ready to join him once he's complied with the recently passed law by formally asking the European Union for the Brexit delay.\n\nSecond, the Europeans aren't necessarily going to grant a delay exactly in accordance with the opposition parties' wishes. Brussels and Dublin have invested heavily in Johnson's deal this past week, and they want this done. They also don't want Johnson to be able to blame them if it goes wrong.\n\nThe canny EU leaders will take care to avoid the appearance of intervening in Britain's domestic politics, but they'll still be looking to avoid tripping Johnson up. That means they probably won't automatically agree to a three-month Brexit delay \u2013 they'll more likely go for a wait-and-see approach, or an incremental delay.\n\nEU leaders will circle the Brexit mess carefully. AP\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron will continue to play bad cop \u2013 it's his default stance in EU politics these days \u2013 and that will abet Johnson's cause too. Rocky often gets a late, unexpected boost from an unlikely ally.\n\nAll this will help Johnson exert pressure on MPs to come round to him, as the game of chicken counts down to October 31.\n\nThird, he has the simplest and most potent narrative about Brexit. If he can't get his deal over the line, he will blame Parliament for frustrating the will of the people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt may not be a fair accusation, but he's cutting through with it. He's not wildly popular personally, especially not with Remainers, but in most opinion polls in the past week the Conservative Party has been around 10 points clear of Labour.\n\nThe opposition parties are offering the punch-drunk nation a second referendum, further delays, more negotiation \u2013 or, in the Liberal Democrats case, ignoring the result of the first referendum altogether.\n\nThis plays well to the \"Remain\" gallery in their metropolitan seats, but it's not looking like much of a route to an electoral majority.\n\nThe opposition parties may choose not to give Johnson an election. But they are too divided, particularly over Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's suitability for office, to oust him from Downing Street without one.\n\nThis election-withholding tactic has been described as allowing Johnson to stew in his own Brexit mess.\n\nThat may have been true a month ago, but now he has a deal in his pocket, so he can simply wait them out. Yes, he'd have broken his October 31 promise; but having united his party, he can plausibly say that as soon as he has a majority he can deliver his deal in an instant.\n\nIn the Brexit boxing ring, Johnson was at the outset widely expected to fight like a slugger. There have been moments of that, and he has taken some pretty sharp counter-punches from the cross-party group of backbench anti-Brexit greybeards.\n\nOverall, though, he's boxed cleverer than that. It is probably a case of repeated tactical improvisation rather than a grand strategic masterplan, and there have been plenty of slip-ups. But whatever the mishaps \u2013 and there will be more to come \u2013 things look better set up for him to prevail than for any of his opponents.\n\nIn the past month, he has looked increasingly more likely to be the one celebrating when the credits roll.", "description": "The British PM has been pummelled by parliament again, but he still might have a shot at getting his way.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3099%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_90/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/4fa21c4e7421c5a7ff107a4572f67df5bdc9fdeb", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
