One team in the three-nation group will advance to the inaugural tournament\u2019s final stage next year.\n\nDest, who has an American father but was born, raised and trained in soccer in the Netherlands, is an outside back who starts for European power Ajax. Last month, Berhalter started him against Mexico in East Rutherford, N.J., but because that was a friendly and not an official FIFA competition, he remained eligible to apply for a one-time switch.\n\nWith Dest\u2019s rise at Ajax, the Dutch federation has taken a keen interest in him playing for the national team. Coach Ronald Koeman reportedly met with the player last week.\n\nAD\n\nThe U.S. squad will gather next week at George Mason University for training sessions. The 26 players include a young core featuring Chelsea\u2019s Christian Pulisic, Schalke\u2019s Weston McKennie and Werder Bremen\u2019s Josh Sargent and veterans such as Toronto FC\u2019s Michael Bradley and Jozy Altidore and Newcastle\u2019s DeAndre Yedlin, who last week returned to Premier League action from a long-term groin injury.\n\nAD\n\nAlso back from injury is Reading defender Matt Miazga.\n\nPlayers unavailable because of injury include RB Leipzig\u2019s Tyler Adams, Wolfsburg\u2019s John Brooks and Celtic\u2019s Tim Weah.\n\nD.C. United\u2019s Paul Arriola is back in the mix after skipping the September friendlies against Mexico and Uruguay for family reasons. He is among 18 players from MLS, which will conclude the regular season Sunday and start the playoffs Oct. 19-20.\n\nAD\n\nThe only newcomer is Philadelphia midfielder Brenden Aaronson, 18.\n\n\u201cWe continue to bring some of the younger guys along, integrate some new players into camp, but also have a familiar base,\u201d Berhalter said. \u201cMost of the guys have been in camp before, understand how we want to play, and we think that continuity will help in our performance.\u201d\n\nU.S. roster\n\nGoalkeepers: Brad Guzan (Atlanta United), Sean Johnson (New York City FC), Zack Steffen (Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf).\n\nAD\n\nDefenders: Reggie Cannon (FC Dallas), Nick Lima (San Jose Earthquakes), Aaron Long (New York Red Bulls), Daniel Lovitz (Montreal Impact), Matt Miazga (Reading), Tim Ream (Fulham), DeAndre Yedlin (Newcastle United), Walker Zimmerman (Los Angeles FC).\n\nAD\n\nMidfielders: Brenden Aaronson (Philadelphia Union), Michael Bradley (Toronto FC), Sebastian Lletget (Los Angeles Galaxy), Weston McKennie (Schalke), Christian Pulisic (Chelsea), Cristian Roldan (Seattle Sounders), Wil Trapp (Columbus Crew), Jackson Yueill (San Jose Earthquakes).\n\nForwards: Jozy Altidore (Toronto FC), Paul Arriola (D.C.
