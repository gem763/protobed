I sleep very late because of work. So, I take time to have a good sleep before starting the day with a cup of coffee or tea or turmeric tea,\" she says.\n\n\"I go through my emails and browse the internet. To look whats happening. A little bit of social media, then I juggle before heading to the work,\" she adds.\n\nTried many things\n\nAmi recalls her journey and tells how she has finally decided to do what she's doing now after trying several other things.\n\n\"I've had phases and in each of them I've tried to learn something new. From mountaineering to rock climbing etc. There\u2019s so much happening and I want to do everything.\"\n\nShe says that she's lazy and doesn't have enough time to do everything. \"I get into one for I while then I leave it.

There are times when people at bar carry male ego and patriarchy with them. Ami feels that it's a part of the game and one must learn how to gracefully deal with it. She admits that life in bars is much safer than it is outside.\n\n\"Characters stare at you outside the bar more than inside the bar. But its better inside because it\u2019s a safer zone,\" she says.\n\n\"There\u2019s inspiration everywhere. I will not always remain safe. I might do something else to challenge myself. I want to keep challenging myself. I move to another project to challenge myself,\" she concludes.", "description": "Millennials are pursuing all kinds of professions.
