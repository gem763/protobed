I do think that perhaps releasing this kind of a transcript could set a bad precedent,\" White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said during a Monday morning interview with Fox News. \"He is willing to do it, I think. There is a lot of other people, lawyers and such that may have a problem with it. We will see what happens.\" It is rare that a transcript of a president\u2019s call with a foreign leader would be made public, but this case us unusual because the call is reported to be part of the whistleblower complaint.\n\nSusan Walsh/AP\n\nMembers of the White House counsel\u2019s office have been discussing since last week what options are available to them in order to get ahead of any potential legal battle -- one of which includes releasing the transcript either in full or with some redactions.\n\nIn a letter over the weekend to her Democratic colleagues, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the administration \"will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation.\" Pelosi has given a Thursday deadline to the administration to provide information related to the complaint. The deadline is tied to a scheduled appearance by Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire who is expected to testify in front of the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday.\n\nAccording to a readout released from the White House just after the call occurred on July 25, Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \"to congratulate him on his recent election.\"\n\nA more extensive readout from the Ukrainian president's office, also released after the call, noted that the two also spoke about \"investigations into corruption cases that have hampered interaction between Ukraine and the U.S.A.\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Trump pressed him about eight times to investigate Biden's son.\n\nThe president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, has publicly and privately urged in recent months for Ukrainian officials to investigate ties between former Vice President Joe Biden's diplomatic efforts in the country and any connections between his son's business ventures there.\n\nIn a tweet late Monday morning the president questioned the whistleblower\u2019s loyalty: \u201cIs he on our Country\u2019s side. Where does he come from. Is this all about Schiff & the Democrats again after years of being wrong?\u201d\n\nThe identity of the whistleblower has not been released and the president has previously said he does not know who it is.\n\nThe White House declined comment.", "description": "The White House is considering releasing the transcript of President Trump's July call with Ukraine's president, sources told ABC News.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/trump-3-ap-er-190922_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
