Recent posts on social media by one of the children suggested they may instead have been held in the farmhouse against their will.\n\n\u201cWe found six people in a small space in the house which could be locked, not a cellar. It is unclear if they were there voluntarily,\u201d police said in a statement. \u201cThey may have been there for nine years. They say they are a family, a father and five children.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The remote farmhouse in Ruinerwold where the family of six was discovered.

Their mother had apparently died before the family moved to the farm, said the local mayor, Roger de Groot, adding that he had \u201cnever seen anything like this\u201d.\n\nOfficials would not confirm local media reports that the family was waiting for the end of days. \u201cWe understand everyone has lots of questions,\u201d the police statement added. \u201cSo do we. We will investigate properly and carefully.\u201d\n\nA 58-year-old man who was renting the farm but was not the father of the children has been arrested, police confirmed, but they would not reveal his identity. Dutch media identified him as Joseph B, an Austrian odd-job man who had a small workshop on an industrial estate in the nearby town of Meppel.\n\nThe Austrian foreign ministry has confirmed an Austrian citizen from Vienna was being held in relation to the case, but said he did not want contact with officials. The ministry did not know the grounds for his arrest, it said.\n\nOne neighbour told the Telegraaf newspaper that the man, who was seen daily driving an old Volvo car, was \u201cvery sharp \u2026 You only needed to go near the place and he\u2019d send you packing. He watched everything through binoculars\u201d.\n\nDutch media said the oldest of the children, a 25-year-old named only as Jan, had a Facebook account and began posting updates in June for the first time in nine years. \u201cStarted a new job at Creconat,\u201d De Telegraaf newspaper quoted it as saying.\n\n\n\nThe firm, affiliated to another company in Meppel, was raided by police on Monday and belonged to the Austrian man, the paper said. According to the Algemeen Dagblad newspaper, the son also wrote on LinkedIn that his parents had run a successful business until his mother died in 2004.\n\nThe group was discovered after Jan visited a local bar, the Kastelein cafe. On the first occasion, 10 days ago, he \u201cordered and drank five beers on his own\u201d, the owner, Chris Westerbeek, told the local broadcaster RTV Drenthe.\n\nWhen the man reappeared last Sunday, he \u201clooked confused\u201d, Westerbeek said. \u201cHe was unkempt, with long tangled hair. We got talking. He said he had run away and needed urgent help, and that he had never been to school. Then we called the police.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An animal welfare officer holds cat carriers at the farmhouse where the family of six was discovered.

The father was bedridden having suffered a stroke some years ago, it said.\n\nDutch media reported the family appeared to have had little or no contact with the outside world and lived a largely self-sufficient life, apparently growing their own vegetables and keeping a goat and geese.\n\nThe farmhouse\u2019s owners, Klaas Rooze and Alida ten Oever, said the tenant had always paid his rent on time and they were flabbergasted by the news.\n\n\u201cWe knew absolutely nothing of this,\u201d Ten Oever said. \u201cWe rented the house for years to one man and now we learn someone was living there with children. We have no idea who it can be.\u201d", "description": "Police say family was in space that could be locked and may have been there nine years", "authors": ["Jon Henley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5cd89fd633cdbf8a4783d8edb77b09cd73a1df07/452_172_3069_1842/master/3069.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a878beb9e5bd266583f30ad599cf895a", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
