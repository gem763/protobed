Indian shares end over 1% lower; banks, metal stocks take a beating\n\nBENGALURU, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Indian shares closed over 1% lower on Thursday, with financial and metal stocks falling the most, as markets remained wary of government's measures to revive slowing economic growth.\n\nThe broader NSE index ended 1.25% down at 10,704.80, while the benchmark BSE index fell 1.29% to 36,093.47.\n\n\"There is a clear disappointment in the market. The government is showing intent to help, but that is not enough to calm down investors, said Saurabh Jain, assistant vice-president of research at SMC Global Securities in New Delhi.\n\n\"There is chaos and the benefit of doubt that markets were giving to the government that they may come to the rescue is not holding up.\"\n\nIndian markets have been hammered so far this week on concerns around surging crude prices and slowing economic growth, both at home and globally.\n\nYes Bank Ltd , which fell 15.76%, was the top decliner on the NSE index. The Nifty PSU bank index shed 2.25%, with all 12 constituents closing below 1%.\n\nThe Nifty Metals index settled 1.63% lower, with 13 out of 15 constituents finishing in the red.\n\nShares of lender Indiabulls Housing Finance Ltd fell as much as 9.06% to its lowest in nearly five years.\n\nMeanwhile, only seven out of 50 stocks on the blue-chip index ended higher.\n\nFor mid-day report click:", "description": "Indian shares end over 1% lower; banks, metal stocks take a beating", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEB280W7_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
