Lady Gaga's fans have ridiculed the censors and demanded the station aplogise\n\nHere she is! Lady Gaga was nominated for the Best Actress award, together with Olivia Colman, Yalitza Aparicio, Glenn Close and Melissa McCarthy. An uncensored screen grab shows the moment before the result is revealed. The award was won by Olivia Colman\n\nA screen grab circulating on China's Twitter-like Weibo shows the celebrity, who was nominated for her portrayal of Ally Maine in film 'A Star Is Born', is given an awkward square over her face.\n\nThe internet TV service provider, affiliated to hugely popular Hunan Television, also appeared to have omitted Lady Gaga on its web page introducing the nominees of this year's Best Actress category - leaving only Olivia Colman, Yalitza Aparicio, Glenn Close and Melissa McCarthy on the screen.\n\nThe New York-born celebrity won her first Academy Award on Sunday for Best Original Song with 'Shallow' from 'A Star Is Born'. The Best Actress award went to Olivia Colman for her performance in 'The Favourite' as Queen Anne.\n\nA screen grab shared by Lady Gaga fans shows the star was also omitted on a page from Mango TV, which introduced the actresses nominated for the Best Actress category\n\nChina Central Television Station, the national broadcaster, kept Lady Gaga during their version of the ceremony, it is said.\n\nLady Gaga's fans urge Mango TV and Hunan Television to apologise over the matter.\n\nOne music critic, known as 'HeyWarWars', wrote to her 2.8 million followers on Monday: 'The way Mango TV handled the matter was more than disrespectful. Hope they can give a respond to the fans.'\n\nLady Gaga accepts the award for Best Original Song during the 91st Annual Academy Awards at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood. Viewers of China's Mango TV were not shown the star\n\nProducers at Mango TV also reportedly deleted the singer's performance of Oscar-winning song 'Shallow' with her co-star Bradley Cooper. The two are seen on stage together\n\n'LadyGagaToday', a fan account on Weibo, queried: 'When \"A Star Is Born' was screening, it was praised by many party-run media such as CCTV channels and BJ News. Mango TV, are you okay?'\n\nMango TV has not issued any statement on why they had deliberately obscured Lady Gaga, but many Chinese web users speculated that it could be related to an alleged ban from Beijing against Lady Gaga after her meeting with Dalai Lama.\n\nIt is thought that Mango TV had made the decision to censor Lady Gaga on its own to avoid potential political issues.\n\nControversy arose after Lady Gaga met Dalai Lama at a conference in the United States in 2016\n\nIt was reported that China banned media companies from playing or uploading the celebrity's music after she showed her support to Dalai Lama, whom China views as a separatist\n\nPrevious reports suggested the singer and actress was barred by the Chinese authorities after meeting Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibet whom China views as a separatist, at a conference in the United States in 2016.\n\nChinese internet users also left thousands of angry comments on Lady Gaga's social media accounts after she posted pictures of the meeting.\n\nAt the time, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson denied to comment on the reported ban on Lady Gaga's music, but Hong Kong-based newspaper Apple Daily claimed that Beijing had issued an internal notice to media companies after the Lady Gaga-Dalai meeting to prohibit them from playing or uploading music from the singer.\n\nMailOnline has contacted Mango TV and representatives of Lady Gaga for comments on the matter.\n\nMango TV also censored the acceptance speech by Rami Malek when he mentioned 'gay man'\n\nApparently, Lady Gaga wasn't the only victim of Mango TV's censors at this year's Oscars. They also edited the words from Best Actor winner Rami Malek when the 'Bohemian Rhapsody' star mentioned 'gay man' in his acceptance speech.\n\nRami said 'we made a film about a gay man, an immigrant, who lived his life unapologetically himself' as he showed respect to Queen's lead singer Freddie Mercury, whom Rami portrayed in the film. Freddie died of AIDS-related complications in 1991.\n\nWhile giving Chinese translation to the speech, producers used the Chinese phrase for 'a special group' instead of 'gay man'.\n\nThis is not the first time Mango TV has censored major Western entertainment shows.\n\nDuring last year's Eurovision Song Contest, performances including tattoos and a gay-themed dance were cut from a semi-final broadcast by Mango TV. Producers also blurred out rainbow flags in the audience associated with the LGBT movement.", "description": "Mango TV, a popular internet TV station in China, is said to have blurred out the 32-year-old's face during the Oscars awards ceremony on Sunday and deleted her performance on stage.", "authors": ["Tracy You For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/27/12/10348408-0-image-a-31_1551269953880.jpg", "published_at": "2019-02-27"}
