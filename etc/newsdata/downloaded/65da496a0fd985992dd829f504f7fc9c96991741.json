I was sitting in the control room of a fusion energy startup called TAE Technologies, and I\u2019d just fired its $150 million plasma collider. That shot was a tiny part of the company\u2019s long pursuit of a notoriously elusive power source. I was at the company\u2019s headquarters to talk to them about the latest phase of their hunt that involves an algorithm called the Optometrist.\n\nNuclear fusion is the reaction that\u2019s behind the Sun\u2019s energetic glow. Here on Earth, the quixotic, expensive quest for controlled fusion reactions gets a lot of hype and a lot of hate. (To be clear, this isn\u2019t the same process that happens in a hydrogen bomb. That\u2019s an uncontrolled fusion reaction.) The dream is that fusion power would mean plenty of energy with no carbon emissions or risk of a nuclear meltdown. But scientists have been pursuing fusion power for decades, and they are nowhere near adding it to the grid.\n\nLast year, a panel of advisers to the US Department of Energy published a list of game-changers that could \u201cdramatically increase the rate of progress towards a fusion power plant.\u201d The list included advanced algorithms, like artificial intelligence and machine learning. It\u2019s a strategy that TAE Technologies is banking on: the 20-year-old startup began collaborating with Google a few years ago to develop machine learning tools that it hopes will finally bring fusion within reach.\n\nAttempts at fusion involve smacking lightweight particles into one another at temperatures high enough that they fuse together, producing a new element and releasing energy. Some experiments control a super-hot ionized gas called plasma with magnetic fields inside a massive metal doughnut called a tokamak. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory fires the world\u2019s largest laser at a tiny gold container with an even tinier pellet of nuclear fuel inside. TAE twirls plasma inside a linear machine named Norman, tweaking thousands of variables with each shot.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible for a person to keep all of those variables in their head or to change them one at a time. That\u2019s why TAE is collaborating with Google, using a system called the Optometrist algorithm that helps the team home in on the ideal conditions for fusion. We weren\u2019t sure what to make of all the hype surrounding AI or machine learning or even fusion energy for that matter. So the Verge Science video team headed to TAE\u2019s headquarters in Foothill Ranch, California, to see how far along it is, and where \u2014 if anywhere \u2014 AI entered the picture. You can watch what we found in the video above.\n\nUltimately, we found a lot of challenges but a lot of persistent optimism, too. \u201cThe end goal is to have power plants that are burning clean fuels that are abundant, [and] last for as long as humanity could last,\u201d says Erik Trask, a lead scientist at TAE. \u201cNow, we think that we have found a way to do it, but we have to show it. That\u2019s the hard part.\u201d", "description": "The quixotic, expensive quest for an electrical grid powered by nuclear fusion gets a lot of hype and a lot of hate.
