A senior House Democratic aide said the hearings could begin within the next month.\n\nThe measure will set the stage for House investigating committees to forward evidence they have collected to the House Judiciary Committee, which would then decide whether to advance articles of impeachment against Trump.\n\nEven if the House impeaches Trump, he would face a trial in the Republican-controlled Senate, which for the moment seems unlikely to convict the president and force his ouster.\n\nImpeachment requires a simple majority in the 435-member House but conviction demands the support of a two-thirds majority in the 100-member Senate.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi speaks during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., October 17, 2019. REUTERS/Erin Scott\n\nWITNESS STAYS AWAY\n\nCharles Kupperman, a former deputy to ousted national security adviser John Bolton, failed to appear earlier on Monday before the three House panels conducting the Ukraine phase of the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry, lawmakers said.\n\nOther panels are probing separate issues, including Trump\u2019s finances and abuses of White House security clearances.\n\nKupperman put off testifying while asking a court to rule on whether he should comply with a congressional subpoena or honor the Trump administration\u2019s order not to testify, his lawyers said last week.\n\nDemocrats in turn said they would not let further legal maneuverings delay their work.\n\nAt least nine others have testified despite being instructed by the White House not to do so, Schiff said.\n\nKupperman was expected to provide testimony about Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine brought to Congress\u2019 attention by a report from a whistleblower about a July 25 telephone call between the U.S. president and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\n\nTrump\u2019s request to Zelenskiy that he investigate former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, a leading candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, and his son Hunter Biden, who had served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company, is the focus of the inquiry being conducted by the three panels.\n\nTrump made his request after withholding $391 million in security aid approved by the U.S. Congress to help fight Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.\n\nA separate White House official, Alexander Vindman, a lieutenant colonel who sits on the National Security Council and who listened in on the call, is expected to tell lawmakers in a closed-door hearing on Tuesday that the conversation alarmed him so much that he raised concerns with an NSC lawyer.\n\nBut Trump again dismissed the inquiry in comments to reporters.\n\n\u201cI had a great conversation with the Ukrainian president. I had another with him also, I think before that, which was the same thing, it was nothing. They tried to take that conversation and make it into a big scandal,\u201d Trump said on Monday.\n\nSlideshow (7 Images)\n\nSchiff noted that a federal judge had validated the legality of the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry in a decision about releasing information regarding a separate investigation, into Russian election interference in 2016, to Congress and that all witnesses need to come forward when called.\n\nThe Trump administration appealed that ruling on Monday.\n\n(For a graphic on 'The impeachment inquiry' click tmsnrt.rs/30NregM)", "description": "Democrats in Congress, answering Republican complaints that their impeachment investigation of U.S. President Donald Trump is being conducted in secret, plan a vote on Thursday on how to make their inquiry public, a significant new stage in the probe.", "authors": ["Patricia Zengerle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446009568&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R1M1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
