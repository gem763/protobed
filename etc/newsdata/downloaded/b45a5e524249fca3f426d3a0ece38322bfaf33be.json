The House Judiciary Committee approved guidelines for an impeachment inquiry while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi indignantly insisted that the resolution didn't actually mean impeachment was underway \u2014 a step she worries would imperil House Democrats in competitive districts.\n\nAnd almost precisely as the Democrats' debate was beginning in Houston, Trump was starting to speak to House Republicans who were meeting in Baltimore, previewing the arguments he will make in the campaign. He was running well past schedule, and spoke for more than an hour, a split-screen that may have been deliberate.\n\n\"The country will go to hell,\" if a Democrat wins the White House, the president declared, saying they were \"going to take your money, they're going to take, and very much hurt, your families.\"\n\nThird Democratic debate: Who were the winners and losers\n\nRivals stand side by side\n\nJust 10 Democratic candidates qualified for the debate in Houston, held at Texas Southern University. That's still a big crowd, but it was small enough that all the contenders could appear on stage on a single night. Biden, the leader, and Warren, his fastest-rising rival, were face to face for the first time.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidates former Vice President Joe Biden, left and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., talk Thursday, Sept. 12, 2019, during a Democratic presidential primary debate hosted by ABC at Texas Southern University in Houston. More\n\n\"I know the senator says she's with Bernie,\" Biden said at one pointing, gesturing toward Warren. \"Well, I'm for Barack,\" touting his relationship with former President Barack Obama. In fact, Obama was lauded by just about everybody, even those who want to replace his signature Affordable Care Act with Medicare for All.\n\nWarren first praised Obama, and then defended installing single-payer system.\n\n\"The richest individuals and the biggest corporations are going to pay more, and middle-class families are going to pay less,\" she said.\n\nWhile Medicare for All has excited base Democratic voters, some contenders made a more vigorous case against it.\n\n\"I don't think it's a bold idea; I think it's a bad idea,\" Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar said.\n\nPete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, criticized it for taking away the option of private coverage.\n\n\"I trust the American people to make the right choice for them,\" he said. \"Why don't you?\"\n\nOn some issues, the differences among the Democratic presidential candidates are getting sharper.\n\nFormer Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke, who has increasingly focused on gun violence in the weeks since a mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso, argued passionately for a mandatory buyback program for assault-style weapons. Gun-rights advocates call that confiscation.\n\n\"Hell yes,\" O'Rourke declared. \"We're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47. We\u2019re not going to allow it to be used against a fellow American anymore.\u201d (Moments after the debate ended, the O'Rourke campaign website was offering $30 T-shirts that read, \"Hell yes we're going to take your AR-15.\")", "description": "With Joe Biden flanked by Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, contenders clash over whether defeating Trump requires transformation or moderation.", "authors": ["Susan Page", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/h77YLz8KifGhzK6yZdx5zA--~B/aD0yMjg2O3c9MzQyOTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/6e4a2bb425bb8a1bc61a6291ef2c4f57", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
