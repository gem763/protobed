But at the same time, I'm now waiting for a #WagathaChristie costume to surface.\"\n\nA third called Kieran a \"genius\", with a fourth writing that he had achieved \"peak Internet.\"\n\nColeen suspected it might be Becky who was telling the press about the stories she posted about on her private Instagram.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nSlowly deleting more and more people from her account, Coleen was left with just Becky - now Coleen claims it was her all along, an accusation that Becky denies.\n\nMum of four Coleen crafted a public outing of Becky's alleged leaks by taking to Twitter and penning a lengthy post.\n\nShe explained: \"After a long time of trying to figure out who it could be, for various reasons, I had a suspicion.\n\n\"To try and prove this, I came up with an idea. I blocked everyone from viewing my Instagram stories except ONE account. (Those on my private account must have been wondering why I haven't had stories on there for a while.)\"\n\nLater in the post, she concluded: \"I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them.\n\n\"It's...Rebekah Vardy's account.\"", "description": "Kieran's costume shows him with a number of 'private' stories on his chest with a notice saying Rebekah Vardy had seen them", "authors": ["Will Twigger", "Image", "Twitter", "_Knuge", "Getty Images", "Ken Mckay Itv Rex Shutterstock"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20741914.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Bloke-dresses-as-Becky-Vardys-account-for-Halloween.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
