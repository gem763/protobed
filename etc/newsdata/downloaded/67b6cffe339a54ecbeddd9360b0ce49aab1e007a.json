Those days are long gone though. This was 1-0 but it was by no means assured.\n\nBy the time Martin Atkinson blew for full-time, you had half forgotten the Gunners were beating Bournemouth. At the Emirates Stadium right now Arsenal are awesome in attack but rather less so in defence. A far cry from the George Graham-Tony Adams 1-0 era.\n\nNot that Unai Emery was too bothered. Third in the table going into the international break is not bad for a club in the midst of a 'crisis' after letting slip a 2-0 lead to draw at Watford last month. Arsenal have lost only once all season \u2014 a 3-1 defeat at title favourites Liverpool.\n\nDavid Luiz heads home in the ninth minute with his first goal for the Gunners after early pressure from the north London hosts\n\nThe Brazilian centre-back celebrates his header at the Emirates Stadium in front of the Arsenal fans as they started strongly\n\nArsenal captain Granit Xhaka (middle) jumps for joy into goalscorer David Luiz in early first-half celebrations at the Emirates\n\nThe whole Arsenal team pile on David Luiz after he scored his first goal for the North London club\n\nWe have been here before, of course. Last season's 22-match unbeaten run had everyone asking 'Arsene who?' By May, another season of Europa League football was the prize. With that in mind, you'd forgive supporters for reserving judgment this time around. But after their first home Premier League clean sheet of the season there are reasons for optimism. They started like a house on fire with David Luiz scoring his first goal for the club.\n\nBut the only moment any Arsenal fan would have enjoyed in the following 81 minutes was the final whistle. Such pessimism is warranted, unfortunately. Arsenal's soft centre has been exposed time after time after time.\n\nOn this occasion, though, their defence stood firm, if not without the odd alarm against a Bournemouth team who felt they were worth at least a point. This Arsenal back four cannot be compared to the legendary defences of old but on this occasion they deserve credit, because goodness knows they've had their fair share of criticism.\n\n'Going third in the table was our objective today,' said Emery. 'It's important for the team. We didn't want to feel the pressure of going third and maybe in the second half we felt that pressure. But we can remember today and improve with the spirit we showed.'\n\nPepe had another frustrating afternoon in front of goal as he continues to search for his first strike from open play\n\nEddie Howe's Bournemouth side struggled to get into the game in the first half, with Arsenal throwing men forward\n\nMATCH FACTS AND PLAYER RATINGS Arsenal (4-2-3-1): Leno 7; Chambers 7, Luiz 7.5, Sokratis 7, Kolasinac 7; Xhaka 6.5, Guendouzi 7; Pepe 6 (Martinelli 63, 6), Ceballos 5.5 (Willock 75), Saka 6.5 (Torreira 83); Aubameyang 6. Subs not used: Tierney, Maitland Niles, Holding, Martinez. Goals: Luiz (9) Booked: Martinelli Bournemouth (4-4-2): Ramsdale 6; Stacey 6.5 (Francis 80), Steve Cook 6.5, Ake 6.5, Rico 6.5; Harry Wilson 6.5 (Danjuma 80), Lerma 6, Billing 6, King 6; Callum Wilson 6.5, Solanke 6 (Fraser 63, 6). Subs not used: Boruc, Surman Lewis Cook, Kelly. Booked: Billing, Stacey\n\nThe Gunners began at a rapid pace.\n\nPierre-Emerick Aubameyang fired narrowly wide in the sixth minute before Luiz's red-letter moment arrived. It was simple, the Brazilian rising above Callum Wilson, whose lapse in concentration allowed Luiz to glance an inch- perfect header past Aaron Ramsdale in the ninth minute.\n\nThat should have been the signal for Arsenal to saunter home. Life isn't so simple at for Emery at the moment, though. It wasn't that Arsenal were made to sweat, but every so often their defensive shortcomings were horribly exposed, as if to serve notice that they are in for an uncomfortable ride.\n\nThe first such moment arrived in the 18th minute when former Liverpool striker Dominic Solanke headed Diego Rico's free-kick narrowly wide when he should have scored. It was a free header, deep inside Arsenal's box, the sort of chance a Premier League striker should gobble up.\n\nThat Solanke was allowed to manoeuvre himself into that position, however, underlines why Arsenal are not guaranteed to remain in the top four.\n\nEmery may look to the imminent return of full-backs Hector Bellerin and Kieran Tierney \u2014 who was on the bench \u2014 from injury as reason to be optimistic about his shaky defence. They may be the answer but, for now, Arsenal are negotiating matches with the fear that disaster is just round the corner.\n\nPepe's penalty appeal after a coming together with Diego Rico was waved away following a VAR check in the first half\n\nCallum Wilson (right) was a threat in the second half for the visitors but couldn't quite find the back of the net to equalise\n\nHad Nicolas Pepe's attractive curling effort from the edge of the box found the top left corner then perhaps the rest of the afternoon would not have been so edgy. Instead, some fans had to watch the second half through the gaps between their fingers.\n\nCallum Wilson ripped through the heart of Arsenal's defence in the 51st minute before appearing to put Bournemouth's equaliser on a plate for Josh King, only for Calum Chambers to muster a goal-saving block. Five minutes later Jack Stacey's effort from Harry Wilson's cross was tipped over the bar by Bernd Leno as Bournemouth sensed an equaliser.\n\nGiven how the Gunners have defended at various junctures this season, it seemed a matter of when rather than if the visitors would score. But credit to Arsenal's defence, they displayed a cohesion and tenacity that will have Emery hoping for better days at the back.\n\nYet they were still indebted to Matteo Guendouzi's heroic last-ditch challenge in the 89th minute to prevent King from equalizing after good work from Arnaut Danjuma.\n\nSo, 1-0 to the Arsenal \u2014 we've not heard that much recently.\n\nGabriel Martinelli was subbed on in the second half for his second Premier League appearance after impressing in midweek\n\nBukayo Saka (left) had another skillful performance on the left-wing before being substituted in the 83rd minute by Emery\n\nRyan Fraser (left) failed to make a significant impact when coming on as a substitute for the visitors in the second half", "description": "SAMI MOKBEL AT THE EMIRATES: Arsenal secured their fourth win of the Premier League season after David Luiz' header was enough to see off Eddie Howe's Bournemouth.", "authors": ["Sami Mokbel For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/16/19364060-0-image-a-44_1570374936000.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
