REUTERS/Cansul Alkaya\n\nLast year men murdered 440 women in Turkey, unofficial data show, more than doubling from 2012 when Ankara passed a law on preventing violence against women - a rise which some women\u2019s groups attribute to the failure to implement the legislation.\n\nTurkey does not keep official statistics on femicide. World Health Organization data say 38% of women in Turkey are subject to violence from a partner in their lifetime, compared to about 25% in Europe.\n\nOne woman\u2019s murder in August, captured on video, triggered nationwide protests by women, raising pressure on Ankara to act and prompting President Tayyip Erdogan to say he would approve any parliamentary move to restore the death penalty in Turkey.\n\nEmine Bulut, 38, was stabbed by her former husband in front of her daughter. A Turkish court sentenced him to life in jail on Monday.\n\n\u201cWe have the same (first) name but don\u2019t let our fate be the same,\u201d Dirican, 43, said in a tearful interview, sitting with her mother in the home where her husband shot her in January after she sought a divorce.\n\nThe court sentenced her husband to nine years in jail on various counts including wilful injury, rejecting charges that he attempted to kill her. He was then released pending appeal.\n\nDirican, a beauty clinic employee, was shot in the leg and had to quit work. She says she is afraid to leave her home for fear of being attacked. She faces a divorce hearing this month.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be found dead somewhere or for acid to be thrown at me,\u201d she said, adding that she was not receiving personal protection. \u201cWhat is important to me is that the state protects me while I am alive.\u201d\n\nGOVERNMENT RESPONSE\n\nTurkey led the way in ratifying a 2011 Council of Europe accord, the Istanbul Convention, which prioritizes gender equality. It also passed legislation in 2012 to protect women.\n\nBut women\u2019s groups say authorities are failing to implement their commitments under the Convention.\n\n\u201cThe reason for violence increasing is that the judiciary and security forces are not using the available mechanisms,\u201d Canan Gullu, head of the Turkish Federation of Women\u2019s Associations told Reuters in an interview.\n\nPerpetrators also believe they can secure reduced sentences through good behavior and acting like a victim, she said.\n\nTurkey\u2019s family ministry did not respond to Reuters\u2019 questions regarding violence against women. However, Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gul vowed after the killing of Bulut that the government would do whatever it takes to stem the violence.\n\n\u201cIf it will save just one person, if it prevents one child, one woman from dying or facing violence, we will change not just a law but even the constitution,\u201d he told reporters last month.\n\nThe government has taken measures such as tagging individuals known to resort to violence and creating a smartphone app in 2018 through which women can alert police.\n\nDownloads of the app surged to some 320,000 following Emine Bulut\u2019s murder from 70,000 beforehand, a deputy police chief said in an interview last month.\n\nThe Council of Europe body which monitors the Convention\u2019s implementation called in a report a year ago for Turkey to abolish practices which discriminate against women, saying the root cause of the violence was gender inequality.\n\nFidan Ataselim, general secretary of a platform set up to halt the killing of women, said the violence also reflected the inability of some men to accept the increased opportunities Turkish women now enjoy due to social changes.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the excuses, they were killed because they wanted to make decisions about their own lives - to divorce, to work, to wear what they choose,\u201d she said.\n\nHer group compiles the unofficial data on the number of Turkish women killed by men, which rose to 440 last year from 210. The number stood at 53 in September alone, it said.\n\n\u201cDEVIL WITH ANGEL\u2019S FACE\u201d\n\nHowever, many in conservative and Islamist circles in Turkey are hostile to the Istanbul Convention and say gender equality undermines the institution of family.\n\nWell-known Islamist writer Abdurrahman Dilipak said legislation designed to protect women, such as through restraining orders, was actually fuelling divorces and violence.\n\n\u201cWandering among us is a devil with an angel\u2019s face which is organizing conflict, not peace, within the family,\u201d he said in an interview in his home on the Asian side of Istanbul.\n\n\u201cThe family is collapsing. With an international agreement (the Istanbul Convention), a trap is being set up against women, men, children, the family.\u201d\n\nWhile most violence is within the family, and much of it is related to divorce proceedings, women\u2019s groups say there are also many cases where women are victims of violence solely because of their gender in a heavily patriarchal society.\n\nAcelya Sengul\u2019s mother Fatma was shot by a work colleague in front of their house in March and died in the arms of her daughter. After her death, women carried her coffin and staged a march in protest and Sengul said this support helped her cope.\n\n\u201cWomen saying they stand beside me gives me more strength. I feel I am not alone. I feel they are beside me,\u201d she said.", "description": "Emine Dirican's husband shot her in January and was released from jail pending appeal in May, leaving her in fear of being attacked again in a case that underscores the vulnerability of women to violent attack and murder in Turkey.", "authors": ["Daren Butler", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443348938&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K0XP", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
