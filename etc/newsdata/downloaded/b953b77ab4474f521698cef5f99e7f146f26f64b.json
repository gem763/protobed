And that\u2019s different than just scrutiny. That\u2019s, what would you call that? That\u2019s a different beast. It\u2019s really a different beast.\"\n\n\"And I think the grass is always greener,\" Meghan added. \"You have no idea. It\u2019s really hard to understand what it\u2019s like. I know what it seems like it should be. It\u2019s a very different thing. That\u2019s okay.
