For instance, composer Geoff Zanelli (\u201cTraffik\u201d) uses a piece that recalls the thunderous \u201cSicario\u201d score, while Taylor and screenwriter Peter A. Dowling (\u201cFlightplan\u201d) borrow from the classic bloody bathtub scene from \u201cTraining Day.\u201d\n\nBut Taylor tries to do the now-inevitable filmmaker exercise of infusing \u201cBlack and Blue\u201d with #BlackLivesMatter themes. Opening the film with officer Alicia West (Naomie Harris) getting pulled over and thrown against a fence by white cops for looking like one of their so-called suspects, Taylor brings us into a narrative that underscores the fact a police badge doesn\u2019t preclude a black person from being profiled and criminalized.\n\nAlso Read: Naomie Harris to Star in HBO-Sky Limited Series 'The Third Day'\n\nWhat is interesting, though, is how the film shows the complexity of black cops navigating a police force known to be corrupt and racist. On the one hand, there is Darius (James Moses Black, \u201cThis Is Us\u201d), a seasoned cop who interlocks himself with some of the most nefarious members of the squad. Among them is Grillo\u2019s trigger-happy Malone, a narc who\u2019s masterminded a never-fully-explained scheme that culminates with his murder of a young black drug dealer. Whether Malone and his team were robbing the dope peddler or stealing his drugs remains a mystery.\n\nBut then there\u2019s Alicia, a rookie cop who later reveals that she joined the force \u201cto make a difference,\u201d which sounds na\u00efve in today\u2019s era, because we forget that that\u2019s supposed to be the objective of law enforcement. Because of her allegiance to the \u201cblue\u201d team, however, she\u2019s seen as a traitor to her black neighborhood and friends, including Mouse (Tyrese Gibson) and Missy (Nafessa Williams, \u201cBlack Lightning\u201d). Alicia tries to straddle both worlds, but it isn\u2019t until her body camera records Malone executing the young black man that she finds herself aligning with her estranged black kinship to protect herself from her crooked team members, who are ravaging the neighborhood looking to kill her and steal the footage.\n\nAlso Read: 'Fast and Furious' Star Tyrese Gibson to Host Celebrity Car Racing Show for MGM\n\nThen in another corner of the story is Darius (Mike Colter, \u201cLuke Cage\u201d), a criminal lord and uncle of the deceased young man who\u2019s in cahoots with Malone\u2019s operation and quick to take his word that it was actually Alicia who killed his nephew. All of a sudden, Alicia is not only on the lam from the cops but also from Darius and, by extension, the impoverished black neighborhood he commands.\n\nDowling\u2019s screenplay could have used a whole lot more exposition, especially about Darius and Missy, who mostly serve as peripheral characters to a story that is really about Alicia grappling with what it means to be black and a member of law enforcement. What is Darius getting out of his relationship with Malone other than, presumably, immunity? Is he just a sheep or does he get off on criminalizing black people too? We know Alicia becoming a cop put a rift between her and Missy and Mouse, but why did she move out of their neighborhood, widening their divide?\n\nWithout those answers and more nuanced commentary, \u201cBlack and Blue\u201d hinges on hackneyed corrupt-cop drama tropes that pay homage to older, better movies. Malone\u2019s macho declaration that he has jurisdiction over Darius\u2019 neighborhood tries and fails to resonate as much as Denzel Washington\u2019s epic \u201cKing Kong\u201d scene in \u201cTraining Day.\u201d\n\nHarris, as usual, delivers a solid performance in a movie that is ultimately not up to her level, while the supporting performances are adequately committed to a film that has potential but ends up being a basic procedural drama with little of substance to say about the way blackness functions in the relationship between the police and civilians. And because most of the surrounding characters \u2014 including Alicia\u2019s partner (Reid Scott, \u201cVeep\u201d) \u2014 are underdeveloped, the moral decisions they make in the film are that much more perplexing.\n\n\u201cBlack and Blue\u201d is chock-full of heart-pounding car chases and suspenseful moments that are certain to entertain mainstream audiences, but the flm falters when it attempts, beyond its tittle to reflect a necessary and under-discussed conversation about societal issues.\n\nRead original story \u2018Black and Blue\u2019 Film Review: Naomie Harris Plays a Conflicted Cop in By-the-Numbers Drama At TheWrap", "description": "It\u2019s kind of funny that, just a few years ago, Frank Grillo was in \u201cThe Purge: Anarchy,\u201d in which he struggled to survive the night against morally corrupt civilians with a 12-hour license to kill, and now he\u2019s playing a cop tripping off a limitless authority to murder in \u201cBlack and Blue.\u201d It\u2019s this", "authors": ["Candice Frederick"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/OEmLbh5tBeSkDfSGFqpgtA--~B/aD00MDA7dz02MTg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thewrap.com/ece04c1759fae93316fad44afadfcec9", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
