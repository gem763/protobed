Another \u201cstress test\u201d of links to the airport was called off.\n\nActivists also plan to gather outside the British consulate on Sunday to demand that China honours the Sino-British Joint Declaration that was signed in 1984, laying out the former British colony\u2019s post-1997 future.\n\nChina says Hong Kong is now its internal affair. It denies meddling in Hong Kong and has accused the United States, Britain and others of fomenting the unrest. Britain says it has a legal responsibility to ensure China abides by its obligations under the Joint Declaration.\n\nPolice have responded to violence with tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets, water cannon and baton charges, as well as firing several live shots in the air, prompting complaints of excessive force.\n\nOn Thursday, Hong Kong\u2019s government rejected a warning from a Canadian think tank that the city\u2019s position as one of the world\u2019s freest economies is threatened by China\u2019s \u201cheavy hand\u201d.\n\nHong Kong is facing its first recession in a decade as a result of the protests. Multiple events and conferences have been cancelled and the number of visitors plunged 40 percent in August. The city\u2019s premier women\u2019s tennis event scheduled for October has been postponed.\n\nSlideshow (15 Images)\n\nOrganisers also called off the Royal Shakespeare Company\u2019s \u201cMatilda the Musical\u201d, due to run from Sept. 20 to Oct. 20.\n\nThe Fraser Institute, an independent public policy research organisation, said Hong Kong was one of the most economically free jurisdictions in the world but \u201cinterference from China including the violent crackdown on pro-democracy protests - severely threatens Hong Kong\u2019s rule of law\u201d.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s government said the comments were \u201centirely ungrounded and not borne out by objective facts\u201d, with human rights and freedom fully protected, according to a statement released late on Thursday.", "description": "Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam promised to prioritise housing and jobs to appease pro-democracy protesters in the Chinese-ruled city after three months of sometimes violent unrest, as scuffles broke out between pro-Beijing and anti-government demonstrators.", "authors": ["Jessie Pang", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429349264&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C07Q", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
