But three years after her rescue, the prospects of making it back to her family appeared ever more distant.\n\nFor Priya, now 24, was one of about 180 Bangladeshi sex trafficking survivors stuck in shelters in West Bengal - with many having waited years for official clearance to go home due to complex and lengthy bureaucracy across the two countries.\n\n\"How long can I wait?\", said Priya, using her 'brothel name' to hide her identity for fear of being shamed in Bangladesh.\n\n\"Maybe I won't go now even if they ask me to,\" she said last month at a shelter, sitting in a room adorned with paper roses.\n\nVictims wishing to return home must first gain approval from police, social workers, judges, border forces and bureaucrats at both state and federal level, a process that involves about 15 steps, analysis by the Thomson Reuters Foundation has revealed.\n\nWhile the two nations are working towards faster returns, the long waits facing dozens of survivors could stymie their efforts to start life afresh back home and leave them vulnerable to being trafficked again, according to activists.\n\n\"Living in a shelter ... can be traumatic,\" said Tariqul Islam of Justice and Care, a charity that reintegrates victims in Bangladesh. \"When they return after two years or more, it becomes hard for them to adjust to the changes and recover.\"\n\n\"Traffickers often keep track of their victims even after they return home. When they notice that the girl does not have a job, or is finding it hard to adjust, they target her again.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFASTER RETURNS AFOOT\n\nThousands of Bangladeshis are trafficked to India each year - many of whom are sold into prostitution or domestic servitude - anti-slavery activists say, although official data is lacking.\n\nIn the last eight years, Bangladesh has brought home about 1,750 trafficking survivors from India, predominantly women and girls in West Bengal and the western state of Maharashtra.\n\nHowever anti-slavery charities that help victims in India say most are kept in shelters for years - first awaiting the conclusion of court proceedings, then the repatriation process.\n\nJustice is often slow and convictions are rare. One in four trafficking cases in India leads to conviction, while in Bangladesh, only 30 convictions have been secured under a 2012 law, with more than 4,000 cases still awaiting trial.\n\nIndia and Bangladesh signed a partnership in 2015 to speed up repatriations, but how a victim is treated - whether it is their experience with the judiciary or the wait to go home - varies from one Indian state to another, according to activists.\n\nA long-awaited deal aimed at streamlining the system is to be finalised soon, officials from the two governments said.\n\n\"At the moment it sometimes takes 18 to 22 months,\" said Ferdousi Akhter, joint secretary with Bangladesh's interior ministry. Yet charities say it can drag on for up to six years.\n\n\"A victim has to go through many layers to be repatriated from India,\" Akhter added. \"We are in talks to cut down these layers ... victims can surely make faster returns.\"\n\nSLEEPLESS NIGHTS\n\nIn a small house on the outskirts of Bangladesh's capital Dhaka, mother-of-two Basiron remembered the call to say her missing daughters had been found in a brothel in India a year after they disappeared.\n\n\"When I heard the news, I screamed! I felt as though my heart was going to burst,\" the 47-year-old single parent said.\n\nThe girls - now aged 16 and 17 - were rescued in 2017 from a brothel in West Bengal where they were held in one room, beaten, plied with drink and drugs until addicted, and repeatedly raped.\n\nTwo years on, they are still waiting to go home.\n\nCharges against the 16 people arrested in their trafficking case are yet to be filed in court, which refused them permission to return and testify from Bangladesh.", "description": "SOUTH 24 PARGANAS, India/DHAKA, Oct 9 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - P riya was 15 when a relative in Bangladesh tricked her with the promise of a dream job as a singer, drugged her, and trafficked her across the border into the sex trade in India.
