Margaret Atwood Reveals Plot", "language": "en", "text": "When most people think of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, Margaret Atwood\u2019s 1985 classic dystopian novel, they think of the color red. The long red robes and white bonnets worn by women forced into reproductive slavery in the Republic of Gilead have become a symbol of oppression, an eye-catching cue that represents both Atwood\u2019s influence and the global problems she probes in her fiction. So fans took notice when her publisher revealed bright green cover art for The Testaments.\n\nIn recent interviews for a cover story on the legendary author, Atwood answered TIME\u2019s questions about the most intriguing aspects of her highly anticipated sequel, the color of the cover included. For the latter, she has a surprisingly simple answer: \u201cI colored it with my crayons and said, \u2018I think it would look better green.\u2019\u201d She adds that the color, \u201cspring green,\u201d evokes hope.\n\nAtwood\u2019s long-awaited sequel to The Handmaid\u2019s Tale hits shelves today. Like the original, The Testaments strikes a balance between propulsive storytelling and dark references to both past and present. But while the new book answers some crucial questions about Gilead, it also leaves many open to interpretation \u2014 which is Atwood\u2019s way. The author prefers to let readers come to their own conclusions. \u201cI\u2019m the person who\u2019s against dictatorship, remember that?\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell the reader what to think.\u201d\n\nPhotograph by Mickalene Thomas for TIME\n\nTIME\u2019s cover story on Atwood avoided spoiling details from the The Testaments beyond the broad identities of its three narrators. This article draws on interviews with Atwood to answer a few of the most compelling questions about the book and analyze the meaning of those narrative choices. Do not read further if you have not yet read The Testaments and do not want to learn more details about its contents.\n\nHere are Atwood\u2019s answers to nine burning questions about The Testaments.\n\nDoes Offred survive?\n\nOffred\u2019s story in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale ends with her stepping into a van that will take her \u201cinto the darkness, within; or else the light.\u201d In an interview with TIME, Atwood says, \u201cWe will learn enough to know that it was more like the light than the darkness.\u201d\n\nSo in a word, yes. Offred is alive in The Testaments. But this is Atwood we\u2019re talking about, and nothing is ever as simple as it seems.\n\nWhy is the book called The Testaments?\n\nAtwood has a three-pronged answer to this question, drawing on the structure of the novel \u2014 which is told by three narrators \u2014 and the religious aspects of Gilead. \u201cIt has several different meanings: last will and testament, Old and New Testaments. And what does a witness give? A testimony, but also a testament,\u201d she says. \u201cSo it\u2019s those three: the witness, the will and \u2018I\u2019m telling you the truth.\u2019\u201d\n\nWho are the narrators of The Testaments?\n\nWhen she announced The Testaments, Atwood teased that the new novel is narrated by three women, but she revealed nothing of their identities. Fans who hoped Offred, the narrator of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, might be one of the three will be disappointed. The new book does not drop back into the mind of the woman who first described to us all the horrific customs of Gilead. One of the reasons Atwood waited as long as she did to write a sequel, she tells TIME, was because she felt re-creating Offred\u2019s voice would be impossible. \u201cShe had said her piece, quite thoroughly,\u201d Atwood says. But once she realized she could access Gilead through different characters, she knew she could write a follow-up.\n\nSo who are these women? One of the three narrators is someone readers already know: Aunt Lydia, a notorious villain in the original book. She\u2019s since been brought to life by Ann Dowd in Hulu\u2019s adaptation of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. (TIME recently revealed that Dowd also reads the role in the audiobook edition of The Testaments.) In the new book, Atwood complicates readers\u2019 long-held assumptions about Lydia, who trains women to become handmaids and often adds to their misery with her abusive tactics. To flesh out Lydia\u2019s story, Atwood says she asked herself, \u201cHow do you get to be such a person? How do you act within that structure? What are your fears, what are your goals, when you\u2019re in that position channeling J. Edgar Hoover, who collected dirt on everybody?\u201d\n\nLydia\u2019s narration comprises the meatiest third of The Testaments, the one most revealing of Gilead\u2019s inner workings, because she sees \u2014 and records \u2014 everything. As Atwood points out to TIME, Lydia is a woman of secret yet significant power in the regime. Such women are rare, and dangerously underestimated, in Gilead. Through Lydia\u2019s narration, Atwood allows us access to a mind far more complex, with many more shades of grey, than her original novel let on.\n\nThe second narrator is another person we know from the original, but not nearly as well. Agnes Jemima was too young when Gilead took power to remember what life was like before it. She\u2019s growing up in a nice house with her mother and father, a powerful Commander, and learning the duties she will be expected to uphold as a wife. But when her mother dies, she learns that she once had another mother: a woman now serving as a handmaid. And she has vague memories of running through the woods with an unknown woman as a young child. If it sounds like she might be Offred\u2019s daughter \u2014 the one who was ripped from her arms as she and her husband Luke attempted an escape to Canada \u2014 well, you might be onto something. (More on that later.)\n\nThe third narrator is brand new \u2014 again, sort of. Daisy is a teenager living in Toronto with oddly overprotective parents who run a second-hand clothing store. Gilead is a constant topic of political conversation in her school. Daisy wrote an essay on Baby Nicole, a child who was \u201cstolen\u201d by her handmaid mother and taken to Canada, and is now held up by Gileadeans as a symbol of the evil that exists outside its borders. One day Daisy attends an anti-Gilead rally against her parents\u2019 wishes. The next day, her 16th birthday, they\u2019re dead. And all their friends are acting like Daisy is in danger, too. Soon, they reveal the truth: she is Baby Nicole. Her \u201cparents\u201d were agents of the Mayday resistance, the campaign to overthrow Gilead, who were assigned to protect her.\n\nAre the two young narrators related to Offred?\n\nReaders of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale will remember that when Offred stepped into the van at the end of the novel, she thought she might be pregnant with Nick\u2019s baby. That was, according to Atwood, about 15 years before the action of The Testaments begins. And here is a baby \u2014 Daisy/Nicole \u2014 who was born to a handmaid 16 years ago and smuggled into Canada. Simple math suggests that this teenager could be Offred and Nick\u2019s daughter.\n\nA reasonable reader could then conclude that both of these young narrators \u2014 Daisy/Nicole and Agnes Jemima \u2014 are Offred\u2019s daughters. Which would make them half sisters. And yes, in fact, we do eventually learn that these two share a mother, who was a handmaid.\n\nLet\u2019s call this theory reasonable, rather than certain, because again, Atwood prefers to let readers make up their own minds. Nowhere in The Testaments does it say that Daisy/Nicole and Agnes Jemima\u2019s mother ever went by the name Offred. And the author herself won\u2019t confirm. \u201cWe are pretty sure,\u201d Atwood says. \u201cBut we don\u2019t really know.\u201d Their mother\u2019s namelessness is reminiscent of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, since we never learn Offred\u2019s real name. Her anonymity underscores the point that the horrors Offred suffers could happen to anyone.\n\nBut there\u2019s another layer to this question: While the two books don\u2019t use names, Hulu\u2019s adaptation of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale does. Atwood had everything to do with those names; she works closely with the team behind the show.\n\nUp to this point in Hulu\u2019s series, which has aired three seasons and has been picked up for a fourth, Offred (who is known as June) has two daughters. The elder, Hannah, is from her marriage to Luke before Gilead. She gets taken from her parents, just like in the book, before the events of the first season. Much later, June learns that Hannah has been given a new name in Gilead. June\u2019s second daughter in the show is a baby she has with Nick. And what are these daughters called? Agnes and Nicole. The latter was Atwood\u2019s decision. Bruce Miller, the Handmaid\u2019s Tale showrunner, tells TIME that standing by for Atwood to name the new baby was like awaiting the announcement of a new pope: \u201cI was waiting for white smoke,\u201d he says.\n\nSo, we have Agnes and Nicole as June/Offred\u2019s daughters in the show. And Agnes Jemima and Nicole/Daisy as the children of a handmaid in The Testaments. Which means that if you read the two books and the show together, then yes, the two young narrators of The Testaments are Offred\u2019s daughters. I suggest to Atwood that readers can choose whether they want to include the show in their reading of the two novels. She offers a very on-brand response: \u201cI love choices like that.\u201d\n\nSo wait, what happens to Offred in The Testaments?\n\nThe story is really about Lydia, Daisy/Nicole and Agnes Jemima. But we do learn some things about the girls\u2019 mother. If we conclude that Offred is that person, here are a few essential things about her life after the events of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\n\nFirst, she lives.\n\nSecond \u2014 no surprise \u2014 she\u2019s working with Mayday somewhere in Canada.\n\nThird, she follows the lives of her children from afar and hopes to be reunited with them.\n\nDoes Aunt Lydia turn out to be good?\n\nCritics are already discussing the moral standing of Aunt Lydia, whose motivations prove so much more complex in The Testaments than they seemed in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. Atwood tells TIME that she didn\u2019t think much about Lydia\u2019s reasons for upholding the regime when writing the original novel. But she has tapped a timely nerve with her expansion of the character in The Testaments, probing the fraught territory of women\u2019s complicity in the bad behavior of men and walking a line that leaves room for readers to debate. Atwood won\u2019t be weighing in. \u201cLet Aunt Lydia speak for herself, and make up your own mind,\u201d she says.\n\nHow does The Testaments fit into the world of the Handmaid\u2019s Tale TV show?\n\nThe show is a continuation of Atwood\u2019s original story, set in the world she created, and the author advises on its story through regular conversations with Miller. There are elements in The Testaments that viewers of the show will recognize. But The Testaments picks up years after June\u2019s current life in the show, so while they are closely tied, the stories are completely different. Atwood tells TIME it was important to her to avoid writing a novelization of the Handmaid\u2019s Tale show while also making sure not to introduce contradictions between them. There are a few details that the most vigilant of fans might recognize as different between the new book and the show, but overall they work as companion pieces.\n\nAs for the on-screen future of The Testaments, TIME broke the news that Hulu and MGM are developing the new novel for the screen, working with Miller on determining how best to produce the material. It\u2019s unclear at this stage what form the interwoven stories of Lydia, Daisy/Nicole and Agnes Jemima will take \u2014 whether they will be incorporated into the existing show or produced another way.\n\nWhat do the letters on the windowsill mean?\n\nThis question only makes sense once you\u2019ve read the novel, but it is a tantalizing one. As she did in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, Atwood ends The Testaments with a transcript from a Gileadean studies conference long after the regime has fallen. In it, Professor James Darcy Pieixoto discusses the recently discovered manuscripts that comprise The Testaments and analyzes their contents. He shares that the letters N, A, G, V and AL are carved on a second-floor windowsill in Roosevelt Cottage, which once functioned as a refugee center for escaped Gileadeans, and says Agnes Jemima and Daisy/Nicole may have stayed there for a time. Pieixoto suggests that the letters might have been carved by the half sisters and might be the initials of the central players in their stories: Nicole, Agnes or Ada (a member of the Mayday Resistance), Garth (also Mayday), Victoria (another name Agnes Jemima goes by) and Aunt Lydia. But he points out that we will never know for sure. Atwood, for her part, suggests he\u2019s on the right track. \u201cI think our professor makes a pretty good guess,\u201d she says.\n\nWill Atwood write more Gilead novels?\n\nAtwood\u2019s use of Lydia, Agnes Jemima and Daisy/Nicole to broaden and deepen our understanding of Gilead is effective. If The Handmaid\u2019s Tale was a psychological study \u2014 a claustrophobic look at one woman\u2019s sequesterment and inner life \u2014 The Testaments is the more sociological counterpart. Offred\u2019s reader knew only as much as she did: very little. But the three narrators together offer a fascinating higher-level view of the world Atwood created. It\u2019s easy to imagine that Atwood could add even more perspective on Gilead through the eyes of more characters. And she wrote the book in part because she sees the world as shifting more toward Gilead than away from it, a sentiment unlikely to dissipate in the near future.\n\nBut Atwood isn\u2019t much for discussing her future plans \u2014 she tells TIME that doing so often leads to regret. That said, she also doesn\u2019t say she won\u2019t write more Gilead novels. When I ask her to confirm that she\u2019s not saying no to the possibility, she says, \u201cI never say never.\u201d\n\nWrite to Lucy Feldman at lucy.feldman@time.com.", "description": "Does Offred die?
