This house is not just a fashion label, but a barometer for Britishness. From the stiff upper lip all-weather reliability of the trench coat to the urban swagger of a Burberry check baseball cap, it has come to represent a national identity.\n\nBritish national identity being a fractious business right now, even Riccardo Tisci, a fiercely modernistic designer known for streetwear, indulged in a little nostalgia. His third Burberry collection celebrated the Victorian era as \u201ca time when Britain was going through so much change; but also a time when people in this country were really looking to the future,\u201d Tisci said backstage after the show.\n\nIf the Victorians had worn streetwear, this is how it might have looked. The stage set was stark and futuristic. A carnival-sized sound system of speaker stacks, Stonehenge in scale but sleek and gleaming in glossy Apple Inc white, stood in the centre of the stage of the Troubadour theatre in west London.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Gigi Hadid on the catwalk Burberry show during London fashion week.

Bumbags, the accessory of choice for the millennials Tisci targets, were reinvented here as sleek, wide-leather corset belts. Trenchcoats had cinched waists and grand, floorsweeping hems. Evening dresses were layered and draped with lace and plumed feathers. Polo shirts and mini dresses came with tailcoat-styled hems.\n\nChecking in: Riccardo Tisci on his new era at Burberry Read more\n\n\u201cThe Victorian era is bold, but there is a fragility to it, said Tisci. He noted the aesthetic is very present in London\u2019s Victorian architecture.\n\nUnder Christopher Bailey\u2019s long and successful stewardship, which ended in the spring of 2018, Burberry settled into national treasure status. The clothes on the catwalk were genteel and romantic, the models softly made-up, the soundtrack designed to tug the heartstrings.\n\nBut in the year since he arrived at Burberry, Tisci has referenced punk and rave culture, Bambi and British passports, Carine Roitfeld and Peter Saville. Tisci\u2019s Burberry is more urban, less rural. If the mood of Bailey\u2019s Burberry was soft rain in the Peak district, Tisci\u2019s is closer to Peaky Blinders.\n\nThe Italian designer was a hire nobody in the industry saw coming when he was appointed Bailey\u2019s successor in March 2018. That summer, the house was rocked by environmental outrage when it emerged that it had burnt \u00a328.6m worth of clothes, perfume and accessories to protect its brand.\n\nThis year, boss Marco Gobbetti had a salary increase of 112% to \u00a37.4m, making him the highest paid CEO in the FTSE 100. This year Burberry, in collaboration with Apple, became the first luxury brand to have its own bespoke instant messaging system. Similar to WhatsApp but tailor-made for Burberry, the chat system is designed to foster close relationships between sales associates in stores and their best clients.", "description": "Riccardo Tisci\u2019s third collection for UK\u2019s luxury brand celebrates Victorian era\u2019s boldness and fragility", "authors": ["Jess Cartner-Morley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86c968ddf53e73dda319a51c3ee7b9a0fc24f18e/0_345_5463_3278/master/5463.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6545254d372519c2c73a1b2f68950639", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
