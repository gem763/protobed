He said he has long wanted to see the more than 75-year-old property at Charleston Boulevard and Maryland Parkway revived.\n\nHe hopes to also put restaurants, condominiums or office space on the four-acre parcel to make the venture more profitable.\n\nThe sale needs city approval due to structural and safety issues and the listing of the property since 1993 on the National Register of Historic Places. A City Council vote is scheduled Nov. 6.\n\nThe theater was the city\u2019s first racially integrated movie house. The roof collapsed in July 1995, hours before a concert, but no one was seriously hurt.\n\nThe nonprofit Friends of the Huntridge Theatre operated as a concert venue for several years. It closed in July 2004 and has in recent years been controlled by the family of Eli Mizrachi of Las Vegas.\n\nMizrachi did not respond to requests from the Sun for comment. He said in July that selling the theater was difficult because he wanted the next owner to open it as an arts or entertainment venue.\n\nDapper, founder of Las Vegas-based Dapper Cos., said three key factors made the sale possible: Support from the city, a realistic sale price and a growing interest from investors in downtown properties.\n\n\u201cIf I was doing this without the city\u2019s help, it would never get done,\u201d he said.\n\nCity Councilwoman Olivia Diaz, whose district includes the theater, said she liked what she heard about the deal.\n\n\u201cWe are excited that maybe we\u2019re finally going to be able to make some strides on this property and make it accessible like it once was to the community,\u201d she said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A developer who grew up going to the Huntridge Theater is poised to get city approval to buy the shuttered former movie in central Las Vegas, renovate its damaged roof and convert it to an arts hub.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/26/historic_theater_plans-vegas_23809_c0-125-3000-1875_s1200x700.jpg?5df86175492ddcdc04d9d2b6261257b2d49617ee", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
