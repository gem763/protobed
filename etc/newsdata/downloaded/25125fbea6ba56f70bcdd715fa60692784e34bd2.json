Joe Grogan, a top domestic policy adviser to Trump, called it \u201ca very cordial and productive working session.\u201d\n\nEven in the best of times, a prescription drug bill would be a heavy lift for a divided Congress and the Trump White House. But the talks showed there\u2019s movement, even if the end result remains highly uncertain.\n\nPelosi spokesman Henry Connelly said her top staff provided a briefing on how the California Democrat\u2019s recently introduced drug pricing legislation would work. The bill would authorize Medicare to negotiate prices, require drugmakers to pay rebates if they raise prices more than the inflation rate, and limit seniors\u2019 copays for medicines to $2,000 a year.\n\nOther Democratic leadership aides and top committee staffers also attended the session.\n\nIn addition to Grogan and other White House aides, the administration was represented by budget office staff as well as the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nGrogan said they peppered Pelosi\u2019s staff with detailed questions about how her bill would work. For example, what would it take for Medicare to set up a new office to undertake the complex work of negotiating prices for top tier medications?\n\n\u201cAt the outset we made clear this wasn\u2019t a negotiating session,\u201d said Grogan. \u201cThis was a working session for us to understand how their bill worked.\u201d\n\nMedicare negotiations are a nonstarter for most congressional Republicans, who hew to the belief that private insurers and pharmacy benefit managers should be the ones bargaining on behalf of seniors. But Trump as a presidential candidate had backed Medicare negotiations. Unlike other Republicans, Trump has refrained from publicly criticizing Pelosi\u2019s bill.\n\nFor any legislation to pass, it will have to involve a bipartisan compromise.\n\n\u201cUltimately it is going to be the president\u2019s call what we can embrace or not,\u201d said Grogan.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Even as the impeachment battle rumbled, senior White House and Democratic aides sat down Tuesday to discuss details of drug pricing legislation, officials on both sides said.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/29/texas_pelosi_22523_c0-78-1600-1010_s1770x1032.jpg?f20c1edd51a6cb145b44189aaff76a4f538edc75", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
