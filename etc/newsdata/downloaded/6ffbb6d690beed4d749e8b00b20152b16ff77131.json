His Serpentine summer pavilion of 2014, where Burton first experienced his work, was like an oversized, inhabitable megalith installed in Kensington Gardens \u2013 turf previously occupied by Zaha Hadid, Rem Koolhaas and Frank Gehry.\n\nThe architecture of a store and the fashion it contains, says Radic, \u201chave to be communicating in the same space\u201d.\n\nThe McQueen store is a dialogue of contrasts; the rugged, rocky outcrops and sinuous timber sculptures the architect has incorporated into the interior offsetting the rigorous tailoring for which the brand is renowned. At the entrance, two halves of disparate boulders are stacked one atop the other, like a monolithic cracked egg; a fuzz of vibrant blue fabric oozes out from between them.\n\nA monolithic cracked egg: Chilean architect Smiljan Radic\u2019s neolithic touch at Alexander McQueen.\n\nHard and soft, structured and draped, violently poetic, the store \u2013 the first under Burton\u2019s watch \u2013 incarnates her intimate understanding of the brand established by her her friend and mentor in 1992 with a graduation collection entitled \u201cJack the Ripper Stalks His Victims\u201d.\n\nOn the top floor, accessed by a spiral timber stairway lined with lush, embroidered silk, Burton has created an experiential space, an active atelier where customers (and students) can encounter archival garments, fabric swatches and reference books, as well as see how the new season\u2019s garments have been conceived.\n\nLarge glass cylinders slice through ceilings and floors, creating clear sight lines between the men\u2019s and women\u2019s collections, telescoping the brands history and its future.\n\nStella McCartney\u2019s Old Bond Street flagship echoes her sustainability principles.\n\nElsewhere on Old Bond Street, Stella McCartney\u2019s London flagship has made virtue of her sustainability principles, using leftover cruelty-free fur to line the walls. Meanwhile, Victoria Beckham\u2019s store in Mayfair uses concrete to make the space appear more like a gallery than a boutique, although negotiating the fine line between institutional and retail can be a delicate balance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cA store is not a museum of a brand, it is its daily interface with the customer,\u201d says Pierre Jorge Gonzales of Berlin architectural practice Gonazales Haase AAS, the studio responsible for Balenciaga\u2019s brutally austere boutique on the Rue Saint-Honor\u00e9, Paris. \u201cThe space you design begins with the vision of the new creative director and is oriented towards the future, not the past.\u201d\n\nBalenciaga\u2019s Paris boutique offers brutal austerity (and scary mannequin artworks).\n\nGonzales, who is a scenographer, and his partner, architect Judith Haase, were invited by Balenciaga creative director Demna Gvasalia (who also designs cult label Vetements) to reinterpret the historic Parisian house for a new generation. Scraping back the ornamental plaster interior to reveal the building\u2019s bare 19th-century bones, Gonzales and Haase installed gleaming stainless-steel clothes racks and benches \u2013 part dry cleaner, part abattoir \u2013 upon which to array Gvasalia\u2019s streetwear-inspired fashion.\n\n\u201cOur way of working is to absorb what a designer thinks and stands for, then kind of create a tabula rasa upon which the work can be displayed and understood,\u201d Gonzales says. \u201cWhat you see is what you get; it is what it is. And this is where we connect with the new generation.\u201d The landmark store is \u201can almost elemental backdrop for a constantly changing collection\u201d.\n\nAt a time when e-commerce is turning shopping into a disembodied experience, savvy brands are flaunting a heavy materiality. Celine is mineral, McQueen geological and Balenciaga elemental, and the aesthetic of the new Mulberry store is \u2013 according to its designer Faye Toogood \u2013 \u201cmidway between the Neolithic age and mid-century brutalism\u201d.\n\nMulberry\u2019s classic bag, the Somerset, is one of the most copied in British fashion, and named after the county where the bags have been handmade since 1971. Taking inspiration from the English countryside, Toogood has used contrasting materials, scales and volumes to create a compelling new interior topography.\n\nWalls are poured concrete, the floors moss-green ceramic tiles and motley, heather-hued carpet; display units in cast resin appear to flow like water. Cement pillars are \u201cmenhir-like\u201d, Toogood says, referring to the monumental standing stones revered by the ancient Celts.\n\nThe Mulberry flagship store on Regent Street.\n\n\u201cI wanted the stores to feel more like a welcoming home than a retail environment,\u201d says Toogood, who has also designed interiors for affordable housing in collaboration with Sir David Adjaye. \u201cWe have contrasted soft materials; hand-tufted rugs and velvet button-upholstered furniture with glass, ceramic and concrete. These juxtapositions reflect the contrast of the rural and the urban in contemporary Britain. The store aesthetic is a painterly celebration of the national landscape.\u201d\n\nMulberry creative director Johnny Coca, who studied architecture and then fashion at the prestigious \u00c9cole Boulle in Paris, reckons \u201cbuildings and bags have two elements in common: they must be functional and practical. When these factors are just right, then you\u2019ve made a great bag.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCoca\u2019s brief to Toogood, he says, was to create \u201cimmersive environments with the feel of a home, a place to go and explore the modern British identity of the brand.\n\n\u201cThe contrast between the English countryside, where our factories are located, and the more industrial side of the cities are part of Mulberry\u2019s DNA and needed to be reflected in the store design. Our stores are not a traditional retail environment; they are inspiring spaces that mix influences and references, a place to rejoice, discover, learn and connect.\u201d\n\nVictoria Beckham\u2019s Mayfair store mimics an art gallery.\n\nWith a report by Eventbrite/Harris Group showing that 78 per cent of Millennials prefer to spend their money on experiences over material things, Coca and Toogood \u2013 like most people creating bricks-and-mortar retail today \u2013 have conspired to make \u201can experience beyond the product\u201d.\n\nBut as Pierre Jorge Gonzales puts it: \u201cFirst you need an excellent product; then second, the space should give you something more than a simple \u2018idea\u2019.\u201d", "description": "The powerful synergy between architectural permanence and fashion's flightiness is helping luxury labels tell their stories in a tactile manner.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2048%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_92/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/5dc3e5460496d1d1e0f671c68b367da0e8745cc0", "published_at": "2019-05-10"}
