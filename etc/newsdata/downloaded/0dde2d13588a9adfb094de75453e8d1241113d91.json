EBAY, -7.65% tumbled 8.8% in premarket trading Thursday, putting them on track to open at a 4 1/2-month low, after the e-commerce company's third-quarter results and downbeat revenue outlook prompted Raymond James analyst Aaron Kessler to back away from his bullish view, as the company's 2020 earnings growth guidance was \"materially below\" his estimate. Kessler downgraded eBay to market perform from outperform, but kept his stock price target at $45, saying he believes the stock is now \"fairly valued,\" and are likely to remain \"range-bound\" until 2021. Other than the eBay's downbeat guidance, Kessler is concerned about continued softness in gross merchandise volume (GMV) for both the U.S. and international and slower growth in the company's StubHub and Classifieds businesses. According to FactSet, no less than three of the 35 analysts surveyed have downgraded eBay and 14 analysts cut their price targets, while two analysts raised their targets. SunTrust Robinson Humphrey's Youssef Squali nudged his target up to $40 from $39, saying that while guidance was disappointing and the operating review conclusions were \"underwhelming,\" the strategic review update was a \"modest positive.\" The stock had soared 39.7% year to date through Wednesday, while the S&P 500 SPX, -0.02% has gained 19.9%.", "description": "Shares of eBay Inc. tumbled 8.8% in premarket trading Thursday, putting them on track to open at a 4 1/2-month low, after the e-commerce company's...", "authors": ["Tomi Kilgore", "Reporter"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
