A grab of Jon Snow saying \u201cWe the media, the pundits, the experts know nothing\u201d is surely something Labour is desperately hoping will prove true this time around, given the party is sitting 10 points behind the Conservatives.\n\nJeremy Corbyn (@jeremycorbyn) The General Election has just been called.\n\n\n\nIt's time for real change. pic.twitter.com/aiUwhxm5K6\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get Brexit done,\u201d Boris Johnson begins in the Conservatives\u2019 video. The clip leads with his speech at the Conservative party conference in Manchester earlier this year, before Johnson outlines his party\u2019s promises including \u201cfantastic full fibre broadband, sprouting in every household\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are going to rise and ping off the guy ropes of self doubt and negativity,\u201d says the prime minister in one of his classic flourishes. The video (at time of writing at 33k views) closes with the party\u2019s campaign slogan \u201cGet Brexit done\u201d.\n\nConservatives (@Conservatives) #BackBoris to get Brexit done.\n\n\n\n\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 Only @BorisJohnson can take our country forward and deliver on the people's priorities.#GE2019 pic.twitter.com/3pTkzI6vFy\n\nThe Lib Dems too seem to have hit upon the campaign slogan \u201cBring it on\u201d. The party is yet to launch a campaign video but Jo Swinson posted a campaign meme showing actor Gabrielle Union, in cheerleading regalia, saying \u201cBring it\u201d.\n\nThe meme comes from the cheerleading film Bring It On and it is perhaps unsurprising that Swinson has aligned herself with Union\u2019s character, the leader of the underdog team, the East Compton Clovers, standing up to the wealthy elite, cheating national champions the Toros. Though whether they\u2019ll be able to deliver a victory as the (spoiler alert!) Clovers do is another question.\n\nThe SNP have a very short video (36k views at time of writing) showing the top of Boris Johnson\u2019s head. \u201cTime to choose,\u201d says the voiceover. \u201cScotland\u2019s future in your hands? Or those of Boris Johnson?\u201d before an appeal for people to register to vote.\n\nThe SNP (@theSNP) \ud83d\uddf3 Parliament has voted for a general election. People in Scotland will have a choice, to put Scotland's future in Scotland's hands or in those of Boris Johnson.\n\n\n\n\ud83c\udff4\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc62\udb40\udc73\udb40\udc63\udb40\udc74\udb40\udc7f Register to vote and invite your friends to do the same: https://t.co/7Rfhd84RqK pic.twitter.com/VSKuPJgjUo\n\nAnd the Greens? They\u2019ve got a video (languishing at 19k views at time of writing) that should not be watched by anyone who suffers from motion sickness. It shows Green party leader Jonathan Bartley walking through the streets as he promises \u201cthe biggest Green campaign ever\u201d. It is without the whizzbangery of the larger parties\u2019 videos, but is heartfelt.", "description": "After confirmation the UK will go to the polls on 12 December, the parties have taken their campaigns online", "authors": ["Kate Lyons"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f282115fc56a9488e3ec1d867315b7df99a7d78/259_8_665_399/master/665.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5fbb047066d4467b6554eaa415562424", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
