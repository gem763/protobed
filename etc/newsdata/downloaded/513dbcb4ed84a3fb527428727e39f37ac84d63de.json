USA TODAY\n\nThis month, an invasive northern snakehead fish was found in a pond in Georgia.\n\nThe northern snakehead can grow up to 3 feet long and can breathe air and survive on land. The fish can also compete for food and habitat with native species, putting original populations at risk.\n\nThe state's department of natural resources is encouraging people to immediately kill the fish and freeze it, take a photograph of the fish, note the location where it was found and report it to a regional fishery office.\n\nSnakeheads have also been found in Arkansas, Maryland, New York and Virginia, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\n'Bird emergency': Climate change threatening two-thirds of species in U.S. with extinction, report says\n\nWild boars\n\nInvasive species impact various ecosystems all over the US. From fish to hogs, the US Department of Agriculture defines an invasive species as something who's introduction can cause economic or environmental harm. Take a look at 10 of the most invasive species currently impacting the United States. 1. Wild boar: The wild boar is native to Eurasia, but was originally discovered in the US in the 1500s. These hogs were originally introduced to the US as a food source. Today, they have a large impact on plant growth and often compete with native species. (Photo: Fritz Reiss, AP)\n\nIt's more than just 30 to 50 feral hogs \u2014 these wild boars have been reported in at least 35 states and number around 6 million, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Spanning across the southern United States, from South Carolina to Texas and California, the feral swine put people, crops, property and historic sites at risk.\n\nIn addition to trampling crops, the hogs can pose a danger to man-made areas like golf courses \u2014 in September, a trapping company caught a 411-pound feral hog on a San Antonio golf course.\n\nTo control the wild boars, the USDA recommends that killing the populations may be the most effective long-term approach. In Texas, companies are even offering the public a chance to shoot down pigs from a helicopter to keep the invasive population in check.\n\nSpotted lanternfly\n\nLanternflies are invasive to Pennsylvania and people are encouraged to squash the bugs and report them.

The flying insects are native to China, Bangladesh and Vietnam, and they arrived in the commonwealth in 2014.\n\nNow present in more than a dozen eastern counties, residents are urged to squash the bugs and report them. Spotted lanternflies have spread throughout the Mid-Atlantic, with sightings in Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey and Virginia.\n\nInvasive species: How Floridians, from spearfishers to scientists, are fighting back\n\nGreen iguanas\n\nGreen iguanas are an invasive species that can harm seawalls, sidewalks and plants. (Photo: Michal Rozewski, Getty Images/Hemera)\n\nThis summer, wildlife officials in Florida gave residents the go-ahead to kill green iguanas on private property. The invasive species harmed seawalls, sidewalks and plants.\n\nWeeks later, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission softened its stance and urged residents to seek out professional trappers to dispose of the iguanas wherever possible.\n\nThe iguanas, which originate from Central and South America, are escaped pets or animals who otherwise made their way to south Florida. Numbers have increased since the 1960s due to an increase in human population, which grant the invasive species shelter and food.\n\nPets are at risk too \u2014 a Florida veterinarian told the Sun Sentinel this summer he had treated dozens of dogs for iguana bites or slashes caused by iguana tails.\n\nMore weird animal news: Be on the lookout for 'zombie deer' during Vermont hunting season\n\nAsian carp\n\nCLOSE The state's fish and wildlife department collected the fish to study them for a project to deter the invasive species from entering Lake Barkley. USA TODAY\n\nThe Asian carp is an umbrella term for a number of invasive species of fish, including the bighead, black, grass and silver carp. To stem the spread of the carp around the Great Lakes area and beyond, fishing and edible consumption of the carp is encouraged.\n\nCarp out-compete other fish, lower the water quality and can injure humans in boats when they leap out of the water, according to the National Park Service. Their ability to jump over low barriers, like dams, mean carp can spread quickly and dominate ecosystems.\n\nIf you're out fishing and think you have captured an Asian carp, be sure to properly identify the species, contact regional conservation personnel and preserve the fish if necessary.\n\nBurmese python\n\nFlorida trappers Jonathan Lopez, left, and Cynthia Downer pose with a record-setting python they captured at the Big Cypress National Preserve, west of Miami, Fla. (Photo: Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission via AP)\n\nThese giant snakes prey on native endangered species in south Florida, USDA reports.\n\nEarlier this month, a Florida couple caught an 18-foot, 4-inch Burmese python. The record-breaking haul prevented the female from laying eggs, which would have spawned more pythons that swallow birds and mammals.\n\nOriginally introduced to the U.S. as pets, the snakes are now considered an invasive species and Floridians are allowed to kill Burmese pythons all year long \u2014 no permit or hunting license required.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2019/10/10/invasive-species-encouraged-kill-snakehead-fish-wild-boar-lanternfly/3928673002/", "description": "With news of an air-breathing snakehead fish discovered in Georgia, it begs the question: What other invasive species are people supposed to kill?", "authors": ["Max Cohen", "Published P.M.
