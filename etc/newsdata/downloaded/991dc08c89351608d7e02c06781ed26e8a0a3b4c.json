That subscription payment is an entry ticket of sorts, but does not come with any airtime. Instead, customers who take part can claim back the equivalent of the bank-account fee they pay Standard Bank as \u201cfree\u201d data. How much they pay to subscribe to the deal determines how their data is counted against their account fees; at R49 data is counted at 15c per MB, and for R249 Standard Bank will count each MB at 5c.\n\nFor those without a subscription, data is priced at 49c per MB.\n\nSimilar packages are available for voice.\n\nUnderstanding the implications of that is hard, the ARB said. A customer thinking of using the R149 subscription plan has to divide that fee by R0.49 to figure out they could start to break even on the up-front fee after using 304MB of data \u2013 and would then have to calculate how that benefits them based on their account fee and the 7c per MB that comes with the R149 plan.\n\nIt is reasonable \u2013 and likely \u2013 that consumers would simply look at on offer of R149 for data at 7c per MB, and assume they are buying R149 worth of airtime, the ARB said.\n\n\"In addition, consumers are currently familiar with advertisements by different service providers offering deals and plans in a form of subscription contracts with airtime, data or sms bundles already included in the monthly subscription fee. Consumers might, therefore, combined with the fact that the advertisement is leading with the headlines 'Data Plans' and 'Voice Plans', understand this plan to be similar to those that they are familiar with.\"\n\nStandard Bank had failed to make it clear enough \"that the promoted monthly fees do not carry any airtime credit but only gives the subscribers an opportunity to be charged at a lower rate when using data or voice calls, over and above the plan cost,\" the ARB said.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "An advertising regulator says the complex math needed to understand Standard Bank's data prices could confused buyers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9362/dba6470c40bb44c8bbcf87765bd0c8d8.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
