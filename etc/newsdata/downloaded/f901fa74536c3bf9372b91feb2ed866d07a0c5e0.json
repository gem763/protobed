Earlier this year the U.S. revoked special trade privileges India had enjoyed, with Mr. Trump complaining the country hasn\u2019t opened its markets sufficiently to U.S. goods.\n\nThe U.S. has urged India to ease pricing caps on medical equipment such as coronary stents and implants for knee and hip replacements. Foreign companies that supply many of these products, including U.S. manufacturers, would benefit from the changes.\n\nThe U.S also wants India to reduce tariffs on some electronic goods, telecom gear, mobile handsets and automobiles, besides providing greater access for agricultural produce and dairy products in the Indian market.\n\n\u201cWe have worked threadbare on all of these issues and hope some positive announcement will be made during the prime minister\u2019s visit,\u201d a senior government official said.\n\nForeign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar told a news conference this week that some of the more contentious trade issues between India and the U.S. would be addressed in the near future, hinting at the possibility of a trade deal.\n\nU.S. goods-and-services trade with India totaled an estimated $142.1 billion in 2018, according to data from the U.S. trade representative. Exports were $58.9 billion, while imports $83.2 billion, leading to a trade deficit of $24.2 billion.\n\nIndia and the U.S., despite dramatically broadening their overall ties in the past decade, have seen trade tensions grow in recent months with Mr. Trump speaking out against high Indian tariffs on goods like automobiles, even as he has also touted his close personal rapport with Mr. Modi.\n\nFor example, Mr. Trump has been citing still-high import taxes on Harley-Davidson motorcycles, which the Indian authorities seem to have taken seriously. India may further reduce import duties on a particular category of bikes, which would eventually help Harley-Davidson, the government official said.\n\nFor its part, India is seeking restoration of a trade benefit that the U.S. withdrew in June as well as a rollback of higher tariffs on steel and aluminum products exported to the U.S..\n\nIn the past few months, senior American and Indian officials have met multiple times to discuss the array of trade irritants. At the same time, the two countries have also forged some far-reaching agreements for military and diplomatic cooperation.\n\nIndia\u2019s economy has struggled recently, so Mr. Modi is eager to revive its export prospects into the U.S. market.\n\nMeanwhile, India\u2019s finance ministry announced a series of measures Friday including a cut in corporate tax for domestic companies. It also waived off a tax surcharge on capital gains made from the sale of equity investments, in a step aimed at stabilizing and boosting the capital market. This will also apply to foreign portfolio investors.\n\nAlthough the measures will cost the government an estimated 1.45 trillion Indian rupees ($20.31 billion) a year in lost revenue, according to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Indian authorities hope the steps would resonate with countries like the U.S. and send out a message that the government is capable of taking tough decisions to spur investment.\n\nWhen Prime Minister Modi travels to Texas, the first leg of his U.S. visit, he will be joined by Mr. Trump to address tens of thousands of Indian-Americans on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe symbolism of Modi and Trump addressing a joint rally should not be underestimated. It puts into perspective how significantly India-U.S. ties have grown in the last few years and how important New Delhi is for Washington today, even for a president as mercurial as Donald Trump, \u201d said Harsh Pant, director and head of the strategic studies program at Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation.\n\nMr. Pant said the relationship is sufficiently expansive that issues like trade and India\u2019s recent controversial decision to revoke the limited autonomy that its Jammu and Kashmir state enjoyed aren\u2019t likely to disrupt it.\n\n\u201cEnergy and defense issues are being leveraged by India, and thorny trade issues would find some resolution,\u201d Mr. Pant said.\n\nMr. Modi will also participate in several programs of the United Nations General Assembly in New York City.\n\nWrite to Rajesh Roy at rajesh.roy@wsj.com", "description": "India may loosen restrictions impeding U.S. goods as Prime Minister Narendra Modi heads to the U.S. for a week in an effort to damp simmering trade tensions and\u00a0garner fresh investment into its flagging economy.", "authors": ["Rajesh Roy", "Rajesh.Roy Dowjones.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109131/social", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
