In sharp contrast with fast-moving storms that pass within an hour or two, some parts of the Bahamas, including the Abaco Islands and Grand Bahama Island, were witnessing more than 36 hours of brutal conditions. As the storm virtually stalled, the strike on northern Bahamas was dragging into Tuesday. Few places on the planet have experienced storm conditions as horrifically lengthy.\n\n\u201cThe Bahamas is presently at war and being attacked by Hurricane Dorian,\u201d Minnis said in an interview. \u201cAnd yet, it has no weapon at its disposal to defend itself during such an assault by this enemy.\u201d\n\nDorian hit the Bahamas with the highest intensity, Category 5. It has since weakened slightly to a 145-mph Category 4 as it inched offshore, though it made little difference in terms of the severe storm surge and wind damage it was inflicting.\n\nIn the storm\u2019s direct wake were flooded neighborhoods, debris fields and broad destruction. Minnis said the five confirmed deaths happened on the Abacos Islands. The airport in Freeport \u2014 the nation\u2019s second-largest city \u2014 turned into a river of rushing tidewaters.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard was deploying helicopters to evacuate the injured from the Marsh Harbour clinic on devastated Great Abaco, flying them back to Nassau for urgent care. But government officials warned that rescue efforts were largely suspended until conditions improve, leaving desperate, stranded residents on their own.\n\n\n\nMap of some of the areas hit by Hurricane Dorian. (Shelly Tan/The Washington Post)\n\nTidal surges from the storm were projected to reach up to 23 feet above normal levels, overwhelming low-lying cays and islands. Severe flooding and power and phone outages extended beyond the worst of the strike zone, as far south as the capital, Nassau. Unconfirmed reports of deaths emerged on Abaco Islands \u2014 reports that authorities said they were still struggling to confirm.\n\n\u201cBut we fear that there could be truth to these stories based on reports from family,\u201d said Duane Sands, the Bahamian health minister. \u201cUntil we are able to assess all the areas ravaged, we are unable to confirm these reports.\u201d\n\n[\u2018Catastrophic\u2019 Hurricane Dorian blasting Bahamas and bearing down on Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas]\n\nStorm-weary Bahamians are no strangers to the ravaging force of hurricanes, having suffered a series of strikes in recent years. But the extent and dragged-out nature of Dorian\u2019s ferocity stunned residents, leading to a proliferation of life-threatening situations.\n\nSevere storm surges covered cabanas and ripped apart docks in Queens Cove on Grand Bahama, one of the government\u2019s targeted evacuation zones. In video footage sent to The Washington Post, water had broken through the hurricane-resistant windows of resident Lena Chandler\u2019s home. The first floor was flooded to within a few feet of the ceiling, even as water had begun rising along the staircase, approaching the second floor, where she was sheltering.\n\n\u201cOutside is now inside,\u201d said Chandler, a 48-year-old alarm company owner.\n\nAsked why she did not follow evacuation orders for the area, Chandler said that, like others, she had not anticipated such devastation on the island.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t know,\u201d she said.\n\nThe massive storm surge turned streets into rushing rivers, the tops of palms poking out, their fronds bending in the extreme wind and rain. On Twitter, Freeport resident LaToy Williams posted video of water more than six feet deep submerging his front porch and lapping at his windows.\n\n\u201cGod be with us, God be with us, God be with us,\u201d he says. \u201cYa\u2019ll keep praying out there, worldwide.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now, we are getting lashed with strong winds and heavy rains,\u201d said Lisa Pakosh, a Freeport resident. \u201cCell service is sporadic, but I have been in contact with friends over the bridge whose home flooded, and they are stuck with their young daughter on their countertops. Other friends have retreated to their second floor, as water has filled their main floor.\u201d\n\n[Hurricane Dorian has smashed all sorts of intensity records in the Atlantic Ocean]\n\nJamie Rose, 44, a Grand Bahama resident, said he had been in contact with his parents, who live in a lower-lying part of the island.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to keep themselves alive,\u201d Rose said.\n\n\u201cTheir house is built about 12 feet above high tide, and the water is now about two feet above the level of their windows in the living room,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hurricane glass, but they\u2019re basically sitting in a fish tank looking out at the water hitting the windows.\u201d\n\nAlso in Freeport, Gail Woon, 60, an environmentalist, sat in a crowded hurricane shelter. Flashbacks from previous hurricanes, she said, were haunting her.\n\n\u201cThis is terrible. These climate change hurricanes are terrible,\u201d Woon said.\n\n\u201cLiterally, a family of 10 just walked in and braved the storm to get here. They just came into the shelter. They are wet, and they look pretty scared.\u201d\n\n[Incredible views of Dorian near peak strength]\n\nStories of destruction and devastation emerged from the Abaco Islands, where Dorian made landfall Sunday and which was still feeling the storm\u2019s fury a day later. Social media images showed patches of land, homes and buildings entirely submerged. In other images, homes appeared ripped off their foundations by a storm that could feel like a massive tornado.\n\nGertha Joseph, 35, a single mother of a 4-month-old son, issued a public cry for help Sunday after Dorian tore the roof off her apartment building, blasted out windows and turned furniture into kindling on the hard-hit island of Grand Abaco. In a live video posted Sunday on Facebook, she begged for assistance, for those listening to \u201cpray for Abaco.\u201d\n\nNeighbors, she said, had tried to swim across the rushing waters to a cluster of houses.\n\n\u201cBut the water just took them,\u201d she said in the video. \u201cSome people, they didn\u2019t get to make it.\u201d\n\n\u201cPray for us, pray for us, me and my baby, everyone who stayed in the apartment building, we stayed right here, please pray for us, pray for Abaco,\u201d she sobs. \u201cI\u2019m begging you, pray for us.\u201d\n\nReached by phone, its battery dying and no way to charge it in a blackout, she said she and her son had managed to get out of her flooding building with the aid of a man who helped them across the rushing waters on a piece of plastic. But even as she spoke, she said Dorian was peeling off the roof of the house in which she was sheltering.\n\n\u201cOh my God,\u201d she shrieked into the phone. \u201cI see the light on the roof.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cOh my God. What we gonna do? Please tell me what we gonna do?\u201d\n\nThe connection dropped. Further attempts to reach her via phone proved unsuccessful.\n\nAid organizations and emergency responders from Miami-Dade County and elsewhere in the United States were making preparations to set up relief operations on the hardest-hit Bahamian islands as soon as conditions allowed.\n\nFaiola reported from Miami.\n\nRead more\n\nAirlines, rail and highway agencies plan for disruptions\n\nLessons of the past inform care for elderly residents as Dorian approaches Florida\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Officials warned that rescue efforts were being suspended because of the hurricane\u2019s severity.", "authors": ["Jasper Ward", "Anthony Faiola", "Correspondent Covering Latin America", "Venezuela", "Argentina", "Brazil", "Human Rights", "Poverty", "Globalization", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/9J_lvw4ir8y2BXAMXQ1tKrmPExc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6R4F73WNRMI6TMU3UUUNZAQVJI.jpg"}
