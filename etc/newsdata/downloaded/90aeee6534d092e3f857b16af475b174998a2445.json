The first four episodes of season 10 are proof that it can.\n\nAs noted by Forbes, not only did the series manage to keep this momentum going, but it managed to become one of the best series on TV right now.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the latest news!

TV Shows\n\nRick Grimes' departure helped 'TWD' get back on its feet\n\nWhen I first heard about Rick Grimes leaving the show early in season 9, I thought it would put a final nail in \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d coffin. After all, Rick was the leader in every sense of the word, and he even managed to carry the show through its worst times (seasons 6 through 8.)\n\nHowever, Rick leaving turned out perfectly for the show itself.\n\nAnd it also managed to expand \"The Walking Dead\" universe as there are three Rick Grimes movies planned.\n\nAs noted by Paul Tassi from Forbes, Rick\u2019s departure has been surprisingly freeing for the show as it now became more decentralized, able to focus on other characters as well.\n\nDaryl is no longer grunting and is actually back to having meaningful conversations with people around him. Negan has become a character that we can actually sympathize with.\n\nSiddiq, Eugene, Aaron, and even the new guys Connie, Magna, Luke have all become characters we care about.\n\nThe Whisperers, on the other way, have grown into the show\u2019s most terrifying villains, and the best of them is yet to come. The two groups are in the middle of a cold war at the moment, but things are about to get very serious very quickly.\n\nAll in all, if you\u2019ve given up on the Walking Dead, it\u2019s time to tune in again, you won\u2019t regret it.", "description": "Episode after episode, 'TWD' proves that it is yet again one of the best and most overlooked shows on TV right now.", "authors": ["Music Crowns", "Ramon Sanchez", "Asmir Pekmic", "Read More On The Same Topic Milos Kitanovic", "Hbo Gives 'Game Of Thrones' Targaryen Prequel Full Series Order", "Hbo Has Canceled 'The Long Night' Prequel", "Game Of Thrones", "Creators David Benioff", "Db Weiss Quit 'Star Wars' Trilogy"], "top_image": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2019/10/28/os/b_1200x630/michonne-in-the-walking-dead-season-10-image-source-daryl-dixon-youtube_2345899.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
