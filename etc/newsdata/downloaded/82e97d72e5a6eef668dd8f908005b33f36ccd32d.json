According to TMZ, the couple had been trying to make things work for a while, but decided to take a break a few weeks ago.\n\nSources told TMZ that Jenner and Scott haven\u2019t been seen together in public since the premiere of his documentary, \u201cLook Mom, I Can Fly,\u201d in late August. Jenner has also not posted about Scott on her social media accounts since September 10. He was also not at the second wedding of Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin in South Carolina this past weekend, which Jenner attended with her sister, Kendall. TMZ also reports that this isn\u2019t the first time the couple have decided to give their relationship a break.\n\nJenner began dating Scott after meeting him at Coachella in 2017, shortly after she split with Tyga. Ten months after their desert festival meet-cute, Jenner gave birth to their daughter, Stormi, in February 2018. This past year, the couple have battled rumors of Scott\u2019s infidelity, but the rapper put an end to the speculation after \u201cstrongly denying\u201d to People that he cheated on Jenner, and their relationship seemed to prevail. In February, Jenner even kicked off rumors she was pregnant with their second child after posting an affectionate photo of herself and Scott, with a teasing caption that read, \u201cbaby #2?\u201d\n\nScott also recently photographed Jenner for her Playboy cover, but a sexy collaboration like that, or even an over-the-top romantic gesture, seems to be no match for the trials and tribulations of young love.\n\nStay in touch.
