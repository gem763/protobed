(Photo: Spotify)\n\nSpotify wants to hook your kids on music at an early age. And the Swedish company is doing so by launching a tailored Spotify Kids app on Wednesday, initially in beta and only in Ireland. Though make no mistake, Spotify has designs on spreading the service to other global markets, including the U.S.\n\nNo timetable was given.\n\nThe new iOS and Android app, targeted to kids as young as 3 years on up to approaching the teenage years, will be populated with just around 6,000 pieces of content curated by \u201cexpert\u201d human editors, mostly music but also age-appropriate stories.\n\nThe number of tracks is expected to grow but for now, represents a teeny-tiny subset of material when you consider Spotify has more than 50 million tracks in its catalog. But the kid-approved content does include such name artists as Taylor Swift, Ariane Grande, Ed Sheeran and Bruno Mars, as well as partners such as Disney, Nickelodeon, Discovery Kids and Hasbro. Only sanitized versions of such performer's songs will be in the mix.\n\nSpotify says the product is the output of two years of research. Along the way, Spotify consulted with child advocacy groups.\n\nThis \u201cplayground of sound,\u201d as Spotify describes it, will come at no extra cost to subscribers under Spotify\u2019s Premium Family plan, currently $14.99 in both the U.S. and Ireland, for up to six family members living under the same roof.\n\nToo much YouTube? Online video usage among teens is going through the roof, survey says\n\nMaintaining privacy\n\nSpotify stressed that the app is ad-free, complies with European and U.S. privacy regulations and that the company would not be sharing or selling data to third parties.\n\nSpotify says it does collect encrypted data related to what\u2019s playing to help personalize the experience for the listener; parents can request that such data be deleted.\n\nDuring sign-up, parents must give their explicit consent and, through parental controls, can determine when the kid can listen. Entering the child\u2019s birthdate is also optional. If parents choose to do so, the kid will get an acknowledgment on the day.\n\nKids can choose an avatar inside Spotify Kids. (Photo: Spotify)\n\nFor now, though, Mom and Dad cannot choose the artists within the app that the kids can listen to or not; that\u2019s coming later. Meanwhile, the kids themselves can choose among a dozen customized characters or avatars, the only element within the experience they can change on their own.\n\nEach market will have 80 pre-made playlists, some tailored to locals, thus playlists out of the gate are titled Irish Lads and Top Hits Ireland.\n\nThe only playlist that can be customized (and accessed offline) is a collection of songs the kid picks as favorites. Kids who can read and write will be able to search for tunes within the app; obviously, caregivers can also type in the names of songs or artists who are among the approved handpicked catalog.\n\nThe Internet at 50: The first online message? It was a typo\n\nOne thing parents cannot do initially is add any of the songs they approve of in the larger Spotify universe to the kids\u2019 app, though such a feature is on the roadmap. If you\u2019re listening as a family a parent can toggle back and forth from their own Spotify app to the kid\u2019s version.\n\nAnd, no, parents can't remotely peek in on the session the kids are listening to, though they can turn off access to the app remotely.\n\nFinding the right content by age\n\nGiven such a broad age range, Spotify has established two separate experiences parents can pick for their kids, though the available content is the same for both. A tab for younger children surfaces nursery rhymes, lullabies and bedtime stories and includes simpler shapes, softer colors and easily recognizable symbols. Older kids are exposed to brighter colors, more dynamic imagery and age-appropriate pop music.\n\nThough I haven\u2019t been able to test the app at this early stage, I think as a parent I\u2019d like to see even more granular age controls, given the wide range in maturity levels among kids.\n\nPlaylists will generally span a variety of content categories, including Movies & TV, Top Hits, and Seasonal.\n\nOne playlist for the smaller children is called \u201cSilly Songs for Kids\u201d with such selections as \u201cFruit Salad\u201d from The Wiggles, \u201cHakuna Matata\u201d from \u201cThe Lion King\u201d cast members, and \u201cMr Butt\u201d from Regurgitator\u2019s Pogogo Show.\n\nA \u201cGirl Power\u201d playlist for older kids includes \u201cHigh Horse\u201d from Kacey Musgraves or \u201cMan! I Feel Like a Woman!\u201d from Shania Twain.\n\nSpotify now reports 248 million active monthly users and 113 million subscribers. Through Spotify Kids, the company is counting on the next generation to make those numbers well.\n\nHow do you feel about giving kids access to a music service from Spotify dedicated to the youngsters?
