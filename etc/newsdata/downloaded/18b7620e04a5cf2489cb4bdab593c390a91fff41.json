They were cigarette burns from when he fell asleep, a lit butt dropping softly out of the ashtray onto the table where it scarred the wood before burning out. My dad smoked Pall Malls\u2014and for period of time, More, those long, thin, dark brown cigarettes that were advertised to women. He smoked a couple of packs a day for decades. His aunts and uncles had smoked more than that, and for those of us of a certain generation, our childhood was filled with cigarette smoke (you\u2019ll find ashtrays on living room tables and backyard decks in our family photo albums). I recall the haze of the smoking car on commuter trains, and it wasn\u2019t uncommon to see someone brazen enough to smoke in a subway car, never mind airplanes, movie theaters, and sports arenas.\n\nI wasn't especially interested in smoking myself\u2014a first attempt in second grade convinced me there wasn't anything so special about it\u2014but when I saw my svelte uncle from Belgium roll his own, I was fascinated with the ceremony of cigarettes. There was something about the whole affair that made you more of a grown up.\n\nAlmost every cartoon character I doodled had a cigarette dangling from his or her lips\u2014like Lucky Luke, one of Belgium's most popular comics of the time. Once I got a little older, the idea of cigarette case\u2014even if you kept gum in there like Michael Keaton did in Johnny Dangerously\u2014proved an irresistible affectation.", "description": "No one denies that cigarette smoking is a noxious habit, but not so long ago they were so much more.
