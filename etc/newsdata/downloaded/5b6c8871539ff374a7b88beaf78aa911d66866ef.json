The 259 stops this year included 220 overnight stays.\n\nSince October 2017, records show 917 purchases at the airport worth a total of $17.2 million.\n\nDuring the March 2019 stopover, the Air Force placed the crew at the Trump property after a local agent on contract with the United States government had \u201cindicated that there wasn\u2019t a room available closer,\u201d the Air Force statement said. The Trump property charged the Air Force $136 per room, which the Air Force said was less expensive than a Marriott property, which had a rate of $161, and both were under the allowable maximum of $166.\n\nAir Force officials have not yet said, in response to a question from The New York Times, if personnel were placed at the Trump Turnberry resort more than once.\n\nBut asked on Sunday if Mr. Trump\u2019s election in 2016 played any role in the decision to use the Prestwick airport more frequently, Mr. Thomas, the Air Force spokesman, said in a written statement, \u201cNot that I am aware of.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, shortly after the Trump Organization bought the Turnberry golf course, Mr. Trump met with officials at Prestwick airport and agreed to work with them to help increase traffic at the airport, which has struggled financially because of a decline in passenger traffic. The agreement at the time included a plan to offer transportation from the airport to the Trump golf resort. Discounts have also been offered on rooms at the hotel to military personnel.\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled to be partnering with Glasgow Prestwick Airport,\u201d Mr. Trump said during the visit to Prestwick. \u201cThey have a tremendous facility with a unique, rich history.\u201d", "description": "The Air Force conceded that the decision to place a crew at the luxury resort this year \u201cmight be allowable but not advisable.\u201d", "authors": ["Eric Lipton"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/08/us/politics/08dc-hotel1/08dc-hotel1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
