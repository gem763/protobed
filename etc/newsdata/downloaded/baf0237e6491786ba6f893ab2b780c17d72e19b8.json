The result is that your lungs stop working and breathing becomes difficult.\n\nThose affected used a number of different devices from vaporisers to smaller e-cigarettes and a variety of different brands of liquids and cartridges.\n\nThe FDA has now collected over 120 samples to test for different chemicals, including nicotine, cannabinoids, additives and pesticides.\n\nWhat's to blame?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Vaping is seen as safer than smoking because lower levels of the harmful chemicals found in tobacco smoke are produced\n\nHealth investigators in the US are trying to establish whether a particular toxin or substance is behind the outbreak, or whether it's the result of heavy usage.\n\nOne of the theories is that a bad ingredient could have been added to vaping liquids including marijuana products - which are legally available in some US states - namely Vitamin E.\n\nLast week, the New York State health department started investigating Vitamin E, calling it a \"key focus\" of their studies after 34 people became ill in the state.\n\nHowever, the FDA have not settled on Vitamin E as the cause and won't rule out other vaping liquid chemicals.\n\nThis includes mixtures containing glycerol oils, which are suspended in vaping flavours.\n\nThere is also suspicion about \"thickeners\" that have been added to vaping liquids used in e-cigarettes and vaporisers.\n\nIs this a new phenomenon?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption A man died in the US last year after his vape pen blew up\n\nThis is not the first time vaping has given cause for concern. The British Medical Journal published a report last year of a woman who was hospitalised with a cough, fever, night sweats and respiratory failure.\n\nThey found the cause of her problem was a vegetable glycerine found in her e-cigarette, but reported she refused to give it up at the time.\n\nAs well as being linked to lung problems, there have also been reports of vape pens exploding - in rare cases with fatal consequences.\n\nEarlier this year, a 24-year-old man from Texas died when his vape pen's battery blew up sending shards of metal into his face and neck and severing an artery.\n\nHowever, as Public Health England point out, in the UK there are stricter regulations on vaping devices, with their safety and quality checked, meaning this would be a lot less likely to happen.\n\nAnother problem is that e-cigarettes and vapes are fairly new products so doctors don't know what advice to offer says the chair of the American Academy of Paediatrics tobacco control section, Susan Walley.\n\nThe advice in the meantime from American health professionals has been to avoid vaping altogether while investigations take place.\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.", "description": "A nationwide epidemic of lung illnesses has included 450 reported cases and at least five deaths.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/D073/production/_108736335_gettyimages-836357654.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
