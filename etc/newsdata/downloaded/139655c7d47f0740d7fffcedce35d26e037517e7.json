Demonstrations sparked by spending cuts linked to an IMF loan have led to violent clashes over the week.\n\nAfter seven consecutive days, the expression of discontent has burgeoned into a general strike. \u201cThis is absolute chaos,\u201d said RT correspondent Nicolas O\u2019Donovan, reporting from outside the presidential palace, where \u201cthe air is heavy with tear gas [and] smoke.\u201d\n\nThough President Lenin Moreno had reportedly fled south to the city of Guayaquil earlier this week, where he relocated the seat of Ecuador\u2019s government, O\u2019Donovan said the president had returned to Quito to \u201cmonitor the situation on the ground\u201d from an undisclosed location.\n\nThat situation has been one of \u201cextreme tension,\u201d O\u2019Donovan said, with protesters equipping themselves with bricks, stones and even petrol bombs against a heavily armed police force guarding the palace. The officers responded with clubs, stun grenades and copious amounts of tear gas.\n\nAlso on rt.com Ecuador protesters storm parliament building amid chaotic street demonstrations (PHOTOS, VIDEOS)\n\nThe Red Cross has suspended all activities in the capital city over safety concerns, including ambulance services, with teams of volunteers providing improvised treatment to dozens of protesters injured in the clashes.\n\nThe demonstrators, many hailing from poor and indigenous communities around the country, reportedly plan to remain outside the palace until dusk, though O\u2019Donovan said some will stay overnight, defying a curfew order issued earlier this week. They hope the days of rage will convince the government to come to the table for a dialogue and ultimately reverse the austerity measures, namely the elimination of fuel subsidies.\n\nAlso on rt.com Too hungry for power, too inept to rule: Moreno & his neoliberalism are behind Ecuador\u2019s turmoil, ex-president Correa tells RT\n\n\u201cThe people here say that the government is going to save the banks and big business instead of the people, and that\u2019s why all these people are here protesting,\u201d O\u2019Donovan said.\n\nPresident Moreno has remained defiant in the face of the strike, insisting he will not back down from the recent economic reforms, though his aides confirmed they were participating in preliminary talks with the protest leaders, mediated by the United Nations and the Catholic Church.\n\nLike this story?
