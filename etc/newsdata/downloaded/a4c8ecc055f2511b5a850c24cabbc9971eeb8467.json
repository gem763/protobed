At the time, some had suspected that Google may want to reserve Daydream support for its higher-end phones. But now, Daydream is effectively being phased out; not a single phone released in 2019 supports the platform.\n\n\u201cWe saw a lot of potential in smartphone VR\u2014being able to use the smartphone you carry with you everywhere to power an immersive on-the-go experience,\u201d Google\u2019s spokesperson explained. \u201cBut over time we noticed some clear limitations constraining smartphone VR from being a viable long-term solution. Most notably, asking people to put their phone in a headset and lose access to the apps they use throughout the day causes immense friction.\u201d\n\nGoogle launched Daydream in 2016 as the company\u2019s answer to Samsung\u2019s Gear VR headset. It allowed consumers to access VR simply by putting their phone into the cloth-covered Daydream viewer. However, support for Daydream had always been limited to just a few phones, including Google\u2019s own Pixel phones. Without support from key industry players, usage remained low.\n\nLimited engagement and a small addressable audience also led a number of publishers to pull back support from Daydream. HBO discontinued its Daydream apps earlier this year, and Hulu dropped support for Daydream over the summer. And in June, Google itself discontinued Google Play Movies for Daydream.\n\nGoogle\u2019s phase-out of Daydream is just the latest retreat from VR for the company. Earlier this year, the company shut down its Jump cloud-based stitching service for 360-degree video footage. A VR camera jointly developed by Google and Imax never saw the light of day, and the company\u2019s VR180 video format seems to be stalling, with key hardware partners dropping out.\n\nInternally, Google has refocused much of its resources on augmented reality, something that Google\u2019s spokesperson also stressed in the statement provided to Variety Tuesday: \u201cWe\u2019re investing heavily in helpful AR experiences like Google Lens, AR walking navigation in Maps, and AR in Search that use the smartphone camera to bridge the digital and physical worlds, helping people do more with what they see and learn about the world around them.\u201d\n\nIn addition to introducing the new Pixel 4, Google also used its event Tuesday to announce a new Nest Mini speaker, unveil its latest Wifi router system, and announce a launch date for its Stadia game streaming service.\n\nBest of Variety\n\nSign up for Variety\u2019s Newsletter.
