And Blizzard, the developer and publisher of Hearthstone, quickly responded with blanket punishments for everyone involved. It\u2019s the latest example of an American company caught between business interests in China and western-world freedom of speech.\n\nOutrage over Blizzard\u2019s reaction swiftly came from players, industry titans and politicians. It also came at a time when international attention on the protests and wariness over China\u2019s response to it has grown. Eventually, Blizzard reduced the punishment, but it doesn\u2019t seem like the negative fan sentiment will disappear any time soon\u2014especially after the video game giant disciplined another group for supporting Hong Kong.\n\nDuring a Hearthstone championship match stream on Oct. 8, the day Blizzard announced its ruling on Blitzchung, three American University esports players raised a sign that read \u201cFree Hong Kong. Boycott Blizz.\u201d\n\nBlizzard told CNN that it had banned the three students for six months from esports tournament play for \u201cknowingly breaking the rules.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about the Blitzchung, Blizzard and the Hong Kong protests:\n\nWho is Blitzchung?\n\nBlitzchung is a professional esports player of the online collectible card game Hearthstone, who hails from Hong Kong. He has played in multiple tournaments and according to the Hearthstone esports player profile, he is currently ranked seventh in the Hearthstone Grandmasters for the Asia-Pacific region in the second season of 2019.\n\nAccording to Liquipedia, he has earned more than $20,000 playing in various games and tournaments connected to the game.\n\nWhy did Blizzard punish Blitzchung?\n\nOn Oct. 6, Blitzchung appeared on the official Taiwan Hearthstone stream after the Grandmasters second season of 2019 ended. During an interview with two streamers, Blitzchung put on a ski mask and gas mask, similar to ones worn by Hong Kong protesters to protect themselves from tear gas and banned by the government earlier this month.\n\nThe streamers, apparently aware of Blitzchung\u2019s motivations, ducked down to hide their faces. For his part, Blitzchung reportedly said in Chinese, \u201cLiberate Hong Kong. Revolution of our age.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to Inven Global later on Oct. 6, Blitzchung defended his message on the stream.\n\n\u201cAs you know there are serious protests in my country now. My call on stream was just another form of participation of the protest that I wish to grab more attention,\u201d his statement read. \u201cI put so much effort in that social movement in the past few months, that I sometimes couldn\u2019t focus on preparing my Grandmaster match. I know what my action on stream means. It could cause me lot of trouble, even my personal safety in real life. But I think it\u2019s my duty to say something about the issue.\u201d\n\nTwo days later, Blizzard issued a \u201cruling\u201d that Blitzchung\u2019s message on the stream violated a section of the Grandmasters\u2019 rules that states players would refrain from \u201cEngaging in any act that, in Blizzard\u2019s sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cGrandmasters is the highest tier of Hearthstone Esports and we take tournament rule violations very seriously,\u201d the ruling stated.\n\nBlizzard punished Blitzchung by taking away any prize money he won in the Grandmasters second 2019 season and banned him from playing in Hearthstone esports professionally for a year.\n\nIn the ruling, Blizzard also said it would cut ties with the two streamers who attempted to hide themselves from Blitzchung\u2019s actions, saying \u201cWe will also immediately cease working with both casters.\u201d", "description": "Outrage over Blizzard\u2019s reaction swiftly came from players, industry titans and politicians", "authors": ["Peter Allen Clark"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cVWNfzxBqIrgG4u_1suGiw--~B/aD0xMDAxO3c9MTAyNDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/9e55bc718e5dba46ab06dfbeb9bccd9f", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
