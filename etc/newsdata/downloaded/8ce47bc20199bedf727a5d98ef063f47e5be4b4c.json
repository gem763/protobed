By Monday, the heat shifted into Queensland.\n\nGatton, located to the west of Brisbane, came within one degree of the October record with a top temperature of 40.9C.\n\nSevere to extreme fire danger ratings are forecast across parts of central and southern Queensland into NSW over the next few days.\n\nHowever, there is some cooler weather on the way for the eastern parts of Australia.\n\nBrisbane is expected to cool down from 36C on Tuesday to somewhere near the October average temperature of 27C.\n\nThat temperature could fall to around 22C by Saturday with welcome onshore showers forecast from Sydney to Townsville by the weekend.", "description": "Drought, early season heat and blustery winds set off blazes in Queensland and New South Wales.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/9/695a3dcc3699470ebd3dbede15945171_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
