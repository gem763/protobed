The boy's mother told WKBN that a slow-moving caterpillar stung her son after he picked it up and carried it around.\n\nThe bug fell on to the first-grader's shirt, leaving little prickly hairs behind that caused a rash on his stomach. The mother took her son to the emergency room and he was prescribed an ointment, which did not immediately work. The boy eventually recovered but still had a rash and scaring bumps.\n\nThe creature is capable of severe stings. The caterpillars' white or yellow hairs are connected to poisonous sacks and could be used to inject toxins, WKBN reported.", "description": "These hairy caterpillars may seem cute and harmless \u2013 but they can cause severe stings", "authors": ["Caitlin O'Kane"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/09/1e8a270d-f2c8-42d9-9709-caf263b7d5ea/thumbnail/1200x630/4e5df50debba3f89a68f4907790eccbd/71531911-2255649804556822-1924901533435035648-n.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
