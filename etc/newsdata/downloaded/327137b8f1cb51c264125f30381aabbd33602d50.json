It was, however, a different story backstage as ex-couple Neil and Katya Jones exchanged harsh words with each other.\n\nIt is said that what triggered the backstage spat was Katya\u2019s comment to \u201cStrictly\u201d host Claudia Winkleman saying that she had \u201cnever been better.\u201d This made the atmosphere on stage awkward.\n\nNeil, who was just standing a few meters away behind her, had to force a smile, reports The Sun. Winkleman, meanwhile, laughed and remarked that she did not believe her.\n\nOnce the film crew started packing up, Neil approached Katya right away and a source told The Sun he said he did not appreciate the comment. He felt that it was an insult hurled at him on Live television. But, she denied that the line had anything to do with him.\n\nNeil-Katya divorce\n\nBefore the current \u201cStrictly\u201d season started, the couple announced that they were divorcing. This followed months of speculation as to the status of their relationship. Paparazzi took a photo of Katya last year kissing her then-\u201cStrictly\u201d dance partner, comedian Seann Walsh, in a London street.\n\nThe two dancers have been together for 11 years, six of which were spent as a married couple.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the latest news!

TV Shows\n\nWhile there was speculation as to Walsh\u2019s involvement, the couple explained that the marriage had started becoming more like a friendship instead of a romance, hence the divorce.\n\nThe two dancers were adamant about making sure that their professional relationship will remain intact. They assured fans that there won\u2019t be too much in-show drama that will start because of their split. In fact, Neil even said that he was looking forward to working together on the show, according to The Telegraph.\n\nKatya, for her part, also signed up to design some of the costumes Neil will wear on his solo tour Gingerland.\n\nWhen the paparazzi photos leaked last year, Katya and Seann became another example of the \u201cStrictly curse.\u201d It is said that the \u201ccurse\u201d happens when a contestant leaves their current relationships or marriages as a result of being part of the show. Back then, Seann had been dating actress Rebecca Humphries.\n\nBoth Katya and Seann issued apologies on their respective Twitter accounts after the news broke.\n\nIt can be recalled that earlier this year, Neil still defended Katya from detractors. He even said that people were overreacting too much on the kiss.\n\nTheir relationship\n\nNeil and Katya met each other in 2008 during a Blackpool dance tournament. They were forced to work with each other as partners. They started dating soon after.\n\nThey married in 2013 and became part of the popular dance competition show\u2019s lineup in 2016.\n\nTwo weeks before the split was announced, the couple actually celebrated their sixth anniversary. Neil and Katya even posted photos of them together on their Instagram accounts to mark the date.", "description": "Neil, who was just standing a few meters away behind her, had to force a smile as she said she's never been better.", "authors": ["Music Crowns", "Ramon Sanchez", "Cheryl Preston", "Read More On The Same Topic Ramon Sanchez", "Day Fianc\u00e9'", "Caesar S Return Seems Likely", "Possibly Under An Nda", "Day Fiance'", "Tim Proposes To Jeniffer", "Darcey Blames Sister For Relationship Woes"], "top_image": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2019/10/8/os/b_1200x630/strictly-come-dancing-ex-couple-katya-neil-jones-trade-spats-after-live-tv-commentimage-creditbbc-strictly-come-dancingyoutube-screenshot_2336207.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
