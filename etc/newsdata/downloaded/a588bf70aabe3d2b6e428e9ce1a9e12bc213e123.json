Within days, the US, the UK and France launched barrages of cruise missiles in retaliation. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the international chemical weapons watchdog, later backed the justification, all but pointing the finger at Syria in its final report, which was released in March.\n\nNow a panel of experts says the report was based on a flawed conclusion and likely deliberately steered toward the West-favored outcome. The accusation is based on evidence and testimony of an OPCW investigator, who came forward with damning evidence that his own organization had breached its mission.\n\nPanel Criticizes \u2018Unacceptable Practices\u2019 in the OPCW\u2019s investigation of the Alleged Chemical Attack in Douma, Syria on April 7th 2018 https://t.co/1XD72nlzzq \u2014 Courage Foundation (@couragefound) October 23, 2019\n\nAfter talking to the whistleblower and examining internal reports, text exchanges and other evidence, the panel was convinced that \u201ckey information about chemical analyses, toxicology consultations, ballistics studies, and witness testimonies was suppressed, ostensibly to favor a preordained conclusion,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\nThe statement said the OPCW took effort to exclude dissenting investigators and silence their attempts to raise concerns about the report, which is \u201ca right explicitly conferred on inspectors in the Chemical Weapons Convention.\u201d The experts called on the organization to revisit its investigation and allow those not agreeing with the conclusion put in the final report to voice their concerns without fear of reprisal.\n\nAlso on rt.com Scientific paper arguing Assad not responsible for Syria chemical attack shelved after Bellingcat-led backlash\n\nThe panel convened by the Courage Foundation, which accepts donations for the legal defense of whistleblowers and journalists that report on leaks, includes several prominent specialists and public figures, including Jos\u00e9 Bustani, a Brazilian diplomat who served as the OPCW\u2019s first Director General before being strong-armed from the office by US superhawk John Bolton.\n\nBustani said the whistleblower confirmed his doubts about the report, which \u201cseemed incoherent at best\u201d right from the start.\n\n\u201cMy hope is that the concerns expressed publicly by the Panel, in its joint consensus statement, will catalyze a process by which the Organization can be resurrected to become the independent and non-discriminatory body it used to be.\u201d\n\nThe panel did not make public the name of the whistleblower or any previously unpublished evidence of the OPCW\u2019s alleged misconduct. WikiLeaks, whose editor-in-chief Kristinn Hrafnsson was a member of the panel, re-printeda draft engineering assessment penned by an OPCW investigator, which was leaked in May. The document rejects the claim that chlorine cylinders, which were used for delivery of the toxic gas in Douma, had been dropped from the air, which was used as a key argument in accusing the Syrian army for the attack.\n\nAlso on rt.com Leaked OPCW memo casts doubt on watchdog\u2019s Douma \u2018chemical attack\u2019 conclusions\n\nThe OPCW did not challenge the authenticity of the document, but stood by its conclusions on the Douma incident.\n\nLike this story?
