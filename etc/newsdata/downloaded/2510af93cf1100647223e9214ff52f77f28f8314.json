She warms up her core muscles by raising an opposite arm and leg in tabletop pose.\n\nDustin Lindblad regularly causes rushed New Yorkers to stop in their tracks and watch as she balances in tree pose on a slackline strung near the George Washington Bridge.\n\n\u201cMany cyclists and the occasional inline speed skater stop to inquire if I\u2019m in the circus,\u201d the 51-year-old freelance designer says.\n\nAfter more than a decade of doing traditional yoga, Ms. Lindblad took her practice up a notch by swapping her mat for a slackline that\u2019s 1 inch wide. For the past three years, she\u2019s performed her routine along the Hudson River, earning a reputation among Upper Manhattan residents as the woman walking on air, she says.\n\nMs. Lindblad warms up on the ground with a variation on dancer pose.

The partner practice combines elements of yoga, acrobatics and Thai massage and involves one partner lifting another into poses. In 2016, she flubbed a pose and broke both wrists. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do a handstand for six months,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was very frustrating physically and emotionally.\u201d\n\nshare your thoughts What workout helps calm your mind best? Join the conversation below.\n\nFriends in the acrobatics community encouraged her to try slacklining while she recovered. So she strapped on wrist guards and set about improving her balance. Unlike a tightrope, which involves a cable, slacklining is done on webbing, so there is some give to it. She started by sitting and crawling on a 25-foot-long slackline strung 18 inches off the ground. She advanced slowly to standing and doing yoga postures. Now she practices year-round on a 50-foot slackline about 5 feet off the ground.\n\nMs. Lindblad finds the waterfront setting calming. Mid-spring and fall can get windy, but she says the gusts are nothing compared with the trains that pass by every 15 minutes. \u201cAt first I\u2019d fall every time the train passed. But the distraction forces you to look inward and be completely present. It\u2019s like a moving meditation. It brings me to the now, relaxes my mind and helps me to reset.\u201d\n\nMs. Lindblad begins her slackline yoga practice with seated positions.

Before hopping on the slackline, she warms up on the grass by performing squats, splits, ankle stretches, forward folds and downward dog pose. Her slackline workout begins with seated, kneeling or reclined poses. \u201cThis helps orient me to the tension of the line,\u201d she says.\n\nMs. Lindblad uses her core muscles by raising an opposite arm and leg in tabletop pose.

Photo: Bess Adler for The Wall Street Journal\n\nShe often starts in tabletop pose on hands and knees and will extend her right arm forward and left leg back. Then she switches, doing 15 repetitions on each side. She moves into locust pose, a yoga posture where you lie on your stomach and lift your head, chest, arms and legs off the ground. Then she does boat pose, where she sits and raises her arms and legs to make a V-shape with her body.\n\nA typical sequence might include 10 to 12 poses, including back bends perpendicular and parallel to the line and star pose, a variation of side plank with the top leg extended.\n\nEvery second or third day she mixes in a handstand workout. After a series of wrist exercises, she practices seven reps each of four different handstands. She holds her handstands between 10 to 20 seconds, then drops into a back bend and rises up to stand from her backbend pose. \u201cTuck-ups are the hardest, so I save them for last,\u201d she says. Those require her to enter a handstand by jumping off both feet into a tuck position and extend her legs up into a handstand.\n\nTo build strength and endurance, she does handstand holds of 30 seconds to three minutes. She ends by standing and dropping back into a back bend seven to 10 times. \u201cDropbacks strengthen my quads and back,\u201d she says.\n\nMs. Lindblad can balance in a handstand for up to three minutes.

Breakfast is oatmeal topped with berries, almonds and a dollop of goat\u2019s milk yogurt. \u201cIn the summer, I live off of smoothies,\u201d she says. Her go-to blend includes kale, spinach, avocado, pineapple, mint and jalape\u00f1o. Dinner is usually a kale salad dressed in balsamic vinaigrette or salmon sushi.\n\nThe Cost and Gear\n\nMs. Lindblad spent $130 on her YogaSlackers slackline kit. She wears Prana and Athleta apparel. She wears Vibram Vi-S shoes ($85) or Feiyue Fe Lo martial arts shoes ($70). In the summer, she protects herself from the sun with ActiveIce Spectrum sun gloves ($25), a Carve Designs lake sunshirt with UPF 50+ sun protection ($58) and a Sombriolet sun hat ($42). In winter, she layers up and wears windproof Pearl Izumi Escape soft-shell gloves ($45).\n\nThe Playlist\n\nShe calls the birds, the sound of the Hudson River and the passing trains her outdoor soundtrack. Indoors, her playlist includes Lord Huron, the Lumineers, Emancipator and Tycho.\n\nMs. Lindblad says standing and dropping backward into a back bend strengthens her quads and back.

Join the conversation below.\n\nA circus tightrope is a taut cable, he says, while a slackline is flexible and moves in three dimensions. He suggests beginners start with a 2-inch webbing stretched fairly tightly, stretched 20 to 30 feet at knee height or lower. Starter kits cost between $50 and $100 at outdoor sporting goods stores, he says.\n\n\u201cKits come with tree protection, something people often forget about,\u201d Mr. Collins says. \u201cIf you use a tree as your anchor, you should have something buffering the bark. That could be as simple as a towel.\u201d\n\nHe says the biggest mistake people make is trying to walk immediately. \u201cWe teach people to first learn how to sit on the line, and then find their balance, and maybe stand and eventually walk,\u201d he says. \u201cThe biggest rule of thumb is: Whatever way you look is the way you go, so you want to keep your gaze forward at the point where the line connects to the tree.\u201d\n\nMr. Collins says slacklining is a complementary cross-training workout for sports like surfing, snowboarding, football and basketball because it works the stabilizing muscles that people often overlook.\n\nWhat\u2019s your workout?
