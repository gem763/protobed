First passed by the British government in 1922 to quell a seamen\u2019s strike in Hong Kong\u2019s harbor, the law was last used by the colonial administration to help put down riots that rocked the trading hub in 1967.\n\nA spokesman for Chief Executive Carrie Lam\u2019s office wasn\u2019t immediately able to comment on the reports when reached by phone Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe move would come shortly after a protester was shot in violent demonstrations that once again shook the city on Oct. 1, as President Xi Jinping celebrated 70 years of Communist party rule in Beijing. Some pro-China lawmakers in Hong Kong had called on Wednesday for a ban on wearing masks at public gatherings to stop protesters from hiding their identity from police officers.\n\nThe government re-evaluated the situation after clashes in multiple districts on National Day, Cable TV reported, citing unidentified sources. Authorities believe the anti-mask law can help restore order, the report said, adding that it would only target occasions like certain rallies and marches. Details were still being studied, it said.\n\nHong Kong stocks briefly jumped on the reports in afternoon trade, rapidly erasing an earlier decline.\n\n\u201cNow the anti-mask law at least gives investors some hope that it could be a way to cool down the protests,\u201d said Steven Leung, executive director at UOB Kay Hian Hong Kong Ltd. \u201cSome people could be worried about being identified if they can\u2019t wear masks during protests. That\u2019s why we see local shares rallying, such as developers and retailers.\u201d", "description": "The ordinance -- previously denounced by protest leaders as a form of martial law -- could give the government greater leeway to arrest citizens and censor publications, among other measures.", "authors": ["Adam Beam", "Shawn Tully", "Ed Frauenheim", "Jen Wieczner"], "top_image": "https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1173260468.jpg?resize=1200,600"}
