I still believe that if we play our best rugby, we will win.\"\n\nItoje's debut international season saw England win the 2016 Six Nations Championship with a grand slam.\n\nBut just two years later they lost five Tests in a row, three Championship reverses followed by two defeats in South Africa.\n\n\"That was a tough time for us,\" said Itoje.\n\n\"But I think those experiences make the resolve of the team stronger.\n\n\"Ironically, as a result of that, we have become tighter as a group. We have seen each other when we have been vulnerable and that often brings teams closer.\"\n\nSaturday's semi-final promises to be a defining match of Eddie Jones' four-year reign as England coach.\n\nThe Australian, in charge of his native Wallabies when they lost to England in the 2003 World Cup final, was appointed to his current post following England's first-round exit on home soil at the 2015 edition.\n\nYet he soon made no secret of his belief they could be crowned champions in Japan.\n\nAll of Itoje's 32 England appearances have come under Jones.\n\nBut the dynamic second row said his faith in England dated back to their 2007 World Cup final defeat by a South Africa side being advised by the veteran coach.\n\n\"I've always believed, even as a young rugby fan,\" Itoje recalled.\n\n\"I remember watching the 2007 Rugby World Cup - that was probably the first World Cup where rugby really captured my imagination.\n\n\"I've always seen England as a team that should be there competing for World Cups and should be there winning World Cups,\" explained the Saracens second row.\n\n\"As a young rugby player you watch all these tournaments and think: 'I want to win. I want to be part of something special.'\n\n\"When Eddie said that, I hadn't played for England at that point, but I definitely bought into it from the jump.\"\n\nTeams:\n\nEngland", "description": "Maro Itoje reckons this \"feels like the time we're going to get them\" as England bid to end New Zealand's eight-year reign as champions with a Rugby World Cup semi-final win.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6048/bbe2f0c90ab64318bcc8cca8b1b623a5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
