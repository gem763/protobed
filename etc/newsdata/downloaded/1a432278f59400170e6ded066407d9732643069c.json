The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) shed 1.99% in the first two days of the month, before staging a mild bounce-back in midday trading Thursday.\n\nFor Paul Schatz, president and chief investment officer of Heritage Capital, this doesn\u2019t signal Armageddon ahead. In fact, he thinks we could see the Dow break records and hit 30,000 by early 2020.\n\n\u201cEvery time the bears get the tiniest morsel of meat in their mouth they start crowing like, \u2018this is it, the big one, it\u2019s \u201808 again, buy your water and canned goods.\u2019 No, this is not the beginning of a bear market.\u201d\n\nMarket fundamentals are currently too strong, Schatz said, for stocks to tumble 20% from their recent highs, which is the technical definition of a bear market.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re only 4%-5% off our all-time highs, which has happened a number of times during this bull market, especially these past few years,\u201d Schatz said. \u201cThe credit markets are strong, the NYSE advance/decline line just made all-time highs and semiconductors have recently awoken from their slumber.\u201d\n\nSchatz characterized the recent selloff as a healthy and routine pullback. \u201cIt is October, which people view as being scary, but it\u2019s a month where bottoms are hammered in,\u201d he said.\n\nIf history is any guide, that\u2019s true.\n\nThe Wall Street bull is seen in the financial district in New York, U.S., March 7, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid More\n\n\u201cSome of the worst starts to October have been followed by huge gains for the remainder of the month and year,\u201d Bespoke Investment Group wrote in a note.\n\n\u201cThere have now been 14 [instances of the S&P falling by more than 1% on the first trading day of October ] since 1928. ... [T]he S&P has gained an average of 3.75% for the rest of October when it has started the month with a 1%+ decline. For the rest of the year, the S&P has been up 12 of 13 times after a 1% decline on the first trading day of October for an average gain of 7.22%,\u201d according to Bespoke.\n\nAnalysts at JP Morgan wrote, \u201cDespite average intra-year drops of 13.9%, annual returns [were] positive in 29 of 39 years.\u201d\n\nStill, long-time stock trader Stephen Guilfoyle said there\u2019s more selling to come before we find a bottom.\n\n\u201cThe time to get back in is probably not quite upon us,\u201d he said. \u201cThere needs to be more definition in Washington, in trade, in the macro. That said, for me, the time to sell aggressively has also passed.\u201d\n\nSchatz predicted that the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) could dip below 25,500 in the coming weeks, before rallying back.\n\n\u201cThen, I think we have a straight shot to Dow 28,000. Actually, Dow 30,000 is a strong possibility in the first quarter,\u201d he said.\n\nSchatz encouraged investors to start making their stock shopping lists now to take advantage of lower equity prices in early 2020. He likes defensive plays including Raytheon (RTN), which was recently upgraded to \u201coverweight\u201d from \u201cneutral\u201d at JP Morgan.\n\n\u201cThe bears shouldn\u2019t start celebrating yet,\u201d said Schatz. \u201cThey\u2019ve been proven wrong for 10 years, they\u2019ll be proven wrong for at least the rest of this year.\u201d\n\n-\n\nAlexis Christoforous is co-anchor of Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cThe First Trade.\u201d Follow her on Twitter @AlexisTVNews.\n\nRead more:\n\nWhat zero commissions mean for stocks\n\nSmarties \u2014 a 'recession-proof' candy \u2014 turns 70 years old with a brand-new look\n\n'Everybody\u2019s losing the trade war': Strategist\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "U.S. stocks have just logged their worst October start since 2008, as investors worry that a global economic slowdown will turn into a recession.", "authors": ["Alexis Christoforous"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/slAkrCWsZ18MKMauhHsywQ--~B/aD0zNjY4O3c9NTMyNztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/0a62c900-e602-11e9-aaff-1353e0c10c09", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
