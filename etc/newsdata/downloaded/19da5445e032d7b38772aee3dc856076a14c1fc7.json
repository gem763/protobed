Participants' weight and height were checked at the start of the survey, and weight was reported at age 25 and in middle age (average age: 47).\n\nOver an average 12 years, there were 10 500 deaths from any cause. After taking other factors into account, researchers concluded that people who were obese throughout adulthood had the highest risk of early death. Those who were overweight throughout adulthood had a slightly higher risk or none.\n\nThose who gained weight as adults had a higher risk of premature death than those who maintained a normal weight. Weight loss in young to middle adulthood was not significantly related with death risk.\n\nBut as people got older, the link between weight gain and death risk weakened, while the association between death risk and weight loss from middle to late adulthood became stronger and significant.\n\nImportance of maintaining normal weight\n\nThe study cannot prove cause and effect, and researchers said they can't rule out the possibility that some of the risk was due to factors they didn't investigate.\n\nThe findings were published in the BMJ. An Pan, a professor of public health at Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China, led the study.\n\n\"Stable obesity across adulthood, weight gain from young to middle adulthood, and weight loss from middle to late adulthood were associated with increased risks of mortality,\" the researchers said in a journal news release.\n\n\"The results highlight the importance of maintaining normal weight across adulthood, especially preventing weight gain in early adulthood, for preventing premature deaths in later life,\" Pan and his colleagues noted.\n\nIn the United States, 36% of men and 38% of women were considered obese in 2016, according to the researchers.\n\nImage credit: unsplash.com\n\n", "description": "The findings of a new Chinese study suggest that maintaining normal weight throughout adulthood reduces the risk of early death.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9500/6c00cb45dc10468bb8762f9a3a9e2481.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
