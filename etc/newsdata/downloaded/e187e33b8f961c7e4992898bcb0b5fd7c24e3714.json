The fires have spread despite preventative measures taken by local utility Pacific Gas and Electric (PCG), which introduced rolling blackouts in order to reduce the likelihood of catastrophe, but local officials said the blazes aren\u2019t going away any time soon.\n\n\u201cI was talking to other area officials and we\u2019re pretty certain that this is going to be our life for about the next 10 years,\u201d said Melanie Bagby, mayor of Cloverdale, California. \u201cThat\u2019s about how long it\u2019s going to take to be able to upgrade the electrical grid and our infrastructure. What we really need to be doing is going to micro-grids and localizing our power, but that kind of sweeping infrastructure change does take time and it\u2019s going to have a huge effect on the California economy.\u201d\n\nFirefighters work to defend homes from an approaching wildfire in Sonoma, California, U.S. October 14, 2017. REUTERS/Jim Urquhart More\n\nPG&E is not accountable to anybody\n\nAccording to a report from PG&E, the Sonoma County fire that\u2019s raging through California\u2019s wine country (also known as the Kincade fire) may have been caused by a broken jumper cable found near the base of one of its transmission towers. Although the company has not yet accepted responsibility for the fire, it\u2019s clear the power outages were not as effective as they had hoped.\n\n\u201cThe first rolling blackout was basically two sections. The northern part of town was unaffected, but the lower part of town where a lot of our services and a lot of our tax revenue come from and of course one of our major area breweries was affected. So that was painful from a revenue standpoint,\u201d Bagby said.\n\nWhen asked if PG&E has been an effective communicator on the ground, Bagby told Yahoo Finance, \u201cWe are much happier with their outreach. We are much happier with the information they are sharing, but of course, it comes a little late.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs an elected official, it\u2019s also part of my job to educate people... when PG&E does a blackout, they are not accountable to anybody. They can make a unilateral decision and they don\u2019t really answer to anybody and we need to change that. And where we need to change that is at the state level and at the CPUC.\u201d\n\nNick Rose is a producer for Yahoo Finance.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Melanie Bagby, mayor of Cloverdale, California, talks about the wildfires and blackouts.", "authors": ["Nick Rose"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/o9McAEXFsY6.0OBmeB7.EA--~B/aD0zMjkzO3c9NDkzOTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/efe5a830-f75f-11e9-bf56-fc57b44b0917", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
