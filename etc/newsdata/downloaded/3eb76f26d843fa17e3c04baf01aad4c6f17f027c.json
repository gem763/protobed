More than two months later, several presidential candidates have worked to improve their websites, but none have yet adopted all the measures that Miami Lighthouse determined they would need to be fully accessible to blind and low-vision voters.\n\nAfter Yang, former Vice President Joe Biden had the next most improved website, followed by Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and New Jersey Senator Cory Booker. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019 website score did not show any improvements from June, the report found, and Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar\u2019s website became more difficult to use.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

The new ranking is topped by Yang, Biden, Booker and then former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro.\n\nSeveral candidates, such as Warren and Booker, have added website accessibility statements, which function as a promise that they are committed to making their sites accessible.\n\nNone of the 2020 presidential candidates were out in front on this issue. There are 35 million eligible disabled voters in the U.S. and more than 12 million Americans over age 40 have vision or eye problems, but when Miami Lighthouse conducted its initial review of presidential candidates\u2019 websites, the organization found that blind and low-vision voters would have trouble accessing every one of them.\n\n\u201cThat is a little bit exclusionary,\u201d says Virginia Jacko, CEO of Miami Lighthouse. \u201cThey are saying, in essence: only people that do not have a vision impairment are allowed to go to the website.\u201d\n\nWebsite accessibility can encompass a variety of factors depending on a person\u2019s individual needs, but the Miami Lighthouse review focused on assessing whether people who are blind or have low vision can access information on candidates\u2019 websites. The team used a set of 10 criteria for its reviews, looking at elements such as whether websites included alternative text to describe logos and links for people using screen-reading software, whether text could be viewed in high-contrast colors and different sizes and whether navigation elements were clearly organized. They scored each item on a scale of one to four, with one meaning not accessible and four representing fully accessible.\n\nTo make their campaign websites accessible to even more voters, candidates could also caption and transcribe any videos they post and ensure that moving images or the website\u2019s design don\u2019t cause issues for people with cognitive impairments.\n\nThe ability to engage with candidates\u2019 websites is particularly important for disabled voters because they already face many barriers to political participation. Disability voter turnout has historically lagged behind nondisabled voters, and part of that is because of obstacles like physically inaccessible polling places and voter ID laws, which can present a problem because disabled people are less likely to drive and may not have the right kind of ID. But turnout surged among people with disabilities in 2018, and research has found that if disabled people voted at the same rate as their nondisabled counterparts, there would be 2.35 million more votes.\n\nWhile politicians have not historically focused on engaging the disability community, that has started to change. Several of the 2020 Democratic presidential contenders have talked about advocating for disability rights and many have made health care central to their campaigns.\n\nJacko sees making the candidates\u2019 websites fully accessible as an important next step. She said she felt a \u201cgroundswell\u201d of support following Miami Lighthouse\u2019s first report in June and wants to give candidates the \u201cbenefit of the doubt\u201d but hopes to see more change coming.\n\nDuring their first assessment, the Miami Lighthouse team examined the websites of all 20 Democratic candidates in the first round of presidential debates plus President Donald Trump and his first Republican challenger former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld. This time, the review focused on the 10 Democrats who will appear in Thursday night\u2019s Houston debate plus Trump, Weld and former Republican Congressman Joe Walsh, who has also entered the Republican primary.\n\nFive campaigns \u2014 Yang, Sanders, Biden, Warren and Booker \u2014 got in touch with Miami Lighthouse after the June report, and Jacko said her team has offered advice to all who have asked. Some of the most common changes to candidates\u2019 websites were to allow users to change the font size (similar to how campaign websites have been translated into Spanish), to add alternative text and to better organize the websites\u2019 pages so they can be navigated by screen reading software.\n\nAfter the changes that were made, Yang\u2019s campaign got a score of 3.56 out of 4.0; Klobuchar\u2019s campaign held the bottom score of 2.10. After Klobuchar, Sanders, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Warren were still at bottom of the pack.\n\nThis shows that while candidates might be talking about disabled people as they discuss hot-button campaign issues, they still have a ways to go when it comes to including them in the conversation.\n\n\u201cThese individuals talk about inclusion and they talk about caring,\u201d Jacko said. \u201cThere needs to be a significant change in people designing websites.\u201d\n\nWrite to Abigail Abrams at abigail.abrams@time.com.", "description": "The ability to engage with candidates\u2019 websites is important for disabled voters, who already face barriers to political participation", "authors": ["Abigail Abrams"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/andrew-yang-website-accessibility.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
