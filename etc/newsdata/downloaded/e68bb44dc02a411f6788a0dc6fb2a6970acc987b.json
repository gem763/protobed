She owns the best time of 21.74 this season but opted out of the 200m in Doha to run the 400m.", "description": "Britain's Dina Asher-Smith led the charge into the 200 metres final at the world athletics championships on Tuesday while Jamaican Olympic champion Elaine Thompson pulled out to leave the gold medal up for grabs.", "authors": ["Steve Keating", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435995736&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF903CT", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
