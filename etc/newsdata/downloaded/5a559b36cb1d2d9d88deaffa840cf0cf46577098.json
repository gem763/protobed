REUTERS/Stephane Mahe\n\n\u201cThe Conservative party is running one of the dirtiest, nastiest campaigns based on disinformation that we\u2019ve ever seen in this country,\u201d Trudeau told reporters during a campaign stop in Montreal.\n\nPolls show Trudeau\u2019s Liberals are in a statistical tie with the opposition Conservatives. A Nanos Research overnight poll for CTV and the Globe and Mail newspaper put the Conservative Party at 32.5%, the Liberals at 31.9%, and the left-leaning New Democrats (NDP) at 18.8%. Canadians vote on Oct. 21.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trudeau, Conservative leader Andrew Scheer and NDP chief Jagmeet Singh were all stumping for votes in Quebec, a province that is a key political battleground, home to 78 of the 338 seats up for grabs. The Conservative leader was also scheduled to campaign in Ontario.\n\nIn the only English-language debate, Scheer said Trudeau was \u201ca phony and a fraud\u201d who did not deserve to govern. Scheer has repeatedly said Trudeau will raise taxes immediately after the election - a claim Trudeau has denied.\n\nThe Conservatives were the source of a video of Trudeau in blackface in the early 1990s. They gave it to Global News to authenticate and it emerged a day after the first blackface picture was published by Time magazine.\n\n\u201cAndrew Scheer and the Conservatives are choosing to play very divisive games and to use politics of fear and division to try and get Canadians to vote for them,\u201d Trudeau said.\n\nTrudeau targeted his Conservative counterpart near the end of the nearly six-week official campaign period, which has been characterized by mudslinging on both sides, and as he seeks to motivate his supporters to get out and cast a vote.\n\n\u201cDear friends, we may wake up Tuesday morning and have a government led by Andrew Scheer. And the only way to avoid that is to vote for the Liberal party,\u201d Trudeau said in French.\n\nOn his part, Scheer has had to deal with repeated references by Trudeau to his personal anti-abortion stance, even though the Conservative leader has said he won\u2019t limit a woman\u2019s right to choose.\n\n\u201cJustin Trudeau has been dividing Canadians - pitting regions of our great country against each other,\u201d Simon Jefferies, a spokesman for Scheer\u2019s campaign, said in a statement, adding Trudeau \u201cshould take a look in the mirror.\u201d\n\nAlso in Montreal on Wednesday, Singh was asked by reporters what made his party different from the governing Liberals.\n\n\u201cWe are actually progressive,\u201d Singh said, drawing laughter from the crowd. Trudeau, he said, \u201cpromises something that will help people out, but then does the opposite.\u201d", "description": "Canada's Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Wednesday accused his Conservative rival of running a nasty and divisive campaign just days before voters head to the polls in a tight election race.", "authors": ["Kelsey Johnson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441582936&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F1PG-OCADN", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
