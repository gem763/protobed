The economic disparity in your region is such that those with homes and good jobs in the tech sector are out of touch with their more financially challenged brethren. (Yes, we\u2019re looking at you.) With that in mind, you need some sort of exercise to help you better relate to those living on the other side of the tracks or, more likely, in a cardboard box. Not to worry\u2026 the city has you covered. Come on down to the Cupertino Senior Center on the second of the month and take part in a \u201cpoverty simulator.\u201d (Free Beacon)\n\nResidents of Cupertino, Calif., and the surrounding enclaves populated by wealthy liberals will soon have the opportunity to attend a government-sponsored \u201cpoverty simulation\u201d designed to educate participants on \u201cthe reality of a Silicon Valley that grows in disparity as much as prosperity.\u201d The event will take place on Nov. 2 from 10 a.m. to noon at the Cupertino Senior Center. During the two-hour simulation, participants will \u201cwork to overcome barriers to social services, live off insufficient income, and encounter unforeseen economic obstacles along the way,\u201d according to the City of Cupertino website. The poverty simulation will be hosted by the city and two local nonprofits, West Valley Community Services and Step Up Silicon Valley. The latter group describes itself as a \u201csocial innovation network focused on reducing poverty.\u201d\n\nSo for two hours on a Saturday morning you will be able to learn how to access social services. I suppose that could come in handy if you lose your job. You\u2019ll also be \u201cliving off of insufficient income.\u201d Even if they take all of your money away at the door, how much were you going to spend between ten and noon on Saturday morning? Particularly when you\u2019re inside of a retirement center.\n\nIf you\u2019re so well off that you can\u2019t \u201crelate\u201d to the less fortunate, perhaps there\u2019s a better way to make an impact. You could go down to the local soup kitchen with a big bag of bread, cold cuts, cheese, and condiments and start making sandwiches to feed the hungry. You might consider calling the local battered women\u2019s shelter and see if they need any help or donations. Heck, you could just walk down to the areas where the homeless congregate on the streets and start handing out food. I\u2019ve seen people do it.\n\nNobody is going to learn about the experience of being poor in two hours when they\u2019re just going to walk back outside, hop into their Tesla and drive back to their gated community. Real poverty is figuring out where your next meal is coming from and then not being able to enjoy it because you still have no idea where the next meal will come from. It\u2019s being out on the street and knowing that you won\u2019t have a locked door between you and any potential attackers when you lay your head down to rest that night.\n\nOf course, as Andrew Stiles at the Free Beacon points out, if all you\u2019re really interested in doing is trying to publicly express your opposition to poverty and make sure all of your friends see you doing it, carry on. Sounds like you\u2019ve got this one nailed down pat.", "description": "Simulate this.", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/homeless.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
