Photo: KMazur/WireImage\n\nA good friend is able to take a joke at their expense; a great one will try to one-up it instead. Once, my friend Alex and I were messing around and I said something at his expense, so he pushed me into a wall and accidentally scraped my hand. It somehow scarred, but I laugh about it now because it\u2019s the perfect symbol of our friendship in the best way. Reading about Elton John\u2019s friendship with Rod Stewart in John\u2019s new memoir, Me, reminded me of my back-and-forths with Alex \u2014 only, John and Stewart\u2019s rivalry is leagues ahead of us, a decades-long quasi-feud to aspire to. In fact, everyone should aspire to have a friend be the Rod Stewart to their Elton John.\n\nJohn knew Stewart, who\u2019d go on to become another piano-playing English rock star, from his early days playing in the band Bluesology \u2014 Stewart had been a previous bandmate of frontman Long John Baldry. But Stewart\u2019s cover of John\u2019s early song \u201cCountry Comfort\u201d \u201cset the tone\u201d for their friendship. As John remembers, \u201cHe changed the lyrics, something I complained about at length in the press: \u2018He sounds like he made it up as he went along! He couldn\u2019t have got further from the original if he\u2019d sung \u201cThe Camptown Races\u201d!\u2019\u201d Since then, John writes, \u201cWe\u2019ve spent nearly fifty years constantly taking the piss out of, and trying to put one over, each other.\u201d\n\nFor instance: In the \u201980s, Stewart\u2019s PR team had advertised a London concert with a blimp featuring a photo of his face. John saw an opportunity. \u201cSo I called my management and they hired someone to shoot it down: apparently it landed on top of a double-decker bus and was last seen heading toward Putney,\u201d he explains. \u201cAbout an hour later, the phone went. It was Rod, spluttering about the disappearance.\u201d But Stewart got the last laugh: \u201cA year later, I was playing Olympia and the promoters had hung a huge banner across the street,\u201d John remembers. \u201cIt was mysteriously cut down immediately after it was put up.\u201d Of course, the culprit was none other than Stewart, who had the perfect response to John over the phone. \u201cSuch a shame about your banner, love,\u201d he said. \u201cI heard it wasn\u2019t even up five minutes. I bet you didn\u2019t even get to see it.\u201d\n\nThey had their good times \u2014 they gave each other drag nicknames (John was Sharon and Stewart was Phyllis), and John once convinced Stewart to dance at a club by giving him poppers. (Oh, the benefits of having gay friends!) But the key to their great rivalry? John never misses a shot. \u201cI was in bed alone at Woodside [his Berkshire home] one Sunday morning, half watching television, when a guy with bright orange hair suddenly appeared on the screen and called Rod Stewart a useless old fucker,\u201d he writes. See where this is going? \u201cSomeone slagging Rod off was clearly too good to miss. His name was Johnny Rotten \u2026 I made a mental note to ring Rod later, just to make sure he knew all about it.\u201d And oh, was it a read for the ages:\n\nHello, Phyllis, did you see the TV this morning? This new band were on called the Sex Pistols and, you\u2019ll never believe this, they said you were a useless old fucker. Those were their exact words: Rod Stewart is a useless old fucker. Isn\u2019t that terrible? You\u2019re only thirty-two. How awful for you.\n\nWhen John took an 18-month hiatus after leaving rehab, he made an exception for Stewart, as any true friend would. \u201cSpoiling things for Rod has never felt like work, more a thoroughly enjoyable hobby,\u201d he writes. So he surprised his friend on stage at Wembley Stadium \u201cin full drag\u201d and sat on his lap during a performance of Stewart\u2019s hit \u201cYou\u2019re in My Heart.\u201d Stewart\u2019s antics bring levity to the more serious moments in John\u2019s memoir, and it sounds like in his life as well. When John married Renate Blauel in 1984, against all his friends\u2019 recommendations, Stewart had to seize his own opportunity. His manager sent John a telegram that read, \u201cYou may still be standing, dear, but the rest of us are on the fucking floor.\u201d And I, too, am on the floor just reading it all!\n\nWe can all only hope to have a friendship as \u2026 invested \u2026 as Elton John and Rod Stewart\u2019s. And for the sake of us all (and a second memoir, perhaps), I hope John and Stewart can continue giving us these iconic pranks for many years to come.", "description": "Elton John and Rod Stewart, two English piano rockers found fun in pranking and sabotaging each other\u2019s careers during the best and worst times, John\u2019s new memoir reveals.", "authors": ["Justin Curto"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/15/15-elton-john-rod-stewart.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
