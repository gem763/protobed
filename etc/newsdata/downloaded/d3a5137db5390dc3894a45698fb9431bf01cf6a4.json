Xi then took the money, and used half to hire another hitman, Mo Tianxiang, to do the job, a release from Nanning Intermediate People\u2019s Court said.\n\n(Getty Images) More\n\nIn April 2014, Xi asked Tan for another $141,000 \u2014 which would be paid after the job, the court said in a release. Around the same time, Mo subcontracted another hitman, Yang Kangsheng \u2014 paying him around $38,000 upfront and promising around $71,000 when the murder was completed. The court added that Mo gave Yang a phone with the rival developer's photo, a note with his license plate number and a printed photo of him.\n\nYang then offered the job to a fourth man, Yang Guangsheng, with a similar up-front payment of around $28,000 and another $71,000 when the job was done, the court said.\n\nAt the end of April, the second Yang ended up tasking the hit to a fifth man, Ling Xiansi, for a measly $14,000. Ling, rather than kick the proverbial can down the road to another hitman, ended up reaching out to the rival developer to tell him about the hit out for him, authorities say.\n\nLing and the developer ended up faking the murder, staging an image of the developer with his hands tied \u2014 which then circulated through the chain of hitmen back to Tan, the businessman who hired the first hitman.\n\nThe developer, however, reported his would-be murder to police.\n\nThe court, in a post shared on the social media platform WeChat per the Guardian, said that the defendants \"deliberately deprived others of their lives, and their actions constitute the crime of intentional homicide.\"\n\nFollow Joshua Bote on Twitter: @joshua_bote\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Chinese developer, five hitmen sentenced after failed murder outsource", "description": "Six men \u2014 including five hitmen \u2014 have been charged in Chinese court last Thursday, after all attempted to subcontract the killing to another hitman.", "authors": ["Joshua Bote", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Zc4kw9AtzyoeuxziCunVag--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/744e8950-f8d4-11e9-bff7-fe60fd32d2da", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
