We both previously had a very liberal attitude towards monogamy.\n\n(Image: Cavendish Press (Manchester) Ltd)\n\n(Image: Cavendish Press (Manchester) Ltd)\n\n\"We thought being in an open relationship was the way to find happiness because life is too short to spend all your life with one partner.\n\n\"But that all changed when I met Jack. I wanted to spend the rest of life with him and that meant ditching the extra-marital dating.\n\n\"I appreciate this is not your conventional love story but they do say that love finds a way - and it certainly has with Jack and I.\"\n\nJack said: \"If you had told me that I would meet the woman of my dreams on a cheating site, I never would have believed you.\n\n\"But after my first date with Thea I knew that I never wanted to share her with anyone else. I wanted us both to build a future together as a normal man and wife.\"\n\n(Image: Cavendish Press (Manchester) Ltd)\n\n(Image: Cavendish Press (Manchester) Ltd)\n\nThea and Jack first started dating a year ago where they live in West Bridgford, Nottingham, where Thea runs a business training dancers and Jack has a team of removal men working for him.\n\nThea was in a long-term relationship with her boyfriend and Jack was married to his first wife.\n\nThea said: \"We were both in relationships where we had permission to cheat. I was dating several men on a casual basis and was using lots of dating sites.\n\n\"A specialist extra-marital dating site suited me because the kind of people you meet are in open relationships, too.\n\n(Image: Cavendish Press (Manchester) Ltd)\n\n\"I had several affairs in this way and thought that I was living the perfect life - with lots of sex but the stability of having a steady partner back at home.\n\n\"For a long time I convinced myself that this is what I really wanted and that I was enjoying the best of both worlds.\n\n\"I would get the giddy excitement you get when you meet a new partner and then, when it all went a bit stale after a few dates, I could just move on without any complications.\n\n\"Then I met Jack and all that changed.\n\n(Image: Cavendish Press (Manchester) Ltd)\n\n\"He made me realise that my long-term relationship was a sham and that the flings I was having on the side were just that - meaningless flings.\n\n\"With Jack, I had something much more meaningful and I knew I could not handle the idea of him sleeping with another woman.\n\n\"Within a few dates, we had both left our partners and cancelled our subscription. We have remained faithful to each other ever since and cannot wait to tie the knot next year.\"\n\nLike Thea, Jack had been unfaithful several times and he is still married to his first wife. He will only tie the knot with Thea when his divorce comes through.\n\n\"I had had other flings with women I had met on dating sites before I met Thea. It was fun at first but it does get a bit tiring moving from one relationship to the next when you are still married.\n\n(Image: Cavendish Press (Manchester) Ltd)\n\n\"I didn't really connect with anyone until I met Thea and then love hit me like a thunderbolt.\"\n\nJack insists that he trusts Thea completely and they have been completely faithful since falling in love.\n\n\"We cannot bear to be apart so I know where Thea is 24/7 - we have total trust and cannot wait to build a future together,\" he said.\n\nThea said: \"Just because we have both cheated before doesn't mean will do it again. It's different with Jack.\"\n\nTo ensure that they both don't cheat in the future, they are working with relationship expert Louise Van Der Velde, who runs courses teaching couples how to have better relationships.\n\nJessica Leoni , a spokeswoman for IllicitEncounters, where the couple met, said: \"We are delighted that Thea and Jack are tying the knot after meeting on the site.\n\n\"Around 10% of the people who use the site do find love in this way while the vast majority happily continue to cheat with like-minded people.\"\n\nJack and Thea are the first couple from the site to go public with their wedding plans.", "description": "Thea Thorpe, 30, and her partner Jack Logan-Beddings, 36, plan to tie the knot this summer - and say their wedding will mark a \"new start\" for them both", "authors": ["Jon Harris", "Image", "Cavendish Press", "Manchester", "Ltd"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20543464.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_PAY-Cavendish-Press-Manchesr-Ltd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
