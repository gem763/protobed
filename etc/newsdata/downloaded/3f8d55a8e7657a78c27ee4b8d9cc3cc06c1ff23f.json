Elizabeth Warren is winning the likability race.\n\nA new poll found that Democrats and Democrat-leaning voters view the Massachusetts senator more favorably than any of her rivals for the party\u2019s presidential nomination.\n\nMs. Warren enjoys a net favorability rating of 64%, outshining former Vice President Joseph R. Biden\u2019s 49%, according to the NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll.\n\nThe results are a further boost for Ms. Warren, who has been climbing in the polls, as she and other top-tier candidates face off in debate Thursday night in Houston.\n\nThe spike in favorability is a startling image makeover for Ms. Warren, who was described in a January profile in Vanity Fair magazine as coming across on Capitol Hill as \u201cholier than thou,\u201d \u201caloof\u201d and having a \u201cmoralizing\u201d tone.\n\nMr. Biden, the front-runner in the race, had a favorability score of 71% and an unfavorable score of 22%, resulting in the net favorable 64%.\n\nThe new poll showed Ms. Warren\u2019s unfavorable rating tied at 11% with Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, who is known for his \u201cnice guy\u201d image.\n\nHer favorable score of 75% also topped Mr. Biden.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar, who relishes her reputation for being \u201cMinnesota nice,\u201d scored a net favorability rating of 18%, with an 18% unfavorable score.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
