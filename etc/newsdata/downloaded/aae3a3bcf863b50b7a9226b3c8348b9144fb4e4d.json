Or how I should be so appreciative for that opportunity.\n\n'But all I could think in my mind was \u201cthen why do I feel so f****** lonely all the time?\u201d\u2063\n\n\u2063'While I am very grateful I have been able to be a stay-at-home mom for the past four years, it\u2019s also been one of the hardest times of my life.'\n\n'People always talk about the upside of it.

So in my opinion, being able to afford to have me stay at home would be a luxury to ME and hopefully in the future we will be able to afford this.'\n\nBut others defended the post online, with one commenting: 'This is why I had to go back to work, one child or four children I needed that outside connection. Not everyone can be a stay at home mom.'\n\nOne added: 'Well said! I was a stay at home mother and this is the very reason I went back to work. My kids are teenagers, the oldest is 18, and I've been working a while but when I was doing it this is the truth.'", "description": "Caitlin Fladager, 23, from Vancouver, posted the rant about being a stay-at-home mother on Facebook.
