And royal assent, which must be granted for any legislation approved by Parliament to become law, hasn\u2019t been refused since 1708.\n\nSo how does the Queen express her views?\n\nShe doesn\u2019t. Although the Queen is the United Kingdom\u2019s head of state, she is not its head of government\u2014that role is filled by the prime minister. By avoiding party politics, she is able to position the monarchy as a unifying force in the country\u2014which, at a time when Britain is bitterly divided over its looming exit from the EU, is badly needed.\n\n\u201cNeutrality is the essence of being a symbol of national unity,\u201d Richard Fitzwilliams, an expert on the royal family, told me. \u201cThe only time the Queen puts her own words into public utterance is [in] her Christmas message,\u201d an annual broadcast that doesn\u2019t typically touch on politics or policy.\n\nWhat about the rest of the royal family?\n\nThough the emphasis on political neutrality applies to the whole royal family, there have been a few exceptions. Prince Charles, for example, has boycotted state banquets involving China in protest of the country\u2019s human-rights abuses. The heir to the throne has also publicly spoken out about genetically modified foods and climate change. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, have been similarly vocal on environmental issues.\n\n\u201cFrom time to time, issues have been taken up by members of the royal family,\u201d Fitzwilliams said, before noting that expectations are higher for a ruling monarch. \u201cThe idea that Charles could one day be an activist king was always rubbish.\u201d\n\nRead: How the British royal family became a global brand\n\nSurely the Queen has a position on Brexit, though ... Right?\n\nMany would like to think so. For years, people have argued that Brexit is simply too big for the royal family to ignore and that the Queen, through her fashion choices or otherwise, has been quietly signaling her position on the issue that has divided the nation. While those loyal to the Brexit cause have suggested that the Queen is secretly on their side, those opposed to it have held out hope that she might yet swoop in to join theirs.\n\nThe reality is, we\u2019ll likely never know the Queen\u2019s political views (if, indeed, she has any).\n\nHow\u2019s that political neutrality working out so far?\n\nIt hasn\u2019t been easy. In the case of Johnson\u2019s controversial decision to prorogue Parliament, the Queen was bound by convention and precedent to grant his request. Had she refused to suspend Parliament against his advice, as some had hoped, a constitutional crisis would have been the likely result.\n\n\u201cThat was what the English civil war was all about,\u201d Robert Hazell, a professor of government and the constitution at University College London, told me of the 17th-century conflict, which established the precedent that the monarchy cannot govern without Parliament\u2019s consent. \u201cKing Charles I lost [the war], and lost his head.\u201d", "description": "The country\u2019s monarch is the head of state, but her role is largely ceremonial, and she tries to stay out of politics.", "authors": ["Yasmeen Serhan"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/RTX70TZS/facebook.jpg?1567620104", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
