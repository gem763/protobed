The fleet of droids will put cars closer to one another than possible with human drivers and fit a third more cars in the same parking lot\n\nA three-month trial will see the robots, named Stan, take to Gatwick's car parks.\n\nGatwick's trial will take place in part of the South Terminal's long-stay car park.\n\nExisting infrastructure such as parking space markings and lampposts will be replaced with a smooth surface for the robots and room for 100 more vehicles.\n\nA car's shape and size is scanned by the equipment to ensure they are safely steered to where they need to go.\n\nEach journey is logged and corresponds to the passenger's flight number.\n\nThe scheme was revealed planning in an application to Crawley council.\n\nGatwick's trial will take place in part of the South Terminal's long-stay car park. Existing infrastructure such as parking space markings and lampposts will be replaced with a smooth surface for the robots and space for 270 cars opposed to 170\n\nVehicle's shape and size is scanned by the equipment to ensure they are safely steered to where they need to go. Each journey is logged and corresponds to the passenger's flight number\n\nTechnology in the system has been developed by French firm Stanley Robotics and will help combat the summer rush.\n\nAccording to the Evening Standard, St\u00e9phane Evanno, Stanley Robotics' co-founder, said: 'We call it a valet parking robot because people just need to drop off their car at the entrance of the car park and then they can basically leave and catch a flight, but it's doing more than just valet parking.'\n\nTrials of the same technology have previously been going on at Paris, Lyon and D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\nA five-month trial at Charles de Gaulle airport last year was a tremendous success, customers were oblivious that a robot was even involved in the process.", "description": "A trial is starting in August which will see customers leave their car in a drop-off zone before summoning a robot through a designated app. It will be at Gatwick's South Terminal long-stay car park.", "authors": ["Joe Pinkstone For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/23/17/8895576-0-image-a-57_1548262992608.jpg", "published_at": "2019-01-23"}
