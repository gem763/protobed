While it\u2019s a logical move, it also opens up the question of what to do with Manning.\n\nAnd what now of Eli Manning\u2026. \u2014 Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) September 17, 2019\n\nAt first blush, trading Manning to a quarterback-needy team like the Steelers or Jaguars (with whom Manning has previously been linked) for picks would seem like something the Giants should consider. And consider it they might, but actually being able to pull the trigger won\u2019t be that easy.\n\nThe first reason it will be difficult for the Giants to trade Manning is the amount of money he\u2019s still owed on his contract. Though the team has already paid a good chunk of his $17-million salary via bonuses, the two-time Super Bowl winner is still owed more than $10 million for the rest of this season, according to Ben Volin of The Boston Globe.\n\nAs Volin points out, that number would actually be a pretty good value for a team that\u2019s desperate to trade for a quarterback and he\u2019s right. The issue is that, by this point in the season, most teams have already used up most of their available cap space and have very little wiggle room.\n\nFor example, the Steelers have just $2.18 million in available cap space while the Jaguars have just $10.5 million, according to Spotrac. That means, unless they reconfigure their roster to free up space the Steelers couldn\u2019t afford Manning and, while the Jaguars technically could, acquiring him would hamstring Jacksonville from making moves down the road.\n\nIf the Giants and a potential trade partner somehow work out the financial details, they\u2019ll then have to convince Manning to leave the only team he has ever played for and start over with a new organization at age 38 as he reportedly has a no-trade clause.\n\nDon\u2019t get sense that Eli Manning wants to go play for another team. Remember this: He has a no-trade clause. \u2014 Chris Mortensen (@mortreport) September 17, 2019\n\nJordan Raanan, who covers the Giants for ESPN, reports that\u2019s unlikely to happen.\n\n\u201cHe has four kids ages 8 and under,\u201d Raanan wrote on Twitter. \u201cHe\u2019s made his home in New Jersey. He\u2019s 38 years old and already won two Super Bowls. Lots of reasons to stay in NJ and not chase a ring.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean Manning won\u2019t end up somewhere else next season as Sports Illustrated\u2019s Albert Breer reports the longtime Giant has said he wants to play beyond this year.\n\nWhere that will be, if anywhere, is up to him, not the Giants.\n\nIt's early and emotions are raw, but I don't get the sense that Eli Manning would be willing to waive his no-trade clause now that he's officially not starting for the Giants. The Giants obviously don't want to trade him, but I believe they'd do it if he asked. \u2014 Ralph Vacchiano (@RVacchianoSNY) September 17, 2019\n\nBut thanks to Manning\u2019s contract and his no-trade clause, any change in scenery will likely be coming in this summer via free agency, not this season via trade.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: RealClearLife, a news and lifestyle publisher, is now a part of InsideHook.
