The register is overseen by the National Park Service.\n\nKendell Thompson is superintendent of the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park. Thompson says the listing is important to help preserve the airplane factory\u2019s buildings and could help groups like the National Aviation Heritage Area or other partners compete for grant funding to redevelop the site.\n\nWilbur and Orville Wright formed the Wright Company in 1909.
