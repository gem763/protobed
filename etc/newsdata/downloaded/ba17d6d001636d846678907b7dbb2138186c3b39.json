Educated at Roman Catholic mission schools, he qualified as a teacher.\n\nWinning a scholarship to Fort Hare University in South Africa, he took the first of his seven academic degrees before teaching in Ghana, where he was greatly influenced by the pan-Africanist ideas of Ghana's post-independence leader Kwame Nkrumah. His first wife Sally was Ghanaian.\n\nIn 1960, Mugabe returned to Rhodesia. At first he worked for the African nationalist cause with Joshua Nkomo, before breaking away to become a founder member of the Zimbabwe African National Union (Zanu).\n\nIn 1964, after making a speech in which he called Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith and his government \"cowboys\", Mugabe was arrested and detained without trial for a decade.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Mugabe (l) with Nkomo (r) in 1960. The relationship between the two would sour after independence\n\nHis baby son died while he was still in prison and he was refused permission to attend the funeral.\n\nIn 1973, while still in detention, he was chosen as president of Zanu. After his release, he went to Mozambique and directed guerrilla raids into Rhodesia. His Zanu organisation formed a loose alliance with Nkomo's Zimbabwe African People's Union (Zapu).\n\nDuring the tortuous negotiations on independence for Rhodesia, he was seen as the most militant of the black leaders, and the most uncompromising in his demands.\n\nOn a 1976 visit to London, he declared that the only solution to the Rhodesian problem would come out of the barrel of a gun.\n\nConciliatory\n\nBut his negotiating skills earned him the respect of many of his former critics. The press hailed him as \"the thinking man's guerrilla\".\n\nThe Lancaster House agreement of 1979 set up a constitution for the new Republic of Zimbabwe, as Rhodesia was to be called, and set February 1980 for the first elections which would be open to the black majority.\n\nFighting the election on a separate platform from Nkomo, Mugabe scored an overwhelming and, to most outside observers, unexpected victory. Zanu secured a comfortable majority, although the polls were marred by accusations of vote-rigging and intimidation from both sides\n\nA self-confessed Marxist, Mugabe's victory initially had many white people packing their bags ready to leave Rhodesia, while his supporters danced in the streets.\n\nHowever, the moderate, conciliatory tone of his early statements reassured many of his opponents. He promised a broad-based government, with no victimisation and no nationalisation of private property. His theme, he told them, would be reconciliation.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption He initially promised a programme of reconciliation\n\nLater that year he outlined his economic policy, which mixed private enterprise with public investment.\n\nHe launched a programme to massively expand access to healthcare and education for black Zimbabweans, who had been marginalised under white-minority rule.\n\nWith the prime minister frequently advocating one-party rule, the rift between Mugabe and Nkomo widened.\n\nAfter the discovery of a huge cache of arms at Zapu-owned properties, Nkomo, recently demoted in a cabinet reshuffle, was dismissed from government.\n\nWhile paying lip service to democracy, Mugabe gradually stifled political opposition. The mid-1980s saw the massacre of thousands of ethnic Ndebeles seen as Nkomo's supporters in his home region of Matabeleland.\n\nConfiscation\n\nMugabe was implicated in the killings, committed by the Zimbabwean army's North Korean-trained 5th Brigade, but never brought to trial.\n\nUnder intense pressure, Nkomo agreed for his Zapu to be merged with - or taken over by - Zanu to become the virtually unchallenged Zanu-PF.\n\nAfter abolishing the office of prime minister, Mugabe became president in 1987 and was elected for a third term in 1996.\n\nThe same year, he married Grace Marufu, after his first wife had died from cancer. Mugabe already had two children with Grace, 40 years his junior. A third was born when the president was 73.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Farms were occupied by Zanu-PF supporters\n\nHe did have some success in building a non-racial society, but in 1992 introduced the Land Acquisition Act, permitting the confiscation of land without appeal.\n\nThe plan was to redistribute land at the expense of more than 4,500 white farmers, who still owned the bulk of the country's best land.\n\nIn early 2000, with his presidency under serious threat from the newly formed Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), led by former trade union leader Morgan Tsvangirai, Mugabe lashed out against the farmers, seen as MDC backers.\n\nHis supporters, the so-called \"war veterans\", occupied white-owned farms and a number of farmers and their black workers were killed.\n\nForeign aid\n\nThe action served to undermine the already battered economy as Zimbabwe's once valuable agricultural industry fell into ruin. Mugabe's critics accused him of distributing farms to his cronies, rather than the intended rural poor.\n\nRobert Mugabe - key dates\n\n1924: Born.

Large numbers of people in rural areas were prevented from voting by the closure of polling stations.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption MDC activists were attacked around the country in 2008\n\nWith the MDC, the US, UK and the European Union not recognising the election result because of the violence and allegations of fraud, Mugabe - and Zimbabwe - became increasingly isolated.\n\nThe Commonwealth also suspended Zimbabwe from participating in its meetings until it improved its record as a democracy.\n\nIn May 2005, Mugabe presided over Operation Restore Order, a crackdown on the black market and what was said to be \"general lawlessness\".\n\nSome 30,000 street vendors were arrested and whole shanty towns demolished, eventually leaving an estimated 700,000 Zimbabweans homeless.\n\nSquabbling\n\nIn March 2008, Mugabe lost the first round of the presidential elections but won the run-off in June after Mr Tsvangirai pulled out.\n\nIn the wake of sustained attacks against his supporters across the country, Mr Tsvangirai maintained that a free and fair election was not possible.\n\nZimbabwe's economic decline accelerated, with inflation rates reaching stratospheric levels.\n\nAfter hundreds of people died from cholera, partly because the government could not afford to import water treatment chemicals, Mugabe agreed to negotiate with his long-time rival about sharing power.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The power-sharing agreement was undermined by arguments\n\nAfter months of talks, in February 2009 Mugabe swore in Mr Tsvangirai as prime minister.\n\nIt came as no surprise that the arrangement was far from perfect, with constant squabbling and accusations by some human rights organisations that Mugabe's political opponents were still being detained and tortured.\n\nMr Tsvangirai's reputation also suffered by his association with the Mugabe regime, despite the fact that he had no influence over the increasingly irascible president.\n\nThe 2013 election, in which Mugabe won 61% of the vote, ended the power-sharing agreement and Mr Tsvangirai went into the political wilderness.\n\nWhile there were the usual accusations of electoral fraud - UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon asked that these be investigated - there was not the widespread violence that had marked previous polls in Zimbabwe.\n\nSuccessors\n\nIt was an election that saw Robert Mugabe, at the age of 89, confirm his position as the undisputed power in the country.\n\nHis advancing years, and increasing health problems, saw much speculation as to who might replace him.\n\nBut the manoeuvring among possible successors revealed how fragmented Zimbabwe's administration was and underlined the fact that it was only held together by Mugabe's dominance.\n\nMugabe himself seemed to delight in playing off his subordinates against each other in a deliberate attempt to dilute whatever opposition might arise.\n\nWith speculation that his wife, Grace, was poised to take control in the event of his death in office, Mugabe announced in 2015 that he fully intended to fight the 2018 elections, by which time he would be 94.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption He was the undisputed power in Zimbabwe\n\nAnd, to allay any doubt remaining among possible successors, he announced in February 2016 that he would remain in power \"until God says 'come'\".\n\nIn the event it wasn't God but units of the Zimbabwe National Army which came for Robert Mugabe. On 15 November 2017 he was placed under house arrest and, four days later, replaced as the leader of Zanu-PF by his former vice-president, Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\nDefiant to the end Mugabe refused to resign, But, on 21 November, as a motion to impeach him was being debated in the Zimbabwean parliament, the speaker of the House of Assembly announced that Robert Mugabe had finally resigned.\n\nMugabe negotiated a deal which protected him and his family from the risk of future prosecution and enabled him to retain his various business interests. He was also granted a house, servants, vehicles and full diplomatic status.\n\nAscetic in manner, Robert Mugabe dressed conservatively and drank no alcohol. He viewed both friend and foe with a scepticism verging on the paranoid.\n\nThe man who had been hailed as the hero of Africa's struggle to throw off colonialism had turned into a tyrant, trampling over human rights and turning a once prosperous country into an economic basket case.\n\nHis legacy is likely to haunt Zimbabwe for years.", "description": "His promises of democracy and reconciliation dissolved into violence and economic misery.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07mlvqf.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
