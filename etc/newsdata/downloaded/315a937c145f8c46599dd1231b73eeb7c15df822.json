USA TODAY\n\nEAST LANSING, Mich. \u2014 In three seasons from 2013 to '15, Mark Dantonio won 36 of 41 games and two Big Ten championships. He got to major bowl games in three consecutive seasons and earned wins in the Rose Bowl and Cotton Bowl.\n\nOn Feb. 19, 2016, Michigan State announced it had reached agreement with Dantonio on a new version of his six-year, rollover contract that included a more than $600,000 raise in his annual pay to $4.3 million.\n\nIt also included the prospect of one of the largest one-time lump-sum bonuses in college football: a $4.3 million payment \u201cin recognition of his long-service to the University\u201d if he remained the Spartans\u2019 coach through Jan. 15, 2020.\n\n\u201cMichigan State\u2019s football brand has never been stronger,\u201d then-athletic director Mark Hollis said in a statement at the time. \u201cWe\u2019re so excited about the future of our football program under Mark\u2019s leadership and direction.\u201d\n\nDantonio, in a statement, added: \u201cOver the last three years, we have competed as one of the elite teams in the country. Our student-athletes have embraced this distinction as well as the expectations that accompany it. We will continue to dream big.\u201d\n\nMuch has changed in the past 3\u00bd years. And the winning has dried up since.\n\nHUGE PAYMENT: Michigan State coach set for massive retention payout\n\nTHE WORST DEALS: Dan Wolken says these are college football's worst coaching contracts\n\nMichigan State coach Mark Dantonio has a 24-21 record since the start of the 2016 season.

It endured Dantonio\u2019s only losing season immediately after he received his pay bump. His program has been embroiled in off-field controversy with sexual misconduct convictions in two cases involving four former players and litigation since, including an ongoing federal civil lawsuit for wrongful termination of a former employee in which Dantonio is a defendant. Hollis and university president Lou Anna K. Simon, also defendants in that case, both resigned in the wake of the sexual assault scandal with former sports medicine doctor Larry Nassar that involved Michigan State and USA Gymnastics athletes.\n\nBut in less than three months, Michigan State will owe Dantonio that one-time $4.3 million payment after he completes his 13th season. It\u2019s not unusual for coaching contracts to include large payments designed to incentivize a coach to complete a full year or a period of years. Dantonio\u2019s contract includes a $700,000 payment he gets annually if he is Michigan State\u2019s head coach through June 30. Other coaches have arrangements that theoretically require them to complete more than one year, but also let them get a pro-rated amount if they get fired sooner for not winning enough games.\n\nDantonio\u2019s prospective $4.3 million is an all-or-nothing proposition.\n\nHowever, he and Michigan State have done this previously. In 2008, they amended their contract to add a $2 million payment if he stayed through Jan. 15, 2016. In 2011, they moved the triggering date for that payment forward by two years.\n\nMichigan\u2019s Jim Harbaugh matched that amount twice in 2016, when the university followed its promise to address deferred compensation with the split-dollar life insurance plan that resulted in a pair of $2 million payments that year. In 2017, Alabama\u2019s Nick Saban, a former MSU coach, got a $4 million signing bonus with a contract extension.\n\nDantonio\u2019s payment is not counted in this year\u2019s USA TODAY Sports compensation survey because it is due on the first day his 2020-21 contract year begins.\n\nBut in the 2020 season, Dantonio would receive about $3.7 million (in his 2019-20 contract year, he\u2019s basically getting $4.4 million) plus his one-time $4.3 million for a total of $8 million overall compensation, assuming nothing else changes with his contract or status as coach. (His yearly $700,000 bonus for remaining on the job each June 30 would resume in 2021.)\n\nIf Dantonio is fired or retires before Jan. 15, 2020, he is not due the $4.3 million. He would receive a $7 million buyout. Dantonio\u2019s one-time payment is due around the same time he is expected to be deposed in court for his dismissal of former staff member Curtis Blackwell, who was alleged by the university to have not reported a sexual assault to the university\u2019s Title IX office or police. A federal judge ordered the coach to face seven hours of questioning after MSU\u2019s 2019 season is completed, but a firm date has not yet been scheduled.\n\nContact Chris Solari: csolari@freepress.com.
