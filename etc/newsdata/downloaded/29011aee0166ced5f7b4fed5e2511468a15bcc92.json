(Photo: Noah K. Murray, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nIt will be the Astros and Nationals in the World Series.\n\nThe Astros, with what they believe is one of the greatest teams in baseball history, are sitting at 115 victories and counting.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to win,\u2019\u2019 Astros manager A.J. Hinch said, \u201cand to win as fast as we can.\u2019\u2019\n\nCertainly, they proved to everyone they can win postseason games even on the days Cole and Verlander are sitting in the dugout.\n\nOf course, it helps when you happen to hit two, three-run homers in the same game, courtesy of George Springer and Carlos Correa.\n\nIt\u2019s only the second time in Yankee postseason history, spanning 404 games, that the Yankees gave up two, three-run shots in the same game, one off starter Masahiro Tanaka and the other off Chad Green.\n\nCorrea, 25, became the youngest player in baseball history to hit 10 postseason homers.\n\nThe Yankees certainly were given every opportunity to win the game, and could have blown the game open in the first inning.\n\nReally, it had all the makings of a miserable night for Greinke. He opened the game by walking leadoff hitter D.J. LeMahieu on four pitches, and walked three of the first six batters for the first time in his career, forcing in a run.\n\nThe Astros sent pitching coach Brent Strom to the mound to settle him down, and moments later, was on the bullpen phone, telling Brad Peacock to warm up.\n\nNow, with the bases loaded, and Gary Sanchez given the chance to be a hero, he struck out on three pitches, extending his postseason blues.\n\nCAREER OVER? Sabathia may have thrown his last pitch\n\n'IT'S A JOKE': Astros livid over cheating allegations\n\nYANKEE STADIUM: Astros will pull team off if fans throw stuff\n\nWhen Sanchez finally got his first hit of the series in the sixth inning, driving in his first runs with a two-run homers, it was too little, too late.\n\nThe Yankees already were done.\n\nThe Astros simply are beating the Yankees in every phase of the game this series. They\u2019re showing more power, with six home runs. Playing better defense, committing just one error while the Yankees\u2019 infield had four. The starting pitching has been elite, giving up six earned runs in their four starts. Even their relievers have been superior to the Yankees\u2019 vaunted bullpen.\n\nThe Astros\u2019 relievers were put to work after Greinke lasted just 4 \u2153 innings, but except for rookie Josh James\u2019 homer to Sanchez, they were exceptional again.\n\nRyan Pressly, relieving Greinke, walked Aaron Hicks to load the bases with cleanup hitter Gleyber Torres and Edwin Encarnacion due up next. Hinch stuck with Pressly, who had surrendered a 21.60 ERA this postseason.\n\nTorres struck out swinging. And Encarnacion went down the same way.\n\nIt was that kind of night, with Astros reliever Will Harris, Joe Smith and Roberto Osuna flawless in the final three innings.\n\nNow, if the Astros close out their series Friday, they will not only have a fresh bullpen for the World Series, but will be able to line up co-aces Cole and Verlander for Games 1 and 2, and 5 and 6.\n\nAs for the Yankees, they will be sitting home.\n\nOnce again.\n\nFor the first time in a century they\u2019ll have gone a full decade without reaching the World Series.\n\nTheir season is over.\n\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter @Bnightengale", "description": "George Springer and Carlos Correa each slugged three-run homers as the Astros cruised to a 8-3 win over the Yankees in Game 4 of the ALCS.", "authors": ["Bob Nightengale", "Published A.M.
