We estimate 30% of earnings in [the Russell 2000] are from housing related industries, versus 12% for large,\u201d he added.\n\nMeanwhile, small caps still look relatively undervalued compared to large caps. Historically the Russell 2000 has been valued higher relative to the S&P 500 83% of the time.\n\nThough small caps have been undervalued relative to large for many months, DeSanctis argued that investors are now turning their attention to 2020 earnings, helping spark the recent outperformance. He predicts Russell 2000 index company earnings growth could be as high as 10% next year, after a year in which rising labor and input costs, along with the fading effects of the 2017 corporate tax cut, led Russell 2000 earnings to fall significantly year-to-date.\n\nStephen Suttmeier, technical research strategist at Bank of America Securities argued that the breadth of the rally in small cap stocks \u201csupports the case for a Russell 2000 breakout,\u201d in a Monday note to clients.\n\n\u201cSmall cap breadth improved last week with the percentage of Russell 2000 stocks above 200-day moving averages hitting is best level of the year,\u201d he wrote. \u201cA similar setup in 2016 preceded an upside breakout on the Russell 2000 and new highs for the index into late 2016.\u201d\n\nSuttmeier said the key level to watch for the Russell 2000 is a range between 1,596 and 1,618. If the Russell 2000 can break through this level, it would \u201csignal an upside back to the 2018 peak of 1,740.\u201d\n\nThe Russell rose 0.4% on Monday to close at 1,584.60, just a few points shy of this resistance level, making this week a potential make-or-break one for the small cap universe.", "description": "A September rally in the Russell 2000 could be here to stay, strategists tell MarketWatch", "authors": ["Chris Matthews", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR420_fork_r_ZG_20190917083557.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
