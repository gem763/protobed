Chinese Vice Premier Liu He agreed to a visit \u201cin early October\u201d during a telephone call on Thursday morning Beijing time with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, according to a statement from China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce. A cautious statement from the USTR\u2019s office confirmed that ministerial-level discussions will take place in \u201cthe coming weeks,\u201d without specifying when.\n\nLiars Poker\n\nOn August 26, I reported Trump Claims \"Meaningful\" Talks at the \"Highest Level\", China Doesn't Confirm\n\nA spokesman for the U.S. Trade Representative didn\u2019t respond to questions about when the call took place and between whom. Asked later in the day to clarify whom the calls were with, Mr. Trump said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about calls. We\u2019ve had calls. We\u2019ve had calls at the highest levels.\u201d\n\nYesterday, the Wall Street Journal reported Trump Warns China Not to Stall Talks.\n\nIt seems the phone call Trump announced on August 26 ago has finally been placed.\n\nWith that confirmation, please look on the handy-dandy chart at the top to figure out where we are.\n\nTrade War Cycle\n\nI hope someone is keeping track of how many times this cycle has repeated pic.twitter.com/5kft4b8lGY \u2014 StockCats (@StockCats) September 5, 2019\n\nIs anyone keeping track?\n\nI just made up a number \"for the 42nd time\". Perhaps its on the low side.\n\nChina Cycle Spinning Fast\n\nThe China cycle is spinning extremely fast right now.\n\nProgression Example\n\nFor all of the \u201cgeniuses\u201d out there, many who have been in other administrations and \u201ctaken to the cleaners\u201d by China, that want me to get together with the EU and others to go after China Trade practices remember, the EU & all treat us VERY unfairly on Trade also. Will change! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 3, 2019\n\n....And then, think what happens to China when I win. Deal would get MUCH TOUGHER! In the meantime, China\u2019s Supply Chain will crumble and businesses, jobs and money will be gone! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 3, 2019\n\nWe are doing very well in our negotiations with China. While I am sure they would love to be dealing with a new administration so they could continue their practice of \u201cripoff USA\u201d($600 B/year),16 months PLUS is a long time to be hemorrhaging jobs and companies on a long-shot.... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 3, 2019\n\nImportant Note\n\nThe cycle with China repeats at a rate 3-10 times faster than the cycle with Europe which in turn is faster than the cycle with Mexico. Track each country individually although the cycles may overlap on occasion.\n\nWhen things are purportedly going very well with China, that's when Trump is most likely to make an attack out of the blue on someone else, typically Germany.\n\nOn a timeline basis, I sense an attack on Germany or the EU coming soon. But as noted above, we may need a more China cycles to be sure.\n\nStop the Damn Lies\n\nFor a Trump trade refresher course on how the full cycle works historically, please see Dear President Trump: Stop the Damn Trade Lies", "description": "For the 42nd time, Trump reports trade war progress with .09/06/2019 8:04:17AM EST.", "authors": ["Mike Shedlock", "Matt Vespa", "Leah Barkoukis", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/233/f29f3628-a9b9-41e1-972e-0df2c6d426ac.png", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
