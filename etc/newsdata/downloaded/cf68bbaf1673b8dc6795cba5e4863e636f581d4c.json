(iStock/iStock)\n\nA dispute broke out early Sunday on a block in the Logan Circle area, and as sometimes happens when gunshots are fired, someone gets hit who is not the intended target.\n\nBut in this case, according to a police account, no gun was fired, and the unintended victim was struck not by a bullet, but by a rock.\n\nIn a statement, police said the incident occurred about 2:15 a.m. in the 1800 block of 14th Street NW. Two people, police said, became embroiled in a dispute. One of them, authorities said, threw a rock at the other.\n\nBut, police said, the rock missed the intended target and instead \u201cstruck another victim.\u201d\n\nPolice said they made an arrest on a charge of assault with a dangerous weapon, which they identified as a rock.\n\nIt was not clear whether anyone was injured.\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Unclear if injuries resulted in early Sunday incident.", "authors": ["Martin Weil", "Local Reporter", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/1AuiJyyn_wAKbmcHDPp0KezXaSs=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/P6BP7OVHAII6RLLPBADXBXG5YI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
