Reality Check unpacks the basics.\n\nThis involves customs posts and other infrastructure. Even Sweden and Norway, which are both in the EU's single market, have customs checks at major border crossings.\n\nHowever, the UK government has promised that it will not harden the Irish border in any circumstances.\n\nWhat's its solution?\n\nThe UK said it will not impose tariffs on Irish goods crossing the border into Northern Ireland.\n\nIn addition, it will not introduce any new checks or controls on goods at the land border.\n\nPlease upgrade your browser Your guide to Brexit jargon Use the list below or select a button\n\nFor Irish exporters to Northern Ireland, it would be like Brexit hasn't happened.\n\nHowever, Irish goods going direct to Great Britain, such as on the Dublin-Holyhead route, will be subject to new tariffs and controls.\n\nSo won't Irish exporters just ship their GB exports through Northern Ireland to avoid tariffs?\n\nTo some extent this will be possible.\n\nHM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) say there will be a \"general anti-avoidance rule\" to discourage Irish firms from using Northern Ireland as a tariff-free back door into GB.\n\nHowever, if Irish businesses have traditionally shipped through Northern Ireland, they can continue to use this route without facing tariffs.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Business editor Simon Jack looks at what could happen to trade after Brexit?\n\nIf they begin to ship products on this route for genuine commercial reasons, other than avoiding tariffs, that will also be permitted.\n\nIrish products which are processed in Northern Ireland and shipped onwards into GB will also be tariff free.\n\nHMRC will not be applying any new checks or controls on products crossing from Northern Ireland ports to GB. Instead, there will be \"intelligence led\" enforcement.\n\nWhat about products going from Northern Ireland to the Republic?\n\nThe no tariff, no checks plan is a unilateral initiative by the UK - it will not be matched by Ireland.\n\nAs an EU member, Ireland will be obliged to impose tariffs on Northern Ireland goods crossing the border and carry out checks to protect the single market.\n\nIn effect, this means Northern Ireland goods, particularly in the agrifood sector, will face substantial new trade barriers but Irish goods going in the other direction will not.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Single market rules require consignments of food or animals to enter the EU through specified border inspection posts\n\nThe government has acknowledged this will impact on the competitiveness of Northern Ireland businesses.\n\nThe Ulster Farmers' Union said that in order to protect the food industry in Northern Ireland the plan should be changed.\n\nThe union's president, Ivor Ferguson, said the current plan would mean a \"catastrophic\" outcome for farming and food production in Northern Ireland.\n\n\"Steep export tariffs, additional checks and regulations, combined with a proposed zero tariff on agricultural goods from Ireland to NI, will result in significant disruption and pose a logistical nightmare for farm businesses.\"\n\nDoes the plan comply with World Trade Organisation rules?\n\nThe most important WTO principle is that members do not discriminate. So, if zero tariffs are applied to one member, they should be applied to all other members.\n\nAt a glance, the UK government's plan for cross border trade with Ireland would appear to conflict with that.\n\nThe government is confident that the arrangement will not break WTO rules and that various exemptions to the non-discrimination principle could apply.\n\nHowever, some trade experts have expressed scepticism that the plan is compliant.", "description": "A senior civil servant says the no deal plan for NI would only be sustainable for a year.", "authors": ["John Campbell", "Bbc News Ni Economics", "Business Editor"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2351/production/_108614090_borderpic.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
