It can also pose a raised risk of injury and accidents.\n\nWe all know we should be getting seven to nine hours a night, but sleep disruption can add to the anxiety of knowing you\u2019re not getting enough. It\u2019s a vicious cycle.\n\nIt can also be an indicator of mental health problems.\n\nSleep expert Dr Nerina Ramlakhan says: \u2018Working in psychiatry, my experience has told me that people who were consistently waking between 2am and 4am in the morning unable to get back to sleep, were more likely to present with anxiety and depression.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, if you think you might be struggling with a mental health problem, it\u2019s important to consult a GP or speak to a loved one about it.\n\nHow does disrupted sleep affect us?\n\nThe occasional night without sleep is to be expected \u2013 especially if you\u2019re partial to an all-nighter with friends. A one-off is likely to make you tired and irritable, but poses no serious health problems.\n\nBut consistent nights with disrupted sleep can lead to issues both in the short term and further down the road.\n\nDr Nerina says: \u2018There is a lot of truth in the fact that lack of sleep can contribute to degenerative diseases. The first phase of sleep, before midnight is really important for helping to prevent the development of neurological disorders like Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s.\n\n\u2018Certain phases of sleep are really important for certain emotional and physical functions, including rebalancing emotional problems and resolving physical ailments.\n\n\u2018Studying both Western and Eastern sciences such as Ayurveda and traditional Chinese medicine, provides a much more holistic view on sleep. Traditional Chinese medicine shows you how each phase of sleep does something different for the body. For example, if you\u2019re chronically missing out on key phases of sleep, it can make you more vulnerable to developing certain illnesses and diseases.\n\nThis is backed up by the NHS, which states a continuous lack of sleep can make an individual \u2018prone to serious medical conditions, such as obesity, heart disease, high blood pressure and diabetes.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCan the clocks going back affect sleep patterns?\n\nAn evening relaxation routine can help the body prepare for sleep (Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nDr Nerina adds: \u2018The clocks changing shouldn\u2019t make too much difference to your wellbeing. Our bodies are far more resilient than we think. They need to be flexible to cope with life\u2019s demands.\n\n\u2018Think of any experience you\u2019ve had such as falling in love. When things like this happen, you may find that you suddenly need a lot less sleep. When you\u2019re excited by life, you don\u2019t need as much sleep and that\u2019s due to the physiological changes within the body which simply demonstrates that the purpose and body\u2019s need for sleep goes far beyond hours and routines.\u2019\n\nSo, on the whole, the clocks going back in October shouldn\u2019t impact sleep routines \u2013 thanks to how adaptable our bodies are.\n\nBut those suffering with persistent sleep problems should try and identify what could be the cause.\n\nSeasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is something thing to keep in mind as a possible cause, especially when it comes to difficulty sleeping during the winter.\n\nAlso known as \u2018winter depression\u2019, SAD can disrupt sleep routines. According to the Mayo Clinic, this is because the change in season can \u2018disrupt the balance of the body\u2019s level of melatonin, which plays a role in sleep patterns and mood.\u2019\n\nThe important thing is to try and get as much daylight as possible \u2013 this will increase the brain\u2019s release of the \u2018feel-good\u2019 chemical serotonin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEasy ways to help with sleep disruption\n\nAn evening relaxation routine can help the body prepare for sleep.\n\nSimple, enjoyable activities such as taking a bath, reading, meditating and breathing exercises, during the run up to bedtime, should relax your mind and body for sleep. Do these an hour before bed to help with the wind-down process.\n\nKeeping a routine can also help to minimise sleep disruption \u2013 so aim to go to sleep and wake up at the same time every day. This will help train your body to get used to going to sleep (and staying asleep). Of course, this isn\u2019t possible every single day, but try to keep it consistent for the first few weeks of starting out.\n\nDitching alcohol and coffee are two simple ways to help sleep better. Alcohol is known to have a negative impact on our rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, which is thought to be the most restorative stage of sleep. So while you may fall asleep, your body will spend less time in the REM stage \u2013 which means you\u2019re more likely to wake up feeling groggy and drowsy.\n\nSimple lifestyle factors can also play a role. It\u2019s a well-known fact that exercise helps to lift moods, due to the endorphins produced. This can help to reduce stress which may have a positive impact on sleep, making a 3am anxious wake-up less likely.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: New mum draws eyebrows on newborn to teach her \u2018not to fall asleep at parties\u2019\n\nMORE: The complicated relationship between depression and your sleep\n\nMORE: Sleep myths debunked, from swallowing spiders to drinking before bed\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "The clocks go back this weekend but for those battling with continuous sleep disruption, an extra hour for one night makes no difference.", "authors": ["Lizzie Thomson"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/quest-for-clean-sleep-22_1572077437.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
