Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), and claiming the leader of the impeachment inquiry \u201cmisled the American people.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSo, after defending President Trump through 13,435 false or misleading statements as of last week (by The Post Fact Checker\u2019s tally), Republicans are now thoroughly outraged because they think somebody misrepresented something Trump said.\n\nAD\n\nAnd so Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), with the blessing of GOP leadership, the co-sponsorship of 172 Republicans and a sum total of zero self-awareness, read aloud on the House floor Monday evening a censure resolution saying Schiff \u201cmanufactured a false retelling of the conversation\u201d between Trump and the Ukrainian president \u2014 an example of \u201cconduct that misleads the American people in a way that is not befitting an elected member of the House.\u201d (Schiff said at the time it was a \u201cparody\u201d and was \u201cin not so many words\u201d what Trump actually said.)\n\nApparently, Republicans chose to answer Schiff\u2019s original parody with a satire of a censure resolution.\n\nAD\n\nCompleting the farce: Just a few hours before consideration of the resolution alleging Schiff misrepresented Trump, Trump served up an entirely new falsehood about Schiff. Without basis, Trump alleged that Schiff invented the whistleblower\u2019s allegations.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMaybe the informant was Schiff,\u201d Trump proclaimed at a Cabinet meeting Monday. \u201cIt could be Shifty Schiff. In my opinion, it\u2019s possibly Schiff.\u201d (Lest you have doubts about irony\u2019s demise, Trump issued this defamation three days after signing a \u201cNational Character Counts Week\u201d proclamation endorsing \u201chonesty,\u201d \u201cintegrity\u201d and \u201crespect for others.\u201d)\n\nDemocrats quickly tabled the resolution in a party-line vote, 218 to 185. But it was an instructive exercise, for it represented the essence of the Republican anti-impeachment strategy. Trump urged Republicans on Monday to \u201cget tougher and fight\u201d on impeachment, but there is no good defense of Trump on the merits in the Ukraine dirt-for-dollars scandal (nor, for that matter, in his willy-nilly pullout from Syria, nor his attempt to award himself the Group of Seven conference). Instead, Republicans complain about process: Schiff is unfair! The proceedings are too secretive! Democrats are ignoring precedents! As The Post\u2019s congressional expert Paul Kane observed last week: \u201cWhen having trouble arguing the facts, you go straight into a full-frontal attack on the process.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAlas, for Republicans, the facts are against them on the process, too. Compare what\u2019s happening now with what happened before and during the Clinton impeachment:\n\nAD\n\nWhen Trump staff chief Mick Mulvaney is called to appear before the impeachment inquiry \u2014 a subpoena is imminent, I\u2019m told \u2014 Republicans will howl, as they have before, about the probe\u2019s improper intrusion into White House deliberations. But during their endless probes of the Clinton administration, Republicans hauled in three chiefs of staff (Mack McLarty, Erskine Bowles and John Podesta) and a dozen other senior White House officials \u2014 many testifying without protection of executive privilege.\n\nRepublicans are outraged that the inquiry is taking depositions in closed sessions rather than public hearings. Biggs, accusing the Democrats of operating \u201cStalin-esque, Soviet-style\u201d hearings, sent a letter signed by 76 other Republicans protesting \u201csecrecy.\u201d But Republicans didn\u2019t find it \u201cStalin-esque\u201d when they hauled 141 Clinton administration officials in for 568 hours of similar private depositions.\n\nRepublicans were outraged that Democrats allowed a staff lawyer to interview a witness, Trump adviser Corey Lewandowski. This complaint, too, might carry more weight if GOP investigators hadn\u2019t approved the same technique to question Clinton administration officials Janet Reno and Louis J. Freeh.\n\nRepublicans are seeking to censure Schiff for, they say, mischaracterizing a rough transcript. But during the Clinton probes, a Republican committee chairman, Dan Burton (R-Ind.), called Clinton a \u201c scumbag \u201d and released selectively edited interview transcripts that omitted exculpatory information. Though Burton fired an aide (David Bossie, later a Trump adviser), he received no reprimand for doctoring transcripts.\n\nIrony is dead, but hypocrisy predeceased it.\n\nAnd so there was House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) on Fox News last week saying \u201cyou have a better chance of getting a fair justice system in China\u201d than under \u201cknown liar\u201d Schiff.\n\nAnd there, on Fox News on Monday, was Biggs, ringleader of the Schiff censure, reciting a list of procedural complaints about due process, transparency, copies of transcripts and the presence of counsel. Schiff \u201cis not a fair arbiter,\u201d Biggs protested.\n\nAD\n\nOn the same show, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) continued the complaint. \u201cWe can\u2019t see the transcripts,\u201d he protested, saying the censure resolution was to \u201chighlight just how unfair the process is.\u201d\n\nThese may be the only arguments Republicans can make in Trump\u2019s defense. But when you\u2019re complaining about process, you\u2019re losing.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Republicans are complaining about process.
