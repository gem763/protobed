Like many major automakers, Nissan counts the country as its single-biggest market, contributing almost a third of its operating income in recent years. The executive joined Nissan from Nissho Iwai Corp. in 2003, and has curried the favor of Renault because of his collaboration with the French automaker on joint procurement, the people said.\n\nKnown for his overseas experience, Uchida has also worked for Renault Samsung in South Korea. He studied theology at Doshisha University, an unusual background for someone in the auto industry.\n\nThe Nissan board had been under pressure to select a new leader at a critical time for Nissan, which reported decade-low profits and announced 12,500 job cuts as it seeks to turn itself around. Auto sales are decelerating across the globe and new technologies from self-driving cars to electrification are disrupting the industry.\n\n\u201cThere is restructuring to be done at home and abroad, new vehicle development needs to speed up, while management coordination with Renault and efforts to improve profitability are in disarray,\u2019 Koji Endo, an analyst at SBI Securities Co., said before the news of the appointments. \u201cThere are so many things to do.\u201d\n\nGupta was one of the contenders for the top job favored by Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard, given that he\u2019s been seen as a supporter of the three-carmaker alliance. He was born in Dehradun, India, and graduated from Jawaharlal Nehru Engineering College, India, and obtained a diploma from INSEAD, the French business school.\n\nThe 49-year-old started his career in 1992 in engineering and purchasing in the private sector and later moved to management positions with Honda Motor Co. in India and in Japan in 1996. In 2006, Gupta became general manager of purchasing at Renault India in Mumbai, and in 2008 moved to the Renault Nissan Purchasing Organization in France as global supplier account manager for braking systems.\n\n(Adds details about new CEO from second paragraph.)\n\n--With assistance from Ania Nussbaum and Reed Stevenson.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Masatsugu Horie in Tokyo at mhorie3@bloomberg.net;Kae Inoue in Tokyo at kinoue@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Young-Sam Cho at ycho2@bloomberg.net, Tara Patel, Kenneth Wong\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Nissan Motor Co. named the head of its China joint venture as chief executive officer, as the Japanese carmaker looks to heal divisions caused by its former chairman\u2019s arrest and repair fraught relations with partner Renault SA.Makoto Uchida, 53, will work alongside Ashwani Gupta from", "authors": ["Masatsugu Horie", "Kae Inoue"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
