the first-half penalty that enabled Manchester United to take a firm grip of their Europa League qualifying group.\n\nIt was a tough test for the Reds in a hostile atmosphere \u2013 but Martial marked his return from injury by scoring the penalty that claimed all three points.\n\nIt was his first start since he damaged a hamstring in the 2-1 defeat by Crystal Palace in late August.\n\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer's side were forced to dig deep by the spirited Serbians but tasted success on their travels for the first time since March last year after an 11-game winless run on all competitions.\n\nHere's 9 talking points from Belgrade.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\n1) New system stays\n\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer stuck with the system which he introduced at Liverpool on Sunday.\n\nUnited lined up with three central defenders and Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Brandon Williams pushing further forward on either flank to provide their width.\n\nThey largely looked solid, but Partizan Belgrade did have their moments, particularly early in the second half as Soumah found space in between the midfield and defence to create some openings for the hosts.\n\nWhilst the formation worked against Liverpool at the weekend, sticking with the extra defender seemed something of a waste against lesser opposition, as United legend Paul Scholes underlined at half-time.\n\n(Image: SRDJAN SUKI/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\n\"I just wonder whether it's a game for three centre-halves today,\" Scholes questioned on BT Sport.\n\n\"I think against Liverpool, with three quality attackers, you can understand, but tonight it seems like a bit of a waste.\"\n\nSolskjaer later switched to four at the back, introducing Daniel James and Marcus Rashford in a bid to achieve more of a counter-attacking outlet.\n\nBut will this be Solskjaer's preferred system moving forwards?\n\n2) McTominay more advanced\n\nAn interesting change to the United setup was the use of Scott McTominay in a more advanced role.\n\nThe popular Scot took over the roles filed Fred at the weekend, with James Garner sitting deeper as a bridge between the back line and midfield as McTominay did on Sunday.\n\nMcTominay rarely has a bad game, and his energy and drive brought something to United's side as it always does.\n\nBut he lacked quality in the final third, something probably not surprising given he has just three goals in his senior career.\n\n(Image: SRDJAN SUKI/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nMcTominay missed the best chance of the first half when he failed to convert a delightful Juan Mata free-kick into an opening goal as he miscued his header.\n\nHe also fired a shot well wide after working some space on the edge of the box.\n\nNot exactly clinical, and whilst he has a part to play, he did not look the man United needed to solve their problems breaking teams dow.\n\n3) Garner makes full debut\n\nYoung midfielder James Garner was finally handed his full Manchester United debut by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.\n\nThe teenager, highly-rated at Old Trafford and dubbed the next Michael Carrick, was handed his debut as a late substitute against Crystal Palace last season.\n\nBut having been in and around the first team squad since Solskjaer's arrival, he has found game time hard to come by.\n\nThat changed in Belgrade as he was thrown in for his first senior start, showing plenty of promise at the base of a midfield three.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nGarner largely looked to keep things simple, and whilst he did not have a major impact on the game, he didn't do too much wrong either.\n\nHe was asked to play a relatively difficult role with McTominay pushed further forward, and he did so with confidence\n\nYou sense this is the first of many appearances for the youngster.\n\n4) Lack of creativity continues\n\nManchester United's lack of attacking creativity continues to be a problem.\n\nThey needed an Anthony Martial penalty, after a clumsy challenge on Brandon Williams, to break the deadlock.\n\nAnd, in reality, it was the only time they really looked like scoring.\n\nAlarmingly, Martial's goal from 12 yards was their first shot on target in the Europa League in over two hours of action after their drab 0-0 draw with AZ Alkmaar last time out.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nIt was also their first goal away from home since August in all competitions.\n\nAlthough he got on the scoresheet, Martial experienced a tough return to the starting line-up, going missing for most of the first half and eventually being replaced by Marcus Rashford just before the hour mark.\n\nJesse Lingard's ongoing drought without a goal or assist also continues, whilst Juan Mata's impact was limited.\n\nThere is no doubt attacking reinforcements and more creativity are a must for Solskjaer in January.\n\n5) Energetic performance from Williams\n\nBrandon Williams made his second Europa League start at left-back - and he was again a bright spark.\n\nThe energetic youngster was largely left alone on the left flank with nobody out wide in front of him.\n\nBut he patrolled up and down with plenty of energy, and you'd imagine there can't have been many on the Belgrade pitch who covered more ground.\n\n(Image: Manchester United via Getty Imag)\n\nIt was his burst forward into the box which resulted in him being fouled to win United's penalty which ultimately separated the two sides.\n\nHe was also solid when asked questions defensively, and he looks like a player capable of slotting into Solskjaer's first team plans without any real concerns moving forwards.\n\n6) Partizan's fans made it a red-hot night\n\nPartizan's club song is a reworking of the Pink Floyd classic 'Another Brick in the Wall' - and the home fans produced a deafening wall of sound that would have even had some of United's most experienced players shaking in their boots.\n\nForget all the hype that nothing beats a Premier League ground for atmosphere.\n\nThere were no more than 32,000 fans packed into the decrepit open-air stadium \u2013 and the place was absolutely bouncing.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nThink of Anfield on a big European night. Times that by 10 \u2013 and you might just get close. It was raw, it was raucous \u2013 and it was life affirming.\n\nEngland may boast the best league in the world, but the game has lost something over the last 25 years as ticket prices have allowed the middle classes to take over.\n\n7) Maguire needs time to settle\n\nHarry Maguire captained United for the first time \u2013 but the world's most experienced defender is struggling to live up to his \u00a380million price-tag.\n\nThe centre-back was given an uncomfortable night by Partizan's blisteringly quick Nigerian striker Umar Sadiq.\n\n(Image: SRDJAN SUKI/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nIt doesn't help Maguire that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is constantly changing his defence, both in terms of personnel and formation.\n\nUnited went with three men at the back in Belgrade, with Phil Jones and Marcos Rojo either side of their skipper.\n\nBut Maguire constantly found himself exposed by the pace and trickery of 22-year-old Sadiq.\n\n8) Europa looks Ole's best chance of a Champions League return\n\nJose Mourinho used Europe's minor club competition to plot a path back into the Euro elite by winning the competition in 2017.\n\nAnd with United currently paying the price for some inconsistent results by finding themselves in the lower reaches of the table, it seems Solskjaer may have to do the same.\n\n(Image: SRDJAN SUKI/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nPartizan were unbeaten in 11 home games in Europe \u2013 until they ran into a United team that has now won 10 and drawn four of 14 Europa League games stretching back to November 2016.\n\nThey now sit at the top of group L after beating Astana and Partizan either side of a goalless draw at AZ Alkmaar.\n\n9) Martial can ease burden on Rashford\n\nUnited's decision to sell Romelu Lukaku and allow Alexis Sanchez to join the Belgian on loan at Inter Milan has left United with a shortage of options up front.\n\nThat weakness was exposed when Anthony Martial suffered a hamstring strain against Crystal Palace in August to leave Ole Gunnar Solskjaer rellying heavily on Marcus Rashford.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nRashford returned to form with a smart strike against Liverpool at the weekend, but has looked jaded at times and has struggled with slight muscle strains.\n\nMartial returned in Serbia to score from the penalty spot before being replaced by Rashford on the hour.\n\nBut the Frenchman must now stay fit if United are going to have a successful season.", "description": "Man Utd tasted victory on their travels for the first time since March as they edged a 1-0 win over Partizan Belgrade", "authors": ["Simon Mullock", "Rich Jones", "Image", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Srdjan Suki Epa-Efe Rex", "Manchester United Via Getty Imag", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20717666.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FBL-EUR-C3-PARTIZAN-MAN-UTD.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
