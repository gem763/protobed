Necklace by Agmes.\n\nOn an early fall afternoon at a dry-pot restaurant in the East Village, the critic Andrea Long Chu is talking about herself, which is, by her account, one of her favorite things to do. So is numbing her notoriously sharp tongue with Sichuan peppercorns, and, as she raises a quail egg to her lips, it seems she may even be feeling something akin to happiness \u2014 not a sensation she experiences very often, as her following on Twitter is well aware. Her feed is a font of grotesque self-loathing. She writes about her suicidal tendencies and her desperation to be hot in the same irreverent style she used to ridicule Jill Soloway (\u201ca rich Los Angeles creative type with a child\u2019s knack for exploiting the sympathies of others\u201d) and Bret Easton Ellis (\u201can angry, uninteresting man who has just written a very needy book\u201d) in a recent pair of devastating book reviews. \u201cI cannot stress to you how humiliating it is to be literally incapable of keeping my pants up bc my belly is too fat and my ass is too flat,\u201d she tweeted recently. \u201cIt\u2019s like getting misgendered every second of the day.\u201d\n\nBut her sadness isn\u2019t just a bit. A little less than a year ago, in a New York Times op-ed about her plans to undergo surgery to \u201cget a vagina,\u201d Chu made a provocative claim that angered some trans advocates: She did not expect the painful, expensive procedure to make her happy. Still, Chu insisted, she had the right to get it whether it cured her dysphoria or not. Nearly a year after the surgery, she says she\u2019s feeling more miserable than she\u2019d expected. \u201cIt\u2019s perversely vindicating,\u201d she adds with a wry smile. Dressed in a jumpsuit patterned with blue-and-white flowers, she brushes a curtain of curls away from her face with a flip of her wrist, revealing a tattoo of a geometric vulva on the underside of her forearm. \u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous to get what you want.\u201d\n\nThis is the sort of statement \u2014 darkly funny, intensely personal, daringly poised between profundity and trolling \u2014 that has made Chu one of the most exciting critics working today. A 26-year-old Ph.D. student in the comp-lit department at NYU, she entered the mainstream last winter with an essay for n+1, \u201cOn Liking Women,\u201d in which she challenged the central tenet of trans discourse on the left. \u201cI am trying to tell you something that few of us dare to talk about, especially in public, especially when we are trying to feel political: not the fact, boringly obvious to those of us living it, that many trans women wish they were cis women, but the darker, more difficult fact that many trans women wish they were women, period.\u201d The piece had its critics, but many hailed it as a revelation. Sandy Stone, the artist and academic credited with establishing the field of trans studies, praised Chu for launching the discipline\u2019s more forthright second wave, a breakthrough she never dreamed she\u2019d live to see. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ve died and gone to trans heaven,\u201d she wrote on Facebook. As Chu sees it, the first wave of trans studies was largely a defense against those who claimed real women are those born with a vagina. \u201cMy work begins with a frustration about how that defensiveness has calcified into a trope,\u201d she explains.\n\nIt\u2019s very dangerous to get what you want.\n\nIn her first book, Females, out later this month, she posits a new theory about gender and sexuality, starting with the contention that \u201ceveryone is female.\u201d (\u201cI get criticized for projecting a lot,\u201d she says dryly.) In Chu\u2019s usage, female is a \u201cuniversal existential condition,\u201d defined by submitting to someone else\u2019s desires. For example, even if you conceive of yourself as an alpha male who likes to top in bed, the desire to dominate is ultimately its own form of submission. \u201cA top,\u201d says Chu, \u201cis just a bottom folded into another shape.\u201d So why does she insist on calling a universal condition \u201cfemale\u201d? \u201cBecause everyone already does,\u201d she writes. Women are the \u201cselect delegates\u201d of this state of being.\n\nGrowing up in Asheville, North Carolina, Chu was \u201cwell trained in repression.\u201d Her parents were conservative Presbyterians. \u201cLots of praying in public,\u201d she recalls. Her father, a doctor, is half-Chinese, but his ethnic identity, as Chu sees it, was repressed as well. \u201cI don\u2019t think he would even refer to himself as a person of color,\u201d she says. One of the few places she felt free was onstage. She played villains and fools in high-school musicals (\u201cNever the romantic lead\u201d) and studied theater and theory at Duke; she decided to apply to grad school when a professor in a cultural-studies class told her to. (She still loves performing: Once, while giving a talk, she put a remote-controlled vibrator in her pants and asked one of the audience members to press the button as many times as the person liked.)\n\nChu was 23, a couple of years into her Ph.D. studies and in the midst of a breakup with a girlfriend, when she felt compelled to transition. Within a week, she\u2019d bought her first bra. She wasn\u2019t \u201ccoming out of the closet\u201d after years of consciously (or unconsciously) hiding; the desire to be a woman descended upon her suddenly, like \u201ca tongue of fire or an infection,\u201d as she writes in Females, and she acted on it with uncharacteristic speed. It was \u201ceasily the most impulsive thing I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d she says.\n\nFor Chu, the East Village is saturated with warm memories of that time, the kind you get when you fall in love. She takes me by the Buffalo Exchange where she sold off her men\u2019s clothes. We linger in front of her old apartment where she first emerged into the world dressed in women\u2019s clothing. She was headed to dinner with a friend that night, wearing a red mesh skirt and sleeveless cream turtleneck with vertical stripes. A group of people was sitting on the steps, and she braced herself for a reaction, but everyone just shifted slightly to let her pass. \u201cIt was the happiest I\u2019ve ever been,\u201d she says of the weeks after she transitioned. \u201cIt was like having a crush on myself.\u201d\n\nSnapping out of her reverie, she sighs and adds, \u201cNow I\u2019m just in a sexless marriage with myself.\u201d As she describes it, the root of all her unhappiness \u2014 the reason she believes there\u2019s no \u201ccure\u201d for gender \u00addysphoria \u2014 is that she will never be able to fulfill her deepest desire, which is not just to be a woman but to have always been one. \u201cIf I were to unleash the full force of dysphoria onto a conversation partner, it would be Lovecraftian in the scale of horror,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt would be like an indescribable, tentacular nightmare.\u201d And yet she\u2019s almost amused by the tragedy of it. After all, our endless striving in the face of certain failure is an essential part of what it means not to be trans but to be human. \u201cWe tell ourselves the object compels us. This person will give me what I wanted, this job, this belief, this breakup,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it\u2019s desire itself that compels us. It is by nature gratuitous and without purpose. The infinite desire to desire.\u201d\n\n*A version of this article appears in the October 14, 2019, issue of New York Magazine.
