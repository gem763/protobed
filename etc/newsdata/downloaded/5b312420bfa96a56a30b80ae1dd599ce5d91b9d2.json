In that call, he urged an investigation involving Joe Biden and his son's ties to an energy company in the country -- specifically, Biden's successful efforts as vice president to oust a prosecutor who was investigating that company. Democrats claim Biden's intervention was driven by corruption concerns and that Trump improperly pushed Ukraine's government to investigate a political opponent, using U.S. aid as a cudgel.\n\nIMPEACHMENT PROBE RAPIDLY WIDENS AS DEMS FIRE OFF SUBPOENAS, SET TESTIMONY\n\nBut Trump and top Republicans have been pushing back aggressively, trying to turn the impeachment probe to their advantage by presenting the probe as the latest conspiracy drummed up by Democrats and their media allies unhappy at his 2016 win. Recent fundraising reports from the Trump re-election campaign and related groups indicate the issue is driving a surge in donations.\n\n\"They lost the election, now they want to steal this one -- don't let them,\" an ad by Trump's 2020 campaign said.\n\nThe image of the 2016 election map is one of a number of politically provocative statements Trump has made within the last week. He has doubled down on his claim that his phone call was \u201cperfect,\u201d branded the whistleblower who submitted a complaint about the call \u201cfake,\u201d and called on House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., to resign for his \u201cparody\u201d of Trump\u2019s words at a House hearing.\n\nHe also sparked outrage by quoting Pastor Robert Jeffress, who predicted on Fox News that if Trump was impeached, it would cause a \u201cCivil War like fracture in this Nation from which our country will never heal.\u201d This drew some criticism from members of his own party, with Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., calling it \"beyond repugnant.\"\n\nA Trump impeachment push is highly unlikely to succeed, requiring a two-thirds majority to convict in the Republican-controlled Senate. But the push could have a significant effect one way or another on the 2020 election in the way it rallies the parties\u2019 bases, and the effect it has on independents and moderates.\n\nAs polls show support for impeachment creeping up nationally and it becomes a rallying cry for the Democratic Party base, Republicans are banking that the impeachment push will also act as a shot in the arm for their own base, while turning off moderates who care more about kitchen-table issues like health care and immigration.\n\nThe Republican National Committee launched a \u201cStop the Madness\u201d counter-impeachment campaign Monday, targeting House Democrats and vowing to cause havoc going into 2020.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to cause chaos,\u201d RNC spokesman Rick Gorka said. \u201cThis is a poison pill. When you couple the impeachment process with the socialist policies being espoused by 2020 Democrats, it\u2019s going to sink their chances at the ballot box, especially with those crucial swing voters and independents across the country.\u201d\n\nThere are signs already that the impeachment push is a potential fundraising boon for Trump and his allies. Republican officials said the Trump campaign, along with the RNC, brought in $5 million in the 24 hours after Pelosi\u2019s announcement. National Republican Congressional Committee officials also said its online fundraising soared by 608 percent on the day Pelosi announced the inquiry.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nMeanwhile, WinRed -- a new GOP fundraising platform targeting small-dollar donations -- hauled in just over $30 million in the third fundraising quarter, driven by a surge over the last week.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News, WinRed\u2019s President Gerrit Lansing said fundraising numbers spiked after the inquiry was announced.\n\n\u201cIt just poured gas on the situation where there is a ton of money being raised in all levels and all campaigns,\u201d Lansing said.\n\nFox News' Brooke Singman and Alex Pappas contributed to this report.", "description": "President Trump on Tuesday dared Congress to impeach him over the Ukraine controversy, posting an image of a deep-red 2016 election map in an implicit suggestion that Democrats are threatening to overturn the will of the voters\u00a0-- as he and his allies try to go on offense over the impeachment probe.", "authors": ["Adam Shaw"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/30/694940094001_6090784407001_6090774861001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
