The automaker plans to launch an all-electric car every year over the next five years. By 2025, it wants all-electric vehicles to represent 50% of global sales with the rest compromised by hybrids.\n\nAs of this year, every new Volvo launched will be electrified, which means it could be a hybrid, plug-in electric (PHEV) or all-electric (BEV) vehicle.\n\nTo hit this target, every Volvo model will include a Recharge option. This means a plug-in hybrid or all-electric version will be available, according to the company. To further encourage electric driving, every Volvo Recharge plug-in hybrid model will come with free electricity for a year, provided through a refund for the average electricity cost during that period.\n\nVolvo also plans to triple its manufacturing capacity and is now quickly ramping up its production globally, Bj\u00f6rn Annwall, head of global commercial operations at Volvo, said during the press conference. Volvo is aiming for plug-in hybrid cars to make up 20% of total sales in 2020.\n\nCarbon footprint\n\nThe company\u2019s bid to reduce the carbon footprint of the lifecycle of its cars 40% between 2018 and 2025 will affect every aspect of how these vehicles are made as well as its suppliers.\n\nToday, the supply chain makes up for one-third of the total carbon footprint throughout the lifecycle of a new vehicle, according to CTO Henrik Green. But switching to electrified vehicles to reduce tailpipe emissions increases the total lifecycle footprint of vehicles by two thirds primarily due to battery cell manufacturing.\n\n\u201cThis is an industry challenge,\u201d Green said, adding that lawmakers, utilities, automakers and battery cell manufacturers need to collaborate.\n\nVolvo is targeting its supply chain to help it hit its goal as well as moving more towards renewable energy for its power. Reducing waste and standardizing materials to support recycling, are also key to making the company more sustainable, according to Green.\n\nGas-powered spinout\n\nVolvo isn\u2019t ditching combustion engines completely. But it\u2019s distancing itself from them by spinning it out.\n\nVolvo Cars and its Chinese parent company Geely Holdings will merge their existing combustion engine operations into a standalone business. The move will \u201cclear the way for Volvo Cars to focus on the development of its all-electric range of premium cars,\u201d Samuelsson said.\n\n\u201cSo we believe we will bring sustainability into our company, not as something to add on, because it\u2019s good or something that is expected for us,\u201d Samuelsson said. \u201cWe bring it into the company because we think it\u2019s really good for our business. It will make our company grow faster it will make our company stronger exactly as safety made Volvo stronger.\u201d", "description": "Volvo Cars used the unveiling of the XC40 Recharge, its first electric vehicle, to lay out an ambitious business strategy that includes introducing out a new EV every year through 2025 and slashing the carbon footprint of the lifecycle of every car and SUV it builds by 40%.
