It would need to produce 105,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter to meet its guidance of 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles this year.\n\nLinda Nazar, a professor at the University of Waterloo who works on electrochemical energy storage, said it makes sense for Tesla to invest in batteries.\n\n\u201cA (conventional) car company would be invested heavily in its combustion engine,\u201d said Nazar. \u201cThere is no engine in an electric vehicle, just a battery and a motor.\u201d\n\nSince 2015, Tesla has had a research partnership with Dalhousie University in Halifax, where professor Jeff Dahn is working to improve energy density and performance in batteries.\n\nIn August, Dahn and his team of researchers at Dalhousie published a paper in the Journal of the Electrochemical Society, laying out how a battery that utilizes a new lithium-ion chemistry \u201cshould be able to power an electric vehicle for over 1.6 million kilometres (1 million miles)\u201d \u2014 about double the current capacity of a Tesla battery, and what would be an industry leading capacity.\n\nMaynard Um, an analyst at Macquarie Research who covers Tesla, wrote in a note last year that electric vehicles have many fewer parts \u2014 \u201ceffectively basic motors and gearboxes\u201d \u2014 when compared to conventional automobiles.\n\nThat\u2019s lowered the barriers for new companies to enter the market, he wrote.\n\n\u201cThat said, Tesla\u2019s manufacturing hiccups show that there are some levels of manufacturing experience that are necessary to get to volumes,\u201d Um wrote.\n\n\u2022 Email: gfriedman@nationalpost.com | Twitter: GabeFriedz", "description": "Richmond Hill-based Hibar Systems Ltd., which specializes in building 'complex high speed integrated battery assembly lines,' now a subsidiary of Tesla", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/tesla.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
