(OSK:TSX. \"Osisko\" or the \"Corporation\") is pleased to provide new drilling results from the ongoing definition and expansion drill program at its 100% owned Windfall gold project located in the Abitibi greenstone belt, Urban Township, Eeyou Istchee James Bay, Qu\u00e9bec.\n\nThe program is currently focused on infill drilling and expansion drilling at the Lynx deposit, exploration on the main mineralized zones, and deep exploration in the central areas of the mineralized intrusive system. Sixteen drills are active at Lynx and Triple Lynx, with another seven drills conducting infill and exploration drilling on other areas of the deposit.\n\nExpansion drilling in Lynx Extension intersected 14.3 g/t Au over 5.9 metres in hole OSK-W-19-1992-W1, 200 meters down plunge from the nearest intersection, 33.4 g/t Au over 3.7 metres (see Osisko news release dated June 3, 2019) and 550 metres from the nearest resource wireframe.\n\nOsisko President and Chief Executive Officer John Burzynski commented: \u201cThe Lynx zones have delivered outstanding results for us, especially the expansion step-outs which continue to significantly grow our zones and demonstrate good continuity. With all three zones remaining open down-plunge, we will continue both infill and expansion drilling to add ounces in all categories for the resource update.\u201d\n\nSignificant new analytical results from 73 intercepts in 15 drill holes and 28 wedges from surface focused on Lynx infill and expansion drilling are presented below. Additionally, 20 intercepts in 14 underground drill holes focused infill drilling, including the Lynx bulk sample area, are included in the table below.\n\nHighlights from new drilling results include: 284 g/t Au over 3.2 metres in OSK-W-18-1550; 453 g/t Au over 2.0 metres in WST-19-0202; 288 g/t Au over 2.0 metres in OSK-W-19-1949-W2; 30.8 g/t Au over 11.9 metres in OSK-W-19-1857-W6; 61.6 g/t Au over 4.1 metres in OSK-W-19-1681; 95.5 g/t Au over 2.2 metres in WST-19-0154; 49.4 g/t Au over 4.2 metres in OSK-W-19-1963-W4; 27.5 g/t Au over 7.1 metres in OSK-W-19-1963-W3; and 37.2 g/t Au over 4.7 metres in WST-19-0124.

(OGQ 800), Project Manager of Osisko's Windfall Lake gold project, who is a \"qualified person\" as defined by National Instrument 43-101 \u2013 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\").\n\nQuality Control and Reporting Protocols\n\nTrue width determination is estimated at 55-80% of the reported core length interval for the zone. Assays are uncut except where indicated. Intercepts occur within geological confines of major zones but have not been correlated to individual vein domains at this time. Reported intervals include minimum weighted averages of 3.0 g/t Au diluted over core lengths of at least 2.0 metres. All NQ core assays reported were obtained by either 1-kilogram screen fire assay or standard 50-gram fire-assaying-AA finish or gravimetric finish at (i) ALS Laboratories in Val d'Or, Qu\u00e9bec, Thunder Bay, Ontario, Sudbury, Ontario or Vancouver, British Colombia, or (ii) Bureau Veritas in Timmins, Ontario. The 1-kilogram screen assay method is selected by the geologist when samples contain coarse gold or present a higher percentage of pyrite than surrounding intervals. Selected samples are also analyzed for multi-elements, including silver, using an Aqua Regia-ICP-AES method at ALS Laboratories. Drill program design, Quality Assurance/Quality Control (\"QA/QC\") and interpretation of results is performed by qualified persons employing a QA/QC program consistent with NI 43-101 and industry best practices. Standards and blanks are included with every 20 samples for QA/QC purposes by the Corporation as well as the lab. Approximately 5% of sample pulps are sent to secondary laboratories for check assay.\n\nAbout the Windfall Lake Gold Deposit\n\nThe Windfall Lake gold deposit is located between Val-d'Or and Chibougamau in the Abitibi region of Qu\u00e9bec, Canada. The mineral resource defined by Osisko, as disclosed in the Windfall Lake Technical Report (as defined below) and November 27, 2018 Lynx resource update, comprises 2,874,000 tonnes at 8.17 g/t Au (754,000 ounces) in the indicated mineral resource category and 10,352,000 tonnes at 7.11 g/t Au (2,366,000 ounces) in the inferred mineral resource category. For details regarding the key assumptions, parameters and methods used to estimate the mineral resources presented in respect of the Windfall Lake gold project, please see the technical report entitled \"Technical Report and Mineral Resource Estimate for the Windfall Lake Project, Windfall Lake and Urban-Barry Properties\" and dated June 12, 2018 (effective date of May 14, 2018), which has been prepared by InnovExplo Inc. from Val-d'Or, Qu\u00e9bec (the \"Windfall Lake Technical Report\") and the press release \u201cOsisko Releases Mineral Resource Update for Lynx\u201d dated November 27, 2018, which has been prepared by Osisko and reviewed and approved by Micon International, Ltd. from Toronto, Ontario. The Windfall Lake Technical Report and press release are available on Osisko's website at www.osiskomining.com and on SEDAR under Osisko's issuer profile at www.sedar.com . The Windfall Lake gold deposit is currently one of the highest-grade resource-stage gold projects in Canada. Mineralization occurs in four principal zones: Lynx, Zone 27, Caribou and Underdog. All zones comprise sub-vertical lenses following intrusive porphyry contacts plunging to the northeast. The deposit is well defined from surface to a depth of 900 metres and remains open along strike and at depth. Mineralization has been identified 30 metres from surface in some areas and as deep as 2,000 metres in others, with significant potential to extend mineralization down-plunge and at depth.\n\nAbout Osisko Mining Inc.\n\nOsisko is a mineral exploration company focused on the acquisition, exploration, and development of precious metal resource properties in Canada. Osisko holds a 100% interest in the high-grade Windfall Lake gold deposit located between Val-d'Or and Chibougamau in Qu\u00e9bec and holds a 100% undivided interest in a large area of claims in the surrounding the Urban Barry area and nearby Qu\u00e9villon area (over 2,700 square kilometres).\n\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information\n\nThis news release contains \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of the applicable Canadian securities legislation that is based on expectations, estimates, projections and interpretations as at the date of this news release.
