President Trump in a July 25 call repeatedly asks Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to contact Giuliani and seeks an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\n'I have heard on numerous occasions disturbing allegations by Rudy Giuliani about corruption in Ukraine and the many improprieties surrounding the firing of former Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin,' said Graham in a statement and on Twitter.\n\n'Given the House of Representatives\u2019 behavior, it is time for the Senate to inquire about corruption and other improprieties involving Ukraine. Therefore I will offer to Mr. Giuliani the opportunity to come before the Senate Judiciary Committee to inform the Committee of his concerns,' he wrote.\n\nSenate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham said it was time for the Senate to inquire about 'corruption and other improprieties involving Ukraine'\n\nGiuliani is a regular guest on cable TV, and now could get to try speaking under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee\n\nThe Trump administration refused to let U.S. ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland to testify to the House on Tuesday\n\nGraham's statement came after Trump ripped the Intel panel as a 'kangaroo court,' saying he would otherwise 'love' for Sondland to cooperate.\n\n'I would love to send Ambassador Sondland, a really good man and great American, to testify, but unfortunately he would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court, where Republican\u2019s rights have been taken away, and true facts are not allowed out for the public,' the president Tweeted.\n\nGraham did not make any reference to his committee investigating a whistle-blower's allegations that President Trump abused his office by pushing the Ukrainians to investigate a political opponent.\n\nGraham is a frequent golf partner of president Trump's who on Monday called the president's sudden decision to withdraw troops from Syria amid a looming Turkish invasion 'a stain on America's honor' and 'a disaster in the making.'\n\nGiuliani told CNN he will still have to deal with matters of 'privilege.'\n\n'I might be able to do it without discussing privileged information,' he said.\n\nGiuliani has repeatedly pushed a narrative that Vice President Joe Biden pushed for the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor in order to help his son, Hunter. Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company and was being paid a reported $50,000 per month. But there has been no evidence Hunter Biden was ever under investigation, and a variety of western bodies also wanted the former prosecutor to go for failing to root out corruption in Ukraine.\n\nThe House Committees of Foreign Affairs, Oversight, and Intelligence committees issued a subpoena f Giuliani to hand over communications and records.", "description": "Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham said he has invited the president's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani to testify due to the 'behavior' of the House of Representatives.", "authors": ["Geoff Earle", "Deputy U.S. Political Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/15/19432140-0-image-a-17_1570546318179.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
