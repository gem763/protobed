They often won and lost in bunches, which is now where they sit in this World Series against the Washington Nationals.\n\nThe Astros had three three-game losing streaks, a seven-game losing streak and a five-game losing streak. They also had two 10-game winning streaks and an eight-game winning streak. All of which is to say, losing two games in a row isn\u2019t exactly new territory for them.\n\nThe stakes, maybe. But not what may have to come next. If the Astros are in a dry spell, this could be over. But if they get hot for Friday\u2019s Game 3, as the series shifts to D.C., they could just as easily win four in a row.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\u201cYou go through stretches throughout the season where you don't swing the bat or pitch or play defense the way you want to play it,\u201d says star third baseman Alex Bregman. \u201cI think it takes one day to stop the bleeding. You play good one game, the bleeding stops. Panic stops. You start playing the way you want to play.\u201d\n\nThe Astros were the obvious favorite, and it was a surprise that they lost the first two games at home with aces Gerrit Cole and Justin Verlander on the mound. But they also faced Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg. Anibal Sanchez starting in Game 3 might provide some relief. The Astros, meanwhile, send Zack Greinke to the mound.\n\n\u201cWe were outplayed for two straight games,\u201d Bregman said. \u201cWe try and stop the bleeding [Friday]. And we stop the bleeding [Friday]. It's going to be a lot of fun the rest of the series. I think that's the biggest thing, just stop the bleeding.\u201d\n\nAlex Bregman, Jose Altuve and the Astros are looking to stop the bleeding in World Series Game 3.

That ends Friday.\n\nOn the same day as the first home World Series game in franchise history, their young star turns 21. Expect lots of chatter about it on the broadcast and on social media.\n\nWhen it's your 21st birthday AND the first home World Series game in franchise history pic.twitter.com/zP6a7Rq0gH \u2014 Yahoo Sports MLB (@MLByahoosports) October 25, 2019\n\nGame 3 pageantry\n\n\u2022 D.C.
