Julia Rose and Lauren Summer performed the act during the seventh inning of the contest. It was captured on camera.\n\nMLB must have quickly reviewed that footage, because Summer received a letter from the league Sunday night. USA Today was able to confirm MLB sent the letter.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nRose and Summer were banned for \u201cviolating the fan code,\u201d according to the note.\n\nThe two women claim they flashed Cole \u201cfor breast cancer.\u201d They also did it in order to promote their business, a digital magazine called Shagmag.\n\nSummer says the proceeds from Shagmag will go toward helping women with breast cancer pay off their medical bills.\n\nIf Rose and Summer were hoping to throw Cole off his game, the tactic didn\u2019t work. Cole walked Ryan Zimmerman on the next pitch, but then struck out Victor Robles to end the inning.\n\nCole was masterful during the start, giving up just one run over 7 innings during the Astros\u2019 7-1 win over the Washington Nationals. The Astros will head back to Houston with a 3-2 lead after dropping the first two games of the World Series.\n\nDue to their bans, Rose and Summer will not be at either game \u2014 if a Game 7 is necessary \u2014 in Houston.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nChris Cwik is a writer for Yahoo Sports.
