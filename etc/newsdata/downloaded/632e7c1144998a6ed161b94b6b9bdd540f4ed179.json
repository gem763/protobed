The report will come three days after ISM manufacturing data fell to its lowest level since June 2009 as global trade concerns weighed.\n\n\u201cGiven the broader trend of the manufacturing sector, essentially slowing down since the middle of last year, this is essentially a continuation of that,\u201d Torsten Slok, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities, told FOX Business. \u201cAnd given the trade war broke out in the middle of last year, the fear we have is the trade war is still playing the biggest role in weighing on the manufacturing sector at the moment.\u201d\n\nMost troubling, according to Slok, is that new export orders, which are a leading indicator, fell to 41, well below the 50 number that indicates the sector is in a recession.\n\n\u201cThe big picture is that manufacturing only makes up 10 percent of GDP and only makes up about 10 percent of employment,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo you could say, 'Well manufacturing is just a small share of the economy. What about the services sector, which is 90 percent of the economy? Shouldn\u2019t we worry more about services?' \" Slok said. \"But the fear we have is that it\u2019s unlikely that manufacturing can go into a relatively deep recession now without having any impact on the services sector.\u201d\n\nISM services bounced back in August after printing at an almost three-year low in July. The September reading is due out Thursday morning.\n\nEven if there is a slowdown in the economy, Slok thinks the U.S. will avoid a recession.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\n\u201cWe still feel that the economy will continue to just skate above a recession, but it\u2019s pretty clear that the risks to the downside and the recession risks have increased,\u201d he said.", "description": "", "authors": ["Jonathan Garber"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/08/0/0/Steel-Worker-iStock.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
