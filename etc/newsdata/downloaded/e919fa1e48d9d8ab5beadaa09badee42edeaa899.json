These agile, electrically powered scooters are the perfect way to cover short distances quickly and without harming the environment.\n\n\"The new E-Scooter in the Mercedes-Benz EQ brand family was developed in cooperation with the scooter specialist micro, and is specifically designed for the first or last mile, making it the perfect companion for those wanting flexible mobility solutions. Co-branded with micro, the Mercedes star and the EQ logo appear on the handlebar stem as a trademark for Electric Intelligence.\"\n\nThe firm didn't give any detail about the scooter's specs \u2014 its top speed, for example.\n\nIt also doesn't say where the scooters will be available, although the fact that the press statement mentions the legalization of scooters in Germany suggests that Mercedes' home market might be the launch country.\n\nRead more: 6 carmakers that are betting electric scooters and bikes \u2014 not cars \u2014 are the future of city transportation\n\nThe company also didn't release any full photos of the models, just two shots focusing on the scooters' wheels and the Mercedes-Benz logo. We can expect to see more of them relatively soon however, as the two-wheelers are slated for \"early 2020\" according to the press release.\n\nElectric scooters have flooded city streets around the world, in part thanks the rise of startups such as Bird and Lime, which are funded by billions of venture capital dollars. Some cities have struggled to cope with the sudden arrival of scooters, however, with regulators worried about the vehicles littering pavements and streets, fatal accidents, and people using the scooters while drunk, among other issues.\n\nMercedes is far from the first traditional automaker to tap into the electric scooter market. Audi, Volkswagen, and BMW have all brought out their own e-scooters.", "description": "Mercedes-Benz didn't give much detail about the new scooter, but said it would go on sale in 'early 2020.'", "authors": ["Isobel Asher Hamilton"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8200dd2e22af587a3894e4-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
