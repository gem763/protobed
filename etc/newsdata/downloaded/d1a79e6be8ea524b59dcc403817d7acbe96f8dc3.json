The IG\u2019s office said it \u201cremains concerned that Jordan is not able or willing to provide adequate care for working dogs\u201d without intervention by the U.S. \u201cand that any improvements that have been made were simply a reaction to pressure\u201d from U.S. officials.\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), in a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday, urged him to address the report\u2019s concerns and detail what actions will be taken to rectify problems with the multimillion-dollar program.\n\nOIG remains concerned that Jordan is not able or willing to provide adequate care for working dogs without the Department\u2019s intervention.\" Office of Inspector General\n\n\u201cIt is important for Congress to know whether the [Explosive Detection Canine Program] is operating effectively and efficiently and whether animals involved in the program are being treated according to the humane and ethical standards that the American people undoubtedly expect,\u201d Grassley said. \u201cThe best-trained dog in the world is still ill-equipped to protect American interests if it is sick or starving.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the State Department did not immediately respond to a HuffPost request for comment on Monday.\n\nA complaint to a hotline in July 2017 launched an evaluation of the EDC program the following May, according to the IG\u2019s report.\n\noversight.gov Photos taken in Jordan in 2017 show an underweight canine (left) and a canine needing its nails trimmed.\n\nThe review discovered instances of the canine handlers leaving food for the dogs on the floor, without bowls, in feces and dirt-covered kennels. Ticks were found embedded in the ears of some dogs, apparently for several days, and several of the animals were severely underweight. The majority of the dogs were also described as being well beyond their working years and in need of being retired and replaced immediately.\n\n\u201cSeveral canines were observed to have hip dysplasia and obvious arthritis, and have lost the will to work,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe report went into detail about two canine deaths. Zoe, a female Belgian Malinois, was 2 years old when sent to Jordan in October 2016. She died of a heat stroke nine months later while working along the Syrian border with a handler who had not been adequately trained, according to the report.\n\noversight.gov Zoe (left) and Mencey were among the dogs who died after being sent to Jordan as part of a U.S. State Department anti-terrorism program. Zoe died from a heat stroke less than a year after arriving in the country and Mencey died after contracting at least two diseases.\n\nMencey, a 3-year-old male Belgian Malinois, arrived in Jordan in July 2017, the same month that Zoe died. Less than a year after his arrival, Mencey became severely ill and was diagnosed with a tick-borne disease. He was eventually sent back to the U.S. for treatment and diagnosed with a second vector-borne disease that caused renal failure, leading to his euthanization in March 2018.\n\nDr. Karen Iovino, a veterinarian who until 2017 worked for a private firm that trains EDCs in Virginia, spoke out about the abuse allegations earlier this year after claiming to have received supporting evidence from a former colleague.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, we\u2019re sending dogs to an area of the world that has a lot of poverty and doesn\u2019t always see dogs or animals the way we do in the United States,\u201d she told News4 Washington. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to gift a dog to these countries, we\u2019ve gotta be sure they\u2019re taken care of.\u201d\n\nThe IG concluded in its report that Jordan\u2019s EDC program is unlikely to become self-sustaining and will require continuous State Department mentoring. It also cautioned that \u201cthe dogs are still at risk.\u201d\n\nThe IG supported its findings with help from the Winchester, Virginia-based Canine Validation Center, which recently started providing canine training to the State Department. The center compiled its own report and found, according to the IG, that \u201calthough the Jordanians are \u2018interested\u2019 in providing their canines the best care, the commanders and veterinary staff are not financially committed to providing or enforcing a dedicated, long-term preventative program.\u201d\n\nThe center also concluded that, because Jordanian officials believe they can rely on the State Department to provide products needed to ensure the dogs\u2019 well-being, \u201cthey appear reluctant to dedicate their own funds to a preventative care program,\u201d according to the IG report.\n\noversight.gov Athena was 2-years old when she arrived in Jordan in May 2017. Less than a year later she was found to be severely emaciated, and she returned to the U.S. in April 2018 for treatment. She made a full recovery. Her kennel with dirt and feces on the floor is shown on the right, along with a bowl that had no water.\n\nThe report declared that the ultimate responsibility for overseeing the EDC program lies with the State Department. And it found that, in addition to failing to guarantee the dogs\u2019 health and safety, the department routinely failed to secure written agreements from foreign partners that outline standards for minimum care and retirement of the animals.\n\nJordan has received more EDCs than any of the other nations named in the report \u2015 Egypt, Lebanon, Morocco, Nepal, and Oman. Though some health concerns were reported for the dogs in those countries, the problems did not match the severity of the ones found in Jordan.", "description": "At least 10 dogs have perished from medical problems.
