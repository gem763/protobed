(Stacy Zarin Goldberg for The Washington Post; food styling by Lisa Cherkasky for The Washington Post)\n\nI originally came up with this savory skillet pancake as a way to make a dent in the many pounds of zucchini a friend gifted me from her garden, but it is now a perennial favorite. In it, shredded zucchini, the star here, is mixed with just enough egg and flour to bind it into a tender pancake. The batter is poured into a skillet and then is baked, not fried, as zucchini pancakes tend to be, making it more healthful and far less messy than using the stove-top.\n\nThe trick to making the pancake tender \u2014 not soggy \u2014 is to salt the shredded zucchini a bit, let it drain for fifteen minutes, and then squeeze as much water out of it as possible. Don\u2019t be timid about the squeeze either \u2014 you want to put some hand pressure into it as it sits in a strainer \u2014 or you can put it into a cheesecloth and twist to expel the water that way.\n\nOnce baked, the pancake emerges from the oven golden and fragrant, ready to be dolloped with the most heavenly, creamy yogurt-feta sauce that\u2019s flecked with fresh dill. It makes for a wonderful brunch or lunch main course and can also be served as one of an array of small plates for dinner or a party.\n\nScale, print and rate the recipe in our Recipe Finder: Big Zucchini Pancake With Yogurt-Feta Sauce 6 servings In this savory skillet pancake, zucchini is the star, mixed with just enough egg and flour to bind it into a tender pancake. It is baked until golden and fragrant, ready to be dolloped with the most heavenly yogurt-feta sauce that\u2019s flecked with fresh dill. To avoid a soggy result, be sure to squeeze as much of the water out of the zucchini as possible. MAKE AHEAD: The pancake is best served just-cooked, but it can be made 1 to 2 days ahead and reheated in a 350 degree oven. The sauce may be made up to 3 days ahead and kept in an airtight container in the refrigerator. From nutritionist and cookbook author Ellie Krieger. For the sauce \u00bd cup plain Greek yogurt (whole milk or low-fat) \u2153 cup crumbled feta cheese (1\u00be ounces) 1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill fronds 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice \u00bd teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil \u00bd small clove garlic, finely grated or minced For the pancake 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for coating the pan 2 medium zucchini (1 pound total), coarsely grated \u00bd teaspoon kosher salt 2 large eggs \u00bd medium onion, coarsely grated and drained \u2153 cup whole-wheat pastry flour or all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking powder \u00bc teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Make the sauce: In a medium bowl, stir together the yogurt, feta, dill, lemon juice, olive oil and garlic. Refrigerate until you\u2019re ready to serve. Make the pancake: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees; position the rack in the middle. Brush a 10-inch, ovenproof nonstick or cast-iron skillet with a thin coat of oil. Toss the zucchini with the \u00bc teaspoon salt in a colander set over a bowl and let drain for 15 minutes. With your hands, squeeze as much water as possible out of the zucchini. (You can save the water for another use, such as a soup, stew or stock.) In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs, then add the strained zucchini and onion. Add the flour, 1 tablespoon of oil, baking powder, the remaining \u00bc teaspoon of salt and the pepper and stir to combine. Pour the batter into the greased skillet and spread it evenly with a spoon. Bake, about 30 minutes, until the pancake is set in the middle, browned on the edges and is golden brown on top. Transfer the pancake to a cutting board and allow to rest for 5 minutes before cutting into wedges. Serve right away with a dollop of the sauce on top or alongside.
