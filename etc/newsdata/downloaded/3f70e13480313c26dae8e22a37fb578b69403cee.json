Peyton Manning or Ricky Williams?\n\nOur quest to determine the greatest college football player of all-time continues, and we're asking voters to render a verdict before noon on Saturday (voting begins Thursday at noon) as we look to crown the final two members of the Elite Eight.\n\nIn last week\u2019s results, Barry Sanders (77% of the vote) defeated Bo Jackson (23%) and Herschel Walker (83%) took down Lee Roy Selmon (17%). They joined Tony Dorsett, Earl Campbell, Dick Butkus and Red Grange.\n\nPace, the region's No. 1 seed, was one of the most dominant offensive linemen ever to play the game during his time at Ohio State before being drafted No. 1 overall by the St. Louis Rams in 1997. Pace didn\u2019t allow a sack in his final two seasons at Ohio State and his dominating performance helped popularize the phrase \u201cpancake block.\u201d\n\nPace goes up against the fifth-seeded Charles Woodson (Michigan), who in 1997 became the only player who spent significant minutes on both offense and defense to win the Heisman.\n\nOur quest to name the greatest college football player of all-time continues! With help from @WeAreAFCA, we assembled the bracket, but your voting names the GOAT.\n\n\n\nVote to complete the Elite Eight before Saturday at noon ET. https://t.co/wU177Rto6N \u2014 USA TODAY Sports (@usatodaysports) October 3, 2019\n\nOn the other side is the second-seeded Manning (Tennessee), who was runner-up to Woodson in 1997 Heisman voting, and Ricky Williams, who was named Heisman in 1998 after rushing for 2,124 yards and 27 touchdowns.\n\nWilliams rushed for 6,279 yards and scored 72 rushing touchdowns in four seasons at Texas.
