With strong hiring and spending numbers, officials have become split over how to approach trade tensions and other strains on the economy.\n\n\"There may come a time when the economy weakens and we would then have to cut more aggressively,\" Fed Chairman Jay Powell said at a press conference following the decision. \"We don't know. We're going to be watching things carefully.\"\n\nThe central bank has signaled a similar wait-and-see approach, dimming expectations for the start of an easing cycle. But Kashkari \u2014 who doesn't have a vote on the FOMC until next year \u2014 argues that it should take action preemptively. He added that he saw negative interest rates, which President Trump has called for, as possible but not likely.\n\n\"Could I envisage a series of events that would lead us to have negative interest rates? I do, I could. It's not my base case, it's not even my second or third case, but the fact is that it's so pervasive around the world,\" he said.\n\nNow read: China extends olive branch ahead of trade talks, says it plans to buy US soybeans and pork\n\n\n\nRead more: 'It's going to 30,000': A CIO who oversees $4.9 billion explains why the Dow is headed for fresh record highs \u2014 and shares his top 4 stock picks for the upswing", "description": "Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Neel Kashkari said Thursday he argued the central bank should have pursued a steeper interest rate cut at its p...", "authors": ["Finanzen.Net Gmbh"], "top_image": "https://images.markets.businessinsider.com/image/570172ca5124c95c7a8b456b-800/kashkari-takes-on-wall-street-from-farm-rich-fed-region-2016-4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
