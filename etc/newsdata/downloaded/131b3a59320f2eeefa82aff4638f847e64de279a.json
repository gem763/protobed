(AP) - Connecticut checked off the first box on its postseason to-do list: winning a playoff game for the first time since 2012.\n\nAlyssa Thomas had 22 points and grabbed 10 rebounds to lead a balanced Connecticut offense and the Sun opened the WNBA semifinals with an 84-75 win over the Los Angeles Sparks on Tuesday night.\n\nJasmine Thomas scored 19 points, Jonquel Jones had 16 and Courtney Williams had 15 for the second-seeded Sun, who had a bye for the first two rounds.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working toward this all season,\u201d said Alyssa Thomas, who also had five assists and four of the team\u2019s nine steals. \u201cOur first goal was to secure at top-two seed. Single game elimination has not been good to us and we finally put ourselves in a position where we can play a series and we\u2019re more than ready. We\u2019re hungry.\u201d\n\nCandace Parker had 24 points and 10 rebounds, and Nneka Ogwumike added 20 points and 10 rebounds for the Sparks, who knocked off defending champion Seattle in the second round.\n\nBut the Sun forced the Sparks into 17 turnovers and Los Angeles\u2018 starting backcourt of Riquna Williams and Chelsea Gray were a combined 3 of 17 from the floor.\n\n\u201cWe have a third and fourth, fifth person that\u2019s capable of scoring points,\u201d said Sparks first-year coach Derek Fisher. \u201cBut we couldn\u2019t sustain it, particularly from our backcourt.\u201d\n\nConnecticut trailed by three points at halftime, but scored the first nine points of the third quarter. A layup by Courtney Williams just before that quarter\u2019s buzzer sent the Sun into the final 10 minutes up 59-58.\n\nConnecticut never trailed in the fourth. A key 3-pointer from Jones gave the Sun a seven-point lead with 4 minutes remaining and the home team outscored the Sparks 25-17 over the final 10 minutes.\n\nThe Sun, who lost their final two regular-season games, had not played since Sept. 8 and missed their first four shots.\n\nBut Alyssa Thomas quickly found her form, scoring the Sun\u2019s first nine points and had 13 as Connecticut took a 21-14 lead after a quarter.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say we came out slow, we actually came out really fast, unsettled, rushing shots, being too anxious to shoot instead of just getting settled,\u201d said Jasmine Thomas. \u201cShe settled us. She took the ball, took over, got us going downhill.\u201d\n\nConnecticut led by as many as 11 points in the second, before Nneka Ogwumike led the Sparks back. She had 13 points in the half, hitting six of her seven shots as LA took a 40-37 lead into intermission.\n\nRESPE-CT\n\nConnecticut has used the predictions of pundits as motivation for the postseason, making promos using the Tweets of \u201cexperts\u201d saying they don\u2019t have a superstar and picking against them in the series. The team sold T-shirts in the arena Tuesday that read DisrespeCT, with the CT highlighted.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got All Stars; we\u2019ve got the league\u2019s best 3-point shooter,\u201d said Jasmine Thomas. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it\u2019s going to take to turn us into big names. But we can\u2019t control that. We can\u2019t control what people think about us. We can\u2019t control what people say. But how we believe in ourselves in this locker room is what we feed off of. It\u2019s what makes us special.\u201d\n\nUNWELCOME BACK\n\nThis was Chiney Ogwumike\u2019s first playoff game in Connecticut since the former Sun star was granted a trade to LA in the offseason. She was booed loudly when the lineups were announced and each time she touched the ball.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of surreal,\u201d said the younger Ogwumike, who finished with four points and four fouls in 15 minutes. \u201cThe first time I came back here they booed and I guess it hurt me a little bit, because this place meant so much to me. But I understand why. What I just learned is that for 40 minutes they are going boo, but afterward there is still a lot of love. At least, that\u2019s what I\u2019m leaning on.\u201d\n\nTIP-INS\n\nSun: Connecticut has won 24 games this season, the most since 2012, which also happens to be the last time the franchise was in the conference semifinals. The team lost in the conference finals that year and has had just two playoff games since, losing to Phoenix in the first round each of the last two seasons.\n\nSparks: Los Angeles won two out of three from the Sun in the regular season, but fall to 1-2 in Connecticut.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe teams return to the Mohegan Sun arena on Thursday for Game 2 of the best-of-five series.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Connecticut checked off the first box on its postseason to-do list: winning a playoff game for the first time since 2012.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Pat Eaton-Robb"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/17/sparks_sun_basketball_22520_c0-206-3325-2144_s1770x1032.jpg?2a0d377804048237515aeadec3151bc0eb3a8855", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
