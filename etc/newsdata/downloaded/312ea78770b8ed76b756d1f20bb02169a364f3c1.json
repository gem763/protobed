Mark DeSaulnier Mark James DeSaulnierThe Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Better Medicare Alliance - Diplomat's 'powerful' testimony and 'lynching' attract headlines Democrats have to choose between saving children's lives and hurting Trump politically Trump's 'death sentence' for immigrant who followed the law merits private bill MORE (D-Calif.) said Wednesday that even though there\u2019s no justification for Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine, he argued that the actions taken by former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenSupport for impeachment inches up in poll Overnight Defense: Trump's Syria envoy wasn't consulted on withdrawal | McConnell offers resolution urging Trump to rethink Syria | Diplomat says Ukraine aid was tied to political investigations Democrats say they have game changer on impeachment MORE\u2019s son shouldn\u2019t be compared with those committed by President Trump Donald John TrumpGraham to introduce resolution condemning House impeachment inquiry Support for impeachment inches up in poll Fox News's Bret Baier calls Trump's attacks on media 'a problem' MORE.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no defending in my view what they did,\u201d DeSaulnier, a member of the House Oversight Committee, told Hill.TV. \u201cThat shouldn\u2019t have been done, it was inappropriate.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s different in my view from a sitting president asking another president of a foreign country to do him a political favor in order for him to get reelected and withhold American assets to a very, very important ally and a very important opponent of [Russian President] Vladimir Putin Vladimir Vladimirovich PutinOvernight Defense: Trump's Syria envoy wasn't consulted on withdrawal | McConnell offers resolution urging Trump to rethink Syria | Diplomat says Ukraine aid was tied to political investigations Trump's Syria envoy says he wasn't consulted on troop withdrawal Former Russian Olympic Games official arrested by ICE in Florida MORE,\u201d he added.\n\nHis comments come as Trump faces an impeachment inquiry launched by House Democrats last month following a whistleblower\u2019s complaint centered on July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nThe anonymous whistleblower alleged that the president suggested withholding military aid as a way to pressure Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son.\n\nTrump and Republicans have raised concerns about Hunter Biden\u2019s ties to a Ukrainian energy company, as well as the former vice president\u2019s role in the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor.\n\nHowever, no evidence of criminal wrongdoing by either of the Bidens has been found.\n\nDuring an interview with ABC news earlier this month, Hunter Biden admitted that he exercised \"poor judgment\" by serving on the board of the Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president, but he maintained that he did not do anything unethical.\n\nIn the weeks since the launch of the inquiry, Trump has stood by his actions and repeatedly lashed out at Democrats over the ongoing probe, even comparing it to a lynching.\n\n\"So some day, if a Democrat becomes President and the Republicans win the House, even by a tiny margin, they can impeach the President, without due process or fairness or any legal rights,\" Trump tweeted on Tuesday. \"All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here \u2014 a lynching. But we will WIN!\"\n\nTrump\u2019s remarks drew swift condemnation from lawmakers, including DeSaulnier.\n\nThe president to me is a racist \u2014 he used that as a code and he does this frequently,\u201d he told Hill.TV. \u201cHe tries to make himself a victim often times of things that he is targeting.\u201d\n\n\u2014Tess Bonn", "description": "Rep.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/hunterbiden_04122016_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
