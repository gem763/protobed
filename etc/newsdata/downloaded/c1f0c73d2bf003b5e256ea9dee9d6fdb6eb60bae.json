To stand back and do nothing would be contrary to everything we believe in,\u201d the prince said in the statement posted on the couple\u2019s royal website.\n\n\u201cThere is a human cost to this relentless propaganda, specifically when it is knowingly false and malicious, and though we have continued to put on a brave face - as so many of you can relate to - I cannot begin to describe how painful it has been,\u201d Harry said.\n\nA Mail on Sunday spokesman told Britain\u2019s Press Association the paper \u201cstands by the story it published and will be defending this case vigorously.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, we categorically deny that the duchess\u2019s letter was edited in any way that changed its meaning,\u201d the spokesman said.\n\nHarry has lashed out at British celebrity news coverage before. He lashed out at aggressive paparazzi that stalked Meghan\u2019s every move when they were dating and offensive treatment of her biracial heritage by some media.\n\nIn Tuesday\u2019s statement, he mentioned his late mother, Princess Diana, who died in an August 1997 car crash while being pursued by paparazzi, as the reason he knew the move to take a tabloid to court \u201cmay not be the safe one, it is the right one.\n\n\u201cBecause my deepest fear is history repeating itself,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen what happens when someone I love is commoditized to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person.\n\nMeghan and Harry are paying for the lawsuit with private and not public funds, the Press Association reported. The news agency said if damages are awarded to Meghan, they will be donated to a charity that combats bullying.\n\nThe lawsuit also names the Mail on Sunday\u2019s parent company, Associated Newspapers.\n\nHarry said the couple and their baby son, Archie, have received positive news coverage during their royal tour in southern Africa that demonstrated how Meghan has been subjected to press \u201cbullying\u201d back home.\n\n\u201cShe is the same woman she was a year ago on our wedding day, just as she is the same woman you\u2019ve seen on this Africa tour.\u201d", "description": "The civil lawsuit accuses the Mail on Sunday of copyright infringement, misuse of private information and violating the U.K\u201ds data protection law with the...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GR806_markle_ZG_20181015163412.jpg"}
