Pilots fought vainly to overcome the force applied by the the anti-stall system.\n\nBoeing has modified the system so that \u201cMCAS can never command more stabiliser input than can be counteracted by the flight crew pulling back on the column\u201d.\n\nThe maker says: \u201cPilots will continue to always have the ability to override MCAS and manually control the airplane.\u201d\n\nBoeing had said it hoped the 737 Max would be back in commercial service by the end of this year, but most airlines are assuming it will start flying early in 2020.\n\nBesides Tui Airways, Norwegian was previously operating the Max to and from the UK.\n\nIn June, British Airways\u2019 parent company IAG signed a Letter of Intent (a non-binding order) for the aircraft, but in the accompanying press release no mention was made of the Max suffix.\n\nInstead, the plane was described as the Boeing 737-8 and 737-10 \u2013 the two variants of the Max IAG wants to buy.\n\nRyanair was due to start flying the Boeing 737 Max from Stansted in May 2019, but has yet to receive any of the planes.\n\nIt has ordered a special high-density variant of the aircraft, known as the Max 200, with 197 seats.\n\nIn July, photographs taken at the Boeing factory at Renton, near Seattle, showed a new 737 aircraft in Ryanair colours with the word \u201cMax\u201d replaced by the number \u201c8200\u201d.", "description": "The UK\u2019s biggest operator of the Boeing 737 Max may change the name of the aircraft before it returns to service.
