Such as your shambolic coaching and persistent ill-discipline on the pitch which for decades now has seen France under-perform.\"\n\n\n\nPeyper has since apologised for his actions but it was not quite enough for him to be considered for action this weekend.\n\n\n\nThe referee dismissed the French lock in Oita last Sunday after video replays showed him smashing his elbow into the face of Welsh flanker Aaron Wainwright early in the second half.\n\n\n\nThe French were leading 19-10 at the time, before going on to lose 20-19.\n\n\n\nWoodward, who won the 2003 World Cup as England coach, added that any referee would have sent off Vahaamahina.\n\n\n\n\"There is zero controversy or intrigue here, the French lock got precisely what he deserved. Jaco Peyper was out relaxing after a huge game and the day a referee cannot enjoy a beer and a joke with either the players or fans is the day rugby has lost its way.\"\n\n\n\nWorld Rugby went on to announce that Frenchman Jerome Garces would referee Sunday's Rugby World Cup semi-final between South Africa and Wales in Yokohama.\n\n\n\nGarces will be assisted by England's Wayne Barnes and New Zealand's Ben O'Keeffe, with another Kiwi, Ben Skeen, the television match official (TMO).\n\nIn the other semi-final between New Zealand and England in Yokohama on Saturday (10:00 SA time), Welshman Nigel Owens will be the referee.\n\nOwens will be assisted by French duo Romain Poite and Pascal Gauzere, with South Africa's Marius Jonker as TMO.\n\nThe global governing body said the selection was \"based on merit after a review of performances\u201d by its match officials selection committee.", "description": "Former England coach Clive Woodward has leapt to the defence of South African referee Jaco Peyper following an uproar of a picture.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2765/4a88ad7cfcc2491ba98df1c441274746.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
