But these methods receive only 2% of the funding spent on cutting emissions, say the climate activists.\n\nTheir call to protect, restore and fund natural climate solutions comes ahead of a global climate strike led by young people on Friday and a UN climate action summit of world leaders in New York on Monday. The film will be shown to heads of state and the UN\u2019s climate and biodiversity chiefs in New York.\n\nRestoring nature also helps protect people from the increasing extreme weather events the climate crisis is bringing, as trees help prevent flooding and mangroves protect coasts. Furthermore, the annihilation of wildlife that has resulted in animal populations falling by 60% since 1970 can be tackled be recreating lost habitat. However, it remains vital that fossil fuel burning is stopped if the climate emergency is to be ended.\n\nTree planting 'has mind-blowing potential' to tackle climate crisis Read more\n\n\u201cRight now, we are ignoring natural climate solutions,\u201d said Thunberg. \u201cWe spend 1,000 times more on global fossil fuel subsidies than on nature-based solutions. This is your money, it is your taxes, and your savings.\u201d\n\n\u201cNature is a tool we can use to repair our broken climate,\u201d said Monbiot, an author and Guardian journalist who founded a Natural Climate Solutions campaign earlier this year. \u201cThese solutions could make a massive difference, but only if we leave fossil fuels in the ground as well.\u201d\n\nShyla Raghav from Conservation International, which helped fund the film, said: \u201cThe fact is, we simply will not succeed in avoiding climate breakdown without nature.\u201d\n\nGlobal carbon emissions must be halved in the next decade to avoid serious impacts from global heating, but they are still rising. It is therefore near certain that carbon dioxide will have to be removed from the atmosphere, and technology such as burying CO2 underground has not been demonstrated at scale.\n\nIn the film, Monbiot says: \u201cThere is a magic machine that sucks carbon out of the air, costs very little, and builds itself. It\u2019s called a tree.\u201d A recent scientific analysis concluded that growing billions of trees across the world is the single biggest and cheapest way to tackle the climate crisis, though coal, oil and gas burning must also end.\n\n\u201cWe are living in the beginning of a mass extinction and our climate is breaking down,\u201d says Thunberg in the film. \u201cBut we can still fix this \u2013 you can still fix this.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s simple,\u201d she says. \u201cWe need to protect, restore, and fund.\u201d That means protecting tropical forests that are being cut down at the rate of 30 football pitches a minute, she said, restoring the large areas of the planet that have been damaged and stopping the funding of things that destroy nature and instead paying for activities that help it.\n\nThe film\u2019s producer, Tom Mustill of Gripping Films, said: \u201cWe tried to make the film have the tiniest environmental impact possible. We took trains to Sweden to interview Greta, charged our hybrid car at George\u2019s house, used green energy to power the edit and recycled archive footage rather than shooting new.\u201d", "description": "Film by Swedish activist and Guardian journalist George Monbiot says nature must be used to repair broken climate", "authors": ["Damian Carrington", "Kate Aronoff", "Nick Lowles"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88d4577af82eebe330b74d8707c7999f7f9aafa5/212_0_1925_1155/master/1925.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6b726a8c35360e25658bc935633efc2c", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
