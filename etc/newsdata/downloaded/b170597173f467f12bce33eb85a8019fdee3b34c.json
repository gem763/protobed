Fixing this looming shortfall is usually cast as a bitter medicine that policymakers are unwilling to swallow, for fear of alienating older voters reliant on the program.\n\nMarc Goldwein, senior policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, says Social Security reform can happen \u2013 and it can be done in a way to boost the U.S. economy.\n\n\u201cWe're really headed to a period of slow economic growth because of the baby boomers, but the right types of Social Security reform can give us exactly the boost that we need,\u201d Goldwein said on Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cYFiPM.\u201d\n\nOne of the ideas behind Goldwein\u2019s recent paper, \u201cPromoting Economic Growth through Social Security Reform,\u201d co-authored with Maya MacGuineas and Chris Towner, is to push Americans to retire later. The authors outline a plan to phase in \u201can increase to Social Security\u2019s early and normal retirement ages and then indexing them to growth in life expectancy.\u201d\n\nCurrently, Americans born between 1943 and 1954 can begin receiving partial Social Security benefits at age 62. If you wait until age 66 \u2013 \u201cfull retirement age\u201d \u2013 you receive full benefits. The CRFB plan does have a carve-out for low-income workers who could opt to receive some benefits at age 62 and avoid slipping into poverty.\n\nSocial Security Card More\n\n\u201cWe're better off if people can work a bit longer. Why? It means more economic growth,\u201d Goldwein said, adding that it also helps people live longer and be happier. \u201cTo the extent that we can nudge people to delay their retirement, to move to more flexible retirement arrangements, there's potential win, win, win,\u201d he said. The paper estimates the reform plan would increase the projected size of the economy \u201cby between 3.5% and 13% by 2050.\"\n\nThe CRFB research has three other top-line recommendations. First, it would calculate Social Security benefits based on every year of work instead of the current 35-year average of earnings (Social Security calculates a worker\u2019s average indexed monthly earnings during the 35 years in which they earned the most). Second, the plan would automatically enroll workers into a \u201cSupplemental Retirement Account,\u201d in addition to Social Security. Third, it would implement tax and benefit changes to the program, saying that the details of that would be worked out \u201cas part of a political negotiation.\u201d\n\nGoldwein appeared as part of Yahoo Finance\u2019s ongoing partnership with the Funding our Future campaign, a group of organizations advocating for increased retirement security for Americans.\n\nBen Werschkul is a producer for Yahoo Finance in Washington, DC.\n\nRead more:\n\nAmericans aren't saving enough for emergencies.
