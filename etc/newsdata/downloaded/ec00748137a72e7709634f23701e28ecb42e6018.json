While the technology bugs may be fixed quickly, it may take longer for some advertisers and agencies to regain confidence in the platform, which may further affect revenue growth. In our view, this is another example of various difficulties the firm faces as it attempts to develop a two-sided network effect moat source and compete more effectively with online advertising and social network behemoth Facebook. We have not made significant changes to next year\u2019s projections as two events in 2020--the Summer Olympics and the U.S. presidential election--are likely to accelerate growth.\n\nWe are maintaining our $32 fair value estimate. The stock was down 21% during the Oct. 24 trading day in reaction to the disappointing third-quarter results, and it's down more than 32% from its 52-week high of early September. While the stock is no longer overvalued after today\u2019s pullback, it is trading at only a slight discount to our fair value estimate.
