Meanwhile, investors continued to monitor signs that President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cphase one\u201d trade deal with China would materialize.\n\nBetter-than-expected earnings results from Dow components UnitedHealth (UNH), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and JPMorgan (JPM) helped lift the 30-stock index more than 100 points shortly after market open. Gains accelerated as the session progressed.\n\nHere were the main moves in the market, as of 10:50 a.m. ET:\n\nS&P 500 (^GSPC): +1.07%, or 31.61 points\n\nDow (^DJI): +1.04%, or 278.38 points\n\nNasdaq (^IXIC): +1.14%, or 91.97 points\n\nCrude oil (CL=F): -0.13% to $53.52 per barrel\n\nGold (GC=F): -0.97% to $1,483.10 per ounce\n\nA vacillating narrative around prospects of a \u201cphase one\u201d U.S.-China trade deal continued into Tuesday, with Bloomberg reporting that China may need to remove retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products in order to meet its agreement to purchase some $50 billion of U.S. agricultural goods. However, according to the report, doing so would require a reciprocal tariff reduction on the part of the Trump administration \u2013 a move Washington has not indicated it would be willing to pursue.\n\nThe report undermines earlier optimism that the U.S. and China would get their preliminary agreement in writing within the next several weeks, and stock futures pared some gains following Bloomberg\u2019s report. Earlier, Hu Xijin, editor in chief of the Chinese state-run Global Times media outlet, wrote in a Twitter post that \u201cChina has the market demand to buy $40 billion-$50 billion worth of US farm products. China won't make a commitment that it can't honor; once it promises, it will fulfill it.\u201d\n\nOther geopolitical concerns continued to play out in the background.\n\nLate Tuesday, President Donald Trump announced he was authorizing sanctions and increasing steel tariffs on Turkey to 50% as a response to Ankara\u2019s military offensive in northern Syria. These measures, however, were widely viewed as lighter punitive actions than had been anticipated, and the Turkish lira \u2013 the worst performing currency this month \u2013 was little changed amid the announcement.\n\nHowever, the ongoing Turkish military offensive in Syria has had other repercussions for the emerging economy. Volkswagen AG (VOW3.DE), the world\u2019s largest carmaker, said it was postponing a planned $1.4 billion investment for a new plant in Turkey, given the country\u2019s military operation.\n\nEarnings season kicks off\n\nBig banks began reporting quarterly results Tuesday morning, with JPMorgan (JPM) topping consensus expectations on the top and bottom lines. The biggest U.S. bank by assets retained its No. 1 position in global investment banking fees, with revenue in this segment climbing 8.1% year-over-year to $1.87 billion.\n\nHeading into the third-quarter earnings season, banks were expected to show weaker net interest margins, reflecting the amount banks collect in interest on loans less interest paid on deposits. The Federal Reserve\u2019s two interest rate cuts this year and a flattening yield curve were each expected to pressure this measure of bank profitability, with both JPMorgan and Wells Fargo last quarter guiding toward worsening net interest margin.\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s results on this measure were mostly in-line with guidance. Net yield on interest-earning assets was 2.41%, down from the 2.51% posted last year, but within Wall Street\u2019s expected range of between 2.37% and 2.45%.\n\nTraders work in the JP Morgan company stall on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in New York. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson (UNITED STATES - Tags: BUSINESS) More\n\nIn a statement, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon underlined a mixed picture in the domestic economic environment.\n\n\u201cThe consumer remains healthy with growth in wages and spending, combined with strong balance sheets and low unemployment levels,\u201d Dimon said. \u201cThis is being offset by weakening business sentiment and capital expenditures mostly driven by increasingly complex geopolitical risks, including tensions in global trade.\u201d", "description": "Stocks rose Tuesday as some of the first major corporate names began delivering third-quarter results.
