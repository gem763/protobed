REUTERS/Umit Bektas/File Photo\n\nThe pro-Kurdish People\u2019s Democratic Party (HDP) mayors of the Kurdish-majority districts of Hakkari, Yuksekova, Ercis and Nusaybin, near Turkey\u2019s borders with Syria and Iraq, were held over terrorism links, the HDP and Anadolu news agency said, without elaborating.\n\nPresident Tayyip Erdogan and his government accuse the HDP of being linked to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militant group, and thousands of its members have been prosecuted for the same reason, including its leaders. The HDP denies such links.\n\nWhile most of Turkey\u2019s opposition parties have backed the operation, the HDP has called for it to stop, describing it as an \u201cinvasion attempt\u201d. HDP says the operation was an attempt by the government to drum up support amid declining public backing.\n\nSpeaking to members of her HDP, party co-leader Pervin Buldan accused the government of violating the rights of Kurdish people domestically and said the operation in Syria was being waged against the Kurdish people.\n\n\u201cThe domestic enmity against Kurds is continuing on northern Syrian soil,\u201d Buldan said.\n\n\u201cIf Kurds were to plant a flower in a pot, (...) they would call it a \u2018terrorist pot\u2019 and shoot it with tanks and cannons,\u201d she added.\n\nTurkey has said its operation does not target Kurds and only the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, which it says is a terrorist organisation and the Syrian offshoot of the PKK. It says the PKK and YPG should not be equated with the Kurdish people.\n\nThe HDP said 151 of its members, including district officials, had been detained over the past week since Turkey and its Syrian rebel allies launched the assault.\n\nLast week, Turkish police launched criminal investigations into the HDP\u2019s co-chairs over their criticism of the military operation and started probes into more than 500 social accounts over \u201cterrorist propaganda\u201d criticising the offensive.\n\nAuthorities launched similar investigations after each of Turkey\u2019s two previous cross-border operations into Syria. More than 300 people were detained for social media posts criticising Turkey\u2019s offensive into northern Syria in January 2018.", "description": "Turkish police detained four mayors from a pro-Kurdish party in dawn raids, widening a crackdown since Ankara launched an incursion into northern Syria a week ago, state media and the party said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441087843&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E0YN", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
