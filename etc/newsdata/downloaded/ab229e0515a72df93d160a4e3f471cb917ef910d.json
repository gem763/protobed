But they cut items here and there or point to the benefit of lower debt payments, they add far more than they remove, which is why the budget continues to defy gravity.\n\n\u201cThe risks are still there,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said Friday during a news conference with Mr. Johnson in the City Hall rotunda. \u201cThis is why we\u2019ve added to reserves and why we\u2019ve deepened our savings programs. The things that we are investing in either, in some cases, are sheer need, things we must address for a variety of reasons or things that we think are the kinds of investments that make sense for this city and are manageable and affordable.\u201d\n\nThe mayor said the city had sufficient reserves so that \u201cif there were an economic downturn, something we all have to be ready for, we have ways to immediately respond because of what we have in place.\u201d\n\nMr. Johnson pointed out that spending growth was fed by increases in revenues, and added that personal income tax collections this year were higher than expected.\n\nBut Andrew Rein, the president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonpartisan fiscal monitor, said that while they were some \u201cprudent actions\u201d in the budget, the city\u2019s strong economy and the increased revenue that derives from it represented a \u201cmissed opportunity.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat they should be doing with the additional revenues and a lot of this growth is putting it in reserves,\u201d Mr. Rein said. The commission estimates that a recession would reduce revenues by as much as $20 billion over three years, a number that dwarfs the city\u2019s reserves.\n\nWhat didn\u2019t get done?\n\nCouncil members have been pushing for funds to address a serious pay parity issue involving early childhood education staff.", "description": "What will taxpayers get for the growing budget?
