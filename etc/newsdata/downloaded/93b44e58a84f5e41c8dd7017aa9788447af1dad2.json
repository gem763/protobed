That left Harper on the outside looking in on the team\u2019s postseason success.\n\nThe former MVP signed with the Nationals\u2019 East Division rival, the Philadelphia Phillies, for $330 million in March. But in October, Harper was just a spectator.\n\nTwitter let him have it.\n\nThe Dodgers are out. The Nationals won a postseason series. Bryce Harper is watching from the couch.
