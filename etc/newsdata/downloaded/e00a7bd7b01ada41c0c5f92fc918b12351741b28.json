(0017.HK) said its net profit for the fiscal year ended June 30 declined, largely due to lower fair-value gains.\n\nNet profit was 18.16 billion Hong Kong dollars (US$2.32 billion), down from HK$23.34 billion in the previous fiscal year, the developer said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nRevenue for the fiscal year rose 26% to HK$76.76 billion, mainly helped by the strong performance of its property business in Hong Kong, the company said.\n\nThe company said it is preparing to launch several key property projects, which will further increase contribution from property sales to its revenue.\n\nMeanwhile, it will continue to dispose non-core assets and businesses, the company said.\n\nWrite to Martin Mou at martin.mou@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 25, 2019 01:17 ET (05:17 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
