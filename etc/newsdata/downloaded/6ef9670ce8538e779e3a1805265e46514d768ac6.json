Four months after NYC\u2019s mayor inexplicably jumped into the race, he crawled back out of it from the same perch as his launch. De Blasio told MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe that \u201cit\u2019s just not my time\u201d:\n\nWho knew that a \u201crobot tax\u201d wouldn\u2019t invigorate a presidential campaign? The Associated Press politely reminds readers that de Blasio was actually in the race while noting that he failed to \u201cgain traction.\u201d Or anything else, either:\n\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has ended his campaign for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. De Blasio struggled to gain traction in a sprawling field of Democrats seeking the presidency. He announced his decision in an MSNBC interview on Friday. De Blasio launched his bid in May, but his campaign largely failed to take off.\n\nIt didn\u2019t \u201clargely\u201d fail to launch; it never ignited at all. As of today, de Blasio\u2019s RCP aggregate polling score is a whopping 0.2%, trailing former Pennsylvania congressman Joe Sestak\u2019s 0.3.% The mayor of South Bend, Indiana scores twenty-five times better in the RCP average than the mayor of New York City, which has ninety times more people in it.\n\nThe AP also notes that de Blasio started off his campaign by \u201cdiv[ing] into an insult match with President Donald Trump.\u201d Guess who got the last laugh today \u2014 and made sure everyone knew it?\n\nOh no, really big political news, perhaps the biggest story in years! Part time Mayor of New York City, @BilldeBlasio, who was polling at a solid ZERO but had tremendous room for growth, has shocking dropped out of the Presidential race. NYC is devastated, he\u2019s coming home! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 20, 2019\n\nSo what prompted de Blasio\u2019s decision to retire? It can\u2019t really be a sudden realization that it\u2019s not his time. Polling hasn\u2019t ever shown that de Blasio was within a decade of \u201chis time\u201d as a presidential candidate. He missed out on the third debate and had no chance of making up enough ground to get into the fourth, which means that his prospects for ego-boosting national coverage on the cheap was evaporating.\n\nThose DNC rules for weeding out the lower-tier candidates on their own work pretty well, when they allow the rules to do so. They might want to consider tightening them up a little more to shake off the rest of the vanity candidates.", "description": "'It's clearly not my time.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/deblasio-out.png", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
