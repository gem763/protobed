It\u2019s the standard, the one brand that professional chefs and home bakers agree is the best \u2014 and this KitchenAid stand mixer is particularly nice. It\u2019s a bowl-lift mixer, which are sturdier, and usually more expensive, than tilt-head ones, because there are fewer moving parts. And that heavy-duty construction comes in handy when you\u2019re trying to knead dough or whip up large batches of batter. (In fact, the manufacturer claims this stand mixer is big and powerful enough to make 10 dozen cookies at once.) And right now, this professional-grade stand mixer is the cheapest we\u2019ve ever seen: just $260, or 38 percent off the list price of $416. We like the classic fire-engine red, but if that\u2019s little too flashy for your taste or kitchen, it\u2019s also available in silver and black, for the same low price.\n\nKitchenAid 6-Quart Bowl-Lift Professional Stand Mixer $260 (was $416, now 38% off) $260 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
