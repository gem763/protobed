Any explicit sexual content and nudity that\u2019s already on the site will be hidden and users won\u2019t be able to post any more adult content.\n\nThat means reblogs and public posts will all be hidden. You\u2019ll need some way of saving all your posts. Tumblr does offer an export tool, but it\u2019s buried under multiple pages in the Help Center.\n\nFirst, head into your Dashboard and click on your account menu, which is represented by a person icon. Click on the Settings gear on the account menu. From there, you can select which blog you want to export from a list on the right. Tumblr lets you have multiple blogs per account, but you\u2019ll have to go through the same steps to export each one.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve selected a blog, scroll all the way down to the Export feature and click on it. Tumblr will then start to process your backup. The process could take some time \u2014 it will likely depend on how many posts you\u2019ve got. For instance, I started downloading my data yesterday and it\u2019s been a full 24 hours, but the backup still isn\u2019t ready.\n\nAfter the file is ready to be downloaded, the processing message will disappear and you\u2019ll see a \u201cDownload backup\u201d button instead. Tap that to get a ZIP file.\n\nThe ZIP file will include:\n\na Posts folder that contains each reblog, draft, private post, flagged post, and any other hidden posts as HTML files\n\na Media folder that contains the media from your posts and in any of your messages, including photos, GIFs, audio, and more\n\nall your posts and conversations in XML format\n\nMany users have reported Tumblr incorrectly flagging posts as \u201cexplicit,\u201d including images of cute dogs, turtles, illustrations, and vases, so it\u2019s quite possible that other posts that don\u2019t expressly contain sexually explicit or nude content may still be taken down. If you\u2019re at all concerned about losing your Tumblr archives, it\u2019s a good idea to export your blog just to be safe, no matter what you\u2019ve got in it.", "description": "On Monday, Tumblr announced that it\u2019s removing all adult content from its site on December 17th.
