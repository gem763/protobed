Eliot Engel: Not sure House needs 'another step' in impeachment inquiry by holding vote", "language": "en", "text": "The chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Sunday said it wouldn\u2019t bother him if the full House took a vote on Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry into President Trump but suggested that it wasn\u2019t necessary at this point.\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t bother me to vote,\u201d Rep. Eliot Engel, New York Democrat, said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cBut, you know, the Republicans would rather talk about anything else than about what\u2019s really happened. So, they throw this out that there should be a vote.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we had a vote on that, they\u2019d come up with six other things, there needs to be a vote,\u201d Mr. Engel said. \u201cI think there needs to be an impeachment inquiry and we should stop the delaying tactics of the Republicans.\u201d\n\nHe said the House can go on the record \u201cby actually having impeachment hearings.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that we need another step to kind of push it further back,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Engel, along with House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff and Overight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, is helping lead House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry into the president.\n\nRep. Jim Himes, Connecticut Democrat, said Sunday that he would be OK with seeing a formal vote.\n\n\u201cLook, my own opinion is we ought to just take this off the table because it\u2019s such a non-issue,\u201d he said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cAnd there\u2019s no doubt in my mind, that of course, if [Speaker] Nancy Pelosi does that, that she will have the votes and that will pass. But it\u2019s not required.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump suggested recently that he would consider cooperating with the inquiry if the full House voted and the process was fair.\n\nBut Mrs. Pelosi has said such a vote isn\u2019t necessary for the House to continue in its formalized investigation of the president.\n\nHouse Democrats are probing whether Mr. Trump improperly pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into digging up dirt on former Vice President Joseph R. Biden \u2014 a charge Mr. Trump denies.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
