But they suddenly canceled the visits to head home early, CNBC reported.\n\nTrump told reporters Friday there was no need to work out a trade deal with China before the 2020 election because the American economy is \u201cso strong\u201d \u2014 despite mounting fears about a recession. \u201cI\u2019m not looking for a partial deal; I\u2019m looking for a complete deal,\u201d he said (see the video above). \u201cPeople know that we\u2019re doing a great job. ... We\u2019re not being affected.\u201d\n\nTrump also insisted again that China pays the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on Chinese goods imported into the U.S. \u201cHundreds of billions of dollars worth of money is coming in from China that never came in before,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nTrump either has absolutely no clue how tariffs work or is shamelessly lying about them, or some combination thereof pic.twitter.com/FX1epY8VUs \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) September 20, 2019\n\nIn fact, the tariffs are paid by companies, like Walmart, that import Chinese products, and most if not all of the extra costs are passed on to the American consumer.\n\nThe U.S. trade representative\u2019s office issued a statement characterizing the two days of talks as \u201cproductive\u201d and said higher-level talks will take place as planned next month.\n\nIn a bid to smooth some kind of deal with China, Trump had delayed increasing tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods from Oct. 1 to Oct. 15 as a \u201cgesture of good will.\u201d In addition, the Trump administration this week excluded hundreds of Chinese product categories from the tariff list, including Christmas tree lights, at the request of U.S. businesses, Reuters reported.\n\nLast week, China announced that it would exclude imports of U.S. soybeans, pork and other farm goods from additional tariffs.\n\nThe U.S. imposed a 15% tariff on $112 billion worth of Chinese goods Sept. 1. China responded by resuming a 25% tariff on U.S. cars and adding up to 10% tariffs on $75 billion worth of additional goods.\n\nAlso on HuffPost\n\nLove HuffPost?
