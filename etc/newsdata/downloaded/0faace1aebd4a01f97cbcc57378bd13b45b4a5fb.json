A friend had shared it with him. Both are Trump supporters.\n\nThe flight attendant's post featured a photo of a man in an aisle seat on a Southwest flight, dressed in shorts, a camouflage hat and a navy blue T-shirt with an American flag and the words \"Trump 45'' and \"Suck it up Buttercup.''\n\nThe caption: \"Someone did NOT get my most Positively Outrageous Service today on my flight ... #notgoingtosuckitup #dumpTrump #eeew.'' The \"outrageous\" line is a customer service mantra long espoused by Southwest.\n\nOn Thursday, a Southwest Airlines flight attendant posted a photo of a passenger in a \"Trump 45\" T-shirt to his personal Facebook page, saying the man \"did NOT get my most Positively Outrageous Service today.\" (Photo: Jeremy Dwyer-Lindgren/ Special to USA TODAY)\n\nKaminski asked Southwest, \"So this is how they treat passengers?''\n\nHe criticized the flight attendant for not \"giving his best to a customer because he hates the man's shirt and our president.\"\n\n\"Wow,'' Kaminski added. \"He should be fired because he can't do his job. Very sad employee.''\n\nA Southwest representative quickly replied to the post with one of the airline's stock social media responses: \"We aim to provide outstanding service to all who travel with us and regret if we missed the mark. We appreciate you sharing your feedback.''\n\nAnd then the comments began pouring in, in most cases along party lines.\n\n\"Give this man a raise,'' one said, while another said, \"This guy should be fired.''\n\n\"I\u2019m the farthest thing from a Trump supporter, but I am a 'people' supporter,'' one poster said. \"This is clearly unacceptable. Southwest Airlines, I love a lot of Trump supporters even though I don\u2019t agree with them and frankly this kind of behavior from your FA is what\u2019s making civil discussion in our country all but a memory. If you think it is OK for your (employee) to give lesser treatment to someone he disagrees with, I hope you\u2019ll find it OK when I take my business to an airline I agree with.\"\n\nHashtags emerged, including #boycottSouthwest. One poster handed out the number, extension included, of Southwest's customer relations team.\n\nThe number of comments was approaching 100 by the time Southwest removed the post, a large number for a post that is not easy to find. The flight attendant also scrubbed photos and other information from his Facebook page and shortened his last name. He did not respond to USA TODAY's request for comment.\n\nSouthwest spokesman Chris Mainz said Kaminski's post on the airline's Facebook page was removed \"as we investigate and address the issue internally.''\n\nHe also further apologized for the post many considered out of line for a service employee and an invasion of the passenger's privacy. (He was not identified in the post.)\n\n\"We aim to provide outstanding service to all who travel with us,'' Mainz said in a statement to USA TODAY. \"The post in question does not reflect the inclusive environment we strive to provide for our customers and employees.\"\n\nThe flight attendant's post is likely in violation of the airline's social media policy, but Mainz would not disclose details of the protocol.\n\nFlight attendant unions also have social media policies, but the union for Southwest's flight attendants, Transport Workers Union Local 556, did not respond to questions on the policy or the incident.\n\nThe policy for members of another flight attendants union, the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, includes these tips:\n\n\"When in doubt, do not post.''\n\n\"Remember, your postings online are permanent (even when subsequently deleted). Be sensitive to political issues you comment on.''\n\nBeyond a response from Southwest and a few comments from people who don't like Trump, Kaminski said he didn't expect much from the post about the flight attendant.\n\n\"I couldn't believe it,'' he said. \"It exploded, and very quickly.''\n\nHe said the fact that he's a Trump supporter shouldn't matter, though he responded to several comments on the post with his support for the president's reelection.\n\nThe flight attendant was out of bounds, he said, just as he would be if he expressed opinions about people at his job as a city employee or took photos of others against social media policies.\n\n\"My job is to do my job and go home,'' he said. \"My job is not to be there and be ridiculing people, treating them like crap and having my opinion.\n\n\"You can\u2019t just go out and lash out at people, just because that\u2019s the way you feel, at your job. Even as a human being you shouldn\u2019t do that. You should have a little bit of compassion.''\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2019/10/03/southwest-flight-attendants-post-disses-passenger-trump-t-shirt/3852213002/", "description": "A Southwest flight attendant said he didn't give a passenger in a \"Trump 45'' T-shirt his best service.
