But without an Orthodox synagogue in St. John's, observant Jews had to improvise to accommodate other aspects of their faith.\n\nSome of the passengers' needs were predictable, like beds and toiletries. Others, not so much: a group of observant Jews had to improvise to practise their faith, since there was no Orthodox synagogue in the city. But St. John's still came through for them.\n\n\"They told us where we could get kosher food,\" said an interviewee, \"and they were very helpful.\"\n\nAnything to help\n\n'This is like having two huge conventions turning up unannounced,' said St. John's Mayor Andy Wells. (CBC Archives/The National )\n\nFor the volunteers, pitching in didn't feel optional.\n\n\"All of us have been so taken by the events of the last two or three days,\" said Salvation Army volunteer Sherwin Stride. \"Anything you could do to help, you almost had to do it.\"\n\nThough they were far from home and not sure when they'd get back, passengers were unfailingly grateful.\n\n\"Sometimes we've been surrounded by volunteers,\" said one woman. \"We're travelling with a dog and people have gone out of their way to make sure even our dog is fed and watered and comfortable.\"\n\nThousands of passengers en route from Europe to North America were forced to land in Newfoundland when all air traffic was halted on Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nGander inspires a Broadway hit\n\nThe travellers weren't just in St. John's. In Stephenville, N.L., they were sleeping in classrooms. And in Gander, N.L., an influx of 6,500 people almost doubled the town's population. Their story would be the genesis for the award-winning Broadway musical Come From Away.\n\nAccording to the Gander International Airport, 39 planes were diverted there on Sept. 11, 2001. The passengers had to be processed by the town's single immigration officer, aided by another three who drove in from St. John's.", "description": "The people of Newfoundland and Labrador rise to the challenge of helping thousands of airline passengers diverted there on Sept. 11, 2001.", "authors": ["Cbc Archives"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4815305.1568206736!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/air-traffic-halted-in-newfoundland.jpg", "published_at": "2018-09-11"}
