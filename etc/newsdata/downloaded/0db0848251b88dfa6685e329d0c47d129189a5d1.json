We seem to think of water as some black hole where everything disappears. Everything that we throw or have thrown in the water is coming back to us. It's estimated that humans dump an average of 8 trillion kilograms of plastic into the oceans every year. That's a lot of pollutants that don't break down.\n\nBut there are some people and authorities around the world who are working to reduce that. Here are some best ecologic initiatives being used to reduce, reuse, and recycle plastic.\n\n1. Local vendors using leaves instead of plastic to wrap fish.\n\nSingle-use plastic was supposed to be banned in India from October 2, and we staunchly believe that it is the need of the hour. Small-scale changes are already being made. Plastic straws are being replaced by sturdy paper straws in restaurants and bamboo is coming out as a strong alternative for plastic.\n\nscreen-grab/tiwtter\n\nSteps are even being taken on local levels to reduce the use of - or completely replace - plastic. Kiren Rijiju recently shared a video on Twitter, which went viral. A part of the caption explained where it was from, 'A local meat vendor at remote Tirbin, Lepa Rada Dist, Arunachal Pradesh.'\n\nDon't Miss 7.4 K SHARES 500 SHARES 5.3 K SHARES 156 SHARES 2.2 K SHARES\n\n\"PM @narendramodi has told us not to use plastics so we are using local leaves because plastics are no more available\"\n\nA local meat vendor at remote Tirbin, Lepa Rada Dist, Arunachal Pradesh. pic.twitter.com/Z1vuB2K8fK \u2014 Kiren Rijiju (@KirenRijiju) October 6, 2019\n\nIn the images above, you can see how vendors are using leaves instead of plastic bags, to sell edibles.\n\n2. A company is selling 11 million shoes with thread made from the plastic waste of our oceans.\n\nThe fashion industry is a major part of our pollution problem, because the materials used are often ones like polyester or nylon, which have plastic microfibres embedded in them. So, obviously, creating more of it is bad, and the same goes for shoes too.\n\nSo, Adidas is attempting to do something about this, at least where their manufacturing process is concerned. Sports shoes have plastic content after all, and when people toss them out, that ends up in landfills or the oceans, where it pollutes our ecosystem.\n\nAdidas says that it expects to make 11 million pairs of shoes this year, using recycled ocean plastic; that's more than double the number of pairs it made this way in 2018. According to the company, their efforts has resulted in 2,810 tonne of plastic being kept out of the oceans.\n\nADIDAS/PARLEY\n\n3.
