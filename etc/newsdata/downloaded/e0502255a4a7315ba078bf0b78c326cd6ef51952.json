I bought the Kindle version because it\u2019s easier to use Kindle books for research. I highlighted these passages to share with you:\n\nForms of modern life may differ in quite a few respects \u2013 but what unites them all is precisely their fragility, temporariness, vulnerability and inclination to constant change. To \u2018be modern\u2019 means to modernize \u2013 compulsively, obsessively; not so much just \u2018to be\u2019, let alone to keep its identity intact, but forever \u2018becoming\u2019, avoiding completion, staying underdefined. Each new structure which replaces the previous one as soon as it is declared old-fashioned and past its use-by date is only another momentary settlement \u2013 acknowledged as temporary and \u2018until further notice\u2019. Being always, at any stage and at all times, \u2018post-something\u2019 is also an undetachable feature of modernity. As time flows on, \u2018modernity\u2019 changes its forms in the manner of the legendary Proteus \u2026 What was some time ago dubbed (erroneously) \u2018post-modernity\u2019, and what I\u2019ve chosen to call, more to the point, \u2018liquid modernity\u2019, is the growing conviction that change is the only permanence, and uncertainty the only certainty. A hundred years ago \u2018to be modern\u2019 meant to chase \u2018the final state of perfection\u2019 \u2013 now it means an infinity of improvement, with no \u2018final state\u2019 in sight and none desired.\n\nMore:\n\nThe modern mind was after perfection \u2013 and the state of perfection it hoped to reach meant in the last account an end to strain and hard work, as all further change could only be a change for the worse. Early on, change was viewed as a preliminary and interim measure, which it was hoped would lead to an age of stability and tranquillity \u2013 and so also to comfort and leisure. It was seen as a necessity confined to the time of transition from the old, rusty, partly rotten, crumbling and fissiparous, and otherwise unreliable and altogether inferior structures, frames and arrangements, to their made-to-order and ultimate, because perfect, replacements \u2013 windproof, waterproof, and indeed history-proof \u2026 Change was, so to speak, a movement towards the splendid vision on the horizon: the vision of an order, or (to recall Talcott Parsons\u2019s crowning synthesis of modern pursuits) a \u2018self-equilibrating system\u2019, able to emerge victorious from every imaginable disturbance, stubbornly and irrevocably returning back to its settled state: an order resulting from a thorough and irrevocable \u2018skewing of probabilities\u2019 (maximizing the probability of some events, minimizing the likelihood of others). In the same way as accidents, contingencies, melting pots, ambiguity, ambivalence, fluidity and other banes and nightmares of order-builders, change was seen (and tackled) as a temporary irritant \u2013 and most certainly not undertaken for its own sake (it is the other way round nowadays: as Richard Sennett observed, perfectly viable organizations are now gutted just to prove their modernization then was a road with an a priori fixed, preordained finishing line; a movement destined to work itself out of a job. It still took some time to discover or to decree that modernity without compulsive and obsessive modernization is no less an oxymoron than a wind that does not blow, or a river that does not flow \u2026\n\nMore:\n\nTo put it bluntly, under conditions of \u2018liquidity\u2019 everything could happen yet nothing can be done with confidence and certainty. Uncertainty results, combining feelings of ignorance (meaning the impossibility of knowing what is going to happen), impotence (meaning the impossibility of stopping it from happening) and an elusive and diffuse, poorly specified and difficult to locate fear; fear without an anchor and desperately seeking one. Living under liquid modern conditions can be compared to walking in a minefield: everyone knows an explosion might happen at any moment and in any place, but no one knows when the moment will come and where the place will be. On a globalized planet, that condition is universal \u2013 no one is exempt and no one is insured against its consequences. Locally caused explosions reverberate throughout the planet. Much needs to be done to find an exit from this situation, but remarrying power and politics, after the divorce, is undoubtedly a condition sine qua non of what one is inclined nowadays to think of as a \u2018resolidification\u2019.\n\nI think he is quite wrong about the source of our problems being the separation of power from politics, though that is what you would expect a Marxist to say. Still, his description of the disorder of contemporary life is spot on. Is there any wonder that people today are so anxious? About a decade ago, I read a psychology paper \u2014 I can\u2019t find it online now \u2014 in which researchers compared people who lived under conditions of oppression, but within stability, to those who lived without oppression, but in a highly unstable environment. It turned out that the people living in a more stable world were psychologically healthier than those living under instability \u2014 this, despite the fact of oppression. We humans want liberty, understood as freedom from outside control, but we actually thrive when that freedom is limited, and the society in which we live is more predictable.\n\nThis is not an argument for oppression, certainly. Too much oppression and too little liberty also deforms people. You don\u2019t have to convince Americans of this fact. But you do have to convince many of us that too much liberty leads to instability, which leads to psychological suffering. And that suffering has consequences politically, socially, and otherwise.\n\nLet me quote again Bauman:\n\n\u2026\u2018liquid modernity\u2019, is the growing conviction that change is the only permanence, and uncertainty the only certainty. A hundred years ago \u2018to be modern\u2019 meant to chase \u2018the final state of perfection\u2019 \u2013 now it means an infinity of improvement, with no \u2018final state\u2019 in sight and none desired.\n\nAs I explain in The Benedict Option, the current crisis of Christianity in the West is not something you can blame on \u201cthe Sixties\u201d \u2014 though events in that decade certainly accelerated it \u2014 or on any other specific event. It goes back to the origins of modernity itself. The Reformation is the signal event, as I explain, but the Reformation didn\u2019t come from nowhere. It became psychologically possible to break the unity of the Church in the 16th century because of theological and social changes that began in the 14th century. As the literary critic Erich Auerbach has written in his great book Dante: Poet Of The Secular World, only forty years separated Dante and Petrarch, but in that time, the Western world began to turn its back on Scholasticism and toward Humanism, with its celebration of the individual, and his power to dominate the material world. Auerbach says humanism arose from Christianity, and ultimately defeated it.\n\nGender ideology is the ultimate expression of liquid modernity. It teaches that not even the human body is a stable construct, that it too can be brought under the control of human will. Read this story from earlier this year in the NYT Magazine about teenagers rejecting the gender binary \u2014 they are genderfluid (!) \u2014 and try to convince yourself that this is anything other than madness. Here\u2019s a quote:\n\nFor anyone interested in nonbinary demographics, the surveys had another shortcoming. They excluded anyone under age 18, and according to clinicians who specialize in gender, it\u2019s among the young that nonbinary identity is taking hold most rapidly. \u201cIt\u2019s growing exponentially,\u201d Linda Hawkins, co-director of the Gender and Sexuality Development Clinic at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, told me about the number of kids and youth in her practice \u2014 from ages 6 to 21 \u2014 who identify as nonbinary. Hawkins, who was a clinical professor of Tate\u2019s, has been working in the field for two decades. She talked about the importance, for young children, of recent picture books about fluidity, and of education programs for pediatricians, who are taught to respond with calm understanding when parents report that their children say they are \u201cin the middle.\u201d At least, she added with a rueful laugh, pediatricians are taught this in places like Philadelphia. For older kids, the internet has delivered \u201ca surge of nonbinary information, of nuances in gender expression, in the last five years,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has connected kids to supportive communities. Looking back, there were always nonbinary kids, but it\u2019s only in the last few years that there has been the language \u2014 language to not feel alone, to have a flag.\u201d\n\nThe culture of liquid modernity is catechizing young people into this. I have no doubt at all that many children and adolescents struggle to some degree with their masculinity or femininity. What has changed is that we have abandoned the customs that enable these young people to navigate the fraught pathways to growing into one\u2019s sexual personhood, and left them to be preyed on by those who would disintegrate the human personality for the sake of ideological victory. Like this person:\n\nAmong the voices of the young, there are echoes and amplifications of Jacobs\u2019s optimism, along with the stories of private struggle. \u201cThere are as many genders as there are people,\u201d Emmy Johnson, a nonbinary employee at Jan Tate\u2019s clinic, told me with earnest authority. Johnson was about to sign up for a new dating app that caters to the genderqueer. \u201cSex is different as a nonbinary person,\u201d they said. \u201cYou\u2019re free of gender roles, and the farther you can get from those scripts, the better sex is going to be.\u201d Their tone was more triumphal: the better life is going to be. \u201cThe gender boxes are exploding,\u201d they declared.\n\nIt\u2019s going to be Paradise, if only you get rid of those \u201cscripts.\u201d Said the serpent.\n\nHere\u2019s something from the Times \u2014 which is the Pravda of the gender revolution \u2014 this past July:\n\nFor Jacob \u201cJayne\u201d Gervich, an assistant film editor from South Slope, Brooklyn \u2014 who uses the pronouns they, them, and theirs \u2014 identity felt like an elusive concept. Gervich, who was assigned male at birth, went from small-town Midwest boy to a self-proclaimed nonbinary trans-femme film editor and homemaking spouse. And one description they hope to attain in the future: a loving parent. \u201cMy wife and I are trying to start a family in the next few years, and we\u2019re trying to do it the old-fashioned way,\u201d said Gervich, whose wife, Allison, was assigned female at birth and identifies as a woman. The two have been together for about a decade and were married two years ago at a farm in Hillsdale, N.Y. \u201cMy wife would be \u2018Mom,\u2019\u201d they said. \u201cAnd I think what we settled on is that our child would call me \u2018Baba.\u2019\u201d\n\nAgain: insanity. The important thing to understand is that this is a phenomenon of liquid modernity and therefore makes sense in this cultural context. If Bauman is correct that the modern condition is now one of constant change, with the total denial of fixed categories, then the Gerviches and all the rest really are representative of our time. They are normal. They are what you would expect in liquid modernity. You might regard all this as beyond weird, but you should understand that your children are growing up in a culture that is encouraging people to apply liquid modernity to their own bodies and psyches.\n\nThe fight is not simply with those advocating gender ideology. It\u2019s with the spirit of the Age. It is a spirit that permeates everything. It certainly permeates religion. Classic modernity, in its most orthodox Enlightenment form, denied the existence of God. Postmodernity \u2014 liquid modernity \u2014 says it doesn\u2019t matter whether or not God exists; if we choose for God to exist now, then God exists in whatever form seems desirable to us, until it no longer does, then we can change again. Moralistic Therapeutic Deism is the form religion takes in liquid modernity.\n\nThis week a friend texted me from a dinner in Washington to say he was overhearing people talking about the Benedict Option as \u201chead for the hills.\u201d He texted, \u201cDid they even read your book?\u201d No, probably not. I think this is a typical response, even though the book has been out for two and a half years. A related response: \u201cOur kids need to be in public schools to be salt and light.\u201d It\u2019s well meaning, but completely blind to the reality that we Christians find ourselves in. The collapse of all standards around us is not an aberration.\n\nIf anything, the Ben Op book ought to have been more \u201chead for the hills\u201d than it is. I may have been too optimistic about the ability of Christian families and communities to withstand liquid modernity. The core point, though, is that the power of liquid modernity is such that trying to face it with ordinary Christianity is like going out into a hurricane with an umbrella and expecting to stay dry.\n\nI understand why many conservative Christians don\u2019t want to deal with the claims I make in my book. If I\u2019m right, then the comfortable strategies they\u2019re living by won\u2019t work, and offer false hope. If I\u2019m right, then they will have to change in ways they don\u2019t want to change \u2014 including letting go of the bland optimism that says everything is bound to work out fine. So it\u2019s easier to paint The Benedict Option as a neo-Amish tract, so it can be dismissed.\n\nIf the floodwaters are coming, you don\u2019t want to drown because the forecast was too upsetting to take seriously. Read Bauman\u2019s book about liquid modernity to understand the essence of our cultural condition: that the flood is already here, and we\u2019re drowning in it. Last week\u2019s polling data news from the Pew center on the collapse of Christianity in America is more evidence. Bauman was neither a Christian nor a conservative. He was a Marxist. But he understood something central to what it means to live in our time. We who are Christians had better take him seriously.\n\nHere is an eight-minute interview Bauman did with The Guardian before his death. Worth watching, even though he\u2019s wrong about the source of our problems being the separation of power from politics. If he\u2019s right about that, then communist China is the answer to our problems:", "description": "", "authors": ["Rod Dreher"], "top_image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-24-at-2.09.38-PM-e1571944204164.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
