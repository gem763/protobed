(Image: BBC)\n\nIt\u2019s now been over a decade since Susanna Clarke exploded onto the scene with Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, an eye-popping magical adventure. Fifteen years later, she\u2019s finally back with a follow-up novel about a watery labyrinth and its many mysteries. But that\u2019s not all we can expect from Clarke.\n\nAccording to the Bookseller, Bloomsbury has picked up Piranesi, Clarke\u2019s first novel since 2004's Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, an alternate history tale set in 19th century England where magic \u2014 once a powerful tool \u2014 has mostly become a thing of the past. Piranesi is described as an \u201cintricate, fascinating puzzle\u201d centered around a man named Piranesi who lives in a giant house with a multitude of secrets, hinting at something much bigger than the seemingly endless labyrinth... the only world he\u2019s ever known.\n\nPiranesi has always lived in the House. It has hundreds if not thousands of rooms and corridors, imprisoning an ocean. A watery labyrinth. Once in a while he sees his friend, The Other, who needs Piranesi for his scientific research into A Great and Secret Knowledge. Piranesi records his findings in his journal. Then messages begin to appear; all is not what it seems. A terrible truth unravels as evidence emerges of another person and perhaps even another world outside the House\u2019s walls.\n\nJonathan Strange, which took over a decade to write, was a critically acclaimed debut that went on to win the Hugo Award for Best Novel and got adapted into a 2015 television series for the BBC. Fans were eager to see the author return, but her \u201cpersistent ill-health\u201d prevented her from diving into another novel; she\u2019s since released a collection of short stories set in the universe of Jonathan Strange, but that\u2019s about it. In a statement, agent Jonny Geller revealed how Clarke had hinted she was ready to start writing again. Much to his surprise... she was basically already done.\n\n\u201cThere are a few moments in an agent\u2019s life when something so unexpected and so wonderful pops up in your inbox, you can\u2019t quite believe it,\u201d Geller said. \u201cSusanna hinted she may be writing again after such a long hiatus, but I never really believed a fully imagined world, a perfectly constructed novel, would just be sitting there.\u201d\n\nPiranesi is set to be released in September 2020. According to the Bookseller, Clarke is planning on following up with another novel \u2014 though it\u2019s unclear whether it will be a sequel or another original story.", "description": "It\u2019s now been over a decade since Susanna Clarke exploded onto the scene with Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, an eye-popping magical adventure.
