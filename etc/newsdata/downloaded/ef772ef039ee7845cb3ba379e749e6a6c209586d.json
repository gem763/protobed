Justin Trudeau\u2019s failings hardly need more amplification, those waiting for Andrew Scheer to \u201cget comfortable in his role\u201d would appear to have a good deal longer to wait, and just how did Jagmeet Singh get outflanked by both the Liberals and the Greens? Then there\u2019s Elizabeth May\u2019s phantasms and Maxime Bernier, the only man seemingly less suited to politics than Yours Truly. A seemingly rag-tag bunch, to say the least.\n\nMine, however, is not to comment on larger political discourse. Instead, I\u2019ll stick with the subjects \u2014 actually, subject \u2014 to which I am at least slightly versed; automobiles. Or, more precisely, the policy promises that might affect the cars we drive. In other words, that portion of the parties\u2019 election platforms that will affect Driving readers.\n\nLiberals\n\nFirst out of the gate is the Liberal Party. Not only is it the government in power, but Trudeau\u2019s team already enacted its auto-related programs during its first time at bat. To wit, we now have an up-to-$5,000 rebate for various forms of plug-in electrified vehicles that now extends coast to coast. In place for just five months, the trend is nonetheless apparent: In regions with a hefty local provincial incentive tacked on to the federal stipend \u2014 notably Quebec and British Columbia \u2014 electric vehicle sales are strong. In other provinces \u2014 notably Ontario, where the Ford government slashed EV subsidization \u2014 sales are in a malaise. The only thing that can be said for sure is, despite the prognostication of EV\u2019s staunchest proponents, the sale of plug-in vehicles is still largely dependent on subsidization.\n\nOne thing that may be added to the Liberal\u2019s 2019 portfolio is a 10 per cent rebate on used EVs (to a maximum of $2,000). That means the buyers of second-hand electric vehicles will doubly benefit from government largesse, used EV depreciation typically based on after rebate transactional costs. If, for instance, a Tesla qualified for a $14,000 giveaway during the Wynne regime, the total benefit to a used Model S owner could be as large as $16,000. All out of taxpayers\u2019 pockets, of course.\n\nAs for the other policy affecting Driving, the Trudeau government\u2019s carbon tax plan \u2014 at least the one it will talk about \u2014 is well known. Basically, we\u2019ll see taxes on a litre of gas increase 2.2 cents per year, which despite the angst-ridden headlines in the mainstream media, is really just a sop to party loyalists. No one, as I have detailed previously, is going to jettison even the most gas-guzzling of F-150s because the price of gas goes up 2.2 cents a year, the average pickup owner probably looking at about 50 bucks more a year at the pumps. There\u2019s virtually no chance the carbon tax will have any real effect on Canadian\u2019s driving habits.\n\nConservatives\n\nThat makes Andrew Scheer\u2019s promise to repeal the current carbon tax as shallow a promise to his faithful as Trudeau\u2019s. Now if Trudeau fils, as Scheer has previously contended, has secret plans (if he wins the October 21 contest, of course) to dramatically increase the price of carbon emissions \u2014 to, say $300 per tonne, compared with the $50 currently projected \u2014 then Scheer\u2019s alarm may have some validity. I will leave it to you to determine if that supposition is vote-worthy.\n\nAs for specific EV policy \u2014 i.e., rebates for electric vehicles \u2014 Scheer has not so far promised to retract Trudeau\u2019s EV subsidization. As for conjecture as to what they might do if elected, the Conservatives might be well served by their loyalists by cancelling the program. However, if a recent Abacus Data poll is at all accurate \u2014 it says 89 per cent of Canadians are in favour of subventing EV purchases \u2014 the current subsidies are simply too popular among the broad Canadian electorate to completely abolish. Those pointing to Doug Ford successfully turning EV subsidies into an election platform would do well to remember that Ontario offered a seriously-affronting $14,000 per car rebate at the time. Magnitude \u2014 not intent \u2014 would seem to be the reason Kathleen Wynne got tossed out of office.\n\nNDP\n\nIf there\u2019s a reason the NDP seems in a deep malaise, it\u2019s that Singh\u2019s policies are just more of the same. For instance, the NDP has promised to up Trudeau\u2019s ante to $15,000 per car, but only if said electric vehicle is built here in Canada (currently, the only vehicle qualifying would the Chrysler Pacifica). To further incentivize such local production, Singh has promised a further $300 million to resurrect the Automotive Innovation Fund with a focus on the development of zero-emissions vehicles.\n\nTalk about buying votes. If we estimate \u2014 and this is definitely a wild guess \u2014 that Singh\u2019s three-times larger incentives increase sales by 10,000 a year over the Liberal\u2019s plans, that would work out to a subsidy of $21,000 for each and every additional EV sold over the next five years. Not only that, the total \u2014 a billion bucks and counting \u2014 would probably bolster the market share of EVs in Canada by less than half a per cent. And because EVs require less manpower to build, there would probably be precious few new jobs added as well.\n\nElizabeth May\u2019s platform is big on grandiosity but sparing in reality\n\nGreen Party\n\nWell, as you might expect from a party that holds but two seats in parliament and no real hope of power, Elizabeth May\u2019s platform is big on grandiosity but sparing in reality. So, while cancelling the Trans Mountain pipeline is easily promised \u2014 duh, Elizabeth, Justin was never going to build it in the first place \u2014 and her claim she will upgrade Canada Post\u2019s fleet to electric vehicles does make some sense, her commitment to reduce Canada\u2019s greenhouse emissions by 60 per cent by 2030 and to \u201cnet-zero\u201d by 2050 sounds a little Timothy Leary-like.\n\nDitto her promise to make EVs affordable; her plan to exempt EVs, new and used, from federal sales taxes, barely puts a dent in electrification\u2019s affordability problem. Even more phantasmagorical is her plan to ban sales of gasoline-powered cars by 2030. Uh, note to Ms. May: Not even the most aggressive of traditional automakers \u2014 that would be the Volkswagen Group \u2014 has any plans to completely scrap ICEs by 2030. You do also know that plug-in hybrids, possibly the most sensible \u201cgreen\u201d vehicles for the next, say, 20 years, still have internal combustion engines, right?\n\nPeople\u2019s Party of Canada\n\nMaxime Bernier says he will scrap the federal carbon tax, withdraw from the Paris Accord, and abolish all green incentives, including, but not specifically mentioning, those for electric vehicles. Dude, I am considered a diehard piston head and even I know that\u2019s not getting you elected.\n\nBloc Quebecois\n\nWell, by definition, the Bloc should be largely concerned with local politics or, more accurately, politics that affect its locals. But, with polls showing that Yves-Francois Blanchet may well serve as kingmaker in the next parliament, suddenly his policies take on national importance.\n\nAnd in the automotive realm, the big question is if the the Bloc could force whoever its partner was \u2014 but most likely someone named Justin \u2014 to spread Quebec\u2019s draconian EV program across the country. For those who don\u2019t know, in La Belle Province, government decree requires that automakers increase their sales of ZEVs three percentage points per year until, in 2025, 22 per cent of all cars sold in Quebec are electric.\n\nThat sounds wonderful, except when you consider the success of governments past in forcing manufacturers to sell products consumers don\u2019t want. It\u2019s also, as almost all the industry contends, not effective in reducing greenhouse gasses \u2014 Ford, just as an example, could produce even larger pickup trucks as long as they sell enough EVs. Quebec will not reach its 2025 goals; extending the policy through Canada will just make the failure larger.\n\nMuch more effective ... are 'feebates' \u2014 which combine both a fee for fuel-inefficient vehicles and a rebate for fuel-efficient vehicles \u2014 that promote the retirement of gas guzzlers and subsidize the purchase of cheap, fuel-efficient cars.\n\nA surprisingly unrealistic electorate\n\nThe reason why EV rebates are a no-brainer for the three left-leaning parties \u2014 and why, I suspect, Scheer\u2019s Conservatives have so far steered clear of any definitive statement on their cancelation \u2014 is that they\u2019re quite popular with Canadians. As I said, fully 89 per cent of us are \u201cin favour or accepting of\u201d continued subsidization. Furthermore, 64 per cent of us also want EVs to become the majority of cars on the road. Sounds like a perfect melding of public enthusiasm and political will, doesn\u2019t it?\n\nThe problem is that an incredible 56 per cent of these same respondents think EVs will be in the majority in less than 10 years. Reality, however awkward it might make electioneering, says different. All plug-in electrics \u2014 PHEVs and EVs \u2014 still make up less than two per cent of Canadian sales despite 20 years of hype and, worse yet, all the plug-ins sold in the last 20 years still only represent 0.3 per cent of all registered vehicles on American roads. Not quite as rosy a projection for rebates.\n\nEven more problematic are the studies \u2014 the University of Toronto Press\u2019 Market-Based Policies for Green Motoring in Canada is just one \u2014 that posit EV subsidies are a particularly wasteful method to reduce automotive greenhouse gas emissions. Much more effective, say authors Arthur Antweiler and Sumeet Gulati, are \u201cfeebates\u201d \u2014 which combine both a fee for fuel-inefficient vehicles and a rebate for fuel-efficient vehicles \u2014 that promote the retirement of gas guzzlers and subsidize the purchase of cheap, fuel-efficient cars.\n\nWhat we\u2019re left with, then, after wading through all the rhetoric, is a policy espoused by the majority of parties \u2014 and not specifically opposed by the major right wing party \u2014 because it\u2019s beloved by voters. That same policy, however, is far less effective than more complicated alternatives \u2014 that would be those feebates thingies \u2014 that are either too complex to promote politically and would probably be wildly unpopular if implemented.\n\nIn other words, politics as usual.", "description": "If only solving the automotive climate crisis was so easy", "authors": ["Hours Ago"], "top_image": "https://postmediadriving.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/gmlkp_002.jpg?quality=80", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
