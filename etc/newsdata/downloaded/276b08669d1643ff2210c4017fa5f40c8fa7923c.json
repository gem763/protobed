Roth at the helm of one of the world\u2019s largest advertising holding companies.\n\nA 17-year veteran of Interpublic , Mr. Krakowsky, 57 years old, will continue to serve as chief strategy officer and chief talent officer and to report to Mr. Roth, who is 73.\n\n\u201cThe recognition he is getting now certainly puts him in a strong position\u201d to lead Interpublic, said Mr. Roth, who is also chairman of the company.\n\nIt is unclear when Mr. Krakowsky will take over the top job, but people familiar with the New York company said his elevation could come as soon as late next year although timing hasn\u2019t been finalized. Mr. Roth declined to comment on the timing.\n\nMr. Krakowsky\u2019s elevation is part of the changing face of Madison Avenue, as ad companies seek to restructure and recast themselves to keep up with the massive changes in marketing, brought on by the rise of data and technology.\n\nIn 2017, Arthur Sadoun was tapped to lead Publicis Groupe SA, succeeding longtime chief Maurice L\u00e9vy. Last year, WPP PLC named Mark Read as chief executive officer, following the departure of founder and CEO Martin Sorrell.\n\nAd companies are eager to diversify and reinvent their businesses as they face a slew of challenges, from clients cutting back on agency spending to changes in consumer behavior prompting clients to rethink their ad strategies. They are also trying to cope with disruption that Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc. \u2019s Google and other technology companies are causing in the ad business.\n\nDuring his time at Interpublic, Mr. Krakowsky has been involved in many facets of the business including acquisitions and restructurings. He also helped foster more collaboration between different agencies owned by Interpublic.\n\nMr. Krakowsky was a key driver of Interpublic\u2019s $2.3 billion purchase of the bulk of Acxiom Corp. last year.\n\nHe is also chief executive of Mediabrands, which houses all of Interpublic\u2019s media-buying companies. The division has been a critical component of Interpublic\u2019s growth in recent years. Daryl Lee, who serves as global chief executive of Interpublic\u2019s ad-buying business UM, will succeed Mr. Krakowsky as chief executive of Mediabrands, Interpublic said.\n\nA Madison Avenue veteran, Mr. Krakowsky joined Interpublic in 2002 as chief communications officer and has been Mr. Roth\u2019s right-hand man. He helped Mr. Roth navigate and understand the advertising business when Mr. Roth first took the reins of Interpublic in 2005. Mr. Roth helped the company overcome accounting and operational problems at some of its agencies, which spawned a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation.\n\n\u201cRoth, Philippe and [Interpublic financial chief] Frank Mergenthaler fixed what was a very broken company,\u201d said Mike Sheehan, a former chief executive of Hill Holliday, a creative agency owned by Interpublic.\n\nPrior to Interpublic, Mr. Roth had been chairman and chief executive of the MONY Group, a New York financial-services and insurance firm.\n\nInterpublic is the world\u2019s fourth-largest ad company, by revenue, and works on behalf of corporations such as General Motors Co., Amazon.com Inc. and Johnson & Johnson . Recently, the company has largely outperformed its rivals in terms of organic revenue growth.\n\nWrite to Suzanne Vranica at suzanne.vranica@wsj.com", "description": "Interpublic Group is promoting longtime executive Philippe Krakowsky to a newly created position of chief operating officer, putting him in line to succeed Chief Executive Michael I.
