President Donald Trump announced that US special forces carried out a military strike in Syria that killed the Islamic State\u2019s leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\n\nThe president and lawmakers lauded the soldiers and military leaders who participated in the operation and praised their bravery. Trump also thanked US adversaries like Russia and Turkey, which he said cleared airspace for US helicopters to make their way into an area near Syria\u2019s Idlib province, where al-Baghdadi was holed up.\n\nAl-Baghdadi\u2019s death was indeed a massive victory for the United States and its allies. And politically, the news is nothing short of a miracle for the president, giving him some ground to stand on as he battles a brewing impeachment inquiry and allegations that he leveraged US foreign policy in Ukraine for his personal gain.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting, though, that the US\u2019s operation against al-Baghdadi wouldn\u2019t have been possible without three key factors, all of which the president actively tried to undermine throughout his time in office:\n\nThe presence of US troops in Syria\n\nThe US\u2019s Kurdish allies in Syria\n\nThe US intelligence community\n\nThe al-Baghdadi operation wouldn\u2019t have happened if the military hadn\u2019t slow-walked Trump\u2019s Syria retreat\n\ncaption The Islamic State\u2019s leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, speaking in a video released in April. source Reuters\n\nIn the weeks leading up to al-Baghdadi\u2019s death, Trump made the abrupt decision to withdraw US troops from northeastern Syria, a move that caught Kurdish allies in the area off guard, opened them up to a Turkish assault, and effectively solidified Russia\u2019s dominance in the region.\n\nForeign-policy experts pointed out on Sunday that had the US military not slow-walked Trump\u2019s directive to pull troops from the area, the raid against al-Baghdadi wouldn\u2019t have been possible.\n\nRead more: Activist video purports to show moment of US raid on al-Baghdadi ISIS compound. Photos show the wreckage left in its wake.\n\nIndeed, the operation happened in spite of \u2013 and not because of \u2013 the president\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cWe must keep in mind that we were able to strike Baghdadi because we had forces in the region,\u201d Republican Rep. Michael Waltz, a former Army Green Beret, told The New York Times. \u201cWe must keep ISIS from returning by staying on offense.\u201d\n\nAs Axios reported, al-Baghdadi\u2019s death was ironic because it underscored the importance of having US troops in Syria. It highlighted the argument in favor of continued US engagement and why Iraq and other countries were so caught off guard and worried when Trump announced the troop withdrawal.\n\nThe Kurds played an integral role even after being abandoned by the US in Syria\n\ncaption Kurdish peshmerga fighters on the outskirts of Mosul, Iraq, on January 26, 2015. source Azad Lashkari/Reuters\n\nAlso critical to the death of ISIS\u2019 leader were the Syrian Kurds, whom the US effectively abandoned by pulling troops from northeastern Syria, allowing Turkey to invade.\n\nThe Kurds have long been a close ally in the fight against ISIS, and they lost more than 11,000 troops while working with the US to cripple the terrorist group over the past five years. But the president distanced himself from them after announcing the Syria retreat, saying among other things that the US didn\u2019t have to help the Kurds because they didn\u2019t help the US during World War II.\n\nThe Kurds, meanwhile, referred to Trump\u2019s actions as a betrayal, a sentiment that was echoed by US officials, Democrats, and even some Republicans.\n\nTrump, asked on Sunday about what role the Kurds played in al-Baghdadi\u2019s capture and death, said they had \u201cnot a military role at all, but they gave us some information that turned out to be helpful.\u201d\n\nBut it appears the Kurds were more integral to the operation than the president indicated.\n\nRead more: US troops demolished ISIS leader\u2019s suspected building to prevent it from becoming a shrine\n\nIn a press conference held shortly after Trump\u2019s, the Kurds said they began sharing intelligence about al-Baghdadi with the US five months ago. The Times reported that even after Trump retreated from Syria, the Kurds continued working with the CIA, helping to identify the ISIS leader\u2019s whereabouts and embedding spies within the group to monitor his movement.\n\nMazloum Abdi, the commander of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, told Foreign Policy he was the only foreigner to know about the target, an account independently confirmed to the outlet by a senior US official.\n\nIt\u2019s the intelligence community \u2018that he constantly derides that\u2019s helped him claim credit for killing Baghdadi\u2019\n\nSunday\u2019s announcement was also noteworthy because it was perhaps the first time during Trump\u2019s three years in office when the president praised the US intelligence community.\n\n\u201cWe had some incredible intelligence officials that did a great job,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s really a deserving name: intelligence.\u201d\n\nThe statement represented a stark departure from Trump\u2019s norm over the past few years.\n\nThe president has spent the better part of his time in office railing against the \u201cdeep state,\u201d a term coined by right-wing conspiracy theorists to refer to a secret cabal of US bureaucrats bent on overthrowing Trump.\n\nRead more: Trump thanks Russia and other nations for helping with the US mission to kill ISIS leader al-Baghdadi\n\nHis resentment stems largely from the FBI\u2019s investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election, which highlighted several troubling interactions between the Trump campaign and Russia-linked individuals. The president\u2019s attitude soured further after an anonymous US intelligence official filed a whistleblower complaint that now poses the most serious threat to Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve dealt with some people that aren\u2019t very intelligent having to do with intel,\u201d Trump said on Sunday. \u201cWhen we use our intelligence correctly, what we can do is incredible. When we waste our time with intelligence that hurts our country, because we had poor leadership at the top, that\u2019s not good.\u201d\n\nThe comments painted a stunning picture.\n\nIn the middle of announcing the death of the most wanted man in the world \u2013 an outcome that would not have been possible without the intelligence community \u2013 the US president took time out to air his personal grievances against the officials who were part of that apparatus.\n\nAaron David Miller, a former State Department official and senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told USA Today he found Trump\u2019s praise for the intelligence community ironic. \u201cIt\u2019s the very professional intelligence community that he constantly derides that\u2019s helped him claim credit for killing Baghdadi,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president has actively sought to undermine intelligence findings related to not just Russia but also other hot spots like Iran and North Korea. He\u2019s also accused the intelligence community of being \u201cun-American\u201d and suggested officials who speak out against him are guilty of treason \u2013 a felony with the death penalty.\n\nOn the global stage, Trump publicly sided with Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2013 who ordered his government to interfere in the 2016 election \u2013 over US intelligence officials during a summit in Helsinki last year. And he accused current and former senior officials of conspiring with Democrats and Ukraine to undermine his presidency.\n\nSo when Trump changed course on Sunday and heaped praise on the intelligence apparatus, it fell flat for some.\n\nChris Whipple, the author of \u201cThe Gatekeepers: How the White House Chiefs of Staff Define Every Presidency,\u201d told USA Today he thought Trump\u2019s comments were \u201cgrudging at best.\u201d\n\nWhipple added that Trump never directly mentioned the CIA and \u201cthat\u2019s no coincidence.\u201d", "description": "Business Insider - The US was able to neutralize the ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi because of the intelligence community, Syrian Kurds, and US presence in Syria..
