Based on measurements like sales and gross profits, they've grown increasingly profitable over time and left smaller companies in the dust, according to Ben Inker, the head of asset allocation for Grantham, Mayo, & van Otterloo.\n\n\"The top 50 companies really started to distance themselves from the pack by the late 1990s and today have opened a huge gap on the rest of the listed universe,\" he wrote in the $60 billion firm's quarterly letter.\n\nHe added that while it looks like US corporations in general have become more profitable, \"the improvement in profitability has occurred only in the largest companies.\"\n\nHe illustrates that notion with this chart, which shows big gains in profits for that top 50 in the past 30 years and clear improvement for the 450 largest companies after them \u2014 with a small decrease for the next 2,500 largest companies.\n\nThat's helped justify enormous valuations for mega-cap companies.\n\nWhile the largest US companies have become far more profitable in recent decades, and the next-largest have also enjoyed improvement, small caps haven't benefited at all. Grantham, Mayo, & van Otterloo\n\nAfter 20 or 30 years, investors might be convinced mega-cap stocks have a permanent advantage. But Inker said it's more likely it's at the start of a long fade \u2014 one that will ultimately make other areas more attractive as investments.\n\nHe argues that, over generations, even dominant companies lose ground to newer competitors and see their advantages fade.\n\n\"The history of dominant companies shows that their extraordinary profitability tends to decay over time,\" he wrote. \"For the most stably dominant companies, such as the ones favored by our Focused Equity team in the GMO Quality Strategy, history suggests that their profitability decays to normal over something like a 30-year period.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Inker argues that the growing market power of those companies and the political environment are turning from advantages into obstacles.\n\n\"The question is really whether the environment that has favored these dominant firms is likely to remain so biased in their favor,\" he said. \"The wiser bet is to assume the world will not remain entirely safe for dominant companies.\"\n\nGrowing regulatory and political headwinds are likely to affect the companies for a long time, he wrote.\n\n\"The growing interest in academia and beyond in studying the deleterious effects of large firms beyond looking at the direct impact on consumer prices also suggests a broader push against dominant firms on principle is increasingly likely,\" he said.\n\nRead more: Investors have triggered a recession signal with a perfect 50-year track record \u2014 and one expert says years of 0% market returns could be in store\n\nAnd Inker said some of the largest companies couldn't expand much further in their sectors. If they want to create new lines of business, they'll find themselves facing tougher competition because they lack the strong and lucrative positions they're used to.\n\nAll of that makes Inker pessimistic about the returns mega-cap companies will offer in the years ahead \u2014 and he extends those challenges to the broader S&P 500 index. He said a lot of the investments that giant corporations have recently trounced now have much more potential.\n\nHere are the areas he favors, with a corresponding exchange-traded fund for those interested in getting involved:", "description": "A $60 billion investing firm says profit advantages that have helped build US corporations into giants are fading, limiting the stocks' potential.", "authors": ["Marley Jay"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5ca7205916c95865657d7533-960-480.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
