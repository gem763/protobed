Jobs also managed to captivate people with products that ultimately failed, he added.\n\nGates used the 1988 NeXT computer invention as an example of this. Gates said it \"completely failed, it was such nonsense, and yet he mesmerized those people.\"\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk seemed to agree with Gates. In a tweet on Sunday, Musk shared Bloomberg's story with the caption \"Cat is out of the bag.\"\n\nCat is out of the bag ??\u00e2\u20ac\u008d\u00e2\u2122\u201a\u00ef\u00b8\u008f https://t.co/epUKm0a3gr \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 7, 2019\n\nJobs was known for being a harsh leader, and over the years there have been several accounts detailing his rudeness to workers, business partners, and even family and friends. This behavior was also mentioned in his daughter's memoirs.\n\nBut Gates said that while Jobs could be an \"asshole\" at times, \"he brought some incredibly positive things along with that toughness.\"\n\nWithout Jobs, who died in 2011 from pancreatic cancer, the Apple we know today would not have existed. He was credited with saving the company from bankruptcy in the late 1990s and setting it on a path to becoming a trillion-dollar company.", "description": "In a new interview, Gates said he had yet to meet any person who could rival Jobs when it came to picking and motivating talent.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2750/caf7a5cd478740dcb133350deea06903.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-02"}
