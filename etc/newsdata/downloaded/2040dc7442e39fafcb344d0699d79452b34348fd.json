Pulled my tricep, shoulder and glutes (a*** muscles for the scientists among us).\n\n\"I\u2019m all strapped up like a real dancer! I haven\u2019t done a cartwheel since junior school and I had to do about 200 this week.\"\n\n(Image: BBC/Guy Levy)\n\n(Image: INSTAGRAM)\n\nHe revealed this was hopefully the end of his cartwheeling career, adding: \"Hopefully last night\u2019s performance was the final cartwheels of my dancing career, and I can move onto something else if I\u2019m still in the show next week...\"\n\nThe high-energy routine scored a score of 26, redeeming Chris after his shaky start the previous week.\n\nHis Charleston with Karen to Take That's song Out Of Our Heads saw them shoot up the leaderboard, perhaps making Chris aching muscles worth it.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
