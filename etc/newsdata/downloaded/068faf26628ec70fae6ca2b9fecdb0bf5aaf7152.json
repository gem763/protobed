It is legally unprecedented,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Summers also claimed the US was involved in invading his client\u2019s legal privilege.\n\n\u201cThe American state has been actively engaged in intruding into privileged discussions between Mr Assange and his lawyers in the embassy, also unlawful copying of their telephones and computers (and) hooded men breaking into offices,\u201d he said.\n\nDistrict Judge Venessa Baraitser refused to grant defence lawyers more time to gather evidence and told Assange his next case management hearing will take place on December 19 before a full extradition hearing in February.\n\nWhen his case was adjourned, Assange complained that he had not understood proceedings, and said: \u201cThis is not equitable.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cI can\u2019t research anything, I can\u2019t access any of my writing. It\u2019s very difficult where I am.\u201d\n\nHe told the judge he is up against a \u201csuperpower\u201d with \u201cunlimited resources\u201d and appeared to be fighting back tears as he added: \u201cI can\u2019t think properly.\u201d\n\nAssange was jailed for 50 weeks in May for breaching his bail conditions after going into hiding in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London for nearly seven years to avoid extradition to Sweden over sex offence allegations.\n\nHe was due to be released from high-security Belmarsh prison last month, but a judge remanded him in custody because there were \u201csubstantial grounds\u201d for believing he would abscond.\n\nAssange faces 18 charges in the US, including allegations he conspired to break into a Pentagon computer and worked with former US army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to leak hundreds of thousands of classified documents.\n\nSupporters of Assange gathered outside court (Kirsty O\u00b4Connor/PA)\n\nFormer home secretary Sajid Javid signed an order in June allowing Assange to be extradited to the US over the computer-hacking allegations.\n\nIn May, WikiLeaks said it had \u201cgrave concerns\u201d about Assange\u2019s health after he was moved to a medical ward in Belmarsh prison. When he did not appear for a scheduled hearing, chief magistrate Emma Arbuthnot referred to the Australian as \u201cnot very well\u201d.\n\nWikiLeaks said at the time: \u201cDuring the seven weeks in Belmarsh his health has continued to deteriorate and he has dramatically lost weight. The decision of the prison authorities to move him into the health ward speaks for itself.\u201d\n\nIn a statement before the hearing, Massimo Moratti, Amnesty International\u2019s deputy director for Europe, said: \u201cThe British authorities must acknowledge the real risks of serious human rights violations Julian Assange would face if sent to the USA and reject the extradition request. The UK must comply with the commitment it\u2019s already made that he would not be sent anywhere he could face torture or other ill-treatment.\n\n\u201cThe UK must abide by its obligations under international human rights law that forbids the transfer of individuals to another country where they would face serious human rights violations. Were Julian Assange to be extradited or subjected to any other transfer to the USA, Britain would be in breach of these obligations.\u201d", "description": "Assange appeared at Westminster Magistrates\u00b4 Court on Monday.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/12/wire-19987732-1571656448-70_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
