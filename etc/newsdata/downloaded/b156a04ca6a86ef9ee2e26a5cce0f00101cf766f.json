China (24th) and Russia (43rd) remain well ahead.\n\nThe WEF\u2019s annual report, which has been issued since 1979, scores countries according to their institutions, infrastructure, ICT adoption, macroeconomic stability, health, skills, product market, labour market, the financial system, market size, business dynamism and innovation capability, and also surveys more than 13,000 business executives for their views.\n\nIt found that South Africa\u2019s competitiveness regained momentum after \u201cthe recent political landscape shift\u201d, evidently referencing incoming president Cyril Ramaphosa.\n\nSA\u2019s \u201cwell-developed\u201d equity, insurance and credit markets all achieved a perfect score of 100. The financial sector as a whole was rated 19th most competitive out of 141 countries. Scores on health improved, with 3.3 years added to the average healthy life expectancy since the last assessment.\n\nThe country\u2019s \u201cinstitutional quality\u201d also improved, with \u201cremarkable progress\u201d in some areas \u2013 including when it comes to the balance of powers across different state\u2019s entities, which now ranks 16th in the world. South Africa also improved its ratings on administrative efficiency of the public sector (+6.3 places to 39th) and corporate governance (+3.3, 26th).\n\nBut the WEF remains concerned about security (SA ranks 135th out of 141 countries), while transparency (62nd) and government adaptability to change (100th) are also below par.\n\nSouth Africa's rankings on various measures, according to the WEF.\n\n\u201cFurther, South Africa\u2019s competitiveness is being held back by relatively low business dynamism (61.9, 60th), which is inhibited by insolvency regulation and administrative burdens to start a business, and a persistently insufficient labour market flexibility (52.1, 111th). For instance, flexibility of wage determination is limited (41.1, 134th) and hiring foreign labour is difficult (40.6, 123rd). South Africa\u2019s sensitivity to exports of mineral resources is likely to hit the country\u2019s economic outlook and will make reducing unemployment (projected above 27%) challenging.\u201d\n\nAgainst this backdrop, structural reforms are needed to re-ignite the economy, the WEF said.\n\nWith a score of 84.8 (+1.3), Singapore is the world\u2019s most competitive economy in 2019, overtaking the United States, which falls to second place. Hong Kong (3rd), Netherlands (4th) and Switzerland (5th) round up the top five.\n\nAccording to the report, South Africa is the second most competitive economy in Africa after the island nation of Mauritius.", "description": "South Africa\u2019s competitiveness regained momentum after 'the recent political landscape shift', but it scored low on security and government's ability to change.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/3975/2bc7b513079d4dbbbbc104bf483e7692.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
