And it\u2019s not clear there is any way around it at all.\n\nNot even cabinet ministers know what the prime minister\u2019s plan is \u2013 when asked, chancellor Sajid Javid, replied, unconvincingly \u201cI think I do\u201d \u2013 and, like the Holy Grail itself, it may never be found.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nHowever, here are the options No 10 is believed to be exploring and their prospects of success:\n\nSend a letter requesting an extension as instructed, but also a second letter stating that the prime minister does not really want one.\n\nDismissed as a clear non-starter, because to comply with the Act Mr Johnson must genuinely \u201cseek to obtain\u201d an extension.\n\nThe John Major theory \u2013 use the privy council to pass an order, without requiring parliamentary approval, to suspend the Benn Act until after exit day.\n\nObviously unlawful, say legal experts, and certain to trigger a second rapid thumping at the Supreme Court \u2013 after last week\u2019s shattering defeat.\n\nIssue an order under part two of the Civil Contingencies Act, which allows acts to be suspended in an emergency such as riots, or civil breakdown.\n\nPatently, there is no violent insurrection going on, so this is equally implausible \u2013 unless no-deal fanatics suddenly start one. If they do, you read it here first.\n\nUse EU law to override Westminster law \u2013 possibly by invoking the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.\n\nIgnoring the farcical irony of resorting to hated Brussels law, one legal expert quickly pointed out that it makes clear the UK\u2019s constitutional decisions are entirely up to us.\n\nMPs pass a deal, removing the duty to seek an extension, but then refuse to vote for the detailed legislation needed to implement it \u2013 leading to a no deal on 31 October.\n\nFiendishly complicated, but perhaps Brexiteer Tories would be cynical enough to do this? However, the prospects of Mr Johnson securing a deal in the first place are vanishingly slim \u2013 and the newly unprorogued parliament would quickly step in.\n\nAs Dominic Grieve, the legal guru of the exiled ex-Tory MPs, put it confidently: \u201cThe law is fit for purpose.\u201d\n\nWhich means the prime minister, if he really intends to refuse to send that letter, needs to contemplate the warning from the former director of public prosecutions.", "description": "The holy grail for journalists at the Conservative conference is to uncover Boris Johnson\u2019s secret plan to escape his worst nightmare \u2013 the humiliation of being forced to delay Brexit.", "authors": ["Rob Merrick"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/29/21/johnson-manchester.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
