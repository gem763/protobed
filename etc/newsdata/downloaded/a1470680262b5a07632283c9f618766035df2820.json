Today at its Echo and Alexa-focused hardware event, VP Dave Limp gave an early look at Echo Frames. The glasses resemble traditional prescription lenses, but allow wearers to take Amazon\u2019s Alexa smart assistant with them anywhere and everywhere. Echo Frames are part of a program that Amazon calls \u201cDay One editions,\u201d which are devices, aimed at enthusiasts, that aren\u2019t quite ready for mass, widespread release. They\u2019ll be available on an invite-only basis for $179.99.\n\nEcho Frames weigh 31 grams, according to Limp, and can be purchased with prescription lenses. They do not feature any kind of camera. Built-in direction speakers aim Alexa\u2019s responses at you so they go unheard by those around you. The Echo Frames pair with your Android phone \u2014 iOS and by extension iPhones are currently unsupported \u2014 to read out notifications, make phone calls, and play audio including music and podcasts. A video released by Amazon shows that the glasses include swipe gestures.\n\nSmart specs! Echo Frames let you use @alexa99 on the go and keep your hands, ears, and eyes free. https://t.co/ugT22XhFIn pic.twitter.com/aku0fCuwbV \u2014 Amazon News (@amazonnews) September 25, 2019\n\nThe company didn\u2019t disclose a release date for the Echo Frames, nor was there any mention of battery life beyond them being \u201call-day\u201d glasses. Amazon didn\u2019t get into any augmented reality capabilities or other futuristic features. Instead, the Echo Frames seem squarely focused on serving as another Alexa wearable. At today\u2019s event, Amazon also announced the $129 Echo Buds and an Echo Loop ring, another \u201cDay One\u201d product that features microphones built into a ring on your finger.", "description": "Amazon is getting into the smart glasses race.
