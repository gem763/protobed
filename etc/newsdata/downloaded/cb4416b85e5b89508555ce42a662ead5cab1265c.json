It was not perfect and needed work but there were signs of a strategy. So what has happened to those plans?\n\nUnited began in that fashion against Chelsea on the opening day - even adjusting the press in the second period to spring the trap once their opponents reached halfway - but things have since fizzled out to the point where it is, once again, hard to discern what the players are being asked to do. There was a fleeting attempt at pressing Arsenal high up but it did not last and, the more games United play, the more cowed they look.", "description": "Away day blues", "authors": ["James Ducker", "Northern Football Correspondent", "Sam Wallace"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/05/TELEMMGLPICT000211516308-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqg-VWvOIJKlKo7WTGpl35mUTAcFcdqI5aSI3iIXPU0mo.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
