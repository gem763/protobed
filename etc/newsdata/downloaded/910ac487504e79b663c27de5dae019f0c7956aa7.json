Biggs blasts Comey's 'audacious' response to IG report, predicts 'stark revelations' to come", "url": "https://foxnews.com/politics/rep-biggs-blasts-comeys-audacious-response-to-ig-report-predicts-stark-revelations-to-come", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-09-01", "downloaded_at": "2019-09-02 07:14:46.698578+00:00", "text": "Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., tore into James Comey Sunday, accusing the former FBI Director of not understanding the severity of \u2013 or even the problem with \u2013 his actions, as described in a recent report from the Department of Justice\u2019s Inspector General.\n\nBiggs referenced Comey\u2019s reaction to the report, which suggested that he should receive an apology from those who accused him of leaking to the media. While the IG report did cite a lack of evidence that Comey leaked classified information to the media, it did point out that he leaked sensitive information about an ongoing investigation to a friend who then gave it to the media, and also failed to notify the FBI when he found out that other information he gave to his lawyers was later deemed classified.\n\nJAMES COMEY NOT OUT OF THE WOODS YET AMID ONGOING PROBES\n\n\u201cI think Mr. Comey basically is just dodging and weaving and I don\u2019t think he understands fully that what he did was even wrong,\u201d Biggs told Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d Biggs went on to call Comey\u2019s behavior \u201caudacious in many respects.\u201d\n\nThe report detailed how Comey acted outside the boundaries of DOJ and FBI rules when he kept memos that detailed conversations he had with President Trump. The IG\u2019s office said that the memos were considered government documents, not personal ones, as Comey claimed. As a result, he had no right to keep them for himself or turn any of them over to anyone else.\n\nIn the moments after the report\u2019s release, Comey tweeted, \u201cDOJ IG \u2018found no evidence that Comey or his attorneys released any of the classified information contained in any of the memos to members of the media.\u2019 I don\u2019t need a public apology from those who defamed me, but a quick message with a \u2018sorry we lied about you\u2019 would be nice.\u201d\n\nThe report, however, chastised Comey for his actions, saying \u201cComey set a dangerous example for the over 35,000 current FBI employees\u2014and the many thousands more former FBI employees\u2014who similarly have access to or knowledge of non-public information.\u201d\n\nBiggs and his fellow Republicans are eagerly awaiting the results of other investigations, one from the DOJ IG\u2019s office dealing with the FBI\u2019s use of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to conduct surveillance of former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page; another, a broader probe of the Russia investigation's origins, is being conducted by Connecticut U.S. Attorney John Durham.\n\n\"I anticipate that we're going to see some very stark revelations of manipulation of the whole system for political purposes,\" he said, \"and when you see that happen, that's when I think you're going to see references or referrals for indictments.\" Biggs claimed that the reports will uncover what was \u201cessentially a coup attempt\" against President Trump.\n\n\"I hope we see some accountability here.\"", "description": "Rep.
