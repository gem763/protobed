Crosthwaite, a senior executive of Altria, the Marlboro cigarette maker that has a $13 billion stake in the e-cigarette company.\n\n\u201cWorking at Juul Labs has been an honor and I still believe the company\u2019s mission of eliminating combustible cigarettes is vitally important. I am very proud of my team\u2019s efforts to lead the industry toward much needed category-wide action to tackle underage usage of these products, which are intended for adult smokers only,\u201d Mr. Burns said in a written statement.\n\nSan Francisco-based Juul also said Wednesday it would not lobby against a federal ban of non-tobacco flavored e-cigarette products proposed by the Trump administration earlier this month.\n\nMr. Crosthwaite, Juul\u2019s incoming chief executive, is said to be a regulatory affairs expert with two decades of experience.\n\n\u201cI have long believed in a future where adult smokers overwhelmingly choose alternative products like Juul,\u201d Mr. Crosthwaite said. \u201cUnfortunately, today that future is at risk due to unacceptable levels of youth usage and eroding public confidence in our industry.\u201d\n\nJuul is facing multiple investigations from Congress and state attorneys general. Both the Federal Trade Commission and the Food and Drug Administration are investigating the e-cigarette company\u2019s marketing practices. The FDA this month accused Juul of illegally advertising its products as \u201cmodified risk tobacco products\u201d without approval.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, Rhode Island\u2019s governor signed an executive order Wednesday to ban the sale of flavored vaping products in the state. On Tuesday, Massachusetts officials announced they will halt sales of all vaping products for four months, the first state in the country to propose such a sweeping ban.\n\nOfficials in Michigan and New York already have moved to ban flavored e-cigarettes.\n\nMeanwhile, health investigators are looking into hundreds of cases of vaping-related lung injuries. More than 530 cases have been reported, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including nine deaths.\n\nDr. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the CDC, told a congressional hearing on Tuesday that she expects to see much higher numbers of vaping-related illnesses and deaths.\n\nThe cause of the lung injuries is unknown, but all victims have reported using vaping products before hospitalization. The CDC is expected to release updated case counts Thursday.\n\nLaw enforcement officials in Minnesota, where a vaping-related death has been reported, said Tuesday they had seized 75,000 vaping cartridges that they believed came from out of state. Investigators are examining black market products in their search for the cause behind the vaping-related illnesses.\n\nAmid concerns over vaping, Altria and Philip Morris International (PMI), a multinational tobacco company, said Wednesday that merger talks are off the table. Instead, the companies are going to focus on launching a tobacco-heating device called IQOS.\n\n\u201cIt is hard to determine why the merger talks between PMI and Altria broke down. It is certainly possible that the huge cascade of bad press and international distribution issues Juul has faced could have played a role,\u201d said Gregory Conley, president of the American Vaping Association, referring to India\u2019s ban on e-cigarettes and intervention by the Chinese government to stop Juul sales.\n\nThe Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids said Juul\u2019s management shake-up strips away any doubt of what the company is: \u201cBig Tobacco.\u201d\n\n\u201cJuul created the worsening youth e-cigarette epidemic, and today\u2019s announcement makes it more important than ever that policy makers take forceful action to stop it by banning flavored e-cigarettes,\u201d the campaign said. \u201cJuul\u2019s announcement today is aimed at repairing its image and protecting its profits, not at solving this crisis.\u201d\n\n\u2022 This article is based in part on wire service reports.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
