REUTERS/Isabella Jibilian\n\nThis fall Osuna and a stream of fellow visitors have flocked to the stairway, known as a \u201cstep street,\u201d to see the real-life backdrop to a memorable scene in \u201cJoker,\u201d the hit movie that tells the backstory of Batman\u2019s deranged foe, the Joker.\n\nThe scene captures the moment that the loner Arthur Fleck, played by Joaquin Phoenix, transforms into the Joker as he dances down the steps to Gary Glitter\u2019s anthem \u201cRock & Roll Part 2,\u201d his hair dyed a menacing green and his face painted like a clown.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m visiting New York for the first time and I said that I have to come visit the stairs,\u201d said Osuna, a 46-year-old bus company owner from Tijuana, Mexico. He then broke into a theatrical strut mimicking the Joker\u2019s dance down the stairs.\n\nUntil recently not many tourists ventured into the Bronx, which has long sought to shake an unfair image as a crime-ridden backwater. The borough\u2019s biggest draws are the Bronx Zoo, the New York Botanical Gardens and the New York Yankees, the perennial baseball powerhouse that makes its home about a mile south of the steps, located on West 167th Street between Anderson and Shakespeare avenues.\n\nBut since the release of \u201cJoker\u201d two weeks ago, many New Yorkers and out-of-towners travelled there to gawk, take selfies and, in the spirit of the Joker\u2019s choreography, to ham it up.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something about his moves. He just killed it. It was in his soul,\u201d said Jay Garcia, a 30-year-old radio host from the neighbouring borough of Queens.\n\nFor longtime Bronx residents like Laura Harry, step streets are a common feature in the borough\u2019s hilly landscape.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve lived around here for 30 years ... people use them every day,\u201d said Harry, as she stood at the top of the steep stairs with her groceries, gazing at the people below. \u201cI\u2019m fascinated, because they made the steps famous.\u201d\n\n\u201cJoker,\u201d directed by Todd Phillips and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, has dominated the box-office for two weeks. It broke the record for the largest October opening weekend in movie history, at $96.2 million (74.1 million pounds).\n\nWhile the borough has struggled with its reputation as a dangerous place, it is perhaps ironic that a threatening figure like the Joker may have helped burnish its image.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good for us. You know, publicity,\u201d said Jose Cruz, a longtime resident who climbs the 131 steps at West 167th Street daily. \u201cPeople don\u2019t have to be scared of the Bronx no more, the way they used to.\u201d", "description": "Like most tourists, Patricio Osuna had a list of \"must sees\" on his trip to New York City: the Statue of Liberty, Times Square and, surprisingly, a steep flight of steps in an out-of-the-way neighbourhood of the Bronx that has become a cult-movie landmark.", "authors": ["Isabella Jibilian", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191019&t=2&i=1442710141&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9I0FE", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
