Sorry, but this is definitely not the one. Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nIf you\u2019re the sort who loves to get things delivered instead of going out to buy them, ride-hailing app Grab has a proposition for you this Mid-Autumn Festival.\n\nInstead of plodding to the nearest fair, comparing prices, and getting your ear talked off by salespeople, it\u2019s promising to deliver a nicely-packaged, S$82 box of four handmade mooncakes to your doorstep, without any of the fuss involved in mooncake shopping.\n\nOut of curiosity, I tried it for myself to see if it could be the next trendy way to celebrate.\n\nHere\u2019s how it went:\n\nGrab (yes, the ride-hailing app) is selling mooncakes for the first time this mid-autumn festival.\n\ncaption source Grab\n\nThe mooncakes, which you can order and have delivered off the app until Sept 13, come in a pretty box with a mid-autumn festival greeting card.\n\ncaption source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nFour uniquely Singaporean flavours are available: salted egg yolk, bubble tea, hae bee hiam (spicy dried shrimp) and ondeh-ondeh.\n\nThe flavours were created by home bakers and made with locally-sourced ingredients, Grab said.\n\ncaption The palm-sized mooncakes were hefty. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nI started off with a taste test of the bubble tea flavour, which is all the rage this year.\n\ncaption It was made by Melissa and Wesley Hoe of award-winning local bakery Cream and Custard. source Grab\n\nThe mooncake had a not-too-sweet filling that tasted and smelled just like milk tea, and a strip of brown sugar mochi that replicated bubble tea pearls to a T.\n\nI only wish there was more of the mochi, as the lotus paste filling got cloying after a few slices.\n\ncaption My rating for this mooncake? 6.5/10. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nOverall, I was deeply impressed. Given that this was the first mooncake I tried, things were off to a promising start.\n\ncaption I didn\u2019t expect to like the bubble tea flavour so much. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nNext up was a mocha and salted egg m ooncake, which Grab described as the \u201cperfectly balanced blend of sweet and savory\u201d.\n\ncaption It was made by Mooncake Mamas, a trio of three home bakers named Sharon, Christina and Jamie. source Grab\n\nThe mooncake was filled with tiramisu lotus paste, which tasted chocolatey and bitter (probably due to the addition of mocha).\n\nIn the centre was a hard and dry salted egg yolk.\n\ncaption It gave me a newfound respect for smooth, moist lotus paste I take for granted in regular mooncakes. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nUnfortunately, I didn\u2019t have a refined-enough palette to appreciate this creation.\n\ncaption My rating: 3/10 (Sorry!) source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nI\u2019ll be honest \u2013 I was full-on scared to try the sambal shrimp mooncake.\n\ncaption I prayed hard this wasn\u2019t too spicy. source Grab\n\nThe mooncake, which was inspired by nasi lemak, had sambal and chilli flakes incorporated into its skin. Inside was a filling of shrimp sambal and kaffir lime leaves.\n\ncaption Also made by Mooncake Mamas. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nAgain, forgive my unrefined palette, but I couldn\u2019t manage more than one bite of this.\n\nThe spice level was manageable, but the sambal shrimp and lotus paste made for a strange combination.\n\ncaption My rating: 2/10 (Sorry again!) source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nLast was the ondeh-ondeh mooncake, which I was actually excited for.\n\ncaption I love ondeh ondeh, and that rainbow aestethic was made for Instagram. source Grab\n\nThe Teochew-style mooncake had a flaky crust containing a layer of pandan flavoured mochi, which I (sadly) couldn\u2019t make out at all.\n\nIn the centre was gula melaka lotus paste containing bits of toasted desiccated coconut.\n\ncaption This mooncake was made by home baker Raymond Tan. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nI ended up being disappointed. This mooncake, like the chocolate one, had a predominantly dry and hard texture \u2013 but it could be because I didn\u2019t heat it up in the oven for 12 minutes as recommended.\n\nThe filling was so sweet, I had to gulp down water after a tiny bite.\n\ncaption My rating: 3/10. (Oh mooncake \u2013 I wanted to love you.) source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nOverall? I\u2019d still make the trip to that mooncake fair.\n\ncaption At least Grab tried. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nWhile mooncake delivery is genius idea, the flavours on offer were simply too out-there for me to enjoy. Adventurous eaters might have a better shot, but this is coming from a person who likes durian cheese sticks.\n\nTo be fair, it\u2019s hard to stand out in a saturated market, which probably explains the unique flavours, but parents and grandparents might find these hard to accept \u2013 making it difficult to share them with family.\n\nNevertheless, I didn\u2019t expect to like the bubble tea flavoured mooncake as much as I did \u2013 so if you\u2019re a fan of milk tea and pearls, that\u2019s the one to get.\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - The flavours on offer were simply too out-there for me to enjoy.
