The visit of the North's high-ranking delegation, which concluded on Sunday (February 11), has fascinated the South Korean public. But how genuine Pyongyang is about improving relations has been called into question.\n\nThe two Koreas are technically still at war after a conflict in the 1950s ended with an armistice, rather than a peace treaty. Any visit by President Moon would be considered a breakthrough for the leader, who has been pushing for a diplomatic solution to a standoff over North Korea's nuclear and missile programmes.\n\nFor now, scepticism remains. The South's main opposition party claims Pyongyang is attempting to fool its neighbours with \"their peace offensive facade\". And as both countries competed in the first weekend of the Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, a right-wing fringe group held anti-North Korea protests back in Seoul.", "description": "North Korea reports talks with the South were frank and candid, but no further mention has been made of Pyongyang's summit invitation to President Moon Jae-in.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/07/62/87/1000x563_story-bb36599a-0c7e-5734-943e-afee541cf175_775180.jpg", "published_at": "2018-02-11"}
