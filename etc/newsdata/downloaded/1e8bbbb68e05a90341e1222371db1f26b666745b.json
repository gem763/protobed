Its new ReCashmere collection is the latest example of that.\n\nEach piece in the Everlane ReCashmere Collection is made with 60% recycled cashmere and 40% extra-fine merino wool sourced from ethical ranchers.\n\nNot only are ReCashmere sweaters more sustainably made, but they're also more affordable than Everlane's traditional cashmere counterparts \u2014 and just as soft, too.\n\nRead our full thoughts on the collection, below.\n\nBetween its ethical and transparent approach to manufacturing and it's simplistic design aesthetics, Everlane has become a beloved brand for quality wardrobe essentials.\n\nWhile the Insider Picks team had great experiences with handfuls of Everlane products including popular styles like the Day Glove flats, the recycled plastic ReNew Collection, and Tread sneakers, its Cashmere sweaters are a true team favorite.\n\nNow, the brand is leaning further into its mission of sustainability with a collection of recycled cashmere sweaters for men and women. The ReCashmere collection includes classic sweater styles like crewnecks, V-necks, mocknecks, and cardigans.\n\nHow ReCashmere sweaters are made\n\nBy partnering with an environmentally-conscious mill in Prato, Italy, Everlane ReCashmere is made by collecting well-worn cashmere through recycling programs. The recycled materials are then sorted by color, combed, and spun with responsible extra-fine merino wool from non-mulesed sheep.\n\nThe end result is a 60/40-blend of recycled cashmere and merino wool, which is naturally sustainable. It's just as soft as Everlane's 100% Grade-A cashmere, but with half the carbon footprint.\n\nWhy you should consider them\n\nWhile sustainability and a reduced carbon footprint might be the biggest takeaways for environmentally conscious shoppers, the price should be appealing to everyone. In comparison to Everlane's Heavyweight Cashmere starting at $140 and Grade-A Cashmere starting at $130, every piece in the ReCashmere collection is under $100 \u2014 with the exception of the women's Varsity Cardigan, which, at $120, is still cheaper than traditional cashmere cardigans.\n\nIn my experience testing products made with recycled or upcycled materials \u2014 including sneakers, jeans, jackets, fleeces, and T-shirts \u2014 they've always been marginally more expensive than standard pieces. Everlane somehow managed to make the quintessential fall and winter wardrobe staple better for the environment and your wallet.\n\nWe decided to put them to the test to see if they're really worth buying over 100% cashmere pieces. You can read our thoughts below, but the short answer is that yes, they're just as great.\n\nRead our thoughts on the new sweater collection, below:", "description": "Everlane's new ReCashmere sweaters are made with 60% recycled cashmere and ethically sourced merino wool.
