Multiple high profile instances of racist behaviour have come to light across Europe in recent months.\n\nUEFA have a three-step protocol if racial abuse is apparent in a stadium: players must inform the referee; if taunts continue the stadium announcer will demand supporters stop; if chants continue the referee can lead the players off the pitch before deciding whether the match should restart.\n\nStriker Tammy Abraham says England are ready to walk off the pitch if their are racially abused\n\nHowever, Abraham claimed that England were willing to take matters into their own hands if anyone felt uncomfortable.\n\n'We've had several meetings about it,' said Abraham.

Don't isolate one person, we're a whole team. If it happens to one of us, it happens to all of us.\n\n'We did speak about the three-step protocol.

Watching the gaffer speaking yesterday, he was quite keen on putting a stop to it.\n\n'No one wants (racism) in football. It's not just affecting one person, it's affecting the team. It's a team decision if we decide in the end that we don't want to play this game anymore because of what's going on. We'll come off as a team.\n\n'We don't stand for it and we want the world to see that we don't stand for the silly abuse.'\n\nEngland play the Czech Republic at 7:45pm BST on Friday, October 11, and Bulgaria at 7:45pm BST on Monday, October 14.", "description": "England players have been wearing Black History Month shirts in training for their upcoming Euro 2020 matches against Bulgaria and the Czech Republic.", "authors": ["Matt Porter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/16/19499582-0-image-a-12_1570636059709.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
