The helicopter plucked those stranded on the second floor of a home submerged in muddy waters.\n\nAerial footage showed tractors at work trying to control the flooding. Meanwhile rows of bullet trains were left sitting in a pool of water at a depot.\n\nA stretch of Fukushima was also flooded, with only the rooftops of homes visible in some areas. Parts of nearby Miyagi prefecture were also under water. The Tama river, which runs by Tokyo, overflowed its banks.\n\nPlay Video 1:12 Torrential rain causes flooding as Typhoon Hagibis hits Japan \u2013 video\n\nAuthorities lifted rain warnings for the Kanto region around a becalmed Tokyo, where stores reopened and many train lines resumed operations, but they warned there was still the risk of rivers in eastern Japan overflowing and inflicting fresh damage.\n\nThe prime minister, Shinzo Abe, convened an emergency meeting of relevant ministers and sent the minister in charge of disaster management to the affected areas. He offered condolences to the families of those who were killed and said the government was working to save people\u2019s lives and property.\n\n\u201cThe government will do everything in its power to cooperate with relevant agencies and operators working to restore services as soon as possible,\u201d Abe said. The government had also set up a task force to deal with the damage, NHK reported.\n\nAuthorities warned of a continuing risk of mudslides. Among the reported deaths were those whose homes were buried in landslips. Other fatalities included people who were swept away by raging rivers.\n\nSuga said that damage to housing from the flooding was extensive but promised recovery was on its way. About 376,000 homes were without electricity and 14,000 homes lacked running water, he said.\n\nBoats as well as helicopters were sent to the flooded areas, while rescue crews dug through dirt in other areas to try to get people out from homes buried by landslides.\n\nSeveral train service in the Tokyo area resumed in the early morning while others were undergoing safety checks and expected to restart later on Sunday.\n\nRuling party politician Fumio Kishida said the government would do its utmost in rescue operations, including making sure that those who moved to shelters were taken care of.\n\nHe acknowledged Japan\u2019s power grids needrf to be strengthened so people in disaster areas could rely on timely information. \u201cSo many risks remain and it is a reality we must stay on guard,\u201d Kishida said on an NHK TV news talk show. \u201cWe must do our utmost. In these times a disaster can hit anytime.\u201d\n\nThe Rugby World Cup match between Namibia and Canada, scheduled for Sunday in Kamaishi, northern Japan, was canceled as a precautionary measure, but organisers announced that Japan would play Scotland as scheduled on Sunday evening.\n\nAll matches on Saturday had been cancelled, and stores and amusement parks closed.\n\nAs the typhoon bore down on Saturday with heavy rains and strong winds, the usually crowded train stations and streets of Tokyo were deserted, with people advised to stay indoors. But life was quickly returning to normal under crisp clear skies on Sunday.\n\nEvacuation centres had been set up in coastal towns, with tens of thousands seeking shelter. Kyodo News service said evacuation warnings had been issued to more than 6 million people.\n\nThe typhoon disrupted a three-day weekend in Japan that includes Sports Day on Monday. Qualifying for the Formula One race in Suzuka was pushed from Saturday to Sunday.\n\nThe authorities had repeatedly warned Hagibis was on par with a typhoon that hit the Tokyo region in 1958. But the safety infrastructure that Japan\u2019s modernisation had brought was apparent. The typhoon six decades ago had left more than 1,200 people dead and half a million houses flooded.", "description": "Military called in amid race to restore power and public transport following flooding rains", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d53d491807c25ab8ad5c20bfd0d4abe102da4220/0_140_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3050ba43f86e20644e2be3486e2775f3", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
