It seems their use has increased in recent months.\n\nEssentially, the components are clones of the legitimate software, which have been altered for illicit purposes, making them relatively easy for hackers to create.\n\nAttackers have been using different names for these fake plugins, including \u2018initiatorseo\u2019 or \u2018updrat123,\u2019 the researchers said.\n\nAlthough the plugins\u2018 code differs in terms of names, they do have several things in common: they have a similar structure and header comments from the popular backup/restore plugin UpdraftPlus.\n\nInstead of creating a malicious WordPress plugin from scratch, attackers can simply change the code of an existing one to include nefarious components.", "description": "Researchers have discovered several malicious WordPress plugins that are being used to\u00a0surreptitiously mine cryptocurrency by running Linux binary code.", "authors": ["Yessi Bello Perez", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/hardfork?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F03%2Fcryptocurrency-blockchain-hacker.jpg&signature=4c9c98feeea9446d37278b58c4fbc50e", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
