Saying \u201cHouston\u201d when he was trying to reference the mass shooting in El Paso; declaring how much he loves it here in Vermont while standing in New Hampshire; jumbling at least three separate instances of battlefront heroism into one fictitious, tear-jerking tale. Much as he denies, to Stephen Colbert, that they matter, the garbles and embellishments make the former vice president look careless at best, confused at worst, and they draw disproportionate media attention. Yet Biden remains at the top of Democratic primary polls, and in swing state matchups with President Donald Trump. Verbal sloppiness is not Biden\u2019s greatness vulnerability.\n\n\u201cHis campaign has done an excellent job staying on-message, hammering home that Trump is the issue and Biden is the most electable,\u201d a top strategist for a rival Democrat says. \u201cBut if you\u2019re betting everything on electability, what happens if the perception of his electability starts to slip? Then he\u2019s got nothing to stand on.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s advisers can, and do, dispute the notion that their man is relying solely on his supposedly greater odds of defeating the incumbent president. \u201cHis message about why he's running\u2014the middle-class economy, restoring the soul of America, and uniting America\u2014is one that really does resonate with people,\u201d says Anita Dunn, a senior adviser to Biden. \u201cThe problem with focusing on electability is not going deeper to why voters think he\u2019s the most electable\u2014their belief that he can clean up the mess Donald Trump has created, their familiarity with him as vice president, and their having a firm knowledge of who he is, what his values are, and the priorities he would pursue.\u201d\n\nThere are, indeed, detailed policy plans on Biden\u2019s campaign website, ranging from tax breaks for retirement plans to an expansion of Obamacare to rejoining the Paris Climate Accord. To this point, however, Biden has talked mostly about undoing the (inarguably serious) damage done by Trump rather than how he\u2019d break new ground, or on how his ideas are superior to those of his Democratic opponents. Dunn says Biden will be devoting more time to explaining his policy vision, even as he keeps his sights on the president: \u201cHe will continue to live by his rule, which is that he views the field as his competitors and his opponent as Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nBiden still has a long way to go before he makes the sale, and earlier this week an unnamed aide, on a conference call with reporters, seemed to downplay the importance of winning the Iowa caucuses. Dunn says the remarks were taken out of context, and the point was that Democrats believe in a nominee who is chosen by a diverse group of states. \u201cIowa is important,\u201d she says, \u201cbut sometimes the person who wins does not have momentum. Ask Barack Obama, or Walter Mondale.\u201d\n\nThere is good reason for this year\u2019s front-runner to be anxious, though. \u201cRemember, 88% of Democratic primary voters haven\u2019t made up their minds,\u201d a national Democratic strategist says, citing a July NBC/WSJ poll. \u201cSo when you see Biden at 30 in polls, that\u2019s not 30% for Biden. That is 30% who support the idea of Joe Biden as the guy who can win against Trump. Maybe that will be enough. This is just a different electorate\u2014people just want this Trump nightmare to be over, and right now Biden occupies the space as the electable one. But his entire campaign rests on that right now, and there is opportunity for the others in the top five to eat away at his case for electability.\u201d", "description": "Could gaffes eat away at the front-runner\u2019s foundation?
