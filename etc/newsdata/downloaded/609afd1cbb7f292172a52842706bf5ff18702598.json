From this, her journey to owning a Caltex station operation started\n\nIn 2011 she completed the Caltex Retailer Courses and the previous owner of the Mobeni service station unveiled an opportunity for her to buy a 30% share in the business and she grabbed it with both hands. Later that year, another opportunity arose for her to own the station outright. She received special funding from Astron Energy, the company that owns the Caltex license, to gain complete control of the business.\n\nBut how did she do it?\n\nKhumbu says, \u201cA fuel station is like any other business in that it requires hard work and a positive attitude. You have to consider others and not only think about your own pocket. It\u2019s not about money, all that counts is the love for the business, being focused, and facing what you need to accomplish.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: \u2018I quit my IT job to sell chickens and I\u2019ve doubled my salary\u2019 - here\u2019s how this 28-year-old did it\n\nShe admits that she\u2019s faced multiple challenges leading up to her current role but she has learnt to keep calm, even during difficult times.\n\n\u201cIt can be very stressful worrying about things like safety and customer satisfaction. You have to be balanced across all the factors that you need to consider. It helps to have relationships with people who have been in the industry for a long time,\u201d says Khumbu.\n\nShe oversees the petrol station that produces close to 10 000 litres of petrol and diesel a day that caters for trucks and small cars alike, with a staff of 13 working under her leadership \u2013 as she focuses on growth, support and incentivising excellent customer service.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe motivate each other and share ideas. I also offer incentives for top performing customer service attendants, based on their sales and customer service.\n\nREAD MORE: \"I'm debt free and save 75% of my income - this is how I did it\u201d\n\nKhumbu says owning the license to this petrol station is like living a dream. \u201cWhen I think of the way I grew up, I never thought that one day I would be blessed like this.\n\nShe says hard work and being confident and loving what she does contributed to her success. \u201cI love the fuel industry and that motivates me,\u201d she says.\n\nAs she continues to grow in her career, Khumbu says, \u201cI want to be the best that I can be in the fuel industry and I would like to help others to grow and see that there are opportunities beyond what they may recognise for themselves.\u201d\n\nHave you gone through a successful journey of your own?
