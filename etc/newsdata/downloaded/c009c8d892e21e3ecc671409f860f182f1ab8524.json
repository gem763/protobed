The Cardinals hosted the Brewers on Friday night.\n\nContreras, Hoerner and Nicholas Castellanos each homered in the first with the wind blowing out as Chicago scored five times - and then kept on rolling - after Pittsburgh jumped on Jon Lester for a 4-0 lead.\n\nHoerner elevated a low pitch to the center field batter\u2019s eye in his first plate appearance at Wrigley Field. He drove in two more runs with a single in Chicago\u2019s seven-run fifth.\n\nThe 22-year-old infielder made his debut with the Cubs on Monday at San Diego after the team announced All-Star shortstop Javier B\u00e1ez would be out of the season with a hairline fracture in his left thumb.\n\nCastellanos\u2019 26th homer, a two-run shot, tied his career high and was his 15th in 40 games with Chicago since arriving at the trade deadline from Detroit. He added his 50th double to tie for the major league lead.\n\nPablo Reyes had a double and triple among three hits, and two RBIs. Kevin Newman had three hits and an RBI for Pittsburgh.\n\nLester (13-10) got the win despite allowing seven runs (four earned) on 11 hits in five innings. Alec Mills pitched the final three innings for his first save.\n\nPirates starter Steven Brault (4-5) was tagged for 10 runs on Chicago\u2019s five homers in 2 2/3 innings.\n\nThe Cubs returned from a 3-5 trip to open their final regular-season homestand. Following a weekend series with Pittsburgh, Cincinnati comes to Wrigley Field for three games before St. Louis visits for the final four.\n\nContreras led off the third with his 23rd homer, to the batter\u2019s eye. After the Cubs loaded the bases against Brault, Rizzo lined a 2-1 pitch to right for his fifth career slam and a 10-4 Chicago lead.\n\nThe Pirates scored three unearned runs in the fifth, set up when catcher Contreras threw Adam Frazier\u2019s tapper in front of the plate wide of first with two outs.\n\nThe Cubs pulled away with seven runs in the fifth when nine batters in a row reached after two were out. Jason Heyward\u2019s pinch-hit double drove in three runs.\n\nFRUSTRATED AND UPTIGHT\n\nCubs president of baseball operations Theo Epstein called his team\u2019s performance on its recent trip \u201cuninspired\u201d and \u201cunacceptable\u201d in radio appearance on Thursday. Before Friday\u2019s game, Epstein softened his tone and emphasized that no one was \u201cbeing put on notice.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think everyone around the team is frustrated because we\u2019re not doing what we need to do,\u201d Epstein said. \u201cI think we all feel this is a team that should be winning.\u201d\n\nManager Joe Maddon said his team was playing \u201ctight,\u201d despite a roster loaded with players who have winning postseason experience.\n\n\u201cWhen you play uptight, it\u2019s very difficult,\u201d Maddon said. \u201cOur guys care too much, that\u2019s my interpretation. I want us to loosen up and play baseball.\n\n\u201cI think if we\u2019re able to do that over the next two weeks, we\u2019ll get the results we\u2019re looking for.\u201d\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nPirates: CF Starling Marte was out of the lineup for a fifth straight game with a left wrist sprain he suffered while making a sliding catch on Sunday against St. Louis. \u2026 The Pirates claimed LHP Williams Jerez off waivers from San Francisco and placed RHP Kyle Crick on the 60-day injured list. Crick needed surgery on his right index finger after a clubhouse fight with fellow reliever Felipe V\u00e1zquez.\n\nCubs: RHP Craig Kimbrel, on the IL with right elbow inflammation, threw a 24-pitch bullpen session on Thursday. Epstein said Kimbrel would toss another session on Sunday, but said there\u2019s no timetable for his return.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPirates RHP James Marvel (0-1, 3.60 ERA) makes his second major league start when he faces RHP Kyle Hendricks (10-9, 3.33) on Saturday. Marvel allowed two runs in five innings in his debut against St. Louis last Sunday. Hendricks is 2-0 with a 2.67 ERA in his last five starts.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Anthony Rizzo hit a grand slam, Willson Contreras launched two long solo homers and the Chicago Cubs kept pace in the NL wild-card race with a 17-8 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates on Friday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Matt Carlson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/13/pirates_cubs_baseball_18299_c0-180-4294-2683_s1770x1032.jpg?e4e06e521c1c0b341861bc8b5ceace64d2ce86ec", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
