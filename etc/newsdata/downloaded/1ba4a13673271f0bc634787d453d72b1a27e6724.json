(Ben Nelms/CBC)\n\nMissing since 2000\n\nFehr was last seen by her family on April 23, 2000. She was having Easter dinner in Abbotsford with relatives, according to police. She was five months pregnant with her third child at the time.\n\nShe left with her boyfriend that night to drive back to Kamloops, where they lived.\n\nIn the days that followed, family members did not hear from her. She also didn't show up to a scheduled pre-natal appointment.\n\n\"It was uncharacteristic for her to not be in contact with her family,\" said Supt. Jeanette Theisen, officer in charge of programs and special projects with the RCMP Provincial Major Crimes Section.\n\nTheisen said police had consistently followed up with witnesses and family members since Fehr was reported missing.\n\nFehr's father, Bob, said for years he feared his daughter was gone for good \u2014 but he always held out a sliver of hope.\n\n\"Even though you believe something has happened, when you don't know you're always in your mind thinking maybe I'll get a phone call; maybe I'll get a phone call from her,\" he told CBC News.\n\n\"[Now] there's closure that way ... but it doesn't make it any easier,\" he added.\n\nFamily plans memorial\n\nIn June 2016, the E Division Major Crime Section Special Projects Unit took over the investigation from the Kamloops RCMP.\n\nLarsen was arrested Sept. 15, 2019 and is scheduled to appear in court at the end of the month.\n\nPolice would not say what evidence what led them to the arrest and the discovery of the body.\n\nBob Fehr said the family is relieved a suspect has been charged. Relatives are planning a memorial.\n\nFehr said they are considering resting her in Abbotsford with her daughter, who passed away a few years ago in a car crash.\n\n\"[Angel] was a beautiful, beautiful young lady, and she didn't have time in her life to be what she could have been,\" he said.", "description": "Angel Fehr went missing nearly two decades ago; her body was discovered last week near 100 Mile House.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5298454.1569526308!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/rcmp-kamloops-homicide.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
