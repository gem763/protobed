But there was a lull in fighting in much of the rest of northeastern Syria.\n\nTurkey announced a five-day suspension late Thursday after a meeting between President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and US Vice President Mike Pence in Ankara.\n\nUnder the deal, Kurdish forces are required to withdraw from a border strip 32-kilometres (20-miles) deep, making up a \u201csafe zone\u201d sought by Turkey.\n\nThe Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said they were ready to abide by the ceasefire in the territory from Ras al-Ain to Tal Abyad in northern Syria.\n\nThe Turkish offensive was sparked by US President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement of an American withdrawal from northern Syria, leading critics to accuse him of betraying Washington\u2019s Kurdish allies.\n\nOn Thursday evening, Trump said he allowed the two sides to fight for a few days before brokering a truce as they were like \u201ckids in a lot\u201d.\n\nSince the offensive\u2019s launch on October 9, the Turkish military and Syrian proxies \u2014 mostly Arab and Turkmen former rebels used as a ground force \u2014 seized around 120 kilometres (70 miles) of territory along the border.\n\nMore than 500 people have been killed on the two sides, including nearly 100 civilians, while around 300,000 have been displaced, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory monitoring group.\n\n\u2013 Hospital surrounded \u2013\n\nKurdish forces have put up fierce resistance in Ras al-Ain, with a network of tunnels, berms and trenches that held off the Turkish onslaught for a week.\n\nAnkara considers the Kurdish forces to be \u201cterrorists\u201d linked to Kurdish separatists inside Turkey.\n\nTurkish forces and their allies had taken control of half of Ras al-Ain on Thursday when its hospital was hit, trapping patients and staff inside, Abdel Rahman said.\n\nKurdish authorities sent a medical team to rescue the wounded but it was prevented from entering the town, said Hassan Amin, a director of the hospital in nearby Tal Tamr.\n\n\u201cThe situation of the wounded is critical and the number is high,\u201d he said, adding that seven wounded people from around Ras al-Ain were however evacuated to Tal Tamr.\n\n\u2013 \u2018War crimes\u2019 \u2013\n\nTrump has come under sustained criticism in Washington over his handling of the crisis, not only from Democrats but from within his own Republican Party.\n\nThe SDF has fought alongside US forcers to defeat the Islamic State (IS) group in Syria and Iraq, but Trump argued it was no longer the US role to ensure calm in the region.\n\nThousands of IS fighters and their families are held in Kurdish-run jails across northern Syria.\n\nThe prospect that thousands of the world\u2019s most radical jihadists could break out in the chaos caused by Turkey\u2019s invasion is causing widespread alarm.\n\nThe Turkish offensive has also been widely criticised, with videos surfacing online allegedly showing captured fighters and civilians being executed.\n\nOn Friday, Amnesty International accused Ankara\u2019s forces and their proxies of \u201cserious violations and war crimes, summary killings and unlawful attacks\u201d.\n\nThere was no immediate response from Ankara, which says all possible measures have been taken to avoid civilian casualties.\n\nTrump welcomed the temporary ceasefire Thursday, but later compared the warring parties to children.\n\n\u201cLike two kids in a lot, you have got to let them fight and then you pull them apart,\u201d Trump told a rally in Dallas, Texas.\n\n\u201cThey fought for a few days and it was pretty vicious,\u201d he added, before stressing that \u201cnot one drop of American blood\u201d had been shed.\n\nBrett McGurk, former presidential special envoy for the anti-IS coalition, described Trump\u2019s remarks as \u201cobscene and ignorant\u201d.", "description": "Tal Tamr (Syria) (AFP) \u2013 Clashes between Turkish forces and Kurdish groups were ongoing in a battleground Syrian border town Friday despite a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/18/54829b_kurdish-held-syrian-border-town-ras-al-ain-has-major-goal-turkish-offensive-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
