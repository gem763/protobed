REUTERS/Ueslei Marcelino\n\nWashington also weighed in with its concerns about last week\u2019s poll that gave leftist Morales his fourth term in office, while main opposition rival Carlos Mesa called for a general strike in the capital of La Paz on Monday to protest the result.\n\n\u201cThe world is watching Bolivia\u2019s institutions and leaders to ensure that the voice and will of the Bolivian people are honoured,\u201d U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement on Sunday.\n\nBolivian Deputy Trade Minister Benjamin Blanco told state TV on Sunday that a deal with Washington-based OAS on the terms of an audit, including the selection of chief auditors, was being negotiated and should wrap up this week. The OAS said on Saturday that it expected to begin the audit mid-week.\n\nAsked if the government would agree to enact the audit\u2019s findings, Blanco said any deal \u201ccan\u2019t contradict what\u2019s established in our constitution and national laws.\u201d Morales has said he would call a second-round run-off vote with his closest rival Carlos Mesa if the OAS\u2019 audit turned up any evidence of fraud.\n\nBrazil, Bolivia\u2019s biggest trade partner, has said it would not recognise Morales\u2019 victory until an audit was completed. The OAS has similarly said the result could not be considered legitimate before an audit, given \u201cserious doubts\u201d about fairness and transparency.\n\nMorales has repeatedly denied allegations by the right-leaning opposition that he strong-armed the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) into giving him just enough votes in Sunday\u2019s election to avoid a riskier second-round election with Mesa.\n\nCiting \u201cmassive fraud\u201d, Mesa called for a strike in La Paz on Monday, which would intensify days of protests that have already seen electoral offices in some regions torched and large marches and strikes in major cities.\n\n\u201cWe cannot allow authoritarianism that is increasingly turning into a dictatorship rob the people of its will,\u201d Mesa said in a video posted on Twitter on Sunday.\n\nMorales had warned on Saturday that his rural supporters would siege cities that continue to protest his victory, alleging the opposition was stirring up unrest in a bid to unseat him illegally.\n\nMesa said the government was \u201ctrying to quiet the voices of the citizenry,\u201d adding \u201cwe\u2019re not afraid.\u201d\n\nVOTE TAMPERING ALLEGATIONS\n\nThe TSE has denied vote tampering since sparking an uproar for abruptly halting publication of results from an electronic quick count of ballots that had aimed to make last Sunday\u2019s election more transparent.\n\nWith 84% of votes counted, polling showed Morales was likely headed to a run-off with Mesa. But when the TSE resumed reporting of the quick count after a nearly 24-hour pause, Morales had pulled off a razor-thin first-round victory.\n\nSlideshow (6 Images)\n\nThe final, legally-binding vote tally gave him 47.08% of votes to Mesa\u2019s 35.51%, less than a percentage point over the 10-point lead needed to avoid a run-off and giving him another five-year term.\n\nProtesters say Morales had stocked the TSE and local courts with supporters as he has grown more authoritarian after nearly 14 years in office.\n\nMorales, who denies the charges, ran again this year in defiance of term limits and a national referendum that had oppposed lifting them, after a court ruling found barring him would violate his human rights.", "description": "The Bolivian government said on Sunday it planned to agree a deal with the Organisation of American States (OAS) within days to audit a controversial national election that handed President Evo Morales an outright win amid allegations of vote-rigging.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445665286&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R00T", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
