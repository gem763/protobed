You can form your own view.

I\u2019m obviously gutted, but it\u2019s fine.\n\nWere you surprised you were the one he picked out of the bottom three?\n\nI was surprised considering what we had to do in the task \u2013 I definitely think I beat some of the other people who were in the bottom with me, but unfortunately he chose to fire me.\n\nYou must have expected it a little bit considering you\u2019d lost five tasks in five weeks.\n\nI understood where he was coming from [because] I was in the losing team five times, but I wasn\u2019t the weakest link in the losing team every time. I fought my corner to the end, because I definitely don\u2019t think he should have fired me.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Since then he has set up his own pillow company, attributing his business success to his \u201csharp\u201d, \u201cstreet wise\u201d character.\n\nWho do you think should have gone?\n\nI personally think Ryan-Mark should have gone.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause Ryan-Mark has just been floating through the process. He\u2019s not been project manager or sub-team leader and doesn\u2019t really do as much as he says he does, but somehow manages to get through week by week. Whereas everyone else is throwing themselves in there, he\u2019s just sitting back. I don\u2019t really like those people.\n\nWere you surprised when he turned on you so viciously in the boardroom?\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a surprise, because everyone does it really. We all have to fight our corner so you expect it when you\u2019re in there. There are no grudges held \u2013 everyone is baying for blood, because everyone wants to stay.\n\nHow was Jemelin as a project manager?\n\nShe was fine as a project manager. Obviously there was a bit of a miscommunication with who was getting what items. I felt personally our team had all the hard ones \u2013 the rigger jigger, the snaffle \u2013 and they had eggs and apples. Where\u2019s the fairness in that? I think she was fine, but maybe not correct for this exact one because she didn\u2019t know the areas. But overall, I thought she was great.\n\nWhat was it like watching back and realising you did get told what TOAD was? (It's a gin you can purchase at The Oxford Artisan Distillery).\n\nAfter watching the episode, I can definitely see very clearly where I went wrong. [laughs] It was the hardest thing tracking down what those items were, so I think we got caught up in the moment and misheard it. Pamela told us flat out that the person [she spoke to on the phone] was wrong! I know it\u2019s ridiculous, but that person told her it was vodka and it turned out to be gin, so whatever happened we were always going to lose.\n\nPamela escaped unscathed, really.\n\nLooking back, if she had taken the blame for not hearing about the TOAD, she might have been in the bottom. But that kind of got rushed past, so she saved herself there.\n\nWho was the hardest to work with?\n\nIt really changes task by task. Let\u2019s just say that there\u2019s no one in particular, but a lot of them.\n\nWhich candidate would you say is getting away with the most?\n\nI don\u2019t want to keep bringing him up, but I\u2019ll say him again: Ryan-Mark. I can see a lot of people are getting through when they shouldn\u2019t be getting through, but you\u2019ve got to respect people for actually trying instead of trying to hold out to just get more airtime.\n\nWho would you say the favourites to win currently are?\n\nIt honestly changes each week. For five weeks, I was saying myself. I\u2019ll just say who I generally like: Thomas, Jemelin, Karina. I think they\u2019re gonna go the slog.\n\nNot Lottie?\n\nI mean, Lottie will do Lottie throughout the process and wherever she gets, it\u2019s on her. She\u2019s beaten me, so I don\u2019t know what they see.\n\nWhat prompted you to apply in the first place?\n\nI have a business called Middle Eastern Kitchen, which is a cooking sauce company. I launched it and thought, \u201cI need to get on this show.\u201d I\u2019ve watched it every year; I\u2019m one of those people who shouts, \u201cI could do that!\u201d So I wrote it up on my little new year\u2019s resolution list, applied for it, went through the auditions and got it.\n\nDo you have any regrets?\n\nMy only regrets were constantly putting myself forward as project manager and putting myself on the chopping block a bit too much. The toy task, too. I\u2019m obviously really gutted that I\u2019ve been kicked out, but looking back, I\u2019m so grateful and proud that I don\u2019t really have any regrets.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for you?\n\nMy main job is actor and presenter, so I will always continually be doing that. But I have my Middle Eastern Kitchen company and Auditions, which is my card game. I\u2019m pushing both of those to whatever it can be while also focusing on the entertainment part of my life as well.\n\nThe Apprentice continues weekly Wednesdays on BBC One at 9pm", "description": "The latest\u00a0Apprentice\u00a0candidate to be fired by Lord Sugar has been revealed \u2013 and he doesn\u2019t think the right choice was made.
