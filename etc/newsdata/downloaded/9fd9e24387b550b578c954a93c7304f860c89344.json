Louie Douvis\n\nIn his view, greater price signals and the integration of emissions reduction and reliability standards will be required before boards will ever approve the expensive long-term investment in projects like gas peaking plants or pumped hydro or storage.\n\n\"A decade of policy inertia, including failed attempts at major energy and climate policy reform and market design, has made it very difficult for a board to commit capital expenditure on long-dated assets of 20 or 30 years or more into such an uncertain market where the rules can change at any time,\u201d he told The Australian Financial Review National Energy Summit. Government interventions, including introducing the \u201cbig stick\u201d legislation that threatens big energy companies with forced divestment, only act as a further handbrake, he argues, at a time when \u201cthe investment challenge for this industry is staggeringly large\u201d.\n\nAs an example of how to encourage investment, he points to the massive impact of the renewable energy target.\n\n\u201cThere is a cause and effect,\u201d Calabria said. \u201cYou send a strong enough signal and then you will get investment to flow and the capital will flow.\n\n\u201cIt's very hard to argue today that the NEM is working well right now with prices and reliability a concern each summer. There's been very little investment into dispatchable generation ...\n\n\u201cRight now, the price of firming energy is not enough to ensure what you need to make the system reliable will be built.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe RET is hardly a model the Morrison government intends to follow. Kerry Schott from the Energy Security Board may be an expert in navigating the perilous shoals of Australia\u2019s energy market, noting the damage done by years of escalating prices.\n\nBut she also believes new investment in dispatchable power will be \u201cchallenging\u201d while expensive efforts to keep aged coal power plants running are \u201cill advised\u201d.\n\nThat is because coal-fired power stations can\u2019t simply switch on and off to meet the changed market dynamics given they are built to run all day. The onslaught of renewables often decimates demand for coal power during the day, with wholesale prices at close to zero or even negative. Despite efforts to increase the ability of coal-fired power stations to ramp up and down, this has limited effectiveness \u2013 especially given the age of most plants.\n\n\"They are dinosaurs in that sense,'' Schott said. \"What we actually need in the market is energy that is both firm and flexible.\"\n\nAccording to the federal Energy Minister, however, the only realistic options are still coal, gas and hydro. He argues alternative technologies like batteries have potential but are still too immature beyond niche applications.\n\nHe is certainly not about to concede keeping coal-fired generators going is anything other than logical and necessary.\n\n\u201cThe threat of premature baseload closures is dire,\u201d he told the Financial Review Energy Summit, explaining why the government has a taskforce to consider the closure of AGL'S Liddell plant in NSW in 2023.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe need either like-for-like replacement (in terms of reliability and affordability) or life extension. Some vague hope of transmission, intermittent generation and demand management filling the gap is not good enough. For too long this industry has suffered from the triumph of hope over reality. Not this time.\u201d\n\nBut one of the levers Taylor had relied upon to force more dispatchable power into the market from big private sector players is effectively in regulatory limbo. That is the \u201creliability obligation\u201d imposed on retailers to ensure they have enough dispatchable power. The catch is this first requires the Australian Market Energy Operator, one of the plethora of regulators in the energy system, to predict a shortage within three years.\n\nThis is yet to happen, in part because of the strict technical rules governing the \u201creliability standard\u201d that can trigger this finding. Even expert Schott says she is surprised by this.\n\nThat leaves the government back to underwriting such generation instead. But Calabria points out that any government is unlikely to want to back the hundreds of billions of dollars required longer term.\n\nAt least there is agreement on one thing \u2013 the current system isn\u2019t delivering what\u2019s needed in terms of affordable, reliable energy alongside declining carbon emissions.", "description": "The Morrison government is focused on getting more dispatchable energy into the system.
