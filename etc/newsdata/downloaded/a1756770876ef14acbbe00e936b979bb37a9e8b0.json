For a limited time, the TV is on sale for $199.99, which is a massive $130 off the normal price of $329.99.\n\nAmazon's Fire TV operating system works with Alexa so you can use your voice to control your TV, search for TV shows, manage other smart devices in your home, find out information from the web, and so on. You can also stream video from many of the most popular streaming apps like Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, SlingTV, and HBO.\n\nToshiba's 43-inch TV has a 4K resolution along with HDR support, so you should get great image quality. On top of that, the TV comes with three HDMI ports and a USB port so you can connect other devices like gaming consoles to the TV.\n\nThe TV is available in 50-inch and 55-inch sizes too, but you won't save quite as much cash on those models. We don't know how long this deal will last, so if you're interested, you may want to act quickly.", "description": "If you already have Amazon smart home devices at home, you can continue building the network with Toshiba's 43-inch Fire TV, currently $130 off.", "authors": ["Christian De Looper"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8938d42e22af2b3b011853-1136-568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
