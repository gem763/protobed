But even as Trump abandoned the Kurds and unleashed this disaster, he was actually increasing the number of American soldiers in the Middle East \u2014 sending some 3,000 additional troops to Saudi Arabia.\n\nSo we\u2019re sending more troops to Saudi Arabia to help a misogynist dictatorship that kills a journalist for an American newspaper, even as we betray the Kurds who have been trying to build a democratic enclave that empowers women; we\u2019re sending troops to Saudi Arabia to confront Iran, even as we give Iran a helping hand in Syria.\n\nThis is where incoherence and inhumanity converge.\n\n\u201cForeign policy is what I\u2019ll be remembered for,\u201d Trump boasted in 2017 to my colleague David E. Sanger. Well, um, yes.\n\nBy failing to prepare for a phone call with Turkey\u2019s leader, and then allowing himself to be manipulated, Trump undid years of work in the Middle East. But he also is corroding the entire 75-year-old American postwar international order, built on American credibility and values. Everyone knew that the United States did not always live up to its rhetoric but also that its ideals and commitments counted for something. Until now.\n\nI began this column with a note of praise for Obama for confronting the Yazidi genocide and saving many lives. It\u2019s also true that Syria was Obama\u2019s greatest foreign policy failure, and I repeatedly criticized his passivity as hundreds of thousands were killed.\n\nYet at least Obama was always wrestling deeply with the issues, seeking out expert opinions and trying to make the most informed decisions possible. While I questioned his judgment on Syria, I never doubted his seriousness , compassion or integrity.\n\nTrump in contrast is callow, reckless and indifferent. What he has done in Syria is not foreign policy. It is vandalism.\n\n\u00b7\n\nEvery December I publish a \u201choliday gift guide\u201d column that offers ideas for readers looking to contribute to great causes, and now there\u2019s an exciting twist: One reader has committed $1 million for a $100,000 award to my top charity for each of the next 10 years.
