Foreign leaders feel emboldened to reject his pleas or to contradict him. Officials inside his administration are openly defying his wishes by participating in the impeachment probe. Federal courts have ruled against him. Republican lawmakers are criticizing him. He has lost control over major conservative media organs. Polling shows that Americans increasingly disapprove of his job performance and support his impeachment\u2026\n\n\u201cWhen he got on the phone call with Erdogan, he was weak as could be,\u201d Schumer said Thursday on MSNBC. \u201cHe should have told Erdogan: \u2018You can\u2019t do this. America\u2019s not going to let you do this.\u2019 Instead, he green-lights Erdogan, and then a few hours later sends this ranting, rambling letter that shows ersatz toughness \u2014 and to show you the effect, Erdogan ignored the letter.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Trump\u2019s claim of brokering a major trade \u201cdeal\u201d with China after months of acrimonious negotiations has been undermined in Beijing, where Chinese officials for the past week have refused to confirm key elements of the supposed agreement \u2014 a clear sign of continuing disagreement between the two parties.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s deflating when the curtain is pulled back and the Wizard of Oz is a little guy,\u201d said David Axelrod, who served as senior adviser in the Obama White House. \u201cIf your whole predicate is strength and everywhere you turn there are signs of weakness, it is a danger.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Washingtonpost.Com Politics Trumps-Season-Of-Weakness-A-President-Who-Prizes-Strength-Enters-Key-Stretch-In-A-Fragile-State"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
