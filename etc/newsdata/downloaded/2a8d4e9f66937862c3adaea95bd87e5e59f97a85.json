His glove came off as Turner lunged for the bag, the ball bounced into foul territory and Turner and fellow baserunner Yan Gomes took an extra base.\n\nBut the play was called back, with the umpires arguing that Turner interfered with Gurriel trying to catch the ball.\n\nAfter a lengthy replay review, the umpires upheld their original call. Turner was out.\n\nNobody watching seemed to agree.\n\nHere\u2019s the biggest problem with that call: If Brad Peacock doesn\u2019t make a bad throw to first base, Yuli Gurriel isn\u2019t stretched into the baseline. If he\u2019s not stretched into the baseline, Trea Turner doesn\u2019t run into him.\n\n\n\nSo \u2026 you penalize Turner for a crap Peacock throw? Huh? \u2014 Jeff Passan (@JeffPassan) October 30, 2019\n\nTrea Turner: \u201cJoe Torre is sitting right there \u2026 he\u2019s sitting with his head down trying not to look up.\u201d pic.twitter.com/BM92dbAKGN \u2014 Joon Lee (@joonlee) October 30, 2019\n\nP.S. Dave Martinez was fuming. As Will Harris comes in for the Astros, Martinez is still pacing around the diamond, talking to some of the umps. #Nats \u2014 Adam Zielonka (@Adam_Zielonka) October 30, 2019\n\nMartinez tried to confront an umpire after the inning, yelling and drawing very close to him. He was restrained by bench coach Chip Hale and first-base coach Tim Bogar, but at one point broke free of their grasp to run back toward the umpire.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
