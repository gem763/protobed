His son was on the board of Burisma for a number of years.\n\nKurt Volker, who resigned a week ago as Trump's special representative to Ukraine, provided the messages to members of the House and staff of the House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight committees in a closed-door meeting earlier on Thursday.\n\nDemocrats are focusing on a July 25 telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in which the Republican president urges Zelenskiy to investigate Burisma and the Bidens.\n\nIn the hours before that call, Volker told one adviser to the Ukrainian president that a meeting between the countries' two leaders was tied to Kiev's agreement to investigate the 2016 U.S. election, according to the committees.\n\n\"Heard from the White House -- assuming President Z convinces trump he will investigate/'get to the bottom of what happened' in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington,\" Volker wrote.\n\nLater messages between the aide, Andriy Yermak, and Volker showed dueling efforts to lock in a date for a Trump-Zelenskiy meeting and to issue a statement from Kiev announcing a \"reboot\" of relations along with the probes into Burisma and the 2016 election.\n\nIn a separate exchange last month, another top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine wrote that it was \"crazy\" to withhold military aid for the country as it confronted Russian aggression, according to copies of the messages released by the panel's Democratic chairmen, who noted their \"grave concerns.\"\n\nThe cache also included messages from Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who played a major part in the administration's dealings with Kiev.\n\nJoe Biden leads in most opinion polls among the 19 Democrats seeking the party's nomination to take on Trump in the November 2020 election. His campaign has blasted Trump's efforts as desperate.\n\nIn a signal of how Kiev will handle investigations being watched in Washington, Ukrainian prosecutors said they would review 15 old probes related to Burisma's founder but added that they were unaware of any evidence of wrongdoing by Biden's son.\n\n\n\n\n\nWHITE HOUSE DOCUMENTS\n\nSeparately, the White House plans to argue that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, must have the full House vote to formally approve an impeachment inquiry, a source familiar with the effort said.\n\nWithout a vote, White House lawyers believe Trump, who has called the impeachment probe a \"hoax,\" can ignore lawmakers' requests, the source said, meaning the federal courts would presumably have to render a decision and potentially slow the march toward impeachment.\n\nA White House letter arguing Pelosi must hold a House vote could be sent to Capitol Hill as early as Friday, the source said. It comes as the Democratic-led House Intelligence Committee plans to issue more subpoenas in the coming days as it pushes ahead with the investigation.\n\n\"Congress must not back down from our duty to defend the Constitution as ... (Trump) ignores the Founders\u2019 warnings about foreign interference at every turn,\" Pelosi tweeted early on Friday.\n\nTrump's gambit is emerging at the end of a storm-tossed week for him as the president lashed out at Democrats, reporters and anyone else standing in his way to air complaints that he was being unfairly accused and had done nothing wrong.\n\nTrump sees the impeachment probe as a harassing follow-up to the Russia probe that investigated accusations he colluded with Moscow in the 2016 presidential campaign. Russia denies interfering in the election.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies and Special Counsel Robert Mueller concluded Russia did interfere with a scheme of hacking and propaganda to boost Trump\u2019s candidacy and disparage his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton.", "description": "President Donald Trump's bitter fight against an impeachment inquiry has not slowed down the Democrats' push to investigate whether he sought personal political gain by urging Ukraine to probe Democratic opponent Joe Biden.
