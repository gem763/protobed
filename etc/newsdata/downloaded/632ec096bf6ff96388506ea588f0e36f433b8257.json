The question inevitably becomes: How do we solve the problem of an aging population in Canada?\n\n\n\nFirst of all, says Olive Bryanton, that\u2019s the wrong question. The 82-year-old activist has been trying to change the conversation \u2014 to ask the right questions \u2014 for decades.\n\n\n\nThe documentary Never Too Old follows Bryanton, who lives in Hampshire, P.E.I., through her PhD studies at the University of Prince Edward Island (UPEI). She\u2019s outspoken about her research, activism and purpose.\n\n\n\n\u201cCertainly through the news media, through our government, when you read the [headlines], they talk about \u2018solving the problem of aging,\u2019\u201d Bryanton says. \u201cSo when did aging become a problem? It\u2019s a normal process of life.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou read about the burden of older adults or the \u2018grey tsunami\u2019 \u2026 we\u2019re always talking about the vulnerability of older adults. But in reality, everyone has their strengths and their capacities. So rather than looking at vulnerabilities, why aren\u2019t we looking at their strengths? And how can we build on those strengths?\u201d\n\n\n\nThose are the right questions, Bryanton says. And in her eighth decade, she\u2019s still gathering the answers.\n\nPioneers in aging\n\nBryanton\u2019s PhD dissertation involved researching 10 women over the age of 85 who live in rural areas of the province \u2014 \u201cpioneers in aging\u201d as she calls them, since they\u2019re living past Canada\u2019s life expectancy.\n\n\n\nAs she says in the documentary: \u201cWe\u2019re not caring for all older adults \u2014 I mean, less than 10 per cent are using care facilities. So why don\u2019t we hear about the 90 per cent who are out there doing their thing and doing just fine, thank you very much. Why don\u2019t we hear about them?\u201d\n\n\n\nBryanton\u2019s journey to her doctorate, however, is only the most recent instalment of her work on seniors\u2019 issues. Her activism started in the 1980s.\n\n\u2018Anyone can be an activist\u2019\n\nBryanton\u2019s background includes researching and authoring a book on housing for a gerontology association, organizing a seniors\u2019 housing conference, working for a seniors\u2019 federation, founding a newspaper, establishing a seniors\u2019 centre in Charlottetown \u2014 where she served as president for two years \u2014 and helping launch a provincial seniors\u2019 safety program together with the RCMP and P.E.I. government.\n\nIn 2000, she started working at the PEI Centre on Health and Aging, and, in the same year, received an honorary degree from UPEI. Nine years after that, she completed her master of education at the university.\n\n\n\nPeople in the community have quipped that she\u2019s in the newspaper more than the Pope. But Bryanton brushes off the idea that she\u2019s a pioneer herself.\n\n\n\n\u201cI truly believe that anyone can be an activist,\u201d Bryanton says, \u201cand that anyone can further their education.\u201d\n\nChanging attitudes\n\nSome activists have a pivotal moment in which they realize their calling. For Bryanton, it was when she began to notice the antipathy about aging becoming pervasive \u2014 robbing adults of dignity and agency.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was a constant bombardment of negativity that really gets to you,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd you finally say, \u2018OK, I am aging, everybody I know is aging, so why are we letting this [negativity] happen?\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s not just younger generations: Bryanton believes these cultural attitudes seep into older adults\u2019 psyches as well.\n\n\n\nSeniors start to believe they have no value and nothing to contribute, internalizing the ageist attitudes around them. It\u2019s a self-fulfilling prophecy, she says.\n\n\u201cWhen you hear that over and over again, you begin to believe it,\u201d Bryanton says. \u201cI think that really limits people\u2019s creativity; it limits their abilities.\u201d\n\n\n\nOne example she shared with Women Social Activists of Atlantic Canada involved a struggle to fill openings for board members at a seniors\u2019 centre where she worked. Potential candidates said they didn\u2019t feel qualified to take the positions, but Bryanton observed that if they stepped into the role, made decisions and improved the community, they ultimately realized how much they had to offer.\n\n\n\n\u201cOlder adults themselves should be refuting what is told to us by the media and our current culture,\u201d Bryanton says. \u201cThey really need to start believing in what they see in themselves.\u201d\n\nPushing for change\n\nThe activist has a few goals for her life of community work.\n\n\n\n\u201cI would love to see ageism eliminated,\u201d Bryanton says. \u201cI\u2019d like to see in any decision-making \u2014 whether it be research, or development of programs or services \u2014 that older adults always be part of the process. They are the experts in their lives, so why are we not turning to the experts?\u201d\n\n\n\nShe wants attitudes to evolve, older generations to be respected and knowledge to be gleaned from older people\u2019s experiences, particularly with regard to aging healthily and independently. And she wants each individual to realize they are capable of great things \u2014 at any age.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe all have potential,\u201d Bryanton says. \u201cWe just need to foster it a bit.\u201d\n\nWatch Never Too Old.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Nina Dragicevic"], "top_image": ""}
