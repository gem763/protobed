He was named to five All-Star teams as a member of the Rangers, where he was named American League MVP in 2010. The Rangers played in and lost back-to-back World Series in 2010 and 2011 during Hamilton\u2019s tenure.\n\nHamilton struggled with cocaine and alcohol addiction throughout his career. The Tampa Bay Rays selected him first overall in the 1999 MLB draft, but he was banned from baseball from 2004 to 2006 for multiple failed drug tests before his MLB career ever began.\n\nHe reportedly suffered a relapse in 2015 during the offseason while a member of the Los Angeles Angels prior to returning to Texas to play in 50 games with the Rangers that season, which would mark the end of his career.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n", "description": "Josh Hamilton is accused of beating one of his daughters in his home.", "authors": ["Jason Owens"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/FkfMALqQYMX4DF1U2rBgPQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD05NjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3fVUWOExtc7D84obT5r_.w--~B/aD0xMTYyO3c9MTU1MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/73f12fa0-fb5c-11e9-a6d1-722dfc585cd8", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
