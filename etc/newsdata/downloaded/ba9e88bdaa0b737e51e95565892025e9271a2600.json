(AP) - David Glass leaned on the Royals dugout rail, talking earnestly with third-base coach Mike Jirschele and clutching a baseball in his hand. It was mid-afternoon, 88 degrees and humid.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m here because where else would you want to be on a Saturday evening but the ballpark?\u201d Glass said with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m not going to stop enjoying baseball. I went to my first game in 1946 and I\u2019ve been a baseball junkie ever since.\u201d\n\nThe current Kansas City franchise owner was in his element. Ahead was the impending sale of the Royals to a group headed by Kansas City businessman John Sherman, but Glass was savoring a day in the dugout and on the field.\n\nWith the front-running Houston Astros in town, Glass watched as sidelined catcher Salvador Perez tested his surgically repaired right arm by firing throws to coach Pedro Grifol.\n\n\u201cThis is our 20th year with this team and it\u2019s been a lot of fun the whole time,\u201d said Glass, who has barely spoken publicly since word first filtered down that the Royals had been sold. \u201cAnd making the decision to sell the team is one of the most difficult decisions I\u2019ve ever made. But it\u2019s the right thing. There\u2019s a time for everything and it\u2019s the right time.\u201d\n\nThe sale is expected to become final, pending approval by league owners, during the offseason. But for now the season is still on, and the 84-year-old Glass is savoring every moment.\n\n\u201cI love the game, I love Kansas City, I love the Royals and I wish them well,\u201d he said. \u201cThe new owner, John Sherman, will do a great job with this franchise. I think he\u2019ll have this franchise back in the playoffs and ultimately in the World Series, and I\u2019m looking forward to that.\u201d\n\nThe Royals, after enduring many lean years, reached the World Series for the first time under Glass\u2019s care in 2014, losing in seven riveting games to the San Francisco Giants. They bounced back the next year to win another American League pennant and beat the New York Mets in the World Series.\n\nThe championship banner joins one from 1985 as the only ones in franchise history.\n\nSo does Glass have regrets? He could come up with just one.\n\n\u201cThe one thing I think about is we won the World Series in 2015 and when it\u2019s over, there\u2019s so much stress, there\u2019s so many people you need to tend to and things that you need to do,\u201d Glass said. \u201cIf I had it to do over again, I\u2019d slow it down some and enjoy it more. But the next one Kansas City\u2019s in, I\u2019ll slow that one down and enjoy it.\u201d\n\nGlass leaned back on the dugout rail once more, and greeted Grifol and other coaches and players. And an hour later, when the Royals were winding up pregame practice, Glass was still in the heat, on a step attached to the batting cage and engaged in conversation with manager Ned Yost.\n\nHe still had that baseball in his hand.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "David Glass leaned on the Royals dugout rail, talking earnestly with third-base coach Mike Jirschele and clutching a baseball in his hand.
