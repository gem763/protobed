(Image: CBS/Viacom)\n\nAron Eisenberg, the actor repsonsible for bringing the Ferengi Nog to life in Deep Space Nine, has died.\n\nThe news comes from his widow, who shared the information on Facebook on Saturday night. The actor, aged 50, worked in Hollywood during the \u201880s and \u201890s, though he was best known for the role of Nog in Deep Space Nine.\n\nOver seven seasons, viewers got to know Nog, the first Ferengi to join Starfleet, where he eventually reached the rank of Lieutenant Junior Grade. Nog was a fantastic character, and Eisenberg imbued him with a distinct and powerful sense of life.\n\nEisenberg\u2019s cause of death is, at this point, unknown.
