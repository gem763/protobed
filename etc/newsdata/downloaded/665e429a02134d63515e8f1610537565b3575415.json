USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump said Sunday that terrorist leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, perhaps the world's most wanted man, was killed in a special operations raid over the weekend.\n\n\"Last night the United States brought the world's No. 1 terrorist leader to justice,\" Trump said at the White House early Sunday in a televised address to the nation.\n\nAl-Baghdadi led the extremist organization known as the Islamic State, or ISIS. Trump said he died after running from a house into a dead-end tunnel while being chased by U.S. commandos in northwest Syria. Al-Baghdadi detonated a suicide vest that killed him and three of his children, Trump said.\n\n\"He died like a dog,\" Trump said. \"He died like a coward. The world is now a much safer place.\n\n\"He was a sick and depraved man, and now he's gone.\"\n\nAl-Baghdadi is the highest-ranking terrorist to be killed or captured since the death of Osama bin Laden in 2011.\n\nU.S. commandos launched the raid late Saturday, Trump said. News reports said the raid's target was al-Baghdadi, who was located with the assistance of the CIA.\n\nNo U.S. personnel were killed, Trump said.\n\nTrump said the U.S. forces \u201caccomplished their mission in grand style\u201d in a \u201cdangerous and daring nighttime raid.\" The operation lasted about two hours, he said. U.S. forces seized \"highly sensitive information,\" including information about ISIS origins and future plans.\n\nAl-Baghdadi\u2019s body was \u201cmutilated by the blast,\u201d and the tunnel had caved in because of the explosion, Trump said. Rubble had to be removed to get to the body, and an on-site DNA test was done.\n\nThe test results \"gave certain, immediate and totally positive identification,\" Trump said. \"It was him.\"\n\nEleven children were removed from the house, according to the president, but it was unclear to whom they belonged. He said some fighters at the scene were taken and imprisoned.\n\nSOURCE maps4news.com/\u00a9HERE (Photo: USA TODAY)\n\nAl-Baghdadi spent his \u201clast moments in utter fear, in total panic and dread, terrified of the American forces bearing down on him,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump said he and Vice President Mike Pence watched much of the mission from the White House Situation Room. Al-Baghdadi spent his final moments \u201cwhimpering and crying and screaming all the way,\" he said.\n\nTrump did not confirm how many people were killed in the mission, but the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights had reported at least eight deaths.\n\nTwo women whom Trump described as wives of al-Baghdadi were found wearing vests that had not been detonated. Both women were killed in the operation.\n\nThe announcement came three weeks after Trump announced the withdrawal of U.S. troops from northern Syria, which allowed Turkish forces to sweep into the area and attack Kurdish rivals. The decision drew bipartisan criticism that Trump had abandoned a former ally that had fought ISIS alongside U.S. forces.\n\nFILE - This file image made from video posted on a militant website Saturday, July 5, 2014, purports to show the leader of the Islamic State group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

Russian forces also moved into the region as a fragile cease-fire along the Turkey-Syria border took hold.\n\nBoth the Kurds and the Turks said they provided assistance to the U.S. raid.\n\nMazloum Abdi, commanding general of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, said on the organization's official Twitter account: \"Successful & historical operation due to a joint intelligence work with the United States of America.\"\n\nIn another tweet, the Turkey Ministry of National Defense said: \"Prior to the US Operation in Idlib Province of Syria last night, information exchange and coordination between the military authorities of both countries took place,\"\n\nTrump signaled the news Saturday night with an enigmatic tweet saying that \"something very big has just happened!\" Trump said he sent the tweet right after U.S. forces landed in the area.\n\nAbout 90 minutes later, the White House announced Trump would make \"a major statement\" from the White House on Sunday morning.\n\nOfficials also said Defense Secretary Mark Esper would appear on Sunday morning new programs to discuss developments in Syria.\n\nAs the leader of a self-proclaimed caliphate, the charismatic and vicious al-Baghdadi urged followers to carry out attacks against the United States and other Western countries.\n\nSyrian government forces reinforcements arrive near the city of Ras al-Ayn, in the north of Syria, Saturday, Oct. 26, 2019.

Islamic State adherents included the woman and her husband who killed 14 people at a 2015 holiday party in San Bernardino, Calif.\n\nThere have been many reports of al-Baghdadi's death that did not pan out, and the U.S. put a $25 million bounty on his head.\n\nAl-Baghdadi appeared in an ISIS video in late April, his first public appearance in nearly five years, praising Easter Sunday attacks in Sri Lanka against Catholic churches and high-end hotels that killed more than 250 people, including at least four Americans.\n\nTrump critics took issue with the television-drama-like rollout of the news.\n\n\"So Trump has to Trump even the apparent killing of al-Baghdadi,\" tweeted Robert E. Kelly, professor of political science at Pusan National University in South Korea. \"He had to leak on Twitter to create hype & suspense and grab the news cycle. He can never rise to the moment. Maybe the announcement will finally display some gravitas, not gloating, but who really expects that now?\"\n\nDiane Foley, whose son James was one of the American captives murdered on camera by members of the group, said she was thankful to the president and U.S. troops.\n\n\u201cI am grateful to our President and brave troops for finding ISIS leader Al-Baghdadi,\" she said in a statement on behalf of her son's namesake foundation. \"I hope this will hinder the resurgence of terror groups and pray that captured ISIS fighters will be brought to trial and held accountable.\"\n\nShe said she remains concerned about \"the dozen Americans held hostage in Syria, including Austin Tice and Majd Kamalmaz. And I ask President Trump to make them, and all American hostages, a priority.\u201d\n\nContributing: John Fritze; the Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/27/donald-trump-isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-dead/2477808001/", "description": "Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi forged the extremist group known as ISIS; President Donald Trump cast his death as a major step toward elimination of ISIS.", "authors": ["David Jackson", "Courtney Subramanian", "Michael Collins", "Published A.M.
