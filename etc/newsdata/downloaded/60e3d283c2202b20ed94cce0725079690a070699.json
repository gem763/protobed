Overcrowded and 'fake fancy' bars and restaurants selling bad food to slightly (or very) intoxicated patrons. Not a vibe. Perhaps I'm generalising to some extent, however I've never been compelled to swap out Kloof Street for Victoria Road. Until now, that is.\n\nWATCH: Camps Bay to Cape Town on electric skateboard\n\nI'll go to the Surfshack again and again. It's a new contemporary seaside diner right on the beachfront. Ocean views, sunsets, seafood, and elegant decor that allows for families and those with sandy feet to feel more than comfortable and welcome.\n\nSlick, scandi minimalism defines this space. It's luxe, but not stiff. Service is great, the cocktail menu is extensive and the unisex bathroom is also a cool touch.\n\n(Surfshack interior and pizza over. PHOTO: Marisa Crous)\n\n(Wooden bar.

From the rice crispy prawns (the perfect crunch), to the Ahi tuna and bucket of prawns. Order shareables (like tapas) for the table when you're in the mood for a light afternoon indulgence along with some of the Kove Collection wines. Or go big and bold with mains, or try the wood-fire oven pizzas.\n\n(Rice crispy prawns. PHOTO: Marisa Crous)\n\n(A small bucket of Cajun prawns with 'The roof is on fire butter'. PHOTO: Marisa Crous)\n\nVegetarians will love:\n\nThe crispy curly corn on the cob is a playful dish meant to be eaten as you would ribs. Salty, zesty, cheesy heavenly bites! I will go back just for this alone...\n\nEveryone will love:\n\nThe desserts are just as playful as the rest of the menu. The Birthday Cake, Campfire and Marshmallow and Frozen Mousse with caramelised cornflakes are all excellent palette pleasers worth ending your meal with.\n\n(All the desserts.
