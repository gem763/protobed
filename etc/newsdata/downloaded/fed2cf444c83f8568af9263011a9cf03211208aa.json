Bulgarian Football Union has made an official complaint to UEFA about 'offensive' and 'unjust' comments made by England players regarding the country's perceived problems of racism ahead of next Monday's European Championship qualifier in Sofia.\n\nIn an explosive letter from former Bulgaria international goalkeeper Borislav Mihaylov to UEFA General Secretary Theodore Theodoridis, the BFU warn that what they describe as the FA's fixation with racism in Bulgaria could increase tension ahead of next week's group A clash, as well referencing the racist incidents that have marred Premier League matches in recent seasons and England's hooligan history.\n\nMihaylov was responding to comments from several England players in recent days, particularly those of Chelsea striker Tammy Abraham, who said they would be prepared to walk off the pitch if they suffer racist abuse in either of this week's qualifiers in Czech Republic and Bulgaria.\n\nBorislav Mihaylov, the president of the Bulgarian Football Union, has complained to UEFA about 'offensive' and 'unjust' comments made by England players regarding the country's perceived problems of racism\n\nMihaylov sent the letter to Theodore Theodoridis, the UEFA general secretary\n\nTammy Abraham said England are prepared to walk off the pitch if players are racially abused\n\nThe Bulgaria fixture in particular has been highlighted as a cause for concern after a number of England's black players were subjected to monkey chanting during an away game in Montenegro last March, as UEFA ordered a partial closure of the Vasil Levski stadium following racist behaviour by fans during Euro 2020 qualifiers against the Czech Republic and Kosovo in June.\n\nIn addition, Bulgarian club sides PFC Levski Sofia and PFC Lokomotiv Plovdiv were punished by Uefa for racism during Europa League games in August.\n\nUEFA are concerned enough to have assigned three undercover observers to Monday's game in Sofia charged with spotting any racist incidents, but in his letter to UEFA Mihaylov claims such fears are an unjust slur.\n\nDefender Trent Alexander-Arnold agreed that walking off the pitch is an option\n\nTyrone Mings says that it is disappointing to have to deal with racism in football in 2019\n\nIn an angry letter full of denials Mihaylov does not address the fact that 5000 seats in the 46,000 capacity stadium will be empty on Monday after UEFA upheld racism charges against a section of fans last June.\n\n'The Bulgarian Football Union, the Bulgarian general public and I personally find offensive due to unjust branding of the local spectators as people inclined to discriminatory behaviour,' Mihaylov writes.\n\n'We at the Bulgarian Football Union feel that this fixation on potential incidents during the game in Sofia does not to justice to the Bulgarian supporters, the general public and to the extreme efforts and measures that the Bulgarian Football Union has taken in order to ensure a fair and safe environment for what we believe to be a true footballing spectacle.\n\n5000 seats in the 46,000 capacity stadium will be empty on Monday after UEFA upheld racism charges against a section of fans last June\n\nEngland players were subjected to racial abuse when they faced Montenegro away in March\n\n'Although we are aware of the recent problems with racist behaviour in all tiers of English club football and with England's ongoing battle with hooliganism and although we sincerely applaud the FA's initiative for the English fans to report trouble within the visiting crowd we are extremely shocked at all efforts to involve and even mark out the Bulgarian spectators as potential troublemakers.\n\nRECENT RACISM PROBLEMS IN FOOTBALL Crystal Palace's Wilfried Zaha sent racist abuse on social media Aston Villa condemn fans for racist chants regarding a song about Marvelous Nakamba and John McGinn Three Brighton fans arrested in relation to two separate incidents at their stadium Leeds goalkeeper Kiko Casilla accused of racially abusing Charlton's Jonathan Leko during a match Bernardo Silva charged with misconduct by the FA over a tweet sent to Manchester City team-mate Benjamin Mendy Former Newcastle Under-23s coach Peter Beardsley suspended from all football-related activity for 32 weeks for making racist comments to players\n\n'The Bulgarian Football Union's energy in battling racism in the last decade has proven to be effective as there has not been a single recent incident during a national team game involving hatred or discrimination due to skin color, race, religion or political views.\n\n'I find myself obliged to voice my concerns over the fact that the Bulgarian fans are being made subject of public reprimand and scrutiny and demand for this demeanour to be ceased as not to cause any unnecessary tension prior to the game on October 14th.'\n\nMihaylov is also understood to have sent press cuttings from the English media to UEFA, and urged European football's governing body to issue disciplinary charges against the FA if any players leave the pitch without following the three-step protocol.\n\nIf racist abuse is heard by the referee or reported by a player, then he will request a public announcement over the tannoy system demanding it stop. If this fails, then a suspension of play will follow, with both sets of players led off the pitch and a further warning played over the tannoy. If the chants continue, the match can then be abandoned.\n\n'Please find attached references to articles in worldwide media platforms in which various players from the England national team openly discuss the possibilities of breaking the UEFA three-step procedure, and all UEFA protocols and walking off the pitch in the case of discriminatory behaviour in the team's upcoming European qualifiers against the Czech Republic and particularly against Bulgaria,' he writes.\n\n'This idea, if executed, should be punishable according to the UEFA Disciplinary Regulations.\n\n'I, as president of the Bulgarian Football Union, cannot allow for such derogatory claims to continue being spread in the mass media and I strongly suggest that the UEFA administration take measures against the build-up of unnecessary tension in the weeks devoted to equality and to the celebration of football.'", "description": "MATT HUGHES: The president of the Bulgarian Football Union has complained to UEFA about comments made by England players regarding the country's perceived problems of racism.", "authors": ["Matt Hughes For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/15/19543264-0-image-a-51_1570717179601.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
