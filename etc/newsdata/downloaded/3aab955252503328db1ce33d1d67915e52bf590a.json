There are tons of brands out there that were created to take the headache and wallet-crushing expenses out of purchasing large furniture on the internet. Sectionals give you the opportunity to stretch your legs, but also offer the space to entertain without feeling like you\u2019re squished together, elbowing each other to get some chips and dip. We\u2019ve rounded up some of the best online-only sofa purchases that you can make with the peace of mind that you\u2019re getting both high quality and style.\n\nThe Sofa, $1,890 at Floyd: The Sofa from Floyd comes in four colors and the option to change up the base between birch or upholstered.
