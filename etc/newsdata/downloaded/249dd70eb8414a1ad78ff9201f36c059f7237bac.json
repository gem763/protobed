It is the daughter of racism. And so from a world that rewards lighter skin over darker skin, this then becomes a prejudice among people of the same race.\n\n'So it's the preferential treatment of people with lighter skin and is very, very much linked to racism.'\n\nShe said: 'I definitely grew up feeling uncomfortable with my skin colour because I felt like the world around me awarded lighter skin' (pictured in 2018's Black Panther)\n\nShe continued: 'Skin colour and race don't necessarily go hand-in-hand. So, for me, as much as I was experiencing colourism in Kenya, I wasn't aware that I belonged to a race called black.\n\n'Which I know is a complex idea because the relationship to my skin was separate from the relationship to my race.'\n\n'Race is a very, very social construct, one that I didn't have to ascribe to on a daily basis growing up regardless of the fact that I was very much a victim of colourism.\n\n'So I think this is the thing about the relationship between race and colourism is that they're related but one of them moved farther away from the other and sometimes we forget how they are related.'\n\nDiscussing whether Black Panther had changing the casting experience for black actors, she said: 'I think time will tell whether this has been that pivotal shift. It definitely feels that way.'\n\nThe Mexican-born actress is busier than ever these days with her first book, a children's story titled Sulwe out in October and three films out in 2019, including the forthcoming Star Wars flick.\n\nShe's also filming thriller 355 with Jessica Chastain and is set to star in The Killer, a remake if John Woo's 1989 classic.\n\nAnd, writer and director Ryan Coogler recently revealed the next installment of the Black Panther franchise will be released on May 6, 2022.\n\nLupita plays charming and enigmatic teacher Miss Caroline in the rom-zom-com, Little Monsters which hit limited US theaters on Tuesday for one night only before streaming this Friday on Hulu/Neon.\n\nShe shot to worldwide fame when she won an Academy Award for 12 Years A Slave in 2014.", "description": "Lupita Nyong'o has revealed she was once told she was 'too dark' to be on television.", "authors": ["Eve Buckland For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/17/19548472-0-image-a-86_1570724073448.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
