As Lorenzo Reyes details, the league's elite class is starting to crystalize. USA TODAY\n\nThe NFL's annual trade deadline will pass Tuesday afternoon, and a few prominent names are bound to be headed for new homes.\n\nIt's a reminder that the league's players are constantly on the move, if not always via trades. But frequent roster churn tends to quickly dim memories of established players who made pit stops in unfamiliar cities \u2014 heck, recently dealt lineman Michael Bennett, who entered the NFL as a Buccaneer, is about to join his fourth club (Seahawks, Eagles, Patriots, Cowboys) in less than three full seasons.\n\nSo that got me thinking about current and past stars who have had forgettable stints in uniforms you might not recall. We're not going to insult your intelligence with luminaries who have recently bounced (Odell Beckham, Antonio Brown, Jadeveon Clowney) or those who shone for multiple franchises, say Peyton Manning or Adam Vinatieri. And don't want to bore you Millennials by going to deep into the vault for Y.A. Tittle or Night Train Lane.\n\nBut in the spirit of the NFL's 100th season, here's a list (certainly not exhaustive) of 100 guys who might have played in places you have no memory of \u2014 the objective being I want you to say, \"I totally forgot he played there\" or, even better, \"I never realized he played there.\"\n\n(Note: Guys whose rights were traded \u2014 Eli Manning and Philip Rivers, for example \u2014 but didn't play in some capacity for multiple teams were not considered.)\n\nOn to the list, which is organized alphabetically ...\n\n1. RB Shaun Alexander: The record-setting 2005 MVP in Seattle, he rushed for 24 yards in his final four games for Washington in 2008.\n\n2. DE Jared Allen: The colorful quarterback roper for the Chiefs and Vikings split his final two seasons with the Bears and Panthers.\n\n3. G Larry Allen: A legendary strongman in Dallas, he finished out his career with arch rival San Francisco in 2006 and 2007.\n\n4. K Morten Andersen: One of two pure kickers in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, he retired as the league's all-time leading scorer, topping the career charts for both the Saints and Falcons, too. However Andersen was a nomad from 2001 through 2004, suiting up for the Giants, Chiefs and Vikings.\n\n5. S Steve Atwater: The popular Bronco played his final season for the Jets, one of many greats on this list who limped to the finish line with Gang Green.\n\n6. CB Champ Bailey: Another Broncos great, you'll likely recall he began his career with Washington in 1999 before being traded \u2014 with a second-round pick! \u2014 for Clinton Portis in 2004. But do you remember Bailey spending the 2014 preseason with the Saints before retiring?\n\n7. TE Mark Bavaro: One of the most dominant dual-threat tight ends ever, Bavaro played briefly for the Browns and Eagles after leaving the Giants.\n\n8. RB Jerome Bettis: He may seem like a prototypical Steeler, but he won 1993 offensive rookie of the year honors with the Los Angeles Rams and spent 1995 on the Busch Stadium turf for the St. Louis Rams.\n\n9. QB Drew Bledsoe: You know he was replaced by Tom Brady in New England and was subsequently dealt to Buffalo. Bledsoe later got Wally Pipp'd by Tony Romo in Dallas.\n\n10. WR Anquan Boldin: After seven years with Arizona, he remained a highly productive player for the Ravens and 49ers. He played his last year for the Lions in 2016 but did don a Bills uniform in the summer of 2017 before retiring.\n\nGREATEST PLAYERS OF ALL TIME: Who tops our list of the 100 best?\n\nNFL's 100 WORST TEAMS: Who were most hopeless squads in history?\n\n11. WR Tim Brown: The longtime Raiders star played his 17th and final season in Tampa.\n\n12. WR Isaac Bruce: After shining with the Rams for 14 seasons, he concluded his career in San Francisco.\n\n13. QB Mark Brunell: Jacksonville's all-time leading passer also started in Washington for three seasons. He spent the balance of his career backing up Brett Favre in Green Bay, Drew Brees in New Orleans and Mark Sanchez in New York.\n\n14. WR Dez Bryant: Had you already forgotten about that ill-fated practice in New Orleans when he tore his Achilles before he could play a game for the Saints in 2018?\n\n15. RB Reggie Bush: If you were asked how many teams he played for, would you have answered five? He was featured in New Orleans, Miami and Detroit. Not San Francisco, and certainly not Buffalo, where he \"rushed\" for minus-3 yards in his final season.\n\n16. RB Earl Campbell: Probably the greatest Houston Oiler, he spent his final 1\u00bd seasons in New Orleans.\n\n17. WR Cris Carter: Minnesota's all-time leading receiver entered the NFL with the Eagles and left as a Dolphin.\n\n18. TE Dave Casper: The Hall of Fame \"Ghost\" is closely associated with the Raiders, for whom he began and ended his 11-year career. But he played 48 combined games for the Oilers and Vikings before finishing up with the L.A. Raiders in 1984.\n\n19. RB Jamaal Charles: You likely remember the Chiefs' all-time leading rusher taking a one-year detour to Denver. But what about his two-game cup of coffee in Jacksonville?\n\n20. TE Dallas Clark: One of Peyton Manning's trusted targets was also a Buccaneer and Raven. Seriously.\n\n21. RB Larry Csonka: Did you know it was Csonka, then with the Giants, who was involved in the ill-fated handoff that led to Philadelphia's miraculous \"Miracle at the Meadowlands\" victory in 1978?\n\n22. QB Randall Cunningham: You knew he starred for the Eagles and resurrected himself in Minnesota. But do you remember him wrapping his career as a backup for the Cowboys and Ravens?\n\n23. QB Len Dawson: Before becoming a champion and Super Bowl MVP for the Dallas Texans/Kansas City Chiefs, he muddled through the early part of his career with the Steelers and Browns.\n\n24. RB Eric Dickerson: His 1987 trade from the Rams to the Colts was one of the more stunning in league history. His stops with the Raiders and Falcons and a failed physical in Green Bay to end his career are largely forgotten.\n\n25. TE Mike Ditka: He's synonymous with the Bears as a player and coach. But he also played for the Eagles and won a Super Bowl as a member of the Cowboys.\n\n26. RB Tony Dorsett: The longtime Dallas star concluded his 12-year career in Denver.\n\n27. QB Boomer Esiason: The biggest passing game of his career (522 yards) occurred when he was a Cardinal.\n\n28. G Alan Faneca: Arguably one of the two best guards to play in the last 15 years (keep reading to learn the other), he played for the Jets and Cardinals after spending a decade in Pittsburgh.\n\n29. RB Marshall Faulk: The centerpiece of \"The Greatest Show on Turf\" Rams was drafted by the Colts in 1994 before being traded.\n\n30. QB Brett Favre: Prior to becoming King in the North, he partied a little too much for the Dirty South Falcons, who drafted him in 1991. And prior to becoming the Hand of the King (Aaron Rodgers?) while in Minnesota, Favre tried to play through a bit too much pain for the Jets in 2008.\n\nNFL's 100 GREATEST TEAMS OF ALL TIME: Which squad is best in league history?\n\n31. QB Nick Foles: He's now with the Jaguars ... remember? He used to start for the St. Louis Rams ... remember? He used to back up Alex Smith in Kansas City ... remember?\n\n32. DE Dwight Freeney: He didn't finish his illustrious career with the Colts \u2014 right, right. But he played for the Chargers, Cardinals, Falcons, Seahawks and Lions? Whoa.\n\n33. RB Eddie George: Oiler? Oh yeah. Titan? Of course. Cowboy? Huh?\n\n34. OLB Kevin Greene: No linebacker tops his 160 career sacks. Maybe you associated the bulk of his production with the L.A. Rams or Steelers ... though he played as many seasons as Carolina (three) as he did in Pittsburgh, plus another in San Francisco.\n\n35. RB Franco Harris: His bid to break Jim Brown's career rushing record (at the time) came up just short in Seattle in 1984.\n\n36. OLB James Harrison: Stop reading, Steelers fans ... OK, Harrison also spent time with the Ravens and Bengals before wrapping his career with the hated Patriots. Welp, at least he didn't join the Browns, too.\n\n37. QB Matt Hasselbeck: The first man to quarterback the Seahawks to a Super Bowl started his career as Favre's backup, ended it as Andrew Luck's and started 21 games for the Titans while mentoring Jake Locker.\n\n38. KR Devin Hester: The return man extraordinaire should go into the Hall after accruing his record 20 non-offensive TDs, one coming with Atlanta. Hester also spent the 2016 regular season in Baltimore. But only diehards will recall his final two games in the 2016 playoffs ... with Seattle.\n\n39. RB Priest Holmes:The fantasy stud to have from 2001 to 2003 during his time with the Chiefs, he spent the first four years of his career as an undrafted free agent with the Ravens.\n\n40. WR Torry Holt: Almost to a man, those great St. Louis Rams players faded into virtual anonymity. Holt's last catch came as a Jaguar. He tried to latch on with the Patriots but didn't make it out of training camp.\n\n41. G Steve Hutchinson: The league's best guard post-Larry Allen in my judgment \u2014 Let's get him into the Hall next year, please \u2014 Mr. \"Poison Pill\" starred in Seattle and Minnesota before hanging up his spurs with Tennessee.\n\n42. RB Steven Jackson: Talk about poor timing. He missed the heyday of The Greatest Show on Turf, was stuck on two bad Atlanta teams and finished up with the Patriots \u2014 yes \u2014 during a year (2015) they failed to reach the Super Bowl.\n\n43. RB Edgerrin James: If you thought his final game occurred in a Cardinals uniform, you'd be wrong. It came in Seattle's threads.\n\n44. QB Ron Jaworski: If you know your NFL history, then you know the first man to lead the Eagles to a Super Bowl was drafted by the Rams in 1973. If you're really good, then you know \"Jaws\" was a backup in Miami and Kansas City during his final two seasons.\n\n45. WR Andre Johnson: The greatest Houston Texan prior to the arrival of J.J. Watt, Johnson wound down his career by touring with other AFC South teams (Colts, Titans).\n\n46. WR Chad Johnson: Ochocinco made his bones \u2014 and was a must-watch performer thanks to his frequent celebrations \u2014 in Cincinnati. But he reached the Super Bowl during a quiet 2011 season with the Patriots before his career came to an unfortunate end before he played a regular-season game for the Dolphins.\n\n47. WR Keyshawn Johnson: A No. 1 overall draft pick of the Jets and Super Bowl champ with the Bucs, his final seasons were with the Cowboys and Panthers.\n\n48. DE Deacon Jones: The man who coined the term \"sack\" was a relentless force for the Rams. But his career quietly ended amid stints in San Diego, where he was a teammate of fellow over-the-hiller Johnny Unitas, and Washington.\n\n49. CB Ty Law: He just entered the Hall of Fame, deservedly recognized for his role at the roots of the Patriots dynasty. But Law's final years were spent as a mercenary for the Jets (twice), Chiefs and Broncos.\n\n50. DB Ronnie Lott: Perhaps the greatest safety ever, his final four seasons were split between the Raiders and Jets. He even signed with the Chiefs but never played for them.\n\n51. TE John Mackey: He and Ditka revolutionized their position. Mackey spent most of his 10-year career trucking through defenses for the Baltimore Colts before his final year with the Chargers.\n\n52. QB Archie Manning: Peyton's and Eli's dad was the first great player in Saints history, though was never surrounded by much talent. His final three seasons were divided between New Orleans, Houston and Minnesota.\n\n53. WR Brandon Marshall: You know he was a vagabond, but can you name all seven teams that issued him paychecks? Stumped? ... Broncos, Dolphins, Bears, Jets, Giants, Seahawks and Saints, though he never played in a game for New Orleans.\n\n54. G Randall McDaniel: He was a Pro Bowler 11 times for the Vikings ... and once for the Buccaneers.\n\n55. QB Donovan McNabb: Bit of a shock when the Eagles traded him to the Redskins. His abbreviated hitch with the Vikings is hazier ... probably because he lost his job to Christian Ponder.\n\n56. WR Art Monk: He set several league receiving records during his 14 years with the Redskins, though their fans shudder to think that Monk wound up wearing jerseys for the Jets and hated Eagles.\n\n57. QB Joe Montana: You doubtless knew he finished with the Chiefs, but didn't want to exclude him from the list for those born after 1994.\n\n58. QB Warren Moon: He spent most of his illustrious career lofting those beautiful spirals for the Oilers. He was also a Pro Bowler for the Vikings and Seahawks before carrying a clipboard in Kansas City. (And just imagine his numbers had he not had to prove himself for six years with the Canadian Football League's Edmonton Eskimos.)\n\nRandy Moss played just eight games for the Titans in 2010, catching six passes for 80 yards. (Photo: Alan Diaz, AP)\n\n59. WR Randy Moss: \"The Freak\" immediately vaulted to superstardom with the Vikings. You might only know he \"played\" for the Raiders because Oakland traded him to New England. After that? Moss actually went back to the Vikings, then joined the Titans and nearly won that elusive Super Bowl ring during his final season in San Francisco.\n\n60. QB Joe Namath: Broadway Joe hung it up on the Sunset Strip after an anticlimactic season with the Rams.\n\n61. WR Terrell Owens: Let's play the Brandon Marshall Game. Ready? Go \u2014 49ers, Eagles, Cowboys, Bills and Bengals. Shoulda been a Raven, too. T.O. also joined the Allen Wranglers, an indoor team, nearly played for the Seahawks and almost went the CFL route.\n\n62. LT Orlando Pace: Another jettisoned Rams star. Pace's last season occurred in Chicago.\n\n63. DT Alan Page: The only defensive lineman to earn league MVP honors, Page was the most dangerous of those Purple People Eaters. But like Pace, Page's curtain came down in the Windy City.\n\n64. QB Carson Palmer: Among the best passers in the checkered histories of the Bengals and Cardinals. The same does not apply to the Raiders.\n\n65. DE/OLB Julius Peppers: Does it seem like he's only been retired a few months? Did it seem like he played 17 years, his Carolina sandwich filled with sacks from Chicago and Green Bay?\n\n66. RB Adrian Peterson: Nice to see his old Vikings fans shower the current Redskins back with applause last week. In the interim did you erase memories of AD strapping it up for the Saints and Cardinals?\n\n67. DT John Randle: Yet another longtime Viking, he actually played three years with Seattle before retiring.\n\n68. FS Ed Reed: It still boggles the mind that his final season in 2013 was divided between the Texans and Jets.\n\n69. CB Darrelle Revis: He wasn't a Jets teammate of Reed's in 2013, because Revis was with the Buccaneers. The next year he won a ring in New England (man, time flies). After two more years with the Jets, you're forgiven if you don't recollect Revis' abbreviated tenure with the 2017 Chiefs.\n\n70. WR Jerry Rice: The original GOAT, we still can't quite believe Rice crossed the Bay from San Francisco to Oakland in 2001. Wait, the Seahawks also let him wear Steve Largent's No. 80 for 11 games? Wait, he almost played for the Broncos in 2005 before retiring rather than accept a limited role? Crazy stuff.\n\n71. S Bob Sanders: Man, the 2007 defensive player of the year was a force when he was healthy ... which was all too rare. His final two games were spent in a Chargers uniform.\n\n72. CB Deion Sanders: Still can't believe he came out of retirement to wear No. 37 for the Ravens. Cowboys fans have probably also erased Prime Time's year in Washington from the memory banks.\n\n73. C Jeff Saturday: His NFL life began with the Ravens in 1998, though he didn't even play a preseason game for them, and ended with Saturday snapping to Aaron Rodgers. You know about the rest.\n\n74. RB O.J. Simpson: 49ers faithful probably still cringe at the thought of surrendering five high draft picks, including a first rounder, for the Juice's forgettable final two seasons.\n\n75. DE Bruce Smith: His record 200th sack came with Washington.\n\n76. RB Emmitt Smith: The last of his record 18,355 rushing yards came with Arizona.\n\n77. QB Kenny Stabler: The Snake slithered out of Oakland after a decade of Hall of Fame service but hung on for five more years in Houston and New Orleans.\n\n78. CB Aqib Talib: Does it seem like the Rams are his fourth team? Do you have any memory of him as a Buccaneer?\n\n79. QB Fran Tarkenton: The NFL's most prolific passer pre-Marino, Tarkenton's reign in Minnesota was interrupted by a five-year interlude with the Giants.\n\n80. RB Fred Taylor: Jacksonville's all-time leading rusher picked up another 424 yards on the ground for New England between 2009 and 2010.\n\n81. DE/OLB Jason Taylor: Spent a year with the Redskins, then went back to Miami. Spent a year with the Jets \u2014 reaching a championship game for the only time \u2014 then went back to Miami.\n\n82. QB Tim Tebow: He worked miracles for the Broncos in 2011 ... then barely worked at all for the Jets. But had you mentally deleted his breathlessly covered tryouts with the Patriots (2013) and Eagles (2015) before he became a Mets farmhand?\n\n83. RB Thurman Thomas: Buffalo's one-time league MVP spent his 13th and final season in Miami.\n\n84. LB Zach Thomas: A little odd this five-time all-pro hasn't gotten more Hall of Fame consideration. He played one year for the Cowboys after a dozen for the Dolphins.\n\n85. RB LaDainian Tomlinson: In case anyone forgot he played for both the Chargers and Jets (especially the Jets), LT tattooed his calves with the teams' logos.\n\n86. DE Justin Tuck: After achieving glory with the Giants, he finished quietly with the Raiders.\n\n87. DE Osi Umenyiora: After achieving glory with the Giants, he finished quietly with the Falcons.\n\n88. QB Johnny Unitas: He was drafted by the Steelers but never got a chance to play for them. He joined the Chargers for his final season and barely got a chance to play for them. In between those gigs, pretty good.\n\n89. QB Michael Vick: Indelible memories of his highlights for the Falcons and his second chance with the Eagles. But none from his time with the Jets and Steelers.\n\n90. RB Herschel Walker: His 1989 trade from the Cowboys to the Vikings was a pivotal moment in NFL history. His times with the Eagles and Giants, not to mention his Dallas return, were not.\n\n91. QB Kurt Warner: He lifted the Rams and Cardinals to heights rarely seen by those franchises. He also spent a year in New York tutoring Eli Manning.\n\n92. WR Reggie Wayne: He decided to join the Patriots in the 2015 preseason ... and decided two weeks later that he was fine not playing for them.\n\n93. C Mike Webster: Very few of Pittsburgh's \"Steel Curtain\" era royalty moved on to new NFL homes. But Webster was an exception, winding up in Kansas City for his final two seasons.\n\n94. WR Wes Welker: Did you know the undrafted free agent originally signed with the Chargers? Or that he spent three seasons in Miami? Or that following his years of ridiculous productivity with Brady and Peyton Manning, he played one final year in St. Louis?\n\n95. DE Reggie White: Admit it, you forgot he unretired in 2000 to play a season for the Panthers ... and finished with a career-low 5\u00bd sacks.\n\n96. DT Vince Wilfork: Didn't get to finish up in New England, but he did so in Houston.\n\n97. DE Mario Williams: The No. 1 pick of the 2006 draft by the Texans, Williams' final five years were passed in the AFC East with Buffalo and Miami.\n\n98. RB Ricky Williams: While I mostly wanted to drop a Toronto Argonauts reference, don't forget he played for the Ravens in 2011.\n\n99. DB Rod Woodson: He's best known for his stellar decade in Pittsburgh and, secondarily, being a pillar of the famed 2000 Ravens defense. But Woodson also played in the Bay Area for both the 49ers and Raiders.\n\n100. QB Steve Young: Before becoming a two-time league MVP for the Niners, he suffered two brutal seasons in Tampa Bay (his time with the Bucs following his professional debut with the USFL's L.A. Express).\n\n***\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
