Action Images via Reuters/Matthew Childs\n\nSpurs were looking to bounce back from a shock 1-0 home loss to Newcastle United and went ahead through Christian Eriksen and a Harry Kane penalty before Lacazette struck before the break and Aubameyang got a 71st minute equaliser.\n\nArsenal, who were beaten 3-1 at Liverpool last week, are in fifth place with seven points while Spurs are ninth on five after four games.\n\nThe visitors took a 10th minute lead when Eriksen knocked the ball into an empty net on the rebound, capitalising on some sloppy goalkeeping from Arsenal\u2019s Bernd Leno, who could only parry Erik Lamela\u2019s weak shot into the path of the Dane.\n\nArsenal had most of the ball on a sun-soaked afternoon at the Emirates Stadium but Tottenham were far more threatening on the break and Leno was forced to keep out stinging efforts from Kane and Eriksen in the first half.\n\n\u201cWe played with our heart sometimes more than our head, we needed more balance, we needed to have clearer heads,\u201d said Arsenal coach Unai Emery of his side\u2019s first-half mistakes.\n\nTottenham were then awarded a penalty for a clumsy foul by Granit Xhaka on the lively Son Heung-min and Kane converted in the 40th minute to put Spurs on track for a first league win on enemy territory in nine years.\n\nHowever, Arsenal\u2019s France striker Lacazette halved the deficit right before halftime with an emphatic strike after controlling an exquisite pass from the club\u2019s record signing Nicolas Pepe.\n\nKane came close to sealing the points for Tottenham when he struck the post but Arsenal became galvanised when Spanish midfielder Dani Ceballos came off the bench and hit a shot which keeper Hugo Lloris did well to tip over.\n\nAn equaliser looked ever likelier and duly arrived when Gabon striker Aubameyang prodded a lofted pass from Matteo Guendouzi into the net in the 71st minute, scoring a third goal in four Premier League games this season.\n\nAMAZING MATCH\n\n\u201cIt was an amazing match. We are proud of our work and our supporters,\u201d added Emery.\n\n\u201cThe key was the first goal to give us confidence and give us more chances in the second half. We deserved it.\u201d\n\nTottenham coach Mauricio Pochettino also felt Lacazette\u2019s timely goal was pivotal.\n\n\u201cConceding with the last action of the first half gave relief to Arsenal and was an emotional hit to us, we were very down, before our emotions were very high and football is all about emotion,\u201d he said.\n\nArsenal\u2019s Sokratis Papastathopoulos later had a goal ruled out for offside while Tottenham\u2019s Moussa Sissoko spurned a last-gasp chance in a thrilling finale by blasting over the bar after Kane was denied a penalty when he tangled with Sokratis.\n\nTottenham striker Kane said his side were disappointed to have let their lead slip.\n\n\u201cI feel like we\u2019re coming off disappointed, we expected to see the game out,\u201d he told reporters.\n\n\u201cThe (Lacazette) goal hurt us with momentum just before the break. It was an end-to-end game, especially the last 10-15 minutes, but the players left everything on the pitch.\u201d\n\nThe England international also felt he should have been awarded a second penalty.\n\n\u201cAs a striker, if it is on halfway (line) it is a definite foul. In the box you don\u2019t always get them,\u201d he added.\n\nAubameyang, meanwhile, said Arsenal should have come away with more than a point.\n\n\u201cI think in the first half we deserved to score two goals,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a tough game and I think we deserved more.\u201d", "description": "Arsenal strikers Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette inspired a stirring comeback against rivals Tottenham Hotspur to salvage a 2-2 draw in a thrilling north London Premier League derby on Sunday.", "authors": ["Richard Martin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425319686&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF810JI-OZASP"}
