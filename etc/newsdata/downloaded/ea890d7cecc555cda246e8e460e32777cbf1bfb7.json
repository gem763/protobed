The IMF has cut its forecast pickup for the Australian economy - by 0.4 per cent to 1.7 per cent in 2019, and by 0.5 per cent to 2.3 per cent in 2020. The economy is soft, and growth is subpar. But this is no crisis requiring emergency measures. The Prime Minister is right not to be spooked into blowing the budget surplus on reckless stimulus, as Labor demands. But, as The Australian Financial Review has argued, the Morrison government must seize the political opportunity to spark the economy out of the doldrums. Rather than fiddle with the cyclical dials of monetary or fiscal policy, it must start doing the heavy lifting on the structural reforms to spur business investment, consumer spending, jobs and productivity growth. A lower income tax burden, an internationally competitive company tax, and pro-employment and enterprise industrial relations reform should be on the third term agenda the government must finally discover.\n\nThe IMF downgrade is no surprise. Substantial parts of the rural economy are in drought. The resource investment and housing construction booms are long gone, and infrastructure spending has maxed out capacity. With wages set to remain subdued, high household debt makes consumers hesitant to spend. As reported in yesterday\u2019s Financial Review, falling retail spending threatens the profits of firms reliant on discretionary income. Even the Reserve Bank now admits that the rush to prime the economy with cheap money could be counterproductive by sapping the \u201cincome and confidence of savers\u201d. And Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China, Brexit, Hong Kong and global tech disruption - combined with energy policy confusion and routine business bashing by populist politicians and regulators seeking ever bigger sticks - is prompting companies to return equity to shareholders rather than plough it into new investment exposed to increased political and regulatory risk.\n\nWith the cash rate down to 0.75 per cent and quantitative easing on next year\u2019s horizon, monetary policy stimulus is exhausted, as conceded by the Reserve Bank. The government, however, has pinned its hopes on low interest rates inflating a renewed housing boom (at the risk of destabilising the financial system). Hence the attack on \u201cprofiteering\u201d banks and the announcement of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission inquiry into mortgage pricing. But the \"wealth effect\" of rising house prices is unlikely to materialise, no matter how low interest rates fall, given record high levels of household debt.\n\nThe Morrison government must start the heavy policy lifting needed to drive economic growth. Michele Mossop\n\nBut this doesn\u2019t mean the government should heed calls, encouraged by Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe, to ramp up fiscal policy. As Treasurer Josh Frydenberg argued before flying out with Dr Lowe to the IMF annual meetings in Washington, Australia needs to rebuild a genuine budget buffer to cushion any actual economic downturn. Blowing the budget surplus after a decade of deficits would undermine household and consumer confidence that the government can in fact manage the nation\u2019s finances without hiking taxes. And, while Dr Lowe is cutting interest rates to try to bring down the value of the dollar, a budget expansion would act to push up the currency - pitting monetary policy and fiscal policy against each other.\n\nThe best way to raise the animal spirits of the economy is to change the incentives that governments can control. Fast-tracking the income tax cuts planned out to 2024, as suggested by Centre for Independent Studies researcher John Humphreys, would encourage people to work, save, invest and innovate, perhaps without blowing the budget surplus. But tax reform needs to go further; cutting the top personal rate, as Paul Keating has urged, would signal that Australia is open for enterprise. Cutting the uncompetitive 30 per cent company tax also would green light marginal investment projects and attract foreign capital. Freeing up workplace laws would put more people into work and working more productively. The growth dividend of good policy kick-starting the economy would be higher revenue to maintain the government\u2019s budget position. But achieving this virtuous circle begins with a first step: the Morrison government must re-discover the zeal for structural reform sadly lost amid the personality and populist politics of the last decade at great cost to the nation\u2019s economic fortunes.", "description": "The Morrison government should protect the surplus.
