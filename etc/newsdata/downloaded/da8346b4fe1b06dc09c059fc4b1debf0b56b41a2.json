Solium has more than 3,000 stock-plan clients, with 1 million participants, including fast-growing companies like Instacart, Shopify, and Stripe.\n\nRead more: Morgan Stanley just made its biggest bet since the financial crisis in a bid to win the hearts and minds of unicorn startup employees\n\nThe growth comes as competition ratchets up across the wealth-management spectrum. Legacy wealth managers like Morgan Stanley and its rival UBS, along with newer \u2014 and dirt-cheap \u2014 digital entrants, are vying for younger customers' dollars as analysts expect a massive wealth transfer in the coming years.\n\n\"We're going to start using our digital tools, our virtual advisers, to provide service for those clients, and they'll be priced competitively,\" Pruzan said. \"And we still think the economics of that channel and getting into that business is a very attractive one for us.\"\n\nThe Shareworks deal was also a play for assets that clients hold away from the firm that Morgan Stanley's financial advisers hope to instead oversee. Shareworks employees have $1.5 trillion of assets in other accounts.\n\nRead more: Morgan Stanley wants to roll out a feature for financial advisers to help instantly analyze news and data about portfolio holdings\n\n\n\nThe firm's wealth-management business reported $2.6 trillion in clients assets, a 3% rise from a year ago, and a 1% dip in annualized revenue per representative.
