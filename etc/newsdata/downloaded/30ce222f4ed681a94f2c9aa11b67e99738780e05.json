With the rise of the flight shaming movement that highlights the impact of aviation on the planet, travellers are being more conscious about the distances they will go for their holidays and finding ways to offset their carbon footprint.\n\nPlanes aren't the only modes of transport getting scrutinised in the tourism industry - cruise ships have also been thrown into the green spotlight after French port Cannes has started banning cruise ships that don't meet the European Union's cap of 0.1% of sulphur in their fuel, according to Reuters.\n\nWhile many might scoff at the idea of being trapped on a floating amusement park, the industry has boomed over the last two years. Bloomberg reports that passengers have increased from 17.8 million to 28.5 million last year, while Chinese passenger growth has increased by 40% every year since 2006.\n\nSEE: Nature reserve in Cradle of Humankind ends cub petting\n\nThis translates to millions of people a year with more than twice the carbon footprint than they would have had if they stayed on land, while also generating massive amounts of waste that tend to end up in our oceans.\n\nBut while only 58% of the world is optimistic that humanity will be able to tackle climate change according to a Global Optimism Outlook Survey by Expo 202 Dubai, changes are being made in the industry. Airplane manufacturers are making changes to new models to be more fuel-efficient like the A320neo, while cruise ships are being upgraded to be more environmentally sustainable, like the MSC Magnifica.\n\nSome airlines also offer carbon credits to passengers when booking their tickets.\n\nAnd while less than half of the world has a bleak outlook on the world, two-thirds of South Africans in the same survey believe we'll pull through. Earlier this year, the Southern Africa Tourism Services Association (Satsa) and South African Tourism (SA Tourism) launched a world-first with its Spekboom Initiative, a carbon offsetting initiative, which includes carbon-sucking spekboom plants to combat 'flight shame'.\n\nSpekboom is a carbon sponge, which has been said to be more effective at removing CO2 than the rainforest.\n\nThe next time you plan a long-distance trip, calculate your holiday carbon footprint, see how much you will be producing and plant some spekboom to help Mother Nature breathe a little easier once you're back.\n\nFind Your Escape by signing up for the Traveller24 Weekly Newsletter \u2013 Subscribe here.
