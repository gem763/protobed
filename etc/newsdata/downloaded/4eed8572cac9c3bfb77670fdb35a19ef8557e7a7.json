And now that they\u2019re newlyweds all over again, it looks like Justin has babies on the brain. Or at the very least he has babies on his Instagram.\n\nBieber has spent the past day or so low-key spamming everyone\u2019s IG feed with cute photos of babies, making it pretty clear that he wants to have one of his own thanks to comments like \u201cThis is something I look forward to :)\u201d\n\nAside from the above cuteness ^, Bieber posted this kid with the comment, \u201cHailey with your attitude and my savage behaviour [sic], we are in a world of trouble haha.\u201d\n\nAs if that\u2019s not enough cute kid content, Justin\u2019s been posting a slew of throwbacks of himself in elementary school, which I guess could be seen as a pretty good clue as to what his and Hailey\u2019s future child will look like. Behold:\n\nHailey and Justin haven\u2019t revealed their timeline for having kids (\u2019cause, uh, that\u2019s private), but last April they stirred up all kinds of controversy for pretending Hailey was pregnant in the name of April Fools.\n\nAnyway, until a BB Bieber joins the world, please go follow Justin\u2019s cats on Instagram, or as he calls them, his all-caps CAT FAMILY.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "Here for this content, tbh.", "authors": ["Mehera"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Akt3CF5j1C5u3HXABCadnQ--~B/aD0yNTA7dz00OTk7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmopolitan_438/183417b4241cd29e1e4e843f33ef8811", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
