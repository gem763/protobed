Gavin Newsom to buck Democrats, veto environmental bill", "language": "en", "text": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. \u2014 California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced he will buck Democratic legislative leaders by vetoing legislation aimed at stopping the Trump administration from weakening oversight of longstanding federal environmental laws in California.\n\nHis announcement Saturday came less than a day after lawmakers approved the bill on the chaotic final day of the year\u2019s legislative session.\n\nNewsom said in a statement he fully supports the aims of the bill but argued it wouldn\u2019t give California new authority to push back on the Trump administration. He also said it would stop California from relying on the best available science. His office further said he\u2019s concerned about a piece of the bill that could require the state to rely on Endangered Species Act opinions written roughly a decade ago.\n\nDespite his pledge to veto the bill, Newsom was quick to praise Senate President Pro Tempore Toni Atkins, the bill\u2019s author and an important ally for the freshman governor.\n\n\u201cI look forward to my continued partnership with Senate President Pro Tempore Toni Atkins - who is an extraordinary leader on the environment and for our state at large - to ensure California can continue to protect our environment and our workers against federal rollbacks, and push back against Trump\u2019s anti-environment agenda,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nAtkins, though, said she\u2019s \u201cstrongly disappointed\u201d in Newsom\u2019s decision, and she disputed his characterization of the bill. It allowed state agencies to use the best scientific evidence available and gave the state authority to \u201cbackstop baseline standards\u201d if the federal government rolled them back, she said in a statement.\n\nIn opposing the bill, Newsom is siding with the state\u2019s water contractors and Democratic U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t really have a California system and a federal system,\u201d said Jeffrey Kightlinger, general manager of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, which delivers water to nearly 19 million people. \u201cWe\u2019re all in the same country here, so we need to find a way to make this work.\u201d\n\nCalifornia has a history of blunting Republican efforts at the federal level to roll back environmental protections. In 2003, shortly after the George W. Bush administration lowered federal Clean Air Act standards, the Legislature passed a law banning California air quality management districts from revising rules and regulations to match.\n\nMore recently, after the Trump administration announced plans to roll back auto mileage and emission standards, Newsom used the state\u2019s regulatory authority to broker a deal with four major automakers to toughen the standards anyway.\n\nState lawmakers tried this last year, but a similar proposal failed to pass the state Assembly. But advocates say several recent announcements by the Trump administration - including plans to weaken application of the federal Endangered Species Act - have strengthened support for the bill.\n\nThe bill could have played out most prominently in the management of the state\u2019s water, which mostly comes from snowmelt and rain that rushes through a complex system of aqueducts to provide drinking water for nearly 40 million people and irrigation to the state\u2019s $20 billion agricultural industry.\n\nIt aimed to make it easier for state regulators to add animals protected under California\u2019s Endangered Species Act - animals that have historically been protected under federal law. It would then apply the state\u2019s Endangered Species Act to the Central Valley Project, a federally operated system of aqueducts and reservoirs that control flooding and supply irrigation to farmers.\n\nBut it\u2019s not clear if a state law would apply to a federal project, \u201cwhich could generate years of litigation and uncertainty over which environmental standards apply,\u201d according to a letter by Feinstein and four members of the state\u2019s Democratic congressional delegation.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "California Gov.
