The platform is similar to Depop in that it sells a wide range of items with a focus on high street brands such as Free People, Topshop, Zara and New Look.\n\nThe app is simple to navigate with categories across womenswear, menswear and children.\n\nVinted also offers buyers and sellers the option to swap clothes, making it a great option for anyone who is looking to save some money as well as the environment.\n\neBay\n\nToday, eBay is no longer just about online auctions \u2013 it\u2019s a place to bag some serious savings on everything including designer handbags, shoes and fine jewellery.\n\nThe app boasts a number of impressive features to help make your shopping experience easier, including the ability to set alerts for when new items under certain categories are listed.\n\nYou can even search for items just by taking a picture with your phone\u2019s camera.\n\nHardly Ever Worn It\n\nLondon-based app Hardly Ever Worn It is a online marketplace for new and used womenswear, menswear and children\u2019s clothing.\n\nWhile it specialises in luxury items, you can expect to find everything from an \u00a318 Cos T-shirt to an \u00a318,000 Fendi fur coat.\n\nThe app also occasionally collaborates with celebrities who are selling their clothes for charity, so you could end up owning something that once belonged to a Hollywood A-lister.", "description": "September has arrived and with it comes that \u201cback to school\u201d itch that begs us to overhaul our wardrobes with new season styles.
