A judge ruled that \u2018castle doctrine\u2019 might protect her.", "language": "en", "text": "Dallas County District Court Judge Tammy Kemp ruled Monday that the jury can consider the state\u2019s \u201ccastle doctrine\u201d in the trial of Dallas police officer Amber Guyger, who said she mistakenly walked into the apartment of Botham Jean, a 26-year-old accountant who lived one floor above her, and then shot him dead in September 2018, thinking he was a burglar.\n\nThe judge\u2019s decision to allow the defense to use the law, which says your home is your castle and you have a right to defend it, has raised the bar for prosecutors and sparked outrage and disbelief from critics who questioned how the law could protect Guyger when she shot Jean in his own apartment.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhy should you be allowed to break into someone\u2019s home, shoot them and then be let off the hook by the castle doctrine?\u201d Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Tex.), who is running for reelection in Texas, tweeted on Monday.\n\nThe case has split public opinion. Civil rights activists view Jean\u2019s death as another example of police brutality against innocent black people. But local law enforcement see the charges, which came amid a recent flurry of indictments of Dallas officers, as an indication that the former district attorney Faith Johnson was acquiescing to a \u201cnarrative that cops are bad,\u201d a police union president told the Dallas Morning News.\n\nGuyger, 31, was allegedly distracted with explicit text messages from her partner on the force on Sept. 6, 2018, and tired after a nearly 14-hour shift when she parked in the garage on her building\u2019s fourth floor, instead of the third where she lived, and walked to the unit immediately above her own. The door was unlocked. Jean sat in the living room eating a bowl of vanilla ice cream. Guyger, still in her police uniform, drew her gun and fired twice, killing him.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA week after the shooting, police searched the victim\u2019s apartment for marijuana \u2014 a tactic activists denounced as a character \u201csmear,\u201d the Morning News reported. Allegations of special treatment surfaced early in the trial last month, after testimony revealed responding officers left Guyger alone at the crime scene and allowed a police union president to turn off a camera and talk to her in a squad car shortly after the shooting.\n\nLee Merritt, a civil rights attorney representing Jean\u2019s family, told the Associated Press the jury will decide \u201cthe value of a black life.\u201d\n\nThe district attorney already faced challenges because of the strange facts of the murder. Guyger claimed she genuinely believed she was entering her own apartment, invoking a rarely used defense called \u201cmistake of fact.\u201d Essentially, legal analyst Pete Schulte told The Washington Post, the prosecution has to prove that Guyger could not have reasonably made the mistake of going to the wrong floor and opening her neighbor\u2019s door. Instead, the district attorney will need to convince a jury that Guyger intended to kill Jean.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very, very difficult for any prosecution,\u201d said Schulte, a Dallas-based a criminal defense lawyer and former Dallas County prosecutor and police officer, who is not connected to the trial.\n\nGuyger admitted on the stand that she shot to kill the young man because she thought he was burglarizing her apartment. Because of that mistake, her defense is built on a self-defense claim and now, after Kemp\u2019s 11th-hour ruling during a conference with attorneys on Monday, the Texas \u201ccastle doctrine.\u201d\n\nPassed in 2007 during a wave of \u201cstand your ground\u201d laws across the U.S., Texas\u2019 so-called \u201ccastle doctrine\u201d says that if four legal criteria are met, the law presumes that the use of deadly force is reasonable, Schulte said. For the statute to apply, the shooter must believe someone is trespassing illegally on their property, cannot provoke the victim and cannot be committing a crime when they pull the trigger. Finally, they must reasonably believe deadly force is necessary the moment they shoot.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Dallas trial may be the first time the castle doctrine has been applied to a murder that happened inside the victim\u2019s home. The judge decided that the defense could argue Guyger believed she was in her own apartment when she shot Jean, and could also claim that the law should apply as if she were acting in her own home. Before beginning deliberations, the jury received an instruction explaining both \u201cmistake of fact\u201d and the castle doctrine.\n\nOne of the prosecutors on the case, Assistant District Attorney Jason Fine, called Guyger\u2019s testimony \u201cgarbage\u201d in closing arguments, crumpling a piece of paper in his hands and tossing it in the trash can. He also objected to the idea that the castle doctrine could protect Guyger.\n\n\u201cIt protects homeowners against intruders and now all of a sudden, the intruder is trying to use it against the homeowner,\u201d Fine told the jury, CNN reported. \u201cThis law is not in place for her, it\u2019s in place for Bo.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nToby Shook, Guyger\u2019s defense attorney, told jurors the slaying was not murder, but the result of \u201ca series of horrible mistakes,\u201d the Associated Press reported. He emphasized Guyger\u2019s long shift and how other residents in the building reported accidentally going to the wrong unit because of the confusing parking garage. He characterized the shooting as a \u201csplit-second decision.\u201d\n\nThe decision to allow Guyger\u2019s defense team to invoke the castle doctrine in its defense surprised many in the courtroom, Schulte said.\n\n\u201cI think it shocked a lot of people, including me,\u201d Schulte said. \u201cThis case is so rare. You couldn\u2019t even make this up for a law school exam.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCNN legal analyst Paul Callan disagreed with Kemp\u2019s ruling, saying it \u201cmight give the jury an excuse to acquit officer Guyger even though she was not in her own home when she shot and killed Botham Jean.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe jury deliberated until 5 p.m. on Monday and will continue Tuesday morning. The four-year veteran officer could face five years to life in prison if she\u2019s convicted of murder. If jurors decide to convict her on manslaughter instead, her sentence could be two to 20 years in prison or probation.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at everything, she either committed murder or she committed murder with a defense,\u201d Schulte said. \u201cShe\u2019s not innocent, she\u2019s just not guilty of murder under these facts.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Castle doctrine usually protects gun owners defending their own home.
