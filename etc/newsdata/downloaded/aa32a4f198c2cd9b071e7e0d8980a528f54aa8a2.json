The Kurdish-led militia, known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, had operated under the protection of the United States, since its fighters had partnered with the American military in 2014 to push the Islamic State out of the region.\n\nBut Turkey considers the militia a threat to its national security since it is an offshoot of a guerrilla movement that has waged a decades-long insurgency against the Turkish state. The Turkish government wants its Syrian Arab proxies to establish a new autonomous zone in northern Syria in order to dilute Kurdish influence along its southern border.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Pence announced a deal with Turkey that gave American assent to Turkey\u2019s plan, in exchange for a five-day cease-fire that would allow Kurdish fighters to retreat safely from the region.\n\nBut the cease-fire has yet to fully take hold. Sporadic shelling continued on Saturday night and smoke could be seen billowing near a strategic town, observers on the border said.\n\nThe commander of the Kurdish-led forces, Mazloum Abdi, said in interviews with international news media on Saturday that Turkish troops had refused to let his fighters retreat. In response, the Turkish ministry said there were \u201cabsolutely no impediments to withdrawal.\u201d", "description": "Speaker Nancy Pelosi led a bipartisan delegation to meet the Jordanian king as an American-brokered truce with Turkey in northern Syria continued to stutter.", "authors": ["Patrick Kingsley"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/20/world/20prexy/20prexy-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
