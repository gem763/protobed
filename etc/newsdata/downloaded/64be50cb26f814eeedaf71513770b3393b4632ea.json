The Supreme Court shouldn\u2019t try to rewrite them.", "language": "en", "text": "At issue in Chisholm was whether the state of Georgia could be sued by the executor of an estate who was seeking to recover money owed him by the dead man. The Supreme Court read what was then the brand new Constitution as saying that the states could be sued by private citizens. But that\u2019s not what the framers and ratifiers of the Constitution intended, and the states and their representatives knew it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThey rebelled against the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling. What would become the 11th Amendment was drafted, passed Congress in March 1794 and was ratified by the states in February 1795, a record time. The original intent of the Constitution was restored. A useful principle was established for all future justices considering future cases: Don\u2019t mistake literalism for judging.\n\nA common mistake that critics of the approaches known as \u201coriginalism\u201d and \u201ctextualism\u201d make is that they think one or the other or both are the same as \u201cliteralism.\u201d Not so. The Supreme Court in 1793 went literal as opposed to \u201coriginalist,\u201d and triggered a rebuke that echoes down the centuries. Let\u2019s hope the court avoids the same mistake now. \u201cOriginalism\u201d and \u201ctextualism\u201d aim to interpret laws as they were understood by the public when they were passed, not elevating secret deals or \u201clegislative intent\u201d as tools of interpretation, but relying on the common, public understanding of the words used in the era they were employed to draft the law.\n\nAt issue in the pending Supreme Court case of R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is whether Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination against transgender people. Lots of people believe that such discrimination should be illegal. They have urged Congress repeatedly in recent years to pass amendments to Title VII to legislate such a bar. Those efforts have not been successful.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo a different method is being employed. Proponents of legislating against discrimination of the LGBTQ community are asking the court to rewrite the 1964 law. It would require a Chisholm v. Georgia level of indifference to obvious meaning and history to rule that the framers of the 1964 law intended their use of the word \u201csex\u201d to apply to \u201cgender\u201d as we understand it in 2019. It\u2019s a laughable argument. To read Title VII as applying to discrimination against transgender people is to import into Article III of the Constitution a legislative power for the federal courts. That Congress did not legislate on the subject of transgender rights in 1964 (or since) does not bar expansive state laws or congressional amendments to that effect in the future.\n\nBut this absence of legislative action should not lead the court to grab power. Thus, when Justice Neil M. Gorsuch announced from the bench on October 8 that the case was \u201creally close\u201d and then added \u201cAssume for the moment I\u2019m with you on the textual evidence,\u201d originalists and textualists across the country were stunned. What? Was he serious, or just bending over backward to try and understand a preposterous proposition? But Gorsuch couldn\u2019t possibly side with those arguing that the 1964 use of the word \u201csex\u201d had to be stretched to mean \u201ctransgender,\u201d could he?\n\nIf Gorsuch so holds, it will be a catastrophic blow to the originalism and textualist movement, which is really, simply, a \u201crule of law\u201d movement and a defense of \u201cseparation of powers,\u201d a demand that Congress legislate, presidents execute, courts judge and that they stay out of each other\u2019s business. In that division resides liberty\u2019s defense. Empower the courts to legislate, or rewrite old legislation, and the mask is off. The people will know that the government rules them, not they the government.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOral argument is an exercise, but decisions are not. A test is upon the court. Will it accept its collective limits? The common folk know what Title VII means and what it meant to prohibit. It\u2019s not even a hard case, much less a close one. A Chief Justice John Marshall quote from a different case, Barron v. City of Baltimore, should appear in this decision: \u201cThe question thus presented is, we think, of great importance, but not of much difficulty.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "When the Supreme Court goes too far, the justices might not like the response from the public.", "authors": ["Hugh Hewitt"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/VkvN6Hf4jBhQmqr0H3K1KwKosSQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/53JF6TXKAEI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
