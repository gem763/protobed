The promise would have preserved restrictive so-called \u201clevel-playing-field standards\u201d after the UK leaves the EU in exchange for access to European markets.\n\nHowever, media reports that Boris Johnson has scrapped that pledge in the Political Declaration, which sets out the draft future relationship between the UK and the bloc after Brexit.\n\nOne Cabinet source told The Sun: \u201cThe level-playing-field promise has to go, and Boris is very clear about this. It would seriously restrict our ability to deregulate and to do trade deals with other countries.\u201d\n\nNumber 10 sent the new version of the document to EU leaders along with Mr Johnson\u2019s proposed new deal which eliminates the Irish backstop. The backstop could lock the UK in regulatory alignment with the EU after the transition period, hampering the ability to sign free trade agreements with third countries.\n\nThe report comes after French minister Am\u00e9lie de Montchalin said on Thursday: \u201cI do not want to have a tax haven at the gates of Europe.\u201d\n\nEuropean countries have feared a Brexit Britain diverging away from the EU on regulations or becoming more welcoming to non-EU investors through lower-tax incentivisation.\n\nIn September, German Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed concern that Brexit would result in the EU having an \u201ceconomic competitor at our door\u201d.\n\nFrance Frightened of \u2018Tax Haven\u2019 Brexit Britain \u2018at the Gates of Europe\u2019 https://t.co/hHEGTHxooV \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 4, 2019\n\nThat the UK drifting away from the EU and towards historical ally and fellow Anglosphere nation the United States is also a worry for European Council President-elect Charles Michel. The current Belgian prime minister fretted: \u201cHow do we maintain a close relationship to the United Kingdom, our ally and neighbour? How will we repair the potential damage caused by a hard Brexit? The UK is now looking more and more toward the United States.\u201d\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has promised a free trade deal with the UK and soon as she is ready. A bilateral agreement could open up British and American markets to each other\u2019s goods, representing opportunities for business and choice for consumers on both sides of the pond.\n\nLast week, Prime Minister Johnson met with American and Canadian business leaders in New York City. He said: \u201cWe want to do so much more because our country is going up a gear.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cOn October 31st, we intend to be more global, more outward-looking, more committed to the rest of the world than ever before.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to take advantage of all the freedoms that Brexit can give whether it\u2019s new tax allowances for businesses or speedier public procurement contracts or creating new free ports, enterprise zones, devising better regulations for sectors the UK leads the world [\u2026 and] more competitive tax rates.\u201d\n\nWhile such language may disturb Eurocrats focused on preserving \u2018fair play\u2019 on the continent, President Trump has often criticised the protectionist EU racket, comparing the bloc to China and its practices.", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson has reportedly removed a pledge in a key Brexit document that would stop the UK becoming a competitor of the EU.", "authors": ["Victoria Friedman"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1173266919-e1570188291957-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
