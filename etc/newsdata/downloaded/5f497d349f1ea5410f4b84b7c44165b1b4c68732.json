The company said it violated its rules and it was used to ambush police.\n\nThe app uses data from protesters on the ground. Apple initially rejected it from its store. When it later appeared on the App Store, there was a sharply-worded response in official Chinese media.\n\nUnder the company's rules, apps have sometimes been removed after their release if they were found to facilitate illegal activity or threaten public safety.", "description": "Apple removed an app that protestors in Hong Kong have used to track police movements.", "authors": ["Oleksandra Vakulina"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/22/22/08/1000x563_cmsv2_560d6d82-8c17-5025-87d9-f798832100b4-4222208.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
