Singaporeans cheated of S$1.5 million by scammers pretending to be from Singtel", "language": "en", "text": "As part of the hoax, scammers impersonate Singtel\u2019s technical support staff and pretend to fix issues with customers\u2019 internet connections or modem. Reuters\n\nUnsuspecting Singaporeans have lost over S$1.5 million within a month, thanks to a new scam where crooks pretend to fix issues with their internet connection, the Singapore Police Force (SPF) announced on Wednesday (Sept 18).\n\nIt added that at least 21 cases of the scam had been reported since August.\n\nPolice said scammers impersonated the technical support staff of telco firm Singtel and pretended there were issues with victims\u2019 internet connections or modem.\n\nThey would then ask them to download and install software such as \u201cTeamviewer\u201d or \u201cAnyDesk\u201d on their computers, promising that this would help solve the issue.\n\nIn some cases, scammers claimed to represent the fictitious \u201cCyber Crime Department of Singapore\u201d or the \u201cCyber Police of Singapore\u201d and asked victims to download the software to assist with criminal investigations.\n\nThey would then ask victims to log in to their online banking accounts, and use the newly-installed software to secretly transfer funds out of the account.\n\nVictims of such scams should turn off their computers immediately and report the incident to their bank and the police, SPF said.\n\nThey should also change their online banking passwords and remove any unauthorised payee added to their bank accounts.\n\nThe SPF advised Singaporeans to be cautious about unsolicited calls claiming to be from telco providers or government agencies asking them to share financial information, install apps or log into online banking.\n\nInstead, they should call the company or organisation\u2019s official hotline to verify any requests, and talk to a friend or family member first.\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - Victims of such scams should turn their computers off  immediately..
