With my free 30-day trial of the subscription gaming service on the verge of expiring, I ask myself if I\u2019m getting enough out of it to give Apple eight of my hard-earned dollars to keep playing. Having barely made a dent in the 71 launch games, let alone the nine that have been added since, I\u2019d say I still have plenty of playing to do.\n\nStephen Totilo and I called Apple Arcade \u201cmobile gaming without all the bullshit\u201d in our initial impressions of the service, and that assessment holds true. Having instant access to a massive, curated selection of quality games with no annoying microtransactions, energy metres, life timers, or other annoyances of free-to-play mobile gaming has changed how I play games on my iPhone and iPad. Instead of immediately heading to the iTunes app store\u2019s game section to check out \u201cNew Games We Love,\u201d I go straight to the Arcade page to see if anything new has popped up.\n\nThe service has spoiled me for traditional free-to-play games, like the recently-released Mario Kart Tour. I don\u2019t mind the microtransaction model as much as some, but I\u2019ve started minding it more since Arcade went live. Why spend money on chances at winning random Mario karts and racers when there\u2019s a full-featured Sonic Racing game with all the trimmings on Arcade?\n\nApple Arcade hasn\u2019t reached the 100-game mark yet. Between the launch games and two subsequent mini-waves of releases (which included some surprises), the service has 80 titles to choose from. I\u2019ve downloaded every single one to my iPad Pro. Now when I pick up my tablet, I spend a good minute perusing the menu, trying to figure out what sort of game I\u2019m in the mood to play. The soothing picture puzzles of Patterns? The random multiplayer madness of Lego Brawls? The unique future racing of Super Impossible Road? The Zelda-riffic Oceanhorn 2? A \u201cPlay Random Apple Arcade Game\u201d button would not be unwelcome at this point.\n\nIs Apple Arcade\u2019s approach the future of gaming? I don\u2019t know, but I do know it\u2019s my next eight dollars\u2019 worth of gaming. We\u2019ll see how I feel next month.", "description": "It\u2019s been nearly a month since the official September launch of Apple Arcade.
