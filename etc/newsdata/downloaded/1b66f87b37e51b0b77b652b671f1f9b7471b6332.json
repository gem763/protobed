He opened the school with his business partner, Vince Jolivette, in 2014.\n\nFranco\u2019s representatives didn\u2019t return HuffPost\u2019s request for comment. The actor\u2019s attorney Michael Plonsker told Variety that Franco denies the allegations and will be seeking damages against the plaintiffs.\n\n\u201cThis is not the first time that these claims have been made and they have already been debunked,\u201d Plonsker told the entertainment magazine. \u201cWe have not had an opportunity to review the ill-informed Complaint in depth since it was leaked to the press before it was filed and our client has yet to even be served. James will not only fully defend himself, but will also seek damages from the plaintiffs and their attorneys for filing this scurrilous publicity seeking lawsuit.\u201d\n\nStudents of the school paid $300 a month in tuition to attend classes and train at Studio 4. According to the complaint, the school promised students that they could submit reels of their work that would be used as auditions for Franco\u2019s projects.\n\nHowever, the lawsuit claims that Franco\u2019s acting school \u201cduped\u201d young, unsuspecting acting students out of their money and served the defendant\u2019s \u201cfinancial and exploitative desires.\u201d\n\nTither-Kaplan and Gaal auditioned to be a part of the school\u2019s sex scene \u201cmaster class.\u201d The workshop cost $750 and required students to have their auditions filmed, according to the suit.\n\nGaal said in the complaint that she expressed concern over the audition process, which she said rewarded students who were willing to engage in simulated sexual acts that went far beyond industry standards.\n\nTither-Kaplan said her willingness to \u201cpush boundaries\u201d during the sex scene workshop to gain Franco\u2019s approval led to additional acting opportunities for her.\n\nShe told National Public Radio that the class didn\u2019t teach how to \u201cmaneuver in sex scenes professionally as an actor.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn fact, I didn\u2019t know anything about nudity riders, the detail required in them, the right to counsel with the director about nude scenes, the custom to choreograph nude scenes ahead of time to negotiate them with the cast and the director \u2014 I knew none of that throughout that class,\u201d she told NPR.\n\nTither-Kaplan first accused Franco of misconduct in 2018 with four other women after the actor showed up at the Golden Globe Awards with a pin symbolizing the Time\u2019s Up movement, which was launched by women in Hollywood in response to reports of rampant sexual assault in the industry.\n\nShe first sent a tweet criticizing the \u201cfull nudity\u201d scenes she did for him as exploitative. Days later, in an interview with the Los Angeles Times, she accused him of violating her and other actors who were performing a nude orgy scene by removing a plastic guard designed to keep actors separated while performing scenes of oral sex.\n\nHey James Franco, nice #timesup pin at the #GoldenGlobes , remember a few weeks ago when you told me the full nudity you had me do in two of your movies for $100/day wasn't exploitative because I signed a contract to do it? Times up on that! \u2014 Sarah Tither-Kaplan\ud83c\udf08 (@sarahtk) January 8, 2018\n\nFranco denied the accusations during an appearance on \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert\u201d that year.\n\n\u201cIn my life, I pride myself on taking responsibility for things that I\u2019ve done. I have to do that to maintain my well-being,\u201d Franco told Colbert.\n\n\u201cThe things that I heard that were on Twitter are not accurate,\u201d he added. \u201cBut I completely support people coming out and being able to have a voice because they didn\u2019t have a voice for so long, so I don\u2019t want to shut them down in any way. I think it\u2019s a good thing, and I support it.\u201d", "description": "In a class-action lawsuit, the women say the now-closed school \u201cduped\u201d young actors into serving Franco's \u201cfinancial and exploitative desires.\u201d", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d967f472200008a03dcea6c.jpeg?cache=a8vpbryhkt&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
