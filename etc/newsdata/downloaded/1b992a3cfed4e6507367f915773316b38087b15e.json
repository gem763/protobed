Since eating fish is only recommended once per week, purchase a purified, molecularly distilled omega 3 supplement, preferably one containing about twice as much brain-boosting DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) as EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid).Then stock up on foods rich in tyrosine , an amino acid your body needs to product dopamine and other mood-related neurotransmitters.

Or spent a carefree day without worrying about anything, just enjoying yourself? Or just smiled at someone you didn\u2019t know? It might seem far-fetched, but simple acts like smiling and laughing can improve your health. One thing I\u2019ve learned during more than two decades as a practicing physician is the powerful connection between emotions and health, something mainstream medicine tends to ignore. Many times, it turns out that a patient\u2019s health problems are caused by emotions, especially depression, rather than something physical. This is contrary to conventional medicine, where doctors rarely discuss feelings, leaving that topic to psychologists. Depression weakens your immune system , making you vulnerable to colds and infections. It also raises levels of stress hormones, boosting your blood pressure and heart rate, interrupting your sleep, wiping out your libido, intensifying any pains you have, and disrupting your digestion. The truth is, emotions have a tremendous impact on your health and longevity. Even something as simple as smiling or laughing can boost your body\u2019s levels of natural painkillers known as endorphins. And more endorphins means less cortisol, the stress hormone that contributes to weight gain and aging, and weakens your immune system, setting you up for repeat infections, colds, and flu as well as more serious diseases. Depression is so serious that it even shortens cancer patients\u2019 survival time. Here\u2019s my take on it: Smiling and laughing your way to better health isn\u2019t just some crazy notion from the fringes of medicine \u2013 it\u2019s a proven way to conquer ailments of all sorts. Let\u2019s take a look at how that works, starting with a little background. Author Norman Cousins made it clear back in the 80s. Diagnosed with a severe and crippling form of autoimmune disease, Cousins was told he had a few months to get his affairs in order. But he refused to accept that diagnosis. Instead, Cousins checked into a hotel with a stack of classic comedy films, a film projector, and massive doses of vitamin C . He not only recovered, but lived an additional 26 years! In his book about the experience,Cousins makes it clear that laughter and a sense of humor healed him. Eventually, Cousins\u2019s \u201cmiracle cure\u201d became the foundation of what\u2019s known as, a long word that basically means your emotions and health are connected. Even though there\u2019s now a substantial body of research into PNI, most doctors still ignore it. But here\u2019s my opinion \u2013 you don\u2019t need a doctor or antidepressants to improve your mood. Here are some simple ways to help you brighten your day and feel better fast., and a recent survey found that the majority of Americans are low in magnesium . Since the mineral has been removed from processed and prepared foods, eat more whole foods, including:Finally, if you\u2019re a chocolate lover, here\u2019s some good news.improves blood flow to the brain, lifting mood and helping with concentration. Plus, chocolate is a good source of magnesium, too. An ounce or two daily is all it takes, though, so don\u2019t go overboard. Too much of a good thing is still too much!", "description": "When was the last time you laughed so hard you .09/02/2019 3:16:19AM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png"}
