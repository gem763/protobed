The patient died after a \"long and complicated hospitalisation,\" officials said.\n\nHealth authorities said on Friday they are investigating Los Angeles County's first known death associated with vaping. Illinois and Oregon have also each reported a death.\n\nThe rising case counts drew an angry tweet from senator Dick Durbin, who threatened to call for the resignation of acting FDA chief Ned Sharpless.\n\nMost patients have been young and healthy. They had similar symptoms, including cough, chest pain or shortness of breath that appeared to take place over several days to several weeks before hospitalisation, according to a CDC report released Friday.\n\nAll patients reported using e-cigarettes, which officials define as battery-operated devices that heat a liquid and deliver an aerosolised product.\n\nClinicians in Utah and North Carolina said they had identified the presence of abnormal immune cells in the lungs of some patients, which could be a \"useful marker\" for a diagnosis of a rare form of pneumonia known as lipoid pneumonia, according to findings reported by University of Utah Hospital clinicians in the New England Journal of Medicine on Friday.\n\n\"That can occur when either oils or lipid-containing substances enter the lungs,\" said Daniel Fox, a pulmonologist and critical care physician at WakeMed Health and Hospitals in North Carolina.\n\nDr Fox said he had treated five patients, and those cases are being reported on Friday by North Carolina's health department.\n\nIn the joint investigation by Wisconsin and Illinois health departments, the earliest report of symptoms took place in mid-April.\n\nMost of the 53 patients were young healthy men, with a median age of 19. All but three patients were hospitalised. More than half required intensive care.\n\nOne third needed respirators to keep breathing. All used e-cigarettes or related products within 90 days of getting sick; a significant number reported vaping in the week before falling ill.\n\nAbout 84 percent of the patients told clinicians they used THC in e-cigarette devices. They reported using 14 different brands of THC products; the most common one was marketed under the \"Dank Vape\" label.\n\nThat label is sold online and industry sources say marketers often fill an empty cartridge with potentially unsafe ingredients and sell to unsuspecting customers.\n\nPatients also reported using 13 brands of nicotine products in a wide range of flavours.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
