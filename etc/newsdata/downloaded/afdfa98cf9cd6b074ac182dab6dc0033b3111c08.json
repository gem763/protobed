He obviously has no problem getting on private jets.\u201d\n\nMembers of the press and public recently criticized the Duke and Duchess of Sussex for reportedly taking four private flights in 11 days. Many of Meghan and Harry\u2019s celebrity friends, including Elton John, Ellen DeGeneres and Jameela Jamil, later came to the defense of the couple.\n\nPeter Nicholls / Reuters Harry and Meghan attend the Boston Red Sox v. New York Yankees match in London on June 29.\n\nMarkle, who has reportedly not spoken with his daughter since the day after the royal wedding in May 2018, has never met Harry in person and also hasn\u2019t met his grandson. Meghan and Thomas Markle became estranged after it was revealed he posed for paparazzi photos for money. He subsequently dropped out of his duties at the royal wedding and didn\u2019t attend the event.\n\nDespite their lack of contact \u2015 and Kensington and Buckingham palaces never responding to any of Markle\u2019s claims or comments \u2015 he said he wants the royal couple to send him a photo of his grandson, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that what any grandfather would want? I\u2019d love to know if he\u2019s got the famous Markle nose,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI had hoped becoming a mother would mellow Meghan and she would reach out,\u201d Markle added. \u201cI\u2019ve stayed quiet because Meghan was pregnant with Archie but I\u2019m speaking out now because they and their PR people are continuing to ghost me out of her life.\u201d\n\nPOOL New / Reuters This official christening photograph shows the Duke and Duchess of Sussex with their son, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, on July 6.\n\nAlthough Markle claims he \u201cstayed quiet\u201d when Meghan was pregnant, he actually shared a private, emotional letter reportedly written by the duchess a few months before she gave birth to Archie. He also spoke out after the birth of his grandson and again gave an interview after he wasn\u2019t invited to Archie\u2019s christening. Meghan\u2019s mother, Doria Ragland, did attend.\n\nCHRIS ALLERTON via Getty Images The family gathered for a group photo at Archie\u2019s christening in the Green Drawing Room at Windsor Castle on July 6.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex plan to take Archie with them on a trip to South Africa this fall.\n\nPrince Harry released a statement about the trip on the Sussex Royal Instagram on Sunday.\n\n\u201cIn just a few weeks our family will be taking its first official tour to Africa, a region of the world that over the past two decades has been a second home to me,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOur team has helped create a meaningful programme that we\u2019re so excited to share with you. On a personal note, I can\u2019t wait to introduce my wife and son to South Africa!
