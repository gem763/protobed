On his inauguration day, a Washington Post headline read, \u201cThe campaign to impeach President Trump has begun.\u201d\n\nThat campaign has been in full swing ever since. So let\u2019s make no mistake: This process isn\u2019t about concerns over alleged high crimes or misdemeanors.\n\nThis is about the Democratic Party, still bitter years later, trying to undo the 2016 election.\n\nI ask unanimous consent that this Washington Post article from January 20, 2017, be entered into the Congressional Record.", "description": "Sen.
