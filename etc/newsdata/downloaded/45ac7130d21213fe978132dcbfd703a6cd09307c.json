But unlike the first application, the updated version states that Coinbase will be confirming the availability of assets used to secure the trust within five business days from the moment of its monthly rebalancing.\n\nIn addition, Wilshire draws the SEC's attention to the fact that when ETFs were approved for gold, the regulator focused on spot and futures markets which have \u201ca meaningful impact on the particular ETP,\u201d although gold is also traded in different market segments, adding:\n\n\u201cFocusing on the spot market is appropriate because the spot market is the market to which the particular ETP would look to determine its NAV.\u201d\n\nThe same approach, the document argues, should be taken in regard to Bitcoin ETFs. Wilshire states that the trust is using \u201cthe CME CF BRR to determine the NAV of the Bitcoin held\u201d which \u201cexclusively utilizes its Constituent Platforms,\u201d explaining:\n\n\u201cSince [...] CME CF BRR is determined based on the price of Bitcoin on the Constituent Platform and no other exchanges, the Sponsor maintains that the proper \u2018market\u2019 that one should evaluate to determine whether the \u2018market\u2019 is inherently resistant to manipulation is the segment of the market formed by the Constituent Platforms. [...] An independent examination of the methodology (Paine & Knottenbelt) of the CME CF BRR, supports the Sponsor\u2019s assertion that the CME CF BRR is not susceptible to manipulation.\u201d\n\nPredicaments of Bitcoin ETFs\n\nWilshire's updated application was filed on October 4. It completely cancels the previous one, comments on which the SEC began collecting back in June. At the time, only six individuals had submitted their opinions on the proposal, according to the SEC\u2019s website.\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported previously, the SEC started proceedings to determine whether to approve or disapprove the proposed rule change, which would allow NYSE Arca to list and trade shares of Wilshire Phoenix\u2019s Bitcoin and Treasury Investment Trust, on Sept. 24.\n\nAlso in September, another Bitcoin ETF proposal, this time from VanEck and SolidX, was withdrawn by its sponsors.\n\nOn Oct. 9, the SEC has stated that the Bitcoin ETF filing from Bitwise Asset Management and NYSE Arca did not meet the necessary requirements. The companies later said that they intend to refile their proposal in the future.", "description": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission once again begins accepting comments regarding the updated Bitcoin exchange-traded fund proposal by Wilshire Phoenix", "authors": ["Liam Frost"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy81MTQzYmUwOTM1YWRiNTNkZjVhOGNmNmM1ZDRmNzczOS5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
