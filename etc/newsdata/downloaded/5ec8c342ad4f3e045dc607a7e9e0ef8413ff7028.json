Those include a dispute over whether to finance a wall along the southern border with Mexico, which left Washington gridlocked in the longest partial government shutdown on record.\n\nWhile the White House and Democrats were able to compromise on top-line budget numbers in July, they remained sharply divided over how to distribute the $1.4 trillion package. Trump has demanded that billions of dollars go toward border-wall construction, one of his signature campaign promises, while Democrats maintained that taxpayer money should prioritize domestic programs such as healthcare.\n\nBetween those spats and a newly launched impeachment inquiry against Trump, some lawmakers have braced for the possibility that a budget for the full fiscal year might not be reached anytime soon. That could instead leave Congress with a number of so-called continuing resolutions like the one passed on Friday, Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby said this week.\n\nOn Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi initiated impeachment proceedings against Trump after a whistleblower complaint said he pressured Ukraine to investigate a 2020 campaign rival. Concerns over the phone call at the center of the scandal, as well as alleged efforts by the White House to \"lock down\" records of it, have only risen since then.\n\n\"The House's impeachment inquiry will not diminish our commitment to negotiating appropriations bills that invest in American families,\" Democratic Rep. Nita Lowey, the chair of the House Appropriations Committee, said. \"I hope that Republicans will negotiate with us in good faith to get this important work done.\"\n\nThe Senate passed the bill 82-15 on Thursday. Last week, the House voted 301-123 to approve it.\n\nRead more: Trump ramps up his criticisms of China's trade policies as tariff escalations loom", "description": "The short-term legislation punted a standoff over border security only until just before Thanksgiving.", "authors": ["Gina Heeb"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8bc0c22e22af3fff0a2591?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
