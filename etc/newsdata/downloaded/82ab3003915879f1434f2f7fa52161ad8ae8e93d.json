He is a very good footballer.\n\n\u2018I know maybe last year he got a little bit of stick and stuff here and there but he\u2019s a very good footballer.\n\n\u2018He controls and dictates games.\u2019\n\nMaddison and Winks did battle at the King Power Stadium last month (Picture: Getty)\n\nMaddison added: \u2018Harry Winks is another example who is a very good passer of the ball.\n\n\u2018Obviously we played Tottenham and the job was to stop the danger players forcing it through the lines because that\u2019s where they will hurt you.\n\n\u2018But, even then, when we\u2019re doing that really well, sometimes Harry Winks with the quality he had was able to play through with a quick pass \u2013 two touch, receives it, turns and passes through.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s the quality of opposition we play against so there\u2019s never a moment when you can switch off and not do you\u2019re defensive duties because you get punished.\u2019\n\nMORE: The five Tottenham players Mauricio Pochettino is ready to sell in January", "description": "James Maddison has reserved special praise for Chelsea and Tottenham stars Jorginho and Harry Winks, two midfielders who have caused Leicester problems in the Premier League this season.
