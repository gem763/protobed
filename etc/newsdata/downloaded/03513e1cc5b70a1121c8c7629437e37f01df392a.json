I was lucky in a way to see such a beautiful creature.\n\n\"There I was standing so close to this magnificent creature, with the motorway traffic whizzing about above me.\n\n\"It was moving in really fast water. We were afraid of losing it so we called for assistance.\n\n(Image: Humphrey Nemar/)\n\n\"It took four hours at one and a half miles per hour. We had three boats involved, Easthaven, Kew and the RNLI. Kew dragged it.\n\n\"The whale is very big, it's at least ten metres long.\n\n\"Exact details about length and weight will come out in the next few days. A whale in the Thames is very rare \"It was very big - it's at least ten metres long.\"", "description": "WARNING UPSETTING IMAGES: A post mortem is being held to establish the exact cause of death and whether the possible sip strike occurred while Hessy was alive or after her death", "authors": ["Abigail O'Leary", "Image", "Humphrey Nemar", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20546748.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_HN-str91019deadhumpback09JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
