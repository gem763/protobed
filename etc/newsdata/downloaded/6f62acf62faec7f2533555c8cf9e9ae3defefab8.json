I said, \u2018What are they coming for?\u2019 He said just to check it out and be sure it\u2019s safe,\u201d Treat explained.\n\nNot too long after Pacheco reached out to Treat, the Nampa Fire Department came to Treat\u2019s house with a hook and ladder truck and a pickup truck full of materials to build the wheelchair ramp.\n\nTreat said he was overwhelmed by the situation.\n\n\u201cI just was overwhelmed, hard not to get teary-eyed, you know,\u201d he said.\n\nOther veterans have recently been surprised with improved homes as a thank you for serving in the military. A wounded Marine veteran injured in Iraq got the surprise of a lifetime on Saturday when the nonprofit Building Homes for Heroes gifted him a mortgage-free home in Savannah.", "description": "A local Idaho fire department surprised a disabled veteran with a wheelchair ramp after neighbors noticed he had difficulty getting around.", "authors": ["Katherine Rodriguez"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-91561117-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
