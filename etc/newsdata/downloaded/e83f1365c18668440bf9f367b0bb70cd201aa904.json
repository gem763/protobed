Justice Department officials insist Barr was unaware of Trump\u2019s comments at the time of the July 25 call.\n\nWhen Barr did learn of that call a few weeks later, he was \u201csurprised and angry\u201d to discover he had been lumped in with Giuliani, a person familiar with Barr\u2019s thinking told The Associated Press. This person was not authorized to speak about the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nGiuliani, a former New York City mayor, often appears in rambling television interviews as a vocal defender of the president. Giuliani represents Trump\u2019s personal interests and holds no position in the U.S. government, raising questions about why he would be conducting outreach to Ukrainian officials.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": ""}
