Do your children use iPads? Can you answer these questions? Do you have air conditioning? Do you walk your kids to school? Do you see the problem with all this?\n\n\u2018You go on about your kids not getting out of bed because they\u2019re terrified, I\u2019m not surprised they\u2019re terrified because their mum\u2019s telling them the planet\u2019s about to end. I bet your own carbon footprint on all the stuff I just mentioned is terrible.\u2019\n\nPiers advised the activist to \u2018practice what you preach\u2019 by giving up technology and walking her children to school instead of using cars or public transport.\n\nThe guest then attempted to defend her position and said: \u2018Unless you live in a wood completely a recluse on your own, you\u2019re going to be part of the system.\u2019\n\nThe activist admitted to accepting the car GMB had sent for her (Picture: ITV)\n\nPiers lost his cool (Picture: ITV)\n\nThe TV presenter hit back: \u2018If you genuinely believe the world\u2019s about to end, start with your own carbon footprint. Otherwise you become the Prince Harry and Meghan Markle of this debate which is you do one thing and say another.\u2019\n\nTensions then escalated when Piers continued to interrupt her, shouting: \u2018Does your carbon footprint matter? Can you try answering one question seriously. Can you please stop talking?\n\n\u2018Sorry, I\u2019m really having a problem here. You\u2019re not answering a single question. Does your personal carbon footprint count, yes or no? Can you stop talking for a moment?\u2019 he said before exclaiming in frustration: \u2018Jesus Christ.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPiers continued: \u2018Unbelievable. Sorry I\u2019m really frustrated here\u2026 Total waste of time.\n\n\u2018The truth is you do have a television and you don\u2019t want to admit to having a television is because that immediately throws you into the hypocrisy debate because you\u2019re guzzling up and burning the atmosphere with your TV, and you don\u2019t want to admit it because it makes you look like a rank hypocrite.\u2019\n\nHe finished by advising her to \u2018start with action in your own house\u2019.\n\nGood Morning Britain continues weekdays at 6am on ITV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
