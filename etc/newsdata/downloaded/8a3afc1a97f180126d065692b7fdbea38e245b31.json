While digital downloads also spiked 569% over the same two-day period, the total for the week still only amounted to about 1,000 song downloads.\n\nZack Guzman is the host of YFi PM as well as a senior writer and on-air reporter covering entrepreneurship, cannabis, startups, and breaking news at Yahoo Finance.
