The Turkish leader had long been planning such a move, Trump said, adding that he did not want U.S. forces in harm\u2019s way.\n\nEuropean allies have also been critical of the move and called on Turkey to halt its military operations.\n\nMattarella, standing alongside Trump in the White House, said he had discussed the situation with the U.S. president and that Italy condemns the Turkish offensive.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday said the United States was \"going to try to work it out\" with Turkey regarding its assault into northeastern Syrian, but U.S. sanctions would be \"devastating\" if discussions with Ankara do not go well.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
