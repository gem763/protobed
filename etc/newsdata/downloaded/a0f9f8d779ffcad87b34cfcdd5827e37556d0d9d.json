Jonathan Atkins/Handout via REUTERS\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Several investment managers have shown interest in taking over the running of the LF Woodford Income Focus Fund, formerly managed by Neil Woodford, the supervisor of the fund said on Wednesday.\n\nThe authorised corporate director Link Fund Solutions told investors on Oct. 16 it was suspending the fund, after Woodford, once one of Britain\u2019s most feted money managers, shut his firm following the winding-up by Link of his flagship LF Woodford Equity Income Fund.\n\nLink is also considering transferring the income focus fund\u2019s assets into another fund, it said in a letter to investors, but could wind up the fund if neither of these options proved viable.\n\nLink, whose role is to ensure the fund adheres to regulations, said Woodford was continuing to work with the firm \u201ccollaboratively\u201d as the fund\u2019s investment manager.\n\nWoodford previously said he could not accept Link\u2019s closure of the equity income fund.\n\nUnlike the 3 billion pound ($3.86 billion) equity income fund, the income focus fund is not exposed to unlisted assets.\n\nIt has 255 million pounds in assets under management, according to Morningstar, having halved in value since the suspension of the equity income fund.\n\nLink, said the income focus fund\u2019s suspension would continue and it would provide a further update by Nov 13.\n\n($1 = 0.7763 pounds)", "description": "Several investment managers have shown interest in taking over the running of the LF Woodford Income Focus Fund, formerly managed by Neil Woodford, the supervisor of the fund said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446486127&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T0NZ", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
