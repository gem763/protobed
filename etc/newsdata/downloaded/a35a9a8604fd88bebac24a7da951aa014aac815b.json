TAFE spending is due to come under the microscope during Senate estimates after the federal government was accused of short-changing vocational education by $214 million in the last financial year. Labor claimed the under-spend was not a new issue and that the Education Department declined to spend close to a billion dollars in funding in the past five years. Ms Plibersek told Sky News \u201cwe\u2019ve got skill shortages right across the economy, there are so many areas and we have a desperate need for skilled workers\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve got Australians who want more hours of work and the government has under-spent the TAFE and training budget,\u201d she said.
