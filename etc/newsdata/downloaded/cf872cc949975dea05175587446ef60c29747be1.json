Bernard Sanders and proponents of the \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d to tackle climate change.\n\n\u201cTo me, Bernie misses a few really important truths. Number one, if you put money into our hands in a dividend, we\u2019re going to spend it right there in our economy \u2014 it\u2019s going to be trickle up. \u2026 It\u2019s going to create hundreds of thousands of jobs at restaurants, garages, tutoring services, day care \u2014 where we live and work,\u201d Mr. Yang, an entrepreneur, said Thursday evening on CNN.\n\nMr. Yang had been asked what his response would be to someone like Mr. Sanders arguing that a federal jobs guarantee would be better than a \u201chandout.\u201d\n\nHe said the second issue is that a federal jobs guarantee could leave out people like his wife, who cares for their boys at home, and nurturers and caregivers.\n\n\u201cThe third thing is that Bernie somehow imagines that millions of Americans aspire to work for the government, which we do not,\u201d Mr. Yang said. \u201cIf you think about a federal jobs guarantee in practice, who says what the jobs are? What if you don\u2019t like that job? What if you\u2019re not good at that job? Who manages you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are all of these really tricky details in implementation that make a federal jobs guarantee much, much better in the abstract than in real life,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Yang will be able to make his case when he shares the stage with Mr. Sanders and eight other candidates at the Democratic presidential debate next month.\n\nHis rise in some recent polling means Mr. Yang has been positioned closer to center stage than candidates such as former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas, Sen. Cory A. Booker of New Jersey, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
