A Pasta\u2019s Infinite Possibilities", "language": "en", "text": "WHEN CHEF MARK LADNER decided to serve fried lasagna at his New York restaurant Pasta Flyer, he knew it would demand a careful dance. His objective: individual bites that crisped uniformly on the outside, \u201csort of like the corner of the lasagna,\u201d yet retained all of lasagna\u2019s non-negotiables: visible layers, chewy pasta, a melty, saucy interior. \u201cYou have to find a balance,\u201d he said.\n\nThis dish relies on a delicate system of architectural supports\u2014silky layers of pasta suspended in elegant horizontals by the sheer force of sauce and soft cheese. Over the course of writing an entire book about lasagna, I spent hours wondering how far you can push the boundaries and still call it lasagna. In the depths of the internet, I found lasagnas built as tall as bundt cakes, congealed into eerie rigidity. I saw lasagna soups that seemed, confusingly, to celebrate the dish\u2019s soggiest attributes. And there were lasagnas with fillings that certainly wouldn\u2019t be my first choice: refried beans, watercress, barbecue sauce.\n\nStill, to limit yourself to the standard red sauce and ricotta is to miss out on a whole colorful world of alterna-lasagnas. The best ones aren\u2019t afraid to shake things up a little, but they work within the logic of lasagna. They break rules as they go in favor of a satisfying end result.\n\n\u201cMy method is unorthodox because it\u2019s not baked,\u201d said Mr. Ladner of his fried lasagna bites, which rely on a combination of refrigerating, freezing and frying. \u201cI weight it, refrigerate it overnight, and then cut it while it\u2019s cold before cooking so that it\u2019s easier to work with. You\u2019re using the refrigeration process to enhance the structure.\u201d\n\nAfter the chilled lasagna is cut into dense little cubes, those are frozen and coated in flour several times to build a barrier guard against hot oil seeping through to the center of the lasagna. The result is a heap of tiny, miraculously free-standing slices of lasagna that are golden brown and crackly on the outside, full of melted ricotta and fruity tomato sauce on the inside.\n\n\u201c \u2018Within the parameters of wide noodles and casserole pans, there\u2019s a world of experimentation to pursue.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIt might seem similarly counterintuitive to stack raviolis in a pan and bake them, but this happens to produce the quickest, cleverest lasagna you will make in your life. It\u2019s as simple as making a basic tomato sauce in a skillet, dumping in a bag of frozen cheese ravioli (which stand in for ricotta and lasagna noodles) and letting the ravioli simmer until they\u2019re cooked through. Add a couple layers of mozzarella, throw it in the oven, and after 10 minutes you have a beautiful round lasagna, browned and bubbly on top.\n\nEven within the parameters of wide noodles and casserole pans, there\u2019s a world of experimentation to pursue once you realize that most delicious ingredients can be sliced very thinly or chopped up and mixed into ricotta. Want to turn spaghetti carbonara into lasagna? Fold in pancetta and shallots, and drop eggs into the lasagna, toad-in-the-hole style, for the last few minutes of baking. The yolks will stay gooey and coat the pasta as you eat.\n\nIf you\u2019re trying to figure out whether an ingredient or flavor combination might work well in lasagna form, ask yourself whether you would be happy to eat it with pasta. Then ask yourself if it would be even better after a few extra minutes in the oven\u2014a little bit toasted and crispy on top and around the edges. Steamed mussels? Maybe not. Eggplant parmesan? Definitely.\n\nSpeedy Skillet Ravioli Lasagna\n\nThanks to a little help from a package of frozen ravioli, you can pull a skillet of toasty, bubbly lasagna from the oven in little more than half an hour. For this ingenious one-pan supper, you make a tomato sauce right in the same skillet you use to bake the whole thing, and the ravioli\u2014layered with mozzarella and Parm\u2014cooks and soaks up the tomato flavor at the same time the starch from the pasta thickens the sauce.\n\nTOTAL TIME: 35 minutes SERVES: 6-8\n\nFor the tomato sauce:\n\n2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n\n2 large cloves garlic, thinly sliced\n\n2 tablespoons tomato paste\n\nPinch of red pepper flakes\n\n1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes\n\n2 large fresh basil sprigs, plus torn leaves for garnish\n\n1 teaspoon sugar\n\n1 teaspoon kosher salt\n\n\u00bc teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n\nFor the lasagna:\n\n1\u00bd pounds frozen cheese ravioli\n\n8 ounces mozzarella cheese (preferably fresh), shredded (2 cups)\n\nParmesan cheese\n\n1. Make the tomato sauce: Preheat oven to 450 degrees with a rack in the center. Heat oil in a large ovenproof skillet over medium heat until shimmering, about 2 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring, until softened but not browned, 1-2 minutes. Add tomato paste and cook, stirring, until darkened slightly, 1-2 minutes. Add red pepper flakes, crushed tomatoes, basil sprigs, sugar and 1 cup water. Season with salt and black pepper, and increase heat slightly to bring to a boil.\n\n2. Cook the ravioli: Gently separate any frozen ravioli stuck together without tearing. (Any that resist will separate during cooking.) Add ravioli to skillet and cook over medium heat, stirring gently, until sauce is very thick and ravioli are just tender, about 15 minutes.\n\n3. Assemble the ravioli lasagna: Spoon half the ravioli and sauce into a bowl. Arrange ravioli in skillet in an even layer and sprinkle with half the mozzarella. Arrange remaining ravioli on top and sprinkle with Parmesan and remaining mozzarella.\n\n4. Bake the ravioli lasagna: Bake until sauce is bubbling and cheese is lightly browned, 10-12 minutes. Scatter basil leaves on top and let rest 10 minutes before serving.\n\nCarbonara Lasagna\n\nPhoto: Dylan James Ho + Jeni Afuso\n\nTOTAL TIME: 2 hours SERVES: 6-8\n\nThis lasagna version of spaghetti carbonara is as delicious with a chilled Lambrusco on a Friday night as it is for breakfast the next morning with cold brew.\n\nFor the fresh pasta sheets:\n\n2 cups all-purpose flour plus more for rolling\n\n3 large eggs, at room temperature\n\n1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil\n\n1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for boiling\n\nFor the lasagna:\n\n1 tablespoon unsalted butter, plus more for the dish\n\n12 ounces thick-sliced pancetta, cut into \u00bc-inch dice\n\n2 medium shallots, halved and thinly sliced 1 pound ricotta cheese\n\n4 ounces Fontina cheese, shredded (about 1 cup)\n\n2 ounces freshly grated Parmesan cheese (about \u00bd cup)\n\n1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves\n\n1\u00bd cups heavy cream\n\n\u00bd teaspoon coarse kosher salt\n\n\u00bc teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n\n1 recipe (12 sheets) fresh pasta sheets, cooked\n\n4 large eggs\n\n1. Make the fresh pasta sheets: Place flour, eggs, olive oil and salt in a food processor and pulse at 1-second intervals until a moist dough comes together in small beads that resemble couscous. (Don\u2019t let the dough form a ball.)\n\n2. Turn dough out onto a work surface and knead (without adding flour) until smooth and elastic, 2-3 minutes. (Dough will be almost too stiff to knead.) Wrap dough in plastic and set aside to rest and soften at room temperature, 30 minutes-1 hour.\n\n3. Arrange several clean kitchen towels on a work surface and dust lightly with flour. Cut dough into quarters and cover 3 pieces with a damp towel. Flatten remaining piece of dough and dust lightly with flour. Roll dough through a pasta machine, starting on the lowest (widest) setting. Fold rolled dough into thirds like a letter, then roll through again, feeding open end (where you can see the fold) through first. Repeat three times, then start to roll dough using thinner settings, folding it and putting it through the same setting two times before progressing to the next, thinner setting, flouring dough as needed to keep it from sticking. Continue to second-to-last setting (#6 on most machines, or the thickness of two playing cards). The rolled sheet should measure 4-5 inches wide and 22-24 inches long.\n\n4. Cut rolled sheet into three 8-inch sheets and place on floured kitchen towels. Repeat with remaining 3 pieces of dough. Turn sheets on kitchen towels occasionally so they dry slightly. They should be pliable but a bit leathery.\n\n5. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook pasta in 2 batches, boiling just until tender and color changes from deep to pale yellow, about 1 minute. Remove sheets, drain and rinse briefly with cold water. Arrange sheets on clean kitchen towels, pressing to flatten. Use immediately or keep covered at room temperature up to 1 hour.\n\n6. Make the lasagna: Preheat oven to 375 degrees with a rack in lower third. Lightly butter an 8-by-11-inch (2-quart) glass or ceramic baking dish.\n\n7. Make the cheese mixture: Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add pancetta and cook, stirring occasionally, until most fat is rendered and pancetta is golden, 8-10 minutes. Add shallots and cook over medium heat, stirring, until softened, about 5 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer shallots and pancetta to a bowl. Let cool slightly, then stir in ricotta, Fontina and Parmesan.\n\n8. Infuse the cream: Pour off fat and return skillet to medium-high heat. Stir in thyme, then cream, scraping up browned bits from pan. Bring just to a simmer and season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat.\n\n9. Assemble the lasagna: Cut noodles to fit dish and arrange a layer of two in bottom, overlapping slightly. Dollop with a quarter of cheese mixture and top with another layer of noodles. Repeat three more times with remaining filling and noodles, ending with a layer of noodles (you will have several leftover). Pour infused cream over lasagna. Shake dish gently to distribute. Press with a spatula to compact slightly.\n\n10. Bake lasagna until golden, about 40 minutes. Crack eggs into individual bowls. Press a 2-inch round cookie cutter into lasagna, going about halfway down. Remove top layers of lasagna to create a well. Repeat to create three more wells. Gently drop 1 egg in each and return lasagna to oven. Cover with foil and bake until egg whites just set, 5-7 minutes more. Let rest 15 minutes before serving.\n\nFried Lasagna Bites\n\nThese lasagna bites come from the genius of chef Mark Ladner. They are crispy on the outside, like the corner bits of a baked lasagna, and soft and gooey on the inside. They\u2019re not that difficult to make, but they do require getting started a few days before you\u2019re planning to eat them, considering they need to be refrigerated, frozen, rested and then frozen again. That said, because they are cooked from frozen, they can be made days before a party and fried right before serving. Think of them as a lasagnified version of the Pizza Rolls you used to keep in your dorm freezer. To simplify, you can skip the homemade marinara sauce (go straight to step 4) and use your favorite store-bought brand.\n\nPhoto: Dylan James Ho + Jeni Afuso\n\nTOTAL TIME: 3 days (includes freezing and resting) MAKES: 8-10 snack-size servings\n\nFor the marinara sauce:\n\nExtra-virgin olive oil\n\nCoarse kosher salt\n\n\u00bd teaspoon dried red pepper flakes\n\n2 medium garlic cloves, peeled and smashed\n\n\u00bd small yellow onion, finely chopped (about \u00bc cup)\n\n1 (28-ounce) can whole peeled plum tomatoes with their juices\n\n1\u00bd tablespoons double-concentrated tomato paste (or 3 tablespoons regular tomato paste)\n\n\u00bd loosely packed cup fresh basil leaves\n\n1 tablespoon sugar\n\nFor the lasagna Bites:\n\n1 large egg, lightly beaten, plus 1 large egg white\n\n1\u00bd cups fresh whole-milk ricotta cheese\n\n3 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese\n\n2 tablespoons freshly grated Pecorino Romano cheese\n\nPinch of freshly grated nutmeg\n\n15 dry lasagna noodles, cooked and cooled\n\n1 cup all-purpose flour\n\n2 quarts (\u00bd gallon) canola oil, for frying\n\nSpecial equipment: 2 standard half-sheet pans (18-by-13-inch with 1-inch rim) or 2 (18-by-13-inch) baking dishes; cooling rack (18-by-13-inch or larger); fry thermometer\n\n1. Make the marinara sauce: Add 1\u00bd tablespoons olive oil, 1 teaspoon salt, the red pepper flakes, garlic and onion to a small Dutch oven or medium saucepan set over medium heat. Cook, stirring often, until garlic is very lightly golden and onion is soft, about 3 minutes. Transfer mixture to a food processor. (Set the pot aside to use again in step 3.)\n\n2. To the onion mixture, add tomatoes with their juices, tomato paste, basil, sugar and \u00bd teaspoon salt, and puree until well blended but with pieces of tomato remaining.\n\n3. Return sauce to Dutch oven, bring it to a gentle simmer over low heat, and cook until reduced by about half, about 1 hour. (You should end up with approximately 2 to 2\u00bd cups of sauce.) Remove from heat and let cool completely. (Sauce can be kept, covered and refrigerated, up to 4 days, or frozen for up to 1 month.)\n\n4. Make the ricotta filling: In a mixing bowl, combine egg, egg white, ricotta, Parmesan and Pecorino Romano cheeses, and nutmeg. Using a rubber spatula, mix ingredients well until egg and cheeses are fully combined. (Cheese filling can be kept, covered and refrigerated, up to 3 days.)\n\n5. Assemble the lasagna: Line the inside of a 13-by-18-inch rimmed baking sheet or baking dish with plastic wrap, making sure all the edges of the pan are covered. Evenly spread 1 tablespoon olive oil and 2 tablespoons marinara sauce over plastic wrap. Add a layer of noodles (about 3 noodles), laying them inside the baking sheet lengthwise, barely overlapping their edges so there is no space between noodles. Spread 3 more tablespoons marinara over noodles, then use a large spoon to evenly spread out 5 tablespoons ricotta filling over sauce. Lay a second layer of noodles over the top crosswise, trimming their lengths to fit the pan as you go. Repeat with another 3 tablespoons marinara and 5 tablespoons ricotta filling, and then add the third layer of noodles lengthwise. Repeat once more time so you have 4 layers of noodles (alternating lengthwise and crosswise), then end with a fifth layer of noodles followed by 1 tablespoon olive oil and 2 tablespoons marinara spread evenly on top. (Any remaining sauce can be kept, covered and refrigerated, up to 4 days, or frozen up to 1 month.)\n\n6. Wrap top of lasagna with plastic wrap, ensuring entire lasagna is completely sealed. Place a second 13-by-18-inch baking sheet on top of the lasagna and add 8-12 pounds of weight to the pan to compress the lasagna. (Cans of soda, a pot of water or a small free weight will work well.) Refrigerate lasagna overnight.\n\n7. Trim the lasagna into bites: Remove lasagna from refrigerator. Remove top baking sheet and top layer of plastic wrap. Flip lasagna over onto a large cutting board and remove remaining plastic wrap. Use a sharp knife to trim about \u00bc inch from all four sides of lasagna, creating clean edges, and discard scraps. Cut lasagna into 1-inch squares. (It\u2019s important that all bites be about the same size when you fry them later.)\n\n8. Arrange lasagna bites in a single layer on a wire rack set over a rimmed baking sheet. (If the bites fall apart as you transfer them, press them back together with your fingers). Place tray of lasagna bites in freezer for at least 5 hours, or until they are frozen through and completely solid, up to overnight.\n\n9. Remove lasagna bites from freezer. Add flour to a large mixing bowl and toss frozen bites in flour to lightly coat on all sides, shaking off any excess flour before returning them to wire rack. (Reserve bowl with remaining flour.) Let bites stand on rack at room temperature 4 hours, until they thaw out completely and flour is absorbed into bites. Then return tray of bites to freezer for at least 5 more hours, or until they are frozen through and completely solid.\n\n10. Remove the lasagna bites from the freezer. Working quickly, toss frozen bites in reserved flour until they are lightly coated again. Shake off any excess flour and return bites to freezer. (The bites should be durable at this point and can be stored in a plastic container or plastic bag up to 5 days before frying.)\n\n11. Fry the lasagna bites: Warm remaining marinara sauce. Meanwhile, in a large pot, heat canola oil over medium-high heat until it reaches 350 degrees on a fry thermometer. Fry frozen lasagna bites 8 at a time until they puff up slightly and are golden brown, about 6\u00bd minutes. Use a slotted spoon or tongs to transfer fried bites to a wire rack to drain. Season with \u00bd teaspoon salt while hot. Repeat with remaining bites, making sure oil always returns to 350 degrees before adding the next batch. Whisk 1 tablespoon olive oil into marinara sauce and serve as a dipping sauce on the side.\n\n\u2014Recipes adapted from \u201cLasagna\u201d by Anna Hezel ( Clarkson Potter ).", "description": "These recipes defy the dogma of red sauce and ricotta.
