After banging down low in the post early on, Delle Donne\u2019s back had tightened up. She quietly left the floor and did not return.\n\nWithout their leading scorer, the Mystics fell 99-87 on Tuesday to the No.2 seed Connecticut Sun. The best-of-five series is now tied at one apiece and shifts to Mohegan Sun Arena on Sunday for Game 3.\n\nThe Mystics, even without Delle Donne, put up a fight. A 12-2 run in the third quarter began a rally that continued into the fourth quarter. The crowd at Entertainment and Sports Arena erupted when guard Kristi Toliver sank a layup to tie the game at 76 with 8:14 left in the game.\n\nBut the Mystics couldn\u2019t finish. Connecticut answered with a 6-0 run and the Mystics didn\u2019t have enough left to close the gap again after that.\n\nBesides missing Delle Donne\u2019s offensive contributions, the Mystics could have used her defense and her size.\n\nThe Sun shot 49.4% from the field and center Jonquel Jones led with a game-high 32 points. Jones, who had a quiet Game 1, was also a force on the boards, grabbing 18 rebounds \u2014 nine on the offensive end.\n\nThe Mystics struggled to get into a flow early. Drives to the basket were clogged by a swarming Sun defense. Shots clanked off the rim as Washington opened the game just 2-of-10 from the field.\n\nWith Delle Donne in the locker room, the Sun took advantage. The Mystics sagged off shooters and the Sun made them pay. By the end of the first, with Connecticut up 29-17, the Sun had shot 57.1% from the field \u2014 and 50% from deep.\n\nTo start the second, the Mystics looked more like themselves. Toliver sprinted down the floor, leading fast breaks. The ball zipped inside and out and shots started to fall. Without Delle Donne, Toliver and reserve forward Emma Meesseeman carried the offense. And with 6:32 left in the quarter, Tianna Hawkins drained a 3-pointer to cut Connecticut\u2019s lead to 34-31.\n\nBut the rally didn\u2019t last.\n\nWashington didn\u2019t have an answer for Jones. After holding her to just 12 points and six rebounds in Game 1, Connecticut\u2019s leading scorer erupted for 19 points and 10 rebounds in the first half alone. She bullied her way inside, nailing five of six shots in the second for 12 points. The Sun led 56-46 at halftime.\n\nThe Mystics, though, entered this season looking to redeem themselves after last year\u2019s finals sweep to the Seattle Storm. They had faced adversity and were determined to not let a 10-point halftime deficit stop them.\n\nWashington rallied in the third. Over a four-minute span, the Mystics stormed back \u2014 with an Aerial Powers layup cutting the lead to 71-69.\n\nBut by the end of the fourth, with their victory in hand, Jones dribbled out the clock and launched a 3-pointer as time was winding down. It went in \u2014 just one more thing that didn\u2019t go the Mystics\u2019 way.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
