The card doesn't offer the highest rewards rate among travel cards, but its benefits are tailored to those who want to earn Delta SkyMiles on every purchase and enjoy savings when traveling with Delta. If you find Delta convenient or just prefer it to other airlines, this card might be right for you.\n\nKeep in mind that we're focusing on the rewards and perks that make these credit cards great options, not things like interest rates and late fees, which can far outweigh the value of any rewards.\n\nWhen you're working to earn credit card rewards, it's important to practice financial discipline, like paying your balances off in full each month, making payments on time, and not spending more than you can afford to pay back. Basically, treat your credit card like a debit card.\n\nGold Delta SkyMiles Amex card details\n\nAnnual fee: $95 (waived the first year); $99 if application received on or after January 30, 2019\n\nWelcome bonus: 60,000 miles after you spend $2,000 in the first three months. Receive a $50 statement credit after you make a Delta purchase in the first three months. This welcome bonus is only available until October 30.\n\nMiles earning: 2 miles per dollar on Delta purchases, 1 mile per dollar on everything else (2x miles at US supermarkets and at restaurants starting on January 30, 2020)\n\nForeign transaction fee: None\n\nKeep in mind that we're focusing on the rewards and perks that make these credit cards great options, not things like interest rates and late fees, which can far outweigh the value of any rewards.\n\nWhen you're working to earn credit card rewards, it's important to practice financial discipline, like paying your balances off in full each month, making payments on time, and not spending more than you can afford to pay back. Basically, treat your credit card like a debit card.\n\nWelcome bonus\n\nWhile a rewards credit card will earn you bonus points, miles, or cash back on all your spending, the quickest way to get rewards is to earn a credit card welcome bonus.\n\nNew cardholders of the Gold Delta Amex get 60,000 bonus miles after $2,000 in purchases in the first three months after opening a new account. The Points Guy values Delta SkyMiles at 1.2 cents each, so 30,000 bonus miles is worth about $720 in travel. Keep in mind that this is a limited-time welcome bonus \u2014 you must apply by October 30.\n\nYou can also get a $50 statement credit after you make a Delta purchase in the first three months.\n\nMiles earning on the Gold Delta Amex\n\nAfter the welcome bonus, the next place to look with any rewards credit card is how it rewards your spending \u2014 what you get back every time you swipe, tap, dip, or pay online.\n\nFor purchases at Delta, this card gives you 2 miles per dollar. It offers 1 mile per dollar everywhere else. These rewards are great for loyal Delta travelers, but definitely not at the top for travel rewards cards with annual fees in the $100 range.\n\nHowever, Delta and Amex recently announced updates to their co-branded cards. Starting on January 30 2020, the Gold Delta Amex will earn 2x miles at US supermarkts and at restaurants as well as on Delta purchases. That will help make the card more competitive with other rewards credit cards.\n\nGold Delta Amex benefits\n\nWhen you look at the other benefits you get when traveling with Delta, more value emerges.\n\nPerks when you fly Delta\n\nCardholders get their first checked bag free, worth $30 each way. If you take two round-trip flights per year, this benefit alone pays for the card's annual fee.\n\nYou also get 20% back for any in-flight food, beverage, or headphone purchases. Cardholders get a discounted $29 per person entry rate to Delta Sky Club lounges (you can bring two guests). This benefit can be nice, but if you have the Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express don't forget that you get free Delta Sky Club access when you fly Delta. Also note that this benefit is being discontinued in 2020.\n\nOther travel benefits\n\nIn addition to benefits with Delta, the Gold Delta Amex card offers a handful of general travel benefits.\n\nThese include rental car loss and damage insurance, no foreign transaction fees, and a Global Assist hotline if you need emergency medical, legal, or financial services while away from home.\n\nThe rental car coverage is worth around $10 to $20 per day. If you rent a car for a week or so per year, you've covered the entire annual fee again.\n\nPurchase benefits and other perks\n\nThe benefits don't stop at travel. When you make a purchase with the card online or at the register, some additional benefits kick in. These include an automatic extended warranty, return protection, and new purchase protection. While we usually expect purchases to go right, having the added warranty, return, and purchase protections can be worth thousands of dollars if something goes sour.\n\nThe card also includes a free ShopRunner membership, which gives you free two-day shipping at over 100 online stores. You can also get access to ticket presales and member-only events. (I used an Amex presale to snag tickets to the Rolling Stones!)\n\nIs the Gold Delta Amex worth the annual fee?\n\nWhen looking at the rewards alone, it takes a lot of purchases to make up the $95 annual fee charged by the card. But when you add in benefits like a free checked bag, rental car insurance, purchase protection, and ShopRunner, it's easy to see how you can get a lot more in savings than the $95 per year the Gold Delta Amex charges.\n\nThis card is a winner for Delta frequent flyers. Even if it isn't your primary card for daily purchases, it could be a good supplement that makes its way out when you're ready to take off with Delta \u2014 and starting in 2020, it will be a solid choice for US supermarket and restaurant spending, as well. In either case, it's definitely worth considering for your spending and purchase needs.", "description": "The Gold Delta Amex offers perks that can improve your travel with the airline, including a free checked bag, 2x miles on Delta purchases, and more.", "authors": ["Eric Rosenberg"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d449f51100a241e0c29d663?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
