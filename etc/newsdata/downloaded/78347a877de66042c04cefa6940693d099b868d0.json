From 'consigliere' to Suncorp's Don", "language": "en", "text": "The question is whether Johnston, officially crowned chief executive last month, can help hurdle the company\u2019s obstacles with a refreshed strategy.\n\nIn his favour, the man who sleeps a maximum of five hours a night is regarded as a smart, seasoned operator. Once he was dubbed Suncorp\u2019s \u201cconsigliere\u201d, a term used for advisers to mafia Dons.\n\nBut questions also arise about his past operational experience and responsibility in the flawed execution of a Suncorp strategy.\n\nMergers and politics\n\nJohnston\u2019s ties to Suncorp stretch to the company\u2019s fusing of two lenders and a state-owned insurer in 1996. He was then Queensland premier Rob Borbidge\u2019s senior adviser and helped push through merger legislation.\n\n\u201cIt was tough,\u201d Johnston told The Australian Financial Review. \u201cYou [had] votes of no confidence in the creation of the enterprise, given the speculation of job losses and branch closures.\n\n\u201cYou had to balance out all the competing interests.\u201d\n\nThe company swelled in ensuing years, acquiring GIO and Promina, whose brands included AAMI. Then it faced global financial crisis terror as collapsing funding lines threatened financial institutions. Suncorp pulled through and by 2016, then CEO Michael Cameron unveiled a new strategy: \u201cMarketplace\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarketplace envisioned Suncorp as central to a digital finance zone \u2013 like an Amazon of finance-associated products. A customer, for instance, using Suncorp\u2019s app to look for a house might search for a loan, insurance and pest inspection services. Links to outside companies were offered.\n\nCameron\u2019s advocacy came with him warning Suncorp faced a potential extinction event akin to Kodak \u2013 the film stock and camera maker that missed the digital revolution \u2013 if it competed only on price for commoditised products.\n\nThe problem was some investors saw Marketplace as a reanimation of Suncorp\u2019s flawed cross-selling strategy of the 2000s. Insiders were confused, perceiving teams had different interpretations of the strategy.\n\nMeanwhile, cost-cutting was further aggravating employees. One staffer sued over his dismissal, with federal court documents obtained by the Financial Review alleging he was overloaded with work, and his own manager told him to \u201csuck it up\u201d and everyone was dealing with \u201cresource shortages\u201d.\n\nBut then Cameron resigned in May, with accounts stating he earned a $6.5 million pay packet that financial year, including $1.67 million in termination benefits. Also leaving in August was \u201ccustomer marketplace\u201d chief Pip Marlow, who earned $1.98 million in 2019.\n\nThe taboo word\n\nMarketplace is now disappearing from terminology \u2013 no one used the word in annual general meeting speeches last month.\n\nJohnston told the Financial Review that Suncorp had \u201clost sight\u201d of its core businesses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe narrative was too ambitious, and so the narrative became the strategy [but] the strategy was about digitising the business,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a digital strategy which goes across \u2026 the way we deliver existing products to customers, the creation of new products, and how we reduce [business] costs.\u201d\n\nSuncorp's board dances at its AGM during a traditional greeting. Attila Csaszar\n\nOne new focus is selling insurance via state-based marketing campaigns. Premium brands such as Suncorp will focus on Queensland and GIO in southern states, while AAMI targets the mass market.\n\nThe previous campaign had pushed the Suncorp brand nationally, but in southern states this \u201ccost a lot more than we had available to spend\u201d, Johnston said.\n\nStill, he said the strategy had worked with the bank. \u201cOur deposits \u2013 transactional banking \u2013 went up, simply because we were addressing a brand new customer base,\u201d he said.\n\nJohnston would not flag if premiums, for brands such as AAMI, would be cut to compete. But he added price was not the problem with converting customers.\n\nAnother step will be replicating, or \u201cre-skinning\u201d, Suncorp\u2019s app with other brands, such as daubing a version in red and AAMI livery. Johnston argued the app had best-in-class features, but it receives 3.1 stars out of five on Apple reviews and many posts this year slam the technology. \u201cUseless and unreliable,\u201d complained one critic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, Johnston said log-ins had reached almost 455,000 monthly in the past quarter. While that was below internal business projections from nine months ago, it was not materially off target, he argued.\n\nSo with Suncorp shifting focus from Marketplace, is it reverting towards a Kodak-style demise? \u201cI don\u2019t think there was ever a threat,\u201d Johnston countered. \u201cWe're not complacent about the future \u2026 the Kodak example is one of complacency.\u201d\n\nBouquets and brick bats\n\nJohnston maintained product innovation was central to success, achievable via Suncorp using digital technology and data.\n\nAn example he cited was flood insurance: Suncorp (except for AAMI) was the only big insurer with automatic flood cover before 2011. That year, deluges in Queensland\u2019s south-east caused more than $1.5 billion in damage, according to Insurance Council of Australia figures.\n\nThe reaction afterwards was astonishing. Customers hung hand-painted signs on fences thanking the insurer. Johnston recalled walking through swamped suburbs wearing Suncorp\u2019s green polo T-shirt. \u201cPeople were coming out of the streets, responding so positively,\u201d he said.\n\nThe reaction is not always so welcoming. Suncorp copped a bruising at the financial services royal commission \u2013 with one focus on AAMI customers upset about Victorian bushfire payments. Subsequent increased regulatory costs and remediation has seen Suncorp now set aside $155 million.\n\nInternally, the company wants to embed a cost-saving focus, rather than engage on big projects. Cutbacks recently have been hard \u2013 Suncorp staff numbers fell 6 per cent since 2015 to 13,040, according to company accounts, and employee-initiated turnover was high at 14.2 per cent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohnston said he thought morale was \u201cOK\u201d but stressed the company must clearly communicate any issues to staff.\n\nIt will take more than clear communication to rebuild momentum. Credit Suisse analysts last week branded Suncorp an \u201cunderperform\u201d, saying the company could review earnings targets in coming months, including ambitions of return on equity hitting 10 per cent. It was 8.4 per cent last year.\n\n\u201cThe current targets are unlikely to be achieved in coming years, in our view, unless Suncorp unwinds the work of previous years and takes on more risk again,\u201d the analysts said.\n\nFormer Suncorp CEO John Mulcahy says Johnston is a top strategic thinker. Peter Braig\n\nChanges are under way, such as returning control of stores and distribution back to banking and insurance lines. It is a move back to core operations, a theme receiving backing. \u201cIt should \u2026 lead to a sharper focus, potentially enabling the company to overcome some of its recent growth difficulties, with mortgage growth sluggish and motor and home [policy numbers] falling,\u201d Citigroup analysts wrote after full-year results.\n\nThose results saw Suncorp\u2019s cash-profits rise 1.5 per cent at $1.115 billion.\n\nThe profits were the first with Johnston in control and his ascension was generally well received.\n\nJohn Mulcahy, Suncorp\u2019s chief executive between 2003 and 2009, described Johnston as a good selection. \"He's smart ... understands the business,\" Mulcahy told the Financial Review. \"I found him one of the most strategic and clear thinkers.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother who has worked with Johnston said: \u201cHe observes and he recognises and he understands.\"\n\nJohnston has lived in Brisbane all his life, albeit having travelled frequently. His parents owned and ran a petrol station and he attended Mansfield State High in the city\u2019s south-east.\n\nFormer Suncorp chief Patrick Snowball once dubbed Johnston the company's \u201cconsigliere\u201d. Louie Douvis\n\nNow his job will potentially pay $5.4 million, including bonuses. That cash will add to property and company searches listing his home as a modest eastern waterfront property bought for $820,000 in 2002, while his family also owns a $1.7 million inner-city home and a $1.2 million apartment on the Gold Coast.\n\nJohnston, 53, who has two adult children, holidays there when the apartment is not rented out. He also enjoys watching rugby league, playing tennis and running, although lately does not \u201cget much time\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s the apex of a diverse career from policy adviser to managing Telstra's government and investor relations. He started at Suncorp in 2006, initially in similar relations positions, and was part of critical moments including Suncorp's GFC tremors when the banking arm was nearly sold. His last position was chief financial officer. His knowledge was such that Patrick Snowball, Suncorp chief executive from 2009 to 2015, once dubbed Johnston its \u201cconsigliere\u201d.\n\nOperational experience\n\nBut some issues gnaw: one is how Johnston can oversee the financial conglomerate having never been a traditional insurer or banker himself. He countered that in almost 14 years he had been \u201cat the coal face\u201d of Suncorp\u2019s big decisions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYes, I haven\u2019t run a contact centre with 1500-2000 people. But I ran the finance team with 750 and that\u2019s a complex organisation in and of itself that has to deliver a pile of material,\u201d Johnston said.\n\nOne critic also questioned how Johnston had stood for years as Cameron\u2019s right-hand man, now only to attack the past strategy.\n\nJohnston admitted he bore responsibility. \u201cI've never shirked any responsibility I had for any performance of the company. I didn\u2019t seek to in front of the board, when I talked to the board about being a candidate \u2026 I fronted into that issue,\u201d he said.\n\nSuncorp chairwoman Christine McLoughlin expressed confidence in the Marketplace strategy. Attila Csaszar\n\nIt is a similar question for Christine McLoughlin, who on becoming Suncorp chairwoman last year said she was \u201cpleased\u201d with Marketplace's progress.\n\n\u201cThe investment that we made in the functionality of the Marketplace is now enabling us to get on with doing what we\u2019re doing in our insurance and banking businesses,\u201d McLoughlin told the Financial Review. \u201cWhat we didn\u2019t do well was communicate what we were doing.\u201d\n\nNow the company has breathing room to communicate a new strategy. Investors will hope this one lasts. Successfully. Like a Wiggles song.", "description": "Steve Johnston has seen bruising parliamentary battles and knows Suncorp's skeletons.
