Money managers raised their net long U.S. crude futures and\n\noptions positions by 11,209 contracts to 220,758 in the week to\n\nSept. 17, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)\n\nsaid. The oil market jumped nearly 20% on Monday in reaction to\n\nthe Sept. 14 attack, which halved Saudi production and cut\n\nglobal supplies by about 5%. But prices have since pared most of\n\nthose gains on assurances from the kingdom that it would restore\n\nlost production by the end of this month. Prices, however, have kept a risk premium as geopolitical\n\ntensions in the region have escalated with the United States and\n\nSaudi Arabia blaming the attack on Iran. Tehran denies any\n\ninvolvement.\n\nThe attack has intensified a years-long struggle between\n\nSaudi Arabia and Iran, who are locked in a sometimes violent\n\ncontest for influence in several flashpoints around the Middle\n\nEast.\n\nA Saudi-led coalition on Friday launched a military\n\noperation north of Yemen's port city of Hodeidah while the\n\nUnited States worked with Middle East and European nations to\n\nbuild a coalition to deter Iranian threats. State-owned Saudi Aramco has switched crude grades and\n\ndelayed crude and oil product deliveries to customers by days\n\nafter the attack severely reduced its light oil production and\n\nled to output cuts at its refineries, market sources said.\n\nWhilst showing reporters the damaged the Khurais field and\n\nthe Abqaiq oil processing facility, Aramco said it was shipping\n\nequipment from the United States and Europe to rebuild the\n\ndamaged facilities. It also said that Abqaiq is expected to have\n\nfull capacity restored by the end of the month. \"The question is can they convince the market that they can\n\nkeep their oil fields safe,\" said Phil Flynn, an analyst at\n\nPrice Futures Group in Chicago, in a note.\n\nIn the United States, meanwhile, flooding from Tropical\n\nStorm Imelda forced a major refinery to cut production, while a\n\nkey oil pipeline, terminals and a ship channel in Texas were\n\nshut, according to sources familiar with operations.\n\nExxon Mobil Corp XOM.N shut some units at its 369,024\n\nbarrel per day (bpd) Beaumont refinery while Valero Energy Corp\n\nVLO.N reduced production at its 335,000 bpd Port Arthur\n\nrefinery.\n\nU.S. energy firms this week reduced the number of oil rigs\n\noperating for a fifth week in a row to the lowest since May\n\n2017. Drillers cut 14 oil rigs in the week to Sept. 20, bringing\n\nthe total count down to 719, General Electric Co's GE.N Baker\n\nHughes energy services firm said.
