However, it was later revealed that this sister they were so desperately searching for was none other than Ash.\n\nKheerat, Jags and Vinny split up to look for their sibling, and \u2014 after recognising Habiba (Rukku Nahar) from Ash\u2019s social media, it was Vinny that managed to locate Ash\u2014 much to her dismay.\n\nFaced with no other choice but to confront her past, Ash took Vinny to the park for a catch-up, and \u2014 via their conversation \u2014 it was revealed that the family had been incredibly tough on Ash four years earlier \u2014 which is the reason why she cut all contact with them.\n\nOn Ash\u2019s decision to keep her family at arm\u2019s length, actress Gurlaine Kaur Garcha said: \u2018Ash knows her family aren\u2019t going to approve of Iqra so is trying to protect her relationship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe\u2019s come away from her family and is living on her own but knows when her brothers are involved, all her independence goes so she\u2019s desperately trying to keep in control. She\u2019s also trying to make Iqra understand without actually saying what the issue is.\u2019\n\nBefore departing, Vinny informed Ash that their mum is dying of cancer \u2014 which is why they\u2019re so desperate to get the family back together \u2014but Ash refused to come home, so Vinny respected her wishes and thus lied to his brothers about being unable to find her.\n\nWhile the Panesar brothers seemingly took yet another leave of absence from the Square, this is only just the beginning of what promises to be yet another thrilling EastEnders storyline.\n\nSpeaking about what\u2019s to come for the clan, Gurlaine said: \u2018I am so excited, there is definitely going to be some shocks along the way. The Panesars are exactly what a normal Punjabi family is like! Viewers are going to be glued to their screen and there is definitely going to be some \u2018doof doofs\u2019!\n\nRegardless of what Ash said, it\u2019s pretty clear that she\u2019s conflicted over what to do for the best \u2014 and remains uncertain of how much to tell Iqra about her family.\n\nSpeaking of Iqra, it seems as if there\u2019s plenty more to come for the pair, as Gurlaine teased: \u2018I think it will be a bit of a rollercoaster. I definitely think it\u2019s going to be exciting and interesting to see how Ash handles her brothers meeting Iqra for the first time. I really hope it\u2019s a happy ending for them and they\u2019re together forever \u2013 but it is EastEnders after all!\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEastEnders continues Thursday 31stOctober at 7:30pm on BBC One.\n\nMORE: EastEnders spoilers: Mel Owen exposes Sharon Mitchell and Keanu Taylor\u2019s secret publicly?\n\nMORE: 12 soap spoiler pictures: EastEnders engagement, Coronation Street feud, Emmerdale betrayal, Hollyoaks revenge\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "There's plenty more to come for Ash \u2014 and the Panesars \u2014 after tonight's shocking reveal.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/The-Panesars-f278_1572367176.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
