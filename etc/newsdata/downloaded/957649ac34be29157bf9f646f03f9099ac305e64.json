When President Richard Nixon misused the CIA to try to squelch an investigation into the Watergate break-in, some members of Congress and others didn\u2019t think he should be impeached or removed for it\u2014but virtually no one argued that his conduct was \u201ctotally appropriate,\u201d a \u201cnothing burger,\u201d or consistent with the president\u2019s constitutional duties. Likewise, when President Bill Clinton lied under oath about his conduct with Monica Lewinsky, many people thought it wasn\u2019t the stuff of impeachment, let alone removal, and some people went so far as to sympathize with the president or to argue that his conduct didn\u2019t meet the definition of perjury. But virtually no one argued that actual deliberate falsehoods under oath would have been proper.\n\nYet that\u2019s effectively where we find ourselves now\u2014confronted with a president, and some of his defenders, who would insist that abuses of presidential authority are unexceptional or, worse still, consistent with the president\u2019s constitutional oath and duty.\n\nIn the long run, this defense of Trump\u2019s Ukraine machinations may well prove more corrosive than what occurred in the July 25 conversation itself. The president, after all, continues to serve in office and\u2014as the phone call with the Australian prime minister demonstrates\u2014is likely to continue to engage in further self-serving activity with foreign dignitaries as the election approaches. More upsetting still, we\u2019re perilously close to the point at which there may no longer be a national consensus that there\u2019s anything constitutionally problematic about using governmental powers to advance one\u2019s own pecuniary and electoral interests.", "description": "", "authors": ["Lederman", "Theatlantic.Com Ideas Archive Condemn-Trump-Before-His-Misconduct-Becomes-Norm"], "top_image": ""}
