It\u2019s a keyboard case with a laptop-style design, similar to the Brydge model I tested a while back, but there\u2019s a big difference: this one has a trackpad.\n\nIn case you weren\u2019t aware, iPadOS has rudimentary mouse support. It\u2019s not very refined and it\u2019s buried deep in accessibility settings, but it\u2019s there. Until now, though, making using of it has required either an external mouse or this weird touch-sensitive keyboard I tried a few months ago. The Libra is the first solution I\u2019m aware of that gives you a laptop-style trackpad.\n\nI do a lot of writing on my iPad Pro, and the constant need to reach up to the screen when editing text is probably my biggest complaint about the device. It feels much more natural to be able to keep your hands in the same position when typing and editing. What Steve Jobs said about touchscreen laptops is actually more true of the iPad Pro than any Windows alternative, because at least those let you use a trackpad as well.\n\nSo, how good a job does the Libra do? Actually, better than I expected. The trackpad isn\u2019t anywhere near as good as what you\u2019d get on a MacBook, of course. It\u2019s smaller, for one thing, and doesn\u2019t let you click from everywhere on its surface. But its performance is surprisingly solid. I\u2019ve used many, many worse trackpads on computers running operating systems that are designed for them.\n\nThe Libra trackpad has limited gesture support. You can swipe down with two fingers to scroll, while a three-finger swipe returns you to the home screen, which I found pretty useful. The Libra\u2019s makers, Sentis, say they\u2019re working on more gestures like pinch to zoom, but it doesn\u2019t work right now and it\u2019s unclear how it would be supported in iPadOS.\n\nFor me, what matters most is that the trackpad works well for pointing the cursor and dragging to select text \u2014 and it does. The Libra does take a little getting used to, to be sure, and it\u2019s clear that iPadOS isn\u2019t intended to be used this way all the time. The cursor returns to the center of the display whenever you go back to the home screen, for example, while the slightest brush of the trackpad counts as a tap, which can cause some unexpected inputs. But within the narrow context of writing and text editing, I do enjoy using the Libra. It certainly beats reaching up to touch the screen.\n\nThe keyboard itself isn\u2019t spectacular, and the keys are a little small \u2014 the width is fine, but I feel like the caps could\u2019ve used an extra millimeter or two in vertical height. The RGB backlighting is also dim and uneven. It\u2019s not a bad experience, though, and I imagine most people would prefer the keyfeel to that of Apple\u2019s current MacBook lineup. The metal body feels reasonably sturdy, with a MacBook Air-style wedge-shaped design and \u201cspace gray\u201d finish that\u2019s a good match for Apple\u2019s.\n\nA note on crowdfunding: Crowdfunding is a chaotic field by nature: companies looking for funding tend to make big promises. According to a study run by Kickstarter in 2015, roughly 1 in 10 \u201csuccessful\u201d products that reach their funding goals fail to actually deliver rewards. Of the ones that do deliver, delays, missed deadlines, or overpromised ideas mean that there\u2019s often disappointment in store for those products that do get done. The best defense is to use your best judgment. Ask yourself: does the product look legitimate? Is the company making outlandish claims? Is there a working prototype? Does the company mention existing plans to manufacture and ship finished products? Has it completed a Kickstarter before? And remember: you\u2019re not necessarily buying a product when you back it on a crowdfunding site.\n\nMy favorite unexpected feature of the Libra is that it has not one but two USB-C ports \u2014 one for charging the keyboard and another for charging other devices. The 4,000mAh battery should be good for up to 200 days of battery life, so you can plug your phone in for a charge in a pinch. You can also do that from the iPad itself, of course, but it\u2019s a nice option to have if you\u2019re trying to conserve power on the tablet.\n\nThere are a couple of problems with the Libra that I\u2019d hope to see fixed before it goes to final manufacturing. The keyboard uses similar hinges to the Brydge, but they\u2019re not as good \u2014 they don\u2019t grip the iPad tightly enough, so it can slide out pretty easily. I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable tossing the combination in a bag like I would a laptop.\n\nI also don\u2019t think the 120-degree opening angle is wide enough \u2014 it\u2019s hard for me to see the Libra screen when using the Libra on my lap. The situation is better with a desk, and I\u2019m 6-feet 4-inches tall so it\u2019s probably less of a problem for most people, but you\u2019d expect a laptop-style keyboard to be better suited for lap use. Again, it\u2019s not a problem with the Brydge, which opens up to 180 degrees.\n\nThe Libra does have a unique selling point, though, and it\u2019s one that works better than I thought it would. If you\u2019re a writer, the trackpad makes a big difference to iPad productivity, and I hope to see a more polished version of this product \u2014 from Sentis, Brydge, or whoever \u2014 down the line. In the meantime, the Libra is currently crowdfunding on Kickstarter and is available from $109, with shipping expected to begin in January.", "description": "The Libra is an iPad Pro keyboard currently crowdfunding on Kickstarter with a unique selling point \u2014 a laptop-style trackpad.", "authors": ["Sam Byford", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fsLNfoaQ5kSp7ukzfd5_CVIK5XE=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19272003/DSCF7154.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
