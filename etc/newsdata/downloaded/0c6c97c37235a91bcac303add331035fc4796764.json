Joe Biden DID NOT.\n\n\u201cIn fact,\u201d Lewis adds, \u201cmy family was not allowed on Air Force One because we refused to support Obama/Biden gun control efforts.\u201d\n\nBiden addressed Sandy Hook family members June 15, 2016, CBS News reported, but it was unclear whether all families were represented.\n\nIn another post, Lewis reminds his followers of another instance in which Biden got his facts wrong regarding a school shooting.\n\nHe refers to an incident from August of this year, when Biden claimed to have been vice president at the time of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Fla., that left 17 people dead.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBut the Parkland shooting happened in February 2018, more than a year after Biden had left the vice presidency.\n\n\u201c@JoeBiden is either a liar or he\u2019s losing his mind,\u201d Lewis concludes.\n\nGaffes have been one area of concern for the Biden campaign, which has been losing momentum in recent weeks. Other topics that have some supporters worried include increased scrutiny of Ukraine business dealings that involved Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden.\n\nA recent poll in the early primary state of South Carolina shows both Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders gaining support in the Palmetto State since July, while Biden has lost support over the same period.", "description": "In a campaign video, Joe Biden claims he met with all families affected by the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting in Connecticut.", "authors": ["Dom Calicchio"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/17/694940094001_6095517179001_6095513885001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
