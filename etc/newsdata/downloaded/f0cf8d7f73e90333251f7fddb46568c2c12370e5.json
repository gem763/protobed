Bolton didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nBolton also said more than once that Trump\u2019s failure to respond to the Iranian attack on an American drone earlier this summer set the stage for the Islamic Republic\u2019s aggression in recent months.\n\nAt one point, Bolton, a previous chairman of Gatestone, suggested that had the U.S. retaliated for the drone shootdown, Iran might not have damaged the Saudi oil fields.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

O\u2019Brien.\n\nSpeaking on an airport tarmac in Los Angeles, Trump introduced his new top foreign policy aide as \u201chighly respected\u201d and hailed their \u201cgood chemistry.\u201d The remarks indicated that in O\u2019Brien, Trump sees a more compatible adviser than Bolton, whose disagreements with the president and clashes with other senior officials often spilled into public view.\n\nAfter the attack in June, Trump was poised to launch a military response against the Iranians -- strongly urged by Bolton -- but pulled back after Fox News host Tucker Carlson and others warned him that it was a bad idea.\n\nDuring Wednesday\u2019s luncheon, Bolton said the planned response had gone through the full process and everybody in the White House had agreed on the retaliatory strike.\n\nBut \u201ca high authority, at the very last minute,\" without telling anyone, decided not to do it, Bolton complained.\n\nBolton spoke to around 60 Gatestone donors at the exclusive restaurant Le Bernardin in Manhattan. Attendees included noted lawyer Alan Dershowitz and his wife Carolyn, former attorney general Michael Mukasey, Newsmax CEO Chris Ruddy, First Amendment lawyer Floyd Abrams, former Fox News host John Stossel, former New York Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey and New York billionaire John Catsimadis.\n\nBillionaire Rebekah Mercer introduced Bolton as \u201cthe best national security adviser our country could have hoped for,\u201d garnering her very loud applause. Bolton had been scheduled to speak to the group before Trump fired him.\n\nIn his talk and the Q&A session that followed, Bolton took attendees through a number of global issues.\n\nOn Afghanistan, another frequent subject of disagreement with the president, Bolton said that the U.S. should not have pursued a peace deal with the Taliban.\n\nInstead, he said, the U.S. should keep 8,600 troops in Afghanistan with intelligence support and other support elements. He called the proposed deal that was on the table similar to the agreement the Taliban offered the U.S. after 9/11, but said \u201cit doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d\n\nMore than once, Bolton said, Israel would \u201csooner or later\u201d see a new government, even though he personally liked Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nOn Venezuela, a focus of his short White House tenure, Bolton claimed there were 20,000 to 25,000 Cuban troops in the South American country. The day they left, he predicted, the Nicholas Maduro regime would fall by midnight.\n\nHe also said that if British Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn were to become prime minister, it would be \u201cfatal to the special relationship\u201d between the U.S. and Britain.\n\nDuring the Q&A session, Dershowitz told the crowd that it was \u201ca national disaster\u201d that Bolton had been booted from the White House, to what the attendee described as \u201cthunderous applause.\u201d\n\n", "description": "The recently fired national security made little secret of his disagreements with the president.", "authors": ["Daniel Lippman"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/2d/8c/6ec16ba843068d972506b1b52b4a/190910-john-bolton-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
