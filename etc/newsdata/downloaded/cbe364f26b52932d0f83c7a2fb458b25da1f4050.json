It cut the estimated value of that holding well before WeWork postponed its IPO plans on September 17, suggesting it was having doubts.\n\nAhead of its flotation, investors balked at WeWork's business model, valuation, complex structure, questionable governance, and the behavior of cofounder and CEO Adam Neumann. The concerns meant WeWork was looking at a public valuation below $20 billion \u2014 a sharp drop from the $47 billion private valuation it secured in January \u2014 which risked it raising less than the $3 billion necessary to secure $6 billion in bank financing.\n\nFollowing its IPO failure, WeWork has replaced CEO Adam Neumann with two co-CEOs and taken steps to revamp its corporate structure, improve its governance, and staunch its surging losses.\n\nThe WeWork writedown fueled a pre-tax loss of $43 million in Jefferies' merchant banking division, a big swing from its pre-tax income of $219 million in the third quarter of 2018. Strong showings from its investment banking and sales and trading segments failed to offset the damage, meaning overall net income slumped by nearly 75% to $48.5 million.", "description": "\"As the facts at We become clearer, further adjustments may be made in future periods,\" the investment bank said.", "authors": ["Theron Mohamed"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8e08be2e22af163f1cb3ff?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
