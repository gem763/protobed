A lot.\n\nAccording to Axios, Obama said at a tech conference that when he was president, he relied on a diversity of opinions before making decisions.\n\n\u201cThe other thing that is helpful is not watching TV or reading social media,\u201d he was quoted as saying.\n\n\u201cThose are two things I would advise, if you\u2019re our president, not to do,\u201d he added, per the Washington Post. \u201cIt creates a lot of noise and clouds your judgment.\u201d\n\nObama didn\u2019t mention Trump by name, and at least one former Obama insider insisted that this wasn\u2019t a shot at the current POTUS. Former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau tweeted:\n\nI really doubt this was a swipe. Obama said this kinda thing about not watching TV and being on social media hundreds of times, publicly, before Trump was even a candidate for president. https://t.co/MOwROcLfDp \u2014 Jon Favreau (@jonfavs) September 18, 2019\n\nWhile that may be the case, Obama would certainly be aware of how the comments could be taken in light of the Trump presidency.\n\nObama made another statement that could also be interpreted as a swipe at his successor.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of the fact we didn\u2019t have indictments,\u201d Obama said. \u201cI\u2019ve said that before, but that is pretty rare in modern-day.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cmodern-day\u201d occupant of the White House has surrounded himself with aides and associates who are now in legal trouble. Former campaign manager Paul Manafort and former personal attorney Michael Cohen are currently serving prison time. Former campaign adviser George Papadopoulos served a 12-day sentence. Former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn is awaiting sentencing. And longtime aide Roger Stone is charged with lying to Congress in a trial set to begin in November.\n\nAlso on HuffPost\n\nStudents Listening To Obama\n\nMore\n\nObama Throws Up \"The U\"\n\nMore\n\nAnother Shot Of Obama Throwing \"The U\"\n\nMore", "description": "And Trump does both.
