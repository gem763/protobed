Anthony Gonzalez is a former NFL receiver for the Indianapolis Colts who played college football at Ohio State. He was elected to the House last year.\n\nThis news follows California Gov. Gavin Newsom signing into law the Fair Pay to Play Act, the first law in the country designed to stop colleges and universities from preventing college athletes from profiting off their names, images and likenesses. Several states are reportedly considering measures similar to California\u2019s.\n\nThe NCAA opposes laws like the Fair Pay to Play Act, with president Mark Emmert saying it poses an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to their amateurism model in college sports.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s law won\u2019t take effect until 2023. Gonzalez told ESPN it\u2019s better to move even faster.\n\n\u201cI actually think that we need to do something quickly, within the next year,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cI don\u2019t think you have three years to figure this out. I think decisions will start happening immediately.\u201d\n\nLaws like this do not address whether NCAA or member institutions should pay college athletes like employees, only whether they can profit from things like jersey sales or signing autographs.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
