Credit: Steven Bisig-USA TODAY Sports\n\nFirst in Los Angeles, the Rams listed running back Todd Gurley as doubtful to play in Sunday\u2019s NFC West showdown against the San Francisco 49ers at the LA Memorial Coliseum. Gurley did not practice at all this week due to a left thigh contusion, and he has been limited in his touches all season because of lingering knee issues.\n\nRunning back Malcolm Brown likely will receive the bulk of the snaps should Gurley sit out, and rookie Darrell Henderson could be in line for an increased workload. Starting cornerback Aqib Talib is also out because of injured ribs.\n\nIn New Orleans, running back Alvin Kamara did not practice and was listed as questionable for his team\u2019s game Sunday in Jacksonville.\n\nNFL Network\u2019s Tom Pelissero reported the team believes Kamara\u2019s ankle injury is \u201cnot a major injury and (Kamara) sat out practice as a precaution, but that\u2019ll be one to watch.\u201d\n\nAccording to reports, Saints head coach Sean Payton did not address any specifics of Kamara\u2019s injury.\n\nMore injury updates\n\n\u2014Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Tyreek Hill will be a game-time decision Sunday, coach Andy Reid told reporters. Hill has missed the past four games after suffering the injury in the season opener.\n\nHill was scheduled to have medical tests \u2014 including a bone scan \u2014 on his injured clavicle, Ian Rapoport of NFL Network reported.\n\n\u2014The Pittsburgh Steelers officially ruled quarterback Mason Rudolph out for Sunday night\u2019s game against the Los Angeles Chargers, less than a week after he was knocked unconscious by a hit against the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nEarlier on Friday, Ravens safety Earl Thomas told ESPN he was fined $21,000 by the NFL for his hit on Rudolph.\n\nThe club also activated quarterback Paxton Lynch to back up Devlin Hodges \u2014 the Steelers\u2019 third starting quarterback this season \u2014 and running back Trey Edmunds from the practice squad.\n\n\u2014Packers wide receiver Davante Adams might not play Monday \u2014 and isn\u2019t certain when he will be ready to return from a turf toe injury he described as \u201cserious.\u201d\n\nAdams sustained the toe injury in the fourth quarter against Philadelphia in Week 4 and sat out the Packers\u2019 Week 5 win over the Dallas Cowboys.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t really tell you when I\u2019m going to play,\u201d Adams told the Packers\u2019 official website. \u201cI know it doesn\u2019t feel how I want it to feel at the moment, but we definitely have time.\u201d\n\n\u2014Ravens rookie wide receiver Marquise Brown and inside linebacker Patrick Onwuasor \u2014 both dealing with ankle injuries \u2014 will be game-time decisions for this weekend\u2019s game against the Cincinnati Bengals, coach John Harbaugh announced.\n\n\u2014The New England Patriots will place fullback Jakob Johnson on injured reserve with a shoulder injury suffered Thursday night, the Boston Globe reported. He had no carries and one catch for five yards this season.\n\nQuarterback news & notes\n\n\u2014Washington will start Case Keenum at quarterback against the Miami Dolphins, interim coach Bill Callahan announced. Rookie Dwayne Haskins will serve as the backup, and Week 5 starter Colt McCoy likely will be inactive.\n\n\u2014Jets quarterback Sam Darnold will reportedly take the field against the Cowboys on Sunday sporting special pads designed to provide extra protection to his spleen. He has been out since Week 2 with mononucleosis, a condition that can enlarge an infected person\u2019s spleen.\n\n\u2014Andrew Luck spent part of Thursday at the Indianapolis Colt\u2019s facility with new starting quarterback Jacoby Brissett, two months after he announced his retirement from football. Brissett said recently the two text constantly, and Luck reportedly also keeps close contact with former teammates T.Y. Hilton, Anthony Castonzo and Eric Ebron.\n\n\u2014Two days before he faces former teammate Kirk Cousins, Eagles linebacker Zach Brown reportedly called his ex-quarterback \u201cthe weakest part of (Minnesota\u2019s) offense.\u201d He added, \u201cThey\u2019ve got a good running game, probably one of the best in the league. They have real good receivers. You just want them to pass the ball. You want Kirk Cousins to get it in his hands.\u201d\n\nAround the league\n\n\u2014Denver fullback Andy Janovich signed a three-year contract extension through the 2022 season. The deal is reportedly worth $5.7 million with a $1.35 million signing bonus and total guarantees of $3.22 million.\n\n\u2014The NFL moved the Houston Texans\u2019 Week 8 home game against the Oakland Raiders on Oct. 27 from the 1 p.m. ET slot to a 4:25 p.m. ET kickoff. The Colts\u2019 home game against Denver that same day was bumped up from 4:25 p.m. ET to 1 p.m.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "As NFL teams released their final injury reports on Friday, a pair of names in particular raised some eyebrows -- one for his game status and the other for being on the injury report at all.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191012&t=2&i=1439904292&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9B029-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
