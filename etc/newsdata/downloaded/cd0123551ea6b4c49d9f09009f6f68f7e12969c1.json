Gee, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, rejected another Trump administration attempt last year to alter the settlement agreement.\n\nA Justice Department spokesperson said in a written statement that the department was \u201cdisappointed\u201c with the outcome.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration will continue to work to restore integrity to our immigration system and ensure the proper functioning of the duly enacted immigration laws,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump officials have argued the 20-day detention limit \u2014 applied to migrant families by Gee in 2015 \u2014 has encouraged Central American parents to trek north with their children. Border Patrol arrested a record number of migrant families in the spring, although traffic has subsided in recent months.\n\nPeter Schey, an attorney representing plaintiffs in a related lawsuit, said it was clear that the new Trump detention regulations would not fulfill the terms of the Flores agreement.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump would fire the whole team of lawyers at DHS if they came up with regulations that were consistent with the settlement,\u201d Schey said. \u201cHe wants to detain children indefinitely.\u201d\n\nThe court setback means the administration will continue to be bound by the 20-day limit on family detention, pending the outcome of any possible appeal.\n\nOne point of contention in Friday\u2019s ruling was a Trump administration attempt to allow Immigration and Customs Enforcement to create its own licensing scheme for family detention centers. The Flores agreement requires the centers to be state-licensed.\n\nGee said placing children in ICE residential centers would be \u201cpatently inconsistent\u201c with the agreement and not adequately allow for monitoring by an independent child welfare agency.\n\nShe also blasted the regulation\u2019s characterization of existing family detention centers as \u201cnon-secure\u201d facilities that would permit lengthy detentions of children with their parents.\n\n\u201cIn Kafkaesque fashion,\u201c she wrote, \u201cthe new regulations declare that [family residential centers] are non-secure (and always have been), regardless of whether they are or ever have been, in fact, non-secure.\u201d\n\nWhile the ruling could hinder Trump administration efforts to step up enforcement against migrant families, DHS continues to implement a range of actions to discourage traffic to the southwest border.\n\nActing Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan said this week that immigration authorities would stop releasing most migrant families caught at the border into the interior of the U.S., ending what Trump has called \u201ccatch and release.\u201d Instead, McAleenan said the families would be processed for rapid removal or sent to Mexico if they have requested asylum.\n\nIn recent months and weeks, the Trump administration also has brokered asylum deals with Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras that would require those countries to accept asylum seekers who pass through their territory en route to the U.S. Each of those agreements requires additional steps before taking effect.\n\nEarlier this month, the Supreme Court allowed the administration to implement a sweeping ban on asylum seekers who transit through another country on their way to the U.S. if they failed to request protection in that place.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/e3/13/271c902848febba3a3c9dbca867c/19719-detention-center-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
