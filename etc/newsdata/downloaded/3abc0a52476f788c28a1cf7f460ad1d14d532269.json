And though Mary \u00adElizabeth Winstead\u2019s sardonic spirit and action ability is mostly wasted, she does enough to suggest great things will happen when she pops up as Batman super-villain Huntress in next year\u2019s Birds of Prey.\n\nThis film first conceived more than 20 years ago in the manner of glossy and violent over-the-top thrillers such as Sean Connery\u2019s The Rock, who at the time was in consideration to star in this.\n\nBut all the good stuff has been toned down in an attempt to appeal to the broadest possible 21st-century audience, leaving the movie neutered and uncertain of its identity.\n\n*Gemini Man will be released on 11 October 2019", "description": "Will Smith plays a clone of his younger self in this 'neutered' action thriller", "authors": ["Chris Hunneysett", "Image", "Paramount Films"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20553088.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Gemini-Man.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
