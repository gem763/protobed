(There is also one decidedly not-excellent sweater.) At last week\u2019s premiere of The Great Society, the Robert Schenkkan play in which Brian Cox stars as LBJ, Vulture caught two of Cox\u2019s Succession co-stars and asked them about the show\u2019s sartorial choices. First up was Arian Moayed, who said he was very pro-Vulture\u2019s sweater ranking, and conceded that Shiv has had a lot of good sweaters in season two. Moayed\u2019s favorite, though, was of course his character Stewy\u2019s \u201cArgestes\u201d white turtleneck: \u201cThe turtleneck is amazing. There\u2019s two things I want to say about the turtleneck: The moment I put it on, I was like, He is wearing this. It was audacious and so thick. And then they\u2019re like, \u2018What about this suede jacket over it? What about this?\u2019 I loved it the moment I put it on,\u201d he said. \u201cThe second thing is, Matthew McFadyen [who plays Tom] told me, \u2018You should definitely try to get that sweater and that suede jacket.\u2019 I didn\u2019t listen to him. Who knows! It\u2019s in a storage room somewhere. That was a real poor decision on my part.\u201d\n\nPeter Friedman, who plays the Logan\u2019s erudite adviser Frank, lamented that he hasn\u2019t gotten any great sweaters this season. \u201cJust wait,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s one more. In the tenth episode, they put me in this cute little double-breasted blue guy \u2026 that we leave open for some reason.\u201d I would like to see it!", "description": "At last week\u2019s premiere of The Great Society, the Robert Schenkkan play in which Brian Cox stars as LBJ, Vulture caught two of Cox\u2019s Succession co-stars and asked them about the show\u2019s sartorial choices.", "authors": ["Hunter Harris"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/02/02-arian-moayed-peter-friedman.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
