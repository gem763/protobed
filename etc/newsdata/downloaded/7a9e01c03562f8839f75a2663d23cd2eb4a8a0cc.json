Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., faced an especially hot glare getting her first taste of what it really means to be a front-runner.\n\nShe faced sharp questions from the moderators -- and from rivals -- fending off attacks about how she would pay for \"Medicare for All\", her wealth tax and, generally, the infrastructure of her plan-heavy brand. Many of the remaining 2020 Democrats accused her of being \"evasive\" on some of the core points that buttress the narrative of her candidacy and her origin story.\n\nCenter stage and in her rivals' crosshairs, Warren met their salvos.\n\nPHOTO: DemoDemocratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren speaks during the fourth Democratic primary debate at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, Oct. 15, 2019. (John Minchillo/AP) More\n\nAnd while the sometimes fiery exchanges highlighted salient questions about her policy prescriptions, experts noted, and polling indicates, a deeper undercurrent to the conversation -- and caveats to her ascendant star.\n\n\"We are accustomed to seeing a particular model of what it looks like to be a candidate for the presidency,\" Kelly Dittmar, a professor of political science at Rutgers University-Camden and scholar at the Center for American Women and Politics, told ABC News. \"When it comes to perceptions of who is best to beat Donald Trump, voters make assumptions about who's won before.\"\n\nShe's got a plan for that\n\nWarren's brand isn't exactly the one that's occupied 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue before: She's a policy wonk, professorial, zany at times.\n\nA former Republican, she's also a woman, as was the last Democratic nominee, former Secretary of state Hillary Clinton, the first woman nominated by a major party to top a ticket. Clinton won the popular vote vs. Trump but lost in the electoral college.\n\nBut Clinton espoused more centrist ideals than Warren's progressive platform. Moreover, this election cycle, Warren shares the primary ballot with other female candidates.\n\nStill, Warren has surged in the polls, largely on voters' enthusiasm for her ethos and ideology.\n\n\"Warren has an idea and she knows how she's going to get there,\" Lauren Polkier of Providence, Rhode Island, told ABC after meeting Warren at a recent primary state convention, citing how relatable she finds the candidate's origin story.\n\n\"I think the biggest thing that inspires me is that she comes from this background very similar to mine -- tight-knit family, lower-middle class -- and she's beat the odds -- she's come up and she's made something for herself,\" Polkier said. \"She's very charismatic, she has a clear and concise plan for every policy and every issue. ... She's very inspiring for me, and I want to see a woman in the White House, and I'm very excited to see that.\"\n\nPeople often drive hundreds of miles across state lines for one of Warren's town halls, to see her, meet her, take a selfie with her. Warren's thousandth selfie was a young mother with two little girls.\n\nMelinda wore a bright red shirt that said, \"Impolite arrogant women make history.\"\n\n\"She inspires us, she gives us hope for the future -- and we're here because of our girls,\" Melinda told ABC News.\n\nVoters repeatedly say they're fueled by how she's a fighter, and they feel she'll fight for them, that she's not just a woman, she's a woman with a plan. But at Tuesday's fourth debate, as Warren's stock rose, her 2020 rivals took aim at those plans -- and at perceived gaps in them.\n\nThe fourth Democratic debate, at Otterbein University in Ohio, was the first time Warren faced other contenders after leading a major poll. That polling reflects her rise: She's neck and neck with former Vice President Joe Biden, even topping him in some.\n\nAnd her onstage rivals didn't shy away from hammering Warren on her signature promises. She often grabs about \"having a plan for that\" -- for everything -- but onstage, her rivals pilloried her for the lack of detail, especially when it came to her most expensive, most expansive plan, Medicare for All, which, ironically, isn't even hers and which Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., originated. Then, at times, she was accused of being in turns dishonest, punitive, naive and that she offered a \"pipe dream\" ethos of leadership.", "description": "The spotlights at the fourth Democratic debate beamed down on the 12 candidates on stage, but Sen.
