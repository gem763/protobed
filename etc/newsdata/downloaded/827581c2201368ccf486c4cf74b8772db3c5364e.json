But his request stunned those who work at the papers, which increasingly rely on content supplied by startups such as The Center Square as they and other \u201clegacy\u201d news media have cut staff.\n\n\u201cOver the 27 years that I\u2019ve worked in this industry I don\u2019t recall anything like this coming from state or federal officials,\u201d said Chris Sorenson, publisher and online editor of the Kiowa County Press , which was founded in 1887.\n\nSorenson said he received a follow-up email from Cahill seeking to discredit Center for The Square as a non-reputable news source.\n\n\u201cWell wait a minute. I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s an appropriate judgment call for them to make,\u201d Sorenson said. \u201cThat\u2019s my call. We\u2019ve been using their content for a couple of months now, and it has included coverage complimentary of the governor\u2019s administration.\u201d\n\nThe Center Square was launched in May 2019, focusing on state, statehouse and public spending coverage. It\u2019s affiliated with the Franklin News Foundation, formerly the conservative Franklin Center for Government and Public Integrity, whose donors have included groups funded by the Charles Koch Foundation.\n\nThe Polis administration doubled down Thursday after The Center Square reported on the controversy on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWhen we looked into this group and discovered that it was not an objective wire service, but instead a branded website funded by the Koch Brothers\u2019 political organization, we were alarmed that it was being reprinted by reputable news outlets in the state,\u201d Polis\u2018 press office said in a statement. \u201cNewspapers can publish whatever they want to, anywhere they want, at their own prerogative, but the public is served best when articles by partisan organizations are placed in the opinion section or branded accordingly.\u201d\n\nDan McCaleb, executive editor of The Center Square, insisted there is a strict firewall between the organization\u2019s news operation and its fundraising arm.\n\nHe said the Polis administration doesn\u2019t return his reporters\u2019 emails or phone calls and had never asked for a correction of the original article.\n\n\u201cI was in newspapers for more than 25 years before joining nonprofit media in 2017. I\u2019ve never heard of anything like this happening,\u201d McCaleb said Thursday.\n\nThe episode also provoked concern among press freedom advocates.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite a big ask to request that a story be taken down, especially when you\u2019re not pointing out inaccuracies in the story,\u201d said Jeffrey Roberts, executive director of the Colorado Freedom of Information Coalition.\n\n\u201cUltimately, it\u2019s the newspaper\u2019s decision about what they want to publish,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cI also think the news organization has a responsibility to tell its readers where this content comes from and how it\u2019s funded.\u201d\n\nSorenson said he views the episode as \u201ca momentary lapse in judgment\u201d by Polis\u2018 office and that his paper maintains professional relations with the administration.\n\n\u201cTo me, it all blends in a bit in the national conversation revolving around the term, \u2018fake news,\u2019 \u201d Sorenson said, referring to a phrase repeatedly deployed by President Donald Trump to disparage journalism.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important not only about The Center Square but also about bringing a wide variety of voices to smaller communities such as ours,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a small news operation, we can\u2019t do that effectively alone.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The press operation for Colorado's liberal Democratic governor, Jared Polis, is being criticized after it asked two small town newspapers to remove from their websites a news story reported by what Polis' staff deems a biased news organization funded by groups affiliated with the conservative Koch family.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "James Anderson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/08/28/oil_and_gas_rules_colorado_06257_c0-133-5472-3323_s1770x1032.jpg?7a85d86cdc69b49ca9b2186b3a58da0522376255", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
