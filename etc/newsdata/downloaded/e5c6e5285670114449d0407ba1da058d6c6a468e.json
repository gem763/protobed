They exercise.\n\n\u201cSeventy-six per cent of the rich aerobically exercise 30 minutes or more every day,\u201d Corley said. Aerobic exercise includes anything cardio-focused, such as running, jogging, walking, or cycling.\n\n\u201cCardio is not only good for the body, but it\u2019s good for the brain,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt grows the neurons (brain cells) in the brain.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cExercise also increases the production of glucose. Glucose is brain fuel. The more fuel you feed your brain, the more it grows and the smarter you become.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. They hang out with other successful people.\n\n\u201cYou are only as successful as those you frequently associate with,\u201d Corley wrote. \u201cThe rich are always on the lookout for individuals who are goal-oriented, optimistic, enthusiastic, and who have an overall positive mental outlook.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s equally important to avoid negative people and influences, Corley said, emphasising that \u201cnegative, destructive criticism will derail you from pursing success.\u201d\n\n4. They volunteer.\n\nTo surround themselves with good people, many self-made millionaires turn to charity, Corley said.\n\n\u201cThis is why so many wealthy people volunteer for charitable organisations, civic groups, or trade groups. It helps them expand their network of other success-minded people,\u201d he wrote.\n\nOf the millionaires he studied, 72 per cent volunteered five hours or more every month.\n\n5. They practise 'dream-setting'.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDream-setting involves scripting your ideal future life,\u201d Corley said. \u201cIn this process, you define your future life, the future you, by imagining all your dreams coming true; then you put it to paper in 500 to 1000 words.\u201d\n\nIn his study, 61 per cent of the self-made millionaires reported practising this planning strategy.\n\n6. They pursue their own goals.\n\n\u201cPursuing your own dreams and goals creates the greatest long-term happiness and results in the greatest accumulation of wealth,\u201d Corley wrote.\n\nToo many people make the mistake of chasing someone else\u2019s dream \u2013 such as their parents\u2019 \u2013 but rich people define their own goals and pursue them relentlessly and passionately.\n\n\u201cPassion makes work fun,\u201d Corley wrote. \u201cPassion gives you the energy, persistence, and focus needed to overcome failures, mistakes, and rejection.\u201d\n\n7. They sleep at least seven hours a night.\n\n\u201cSleep is critical to success,\u201d Corley wrote. In his study, 89 per cent of the self-made millionaires reported sleeping seven or more hours every night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSleep accomplishes so many things behind the scenes,\u201d including memory formation, he said.\n\n8. They get up early.\n\nNearly 50 per cent of the self-made millionaires in Corley\u2019s study said they woke up at least three hours before their workday actually began.\n\nIt\u2019s a strategy to deal with inevitable daily disruptions, such as a meeting that went too long, egregious traffic, or having to pick up your sick kid from school.\n\n\u201cThese disruptions have a psychological effect on us. They can drip into our subconscious and eventually form the belief that we have no control over our life,\u201d Corley wrote. \u201cGetting up at five in the morning to tackle the top three things you want to accomplish in your day allows you to regain control of your life. It gives you a sense of confidence that you, indeed, direct your life.\u201d\n\n9. They have multiple sources of income.\n\n\u201cSelf-made millionaires do not rely on one singular source of income,\u201d Corley said. \u201cThey develop multiple streams.\u201d\n\nHe said that \u201cthree seemed to be the magic number in my study\u201d, adding that 65 per cent \u201chad at least three streams of income that they created prior to making their first million dollars\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExamples of these additional streams are real-estate rentals, sharemarket investments, and part-ownership in a side business.\n\n10. They find and check in with mentors.\n\n\u201cFinding a mentor puts you on the fast track to wealth accumulation,\u201d Corley wrote.\n\n\u201cSuccess mentors do more than simply influence your life in some positive way,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey regularly and actively participate in your success by teaching you what to do and what not to do. They share with you valuable life lessons they learned either from their own mentors or from the school of hard knocks.\u201d\n\n11. They help others succeed.\n\n\u201cHelping other success-minded people move forward in achieving their goals and dreams helps you succeed,\u201d Corley wrote. \u201cNo one realises success without a team of other success-minded people. The best way to create your team is to offer help to other success-minded people first.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t want to give help to anyone and everyone, Corley said, but \u201cfocus on helping only those who are pursuing success, are optimistic, goal-oriented, positive, and uplifting\u201d.\n\n12. They\u2019re positive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLong-term success is only possible when you have a positive mental outlook,\u201d Corley said. \u201cIn my research, positivity was a hallmark of all the self-made millionaires.\u201d\n\nThe problem for most people is that they\u2019re unaware of their thoughts, positive or negative, he said.\n\n\u201cIf you stop to listen to your thoughts, to be aware of them, you\u2019d find most of them are negative,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut you only realise you are having these negative thoughts when you force yourself to be aware of them. Awareness is the key.\u201d\n\n13. They don\u2019t follow the herd.\n\n\u201cWe so desire to blend in, to acclimate to society, to be a part of the herd, that we will do almost anything to avoid standing out in a crowd,\u201d Corley wrote. Yet \u201cfailure to separate yourself from the herd is why most people never achieve success\u201d.\n\nSuccessful people create their own herd and then pull others into it, Corley said.\n\n\u201cYou want to separate yourself from the herd, create your own herd, and then get others to join it,\u201d he wrote.\n\n14. They practise good etiquette.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSelf-made millionaires have mastered certain rules of etiquette principles you have to master if you want to be a success,\u201d Corley wrote.\n\nThese include sending thank-you notes, acknowledging important life events such as a wedding or a birthday, eating politely and using table manners, and dressing properly for various social events.\n\n15. They dedicate 15 to 30 minutes a day to just thinking.\n\n\u201cThinking is key to their success,\u201d Corley said. The rich tend to think in isolation, in the mornings, and for at least 15 minutes every day.\n\n\u201cThey spent time every day brainstorming with themselves about numerous things,\u201d he said, from careers and finances to health and charity.\n\nThey ask questions such as: What can I do to make more money? Does my job make me happy? Am I exercising enough? What other charities can I get involved in?\n\n16. They seek feedback.\n\n\u201cFear of criticism is the reason we do not seek feedback from others,\u201d Corley wrote. \u201cBut feedback is essential to learning what is working and what isn\u2019t working. Feedback helps you understand if you are on the right track. Feedback criticism, good or bad, is a crucial element for learning and growth.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdditionally, it allows you to change course and experiment with a new career or business. As Corley said, \u201cfeedback provides you with the information you will need in order to succeed in any venture\u201d.\n\n17. They never give up.\n\n\u201cSelf-made millionaires are persistent,\u201d Corley wrote. \"They never quit on their dream. They would rather go down with the ship than quit.\"\n\nIn his study, more than one-quarter of the participants said they failed at least once in their business \u2013 and picked themselves right back up.\n\n\u201cIf you want to be successful in life, you have to persist in the face of seemingly unending adversity,\u201d he said.\n\nThis story first appeared in Business Insider.
