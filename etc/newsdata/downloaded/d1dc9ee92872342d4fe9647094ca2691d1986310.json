It truly was incredible, to be part of the World Cup, the enthusiasm we had was amazing.\u201d\n\nRapinoe, a strong off-the-field activist who also refused a potential visit the White House when the U.S. were on track to retain their world title, said players should use their success to help others.\n\n\u201cI ask everyone here, lend your platform to other people, share your success. We have a unique opportunity to use this game to actually change the world for better. I hope you take that to heart, do something, we have incredible power in this room.\u201d\n\nShe beat fellow co-captain Alex Morgan and England\u2019s Lucy Bronze.\n\nLiverpool\u2019s Juergen Klopp was voted men\u2019s coach of the year while U.S. national team coach Jill Ellis took home the best women\u2019s coach trophy.", "description": "Argentine Lionel Messi beat Liverpool defender Virgil van Dijk and five-time winner Cristiano Ronaldo to win the best FIFA player of the year award for a record sixth time on Monday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1433107850&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M264", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
