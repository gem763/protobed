The IRS's internal policies require mandatory audits of the president and vice president's tax returns, but this policy isn't codified into law.\n\nWays and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal Richard Edmund NealTreasury IG agrees to probe handling of Trump tax returns request On The Money: Economy adds 136K jobs in September | Jobless rate at 50-year low | Treasury IG to probe handling of Trump tax returns request | House presses Zuckerberg to testify on digital currency IRS whistleblower said Treasury official might have tried to interfere with Trump audit: report MORE (D-Mass.) told reporters last week that a decision on whether to publicly release the whistleblower complaint is \"subject to what counsel advises.\"\n\nSome progressive activists have called on Neal to publicly release more information about the tax-return whistleblower complaint.\n\nThe complaint has received increased attention in the media in recent days, following revelations of a separate whistleblower complaint reporting that Trump had asked the president of Ukraine to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden Joe BidenGordon Sondland expected to appear for House deposition Ivanka Trump on impeachment: 'Everything's a question of priorities' Second intel official considering filing complaint over Trump: report MORE and his son, Hunter Biden. That incident spurred House Democrats to open an impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe Trump administration is urging a judge to dismiss the Ways and Means Committee's tax-return lawsuit, arguing that the committee can't require the federal courts to take a side in the dispute. The committee disagrees that the lawsuit should be dismissed.\n\nA hearing is scheduled in the lawsuit on Nov. 6. The judge assigned to the case is Trevor McFadden, a federal judge in D.C. appointed by Trump.\n\nUpdated at 5:40 p.m.", "description": "An IRS official filed a complaint alleging that he was told that at least one Treasury Department official tried to interfere\u00a0with an audit of President Trump's or Vice President Pence's tax returns, according to The Washington Post, citing p", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/irs_092010upi_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
