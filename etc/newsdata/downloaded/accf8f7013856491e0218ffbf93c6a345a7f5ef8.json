The idea was dreamt up by F1\u2019s managing director Ross Brawn but a number of drivers, led by Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel, criticised the scheme.\n\nRoss Brawn's idea to have a qualifying sprint race has been abandoned\n\nAnd now two teams \u2014 believed to be Mercedes and Ferrari \u2014 have voted against it.\n\n\u2018The current governance system means we need unanimity to carry any decisions through to next year,\u2019 said Brawn, the former Ferrari technical director and boss of his own championship-winning team, Brawn GP, which has evolved into Mercedes.\n\n\u2018The teams initially said they would agree with it and then two teams put their hand up at the last meeting and said they wouldn\u2019t. We were just asking for the opportunity for three races to try the format.\n\nSebastian Vettel (left) and Lewis Hamilton blasted the idea of reverse grid races for qualifying\n\n'If it didn\u2019t work, we\u2019d put our hands up. If it did work, great. If it\u2019s something in between, we could have worked with that just to help us develop the format of racing, and it\u2019s frustrating that we\u2019ve not been able to do so.\u2019\n\nVettel had been the most outspoken detractor, saying: \u2018It\u2019s complete bull****. I don\u2019t know which genius came up with that.\n\n\u2018It is not the solution. It is completely the wrong idea.\u2019\n\nLiberty, the sport\u2019s owners, are due to unveil the regulations for 2021 later this week.", "description": "The experiment would have seen the Saturday qualifying replaced with a sprint race, in which drivers lined up in reverse championship order, with the leading driver starting at the back.", "authors": ["Jonathan Mcevoy For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/22/18764454-0-image-a-118_1572213763431.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
