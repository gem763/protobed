Now he\u2019s been swept up in another impeachment effort.\n\nAs a Republican congressman, Livingston announced that he would resign his seat hours before the House voted to impeach President Bill Clinton in 1998. Hustler magazine had discovered that Livingston had been unfaithful in his marriage, and Livingston resigned and challenged Clinton to do the same. The move shocked House Republicans, since Livingston was set to replace Newt Gingrich as speaker the next month.\n\nOn Wednesday, Livingston became the latest Washington figure to be mentioned in testimony before House impeachment investigators. Catherine Croft, a former National Security Council director responsible for Ukraine, said she \u201creceived multiple calls\u201d from Livingston while she was at the NSC. Livingston, who\u2019s now a lobbyist, told her he thought Marie Yovanovitch, the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, should be fired.\n\n\u201cHe characterized Ambassador Yovanovitch as an \u2018Obama holdover\u2019 and associated with George Soros,\u201d Croft said in her opening statement. \u201cIt was not clear to me at the time \u2014 or now \u2014 at whose direction or at whose expense Mr. Livingston was seeking the removal of Ambassador Yovanovitch.\u201d\n\nLivingston\u2019s lobbying disclosure filings shed little light on who \u2014 if anyone \u2014 paid Livingston to push for Yovanovitch\u2019s ouster. Her removal has become a focus of investigators examining Ukraine shadow diplomacy carried out by President Donald Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and his associates. Trump ultimately recalled Yovanovitch in May.\n\nBut the filings do show that Livingston and his firm, the Livingston Group, represented multiple Ukraine-related clients during Trump\u2019s presidency. And Croft\u2019s testimony has thrust the former congressman into the spotlight of the impeachment inquiry, as House Democrats more broadly examine Trump\u2019s attempts to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals.\n\nLivingston didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear when Livingston\u2019s conversations with Croft about Yovanovitch took place. But a Justice Department disclosure filed by his firm shows that Livingston spoke with Croft and another White House aide, Virginia Boney, by phone on May 17, 2018, as part of his lobbying work for a Ukrainian association of steel companies. They discussed Trump\u2019s steel tariffs and the upcoming visit to Washington of Natalia Mykolska, Ukraine\u2019s deputy minister of economic development and trade.\n\nLivingston worked for the trade group, called the Association of Enterprises UKRMETALURGPROM, for only two months. He and other staffers at his firm called and emailed administration officials and members of Congress about the tariffs and Mykolska\u2019s trip to Washington but didn\u2019t accompany her to meetings once she arrived.\n\nLivingston\u2019s firm was paid $40,000 \u2014 a modest fee in the lucrative realm of foreign lobbying.\n\nLivingston made far more money lobbying for another Ukrainian client, Innovative Technology and Business Consulting LLC, which hired his firm last year shortly before he stopped working for the steel trade group in early July. The limited-liability company, which reported an address in suburban Baltimore, paid Livingston\u2019s firm more than $450,000, according to disclosure filings.\n\nLivingston lobbied on behalf of \u201cconcerned citizens of Ukraine\u201d who supported Yulia Tymoshenko, a former Ukrainian prime minister running to be the country\u2019s president, according to a disclosure filing. When Tymoshenko lost the presidential race earlier this year, Livingston\u2019s firm talked her up as a potential prime minister.\n\nLivingston and others accompanied Tymoshenko in December to meetings in Washington with members of Congress and administration officials, including Kurt Volker, Trump\u2019s special representative for Ukraine negotiations at the time. Former Rep. Bob McEwen (R-Ohio), who was working with Livingston, introduced Tymoshenko to Giuliani, who has urged Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nMcEwen didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether either of Livingston\u2019s Ukrainian clients had any reason to want to oust Yovanovitch.\n\nLivingston\u2019s firm isn\u2019t one of the largest on K Street, but it represents several well-known clients, including the software giants Oracle and Adobe and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, according to disclosure filings. Livingston has also lobbied in recent years for the governments of Iraq and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nLivingston has defended his work, writing in a memoir published last year that he\u2019d \u201cmade a lot of money\u201d after leaving Congress, \u201conly to narrowly avoid bankruptcy in recent years.\u201d\n\nIn the book, titled \u201cThe Windmill Chaser: Triumphs and Less in American Politics,\u201d Livingston wrote, \u201cFor those who view the word \u2018lobby\u2019 as a four-letter word, I\u2019ll simply say everyone has the Constitutional right to petition his or her elected representatives.\u201d", "description": "Bob Livingston played a memorable role the last time a president was impeached.
