After Westminster\u2019s three rejections of former prime minister Theresa May\u2019s original Brexit deal, and after the EU\u2019s two extensions of the original Brexit deadline, Boris Johnson is now in Downing Street and we\u2019ve entered a Bizarro World where reality has been turned upside down.\n\nWe have a new Brexit deal that the EU insists is not a renegotiation, a special arrangement for Northern Ireland that the U.K. says is not a backstop (the name of the original guarantee in May\u2019s deal to avoid a hard border in Ireland), and an official British request for an extension to the Oct. 31 deadline that Johnson says he doesn\u2019t want.\n\nYou can imagine the EU\u2019s 27 other leaders taking deep breaths and counting to 10. The bloc has made a Herculean effort to parry British attempts to divide its members on Brexit, and last week\u2019s hard-fought new deal with Johnson was greeted with back-slapping relief. Finally, the EU could get on with other issues, from a tariff war with Donald Trump\u2019s America to tackling climate change and trying to hold a firm line on China.\n\nFrance\u2019s president Emmanuel Macron showered Johnson in compliments, no doubt glad that seeing off the Brits \u2014 amicably, of course \u2014 would remove an obstacle to his ambitions for deeper EU integration. Now, once again, the prospect of delay is back, and with it the threat of more contagion as Britain\u2019s dysfunctional national politics infects the orderly running of the EU and threatens that cherished unity.\n\nSo what should the bloc do? Responding hastily is in nobody\u2019s interest. Parliament hasn\u2019t actually voted on the new Brexit deal yet. The demand for a three-month extension was forced on Johnson by British lawmakers as a way to make sure the Halloween deadline wouldn\u2019t let him and his Brexiter allies bully the House of Commons into accepting \u201chis deal or no deal.\u201d\n\nAny ruling from Brussels on an extension before Parliament votes on Johnson\u2019s deal (which may happen in the next couple of days) would be seen as meddling in U.K. politics. Likewise, siding with Johnson by ruling out any delay would mean committing the EU to an ugly and economically damaging no-deal split on Oct. 31 if Westminster failed to rubber-stamp his deal.\n\nIf Members of Parliament do approve Johnson\u2019s deal rapidly, the debate is moot. The EU would obviously give the U.K. enough time to jump through the various legislative hoops to put Brexit into law.\n\nWhere things get complicated is if Westminster thwarts Macron\u2019s plans for a quick divorce and rejects Johnson\u2019s deal. If the deal fails by a handful of votes, and if those votes come from Johnson\u2019s disgruntled allies in Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist party, then Macron\u2019s more hawkish views on an extension could hold sway. Brussels might offer only a short delay (less than the three months asked for) to try to force the last few holdout MPs into line or face a no-deal exit.\n\nBut if Johnson\u2019s deal is defeated heavily in the Commons, as May\u2019s deal was, that will show the EU that Britain needs deeper political change to break the logjam. More dovish European calls for a longer extension \u2014 long enough to accommodate a general election or a second referendum \u2014 would probably win the day.\n\nEven if it appears today that some kind of extension is inevitable, no one should underestimate how tense this debate might become among the EU\u2019s leaders. The situation is very different to when May was in power, when hardcore Brexiters complained that she had done a poor job and boasted they could get a better deal from Brussels. Brexiters don\u2019t blame the EU anymore for what is clearly a U.K. problem: Parliament\u2019s inability to decide.\n\nMacron\u2019s impatience with London is spreading to his fellow leaders, with Germany\u2019s chancellor Angela Merkel talking of Britain as a post-Brexit \u201ccompetitor.\u201d There\u2019s a point where infinite delays will be deemed costlier than no deal.\n\nTo contact the author of this story: Lionel Laurent at llaurent2@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Boxell at jboxell@bloomberg.net\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\n\nLionel Laurent is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Brussels.
