He pointed to Olivia Nuzzi\u2019s New York magazine profile of Joe Biden. She called Biden \u201cthe least formidable front-runner ever.\u201d His campaign has poor fund-raising totals, he is only barely adequate in debates, and he often harkens back to the past instead of focusing on the future. As for Biden\u2019s prospects in the primaries, Nuzzi was pessimistic: \u201cNobody will tell the candidate in plain terms what they think he needs to change. Not that Biden really listens anyway.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Warren, the candidate most likely to steal the title of front-runner from Biden, has her own problems. While her panoply of \u201cfree\u201d government programs excites the liberal base and many young voters, many in the Democratic donor class are convinced that her radicalism would be poison in a general election.\n\n\u201cIf Elizabeth Warren is elected president, in my opinion, the market drops 25 percent,\u201d Wall Street billionaire Leon Cooperman told CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box, adding: \u201cBernie Sanders, same thing.\u201d He believes that Warren\u2019s proposed wealth tax would boomerang against her as voters learned that taxpayers would be forced to estimate the current value of everything they own from cars to real estate to art, private-equity portfolios, and private businesses. Cooperman even used epithets to describe Warren\u2019s program to Politico. \u201cI believe in a progressive income tax and the rich paying more. But this is the f***ing American dream she is s***ting on.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["John Fund", "Nationalreview.Com Will-Hillary-Run-Again"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
