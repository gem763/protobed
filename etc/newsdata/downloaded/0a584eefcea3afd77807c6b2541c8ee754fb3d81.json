His so-called Alford plea didn\u2019t admit guilt, but conceded that prosecutors could prove their case.\n\nProsecutors said it would have been difficult to win a first-degree murder conviction in a 35-year-old case.\n\nAuthorities have alleged that Shannon had co-conspirators in the kidnapping and slaying, but no other arrests have been made.\n\nPolice said Shannon was linked by underwear DNA evidence to the slaying, but testing wasn\u2019t done until shortly before his arrest in 2010 while he was in a Florida prison on an unrelated murder charge.\n\nShannon had a troubled childhood in Florida, and he served a previous prison stint there as a teenager after he was convicted of robbery. He was freed in his 20s and began his boxing career.\n\nHe debuted as a professional in 1977 and fought as a heavyweight under the moniker Willie \u201cThe Cannon\u201d Shannon. Most of his fights were in Florida, Portland, Oregon, and Las Vegas. He won a Nevada cruiserweight championship in 1979.\n\nIn Las Vegas, Shannon was a neighbor to Walker family - including nightclub owner James Walker and former Las Vegas NAACP President Eleanor Walker - when Jamey Walker was kidnapped on May 9, 1981. Her grandmother, Sarann Knight Preddy, ran unsuccessfully for Las Vegas City Council in 1979.\n\nPolice said the teen\u2019s father received a demand to pay $75,000, but he couldn\u2019t immediately fetch the cash on a weekend. Jamey Walker\u2019s body was found the next day, Mother\u2019s Day 1981, beneath a 50-foot high bridge at Lake Mead National Recreation Area. An autopsy determined she had been raped.\n\nShannon was convicted in a separate case in July 1985 of kidnapping and beating a woman he was dating in 1983. He served 13 years in state prison in that case.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Las Vegas Review-Journal, https://www.lvrj.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "An aging former professional boxer was sentenced to 15 years in Nevada state prison in a long-unsolved case stemming from the ransom kidnapping, rape and murder of a neighbor, an 18-year-old high school cheerleader, in 1981.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2016-03-11"}
