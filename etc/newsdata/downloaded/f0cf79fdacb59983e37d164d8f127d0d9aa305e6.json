But one subject draws critics from both parties: Big Tech.\n\nThe list of grievances is long and growing by the week. Companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon are too big and powerful. They\u2019re bad for privacy , public discourse, democracy and small business. They\u2019re spying on us, contributing to economic inequality and hooking us and our children on addictive, useless services.\n\nThe companies themselves object to these characterizations, though how loudly they object varies.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris, a California Democrat, urged Twitter to suspend President Donald Trump\u2019s account for violating the service\u2019s rules, while Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri is battling what he considers tech companies\u2019 bias against conservatives. Hawley has also told Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg that he should sell off WhatsApp and Instagram.\n\nThe companies are trying to maintain a neutral stance, even if that draws the ire of politicians as divergent as the president and those trying to impeach him. Behind the scenes, though, they are spending millions on lobbying in hopes of warding off breakups or intrusive regulation.\n\nNot that there is any danger of either happening any time soon, especially with an ongoing impeachment probe. Still, talking up Big Tech\u2019s problems has proven to be popular political rhetoric.\n\nWhen it comes to policing content, social media services are \u201ccaught between a rock and a hard place,\u201d said Andrew Guess, a Princeton University political scientist who studies social media and its effects on political opinion.\n\nBlocking or suspending accounts for hate speech can prompt complaints of political bias or censorship, but a hands-off approach may be viewed as a free pass to politicians like Trump.\n\n\u201cAnything they do is going to attract criticism,\u201d Guess said. \u201cThat, of course, makes them a target.\u201d\n\nBeyond discourse and privacy, antitrust concerns have emerged as a major concern for lawmakers and candidates. This wasn\u2019t the case in 2016, when grumbling about the outsized power of tech was largely confined to activists and those on the most liberal end of the spectrum.\n\nLeading the pack has been Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic presidential candidate who in March proposed breaking up big tech companies. She garnered immediate support, even from rivals such as Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican who retweeted Warren for what he said was the first time. Cruz said \u201cshe\u2019s right - Big Tech has way too much power to silence Free Speech.\u201d\n\nSince then, calling out the tech behemoths and other big corporations has been a pillar of Warren\u2019s presidential campaign. Sen. Bernie Sanders, another leading Democratic candidate, has also said breaking up Amazon, Google and Apple is \u201csomething we should definitely take a look at.\u201d\n\nStill, while there have been congressional hearings, investigations and fines, including a record $5 billion against Facebook, little has changed for Big Tech.\n\nA Republican-controlled Senate is unlikely to pass legislation that seems too anti-business. That includes breaking up tech companies seen as too monopolistic. The same likely goes for any privacy law that restricts companies\u2019 ability to target ads to their liking.\n\nWhile the two parties agree that Big Tech has problems, they often differ on what those problems are - and how to fix them. You won\u2019t find many Democrats complaining about tech\u2019s perceived conservative bias, for instance. Nor will you find many conservatives complaining of algorithmic bias against people of color.\n\nTrump has been uneven in his criticisms. Amazon has been a frequent target, though that is due in part to CEO Jeff Bezos\u2019s ownership of The Washington Post. He\u2019s met with Zuckerberg privately, but he\u2019s also tweeted that \u201cFacebook was always anti-Trump\u201d and accused it of colluding with the news media against him.\n\nAmid all this, at least in public, the companies have mostly kept a low profile. But there are occasional glimpses of behind-the-scenes activity. Leaked audio from an internal Facebook meeting in July captured Zuckerberg acknowledging that if \u201csomeone like\u201d Warren is elected, he expects Facebook to fight back - and prevail - against efforts to break it up in court. But he added: \u201cAnd does that still suck for us? Yeah.\u201d\n\nAmazon, by contrast, briefly tried to debate the candidates on Twitter.\n\nIn April, after Warren complained that Amazon and other big tech companies have \u201ctoo much power,\u201d the company responded by pointing the finger at its main rival: \u201cWalmart is much larger; Amazon is less than 4% of U.S. retail.\u201d\n\nWhen Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said in a TV interview in June that Amazon pays workers \u201cstarvation wages,\u201d the company tweeted that she \u201cis just wrong.\u201d\n\nAnd Amazon gave former Vice President Joe Biden a corporate tax lesson after he tweeted that it shouldn\u2019t be paying a \u201clower tax rate than firefighters and teachers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe pay every penny we owe,\u201d Amazon tweeted back. \u201cCongress designed tax laws to encourage companies to reinvest in the American economy. We have.\u201d\n\nThis was in June. Amazon seems to have backed off since.\n\nExpect the political pushback to continue, from both parties, said Joshua Tucker, co-director of New York University\u2019s Social Media and Political Participation Lab.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bipartisan issue,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the right and the left are criticizing it for different reasons.\u201d\n\n__\n\nAssociated Press writers David Klepper in Providence, Rhode Island, and Joseph Pisani in New York contributed to this story.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Republicans and Democrats don't agree on health care, immigration or taxing the rich.
