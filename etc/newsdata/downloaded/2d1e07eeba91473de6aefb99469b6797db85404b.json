The technology is being developed in the brewer\u2019s Tattoo Alpha Plant in Haasrode, in Leuven, Belgium.\n\nWhile AB InBev has previously tested the innovation on small batches to mark specific occasions, this would be the first time the technology has been used in the broader mass market.\n\nRead: Budweiser brewer Anheuser-Busch has revived its Hong Kong IPO\n\nHere\u2019s how the process branding technique works: Ink and varnish are applied directly to the glass with a \u201cno-label\u201d look, which wraps around the entire bottle. It also is digitally embossed, giving it a tactile effect.\n\n\u201cDirect object printing on glass is a revolution in print and AB InBev is pioneering this technology,\u201d said Simon Gerdesmann, manager of the Tattoo Alpha Print, or TAP, site. \u201cThis digital embossing is one of the most unusual capabilities of this technology. Colourless ink is used to [mimic] traditional glass embossing, bringing a new dimension to bottle decoration \u2014 consumers will feel and experience a bottle in a completely different way.\u201d\n\nThe bottles are being launched in the U.K. as part of a limited-edition run of Beck\u2019s Artist Series, a collaboration between the company\u2019s Global Innovation and Technology Center and six up-and-coming artists. There are to be nine bottle designs in the collaboration.\n\nThe technology also means designs for small batches are now possible four weeks faster than traditional labels, from design to retail shelves.\n\nLast week Danish brewer Carlsberg announced it had developed its first prototype bottles made out of paper that can be pulped and recycled after use.", "description": "AB InBev, the drinks company that makes Beck\u2019s beer, is pioneering new technology to \u201ctattoo\u201d its brand onto 200,000 bottles using only ink.", "authors": ["Rupert Steiner", "Bureau Chief"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT686_beckst_ZG_20191021095123.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
