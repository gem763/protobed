Baby Loss Awareness Week 2019 takes place from Wednesday 9 October to Tuesday 15 October. Each day, The Independent will be publishing a new story to shed light on people\u2019s experiences.\n\nDiscussions around stillbirth predominantly \u2013 and understandably \u2013 centre around the experiences of the mother, who has had to cope with the trauma of the event taking place within her own body.\n\nBut while we try to raise awareness around pregnancy and baby loss, there is a group that is often left behind: fathers. The isolation of being left behind as a father to a stillborn baby is a taboo subject that many keep bottled up, according to charities, leaving the process of dealing with the grief even more difficult to compute.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nHere, three fathers who lost babies to stillbirth, tell their accounts of what happened, and what helped them the most in even their darkest hours.\n\nBen Ingram\n\nIn April 2019, Ben Ingram\u2019s wife, Katie, gave birth to their stillborn daughter, Ottilie, at 39 weeks. Having married in 2012, Ottilie was conceived during Ben and Katie\u2019s second round of IVF. Ben, a 37-year-old advertising sales manager, says his wife\u2019s pregnancy had, in his opinion, been fairly straightforward and \u201crelaxed\u201d. However, on the day Katie was due to be induced, the couple were informed during a scan that their baby no longer had a heartbeat.\n\n\u201cWhen we fell pregnant, we were constantly in a place of trying to manage our hopes and dreams,\u201d Ben says. \u201cI wanted children, but was nervous about becoming a father. But my wife was so mentally ready to become a mother.\u201d\n\nDuring the later stages of their pregnancy, because they had conceived through IVF and Katie was 41 years old, they underwent more monitoring scans than other pregnant women may have done. On Wednesday 17 April, when Katie was 39 weeks pregnant, she was told during a scan that everything was fine. The midwives offered Katie the option of starting the induction process that afternoon or waiting until the morning. Ben and Katie chose the latter.\n\nIt was the weirdest, most horrific, strangest situation because there was no panic\n\n\u201cWhen we got in the following morning, we got shown to a bed and they did an initial scan,\u201d Ben states. \u201cFor us, having seen a lot of the scans, when they did the scan on that morning, we immediately knew that something wasn\u2019t right.\u201d\n\nBen and Katie were taken to a separate room, where a second scan confirmed that there was no heartbeat.\n\n\u201cIt was in itself the weirdest, most horrific, strangest situation to be in because there was no panic. It wasn\u2019t like all of a sudden we were being rushed off somewhere. It was just a very finite thing,\u201d Ben says.\n\n\u201cI can remember myself just staring at these lovely people in Barnet who were having to deliver us the most awful news, and just willing one of them to say something different or say, \u2018This is fine. We can sort this. This isn\u2019t the end of it.\u2019 No amount of staring was ever going to change the things they were saying. In those moments, it was brutal.\u201d\n\nFollowing the death of their daughter Ottilie, Ben says he and Katie\u2019s friends and family showed an \u201cimmense amount of concern\u201d for them while also processing their own grief. But he was taken aback by the lack of mental support he received as the father of a baby who was stillborn.\n\n\u201cThe NHS offers counselling sessions, but those counselling sessions were offered to either Katie on her own or to Katie and myself. It could only be one or the other, and it was never offered to me on my own,\u201d he explains.\n\nAfter Ottilie was delivered via C-section, Katie required a lot of physical assistance. This provided Ben with a sense of responsibility, as he felt he \u201cunderstood what he needed to do\u201d.\n\n\u201cI could help Katie move around, I could help with the drugs she needed to take to help her heal, I could help with the exercises and the small muscle movements to help her heal, I could be that person,\u201d Ben says. \u201cI felt useful and I sort of understood my role.\u201d\n\nFor us, Ottilie stood for something\n\nHowever, when the couple started resuming their everyday routine, Ben started to feel \u201ca bit lost\u201d. The advertising sales manager began to fear saying things in front of his wife that may upset her, although open conversations with Katie, which she initiated, have allowed them both to understand each other\u2019s grief.\n\n\u201cEverybody seems to think there\u2019s some sort of hierarchy of grief,\u201d Ben states. \u201cMum\u2019s grief and dad\u2019s grief shouldn\u2019t be compared. Both are suffering an immense amount of pain. I think there is a focus on women, and I wouldn\u2019t want that to change. But I would definitely like the amount of focus on fathers to increase.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor us, Ottilie stood for something and meant something more than just a stillbirth. She\u2019s going to be something that we carry with us for the whole of our lives.\u201d\n\nBrian Playfair\n\nOn 27 January 2014, Brian Playfair, a former royal navy medic, lost his son Lachlan to stillbirth at 34 weeks. Throughout his wife Kerry\u2019s pregnancy, their baby had moved around in the womb a lot. However, on a Tuesday evening, Kerry noticed that the baby\u2019s movements had come to a near stop. When the couple went into the hospital in Plymouth the next day, several medical professionals confirmed the news that they could not find a heartbeat. Brian and Kerry returned to the hospital a few days later, where another couple of days went by before Lachlan was born. Following the devastating loss of his son, Brian developed severe depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n\n\u201cInitially, we both just felt numb,\u201d Brian says of the moment he and his wife were told of their son\u2019s death. \u201cYou don\u2019t really know what to think or do with yourself really, you\u2019re just in a state of shock.\u201d\n\nBrian was the first person to hold Lachlan after he was born and remembers being struck by how healthy his baby looked.\n\nHe looked like he was sleeping\n\n\u201cHe just looked so healthy. He looked like he was sleeping. He looked perfectly normal, except when a baby\u2019s born they obviously don\u2019t do much sleeping,\u201d Brian states.\n\n\u201cI remember his head was resting on my left arm, and whenever my left arm dropped down a little bit his mouth would open. That would sort of remind me of what\u2019s happened.\u201d\n\nBrian and Kerry spent as much time as they could with their son before had to say goodbye. The midwives, who Brian describes as \u201cabsolutely brilliant\u201d, placed a cold mattress underneath the baby in his Moses basket in order to preserve his body for as long as possible.\n\n\u201cWhen I had to say goodbye to him, that was easily the single most emotional time of my life,\u201d Brian says. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt so angry and frustrated, not just at the situation, but at my inability to protect my son as a dad. That was by far the hardest thing for me to get over.\u201d\n\nBrian was bewildered by the lack of support he received from the royal navy following Lachlan\u2019s death, as some of his colleagues didn\u2019t know what to say to him and he was \u201ceffectively being bullied by a couple of senior officers\u201d at the time.\n\n10 months after the loss of his son, Brian was diagnosed with PTSD.\n\nHe took four months off work and underwent EMDR treatment, (Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing), a form of psychotherapy that is used to help people who have suffered from traumatic experiences. Brian also began taking medication, which he still takes today. \u201cI do still suffer with PTSD and depression, although not as bad as I used to,\u201d he says.\n\nWhile Brian and his wife did not undergo counselling immediately after Lachlan\u2019s death, \u201clocking themselves away in a bubble\u201d, Brian found certain coping mechanisms beneficial, including going on walks and listening to music. His experience also spurred him onto to help other people who are struggling with mental health issues, becoming a mental health first aid instructor on the side, in addition to a retail manager and a law student.\n\nIt\u2019s important to wait until you feel ok talking openly about losing your child\n\n\u201cI\u2019m quite passionate about mental health nowadays,\u201d Brian says. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t understand how to deal with it, how to identify the symptoms. So that\u2019s why I do that.\u201d\n\nBrian acknowledges that while there is increased awareness of stillbirth in the media, in his opinion, fathers require a greater level of \u201csupport and compassion\u201d, stating that he feels they are \u201cleft in the cold a bit\u201d.\n\nBrian, Kerry and their children, Chelsey and four-year-old Leathan, frequently visit Lachlan\u2019s grave at the cemetery. Brian says that it is important for bereaved parents to speak openly about their experiences at a time that feels right for them.\n\n\u201cI think you know when the time is right,\u201d Brian says. \u201cYou get to a point as a parent where it helps you to talk openly and honestly about losing a child, stillbirth or not. Just wait for you to feel that\u2019s it ok to do it.\u201d\n\nDave Bailey\n\nIn 2016, Dave Bailey and his wife, Alice, suffered the stillbirth of their daughter Vera at 38 weeks. Having noticed that their baby had been moving less in the womb, Dave and Alice were checked at a hospital and told their daughter was fine. Two days later, while partaking in their routine 38-week appointment, they were told during a scan that their daughter had died. Alice was induced over the weekend, and almost died after delivering Vera due to severe blood loss. Dave and Alice were able to spend around six to seven hours with their baby before they had to say goodbye.\n\nWhen Alice was taken to theatre in hospital following the complicated delivery of Vera, Dave helplessly watched as his wife was being treated by doctors, holding their stillborn daughter in his arms.\n\nAlice remained in the labour ward for three more days, where she was able to hear the \u201chorrific\u201d sound of other babies being born and crying.\n\nIn the aftermath of their daughter\u2019s death, Dave and Alice contacted Petals, a baby loss counselling charity.\n\nWe were able to support others if they wanted it\n\nInitially, Alice was hesitant about attending counselling sessions with a stranger.\n\nDave was insistent that they go, stating that he found the counselling sessions \u2013 which he attended with Alice and on his own \u2013 very beneficial for his mental state while trying to process his grief.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until he and his wife took part in a piece of NHS research, where they found themselves in a room with other bereaved couples, that he realised how much the counselling with Petals had helped them both find a way to speak openly about the loss of their child.\n\n\u201cWe were in a room answering questions and there were a couple of couples in there who just weren\u2019t coping with the sessions,\u201d Dave says.\n\n\u201cWe later found out they hadn\u2019t been going to counselling.\u201d\n\nDave explains that this \u201creassured\u201d him and Alice that their counselling was helping them, as they were able to say Vera\u2019s name out loud, \u201cwhereas these people couldn\u2019t even say their babies\u2019 names\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt made us feel like we were in a fairly good place, and we were then able to support others if they wanted it,\u201d he adds.\n\nDave believes that much of the stigma that still surrounds stillbirth is due to the fact that many people are under the impression that it is \u201crare\u201d.\n\nIn 2017, one in every 238 births in the UK was a stillbirth, Sands outlines. This equates to nine stillborn babies a day and around 3,200 stillbirths that year.\n\nYou have to focus on the people who are supporting you\n\n\u201cWe learnt that there\u2019s a lot of people that this has happened to, but there\u2019s also a lot of people who are interested in this area who are unable to get into it because it is under supported.\u201d\n\nDave explains that he and Alice received a variety of reactions from friends following Vera\u2019s death, some of which were supportive and others that were less empathetic.\n\n\u201cBecause of how we were feeling at the time, you just had to dismiss those people for a bit because it was just too painful and focus on the people who were supporting you.\u201d\n\nIf you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this article, you can contact stillbirth and neonatal death charity Sands on 0808 164 3332 or email helpline@sands.org.uk.
