Fifteen finalists will be notified of their status by the end of January.\n\nThe Renewal Awards were created to celebrate social innovation demonstrated by nonprofits that are finding creative solutions to America\u2019s most pressing problems. To date, 26 organizations have received more than $500,000 in funding to further their work.\n\nWinners have been discovered in cities dotting the country, from Hazleton, Pennsylvania, and Burlington, Vermont; to Memphis, Chicago, and Detroit; to Austin, Forest Grove, Oregon, and Los Angeles. Each year the Awards have grown in the scale and caliber of entries; the 2019 Renewal honorees were selected from 9,300 nominations, three times as many in comparison to 2018.\n\nNominees will be evaluated by a small group of Atlantic editors and reporters, a member of the Allstate Foundation, and with an outside panel of judges, based on the following criteria:\n\nInnovative solutions: identifying new ideas for tackling difficult problems.\n\nImpact: how are nonprofits measuring and proving their ideas work?\n\nScale: how can an idea be scaled and replicated in other communities?\n\nIn addition, Allstate will select a Youth Empowerment Award winner.\n\nThe Awards are a flagship initiative of The Renewal Project, which tells the stories of individuals and organizations who are solving problems in their communities.
