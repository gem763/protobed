Photo: Unanue Europa Press/Europa Press via Getty Images\n\nWoody Allen is coming to his own defense regarding Scarlett Johansson\u2019s recent upheaval of the sexual-molestation allegations his adopted daughter, Dylan Farrow, has made against him. He reiterated that he is the \u201cposter boy\u201d for the #MeToo movement, since he does the bare minimum and employs women in his films. He also discussed whether his latest movie, A Rainy Day in New York, will come out in the United States. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with hundreds of actresses, [and] not one of them has ever complained about me, not a single complaint,\u201d he reasoned in an interview with France 24. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with, employed women in the top capacity, in every capacity, for years, and we\u2019ve always paid them exactly the equal of men. I\u2019ve done everything that the #MeToo movement would love to achieve.\u201d\n\nA Rainy Day in New York is screening at the Deauville Film Festival in France this Friday, although neither Allen nor the cast will be in attendance. It is set for a European release after Amazon returned the rights to distribute it in the United States. Cast members Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Selena Gomez, and Rebecca Hall donated their salaries from the film. Being ostracized doesn\u2019t concern Allen, though. \u201cTo me, the movie is being released all over the world,\u201d he said. \u201cIf people enjoy the movie, I think it will eventually be released in the U.S. His next film, a romantic comedy starring Christoph Waltz, Louis Garrel, and Gina Gershon, just wrapped filming in Spain, and Allen says he is working on another script. The 83-year-old said, no matter what, he \u201cwill always work.\u201d", "description": "Woody Allen defends himself after Scarlett Johansson reveals she believes him over his accuser, the 83-year-old\u2019s adopted daughter, Dylan Farrow.", "authors": ["Zoe Haylock"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/06/06-woody-allen.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
