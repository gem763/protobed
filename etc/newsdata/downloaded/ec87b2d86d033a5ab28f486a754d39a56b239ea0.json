(Darryl Dyck/Canadian Press)\n\nHe added that the Trudeau government showed disrespect by not speaking directly with Chinese officials in the days following Wanzhou's arrest.\n\nA Conservative government, he says, will do a \"reset\" on relations.\n\n\"What we need to do is ... make sure that China knows that dealing with Canada will be a peer-to-peer relationship and that we will push back when needed,\" he said.\n\nDeclaring Jerusalem as capital of Israel\n\nThe Conservative Party pledged in their platform to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and committed to moving Canada's embassy to that city.\n\nThe move comes after President Donald Trump controversially relocated the United States' embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv last year.\n\nAsked why it was part of the Conservative's platform, O'Toole said that Israel should have the right to determine its own capital.\n\n\"The Knesset, which I've visited, is in Jerusalem, as is their foreign affairs, their Supreme Court [and] a number of the institutions of state,\" he said.\n\nConservative leader Andrew Scheer addresses the media following the unveiling of his parties platform Friday, Oct. 11, 2019. Checkup requested Scheer take part in an Ask Me Anything segment. (Jonathan Hayward/Canadian Press)\n\nO'Toole adds that declaring Israel's capital to be Jerusalem is key to a two-state solution, which would see independent states of Israel and Palestine.\n\n\"Recognizing that [Jerusalem as capital] now, which we will do, is not in any way going to hold back a two-state solution,\" O'Toole said.\n\nCross Country Checkup requested the leaders of the Liberal, Conservative, Green and New Democratic parties take part in an Ask Me Anything session.
