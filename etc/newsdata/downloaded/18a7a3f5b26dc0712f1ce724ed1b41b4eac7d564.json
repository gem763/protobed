Organizers said about 4,000 people attended.\n\n\u201cFive-hundred sixty-five people were murdered last year, and it\u2019s a shame, and I want Eddie Johnson to change his values, and to change them fast,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe president has had a tumultuous relationship with the city of Chicago. Monday marked the president's first visit to the city as president. As a candidate, he attempted to hold a rally there in 2016, but it was cancelled due to large protests.\n\nTeresa Crawford/AP, FILE\n\nIn 2017, Trump threatened to \"send in the Feds\" to solve Chicago's crime problem. \"If Chicago doesn't fix the horrible 'carnage' going on,\" he tweeted then, \"I will send in the Feds!\"\n\nOver 25 groups planned to protest the president\u2019s visit to the Windy City today, and several hundred gathered outside the city's Trump International Hotel & Tower, where the president was due to attend a fundraiser Monday.\n\nBut at the police chiefs event, Trump emerged to campaign rally-style music and was frequently applauded \u2013 including when he blasted the Chicago police superintendent.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not doing his job,\u201d Trump said of Johnson, listing statistics of those murdered and shot in Chicago. He criticized Johnson and \u201cstupid politicians who have no idea what the hell they\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nTrump also criticized \"Empire\" actor Jussie Smollett, who earlier this year said he was attacked by people who supported the president. Police later alleged it was a hoax.\n\nLeah Millis/Reuters\n\n\u201cThen you have the case of this wise guy, Jessie Smollett, who beat up himself,\u201d Trump said Monday. As he has said previously, Trump said Smollett had carried out a \u201chate crime.\"\n\nHe called the Smollett case a \u201creal big scam\u201d \u2013 \u201cjust like the impeachment of your president is a scam.\u201d The crowd applauded.\n\n\u201cSmollett is still trying to get away from it,\u201d Trump said.\n\nAt the event, Trump signed an executive order establishing a Commission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice. According to the White House, the commission will examine \"key policing issues like substance abuse, homelessness, and mental illness,\" and would look at \"best practices for recruiting, training, and supporting law enforcement officers.\" It will be charged with reporting back to the president, with recommendations, within a year, the White House said.\n\nABC News' Andrew Fies and Susan Caraher contributed reporting from Chicago, and ABC News' Jordyn Phelps contributed reporting from Washington.", "description": "", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/trump-6-rt-er-191028_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
