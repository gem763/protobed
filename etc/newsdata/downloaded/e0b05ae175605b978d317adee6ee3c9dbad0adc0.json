Both nations have 15 points from six games and meet next month at Stade de France.\n\nStarting his first game for France, after a scoring debut as a substitute against Albania, forward Jonathan Ikon\u00e9 threaded a ball behind the defense for winger Kingsley Coman to thump the ball into the roof of the net after 18 minutes.\n\nIt was Coman\u2019s third in two games, after netting twice against Albania.\n\nGriezmann could have made it 2-0 but aimed his penalty too close to goalkeeper Josep Gomes in the 28th, again from a casual short run-up just like against Albania.\n\nHaving denied Turkey until near the very end in a 1-0 loss last Saturday, Gomes made a splendid save to keep out center half Rapha\u00ebl Varane\u2019s stinging long-range drive approaching halftime.\n\nBut he was well beaten in the 52nd when imposing center half Cl\u00e9ment Lenglet headed in Griezmann\u2019s free kick. The veteran goalie then carelessly spilled Nabil Fekir\u2019s injury-time free kick, which was prodded home by fellow substitute Wissam Ben Yedder.\n\nFrance travels to play third-place Iceland - which has 12 points - before hosting Turkey on Oct. 14.\n\n\u201cNext month we have matches against our two direct rivals for the qualifying places,\u201d Deschamps said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Antoine Griezmann did better as a provider than a finisher, again missing a penalty before setting up the second goal as France beat Andorra 3-0 in a European Championship qualifying match on Tuesday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/10/france_andorra_euro_2020_soccer_41994_c0-149-3579-2235_s1770x1032.jpg?894113d2b1cb0770d8abc6026e94266c7b173642", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
