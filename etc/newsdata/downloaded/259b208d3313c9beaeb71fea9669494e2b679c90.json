Katie Hill\u2019s lawyers send cease-and-desist letter to DailyMail.com over nude photos", "language": "en", "text": "The DailyMail.com published a story Thursday about the California Democrat\u2019s personal life, which included naked photos it said were of Hill, including one it claimed shows her with a \u201cNazi-era\u201d tattoo.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe website\u2019s story followed one published Wednesday by the conservative website RedState.com, which first alleged that Hill, 32, had been in a three-person relationship that included her husband and a female campaign aide. It also alleged she is in a romantic relationship with a member of her congressional staff \u2014 an accusation the House Ethics Committee is investigating.\n\nRedState published one nude photo allegedly of Hill as well. It is unclear whether her legal team will also send that website a similar letter demanding it be taken down.\n\nThe attorneys, who addressed their letter to Candace Trunzo, executive editor of the DailyMail.com, said Hill was sent a message before publication asking if she wished to comment on its \u201cprofessed intention to distribute lewd images of her, of unknown and unverified provenance.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThey wrote that Hill\u2019s estranged husband had been emotionally abusive for years and that by \u201cspreading these purported claims, and dehumanizing and shaming images across the globe, you have perpetuated the cycle of abuse Representative Hill has endured.\u201d Hill and her husband, Kenny Heslep, have filed for divorce.\n\nTrunzo did not respond to a request for comment. Neither did Hill\u2019s attorneys.\n\nHill is a freshman rising star in the Democratic Party who won a Republican-strong seat in 2018 to help the Democrats take the majority of the House. She is a junior member of the Democrats\u2019 leadership team with a powerful post on the House Oversight Committee.\n\nAD\n\nHill has acknowledged that she had been in an \u201cinappropriate\u201d relationship with a campaign aide but has denied that she\u2019s had a romantic affair with a congressional staffer, which would be against the House\u2019s code of conduct.\n\nAD\n\nIn their letter, her attorneys cite California law against distribution of private, sexual images as well as libel laws, contending that the website\u2019s claim that Hill has \u201cNazi imagery on her body in the form of a tattoo is false and defamatory.\u201d\n\nThey also comment on the emotional duress the publication has caused the congresswoman, writing: \u201cNo one \u2014 not Representative Hill, not anyone else \u2014 should ever be expected to endure a publication like that which she has suffered today.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "The website is the second to publish alleged lewd photos of the Democratic congresswoman.", "authors": ["Congress", "Campaigns", "Health Policy", "Pennsylvania Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/V13L4rNc5CLIi5pLcH5TguAXyg8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2JYXQXHU7QI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
