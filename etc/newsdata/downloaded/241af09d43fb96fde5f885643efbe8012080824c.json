I know he\u2019s going to get his revenge. Not if but when he does it, I want people to remember me for the person who tried to get justice for what he\u2019s done.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nThe pair were married for 17 years and have a daughter, Rhona, together.\n\nCandice compared her husband to a \"Jekyll and Hyde\" character and revealed he wouldn't speak to her for eight days at a time for no apparent reason.\n\nShe said: \"When you first meet someone you don\u2019t expect it to turn as sinister as what my husband did. When you think of domestic abuse you think somebody is hitting you, shouting, demoralising and ruining your confidence,\n\n\"He did all that. On top of that it was the drugs he was giving me.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nAfter moving out for five weeks without warning in 2016, Stephen returned home and their marriage took a sinister turn.\n\nIn April 2017, Candice worried she was being drugged and tried to get help, but her doctor didn't do any tests as she had no idea what she was being poisoned with.\n\nIn September that year she went to the Derby Royal Infirmary and tests revealed she had been absorbing anti-depressants and insomnia drugs.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nDiscussing what the police found in their bedroom, Candice said: \"I felt so sick. They found in a speaker a hidden video camera. And they also found some hard copy photos in his draw.\n\n\"They asked me if I knew anything about these. They were showing me these photos and I had to walk away. There was body parts. And yes it was clearly me in all states.\n\n\"When he used to drug me within five or 10 minutes I'd be completely out of it. He wasn\u2019t just drugging me, he was overdosing me.\n\n\"To start with it was mainly food. I like spicy food so it was putting it in curries and things like that.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nStephen walked free from Derby Crown Court on February 19 this year after being given a a 16-month prison sentence, which is suspended for two years.\n\nWhen asked if she believed the sentence was more lenient because it was her husband, Candice said: \"I think you could be right. I don't know why he got such a low sentence as he did.\n\n\"They said they couldn't prove he was drugging me for the photos but clearly my daughter's witness statement it said everything they need to know about how he was drugging me.\"\n\n*This Morning airs weekdays on ITV at 10.30am", "description": "Candice Lee was secretly drugged by husband Stephen, who took intimate photos of her naked body, and was given a suspended prison sentence", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20647300.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Woman-drugged-by-husband-pleas-for-her-life-as-she-fears-he-wants-revenge.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
