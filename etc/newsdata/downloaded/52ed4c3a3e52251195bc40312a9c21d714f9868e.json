Instead of the loud, defiant force that America has come to know at his impromptu news conferences and free-wheeling campaign rallies, the president was subdued and self-absorbed as he read from his notes.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cThe witch hunt continues,\u201d Trump told hundreds gathered at a Manhattan hotel. \u201cBut they\u2019re getting hit hard on this witch hunt. Because when they look at the information, it\u2019s a joke. Impeachment for that?\u201d\n\nAfter wrapping up his hectic annual visit to the United Nations, Trump, clad in his trademark dark suit and red tie, appeared resigned to return to the nation\u2019s capital Thursday and enter a new \u2014 and decidedly unwelcome \u2014 phase of his presidency.\n\n\u201cIt is very sad what the Democrats are doing to this country,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cThey\u2019re dividing.\u201d\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi announced on Tuesday that the House was formally opening an impeachment inquiry into Trump, and by Wednesday a majority of lawmakers in the chamber had backed the proceedings after news that he had asked the Ukrainian president to hurt a political rival.\n\nTrump\u2019s 42-minute, disjointed news conference came after he had spent four days on the road \u2014 flying to Texas and Ohio to meet with two foreign leaders on Sunday, and then three days of nonstop meetings at the United Nations, where he delivered two speeches.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/3344/1155968404_6089480279001_6089478859001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nInstead of spending an hour or two calling on so many reporters that even the journalists grew tired \u2014 as he has done numerous times before \u2014 the president called on just four people, two who work for outlets that focus on the economy, one of his favorite topics. He looked around the hotel conference room looking for another.\n\n\u201cQuestion on the economy,\u201d he called out. \u201cA question on the economy.\u201d\n\nTrump spoke for 25 minutes before he even started answering questions, and while he touched on familiar topics, from his Electoral College win in 2016 to rebuilding the U.S. military, the subject often returned to impeachment.\n\nAfter answering the first question \u2014 why it is appropriate for him to ask a foreign leader for information about a political rival \u2014 he appeared to tire of the topic. He took a break from the questions and asked two of his most loyal aides, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, who were standing next to him, to say a few words about their work at the U.N.\n\nTrump admitted that he had asked the newly elected Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to work with Attorney General William Barr and Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani to look into whether former Vice President Joe Biden pressured Ukrainian officials to fire a prosecutor investigating gas company on whose board of directors Biden\u2019s son Hunter served, but he insisted there was nothing wrong with what he did. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t pressured at all,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter months of stonewalling Congress on a variety of investigations \u2014 from the Russia investigation to whether he is using the presidency to enrich himself \u2014 Trump hinted that he would release a transcript of another call with Zelensky and that Vice President Mike Pence, who was not present, might do the same. He said he had told House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy he wanted to be transparent as the investigation moved forward.\n\nJust hours earlier, he had ordered the release of a five-page document detailing one of his calls with Zelensky.\n\nStill, while Trump\u2019s demeanor was changed, his defense was familiar. He used the same words to describe the two-year investigation by special prosecutor Robert Mueller into whether he and his aides conspired with Russia to interfere in the 2016 election.\n\nHe accused Biden of threatening Ukrainian officials and claimed that Democrats traveled to Ukraine to force Zelensky \u201cto do things that they wanted under the form of political threat.\u201d He offered no details or evidence.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

It was dead.\u201d", "description": "At a news conference, the president offered a familiar defense of his actions but in an unfamiliar way.", "authors": ["Anita Kumar"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/02/5d/89fa8b2d422a86a2fcf8542b8bfb/190925-trump-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
