The \"blank-styled clothes\" were intended \"to represent how through fashion, power is exercised over life, to eliminate self-expression,\" the post explained.\n\nThe fashion house also pointed out that the straitjacket-inspired garments were just one part of its Spring/Summer 2020 collection. Made up of almost 90 looks, the range also featured a number of colorful items that Gucci designed as an \"antidote\" to the white utilitarian garments.\n\nA spokesperson for Gucci could not immediately be contacted for comment on the protest.\n\nGucci said Alessandro Michele designed the \"blank styled clothes to represent how through fashion, power is exercised over life, to eliminate self-expression and curb identity.\" Credit: Victor Boyko/Getty Images for Gucci\n\nThis is not the first time the fashion house has found itself at the center of controversy.\n\nIn February, Gucci apologized and discontinued selling a sweater that social media users said resembled blackface because of its design.\n\nIn a Twitter post, the Italian luxury brand said it \"deeply apologizes for the offense caused by the wool balaclava jumper.\"", "description": "A runway model has staged a protest at Gucci's Spring/Summer 2020 show at Milan Fashion Week, describing the fashion house's decision to \"use the imagery of straight jackets and outfits alluding to mental patients\" as \"unimaginative\" and \"offensive.\"", "authors": ["Amy Woodyatt"], "top_image": "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190922214957-28-milan-fashion-week-spring-summer-2020-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
