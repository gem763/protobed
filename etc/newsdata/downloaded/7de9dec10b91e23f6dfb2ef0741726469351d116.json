(Lachlan Cunningham/Getty Images)\n\nA plane flying Sacramento Kings owner Vivek Ranadive, several members of the organization and multiple media members was struck by lightning while transporting them back to the United States after a pair of preseason games in India.\n\nThe plane, according to the Sacramento Bee, was hit by lightning sometime before it landed in England to refuel before making the rest of the way back to Sacramento. Everyone on board was safe, and the plane made the rest of the journey back to Northern California.\n\n\u201cWhen we landed [in England] the airplane underwent inspection,\u201d Kings senior vice president of communications Joelle Terry, who was on the flight, told the Sacramento Bee. \u201cNo damage was found and we have been cleared for takeoff.\u201d\n\nScary moment as Kings private jet hit by lighting before landing for layover in England in return home from India trip. Don\u2019t worry @drake fans, it wasn\u2019t the rapper\u2019s plane the players and coaching staff is using. Actually plane @bgoodvlade, @Vivek and remaining staff & media on \u2014 Marc J. Spears (@MarcJSpearsESPN) October 6, 2019\n\nEveryone but @ggerould was shook (yours truly included). \u201cNothing to worry about, boys...\u201d G-Man says... https://t.co/u9noBL4sd7 \u2014 Sam Amick (@sam_amick) October 6, 2019\n\nThe Kings fell twice to the Indiana Pacers this weekend in Mumbai, falling by one point in overtime on Friday and then by 24 points on Saturday. The games marked the first ever exhibition games to take place in the country, a venture led by Ranadive \u2014 who grew up in Mumbai.\n\nThe plane that was struck by lightning on Sunday was not carrying any Kings players or coaches. They traveled separately on Drake\u2019s massive Boeing 767-200ER plane. The Grammy Award-winning Canadian rapper\u2019s plane, otherwise known as \u201cAir Drake,\u201d is reportedly worth $185 million.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, the Federal Aviation Administration estimates that lightning hits each plane in service in the United States once a year on average. Though planes are built to withstand a strike, they are then required to undergo an inspection upon landing.\n\nWhile Sunday\u2019s incident shocked those on board \u2014 Amick texted the Sacramento Bee that it \u201cspooked us a bit\u201d \u2014 it turns out they had nothing to worry about.\n\nBTW we were struck by lightning on our approach. I loved it! @TheDougChristie not so much! Captain just told us they will do an inspection while here. \u2014 Grant Napear (@GrantNapearshow) October 6, 2019\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The plane, carrying Kings owner Vivek Ranadive, members of his staff and several media members, was struck by lightning before landing in England to refuel on Sunday.", "authors": ["Ryan Young", "Yahoo Sports Contributor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/O89htT74upFnNgh0NRqZWg--~B/aD0yMDAxO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/868a3fe0-e891-11e9-befa-54ebc5f88c1e", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
