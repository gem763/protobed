It recently dipped its toes into on-demand video streaming with GoPlay as it attempts to grab a bigger slice of the Southeast Asian market currently dominated by Singapore-based Grab.\n\nMakarim himself hails from a prominent Indonesian family. His grandfather was a pioneer of Indonesian freedom movement, his mother is an anti-corruption activist, and his father is a noted lawyer. Viewed in that light, the tech entrepreneuer\u2019s political plunge seems all but preordained.", "description": "Gojek founder and CEO Nadiem Makarim is stepping down from his chief executive role to take up a cabinet post in the newly formed Indonesian government.", "authors": ["Ravie Lakshmanan"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2Fnadiem-makarim-hed.jpg&signature=c9b326960dd41da28be35108f0d7d291", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
