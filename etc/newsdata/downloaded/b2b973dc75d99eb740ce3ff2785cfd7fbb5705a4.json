For centuries, well-heeled gentlemen with wandering eyes have been castigated\u2014but also romanticized\u2014as bounders, philanderers and cads.\n\nWith a string of affairs to his name and an unknown number of children sprung from his loins, Boris Johnson became Britain\u2019s patron saint of bounders, bounding all the way to No. 10.\n\nThat carefully-honed reputation took a dark turn this week when a former colleague came forward to describe the future prime minister touching her upper thigh without her consent at a magazine lunch 20 years ago.\n\nCharlotte Edwardes says she was sitting next to her sometime boss\u2014she occasionally wrote articles for the Spectator where Johnson was editor\u2014when it happened.\n\n\u201cUnder the table, I feel Johnson\u2019s hand on my thigh. He gives it a squeeze. His hand is high up my leg and he has enough inner flesh beneath his fingers to make me sit suddenly upright,\u201d she wrote in The Sunday Times.\n\n\u201cAfterwards, I confide in the young woman on his other side. She replies: \u2018Oh God, he did exactly the same to me.\u2019\u201d\n\nJohnson has a long dishonorable history with women which includes cheating on them; fighting over who should pay for an abortion; having the police called to a domestic dispute; getting fired for lying to cover up an affair; and the outright refusal to admit how many children he has\u2014it\u2019s at least five. Until now, however, he has never been publicly accused of sexual assault or harassment.\n\nThe serious nature of the accusation forced him to break his rule of refusing to deny or even address stories about his private life. He says it is \u201cnot true.\u201d\n\nAs they scramble to cover for him, cabinet ministers are struggling to get through interviews at the party\u2019s annual conference in Manchester. Most have tried to say they can\u2019t comment on the accusation, or simply say they trust the prime minister\u2019s denial.\n\nOne cabinet minister took the contortions a step further, telling The Daily Beast that the allegation was part of an anti-Brexit plot to stop the PM.\n\n\u201cObviously those are questions that will be put to the prime minister and I think what its symptomatic of is that people who do not want Brexit to happen will use anything they can to throw at it,\u201d said Nicky Morgan, secretary of state for culture.\n\nSurely she wasn\u2019t suggesting Edwardes had invented the allegation to try and stop Brexit? \u201cNo, but I'm not involved so how would I know?\u201d Morgan said.\n\nJohnson himself hinted that a malign anti-Brexit motivation might lie behind the claim; bringing up the implementation of the 2016 referendum when asked about the allegation on the BBC on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThis is a very difficult time and people are thinking of the country in the sense that Brexit is about to be done and a lot of people don\u2019t want Brexit to be done,\u201d he said. \u201cThey conceive of me as the person who is helping to deliver Brexit, and it\u2019s inevitable that I\u2019m going to come under a certain amount of shot and shell.\u201d\n\nEdwardes is not the only woman from his past who is overshadowing Johnson\u2019s policy announcements at a conference that was supposed to be a de facto general election launch. He has been accused of using his position as Mayor of London to help an American businesswoman with whom he was allegedly having an affair.\n\nThe London Assembly has referred allegations of misconduct in public office to the Independent Office for Police Conduct after it was reported that Johnson helped the former model to secure grants for her company and took her on international trade missions with him despite her business not meeting the requirements.\n\nJohnson has refused to deny that he was having an affair with Jennifer Arcuri, but he claims that when it came to helping her business \u201ceverything was done entirely in the proper way.\u201d\n\nThe claims of potential financial impropriety\u2014she also reportedly secured a valuable entrepreneur visa after Johnson had promoted her start-up\u2014mean stories about this affair will also prove difficult to sweep away.\n\nMorgan optimistically claimed that Johnson\u2019s personal troubles were a non-issue for the thousands of delegates, local politicians, Members of Parliament and Conservative campaigners at conference: \u201cApart from journalists no one else has talked about it, no activists, no MPs,\u201d she said.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s true that no one has mentioned it to Morgan\u2014one of the most senior women in the Cabinet\u2014but the issue is most certainly being debated at the fringe events and parties here in Manchester.\n\nSome activists fear these revelations will continue to sour people\u2019s views on the prime minister ahead of an election which is expected to take place before the end of the year. A poll done last week\u2014before the latest round of stories\u2014already showed that 47 percent of women described Johnson as \u201cdislikeable.\u201d\n\nOne Conservative party grandee told The Daily Beast that he thought Johnson\u2019s dalliances were already so well known by the public that\u2014in the language of stock market speculators\u2014the latest claims had already been \u2018priced in\u2019 to their valuation of the prime minister.\n\n\u201cI think quite a lot of it's in the price, I don't think anybody elected Boris as leader thinking that he had a blameless private life,\u201d he said. \u201cI also think both the party and the public are much less concerned than used to be the case, and so I don't think that\u2019s a huge concern.\u201d\n\nOpposition lawmakers are using the Arcuri claims to emphasize their attacks on the prime minister\u2019s integrity. \u201cIt is a deeply worrying pattern of behavior that speaks to the fundamental question of Boris Johnson\u2019s character,\u201d said Labour Deputy Leader Tom Watson.\n\nIt may be that ultimately the groping accusation\u2014reminiscent of President Trump\u2019s Access Hollywood tape\u2014is what sticks in the minds of the public. We won\u2019t have long to wait to find out with an election on the horizon and the chance for voters to deliver their verdict on then man the U.S. president has dubbed \u201cBritain Trump.\u201d", "description": "After decades of political success despite his lascivious private life, Boris Johnson\u2019s behavior toward women may finally be catching up with him.", "authors": ["Nico Hines", "London Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569940026/191001-Hines-Boris-Johnson-tease_ipdw9j", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
