(No verdict has been reached in any the court cases she is involved in, and as a sitting senator, Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner remains immune to prosecution.)\n\nUnder Macri, the peso has plunged, , inflation rocketed to 56% per year, and the percentage of the population living below the breadline has risen from 29% to 35%.\n\nA recent survey showed that 56.9% of voters believe the economy would deteriorate even further should Macri continue in office, while 59.5% expect it could improve under Fern\u00e1ndez. The survey, by the CEOP pollster, predicts Fern\u00e1ndez will beat Macri by 50.5% to 31.2% this Sunday.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner with presidential candidate Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez.

She dominates social media and seems to represent a modern-day version of Eva Per\u00f3n, Argentina\u2019s unofficial patron saint of the poor, the charismatic wife of President Juan Per\u00f3n.\n\nLike Evita, Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner has earned first-name recognition in Argentina; she also championed the poor with social aid programs while remaining a self-confessed slave to fashion.\n\nThe former president is a talented public speaker who made weekly national addresses in office. Macri, meanwhile, is an often graceless speaker, whose wooden delivery did not help when announcing unpopular government measures such as massive tariff hikes.\n\nHe has also earned the dislike of many female voters for his reflexive sexism, and his support for Argentina\u2019s anti-abortion movement, which prevented the passage of a law legalising abortion during his presidency.\n\n\u201cCristina represents an empowered woman,\u201d said Samanta Casareto, professor of history at Buenos Aires University. \u201cFor a whole generation she signifies the vindication of social rights that had been deliberately set aside.\u201d\n\nIn a radio interview last week, Macri said Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner\u2019s economic policies were like \u201chanding over the administration of the house to your wife, and your wife, instead of paying the bills, uses the credit card, and uses it and uses it, until one day they come to mortgage your house\u201d.\n\nSuch comment encapsulate the mindset of a \u201cmachirulo\u201d \u2013 a recent coinage by Argentina\u2019s feminists for a sexist bigot who disrespects women.\n\nAfter the disastrous radio interview, Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner responded rapidly with a tweet: \u201cSee?!! I told you he was a machirulo.\u201d\n\nFern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner also displayed superior political acumen when she chose not to run for president, instead handing the nomination to the moderate Fern\u00e1ndez, a mild-mannered, moderate Peronist who served as cabinet chief in N\u00e9stor Kirchner\u2019s administration.\n\nCristina Kirchner (@CFKArgentina) Vieron?!! Yo les dije que era un machirulo \ud83d\ude44 https://t.co/WgOFSTB338\n\nThe surprise move effectively disarmed Macri\u2019s strategy to portray the election as a choice between a safe pair of hands (himself) and a power-hungry, polarizing woman who was relishing the prospect of a return to the highest office in the land.\n\nAlthough Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner is likely to call the shots, analysts say that the promise that her fiery spirit will be tempered by Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s even keel seems to have appealed to middle-class voters disenchanted with Macri.\n\nFern\u00e1ndez has assured voters he would steer an even course in economics, seeking a friendly agreement with the IMF and avoiding the return of the kind of currency controls imposed during Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner\u2019s government.\n\nHis promise is meant to assuage the doubts of middle-class voters in a country where banks offer dollar accounts to protect savings from Argentina\u2019s perennial inflation.\n\nIf Pi\u00f1era wants to wage war in Chile he should fight the real enemy: inequality | Crist\u00f3bal Rovira Kaltwasser Read more\n\nBrazil\u2019s rightwing president, Jair Bolsonaro, has described Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, and her running mate as \u201cleftwing bandits\u201d and warned that her likely return to office means \u201cArgentina is starting to head in the direction of Venezuela.\u201d\n\nBut the election comes at a time of political turmoil across Latin America \u2013 much of it fueled by popular rage at austerity measures and income inequality.\n\nEcuador saw two weeks of violence over the cancellation of fuel subsidies. Across Argentina\u2019s northern border, the Bolivian Evo Morales\u2019s controversial bid for a fourth term as president has prompted allegations of voter fraud, while to the west, Macri\u2019s close ally, Chile\u2019s President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era, has been accused of violently suppressing protests over poverty and inequality.\n\nIn a radio interview on Wednesday, Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner\u2019s running mate accused Macri of downplaying the deaths and violence in Chile. \u201cPeople reacted because it\u2019s the most unequal country in Latin America. And inequality is like sitting on a bucket of petrol, if a spark falls, you blow up.\u201d", "description": "She was vilified when she left office in 2015 \u2013 but polls say the former president and Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez are likely to oust Mauricio Macri", "authors": ["Uki Go\u00f1i"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56f24239edbbca9b530cff350b0b1030aad53690/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=74fdd25c3eef58d0fa7fd8597cc9a198", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
