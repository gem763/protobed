This is not a strategically important location to the most powerful nation in the world.'\n\nSenior Chief Petty Officer Shannon Kent (above) who was killed at the age of 35 in Manbij, northern Syria in January of this year\n\nRussian military police members stand outside an armoured vehicle along a road in the countryside near the northeastern Syrian town of Amuda in Hasakeh province on October 24, 2019, as part of a joint patrol between Russian forces and Syrian Kurdish Asayish internal security forces near the border with Turkey\n\nJoe Kent, who was married to mother-of-two Shannon Kent, 35, insists Donald Trump was right to withdraw troops from northern Syria\n\nWhile Kent says he understands the 'frustrations' of his brothers and sisters in arms who fought alongside the Syrian Kurds he believes there isn't a sustainable victory to be had there. He now believes that without 'sober, pragmatic civilian leadership, this mentality is the essential recipe for endless war'.\n\nKent, who spent more than 20 years in Special Operations and completed 11 combat deployments, goes on to say that President Trump is fulfilling his obligation to the American people to destroy the territorial caliphate and leave.\n\nWife Shannon died six weeks into her fifth deployment after a suicide bomber detonated their vest in a busy market area in Manbij, northern Syria. Three others died in the blast on January 16.\n\nDuring her military career she had served as a member of Navy Seal teams and as a part of other special operations.\n\nShe was described on Military.com as a talented linguist, intelligence analyst and cryptologist, who spoke fluent Arabic.\n\nIn his article, her husband cautioned against the loss of 'precious American blood' and said he believed that pundits discussing America's involvement in Syria are missing concerns for a larger fight against Russia and Iran.\n\nHe wrote: 'Russia needs Assad to remain in power so it can maintain its Mediterranean naval base in Syria.\n\n'If Assad falls, Russia loses its access to the Mediterranean, which is Europe's southern flank.\n\nSchumer wants to have the Navy service member Shannon Kent (above left and left in the right picture) honored by naming one of the U.S. Navy ships named after her.

She beat thyroid cancer in between pregnancies and had hoped to study clinical psychology. She was rejected from the advancement opportunity due to her cancer history, and was instead sent on her fatal fifth deployment. During her military career she had served as a member of Navy Seal teams and as a part of other special operations. Shannon Kent enlisted in 2003, inspired by her father and uncle who were both first responders that were called to action at the World Trade Center on 9/11. She was described on Military.com as a talented linguist, intelligence analyst and cryptologist, who spoke fluent spoke Arabic. Senator Chuck Schumer described her as a 'pioneer' in the special operations community, who paved the way for many other women. He said: 'Senior Chief Kent was living proof that women could not only keep up with but lead, our nation's most highly-trained and capable service members. 'Her courageous efforts and groundbreaking achievements have inspired numerous programs for integrating women into Special Operations Forces, with combat jobs and special operations training now open to female service members.' Schumer proposed the amendment to the Fiscal 2020 National Defense Authorization Act, that will be taken to congress later this month.\n\n'Iran needs Assad to retain power in order to keep Iran's land bridge, a territorial corridor, between Iraq and Lebanon.\n\n'In this way, Iran can control the region's Sunnis and threaten Israel and Saudi Arabia.'\n\nHe argues that by being too concerned with 'fondness' for the Kurds, the US has lost sight of its war against Putin's Russia and the Islamic civil war between the Sunnis and Shia.\n\nAnd he believes that Russia is willing to support an unpopular regime in order to win Syria.\n\nKent writes: 'When the dust settles, we will have to confront Russia, and the winner of the Islamic civil war may come for the West as well.'\n\nThe tanks would allow the U.S. to ensure oil-rich areas are kept out of the hands of Iran or ISIS\n\nHe believes that ever since its revolution in 1979, Iran has shown its true intentions by committing terrorist attacks against US embassies in Beirut and Kuwait, hijacking airlines in Europe and attacking US soldiers in Iraq.\n\nKent believes that the next phase of conflict will be fought between US enemies - the radical Sunnis from ISIS and Turkish-backed jihadists fighting Iranian-backed Shia militias.\n\nHe said: 'My wife gave her life for this fight and I spent my adult life in this fight. It is incredibly painful to admit that we have not been successful with so much lost, but to double and triple down on losing strategies dishonors our fallen and our country.'", "description": "Gold Star husband Joe Kent said the US only partnered with Syrian Kurds to defeat ISIS and insists America now has 'absolutely nothing to gain' from being in the region.", "authors": ["Isabella Nikolic For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/17/20189394-0-image-a-123_1572022054908.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
