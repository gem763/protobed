(Jordan Gale/Reuters)\n\nFormer vice president Joe Biden accused President Trump on Wednesday of \u201csquandering\u201d the strong economy he inherited from the Obama administration,\n\n\u201cDonald Trump inherited a strong economy from Barack and me,\u201d Biden said during a campaign speech in his hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania. \u201cThings were beginning to really move. And just like everything else he\u2019s inherited, he\u2019s in the midst of squandering it.\u201d\n\nDuring the speech, Biden emphasized his middle class background and touted his public option healthcare plan as well as his plan to slash the cost of higher education. He also dismissed the Trump economy\u2019s low unemployment, which has fallen to a 50-year low of 3.5 percent.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to restore the middle class, you\u2019re going to need to start to reward work again, not just wealth,\u201d the 2020 presidential contender said. \u201cGo back to your old neighborhoods, ask them how they\u2019re doing, how they\u2019re feeling. They\u2019re in trouble.\u201d\n\nThe former vice president argued the Trump administration\u2019s 2017 tax cuts have benefited the wealthy and not middle and lower-class Americans and pledged to hike the corporate tax rate from 21 percent to 28 percent.\n\nThe corporate rate stood at 35 percent before the tax cuts.\n\n\u201cThe wealthy didn\u2019t need [tax cuts] in the first place. The corporations have spent them on stock buybacks,\u201d Biden said.\n\nBiden\u2019s speech came hours before Trump is scheduled to speak to Pennsylvanians in Pittsburgh.\n\n\u201cHe said he\u2019s working for the forgotten American. But he forgot about the forgotten American,\u201d the former vice president said of Trump.\n\nFormer president Barack Obama won Pennsylvania, a swing state, in 2008 and 2012, but Trump snagged the state\u2019s 20 electoral votes in 2016.", "description": "The former VP argued the Trump administration's 2017 tax cuts have benefited only wealthy Americans and pledged to hike up the corporate tax rate.", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle", "Tobias Hoonhout", "Kevin D.
