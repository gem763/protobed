Did no one tell her that, given she was filmed and recorded in 2016 saying David Cameron\u2019s own resignation honours list \u201cmade her retch\u201d, she would be somewhat exposed doing her own, identical, arguably even more egregious one?\n\nPresumably no one did, because it would have been either Nick Timothy or Fiona Hill\u2019s job to do that, and she had to sack them in 2017 for their role in running the worst general election campaign of modern times, wrecking her career, her party and indeed her country.\n\nIt would have been their job to tell her, for example, not to give both of them CBEs, but because she sacked them, no one did.\n\nIf Nick Timothy, in particular, had he still been around, might have been able to advise her that giving Nick Timothy a CBE would be a very foolish move, because Nick Timothy has spent the last two years writing weekly newspaper columns blaming her for various things for which he was sacked.\n\nIf you really wanted to, you might be prepared to defend David Cameron\u2019s resignation honours list, in that his entirely reckless gamble ended their careers, and thus a few letters after their names might perhaps be of some vague comfort whilst staring at the phone and hoping it might ring.\n\nTheresa May, on the other hand, has ennobled the people who finished her off. It is not a mistake you can imagine her hero, Sir Geoffrey Boycott, making.\n\nProrogue all that then. And prorogue indefinitely the House of Commons.\n\nProrogue the Labour Party, and its MPs writing the word \u2018SILENCED\u2019 on pieces of paper and waving them about in the chamber of the House of Commons at 1am.\n\nProtest is the recourse for those who do not have political power. There is an election that\u2019s not happening and a no-deal Brexit that\u2019s been delayed, at least for the time-being, that will show you the Labour Party still has plenty of it.\n\nThey don\u2019t want you to know about that though, that\u2019s why Jeremy Corbyn has already started campaigning for the election he himself blocked. So prorogue him as well.\n\nProrogue the SNP. All they want to do is prorogue the United Kingdom, so prorogue them at once. Prorogue the Brexit Party, the grandest political con there has ever been. It has somehow convinced several million people that no-deal Brexit is in their interests, while knowing full well that the moment those people find out the truth will be the moment it is too late.\n\nProrogue the Lib Dems, who\u2019ll take absolutely anyone, illiberal, anti-democrat or otherwise. Prorogue the Greens. I don\u2019t know why, but there\u2019s bound to be a reason, there always is.\n\nProrogue the Queen. She\u2019ll only un-prorogue everything if you don\u2019t.\n\nProrogue Jacob Rees-Mogg, while we\u2019re here. Prorogue his suits that don\u2019t fit and his made-up voice.\n\nProrogue John Bercow, prorogue \u201cchuntering from a sedentary position\u201d, prorogue \u201cpettifogging objections\u201d, prorogue \u201csoothing medicaments\u201d, prorogue it all as a matter of public emergency.\n\nProrogue the negotiations that aren\u2019t even happening. Prorogue Boris Johnson, prorogue every word that escapes from his unbearable gob, not one of which has been true in the last six abysmal weeks.\n\nProrogue the backstop, prorogue the withdrawal agreement. Prorogue the people as well. They voted for all this.\n\nProrogue the second referendum, prorogue the first referendum. Bring back David Cameron and prorogue him immediately.\n\nProrogue it all up and prorogue away the key.\n\nAll of British politics, every last bit of it is in absolutely dire need of prorogation. And do not de-prorogue until it\u2019s had a long, desperate look at itself and promised to do better. Then prorogue it again.", "description": "Oh just prorogue everything.
