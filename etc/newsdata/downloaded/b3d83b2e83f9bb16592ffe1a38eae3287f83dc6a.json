Also, some companies were affected by slowing demand for chips. That wasn't good for Korea, which is heavily reliant on IT exports.\"Bio companies on the secondary tech-heavy KOSDAQ have also seen a greater degree of volatility.They include Kolon TissueGene, which was suspended from trading in late May due to its controversial gene therapy Invossa.More firms involved in the 5G tech sector made their debut in the KOSDAQ's top ten, including KMW, a local manufacturer of wireless communication equipment.Yoon Jung-min, Arirang News.", "description": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc744 \ub300\ud45c\ud558\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubc29\uc1a1!
