(AP Photo/M. Spencer Green)\n\nReporting by Ben Taylor, GRAPHIQ.\n\nIn the month since the Umpqua Community College shooting in Oregon \u2014 in which a 26-year-old man killed eight students and a professor \u2014 Congress has turned not to gun control, but mental health.\n\nSix days after the shooting, Rep. Martha McSally, R-Arizona, sponsored the Mental Health and Safe Communities Act, a bill first introduced by Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, in the Senate. Backed by the National Rifle Association, the law would \u201cenhance the ability of local communities to identify and treat potentially dangerous, mentally-ill offenders,\u201d as well as \u201chelp fix the existing background check system\" according to Sen. Cornyn\u2019s press release. The bill has gone on to receive bipartisan support, a rare feat in today\u2019s polarized congressional climate.\n\nWhile the bill certainly has its critics \u2014 some argue that the legislation would ultimately weaken the current system \u2014 the legislation\u2019s broad support sends a clear signal: Congress believes addressing mental health concerns, not enacting stricter gun control, will serve as the best response to the latest round of gun violence. But does the data support this decision?\n\nRecently, we evaluated President Obama\u2019s claim that \u201cstates with the most gun laws have the fewest gun deaths.\u201d With all types of gun deaths included, including suicide, he\u2019s right. But several other factors complicate the president\u2019s statement. When you remove suicides, the correlation still holds, but becomes much weaker. If you count only by mass shootings, the correlation disappears \u2014 for example, California has more than its fair share of mass shootings (nine since 1984) despite having the strictest gun laws in the nation. Still, there\u2019s enough data to suggest that gun violence does indeed tend to drop alongside stricter gun laws.\n\nDoes the same trend hold for mental health? At HealthGrove, we wanted to perform a similar study, this time looking at the correlation between rates of serious mental illness and gun deaths on a state-by-state basis. The data comes from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.\n\nWe see the highest rates of mental illness in Utah, Arkansas, West Virginia and Vermont. The Pacific Northwest, Rust Belt and Bible Belt also exhibit higher-than-average rates. Meanwhile, California, Illinois, New Jersey and Connecticut have among the lowest rates of serious mental illness.\n\nNow consider firearm-related deaths:\n\nThe picture here is mixed. Big states like California, Texas and New York seem to confirm Congress\u2019 hypothesis, as each state features a low rate of mental illness next to a low rate of firearm-related death. But several more states fly against the theory. Oregon, Washington, Colorado and Vermont all boast mid to low rates of firearm deaths, despite having high rates of mental illness.\n\nBut what about the same map with suicides removed, as advocated by the Washington Post? Here, we turned to data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\nWith this map, there\u2019s even less evidence to suggest that mental illness and firearm murders go hand in hand. In fact, for several regions, the opposite trend emerges: namely, that low rates of mental illness tend to accompany high rates of firearm-related homicide. The discrepancy is particularly notable in the West, the South and the Northeast.\n\nData from the National Center for Health Statistics further refutes the connection between mental health and gun deaths. According to its database, fewer than 5 percent of the 120,000 gun-related killings from 2001 to 2010 were committed by people diagnosed with mental disorders. In fact, as John Oliver pointed out on his HBO program \u201cLast Week Tonight,\u201d mentally ill people are much more likely to be gun victims, not perpetrators.\n\nSo why is Congress so focused on mental health when it comes to addressing gun violence?\n\nFor one, mental health is a safe and popular issue, particularly compared to gun control. Nearly all Americans agree that mental health is a problem, and over 70 percent believe the nation needs to make \u201csignificant\u201d or \u201cradical\u201d changes. In contrast, less than half of Americans support stricter gun laws.\n\nNext, mass shooters routinely come across as mentally ill in the news \u2014 their diaries, plots and final statements subject to hours of media analysis and social media discussion. Trained psychiatrists might tell us that a given shooter was sane, but to the average American, anyone who commits a mass murder qualifies as mentally disturbed.", "description": "In the month since the Umpqua Community College shooting in Oregon \u2014 in which a 26-year-old man killed eight students and a professor \u2014 Congress has turned not to gun control, but mental health.
