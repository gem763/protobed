You'll need to be logged into Google.\n\nOn the upper left drop-down menu, go to 'Activity Controls.' Turn off both 'Web & App Activity' and 'Location History.'\n\nThat should prevent precise location markers from being stored to your Google account.\n\nGoogle will warn you that some of its services won't work as well with these settings off.\n\nIn particular, neither the Google Assistant, a digital concierge, nor the Google Home smart speaker will be particularly useful.\n\nOn iOS\n\nIf you use Google Maps, adjust your location setting to 'While Using' the app. This will prevent the app from accessing your location when it's not active.\n\nGo to Settings Privacy Location Services and from there select Google Maps to make the adjustment.\n\nIn the Safari web browser, consider using a search engine other than Google.\n\nUnder Settings Safari Search Engine, you can find other options like Bing or DuckDuckGo.\n\nYou can turn location off while browsing by going to Settings Privacy Location Services Safari Websites, and turn this to 'Never.'\n\nThis still won't prevent advertisers from knowing your rough location based on IP address on any website.\n\nYou can also turn Location Services off to the device almost completely from Settings Privacy Location Services.\n\nBoth Google Maps and Apple Maps will still work, but they won't know where you are on the map and won't be able to give you directions.\n\nEmergency responders will still be able to find you if the need arises.\n\nOn Android\n\nUnder the main settings icon click on 'Security & location.' Scroll down to the 'Privacy' heading. Tap 'Location.' You can toggle it off for the entire device.\n\nUse 'App-level permissions' to turn off access to various apps.\n\nUnlike the iPhone, there is no setting for 'While Using.'\n\nYou cannot turn off Google Play services, which supplies your location to other apps if you leave that service on.\n\nSign in as a 'guest' on your Android device by swiping down from top and tapping the downward-facing cursor, then again on the torso icon.\n\nBe aware of which services you sign in on, like Chrome. You can also change search engines even in Chrome.\n\nTo delete past location tracking on any device\n\nOn the page myactivity.google.com, look for any entry that has a location pin icon beside the word 'details.'\n\nClicking on that pops up a window that includes a link that sometimes says 'From your current location.'\n\nClicking on it will open Google Maps, which will display where you were at the time.\n\nYou can delete it from this popup by clicking on the navigation icon with the three stacked dots and then 'Delete.'\n\nSome items will be grouped in unexpected places, such as topic names, google.com, Search, or Maps.\n\nYou have to delete them item by item. You can wholesale delete all items in date ranges or by service, but will end up taking out more than just location markers.", "description": "The image would have likely remained undetected if it were not for an eagle-eyed Google user who spotted the couple before plastering their embrace in Taichung across social media.", "authors": ["Jack Elsom For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/17/19307288-0-image-a-27_1570207886285.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
