(Picture: Dom Lever/John Phillips/ Getty)\n\nMost contestants who leave Love Island keep their water bottles as memorabilia but Dom Lever decided it would be a great idea to keep the condoms instead.\n\nThe former Islander, who appeared on the ITV2 show in 2017, still has the contraceptive the show\u2019s bosses gave him two years ago and we\u2019re wondering if he\u2019s been keeping it in his wallet to gather dust.\n\nThe 28-year-old took to his Instagram story to twirl the condom packet in his hand, and of course, it is emblazoned with the iconic gold heart.\n\nHe captioned the post: \u2018Love Island memories.\u2019\n\nDom spoke to the camera: \u2018So I was just going through our wardrobes as you can tell from the mess.\n\n\u2018Look what I found! Thought I was gonna get lucky.\u2019\n\nHis wife Jess Shears is all of us when she could be heard retorting: \u2018With who though, that\u2019s the question.\u2019\n\nThat thing has turned to dust by now (Picture: Dom Lever)\n\nThe model and influencer met his wife Jess on the set of Love Island in 2017 but got booted off the show early.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince then, the two got married and have just welcomed their first baby.\n\nThe couple met two years ago (Picture: Ken McKay/ITV/REX)\n\nMeanwhile, the Love Island condoms weren\u2019t the only things Dom rediscovered.\n\nThe star recently brought back his youth with an \u2018amazing\u2019 hair transplant after going under the knife to restore his receding hairline.\n\nDom visited Manchester\u2019 KSL Clinic for the treatment, with the specialist surgery having previously treated stars including Gareth Gates, Jake Quickenden and Love Island\u2019s Alex Beattie.\n\nFilming the process for MailOnline, he documented the second stage of his procedure with KSL\u2019s Dr Matee, admitting that the experience had so far been virtually pain-free.\n\nWe can\u2019t wait to find out the baby\u2019s name (Picture: @jessica_rose_uk/Instagram)\n\n\u2018Other than the anaesthetic going in, I didn\u2019t feel a single thing,\u2019 Dom said. \u2018Now it\u2019s just putting [the hairs] into the front of my head. I can\u2019t wait to get finished really.\u2019\n\nComing back post-surgery, the new dad told the cameras: \u2018That\u2019s me done for the day, had the hair transplant as you can see. It\u2019s been amazing, literally took half the time I thought it would.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe continued: \u2018Everyone here\u2019s been amazing, made me feel super welcome, and I literally didn\u2019t feel a thing.\u2019\n\nCongratulations, Dom, for welcoming a baby, boosting your self confidence and finding memorable condoms all in two weeks.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
