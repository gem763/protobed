We are all Pierre Delecto.", "language": "en", "text": "I\u2019m also pretty sure Romney is a great guy, even if the senator\u2019s politics are different than mine, which is why I find it especially telling that his bizarre anonymous Twitter account was so very silly.\n\nFor all the years of stately self-presentation, disciplined rhetoric, and neatly coiffed hair, Romney is just another boomer who uses social media to yell at Fox News. For all Romney\u2019s connections and all his power, he, too, still feels compelled to devote precious time to airing grievances online\u2014even when nobody is watching!\n\nThis is the damage Twitter hath done. It is a time suck, irresistible even to those with the least to gain. Romney\u2019s sad, secret account reveals something about Twitter\u2019s strategic reliance on human nature: we all just want to be heard, and social media affords us that catharsis. So powerful is this catharsis, even Mitt Romney, a man with a Senate office and the means to build a car elevator, chases its fleeting satisfaction.", "description": "", "authors": ["Emily Jashinsky", "Thefederalist.Com Its-Not-Just-Mitt-Romney-We-Are-All-Pierre-Delecto"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
