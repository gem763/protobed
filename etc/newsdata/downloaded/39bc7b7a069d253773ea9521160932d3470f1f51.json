And if trends continue, researchers argue, cancer could become the leading cause of death worldwide in a matter of decades.\n\nMAN DIAGNOSED WITH RARE SYPHILIS INFECTION IN BRAIN AFTER STRUGGLING TO WALK, TALK\n\nFor the study, researchers analyzed data on diseases and death among 162,534 adults aged 35 to 70 from 21 countries across five continents from the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) from 2005 to 2016.\n\nThe countries where the participants were from were divided into three sections \u2014 low-income, middle-income, and high-income. Low-income countries included: Tanzania, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Zimbabwe. Middle-income countries consisted of Iran, South Africa, Philippines, Colombia, China, Brazil, Malaysia, Turkey, Poland, Argentina, and Chile. And the richest countries included Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Sweden, and Canada.\n\nThough one of the world's wealthiest countries, the United States was not involved in the study.\n\nIn middle- and high-income countries, medicines to treat and prevent heart disease may be behind the decline in the number of cardiovascular disease-related deaths.\n\n\u201cThe number of deaths associated with cardiovascular disease has decreased, particularly in [high-income countries], because of the implementation of preventive and therapeutic measures,\" said the report.\n\nILLINOIS BABY HAS 5-INCH TUMOR REMOVED FROM NECK HOURS AFTER BIRTH\n\nThe same is not true for cancer-related deaths because there have been fewer effective therapies for preventing and treating cancer, researchers said.\n\n\u201cThe high rates of cardiovascular disease and related mortality in low-income countries are likely related to gaps in access to, or availability of, healthcare. This was shown by the lower use of preventive medications and less frequent hospitalization for cardiovascular disease. Improving access to quality healthcare is key to reducing deaths from cardiovascular and other diseases in low- and middle-income countries,\u201d Professor Salim Yusuf, senior author of the study and Principal Investigator of PURE, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cAs cardiovascular disease declines in many countries, cancer mortality is likely to become the leading cause of death in the future,\u201d he added.\n\nFox Business' Jeanette Settembre contributed to this report.", "description": "Cancer has topped heart disease as the biggest killer in some of the world's richest countries, a new study found.", "authors": ["Madeline Farber", "Madeline Farber Is A Reporter For Fox News.
