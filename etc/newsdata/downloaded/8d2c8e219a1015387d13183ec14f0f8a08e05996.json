Currently, the indices are in positive territory and are ignoring the issue despite the heated rhetoric from various politicians.\n\nSince the day Donald Trump was elected, there have been pundits that have wrongly predicted his impact on the stock market. Some were predicting an immediate crash and suffered catastrophic losses when the market blasted higher on the day after the election. Similar disasters occurred during the Obama years when those that opposed him politically kept trying to apply political logic that the market totally ignored.\n\nThe point is that traders and investors must take great care when trying to predict the market when they have strong political views. The market does not share our political beliefs no matter what they might be. It moves on issues that are most important to it and those issues seldom coincide with the things that cause us to be emotional.\n\nThis morning I wrote a column entitled \" Impeachment Battle Matters More to Political Partisans Than Market Participants .\" Doug Kass's reaction to this column was as follows:\n\n\"I couldn't disagree more with Rev's conclusion (and header). This is about uncertainty, the economic consequences of possible delayed discussions on trade between the US and China, etc. This is about uncertainty seeping into the real economy. See my opener today HJ. All Rev does is express a view and really doesn't delve into how it might impact the trajectory of economic growth.\"\n\nI believe that Doug's view of the market today was likely colored by his political leanings. He wanted to believe that the impeachment issue was significant and that there would be a significant economic fallout as well as a market reaction. There is good logical reasoning for his view but ultimately it was premised on a certain view of the political situation.\n\nMy view was that the market really didn't care about politics and that there was no great uncertainty or economic impact. So far that view seems to be correct.\n\nThere is no doubt that Doug and I strongly disagree about many political matters. I try to deal with my political bias by staying very aware of it and trying to not let it color my thinking. It is not always easy to do. The most insidious bias is that which you are not aware of.\n\nSo now what? Does the impeachment issue still matter? It didn't matter much in the first place and it still doesn't matter much. What is driving this market has little to do with political opinions of Donald Trump. We still have to focus on China trade, central banks, interest rates, sector rotation, the dollar, and technical conditions.\n\nThe theme that is most important lately is that major headlines are not causing major movements in the indices.
