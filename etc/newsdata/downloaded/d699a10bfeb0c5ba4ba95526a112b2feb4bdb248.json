Economists polled by MarketWatch had forecast GDP to taper to 1.6%.\n\nRead: Weak unions, globalization not to blame for shrinking slice of income pie for workers\n\nWhat happened: Consumers keep doing their part to extend the longest economic expansion in American history, now more than 10 years old.\n\nAlthough consumer spending didn\u2019t match the second quarter\u2019s heady 4.6% increase, outlays still rose a very healthy 2.9%. Consumer spending accounts for about 70% of all U.S. economic activity.\n\nAmericans spent more on new autos, food, health care and housing.\n\nThe housing industry also contributed to the economy\u2019s growth for the first time in nearly two years. Residential investment climbed 5.1%. Tumbling mortgage rates have drummed up more demand and spurred builders to boost construction.\n\nBusinesses were not so confident. The festering trade war with China has disrupted supply lines, raised raw material costs and made companies hesitant to spend. Falling oil prices also curbed activity in the energy industry.\n\nInvestment in structures such as drilling rigs sank more than 15% in the third quarter, marking the biggest decline in almost four years. Spending on equipment such as computers and aircraft also fell a sharp 3.8%.\n\nYet somewhat surprisingly, businesses kept inventory levels fairly high. The change in inventories slipped to just $69 billion from $69.4 billion in the spring. Wall Street had expected a much bigger decline.\n\nGovernment spending, meanwhile, increased just 2% during the summer after an outsized 4.8% advance in the second quarter.\n\nInternational trade was another small drag. Exports rose 0.7% to partly rebound from a big drop in the second quarter, but imports rose somewhat faster at 1.2%.\n\nInflation pressures receded in the third quarter. The Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred PCE inflation barometer rose just 1.5%, down from a 2.4% clip in the spring.\n\nThe low level of inflation gives the Fed leeway to cut interest rates further. The central bank is widely expected to cut a key interest rate again later Wednesday.\n\nBig picture: GDP is the official measuring stick of the U.S. economy \u2014 and what it shows is steady if unspectacular growth.\n\nWhile tensions over international trade policy have unnerved businesses, consumers have mostly shrugged it off. Rising incomes, the ease of finding work and the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years have given consumers plenty of confidence to go about their lives and keep the economy moving along.\n\nThe U.S. and Chinese governments, for their part, have sought to lower tensions by returning to the bargaining table. The new round of talks this month has eased the anxiety on Wall Street, helping to push stocks to record highs.\n\nStill, businesses are likely to continue to be hesitant to spend and invest until they get more clarity on the outcome of U.S.-China trade talks. Economists predict GDP will grow about 2% in the fourth quarter as well.\n\nRead: Consumer sentiment shows Americans still fairly optimistic despite slowing economy\n\nMarket reaction: The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.03% and S&P 500 SPX, -0.10% were set to open slightly higher in Wednesday trades. The S&P set an all-time high earlier this week.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD10Y, -1.39% was unchanged at 1.82%.", "description": "Confident consumers kept the U.S. economy humming along in the third quarter, spending more than enough to counter a big drop in business investment tied to...", "authors": ["Jeffry Bartash"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU217_GDP_ec_ZG_20191029121521.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
