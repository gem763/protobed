Watching Atalanta humiliate Udinese on Sunday afternoon, it was tempting to wonder whether something similar might apply to football teams.\n\nBeaten 5-1 by Manchester City in midweek, the Bergamo club returned home to thrash their next opponent 7-1. They even allowed Udinese the illusory joy of scoring the first goal, just as they had experienced at the Etihad.\n\nIt was an astonishing result. Udinese arrived boasting the stingiest defence in all of Serie A, having conceded just six times in their previous eight games. A first-half red card to the defender Nicholas Opoku contributed, but Atalanta dazzled with the relentless tempo and directness of their attacks. Gian Piero Gasperini ended the day fending off journalists\u2019 questions about whether his team could challenge for the title. They sit just three points off first place, after Juventus, Internazionale and Napoli all drew, and have outscored every team except City (who have played a game more) across Europe\u2019s top five leagues.\n\nPremier Sports \ud83d\udcfa (@PremierSportsTV) \u26bd It's a second for Luis Muriel, and Atalanta are running riot against Udinese!\n\n\n\n4\u20e3-1\u20e3 to Gasperini's men pic.twitter.com/mnEE9k1VYV\n\nThis weekend, however, Gasperini had to share the limelight with his own coaching protege. Thiago Motta could not coax seven goals out of Genoa in his first game at the helm. But he did achieve something no other Serie A manager had ever done before: sending on three substitutes, who all went on to score.\n\nTrailing 1-0 at home to Brescia, Motta introduced Kevin Agudelo at half-time, Goran Pandev after 58 minutes and then Christian Kouam\u00e9 in the 65th. The last of those players hit the crossbar within seconds of entering the pitch. The first of them equalised a few moments after that.\n\nSigned from the Colombian club Atletico Huila in the summer, Agudelo had never made an appearance under Genoa\u2019s previous manager, Aurelio Andreazzoli. Motta\u2019s decision to offer him a debut here was justified as the player swept home a confident finish from Andrea Pinamonti\u2019s cut-back inside the box. Kouam\u00e9 scored next, meeting Paolo Ghiglione\u2019s cross with a spectacular scissor-kick. Their final goal came on the counter, Pandev exploiting the space left by an exhausted and overstretched Brescia team as he cut across Ales Mateju to bury a shot into the far corner.\n\nThis was a hugely important win for Genoa, who had begun the weekend second from bottom. They had taken just a single point from their final six games under Andreazzoli, and conceded 19 goals in eight matches overall. The mood at their Marassi stadium has been mutinous. Ultras left the northern stand empty for the first 10 minutes on Saturday, and a banner hung in that section warned that they could stay away for a whole season in future if nothing improved.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Christian Kouam\u00e9 was one of three Genoa substitutes to come off the bench and score in the 3-1 victory over Brescia.

Although popular during his time at Genoa as a player, his only coaching experience was a single season in charge of Paris Saint-Germain\u2019s Under-19s. He had been ridiculed in the Italian press last year for supposedly suggesting that his team\u2019s formation could be described as a 2-7-2, with the goalkeeper joining midfield.\n\nIn reality, Motta\u2019s words had been grossly misinterpreted. Asked which formation he preferred during an interview with Gazzetta dello Sport, he sought to make the point that the numbers do not really matter \u2013 since modern football is a fluid game in which a team must constantly readjust its shape.\n\nTo reinforce his point that formations themselves were abstract, Motta proposed that you could read a 4-3-3 formation as a 2-7-2 if you read it from left to right (ie: two players in the wide left zone, seven in the middle, two in the right) instead of going from back to front. None of which stopped the papers from comparing him to Oronzo Can\u00e0, the central character from cult 1980s football coaching parody L\u2019Allenatore nel Pallone, who proposed that his team line up in a 5-5-5.\n\nWhether Motta is ready to manage at this level, only time will tell. Although his substitutions worked out gloriously against Brescia, it is also true his initial team selection had flaws \u2013 with Ivan Radovanovic looking lost after being drawn back from his usual spot in midfield to play at centre-back, and Pinamonti underwhelming as a lone centre-forward. Genoa had almost 65% possession in the first half, but took a total of just four shots.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Thiago Motta marked his debut in the Genoa dugout with the club\u2019s first win in almost two months. Photograph: Simone Arveda/EPA\n\nMotta is not even fully qualified, and must continue to take courses at Coverciano in order to obtain his Uefa Pro licence. On the other hand, that may matter less in the long run than the insights he gained from working under the likes of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho at Inter and Carlo Ancelotti in Paris.\n\nPremier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A and Ligue 1 top scorers 2019-20 Read more\n\nHe won a treble with the former, as did Pandev. Asked about the experience of coaching a former teammate, Motta noted that the Macedonian has had no problem calling him \u201cMister\u201d \u2013 the Italian equivalent to \u201cBoss\u201d.\n\nIt is Gasperini, though, that Motta cites as the greatest influence on his coaching ideas. \u201cI learned so much from him,\u201d he said after taking the Genoa job. \u201cIt is an honour to be in charge of the team where he used to manage me.\u201d He would do well to follow in the footsteps of Gasperini, whose seven-and-a-half years in charge of Genoa \u2013 split across two stints \u2013 represent the most successful periods of the club\u2019s recent history. No other manager has even made it through a complete season in charge of the club since it returned to Serie A in 2007.\n\nFor now, it would be enough for Motta simply to steer Genoa away from the relegation zone. To take a team that has often been bullied this season, and teach it how to fight back.\n\nTalking points (to follow \u2026)", "description": "Inspired substitutions gave Thiago Motta a dream start in the dugout while Atalanta enjoyed a 10-goal swing from midweek", "authors": ["Nicky Bandini"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4feac94e00ee58658e4b13ba01fa20c7fa02e4c/0_10_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4a08526a9b87fa68ab3ee39f8a3f4e0a", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
