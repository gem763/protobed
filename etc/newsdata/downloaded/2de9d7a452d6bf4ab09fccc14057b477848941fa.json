This revenue helps to fund journalism across The Independent.\n\nThe high-tech system is super-easy to use and, unlike some security cameras, doesn\u2019t require reams of cable, a host of screens or a huge hard drive to function.\n\nInstead, this option from eufy can be attached using a simple magnetic mount, comes with a 16GB microSD card that stores up to one-year\u2019s worth of recordings and syncs with your smartphone for high-resolution live streaming of what the camera sees in real-time.\n\nThe wide-angle lens also provides a panoramic view, spanning from your driveway to the front door meaning that no spots are missed, while the weatherproof-rated system means it can be used both indoors and out.\n\nThe eufyCam has received a number of five-star reviews on Amazon with one person describing the quality as \u201cnext to none\u201d and another calling it \u201csimply brilliant\u201d.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
