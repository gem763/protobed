Fewer. It\u2019s often still so hard on the body.'\n\nIn the written piece, the Maleficent: Mistress Of Evil actress also mentioned that her grandmother succumbed to breast cancer, and that after her mother's death she discovered that she herself carried a gene that predisposed her to the disease as well.\n\nMemories: The actress wrote a candid article for Time Magazine, published Thursday, in which she discussed how her late mother's battle with breast and ovarian cancer affected her; seen here in 2001 with mom Marcheline\n\n'As I stood in the hallway of the hospital waiting for my mother\u2019s body to be collected and taken to be cremated, her doctor told me she had promised my mother that she would make sure I was informed about my medical options,' Jolie recalls in the essay.\n\nThose options included preemptive surgeries.\n\n'Women typically have a 13% risk of developing breast cancer over their lifetime. I had an estimated 87% risk of developing the disease and a 50% risk of ovarian cancer. Because of my high risk, experts recommended preventive surgeries,' she wrote.\n\nTo her credit, the Tomb Raider star was quite public about her surgeries, which took place in 2013 and 2015, thereby bringing further awareness to breast and ovarian cancer worldwide.\n\nActivist: In the written piece, the Salt actress mentioned that after her mother's death she discovered that she herself carried a gene that predisposed her to cancer; seen here last week in Paris\n\n'I had a double mastectomy and later removed my ovaries and fallopian tubes, significantly reducing, although not removing altogether, my risk of developing cancer.\n\n'I\u2019m often asked how my medical choices, and being public about them, have affected me,' she later wrote in the piece. 'I simply feel I made choices to improve my odds of being here to see my children grow into adults, and of meeting my grandchildren.'\n\nThe actress has six children with ex-husband Brad Pitt, including Maddox, 18, Pax, 15, Zahara, 14, Shiloh, 13, and 11-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne.\n\nIn her confessional essay, the actress was quite candid about the pain she still feels over the loss of her mother.\n\n'She met only a few of her grandchildren and was often too sick to play with them. It\u2019s hard now,' she wrote, '...when I think of how much their lives would have benefited from time with her and the protection of her love and grace.\n\n'My mother fought the disease for a decade and made it into her 50s. My grandmother died in her 40s. I\u2019m hoping my choices allow me to live a bit longer.\n\n'I need to get regular health checkups. I see and feel changes in my body, but I don\u2019t mind,' Jolie continued. 'I\u2019m alive, and for now I am managing all the different issues- I inherited-. I feel more connected to other women, and I often have deeply personal conversations with strangers about health and family.'\n\nBack in the day: In her confessional essay, Jolie was candid about the pain she still feels over the loss of her mother; seen here in a file photo with Jolie's godmother, actress Jacqueline Bisset (right) in 2001\n\nIt is at this point in the article where Angelina addresses wider issues affecting women on a global scale, beyond medical care in relation to cancer treatment.\n\n'I have learned that when it comes to women\u2019s health, medical advances are only one part of the picture. Mental and emotional health, and physical safety, are just as important,' she wrote.\n\n'Without that there may be a false sense that a woman is being cared for, when in fact she is falling apart because of other pressures in her life that receive no attention at all. I understand now that we often focus on the specific cancer or illness affecting a particular woman, but miss the bigger diagnosis: her family situation, her safety and whether she is carrying stress that is undermining her health.\n\n'All medical discoveries that extend our lives are welcome. But the bodies we are hoping to heal also need to be respected and spared preventable harm,' the actress and humanitarian concluded. 'Only if we feel safe and cared for are any of us able to reach our full potential.'", "description": "Angelina Jolie is using her own family medical history and experiences to shed light on advancements in cancer research, treatment and women's health and rights worldwide.", "authors": ["Dan Heching For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/21/20152852-0-image-a-17_1571949502670.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
