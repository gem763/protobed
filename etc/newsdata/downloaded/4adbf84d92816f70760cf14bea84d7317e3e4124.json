(As the authors show, he was also an ardent Nazi. But that\u2019s another story.)\n\nIn the case of SS Gen. Hans Kammler, the subject of \u201cThe Hidden Nazi,\u201d the authors believe a similar escape was possible, for similar reasons. The last SS general to be created during WWII, he was responsible for overseeing construction of the slave labor and concentration camps, personally altering the design of Auschwitz to make it a more efficient center of mass murder.\n\nHe was a favorite of Himmler\u2019s, and toward the end of the war, when Himmler persuaded Adolf Hitler to bring the guided missile program under SS control, Kammler was named head of all missile projects. In that capacity, in effect functioning as the official to whom von Braun and his fellow scientists reported, including scientists working on an atom bomb, it\u2019s probable that he had information worth trading for a timely disappearance.\n\nAt any rate, that\u2019s what he did \u2014 disappear, totally and completely. Shortly after the war ended, at the insistence of his wife, he was declared officially dead, with an aide testifying to his suicide in Czechoslovakia, but offering no proof of death, military or civilian, of any kind. Nor has a body ever been found.\n\nTumultuous times, to be sure. Nevertheless, it\u2019s hard to believe that the man who had become one of the several highest remaining officials in the Third Reich could simply disappear without significant help.\n\nAnd that, in effect, the seemingly total and unrecorded disappearance of one the world\u2019s last high-ranking Nazi war criminals \u2014 some say the third most powerful man in the Third Reich during the last days \u2014 is what set Dean Reuter, Colm Lowery and Keith Chester on the epic quest that structures this book.\n\nAs the historian Arthur Herman puts it, \u201cuntil now no one had the knowledge, persistence and sheer nerve that the authors brought to the job of unlocking the multiple mysteries surrounding this evil genius of the Third Reich. \u201c\n\nTo a great extent it\u2019s a massive document hunt, pulled together with buried, lost or forgotten records, articles, histories, personal recollections, interviews \u2014 including a personal interview with Kammler\u2019s remaining family by Dean Reuter \u2014 all blended and edited into a highly readable and coherent narrative, whether describing Nazi politics, the construction of killing machines or the various ways in which war criminals avoided justice.\n\nAmong their discoveries: Government documents from the period show that Kammler was in fact in American custody immediately after the war \u2014 for some time after his reported suicide. Was he intentionally kept shielded from public sight? Was there a deal made with the Nuremberg prosecutors by our government? If so, what was the quid pro quo? Did the material he traded appreciably benefit our armaments and space programs? And how and where did he assume his new identity?\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that German rocket expertise was further advanced than that of any other nation at the time, and members of their rocket team were highly prized by both our country and Russia. In fact, as \u201cThe Hidden Nazi\u201d points out, the Russians had sent paratroopers to kidnap von Braun after he\u2019d been taken into our custody. As the recovered document puts it, \u201cWhen Dr. von Braun was taken by American troops in May 1945, a detachment of Russian soldiers attacked American troops holding Dr. von Braun, in an attempt to take him from American power.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn insanely dangerous Russian action,\u201d as Dean Reuter describes it, and to my knowledge not an action known to most students of history. But it does demonstrate just how valuable both sides considered von Braun and his rocketry to be during those Cold War years. And it may also demonstrate why von Braun\u2019s boss, a much less savory character, was helped to find a country, probably somewhere south of the border, in which he\u2019d be given a new identity and allowed to live out his retirement years.\n\nIf so, let\u2019s hope his dreams were uneasy, and the justice meted out to Adolf Eichmann might have brought on nightmares.\n\n\u2022 John R.
