Her parents were distraught.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey wanted to know what was going on, and why their kid wanted to die,\u201d said Packard, a mental health therapist on the psychiatric unit who worked with her and her family.\n\nBut Washington is one of many states that carved out exceptions to the rights of parents to know about or consent to certain types of care their minor children receive, including mental health and drug and alcohol treatment as well as reproductive health services such as birth control and abortion.\n\nAdolescents age 13 and older were generally entitled to make their own decisions about their need for mental health services and to decide whether to allow their parents to be given any details about their condition, diagnosis or treatment.\n\nThis teen didn\u2019t want her parents to know, and she refused to see them or talk with them.\n\n\u201cAll I could tell them was that your kid is safe and we\u2019re doing everything we can,\u201d he said. \u201cThat didn\u2019t help them feel calmer or build the therapeutic alliance that\u2019s necessary to help the family system change.\u201d\n\nA state law that took effect in July makes it easier for parents to intervene. Whether that\u2019s a good thing depends on whom you ask.\n\nUnder the new law, teenagers can still decide on their own to see a mental health therapist or a substance use disorder counselor on an outpatient or inpatient basis.\n\nBut now parents have more say about outpatient care. They can take their teen to be evaluated and treated for a range of outpatient behavioral health care services, even if the child doesn\u2019t consent, as long as it\u2019s medically necessary care\u2015the kind a qualified clinician might reasonably expect would diagnose or alleviate a behavioral health problem, such as depression or drug addiction. Parents can also decide that their child must participate in up to 12 routine outpatient therapy sessions, provided a therapist thinks the sessions are necessary.\n\nAnother change: Parents can learn details about their adolescent\u2019s diagnosis and treatment for mental health problems, without the teenager\u2019s consent, if the behavioral health care provider believes that sharing information will benefit treatment and not be detrimental to the teen.\n\nThe law\u2019s provisions were shaped by recommendations from a work group established by the state legislature that included behavioral health care providers, advocates for children and parents.\n\nThe work group sought to balance the rights of young people and parents\u2019 need to access care for their kids, said Jaclyn Greenberg, policy director for legal affairs at the Washington State Hospital Association.\n\nThe result is a \u201creally strong\u201d compromise, said Peggy Dolane, who helped push for this change after running into roadblocks trying to get behavioral health care for her two kids.\n\n\u201cAt first, adversaries didn\u2019t understand that by [focusing on] protecting children\u2019s rights, it meant that parents couldn\u2019t protect their children,\u201d Dolane said.\n\nBut some behavioral health advocates are concerned that forcing anyone into treatment might be a losing strategy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure the solution is more compelled treatment,\u201d said Jennifer Mathis, director of policy and legal advocacy at the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law in Washington, D.C. If people don\u2019t choose treatment themselves, it\u2019s hard to get them to engage, she said. And compelling adolescents to get treatment carries an added risk.\n\n\u201cWith younger people, that is their first experience with [mental health] services, and if it\u2019s a bad one, that defines their experience for the rest of their lives,\u201d Mathis said.\n\nKathy Brewer, a mental health counselor and administrator at Seattle Children\u2019s Psychiatry and Behavioral Medicine Clinic who was part of the work group, defended the law, saying once adolescents start counseling and begin to see benefits, they generally engage.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m OK with taking away a little bit of civil rights on a short-term basis if it keeps someone alive,\u201d Brewer said. \u201cI\u2019d much rather have a resistant, alive youth than a dead one.\u201d\n\nEight years ago, Mary Hart decided she had to take action to get help for her daughter, Olivia Klco. When her mom picked up 15-year-old Olivia from their suburban Seattle home, Olivia thought she was going to the orthodontist. Instead, her mom headed four hours south to Portland, Oregon., and checked her into a psychiatric rehabilitation facility.\n\nOlivia had stopped going to school and was severely depressed, regularly cutting herself, drinking and smoking pot. She\u2019d been in therapy but it wasn\u2019t helping, and she was contemplating suicide.\n\nShe\u2019s not sure why she didn\u2019t fight her mom\u2019s decision but suggested that \u201cthe part of me that wanted to get help won that day.\u201d\n\nHart said, \u201cAs a parent you have to step in and say, \u2018I\u2019m not going to let you hurt yourself.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe movement among states to curb parental control of teens\u2019 care stems from concerns that requiring parental permission for care related to behaviors\u2015like having sex or doing drugs\u2015of which parents likely wouldn\u2019t approve, might keep young people from seeking help.\n\nIn addition, abused teenagers or those estranged from their parents may fear for their safety if they have to contact them before getting medical care.\n\n\u201cThe underlying incentive is always to encourage young people who need help to get it,\u201d said Abigail English, director of the Center for Adolescent Health & the Law, who has researched adolescent consent laws.\n\nEnglish said she\u2019s unaware of other states that are trying to pass laws similar to Washington\u2019s.\n\nHowever, \u201cthese kinds of things tend to spawn offspring in other states,\u201d she said.\n\nThe age at which adolescents can consent to different types of care on their own varies in state laws, but 13 or 14 is not uncommon. States also may have different parental notification requirements and spell out how much information can or must be shared with parents.\n\nIn most states, adolescents can consent to behavioral health treatment without their parents\u2019 permission, according to a 2015 study published in the Journal of Child & Adolescent Substance Abuse. It is more common for states to allow minors to agree to their own outpatient mental health or substance use treatment than to inpatient care, the study found.\n\nMany teens who need care don\u2019t receive it. In 2017, the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration estimated 4 percent of adolescents ages 12 to 17, or 992,000 people, had a substance use disorder. Only 0.7 percent received any type of treatment, though. In 2017, 13 percent of young people ages 12 to 17 had a major depressive episode and only about 42 percent of them got treatment, according to SAMHSA.\n\nThe new law doesn\u2019t fix everything, but it\u2019s an important step in the right direction, Dolane said. \u201cWe still have problems. We have a shortage of providers and clinicians. But the way it was before, you couldn\u2019t get your kid in to a provider even if they were available.\u201d\n\nKaiser Health News (KHN) is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.
