Debbie Allen was yet to find mainstream celebrity in the TV show Fame as Lydia Grant (and all her subsequent success as a multi-award winning actor, director, and choreographer). She had just appeared in the movie that preceded the TV show\u2014and been nominated for her first Tony Award, for her role as Anita in West Side Story.\n\nShe recalled to The Daily Beast one evening walking across Times Square with a producer from the show, \u201cwho I will let be nameless. He was talking about how great I was in West Side Story and this and that and the other, when he said, \u2018But you know Debbie, you just have to remember that you\u2019re black.\u2019\n\n\u201cAnd I was wondering, \u2018When did he think I ever forgot it?\u2019\n\n\u201cHe was letting me know I was probably not going to win the Tony Award, and said it in a way that I was not in any way thinking. I was quite shocked. I didn\u2019t say anything, and that was somebody who thought they were being supportive saying something that was very out there.\u201d (That year, Priscilla Lopez would win the Tony. Allen won the Drama Desk award for outstanding feature actress in a musical.)\n\nIt is 2019. Cynthia Meng went to an audition recently for a keyboard player in a major New York show. She was the only woman, and woman of color, in the room. \u201cEveryone else was white and male,\u201d Meng, an Asian-American professional musician and music director, told The Daily Beast. Having recently worked on the Tony-winning Hadestown\u2014with its diverse cast, musicians, and behind-the-scenes crew\u2014she had \u201cforgotten that this was the norm.\u201d\n\nThe composition of the room served as a reminder, despite all the fine words spoken these days around increasing diversity and inclusion, \u201cof how much work still needs to be done.\u201d\n\nThe experiences of women of color on Broadway span generations and professions. Candice Marie Woods, who plays Diana Ross in the Tony-winning Broadway hit Ain\u2019t Too Proud\u2014the Life and Times of the Temptations, recently came out, and wants to help other LGBTQ people as well as helping Broadway evolve in the characters it crafts for performers of color.\n\n\u201c Do I think that Broadway is an old bastion of white, patriarchal supremacy? Yes, but I think the entire culture is, so how is Broadway going to get away from where we are as a nation? It\u2019s not. I think we have to push it. \u201d \u2014 Dominique Morisseau\n\nShe told The Daily Beast she was one of the only black women in her classes when she trained as a dancer. \u201cIn musical theater I was the token black girl in a lot of productions. One of the good things was I got to learn to find my inner strength and own peace to be in that space where you feel different. Until Ain\u2019t Too Proud, I have never been in a musical where the whole cast, bar one actor, is black. It has been wonderful.\u201d\n\nThen there are the systemic issues of racism that Broadway inevitably encapsulates. \u201cDo I think that Broadway is an old bastion of white, patriarchal supremacy?\u201d mused Dominique Morisseau, Tony-nominated playwright of the book of Ain\u2019t Too Proud. \u201cYes, but I think the entire culture is, so how is Broadway going to get away from where we are as a nation? It\u2019s not. I think we have to push it.\u201d Cracks are appearing in this edifice, said Morisseau, \u201cbut how much is Broadway willing to risk and sacrifice to achieve true diversity?\u201d\n\nThat question remains to be confronted and answered\u2014and the women talk more deeply about their experiences below\u2014but increasingly women of color are building their own table rather than simply asking for a seat, almost 70 years since Juanita Hall became the first black performer to win a Tony Award in 1950 for her role in South Pacific.\n\nTwo sisters doing it for themselves\n\nIt all started in Jersey City, New Jersey. For sisters Victoria Velazquez and Alexia Sielo, music was a constant presence in their lives and home. Their mom was an R&B recording artist and their dad trained at Opera Ebony, America\u2019s longest surviving African-American opera company. Later, he would become his wife\u2019s manager.\n\nThe family attended Broadway shows and concerts together, and made three gospel albums together. The love of music would continue for the sisters, with Velazquez studying the business of the music industry at New York University while Sielo studied musical theater at New York Film Academy. Both have found that producers have sometimes fixed and stereotypical ideas of the characters they want people of color to fill on stage. Their father advised Sielo only to do roles she felt comfortable with.\n\nFrustrated by the limited opportunities on Broadway, where few shows featured women of color, Sielo expressed her concern to Velazquez about finding work. Velazquez, who is inspired by the producer Clive Davis, said a university course had taught her to make her own opportunities, and she wanted to help her sister do the same.\n\nOut of a mixture of frustration and desire for collective empowerment and change, the sisters co-founded the group Women of Color on Broadway. The group is meant to be many-purposed, providing both support and advocacy.\n\nThe sisters started with what they know best\u2014music, producing hour-long concerts that are meant to be fun but also provide an opportunity \u201cto look back at the African-American, Latin and Asian women before us who paved a way for other women of color, and diversity, on Broadway.\u201d (The sisters themselves have a mixed African-American and Puerto Rican heritage.)\n\n\u201c A lot of women and people of color are trying to create a community of coming together so they can come up as one to approach this, and try something new. It\u2019s the start of an evolution. \u201d \u2014 Victoria Velazquez\n\n\u201cA lot of women were trying to break into an industry traditionally filled with seasoned, mostly male professionals who are uncomfortable with change,\u201d Velazquez told The Daily Beast. \u201cA lot of women and people of color are trying to create a community of coming together so they can come up as one to approach this, and try something new. It\u2019s the start of an evolution.\u201d\n\nThe Women of Color on Broadway concerts\u2019 focus is on performers, while acknowledging\u2014as the group itself does in its membership\u2014the contributions of those \u201cbehind the desk,\u201d including writers, directors, and other creative backstage staff.\n\nThe concerts celebrate singers like Anne Brown, who played Bess in the original Porgy and Bess, and the Tony-winning, Grammy-nominated Melba Moore, the first black woman to replace a white actress (Diane Keaton) in a lead Broadway role (in Hair). Moore was also the first African-American woman to play Fantine in Les Mis\u00e9rables on Broadway. The show features other songs from modern and classic shows, including Hamilton and The Color Purple.\n\nVelazquez has been heartened to see diverse audiences at commercially successful shows like Hamilton and Ain\u2019t Too Proud. Both feature people of color prominently on and off stage. While the group is focused on outreach to people of color, Velazquez added that it \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t want conversations with white writers, male writers, and male producers. We\u2019re committed to women of color advancing their careers and presenting them with great career opportunities. In order to do that we need the voices and ears of everyone in the community.\u201d\n\nOccasionally the support from the theater community has surprised them. Velazquez recalled her sister telling her the story of a white actress who declined the offer to do a promotion of a show featuring a lot of people of color. \u201cShe told the producers that it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate, and that they should choose a person of color, which they did. That was very brave of her.\u201d\n\nVelazquez hopes the variety of roles will grow, that directors and producers will audition and cast widely. The future, she said, would hopefully be more \u201ccolorful,\u201d where the stage and audience are filled with as many different kinds of faces as her New York City neighborhood.\n\nCertainly, in recent seasons there have been positive signs on the stage, said Velazquez, such as the color-blind (or color-conscious) casting of Aisha Jackson as the understudy for Patti Murin\u2019s Anna in Frozen (Jackson made her first on-stage appearance as Anna in March 2018), and Brittney Johnson being the first woman of color to play Glinda in Wicked.\n\nNoma Dumezweni starred as Hermione in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, Nicolette Robinson played Jenna in Waitress, and Christiani Pitts played Ann Darrow in the critically savaged King Kong.\n\n\u201c It\u2019s maddening we\u2019re still having to express why the American landscape of storytelling should reflect the American landscape of human beings. \u201d \u2014 Christine Toy Johnson\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a slow process,\u201d said Velazquez. \u201cBut hopefully we\u2019ll get to a place where these casting choices are not a \u2018first time,\u2019 and just unimportant, and that women of color can just be cast as people, as any other actor. I hope it\u2019s not an isolated trend, but indicative of a wider shift and producers see it as their responsibility going forward. Producers have the money. I\u2019d say to them, \u2018Listen and be open.\u2019\u201d\n\nChristine Toy Johnson, chair of Equity\u2019s National EEO (Equal Employment Opportunity) Committee, recognizes the phenomenon of some producers and directors treating diversity as a box-ticking exercise, although she likes to think it may lead to more diverse casting. \u201cIf we get into the room both physically and philosophically, the teams of writers and directors and everyone else have to be open to seeing us and giving fair consideration to us.\u201d\n\nHowever, she added, \u201cIt\u2019s maddening we\u2019re still having to express why the American landscape of storytelling should reflect the American landscape of human beings.\u201d\n\nMartine Sainvil, spokesperson for The Broadway League, said ensuring true diversity on and off stage was \u201ca challenge the entire industry is working on. We\u2019re not there yet, but the effort is being put in to try to do better.\u201d Theaters and shows faced the \u201congoing challenge of reinforcing Broadway as an idea.\u201d Audiences needed to know shows were actually playing, marketing departments needed to target specific audiences.\n\nThe organization began its Broadway Bridges scheme in 2017 with the goal of ensuring every New York public high school student attends a Broadway show before they graduate.\n\nSainvil said plays with themes of diversity and diverse casts and characters attracted diverse audiences.\n\nBut while Broadway producers and financiers may be moved to finance such surefire blockbusters as The Lion King and Aladdin (both with significant people of color casts), it is not a guaranteed thing that they back more thematically challenging shows, or shows where there are not just people of color in the casts but leading that cast (or in significant roles), and whose character powers the narrative, and in which race/racism itself is a significant theme.\n\nThe dream is to have a breakout hit like Hamilton, or the buzzy presence of shows like Pulitzer Prize winner Lynn Nottage\u2019s Sweat, Choir Boy, Hadestown, Ain\u2019t Too Proud, and American Son. Tony winner Karen Olivo is playing Satine in Moulin Rouge!.\n\nNot every show is a critical or commercial success. And not every show has a star like Audra McDonald, who recently delivered a brilliant performance in Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune. (When McDonald won the Tony for Best Leading Actress in a Play for Lady Day at Emerson\u2019s Bar & Grill five years ago, she also became the first performer to win six Tony awards, and the first to win in all four acting categories\u2014in the leading and supporting categories for both plays and musicals.)\n\n\u201c Risk needs to be taken and attention needs to be given to audiences of color and younger generations of all backgrounds. \u201d \u2014 Dominique Morisseau\n\nThe star power of actors like McDonald sells tickets. Off-Broadway, future Broadway shows can seed and bloom, and there have been standout, people of color-led shows like the much-acclaimed Fairview, A Strange Loop, April Matthis\u2019 wonderful performance in Toni Stone, School Girls: Or the African Mean Girls Play, By the Way, Meet Vera Stark, Fabulation or, The Re-Education of Undine, and Slave Play, itself soon to open on Broadway. Tina\u2014The Tina Turner Musical will also open on Broadway this autumn.\n\nMorisseau, who pushed for a diverse marketing campaign when her show Pipeline was produced at Lincoln Center, said marketing companies needed to figure out new ways to sell shows to audiences of color.\n\n\u201cRisk needs to be taken and attention needs to be given to audiences of color and younger generations of all backgrounds,\u201d said Morisseau. \u201cBroadway has not tapped into the buying power of audiences of color, and how to approach them about buying those tickets. That\u2019s a failure.\u201d\n\n\u2018Representation within the underrepresented\u2019\n\nIssues of race and racism on Broadway are multi-layered, encompassing the challenges faced by those who work there on and off stage, as well as the kinds of plays being produced, financed, and seen on stages, the kinds of characters within those plays, and the composition of audiences going to see the productions.\n\nAccording to the most recent statistics from the 2017-18 season from The Broadway League, almost three-quarters of Broadway\u2019s audience is white, although it is (very slowly) becoming more diverse.\n\n\u201c Broadway is a racist industry and the entertainment industry is a racist industry, in the recording industry, in TV, and in Hollywood. \u201d \u2014 Victoria Velazquez\n\nDid Velazquez consider Broadway to be institutionally racist? \u201cYes, it\u2019s naturally racist because of the history we\u2019re trying to change. With something that\u2019s over 100 years old, you can\u2019t deny there\u2019s lot of racial tension, and Broadway is a racist industry and the entertainment industry is a racist industry, in the recording industry, in TV, and in Hollywood.\u201d\n\nWomen of Color on Broadway said that between 2008 and 2015 people of color represented less than 25 percent of the theater industry. Last year, 196 individuals were hired as directors, writers, choreographers, and designers for more than 130 Broadway shows. Of that total, only 13 percent of directors, 24 percent of choreographers, and 13 percent of writers were women.\n\nThe union Actors\u2019 Equity\u2019s first study of diversity, published in 2017, showed that women and members of color have fewer work opportunities, and often draw lower salaries when they do find work. The study examined the casts of new productions that opened between 2013 and 2015, covering Broadway and production tours as well as off-Broadway contracts.\n\nThe number of women of color who were classified as principals in plays, musicals, as members of the chorus, and as stage managers was dramatically lower than any other demographic.\n\nAn Actors\u2019 Equity spokesperson indicated that the study also found that women were underrepresented as principal in a play (women made up only 35 percent of contracts), principal in a musical (42 percent of contracts), and stage manager (37 percent of contracts). Women who find work also draw lower salaries in both principal in a musical and chorus contracts.\n\nCaucasians made up a majority of all onstage contracts\u2014principal in a play (65 percent of contracts), principal in a musical (66 percent of contracts), and chorus (57 percent of contracts). Caucasians were generally hired with higher contractual salaries. African-American members reported salaries 10 percent lower than the average in principal in a play roles, for example.\n\nSeventy-seven percent of stage manager contracts on the Broadway and production tours went to Caucasians. Over three years there were only six contracts given to African-American members.\n\nAn Equity spokesperson emphasized these were only Equity statistics. Without the campaigning and representational muscle of a union, \u201c it\u2019s not unreasonable to conclude the problem is more stark in non-Equity houses.\u201d (Actors\u2019 Equity is planning a second diversity study, most likely next spring.)\n\nAt this year\u2019s Women\u2019s Day on Broadway, Julia Jordan, playwright, screenwriter, founder, and co-executive director of the Lillys, presented statistics that simultaneously spanned the gamut of depressing to cautiously hopeful.\n\n\u201c In the first survey, just over 3.4 percent of work being produced in American theater was by women of color; that figure almost doubled in the second surveying period to 6.1 percent. \u201d\n\nThe Lillys, set up in 2010 to advocate for gender parity at all levels of theatrical production (and named after Lillian Hellman), oversees \u201cThe Count,\u201d a statistical analysis of women working in theater undertaken in partnership with the Dramatists Guild.\n\nThe analysis has been conducted twice, once from 2011 to 2014, and then from 2016 to 2017. In the first survey, just over 3.4 percent of work being produced in American theater was by women of color; that figure almost doubled in the second surveying period, to 6.1 percent.\n\nOf plays on Broadway, none were by women of color in the 1998-99 season, Jordan said. It was the same figure in the 2008-09 season, and in the 2018-19 season, of the eight shows by women on Broadway, two were by women of color; \u201crepresentation within the underrepresented,\u201d as Jordan put it, adding that there had been zero female directors of color this season.\n\nJordan noted that the U.S. Census estimates that the country is made up of 20 percent women of color; the same figure went for those receiving B.A. degrees in literature, B.A. degrees in performing arts, and new dramatists at the Playwrights Center. \u201cThere\u2019s no shortage of women of color in the pipeline\u2014until production,\u201d said Jordan. (The Lillys did not return a request for comment for this article.)\n\nThe most recent Asian American Performers Action Coalition\u2019s annual study of Ethnic Representation on New York City stages for the 2016\u201317 season revealed, as Playbill reported in March, that 95 percent of all plays and musicals were both written and directed by Caucasian artists.\n\nPlaybill reported: \u201cAfrican-American playwrights were represented at 4.1 percent and MENA playwrights at 1.4 percent. According to the survey, the Broadway season featured no plays or musicals by Latinx, Asian-American, or American Indian/Native/First Nation playwrights, nor playwrights with disabilities.\u201d\n\nOf all playwrights, 75.4 percent were male and 24.6 percent female. According to Playbill, \u201cEighty-nine percent of playwrights produced on Broadway were male and 11 percent female. Female directors fared only slightly better than female playwrights, representing 31.1 percent. Only 0.8 percent of directors included in the survey were non-binary.\u201d\n\nWorking in this environment, as the women of color who spoke to The Daily Beast made clear, can be challenging, frustrating, and also immensely fulfilling\u2014a roller coaster of experiences, good and bad.\n\nCandice Marie Woods: \u2018It feels like family, a unity we all share\u2019\n\nIn one production, which she declined to name, Candice Marie Woods had played the only black character and had her face cut from promotional materials. \u201cThe idea, I guess, was that I somehow didn\u2019t work for the target audience, and so my face wasn\u2019t needed, which was very discouraging and alarming.\u201d\n\nTo be included in such promotional activities would have made Woods feel as if all her effort had been worth it. \u201cActually,\u201d she corrected herself, \u201cthere were hurdles I jumped through and over other girls didn\u2019t, like painting my shoes a different color or having to find different foundations, or finding things that worked for my hair. Going that extra mile and not being included in the overall promotion of the show was hurtful.\u201d\n\n\u201c I didn\u2019t want to ever be seen as a \u2018difficult person,\u2019 because people of color get titled that too. \u201d \u2014 Candice Marie Woods\n\nBut Woods did not want to burn bridges, so she buckled down and worked. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to ever be seen as a \u2018difficult person,\u2019 because people of color get titled that too.\u201d\n\nConsidering the racism she has faced, Woods recalled the number of times directors have wanted her to be \u201csassy.\u201d At 21, it was \u201cthrilling\u201d to be on stage; it was only later that she questioned the number of \u201caggressive\u201d black roles she was asked to do.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of little micro-aggressions like that,\u201d Woods said. She would nod, did as she was told, then talk to other women of color for solace, strength, and to compare experiences. \u201cA lot of the time I was surrounded by people who did not look like me. I didn\u2019t always feel I had someone to turn to.\u201d\n\n\u201c It\u2019s beautiful not only to share this experience but to see these black men shine in their blackness and come through in one of the biggest hits on Broadway right now. I\u2019m extremely grateful for that. \u201d \u2014 Candice Marie Woods\n\nWorking in an almost all-black company in Ain\u2019t Too Proud, Woods said, was \u201cbeautiful. I used to pray for the moment to be in a production like this because I hadn\u2019t had that experience. It was everything I had prayed for and dreamed of. It\u2019s the college I never went to, and the sorority I was never part of. It feels like family, a unity we all share. We pray before every show, we lift each other up, share our experiences.\n\n\u201cA lot of people in this production I\u2019ve known for years. It\u2019s beautiful not only to share this experience but to see these black men shine in their blackness and come through in one of the biggest hits on Broadway right now. I\u2019m extremely grateful for that, and it\u2019s a complete contrast to the other experiences I have been in.\u201d\n\nTo see book writer Morisseau \u201cbehind the table\u201d was a powerful moment, Woods said, as \u201cI had never seen a black woman behind the table. It made me think, \u2018Oh, not only can I be here, I can be behind the table one day.\u2019 It gives that sense of confidence. Change is happening. It\u2019s subtle, but it\u2019s coming.\u201d\n\nDebbie Allen: \u2018I would feel remiss to say Broadway is racist\u2019\n\nDebbie Allen recalled first experiencing racism when she and her mother tried to get her into her ballet school of choice at 8. \u201cI was 14 when they finally let me come,\u201d Allen recalled. \u201cI was told I would never make it in this dance world, this ballet world at all, and that I should go into something different. That just wasn\u2019t true.\u201d Allen laughed. \u201cI did pretty good.\u201d\n\nWhen Allen was growing up, \u201ceverything was white-only in Texas and segregated. Growing up in Texas at that time, racism was part of everyday life. It\u2019s how we came into the world, dealing with that. But on the dance floor, everything is equal. It all comes down to what you do in that room.\u201d\n\n\u201c I knew that was code for \u2018We don\u2019t want any Black women in this show.\u2019 I was beyond qualified. I knew the person telling me that, who I ended up working with many years later, was following an edict from producers. I knew I would have to keep going. \u201d\n\nAllen finally got the place she deserved, embarked on a stellar career, and ultimately worked with the likes of Alvin Ailey, Martha Graham, Katherine Dunham, Bob Fosse, and Jerome Robbins. Her ballet mistress Tatiana Semenova \u201ckicked my ass all the time to become the dancer everybody came to love, and taught me the backbone of my balletic technique.\u201d\n\nBy the time Allen got to Broadway, she was an accomplished performer. At auditions in the early 1970s, she heard more than once, \u201cWe don\u2019t need any more brunettes in this show.\u201d Allen said, \u201cI knew that was code for \u2018We don\u2019t want any black women in this show.\u2019 I was beyond qualified. I knew the person telling me that, who I ended up working with many years later, was following an edict from producers. I knew I would have to keep going. It didn\u2019t stop me. I wouldn\u2019t let it stop me. It was a pause at most. Then I started working everywhere. The black community in theatre and the arts has always been very strong.\u201d\n\nAllen played Beneatha in Raisin, the musical adaptation of A Raisin in the Sun, which won the Tony Award for Best Musical in 1974, and Anita in West Side Story. Allen said that playing Puerto Rican was helped by her experience of living in Mexico with her mom and sister for a few years when younger.\n\nThat role was cast color-blind, as was her title role in Sweet Charity, directed by Bob Fosse in 1986, for which Allen won the Astaire Award for Best Dancer, and another Tony nomination.\n\n\u201cI remember Bob asking me, \u2018Debbie, do you want (her character\u2019s husband) Oscar to be black or do you care if he\u2019s white?\u2019 I said, \u2018I just want him to be good Bob.\u2019\u201d (The part went to white actor Michael Rupert.) In 2008, Allen made her Broadway directing debut, with an adaptation of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, starring Phylicia Rashad, James Earl Jones, Terrence Howard, and Anika Noni Rose.\n\nAllen recalled The Wiz opening on Broadway is 1975, and the reviews being \u201cscathing\u201d about Stephanie Mills, who played Dorothy, \u201cas if we had put Jesus back on the cross by having someone play what Judy Garland had played.\u201d\n\nBut The Wiz, an all-black retelling of The Wizard of Oz, \u201cwas something new, and Stephanie Mills was amazing and never to be rivaled in that role. The reviews said things about what she looked like as opposed to the amazingly gifted child she was, and how powerful and dynamic her voice was.\u201d (The Wiz\u2019s director, Geoffrey Holder, made Tony Award history to become the first African-American director to win Best Director of a Musical.)\n\nFosse also cast Ben Vereen in the original production of Pippin in 1973, Allen noted. \u201cBob was always looking for what was going to be dynamic, interesting, and challenging for the audience.\u201d\n\nRacism on Broadway, said Allen, was \u201cpart of a larger, older conversation about racism that has not been resolved in this country yet.\u201d She never felt isolated on Broadway, she said; but she recalled being the only black person in the room when choreographing Fame, and when she has directed, and while choreographing the Academy Awards for 10 years.\n\n\u201c Broadway is not racist. I would say there is always going to be people who have that mentality. We can\u2019t separate Broadway from the rest of the world. I want to see good theatre and creativity and really gifted and talented people do what they do\u2014white, Black, Asian, Latin, whatever. \u201d\n\nAllen\u2019s experience of theater is that it is more open than Hollywood and the world of television. She recalled the thrill of seeing color-blind casting in plays staged by Britain\u2019s Royal Shakespeare Company.\n\n\u201cI would feel remiss to say Broadway is racist. That would be horrible. My niece Condola Rashad played in A Doll\u2019s House, and played Saint Joan on Broadway. Broadway is not racist. I would say there is always going to be people who have that mentality. We can\u2019t separate Broadway from the rest of the world. I want to see good theatre and creativity and really gifted and talented people do what they do\u2014white, black, Asian, Latin, whatever. I think Broadway is very welcoming to black people and diversity.\u201d\n\nCynthia Meng: \u2018Seeing Asian people on stage would have been so inspiring to me as a kid\u2019\n\nCynthia Meng music-produced the last Women of Color on Broadway show, and was inspired to see the evolution of female artists of color through history. As an Asian-American, Meng has been asking herself about the kinds of stories she would like to see of her community, which is particularly poorly represented on Broadway.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t learn about musical theater from my family,\u201d Meng said. \u201cIt was not an artform my parents grew up with or experienced at home. Naturally, I didn\u2019t even know musical theater could be a career. So, for me, visibility and seeing Asian people in the arts on stage would have been so inspiring to me as a kid. I would have turned to this career a lot sooner and considered it a possibility. I want to see more now. I want to see other people who look like me on the stage.\u201d\n\nMeng\u2019s introduction to theater came via Glee, \u201cwhich had two Asian characters in it. \u2018Oh my gosh, that\u2019s new for me,\u2019 I remember thinking, as I watched them sing and be in this career that wasn\u2019t typical to see Asian actors in.\u201d\n\nMeng, who is 25 and a member of Women of Color on Broadway, said: \u201cI would say that I have been lucky to be in quite a few rooms with women and people of color. But I do think, behind the desk, there is a dearth of not just women but people of color and other underrepresented groups. There was one female director of a musical this season, and it was the awesome show I worked on\u2014Hadestown.\n\n\u201cIt was really great to see that be recognized (Rachel Chavkin won one of the show\u2019s seven Tonys, among many other awards). It\u2019s a little disheartening. In the end, the people behind the table are the gatekeepers and storytellers. We need diverse voices. Because of the way the teams are set up, we sometimes miss out on the perspectives of people who are part of the world and life. The team behind the desk should represent the diversity we want to see on the stage.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s usual, Meng said, to see all men in an orchestra pit too, despite the \u201cexcellent work\u201d of Maestra, a community of female composers, music directors, and theater musicians founded by Georgia Stitt in 2017.\n\nThose who are really committed to diversity on and off stage have come from communities whose identities are often marginalized, such as the female creative team of Hadestown. The creative process was genuinely collaborative, with all voices valued and welcome, said Meng. \u201cIt started from the top down.\u201d\n\n\u201c Theater, as we\u2019ve seen in the past, was a hot-bed of racism with Black-face and yellow-face. Broadway benefited from racism and certainly espoused it. \u201d\n\nMeng, like Allen, would not say in it itself Broadway was racist \u201cmaybe because that seems like such a harsh accusation to label on such a large community of people. It was definitely brought up in racist traditions. The people who were in power and are in power to some extent still are were brought up with racist ideologies, and that affected the stage. Theater, as we\u2019ve seen in the past, was a hot-bed of racism with black-face and yellow-face. Broadway benefited from racism and certainly espoused it.\u201d\n\nMeng is \u201cvery conflicted\u201d about the recently revived Broadway show, Miss Saigon\u2014she loves the catchy songs, recognizes how \u201cproblematic\u201d the story is, and welcomes the amount of work it has given to Asian actors, who\u2014Meng said\u2014will ask each other, \u201cHow many Saigons have you done?\u201d\n\nIn her own theater life, as noted by others in this piece, Meng said she had experienced a series of micro-aggressions. \u201cIt\u2019s never as full-on as someone calling you a \u2018chink.\u2019 It\u2019s more having people, so many times, insist on guessing where my parents are from.\n\n\u201cWhen they do this, people say to me, \u2018I can tell the difference between Japanese, Chinese, and Korean people so well. It\u2019s so odd and weird. Why are they so fixated about what I look like and my background. It\u2019s like me saying I can visually tell the difference between an Irish and Scottish person. These random things build up, and you build a skin around it.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Tony Award-winning Hadestown star Andr\u00e9 de Shields told The Daily Beast, \u201cThe Great White Way is not called that for racial reasons, but because many years ago it was electrified and it appeared as if it were daylight all the time. But it\u2019s a marvelous metaphor if you want to discuss racism, because for so many generations we of color have been taught this is an inhospitable environment.\u201d\n\nDe Shields\u2019 words resonated \u201ca lot\u201d with Meng. \u201cMy parents certainly felt that way\u2014as a kid, I know I was discouraged from diving further into the world of theatre because those people [\u2018true Americans\u2019] will \u2018never accept you as their own,\u2019 which I think could also explain why Asian-Americans specifically weren\u2019t as involved in the art form until much later into its history. Or at least, my parents never saw this art form as something belonging to them.\n\n\u201cI think that puts into context better my thoughts about if the industry is racist. It\u2019s kind of like a two-way street: if the environment is \u201cinhospitable\", as Andr\u00e9 puts it, to people of color, then they in turn will build up a wall or an expectation that they shouldn't pursue such things either, and that itself contributes to the lack of such people in the industry. And the people who do enter always face the idea that they are the \u2018other.\u2019\u201d\n\nDominique Morisseau: \u2018These micro-racisms add up, and chip away at you, a little bit at a time\u2019\n\nMorisseau, the Tony-nominated playwright and MacArthur \u201cgenius award\u201d winner who wrote the book for Ain\u2019t Too Proud, said that women of color are \u201cscarce\u201d on Broadway. \u201cAnd we also have to negotiate the power of our voice, particularly because Broadway is such a commercial space, and decisions about our work get made with that angle in mind.\u201d Off-Broadway or in local theaters, the writers have more power, Morisseau said.\n\n\u201cBehind the desk,\u201d Morisseau wanted to see more women directors of color, crew, technical, and design staff, and producers of color who have a key role in shaping shows artistically.\n\n\u201cBecause there aren\u2019t enough of us working behind the scenes, I think people take for granted the value of our perspectives,\u201d Morisseau added. \u201cI am often asked to be considerate of an older affluent white audience, which is opposite to where my personal allegiances are. My personal allegiances are to a younger and more diverse generation of audience members. When I come into a commercial space I bring that perspective, and advocate for placing value on those communities.\u201d\n\nThat perspective, said Morisseau, came from her home-town of Detroit, as well as Los Angeles and New York, \u201cand by that I mean the boroughs of New York where I taught for 10 years.\u201d She did not compromise on her vision for Ain\u2019t Too Proud, she said, and does not want her work \u201cmeasured against the ideology of one section of the population.\u201d\n\n\u201c Overt racism kills our bodies, the racists in the middle of the night who burn crosses on the lawn. The more familiar killers are quiet, and their racism kills our souls, and I have experienced that on numerous occasions within the theater. \u201d\n\nThe overt racism of President Trump as an appalling new bar has led to people not identifying the more subliminal, insidious forms of racism as such, Morisseau said.\n\n\u201cThe more common racism we face is polite. Overt racism kills our bodies, the racists in the middle of the night who burn crosses on the lawn. The more familiar killers are quiet, and their racism kills our souls, and I have experienced that on numerous occasions within the theater.\n\n\u201c Donors or directors who are older than me have treated me, a woman of 41, as their little pet, patting my hair, squeezing my cheeks. When I have said, \u2018Please don\u2019t touch my hair,\u2019 I have been accused of yelling. \u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes it will be audience members policing my reaction to the work I\u2019m seeing. I have gone to the theater, and had someone sit in the seat reserved for me as the playwright, and who doesn\u2019t think I need to be in that seat. I\u2019ve been told my natural hair is too big for the people who can\u2019t see sitting behind me. At another play, several cast members were called \u2018colored\u2019 by audience members and some of the staff. Personally, donors or directors who are older than me have treated me, a woman of 41, as their little pet, patting my hair, squeezing my cheeks. When I have said, \u2018Please don\u2019t touch my hair,\u2019 I have been accused of yelling.\n\n\u201cActually, I have been accused of yelling in ways that have made me furious, by white men who really do yell at each other. I do not yell, but if I assert what I believe it is considered yelling. That\u2019s become so typical, it\u2019s almost a joke. There has been a lot of misreading of my tone throughout my career.\u201d\n\nShe has told producers who claim she once yelled at them that they are insulting her character, and her ability to get her point across without yelling. \u201cThese micro-racisms add up, and chip away at you, a little bit at a time,\u201d Morisseau said.\n\nThen there is the ignoring or sidelining of people of color-created work. Morisseau recalled submitting her first play about a group of black women at a Detroit abortion clinic to a development program, \u201cand one of the criticisms of the work was that the work did not specify these were black women. The women were assumed to be white, unless stated otherwise.\u201d\n\n\u201c If it doesn\u2019t do anything to make white people feel uncomfortable, or goes out of its way to make white people feel uncomfortable\u2014those two things are applauded right now. But work that doesn\u2019t center whiteness at all gets insulted. \u201d\n\nSeveral times, Morisseau has felt critiques of her work, \u201cwhen it does not center whiteness or even talk about de-centering whiteness, it is treated it a lot harsher than when whiteness is not mentioned at all, or when somehow white people don\u2019t have any reason to feel uncomfortable watching it. If it doesn\u2019t do anything to make white people feel uncomfortable, or goes out of its way to make white people feel uncomfortable\u2014those two things are applauded right now. But work that doesn\u2019t center whiteness at all gets insulted.\n\n\u201cIt feels like those critics are not judging the quality of the work, but what they perceive the ideology of the work to be. I don\u2019t like how journalists give work a thumbs up, thumbs down. It doesn\u2019t feel nuanced to me. I\u2019d rather see journalism that didn\u2019t kill other writers\u2019 work.\u201d\n\nAlexia Sielo: \u2018Broadway can do better. I don\u2019t know if it will\u2019\n\nAlexia Sielo has worked as a professional actor for a year and a half, and said in almost every production she has been in there has been a form of racism, \u201ceven if people didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d As both black and Latina, she has noted that she is not considered, \u201cblack or Hispanic enough, or too black because of the color of my skin\u201d for certain roles.\n\n\u201cThe good thing about being a black actor on Broadway right now is that there are a lot of opportunities for us. It\u2019s a kind of negative and a positive.\u201d It was positive, she said, in that it meant actors like her had a showcase for their talents; the negative \u201cis going into a room and being the only person of color who has the balls to be there or say they won\u2019t play certain characters.\u201d\n\nSielo said that black, Latin, and Hispanic women want to perform, but worry \u201cthey don\u2019t have a fighting chance of a callback because of culture or the color of their skin.\u201d She is concerned that diverse casting is a trend. Permanent change is needed, which can be achieved by educating the next generation into thinking of diversity as a necessity. \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no excuse.\u201d\n\nIn another production, it was relayed to her that the feeling was she didn\u2019t fit in with other women in the show. \u201cBut I just wasn\u2019t kissing up to anybody. I deserved to be there. I auditioned and got the role. There are cliques in shows: the black actors tend to keep their side and the white actors to theirs. It was like that in high school too.\n\n\u201cSometimes it\u2019s nothing to do with racism and prejudice, it\u2019s just a lack of education around culture. It needs to be improved. I do my best to talk to everybody. I welcome questions on my blackness and my Latin-ness, no matter how offensive they have been. I try to have an open dialog.\u201d\n\n\u201c I don\u2019t think all of Broadway is racist. I just think certain people raised in a certain way are powerful in the industry, and therefore that affects everyone. \u201d\n\nWhite producers, Sielo said, often have black stereotypes in mind when casting: \u201can older, heavy-set woman, or a mezzo-soprano or alto screaming the entire show. You don\u2019t often see a black ingenue cast in a show. A friend who recently starred in a production of a well-known musical played the main character\u2019s wife, and got backlash from people who felt she wasn\u2019t soft enough. But she absolutely was. She kept her hair natural, and to people she didn\u2019t look like an ingenue. She wasn\u2019t looking the way they expected.\u201d\n\nSielo said she had never faced overt racism, but that\u2014alongside the words of Trump\u2014it has seeped into the general culture. \u201cIt\u2019s always been there. I don\u2019t think all of Broadway is racist. I just think certain people raised in a certain way are powerful in the industry, and therefore that affects everyone. Broadway can do better. I don\u2019t know if it will. It\u2019s definitely a process happening right now.\u201d\n\nAll change: \u201810 years ago all-male, all-white seasons were commonplace. Today they are virtually non-existent\u2019\n\n\u201cYounger white women have so far been the biggest beneficiaries of the push for parity,\u201d The Lillys\u2019 Julia Jordan told the Women\u2019s Day on Broadway audience earlier this year\u2014older white women and women of color of all ages have not. \u201cThose two groups are our growth opportunity.\u201d\n\nJordan said the majority of Lillys grants in the past few years had gone to women of color working in theater, and would continue to do so in the organization\u2019s tenth anniversary year.\n\nA sculpture of Raisin In The Sun author Lorraine Hansberry the organization had commissioned would travel to multiple locations around New York City in 2020. The Lillys is also beginning a campaign to raise half a million dollars for grants for women playwrights of color.\n\n\u201cA big systemic problem is child care\u2014theaters have to address it,\u201d said Jordan. \u201cWithout it there can be no gender parity, unless there is a complete sea change in culture and biology.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo end on a happy note,\u201d she told the Women\u2019s Day on Broadway audience, \u201c10 years ago all-male, all-white seasons were commonplace. Today they are virtually non-existent.\u201d\n\nEquity\u2019s Christine Toy Johnson has been heartened by the number of female directors and producers with shows on Broadway this season, as well as non-binary actors, actors of color, and those with a disability (most notably, Tony winner Ali Stoker).\n\n\u201c As long as we don\u2019t think, \u2018Rachel Chavkin (Hadestown\u2019s director) won a Tony. Done. We don\u2019t need to have this conversation any more.\u2019 It\u2019s important we see this as progress, not that we\u2019ve achieved all we need to. \u201d\n\nToy Johnson\u2014a \u201cpathological optimist,\u201d she told The Daily Beast\u2014noted that the increase in diversity of those working in theater led to an increase in the diversity of what is seen on stage. \u201cAs long as we don\u2019t think, \u2018Rachel Chavkin (Hadestown\u2019s director) won a Tony. Done. We don\u2019t need to have this conversation any more.\u2019 It\u2019s important we see this as progress, not that we\u2019ve achieved all we need to.\u201d\n\nHow to attract more people of color on Broadway as an audience? \u201cThe more diverse the show the less homogenously cast and produced, impacts the audience,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cIt will get people to see that they\u2019re not only invited, but they belong.\u201d Hamilton, for Johnson, is the apotheosis of a show that achieved this. Shows, said Velazquez, should appeal to people of color audiences as producers of The Wiz did in the mid-1970s, when Velazquez\u2019s father recalled busloads of members of black churches came to see the show.\n\nVelazquez and Sielo think audiences respond well to diverse casting, enjoying seeing people of different kinds alongside one another. \u201cI hope we get there one day. Casting agencies are more conscious about who they pick for roles. They see that eyes are on them right now. That\u2019s a good thing. We have to be more conscious about the kind of people we hire.\u201d\n\nThis autumn, as part of an initiative called \u201cThe Conversation,\u201d Women of Color on Broadway plans to partner up with high schools and colleges and production companies to introduce young women of color to a variety of Broadway careers, including marketing, musical supervision, lighting, and wardrobe design. The initiative also aims to set up conversations with Broadway women of color actors and internships for young people.\n\nFuture hopes: \u2018Trust black people. We have been doing big, bold, beautiful things for a long time\u2019\n\nToday, if Candice Marie Woods faces ignorance or insensitivity, she is \u201chappy to correct and enlighten\u201d those who seek to diminish her. Broadway, she feels, should become more open to all marginalized communities, to \u201cpeople whose stories are not being told, to faces who are not being seen. But they\u2019re there. If only we could understand the Great White Way wasn\u2019t that any more.\u201d\n\nWoods, who came out a couple of years ago, was inspired by the other queer women of color she met in the Bay Area when Ain\u2019t Too Proud toured there. \u201cI found a freer version of who I am, an honest, more transparent version. I fell in love out there, and I also saw people who looked like me. And for the first time in my entire life I felt normal. I didn\u2019t feel like I was alone. I felt like I was part of a community. All this time I didn\u2019t know there was space for me in this LGBTQ community. I was like, \u2018What\u2019s this Q?\u2019 Oakland was Black Power, black love, everything. It was so beautiful.\u201d\n\n\u201c I am a queer Black woman on Broadway playing Diana Ross, an iconic role. And I know there are other queer women out there who want to do what I do, but don\u2019t see themselves because people are not discussing it and we\u2019re not writing stories about it. \u201d\n\nWoods is proud to be called a \u201cblack queer woman.\u201d Up until she came out, she felt \u201caggressively pushed into a corner\u201d in how people perceived her, and that her voice didn\u2019t matter. \u201cI am a queer black woman on Broadway playing Diana Ross, an iconic role. And I know there are other queer women out there who want to do what I do, but don\u2019t see themselves because people are not discussing it and we\u2019re not writing stories about it.\n\n\u201cI am in a hot Broadway show with a bunch of black people and if you want to see yourself represented, come see it. Sharing that I am queer with people will hopefully help them to see there is more to me, and we should be telling more diverse stories on Broadway.\u201d\n\nWoods also wants to contribute to helping the LGBTQ community in whatever way she can. \u201cWe\u2019re in trying times and have to do it. Someone did it for me. I have benefited from other people\u2019s work. I feel responsible to give something back.\u201d\n\nTo Broadway producers, Woods said: \u201cTrust us, trust black people. We have been doing big, bold, beautiful things for a long time. Trust our writers, producers, and directors. Say, \u2018Let\u2019s make it happen.\u2019\u201d Woods would love to see stories not about slavery or downtrodden black women, but \u201cabout people with regular lives that she could recognize. \u201cBlack people clip their toenails too,\u201d she said, laughing.\n\nProgress may be slow, but real change can be achieved, said Woods, by \u201cstanding together and doing the work to make this change happen.\u201d\n\nThe key thing, said Debbie Allen, was for producers of color to pilot projects and maintain creative control, and for more producers to follow them, \u201cbecause Broadway is a business, not a non-profit. I directed one of the highest-selling plays on Broadway, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, with Terrence Howard and Phylicia Rashad. It was controversial we were doing it, but it sold out, then went to London and won an Olivier Award. Change happened, and is happening. There have been more shows since then.\u201d\n\nWill Allen, presently starring in, directing, and executive-producing Grey\u2019s Anatomy, return to Broadway again? She laughed. \u201cYes, if they let me out of here. I\u2019m in lockdown in Shondaland.\u201d Stand by for the Netflix musical, Christmas on The Square, which Allen directed, starring Christine Baranski and Dolly Parton. \u201cWe just wrapped it. I loved it, and had the best time in world doing it. It was amazing.\u201d\n\n\u201c If there were more producers of color that would really benefit the stories being told on Broadway. The biggest place we can use more diversity on Broadway is in the producing realm. \u201d\n\nThere has been progress on Broadway, Cynthia Meng said, with better casting and more diversity, and questioning whether Latina stories should be told with non-Latina actors, \u201cbut there is no way that this is the end. It needs to be keep going.\u201d\n\nMeng mentioned a recent article in the New York Times that celebrated the achievements of a group of female producers on Broadway, \u201cbut I noticed they were all white. If there were more producers of color that would really benefit the stories being told on Broadway. The biggest place we can use more diversity on Broadway is in the producing realm.\u201d Her next engagement will be with the Radio City Christmas Spectacular, starring the Rockettes.\n\nIn her next show, based on the TV show Soul Train, Dominique Morisseau, together with choreographer Camille A. Brown, and director Kamilah Forbes, will form the first black female creative trio to pilot a Broadway show.\n\n\u201c There is always this question when people of color enter a field where they are not dominant, that thinking of \u2018Well we wanted them, but we couldn\u2019t find any capable ones.\u2019 We\u2019re like, \u2018No, there\u2019s tons of capable people of color. We were always here. We\u2019re not going to play that game any more.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cI wanted to change course and make history on this creative team,\u201d said Morisseau. \u201cThat\u2019s how we can do the show we intend. What having three black women heading this show says that there will be things inherently in the culture of the show that we will all have equal access to\u2014and that won\u2019t need to be explained or negotiated. Of course, we will have different ideas, but this is exciting.\n\n\u201cThere is always this question when people of color enter a field where they are not dominant; that thinking of, \u2018Well we wanted them, but we couldn\u2019t find any capable ones.\u2019 We\u2019re like, \u2018No, there\u2019s tons of capable people of color. We were always here. We\u2019re not going to play that game any more.\u2019 We\u2019re excited to change that narrative not just in the show, but in our field.\u201d\n\nForbes and Morisseau have already started discussing a future, all-woman project. On Broadway, the dream shows Morisseau would like to see are Pearl Cleage\u2019s Blues for an Alabama Sky and Flyin\u2019 West.\n\nMorisseau would also like to see her own play, Skeleton Crew, on Broadway. \u201cAnd then there is the Broadway show I have never seen that maybe I want to create,\u201d she said, laughing softly. \u201cA contemporary musical centering on black women.\u201d", "description": "Debbie Allen, Dominique Morisseau, the sisters behind \u2018Women of Color on Broadway,\u2019 and others tell Tim Teeman about confronting racism, and shaping a future of inclusive theater.", "authors": ["Tim Teeman", "Senior Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567049243/190828-teeman-black-broadway-tease_x8szjv"}
