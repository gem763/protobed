It began as a haven for free speech \u2014 or at least that's what its founder believed it to be.\n\nFredrick Brennan created 8chan in 2013, when he was 19. It was a lot like 4chan, another imageboard created by another teenager 10 years earlier, but it allowed users even more freedom.\n\nThe original premise for both was simple: Users could upload photos while others commented with text or images of their own. Everyone was anonymous. Posts were deleted after a few days. The effect was that no single user could become famous. Everyone had equal power.\n\nBut it also meant that if you missed a day, you missed a meme. The lack of archives rewarded the most obsessive users. It created a cultlike subculture. 4chan became known as the dark heart of the internet \u2014 a place to find weird porn, graphic violence, the darkest jokes. 8chan went even darker.\n\nTo understand how a person could be angry enough to create a place like 8chan, you have to understand his life. Brennan has osteogenesis imperfecta, a congenital disease that makes bones curved and weak. Brennan says he has broken a bone more than 100 times.\n\n\u201cEverything about him \u2014 just the way he presented himself \u2014 on the inside, you could tell he was a broken child.\u201d\n\nBrennan couldn\u2019t walk, and he played on the ground as a kid. But by age 13, his right arm had broken so many times that he risked losing the use of it, so he decided to stay mostly in his wheelchair. The internet was an escape. He discovered 4chan when he was 12. \u201cI was mesmerized,\u201d Brennan said. \u201c4chan was nothing like anything I\u2019d ever seen.\u201d\n\nHe found a perverse satisfaction in seeing people using words like crippled. No one had ever called him that, but he thought, \u201cThis is what people are really thinking, and they\u2019re lying in real life.\u201d\n\nHe decided to retreat into the online world, where he initially kept his disability secret. \u201cWhen I started using 4chan heavily, my whole life became about the internet,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd my real life stopped mattering to me.\u201d\n\nFredrick had a difficult relationship with his father, and when he was 14, his father put him and his younger brother, who is also disabled, into foster care. \u201cI just reached my breaking point,\u201d David Brennan said.\n\nThe brothers ended up in a group home. Their caseworker, Melisa Rehrauer, said she knew Fredrick was very smart the day she met him. But he didn\u2019t want to be looked at, and he let his hair hang in his face. \u201cEverything about him \u2014 just the way he presented himself \u2014 on the inside, you could tell he was a broken child,\u201d she said.\n\nThey weren\u2019t allowed to go online in the group home. So Fredrick saved his money and bought an iPod touch. He then cracked the Wi-Fi. The device was clumsy, \u201cbut it was mine and I could go on 4chan and nobody could know,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou have to be a free speech absolutist if you want to be an 8chan admin because if you're anything else, you're gonna get burned at the stake.\u201d\n\nRehrauer helped the brothers move back in with their mom when Fredrick was 16, and he continued essentially living online. In 2013 he became the administrator of Wizardchan, a site for adult male virgins. A woman reached out to Fredrick, saying she had a devotee fetish, meaning a fetish for people with disabilities. She flew to New York to meet him.\n\nBeing with her improved his self-esteem, he said, but that in turn damaged the relationship, because her fetish was for him to be sexually shy and insecure. Brennan later told friends in a group chat that he\u2019d taken her to get an abortion, and that it was therapeutic, because \u201cI wanted to have been aborted as a baby.\u201d\n\nThe relationship, in his telling, did not end well. But the woman had given him a set of new experiences that would shape the rest of his life \u2014 particularly psychedelic mushrooms. The mushroom trip was the first time he accepted the fact that he would always be disabled, and that it was OK. As he was coming down, he dreamed up 8chan. Days later, Brennan set it live.\n\nThe site was a modest success until Gamergate. Gamergate was the moment in 2014 when internet trolls figured out how to act as a political movement. They claimed to be demanding \u201cethics in video game journalism,\u201d but the core of their activism was harassing female game developers and critics. They threatened women, posted their personal information online, and sent SWAT teams to their homes.\n\nAfter a few weeks, 4chan banned Gamergate. Brennan seized the opportunity. \u201cI looked at Gamergate very cynically,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t care about the ethics. And I didn\u2019t care about the women ... I just cared that this is bringing users to my site.\u201d\n\nIt worked. And Brennan stepped into the persona of internet bad guy, lord of the trolls. 8chan was a truly free public forum, with no limits except what was illegal. Ideas would do battle, and the best would rise to the top. Asked in an October 2014 interview if 8chan was a safe haven for nihilism and misogyny, Fredrick responded, \u201cImageboards are a haven for all of the terrible things you listed, and that's exactly what makes them such wonderful places. I wouldn't change a thing \u2026 It is humanly impossible for us to monitor everything,\u201d and the law said he didn\u2019t have to.\n\nFredrick says now, \u201cYou have to be a free speech absolutist if you want to be an 8chan admin because if you're anything else, you're gonna get burned at the stake.\u201d\n\nFurther establishing his free speech credentials, he wrote an essay advocating for eugenics for the premier neo-Nazi website the Daily Stormer. He said people with genetic diseases should be paid to be sterilized. \u201cI suggest we start with the ones that cause osteogenesis imperfecta: COL1A1 and COL1A2,\u201d he wrote. He noted that he wasn\u2019t a Nazi, but the Daily Stormer was the only site that would publish the essay.\n\n\u201cHere's how I see it,\u201d Brennan said. \u201cAt the time, the whole world hated me. Who could blame them? I was technically not breaking any laws, but something about what I was doing felt wrong to almost everyone. I feel like I wrote the article to say\u2026 Yes. you hate me and 8chan, but it's your shitty capitalist structure and milquetoast fear of genetic science that brought me here.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, Brennan sold 8chan to an American businessman in the Philippines, but he stayed on as a site administrator. He moved to Manila, where he could afford a home health aide. In April 2016, Brennan quit 8chan but kept working for the company that owned it. In December 2018, he quit that too. He\u2019d started going to church with his aide, and met a woman there. He converted to Christianity, and they married on Valentine\u2019s Day. In recent months, 8chan got around 15 million unique visitors each month, according to Similarweb.\n\nBrennan began denouncing 8chan in March after a gunman killed 51 people in two New Zealand mosques after posting a white supremacist manifesto on 8chan. But when we spoke in Manila in May, he still wasn\u2019t sure that if he knew then what he knows now, he wouldn\u2019t have founded it. When the El Paso shooting happened in early August, the third mass shooting this year in which the gunman shared his plans on 8chan, Fredrick began more explicitly calling for 8chan to disappear and never return. This drew attention from media worldwide, and from trolls.\n\nThey tried to post his address, and sent him images of him being pushed down the stairs. \u201cI didn't create online harassment,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has all been going on way before I came of age, but in a way, I kind of deserve it, don't you think?\u201d\n\nAnimations by Cartuna.\n\nThis segment originally aired September 4, 2019, on VICE News Tonight on HBO.", "description": "\u201cReal life stopped mattering to me,\u201d says founder Fredrick Brennan.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d70e93635cd4a0008534629/lede/1567712296184-VICE-News-Tonight-8Chan-4_sized.png?crop=0.9965432098765432xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
