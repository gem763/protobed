That is why it\u2019s essential to come out of the backstop.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing is that we bust out of the so-called backstop arrangements, which keep the UK locked in Brussels\u2019 customs union, commercial trade policy, and regulatory affairs, all the laws that come from Brussels.\n\n\u201cUnder the backstop, we would have to accept a huge proportion of them without any say in the making of those rules. What we\u2019re doing by abolishing the backstop is coming out taking the freedoms that are so vital for Brexit.\u201d\n\nMr Johnson did not rule out encouraging European leader to refuse to delay Brexit \u2013 as a way to circumvent anti no-deal legislation \u2013 but denied having made such a request.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cIn truth, we have not made any such request.\n\n\u201cMy own view is that they want to get this done as much as we do and indeed the majority of the British public do, whether they voted for leave or remain.\u201d\n\nIt comes after The Times reported that Mr Johnson\u2019s plan to get around the Benn Act would be to ask EU leaders to rule out any extension to the October 31 deadline.\n\nHe would then seek to present MPs in parliament with a straight choice of agreeing the revised deal or leaving without an agreement on Halloween.\n\nIn reference to Downing Street source comments that Remain MPs should be investigated for \u201cforeign collusion\u201d, Mr Johnson said there was a \u201clegitimate question to be asked\u201d about legislation from emergency debates in parliament.\n\n\u201cI think there is a legitimate question to be asked about the generation of this SO24 legislation,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is a very interesting situation. We have bills and an act \u2013 the so-called Surrender Act \u2013 that I\u2019m afraid has a massive consequence for the people and economy of this country were it to be effected.\n\n\u201cWe have no knowledge of how it was produced. It is not subject to normal parliamentary scrutiny.
