Sign up here.\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the most likely outlook for the U.S. and world economy is continued moderate growth. His comments cemented expectations for another quarter-percentage-point cut in interest rates later this month.\n\n\u201cOur main expectation is not at all that there will be a recession,\u201d either in the U.S. or the global economy, Powell said Friday in Zurich during a question-and-answer session in which he was joined by Swiss National Bank President Thomas Jordan.\n\nThe Fed chief noted that the central bank is monitoring \"significant risks,\" including global trade tensions, that could threaten this scenario. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to watch all of these factors, and all the geopolitical things that are happening,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to act as appropriate to sustain this expansion.\u201d\n\nPowell\u2019s remarks reinforced investors\u2019 expectations for a quarter percentage-point cut when U.S. central bankers gather in Washington Sept. 17-18. They were also the last public words on policy from the Fed until the gathering: officials enter their pre-meeting blackout at midnight.\n\nPowell could have signaled he was open to a more dovish half-point rate cut, which some policy makers have sought -- and which President Donald Trump has loudly been calling for on Twitter. But he did not.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. economy has continued to perform well,\u201d he said. \u201cThe most likely outlook for our economy remains a favorable one, with moderate growth, a strong labor market, and inflation moving back up close to our 2% goal.\u201d\n\nU.S. stocks extended gains and Treasuries were mixed after Powell spoke, with the S&P 500 advancing to session highs. The dollar fell.\n\nRate-cut expectations were also reinforced earlier Friday when the U.S. Labor Department reported employers added 130,000 new jobs in August, undershooting economists\u2019 estimates.\n\nPowell said the labor market was in quite a strong position and described the latest data as \u201cconsistent\u201d with that picture.\n\nFor months, Powell and his Fed colleagues have warned that trade tensions and slower global growth represent mounting risks to the U.S. economy. To guard against those risks and to boost below-target inflation, the Fed cut rates by a quarter point in July in what Powell called a \u201cmid-cycle adjustment\u201d and \u201cnot the beginning of a long series of rate cuts.\u201d\n\nIn recent weeks, however, manufacturing data has suggested that ongoing trade disputes are causing not only uncertainty, but real damage to the U.S. economy.\n\n\u201cThere are significant risks and we\u2019ve been monitoring those,\u201d Powell said.\n\nPowell was also asked about a Bloomberg Opinion column published last week by former New York Fed chief Bill Dudley, which suggested that the Fed reject interest-rate cuts that would shield the economy from Trump\u2019s trade policies, and help his prospects for re-election in 2020.\n\n\u201cWe serve all Americans regardless of their political party,\u201d Powell said. \u201cThe idea that we would deviate from that is just simply wrong.\u201d\n\nThe chairman was asked about Facebook Inc.\u2019s Libra crypto-currency plans. Powell said it could quickly become systemically important because of the huge scale of the social-media giant\u2019s network. As a result, it would have to be \u201cheld to the highest\u201d regulatory and supervisory standards.\n\n\u201cIt is not obvious to see how that would happen under our current regulatory system,\u201d he said.\n\n(Updates with crypto-currency comments in final paragraph.)\n\n--With assistance from Christopher Condon, Fergal O'Brien, Reade Pickert and Scott Lanman.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Catherine Bosley in Zurich at cbosley1@bloomberg.net;Jan Dahinten in Zurich at jdahinten@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Margaret Collins at mcollins45@bloomberg.net, Alister Bull, Ben Holland\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars.
