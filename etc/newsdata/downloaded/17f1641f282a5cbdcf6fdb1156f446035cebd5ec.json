Josh Hawley. | Drew Angerer/Getty Images Congress Senate Judiciary shelves vote on Trump judicial pick after conservative opposition\n\nThe senate Judiciary Judiciary Committee has shelved the consideration of a nominee for a key circuit judge position after an uprising of conservative opposition.\n\nThe committee postponed its vote on Halil Suleyman \u201cSul\u201d Ozerden to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals shortly after Sen Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) informed Republicans he was opposed. Hawley joined Sen. Ted Cruz in opposition.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nHawley began informing colleagues of his decision on Thursday morning, just hours before Ozerden was going to be considered before the Senate Judiciary Committee. With Cruz (R-Texas) and Hawley in opposition, Ozerden now needs Democratic support to receive a favorable recommendation by the committee, where Republicans enjoy a two-seat advantage.\n\nOzerden is a friend of acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and has been strongly supported by both Sens. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.). But conservatives have been skeptical of his credentials, specifically his ruling in favor of dismissing a challenge to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraception coverage mandate, which he deemed premature.\n\nHawley is citing that ruling in his opposition to Ozerden, the source said; he met with Ozerden earlier this month. Hawley also opposed Michael Bogren's nomination to a district court earlier this year, helping derail another Trump nominee to a lifetime court position.\n\n", "description": "Hawley began informing colleagues of his decision just hours before the nominee was going to be considered before the Senate Judiciary Committee.", "authors": ["Burgess Everett"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/8f/8f/6a8190a34ef2a78d765e22f94b1f/190926-josh-hawley-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
