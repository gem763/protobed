Adam Schiff (D-CA) refused to meet with a group of ten senior citizens opposed to the impeachment of President Donald Trump at his district office in Burbank on Thursday, citing a \u201cnew policy\u201d on \u201csecurity.\u201d\n\nThe group, which included several constituents of Schiff\u2019s 28th congressional district, Trump supporters, and Tea Party activists, had informed Schiff\u2019s staff ahead of time that they would be coming. They carried home-made signs that read, \u201cDon\u2019t Impeach!\u201d, \u201cPink Slip for Adam Schiff!\u201d, and \u201cSchiff, is a Shifty Character and a Liar!\u201d They also carried a document listing 200 of Trump\u2019s accomplishments, as part of their opposition to impeachment.\n\nThe protest was live-streamed on Breitbart News\u2019 Facebook page, reaching over 200,000 viewers in two hours.\n\nAfter holding a demonstration on the sidewalk in front of the office building housing Schiff\u2019s office, the group went inside and attempted to meet with Schiff\u2019s staff. Finding the door locked, they rang the doorbell. They were told that they could leave comments for the congressman on cards in the hallway, but that a \u201cnew policy\u201d prevented staff from venturing out into the hallway, or inviting the demonstrators inside Schiff\u2019s office, for \u201csecurity\u201d reasons.\n\nSchiff, who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, is leading the \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d into the president, though that inquiry has yet to be authorized by a vote of the House of Representatives, as per House precedent.\n\nJoel B.
