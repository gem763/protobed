(Chris Wattie/Reuters)\n\nIf the West sinks, you can thank big businesses like Air Canada as much as the universities and the media.\n\nAir Canada announced last week that it will no longer use the phrase \u201cladies and gentlemen\u201d on board its flights. The policy is part of a \u201ccommitment to respect sexual identity, diversity, and inclusion,\u201d the company said in an internal memo.\n\nInstead of the gender-specific \u201cladies and gentlemen\u201d (and \u201cmesdames et messieurs\u201d \u2014 all announcements on Air Canada are in English and French), flight attendants are to address passengers as \u201ceverybody\u201d and \u201ctout le monde.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLGBTQ groups are delighted.\n\nMost other people are not.\n\nNeedless to say, Air Canada never polled its passengers or its employees. The Left believes in democracy only when it wins a popular vote. When it loses a popular vote, it regards democracy as defective. A perfect example is the attempt by the Left in Britain and the rest of Europe to overturn the British people\u2019s vote in favor of leaving the European Union. Because the Left lost, it regards that exercise in democracy as invalid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEveryone knows that had there been a vote among Air Canada passengers \u2014 say, all those enrolled in the airline\u2019s frequent flier program \u2014 even liberal Canadians would have voted to retain \u201cladies and gentlemen.\u201d Even the infinitesimally small number of Canadians who are transgender would almost all vote to retain \u201cladies and gentlemen.\u201d Remember, transgender individuals strongly identify as male or female \u2014 they simply reject their biological sexual identity. So, who, exactly, is Air Canada making more comfortable? Not the 99-plus percent of Canadians who identify with their biological sex, and not the fraction of a percent of Canadians who are transgender.\n\nThey are allegedly making the most rare of all human beings comfortable: those with no sexual identity. And not even every member of that group would vote to have Air Canada drop \u201cladies and gentlemen.\u201d I recently interviewed one such individual on my radio show, Professor Camille Paglia, one of the major thinkers of our time. She told me she identifies as neither female nor male but she thinks society is going mad in its rush to obliterate male and female.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe truth is no one but LGBTQ activists (including their cisgender heterosexual supporters) approve of Air Canada\u2019s change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo why did Air Canada do this?\n\nTo feel good about itself and buy goodwill with some of the most powerful social forces in the English-speaking world: LGBTQ activist groups. Big-business leftism \u2014 like Citibank\u2019s recent video featuring the hurt and angry reactions of young girls (around ages 10 to 13) when told women are \u201cpaid less than men\u201d for the same work \u2014 can best be described as moral onanism.\n\nThere are no other reasons for Air Canada\u2019s decision. Air Canada has offended nearly all its passengers \u2014 male, female, straight, gay and transgender \u2014 who want to be referred to as ladies or gentlemen. But this means nothing to Air Canada. And it is likely that U.S. airlines will follow suit. There is no left-wing position, no matter how radical or absurd, that hurts a business.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnly taking a conservative position can hurt a business. The owner of Chick-fil-A believes in the only sex-based definition of marriage that has ever existed \u2014 the union of male and female \u2014 and is boycotted, closed down or never allowed to open. That Chick-fil-A hires and serves gays, including married gays, makes no difference to left-wing haters.\n\nForbes reported last week that just eight days after a new Chick-fil-A was opened for business, \u201cthe Oracle shopping mall in Reading, outside London . . . yanked its lease. . . . The outlet in Reading, about 35 miles from London, was an effort to test the metropolitan area\u2019s waters. But, campaigners from Reading Pride, an LGBT organization, called for a boycott of the American brand because of its foundation\u2019s support of groups they say are hostile to gay rights.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, the San Antonio Airport banned Chick-fil-A from opening a restaurant there. And New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel tried to prevent Chick-fil-A from opening in their cities \u2014 because of the owner\u2019s views, not Chick-fil-A\u2019s policies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAir Canada will pay no price for a decision that insults the vast majority of its clients and undermines one of the most beautiful and essential building blocks of civilization: the existence, and even celebration, of the two sexes. No company pays a price \u2014 from Air Canada to Citibank to Gillette (whose \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d video was a \u201cscrew you\u201d to nearly all its male clients) to Nike (which has appointed as its national spokesman a football player who won\u2019t stand for the national anthem and loathes America).\n\nSuch is the power and stranglehold of the left today \u2014 in big business as much as in journalism and our schools. This is not new. As the famous quote attributed to (but perhaps not actually said by) Lenin put it, \u201cThe capitalists\u201d \u2014 in this case, Western businesses \u2014 \u201cwill sell us the rope with which to hang them.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf the West sinks, you can thank big businesses like Air Canada as much as the universities and the media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2019 CREATORS.COM", "description": "If the West sinks, you can thank big businesses like Air Canada as much as the universities and the media.", "authors": ["Dennis Prager", "Robert Verbruggen", "Andrew C.
