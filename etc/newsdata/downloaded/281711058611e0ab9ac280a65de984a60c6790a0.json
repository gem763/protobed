However, the Middle Kingdom\u2019s economic machine may be slowing but President Xi Jinping is unlikely to sue for peace anytime soon \u2014 at least not on terms acceptable to American interests.\n\nChina\u2019s economic system is antithetical to American democratic capitalism. Its buccaneer commercial policies flaunt the World Trade Organization\u2019s rules and other Western norms. For example, Beijing promotes private theft of intellectual property and steals jobs by requiring foreign firms to produce in China, through joint ventures with Chinese firms, to access its markets.\n\nBeijing uses the technology and wealth gained to build a modern navy and promote its Belt and Road initiatives. Together those threaten security in the Pacific, undermine democratic values in developing nations, and support authoritarian regimes in places like the Philippines and Venezuela.\n\nPresident Donald Trump aims to convince or compel Beijing to stop commercial tactics that undermine American prosperity and global geopolitical interests. And that requires systemic changes in China\u2019s socialist-market economy.\n\nNot ready to make nice\n\nLittle evidence has emerged that China is ready to capitulate.\n\nXi sits atop a communist oligarchy with a long history of breaking its word and has exhibited no intention of negotiating in good faith. On several occasions, he has persuaded Trump to postpone tariffs to initiate yet another round of protracted talks that end with the Chinese offering little.\n\nWe are at a stalemate, and the lesson for Trump should be clear \u2014 incrementalism does not work. Threats followed by postponed actions and raising tariffs on selective portions of Chinese exports and in steps are a fool\u2019s journey. Similarly, announcing sweeping sanctions against ZTE and Huawei followed by some easing back.\n\nIt\u2019s aggrandizement at the White House to attribute the slowing the Chinese economy to those limited measures and to claim Americans are not paying the tariffs.\n\nChina\u2019s economic model was hitting barriers even before Trump joined the war. It lacks sufficient overseas markets to sell all the stuff its subsidized factories crank out, and Xi efforts to shift leadership to state enterprises from private businesses impose terrible inefficiencies.\n\nNeither the Chinese nor Americans pay all the costs of the tariffs. Anyone who has taken Principles of Economics knows that taxes are partially borne by producers \u2014 they accept some price cuts \u2014 and by consumers \u2014 they pay the differences between the tariffs and those price reductions. Anti-Trump economists who state otherwise should be defrocked.\n\nMoving supply chains\n\nForeign investors are moving supply chains out of China to avoid the uncertainty of American ire. The next president, like Trump, Obama and Bush, will face the same economic and geopolitical challenges posed by Beijing\u2019s obsession with creating an Imperial China on the global stage \u2014 one that makes the rules and reduces other governments to supplicants.\n\nContrary to the promises of White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, factories leaving China are not moving to America but to other Asian locations. Chinese wages and bureaucratic risks are now too high even without Trump\u2019s tariffs, and his trade war is accelerating a trend not instigating it.\n\nAmerican farmers are getting clobbered by Chinese targeted retaliation. Beijing is a lot smarter about how it turns the screws than a divided White House with doves like Secretary Stephen Mnuchin preaching appeasement and undercutting Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. Designating China a currency manipulator is largely a symbolic gesture.\n\nChina has enormous wealth and staying power and a stubborn oligarchy that will hold Xi\u2019s feet to the fire. Meanwhile, opportunist Democratic presidential hopefuls\u2014like Joe Biden and Kamala Harris\u2014offer the prospects of a softened U.S. posture if elected.\n\nHit him harder\n\nXi sees this, and Trump will have to hit him a lot harder to get results.\n\nTrump could impose a system of mandatory import licenses that ends the $320 billion bilateral trade imbalance. Issue U.S. exporters resalable licenses to purchase goods from China in proportion to their sales there. The more China buys in America, the more it can sell here but if it retaliates against American farmers, then it must sell less here. And implement tough financial sanctions against technology pirates like Huawei and their banks.\n\nA few skirmishes a victory does not make, and it\u2019s hard to have confidence in a divided White House that does not know fact from fiction or have the stomach to act decisively.", "description": "The White House says the U.S. is winning the trade war with China, but Beijing is unlikely to sue for peace anytime soon, writes Peter Morici.", "authors": ["Peter Morici"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HM480_trump__ZG_20190628232235.jpg"}
