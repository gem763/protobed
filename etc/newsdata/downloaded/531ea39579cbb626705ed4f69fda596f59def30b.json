The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped by just 0.19%. In late trading, half of the Dow\u2019s member firms were trading higher.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nA DJIA Stock Rewarding Investors\n\nMany investors love dividends and plenty love share buybacks. Put those two themes together and there\u2019s usually a positive reaction, hence why Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was the Dow\u2019s leading performer today, gaining 1.84%.\n\nMicrosoft, which has been become a dividend growth story in recent years, boosted its payout by 11% while noting it will repurchase another $40 billion worth of its stock. The company\u2019s new dividend yield is just 1.33% and Microsoft holds plenty of cash on hand so it can raise dividends and buyback shares as it sees fit, and do so over the long-term.\n\nBoeing\u2019s Back\n\nBoeing (NYSE:BA) makes an almost daily appearance on the Dow Jones Today roundup. The shares were lower by about half a percent as traders discussed the fate of the stocks come October, a month that looks like it\u2019s going to be a vital one for Boeing investors.\n\n\u201cCEO Dennis Muilenburg is headed to Washington. He received an invitation to testify before the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on Oct. 30,\u201d reports Barron\u2019s. \u201cThis is the same committee that grilled FAA officials about its approval process for new planes as well as its decision to ground Boeing\u2019s 737 MAX jet back in May.\u201d\n\nNo promises, but there\u2019s a chance Muilenburg\u2019s October congressional testimony will provide some clues about Boeing\u2019s ability to get the 737 MAX back in the skies by the end of this year.\n\nBad Entertainment\n\nFor much of this year, Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) has provided investors with some good theater, but that wasn\u2019t the case Thursday as shares of Disney slid 2.57%, making the stock the worst performer in the Dow. There\u2019s still a lot to like with Disney stock, but there are some challenges from the film business, which has been a key driver of the stock\u2019s performance this year.\n\nImperial Capital analyst David Miller said in research out today that there are some issues surrounding Disney\u2019s ability to work through the backlog of films it acquired via its purchase of 21st Century Fox. That is weighing on box office performance for some of those movies. The analyst slightly lowered his Disney price target to $139 from $140.\n\nDow Bank News\n\nIt closed slightly lower today, but Dow component JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) continues to look like one of the stronger banking names and could be on the cusp of a breakout.\n\n\u201cThey are the gold standard of the banking industry. They have a strong leadership team, and they\u2019re benefiting from the tax overhaul. But nobody\u2019s even recognizing that,\u201d said Michael Bapis, managing director of Vios Advisors at Rockefeller Capital, in an interview with CNBC.\n\nBottom Line: Sorting Things Out\n\nFor investors that like interest rate cuts, more may be coming even though yesterday\u2019s Fed minutes indicated the Fed is divided on that issue.\n\n\u201cA big question for us was whether Jerome Powell still considered rate cuts to be \u2018midcycle\u2019 adjustments,\u201d said Morningstar in a new note. \u201cThough Powell avoided directly answering the question, we got the sense the cut was more of the midcycle variety, rather than the \u2018beginning of a lengthy cutting cycle.\u2019 We still view at least one or two more cuts over the next year as the most likely outcome.\u201d\n\nTodd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Dow Jones Today: Boring Post-Fed Action appeared first on InvestorPlace.", "description": "Following yesterday's interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, which may have left market participants with more questions than answers, stocks meandered for most of Thursday with the major U.S. indexes not doing much of anything in either direction.Source: Venturelli Luca / Shutterstock.com Still", "authors": ["Todd Shriber"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/43skhphJeAoFfrLhes.LTA--~B/aD00MDA7dz03Mjg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/investorplace_417/5da3a2e4f7624cf88936f9c9cd0e2bee", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
