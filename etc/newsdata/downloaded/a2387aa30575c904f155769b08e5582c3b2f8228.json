Darch, said Dean shined his flashlight into the bedroom and she could see Jefferson's face when he shot her.\n\nKraus said there was \"absolutely no excuse\" for Jefferson's death, which he said had \"eroded the trust we have built with the community.\"\n\n\"It makes sense she would have a gun if she felt threatened or if there was someone in the backyard,\" Kraus said, ending a press conference after eight minutes as he grew emotional talking about the impact the killing has had on police morale.\n\nFort Worth has called on independent experts to evaluate the police department after the shooting.\n\nJefferson was killed the same month another white former Texas police officer, Amber Guyger, was convicted of murdering Botham Jean, a black man, as he sat in his home eating ice cream.\n\nJefferson's family called for the swift prosecution of Dean, who was arrested on Monday and posted $200,000 bail overnight.\n\n\"#AtatianaJefferson deserved to live in a world where she was safe from brutality playing video games in her home with her nephew,\" Merritt tweeted.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Andrew Hay; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)", "description": "Atatiana Jefferson, 28, was playing video games with her 8-year-old nephew around 2:30 am on Saturday when she heard sounds in her backyard, according to the warrant for former Fort Worth Police Officer Aaron Dean's arrest for alleged murder.
