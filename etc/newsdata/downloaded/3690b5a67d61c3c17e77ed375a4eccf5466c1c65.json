It\u2019s about rugby education, some natural talent through our bloodlines.\u201d\n\nBy the numbers, 27 of the 31 All Blacks are New Zealand-born as are 50 players scattered across 11 other teams.\n\nExcluding New Zealand, eight of the top 10 ranked countries have New Zealand-origin players including Japan (five), Australia and Scotland (three), England and Ireland (two), and Wales and France (one).", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 Michael Leitch is Japan\u2019s poster boy, but like many other players at the Rugby World Cup he\u2019s not representing his country", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/10/00fa29_michael-leitch-was-born-in-new-zealand-but-moved-japan-young-age-kiwi-connection-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
