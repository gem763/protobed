But the Communist Party of China has begun investing money and gaining influence in ways that have vast \u2014 and worrisome \u2014 implications.\n\n\u201cAfter years of relative passivity [Beijing] is now making a concerted effort to expand its strategic presence and economic clout\u201d in the Middle East, writes Ilan Berman, senior vice president of the American Foreign Policy Council, in the current issue of the Middle East Quarterly. (I rely extensively on his fine analysis in what follows.) Mr. Berman rightly calls this \u201cone of the most consequential \u2026 trends of recent years.\u201d\n\nTwo motives \u2014 energy and ideology \u2014 explain China\u2019s regional ambitions. As the country becomes more prosperous, its growing energy consumption leads to more dependence on Middle Eastern suppliers. China imports more than half of its crude oil, and of that, nearly 40 percent comes from the Middle East, with the proportion continuing to rise. In Mr. Berman\u2019s estimation, the region \u201cis quickly becoming a key engine of Chinese economic growth,\u201d which in turn implies an imperative for Beijing to gain more influence over what happens there.\n\nBeyond this practical need, asserting Chinese power has become an end in itself since Mr. Xi took power in 2013, leading to what Mr. Berman calls \u201can increasingly aggressive, expansionist foreign policy.\u201d This includes an attempt at global economic dominance via the Belt and Road Initiative that involves 100 countries.\n\nIn the Middle East, this has meant that the Chinese government\u2019s ambitions have grown in the past five years from merely buying energy and selling arms to a far deeper involvement. Symbolic of this transformation, annual Chinese investment in the region a decade ago amounted to $1 billion; at just a single forum recently, it pledged $23 billion in loans and development aid. In August, it sent a $1 billion cash infusion to Turkey alone.\n\nMilitarily, Beijing become a leading contributor to U.N. peacekeeping operations, sent the People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy on visits to many ports and opened its first regional base in Djibouti in 2015. The future presumably holds many more Chinese military bases.\n\nAs Beijing begins to \u201calter politics and security in the region,\u201d Mr. Berman notes \u201ctremendous consequences.\u201d Here are three:\n\nU.S.-Israel ties: China\u2019s leaders so appreciate the Jewish state\u2019s technological prowess that they invested $3.2 billion in the first half of 2019 and now are estimated to control or have influence over as much as one-quarter of Israel\u2019s tech industry, including military contractors working on confidential projects with American firms. Indeed China may soon replace America as Israel\u2019s single-largest source of investment, a prospect that not only has official Washington \u201cincreasingly alarmed\u201d but could damage a decades-long, particularly close and productive bond.\n\nXinjiang: China\u2019s massive repression of its Muslim population, especially of the Uyghurs in its far western province of Xinjiang, has met with a collective shrug from such Muslim notables as Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. This inexcusable lack of concern contrasts dramatically with the Muslim world\u2019s prolonged tantrum over little Israel\u2019s far milder treatment of the Palestinians, It also signals that China\u2019s size, power and ruthlessness renders it free to repress Islamic religion and culture within its domains and perhaps beyond.\n\nHigh-tech dictatorship: The \u201cChina model\u201d of surveillance, censorship, monitoring and repression has become an important export commodity. It also has terrible implications: The ChiCom ability to control every aspect of its subjects\u2019 lives (think smartphones as spy devices and 200GB photographs) through innovative and ubiquitous technologies hugely enhances the power of the state.\n\nNot surprisingly, these find a ready market in the Middle East. Chinese companies have helped Iran\u2019s mullahs to stay in power since the Green Movement of 2009. They have taken over nearly all of Egypt\u2019s telecommunications, giving President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi vast controls to stifle his population. They are also worryingly active in Lebanon and Saudi Arabia (and elsewhere, too, such as Africa and Latin America).\n\nFaithful to Communist anti-imperialist dogma, Mr. Xi strenuously denies that his government seeks to develop a sphere of influence in the Middle East, instead proclaiming an innocent intent merely to help with economic development. Ignore the puffery: Beijing not only \u201cholds the power to alter alliances, political discourse, and even domestic freedoms throughout the region,\u201d as Mr. Berman puts it, but it intends to exploit that power to the maximum.\n\n\u2022 Daniel Pipes (DanielPipes.org, @DanielPipes) is president of the Middle East Forum.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
