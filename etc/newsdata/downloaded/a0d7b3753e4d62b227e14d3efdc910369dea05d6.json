Others made the same calculation, but Graham made the uber-tradeoff, because the stakes were so high. What did it matter if he had to endure temporary embarrassments, abase himself on cable television, or even become a political punchline, if he could stop Trump from impulsive decisions regarding Russia or North Korea? Or Syria?\n\nThe world saw Graham as a craven, cringing Uriah Heep. Graham saw himself as someone who could save the world, or at least the Kurds.\n\nGraham calculated: If he didn\u2019t play golf with Trump and indulge his penchant for pillow talk, Trump would be putting and chatting with Rand Paul, listening to the counsels of isolationism, appeasement and international amorality. He was not simply the adult in the room; he was the adult BFF in the room, who would temper Trump\u2019s worst instincts.\n\nAnd then came Trump\u2019s decision.\n\nDespite Graham\u2019s compulsive turd-polishing of the past few years, Trump didn\u2019t even consult him before making the decision to abandon the Kurds.", "description": "", "authors": ["Charles Sykes"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
