Although they\u2019re synonymous with family and business success today, there was a time when Chip and Joanna weren't very stable financially.\n\n\u201cWe were literally going from Friday to Friday saying \u2018Are we going to make it?\u2019\u201d Joanna explained in a video of the event shared by \u201cGood Morning America\u201d on Twitter.\n\nNot only were the couple trying to make a seemingly impossible dream happen, but they were doing it in a very tough economic climate.\n\nCHIP GAINES TELLS FANS TO SPREAD 'KINDNESS' AFTER EL PASO, DAYTON MASS SHOOTINGS\n\n\u201cThe four or five years before we did the show, all that stuff, when the housing crisis hit and things were so hard for us, we kept pressing through,\u201d Joanna continued. \u201cBut even in those hard times, the value of what we learned in that is something that I would never want to do again, but I would never not want that. I think the hard is what really makes us appreciate this.\u201d\n\nAfter tying the knot in 2003, Chip explained, the idea of working together was difficult for them at first. However, he notes that they quickly learned that fostering an atmosphere of respect toward one another was vital to putting them in the position they\u2019re in today.\n\nJOANNA GAINES SHARES REDESIGN TIPS AFTER SHOWING OFF NEWLY RENOVATED HEADQUARTERS\n\n\u201cThis is a very hard thing to do, to work together with someone you also have a relationship and a family with,\u201d Chip said, adding: \u201cI would argue that, at the end of the day we learned early that we\u2019re a lot stronger and a lot more powerful when we\u2019re pulling together as opposed to pulling against each other. And we\u2019re a powerful force when we operate like that.\u201d\n\nChip concluded: \u201cSolid mutual respect. Lots of hard work goes into this, but at the end of the day I think if you can get to a mutual place of respect, you can change the world.\u201d\n\nHis comments echo those Joanna gave about starting their own cable network now that their hit show \u201cFixer Upper\u201d has ended.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cWhen I get nervous or afraid, the part that gets me up every day is that fact that we get to climb these steep mountains together,\" she said on Instagram. \"We have grown to love the unknown and the risks and challenges that come with it. That\u2019s what makes us feel alive and young.\"", "description": "As they prepare to launch their own cable network, Chip and Joanna Gaines are reflecting on the early days when their careers were a struggle.", "authors": ["Tyler Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/04/04/694940094001_5763827273001_5763813147001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
