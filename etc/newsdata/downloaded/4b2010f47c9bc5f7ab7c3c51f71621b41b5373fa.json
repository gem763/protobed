About 1.9 million people\u2019s names have been left off the list. Anyone who can\u2019t prove they are living in the state legally risks being stripped of his or her citizenship and potentially deported. The state government, run by Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party, says the move is needed to identify illegal migrants. Critics accuse it of pushing a Hindu nationalist agenda that seeks to clear out Muslims.\n\n1. What\u2019s the background?\n\nIllegal migration has been a source of ethnic conflict and political unrest in Assam for decades. When Bangladesh declared independence in 1971, leading to a war with Pakistan, many families fled across the border into India to escape the fighting, settling in Assam. Some were granted citizenship, while others never registered. BJP president Amit Shah, Modi\u2019s home affairs minister, promised at a rally in 2018 to purge the voter list of \u201cinfiltrators.\u201c\n\n2. What\u2019s the list?\n\nIt\u2019s called the National Register of Citizenship, although it only covers the roughly 33 million people living in Assam state. It was first prepared after a 1951 national census, and debate about updating it has been going on for years. Draft lists released in 2018 and 2019 excluded some 4.1 million residents -- roughly equal to the population of Ireland or the U.S. state of Oregon.\n\n3. How do you qualify?\n\nThe government released a number of criteria for registering, including people whose names were on the 1951 census or on voting lists in Assam up to midnight on March 24, 1971 -- the day before Bangladesh declared independence -- and their descendants. People who arrived from Bangladesh before that date, registered and became Indian citizens also qualify. The registration is being monitored by India\u2019s Supreme Court.\n\n4. What if you\u2019re not on the list?\n\nModi\u2019s federal government and the BJP-run state government have assured people that those left off the list won\u2019t face detention immediately and will be given opportunities to appeal. But millions of people who have been there for decades are living in fear of losing their rights to vote or own property, access welfare programs -- or worse. Many are afraid they will be forced into detention camps or deported to Bangladesh if they can\u2019t prove their identities, a process that could take months.\n\n5. Could it spread to other states?\n\nStripping Bengali-speaking Muslims and other minorities of Indian citizenship is part of the BJP\u2019s election platform, which saw Modi re-elected in May 2019 with a greater mandate. BJP politicians want to replicate the Assam move nationwide, potentially leading to a surge in sectarian violence at a time when India\u2019s economy is slowing. Muslims in India suffered another setback in August when Modi scrapped the autonomy of Kashmir, a disputed region between India and Pakistan. Moreover, the Modi government has tried to push legislation that would offer citizenship to illegal migrants from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan who are of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian descent. Modi\u2019s political opponents say it\u2019s a move to shelter non-Muslim refugees and push its core ideology.\n\nMillions May Be Left Stateless in India\u2019s Citizenship CrackdownThe government of Assam answers FAQs on the registry.QuickTakes on why India and Pakistan keep clashing, and India\u2019s caste system.An opinion piece: A flawed process that pleased none\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Bibhudatta Pradhan in New Delhi at bpradhan@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ruth Pollard at rpollard2@bloomberg.net, ;Paul Geitner at pgeitner2@bloomberg.net, Daniel Ten Kate\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Officials in Assam -- a lush, tea-growing state in northeastern India -- have published an updated citizenship registry for the first time in decades.
