And of course it isn\u2019t really.\u201d\n\n(PA Graphics)\n\nThe PM had spoken to his Irish counterpart by telephone for about 40 minutes earlier in the day.\n\nMr Johnson needs a deal sorted by the end of October 17/18 if he is to avoid a dilemma over the Benn Act, which compels him to ask Brussels for an extension if he cannot get an agreement past MPs when he returns, a move he has ruled out taking.\n\nEarlier there was fury in Brussels following a series of No 10 briefings claiming German Chancellor Angela Merkel had made clear a deal was now \u201coverwhelmingly unlikely\u201d.\n\nNo 10 sources claimed Mrs Merkel had told the PM that Britain could not leave the EU unless it was prepared to leave Northern Ireland behind in a permanent customs union.\n\n.@BorisJohnson, what\u2019s at stake is not winning some stupid blame game. At stake is the future of Europe and the UK as well as the security and interests of our people. You don\u2019t want a deal, you don\u2019t want an extension, you don\u2019t want to revoke, quo vadis? \u2014 Donald Tusk (@eucopresident) October 8, 2019\n\nEuropean Council president Donald Tusk accused Mr Johnson of engaging in a \u201cstupid blame game\u201d ahead of next week\u2019s crucial EU summit.\n\n\u201cAt stake is the future of Europe and the UK as well as the security and interests of our people,\u201d he tweeted.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want a deal, you don\u2019t want an extension, you don\u2019t want to revoke, quo vadis (where are you going)?\u201d\n\nBut Jean-Claude Juncker went on to say that if negotiations fail, \u201cthe explanation will be found in the British camp (because) the original sin is found on the islands and not on the continent\u201d.\n\nSpeaking to the French Les Echos newspaper, the European Commission president added: \u201cA no-deal Brexit would lead to a collapse of the United Kingdom at a weakening of growth on the continent.\u201d\n\nThe PM also hosted European Parliament president David Sassoli in Downing Street on Tuesday, but the MEP left saying \u201cno progress\u201d had been made.\n\nMr Sassoli later told the BBC\u2019s Newsnight programme: \u201cAngela Merkel\u2019s opinions must be taken seriously. We are all very worried because there are only a few days left.\n\n\u201cBecause we understand that going out without an agreement leads to having a real problem, if not a real catastrophe.\u201d\n\nMr Johnson had reiterated to the president his warning that the UK would leave by the Halloween deadline regardless of whether a deal was in place.\n\nHardball tactics from No 10 even alarmed some ministers, after sources warned Britain could break off security co-operation with the EU if it was prevented from leaving on October 31.\n\nNorthern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith tweeted that \u201cany threat on withdrawing security co-operation with Ireland is unacceptable\u201d.\n\nThe dramatic escalation in the war of words between Brussels and London followed a telephone call on Tuesday between Mr Johnson and Mrs Merkel to discuss the latest UK proposal to resolve the deadlock over the Northern Ireland backstop.\n\nEU leaders have dismissed the plan as the basis for a settlement as it would mean the return of customs checks on the island of Ireland, albeit taking place well away from the border between the North and the Republic.\n\nA No 10 source said Mrs Merkel had told the Prime Minister Ireland must at least have a veto on Northern Ireland leaving the EU with the rest of the UK.\n\n\u201cIt was a very useful clarifying moment in all sorts of ways,\u201d the unnamed source, quoted by Sky News, said.\n\n\u201cIf this represents a new established position, then it means a deal is essentially impossible, not just now but ever.\u201d\n\nThe PM\u2019s official spokesman acknowledged there had been a \u201cfrank exchange\u201d with Mrs Merkel and that the talks had reached a \u201ccritical point\u201d, but refused to be drawn any further on the \u201csource\u201d claims.\n\nThe row followed a briefing to The Spectator magazine, also citing a contact in No 10, warning the Government could do \u201call sorts of things\u201d to get around the Benn Act, which requires the PM to seek a further Brexit delay if he cannot get a deal by October 19.\n\nThe source \u2013 widely thought to be Mr Johnson\u2019s chief adviser Dominic Cummings \u2013 said it would treat any support by EU leaders for a new extension as \u201chostile interference\u201d in UK politics, and that future defence and security co-operation would \u201cinevitably\u201d be affected.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t engage in further talks, we obviously won\u2019t given any undertakings about co-operative behaviour, everything to do with \u2018duty of sincere cooperation\u2019 will be in the toilet,\u201d the source said.", "description": "Boris Johnson will hope to gain concessions from his Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar during in-person talks anticipated later this week.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/09/wire-19481428-1570609715-963_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
