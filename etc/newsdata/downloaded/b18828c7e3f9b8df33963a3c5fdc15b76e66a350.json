While I fully endorse civilian control of the military, I would not surrender my independent judgment. In 2010, I argued strongly against pulling all our troops out of Iraq. In 2011, I urged retaliation against Iran for plotting to blow up a restaurant in our nation\u2019s capital. In 2012, I argued for retaining a small but capable contingent of troops in Afghanistan. Each step along the way, I argued for political clarity and offered options that could give the Commander in Chief a rheostat he could dial up or down to protect our nation. While I had the right to be heard on military matters, my judgment was only advice, to be ignored or accepted. I obeyed without mental reservation our Commander in Chief and carried out every order to the best of my ability. In December 2012, I received an unauthorized phone call telling me that in an hour, the Pentagon would be announcing my relief. I was leaving a region aflame and in disarray. The lack of an integrated regional strategy had left us adrift, and our friends confused. We were offering no leadership or direction. I left my post deeply disturbed that we had shaken our friends\u2019 confidence and created vacuums that our adversaries would exploit. I was disappointed and frustrated that policymakers all too often failed to deliver clear direction. And lacking a defined mission statement, I frequently didn\u2019t know what I was expected to accomplish\u2026 We must mean what we say, to both allies and foes: no more false threats or failing to live up to our word.\n\nBoy, it\u2019s a good thing we ended that old Obama era of being soft on our enemies and harsh on our friends and allies, right?", "description": "It seems like a good time to review one of the closing passages of Call Sign Chaos, the autobiography of James Mattis.", "authors": ["Jim Geraghty", "Andrew C.
