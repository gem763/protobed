Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI). Tulsi endorsed Bernie Sanders in 2016. Clinton floated this insane theory that Rep. Gabbard was being groomed by the Russians to mount a third-party run to ensure a Trump victory in 2020. There is zero evidence to support this allegation. She also went after Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate, whom some in the Clinton camp think cost Lady Macbeth votes as well. It\u2019s very clear that Hillary still hasn\u2019t moved on from 2016, and the same could be said for her allies in the party. It\u2019s sad. But this descent into madness isn\u2019t outside the mainstream of liberal audiences.\n\nWhile Rolling Stone suffered a knifing to the kidneys and heart over the University of Virginia rape story that turned out to be a total hoax which led to the magazine being sued and found guilty of libel, its analysis of the Russian agent paranoia that had engulfed the Democratic Party was pretty spot on. In short, the Democratic Party position on this subject is that we\u2019re all Russian agents now. It\u2019s ironic in two ways. First, the so-called intellectual elite, those who think that rural Americans and those without college degrees are trash, falling victim and being susceptible to digesting such tin foil hat garbage is priceless. These condescending and utterly revolting people appear to be so incapable of understanding why they lost in 2016 they\u2019ve resorted to InfoWars-like cuckoo theories over why Trump is where he is at present. Second, remember when Democrats laughed at Mitt Romney about Russia being our biggest geopolitical foe? This was anachronistic, right? Well, post-2016, the Left has their own red scare brewing their minds, driving them insane, and leaving them spewing total insanity to the masses. The Russians were a joke in 2012, and now they\u2019re everywhere. Oh, man\u2014there is not enough popcorn for this show (via Rolling Stone):\n\nHillary Clinton is nuts. She\u2019s also not far from the Democratic Party mainstream, which has been pushing the same line for years. Less than a week before Clinton\u2019s outburst, the New York Times \u2014 once a symbol of stodgy, hyper-cautious reporting \u2014 ran a feature called, \u201cWhat, Exactly, is Tulsi Gabbard Up To?\u201d The piece speculated about the \u201csuspicious activity\u201d surrounding Gabbard\u2019s campaign, using quotes from the neoconservative think-tank, the Alliance For Securing Democracy, to speculate about Gabbard\u2019s Russian support. [\u2026] Neoconservative-turned-#Resistance hero David Frum blasted Trump for defending Stein and Gabbard, noting sarcastically, \u201cHe was supposed to pretend they were not all on the same team.\u201d Ana Navarro on CNN said, \u201cWhen both the Russians and Trump support someone, be wary.\u201d An MSNBC panel noted, in apparent seriousness, that Gabbard \u201cnever denied being a Russian asset.\u201d CNN media critic Brian Stelter tried to suggest Hillary only seemed wacko thanks to a trick of the red enemy, saying, \u201cIt feels like a disinformation situation where the Russians want this kind of disinformation.\u201d [\u2026] Everyone is foreign scum these days. Democrats spent three years trying to prove Donald Trump is a Russian pawn. Mitch McConnell is \u201cMoscow Mitch.\u201d Third party candidates are a Russian plot. The Bernie Sanders movement is not just a wasteland of racist and misogynist \u201cBros,\u201d but \u2014 according to intelligence agencies and mainstream pundits alike \u2014 the beneficiary of an ambitious Russian plot to \u201cstoke the divide\u201d within the Democratic Party. The Joe Rogan independents attracted to the mild antiwar message of Tulsi Gabbard are likewise traitors and dupes for the Kremlin. If you\u2019re keeping score, that\u2019s pretty much the whole spectrum of American political thought, excepting MSNBC Democrats. What a coincidence! [\u2026] The #Resistance has come up with all sorts of words for such fifth-columnists and deviationists: they are \u201cfalse-balancers\u201d or \u201cfalse equivalencers,\u201d \u201cneo-Naderites,\u201d \u201cpurity-testers,\u201d \u201cboth-sidesists,\u201d \u201cwhataboutists,\u201d \u201chorseshoe theorists,\u201d \u201cRussia skeptics\u201d or \u201cRussia denialists,\u201d and \u201canti-anti-Trumpers.\u201d Such heretics are all ultimately seen as being on \u201cteam Putin.\u201d This witch-hunting insanity isn\u2019t just dangerous, it\u2019s a massive breach from reality.\n\nGranted, Matt Taibbi, who wrote the piece, isn\u2019t complimentary of Trump at all\u2014but he does note that his 2016 win was due to years of brewing anger and distrust over the political establishment. You lost because you suck pretty much\u2014and the Democrats have yet to learn that lesson.", "description": ".10/22/2019 16:47:20PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads", "Cortney O'Brien", "Guy Benson"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/152/91a64dbb-6549-4545-be71-b3201d31f72a.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
