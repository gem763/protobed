Richard Burr, R-N.C., right, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., committee vice chair, released Part II of a report on Russian Active Measures\n\n'Masking as Americans,' the operatives used targeted ads, 'falsified news articles,' and their own content to 'deceive tens of millions of social media users.'\n\nThe St. Petersburg troll farm, with the anodyne name the Internet Research Agency, sought to influence the election by 'harming Hillary Clinton's chances of success and supporting Donald Trump at the direction of the Kremlin,' according to the report.\n\nThe stark characterization comes as the election's winner, President Trump, is an facing impeachment inquiry in the Democratic-controlled House in part over his efforts to get the Ukrainian president to investigate rival Joe Biden and his son, as well as pursue a theory of election interference other than the one outlined in the 88-page unclassified report.\n\nThe Russian interference was bent on 'harming Hillary Clinton's chances of success and supporting Donald Trump at the direction of the Kremlin,' according to the report.\n\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton contended with fake news stories, such as one highly-shared article that the pope endorsed Donald Trump, and another that she provided arms to ISIS\n\nTrump, in a July 25 call, told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to 'find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike... I guess you have one of your wealthy people... The server, they say Ukraine has it,' according to a transcript Trump ordered released.\n\nThe theory Trump was promoting suggested a Ukrainian containing Hillary Clinton's deleted emails resided in Ukraine. Trump and lawyer Rudy Giuliani have also pushed the theory that rival forces in Ukraine went after now-jailed Trump 2016 campaign chair Paul Manafort, in what they describe as foreign election interference.\n\nThe Senate committee found the Russian information warfare campaign was 'broad in scope,' and included such goals as undermining faith in the democratic process, to 'denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency.'\n\nThe committee found the IRA's social media campaign 'was overtly and almost invariably supportive of then-candidate Trump, and to the detriment of Secretary Clinton's campaign.'\n\nThe report describes the funding role of conduit Yevgeniy Prigozhin, known as 'Putin's chef.' His proximity to top Russian officials, including Putin, 'point to significant Kremlin support, authorization, and direction of the IRA's operation and goals,' they write.'\n\nIt references Russian officials indicted by the Justice Department as part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe, which President Trump branded a 'witch hunt.'\n\n'No single group' was targeted by the ads more than African-Americans, according to the report.\n\nIn a section on coopting 'unwitting' Americans, the report points to on-line organizing and rally operations. 'In addition, posing as U.S. political activists, the IRA requested \u2013 and in some cases obtained \u2013 assistance from the Trump Campaign in procuring materials for rallies and organizing the rallies.\n\nThe report cites academic research that in the final three months of the campaign, total shares and reactions to top-performing deliberately false stories outperformed the top real news stories. A fake story on Pope Francis endorsing Trump got 960,000 shares and reactions.\n\nThey cite a University of Southern California study that one-fifth of political tweets may actually have been automated bots.\n\nTrump told Ukrainian President Zelensky, shortly after the Ukrainian brought up needed U.S. military hardware: 'I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike... I guess you have one of your wealthy people... The server, they say Ukraine has it.'\n\nThe president continued: 'There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation. I think you're surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it. As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it's very important that you do it if that's possible.'\n\nThe report cites a long history of Russian disinformation, or dezinformatsiya, campaigns. (The term appears in a 1952 Great Soviet Encyclopedia). Past active measures have included: Fake KGB letters on the Kennedy assassination; targeting Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Ronald Reagan; false claims about the 1979 seizure of the Grand Mosque of Mecca; and a Cold War conspiracy theory pinning the AIDS virus on U.S. military researchers.\n\nSergey Tretyzkov, a former SVR station chief in New York, is quoted writing in 2008: 'Nothing has changed ...
