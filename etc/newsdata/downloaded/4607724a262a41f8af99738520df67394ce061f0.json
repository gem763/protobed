Vice Media is merging Vice News and Viceland and recently has added staffers to its news division, one of the people said.\n\nBrooklyn, N.Y.-based Vice Media, primarily known as a digital-media company with edgy content aimed at younger audiences, launched Viceland in 2016, hoping to diversify its revenue and burnish its brand.\n\nEmployees who were laid off were told the network now has less need for in-house staffers, one of the people said.\n\nVice Media declined to comment.\n\nVice Media Chief Executive Nancy Dubuc has prioritized getting the company to profitability. The Wall Street Journal reported in late 2018 the company was on track to lose more than $50 million that year on revenue of $600 million to $650 million. In January, the company laid off about 10% of its workforce, or about 250 jobs.\n\nThe company exceeded its revenue goals in the first half of 2019, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nMs. Dubuc has prioritized five core areas of investment for the company, including a studio business that produces movies and television shows for third parties, news, digital, TV and Virtue, its in-house advertising agency.\n\nIn May, Vice raised $250 million in debt from a group of investors that included George Soros.\n\nWrite to Sahil Patel at sahil.patel@wsj.com andBenjamin Mullin at Benjamin.Mullin@wsj.com", "description": "The job cuts, some of which took place Thursday, impact about 15 people across multiple departments such as programming, marketing and research, the people said.", "authors": ["Sahil Patel", "Benjamin Mullin", "Sahil.Patel Wsj.Com", "Benjamin.Mullin Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-102705/social"}
