Health officials have warned the drops are 'unacceptable' and 'concerning'\n\nHelen Bedford, professor of children's health at University College London's Institute of Child Health, said: 'It's about making immunisation more accessible for everybody and to do that we need to look at how our services are constructed.\n\n'It's about offering vaccination in places other than general practices - so places where families go routinely, maybe even supermarkets or pop-up places, that's the kind of thing we need to be looking at.'\n\nShe said busy family life and needing to take time off work to get children vaccinated are all barriers to people making sure youngsters are up-to-date.\n\n'You may be a working parent, you may have one child in nursery, one child in school and it's simply difficult to get to the GP at the appointed hour,' she said.\n\nAlmost all of the 20 areas with the lowest levels of MMR coverage at the age of five were in London, figures have revealed. Only Surrey, which ranked 20th lowest with 79 per cent, was outside of the capital city\n\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock has said he would consider 'bold action' such as taking children out of school if they haven't had the proper vaccinations to protect themselves and others\n\n'Often in the melee of a busy family life, people often simply forget or don't get round to getting their children immunised, particularly when it comes to the pre-school booster.'\n\nProfessor Bedford added: 'I don't think we should imposing anything on people, we should be having dialogue with our communities about what is best for them.\n\n'To go towards mandation, when we don't have all these other things, is just a knee jerk reaction.'\n\nHelen Donovan, of the Royal College of Nursing, said vaccinations could be given in places such as children's centres or nurseries.\n\nWHAT WILL THE GOVERNMENT AND NHS DO TO IMPROVE VACCINATION RATES? The Department of Health and the NHS are expected to produce a comprehensive strategy for improving vaccination rates later this year. Health authorities said they will: Write to GPs to urge them to promote a catch-up vaccination scheme offering jabs to children and under-25s who missed theirs when they were young. Update information on its websites to address parents' concerns about the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, specifically using scientific evidence to address and disprove misleading claims.\n\nInvest more in 'local immunisation coordinators' to promote vaccination in families who are hard to reach and areas with low uptake.\n\nCall a meeting of social media companies, such as Facebook and Twitter, to discuss how to stop false information about vaccines spreading online.\n\n'Even within general practice it's about having a flexible system,' she said.\n\n'We need more evening surgeries and weekend surgeries so working parents don't have to take time off to get their youngsters vaccinated.\n\n'Most working parents... the idea of taking your child to a clinic in the middle of the day is very difficult because one or the other parent needs to take the time off work.\n\n'We need more evening clinics, more weekend clinics so people don't have to take time off work.\n\n'I think what we're talking about is being a bit more flexible about family life.\n\n'So when we see very young children the uptake is higher, but when you get to school-aged children and booster vaccines generally, the uptake is lower - because it's the access, the melee of family life bit.'\n\nDr David Elliman, consultant community paediatrician at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London, said he was in favour of clinics being set up in places such as music festivals.\n\nThat would help reach those in their late teens and early 20s who may have missed their measles jab when they were a children, when vaccination rates were at an all-time low in the wake of the Andrew Wakfield controversy.\n\nDr Elliman said: 'We need to make it as easy as possible for people to be vaccinated.\n\n'That may mean going to them, rather than expecting them to come to a clinic.\n\n'All you need is a medical professional, a room and the jab. It could be a Portacabin in the local supermarket carpark or at a music festival.'\n\nHe said mandatory vaccination should not be introduced to 'prop up' failures in the system.\n\n'There really is no convincing evidence from anywhere that it works,' he said, adding: 'We could make things worse.'\n\nLast month, Mr Hancock said he would not rule out bold action to protect children after figures showed fewer are receiving routine NHS vaccinations.", "description": "Doctors have dismissed calls for compulsory vaccinations for UK children as a 'knee-jerk reaction'.
