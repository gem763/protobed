The numbers will only be visible to the person who posted them.\n\nFacebook\u2019s move comes after Instagram removed the number of likes on its platform in Australia in July.\n\nFacebook is the latest social platform to remove the number of likes on posts, beginning with a test right here in Australia.\n\nIn a limited test, the social networking giant is removing the ability for others to see the number of likes, reactions and views on your posts. Instead, the numbers will be private and only visible to you.\n\nFacebook told Business Insider Australia in an email that the move is designed improve the well-being of users and shift the focus from the quantity to the quality of interactions on your posts.\n\nIn other words, Facebook doesn\u2019t want you to focus on the number of likes or reactions you get, but instead the quality of the photos and videos you share.\n\n\u201cWe want Facebook to be a place where people can connect and share in ways most valuable to them,\u201d Facebook Australia director of policy, Mia Garlick told Business Insider Australia in an email.\n\n\u201cWe want to understand from people whether removing the total counts improves their experience, while also not limiting any positive interactions.\u201d\n\nBefore and after the removal of likes.

So during this test we want to assess whether hiding reactions helps people feel more comfortable sharing while not limiting their interactions.\u201d\n\nAfter seeing how people engage with the new format, Facebook plans to evaluate whether to roll it out more broadly.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
