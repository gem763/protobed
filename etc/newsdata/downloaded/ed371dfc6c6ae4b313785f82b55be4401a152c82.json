Bregman mashed a grand slam in the seventh inning to give Houston a 7-run edge.\n\n\u201cI was just trying to hit the ball in the air and drive in the run and ended up driving in four,\u201d Bregman told Fox Sports. \u201cWhat a great team win. We did a great job today of coming out and applying pressure.\u201d\n\nAstros starter Jose Urquidy dominated on the hill, allowing just two hits and heaving four strikeouts in five scoreless innings.
