REUTERS/Leah Millis\n\nDemocratic Senators Joe Manchin and Chris Murphy and Republican Senator Pat Toomey told reporters they had a 40-minute telephone conversation with Trump to discuss gun control. They added that they hoped the president would convey a decision by Thursday.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the White House following that call, Trump was vague about the prospects for enacting new gun legislation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at background checks,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cAt the same time, all of us want to protect our great Second Amendment\u201d to the U.S. Constitution guaranteeing the right to bear arms.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to take a look at a lot of different things and we\u2019ll be reporting back in a short period of time,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe issue of gun violence re-emerged in Congress after back-to-back mass shootings in Texas and Ohio last month.\n\nManchin and Toomey teamed up six years ago with a gun background check bill. On Wednesday, Toomey said: \u201cOur best chance of success would be to broaden background checks to include commercial gun sales,\u201d such as ones conducted over the internet and at gun shows.\n\nHe added that those sales, largely unregulated, provide a way \u201cfor violent criminals and those dangerously mentally ill to have a way to easily obtain firearms.\u201d\n\nManchin, referring to Trump, said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to know hopefully by tomorrow if there\u2019s something we can all agree on.\u201d\n\nIn December, 2012, a shooter killed 26 people, including 20 children, at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Murphy\u2019s home state of Connecticut.\n\nThe mass murder sparked a gun control debate in Congress that produced a Manchin-Toomey background check bill in the Senate.\n\nAmid fierce lobbying against the bill by the National Rifle Association and gun industry groups, the measure failed in April, 2013.\n\nIt was not clear whether the senators intend to push a carbon-copy of the Manchin-Toomey bill from 2013 or an altered version. The original bill would have exempted checks on gun sales or gifts among family members and friends.\n\nMany Democrats are demanding Senate passage of a House of Representatives bill approved in February that would have tightened controls on gun sales while providing narrow exemptions, such as certain sales of gifts between spouses.\n\nThe White House threatened to veto that bill and Representative Steve Scalise, the No. 2 House Republican, returned from a meeting with Trump on Tuesday telling reporters \u201cWe\u2019re not going there,\u201d when asked about the House-passed bill.", "description": "A bipartisan group of U.S. senators on Wednesday said they would try to revive a failed 2013 bill to close loopholes on the law requiring gun sale background checks, but were awaiting word on whether President Donald Trump will support their effort.", "authors": ["Richard Cowan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428795769&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A1OR", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
