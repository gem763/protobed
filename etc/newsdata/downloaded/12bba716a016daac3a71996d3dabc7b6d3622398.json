Just slipped, but I\u2019m not going to let it derail me,\u201d Affleck told TMZ when they caught up with him visiting his ex-wife Jennifer Garner's house on Sunday.\n\nThe actor has had a well-documented struggle with alcohol addiction since the 1990s and has gone through waves of sobriety. Affleck even opened up about his sobriety on Instagram earlier on Saturday.\n\n\u201cBut let\u2019s be serious for a moment and talk about something that is actually important. I have been in recovery for over a year and part of that is helping out others,\u201d Affleck said before plugging The Midnight Mission, an organization dedicated to serving the homeless in Southern California.\n\nBEN AFFLECK'S PERSONAL ISSUES, FROM REHAB STINTS TO JENNIFER GARNER SPLIT\n\n\u201c@themidnightmission is an incredible organization that helps those in need with housing, training, development and recovery. I\u2019m making a donation today because there are people battling addiction every day that don\u2019t have the resources and need help,\u201d the actor noted.\n\nThe embattled actor\u2019s most recent stint in rehab occurred in October 2018.\n\nIn an Instagram post from then, the actor noted that he completed a 40-day stay at a treatment center and spoke candidly about being an addict.\n\nBEN AFFLECK OPENS UP ABOUT TREATMENT FOR ALCOHOL ADDICTION\n\n\u201cBattling any addiction is a lifelong and difficult struggle. Because of that, one is never really in or out of treatment. It is a full-time commitment. I am fighting for myself and my family,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHe then thanked \u201cfamily, colleagues and fans\u201d for their support. \u201cSo many people have reached out on social media and spoken about their own journeys with addiction. To those people, I want to say thank you.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Your strength is inspiring and is supporting me in ways I didn\u2019t think was possible. It helps to know I am not alone. As I\u2019ve had to remind myself, if you have a problem, getting help is a sign of courage, not weakness or failure. With acceptance and humility, I continue to avail myself with the help of so many people and I am grateful to all those who are there for me.\"", "description": "The \u201cJustice League\u201d star was spotted Saturday donning a dark suit and a skull mask while\u00a0stumbling out of a Halloween bash\u00a0\u2014 although it is unclear why he stumbled.", "authors": ["Andy Sahadeo"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/10/ben-affleck.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
