We will see at the end of the week if a purely technical extension of a few days is necessary, to finish this parliamentary procedure,\" the e-mail said.\n\n\"But outside these circumstances, an extension to buy time or to discuss the agreement again is excluded. We have reached a deal, and now it must be implemented without delay.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for de Montchalin was not able to tell Euronews if France would oppose a three-month extension at this point.\n\nHow does France feel about a no-deal Brexit?\n\nA no-deal Brexit remains a very unfavourable possibility for the EU, said de Montchalin.\n\n\"We believe that this deal should be able to get a 'yes' or 'no' answer,\" she said. \"What is paradoxical today is that nobody can get behind or reject the deal completely.\"\n\n\"So before turning towards a no-deal, we must give ourselves the chance to know if it's 'yes' or it's 'no'. If this ratification doesn't arrive so then we must ask ourselves some question.\"\n\n\"If it's a yes, then they must get a couple of extra days to (ratify the agreement).\"\n\n\"Don't take what France says at face value\"\n\nHowever, for Larissa Brunner, a policy analyst at the European Policy Centre, it's important to take what France says with a pinch of salt.\n\n\"What France says publicly is not necessarily what it is going to say behind closed doors in a European Council setting because the French government has in mind its domestic audience. It would play very well domestically to adopt a tough line (on the issue),\" she said.\n\nBrunner also believes that France adopts a tough line because it sees it as part of a tactic to get the UK parliament to make a decision quickly.\n\n\"Even last April, France advocated quite a tough stance because it thought that by putting the UK under a lot of pressure then you increased the chances of parliament approving the deal.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure we can take the rhetoric at face value,\" added Brunner.\n\n\"I do believe that France is pretty fed up with this but at the same time, France has (since the beginning of the Brexit process) have had a bad cop role in a way and I think that\u2019s necessary to some extent in such complex negotiations,\" said Brunner.\n\nThe analyst is convinced that even if France doesn't want a long extension, it can be convinced otherwise by other member states and she certainly doesn't see France vetoing any extension.\n\n\"That would be quite unexpected.\"\n\nSo how does the European Council deal with diverging views on extension timeframes?\n\nThe EU will reach an agreement by compromise, as they always do, said Brunner.\n\n\"I think it\u2019s going to depend on how strongly France and other countries feel about their positions behind those closed doors,\" she said,\n\nBrunner noted that what the EU ultimately wants is an orderly withdrawal, so \"going against what every other member state wants with regard to transition takes quite a lot of political capital.\"\n\nThe question for the analyst then becomes \"would France really like to use all of its political capital on this question of extension rather than on other issues\" and for now it's not clear how strongly countries feel about the issue.", "description": "French Deputy Minister for European Affairs Amelie de Montchalin said Paris was ready to grant a \"technical\" extension for \"a few days\" so the UK parliament could complete the ratification process but would oppose a broader extension intended to \"rediscuss the agreement.\"", "authors": ["Cristina Abellan Matamoros"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/25/30/72/1000x563_cmsv2_89122ec0-c942-5495-8efb-b5b7ae54915f-4253072.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
