It was the third different Trump course for the duo, who previously hit the links together at Trump International Golf Club, West Palm Beach in April 2018 and at Trump National Golf Club, Jupiter (Florida) in February 2017.\n\nIn total, Abe now has met with Trump at five different Trump businesses. In addition to the golf clubs, in September 2018 Abe saw Trump at Trump Tower in New York City and in April 2018 he visited Mar-a-Lago. (During that meeting, Abe and other guests at the president\u2019s private club witnessed firsthand the U.S. response to a North Korean ballistic missile test.)\n\nWith a firearms\u2019 exporters conference scheduled at his D.C. hotel this summer, Trump announces U.S. withdrawal from Arms Trade Treaty\n\nFrom \u201cTrump reverses U.S. course on Arms Trade Treaty during speech at NRA in Indianapolis\u201d by Ginger Rough and Deirdre Shesgreen for USA Today:\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Friday that he would pull out of the Arms Trade Treaty, a global 2014 pact designed to regulate the sale of conventional weapons, from guns to battle tanks\u2026 Critics accused Trump of pandering the gun lobby with the move, while supporters said it would free the U.S. from unnecessary constraints on its domestic arms industry.\n\nAs 1100 Pennsylvania reported earlier this month, the Firearms and Ammunition Import/Export Roundtable will host its annual Firearms Import/Export Conference July 30\u2013Aug. 1 at the Trump Hotel D.C.\n\nSupport 1100 Pennsylvania: never-redacted reporting on President Trump\u2019s D.C. hotel\n\nWe now know most of what\u2019s in the Mueller report.

President Trump is expected to arrive at Shannon Airport on June 6 or 7 and stay at his hotel in Doonbeg, according to tentative arrangements revealed to Extra.ie last night. He will be in France for the 75th anniversary of D-Day on June 6 and is expected here on a brief stopover, to stay at his hotel and play golf there.\n\nPro-veterans group celebrated war documentary at commander-in-chief\u2019s hotel\n\nThe Academy of U.S. Veterans hosted a reception for war correspondents to celebrate the documentary Mosul at the Trump Hotel D.C. on Saturday. Among those who attended were Emmy winner and Academy Award nominee Shohreh Aghdashloo; Huffington Post writer Alex Mohajer; One America News Network political correspondent Neil McCabe; and the movie\u2019s director and producer, Daniel Gabriel.\n\nThe academy\u2019s mission is to \u201csupport, promote and recognize Veterans Service Organizations, Veteran Programs and Veteran Owned Businesses nationwide...all on the red carpet.\u201d A representative from the academy has not replied to an inquiry asking why it chose to hold the event at the president\u2019s hotel and how much it paid to do so.\n\nNotable sightings\n\nOn Sunday, President Trump golfed with Sen. Lindsay Graham (R\u2013SC) at Trump National Golf Club, Washington, D.C. in Sterling, Virginia, per the White House press pool. A guest at the president\u2019s business got a photo of Trump.\n\nRudy.\n\nRudy.\n\nRudy.\n\nIt was \u201cpeace, unity, and love\u201d for Trump hotel regulars Ximena Barreto, a former Trump political appointee in the Department of Health and Human Services who resigned after CNN and Media Matters reported she\u2019d \u201cspread conspiracies and made anti-Muslim comments,\u201d and Rabia Kazan, the president of the pro-Trump Middle Eastern Women's Coalition and a director of the National Diversity Coalition for Trump.\n\nA senior policy counsel for Rep.

As 1100 Pennsylvania previously reported, in January, Candie Cane released a video of herself urinating on the carpet there (you\u2019re on your own for the link for that one too). Anecdotally, more boudoir-and-up photo shoots take place at the Trump Hotel Chicago than at any of the president\u2019s other properties.\n\nOther Trump Organization news\n\nHouse investigations, current status (latest changes, April 24, 2019)\n\nPresident Trump chose not to divest; Americans need to know who\u2019s paying him\n\nUnlike his predecessors, Donald Trump did not divest his businesses upon becoming U.S. president.
