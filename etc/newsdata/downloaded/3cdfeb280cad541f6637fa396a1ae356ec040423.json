He had socked away an amount equal to 25 years' worth of his annual expenses \u2014 the magic number for reaching financial independence, he writes.\n\nBerger says how much we spend and save act like levers \u2014 adjusting them will increase or decrease the time it takes to reach financial freedom. Importantly, income has less to do with it than you might think. Ultimately it depends on the share of income you spend, and by extension, the share of income you save \u2014 not necessarily the dollar amounts.\n\nHow to calculate your ideal savings rate\n\nTo help readers visualize the numbers, Berger created a spreadsheet that calculates how many years you need to save depending on your spending rate and the return rate on your investments.\n\nLet's say you're starting with zero savings. If you make $100,000 a year, after taxes, and spend $80,000, that leaves $20,000 left over to save. Put another way, you have a spending rate of 80% and a saving rate of 20%.\n\nIf you plan to continue spending $80,000 annually in early retirement, you'll need $2 million in the bank before you leave work ($80,000 x 25). That'll take nearly 30 years if your spending and savings rates remain constant and your investments earn a 7% return.\n\nBut, if you spend just 50% of your $100,000 income \u2014 and plan to keep it that way in retirement \u2014 and thereby save 50%, then you'll only need $1.25 million banked before you retire ($50,000 x 25), which would take about half the time.\n\nHere are a few more examples, courtesy of Berger's spreadsheet calculator. (Note that these figures assume that you begin with $0 in savings, earn between 5% and 9% annually on your investments, and plan to withdraw 4% of your nest egg each year in retirement.)\n\nIf you want to retire in about five years , save 80% of your income\n\n, save 80% of your income If you want to retire in about 10 years , save 65% of your income\n\n, save 65% of your income If you want to retire in about 15 years , save 50% of your income\n\n, save 50% of your income If you want to retire in about 20 years, save about 35% of your income\n\nAs you can see, for every additional 15% of your income that you save, the number of years until early retirement is reduced by about five. The exactitude of this will depend on the return on your investments each year.\n\nThese calculations also don't take into account any increases in income. Say your take-home pay increases by 10% one year and you keep your level of spending the exact same. By directing that extra 10% into savings, you can reduce the time it takes to reach financial independence by a few years.\n\nAlso consider that your annual spending may go down after paying off debt, for instance, so your target number may decrease along the way as well.\n\nMore savings and retirement coverage", "description": "Here's how to calculate your ideal savings rate if you want to retire early, according to Rob Berger, author of \"Retire Before Mom and Dad.\"", "authors": ["Tanza Loudenback"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9cb598754caa4f96211e89?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
