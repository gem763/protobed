One popular line of cuddly pocket monsters imagines what they might look like after being copied by Ditto, the shapeshifting series mainstay that can transform itself into any other Pok\u00e9mon it comes across. This week, one of these cute toys has completely broken the brains of even the most knowledgeable Pok\u00e9mon fans.\n\nThe Pok\u00e9mon Company said this week that it will add five new Ditto-fied plush toys to the line, including one based on the Sun and Moon newcomer Mimikyu. The ghostly fairy quickly found fans within the Pok\u00e9mon community thanks to its adorably depressing backstory: It dons a cheap Pikachu disguise to cash in on the more recognisable Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s popularity. And while the plush is just as cute as one would expect, it\u2019s also raised a lot of questions concerning its accuracy.\n\n\u201cWait, but Mimikyu\u2019s actual eyes are their regular size, so this is a Mimikyu impersonating a Ditto who\u2019s trying to impersonate a Mimikyu impersonating a Pikachu,\u201d Twitter user Yellow Pancake mused in a tweet that has since garnered over 10,000 retweets and 36,000 likes.\n\nSee, Mimikyu has two sets of eyes: The ones up top are part of his Pikachu costume, but his real eyes are under the costume, and he sees through the eyeslits cut out of it on the bottom. Why, then, did the eyes on top of the costume change into Ditto eyes, instead of the ones on the bottom? Indeed, why would the outer costume look different at all? The Pok\u00e9mon is under it. Is this really a Ditto, or just another elaborate charade by a confused Mimikyu?\n\nThings got even more confusing when an image from 2017, which provides several choices for what Ditto would look like as a Mimikyu, resurfaced in a reply to Yellow Pancake. Unfortunately, I haven\u2019t been able to find the original source for this image, but it does present a few compelling options. Would either set of eyes change? Would both?\n\nI\u2019m of the mind that A is the correct choice, since Mimikyu\u2019s real body is hidden beneath the sheet and thus we shouldn\u2019t be able to see the Ditto eyes, but folks have also mentioned B being a possible alternative.\n\nThen one has to wonder about the inherent rules of the eye change from Ditto\u2019s perspective. It\u2019s entirely possible that the transforming Pok\u00e9mon doesn\u2019t quite understand Mimikyu\u2019s anatomy. If a Ditto was fooled by the Pikachu disguise, its eyes would obviously go up top, right? Or perhaps a slightly smarter Ditto would take note of the eye holes on the bottom and go with that. The species hasn\u2019t historically been portrayed as the most intelligent the Pok\u00e9mon world has to offer, so I guess any of these options are possible depending on what any particular Ditto makes of Mimikyu before shapeshifting.\n\nI suppose the existence of an official plush means we have an official answer, but the creators won\u2019t even tell us if people eat Pok\u00e9mon while at the same time encouraging us to literally slurp one down.
