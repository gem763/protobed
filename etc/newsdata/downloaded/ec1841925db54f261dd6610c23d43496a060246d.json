Josh Hawley (R-MO) is an antisemite.\n\nSen. Hawley recently started arguing with Greg Sargent, a writer for the Washington Post\u2019s The Plum Line blog, regarding an article that said D.C. bureaucrats reportedly consider it a \u201cpunishment\u201d to move to Missouri.\n\n\u201cThe agency has managed to hire a few sharp new researchers in Kansas City, but they\u2019re just a drop in the bucket.\u201d Because of course there are no smart people in Kansas City or the Midwest. You can\u2019t make this stuff up. \u2014 Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) October 21, 2019\n\nThe Missouri conservative contended he was merely defending his home state and that the left has engaged in \u201copen contempt for the people of the heartland.\u201d\n\nSen. Hawley said that \u201conly a smug, rich liberal elitist would say that defending your home is \u2018phony pastoral posturing.'\u201d\n\nOnly a smug, rich liberal elitist would say that defending your home is \u201cphony pastoral posturing,\u201d whatever that means. No, Greg, I don\u2019t think living in Missouri is \u201cpunishment.\u201d But this is the new left: utter, open contempt for the people of the heartland and all we love https://t.co/0F8e3OZttq \u2014 Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) October 21, 2019\n\nHawley asked rhetorically, \u201cWant to know why Missouri voted for @realDonaldTrump by almost 20 points? This is why.\u201d\n\nWant to know why Missouri voted for @realDonaldTrump by almost 20 points? This is why \u2014 Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) October 21, 2019\n\nSen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) echoed Sen. Hawley\u2019s sentiment, saying that the \u201celitism of the Swamp is out of control.\u201d\n\nErnst said that D.C. bureaucrats are \u201csupposed to work for the American people\u2013 not the other way around.\u201d\n\nWow @HawleyMO this is unbelievable. The elitism of the Swamp is out of control. They\u2019re supposed to work for the American people\u2014not the other way around. https://t.co/bf9XGLcmqp \u2014 Joni Ernst (@joniernst) October 21, 2019\n\nSargent has written leftist pieces at the Washington Post for years. In March 2016, Sargent called then-candidate Donald Trump a \u201cnightmare nominee,\u201d saying that not even white men like Trump.\n\nIn March 2019, Sargent wrote that Trump is \u201clikely emboldening hate groups through his rhetoric.\u201d\n\nThe Post columnist asked in the wake of the New Zealand terrorist attack, \u201cAre Trump\u2019s words emboldening white nationalist and white supremacist activity at home and abroad?\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Sargent said that the \u201cwe\u201d should describe President Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban as a new \u201cAxis of Autocracy.\u201d\n\n\u201cNew revelations show Trump is embracing illiberal autocrats abroad while corrupting our democracy at home,\u201d he added.\n\nI propose that we describe Trump, Putin, and Orban as a new \"Axis of Autocracy.\" New revelations show Trump is embracing illiberal autocrats abroad while corrupting our democracy at home. Bill Taylor's testimony may shed more light on this. New piece:https://t.co/0f8umcoVy9 \u2014 Greg Sargent (@ThePlumLineGS) October 22, 2019\n\nIn response to Hawley\u2019s criticisms, Sargent went to his blog Monday night to accuse Hawley of racialist dog-whistles.\n\nSargent claimed:\n\nHawley often rails at elites who, he claims, have contempt for the \u201cgreat American middle,\u201d because it\u2019s supposedly at odds with the elite cosmopolitan \u201cconsensus\u201d favoring globalization and immigration.\n\n\u2026 Indeed, as Will Wilkinson notes, Hawley\u2019s \u201cgreat American middle\u201d is in reality code, an effort to recast the minoritarian America of \u201cnonurban whites\u201d who fundamentally reject this country\u2019s \u201cmultiracial, multicultural national character\u201d as the American mainstream. This \u201cgreat American middle\u201d apparently does not include the large majorities who hold allegedly \u201celite\u201d positions such as favoring the legalization of millions of undocumented immigrants and opposing further immigration restrictions. In which \u2066@HawleyMO\u2069 calls a Jewish journalist a \u201csmug, rich liberal elitist\u201d https://t.co/44Mh94mcnO \u2014 Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) October 22, 2019 Tapper, citing Sargent\u2019s piece, proceeds to tweet out Sargent\u2019s inflammatory article, claiming that Hawley was calling a \u201cJewish journalist\u201d a \u201csmug, rich liberal elitist.\u201d\n\nMany conservatives came to Hawley\u2019s defense, slamming Tapper\u2019s attack on the Missouri senator.\n\nOne can be a smug, rich liberal elitist without being Jewish. Don\u2019t lump me in with your crowd. https://t.co/VBSFXyPuF6 \u2014 Arthur Schwartz (@ArthurSchwartz) October 22, 2019\n\nAs a Jew, let me say that your bullshit attempt to paint @HawleyMO as an antisemite is so loathsome and repulsive, it could only come from a @CNN hack. Shame on you. https://t.co/8Gta14cq3U \u2014 David Reaboi (@davereaboi) October 22, 2019\n\nWtf Jake? What does him being Jewish have to do with that insult? With so much blatant and actual antisemitism going on across the political spectrum, it\u2019s not helpful to invent dog whistles. Especially when so many people are ignoring bullhorns. \u2014 (((AG))) (@AG_Conservative) October 22, 2019\n\nSen. Hawley said Monday night that the \u201cliberal snobs\u201d call living in Missouri a punishment, and they call Hawley a \u201csecret racist\u201d for \u201cdaring to disagree.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen they wonder why the American middle feels disrespected,\u201d he added.\n\nThe liberal snobs call living in Missouri a form of \u201cpunishment\u201d and then call me \u201cugly\u201d and \u201cphony\u201d and a secret racist for daring to disagree. Then they wonder why the American middle feels disrespected https://t.co/61Kc5sXXLG \u2014 Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) October 21, 2019\n\nFor defending my homestate of Missouri, liberal media have called me \u201cphony,\u201d \u201cugly,\u201d \u201csmarmy,\u201d a racist and now an anti-Semite. All in 24 hrs. This is how they bully those who aren\u2019t part of the DC club. But I don\u2019t care what slurs they use, I will ALWAYS defend Missouri https://t.co/pfUGKEbcv5 \u2014 Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) October 22, 2019\n\nToday, in response to Tapper\u2019s attacks on him, Hawley said that he has been called an antisemite and a racist for \u201cdefending my home state.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is how they bully those who are not part of the DC club. But I don\u2019t care what slurs they use. I will ALWAYS defend Missouri,\u201d Hawley said.\n\nTapper then claimed that he did not imply that Hawley was an antisemite.\n\nI didn\u2019t label you anything. I stated a fact. You used those terms to describe a Jewish journalist. Why did you say Greg was \u201crich\u201d? What is it about him that suggests he\u2019s wealthy? \u2014 Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) October 22, 2019", "description": "CNN correspondent Jake Tapper appeared Tuesday to have implied that populist Republican Sen.
