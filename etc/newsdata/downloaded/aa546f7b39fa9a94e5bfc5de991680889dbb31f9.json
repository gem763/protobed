California\n\n\u201cF*** you KSI \u2013 and your team,\u201d Paul exclaimed.\n\n\u201cI got f*****. It\u2019s not funny.\n\n\u201cI am not going to be part of the press conference this Saturday. Rumours say that KSI didn\u2019t want me as part of the press conference because it would steal his limelight. F*** you KSI. I cannot wait until we get the opportunity to fight, I\u2019m going to f*** you up.\n\n\u201cKSI has some sort of jealousy issue with me being involved. It doesn\u2019t make sense at all, I\u2019ve been part of the narrative from the start. If you recall, KSI said he\u2019d fight me or Logan.\n\n\u201cLogan and I came to the agreement he would fight KSI first and I\u2019d fight his younger brother, Deji. I TKO\u2019d Deji and was the only person to win a fight that night [of the co and main event]. For KSI and his management team to exclude me from the event doesn\u2019t make any sense.\n\n\u201cThe problem we have now is Eddie Hearn is in charge of this whole event and Eddie doesn\u2019t want this event to come across as a joke in the industry because he\u2019s already getting some backlash.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s using KSI vs Logan as marketing for his professional boxers and the ultimate goal here, even for me, is to get more eyes for the sport. I\u2019m taking it serious as f***, I even turned into a pro boxer for this event. I don\u2019t want any bull**** YouTube fights.\u201d\n\nA number of possible fights have been touted for Paul\u2019s potential appearance on the card, with the 22-year-old having the likes of Yousef Erakat (fouseyTUBE) and rapper Soulja Boy both challenging him.\n\nIf Hearn does allow Paul to fight on the card, if not already a professional the potential opponent would have to apply to be one.\n\n\u201cThe last fight, when I fought, Deji and I had more concurrent viewers on the stream than when Logan and KSI fought. That\u2019s a fact. The numbers speak for themselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve trained just as hard as Logan and definitely harder than KSI and that\u2019s why I think it makes sense for me to be part of this narrative.\n\n\u201cI will be an additive to help you creating one of the biggest fights ever. I have a different demographic to KSI and Logan, their fight is older and more mature. I come from Disney, I have the families, the younger kids. Which is why on my last fight I had more concurrent viewers than theirs.\n\n\u201cI know you\u2019ll be in town with Logan meeting him, I think we should talk. I invite you to see me spar, I think I have a better skillset than my brother, he has more power, more weight but I am a better technical fighter.\n\n\u201cKSI fought a guy called Joe Weller, he finished him in three minutes, it took me two rounds.\u201d\n\nHearn has since viewed the six-minute clip, and sent a message back to Paul: \u201cGood video \u2013 let\u2019s talk!\u201d", "description": "Jake Paul has sent a message to Eddie Hearn demanding to be on the undercard of KSI vs Logan Paul.
