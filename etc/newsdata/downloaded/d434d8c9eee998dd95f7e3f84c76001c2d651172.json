A less-redacted version, where only grand jury information was blacked out, was then given to certain lawmakers, including the committee's chairman and ranking member.\n\nThe committee asserted its need of the full, unredacted version of Mueller's report as well as transcripts of the grand jury testimony, and filed a lawsuit under Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., in July. The Justice Department argued the blacked-out information in the report comprised a \"tiny percentage of the document,\" and that the committee hadn't provided a sufficient explanation as to how the material would help their investigation of Trump.\n\nThe DOJ also argued an impeachment proceeding carried out in Congress wouldn't be considered a \"judicial proceeding\" under law, in which case the information could have been disclosed.\n\nThe department went on to argue that several investigations stemming from Mueller's probe remained open, thus there is a \"continuing need for secrecy\" about grand jury proceedings.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIt's not clear what new information the committee is seeking in the grand jury transcripts.
