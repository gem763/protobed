Police had been called to the shooter\u2019s home 45 times to deal with incidents involving him or his brother.\n\nPollack and Eden identify the shooter throughout by his prison number, 18-1958. 18-1958 had been in a fight in school, repeatedly issued death threats to other students, and was prohibited from bringing a backpack to school so as not to be able to conceal weapons in it.\n\n>>>School Safety Initiative\n\nYet as Pollack notes, when the shooter bought his guns, \u201che had a totally clean record. On paper, he was a model citizen.\u201d\n\nHow did his record stay so clean?\n\nPollack and Eden meticulously document that district and school officials did not stop 18-1958 because of the district\u2019s policy to limit student suspensions and expulsions. That policy\u2014the PROMISE Program\u2014also deterred educators from referring students to police.\n\nSuch leniency, Eden argues, meant that officials neglected opportunities to refer 18-1958 to law enforcement, allowing him to avoid arrest, which ultimately made it possible for him to buy a gun.\n\n>>>Same Policies That Failed to Stop Florida Shooter Exist in School Districts Nationwide\n\nWhile the media at large focused on lack of \u201cgun control\u201d as the major problem, Pollack and Eden explain that PROMISE and the related rules on student discipline\u2014which the Obama administration had then promulgated in school districts across the country\u2014are undeniably at the center of this tragedy.\n\nThe PROMISE Program \u201cdeters teachers from reporting disciplinary problems and makes administrators less inclined to trust teachers\u2019 intuition and more inclined to make decisions that produce the disciplinary \u2018data\u2019 that their district-level superiors want to see,\u201d Pollack and Eden write.\n\nAt every possible turn, the adults in the system ignored glaring warning signs. Pollack and Eden write that 18-1958\u2019s story is \u201ca cautionary tale of what can happen when everyone in a school system has an incentive to do the wrong thing.\u201d\n\nPollack and Eden\u2019s book is difficult to read because Pollack\u2019s pain, sorrow, and frustration is present on nearly every page. Furthermore, the detailed recounting of the tragedy pulls no punches in identifying the policies that allowed this disaster to happen.\n\n\u201cEvery step of the way, [district officials] had a choice: do the responsible thing and help [18-1958], or do the politically correct thing and ignore him. They made the wrong choice every single time,\u201d Pollack writes in one section.\n\n>>>1 Year After Parkland Massacre, Broward County\u2019s School Board Still Failing\n\nThe most troubling part of the book, aside from the actual retelling of the shooting, is the ending.\n\nAfter an exhausting effort to change the composition of the Broward County School Board failed in 2018, the authors express fear that voter apathy is so deeply-rooted that even a disaster like Parkland is not enough to get people interested in local elections.\n\nIn his epilogue, Pollack pleads with readers: \u201cYou simply have to step up, get involved, and make a difference for your children. You can\u2019t let your schools be run like the Broward County Public School District.\u201d\n\nReaders will be left shaking their heads at the district\u2019s systemic failures, administrators\u2019 abdication of responsibility, and the abundance of adult negligence.\n\nEvery school leader should read this book and safeguard against such a lax disciplinary environment being replicated in their districts\u2014and every parent should read it to hold school officials accountable. Children\u2019s lives depend on it.", "description": "\u201cThis incident that occurred, this outrageous tragedy that we have had to deal with, we really had no signs, no warning, no tips,\u201d announced Broward County School Superintendent Robert Runcie on CNN on Feb. 15, 2018.\n\nRuncie was speaking of the tragic school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that had left 17 students and staff dead the day before.\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo signs, no warning.\u201d Well, that\u2019s simply not true.", "authors": ["Lindsey Burke", "Commentary By", "Director", "Center For Education Policy", "Senior Policy Analyst"], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_optimized/public/images/2019-09/GettyImages-924929238.jpg?itok=uBJaXfD_", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
