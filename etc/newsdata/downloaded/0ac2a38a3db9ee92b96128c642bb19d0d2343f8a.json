That way, when they boot President Trump from office, they will have voters on their side. And Vice President Mike Pence won\u2019t be left sitting in the Oval Office.\n\nAnyway, they are presently running a hotly partisan and absurdly secret witch hunt that will only pants themselves in the U.S. Senate. (Spoiler Alert: Republicans control the U.S. Senate, where the Democrats\u2019 hotly partisan and absurdly secret witch hunt will be dead on arrival.)\n\nSo, what is this all about? It is a cover-up, plain and simple.\n\nWhom, you ask, are they trying to cover for? Their next political savior who can take down Mr. Trump?\n\nCertainly not former Vice President Joseph R. Biden. If anything, Mr. Biden has been set ablaze atop the altar as a sacrifice in this massive international cover-up by Democrats.\n\nThe sleaze and dishonesty and self-dealing that oozes from the Biden name these days will leave a permanent stain on his nearly half-century political career.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Hunter \u201cThe Leech\u201d Biden, when asked whether he could have gotten a job making $50,000 a month from a Ukrainian gas company if his last name hadn\u2019t been \u201cBiden\u201d at a time when his daddy was vice president of the United States.\n\n\u201cProbably not, in retrospect,\u201d The Leech allowed. \u201cBut that\u2019s \u2014 you know \u2014 I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s been a lot of things that would have happened in my life if my last name wasn\u2019t Biden.\u201d\n\nGame. Set. Match.\n\nThat is all anybody needs to know about the Biden family and whether they were open for bribery in Ukraine or China or anywhere else in the world.\n\nThe key to understanding House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s coup conspiracy against the president has nothing to do with Mr. Trump\u2019s phone call with the president of Ukraine. Instead, it has everything to do with all the fake Russia nonsense they have been barking about for the past three years \u2014 but are suddenly very quiet about today.\n\nWhen was the last time you heard any major Democratic persecutor in Congress utter the word \u201cRussia\u201d?\n\nAs Sherlock Holmes would say, it is the dog that DIDN\u2019T bark. Which brings us to the \u201cwhom\u201d that Democrats are sacrificing all in an effort to protect: former President Barack Obama.\n\nCurrently, there are a handful of very, very serious probes by nonpartisan prosecutors bound by rules of fairness and due process looking into the origins of the Obama administration\u2019s spying operation on the campaign of a political opponent at the height of the 2016 election season.\n\nThis is and always has been the most gravely serious matter in the whole fake Russia \u201ccollusion\u201d saga. People go to jail for doing things like this in America. And it\u2019s not just former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper or ex-CIA Director John Brennan and dirty FBI agents like Peter Strzok who face devastating consequences if it can be proved they used their massive government powers in an effort to destroy a political opponent.\n\nIt could reach deep into the White House. It could reach the top.\n\nThis is why Mrs. Pelosi has dropped Russia and collusion and stopped talking about the Mueller report or all the fantasies laid out in the \u201cdirty dossier\u201d that Democrats paid foreign agents to dig up on Mr. Trump from Russian sources.\n\nIt is also why Mrs. Pelosi refuses to run the current impeachment \u201cinquiry\u201d with even a hint of due process or fairness. If the minority \u2014 or the executive branch \u2014 were afforded the fairness that attended past impeachments, Republicans would gain subpoena powers to call witnesses.\n\nDo you think Republicans might like to question Mr. Brennan or Mr. Clapper under oath about who authorized espionage against political opponents during the height of a presidential campaign?\n\nOf course they would. But Mrs. Pelosi will never let them get that close to Mr. Obama.\n\nSo \u2026 Ukraine! Joe Biden be damned.\n\n\u2981 Contact Charles Hurt at [email protected] or on Twitter @charleshurt.\n\nSign up for Charles Hurt's Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
