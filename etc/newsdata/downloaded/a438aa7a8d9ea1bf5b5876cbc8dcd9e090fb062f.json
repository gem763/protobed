The bonus, which came due this past Monday, is owed to Brown despite the fact that he was cut by the team a week ago. Brown has been embroiled in a number of legal issues, including allegations last week that he sent threatening text messages to one of the women who has accused him of rape. It is just one of a handful of issues that Brown is currently facing.\n\nChris Broussard and Rob Parker, hosts of the nationally syndicated \"The Odd Couple\" show on FOX Sports Radio, had a heated discussion about whether Brown will get the bonus money owed to him. Per Brown\u2019s contract, there is another $4 million in bonus money owed him at season\u2019s end.\n\n\u201cThe Patriots, no surprise, didn\u2019t pay him the $5 million, they\u2019re going to try not to pay him the $9 million,\u201d Broussard said on Wednesday\u2019s show. \u201cAnd he\u2019s obviously going to try and fight to get it which I don\u2019t blame either side. If I were the Patriots ... I wouldn\u2019t be paying him either.\u201d\n\nParker quickly jumped in, barely letting Broussard finish.\n\n\u201cNo. he\u2019s going to get money. I guarantee you he\u2019ll get money,\u201d Parker said, adding that he would wager 10 chicken wings on the debate. His partner declined to make the bet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBroussard pointed out the existence of not just the text messages but also the threat of a civil lawsuit from personal trainer Britney Taylor, who is alleging that the NFL star raped her. He made the point that this might be enough for the Patriots to squeak out of paying Brown his owed bonus.\n\nBrown, signed after the Oakland Raiders released him prior to the start of Week 1, played in one game for the Patriots. Parker said the fact that Brown played for New England after they learned about the civil lawsuit helps his claim for the bonus.\n\nThe legal wrangling, Parker said, doesn\u2019t matter because it is a civil suit and he wasn\u2019t suspended by the commissioner while he was under contract in New England.\n\n\u201cBecause if the Patriots cared so much about it, they could have released him the minute it came out and said that they didn\u2019t want him. They released him on the second charge,\u201d Parker said.\n\n\u201cThey played this guy. You can\u2019t use that as judgment now to say I\u2019m not going to pay you. Why did you play him if that\u2019s the problem?\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nFox Corp. is the parent company of FOX Business and Fox Sports.", "description": "Antonio Brown might be set for another legal battle but in this one, he is looking to get money potentially owed him.", "authors": ["Kristian Dyer"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/antonio-brown-AP-2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
