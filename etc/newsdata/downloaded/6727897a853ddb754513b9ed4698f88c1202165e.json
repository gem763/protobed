That\u2019s regrettable. Former Democratic Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, his real name is Robert Francis, went nuclear on the gun control issue. He wants to outright confiscate firearms, specifically so-called assault weapons. Why? Well, to liberals, they\u2019re scary looking. That\u2019s about it. He wants to confiscate the private property of law-abiding Americans. It\u2019s illegal. It\u2019s not going to happen at a federal level anytime soon because a) Bob isn\u2019t going to be president let alone the 2020 Democratic nominee, and b) it\u2019s a losing issue. What can happen though are anti-gun policies that are just as shoddy being enacted at the state level, which is where anti-gunners have been concentrating their efforts and its yielding results.\n\nIn Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers is mulling a mandatory buyback of AR-15s in the state, which is confiscation. It\u2019s what Australia did. If people didn\u2019t turn over their guns, they were slapped with legal charges (via ABC 27 WKOW):\n\nWisconsin Gov. Tony Evers says he would consider mandatory buybacks for assault weapons. Democratic presidential candidate and former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke has been pushing for mandatory buybacks on the campaign trail. Republicans have balked at the idea. Asked if he supports mandatory buybacks during a news conference Thursday to introduce a red flag bill, Evers said he would consider the idea. He didn\u2019t elaborate, saying he was focused on trying to get the red flag bill and a universal background check bill that Democrats introduced last month passed. The measures come in the wake of mass shootings in Texas and Ohio. The proposals have virtually no chance of passing the Republican-controlled Legislature. The Wisconsin GOP has said restricting gun access won\u2019t stop mass shootings and attention should instead focus on mental health.\n\nThe good news is that the Wisconsin legislature is Republican, so that should mean that this proposal is dead in the water. As for the red flag law and expanded background check push in Madison that should also be DOA as well, though you\u2019ll never know about the squishy GOP sect that we have who thinks neither of these proposals would be abused by the Left to confiscate guns and lay down the foundation for a gun registry in the future\u2014the latter of which would also be used to take away people\u2019s guns.", "description": ".09/21/2019 20:24:36PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2017/311/18016275-789f-4124-8e8e-07ab3bdf0bd5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
