Motsi added: \u201cOur parents made a lot of sacrifices because dancing is not the cheapest sport.\n\n\u201cThe dresses are expensive, so my mum learned to sew, and she started a catering company to pay for the lessons and the travel abroad for competitions.\u201d\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nMotsi, who has a one-year-old daughter with Ukrainian dancer husband Evgenij Voznyuk, was born in Kraalhoek, \u00adNorth West Province, in 1981. The area was known as Bophuthatswana under apartheid.\n\nShe moved with Oti, Dudu and dad Peter, a lawyer, to the township of Mabopane near the capital Pretoria two years later.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nDespite their relative privilege, signs of racial tension were everywhere. Motsi and Oti found dancing a way to escape the reality.\n\nShe has said: \u201cI\u2019m so thankful for dance because if I had grown up with just the bitterness of the very hard childhood we had, and I\u2019d never \u00adexperienced the love of the dance world, then I probably would have been a very sad person.\u201d\n\n(Image: BBC/Guy Levy)\n\nAnd she opened up about being raised surrounded by unrest in her autobiography, Chili In The Blood. Motsi said: \u201cWe always knew when riots had broken out because we weren\u2019t allowed to leave the house, even to go to school. Then the next day, I could see it was still burning everywhere.\u201d\n\nAnd she still had to deal with race issues on Strictly, since taking over from Darcey Bussell on the panel \u00adalongside Shirley Ballas, Craig Revel Horwood and Bruno Tonioli. Motsi, who worked on German TV show Let\u2019s Dance, reportedly had to increase her security after being targeted by white supremacists who bombard her with racial abuse.\n\nAnd dancer Louie Spence branded her appointment a \u201cbox-ticking exercise\u201d.\n\nBut she hit back: \u201cYou\u2019ll always have someone attacking you in some way. But it\u2019s weird from someone who\u2019s never met you. But there is already a woman of colour in this show, Oti.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: The Strictly judge revealed the bitter apartheid system nearly wrecked her and sister Oti\u2019s dreams of performing", "authors": ["Kelly Allen", "Olivia Buxton", "Image", "Getty Images", "Instagram", "Bbc Guy Levy"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20725403.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Lets-Dance-Competition.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
