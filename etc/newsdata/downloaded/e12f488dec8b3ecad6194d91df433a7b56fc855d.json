In large part that has played out. One exception has been that across the first four Tests, Australia fielded three excellent fast bowlers to England\u2019s two. The other exception, which creates rather a large skew, has been Steve Smith producing one of the most dominant sequences of batting ever recorded.\n\nAustralia\u2019s fast bowlers have mixed and matched around a core of Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood, giving England\u2019s batsmen no break at all. England have had Stuart Broad in vintage form and Jofra Archer bringing a whole new energy but Chris Woakes has been marginalised and modestly effective, and his temporary replacement Craig Overton offered more with bat than ball.\n\nJofra Archer says flu-ridden Steve Smith \u2018didn\u2019t look as nailed on as usual\u2019 Read more\n\nBoth attacks have been refreshed with all-rounders in the final Test, with Mitchell Marsh taking his first Test five-for, mostly on the first day, before Sam Curran grabbed an important three wickets for England on the second.\n\nBut still in Smith-free circumstances England\u2019s line-leaders on their own might have been enough. Broad has so utterly toasted David Warner that the Australian opener came out at the Oval going wild against Archer, swinging and missing at balls so wide they barely landed on the cut strip. The last time Warner played like this he smoked 30 from 13 balls in Cape Town before losing his stumps, one day before he got busted sandpapering the match ball. Let us just say it does not betray a serene state of mind.\n\nWarner has been out in single figures eight times out of nine. Two other openers have failed apace. Usman Khawaja, who could have opened, had already been dropped from No 3. Travis Head at No 5 was punted while Matthew Wade bashed one declaration hundred but has not looked reliable at the crease. Tim Paine has produced one defiant innings from No 7 but needed more.\n\nHad No 4 been filled by a batsman of similar calibre, Australia might have come to the Oval trailing 4-0. Instead the visitors have had Smith, meaning the fifth Test panned out like the fourth, and the second, and the first. He came to the crease at two down for bugger-all, batted through the departures of his colleagues, then did what he could with the tail.\n\nHis 80 was his lowest score for the series in six attempts. What has stood out most about this absurdly prolific run is how the atmosphere of an innings has changed every time he has walked in.\n\nThe Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\n\nWhen a team takes an early wicket, spirits are high. You are up, they are down. Celebrations erupt. A second wicket should be even better. Yet since his hundred on the first day of the series, a sense of foreboding seems to spread through the ground when a second wicket falls. In comes Smith and out go hopes of taking a third.\n\nMost notable is the way that Smith has neutralised England\u2019s best. Broad has moved the ball viciously from around the wicket to Australia\u2019s left-handers, taking edges on one side of the bat, pads and stumps on the other. As soon as Smith has arrived, Broad suddenly appears to shrink back into being a modest right-arm trundler.\n\nWith Smith\u2019s movement outside his off stump, any lateral movement Broad can find is negated. Smith is happy to treat the bowler with respect much of the time, defending in between knocking a run or two to square-leg, but the boundaries he carved through cover at the Oval had more than a hint of dismissiveness.\n\nArcher was in with a chance early in the innings, drawing a couple of indiscreet pushes. But while England supporters seem to think the Archer bouncer is a secret weapon, Smith has calmly got underneath it ever since he was hit on an uneven pitch at Lord\u2019s. No one in the world is less impressed by the delivery.\n\nSoon enough, runs came from Archer as easily. When wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow burst out laughing after fooling Smith into a dive while taking a run, Smith immediately played a leg-side flick from Archer so pure that no one moved before it hit the fence. Don\u2019t mess with me, it seemed to say.\n\nIn the end perhaps even Smith was tired after a long series, missing a ball from Woakes that hit his pad directly in front. England would have seen it as a victory to get him for only 80. Australia were rolled over 69 runs behind, Archer taking six wickets. But again the contributions around Smith were barely there. Without him that deficit alone would have been match-losing. For now Australia remain in the game. What a series England\u2019s bowlers might have given their team had it not been for the batting of one man.", "description": "Steve Smith, Australia\u2019s awesome No 4, has been producing in the Ashes series in England one of the most dominant sequences of batting ever recorded", "authors": ["Geoff Lemon"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/176d15aff02944d4d9cf24405846e2de2fe44e37/427_1147_4169_2501/master/4169.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4715b210d726a48890e2f7879380ad3f", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
