He can\u2019t acknowledge error even in small matters; he surely wasn\u2019t about to cop to a major blunder which even cronies like Lindsey Graham were claiming would lead to the rebirth of ISIS. He\u2019d lunge at any spin available to him that might conceivably justify his decision, even if it came from Turkish fascists.\n\nBut I thought he\u2019d limit himself to Turkish claims about how the invasion was going \u2014 few Kurdish casualties, no civilians hurt, no ISIS prisoners escaped, and so on. Never did I expect him to adopt Erdogan\u2019s own view of who the real threat in Syria is.\n\nSomehow this is going to end with Trump bombing the Kurds at Turkey\u2019s behest, isn\u2019t it?\n\nWhat US President Trump says about PKK terror grouppic.twitter.com/FX9jjtq3mj \u2014 TRT World Now (@TRTWorldNow) October 16, 2019\n\nTRT is a Turkish media outlet, which is no coincidence. Only a Turk would make the claim that the PKK is more of a terrorist menace than ISIS is. For an American to make it, particularly a president whose view of foreign policy is \u201cAmerica First,\u201d is the purest insanity, to the point where I\u2019d be surprised if a single person in the United States\u2019s vast intelligence bureaucracy agrees. In no sphere of reality is the PKK a bigger threat *to America* than ISIS is; to an America First-er, that should settle the question of which outfit is \u201cworse.\u201d I\u2019d bet cash money that Trump got this ridiculous talking point directly from Erdogan himself in conversation and chose to stupidly repeat it because, as I say, he\u2019ll grasp at anything to justify his stand-down order in northern Syria retroactively. \u201cThe PKK is worse than ISIS. So, by letting Turkey massacre the Kurds, we\u2019re actually fighting terrorism.\u201d\n\nAs I\u2019m writing this, news is breaking that the House has voted to condemn Trump\u2019s Syria withdrawal \u2014 on a strongly bipartisan vote, 354-60.\n\nThe resolution states Congress\u2019 opposition to the troop pullback and says Turkey should cease its military action in Syria. And the measure says the White House should present a plan for an \u201cenduring defeat\u201d of the Islamic State group\u2026 The House debate was extraordinary for the intensity of lawmakers\u2019 opinions. Republicans called the troop withdrawal \u201cdisastrous\u201d and a \u201ccatastrophe.\u201d Democrats criticized Trump directly, with Rep. Seth Moulton saying Trump \u201chas taken the side of dictators and butchers.\u201d\n\nMitch McConnell also went out of his way to express his \u201cgratitude\u201d to the same Kurds who are, allegedly, worse than ISIS. Meanwhile, America\u2019s diplomatic apparatus is busytrying to pressure Erdogan to back off in Syria, raising the question again of who, exactly, they think they work for:\n\nThe United States calls on #Turkey to halt its military offensive in Syria. Turkey is undermining the campaign to defeat ISIS, endangering innocent civilians and threatening peace, security and stability. Those responsible for #HumanRights abuses must be held accountable. #UNSC pic.twitter.com/Hc4mAcV7jn \u2014 U.S. Mission to the UN (@USUN) October 16, 2019\n\nTrump couldn\u2019t have been clearer in the Oval Office this afternoon that he doesn\u2019t care who ends up fighting in Syria \u2014 Turkey, the Kurds, Assad, Russia, the more the merrier. Per his point about the PKK and ISIS, one can only conclude at this point that he\u2019s *rooting* for Erdogan to wipe out the Kurds. What is he sending Pence and Pompeo to Turkey tonight to negotiate, then? Whether the Turks want U.S. air support as they push further into Kurdish territory?\n\nWe\u2019re not quite at that point yet. Instead the WSJ is reporting that the U.S. has started bombing its own anti-ISIS facilities in Syria as a consequence of Trump\u2019s accession to Erdogan:\n\nOn Wednesday, the U.S, military carried out airstrikes to destroy the Syrian headquarters of the American campaign to destroy Islamic State after rapidly pulling Americans from the base, current and former U.S. officials said. The decision to destroy the base, which included warehouses used to train-and-equip the Kurdish-led fighters, came after Turkish-backed forces moved on the facility on Tuesday. As the Turkish-backed forced closed in, the U.S. used Apache helicopters and F-15 jet fighters to intimidate the fighters and deter them from getting closer to the base where Americans were still stationed, U.S. officials said.\n\nHere\u2019s Lindsey Graham this afternoon sounding unhappy, which doesn\u2019t matter to anyone, least of all Trump. Graham will compartmentalize this just like all of his other Trump foreign-policy disappointments, certainly until he\u2019s reelected next fall.\n\nSen. @LindseyGrahamSC: \"This is the most screwed up decision I've seen since I have been in Congress.\" Full video here: https://t.co/r8iilPZ6cE pic.twitter.com/h0QIJz7f99 \u2014 CSPAN (@cspan) October 16, 2019\n\nUpdate: Here\u2019s a letter that Trump sent Erdogan and it is, ah, really something. The important thing is the date, though \u2014 October 9, one week ago. A week later, Trump is now spouting Turkish propaganda and shrugging at the prospect of a prolonged war between the major players in northern Syria. I guess we know how the phone call he mentions in the letter went.", "description": "What?", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/t-16.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
