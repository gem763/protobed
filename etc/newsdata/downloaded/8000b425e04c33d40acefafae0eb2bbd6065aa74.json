Here's everything we know about the candidate and how he stacks up against the competition.", "language": "en", "text": "South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Mary Schwalm/AP Images\n\nWho is Pete Buttigieg?\n\nCurrent job: Mayor of South Bend, Indiana. Running for president of the United States as a Democratic candidate.\n\nAge: 37\n\nFamily: Buttigieg is married to junior high school teacher Chasten Glezman Buttigieg.\n\nHometown: South Bend, Indiana.\n\nPolitical party: Democratic\n\nPrevious jobs: Consultant for McKinsey & Company from 2007-2010, US Navy Reserve officer from 2009 to 2017, seven-month tour as a counterintelligence officer in Afghanistan.\n\nWho is Buttigieg's direct competition for the nomination?\n\nBased on a recurring series of national surveys we conduct, we can figure out who the other candidates competing in Pete Buttigieg's lane are, and who the broader opponents are within the party.\n\nThe average Buttigieg-satisfied respondent said they were satisfied with 5 other candidates , which is okay: it means that people who like him tend to be considering just a few other choices. To stay competitive, he'll want to be in line with the top candidates in the race, for whom that number is less than 4. Just 3 percent of his supporters liked him and him alone.\n\n, which is okay: it means that people who like him tend to be considering just a few other choices. To stay competitive, he'll want to be in line with the top candidates in the race, for whom that number is less than 4. Just 3 percent of his supporters liked him and him alone. Buttigieg had a great spring. He went from rock-bottom name recognition among likely Democratic primary voters to the low thirties. Joe Biden, the current frontrunner, is also popular among those who'd be satisfied with Buttigieg, but that's more about Biden's popularity than Buttigieg's constituency.\n\nThose satisfied with Buttigieg as nominee tended to be satisfied with lots of different candidates , if a little cool on Sen. Bernie Sanders. More than 60 percent of those satisfied with the South Bend mayor also would be satisfied with Sen. Kamala Harris.\n\n, if a little cool on Sen. Bernie Sanders. More than 60 percent of those satisfied with the South Bend mayor also would be satisfied with Sen. Kamala Harris. Most significantly, three in five of Buttigieg backers would also be satisfied with Elizabeth Warren, a double-digit percentage point bump above her performance among general Democrats.\n\nINSIDER has been conducting a recurring poll through SurveyMonkey Audience on a national sample to find out how different candidate's constituencies overlap. We ask people whether they are familiar with a candidate, whether they would be satisfied or unsatisfied with that candidate as nominee, and sometimes we also ask whether they think that person would win or lose in a general election against President Donald Trump.\n\nRead more about how we're polling this here.\n\nWhat are Pete Buttigieg's policy positions?\n\nWhat are Pete Buttigieg's policy successes?\n\nButtigieg implemented \"Smart Streets\" in South Bend, which involved converting one-way streets to two-way, adding bike lanes, and building new sidewalks in an effort to revitalize the city's downtown.\n\nOversaw a $50 million investment in South Bend's parks and riverfront.\n\nHow much money has Pete Buttigieg raised?\n\nButtigieg's campaign reported that it raised about $600,000 from 22,000 donors in just over 24 hours following the candidate's March CNN town hall. Buttigieg announced in mid-March that he reached the 65,000 donor threshold to participate in the first Democratic primary debate.\n\nButtigieg's campaign raised over $7 million from nearly 160,000 donors in the first quarter of 2019, and $24.8 million from 294,000 donors in the second quarter \u2014 more than any other 2020 candidate.\n\nHow is Pete Buttigieg viewed by voters compared to the competition?\n\nINSIDER has conducted a number of other polls to check in on how these candidates are perceived in comparison to one another. When we asked respondents to one poll to rank how far to the left or to the right they considered the candidates, Buttigieg was generally considered to be one the most centrist candidates in the field. Given his lack of national platform it's unsurprising to see he was viewed as is among the least experienced candidates int the field by far when we asked respondents to rank the candidates based on how prepared they are for the rigors of the presidency given what they knew about their history of public service and experience with government. However, when asked how likable or personable respondents perceived the candidates to be, Buttigieg came in second place behind only Joe Biden.\n\nCould Pete Buttigieg beat President Trump?\n\nReferring back to INSIDER's recurring poll, Buttigieg overall is a more obscure candidate than many of his peers, and those who do know of him are unsure if he'd beat Trump. Lucky for pete, he's on-par with other Democrats when it comes to the perception of electability, which is really something for the mayor of a small midwestern college down.\n\nHow do Democratic voters feel about Pete Buttigieg's qualifications?\n\nINSIDER has conducted polling about how voters feel about candidate attributes or qualifications. We asked respondents about a list of possible qualifications and if they made them more likely or less likely to vote for a candidate for president.\n\nFor example, among respondents who said they'd vote in the Democratic primary, 19% said a candidate being a college professor made them likelier to support them, while 4% said it made them less likely to, for a +15% net favorability. We can then see how different candidates' resumes stack up compared to those preferences.\n\nAttributes perceived as most valuable include his released tax returns (+43%), him being multi-lingual (+25%), age 50 or younger (+23%), a child of immigrants (+21%), armed forces veteran (+17%), mayor (+15%), Rhodes scholar (+12%) and his Ivy league education (+7%).\n\nAttributes considered to be a liability based on the preferences of self-reported Democratic voters include his past as a management consultant (-18%), that he has spent little time in government (-22%) and that he grew up wealthy (-42%).\n\nRead more of our best stories on Pete Buttigieg:", "description": "South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg is a 37-year-old Harvard-educated Rhodes scholar and Afghanistan War veteran running for president.", "authors": ["Eliza Relman"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d7b03eb2e22af131f761ba5?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
