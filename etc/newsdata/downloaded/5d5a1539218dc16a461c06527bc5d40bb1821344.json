The abrupt change happened on Sunday, after a call between Donald Trump and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. Kurdish-led forces said on Monday morning that their US partners had already begun withdrawing troops from the Turkish border area.\n\nRegional tensions. Without the US providing a buffer between Turkish forces and the Kurds, existing tensions between the two longtime rivals in the complex regional conflict are likely to rise.\n\nFlailing Trump losing control of impeachment narrative\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A second whistleblower has come forward in the Trump-Ukraine scandal. Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP\n\nAn increasingly erratic Trump is battling the building threat of impeachment, after a second whistleblower came forward to describe the president\u2019s scheme to leverage dirt on his political rival, Joe Biden, from the Ukrainian leadership. Two prominent Republican senators, Mitt Romney and Susan Collins, have broken ranks to criticise Trump\u2019s behaviour, while his GOP defenders largely fell silent over the weekend.\n\nGordon Sondland. On Tuesday, Congress will hear testimony from the wealthy hotelier and major Trump donor who was made US ambassador to the European Union, and who is now implicated in the Ukraine scandal.\n\nPhilippines president says he has autoimmune disease\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rodrigo Duterte on official visit to Russia last week. Photograph: Yuri Kadobnov/POOL/EPA\n\nRodrigo Duterte, the controversial president of the Philippines, has revealed he is suffering from the autoimmune disease myasthenia gravis, a condition that could cause serious health complications for the 74-year-old leader. Duterte\u2019s health has been subject to speculation ever since he became the country\u2019s oldest elected leader in 2016. \u201cOne of my eyes is smaller. It roams on its own,\u201d he said during a visit to Russia this weekend. \u201cThat\u2019s myasthenia gravis. It\u2019s a nerve malfunction. I got it from my grandfather.\u201d\n\nPrison deaths. A Filipino prison hospital chief has claimed that 20% of the inmates at the national Bilibid prison near Manila, a total of more than 5,000, die each year due to infectious diseases and prison violence.\n\nDrummer Ginger Baker, master and monster, dies at 80\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Baker onstage in London in 1975. Photograph: Colin Fuller/Redferns\n\nGinger Baker, the drummer whose private life was as turbulent as the sound he pioneered, has died aged 80. A jazz-trained drummer, his work with the band Cream helped build the foundations of modern rock, while he was also one of the first western musicians to embrace Afrobeat, establishing his own recording studio in Lagos, Nigeria. Yet Baker\u2019s relationships with his family were strained, and even his close friend and former bandmate Eric Clapton described him as \u201cscary, threatening\u201d and \u201cdifficult\u201d.\n\nMusical tributes. Among those who paid tribute to Baker after his death at the weekend were the two surviving Beatles, Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys and Sir Mick Jagger, who called Baker \u201cfiery but extremely talented and innovative\u201d.\n\nCheat sheet\n\nThe French president, Emmanuel Macron, has given his UK counterpart Boris Johnson until the end of this week to come up with a revised Brexit plan, while in an interview the American businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri has refused to rule out claims that she and Johnson had an affair.\n\nA 24-year-old man has been arrested and charged with the murder of four homeless men, who were bludgeoned to death with a metal pipe as they slept on the streets of New York.\n\nThe 95-year-old former US president Jimmy Carter suffered a black eye and 14 stitches after a fall at his home in Georgia on Sunday, but still made it to a charity concert that evening.\n\nThe consumer goods giant Unilever, which owns more than 400 household brands, has pledged to halve the amount of new plastics it uses per year \u2013 currently 700,000 tonnes \u2013 by 2025.\n\nMust-reads\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Steve Coogan as Sir Richard \u2018Greedy\u2019 McCready in Michael Winterbottom\u2019s Greed. Photograph: Sony Pictures\n\nHow Sony censored Michael Winterbottom\u2019s Greed\n\nThe prolific British film-maker Michael Winterbottom\u2019s new movie, Greed, is a satire of the fashion industry, starring Steve Coogan as a fictional tycoon in the mould of Sir Philip Green. But when Winterbottom wanted to add some real and shocking facts to the end credits, the studio pushed back, as he tells Catherine Shoard.\n\nWhich way will Obama-Trump voters swing in 2020?\n\nFor the first in the Guardian\u2019s new series about swing voters, Chris McGreal travels to white, working-class Monroe County, Michigan, to find out whether the former Obama voters who swung behind Trump in 2016 intend to stay loyal to the president in 2020.\n\nAnd the winners are \u2026\n\nFor some they are the pinnacle of recognition, for others they reek of western bias and sexism. Ian Sample and Hannah Devlin examine the history of the Nobel prizes and how they may change in future. Early on Monday morning the Nobel prize for medicine was split three ways between researchers who have delved into how cells sense oxygen availability and adapt in response to that.\n\nLife as a Latino in Trump\u2019s America\n\nHate crimes have risen steadily since Trump\u2019s election in 2016, but the mass shootings in Gilroy, California, and El Paso, Texas, in August marked a shocking escalation in violence against Latinos \u2013 one that left families across the US living in fear, as Dani Anguiano discovers.\n\nOpinion\n\nA recent New York Times report found Americans are not nearly so polarised as they appear on Twitter, Fox News or MSNBC. John Harris finds the same is true of Brexit Britain, where towns such as Milton Keynes show few symptoms of the culture war.\n\nWe are in danger of making the classic postmodern mistake of taking spectacle and skewed representation for reality.\n\nSport\n\nThe Miami Dolphins have already suffered a string of embarrassing losses in this young season. And yet, writes Melissa Jacobs, they\u2019re not the most dismal team in the NFL. Unlike the Jets, Washington, Bengals and Falcons, at least the Dolphins have a plan for the future.\n\nSeveral Premier League giants struggled this weekend, with Manchester City, United and Tottenham all going down to theoretically weaker teams. Liverpool were disappointing, too, but managed to scrape out a win against Leicester that puts them eight points clear at the top.\n\nSign up\n\nThe US morning briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.
