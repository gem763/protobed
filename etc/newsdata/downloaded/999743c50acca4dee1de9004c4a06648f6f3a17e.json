and Mark Firkin had been \u2018released and returned\u2019 and all charges against them dropped after a three-month detention.\n\nAt the same time, Iran\u2019s state TV reported that an Iranian scientist, Reza Dehbashi, who was detained for 13 months in Australia over purchasing a defense system for his country from the United States, had returned home.\n\nThere has been no immediate acknowledgement from Iranian officials or in the country\u2019s state media of the couple\u2019s release and no confirmation from either side that a prisoner swap has taken place so

efforts.\n\nMiss King and Mr Firkin were detained in Tehran for spying earlier this year after they reportedly flew a drone without a permit over military areas and unauthorised zones, according to Tasnim news agency\u2019s quote from judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaili.\n\nThe couple \u2013 who had posted updates of their trip across Asia to their thousands of social media followers \u2013 is said to be in \u2018good health and in good spirits\u2019 after being released and reunited with their families.\n\nIn a statement that thanked the Australian government for helping secure their release, they said: \u2018We are extremely happy and relieved to be safely back in Australia with those we love.\n\nJolie King and Mark Firkin are said to be in \u2018good health and in good

Payne also confirmed that Cambridge-educated academic Kylie Moore-Gilbert is still in Tehran\u2019s notorious Evin Prison, which is well-known for holding high-profile foreign and dual-national prisoners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDr Moore-Gilbert, who was a lecturer in Islamic Studies at Melbourne University, has been in jail for almost a year after reportedly being handed a 10-year sentence for spying.\n\nMs Payne said the situation was \u2018very complex\u2019 and that \u2018very long\u2013term negotiations\u2019 were taking place to secure her release.\n\n\u2018She has been detained for some considerable time, and has faced the Iranian legal system and has been convicted and sentenced,\u2019 she said, adding the government did not accept the spying charges against her.\n\nThe University of Melbourne\u2019s website lists Dr Moore-Gilbert on its \u2018Find an expert\u2019 page as a lecturer at the university\u2019s Asia Institute.\n\nMs Payne said \u2018very

published work on the 2011 Arab uprisings, authoritarian governance and on the role of new media technologies in political activism.\n\nDr David Malet, who served on Dr Moore-Gilbert\u2019s dissertation committee, has described her as a \u2018wonderful person and a serious scholar, not a spy\u2019.\n\nA British-Iranian mother-of-one named Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 41, is also currently held in Evin prison after being handed a five-year sentence in 2016 for spying.\n\nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who denies the charges, wrote an open letter this week that revealed she was to send her

arrest.\n\nBatmobile supercar with mounted 'machine gun' could be yours for cool \u00a3686,000\n\nHowever, it is now hoped that she will be back in London before Christmas after her parents applied to Iranian authorities for an exit visa.\n\nIn a letter smuggled out of Tehran prison and published by the Centre for Human Rights in Iran, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe wrote: \u2018In the near future my baby will leave me to go with her father and start school in the UK.\n\n\u2018It will be daunting trip for her travelling and for me left behind.\n\n\u2018And the authorities who hold me will watch on
