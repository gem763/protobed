And when, on Monday, he dared to denounce a rare instance of the public registering opposition directly to the president, his critics were again annoyed. \u201cI strongly disagree @ChrisCoons,\u201d tweeted Neera Tanden, the president of the Center for American Progress and a former top adviser to Hillary Clinton. \u201cI believe the Lock Him Up chant at the Nationals game was affirmatively good; not just not bad,\u201d she added. \u201cBecause it demonstrates Trump and his policies are opposed by large numbers of normal, every day people.\u201d\n\nAnother Democratic strategist and longtime Hillary Clinton booster, Adam Parkhomenko, had a much more direct reaction: \u201cDear Sen. Coons,\u201d he tweeted, \u201cplease do go fuck yourself.\u201d\n\nWhen I spoke to Coons yesterday, he sounded a bit exasperated by the whole thing. He scoffed when I suggested that perhaps he had become chief of the civility police. \u201cThat\u2019s not at all what I\u2019m trying to do,\u201d he said.\n\nCoons told me he hadn\u2019t even watched the World Series game and saw the chanting clip for the first time when CNN\u2019s John Berman played it for him on the air Monday morning. He made clear that it was not the booing he was particularly concerned about\u2014\u201cI\u2019m a Philadelphia sports fan,\u201d he said with a laugh\u2014but the thousands of people demanding to imprison the president, even if they were merely repurposing a chant that began at Trump rallies in 2016 and was directed at Clinton.\n\n\u201cThis is a game that is broadcast internationally,\u201d Coons told me. \u201cThe United States has worked long and hard at a reputation for rule of law and for a democratic system where elections are respected and where the courts are how we resolve disputes. And I\u2019ve been to lots of other countries where political opponents of whoever is in power get locked up for no reason other than the political expediency of the party in power. I would hate to see the country descend to that level.\u201d\n\nFor Coons, however, the chant at Nationals Park was just one example of a larger trend that worries him\u2014one that encompasses both the race to defeat Trump in 2020 and the Democrats\u2019 intensifying effort to impeach him before then.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to see Democrats match him spite for spite, division for division,\u201d he said.\n\nCoons endorsed Biden as soon as the former vice president entered the 2020 race. Yet despite the fact that the impeachment inquiry is centered on allegations that Trump tried to get Ukraine to dig up dirt on Biden, Coons is more skeptical than many other Democrats that the impeachment drive is worth it. \u201cI think that\u2019s a close call,\u201d he told me, before adding that Trump\u2019s actions had given House Democrats \u201cno choice.\u201d\n\nCoons worries that impeachment will overtake the party's efforts to show the public its more substantive policy agenda to combat corruption, reduce prescription drug prices, and enact tighter gun laws. \u201cIt is at risk of being drowned out if we overplay our hand in being overly partisan and in thinking that all we need to do is voice our opposition to Trump,\u201d Coons told me. As an example, he cited Clinton\u2019s campaign in 2016 and said it should serve as a lesson for Democrats in 2020.\n\n\u201cHer closing message in the campaign the last six weeks was, Have you noticed Donald Trump is crazy? He would be a dangerous man as president,\u201d Coons said. \u201cIt didn't work. Folks had already made up their mind on that, one way or the other.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey wanted to hear how their life would be better with her as president rather than him,\u201d he added, \u201cand we should not make that mistake again.\u201d\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
