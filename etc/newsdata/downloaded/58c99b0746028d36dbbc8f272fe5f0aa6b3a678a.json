He\u2019d brought his children to watch, he said, history being made.\n\nDrones have delivered medical samples and burritos in the United States before, but Friday\u2019s deliveries were a milestone for a burgeoning industry. The companies involved in the drop at the Sensmeiers\u2019 home and others to families nearby were the first to make commercial deliveries to homes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI love new things,\u201d Susie Sensmeier, 81, said after the drone had departed for Wing\u2019s base in a nearby business park. \u201cNew technology. A new vest. New experiences. You don\u2019t get a lot of those at my age.\u201d\n\nEstablished delivery companies and start-ups alike have been promising to deliver packages by drone for years, but strict rules governing U.S. airspace have hampered their ambitions. This spring, though, Wing and then a UPS subsidiary received the clearances they needed from the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of talk about drones. Today, we\u2019re actually doing it. We\u2019re actually delivering an e-commerce order to someone\u2019s doorstep,\u201d said Richard W. Smith, the FedEx executive. \u201cThis is not vaporware. This is real. It\u2019s here today.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn the drone industry, people often talk about a \u201ccrawl, walk, run\u201d approach to getting unmanned aircraft safely flying alongside planes and helicopters. Jay Merkle, head of the FAA\u2019s drone integration office, said the industry has now crossed into walking, prodded in part by a 2017 directive issued by President Trump. Running, Merkle said, will be when projects like the one in Christiansburg can be scaled across the country.\n\nAD\n\nThat still looks to be a ways off.\n\nClearing Wing to operate for what it is still calling a trial required painstaking work to figure out how to apply to drones rules written years ago with airplanes and helicopters in mind. The company remains bound by strict limits on its operations.\n\nAD\n\nPilots groups have been carefully watching the process, formally lodging safety concerns with the FAA. And while the mayor of Christiansburg said Wing has been welcomed to the town, a proposal by Uber to launch a drone food delivery service in San Diego has been met with local opposition over noise concerns.\n\nIn recent written comments to the FAA, the Air Line Pilots Association International, complained that the internal manuals Wing relies on to demonstrate that it can operate safely are proprietary and so can\u2019t be assessed by the public. The far-reaching scope of exemptions from flight rules that Wing has sought, the group wrote, \u201cappears to erode the safety levels established by the FAA.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut the FAA says it needs the data gathered from early operations to decide how to write any future rules \u2014 doing otherwise, Merkle said, would \u201ccompletely stifle innovation.\u201d\n\nTom McMahon, a spokesman for the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, a drone advocacy organization, said that progress has been slower than the industry would like but that meaningful steps forward have been made in recent months. He said he expects that customers will come to appreciate the speedy delivery made possible by hoisting packages through the air.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like anything else we\u2019ve seen with technology,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t appreciate what it provides to us until it starts performing the service.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSusie Sensmeier, who agreed to take part in Friday\u2019s event after attending a Wing demo a few weeks ago, said she wished she had had access to Wing\u2019s service in the summer when her husband was recovering from a broken leg. Walgreens, which is also participating in the project by offering a list of 100 products for sale, including over-the-counter medical goods, snacks and drinks, is pitching it as a boon to parents with sick kids.\n\nAD\n\nThe idea in Christiansburg, a town of about 22,500 where Wing set up shop in partnership with nearby Virginia Tech, is for customers to be able to use an app on their phone to place an order and get a delivery within about 10 minutes.\n\nThe drone that arrived at the Sensmeiers\u2019 had departed from a base that Wing calls a nest, about a mile away. Built from artfully arranged gray shipping containers, the nest is like a slice of Silicon Valley tucked behind a Mexican restaurant and a bar in small-town Virginia.\n\nAD\n\nInside, about a dozen of the drones sit on launchpads where their batteries can be charged.\n\nThe drones are made of the same kind of foam used in bicycle helmets and fly using a combination of 12 helicopter-like rotors and two wing-mounted propellers. A single pilot can monitor up to five of the autonomous aircraft from a control booth inside one of the shipping containers. Observers who monitor the air are stationed around town.\n\nAD\n\nFrom the nest, the drone travels at speeds up to 65 mph and can carry three-pound packages to homes within about 3\u00bd miles. When it arrives, the drone lowers the package, nestling it on the ground.\n\nHundreds of potential customers have signed up, a Wing spokeswoman said.\n\nAD\n\nChristiansburg Mayor Michael Barber said Wing had done a good job of being visible in the community, showing up at street festivals and markets, where the company has been flooded with interest.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the more exciting innovations to come our way in a while,\u201d said Barber, a retired banker and veteran of town politics. \u201cI\u2019ve not heard any complaints whatsoever.\u201d\n\nWing isn\u2019t charging for deliveries, and unlike UPS, Uber and Amazon, the other companies that have obtained or are publicly known to be seeking approval to deliver packages by drones, it\u2019s not already in the delivery business. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\nWing chief executive James Ryan Burgess said the company will succeed by forming partnerships with businesses big and small \u2014 one of its partners in Christiansburg is a local sweet shop \u2014 offering them faster, cheaper deliveries than going by ground.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cDrone technology has the potential to be radically lower cost,\u201d Burgess said.\n\nAsked why FedEx looked for outside help while UPS has pursued its program in-house, Smith said his company\u2019s expertise is not in building drones. Ultimately, Smith said, he expects drones to complement the company\u2019s existing drivers, potentially hauling the one package that can\u2019t be neatly fit into an efficient ground route.\n\n\u201cWe believe that Wing had a technology that was ahead of other drone technologies,\u201d he said. \u201cThe proof\u2019s in the pudding. We\u2019re out here delivering packages. Others are just talking about it.\u201d\n\nWhile the development of self-driving cars and trucks \u2014 the other major technology poised to change the country\u2019s transportation system \u2014 has been marked in many ways by the absence of federal rules, would-be drone operators have had to contend with the strict control the FAA imposes over the nation\u2019s skies.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOver the past half-decade, the agency has gradually found ways to allow unmanned aircraft to undertake increasingly sophisticated operations.\n\nWing and UPS now have certification as commercial air carriers, leading UPS to bill itself as the first \u201cdrone airline\u201d when its approval was granted this month. UPS is conducting deliveries of medical samples at a hospital campus in North Carolina and carried out a run immediately upon getting its new approval, laying claim to a first of its own.\n\n\u201cThis is history in the making, and we aren\u2019t done yet,\u201d UPS chief executive David Abney said in a statement at the time.\n\nIn practice, though, both companies are still required to adhere to a lengthy set of limits even as they\u2019ve been granted waivers from some FAA rules.\n\nSome changes were straightforward: Wing\u2019s small drone won\u2019t need to carry pilot manuals on board, for example. Other issues have been more contentious: Wing sought to relax the medical certificate requirements for its pilots and to allow pilots to switch over while the drones were in the air, but the FAA rejected those ideas in a decision issued this month.\n\nMerkle said he expects that the relationship between regulators and operators will continue to evolve, calling the work with Wing and UPS a \u201ctremendous learning experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are learning to apply to existing regulations in a very innovative way to maintain the safety our communities expect,\u201d he said.", "description": "Wing, FedEx and Walgreens team up to send packages by air to customers\u2019 front lawns.", "authors": ["Ian Duncan", "Member Of The Transportation Team Focused On The U.S. Department Of Transportation"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/nIwBKUWlCN-SYXpJu7J8YH7djsM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KBZCGRXSBII6TCPL5RLM2QKHGI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
