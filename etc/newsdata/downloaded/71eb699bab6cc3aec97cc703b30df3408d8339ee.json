The Bachelorette runner-up spoke to People TV on its Reality Check show yesterday, where he addressed their current relationship along with the reason a full-fledge romance didn't work between the two.\n\nWhen he looks back at their relationship, he's just appreciative he got to make a good friend out of it, he told the outlet. He was asked what the best part of their relationship was: \u201cJust meeting someone that was great. She\u2019s a great person, and I met a great friend,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cShe\u2019s someone that I have a lot of respect for and think highly of, so I met a great person.\"\n\n\"I took it as I met a great person, a great friend,\" he continued. Then he confirmed that yes, they did split and for an understandable reason: \"It wasn\u2019t like a bad breakup or anything like that. It was just, we\u2019re at different parts of our lives right now. We\u2019re just friends.\"\n\nHadid recently got out of a serious multi-year relationship with Zayn Malik at the beginning of this year. A source close to Hadid told E! when she and Cameron first started going on dates that Hadid wasn't ready for anything serious.\n\n\"They are both very into each other, but Gigi has been really hesitant about getting serious with him,\" that source said in August. \"She feels she just ended a long-term relationship and wants to strictly have fun right now. She really enjoys hanging out with Tyler and he has spent the night over her house multiple times now. Tyler makes Gigi laugh continuously while they are together, and it's been a while since someone has sparked her interest.\"\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "\u201cShe\u2019s someone that I have a lot of respect for.\"", "authors": ["Alyssa Bailey"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/TD9WuGXPuCiGZ59CGm3N_w--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/elle_570/88a5b157f0026ac892be1f78aeabf92d", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
