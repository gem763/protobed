James Milner and Ki-Jana Hoever were on target in a 2-0 win at MK Dons to set up a clash with Arsenal while Chelsea crushed Grimsby Town 7-1 to give manager Frank Lampard a first home win since taking charge.\n\nChelsea, for whom Michy Batshuayi scored twice and three players were handed their first starts including Reece James who also scored, will face Manchester United in round four.\n\n\u201cWe got some players who haven\u2019t been playing so many minutes, players that are younger, starting the game,\u201d Lampard, who also brought on two debutants in the second half, said.\n\n\u201cA nice comfortable win having not won here yet so on those levels, of course I am happy.\u201d\n\nAston Villa won an all Premier League match against Brighton and Hove Albion, prevailing 3-1 to set up a fourth-round meeting with Wolverhampton Wanderers who also needed penalties to get past Championship side Reading.\n\nSlideshow (8 Images)\n\nWhile Solskjaer will have breathed a sigh of relief that United avoided a shock exit, it was Rochdale\u2019s 5,500 fans who were applauding most loudly after the shootout.\n\nRochdale are 17th in League One and were beaten 6-0 by Peterborough 10 days ago but defended valiantly against a United side lacking a clinical edge despite overwhelming possession.\n\n\u201cGo 1-0 up, get the second. That is a learning curve,\u201d Solskjaer, said. \u201cAt this club you don\u2019t just sit back and think one is enough.\u201d", "description": "Manchester United's current malaise was laid bare as they struggled past third-tier Rochdale 5-3 on penalties after a 1-1 draw in the League Cup third round at Old Trafford on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Martyn Herman", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433906211&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O250", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
