We got told there were nine of them and we left it at that, comfortable in the knowledge that we knew everything that there is to know about the solar system and that that would not change. Imagine the hubris. Like ancient Egyptians confident that the periodic inundation of the Nile River was caused by the divine will of the Pharaohs (and not by, say, monsoons in the Ethiopian Highlands), we never anticipated that this knowledge could come into doubt.\n\nWe were fools. Pluto is not a planet, but a hypothetical \u2018Planet Nine\u2019 might be (although we\u2019ve never seen it, if it does exist). Jupiter has the most moons of any planet in the solar system \u2014 or so we thought. In the words of clearly very enthusiastic astronomer Scott S Sheppard, it is, in fact, Saturn who is the \u201ctrue moon King\u201c.\n\nThe International Astronomical Union\u2019s Minor Planet Center announced Monday that a team headed up by Sheppard had discovered 20 hitherto undiscovered moons orbiting our solar system\u2019s most accessorised gas giant, bringing it to a total of 82. Jupiter, which previously held the title of \u2018moon king\u2019 (?), has only 79. Disgusting!\n\nThe moons were discovered orbiting Saturn using the Subaru Telescope on Mauna Kea in Hawaii, which is the same telescope with which another team led by Sheppard discovered 12 new moons in orbit around Jupiter. \u201cUsing some of the largest telescopes in the world, we are now completing the inventory of small moons around the giant planets,\u201d says Sheppard. \u201cThey play a crucial role in helping us determine how our Solar System\u2019s planets formed and evolved.\u201d\n\nMost of the moons are pretty tiny, sitting around only 5km in diameter, compared to the 3,474km diameter of our comparatively very thicc moon.\n\nCarnegie is running a competition to name Saturn\u2019s lovely new moons, although you have to stick within the theme of \u201cgiants from Norse, Gallic or Inuit mythology\u201d, so Moony McMoonface is probably out of the question.", "description": "The gas giant Saturn has 20 more moons than we previously thought it had, making her the \"true moon king\" of the solar system.", "authors": ["Ben Mcleay"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/20191008001425072202-original.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
