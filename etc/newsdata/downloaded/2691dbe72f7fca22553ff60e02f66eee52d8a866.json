Come back whenever you\u2019re ready. Of course you\u2019re probably not a professional studio designer, and you almost certainly won\u2019t spend more than a few seconds on the task, so you might have accepted a few lazy cliches and tired stereotypes. I\u2019m wagering there was a lot of cherry blossom involved, a bonsai tree or two, perhaps some paper lanterns and a view of Mount Fuji. Well that image in your head is the ITV World Cup studio. They gave the Great Wave a wide berth and shirked the sushi, but otherwise it\u2019s all there.\n\nJapan open Rugby World Cup by overcoming dogged Russia Read more\n\nBut if ITV has played safe with the studio, its choice of theme music has come way out of left field. Unlike, say, in 2007, when it simply used the tournament\u2019s official anthem (a version of World in Union by a supergroup featuring Katherine Jenkins, Bryn Terfel, Lesley Garrett and others) or in 2011, when they used the tournament\u2019s official anthem (a version of World in Union by Hayley Westenra) or for that matter in 2015, when they used the tournament\u2019s official anthem (a version of World in Union by Paloma Faith), this time they shunned the tournament\u2019s official anthem (a version of World in Union by Kiyoe Yoshioka) in favour of their own specially-commissioned accompaniment (a version of World in Union by Emeli Sand\u00e9). This is revolutionary, in its way.\n\nAnother surprise follows halfway through the opening programme, when presenter Mark Pougatch reveals a hitherto hidden annexe to the main studio. This dojo is, he explains, \u201cour demonstration area, where we\u2019re going to be illustrating some of the important points of the game, especially for those of you who aren\u2019t regular rugby-watchers\u201d. Jonny Wilkinson, Sam Warburton and Brian O\u2019Driscoll proceed to put on an extremely complicated exposition on the art of tackling and the rules that govern it. \u201cIt\u2019s all about understanding what a wrap actually entails,\u201d concludes O\u2019Driscoll. \u201cYou must wrap with your tackling shoulder.\u201d Those who aren\u2019t regular rugby-watchers, and for whom a wrap more commonly entails a visit to the sandwich aisle in Tesco, are unlikely to be significantly wiser.\n\nThe opening ceremony is not a classic of the genre. Since the invention of miraculous enormous pitch-covering floor-screens it has become too easy to avoid the complex retellings of the history of sport through the medium of folk dancing which were once a staple of such occasions in favour of simply showing some video, which is diverting enough but not really in the spirit. Still, commentator Miles Harrison gets to deliver a few classic lines \u2013 \u201cA rugby ball becomes a seed of light spreading around the world\u201d \u2013 so our time was not totally wasted.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The art of tackling was demonstrated in a hidden annexe to the main studio modelled on a dojo. Photograph: ITV Sport\n\nThe ceremony concludes when an area of miracle floor-screen, having already transformed into Mount Fuji, splits open to reveal Richie McCaw waving the Webb Ellis Cup. A few minutes later ITV returns to the stadium for a chat with the former Wales international Shane Williams. \u201cYou can hear behind us now,\u201d he says, gesturing to the crowd, \u201cthe rugby hasn\u2019t even kicked off, the opening ceremony hasn\u2019t kicked off, and they\u2019re already having a party.\u201d It may have been expedient to pre-record this segment, and convenient not to mention they had done so, but they could at least have used some of the time that bought them to insist Williams find something less confusing to say.\n\nWilliams is exposed again with the game barely five minutes old, as he describes Will Tupou completely failing to catch the ball and thus allowing Russia to snaffle an early try. \u201cI\u2019m not sure who\u2019s under this,\u201d he expert-analyses, \u201cbut he gets nowhere near it, does he?\u201d That slight mis-step apart, the game \u2013 unlike Tupou\u2019s catch \u2013 is largely well handled. The hosts run out easy and popular victors, and attention instantly turns to Saturday and the mouth-watering meeting of South Africa and New Zealand.\n\nIn ITV\u2019s closing moments Bryan Habana, the former Springbok wing, is asked for his thoughts on that game. \u201cLet\u2019s just make sure we get the traffic in early because there might be quite a few cars going to that stadium,\u201d he says. That is literally all Habana has to say on perhaps the tie of the pool stage. And so ends ITV\u2019s first test of the tournament, a few hours with no car crashes but perhaps just the occasional snarl-up.", "description": "Japanese cliches, popular victors and a confusing tackle \u2018demonstration area\u2019 made for interesting viewing on the opening day", "authors": ["Simon Burnton"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb690b2687c7778be2f4641185c42d534cbc44ed/61_163_1945_1167/master/1945.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=8aca85a28cef18720ee347932726f132", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
