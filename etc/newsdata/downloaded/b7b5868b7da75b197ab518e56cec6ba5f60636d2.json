It was probably five feet tall, and ten feet foot long. I remember my buddy and I bet a can of pop on who would be first to land a 360. Neither of us had ever done this before. We went shot for shot, trying this 360 for about an hour. We were slamming, over and over. We were both completely covered in dirt and sweat. Then suddenly, I did it!\n\nI could not believe it. I stomped it for the first time. I can remember it so vividly, how the sun was shining on the landing, how the wind felt as I was spinning through the air. and the sound of everyone yelling when I landed it. I was so happy, I just launched my bike into the bushes and let out the biggest scream. I was so hyped. I claimed my prize, and chugged it, then went home and told my parents I had landed a 360. My mom\u2019s first words were, \u201cWhat happened to you?!\u201d I looked like I had been rolling around in mud for hours. I showed her the video of my jump and she said \u201cJust please never try a backflip.\u201d I remember that I was honest with her: \u201cDon't worry\u2026I will!\u201c", "description": "- CBC Sports Player's Own Voice", "authors": ["Jaden Chipman For Cbc Sports"], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/playersvoice/content/hero/_mobile/jaden_hero.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
