That was a good bit of luck in hindsight, meaning I missed some of the nightmarish Xbox Live issues that stopped players from joining lobbies, preventing progress, and just generally making the game a tad unplayable.\n\nI'd have been rightly pissed if that happened to me while I was working through the campaign. Fortunately, it didn't. But that still left plenty of time to go over the Gears story.\n\nGears 5 Campaign: The Kotaku Review Gears 5 has the longest and most ambitious campaign that Gears of War has ever done and, for the most part, that ambition pays off. In a series first, the story focuses on a female character, putting the player in a woman\u2019s shoes for the majority of the game.

And if you're looking at the PC version in particular, good news: it runs super well. Read more\n\nI haven't had a chance to mess around with Horde mode or anything that requires the bizarrely complicated in-game currencies, and I'm curious to know what the experience has been like for those playing on consoles. I saw mention in other threads about some crashes and progression issues, although those two things might not be related. And if you have spent time with the multiplayer so far, or played through the campaign on co-op, how's the experience been?\n\nFor what it's worth, I enjoyed the campaign \u2014 and it's a stunning looking game, minus some hilariously broken pop-in issues I had during the second act. Don't know that I'd say it was a standout console exclusive for Xbox or anything, but Gears fans will undoubtedly appreciate the change in tack from Gears 4.\n\nWhat's your experience with Gears been like to date?", "description": "Sometimes, enforced breaks come at the best possible time.", "authors": ["Beth Elderkin", "Alex Walker"], "top_image": "https://edge.alluremedia.com.au/m/k/2019/09/gears-5-8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
