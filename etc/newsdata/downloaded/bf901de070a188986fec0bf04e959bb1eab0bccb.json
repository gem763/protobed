He now says the policy was miscalculated.\n\n\u201cWhen you see the impact in the six-week period on 2,500-or-so families and understand the emotional pain for those children, it\u2019s not worth it,\u201d McAleenan told the Post. \u201cIt\u2019s the one part of this whole thing that I couldn\u2019t ever be part of again.\u201d\n\nMcAleenan has been acting DHS secretary for about six months now after Kirstjen Nielsen\u2019s firing, working with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Before that, he led CBP and was tasked with implementing the zero-tolerance policy that ended after nationwide backlash.\n\nBut despite having the job for six months and pleasing the administration with reduced border arrest numbers, President Donald Trump still has not nominated McAleenan as secretary.\n\nMcAleenan grew in prominence in CBP under the Obama administration but has remained more of an outsider in the Trump White House than hard-line immigration officials such as USCIS head Ken Cuccinelli and acting CBP Commissioner Mark Morgan because of his hesitance about his agency\u2019s growing politicization, the Post reported.\n\n\u201cWhat I don\u2019t have control over is the tone, the message, the public face and approach of the department in an increasingly polarized time,\u201d he told the Post. \u201cThat\u2019s uncomfortable, as the accountable, senior figure.\u201d\n\nMcAleenan reportedly sees DHS as a neutral agency that should do its job regardless of who\u2019s president, and he has avoided using dehumanizing immigration rhetoric that Trump\u2019s White House pushes, putting at risk the perception of his allegiance to Trump, according to the newspaper.", "description": "Kevin McAleenan expressed frustration to The Washington Post about his inability to control the department's approach \"in an increasingly polarized time.\"", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d93e54c2100005100514508.jpeg?cache=idn051lqt3&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
