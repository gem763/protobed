Facebook already is the subject of a Federal Trade Commission investigation after it reached a $5 billion settlement with the FTC earlier this year over data-privacy practices.\n\nLast week, members of Congress met privately with Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg to voice their concerns over Facebook\u2019s economic power and its privacy issues. The company acknowledged in a blog post on Friday that it had suspended \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of apps for potentially improper data-collection methods.\n\nRead more: Facebook says \u2018tens of thousands\u2019 of apps suspended over privacy issues\n\nA video of Live Maps depicted \u201cmulti-layer representations of the world\u201d such as projected holographic avatars to hang out with through traditional maps, crowdsourced data, and footage captured via AR glasses and smartphones. It\u2019s the type of Big Brother-like technology that got Alphabet Inc.\u2019s GOOGL, +2.27% GOOG, +2.28% Google\u2019s Street View system into legal hot water.\n\nBosworth gave no timetable on the availability of Live Maps, which he said would \u201cbridge the physical and digital divides.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, rumors have swirled around Facebook\u2019s AR glasses in recent days. One recent rumor: It is teaming with Ray-Ban to deliver a pair of specs that can live stream the world around you.", "description": "Facebook Inc. confirmed on Wednesday it is developing augmented reality glasses that should be ready in a few years, and announced a project called \u201cLive...", "authors": ["Jon Swartz", "Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS076_Facebo_ZG_20190925165920.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
