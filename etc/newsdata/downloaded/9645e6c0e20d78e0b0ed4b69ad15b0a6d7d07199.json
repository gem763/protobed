Korea Asked for 'Everything' While Offering Nothing", "language": "en", "text": "SEOUL - North Korea is demanding that the U.S. \u201cdo everything\u201d before Pyongyang makes any concessions, Harry Harris, the U.S. Ambassador to South Korea, said in an interview published Monday.\n\nHarris\u2019 comments to South Korea\u2019s Dong-A-Ilbo newspaper are the first substantive reaction by a U.S. official since North Korea walked away from working-level nuclear talks late last week and blamed the U.S. for the breakdown.\n\nWhile noting he was not present at the negotiations held in the capital of Sweden, Harris suggested that North Korea, not the U.S., was to blame for the impasse.\n\n\u201cIn my view, North Korea demanded that the United States do everything before doing anything,\u201d Harris was quoted as saying. He did not elaborate.\n\nThe U.S. State Department previously insisted the discussions went \u201cgood,\u201d and pushed back against North Korea\u2019s accusation that U.S. negotiators failed to bring any new ideas to the talks.\n\nNorth Korea has since threatened to resume long-range ballistic missile or nuclear tests and reiterated its end-of-year deadline for the U.S. to take a more flexible approach.\n\nIn the interview, conducted Friday, Harris downplayed the importance of the deadline, calling it \u201cartificially set\u201d by North Korea.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. still wants to keep up the dialogue\u201d and figure out how to implement the declaration signed by U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore in June 2018, Harris said. But whether that happens \u201cdepends on North Korea,\u201d he added.\n\nTrump has met Kim two other times since Singapore, and has recently said he is open to a fourth meeting.\n\nBut Trump has not set a timeline for such a summit, Harris said, adding: \u201cWe think it is better to have serious working level talks.\u201d\n\n\u201c(Harris) also said yes when asked if his comment means that Washington would not pursue a summit with the North before they see progress in working-level talks,\u201d the report noted.\n\nTalks have been stalled since February, when Trump walked away abruptly from a meeting with Kim in Hanoi, Vietnam. At that meeting, Trump rejected Kim\u2019s offer to dismantle a key nuclear facility in exchange for lifting a majority of sanctions against Pyongyang.\n\nU.S. and North Korean officials have not commented on what either side offered in Stockholm.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s foreign ministry insisted last week the North would not hold any more \u201csickening negotiations\u201d until the U.S. takes a \u201csubstantial step\u201d toward a \u201ccomplete and irreversible withdrawal\u201d of its \u201chostile policy.\"\n\nTrump has not publicly reacted to the latest breakdown in talks. But in recent months, Trump has given several signs he is more interested in reaching a deal.\n\nTrump recently fired John Bolton, his national security advisor, who disagrees with the White House's outreach to Kim. Trump has also spoken of the need for a \u201cnew method\u201d to the nuclear talks.", "description": "North Korea is demanding that the U.S. \u201cdo everything\u201d before Pyongyang makes any concessions, Harry Harris, the U.S. Ambassador to South Korea, said in an interview published Monday.\u00a0\n\nHarris\u2019 comments to South Korea\u2019s Dong-A-Ilbo newspaper are the first substantive reaction by a U.S. official since North Korea walked away from working-level nuclear talks late last week and blamed the U.S.", "authors": ["Written By"], "top_image": "https://media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/ap-images/2019/10/659b99bbeb5603e2b762cd554eb354c7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
