In other words, it does not produce a \"high\" sensation.\n\nWeed spoke with As it Happens host Carol Off about the theft problem that he says is growing worse by the day. Here is part of their conversation.\n\nDale Weed is the owner of Pure Functional Foods and a hemp farmer in Savannah, N.Y. (Submitted by Dale Weed)\n\nJust how big a target has your firm become for thieves?\n\nWell, it's become a lot bigger than I thought. We didn't think there'd be any problem with people stealing from us, but it's gotten to ... once a week, and then it's gotten to the point of almost every day now. ... We've got hundreds of plants that people have taken.\n\nAnd taken how? How are they getting your plants?\n\nThey trespass onto the property. They make trails through the woods. They drive onto our land, and then usually use machetes to chop the plants down and hurry away.\n\nWhy are people stealing your hemp plants?\n\nWell, everybody that we've talked to \u2014 we've had one person come and apologize after they're arrested \u2014 believes it's actually marijuana. And, you know, it smells similar and looks similar \u2014 but it's nothing like its bad cousin, marijuana.\n\nWe thought after, you know, they did it the first couple of times, we thought it would stop, but it's just gotten worse and worse.\n\nThe people are probably either users or sellers of marijuana. And if it's a user, they'll be sadly disappointed, because you could smoke a whole telephone pole of this product and you won't get high.\n\nBut if it's a seller, then they're going to be selling it to dissatisfied customers, and they'll probably come back and retaliate against them.\n\nHemp plants at MERJ farms in Bristol, Tenn. Dale Weed says thefts of the plants by people mistaking them for marijuana is a growing problem nationwide. (David Crigger/Bristol Herald Courier/Associated Press)\n\nHow often are you being hit?\n\nEvery day. And then I talked to one farmer in New York state, that he's been confronted at gunpoint by people stealing his crop. And it's happened more than once.\n\nAnd does he tell them, \"Hey, guess what? This is not weed. This is not dope\"?\n\nWell, if you have a man pointing a gun at you telling you you're getting robbed, it's really not a point \u2014 at that point \u2014 where you do a lot of discussion, I think.\n\nJust out of curiosity, Mr. Weed ... do you think it's possible that people think that it's a weed farm because of your name?\n\nNo. Most people don't know my name. My name hasn't been associated with it. I own a food manufacturing company, so it's always associated with the name of our company, Pure Functional Foods.\n\nMuscle Joint & Relief Cream displayed at the Cannabis World Congress & Business Exposition trade show in New York in May \u2014 an example of one of the many products derived from hemp CBD. (Mark Lennihan/Associated Press)\n\nWhat are the police saying?\n\nThe police have made several arrests, and are planning to make more. The thieves ... put videos of themselves doing this on Facebook. So a lot of it's been very easy to prove, because they've videoed themselves doing it.\n\nI've [talked to] one farmer that's lost a quarter of an acre just in one field. People are stealing it in the daytime. He's got people that were paid to come and steal it. He's met people in his field [and] asked them, \"Why are you here?\" And they said, \"The same reason you're here \u2014 to steal weed.\" And they're telling the owner of the farm that they're there stealing weed from him.\n\nHave you confronted the thieves?\n\nI haven't. My family and I've spent many hours watching our property. And we've got videos of people stealing \u2014 game cameras, and our company videos \u2014 but they all hide their identity ... We're working with the state police at this point. And in another year, we'll certainly have a lot more protection, if we decide to do this again.\n\nWhat do you grow the hemp for?\n\nIt's just for CBD (cannabidiol). And we have a license to extract the CBD out of the hemp plant. And, you know, if somebody's coming on our land, and they want to take hemp plants to take the CBD out, they need about a million dollars to be able to do that.\n\nSo I don't think anybody coming to steal our plants has that extra million dollars to spend.\n\nAS IT HAPPENS: Newfoundlander once jailed for pot charge makes his 1st legal cannabis sale\n\nDo you think this will come to an end?\n\nI think it'll come to an end when it becomes a felony. I believe that the government needs to make it a felony \u2014 like [in] Australia. It's a felony there. It's one year in prison, and a $15,000 fine.\n\nSo, you know, if they're experiencing something with more bite in the law \u2014 right now, it's just basically trespass. And so it's hardly of any consequence for people to steal currently. I've talked to several people and they are they are interested in pursuing that.\n\nInterview produced by Chloe Shantz-Hilkes.
