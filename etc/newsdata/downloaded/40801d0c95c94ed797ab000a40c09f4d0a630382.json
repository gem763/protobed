Authorities ordered all 900 residents of the community of Geyserville to evacuate after the fire in the Sonoma County wine region north of San Francisco grew to more than 15 square miles.\n\nAn Associated Press photographer saw three homes destroyed in the Jimtown area.\n\nFlames consume a home as the Kincade Fire tears through the Jimtown community of Sonoma County, Calif., on Thursday, Oct. 24, 2019. Noah Berger / AP\n\nThere were no reports of injuries and no immediate information about what caused the fire, but wildfire risk was extremely high as humidity levels plunged and winds gusted up to 70 mph.\n\nCBS San Francisco reports Cal Fire spokesman Scott McLean described the difficult conditions firefighters were facing early Thursday.\n\n\"The wind is definitely pushing the fire,\" he said. \"The area has a lot of brush and indefensible terrain. It's hard to fight\u2026It's dark right now so we don't have any eyes in the sky\u2026They (the firefighters) definitely have a fight on their hands.\"\n\nThe Pacific Gas & Electric Co. utility on Wednesday began rolling blackouts stretching from the Sierra foothills in the northeast to portions of the San Francisco Bay Area in a bid to keep the electrical grid from causing fires due to wind that can send power lines toppling, starting fires.\n\nThe blackouts impacted a half-million people - or nearly 180,000 customers - in 15 counties, and PG&E warned that a second round of outages could occur over the weekend when winds were forecast to return.\n\nHot and dry Santa Ana winds were expected to hit Southern California Thursday and the Southern California Edison utility warned that it might black out about 308,000 customers - perhaps 750,000 people - depending on the forecast.\n\n#kincadefire is moving quickly.

But its seven-day forecast shows a likelihood of another planned blackout across a much larger area. The timing wasn't clear, but it could start as early as Saturday, when even heavier winds are expected to move through.\n\n\"This could be the strongest wind event of the season, unfortunately,\" PG&E meteorologist Scott Strenfel said.\n\nStrenfel called the current wind event a \"California-wide phenomenon.\"\n\nThe small city of Calistoga, in the Napa Valley, known for its hot springs and wineries, was among those hit by Wednesday's outage.\n\n\"It's very frustrating,\" said Michael Dunsford, owner of the 18-room Calistoga Inn, which has rented two powerful generators for the month at a cost of $5,000. Like many, he felt the outages need to be better managed, better targeted and less expansive.\n\n\"Right now, we have no wind. Zero. I don't even see a single leaf blowing. Did they really have to cut the power right now?\" he said, shortly after the lights went out and he revved up the generators. \"When the wind picks up to 40 mph maybe that's a good time to close the power.\"\n\n\"They're not appreciating enough the impact this has on everybody,\" he said about PG&E.\n\nSome of the frustration was being taken out on PG&E employees, the company's CEO said.\n\nJohnson said a PG&E employee was the target of what appeared to be a deliberate attack in Glenn County. He said a projectile that may have come from a pellet gun hit the employee's front window. The employee wasn't hurt.\n\n\"There is no justification for this sort of violence,\" Johnson said. \"Wherever you see crews they are there to help you.\"\n\nSonoma County Supervisor James Gore said PG&E was better this time about getting information to people who would be affected, but he was still astonished by the need to resort to largescale blackouts.\n\n\"I am a big believer in shutdowns to prevent fires. But the thing that erodes public trust is when it doesn't make sense,\" he said. \"You say, 'God, I know if we can put a man on the moon ... we can manage a (power) grid.'\"\n\nMeanwhile, in Southern California, a wind-driven vegetation fire dubbed the Old Water Fire burned between 50 and 100 acres with zero containment early Thursday, CBS Los Angeles reports. A spokesperson for the San Bernardino National Forest told the station the fire had \"extreme potential\" for large growth as Santa Ana winds began to pick up. Evacuations were ordered for portions of north San Bernardino.", "description": "Wildfire explodes in size as dangerously windy weather prompted the state's largest utility to impose electrical blackouts in an effort to prevent fire catastrophes", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/24/035a9bb5-9ce1-4621-ba02-95c8a045f9b0/thumbnail/1200x630/8f4f86d2e4d84509fc40309985c30cab/wildfires-ap-19297506854313.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
