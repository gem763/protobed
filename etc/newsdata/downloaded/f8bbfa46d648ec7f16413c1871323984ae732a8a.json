The annual holiday to mark the modern nation's founding, during which hundreds of millions of people travel, began on National Day on Oct. 1 and ended on Monday this year.\n\nAccording to a report from Alibaba, which owns travel app Fliggy, hotel bookings in 10 classic destinations that had witnessed key moments in the history of the ruling Communist Party rose by an average of 300% year-on-year over Oct. 1-3.\n\nDomestic tourism revenue grew 8.47% year-on-year over the break, slipping from 9.04% growth last year and marking the lowest growth in at least 17 years, according to data released by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping oversaw a massive military parade in Beijing on Oct. 1 to celebrate the anniversary.\n\nAmid a cooling economy, many local governments across the country had ramped up tourism campaigns and promises of cheaper holidays in the run-up to the National Day holidays this year.\n\nChinese tourists also cut back overseas travel and spending.\n\nChina is the single largest source of tourists in the world.\n\nFor the first six days of the holiday, the number of border crossings by Chinese mainland residents fell 15.1% from the previous year, according to the National Immigration Administration.\n\nTourists from the top seven Chinese cities for outbound travel reduced their per capita spending by amounts ranging from 16% to 25% compared to last year, according to Reuters' calculations based on data from online travel firm Ctrip.com.\n\nVisits to Hong Kong, which has been wracked by anti-government protests since March, fell sharply.\n\nFrom Oct. 1-7, the average daily number of tour groups from the mainland registered by the Travel Industry Council of Hong Kong declined by 85.4% compared with last year, according to Alice Chan, executive director of the Travel Industry Council of Hong Kong.\n\nMainland visitors weren't the only ones put off by growing violence in the Chinese-ruled city. Total tourist arrivals in Hong Kong plunged more than 50% in the period compared with last year.\n\nSome tour agencies in the city have asked their staff to take unpaid leave, and a few have succeeded in getting their landlords to reduce rents, Chan said in an email.\n\nLayoffs are possible, she added.\n\nChinese are being more cautious in their travel choices amid increasing economic uncertainty, more restrictions on travel to Taiwan, and stricter U.S. visa policies amid trade tensions, said Deng Ning, an associate professor at the Department of Tourism Management at Beijing International Studies University.
