With Eddie Jones and Steve Hansen set to do battle through England and New Zealand, in the heat of a Rugby World Cup semi-final, you just knew that the week somehow would come to life.\n\nThe niceties threatened to continue when Hansen threw no punches in Tuesday\u2019s press conference. \u201cEddie will decide whether he wants to go there and I\u2019ve already decided what I want to do,\u201d said the All Blacks coach.\n\nBut some nine miles east of New Zealand\u2019s team hotel, Jones was getting ready to let loose. Allegations of spying, jibes to the Kiwi media, claims that the pressure is all on the reigning world champions, and all said with a smile on the face of the Australia. Jones knew exactly what he was doing, but then again so does Hansen.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

The pair are good mates and regularly talk when not in the hotbed of a World Cup campaign, which is perhaps why they are looking forward to Saturday\u2019s encounter so much. Jones started the week off on Sunday by hailing the All Blacks as the greatest team not just in rugby, but in world sport, hailing their win ratio of close to 90 per cent as untouchable by any other team on the planet.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really nice statement and I wouldn\u2019t think that Eddie believes that but he is also being quite kind to us,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cHistory is history and it is about creating new history and both teams are going to go at each other on Saturday, and that game won\u2019t define either team but it will give one team the opportunity to go through to play a final. That\u2019s where everyone\u2019s concentration is. I just know that there is a lot of respect between the two teams and the two coaches.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The Australian used his appearance to stress that the pressure is firmly on New Zealand and their attempt to make history and win the World Cup three times in a row \u2013 no other team has won it back-to-back.\n\n\u201cOur guys have experienced it, 13 of our current players went on the Lions tour,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThey went down there, they played in their back yard. They know they\u2019re human. They bleed, they drop balls, they miss tackles like every other player.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our job to take the time and space away so that we put them under pressure. New Zealand talk about walking towards pressure, well this week the pressure is going to be chasing them down the street. That\u2019s the reality of it, that\u2019s how we\u2019re approaching it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got nothing to lose, that\u2019s the exciting thing for us. We can just go out there and play our game. If we\u2019re good enough we\u2019ll win, if we\u2019re not good enough we\u2019ve done our best.\u201d\n\nThe problem is that recent history not only suggests but proves that New Zealand are better at dealing with that pressure in the biggest matches than any other team. A World Cup final under the pressure of an expectant home crowd? Tick. A second successive final victory against your resurgent historic rivals? Tick. When New Zealand need to deliver, more often than not they do.\n\nWhich is perhaps why Jones has resorted to such tactics, not to provoke a response from the All Blacks, but from his own team. The biggest surprise on Tuesday was not that Jones was putting himself up, but putting Farrell up alongside him. The England captain tends to only speak on team announcements and match days, so why was he sitting here in front of the swelling numbers of journalists and broadcasters? To send a message.\n\nJones wanted Farrell to see his little experiment, with the \u201chands up\u201d approach helping to build that siege mentality that Jones so desperately craves for. It was a play straight from the Jose Mourinho playbook, but then Jones has been writing his own version far longer than the Portuguese.\n\nYet Farrell will take that message back to the rest of the squad, and you can bet your bottom yen that the words \u201cno one has given us a chance!\u201d are bellowed inside the England dressing room in those final seconds before Saturday\u2019s match. It is an attempt to lift the pressure on a squad that is facing a World Cup semi-final for the first time in unquestionably the biggest match of their individual and collective careers, and that and only that will give England a fighting chance against the \u2018best in the world\u2019.", "description": "The love-in would never last \u2013 it simply couldn\u2019t.
