There was no immediate word from Saudi Arabia on the reported blast.\n\nState television said the explosion damaged two storerooms aboard the unnamed oil tanker and caused an oil leak into the Red Sea. It did not elaborate.\n\nThe state-run IRNA news agency and others relied on an online news report for their stories, while the semi-official ISNA news agency quoted an anonymous source with direct knowledge of the incident.\n\nAll reports said the reported explosion happened off the coast of Jiddah on the Red Sea.\n\nLt. Pete Pagano, a spokesman for the U.S. Navy\u2019s 5th Fleet overseeing the Mideast, said authorities there were \u201caware of reports of this incident,\u201d but declined to comment further.\n\nThe reported explosion comes after the U.S. has alleged that in past months Iran attacked oil tankers near the Strait of Hormuz, at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, something denied by Tehran.\n\nThe explosion could push tensions between Iran and the U.S. even higher, more than a year after President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew America from the nuclear deal and imposed sanctions now crushing Iran\u2019s economy.\n\nThe mysterious attacks on oil tankers near the Strait of Hormuz, Iran shooting down a U.S. military surveillance drone and other incidents across the wider Middle East followed Trump\u2019s decision.\n\nThe latest assault saw Saudi Arabia\u2019s vital oil industry come under a drone-and-cruise-missile attack, halving the kingdom\u2019s output. The U.S. has blamed Iran for the attack, something denied by Tehran. Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels, whom the kingdom is fighting in a yearslong war, claimed that assault, though analysts say the missiles used in the attack wouldn\u2019t have the range to reach the sites from Yemen.\n\n___\n\nGambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.", "description": "TEHRAN, Iran (AP) \u2014 An explosion damaged an Iranian oil tanker traveling through the Red Sea near Saudi Arabia on Friday, Iranian media reported.
