Lindsey Graham, a top ally of President Donald Trump, is introducing a resolution condemning the Democratic-controlled House's impeachment inquiry. Democrats compared Republican attempts to enter the depositions to \"political theater.\"(Oct. 24) AP Domestic\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump dismissed the need for assembling a team to help in rebuffing Democrats' impeachment inquiry despite multiple reports that allies and some at the White House want such a team.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on the South Lawn Friday, Trump boasted, \"Here's the thing. I don't have teams, everyone's talking about teams. I'm the team. I did nothing wrong.\"\n\nHowever, some allies have been discussing the necessity for the White House to assemble a team to respond to the inquiry as several officials have already testified thus far. Some have provided strong testimony against Trump.\n\nAccording to multiple reports, Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner is seeking someone to put into a chief strategist role that would be solely focused on the Trump administration's response to impeachment.\n\nSome names have been reported to be under consideration, including Tony Sayegh, former top Treasury aide, and Pam Bondi, former Florida Attorney General.\n\nMore: Impeachment: House Judiciary Committee wins court order for grand jury evidence in special counsel Robert Mueller's report\n\nThe inquiry is investigating the president pressuring Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, one of Trump's 2020 Democratic rivals, and his son Hunter, while the United States withheld substantial military aid to the country.\n\nDuring a press conference on Thursday to introduce a resolution condemning how House Democrats have been conducting the impeachment investigation, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he was under the impression the White House was working on assembling a team for messaging surrounding the inquiry.\n\n\u201cI talked to Chief of Staff (Mick) Mulvaney. I think they\u2019re working on getting a messaging team together,\u201d Graham said, pointing to the impeachment of President Bill Clinton in 1998, saying he \u201chad a team that was organized, that had legal minds that could understand what was being said versus the legal proceedings in question, and they were on message every day.\"\n\nMore: Trump Organization considers selling DC hotel at center of ethics complaints\n\n\"President Clinton defended himself, but he never stopped being president,\" Graham added. \"I think one of the reasons he survived is that the public may not have liked what the president had done but believed that he was still able to do his job, and, as he governed during impeachment, I think that was the single best thing he did.\"\n\nAfter Graham\u2019s comment Thursday, White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham told Fox of the inquiry, \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re fighting a ghost. You\u2019re fighting against the air. So we\u2019re doing the best we can. Honestly, messaging isn\u2019t that hard.\"\n\nHowever, last week, the White House chief of staff was unable to nail down a consistent message on the matter.\n\nMulvaney appeared to acknowledge during a televised press conference that aid to Ukraine at the center of the House impeachment inquiry was withheld in part because of the president's desire for the country to investigate potential corruption in U.S. domestic politics. Mulvaney then reversed his position later in the day, blaming the media for misconstruing his words.\n\nTrump\u2019s comment squashing the need for a response team came during a passionate rant against the impeachment investigation, where he consistently reiterated that the phone call between Ukraine\u2019s president and himself was \u201cperfect\u201d, and questioned how Democrats could impeach \"one of the most successful presidents.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/25/impeachment-trump-dismisses-need-inquiry-response-team/2458627001/", "description": "Speaking to reporters Friday, Trump said, \"Here's the thing.
