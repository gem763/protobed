He believed in the promise of America because he had lived it. As chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Reform, he used his gavel to restore integrity, accountability and honesty to Washington so that government would be a force for good for working people, ensuring that all could experience the American Dream as he did.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFirm in his principles, Elijah was also a peacemaker and a bridge-builder: passionate about what he believed in, dispassionate in his judgments about how to proceed. His clarion voice would cut through conflict, calming the waters and reaching out across the aisle, no matter how rough-and-tumble the debate.\n\nHe was a generous leader. He always shared credit and took the time to mentor younger members, both on his committee and throughout our caucus. This year, during the first weeks of the new Congress, when members were being added to his highly coveted committee, he said to me, \u201cSend me as many freshmen as you can.\u201d He wanted to help them succeed \u2014 and he wanted to learn from them, too.\n\nHe was a fighter for U.S. families in many respects, including lowering health-care costs. That was why members decided on the day of his passing to name our prescription drug price legislation H.R. 3, the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act. He was always touched by the stories he heard in his community about the toll that high health-care costs took on families\u2019 economic security and well-being. He also saw this challenge through the prism of his own personal health challenges. Elijah recognized that he had a responsibility to make a difference for others. He understood that to whom much is given, much is expected.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe all saw the great pride he took in representing the Baltimore area. He was truly of Baltimore. As a senior member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, he was always fighting for his district and the state of Maryland, and was a powerful voice for building the infrastructure of the United States to create good-paying jobs. As a member of the U.S. Naval Academy Board of Visitors, he took great pride in Maryland\u2019s role in our national security.\n\nElijah knew that life was fleeting and precious; it was imperative for him to make the most of his time on Earth. Earlier this year, he proclaimed, \u201cWhen we\u2019re dancing with the angels, the question will be asked: In 2019, what did we do to make sure we kept our democracy intact?\u201d\n\nElijah\u2019s leadership truly strengthened America, and his life and legacy will continue to inspire us all to go forth in a way that is worthy of the oath of office that we take to the Constitution, worthy of the vision of our Founders and worthy of the aspirations of our children. For, as he often said, \u201cChildren are the living messengers we send to the future we will never see.\u201d\n\n\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn Congress, we will miss his wisdom, his warm friendship and his great humanity. In Baltimore, we will miss our champion. May it be a comfort to his wife, Maya, his three children and his entire family that so many mourn their loss and are praying for them at this sad time.\n\nGod truly blessed the United States with the life and leadership of Elijah Cummings.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "We have lost a true statesman, orator and a great presence in the House of Representatives.", "authors": ["Nancy Pelosi"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/e_L01hWUSncVrsfWvQUYcEBOQ68=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6QY32IHR4II6TNSIO26PQ3VWPY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
