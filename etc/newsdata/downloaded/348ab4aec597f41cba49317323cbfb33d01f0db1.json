As readers can see, even looking out further than the typical earnings metrics, there is a natural degradation to the earnings data each week.\n\nThis will be the last week of the Q3 \u201919-Q2 \u201920 period. Thus next week, with the quarterly roll, we will be looking at Q4 \u201919-Q3 \u201920 estimates.\n\nS&P 500 earnings data (by the numbers): compliments of IBES by Refinitiv\n\nForward data\n\nFwd 4-qtr est: $170.58 vs last week\u2019s $171.14\n\nFWD PE: 17.4x\n\nFWD PEG: 15.7x\n\nS&P 500 earnings yield: 5.76% vs last week\u2019s 5.72%\n\nY-y growth of fwd est: +1.10% vs 1.22% last week\n\nTrailing data\n\nTTM 4-qtr est/ actual: $153.31 vs $164.44\n\nTTM PE: 18x\n\nTTM PEG: 4.5x\n\nS&P 500 earnings yield: 5.55% vs last week\u2019s 5.50%\n\nY-Y growth of TTM est: 3.82% vs last week\u2019s 4.07%\n\nFrom Chris Kimble, an excellent technician who puts his technical analysis work up on Twitter and LinkedIn (NYSE: ) for all to see.\n\nThis chart scares the crap out of me:\n\nSPX testing 20-year resistance\n\nSummary / conclusion: With just one trading day left in the 3rd quarter of 2019, the numbers (Q2 \u201919 earnings and revenue) are already baked into the market and we now await 3rd quarter, 2019 results due to start on October 10th.\n\nThe \u201cforward 4-quarter\u2019s estimate\u201d is barely showing any growth over the 52 week estimate period prior (see last bullet point of \u201cforward data\u201d), which means Street analysts and strategists have really pulled in their growth expectations. Is it the China tariff headlines that are keeping the Street constrained? Apple\u2019s (NASDAQ: ) outsized influence on Technology (after the spinoff of the Communication Services sector, Apple is now 20% of the weight of the Technology sector and the Tech sector is still the largest sector within the S&P 500 at 20% of the market cap) thus Apple\u2019s iPhone issues are keeping Tech expectations constrained.\n\nThe Fed/FOMC has now cut rates twice in the last 6 weeks and the S&P 500 hasn\u2019t really traded much above its 3,025-3,027 hghs from late July \u201919, with the point being that the S&P 500 is now lower than when the Fed started cutting rates.\n\nMarket breadth and the poor sentiment are allowing the bullish stance to be maintained, given the contrarian nature of sentiment. High yield credit still looks OK too.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry is a new fly in the ointment. I was a kid in the 70\u2019s and heard about Watergate every day. Ultimately I hope the inquiry doesn\u2019t impact the U.S. consumer.", "description": "Stocks Analysis by Brian Gilmartin covering: S&P 500, Apple Inc, LinkedIn Corporation.
