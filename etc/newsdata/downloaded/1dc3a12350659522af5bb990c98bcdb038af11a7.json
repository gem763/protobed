Workers spent an average of 465 minutes checking email in 2016, 352 minutes in 2017 and 360 minutes in 2018.\n\n\"While it's important to note that the time we spend checking email overall has declined since 2016, the frequency remains substantial,\" says Sarah Kennedy, Adobe Vice President of Global Marketing in a statement.\n\nJust 46% of respondents said they are able to clear their inbox.", "description": "Adobe surveyed over 1,000 American workers for their fifth annual email usage study and found that Americans are checking their email while watching TV, in bed, during work meetings, during meals, while driving and even in the bathroom \u2014 but also recognized a growing push to limit the amount of time they check work emails during their personal time.", "authors": ["Abigail Hess"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106141366-1569000263239beardedmanathomeworkingonlaptop.jpg?v=1569014894", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
