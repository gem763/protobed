That is, of course, because the White House\u2019s own summary of Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has Trump directly asking for the \u201cfavor\u201d of looking into Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings there, in implicit exchange for hundreds of millions of dollars in American military aid to Ukraine.\n\nThe anonymous whistle-blower\u2019s complaint alleges that the call was just one part of a long-running campaign by Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to prompt Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. Earlier today, in a phone call with the Atlantic White House reporter Elaina Plott, Giuliani said, \u201cIt is impossible that the whistle-blower is a hero and I\u2019m not. And I will be the hero! These morons\u2014when this is over, I will be the hero.\u201d\n\nWhile Schiff acknowledged that some aspects of the whistle-blower\u2019s accusations have yet to be corroborated, he said, \u201cIn a very substantial part, this whistle-blower has already been found to be credible,\u201d by virtue of the White House\u2019s official record of the call.\n\nRead: Rudy Giuliani: \u2018You should be happy for your country that I uncovered this\u2019\n\nTrump promptly tweeted that \u201cAdam Schiff has zero credibility. Another fantasy to hurt the Republican Party.\u201d But Schiff, whose demeanor is as low-key and unruffled as his convictions are fierce, merely smiled at reporters outside the House hearing room and replied, \u201cI\u2019m always flattered when I\u2019m attacked by someone of the president\u2019s character.\u201d\n\nAll along, first as the committee\u2019s ranking member and then as chairman, after the Democrats won control of the House in last year\u2019s midterm elections, Schiff\u2019s paramount goal has been simple, as he told me just before Mueller testified to his committee in July about his final special-counsel report.\n\n\u201cIt is our hope that we can inform the American people of the full facts, that they can appreciate the degree to which the Russians interfered in a presidential election to help Donald Trump, the degree to which the president welcomed that help, knew it was going on \u2026 and then lied about it and covered it up. And the degree to which those actions and his actions since continue to put us at risk, because it encourages the Russians to get involved again.\u201d\n\nRead: Adam Schiff is back from the wilderness\n\nThat Trump himself is now on record as asking for just that kind of help\u2014albeit from Russia\u2019s bitter adversary, Ukraine\u2014is a plot line almost too perfect to have been made up. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a more serious set of allegations than those contained in the complaint,\u201d Schiff told reporters after the hearing, noting that the president\u2019s actions involved numerous potential offenses, criminal or otherwise.", "description": "The House Intelligence Committee chairman has spent months illuminating Trump\u2019s alleged misdeeds with fruitless results.
