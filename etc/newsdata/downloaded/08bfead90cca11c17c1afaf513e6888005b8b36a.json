As they say, a butterfly flaps its wings in Brazil and there can be a tornado in Houston,\u201d he said.\n\nIssoufou claims he has been slowly driving down his country\u2019s birth rate of more than seven children per woman, the highest birth rate in the world for the past decade.\n\nHe told the Guardian: \u201cBefore Islam came, women used to be married at the age of 18, but due to a misreading of Islam, young women were having babies at the age of 12 or 13. But what does the Qur\u2019an say? If an educated person reads the Qur\u2019an, it talks about responsible parenthood. Islam says you should only have children if you can take good care of them and properly educate them.\n\n\u201cSchools need to educate young girls because we do not want them having children at 12 or 13. Ideally, we want to keep them in school as long as possible, until age 18. This is something new to us.\u201d\n\nHe insists that, in a country that is 98% Muslim, his views do not conflict with imams or religious leaders. Although Issoufou has faced resistance from some muslim leaders for advocating family planning, he insists: \u201cReligious leaders are with us in raising awareness among the people, and that is why we are seeing \u2026 a decrease [in birth rates]\u201d.\n\nWith the spread of contraception and family planning schools for men, the birth rate has slowly declined to about six children per woman, but more needs to be done, the president said. The last official figures from the World Bank in 2016 put the rate at 7.2 children per woman.\n\nNiger\u2019s population stood at 8 million in 1990 and reached 22.4 million in 2018. \u201cWe have a 4% annual increase in population,\u201d said Issoufou. \u201cThe population will double in the next 17 years. By 2050 we may have the second biggest population in Africa apart from Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIt is a continent-wide phenomenon, he said. \u201cIn Africa there are 1.3 billion people today \u2026 [there will be] 2.4 billion by 2050. That means 30 million young people per year entering the labour market. If we do nothing to keep people in Africa by creating jobs domestically, there will be a huge wave of migration as people look for jobs elsewhere.\u201d\n\nHe knows the scale of migration from Niger \u2013 one of the poorest countries in the world \u2013 depends on how the climate crisis progresses, but Issoufou warned that the Sahel will be one of the main contributors to the predicted 230m migrants by 2050, a figure he points out will be far larger than the mass migration caused by the second world war.\n\n\u201cIn Niger we are already living with the practical results of climate change. Floods alternating with droughts [are] already having huge consequences on agricultural production. There is a degradation of soil, forests are getting lost, there is less land, and an advance of the desert. Lake Chad has lost as much as 90% of its water, and there are more problems with domestic rivers. Niger loses 100,000 hectares (250 acres) of agricultural land every year,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe people of Niger may not fully understand the causes of this, but they are experiencing it in their daily lives. They do know there is a link between degradation of soil and their poverty. The world worries about a rise of two degrees, but we have already experienced that increase since the 60s.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThere is a growing risk of anger across Africa as the people come to realise the root cause of this evil. As people come to understand the causes of climate change, it could lead to the finding of solutions, but equally it may lead to anger and social turmoil.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose least responsible for the climate change suffer its worst consequences. The situation is not helped when industrialised nations do not always deliver on their promises.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Issoufou was involved in the launch of a $400bn (\u00a3311bn) climate investment plan for the Sahel region.\n\nThe precise extent to which climate change and demography in Africa could lead to migration into Europe is disputed, with most saying it will lead mainly to internal migration within Africa. A World Bank report last year claimed that if no action is taken, sub-Saharan Africa may have as many as 86 million internal climate migrantsby 2050.\n\nIssoufou argues that much depends on Africa\u2019s ability to find jobs for this new labour force, which in turn hangs on the continent\u2019s ability to grow in the model of Asian economies, and to integrate economically.\n\nAs chair of the Economic Community of West African States, Issoufou has been involved in plans to build a pan-African free trade zone of 1.2 billion people, now supported by 54 African states. He said the aim is to end what he describes as \u201cthe Balkanisation of the continent by colonialists\u201d.\n\nThe free trade zone came into force this summer, and Issoufou now talks of \u201cmarching boldly\u201d towards a single currency for Africa, a plan that may meet widespread resistance.\n\nUnlike Asia, he argued, \u201cAfrica had remained chained in the colonial pact, that is to say supplier of raw materials and consumer of finished products manufactured elsewhere. She remains a victim of unequal exchange.\u201d\n\nHis critics claim Issoufou has become a victim of an unequal exchange himself. In 2015, Niger \u2013 at the EU\u2019s request \u2013 became the first country to criminalise people-smuggling, a move that has badly disrupted the hidden economy of the north.\n\nThe EU gave Niger \u20ac610 (\u00a3526) to police what has effectively become Africa\u2019s new border with Europe in the wake of the collapse of Libya.\n\nThe aim was to slow the flow of migrants into Libya which led to mass migration across the Mediterranean into Italy, peaking in 2017, and prompting the rise of the populist right. One issue with the approach is whether those who have been forced out of smuggling have received the EU aid designed to give them a different way of life.\n\nIssoufou makes no apology for being the gendarmerie of illegal migration. \u201cI am not prepared to see Africans die in transit in the heat of the Sahara or exploited by smuggling rings,\u201d he said.\n\nEuropean lectures on the consequences of the Libyan intervention do not impress him. He first heard about the fateful Franco-British intervention of Libya in 2011 on the radio. \u201cIt has left us in a state close to chaos ever since.\u201d", "description": "Mahamadou Issoufou calls for \u2018responsible parenthood\u2019 as he warns population boom will undermine climate adaptation", "authors": ["Patrick Wintour"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/024d1060c0e44e040fa378269b7f91df6354421b/0_161_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=81e56428d1c4687ba226539635f79a8d", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
