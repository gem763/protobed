Indian Oil uses single-use plastic waste to build road:\n\nDon't Miss 123 SHARES 11 K SHARES\n\nIndian Oil has joined hands to help dispose of single-use plastic. The research department of the oil company has carried out tests to make roads with bituminous concrete mixed with single-use plastic waste. According to its analysis, the waste plastic roads have the advantages of higher strength and increased durability. They also allow lesser rain water seepage.\n\nA pilot project has reportedly been carried out in its Faridabad office and Indian Oil may soon come up with large scale projects on similar lines.\n\n2. NHAI to focus on using plastic waste to build highways:\n\nThe National Highway Authority of India, which comes under the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, has reportedly encouraged the use of waste plastic in construction of National Highways, especially in those areas that are located within 50 km of urban cities that have a population of 5 lakh or more. Highly populated urban areas are likely to generate maximum plastic waste and therefore NHAI aims to use them in construction of roads that are near to these locations. It has already used plastic waste in pilot basis in the states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala, and may soon expand to other regions.\n\n3. Cement firm to use plastic waste for fuel in Meghalaya\n\nThe Meghalaya government has reportedly signed an agreement with a major cement firm. This understanding is for buying plastic waste which will in turn be used as fuel instead of coal. Chief Minister Conrad K. Sangma had made this announcement during an official programme to mark the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in the State capital Shillong. \u201cWe have had an understanding with one of the cement companies which will use the plastic as raw material to burn and produce energy from it. It will be a process very much within the control limits of the pollution board,\u201d Mr Sangma had said.\n\n4. India's first plastic to diesel conversion plant in Mathura\n\nThe country's first plastic to diesel conversion plant in Mathura was inaugurated by MP and actress Hema Malini on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti. A model of this plant had reportedly been placed for a demonstration before the prime minister when he had arrived in Mathura. This model is now working on a full scale at the Mathura Municipal Corporation's (MMC) trenching grounds.\n\n5. Machine to make tiles from plastic waste in Rudrapur\n\nThe Uttarakhand state government has reportedly installed a recycling machine at one of its facilities in Udham Singh Nagar\u2019s Rudrapur, to convert polluting items such as polythene, plastic cans, plastic bottles, disposable glasses etc. into interlocking tiles. These will then be used to construct roads. The initiative was taken under the Swajal project of the department of drinking water supply.\n\n6. Ravana effigies made of plastic waste to be disposed of mechanically\n\nThis Dussehra, there will be several Ravana effigies, including in Delhi, made of plastic waste collected from cities across India, reported PTI. The apex body of cement plants in India on Friday announced that in collaboration with the Ministry of Jal Shakti and the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, it will be erecting huge Ravanas made of plastic waste in a few cities for the festival of Dussehra on October 8.\n\n\"The intent is to personify Ravana in its plastic form as a demon, bad for the society and environment. This initiative also highlights the role that the Cement Industry can play in, helping overcome this menace in its plants in an environmentally friendly manner,\" a statement issued by the Cement Manufacturers Association (CMA) said.", "description": "It has been some time since PM Narendra Modi brought the issue of single-use plastic into the limelight in India and urged the citizens to shun its use and ensure that plastic waste is disposed off in a manner that it does not have an adverse impact on the environment.", "authors": ["Saket Suman"], "top_image": "https://media.indiatimes.in/media/facebook/2019/Oct/plastic_1570436531_800x420.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
