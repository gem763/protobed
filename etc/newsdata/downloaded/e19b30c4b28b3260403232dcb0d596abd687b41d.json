Such age should be an advantage in giving a new energy, new ideas, positive outlook and telling people what the new generations really want.\u201d\n\nZhang also appealed to the club\u2019s fans to give time to new coach Antonio Conte.\n\n\u201cWe can aim for the best but, at the same time, I hope fans, the public have some patience for our players, our coach and everyone in the club, because a lot of people are new and we need some time,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI understand fans want to win the league and the Champions League, but everyone else wants to do that, all the clubs want to do that. A lot of our players are actually very young and it\u2019s important to let them work and, eventually in the next year, I am sure they will deliver the results.\u201d\n\nThree-times European champions Inter have won 18 Serie A titles and the Coppa Italia seven times but have struggled since winning a Champions League, Serie A and Coppa Italia treble under coach Jose Mourinho in 2010.\n\nConte is the 13th coach since then and replaced Luciano Spalletti, who was sacked at the end of last season despite leading Inter into the Champions League.", "description": "Inter Milan president Steven Zhang believes his youth will help bring new energy and new ideas to his club and help them understand how people of his generation watch football.", "authors": ["Brian Homewood", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
