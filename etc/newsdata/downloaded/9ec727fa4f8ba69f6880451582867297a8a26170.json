How the disorder results in pelvic pain and internal scarring Endometriosis is an often painful disorder in which tissue similar to the lining of the uterus - the endometrium - grows outside the uterus. It most commonly affects the ovaries, Fallopian tubes and the tissue lining the pelvis. The primary symptom of endometriosis is pelvic pain although many women also experience cramping during their menstrual cycle. Symptoms also include painful periods, pain with intercourse, pain with bowel movements or urination, inflammation, excessive bleeding and infertility. Often misdiagnosed, many women only discover they have the condition during infertility treatment. Approximately half of women diagnosed with endometriosis have difficulty getting pregnant. While studies about the link between endometriosis and miscarriages are still ongoing, newer research suggests that the condition can leave sufferers at greater risk of having a miscarriage.
