Jess Baylon, the town\u2019s police chief, told The Philippine Daily Inquirer in an interview. \u201cIt was literally a string.\u201d\n\nThe micro bikinis (although \u201cmicro\u201d almost makes them sound too big) shocked residents and tourists so much that the authorities tracked down the Taiwanese woman, whom they learned was staying at a hotel in the island\u2019s Station 1.\n\nShe was urged to come to the police station yesterday afternoon and showed up with her boyfriend and a hotel worker in tow. She didn\u2019t apologize for her attire, however, and instead told the cops that there was nothing wrong with the dental-floss she was sporting, adding that the garments, such as they are, were comfortable and a \u201cform of expression,\u201d according to Radyo Inquirer.\n\nBaylon, however, dismissed her explanations. He told Panay News, \u201c[M]aybe it is her way of expressing how they appreciate the beauty of the island and the beauty of her body. But in our conservative culture, it is unacceptable.\u201d\n\nBaylon also noted that, based on his own observations and years of investigative experience, the woman probably works as a model.\n\nBoracay does not prohibit the wearing of skimpy attire, so the Taiwanese tourist was ordered to pay a fine of PHP2,500 (US$48.52) for purportedly violating an ordinance that forbids the taking and display of lewd photographs \u2014 though, it would sort of appear to us that all those other busybodies were the ones taking the lewd photos.\n\nNonetheless, she will not be allowed to leave the island today if she does not pay the fine.\n\nFind all episodes of The Coconuts Podcast\n\nThis article, Itsy-Bitsy, Teenie-Weenie: Taiwanese tourist fined for wearing micro bikini in Boracay, originally appeared on Coconuts, Asia's leading alternative media company.
