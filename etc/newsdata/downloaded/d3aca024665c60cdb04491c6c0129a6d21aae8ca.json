And she said, \u2018If you\u2019re that way inclined, please say a little prayer for us,\u2019 and it got a bit emotional as everyone started clapping.\u201d\n\nKaye recalled that the pilot then made an announcement as soon as the plane landed, saying, \u201cThat\u2019s the end of our dream.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd he mentioned how staff wouldn\u2019t be getting paid, so he asked us to thank the rest of the crew,\u201d Kaye said.\n\n\u201cThen, everyone clapped again, and staff were in tears and thanking the passengers for making it a nice flight,\u201d she said. \u201cBut towards the end of the journey, passengers had started a little collection, but it ended being quite a big collection.\u201d\n\nKaye noted that \u201ceveryone was putting in their remaining dollars, and I think there was two bags going around, so it turned out to be a lot of the money.\u201d\n\nThe flight crew thanked the passengers over the plane\u2019s intercom.\n\nAlso see: Thomas Cook\u2019s liquidation wipes out travel company worth \u00a31.85 billion just 18 months ago\n\nRelated: These brilliant posters tell the tale of Thomas Cook\u2019s storied 178-year history\n\n\u201cIt was really emotional, passengers were crying.
