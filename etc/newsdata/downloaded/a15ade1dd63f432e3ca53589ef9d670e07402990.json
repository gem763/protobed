But she does sit in the Commons - and her looks often give her away.\n\nNone so much as her icy thousand-yard stare to Ian Blackford, one of the MPs complaining her deal was better than what's now on offer.\n\n(Image: UK PARLIAMENT/AFP via Getty Imag)\n\nThe SNP Westminster leader said: \" The Prime Minister has returned from Brussels to present a deal that we all know is actually worse than Theresa May \u2019s deal.\n\n\"It is a deal that would see Scotland shafted by this United Kingdom Government and left at an economic disadvantage.\n\n\"With Scotland\u2019s views and interests totally disregarded by this Prime Minister and his Government.\"\n\nShe didn't say anything - but boy, did she glower.\n\n(Image: UK PARLIAMENT/AFP via Getty Imag)\n\nThere are several reasons why MPs are saying Boris Johnson's deal - which is 64 pages of amendments to Theresa May's - is worse.\n\nMr Johnson won a victory by getting rid of the 'Irish backstop', which would have trapped the whole of the UK inside EU customs rules indefinitely.\n\nBut in return, he's had to set up what the DUP say is effectively a customs border down the Irish Sea - splitting Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK.\n\nThat's because although legally the customs border is between Northern Ireland and the Republic, in practice, customs checks will happen when goods arrive by sea or air.\n\nMeanwhile Northern Ireland will also share some EU single market rules with the Republic, forcing more checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea.\n\nAnd the DUP will not get a veto over these arrangements - they would last until 2025 at least, and then continue if backed by a simple majority in the Northern Ireland Assembly.\n\n(Image: UK PARLIAMENT/AFP via Getty Imag)\n\n(Image: UK PARLIAMENT/AFP via Getty Imag)\n\nIt came as Parliament sat on a Saturday for the first time since 1982 to approve or reject Boris Johnson \u2019s Brexit deal.\n\nAt the same time, tens or hundreds of thousands of protesters were set to descend on Westminster demanding a second referendum \u2013 a \u201cPeople\u2019s Vote\u201d.\n\nBut the vote risked becoming a total damp squib after MP Oliver Letwin tabled an amendment that will force a delay, win or lose - and put off the final decision until later.\n\nThat prompted No10 to threaten to pull or sit out the vote to avoid handing a symbolic victory to the expelled Tory and his Labour allies.\n\nToday\u2019s vote was already on a knife edge as victory hinged on just a few Labour MPs in Leave seats.\n\nLast night Boris Johnson unveiled a last-minute offer on workers\u2019 rights after his deal watered them down. But it was slammed by Labour\u2019s leadership and the TUC as not worth the paper it\u2019s written on.\n\nBoris Johnson began speaking in the Commons at 9.30am with the final vote expected this afternoon.", "description": "You probably don't feel much pity for her - but you can kind of see how she feels", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Image", "Uk Parliament Afp Via Getty Imag"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20653088.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Screen-Shot-2019-10-19-at-121906.png", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
