With Maggie distraught and feeling she\u2019s lost her husband, she has been confiding in Roo (Georgie Parker) about how she wishes she could help \u2013 so Roo decides to pitch in with her own efforts.\n\nAlf (Ray Meagher) is trying to get Ben to interact more and asks him over for dinner. As it will only be them and Roo, Ben is eventually persuaded. However, when Alf texts Roo the update, she decides to invite Maggie \u2013 without telling her Ben will be there.\n\nBen and Alf are taken aback to find Maggie with Roo when she shows up. Alf scolds Roo outside before the meal progresses and reaches multiple awkward points. Roo tries to make small talk, but Ben hasn\u2019t been keeping up with life in the Bay and all this does is make him more aware of the fact he\u2019s been absent from his loved ones\u2019 lives.\n\nRoo tries to get involved (Picture: Channel 5)\n\nMaggie becomes painfully aware of the tension and asks Roo how Irene (Lynne McGranger) is doing. Unfortunately, Roo doesn\u2019t think about Ben\u2019s own case and goes on for some time about how hard it is for Irene to sit in limbo with a conviction hanging over her head.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Alf points out Ben is also in limbo, Maggie turns to the wine, and it isn\u2019t long before everyone calls it a night. Ben offers to drive a drunk Maggie home, but once they arrive, she desperately tries to get him to stay.\n\nBen begins to think the entire night was a charade to lure him back to the house. He rejects her and walks away. The next morning, Maggie approaches him and says the night before wasn\u2019t an effort to get him into bed. But Ben says he doesn\u2019t want to pretend everything is OK \u2013 and she needs to leave him alone to sort things out\u2026\n\nMORE: Home and Away spoilers: Jasmine is kidnapped and Scott is stabbed in terrifying scenes\n\nMORE: Home and Away spoilers: Sudden shock as Raffy plans to leave the Bay\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Roo gets involved with Ben and Maggie's marriage, despite Alf telling her not to.", "authors": ["Imogen Groome"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/EP-7210-Ben-s-R.NICHOL-mood-hasn-t-improved-and-he-s-annoyed-by-Maggie-K.MORASSI-inquiring-about-the-case_HAA-1442_0535-6020_1571990089.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
