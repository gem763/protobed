Researchers tested both niche brands and widely available brands, such as Gerber \u2014 which told MarketWatch the report \u201cmay have caused unnecessary alarm about the safety of foods for children.\u201d\n\nPast research has linked the four metals with harm to the brain, among other health consequences, according to Healthy Babies Bright Futures. The organization is an alliance of scientists and public health nonprofit organizations that are focused on ending young children\u2019s exposure to chemicals that can impair development.\n\nOther studies have uncovered heavy metals in baby foods, like one in 2017, which found lead in 20% of some 2,000 baby food samples.\n\nGerber and Beech-Nut defended the safety of their products\n\nA spokeswoman for Gerber\u2019s parent company, Nestle NSRGY, -0.49%, told MarketWatch \u201ctrace amounts\u201d of elements like arsenic and lead occur naturally.\n\nFor that reason, she said \u201cmany food safety and agricultural experts suggest that it is not feasible to achieve a \u201czero\u201d level of these elements \u2014 even in homemade foods made from organic ingredients.\u201d\n\nThe company prides itself on strict adherence to food safety, said spokeswoman Kelly Schneider. \u201cWe want to reassure parents that Gerber never compromises on the safety or quality of our foods. We are committed in partnership with our suppliers, growers, and manufacturing team to minimize heavy metal levels to as low as possible.\u201d\n\nBeech-Nut Nutrition said in a statement that its products \u201care dependably safe, healthy and nutritious,\u201d noting it tests for 255 contaminants including lead, other heavy metals and pesticides. Some of the Healthy Babies Bright Futures recommendations \u201csupport what we\u2019ve been doing at Beech-Nut for years, including being selective in sourcing and conducting rigorous testing.\u201d\n\n\u2018Sub-trace levels\u2019 of chrysotile asbestos were found in Johnson & Johnson baby powder\n\nThe baby powder recall and the Healthy Babies Bright Futures report amount to distressing news for parents, especially if they don\u2019t have the time to make their own baby food or sort through which baby powders to use.\n\nJohnson & Johnson JNJ, -6.22% said it was initiating the voluntary recall of a single lot \u2014 about 33,000 bottles \u2014 after a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) test showed \u201csub-trace levels of chrysotile asbestos contamination\u201d from one baby powder bottle purchased online.\n\nJohnson & Johnson said it couldn\u2019t confirm whether the results were a false positive, or whether the sample came from a genuine Johnson & Johnson bottle or a counterfeit.\n\n\u201cThousands of tests over the past 40 years repeatedly confirm that our consumer talc products do not contain asbestos,\u201dJohnson & Johnson said in a statement. The company is fending off at least 13,000 lawsuits alleging that baby powder and other talc-containing products cause cancer. The company says its products are safe and don\u2019t cause cancer. It is appealing verdicts against the company and has won several lawsuits in state courts, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nThe FDA said it took the Johnson & Johnson baby powder sample as it continues to search for asbestos in cosmetic products. It tested Johnson & Johnson baby powder from different lot and the results were negative.\n\nEarlier this year, the FDA found asbestos in children\u2019s makeup products.\n\nHow parents can take action\n\nThere are few federal guidelines about what\u2019s considered a safe amount of heavy metals in baby food, the Healthy Babies Bright Futures report noted. Eighty-eight percent of the tested foods lacked federal rules or guidance on maximum safe levels, according to the report.\n\nThe FDA needs to both create new standards for foods with rules on heavy metal amounts and toughen existing standards too, said Healthy Babies Bright Futures. Companies have already reduced arsenic contaminants amounts in rice cereal and juice by following a FDA guidance, it noted.\n\nThe organization is calling for action from government officials and baby food companies, but there are steps parents can take too:\n\n\u2022 Feed babies rice-free snacks and oatmeal instead of puffs and rice cereal. Rice can absorb arsenic, a naturally-occurring element, as it grows.\n\n\u2022 Let babies gnaw on frozen bananas and chilled cucumbers instead of teething biscuits.\n\n\u2022 Serve tap water instead of fruit juice.\n\n\u2022 Feed their child a range of fruits and vegetables.\n\nOther pediatric experts have also said mixing up a baby\u2019s diet is a good way to minimize exposure to contaminants in food.\n\nIn reaction to the Healthy Babies Bright Futures report, the FDA also advised parents vary the food in their child\u2019s diet.\n\nA spokesman said the agency\u2019s work \u201cincludes actively monitoring the levels of arsenic, lead and other elements in foods and working to identify the most effective and feasible ways to reduce exposure to these elements from food. The recent report by Healthy Babies Bright Futures underscores the importance of our continued work in this area.\u201d\n\nThe spokesman continued, \u201cWhile we have seen progress in this area, more work can be done to further decrease exposures to arsenic and lead from foods.\u201d\n\nHe said parents should \u201ccontinue to feed their babies and children an age appropriate, varied, well balanced diet for nutrition and food safety. The FDA is committed to working with stakeholders in industry and in advocacy, to continue to reduce exposure to these elements.\u201d\n\nShares of Johnson & Johnson have been down 2.95% over the past three months, compared to a 1.4% decline for the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.95% and a .06% drop for the S&P 500 Index SPX, -0.39% .", "description": "Gerber says a report about arsenic in baby food \u2018may have caused unnecessary alarm.\u2019", "authors": ["Andrew Keshner"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT635_baby_e_ZG_20191018142935.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
