Fewer local plants went extinct. The plant richness \u2014 the number of species \u2014 swelled each year. After 18 years, an average of 24 more plant species grew in connected habitats vs. disconnected fragments, an increase of 14 percent.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere are several efforts around the world to stitch habitat fragments together. One international re-wilding program, the Yellowstone to Yukon Conservation Initiative, has been working since 1993 to strengthen connections between wild landscapes from northern Canada to the U.S. Rocky Mountains.\n\nPast research shows that corridors \u201care superhighways for plants and animals,\u201d Haddad said. Birds zigzag through corridors with the energy of pinballs, he said, eating and defecating seeds. Butterflies and bees follow corridors and spread pollen. Seeds ride the winds that blow through corridors like gusts between tall buildings.\n\nUntil this study, most corridor experiments measured biodiversity and extinction on small scales. Andrew Gonzalez, a conservation biologist at Quebec\u2019s McGill University who was not involved with the South Carolina experiment, observed that declines in insect populations stopped when he connected the patches of moss they lived on. The new research \u201cadds great value to previous findings from connectivity experiments,\u201d Gonzalez said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSharon Collinge, who studies landscape ecology at the University of Colorado at Boulder and was not a part of this current research, agreed. \u201cThis is really the first to demonstrate this so clearly\u201d \u2014 that corridors work \u2014 \u201cfor an experiment at this spatial scale and this temporal scale,\u201d she said.\n\nThe study took place at the Savannah River Site, where the Department of Energy creates tritium gas for weapons in its nuclear facilities. Vast tracts of a timber plantation managed by the Forest Service surround the buildings.\n\nFew plants grow beneath the timber trees\u2019 dense canopy. Spongy mats of pine needles, up to a foot thick, cover the forest floor. \u201cI might see zero species in the understory,\u201d said study author Ellen Damschen, an ecosystem ecologist at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. \u201cMaybe one or two.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBefore the arrival of European settlers, longleaf pine savanna covered this land. It burned regularly, and the flames \u2014 high enough to lick trunks but rarely singeing the treetops \u2014 cleared space for perennial herbs and grasses. Trees were present but not densely packed. Dozens of different plant species grew within each square meter. Red-cockaded woodpeckers, gopher tortoises and other animals that are now rare or endangered once thrived in the savanna.\n\nDamschen, Haddad and their colleagues studied 2.5-acre squares of restored longleaf pine savanna, as big as city blocks. In 10 cases, they constructed corridors of savanna, 500 feet long by 80 feet wide, between the plots. Viewed from above, the connected habitats have the outline of giant barbell weights.\n\nForest Service workers mimic the past by frequently setting the area on fire. The restored habitats are full of butterflies, vibrant flowers and other \u201cfascinations of the natural world,\u201d Haddad said, in contrast to the monotony of the pine plantation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor 18 years, the scientists counted each plant they saw within restored habitats, totaling 200 species. \u201cWe are able to count each individual species and whether or not we see it in a given year in a given patch type,\u201d Damschen said. Using these plant censuses, the scientists were able to determine the likelihood a given species would arrive in a patch or go extinct.\n\nThe study authors found rates of plant extinction were reduced by 2 percent annually in the connected habitats, compared with isolated patches. Newcomers took root and grew, too. The colonization of new plant species shot up by 5 percent per year.\n\nThe percent changes may seem small, \u201cbut the important point is that these rates are on an annual basis,\u201d Damschen said, \u201cjust like your bank account, with an annual rate of interest.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThese boons to biodiversity, to the researchers\u2019 surprise, persisted for the duration of the study. The scientists do not know when the effects will cease. They continue to study these plots.\n\n\u201cThe longer it runs, the greater the contribution it makes to our knowledge of ecological connectivity,\u201d Gonzalez said.\n\nThe study authors controlled for factors like area and the amount of edge surrounding a habitat, including comparisons plots attached to half-corridors that led nowhere. The 10 barbell-shape habitats were oriented in different directions and separated by large distances. Strict security measures, because of the nearby nuclear facilities, prevented any public interference. \u201cWe\u2019re really able to say: \u2018Yes, this is a consistent pattern,\u2019 \u201d Damschen said.\n\nAD\n\nGiven the clarity and consistency of these results, Collinge said she would be comfortable applying this work to other sorts of habitats. \u201cFor plant species in forested landscapes, this is really robust,\u201d she said.\n\nAD\n\nHaddad agreed. \u201cI think our results are general across systems,\u201d he said, having created a model for wherever \u201csuitable native habitat is surrounded by unsuitable nonnative habitat.\u201d\n\nThese results, the scientists said, support policies promoting connectivity. In 2016, the governors of the six New England states and the premiers of the provinces in eastern Canada signed a resolution promoting ecological connectivity among their forests. The 2018 Farm Bill expands support for corridors \u2014 such as prairie strips \u2014 in agricultural land.\n\nAD\n\nPlants and wildlife aren\u2019t the only ones to benefit from corridors, Haddad said. Humans can, too. Buffers that run along rivers prevent pollution from entering waterways. Prairie strips prevent erosion offer habitat to native insects that pollinate crops. Urban greenways draw bikers, birders and other nature enthusiasts.\n\nGiven the long-running effects of connectivity shown in this research, Gonzalez said, the sooner habitats are connected, the better off they can be.\n\nRead more:\n\nNorth America has lost 3 billion birds in 50 years\n\nClimate change could render many of Earth\u2019s ecosystems unrecognizable\n\nScientists look to revive the long-extinct passenger pigeon\n\nAD", "description": "A study of habitat connections in South Carolina provides the \"best scientific evidence that corridors work as they are intended.\"", "authors": ["Ben Guarino", "Reporter Covering The Practice", "Culture Of Science"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/cMOfPjON9v-GwzPKOx7X99_21e0=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/09-24-2019/t_4ac4a540c91e464e9b07c4ae4e4dc736_name_1___1920x1080___30p_00_00_28_06_Still017.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
