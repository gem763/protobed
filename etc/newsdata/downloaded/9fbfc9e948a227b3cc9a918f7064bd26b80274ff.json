Unlike its main private sector competitors Telstra and Optus, it has no mobile infrastructure business and has given up growing its NBN retail business because it is unprofitable.\n\n\"As the operator of a major fibre network, Vocus has earned the right to call out a shift in the market which could be causing infrastructure investors to reconsider how they allocate their capita,\" Mr Mansfield said.\n\n\"Taking a long-term view, do we really want a market where we discourage infrastructure competition?\"\n\n\"This is not just a Vocus issue, this is an issue that affects the whole industry. Now is the time for the government to clarify both the policy settings, and enforcement of those settings, that will give private investors certainty that they can build new infrastructure without worrying that it may be overbuilt and de-valued by a taxpayer-subsidised competitor.\n\nTumultuous year\n\nVocus is the fourth-biggest enterprise fibre player in Australia with an 8 per cent market share. Telstra commands 61 per cent of the market, followed by Optus with 16 per cent, and TPG with 11 per cent, according to equity research firm Jefferies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVocus specialises in connecting office buildings in the major cities, where it is profitable to roll out fibre connecting its national network to the basements of those buildings, usually using Telstra's ducts.\n\nBut enterprise competitors fear NBN Co enters the market with one huge advantage: its enormous residential fibre network, which by the middle of next year will reach most neighbourhoods across Australia. That means businesses outside the major CBDs will find it much cheaper to connect to the NBN's network than to any of the other telcos' networks.\n\nLast financial year, NBN Co generated $388 million from its enterprise operations, up more than 50 per cent on the previous year. By 2023 it hopes to be generating $1.2 billion. Vocus last year generated recurring revenue of $590 million from its enterprise government and wholesale business.\n\nMr Mansfield's comments come at the end of a tumultuous year for Vocus, during which two potential suitors \u2013 AGL and private equity investor EQT \u2013 independently made generous provisional offers to acquire the company, only to withdraw the offers when Vocus opened its books.\n\nThis prompted speculation that they had seen something not visible to the market, speculation Vocus management rejected.\n\n\"The bidders decided that whilst our assets and the market opportunity were very attractive, they could not balance the execution risk at this relatively early stage of the turn around with integrating these assets into their own business models,\" Mr Mansfield said on Tuesday.\n\n\"I do want to emphasise that the company was not, and is not, for sale.", "description": "Bob Mansfield has warned the government it must clarify the rules governing NBN Co's behaviour in the enterprise market or risk future investment from the private sector.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.6444%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_3%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/3ce78dd19b83e09aceb498448ef1843caf7f2588", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
