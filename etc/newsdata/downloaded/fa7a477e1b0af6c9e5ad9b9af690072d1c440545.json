They will then hold rolling strikes from 30 September in the form of one week on strike, one week off.\n\nThe workers' union, the PCS, set up a food bank for staff inside the department's Victoria Street offices at one point.\n\nBEIS said it valued all of its staff and its priority was \"to ensure they receive a fair wage... whether directly employed or working for our contractors.\u201d\n\nISS said the dispute predated it taking over the contract at BEIS and that it offered a \"median rate\" of pay for each profession.
