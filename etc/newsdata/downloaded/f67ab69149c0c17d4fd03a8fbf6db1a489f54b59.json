Labour\u2019s current position is that it would try to renegotiate a new Brexit deal if it formed a government, then put that to a second referendum with the options on the ballot paper being to remain in the EU or accept the new deal.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Emily Thornberry is among shadow cabinet members who said they would vote to remain.

Corbyn has not said how he would campaign or whether the party would officially take a side.\n\nWhile the nuanced position aims to accommodate both Remain and Leave voters, and is backed by several unions, there are signs of a growing grassroots revolt in favour of an unambiguous commitment to remain. Motions to the conference have already been submitted by more than 60 local branches calling on Corbyn to drop his plan to renegotiate and to commit to staying in the EU in all circumstances. The NEC will meet on Tuesday to discuss Brexit and how to handle the issue at conference.\n\nLast year, the subject dominated Labour\u2019s conference in Liverpool. Eventually the party emerged with a fudged position under which it agreed to keep the idea of a second referendum on the table, if it could not force an early general election.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The 2018 Labour conference in Liverpool fudged the Brexit issue.

Further, the economic effects of Brexit have already, and will continue, to increase the problems our constituents face and the barriers councils face in delivering local public services, including fighting the climate emergency.\n\n\u201cAny form of Brexit threatens jobs, workers\u2019 rights, migrants, the NHS, public health, public services and the environment, and will make it harder to deliver a radical Labour manifesto. Ending austerity, expanding common ownership, fixing the social care system, and delivering a national education service will be hindered by any form of Brexit. If we leave the EU, we face years of negotiations and neoliberal trade deals.\u201d\n\nIn an email to his Newcastle East constituents, the MP Nick Brown said: \u201cI am a moderate Remainer and have consistently believed that continued membership of the EU is in the national interest. I also believe it is in the overwhelming interest of the north-east of England. Therefore in such a confirmatory ballot, as in the 2016 referendum, I would campaign and vote to remain in the EU.\u201d\n\nAt its conference, which opened in Bournemouth last night, the Liberal Democrat party will vote on whether to support revoking article 50 without a referendum if it forms the next government. In the latest Opinium/Observer poll, the Conservatives are up 2 points compared to a week ago on 37%, while Labour is unchanged on 24% and the Lib Dems are down one point on 16%. The Brexit party is unchanged on 13%.\n\nA Labour party spokesperson said policy on Brexit would not be decided by the NEC and added: \u201cLabour\u2019s priority is to stop a disastrous no-deal Brexit. We can\u2019t trust Boris Johnson to not crash us out of Europe on the worst possible terms.\u201d", "description": "Grassroots leaders call for a decisive stance to stay in EU and deliver a radical new manifesto", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6aed931bc57a117d840ccdf9fde6e48ec0b4502/0_107_5176_3106/master/5176.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d730d7c393f4c2edffa04b4e9974cd66", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
