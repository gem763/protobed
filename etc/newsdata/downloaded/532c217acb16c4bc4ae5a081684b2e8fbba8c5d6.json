(annually) in GVA (gross value added) for the UK economy,\" said the report, published in partnership with the City of London Corporation.\n\nThe global maritime services market is estimated to be worth $20 billion annually.\n\n\"Significant ground has been lost to international competitors in recent years. Competitors such as the U.S., China, Norway and particularly Singapore, are all challenging in key areas of development and we must react,\" said Harry Theochari, chair of the separate Maritime UK body.\n\nThe report, launched at the start of London International Shipping Week, comes as Britain spins toward an election. Brexit remains up in the air, more than three years after Britons voted to leave the European Union. Options range from a turbulent \"no-deal\" exit to abandoning the whole endeavor.\n\nThe report's authors said their interviews with maritime services professionals \"offered mixed views on the impact of Brexit on the UK\u2019s perception as a politically stable country\".\n\n\"Some pointed to opportunities to reduce regulation post-Brexit, while others expressed concerns about the availability of talent and the perception of the UK as \u2018open for business\u2019,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe exodus from shipping finance by many leading lenders including Britain's Royal Bank of Scotland (L: ) and Lloyds (L: ) had affected London's position as a money destination for international shipping firms, the report said.\n\nSeparately, Britain's decision to scrap tax breaks for long-term residents who claim \"non-domicile\" status led to the departure of prominent Greek players from London in recent years.\n\n\"The UK needs to be more active in courting ship owners and other industry participants to come here,\" the report said.\n\n\"It is also vital that post-Brexit, the UK remains open and welcoming to foreign talent.\"\n\nThe report said the UK maintained 25% of the maritime services market. It recommended more efforts to bring dual listings to the London Stock Exchange to boost capital markets activity for shipping as well as taking a lead in developing environmental finance products, while providing tax incentives.\n\n\"What\u2019s critical is that we work to strengthen the core of ship owners and charterers in the UK, which will provide a significant boost to the UK economy,\" Maritime UK's Theochari said.", "description": "Britain at risk of losing leading edge in maritime services", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXNPEF8711M_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
