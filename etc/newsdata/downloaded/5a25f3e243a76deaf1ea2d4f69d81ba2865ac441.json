Unfortunately, the nursery is not able to be open to make sure there is childcare provided for honourable members.\n\n\"Would it not be incumbent upon IPSA to make financial provision so the cost of childcare can at least be met for members?\"\n\nNormally, MPs sit in London during the week and return to their constituencies for the weekend.\n\nThe basic annual salary for an MP is \u00a379,468. MPs also receive expenses to cover the costs of running an office, employing staff, having somewhere to live in London or their constituency, and travelling between Parliament and their constituency.\n\nHowever, his comments have earned him controversy.\n\nOne said:\"Are you joking ??? Lots of families work on weekends, most don\u2019t get help with cost of childcare any day of the week !\n\n\"Most families HAVE to work weekends just to pay the rent !! Absolutely disgusting. (sic).\"\n\nOn his own Facebook page, constituents complained about his comments.\n\nJim Charman wrote: \"Last night I worked a 10 hour night shift on a frontline ambulance. I had no support for childcare.\n\nThe MP responded: \"I\u2019m not asking for anything for myself and I expressly said that I was not complaining about working on Saturday, which I do most weeks in some shape or other.\"\n\nOne - seemingly sarcastically - suggested a charity single to help MPs.\n\n\"I'm currently setting up a gofundme page for all these poor MPs working this Saturday,\" he added.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nAnother called him 'despicable' and said he was an embarrassment to constituents who have to juggle childcare and work.\n\nIn response to the comments, Mr Bryant said: \"People may not be aware that I have no children myself so I was not seeking anything for myself.\n\n\"There is normally a nursery in Parliament which is paid for by MPs.\n\n\"Sadly it cannot be open today. I have always campaigned for free childcare for all as they have in Sweden and am proud parents in Wales now have 30 hours of free childcare a week for three and four-year-olds.\n\n\"I have also campaigned for additional protections for all our emergency workers.\n\n\"All I was seeking was that MPs who have childcare responsibilities should not be disadvantaged compared to other MPs.\n\n\"I also believe that good employers should provide high quality childcare for their staff\".", "description": "Rhondda MP Chris Bryant said the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority should consider financial provisions to cover the cost of childcare when MPs have to attend Parliament on a Saturday", "authors": ["Ruth Mosalski", "Image", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20654732.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_THP_CHP_191019Slug_10959JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
