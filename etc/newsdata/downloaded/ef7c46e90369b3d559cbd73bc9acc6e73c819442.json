You\u2019ve unloaded the car, navigated endless, winding corridors with twenty bags and a house plant in tow, survived a brief (perhaps tearful) farewell, and now you face the front door of your new university home.\n\nYou slide your key into the lock. But then, you pause. What will your housemates be like? Infernal, twisted demons plucked straight from the ugly depths of depravity \u2013 or maybe just, quite nice? There\u2019s only one way to find out.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe key turns. The door opens, and...\n\nThe future looks bright. According to UCAS, 76 per cent of students in the UK are satisfied with their university housing and 80 per cent of those in shared accommodation report to be happy.\n\nOne study even claims that sharing toilets (alongside other communal spaces) has \u201cimportant and lasting consequences for well\u2010being\u201d. See your housemates enough, and you might just get on, it seems.\n\nWhatever the data says, it\u2019s normal to feel anxious about staying in halls. After all, you\u2019ll be bunking up with people that you\u2019ve never met or barely know, and even in the nicest digs things can get a little tense from time to time.\n\nBut, fear not. Hardened students, psychologists and universities are there to hand out advice on how to diffuse tension in your flat this year, and make halls feel more like home than hell.\n\nLet\u2019s begin\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Here\u2019s what to consider when it comes to breaking the ice.\n\nReach out\n\nMental health charity Mind suggests leaving your door open to invite people in, sharing tea in the kitchen or taking trips into town with the whole gang to ease up shyness during the first weeks after moving in.\n\n\u201cThat first encounter can be quite overwhelming and difficult for people who are nervous to come out of their rooms\u201d officers from Manchester Metropolitan University\u2019s (MMU) Student Union said.\n\nThey suggest writing a note and leaving it in the kitchen on the first day, anonymously, for added intrigue. Just include a meeting time and see who turns up.\n\nThey also advise students to set up a flat group chat.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great way to keep each other updated of where you are for safety and brings people closer together throughout the year.\u201d\n\nBe patient\n\nAnna, a Keele University graduate, said that she was the only girl in her flat, and \u201cfelt a bit like the outcast.\u201d\n\nCoupled with anxiety about social interaction, that caused her to avoid using the kitchen unless no one else was there. She would even wait until after midnight if needed, just to heat up a microwave meal.\n\nSometimes, it just takes time. Anna said that her confidence improved in second year after she resolved \u201cnot to let anxiety get the better of [her]\u201d.\n\nDr Ben Ainsworth, a psychology lecturer from the Bath Centre for Mindfulness and Compassion (BCMC), tells us that sometimes students feel pressured at university to try new things and make friends immediately.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to recognise that relationships can take time\u201d he says.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth remembering that everybody over-analyses their social interactions when starting university.\n\n\u201cJust be mindful that not everyone does a great job of first impressions, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should write people off immediately.\n\nUse your negotiating skills\n\nJake, a former student from Essex University who lived with 16 people in halls, relied on communal cooking to socialise \u2013 and keep his flat tidy.\n\n\u201cEven if it\u2019s only one or two nights a week, you can cook for the whole flat really easily and everyone can help out. You can knock out a meal in no time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen everyone cleans up, so the kitchen stays a little more sanitary.\u201d\n\nAs we all know, the way to someone\u2019s heart is through their stomach.\n\nDon't panic\n\nRemember to make an effort outside of your flat too, Jake adds.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t just befriend your housemates and then be like, \u2018okay I\u2019m done.\u2019\n\n\u201cRoommates can be great friends, but not the only ones you\u2019ll meet at university. In fact, my best friends by the end of my degree were not my roommates.\u201d\n\nYou could even poke your head around the flat next door. Don\u2019t be disappointed if your housemates aren\u2019t quite to your taste \u2013 there are plenty of fish in the sea.\n\nStaying friends\n\nSo, what if you end up in a fracas with your housemates? After the honeymoon period cools off, their annoying little personality quirks can quickly become unbearable. Perhaps they wake up at 6am every morning to a selection of full-volume German thrash tunes, or they keep clogging the sink with rice, no matter how many vague, angry emojis you send in the group chat.\n\nCompromise\n\nEmma, a student from Edinburgh University, says that laying down ground rules should help.\n\n\u201cHalf the flat enjoyed going out and having pre-drinks in the halls all the time. The others didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cA compromise was reached so that pre-drinks would happen once a week or twice if there was a specific reason, such as a birthday, and they would let the others know a day in advance.\u201d\n\n\u201cLuckily, we all still liked each other at the end of year\u201d she added.\n\nIn terms of cleaning, it\u2019s best to sit down together with your whole flat early on and draw up a rota, shopping schedule and/or general weekly to-do list. This saves the work falling onto the shoulders of just one diligent housemate.\n\nExpress yourself\n\nAnna from Keele University lived in a 10-person flat and endured \u201cloud music, movies, shouting, running in the corridors and doors slamming at all hours\u201d.\n\nShe has Asperger\u2019s Syndrome, which gives her an increased sensitivity to noise.\n\n\u201cI definitely found the chaos of drunken students, parties and so on to be more stressful than my non-Asperger's friends\u201d she said.\n\nFor a long time, Anna was too shy to bring up her issues, and it wasn\u2019t until her final year that she stuck a note to the door of a particularly noisy flatmate.\n\n\u201cAfter that, almost all of the noise from her stopped,\u201d she says.", "description": "This is it.
