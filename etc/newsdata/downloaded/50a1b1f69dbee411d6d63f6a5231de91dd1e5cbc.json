REUTERS/Denis Balibouse\n\nAmbassador Gordon Sondland said the two sides could still reach an agreement to settle a pair of 15-year-old legal cases over subsidies for aircraft development, but Washington hoped to recover damages caused to U.S. industry by the illegal EU launch aid for Airbus.\n\nBrussels is pressing Washington to skip tariffs since the EU has also won a WTO judgment against U.S. aid to Boeing and expects a WTO decision on allowable tariffs in several months. But Sondland said previous informal conversations with the EU about a settlement had \u201creally gone nowhere.\u201d\n\nAsked if Washington would impose the tariffs regardless of any settlement talks with Brussels, he said the decision was up to U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cWe want them to stop the launch aid,\u201d he said. \u201cThe launch aid damages are being computed by the WTO, and once we know what those damages are our hope is to recover them through the normal mechanisms.\u201d\n\nWashington has asked the Geneva body for approval to impose $11.2 billion of tariffs due to European subsidies for Airbus, but the WTO is likely to award a lower level of damages.\n\nThe United States has published a list of $25 billion worth of EU goods ranging from aircraft parts to Italian cheeses that are eligible to be hit with tariffs as a result of the case.\n\nThe WTO has found that both Airbus and Boeing, the world\u2019s two largest planemakers, received billions of dollars of harmful subsidies in a pair of cases marking the world\u2019s largest-ever corporate trade dispute.\n\nThe United States and EU have each threatened to impose billions of dollars of tit-for-tat tariffs, but Washington is first in line to seek tariffs under the WTO timetable.\n\nWashington in June signaled its openness to working on an enforceable mechanism to govern subsidies for aircraft production, potentially resolving the dispute which has taken up thousands of pages of rulings.\n\nBut informal talks have failed to produce any substantial progress, and EU diplomats say they are bracing for Washington to impose the full range of tariffs allowed by the WTO once the body\u2019s arbitrator rules.\n\n\u201cThe process is we get the number and then the president, with the advice of the U.S. trade representative, decides what the appropriate level of ... tariffs (is) ... if any,\u201d Sondland said. \u201cThat\u2019s completely up to the president.\u201d", "description": "The United States hopes to see a decision from the WTO in the next week or two about the level of tariffs Washington may impose after winning a case about European subsidies to Airbus, the U.S. ambassador to Brussels said Wednesday.", "authors": ["Andrea Shalal", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190905&t=2&i=1426370106&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8314N"}
