Durham, the United States attorney in Connecticut, have interviewed about two dozen former and current F.B.I. officials, the people said. Two former senior F.B.I. agents are assisting with the review, the people said.\n\nThe number of interviews shows that Mr. Durham\u2019s review is further along than previously known. It has served as a political flash point since Attorney General William P. Barr revealed in the spring that he planned to scrutinize the beginnings of the Russia investigation, which Mr. Trump and his allies have attacked without evidence as a plot by law enforcement and intelligence officials to prevent him from winning the 2016 election.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Us Politics Durham-Review-Fbi-Witnesses.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
