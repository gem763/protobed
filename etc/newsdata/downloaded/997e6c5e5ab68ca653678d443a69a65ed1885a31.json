Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (no change)\n\nPOWER RANKINGS Throughout the 2019-20 season, each week Sportsmail will bring you a Power Rankings table, listing the top 10 hottest players in the Premier League. As the stories of the season unravel, the rankings will provide a form guide with players moving in and out of the top 10 depending on both their performances in the previous week and also in recent weeks.\n\nFor the first time this season, Aubameyang wasn't called upon to earn points for Arsenal in the Premier League as they narrowly overcame Bournemouth 1-0 at the Emirates Stadium.\n\nThe Gabon striker, who struggled to influence proceedings in what was a fairly dull clash in north London, did hit the post late on for the hosts from a Calum Chambers delivery.\n\nVictory on the weekend ensured Arsenal moved up to third in the Premier League table and they have Aubameyang to thank for that - scoring seven of the club's 13 goals this season. That equates to him grabbing 54% of their strikes so far.\n\nPierre-Emerick Aubameyang struggled to influence proceedings against Bournemouth\n\n9. Wesley (new entry)\n\nAston Villa's 5-1 thrashing of fellow newly-promoted Norwich at Carrow Road on Saturday could prove a huge morale-boosting win for Dean Smith's side.\n\nAnd Villa have Wesley to thank after setting them well on their way by scoring their opening two goals before Jack Grealish, Conor Hourihane and Douglas Luiz also got on the scoresheet against the Canaries.\n\nWesley has begun life well in the Premier League after joining from Club Brugge in the summer, scoring four goals and creating one assist already in eight matches as Villa look to beat the drop.\n\nWesley scored twice as Aston Villa thrashed Norwich 5-1 at Carrow Road in the Premier League\n\n8. Willy Boly (new entry)\n\nIt has been a fantastic week for Boly - first scoring the winner in injury-time for Wolves as they got their Europa League campaign up and running against Besiktas, before keeping the reigning Premier League champions at bay.\n\nThe French centre-back produced a heroic performance for Nuno Espirito Santo's side as they shocked Manchester City 2-0 at the Etihad thanks to a late double from substitute Adama Traore.\n\nBoly, alongside Conor Coady and Romain Saiss, has helped Wolves - who have started to kick on following a tough start to the season - keep two Premier League clean sheets in a row and three in all competitions.\n\nWilly Boly helped Wolves keep a clean sheet as they shocked Manchester City 2-0 on Sunday\n\n7. James Maddison (new entry)\n\nMaddison continues to deliver the goods for Leicester and put himself in contention for a starting berth for England after shining once again against pace-setters Liverpool at Anfield.\n\nWhile it ended in heartbreak for the Foxes, Maddison thought he had grabbed a point in the 80th minute after finishing off with a composed finish after latching onto a pass from Ayoze Perez.\n\nHe has scored two goals and produced as many assists to help guide Leicester into the Champions League positions heading into the international break. Despite still being just 22, he is showing maturity and confidence well ahead of his years.\n\nJames Maddison scored for Leicester at Liverpool but it ended in heartbreak for the visitors\n\nLAST WEEK'S POWER RANKINGS 10. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (Arsenal) 9. Mohamed Salah (Liverpool) 8. Tammy Abraham (Chelsea) 7. Chris Wood (Burnley) 6. Jamie Vardy (Leicester) 5. Sergio Aguero (Manchester City) 4. Raheem Sterling (Manchester City) 3. Callum Wilson (Bournemouth) 2. Sadio Mane (Liverpool) 1. Kevin De Bruyne (Manchester City)\n\n6. Sergio Aguero (down one)\n\nIt was an afternoon to forget for Aguero and his City team-mates as they fell to yet another shock defeat at home to Wolves on Sunday, leaving themselves already eight points behind pace-setters Liverpool after as many matches.\n\nPremier League great Aguero will have been disappointed with himself after shanking an effort wide of the post in injury-time to level the scoring before Traore went up the other end to seal the shock victory for the visitors in Manchester.\n\nBut despite failing to add to his tally in his last two games, the Argentine striker still sits joint top with Tammy Abraham in terms of Premier League goals scored with an impressive eight to his name.\n\nThere was frustration for Sergio Aguero and City as they lost 2-0 at home to Wolves\n\n5. Raheem Sterling (down one)\n\nAgain, just like Aguero, it was a difficult day at the office for England international Sterling, who has enjoyed another fine start to the Premier League season for Pep Guardiola's giants.\n\nSterling failed to stamp his authority against Wolves despite playing the full 90 minutes with City now playing catch up even more with top-flight title rivals Liverpool.\n\nBut Sunday's game can't hide the 24-year-old's remarkable start to the season, in which he has already scored six times and continued to prove a menace for opposition defences.\n\nRaheem Sterling struggled to stamp his authority for City against Nuno Espirito Santo's side\n\n4. Callum Wilson (down one)\n\nWilson's fine form for Bournemouth has led to the England striker attracting interest from Manchester United, who are monitoring his situation ahead of the January transfer window.\n\nWilson, who kept his place in Gareth Southgate's England squad for their upcoming Euro 2020 qualifiers against the Czech Republic and Bulgaria, has five goals to his name so far.\n\nAfter scoring in four consecutive Premier League games for the Cherries, Wilson was hoping to add to his tally against Arsenal but unfortunately for him, the Gunners restricted his chances as they clinched on to a 1-0 victory.\n\nCallum Wilson was restricted by Arsenal's defence as Bournemouth lost 1-0 at the Emirates\n\n3. Kevin De Bruyne (down two)\n\nDe Bruyne slips down two places in the rankings after missing out against Wolves with a groin injury, which also sidelined him against Dinamo Zagreb in the Champions League.\n\nThe Belgium international's return already can't come soon enough for Guardiola following their setback on the weekend at the Etihad.\n\nThe 28-year-old, who has become one of the best players in world football, is a real joy to watch and already has eight assists to his name this season. In fact, injury permitting, he is on course to surpass Arsenal legend Thierry Henry's league record of 20 assists in a single season (2002-03).\n\nCity will be desperate to have Kevin De Bruyne back after he missed the defeat against Wolves\n\n2. Tammy Abraham (up six)\n\nIt has been the dream start to life this season for Abraham, who was recently rewarded with a senior England call-up after shining for Frank Lampard's young Chelsea side in the top-flight.\n\nAbraham once again netted for the Blues as they thrashed Southampton 4-1 at St Mary's, with their other goals coming from Mason Mount, N'Golo Kante and Michy Batshuayi.\n\nThe 22-year-old, who spent last season on loan at Aston Villa, is joint top scorer in the Premier League with Aguero on a brilliant eight goals. If he continues to develop, he could become a mainstay at Chelsea for years to come.\n\nTammy Abraham continued his fine form for Chelsea as they beat Southampton 4-1\n\n1. Sadio Mane (up one)\n\nMane goes top of the charts after playing an influential role for Liverpool as they claimed a last-gasp 2-1 victory over Leicester on Brendan Rodgers' return to Anfield for the first time since his dismissal in 2015.\n\nThe Senegal international put the Reds ahead with a composed finish in the 40th minute before winning a penalty during the fifth-minute of injury-time after going down following very slight contact from Marc Albrighton.\n\nMane - playing alongside Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino - has been the Reds' most potent attacker so far this season, netting five times and creating one assist as the club go in search for their first ever Premier League title.", "description": "As the season unravel, the rankings will provide a form guide with players moving in and out of the top 10 depending on both their performances in the previous fixtures and also in recent weeks.", "authors": ["Jonathan Spencer For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/16/19402056-0-image-a-4_1570461267787.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
