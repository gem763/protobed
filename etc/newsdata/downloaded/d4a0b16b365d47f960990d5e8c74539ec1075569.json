Train services, including those connecting to the airport, remain suspended Saturday morning.\n\nA court denied an injunction application against the law and the city\u2019s metro operator shut down all services late Friday for the first time since the demonstrations started. Protests planned Saturday included a cheeky march in Halloween masks as the government invoked rarely used powers to quell the unrest.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s leader, Carrie Lam, announced the prohibition on masks during public assemblies after the former British colony suffered some of its worst violence yet on Tuesday, with a police shooting and wounding an 18-year-old protester. Activists have repeatedly used the government\u2019s actions to rally supporters for more protests during a three-day holiday weekend, including the masked march on Saturday and a rally against police tactics Sunday.\n\nProtests sparked over government legislation to allow extraditions to mainland China have dragged on for almost four months, despite Lam\u2019s decision to withdraw the bill. Demonstrators say they won\u2019t settle for anything short of their five demands, including direct elections for the city\u2019s leader -- something that the Communist Party in Beijing says it can\u2019t accept.\n\nHere\u2019s the latest (all times local):\n\nTrain services suspended (6:22 a.m.)\n\nThe city\u2019s train services, including its Airport Express Line and MTR bus services, remain suspended, the government said in a statement. Bus services running in the morning may be diverted due to road conditions after more than 100 sets of traffic lights were damaged or tampered with on Friday night.\n\nOne man shot (2:45 a.m.)\n\nA plain-clothed policeman fired a shot which injured a man at about 9 p.m. on Friday after the officer was attacked and beaten by protesters, Yolanda Yu, a police senior superintendent, said a press conference early Saturday morning. The incident is being investigated, she said, defending the right of the officer to discharge his weapon as his life \u201cwas threatened.\u201d\n\nThe police haven\u2019t been in contact with the man, who\u2019s undergoing surgery at a local hospital. While she didn\u2019t link the case to the earlier injury sustained by a 14-year-old, Yu said she believes it\u2019s related to the open-fire incident in the Yuen Long district.\n\nInjured 14-year-old, officer assaulted: (12:18 a.m.)\n\nA 14-year-old who was sent to hospital is in a serious condition after this evening\u2019s protests, according to a spokesman for Hong Kong\u2019s Hospital Authority. The spokesman couldn\u2019t specify how the patient was injured.\n\nAt around 9 p.m., a large group of \u201crioters\u201d attacked a plainclothes police officer, according to a government statement. The officer was assaulted after he fell to the ground, firing his gun to warn off his assailants. Another subsequently hurled a petrol bomb at him, setting his body briefly on fire. The officer dropped his gun while escaping and a second petrol bomb was thrown at him as he called for back up, according to the statement.\n\nCourt denies interim injunction: (11:38 p.m.)\n\nAfter listening to arguments for two hours, a court decided against granting a temporary suspension of the anti-mask law after pro-democracy activists brought a late Friday injunction application. The ban will come into effect at midnight.\n\nThe iShares MSCI Hong Kong ETF, the biggest U.S. exchange-traded fund tracking the nation\u2019s stocks, fell to a session low during U.S. trading on Friday, sliding as much as 2.3%.\n\nMTR says stations, train set on fire: (11:10 p.m.)\n\nA spokesman for the rail operator said that some metro station entrances and a train at Sha Tin station were set on fire and damaged on Friday evening, prompting the decision to implement a city-wide shut down -- the first since the protests began four months ago.\n\nSeparately, many stores and supermarkets shut early and a number were vandalized, including a China Mobile outlet in Causeway Bay.\n\nHong Kong MTR suspends all train services: (10:39 p.m.)\n\nHong Kong\u2019s MTR Corp. suspended all train services for the first time since the protests started, following a gradual shut down on Friday evening, local media reported.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The latest Hong Kong protest ended late Friday night with another person shot, as demonstrators called for a mass show of defiance against the government\u2019s newly imposed ban on masks.
