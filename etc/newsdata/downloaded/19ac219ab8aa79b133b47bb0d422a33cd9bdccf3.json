What was Sept. 11, after all? Since it wasn\u2019t about Trump, it was just another day to him. Actually, no\u2014if anything, it was a good day in Trumpworld, because as you\u2019ll recall, his immediate reaction to the collapse of the towers was to note that he now owned the tallest building in lower Manhattan. As the days went on and the media coverage only intensified, he no doubt came to resent the existence of such a major news event that was not about Trump.\n\nAnd from Republicans, the usual crickets. Here was Missouri Republican Sen. Roy Blunt on Meet the Press Sunday morning when Chuck Todd asked him what he thought about Trump inviting the Taliban onto American soil, smiling, if you can believe it, as he spoke: \u201cBy the time I knew they were going to be stepping foot, they weren\u2019t stepping foot, so I didn\u2019t have to deal with that.\u201d Wow. When they build the Blunt memorial someday in Kansas City, those are surely the words that will be emblazoned across the frieze!", "description": "The GOP rank and file should look to the U.K., where history will record that some members of Boris Johnson\u2019s own party stood up and said no.", "authors": ["Michael Tomasky", "Special Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567990723/190908-Tomasky-Republicans-tease_gpxr6m", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
