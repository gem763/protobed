It\u2019s not even November and the No. 16 Wolverines must beat No. 7 Penn State as a road underdog on Saturday night to keep control of their destiny.\n\nThat 35-14 loss at Wisconsin last month dropped fifth-year coach Jim Harbaugh to 1-6 on the road against ranked opponents.\n\nThis is Penn State\u2019s annual \u201cWhiteout\u201d game, and the Nittany Lions are looking to build on their hard-earned win at Iowa last week and avenge last year\u2019s lopsided loss at Michigan.\n\nThere are two other Top 25 matchups, both in the Pac 12. No. 12 Oregon visits No. 25 Washington, and No. 13 Utah plays at No. 17 Arizona State.\n\nGAME OF THE WEEK\n\nMichigan (5-1, 3-1 Big Ten) at Penn State (6-0, 3-0)\n\nThe Wolverines\u2019 new offense is yet to impress against a quality opponent. Here\u2019s an opportunity against one of the nation\u2019s best defenses. The Nittany Lions have allowed 19 points in three Big Ten games.\n\nPenn State is in the middle of a challenging stretch. After playing Michigan at home, trips to Michigan State and Minnesota are next.\n\nHEISMAN WATCH\n\nLSU\u2019s Joe Burrow, whose performance against Florida further enhanced his credentials, goes against a middling defense at Mississippi State. Burrow was just so-so against the Bulldogs last year. He and the LSU offense are way different than they were then.\n\nOklahoma\u2019s Jalen Hurts will try to make the Sooners 8-0 against West Virginia since the Mountaineers joined the Big 12 in 2012. Through six games he\u2019s matched 2018 Heisman winner Kyler Murray\u2019s passing numbers and has surpassed his rushing numbers.\n\nTua Tagovailoa enters Alabama\u2019s home game against Tennessee having thrown for 1,155 yards and 15 touchdowns with one interception against three SEC opponents.\n\nNUMBERS GAME\n\n7 - Total points by which Pittsburgh has won its last three games.\n\n8 - Texas wide receivers who have scored touchdowns.\n\n16 - Consecutive games Oklahoma has scored at least 30 points, the longest streak in the nation.\n\n22 - Consecutive games Mississippi State has recorded a takeaway, the longest active streak in the nation.\n\n1933 - The last year Oregon held its first three conference opponents under 10 points.\n\nUNDER THE RADAR\n\nNo. 18 Baylor (6-0, 3-0 Big 12) at Oklahoma State (4-2, 1-2): The Bears\u2019 sack-happy defense goes against the highest-ranked offense it\u2019s seen so far. Oklahoma State is coming off an open date and looking to get back on track after losing two of its last three.\n\nTemple (5-1, 2-0 American) at No. 19 SMU (6-0, 2-0): SMU is 6-0 for the first time since 1982, but only one of those wins was against a team that has a winning record. The Owls have beaten two ranked opponents.\n\nLouisiana-Monroe (3-3, 2-0 Sun Belt) at No. 24 Appalachian State (5-0, 2-0): The Mountaineers have their highest ranking since joining the FBS ranks in 2014. Two of the Warhawks\u2019 three losses are against Power Five teams, and they\u2019ve won both of their Sun Belt games by double digits.\n\nHOT SEAT WATCH\n\nKalani Sitake\u2019s BYU Cougars enter their home game against Boise State having lost three straight since the overtime home win over Southern California. That leaves Sitake 22-23 in four seasons, 13-19 since he went 9-4 in 2016. Road losses to Toledo and South Florida in consecutive weeks - games in which the Cougars were favored - have left the fan base squirming.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Michigan came into the season a trendy pick to win the Big Ten East.
