Col. Alexander Vindman. After a number of Republicans in the House and Senate harshly rebuked pundits for questioning the nat-sec aide\u2019s motives as he testified, most backed off and hailed his service to the country. This morning, however, Trump went on the offensive by suggesting that Vindman was a \u201cNever Trumper witness\u201d in the impeachment depositions, one who nonetheless could not establish any corrupt actions in his July 25 phone call to Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nWhich may be true \u2026 as far as that claim goes:\n\nYesterday\u2019s Never Trumper witness could find NO Quid Pro Quo in the Transcript of the phone call. There were many people listening to the call. How come they (including the President of Ukraine) found NOTHING wrong with it. Witch Hunt! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 30, 2019\n\nAccording to leaks from the deposition, there\u2019s a reason Vindman couldn\u2019t point to a quid pro quo in the transcript. Vindman told the House committees during yesterday\u2019s questioning that references to the Bidens have been edited out of the transcript, a problem he noticed right away and attempted to get corrected.\n\nBy the way, this leak didn\u2019t come from Schiff or the Democrats:\n\nA Republican congressman on Wednesday confirmed Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman told impeachment investigators that at least two portions of the July phone call between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky were omitted from the summary of the conversation released by the White House. \u201cYeah, he testified that in two occasions the ellipses, the dot-dot-dot, should have been some words,\u201d Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) told NPR. \u201cWe annotated those on our copies of the call. I will tell you that some people may see them as significant. I don\u2019t see them as significant.\u201d\n\nSome people certainly will see any redaction or excision as significant, especially given just how much Trump has relied on the released transcript for his defense. Perry\u2019s playing it smart by getting out in front of the issue in order to downplay it. It\u2019s a technique that attorneys use in court to deal with potentially damaging information by getting it out themselves in direct testimony, where they can present it in context. (Perry is not an attorney, however.)\n\nInterestingly, the placement of this testimony well down in the Washington Post\u2019s story makes it seem less significant too. It only comes up in the 16th paragraph:\n\nVindman said he was so worried about Trump\u2019s request that Zelensky investigate his political foes that he reported it to the NSC\u2019s lead counsel, just as others at the NSC did at the direction of John Bolton, the former national security adviser who found the Ukraine pressure unsavory. \u201cI did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government\u2019s support of Ukraine,\u201d Vindman told lawmakers. \u201cI realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma, it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained. This would all undermine U.S. national security.\u201d Vindman also testified that the rough transcript of the July 25 call released by the White House is slightly different than what he remembers transpiring. For example, Vindman recalled Zelensky specifically referencing the Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma when Trump pushed him to investigate a company related to Biden\u2019s son Hunter, who had served on its board. Vindman also remembers Trump going on about how Joe Biden was on tape boasting about Ukraine funds \u2014 most likely referring to comments Biden made in January 2018 that the United States held up $1 billion in loan guarantees until the nation fired a corrupt former prosecutor, Victor Shokin.\n\nThat might have been inappropriate for the level and nature of the call, but that doesn\u2019t describe a quid pro quo either. Well, actually it does, but it\u2019s the one implied in Joe Biden\u2019s intervention in late 2015, not one by Trump. Vindman corroborates the general feeling at NSC over the \u201cunsavory\u201d nature of Trump discussing his political opponents with the head of a foreign government, but nothing in the leaks show a quid pro quo \u2014 yet, anyway.\n\nDemocrats have recently taken to arguing that one doesn\u2019t need a quid pro quo to have committed an abuse of power. That\u2019s true, and it\u2019s also true that the House can decide for itself what constitutes an impeachable act, as impeachment is a political process rather than a prosecutorial process. Both of those arguments avoid the uncomfortable fact that an impeachment without an actual statutory crime at its core \u2014 not a process crime involving obstruction of a political House probe \u2014 will fall far short of the gravitas necessary to generate a political consensus for removal. Even a quid pro quo wouldn\u2019t qualify as a distinct statutory crime, but House Democrats don\u2019t even have that much, and sound less and less confident that they will find one.", "description": "Vindman: Zelensky call transcript omitted Biden references, but ...", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Trump-NY-Times.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
