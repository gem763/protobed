We spent a week with Alfa's first high-octane 4X4 to find out if you really can take a sumo wrestler and turn it into a sprinter.\n\nCan a sumo wrestler be a sprinter? This is the Alfa Stelvio QV - a 503bhp performance car weighing almost 2 tons\n\nThe world\u2019s first \u2018pretty\u2019 SUV\n\nHigh-performance SUVs are nothing new these days.\n\nDemand has now reached a point when manufacturers are making versions of their 4X4s to suit all kinds of customers - including petrolheads.\n\nIt's the reason behind models like Lamborghini\u2019s monumental Urus, Porsche\u2019s Macan Turbo, a full quota of rapid Audi SQ models and \u2013 shortly \u2013 Ferrari\u2019s first ever SUV. Even Skoda has a souped-up 4X4 (the Kodiaq VRS) in 2019.\n\nNone of them are what you\u2019d call pretty. Not until the Stelvio, that is.\n\nHandsome and well proportioned, the Italian car maker \u2013 which is famed for creating stunning, though not always reliable, models \u2013 has hit the nail on the head with its first SUV attempt.\n\nOur test car, finished in non-traditional Misano metallic blue, certainly stands out among the comparatively bland motors parked on my street.\n\nPeering at it out of my living room window, it looks like a well-groomed Italian businessman who's found himself manning a North London fruit and veg\u2019 market stall.\n\nHandsome and well proportioned, this is the first SUV we reckon is worthy of being described as pretty\n\nThe interior is just as stylish, though the infotainment screen feels a little tiny for a car of such enormous dimensions\n\nThe steering wheel is a mix of carbon fibre and Alcantara. Black dials with white accents is always a classy look\n\nIt\u2019s just as stylish on the inside, too.\n\nThe cabin instruments and controls feel classy, while the \u00a33,250 optional carbon-backed Sparco bucket seats and \u00a3425 carbon-fibre and Alcantara-wrapped steering wheel remind you this is no run-of-the-mill family wagon.\n\nThe only criticism is the relatively dinky infotainment screen that seems totally out of proportion with the rest of the Stelvio\u2019s bulging dimensions. It's like a body builder who has a really tiny\u2026 personality.\n\nAlfa Romeo Stelvio Quadrifoglio: Will it fit in my garage? On sale: Now Price: from \u00a369,510 Test car with options: \u00a377,955 Engine: 2.9-litre V6 bi-turbo Transmission: 8-speed auto Drive: 4-wheel drive Power: 503bhp Torque: 599Nm 0-62mph: 3.8 seconds Top speed: 176mph Length: 4,702mm Width: 1,955mm Height: 1,681mm Weight: 1,830kg Fuel economy: 31.9mpg CO2 emissions: 210g/km\n\nIs it quick?\n\nAbsolutely, and Alfa's Stelvio Quadrifoglio has the certificates to show for it.\n\nNot only was it the fastest production SUV around the Nurburgring until last year, it also has the lap record for a volume-selling 4X4 around three British race circuits (Silverstone, Donington Park and Brands Hatch).\n\nAnd it's easy to see why.\n\nBury the throttle and it will tear to 62mph in just 3.8 seconds.\n\nThanks to all wheel drive, it's a tenth of a second quicker than the Giulia Quadrifoglio saloon that uses the same powerplant.\n\nThat's no mean feat for any car, let alone a 1.8-ton motor that's so high off the ground that I had to scale the door pillars to get into it.\n\nThe Stelvio QV formerly held the lap record for a production SUV around the fearsome Nurburgring. It can handle itself\n\nUnder the bonnet is the same 2.9-litre twin-turbo V6 engine with 503bhp that powers the Giulia QV saloon\n\nThe raucous note from those four tailpipes is muted from the interior, which in some way hinders some of the drama\n\nDespite carrying so much weight, under acceleration the speedo needle rotates around the dial at a rapid rate, and with little to no drama while doing so.\n\nFloor it and the body barely pitches onto its hind haunches, as it sends most of the 500 horses to the rear wheels. Commit the accelerator to the carpet and (in dry conditions) the tyres refrain from losing traction with tarmac. Even the raucous exhaust note - enough to scare an unwitting pedestrian - is muted from the well-cossetted cabin.\n\nIt\u2019s a little disappointing, actually \u2013 especially if, like me, you were expecting theatrics from the big Italian bruiser.\n\nAs well as the engine, the Stelvio uses the same eight-speed ZF automatic gearbox and electronically controlled limited-slip differential as the Giulia QV.\n\nThe transmission is \u2013 as you\u2019d expect from a modern-day auto \u2013 seamless and fluid. However, it can sometimes be dumbstruck about gear selection if you momentarily stomps on the throttle.\n\nThat's a small criticism of what is a thunderously fast SUV. And the performance is even more astounding when your route takes you to a twisty back road.\n\nRemarkably engaging for a colossal SUV\n\nFor all its 1,830kg of bulk, the Stelvio Quadrifoglio is a car you can enjoy hustling through bends.\n\nSteering response is sudden and accurate for such a heavyweight.\n\nPitch it towards a corner and the front end dives into the apex like a malnourished Roman devouring a bowl of Bolognese.\n\nIt doesn't corner with any particular flair or finesse, but it's unquestionably better than most wobbly SUVs that have the chassis control of a bouncy castle.\n\nOnce you've pivoted the Alfa's mass to aim it at the next straight, it bolts out of a corner like a bargain-hunting shopaholic making a bee-line for a 99 per cent discount sale.\n\nBut it\u2019s the compromise made to produce this level of performance that is the Stelvio Quadrifoglio's biggest Achilles' heel\u2026\n\nYou\u2019ll struggle to find a better \u2018point and squirt\u2019 car with five-seats for less than \u00a370,000. What\u2019s utterly remarkable is that it\u2019s an SUV\n\n'Pitch it towards a corner and the front end dives into the apex like a malnourished Roman devouring a bowl of Bolognese'\n\nIt\u2019s a good performance car but a not-so-great SUV\n\nBy turning the Stelvio into a sports-car hunting powerhouse, Alfa Romeo has - inadvertently, we assume - managed to strip away some of the most important characteristics you'd want from an SUV.\n\nWhile it might be mind-bogglingly fast for a high-riding hatchback, it\u2019s equally difficult to comprehend how a car with so much ground clearance can be this crashy and uncomfortable.\n\nAfter just a few miles of driving you\u2019ll be dodging potholes like your life depends on it, so limited is the suspension\u2019s ability to soak up bump and ruts in the road.\n\nIt turns just about any molehill into a mountain; every crease in the tarmac into moon-like craters.\n\nNeither the massive 20-inch five-hole alloy wheels - nor the low-profile tyres they're wrapped in - help the ride situation. They also combine to produce a fair bit of audible road noise, which turns into a constant rumble at national limit speeds.\n\nIt features more air vents in its bonnet than some jumbo jet cabins\n\nRide comfort leaves a little to be desired. After just a few miles of driving you\u2019ll be dodging potholes like your life depends on it\n\nSome of the crashy ride is down to the huge 20-inch wheels and low-profile Pirelli tyres. The brake discs are big enough to eat your dinner off\n\nThe pursuit for high performance has also made the Stelvio a little prickly to drive in town.\n\nThe immediate responsiveness of the throttle and brake pedal might be brilliant for careering along a B-road at full pelt, but it\u2019s a wheel-beating annoyance when you're trying to creep through a busy city or pull out of a tight parking space.\n\nBoth pedals are incredibly snatchy and it's almost impossible to modulate gentle acceleration from a rest. Slowing to a standstill in a traffic jam is just as juddering. I found it infuriating at times.\n\nThrow into the equation that the Stelvio has a relatively cramped second row of seats, offers below-par boot capacity for a big SUV and doesn\u2019t allow for the fitment of a tow bar, and it becomes more difficult to justify the \u00a37,000 premium you pay over the Giulia saloon.\n\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a While the Stelvio might be an adequate performance car, it's not the most practical. The boot, for an SUV, is smaller than most rivals of equivalent vehicle dimensions\n\nFor all its efforts, Alfa Romeo's attempts to make it as fast as possible has ended up limiting the Stelvio QV's appeal as a rapid family car you'd want to drive every day\n\nThe Cars & motoring verdict\n\nAlfa\u2019s achievements shouldn't be overlooked; to make such a massive vehicle feel so explosively quick is worthy of standing applause.\n\nBut the Italian firm's bid to keep up with the ongoing super-SUV arms race has limited the Stelvio's breadth of usability.\n\nIf it was fast AND practical it would have undoubtedly won me over. But by overlooking the latter it's not an Alfa Romeo I've fallen for (and I've fallen victim to Alfa ownership twice already in my driving career).\n\nThere are plenty of slightly less quick SUVs that have more room, proper comfort and better in-town driving characteristics on which your money would be better spent.\n\nAnd if it is a performance car you're after, the Stelvio will be no match for the similarly-priced non-SUV competition with an equal amount of room, including the Giulia QV (which is where my cash would go).\n\nWhile Alfa has made a valiant attempt to defy physics, it can't overcome the Stelvio's mass. Think of it this way: there's a very good reason why you haven't seen Usain Bolt lose a 100-metre race to a fat guy in a loincloth.\n\nFor all its efforts, what Alfa Romeo has instead done is limit the Stelvio QV's appeal as a fast family car - there simply are too many compromises for all that pace.", "description": "It uses a 2.9-litre V6 with 503bhp and has room for the kids.
