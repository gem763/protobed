(Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nNarcissism isn\u2019t generally considered a good thing.\n\nAnd no, we don\u2019t recommend that you lean too hard into the self-love and become self-obsessed.\n\nBut there could be a benefit to thinking you\u2019re super important.\n\nNarcissism can lead to mental fortitude and being less prone to stress and depression, according to a new bit of research led by Queen\u2019s University Belfast, was published in the journals Personality and Individual Differences and European Psychiatry.\n\nNarcissistic personality disorder is characterised by believing you\u2019re better and more deserving of good things than other people. Those who are narcissists might act as if they\u2019re \u2018above\u2019 others and will easily exploit or screw over other people for their own gain.\n\nA narcissist will also desperately need to be looked up to. They might feel upset if people who don\u2019t recognise their achievements or resent other people\u2019s success.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDr Kostas Papageorgiou, from Queen\u2019s school of psychology, says there are actually two types of narcissism \u2013 grandiose and vulnerable.\n\nHe says: \u2018Vulnerable narcissists are likely to be more defensive and view the behaviour of others as hostile, whereas grandiose narcissists usually have an over-inflated sense of importance and a preoccupation with status and power.\n\n\u2018Individuals high on the spectrum of dark traits, such as narcissism, engage in risky behaviour, hold an unrealistic superior view of themselves, are overconfident, show little empathy for others, and have little shame or guilt.\u2019\n\nThose who are vulnerable are more likely to have low self-esteem, whereas those who are grandiose have a mental toughness that can make them less prone to stress and depression.\n\nThree studies involving more than 700 people in total found that those who scored highly for grandiouse narcissism had lower levels of perceived stress and were less likely to view their life as stressful.\n\nDr Papageorgiou said: \u2018The results from all the studies that we conducted show that grandiose narcissism correlates with very positive components of mental toughness, such as confidence and goal-orientation, protecting against symptoms of depression and perceived stress.\n\n\u2018This research really helps to explain variation in symptoms of depression in society \u2013 if a person is more mentally tough they are likely to embrace challenges head-on, rather than viewing them as a hurdle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018While of course not all dimensions of narcissism are good, certain aspects can lead to positive outcomes.\n\n\u2018This work promotes diversity and inclusiveness of people and ideas by advocating that dark traits, such as narcissism, should not be seen as either good or bad, but as products of evolution and expressions of human nature that may be beneficial or harmful depending on the context.\u2019\n\nSo, should we all try to be narcissistic?\n\nNo, probably not. But we can learn from this study that a little bit of self-importance \u2013 whether that\u2019s putting yourself first, telling yourself you\u2019re brilliant, or believing you deserve good things \u2013 could be handy boost to our mental state.\n\nMORE: The 4 best facials in London to avoid the curse of winter skin\n\nMORE: Mum writes powerful letter urging people to live life to the full after being diagnosed with motor neurone disease\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "New research suggests grandiose narcissism means people have a mental toughness that could protect against depression and stress.", "authors": ["Ellen Scott"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/dating-a-narcissist1_1572334061.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
