This led to the pharmaceutical company paying much lower rebates to the government than if the EpiPen had been classified as a \"branded\" drug.\n\nMylan had disclosed in July that it had reached an agreement-in-principle with the SEC on the matter. The company said in a statement Friday that it neither admits nor denies the SEC's allegations.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
