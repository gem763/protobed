She quickly became my best friend. But now her voice was coming out of someone I didn\u2019t recognise.\"\n\nThere are currently 50,000 Australian children living in foster care and their chance of being adopted is less than one per cent. To mark National Adoption Awareness Month, Adopt Change CEO Renee Carter is calling for red tape to be cut so children can be more easily placed in a permanent home. Ms Carter says the foster care system can be \u2018really damaging\u2019 for children, with some moving up to 70 times, \u2018so really it\u2019s just not good enough\u2019.\n\n\u201cI know this is weird because you don\u2019t really know me \u2026 But you are adopted, right?\u201d\n\nOf all the messages Callie could have sent, this was the one Hannah was powerless to ignore.\n\nThe American teenager was extremely open about the fact that she had been adopted and felt excited to share her story with someone in need.\n\nCallie said she had placed her son up for adoption just days earlier and wanted to make sure she had made the right choice.\n\n\u201cMy heart ached for this girl, as she opened up to me about her experience placing her son and the backlash she experienced from friends and family leading up to her decision,\u201d Hannah first wrote on Love What Matters.\n\n\u201cShe wanted to know how I felt about my birth parents having grown up knowing I was placed. I love them, and I told her that.\n\n\u201cShe asked more questions about my relationship and found hope in the positive nature of my experience.\u201d\n\nHannah was just 17 when she was first contacted by Callie. Source: Hannah Jennings\n\n\"How did you find me?\"\n\nHannah also asked how Callie had come to find her Instagram account.\n\nShe couldn\u2019t believe it when Callie said she had found a song Hannah had written for her birth mum \u2018Right Thing.\u2019\n\nAt the time, Callie had been struggling with whether she wanted to keep her baby and she said the song had helped her make the right decision.\n\n\u201cShe said she would listen to that song over and over until she decided that adoption would be the best option for her and her baby,\u201d Hannah explained.\n\n\u201cShe continued to listen to my song as she poured over hopeful adoptive parent profiles.\n\n\u201c\u2018Right Thing\u2019 was the only thing that gave her the strength to go through with signing papers the day she did.\u201d\n\nCallie wanted to know if Hannah knew her birth parents. Source: Hannah Jennings\n\n\u201cIt was so cool to call Callie\"\n\nHannah and Callie continued to talk and quickly realised they had more in common than just adoption.\n\nThey were both 17, loved playing football and had heaps of the same interests.\n\nSoon enough Hannah was basically glued to her phone 24/7 messaging Callie.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy how a simple Q&A session that first evening escalated pretty quickly into what I considered to be one of my best friendships,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe eventually ditched Instagram and exchanged phone numbers. It was so cool to call Callie. We talked often and for a long time.\n\n\u201cWe sent pictures back and forth and I was able to see pictures she would get from her baby\u2019s parents. He was such a doll.\u201d\n\nEventually, Hannah's parents got to know Callie as well. Source: Hannah Jennings\n\n\"Callie started talking to my mum as well\"\n\nBut Hannah quickly realised that Callie\u2019s life was complicated, even after her baby was successfully adopted.\n\nHer mum fell pregnant and then miscarried a baby that wasn\u2019t her husband\u2019s, Callie crashed her car and also had to have an emergency appendectomy.\n\nHannah supported her friend through it all, even though they had never met in person.\n\n\u201cShe told me if it weren\u2019t for me, she wasn\u2019t sure if she would still be here,\u201d Hannah said.\n\n\u201cAt some point, Callie started talking to my mum as well,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThey would talk on the phone too, probably longer on the phone than I had with her.\n\n\u201cCallie confided in my mum a lot of things. It almost felt like with so much chaos in her own home-life, she found solace talking to my mum.\u201d\n\nEventually, details in Callie's story didn't add up. Source: Hannah Jennings\n\n\"We came to an unbelievable realisation\"\n\nBut as the months went by, both Hannah and her mum realised that details in Callie\u2019s stories didn\u2019t quite add up.\n\nIn the end, they called Callie\u2019s high school to check if she actually went there.\n\n\u201cWe came to an unbelievable realisation: Callie was not a real person,\u201d Hannah said.\n\n\u201cWe confronted her and told her we knew she wasn\u2019t who she said she was. She asked us not to be angry, and we asked for answers.\n\n\u201cShe wasn\u2019t Callie. She wasn\u2019t 17. The pictures she had sent us of her weren\u2019t really her, and the pictures of her baby weren\u2019t really her baby.\n\n\u201cShe was a 26-year-old woman who hadn\u2019t placed a baby up for adoption, but had just wanted to know more and didn\u2019t know how else to.\n\n\u201cShe told us how she had genuinely come to know and love our family, and that\u2019s why this relationship lasted as many months as it had.\u201d\n\nHannah's mum did everything she could think of to cheer her up. Source: Hannah Jennings\n\n\"It was her voice\"\n\nThe news hit Hannah hard, she could barely get out of bed and struggled to get through each day.\n\nHer body physically ached and she found it hard to even fake a smile.\n\n\u201cMy mum did what she thought was best, and emailed the address \u2018Callie\u2019 had given us.\n\n\u201cShe explained how much pain I was in, and asked that if she meant it that she had genuinely grown to love our family, then she would FaceTime us and let us see her real face.\n\n\u201cShe came up on the screen and looked nothing like the girl we had received pictures of for months. But that was her voice.\n\n\u201cIt was surreal to hear the voice we had talked hours to, but coming out of someone we didn\u2019t recognise. She apologised profusely.\n\n\"That conversation brought me closure and helped me to start to pick up my pieces.\"\n\nFollow Hannah's journey on Instagram.\n\nHannah finally got the closure that she needed.
