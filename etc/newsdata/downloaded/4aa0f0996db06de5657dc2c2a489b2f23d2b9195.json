New worlds. Same old Seven of Nine kicking arse. (Image: All images via CBS)\n\nPatrick Stewart beamed into the Javits Centre for New York Comic Con this past weekend with a few friends and an absolutely incredible new look at Star Trek: Picard. Building on the complex world we saw established in its first trailer, decades after the events of Star Trek: Nemesis, here\u2019s what we spotted in our new look at Jean-Luc\u2019s next adventure.\n\nThe trailer opens in the familiar vineyards of Chateau Picard in La Barre, which Jean-Luc has now taken over after the death of his brother and nephew in a fire at the estate, something he learned way back in Star Trek: Generations. But something isn\u2019t quite right.\n\nWe don\u2019t see Jean-Luc here first, but instead, Data (Brent Spiner), wearing his yellow operations uniform from The Next Generation and painting on a canvas. Funny thing for a dead android to be doing, given that Data sacrificed himself in the climax of Star Trek: Nemesis \u2014 which Picard is set approximately two decades after.\n\nIt\u2019s only when Picard enters the picture, also clad in his TNG uniform, that we realise things are certainly less real here, and perhaps more of a dream, something that would make sense given the first trailer showed us Picard still lamenting Data\u2019s sacrifice. But while the dream state is interesting, what\u2019s more interesting is what Data is painting.\n\n\u201cWould you like to finish it, Captain?\u201d Data asks as he offers his paint brush and we see the incomplete painting is of a cloaked woman looking out at a stormy sea. Her face is not yet filled in, but given what we saw of the new character and seemingly former Borg Dahj\u2019s (Isa Briones) appearance in the prior trailer, could this be less of a dream that\u2019s about Picard remembering the past, and more of a vision of his immediate future?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how,\u201d Picard sadly tells Data, before the android tells him otherwise \u2014 and the offering of the brush seems to spark flashbacks in Jean-Luc\u2019s head. An unknown world on fire, as ships of an unknown design raze it from above. The green lights on the ships might indicate that these are Romulan \u2014 they certainly don\u2019t match up with the Valdore-esque warbirds we saw in the last trailer.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say if these flashbacks are of an unknown attack or are somehow part of the rescue-operation-gone-wrong in the wake of the destruction of Romulus (which occurred in the prime-timeline parts of the 2009 Star Trek movie, and are canonical to this series) that lead to Picard retiring from Starfleet before the events of the show.\n\nPicard wakes from his dream with a lick or two from his new best friend, Number One the pit bull. We have nothing to add here beyond the fact that this dog is still incredibly cute.\n\n\u201cI came here to find safety,\u201d Picard tells us as he and Dog Number One go for a stroll in the vineyards of Chateau Picard. \u201cBut one is never safe from the past,\u201d he continues...\n\nAs his rest is interrupted by the arrival of Dahj, begging for help and claiming that someone is after her. Dahj\u2019s true identity of being a liberated Borg drone \u2014 akin to Jean-Luc after he briefly became Locutus in TNG\u2019s iconic \u201cThe Best of Both Worlds\u201d two-parter \u2014 was something the first trailer for Picard really got into, but we\u2019ll see more of it later here.\n\nFor now, Jean-Luc heads back to Starfleet HQ in San Francisco. Funnily enough, this panning shot of the Golden Gate Bridge covered in solar panels is practically identical to one seen in Star Trek: Discovery\u2019s second season finale, \u201cSuch Sweet Sorrow, Part 2,\u201d with a few extra buildings added to the futuristic San Franscisco skyline to indicate that yes, things have changed since the 23rd century!\n\nWhat\u2019s also changed is the legacy Picard has in Starfleet\u2019s history, still being felt years after his retirement. He is confronted with it literally, in the form of a massive holographic projection of a Galaxy-Class starship in Starfleet\u2019s lobby while checking in for an appointment \u2014 it\u2019s hard to see the registration or ship name on the Hologram but there stands a very good chance that this is indeed the Enterprise-D, Picard\u2019s former command.\n\nBut even if it is, and Starfleet still lauds the heroism of one of its most famous captains, a (ahem) new generation has come along and swept Jean-Luc into the annals of history, he learns, as he has to begrudgingly spell out his name to a hapless desk officer, who tells him it\u2019s nice to see the former Captain \u201cup and about.\u201d Stewart\u2019s face here while slapping on his visitor badge is priceless.\n\n\u201cWe have an obligation to investigate,\u201d Picard tells the same Admiral we saw him meeting with in the first trailer, as we\u2019re treated to another familiar shot from that initial reveal: Picard and an unidentified, white-robed character, walking through a massive archive. \u201cThere is no we, Jean-Luc,\u201d that Admiral counters, as we see something new:\n\nA door opens in front of Jean-Luc to reveal what very much looks like a new kind of Noonien Soong android, the same kind of android Data (and his brother Lore) were. And not just one, but a whole rafter of them, stamped with labels on their foreheads and clad in orange jumpsuits.\n\nIs this where Doctor Jurati (Alison Pill) is working, glimpsed in the last trailer in which she had a copy of what appeared to be either the body of B-4 \u2014 the antagonistic copy of Data turned potential ally in Nemesis, where it was also heavily implied that Data had uploaded all his memories and personality into before his death \u2014 or a new body for Data? If so, why are there suddenly so many new Soong Androids in development?\n\nBut what if they\u2019re something else? As Jean-Luc\u2019s argument with the Starfleet Admiral gets more intense \u2014 she tells him that Starfleet is no longer \u201cyour house\u201d and that he should back down and go home \u2014 we get a shot of a walkway in what appears to be the same facility.\n\nThe same white-clad assistants milling around as the one Picard was seen, the same drones flying around. Except, we see more of people in jumpsuits, and \u2014 this appears to be the same place Dahj was seen in the first trailer, wearing a very similar orange jumpsuit.\n\nA place that was being guarded by Romulans, packed with things that looked awfully like Borg regeneration alcoves, and had signs declaring how many years the facility had gone without an assimilation. So maybe these racks of jumpsuited androids have something to do with the Borg, as well? Maybe they, like Dahj, were former drones?\n\nThat wouldn\u2019t explain why these beings Jean-Luc sees seem to be identical and are being corralled into storage like they were disposable servants \u2014 harkening back to the ethical dilemma Picard and Data confronted back in \u201cMeasure of a Man\u201d about the rights of androids in the Federation. But it raises even more questions about what\u2019s really going on with Dahj. Why are former Borg and what look like Soong Androids being kept in the same facility? And if they are, by who, alongside what\u2019s left of the Romulans?\n\nBefore we\u2019re left to ponder too much, we rejoin Picard at what appears to be Chateau Picard once more, enjoying a drink with an unfamiliar character after he\u2019s sent packing by Starfleet Command. \u201cI have to help her,\u201d Picard opines, as his unknown guest asks \u201cYou really wanna go back out into the cold?\u201d\n\nHell yeah he does.\n\nJean-Luc puts back on his old combadge \u2014 not his early TNG one, but the updated badge seen in Deep Space Nine, Voyager, and the Next Generation films.\n\nAnd so, as Jean-Luc heads off on a mission of his own, without Starfleet\u2019s backing, we begin to see him build up his new crew. We kick off with a familiar Star Trek filming locale, as Picard jets off to meet with his first candidate: These are the Vasquez Rocks, an iconic part of the Agua Dulce, California park that has played host to multiple Star Trek series, beginning of course as the sight of Kirk\u2019s infamous beatdown with the Gorn in \u201cArena.\u201d\n\nAmong the sharply jutting rocks, Picard meets Raffi Musiker (Michelle Hurd). We still don\u2019t know much about Musiker other than that she, like Picard, is ex-Starfleet and has a connection to his past. A sour one, it seems, given that when told by Jean-Luc that he has a plan to help Dahj, Musiker sarcastically mocks him about \u201canother top-secret, unauthorised rescue mission.\u201d So, presumably, she was part of the same rescue operation Picard led that ultimately resulted in his exit from Starfleet. And not just his, but perhaps Musiker\u2019s as well, on more ignoble terms.\n\nWe quickly cut to a shot of what appears to be another world, and a high-tech facility floating above a futuristic city. This at least appears to be where Doctor Agnes Jurati works (and is keeping that B-4/Lore/Data/Whoever the hell\u2019s body is in storage).\n\n\u201cThis is everything that ever mattered to me,\u201d Jurati tells Picard, as we cut to a separate scene of her demanding to join him on his mission. Press material for the character described Jurati as \u201cconfused with her place in the world,\u201d so if she\u2019s researching Soong Androids and suddenly finds there might be a connection to a new swath of them and liberated Borg like Dahj, as this trailer implies, that seems like reason enough for her to join Team Picard.\n\nAnother quick cut to another world \u2014 this one much more low-tech and briefly glimpsed in the last trailer as where Picard got manhandled by some Romulan guards \u2014 and another member of Picard\u2019s new team: Elnor (Evan Evagora), wielding his sword in front of what appears to be that same establishment Picard encountered those Romulans.\n\nGiven what appears to be a cosmetic update to Romulan makeup for Picard that heavily downplays the forehead ridges that contrasted them from their sister species, the Vulcans, it\u2019s still hard to tell if Elnor is a Romulan who goes against whatever his fellow Romulans are cooking up with the Borg, or a Vulcan that just happens to be a bit of a Samurai-esque figure roaming the galaxy brandishing space-katanas at people.\n\n\u201cI need your skill and your courage,\u201d Picard says, as we get a shot of Picard\u2019s final new crewmate: Chris Rio (Santiago Cabrera), another Ex-Starfleet officer who now captains the vessel Picard commandeers for his new adventure.\n\nMeanwhile, we cut back to the damaged Borg Cube we saw a bunch of Romulans working away on in the first trailer, and are treated to a grisly shot of a medical bay where bloodied parts of Borg are being hung up and experimented on. Given the corpses on the floor, it seems like things have gone very wrong. Whoever could\u2019ve predicted that? But look in the background \u2014 there\u2019s a blonde woman sobbing over the body on the slab...\n\n...and it\u2019s none other than Star Trek: Voyager\u2019s very own liberated Borg, Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan), wailing as she hugs the body of what looks like a Starfleet officer \u2014 look at the red shoulders on their uniform. But who is it that Seven is mourning? The hair and the command red has had a lot of people speculating that, somehow, it\u2019s Commander Chakotay, Robert Beltran\u2019s ex-Maquis-turned-first-officer from Voyager, who Seven entered into a... let\u2019s say controversial, out of nowhere romantic relationship with in the final episodes of Voyager\u2019s seventh and last season.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say for sure: there\u2019s enough obfuscation that we can\u2019t see Chakotay\u2019s face tattoo on the body (we\u2019re looking at the side it would be on, too), but unless this is a flashback, Picard takes place in the late 24th century \u2014 20 years post-Nemesis is around 2399. Voyager returned from the Delta Quadrant in 2378. If this was Chakotay, wouldn\u2019t he look... older? And what would he be doing hanging around in a Borg Cube, anyway?\n\nBut even if Chakotay is some unlikely speculation, there\u2019s a far more interesting character it could be \u2014 Icheb, the Brunali former Drone the crew of Voyager liberated alongside several other young drones in the sixth season episode \u201cCollective.\u201d\n\nNot only did Icheb stay with the crew when it returned to the Alpha Quadrant, before they even returned and established communication with Starfleet, he applied for and passed the Starfleet Academy entrance exam. Presumably, Icheb would\u2019ve gone on to make a career in Starfleet when Voyager got home, and being a liberated Borg, he would be an intriguing candidate for whatever experiments the Romulans are working on \u2014 and a suitably devastating victim for Seven to find.\n\nWhoever it is, it means there\u2019s a Starfleet connection to whatever the Romulans are doing on this Cube, and that Seven\u2019s been conducting a mission of her own.\n\n\u201cThe past is written,\u201d Jean-Luc\u2019s narration tells us, \u201cBut we are left to write the future.\u201d It\u2019s cut to imply that Picard is saying this to Rio, as we see the Captain instruct his new motley crew to hold on as the ship warps off into space. The ship appears to be a new design for Picard, not of Federation or Starfleet design, and yet kind of like someone took a Centaur-class ship and covered it in some boxy extra armour. It\u2019s cool!\n\nIt\u2019s not long before we get to see it in some very interesting action, too, as Rio\u2019s ship and an unidentified vessel open fire on what is a very familiar ship: a Romulan Warbird. And not just any warbird, but the Bird-of-Prey, the iconic 23rd-century Romulan ship class introduced back in the original Star Trek. What the hell is one doing in the late 24th century?\n\nWell, given that Romulus itself has been wiped out with the Hobus star going supernova in 2387, it stands to reason that what is left of the Romulan Star Empire at this point is in a state of disarray. If much of the modern fleet was wiped out in Romulus\u2019 destruction, maybe they\u2019ve had to fall back on adapting old ships to 24th century standards?\n\nSpeaking of old tech in futuristic settings, back on the world where Picard meets Elnor, we see him get into a swordfight with a Romulan guard outside that restaurant. Jean-Luc\u2019s still got it \u2014 and we also get two quick shots of a mysterious masked figure smashing open a window somewhere, as well as Jurati and Rio celebrating aboard the ship.\n\nBack on the Cube, we flashback to Dahj\u2019s imprisonment at the hands of the Romulans. \u201cShe was sent for a reason,\u201d a female Romulan says \u2014 it might not be, but it looks like the still unnamed (but apparently played by Peyton List) Romulan who was glimpsed in the first teaser, working with Narek (Harry Treadaway). In the past trailer, Narek appeared to be some kind of scientist, but here, he\u2019s getting information out of Dahj through some, err...intensive field testing? \u201cI\u2019ll get the information we need,\u201d Narek tells his ally. He\u2019ll get more than that.\n\nElnor unseathes his sword in a dark environment that looks an awful lot like this Borg Cube. So perhaps Dahj, having escaped once already and fled straight to Jean-Luc, is recaptured by the Romulans and Picard\u2019s mission to rescue her sees this new crew infiltrate the Cube? We also get a brief glimpse of what appears to be the same locale of another familiar face...\n\nIt\u2019s Hugh the Borg (Jonathan Del Arco)! Del Arco\u2019s return was confirmed at San Diego Comic-Con, but we get to see him here for the first time. Introduced in the TNG season five episode \u201cI, Borg\u201d, Hugh was a drone \u2014 originally named Third of Five \u2014 who gained a semblance of his humanity back after an encounter with the Enterprise.\n\nInstead of being fully liberated, however, Hugh returned to the collective with his regained individuality, and later on, appeared in another story that saw Data\u2019s evil brother Lore return. Once again, connections between liberated Borg and Soong Androids...\n\nElsewhere, Seven brushes up against Picard \u2014 this appears to be from the meeting between the duo teased in the original SDCC trailer. \u201cI help people who have no one else to help them,\u201d Seven tells Jean-Luc. It would appear that they\u2019re both investigating whatever the hell is up with the Romulans and liberated Borg like themselves (without the help of Starfleet, to boot), but Seven\u2019s been up to it way longer than Picard has.\n\nInterestingly, Trek Core got up close and personal with Seven\u2019s outfit from Picard at NYCC, and there\u2019s a lot of little Romulan-esque details too it, from the avian-themed zipper to the brown and green hues that could seemingly indicate that Seven is working with the Romulans \u2014 or a faction of Romulans that isn\u2019t too keen on whatever the ones on the Borg Cube are up to \u2014 to investigate.\n\nLook. I\u2019m not even going to explain what\u2019s going on here. Just... rejoice in it. Rejoice in its splendour. Resistance is futile, indeed.\n\nThat moment of Star Trek: Voyager fanservice smash-cuts into a moment of profound The Next Generation fanservice. A young boy calls for his busy father to leave their ramshackle cabin and greet a guest: Picard himself. The father turns...\n\n...and facing the arrived Picard is Number One himself. Not the dog this time, but former Enterprise first officer William T. Riker (Jonathan Frakes). \u201cHello, Will,\u201d Picard says to a very surprised-looking Riker.\n\nThat\u2019s not the only familiar face however, as outside the Riker residence we see Picard embrace Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis). Frakes and Sirtis\u2019 return for the series were confirmed at San Diego Comic Con too, but this is our first time since Enterprise\u2019s controversial final episode that we\u2019ve seen them again. It\u2019s been too long, for either or us Jean-Luc it seems.\n\nAnother rapid-fire set of shots tease some peculiar moments. We get to see more of Rio\u2019s ship battling the Bird-of-Prey, someone dribbling a soccer ball aboard Rio\u2019s ship, a mysterious conclave of black-robed individuals circling a suddenly-activated circle of light on the ground, and Hugh leading both Dahj and Picard through the bowels of what is presumably the Borg Cube.\n\n\u201cWe all have a story...\u201d Picard\u2019s narrates, as we see a few more intriguing scattered shots \u2014 a triangular-card-game being played, Jurati and Rio getting romantic, and those same ships from Picard\u2019s flashbacks, now with blue lighting, assaulting some kind of space station.\n\n\u201c...that is waiting to be claimed,\u201d Picard continues, as a few more shots flash by. A distressed Seven. A young girl at a rain-soaked window (maybe it\u2019s a young, pre-assimilation Dahj?). Musiker, checking a phaser. And Dahj seemingly in agony as she\u2019s horrifically burned.\n\nThe Dahj shot is the most interesting, as, judging by her outfit, this is from her initial escape to Jean-Luc \u2014 in the background, you can see the steps she was fighting a bunch of mysterious masked soldiers on while Picard looked on in the original trailer. So maybe what\u2019s happening here is some kind of violent disabling or transporter effect and she\u2019s recaptured?\n\nAnyway, one more shot of that classic Bird of Prey chasing Rio\u2019s ship later, and we\u2019re back outside the Riker household, as Jean-Luc and Will relax by the waterfront. \u201cThank you for not trying to talk me out of all this,\u201d the good Captain says to his former Number One.\n\n\u201cBelieve me, I know better,\u201d Riker retorts. Damn straight, Will.\n\nChanges that, it seems, have inspired other familiar faces to join in him making their own paths beyond the uniforms of Starfleet. And that\u2019s before we get into the mystery of what Soong Androids could have to do with all this...\n\nNot much longer till we get some answers, though: Star Trek: Picard hits Amazon Prime Video starting in January 2020.", "description": "Patrick Stewart beamed into the Javits Centre for New York Comic Con this past weekend with a few friends and an absolutely incredible new look at Star Trek: Picard.
