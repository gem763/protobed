The Suspended Particle Device, which is the Star Trek-like name for a film that turns vehicles\u2019 sunroofs and other glass from transparent to opaque, blocking the infrared and ultraviolet light that superheat interiors and prematurely age leather and other materials.\n\n\u201cYou can control the amount of heat and glare coming into the cabin,\u201d said Joe Harary, CEO of Research Frontiers, the Woodbury, New York, nanotechnology research firm that developed the film.\n\nMicroscopic particles line up when a small electric current runs through the film, effectively creating a window shade that blocks up to 99.5% of light. When the current stops, the particles flip back to their unaligned positions, returning the glass to transparency. The film attaches to the inside of the sunroof or window, the same as tinted films and noise-dampening acoustic laminates do today.\n\nThe McLaren 720S Spider's interior is cool and comfortable thanks to glass with SPD film.

Light and heat don\u2019t get in, and potential thieves can\u2019t see valuables left inside.\n\nTurn the current on as you return to the car and the windows clear.\n\nIt\u2019s more than a parlor trick. Less heat in the car could allow automakers to shrink air conditioning compressors up to 40%, reducing cost and weight. AC compressors use a lot of energy, so a cooler car will burn less fuel. In an electric vehicle, that could amount to a 5.5% increase in battery range in hot weather.\n\n\u201cMore power is going to drive the car, less to cool it,\u201d Harary said.\n\nMercedes and McLaren currently offer SPD glass on a handful of expensive cars including the Mercedes S-class sedan and SL roadster.\n\nThe interior $411,000 McLaren 720S Spyder convertible I drove this summer was notably cooler and more pleasant than a previous model with a roof of normal tinted glass.\n\nThe film has been very expensive until now because only one company produced it for automotive use. Harary expects prices to fall significantly now that a second supplier, Israel\u2019s Gauzy LC, has begun producing the film in two factories.\n\nLincoln concept vehicle with darkened SPD glass sunroof.

He expects the film\u2019s falling price and tougher fuel economy and emissions standards in Europe, China and the U.S. will appeal to a growing number of automakers, particularly when a more efficient vehicle could save an automaker millions in fines for exceeding emissions limits.\n\nTwenty-five upcoming vehicles \u2014 most of them electric \u2014 have signed up to use glass with the film.\n\nOther potential uses include replacing sun visors with a strip of light-sensitive film across the top of the windshield. Again, fewer parts and less weight.\n\nA study by Bentley showed you could save as much as 13 pounds by replacing a motorized glass sunroof and shade with a fixed piece of SPD glass, Harary said.\n\nHe also suggested the film could be used to project a message to other drivers \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m pulling over for an emergency vehicle,\u201d for instance \u2014 or to project TV or movie images on the inside glass of self-driving vehicles.\n\nThe film is also used in glass for buildings, executive jets and yachts.\n\nFollow Detroit Free Press auto critic Mark Phelan on Twitter @mark_phelan.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2019/10/28/smart-glass-windows-film-spd/2483370001/", "description": "Mercedes and McLaren use smart glass that can darken to opaque; your next car might, too.", "authors": ["Mark Phelan", "Published A.M.
