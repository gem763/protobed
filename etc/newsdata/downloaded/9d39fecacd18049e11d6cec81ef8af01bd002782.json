Biden; Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; Sen. Bernard Sanders, Vermont independent; Sen. Kamala Harris of California; and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg \u2014 but in front of four others scheduled to participate in next week\u2019s debate: Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro.\n\nRep. Tulsi Gabbard, a Hawaii Democrat who failed to qualify in the upcoming debate, said last week that she would not run as a third-party candidate if denied the party\u2019s nomination.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve ruled that out,\u201d Ms. Gabbard said on CNN. \u201cI\u2019m going to continue to focus on moving our campaign forward, continuing this grassroots campaign, continuing to deliver our message to the American people.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
