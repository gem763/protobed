Former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan said in August he wouldn't be surprised to see Treasury yields reach negative rates, adding that such a move wouldn't be very significant anyway.\n\n\"There is no barrier for US Treasury yields going below zero,\" Greenspan said. \"Zero has no meaning, besides being a certain level.\"\n\nNow read more markets coverage from Markets Insider and Business Insider:\n\nCITI: Gold could shatter $2,000, reach all-time high if recession risks continue\n\nWall Street's biggest Boeing bull breaks down why the 737 Max fiasco has created a great buying opportunity\n\n\n\nThe heads of recruiting at Salesforce and Facebook have both told us that 'best day' questions are frequently asked in interviews.
