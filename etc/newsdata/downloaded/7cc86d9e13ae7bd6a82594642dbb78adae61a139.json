Reusable designs will enable frequent rocket launches and help keep costs down.\n\nThe solid-propellant Smart Dragon-2, weighing about 60 tonnes and with a total length of 21 meters, will be capable of sending 500 kg payloads into orbit at an altitude of 500 km (310 miles), Xinhua said. It is expected to conduct a flight test next year.\n\nAt about 116 tonnes and with a length of 31 meters, the Smart Dragon-3, set for a test flight in 2021, will be capable of sending 1.5 tonne payloads into orbit, Xinhua added.\n\nIn July, Beijing-based iSpace became the first private Chinese firm to deliver a satellite into orbit on its rocket. Since late last year, two other startups have attempted to launch satellites but failed.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "China will launch test flights for the next two commercial space rockets in its Smart Dragon series meant for commercial use in 2020 and 2021.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/China-commercial-rockets-test-flights-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
