Elizabeth Warren released a new plan Monday to tackle corruption in Washington, part of the Democratic presidential candidate\u2019s ongoing promises to enact \u201cbig structural change\u201d if elected.\n\nWarren\u2019s wide-ranging new proposal seeks to dramatically limit the influence of federal lawmakers and lobbyists while also expanding protections for workers. Under the plan, lobbyists would be banned from all campaign fundraising activities \u2014 including serving as campaign bundlers \u2014 and campaigns themselves would not be able to receive \u201cintangible benefits\u201d such as opposition research from foreign governments.\n\nUnder a new definition of \u201cofficial act,\u201d politicians would not be able to accept gifts or payments in exchange for government action. Senior government officials and members of Congress would be prohibited from serving on for-profit boards, even if they receive no compensation.\n\nWarren (Mass.) also proposed banning both arbitration clauses and class-action waivers \u201cfor all employment, consumer protection, antitrust and civil rights cases.\u201d\n\nWarren has previously released other anti-corruption plans, which included proposals to require lobbyists to register and to prohibit foreign governments from hiring Washington lobbyists.\n\nThe new plan\u2019s release comes hours before Warren is slated to give a speech Monday night in New York\u2019s Washington Square Park, near the site of the former Triangle Shirtwaist Factory. A fire there in 1911 killed 146 workers, many of whom were young immigrant women.\n\nThe tragic fire \u2014 exacerbated by poor working conditions \u2014 galvanized the women\u2019s suffrage and labor movements and led to federal reforms that remain in place for workers, women and immigrants today. It was a theme that Warren hoped to tie to her modern-day bid for the White House.\n\nTomorrow, September 16th, I\u2019ll be in New York City to tell the story of how working women organized to change the course of history after the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire. I hope to see you there: https://t.co/tVK8xMeNon #WarrenNYC pic.twitter.com/ShC9TC75i7 \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) September 15, 2019\n\n\u201cThey fought back. They got organized. They persisted. And they changed the course of history,\u201d Warren said in a campaign video posted over the weekend. \u201cBig structural change, brought to you by women.\u201d", "description": "The Democratic presidential candidate\u2019s proposal seeks to limit the influence of lawmakers and lobbyists while expanding worker protections.", "authors": ["Amy B Wang", "National Politics Reporter Covering Presidential Campaigns", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/_KJfijcsn0cxI0vpHPn1uAcFdcw=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/K6ESRUWYNII6TP5RQSMIONUUOY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
