So I gave him my number and that was that.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n\"The first message I was out with my friends and it came in - 'Boris calling Jennifer'.\n\n\"And my friends were like 'you can't have his number, you can't have his name, you know like that, you have to guard his privacy'.\n\n\"And I was like 'oh okay' and they said 'put it under a codename' and I was like 'oh alright, what codename?' and they were like 'call him Alexander the Great!'\n\n\"So I put it in as Alex the Great and that's how he stayed.\"\n\n(Image: University of Otago)\n\nTech guru and former model Ms Arcuri exploded into headlines last month after it emerged she was given access to three foreign trade trips and had Mr Johnson speak at four of her events when he was London mayor.\n\nMr Johnson has 24 hours to provide details of their relationship to a conflict-of-interests probe in the London Assembly - whose rules forbid favourable treatment to friends.\n\nAnd the Prime Minister, who has claimed there was \"no interest to declare\", has also been referred to the police complaints body to assess whether he should face a criminal investigation.\n\n(Image: Paul Clarke)\n\nDespite the top-level access - which began after they met in October 2011 - Ms Arcuri today insisted \"Boris never ever gave me favouritism\".\n\nBut she repeatedly refused to deny claims by acquaintances that she had a sexual relationship with the 55-year-old PM.\n\nShe also refused to say how many times Mr Johnson visited her Shoreditch flat, which contained an office and a pole-dancing pole. And she revealed the now-PM \"asked me to show him a few things\" on the pole.\n\nShadow Chancellor John McDonnell today accused Boris Johnson of misleading the public and branded him \"unfit for office\" in the wake of the interview.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs Mayor, Boris Johnson had a duty under the Greater London Authority code of conduct to declare his friendship with Jennifer Arcuri and not to act in a way that benefited her business.\n\n\u201cRegardless of the exact nature of his relationship with Arcuri, it is clear that she and Boris Johnson were close, and that he misled the public when he said \u201cthere was no interest to declare\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Prime Minister is unfit for office. This morning has thrown up even more questions for Boris Johnson, which can only be answered with a full investigation into the apparent misuse of public funds.\u201d", "description": "She revealed she saved him in her phone as \"Alexander the Great\" after they \"bonded over a mutual love of classical literature\"", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Image", "Itv", "University Of Otago", "Paul Clarke"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20528262.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Jennifer-Arcuri.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
