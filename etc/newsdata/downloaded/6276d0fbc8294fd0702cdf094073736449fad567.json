We also speak to financial experts to ask their professional advice when we feel it is needed.\n\nIn the third of our series, we speak to a 29 year-old woman from London, who is working at an auction house on a relatively small salary but is still saving up for her first home.\n\nShe reveals how she has to skip social gatherings with her friends in order to save money for a deposit and the social pressure she feels to attend events when she can't afford it.\n\nThis is Money Diaries: Our series looks at how much those aged 18-35 spend each month, giving tips to help people achieve their goals\n\nAge: 29\n\nLocation: London\n\nOccupation: Trainee at a auction house\n\nSalary: \u00a320,000 per annum\n\nTake home pay: \u00a31,498.91 per month\n\nOutstanding debts/loans and what are they:\n\n- Student loan: \u00a313,613.07 (1.75 per cent APR)\n\n- Credit card: \u00a3190.58\n\nBank balance before pay day: \u00a3189.03.\n\nAccounts:\n\n- Lifetime Isa: \u00a319,980.58\n\n- Post Office Savings account: \u00a35,024.14 (0.24 per cent interest rate as of 5 July)\n\n- Santander Monthly Saver: \u00a3200 (2.5 per cent interest)\n\n- Fidelity Stocks and Shares Isa: \u00a39,107.66 (8.49 per cent average annual return) - had for ten years\n\n- Standard Life pension: \u00a31,325\n\nFinancial goal short-term (what would you like to achieve in a year's time): Paying for holidays and hen parties, which are so expensive.\n\nIt would be great to get a buffer of around \u00a31,000 to go towards these. I'd also love to plan a trip to New York for my 30th birthday.\n\nFinancial goal long-term (what would you like to have achieved in 5-10 years): I would really like to jump on the housing ladder to have some long-term security and a place I can decorate to my own taste.\n\nIt terrifies me how much money I have cumulatively spent on rent over the last five years living in London, definitely a deposit's worth, and I worry that housing is getting more unaffordable and I am being left behind.\n\nI feel like I'm stuck in a rent trap because my earnings are so low and I don't currently have a partner, meaning qualifying for a mortgage is tricky, even though I have managed to save a significant portion for a deposit (mostly saved when I worked in a higher-paying career).\n\nI'm interested to find out whether I would be able to make use of a guarantor mortgage to qualify for a larger mortgage with the support of my parents and then let out a room to help cover the monthly payments.\n\nI don't like the sound of Shared Ownership - the idea of paying rent and a mortgage sounds expensive.\n\nAffording to go out for drinks and dinner with friends can be difficult on a smaller salary\n\nFinancial concern, what is the single biggest financial concern month-by-month: I just about have enough income to get by each month, go for a few cheap dinners and drinks out and travel to stay with friends for the weekend, but as soon as anything more expensive/exciting is suggested I have to decline.\n\nI'd say my biggest financial concern is the social pressure to attend theatre trips, holidays etc that I can't really afford.\n\nI hate being the friend who always wants to suggest a cheaper alternative.\n\nI hate that my friends will buy me a round of drinks and I can't always afford to repay the favour.\n\nSummary by Grace: After looking through your finances, it seems you are relatively cautious about your spending and do your best to put as much aside as possible each month.\n\nMost of your household bills are reasonable, for example, you are paying \u00a352.60 a month for energy and your water bill is \u00a344.20 between three people.\n\nAs much as you have said you are not excessive with your spending when it comes to social events with friends, there are still ways you can cut down to achieve your goals of owning a property quicker.\n\nFor example, there are a number of outgoings to TfL, suggesting you use London transport a fair bit.\n\nOne way you can cut down on travel costs is to buy a 26-30 railcard, which costs \u00a330 for a year but gives you a third off all rail fare.\n\nIt also gives you a third off off-peak travel on your Oyster card, which means you can get cheaper tube rides in evenings and at weekends. This could save you a significant sum over the year for a small outlay.\n\nHome: Saving to buy a property in London is notoriously difficult - especially if you are single\n\nTips: Although you already have a significant amount saved for your first home, there is still a way to go before you can afford to buy somewhere in London.\n\nMaking small lifestyle changes as well as cutting down on some non-essential items can hopefully mean you will be able to achieve your goal quicker.\n\nLifetime Isa\n\nYou already have a large sum \u00a319,980 in your Lifetime Isa, after transferring money you had in your Help to Buy Isa.\n\nThe Lifetime Isa is a government scheme which allows users to put in up to \u00a34,000 each year until they're 50. The Government will add a 25 per cent bonus to your savings, up to a maximum of \u00a31,000 per year.\n\nYou have already maxed out the Lisa - you have been one of the savviest Lisa savers This is Money has seen.\n\nAltogether, your savings amount to \u00a334,312.38 - potentially enough for a deposit on a property.\n\nHowever, you have said you would ideally like to purchase somewhere in the South West area of London, preferably in Clapham Junction or the surrounding areas.\n\nAverage house prices in this area are \u00a3760,223, according to Zoopla, while average flat prices are \u00a3565,159.\n\nWith your \u00a334,312.38, that is a 10 per cent deposit for a \u00a3340,000 property and while this is a very good saving, it is unlikely to secure you a home in South West London.\n\nThe further out of London you go, the more you can get for your money. If you would be willing to go the outer edge, for example, Mitcham, average property prices are \u00a3375,280 with the average flat costing \u00a3286,754, meaning you already theoretically have enough for a deposit.\n\nIf you are set on purchasing in Clapham Junction, quick calculations suggest you need to save a minimum of \u00a322,200 extra for a flat, when working on the assumption of a 10 per cent deposit.\n\nBut there is a huge stumbling block, as you point out - most lenders work on a three to five times income ratio.\n\nSo, with \u00a334,000 saved and your salary times five, brings you to a total sum of \u00a3134,000 - showing how tough it can be for single people in their 20s to buy. It could be worth talking to a mortgage broker to see if there are any options.\n\nLondon is widely known as the most expensive place to live in the UK - making it hard to save\n\nYou have said you could be interested in a guarantor mortgage.\n\nWith a guarantor mortgage, a guarantor \u2013 usually a parent, a relative or a close friend \u2013 will cover your mortgage repayments if you can't pay them for any reason.\n\nA guarantor mortgage uses someone else's home as 'security' \u2013 which means the lender is able to sell this property if neither the guarantor or the borrower can keep up with the borrower's mortgage repayments.\n\nIf your parents are happy to be your guarantors, this could be a good alternative for you but you must make sure you are able to keep up with all payments.\n\nDavid Hollingworth, of mortgage broker London and County, said: 'A lender would usually expect a guarantor to be a parent or close family member and to see that the child would be likely to be in a position take on the mortgage in their own right in the foreseeable future, for example a trainee professional that can't quite borrow enough but can expect to see income progression after qualification.'\n\nA lender would usually expect a guarantor to be a parent or close family member and to see that the child would be likely to be in a position take on the mortgage in their own right in the foreseeable future David Hollingworth - London and Country\n\nHe advised that some lenders including Hinckley & Rugby Building Society, Family Building Society and Leeds Building Society may be able to consider a guarantor on their standard rates but much will depend on the individual circumstances.\n\nAnother option would not be the traditional guarantor approach but instead lenders might consider having a parent as a joint borrower on the mortgage.\n\nHollingworth added: 'Usually a joint borrower would be expected to be joint on the property ownership which could have consequences for the stamp duty and potential Capital Gains Tax liability for the parent.\n\n'As the parent owns their own home the 3 per cent surcharge would be payable and first time buyer relief lost in that scenario.\n\n'However a growing number of lenders can now offer what's often known as joint borrower, sole proprietor \u2013 that essentially means the ownership is in the first time buyer's name only but the mortgage can have parent and child as applicants.\n\n'That avoids the stamp duty and CGT issues and still enables the parent's income to be factored in for affordability purposes.\n\nThere's a host of lenders that may consider this option, including Metro Bank and Barclays.\n\nSavings account\n\nCurrently, your savings are in your Post Office savings account which only has an interest rate of 0.24 per cent.\n\nThis is something you should definitely switch as there are accounts with much higher rates of interest.\n\nYou can get a rate of two per cent or more by fixing for a year, earning potentially hundreds more in interest - even the best easy access deals pay 1.5 per cent.\n\nTake a look at our best savings rates table to find an account that works for you.\n\nBroadband and mobile\n\nAlthough you are currently paying \u00a326 a month for your broadband with Sky, which is not that over the top, you could still be on a much cheaper deal that could help you save a significant amount of money over time.\n\nFor example, Onestream, are offering average speeds of 11Mbps on their Flow Unlimited Broadband deal for just \u00a313.99 a month - nearly half what you are paying now.\n\nMonthly breakdown How much this 29 year-old had in her accounts each week of the month: Week 1: \u00a3501.21 Week 2: \u00a3391.79 Week 3: \u00a3226.58 Week 4 (after payday): \u00a31,103.90\n\nAssuming you share the cost equally between you and your two housemates, you will be paying \u00a34.66 a month - \u00a355.96 a year.\n\nAs you share equally the bills now, you are paying \u00a39 a month - \u00a3108 a year - saving you an additional \u00a352.04. Whilst this may not seem like a lot, every little really does help.\n\nYou are also paying \u00a310 a month to Giffgaff - again a small amount but there are much cheaper Sim only deals out there.\n\nIf you don't use much data, you could opt for a Sim only deal with Lebara, which offers 1GB of data, unlimited texts and 500 minutes for just \u00a34.95 a month - saving you \u00a360.60 a year.\n\nHowever, if you use more data, you can still get a Sim for \u00a37 a month with iD mobile that comes with 2.5GB of data, unlimited texts and 1,200 minutes. This would still save you \u00a336 a year.\n\nUsing a price comparison site should help you find a deal that is right for you.\n\nShopping\n\nYou are by no means an extravagant spender and, on the whole, you have stuck to within your budget.\n\nHowever, there are some anomalies, for example an expenditure of \u00a345 at Jigsaw, a high end High Street store and a payment of \u00a382 from your credit card at Bimba y Lola, another pricey clothing shop.\n\nAltogether this cost you \u00a3127 - just over eight per cent of your take home salary.\n\nWant to take part?
