The operation was launched Oct. 9 in northern Syria to secure Turkey\u2019s borders and remove terrorists from northern Syria while ensuring Syria\u2019s territorial integrity.\n\nErdogan said they agreed to ban separatist movements from Syria\u2019s terror-free zone.\n\nBy noon Wednesday, \u201cthe People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG) and their weapons will be taken out of the terror-free zone and their positions will be dismantled,\u201d Erdogan added. \u201cThe YPG will retreat 30 kilometers (19 miles) within 150 hours, and then Turkish-Russian joint patrols will be launched in the area 10 kilometers (6 miles) into Syrian territory.\u201d\n\nBoth presidents agreed to commit to \u201cthe preservation of the political unity and territorial integrity of Syria and the protection of Turkey\u2019s national security\u201d in a joint memorandum.\n\nUnder the deal, joint efforts will also be launched to help return refugees safely and voluntarily.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, the Iraqi government said U.S. forces do not have its permission to conduct military operations from within its borders.\n\nThe announcement came one day after the Pentagon said American efforts had moved there from Syria.\n\nU.S. forces withdrew from Syria two weeks ago at the direction of President Donald Trump, which was followed by a Turkish incursion that targeted Kurdish fighters in the northeast. The U.S. military said last weekend troops would be re-stationed in Iraq to monitor terrorist activity in Syria and added Monday that the shift had begun.\n\nThe government in Baghdad answered Tuesday by saying American forces can\u2019t stay.\n\n\u201cAll U.S. forces that withdrew from Syria received approval to enter the Kurdish region so that they may be transported outside Iraq,\u201d the government said in a statement. \u201cThere is no permission granted for these forces to stay inside Iraq.\u201d\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper previously said he\u2019d spoken with Baghdad officials about the plan to shift U.S. troops to Iraq.\n\n\u201cThe aim isn\u2019t to stay in Iraq interminably,\u201d he said Tuesday. \u201cThe aim is to pull our soldiers out and eventually get them back home.\u201d\n\nThe United States has a small force of about 5,000 troops in Iraq, mostly in training and advisory roles.\n\nTrump\u2019s withdrawal in Syria was widely condemned as a betrayal to Kurdish forces, with whom the Pentagon was previously allied to fight the Islamic State terror group in Syria.\n\nThe five-day cease-fire between Turkey and Kurds in Syria expires at 10 p.m. Tuesday, the Turkish Defense Ministry said. So far, 136 Kurdish vehicles have left the \u201csafe zone\u201d that Turkey wants to establish along its border with Syria. Turkey considers the Kurds a terrorist group.\n\n\u201cThe activities of terrorist elements are controlled through radars and UAVs day and night,\u201d said Lt. Cmdr. Nadide \u015eebnem Aktop, Defense Ministry spokeswoman.\n\nAktop added that while Turkey abides by the terms of the agreement with the United States, the YPG terrorists have violated it 42 times.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and other Republicans introduced a resolution opposing the Trump administration\u2019s decision to pull out of northern Syria. It calls for an immediate halt to the withdrawal. \u201cThe Senate needs to speak up. We cannot effectively support our partners on the ground without a military presence.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithdrawing from Syria will invite more of the chaos that breeds terrorism and creates a vacuum our adversaries will certainly fill,\u201d McConnell said on the Senate floor Tuesday.\n\nThe House passed a similar measure last week with only 60 representatives voting against it. McConnell also said they could impose sanctions on Turkey for its invasion of Syria that occurred after U.S. forces started leaving.", "description": "Oct. 22 (UPI) \u2014 Ankara and Moscow have reached a \u201chistoric\u201d deal to create a terror-free zone in northern Syria, the Turkish government", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
