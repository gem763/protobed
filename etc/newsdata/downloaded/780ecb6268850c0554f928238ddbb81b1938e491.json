From multiple arrests to sexual assault allegations, there hasn\u2019t been much positive news on the former UFC double champion.\n\nHowever, credit has to be given where credit is due. In early October, McGregor donated a hefty amount of cash to a little girl struggling with a serious health condition. The Irish Mirror was first to report the donation, which can be seen on the GoFundMe page set up to help pay for treatment.\n\nAccording to the GoFundMe page, 1-year-old Evie Nolan was born with a rare genetic disorder as a result of a mutation on her CASK gene. She is missing a large part of her X chromosome, and as a result has a rare condition called microcephaly with pontine cerebellar hypoplasia.\n\nAccording to the report, McGregor\u2019s involvement stems from a donation of autographed gloves by Team McGregor to Crumlin Boxing Club. When the gloves were sent for an auction, McGregor was asked if he would match the highest bidder. \u201cThe Notorious\u201d obliged.\n\nThe gloves sold for \u20ac12,000 (nearly $13,400 USD) and McGregor allegedly matched with \u20ac12,000 more of his own.\n\nThe GoFundMe campaign initially sought to raise \u20ac60,000 but has earned more than \u20ac103,000 (nearly $115,000 USD) to date.\n\nAs for the specific day-to-day issues McGregor\u2019s donation will help with, the GoFundMe page description states the following:\n\n\u201cEvie has spent many day/nights in hospital. Evie requires physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech & language therapy. Evie\u2019s condition is so rare and not by any means curable, with very little knowledge in Ireland, we looked into a lot of research to try and get our little girl the care she needs.\n\n\n\nFound a doctor, an assistant professor in Virginia and the leader of perhaps the only research team in the world, that explores the role of the cask gene in neurological disorders. His team research has shown the aggressive \u201cburst\u201d therapy helps these patients significantly improve their development, for that reason we have decided to enroll for this program , in order to obtain the best for Evie. It\u2019s a 4 week program, with very intense therapy. Evie shows so much promise already and I know this will give her the best chance in life.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was not by any means a publicity stunt from McGregor, as he did not even want to be mentioned,\u201d Evie\u2019s mother, Emma Nolan, told The Irish Mirror. \u201cWe can\u2019t thank Conor enough for helping our little girl.\u201d\n\nThe Blue Corner is MMA Junkie\u2019s blog space. We don\u2019t take it overly serious, and neither should you. If you come complaining to us that something you read here is not hard-hitting news, expect to have the previous sentence repeated in ALL CAPS.", "description": "In early October, Conor McGregor donated a hefty amount of cash to a little girl struggling with a serious health condition.", "authors": ["Nolan King", "The Blue Corner", "Mike Bohn", "Abbey Subhan", "John Morgan", "Matt Erickson", "Simon Head"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/conor-mcgregor-scrum-arrivals2-tbc.jpg?w=640&h=420&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
