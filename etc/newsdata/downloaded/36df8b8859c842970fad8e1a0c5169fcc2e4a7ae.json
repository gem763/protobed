It\u2019s still a hardware name to be sure, but it\u2019s also a software name. It\u2019s even becoming a recurring revenue platform.\n\nThis paradigm shift didn\u2019t even come close to staving off a huge setback in August. CSCO stock fell from its July peak near $58 to last month\u2019s low around $46, with most of the selloff sparked by lackluster guidance for the quarter now underway. Headwinds in China also concerned shareholders.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe dip is ultimately an opportunity to step into a misunderstood and undervalued name.\n\nCSCO Stock Undervalued, Underappreciated\n\nThe post-earnings response was understandable.\n\nCisco stock was already fighting a losing battle, peeling back from its July peak after announcing its intent to acquire Acacia Communications (NASDAQ:ACIA). Despite topping earnings and revenue estimates for the three-month stretch ending in July and pumping up the top line by 6%, earnings guidance of between 80 and 82 cents per share for its first fiscal quarter of 2020 wasn\u2019t the 83 cents analysts were modeling. Sales growth could also be flat for the quarter underway, following a 25% tumble in the previous quarter\u2019s China-driven revenue. Though the top end of Cisco\u2019s guidance was 2%, it was still short of consensus projections of 2.5%.\n\nThe steep 20% selloff, however, largely ignores the fact that Cisco stock is now trading at 18.7 times its trailing earnings and only 13.6 times its forward-looking income.\n\nThere are cheaper stocks out there, but there aren\u2019t cheaper stocks out there like CSCO. Indeed, even the usual valuation measures don\u2019t apply without a footnote. In this case that footnote is $33.4 billion worth of liquid assets or outright cash sitting on Cisco\u2019s balance sheet, versus its market cap of $201 billion.\n\nThe valuation also doesn\u2019t reflect the fact that, although it\u2019s been occasionally uneven thanks to new competition from the likes of Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR) and Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET), Cisco hasn\u2019t failed to produce some level of profit in any quarter for over a decade. That includes the 2008 recession prodded by the subprime mortgage meltdown.\n\nAnd that reliability is only poised to improve.\n\n\n\n\n\nCisco Embraces Subscriptions\n\nThe company has arguably touted the idea more than it\u2019s mattered yet. Nevertheless, recurring revenue is a key part of its new business model.\n\nFor the record, it\u2019s actually been a piece of the Cisco strategy as far back as 2017. That\u2019s when the tech giant launched its first-ever subscription-based product leveraging its Catalyst 9000 networking platform. But, CEO Chuck Robbins explained in March that recurring revenue should make up 30% of the company\u2019s total business within the next three years.\n\nTo that end, as of the recently ended quarter, software subscriptions made up 70% of total software revenue. Applications and services only accounted for a little more than one-third of Cisco\u2019s total business.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear if the company\u2019s fiscal trajectory is on pace to reach the goal. The paradigm shift within the technology arena favors Cisco exceeding that goal rather than falling short of it.\n\nOne only has to look at the evolution of cloud computing to see renting rather than owning is the new norm. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has built a multi-billion dollar business on the premise of providing access to remote servers to organizations that don\u2019t want a giant server bank on-site, or can\u2019t afford the cash needed to outright buy a data center.", "description": "More than once over the past couple of decades, networking giant Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) has been lumped in with other hardware stocks, and rightfully so.
