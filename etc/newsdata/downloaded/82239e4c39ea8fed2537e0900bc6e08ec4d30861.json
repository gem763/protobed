They explored Mainland, Orkney\u2019s largest island, as well as North Ronaldsay, a three-and-a-half mile spit of land (population approximately 50) rich in farmland, marram grass, seaweed-eating sheep and Neolithic ruins. They also met with the Orcadian furniture maker Kevin Gauld and the sculptor Frances Pelly, both of whose work is deeply bound up with the islands\u2019 history and landscape.\n\nThe New Craftsmen\u2019s co-founder and creative director, Catherine Lock \u2014 who travels across Britain in search of potters, textile designers and other artisans to highlight at her Mayfair showroom \u2014 has long been inspired by Orkney\u2019s culture, and commissioned the first piece she sold at the gallery, a collaboration between Gauld and Neal, on the archipelago seven years ago. Since then, the pair\u2019s beautifully austere straw Brodgar chair has been a consistent best seller, with more demand than Gauld can answer.\n\n[Sign up here for the T List newsletter, a weekly roundup of what T Magazine editors are noticing and coveting now.]", "description": "One London gallery is determined to continue the tradition embraced for centuries by the Orkney chain.", "authors": ["Deborah Needleman"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/09/t-magazine/09tmag-orkneys-slide-SMRG/09tmag-orkneys-slide-SMRG-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
