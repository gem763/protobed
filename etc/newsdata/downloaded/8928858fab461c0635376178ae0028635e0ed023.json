On set, there were a lot of chocolates, flap jacks and treats flying around.\u201d\n\nThere has been much praise for Katie's portrayal, as Sinead died while her husband Daniel Osbourne was reading a bedtime story to their son Bertie.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: Sunday Mirror)\n\nKatie herself took to Instagram after the heartbreaking episode to share her last words about the character she had played for seven years.\n\nShe shared a photo of her character and captioned it: \"Sinead Osbourne, for nearly 7 years since you first walked the cobbles @coronationstreet, you have been such a massive part of my life..\n\n\"It\u2019s been a rollercoaster of a ride, highs, lows, a crash, broken back, proposals, weddings, pregnancy, abortion and now devastingly cancer... [sic]\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"For Sinead to be leaving this way means EVERYTHING to me! Raising so much awareness for cervical cancer, cancer in young people and cancer in/around pregnancy... It\u2019s been a pleasure, privilege and honour to work alongside such talented people; producers, writers, directors, cast, crew...absolutely every single person at Coronation Street, I will miss you so much! #RIPSineadOsbourne #sineadtinker #corrie #sinead #cervicalcancer.\"\n\nSinead's death had also been difficult for Katie's co-star Sally Dynevor to watch.\n\nThe Weatherfield legend had battled breast cancer in the past and the soap veteran of 32 years found it an uncomfortable reminder of her personal past.\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nThe 56-year-old had found a lump in 2010 and was diagnosed with cancer but after chemotherapy treatment, she was given the all-clear.\n\nSpeaking to The Mirror previously, Sally said: \"I just can\u2019t watch it. I think they\u2019re doing a \u00adbrilliant job, so brilliant it makes me not want to watch it.\n\n\"Only because it\u2019s self-preservation. I don\u2019t need to keep going there.\"\n\n(Image: Mandatory Credit: WENN.com)\n\nShe added: \"Even now it\u2019s all mixed up in my head. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve dealt with it about who this has \u00adhappened to. I still do have the fear. I don\u2019t think it ever goes. It stays with you.\n\n\"It does get better but it\u2019s always there at the back of your mind.\"\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
