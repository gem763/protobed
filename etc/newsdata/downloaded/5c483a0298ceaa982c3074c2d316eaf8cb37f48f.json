Conservatives are calling him out for his apparent refusal to protect President Donald Trump at the same time as liberals tear into him at any flicker of pro-Trump sympathies.\n\nMy 17-month old son just walked up and asked \"Dad, how could the leader of the entire Senate Judiciary Committee go missing right after promising us investigations, hearings, and subpoenas?\"\n\n\n\nI honestly have no idea how to respond #WheresLindsey \u2014 Jack Posobiec \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@JackPosobiec) October 22, 2019\n\nIf only @LindseyGrahamSC were head of the Senate Judiciary Committee #WheresLindsey \u2014 \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8America First Stacy (@Discoveringme40) October 22, 2019\n\n#WheresLindsey was trending among right-leaning users on Twitter after Fox News host Tucker Carlson and Senator Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) pounced on Graham\u2019s \u201ctotal inaction\u201d on Monday, dragging the senator for his failure to get to the bottom of the \u2018Russiagate\u2019 sham.\n\nTucker Carlson takes on Lindsey Graham on \"empty promises\" he keeps making to take on Trump impeachment. Graham is ducking the interviews, but Sen. Rand Paul jumps in and demands interviews with key players: did Dems do what they're accusing Trump of? Where is the oversight? pic.twitter.com/82f9lPFAAb \u2014 (((Jason Rantz))) on KTTH Radio (@jasonrantz) October 22, 2019\n\nCarlson mused that Graham\u2019s neocon foreign policy tendencies \u2013 as shared by his former Senate pal John McCain before the latter\u2019s death \u2013 might mean his loyalty is more to the \u201cdeep state\u201d than Trump. While Graham hasn\u2019t climbed aboard the impeachment express alongside some of the more anti-Trump members of his party, he hasn\u2019t outright condemned that faction either, and at least one news outlet has tipped him as one of the senators likely to turn on the president.\n\nSeemingly getting the message that Republicans were tired of his shenanigans, however, Graham rushed to back the president, who had called Democrats\u2019 impeachment fervor a \u201clynching\u201d on Tuesday. \u201cThis is a lynching in every sense,\u201d Graham agreed \u2013 only for liberals to accuse him of \u201cKlansplaining.\u201d\n\nLINDSEY GRAHAM Klansplaining to us about how the treatment of Trump is a lynching in every sense of the word.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Bill Taylor is testifying and over half of Americans think Trump should be impeached and removed. So, he's trying to distract us with racist language. Again. https://t.co/oEJ6l89Jud \u2014 Holly Figueroa O'Reilly (@AynRandPaulRyan) October 22, 2019\n\nlindsey graham continues the long, proud tradition of white men from south carolina downplaying lynchings https://t.co/RFrY1t1NU2 \u2014 Bobby Lewis (@revrrlewis) October 22, 2019\n\nI\u2019ve seen some Potomac two-steps before, but holy cow. https://t.co/Fuycs7t31J \u2014 Congressman Tim Ryan (@RepTimRyan) October 22, 2019\n\nDemocrats vocally yearned for the days when Graham could be counted on to join McCain in condemning Trump\u2019s anti-interventionist tendencies, their jaws dropping to see Graham, at least, claim to support Trump\u2019s moves in Syria.\n\nAlso on rt.com Ditch the Kurds, grab the oil? Trump says US \u2018never committed\u2019 to Syrian allies, but SecDef says Washington still committed to oil\n\nTrump, too, has called for his party to show some loyalty, calling on Republicans to \u201cget tougher and fight\u201d on Monday. \u201cI think the Democrats fight dirty. I think the Democrats are lousy politicians with lousy policy,\u201d he said, but at least \u201cthey stick together. They don\u2019t have Mitt Romney in their midst.\u201d Should Trump start to worry that they have Lindsey Graham?\n\nLike this story?
