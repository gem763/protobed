So I like to work with design teams who become collaborators.\"\n\nBut some of his home decor decisions keep him up at night, he admitted.\n\n\"We [Lauren and I] argue [about fabrics] all of the time, but then we love the same things, like lighting and symmetry,\" he laughed.\n\n\"Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and take her downstairs and go, 'I think I know why I hate this room!' and I'll drive her crazy.\"\n\n(Image: REX/Shutterstock)\n\nHe admitted the LA place had taken a lot of blood, sweat and tears to get it up to his demanding standards.\n\n\"When I moved here, the house was uncomfortable and the garden looked like a desert. Now we have millions of flowers, so it smells nice and birds and insects come in.\"\n\nEven so, this year's Celebrity X Factor hopefuls must have felt more than a little on edge as they were asked to wait in Simon's bedroom before performing in his garden.\n\nThe head judge set up a temporary stage among the tropical flowers where the contestants got to show off their vocals, but nerve-wrackingly they had to stay in the most intimate room of the luxury house before it was their time to shine.\n\n*The X Factor: Celebrity continues tonight at 8.30pm on ITV", "description": "Simon Cowell will tonight welcome his celebrity singers to his gorgeous \u00a318million Malibu mansion, which overlooks the Californian coastline", "authors": ["Emmeline Saunders", "Image", "Itv", "Rex Shutterstock"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20605454.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_SycoThames.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
