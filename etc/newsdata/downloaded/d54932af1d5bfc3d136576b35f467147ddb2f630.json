The Washington Post reports Nelson sold five counterfeit tickets for $400 each to a man near the ballpark just before Friday\u2019s third game between the Washington Nationals and Houston Astros.\n\nAn arrest affidavit obtained by the paper says police found the victim after he caught up with Nelson and another man. The second man paid back $1,300 and left, but Nelson and the victim were arguing when police arrived.\n\nCourt records show Nelson pleaded not guilty in D.C. Superior Court and was released pending a November hearing.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Washington Post, http://www.washingtonpost.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Police in Washington have arrested a West Virginia man accused of selling $2,000 in fake World Series tickets.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
