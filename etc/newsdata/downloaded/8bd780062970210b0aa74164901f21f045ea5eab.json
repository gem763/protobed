I'm not sure I'd take bets on it right now - I really have no idea.\u201d\n\nMr Flewitt said it \u201cisn't going to fundamentally undermine\u201d McLaren if there are tariffs on cars into Europe as he outlined his lack of concern about what happens six to 12 months after a no-deal Brexit.\n\nHe added: \u201cBut on day two and day three if we're struggling importing parts, if we're struggling exporting cars, if our employees are really concerned because they don't know what's going on, that kind of uncertainty could cause disruption for some weeks - and that's really not good.\n\n\u201cFor an independent company like us, you disturb our cash flow, you disturb our employee base, it'll have very, very serious ramifications.\n\n\u201cWhat we really need is some certainty, some thinking. We need to know what's going to happen.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

If I don't earn the money, I won't be investing.\n\n\u201cIf I'm not investing, that has a cumulative impact on jobs, on buying parts from suppliers, on the success of the company, on taxes we pay on everything.\u201d\n\nMr Flewitt also said he \u201chates the idea of a no-deal Brexit\u201d due to the lack of clarity anyone can offer, describing it as \u201cno-deal with no understanding of the consequences of no-deal\u201d.\n\nHe also said: \u201cThe politicians need to lead us.\n\n\u201cFine, if the country has mandated that we leave, and that's what we decide to do, but then their job is to make sure the rules, the guidelines, the processes are in place to manage that exit in an orderly way - not to damage, not to undermine the country because we didn't manage it well.\n\n\u201cIf the outcome isn't a great one that's a consequence of the fact we had a referendum and we voted to leave.\n\n\u201cBut for the consequence to be a damaging one because we don't manage it properly, that's downright irresponsible - and it won't just be supercars.\n\n\u201cYour headlines won't be 'McLaren can't build supercars on 4 November.\n\n\u201cIt'll be we can't get medicines, we can't get food, we can't get clothes, the chaos that could ensue - because there won't be a differentiation between this component and that component coming in, cross-border trade - that's the bit I think is irresponsible, to lead us into that.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Brexit uncertainty just weeks before the Halloween deadline is \u201cquite shocking\u201d and a no-deal exit could have \u201cvery, very serious\u201d short-term ramifications, according to McLaren.
