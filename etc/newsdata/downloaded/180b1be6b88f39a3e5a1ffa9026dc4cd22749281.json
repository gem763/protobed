From gogo bars, to massage parlours, karaoke joints, and brothels, the land of smiles is also very much the land of sex. And \"ladyboys,\u201d as they\u2019re known to foreigners, are seen as a culturally unique part of Thailand's sex trade.\n\nBut who are these people? Most foreigners rarely question how trans people get into sex work, or why.\n\nTo find out I headed for Bangkok's bars, where I found a trans woman named Earth willing to talk. Earth is a 22-year old who describes sex work as liberatingly lucrative, despite the significant stigma and danger attached.\n\n\u201cI went to university and graduated with an accounting degree,\u201d Earth explained beneath the pulsing lights of the bar. \u201cBut even then I still couldn't find a job anywhere. Even with my degree, employers kept rejecting me almost immediately. It became clear that I didn\u2019t have a lot of options, so my mother sent me to hairstyling school.\u201d\n\nAfter working at the salon for some time, Earth decided she simply wasn\u2019t making enough money and began contemplating making a shift to sex work. She had friends who'd transferred to sex work and they encouraged her to do the same.\n\nOutside a dressing room at a gogo bar\n\nFor many transgender people in Thailand, the question is this: why work eight to 10-hour days in a cafe, salon, or restaurant, only to struggle to make ends meet? It\u2019s hard enough to find work as a trans person in Bangkok, even when you're earning peanuts. So Earth decided to give sex work a shot.\n\n\u201cI got into this type of work to provide for my family. Not just my parents, but for my grandparents as well. It\u2019s important for us to know that we can provide for ourselves. We don\u2019t need to rely on anyone else anymore. We make our own money. This job allows that to happen.\u201d\n\nIt's clear Earth is intelligent, but even with a strong work ethic and smarts, transgender people have a hard time making a liveable wage in Thailand. And as in most countries, simple economics turns them to prostitution, even if the sex industry is completely unregulated.\n\nRyan Figueiredo, Founder and Executive Director of Equal Asia (EQUAL AF), an inclusion advocacy organisation, says it\u2019s incredibly important that the rights of trans sex workers are not overlooked, even though sex work is illegal. \u201cThe biggest challenge for the LGBTQ community in Asia is ensuring that no one is left behind,\" he told me. \"This includes transgender persons, refugees, persons who sell sex, persons who use drugs, the disabled, the elderly, and others. Our call for action shouldn't be limited to a small set of civil rights for the privileged in our community, but a broader push for sexual citizenship.\"\n\nIn 2016, a study titled Same Same But Different was the first to properly unpack the experiences and dangers for thousands of trans sex workers operating in Thailand. The study compiled material through 60 interviews with transgender sex workers, providing a basis for understanding the unseen vulnerabilities, exploitation, and often physical and sexual abuse transgender sex workers endure on a regular basis.\n\n\n\nResearchers found that 81 percent of interviewees turned to sex work due to financial desperation. They also discovered that transgender sex workers were uniquely vulnerable to physical and sexual violence, finding two-thirds of interviewees admitted to being victims of sexual violence within the past year, and one in four had been raped.\n\nWhen I raised these stats, Earth told me about an experience she'd encountered. It was a guy she agreed to meet who already had a bad reputation in the community. The client wasn\u2019t known to use physical violence, but was instead suspected of intentionally spreading HIV by nipping the top of condoms with a knife. \u201cHe would fold and then cut the tips of the condoms to spread the disease, \u201d she explained, demonstrating how he made the cut with a paper receipt. Then, after sex, she noticed the condoms they'd used were neatly cut across the top. Terrified, she quickly left the room.\n\nAfter the incident, she immediately visited an anonymous clinic to get the pre-HIV exposure prophylaxis known as PrEP. Since then, she\u2019s become incredibly cautious and inspects every condom before use. \u201cIt was really scary, because I knew he would get away with it. I couldn\u2019t go to the police without fear of them coming after me for my work,\u201d she explained.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that it\u2019s not only transgender sex workers who experience marginalisation in Thailand. Transgender people in general are persecuted, despite Thailand\u2019s image of being a LGBTQ safe haven. Thailand is often seen as a beacon of inclusivity for the LGBTQ community, especially in comparison to places like Brunei\u2014where the death penalty was recently implemented for anal sex, then rescinded due to international pressure\u2014or in parts of Indonesia\u2014where they still carry out whippings and canings for breaking Sharia laws. But the trans community in Thailand still say they are not truly accepted, just tolerated.\n\nThe stigma and marginalisation that accompanies working in the sex industry effects boys and men as well, said Celeste McGee, founder of Dton Naam, an organisation that focuses on boys and transgender sex workers. \u201cMany cultures view females as 'more vulnerable', whether that implies a belief that girls have a weaker physique, a more timid logic, an expected sensitive persona, or some other contrived fragile flaw,\u201d she told me. But she said this isn't the case at all\u2014and that boys, men, and LGBTQ sex workers are just as susceptible to abuse.\n\n\u201cIn a way, boys and transgendered people are actually more vulnerable than girls because they are both so ignored,\u201d she said. But despite the stories of abuse, Earth doesn\u2019t want that to be the image of her work, and she doesn\u2019t want to be pitied either. Although she has plans to save money and open up her own beauty salon one day, she recognises that sex work as an important mode of survival; a temporary phase where she can be proud to not only support herself, but her entire family.\n\n\u201cI know a lot of foreigners look down on us and don\u2019t like what we do,\" she says. \"But I want them to know that we\u2019re also trying to provide for our families as best as we can. Our work shouldn\u2019t be looked down on. We do it to support our ourselves and our families.\u201d\n\nFollow Caleb on Twitter", "description": "\u201cI got into this type of work to provide for my family.
