A busy road in Manila's Malate tourism and entertainment district was closed due to the rescue efforts.\n\n\"It's sad but we can't do anything, everybody tried their best,\" Moreno told reporters, adding rescuers moved rapidly but carefully due to the building's fragility.\n\nPolice are investigating the collapse, which Moreno said prompted him to order guests in an adjacent budget motel to leave the building for safety reasons.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
