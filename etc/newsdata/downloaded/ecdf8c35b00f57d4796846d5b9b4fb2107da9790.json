He was bang on when he spoke to me and with his quotes [suggesting he could request a move in January] when he was away with France.\n\n\u2018He shouldn\u2019t be happy and accept not playing. That\u2019s what good players do. I think, as I said to Oli, he will get his games and be a big influence for us.\n\n\u2018At the moment, because of how Tammy is playing, there hasn\u2019t been the minutes, so I would happily sit down with Oli in January. But that is a long way away. I want him here.\u2019\n\nGiroud insisted over the international break that he would work hard to win back his place in the starting XI but also refused to rule out requesting a move away from Stamford Bridge.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m going to fight for my place at Chelsea, the coach knows it,\u2019 Giroud said.\n\nGiroud believes he still has plenty to offer Chelsea (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018After, we will make a decision in January. If you ask me if I want to leave, not necessarily.\n\n\u2018But [\u2026] I can not settle for what I have today in Chelsea.\n\n\u2018I have some beautiful years in front of me. I\u2019m 33, I still have legs and I have a body that will allow me to play a few more years. I have a healthy lifestyle and I feel good physically.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018I want to have fun and play more games. Chelsea is my priority but if I am forced to make a choice, I will do it like when I left Arsenal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018He [Lampard] will almost certainly watch the matches [I just played for France]. In any case, I am going back to Chelsea pumped up.\u2019\n\nGiroud scored twice in two games for France but was still confined to the bench on Saturday as Chelsea beat Newcastle 1-0.\n\nAbraham was once again preferred up front, but afterwards he paid tribute to the influence of his deputy on his own game.\n\n\u2018I just take those little things that I see in training,\u2019 Abraham said.\n\n\u2018If the ball is coming into the box off the ground, his volleying and everything is on point, so you have to take those little things and add them to your game.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m a visual learner. I like to watch and take people\u2019s ideas.\u2019\n\nMORE: Olivier Giroud fires warning to Chelsea boss Frank Lampard", "description": "Chelsea could allow Olivier Giroud to leave the club in January if Tammy Abraham continues his goal-scoring form.", "authors": ["James Gray"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1176989839_1571658469.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
