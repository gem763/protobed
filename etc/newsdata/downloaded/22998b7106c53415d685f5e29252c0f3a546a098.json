And yet, on election night, Russian intelligence agents popped bubbly in St. Petersburg and gloated over how they had used Facebook to Make America Great Again.\n\nNow Facebook is under fire for accepting the Donald Trump campaign ad that CNN T, +0.43% refused to air, citing its unsubstantiated and apparently false claims about Joe Biden and Ukraine. Naturally, Facebook snapped it right up, prompting charges it hasn\u2019t learned 2016\u2019s lessons and is setting itself up to be used once again.\n\nSo, the dilemma: The Internet, and especially social media, want to be free. The whole beauty of Facebook is that it\u2019s published by essentially everyone, saying anything they want. The downside is that it\u2019s published by basically everyone, a large number (and small percentage) of whom want to spread disinformation, libel anyone they disagree with, even undermine democracy itself.\n\nWhat should Facebook do? What, more importantly, should you do?\n\nSince I\u2019m not a politician, I\u2019ll talk real. Help\u2019s not on the way. Facebook won\u2019t be regulated by Donald Trump and Republicans, both because they don\u2019t control the House and won\u2019t crack down on foreign interference in U.S. elections \u2014 Trump\u2019s impending impeachment might be a clue here.\n\nDemocrats like Elizabeth Warren are so furious about 2016 that their only response to Facebook is to break it up. Which has nothing to do with anything, really.\n\nSo, what can you do?\n\nFirst, you can think.\n\nThe most striking thing about most troll-written and bot-generated content is that it\u2019s amateurish. Much ink is spilled about sophisticated automated armies of Trump, but most of it makes the average e-mail claiming you can have millions of Nigerian naira if you\u2019ll only send thousands of U.S. greenbacks for \u201cexpenses\u201d look pretty smart.\n\nThe moral: If something looks too \u201cgood\u201d to be true, it likely is.\n\nEspecially if \u201cnews\u201d is coming from some off-brand place, consider waiting for it to bubble up through folks who report before they publish. If it\u2019s on Facebook, that\u2019s nice \u2014 so is a lot of junk. Trump\u2019s ad is like this \u2014 it\u2019s a set of lies we\u2019ve all covered.\n\nWe forget so much about 2016, in our partisan fury. Like, we knew about the Russian interference before the election. The secret was out. We knew that much of what was online about Clinton was garbage. If we believed it, that\u2019s not on Facebook \u2014 it\u2019s on us.\n\nEither way, the election came down to 78,000 votes in three states. It never should have been close enough for chicanery to make a difference (if it did, which is in dispute).\n\nThat\u2019s on us (and former FBI chief Jim Comey\u2019s stop-and-start investigation of Cllinton\u2019s e-mails). And it won\u2019t be next time.\n\nAs for Facebook, sure, it should change. A little.\n\nThe core of the company\u2019s platform \u2014 letting regular people say what they want on their own pages \u2014 won\u2019t change much. And that\u2019s the vast majority of what\u2019s on Facebook.\n\nThe company has thousands of people reviewing posts every day, which will continue, but reviews are complaint-driven, subjective and scattershot. We all know that content one person doesn\u2019t like will turn up on another person\u2019s page. The answer is to argue with it, or to ignore it. That\u2019s up to each user.\n\nBut screening ads is a far more manageable task.\n\nIf Facebook can collect money for an ad, it can devote the work needed to know what\u2019s in it \u2014 especially for political campaigns, whose public significance is greater than soap commercials\n\nFacebook\u2019s political advertising business is small enough that Facebook considered dropping political advertising. It can manage common-sense, voluntary standards of accuracy and fairness as broadcast networks do \u2014 as it failed to do in this case. Or it can decide it should drop political ads after all.\n\nMostly, controlling the Facebook effect is up to the audience.\n\nA sprawling community will have many voices, some of them will be wrong, and it\u2019s up to us to know the difference. We had dumb, dishonest and gas-baggy neighbors long before we had Facebook.\n\nBut we either trust the marketplace of ideas or we don\u2019t. If we don\u2019t, Putin\u2019s work is already done.", "description": "We either trust the marketplace of ideas or we don\u2019t.
