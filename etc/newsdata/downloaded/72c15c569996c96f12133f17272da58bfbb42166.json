This is reasonable pricing, given the small number of programs available during the first year, and should help Apple gain an initial audience base for its content,\" the analyst added.\n\nExpectations were so low that it made Apple's announcements compelling, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty.\n\n\"First, TV+ pricing is lower than expected and the bundling of 12-months free TV+ with a purchase of most devices creates a competitive advantage in an increasingly crowded streaming video market. Second, Apple didn't raise prices relative to comparable product launches last year after several years of price increases,\" Huberty said.\n\n\"AAPL is a top pick heading into 2020,\" she added.\n\nHere's what else analysts are saying about Apple's updated product line:", "description": "Major Wall Street analysts loved Apple's refreshed product unveiling which featured a new lower cost iPhone.", "authors": ["Michael Bloom"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105946387-1559583971975rtx6xs4u.jpg?v=1559584044", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
