A wearied public has reached the point of no return. From now on, it is far more likely that each new feigned outrage will have the opposite effect of helping Trump and hurting his accusers. After all, we are now reduced to Representative Adam Schiff (D., Calif.) supposedly reading the transcript of the Trump phone call, but instead making things up as he does, editorializing, and adding and subtracting, as he pleases, from what was actually said. And when caught, Schiff can only stammer that as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee he was actually offering a \u201cparody\u201d of the supposed grounds-for-impeachment document.\n\nIn this entire melodrama Biden will become the real casualty, and Trump the benefactor, at least in the long term.\n\nWhen the entire nature of the whistleblower, his handlers, and his media enablers is fully known, when attention turns, as it already has, to Biden\u2019s real legal exposure, two things will follow:\n\nBiden will get snappy, befuddled, and indignant to questions, to the extent he will even entertain them \u2014 all the while losing ground to Elizabeth Warren. Trump will be the eventual beneficiary of Warren\u2019s more likely and more alienating candidacy. And, even if impeached, Trump will be perceived, rightly or wrongly, as growing stronger for enduring ever shriller and more monotonous attacks.", "description": "", "authors": ["V.D.
