The remaining \u00a31.5bn from the VED would be spent on maintaining major roads.\n\nRebecca Newsom, head of politics at Greenpeace UK, said: \u201cWith bus use declining, this proposed fund for free bus travel is exactly the sort of vision needed to make public transport a more viable option for people across the UK, helping reduce emissions at the same time.\n\n\u201cOur government should put its money where its mouth is, instead of committing billions to policies which will increase road use and emissions and worsen the climate emergency.\u201d\n\nThe party would also increase corporation tax to 24 per cent and spend the extra revenue on funding local authorities by \u00a310bn a year, it says.\n\nIt claims the funding would help local authorities maintain roads and deliver more bus services, which have become 65 per cent more expensive to use over the past decade.\n\nAir pollution is currently linked to the premature death of 40,000 Britons a year and the Free Bus Fund would also be topped up by saving from reduced health costs due to less pollution on roads, the party says.\n\nFree bus travel would be implemented in England but not in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland as this is a devolved issue.\n\nThe news comes days after the Green party also said it would ban adverts for petrol or diesel cars and flights across Europe. The move would use the same powers that enabled Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, to ban junk food adverts on the London Underground.\n\nDeputy leader Amelia Womack said: \u201cExcessive flying harms our health just like smoking and advertising only increases this harm. The climate emergency will cause 250,000 additional deaths year from 2030, comparable in number to deaths caused by smoking.\u201d\n\nThe Green New Deal legislation would also look at ways to cut consumption of meat and single-use plastic.\n\nCaroline Lucas, a former Green leader, said adopting the deal was \u201cessential\u201d to avoid environmental and political breakdown.\n\nShe said: \u201cIf we are to mend our broken democracy and give people hope for their future, we must invest in an economy where we live sustainably, differently and more equally.\u201d", "description": "The Green party wants to scrap\u00a0the Conservatives\u2019\u00a0\u00a36.5bn\u00a0plans for new roads and will instead use the cash to fund free bus travel for all.
