Probably illegal!\u201d Trump tweeted Tuesday.\n\n\u201cSomeone tell the President of the United States that he can afford to help pay for the extra time our officers will be putting in while he\u2019s in town,\u201d responded Frey, a first-term mayor who has frequently ripped the president.\n\nTrump campaign manager Brad Parscale Bradley (Brad) James ParscaleMORE said Tuesday that the Target Center had backed off canceling the event over the costs and that the rally would go forward as planned.\n\nThe fight has roots in the Trump campaign's history of unpaid bills to local municipalities after campaign events. But Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign's communications director, asserted that Secret Service, not the campaign, coordinates on any additional security needs and dismissed Frey's comments as political grandstanding.\n\n\u201cYou tell me what the motivation is here after the guy\u2019s been tweeting about how the president isn\u2019t welcome,\u201d Murtaugh said.\n\nTrump seems to be landing in enemy territory with the Twin Cities visit.\n\nHis Target Center rally will take place in the congressional district of Rep.

All four are U.S. citizens of color; Omar is the only one born outside the United States. She is a refugee from Somalia.\n\nA \u201csend her back\u201d chant directed at Omar during a North Carolina rally also drew heavy criticism for the president, and all eyes will be on Minneapolis to see if it is used on Thursday.\n\nAt the same time, Trump narrowly lost Minnesota in the 2016 presidential election, and it is one of just two or three states won by Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonTrey Gowdy joins Trump's legal team Support for impeachment reaches highest level in Fox News poll Trey Gowdy out at Fox News amid talks to join Trump defense team MORE that Republicans think Trump might be able to flip in 2020.\n\nTrump lost the state by just 1.5 percentage points in the 2016 election.

So the fact that he\u2019s willing to go to Minnesota this early is a very strong indicator that we think we can win Minnesota,\" said Tim Murtaugh, the communications director for the Trump campaign.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrump has sought to elevate Omar and make her one of the faces of the Democratic Party. It\u2019s a strategy he\u2019s expected to employ in Minnesota, as Omar is less popular statewide than in Minneapolis.\n\n\u201cIf Democrats are going to win in Minnesota they need to present a moderate image. Trump undermines that by elevating very liberal Democrats,\u201d said Alex Conant, a GOP strategist who worked on presidential campaigns for Sen.

Tim Pawlenty (R).\n\nOmar's campaign sent out a fundraising email on Wednesday urging supporters to donate to her campaign ahead of the president's appearance in her home district.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t imagine what hateful, xenophobic lies he\u2019ll feel emboldened to spread when he\u2019s right in her district,\u201d the email stated.\n\nConant said it will be an \u201cuphill climb\u201d for Trump to win Minnesota, noting that Democrats in the state outnumber Republicans.\n\nBut Trump lacked the unified GOP support in 2016 that he benefits from now, Conant noted, and the president could be further aided if Democrats tack too far left heading into next year's election.\n\n\u201cThe sort of Democrats that tend to win statewide tend to look more like [Gov. Tim] Walz or [Sen. Amy] Klobuchar than [Massachusetts] Sen. [Elizabeth] Warren or Omar,\u201d Conant said. \u201cSo I think by going into Rep. Omar\u2019s district, he can paint the contrast that he needs if he\u2019s going to win.\u201d\n\nIn taking on Minneapolis and its mayor, Trump is adding to the municipalities with which he has feuded.\n\nTrump has in recent months gone after the congressional representatives and local leaders of Baltimore, Dayton, Cincinnati, Oakland and San Francisco, seeking to paint urban centers as decaying and floundering under Democratic leadership.\n\nThursday also will mark Trump's first rally since House Democrats launched a formal impeachment inquiry late last month.
