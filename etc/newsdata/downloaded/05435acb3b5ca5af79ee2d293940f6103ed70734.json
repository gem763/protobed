Infantile Spasms - also known as West Syndrome - is a form of epilepsy that occurs in 1 in 2,000 children. The seizure condition is typically detected in the first year of life. IS can be difficult to diagnose because the seizures are often hard to notice and often only last about a second or two. During a spasm, the body stiffens suddenly, the back may arch, and the arms, legs and head may bend forward. They commonly occur right after a baby wakes up and often come in clusters, with each spasm five to 10 seconds apart.\n\n'Happy birthday to our baby sister. We will celebrate you today and every day,' Miguel shared on Instagram sharing a picture of Adelaide as a newborn in the hospital.\n\nKelly opened up about her heartbreak reeling with the loss of her daughter in a blog post on Friday.\n\n'No amount of flowers, food, alcohol or words can fill the gaping void left in Adelaide\u2019s absence, and right now, I don\u2019t want it to. This week, I was reminded of the words of another warrior mama whose son, Seth, also has a neurodegenerative disorder and maintains her own well-written blog. Many of of her posts hit home but there is one in particular that I keep coming back to: \"Sit with me in the dark,\"' she shared.\n\nMiguel is taking a break from his titular role in the Chicago production of Hamilton but intends to return to the stage.", "description": "Hamilton star Miguel Cervantes and his wife Kelly held a Celebration of Life service on Sunday for their three-year-old daughter Adelaide who tragically died last week.", "authors": ["Marlene Lenthang For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/02/19973452-0-image-a-60_1571623195279.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
