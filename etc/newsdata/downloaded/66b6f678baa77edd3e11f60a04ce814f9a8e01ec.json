Technically, the show wasn\u2019t inside the theater; instead, guests \u2014 including Hadid, her love interest Tyler Cameron, and three Euphoria cast members \u2014 gathered outside at what looked like a movie set re-creating a street corner in Harlem in the \u201970s. Onstage was a full band and at least a dozen singers, some on faux stoops and some in vintage Cadillacs. Things kicked off with the sounds of Bobby Womack\u2019s \u201cAcross 110th Street,\u201d and the band had everyone from Jameela Jamil in the front row to the guests in the nosebleeds dancing in their seats. Which is impressive, considering it\u2019s hard to simultaneously record the runway show in front of you and dance at the same time.\n\nThe clothes mirrored the playlist. Model after model strutted past, looking like the cast of a \u201970s period piece. Leather bell-bottoms, snakeskin vests, and giant gray, leopard-print coats paired well with the voluminous hairstyles and oversize clear sunglasses. Toward the end, things got more modern, with black tulle dresses and a deep-burgundy velvet suit decorated with rhinestones. More is more: more tubas, more hair, more leather! The casting was great, too \u2014 Ashley Graham, Halima Aden, and Winnie Harlow all walked. Others grooved down the runway in platforms.\n\nWhile it was clearly a blowout, this TommyXZendaya show was similar in scale to last season, which channeled Studio 54 and ended with Grace Jones in a blazer and a leotard. And while the fashion set would be happy to go to a TommyXZendaya party every season, all good things must come to an end. Just before the show, Tommy Hilfiger announced that this would be the last collection with Zendaya and stylist Law Roach, whom he\u2019s partnered with for two seasons. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to hold anything back tonight,\u201d Hilfiger said in the statement. The three took their bow together, to the tune of \u201cMove on Up\u201d by Curtis Mayfield.\n\nSee it all \u2014 from backstage to the front row \u2014 below.\n\nPhoto: Landon Nordeman\n\nPhoto: Landon Nordeman\n\nPhoto: Landon Nordeman\n\nPhoto: Landon Nordeman\n\nPhoto: Landon Nordeman\n\nPhoto: Landon Nordeman\n\nPhoto: Landon Nordeman\n\nPhoto: Landon Nordeman\n\nPhoto: Landon Nordeman\n\nPhoto: Landon Nordeman\n\nPhoto: Landon Nordeman\n\nPhoto: Landon Nordeman\n\nPhoto: Landon Nordeman\n\nPhoto: Landon Nordeman\n\nPhoto: Landon Nordeman\n\nPhoto: Landon Nordeman\n\nPhoto: Landon Nordeman\n\nPhoto: Landon Nordeman\n\nPhoto: Landon Nordeman\n\nPhoto: Landon Nordeman\n\nPhoto: Landon Nordeman\n\nPhoto: Landon Nordeman\n\nPhoto: Landon Nordeman\n\nPhoto: Landon Nordeman\n\nPhoto: Landon Nordeman\n\nPhoto: Landon Nordeman\n\nPhoto: Landon Nordeman\n\nPhoto: Landon Nordeman", "description": "Tommy Hilfiger and Zendaya staged an epic runway show at the Apollo Theater in Harlem.
