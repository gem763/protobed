This compared with a growth rate of 10.4% in the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe owner of Mumm champagne, Absolut vodka and Martell cognac said that despite an uncertain environment, it was keeping its forecast for a 5-7% organic rise in full-year profit from recurring operations after last year's 8.7% growth.\n\nIn the first quarter alone, sales growth reached 6% in China compared to 27% in the year-ago quarter, reflecting notably a decline in Chivas sales due to challenging market conditions.\n\nMartell cognac sales in China benefited from a price rise but sustainable inventory management weighed on volumes, said Pernod.\n\nIts United States arm fared better and made a good start, delivering 6% sales growth in the first quarter.\n\nPernod Ricard is under pressure from U.S. hedge fund Elliott, which has a 2.5% stake, to improve profit margins and corporate governance.\n\nIn February, Pernod vowed to lift its margins and shareholder returns under a three-year strategic plan that Elliott has described as a first small step.\n\nEarlier this month, Pernod Ricard said it would cut about 280 jobs through a voluntary redundancy programme as part of a plan to merge its two French distribution subsidiaries Ricard and Pernod.\n\nThe company also said it would sell the Cafe de Paris sparkling wine brand and its Cubzac production site to InVivo Wine. = 0.9030 euros)", "description": "UPDATE 1-Pernod Ricard Q1 sales growth slows as China and India decelerate", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/general-use-news-image3_800x533_L_1412758447.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
