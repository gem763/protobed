Almost two million children in England live in food poverty and one in three are overweight or obese by the time they leave primary school, Unicef said.\n\nGlobally almost 200 million children under five are malnourished, mostly due to poverty and deprivation, while 340 million suffer from hidden hunger in the form of vitamin and mineral deficiencies.\n\nPoor children are carrying \u201cthe greatest burden of all forms of malnutrition\u201d, the agency said, stressing that only one in five children aged six months to 23 months from the poorest families \u201cis fed the minimum recommended diverse diet for healthy growth and brain development\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Central Africa Republic is one of the countries with severe levels of child malnutrition.

The way we understand and respond to malnutrition needs to change: it is not just about getting children enough to eat; it is above all about getting them the right food to eat. That is our common challenge today.\u201d\n\nThe survival and physical and cognitive development of children is threatened by what Unicef described as \u201ca triple burden of malnutrition\u201d, a combination of undernutrition, hidden hunger from nutrient deficiencies, and obesity among children under five.\n\n\u201cAn increasing number of children and young people are surviving, but far too few are thriving because of malnutrition,\u201d the agency said.\n\nIn south Asia 50% of children are undernourished or overweight. The malnutrition rate in east and southern Africa is 42%, and in west and central Africa the rate stands at 39%.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Unicef has warned that iron deficiency reduces children\u2019s ability to learn.

Most wasting cases, Unicef said, are in Asia, with wasting affecting more than one in seven children under five.\n\n\u201cThe number of stunted children has declined in all continents, except in Africa, while the number of overweight children has increased in all continents, including in Africa,\u201d the report said.\n\nObesity is rapidly rising among children and young people around the world, driving early outbreaks of type 2 diabetes. At least 40 million children over the age of five are overweight. From 2000\u20132016, the number of overweight children aged five to 19 has doubled from one in 10 to one in five.\n\n\u201cTen times more girls and 12 times more boys in this age group suffer from obesity today than in 1975,\u201d the agency said.\n\nPoorest children in the UK are twice as likely to be obese compared with those from the wealthiest backgrounds. So-called \u201cfood swamps\u201d \u2013 areas abundant in high-calorie, low-nutrient, processed foods \u2013 are disproportionately concentrated in deprived areas. In England, less than one in five children aged five to 15 eat five portions of fruit and vegetables a day and the poorest areas have five times more exposure to fast-food chains and corner shops.\n\nIn the UK, Unicef said 1.2 million people living in deprived areas are in what it calls \u201cfood deserts\u201d, neighbourhoods without healthy and affordable food options.\n\nThe agency expressed concern about the rising use of breastmilk substitutes: globally only two in five children under six months are being exclusively breastfed.\n\nThe sale of breastmilk substitutes worldwide rose by 41% from 2008\u20132013, and by 72% in upper middle-income countries such as Brazil, China and Turkey. Globally, 44% of children aged six to 23 months are not fed fruit or vegetables, and 59% don\u2019t eat eggs, dairy, fish or meat, Unicef said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A mass breastfeeding protest at an Extinction Rebellion demonstration in London.

Just 100 giant firms dominate 77% of global sales of processed food. \u201cClimate shocks, loss of biodiversity and damage to water, air and soil are worsening the nutritional prospects of millions of children and young people, especially among the poor,\u201d said the report.\n\nIn Bangladesh alone, up to 19 million children are on the frontline of climate disasters.", "description": "Unicef report finds poorest children at greatest risk, while price of healthy food in rich nations drives food poverty", "authors": ["Saeed Kamali Dehghan"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2b110bddfeddc669bef5843d23ae2b2a5d3e6bf/0_282_5315_3189/master/5315.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9039dd3cf41e3ba33cb83528fda80c3d", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
