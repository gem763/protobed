Pictured in June\n\n'What's a no-brainer is I'll definitely be coming to Australia. I think that's going to be the middle of next year,' Louis said of his upcoming Walls promotional tour.\n\nAiming to speak directly to his fans, Louis added of the songwriting process: 'My fans already know a lot about me, but by the time they listen to the record, hopefully they'll know a bit more.'\n\nLouis also went on to reveal what he misses most about his days in One Direction - a band formed on the British version of The X Factor in 2010.\n\nThe group initially consisted of Louis, Niall Horan, Liam Payne, Harry Styles and Zayn Malik, with Zayn leaving in 2015 to embark on a solo career.\n\nPlans: 'I think that's going to be the middle of next year,' Louis said of his upcoming Walls promotional tour, in an interview with The Daily Telegraph's Stellar magazine\n\n'The buzz from writing a great song and sharing that experience together, doing the shows... I definitely miss that the most,' Louis told Stellar.\n\nMeanwhile last month, Louis admitted on Australian radio show Smallzy's Surgery, that he and his band-mates used to spread fake news while on tour.\n\nLouis cheekily said they often pranked Niall, 26, by lying about his sex life to reporters.\n\n'When I was in One Direction, sometimes we just used to make up different people that Niall had slept with on tour, I think we'll just go with that!' he confessed.\n\nFond memories: Louis also said he misses 'the buzz from writing a great song and sharing that experience' with his One Direction band-mates.
