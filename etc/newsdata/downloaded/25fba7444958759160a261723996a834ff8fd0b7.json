The most likely result of the prime minister\u2019s defeat seemed to be a snap election, either just before or sometime after the Oct. 31 Brexit deadline. That is, in one sense, encouraging: Democracy, in the form of a national vote, is the best way out of Britain\u2019s deepening crisis. But voters could be offered an unpalatable choice between a Conservative Party seemingly bent on a radical rupture with the E.U. and a Labour alternative committed to a socialist revolution. Either could do far-reaching damage to Britain\u2019s economy.\n\nMr. Johnson brought this on with his reckless attempt to deliver on his pledge that Britain would leave the E.U. at the end of next month, \u201cdo or die.\u201d Knowing that Parliament had rejected the terms for departure negotiated by the previous government \u2014 which E.U. leaders insist are not subject to change \u2014 and that there was also no majority for a no-deal Brexit, the new prime minister sought to preserve the latter option by forcing Parliament into recess for five weeks, beginning next week. He claimed he intended to use the threat of a sharp break to negotiate new terms with Brussels by late October. And yet E.U. leaders and Conservative Party dissidents said this week that Mr. Johnson had advanced no new proposals.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe suspicion that Mr. Johnson was trying to force a no-deal exit on an unwilling country, which according to government estimates would have to live with shortages of food and medicine in the aftermath, helped prompt a remarkable number of Conservatives to turn against the government, including several longtime cabinet ministers and Winston Churchill\u2019s grandson. They did so knowing that their votes could end their political careers. It was a rare display of principled integrity in a parliamentary scrum that has seen both Mr. Johnson and his opponents transgress norms of procedure and rhetoric. Opponents described Mr. Johnson\u2019s parliamentary suspension as a \u201ccoup,\u201d while others warned that the opposition\u2019s unusual vote to strip control of the parliamentary agenda from the government set a dangerous precedent.\n\nThe jousting is likely to continue as Mr. Johnson seeks to hold an election before Oct. 31, or otherwise find a way to complete Brexit by that date, and Labour tries to force an extension of the exit deadline to early next year before agreeing to an election date. It\u2019s hard to wish either party success; both appear committed to policies that would be bad for Britain.\n\nRead more:\n\nSebastian Mallaby: Brexit, lies \u2014 and a new birth for British democracy?\n\nMegan McArdle: Boris Johnson is presiding over Britain\u2019s stupidest hour\n\nJennifer Rubin: Boris Johnson\u2019s populist playbook implodes\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: Boris Johnson\u2019s reckless path is bad for Britain\n\nAnne Applebaum: 21 British Conservatives put country over party.
