The discovery was made by the Exeter Office of Cotswold Archaeology who are working with Kier Construction to record remains of the city's Roman history ahead of the construction of a new bus station and leisure complex\n\nThe council said that archaeology work at the site, between Bampfylde Street and Cheeke Street, would not affect the construction timetable\n\n'This discovery of yet another new Roman \"fort\" within the city does demonstrate, along with that of the fortress and baths back in the 1970s and of several other new major military sites in the last decade, just how pivotal a role the Exeter area played in the first decades of the Roman conquest and subjugation of Britain, and how crucial development led archaeology has been in revealing this.'\n\nThe council said that archaeology work at the site, between Bampfylde Street and Cheeke Street, would not affect the construction timetable.\n\nA Roman fortress was established in Exeter in around AD55, with a civilian town later established there as the regional capital of south-west England.\n\nThe fortress and its bathhouse were discovered under the Cathedral Green in the 1970s and more recent work has uncovered other finds in the city.\n\nA Roman ditch was first uncovered, with further excavations revealing two further ditches running parallel to each other. These belong to a new and previously unknown Roman military site, which was either a fort occupied by a military unit, or a defended compound\n\nA Roman fortress was established in Exeter in around AD55, with a civilian town later established there as the regional capital of south-west England but it is not yet known how the latest discovery fits in\n\nExeter and Devon as a whole is a hotspot for Roman finds as the Empire occupied the south-west region of the UK for centuries\n\nThe present bus station was constructed in the early 1960s and experts say Roman relics would have been unearthed at the time but may not have been recorded\n\nThe dig and findings were unearthed at the site of the Exeter bus station. Further excavations as part of the redevelopment of the area revealed the Roman fort\n\nThese include large buildings, forts and military depots.\n\nDerek Evans, of Cotswold Archaeology's Exeter office, said: 'The unexpected nature of this discovery and the significance of uncovering previously-undocumented Roman military features in this area of the city, have made this a challenging and interesting project.\n\n'We look forward to undertaking further analysis of the finds and other material recovered during our works and refining the story of the site's history.'\n\nThe present bus station was constructed in the early 1960s and experts say Roman relics would have been unearthed at the time but may not have been recorded.\n\nDerek Evans, of Cotswold Archaeology's Exeter office, said that the discovery is unexpected and the significance made it an interesting project", "description": "The find was made by the Exeter office of Cotswold Archaeology, who are working with Kier Construction ahead of the construction of a new bus station and leisure complex.", "authors": ["Press Association", "Joe Pinkstone For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/26/14/18966946-0-image-a-20_1569506266170.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
