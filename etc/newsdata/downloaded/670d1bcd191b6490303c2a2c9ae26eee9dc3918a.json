The raid was part of a major operation targeting properties in Plymouth, Gloucester and South Wales in order to catch the heads of seven major drugs gangs.\n\nOfficers arrested Nicholas Evans after finding a gun, heroin and \u00a320,000 in cash during a raid on his home in Plymouth, Devon, in November last year. Pictured, preparing for the raid\n\nAt the house of seemingly 'normal family man' Nicholas Evans, the team uncovered \u00a320,000 in cash (pictured), some drugs and a gun\n\nThe arrest team found a gun Evans had hidden in one of his house's drawers. For investigators, the guns, drugs and money found at his residence prove he is a highly organised drug lord\n\nThey found an unknown amount of drugs at Evan's house, including cocaine and marijuana\n\nDI Bartholomew explained: 'We get one opportunity to arrest the individuals that we need. So it has to be in a very short period of time and it has to be very effective.\n\n'They [his team] have to be prepared for whatever or whoever they find on the other side of the door.'\n\nDI Barholomew told how Evans presented himself as a 'normal family man' but in reality was one of the biggest heroin suppliers in the South West.\n\n'Many of them [dealers] live a chaotic, transit lifestyle, however, there will be individuals, particularly at the head of those gangs, who do live a more settled lifestyle,' he said.\n\nOfficers learned that there might be a child staying at the property with Evans, and had to change their approach to the raid\n\nThe Regional organised crime unit perform several raids in one evening in hope of arresting the heads of seven drugs gangs\n\n'Nicholas appears to be a normal family man, however he is one of the main suppliers for heroin in the Plymouth and South West area.'\n\nAs officers approached Evans' residence, they learnt there might be a child inside the property, which led to a change in approach.\n\nInstead of busting the front door, officers entered through the back door and find a groggy Evans in his underwear in the kitchen.\n\nElsewhere officers found a gun in one of the drawers and a line of heroin on the kitchen counter. There was also a list of what appeared to be heroin dealers.\n\nOne officer adjusts their gear before the raid. Officer have to be ready to face whatever and whoever might be waiting for them of the other side of the doors\n\nDI Andy Bartholomew talked through the raid and explained it's a race against the clock to arrest the criminals and collect enough evidence to send them to jail\n\n'That evidence is vital to us,' Bartholomew explained, ' because it goes toward our argument that this man is a high level, highly organised heroin supplier.'\n\nHe added: 'It is vital that we move quickly, because things like mobile phones, money and drugs don't generally tend to last long whence the criminals are aware of our presence.'\n\nThe raid was made possible because police had intercepted one of the gang's main couriers, a man named Raymond Lee.\n\nOfficers found 5kg (11lbs) of heroin with a street value of \u00a3500,000 in the back of Lee's car after pulling him over.\n\nEvans was arrested and charged with conspiracy to supply class A drugs. He was convicted following trial at Newport Crown Court. He was remanded in custody and is awaiting sentencing.\n\nTwo officers await orders. They only have one chance to catch the criminals they are after, Andy Bartholomew explains\n\nDI Bartholomew oversees the operations from the police's headquarter in Newport. He knows the raid has to be very effective\n\nPolice Raids: Caught by Surprise returns next Wednesday at 9pm on Channel 5.", "description": "Officers arrested drug kingpin Nicholas Evans after finding a gun, heroin and \u00a320,000 in cash during a raid on his home in Plymouth, Devon, in November last year.", "authors": ["Claire Toureille For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/21/20054350-0-image-a-58_1571776639935.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
