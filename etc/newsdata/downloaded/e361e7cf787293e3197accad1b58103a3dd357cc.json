Kieran Culkin gives us all the inside deets on season 2!", "language": "en", "text": "Cape Town - Season 2 of Succession, currently #3 on Rotten Tomatoes\u2019 list of the Best TV Shows of 2019 So Far and #7 on IMDB\u2019s list of the Most Popular TV Shows, is now streaming first on Showmax in South Africa.\n\n\n\nThe bitingly funny HBO drama follows the dysfunctional Roy family, who control one of the biggest media and entertainment conglomerates in the world. With patriarch Logan Roy ageing and ailing, his four adult children jockeyed for position throughout Season 1 but as Season 2 picks up, the Roys are struggling to retain control of their empire in a rapidly changing media landscape\u2026\n\nEarlier this year, the HBO drama won Best International Series at the BAFTAs and TV Program of the Year at the American Film Institute, on the way to winning Emmys for Jesse Armstrong\u2019s screenwriting and Nicholas Britell\u2019s main title theme music.\n\nKieran Culkin (Igby Goes Down, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, and yes, Home Alone) was nominated for the Golden Globe as Logan\u2019s youngest son Roman Roy; Matthew Macfadyen (aka Mr Darcy in Pride & Prejudice) was up for a Critics Choice Award as his brother-in-law-to-be Tom.\n\nThe impressive cast includes Golden Globe nominee Brian Cox (Adaptation, X-Men 2, Deadwood) as Logan, Screen Actors Guild nominee Jeremy Strong (The Big Short) as Kendall, and multi-award winners like Hiam Abbas (Ramy, Blade Runner 2049) and Sarah Snook (The Dressmaker), not to mention Nicholas Braun (10 Things I Hate About You, Perks Of Being a Wallflower) as the scene-stealing Cousin Greg and Oscar winner Holly Hunter, who joins the cast in Season 2 as Rhea Jarrell, the CEO of a rival media giant.\n\nWe recently caught up with Kieran to find out more:\n\n\n\nHow would you describe Roman?\n\nEarly on, the one character choice I made was that Roman\u2019s the kind of guy who walks into any room and feels comfortable in it. He\u2019ll make himself comfortable even if he\u2019s being made to feel otherwise.\n\nIs Roman the funniest character?\n\nThere\u2019s an underlying comedy to most of the show. He might get more jokey things because he\u2019s the kind of guy who will just say what comes to his mind, no matter how repulsive or offensive it might be. Most of the time he starts his sentences without having any idea where it\u2019s going to go.\n\nIs Roman ambitious?\n\nHe is. He\u2019s driven to a certain degree, and really wants that job \u2013 but he doesn\u2019t know what the job is! He doesn\u2019t even know how to learn how to do that job. He thinks he can blag it. \u2018If you give me the job, trust me, it\u2019s going to be great.\u2019 He\u2019s lived his whole life like that. To a certain degree, I think that\u2019s a good quality, to run a business this way. I mean, not really, it would be a disaster. But in a few years, after a few steps, I think he could. As he says in the first season, \u2018I\u2019m dumb but I\u2019m smart. I know there are problems, but I don\u2019t know how to fix it \u2013 but somebody can fix it.\u2019\n\nHow does Roman evolve in Season 2?\n\nWhat I\u2019ve learned about him, and he\u2019s learned about himself a little bit, is how actually resilient he is. People think he\u2019s kind of a dum-dum. Maybe he doesn\u2019t quite know all the stuff. But he can take a beating, take a good lashing and just bounce right back and he\u2019s fine\u2026 without it having to be a great big drama. \u2018Nothing\u2019s too serious, nothing really matters, nothing really has consequences \u2013 so, fuck it, I\u2019m just going to keep going!\u2019 Which is a lot of fun to play.\n\nWhy is Succession such a success?\n\nIt really all starts with the writers, what they come up with and their brilliant dialogue. Jesse [Armstrong, the creator] has a really good bullshit-ometer: it\u2019s really sensitive and really on-point. He can\u2019t help but be funny, but it must make sense \u2013 be a real thing that they would say. Sometimes we\u2019ll do things in rehearsals that are funny, but he says, no, that\u2019s not what would happen. He\u2019s got the right sensibility.\n\nThe socio, cultural and political resonances help?\n\nIt sure can. There is something about this that feels right for now...\n\nBinge Seasons 1-2 first on Showmax in South Africa.", "description": "Season 2 of Succession is now streaming first on Showmax in South Africa and we've got all the inside deets!", "authors": ["Kevin Kriedemann"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7970/af553807a79e4345ba81b1ef5d5c4a29.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
