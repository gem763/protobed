Wade, the 1973 decision declaring a constitutional right to abortion.\n\nDown syndrome is a genetic disorder where a person is born with an extra chromosome. Symptoms include cognitive impairment, slower physical growth, a flat face, a small head, a short neck and poor muscle tone.\n\nCircuit Judge Alice Batchelder dissented on Friday, quoting from a May opinion where Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas said states have a \u201ccompelling interest in preventing abortion from becoming a tool of modern-day eugenics.\u201d\n\nBatchelder was appointed by President George H.W. Bush, Donald by President Barack Obama, and Chief Judge Guy Cole, who joined Donald\u2019s opinion, by President Bill Clinton.", "description": "A divided federal appeals court on Friday said Ohio cannot enforce a 2017 law banning abortions when medical tests show that a fetus has Down syndrome.", "authors": ["Jonathan Stempel", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
