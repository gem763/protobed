The XRP/USD pair topped near the $0.2618 level and declined below the $0.2600 and $0.2550 support levels. Moreover, the price traded below the $0.2500 support level. It even broke the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $0.2350 low to $0.2618 high.\n\nFinally, the price spiked below the $0.2480 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. However, the $0.2450 support area acted as a strong buy zone. It seems like the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $0.2350 low to $0.2618 high prevented additional losses. A support base was formed near $0.2450 and recently the price recovered above $0.2500.\n\nThe price surpassed a connecting bearish trend line with resistance near $0.2525 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The current price action is positive, suggesting a solid upward move towards the $0.2620 resistance area. The next key resistance is near the $0.2650 level, above which the price could continue to rise towards the $0.2850 and $0.3000 resistance levels.\n\nOn the downside, there is a decent support forming near the $0.2480 and $0.2450 levels. Moreover, there is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $0.2480 on the same chart. If there is a downside break below the $0.2450 support and the 100 hourly SMA, the price could resume its decline. The next key support is near the $0.2350 level.\n\nLooking at the chart, ripple price is showing positive signs above the $0.2480 and $0.2450 support levels. An immediate resistance is near the $0.2550 level. However, the bulls must clear the $0.2620 resistance area to push the price further higher. Conversely, a break below the $0.2450 support might call for a test of $0.2350.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for XRP/USD is slowly gaining pace in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \u2013 The RSI for XRP/USD is now placed nicely above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Levels \u2013 $0.2480, $0.2450 and $0.2350.\n\nMajor Resistance Levels \u2013 $0.2550, $0.2600 and $0.2620.", "description": "Ripple price is slowly rebounding above $0.2500 against the US Dollar, while bitcoin is consolidating.
