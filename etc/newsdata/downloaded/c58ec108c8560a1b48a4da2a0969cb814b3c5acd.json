This technology was jointly developed by the Shenzhen Municipal Taxation Bureau and WeChat\u2019s parent company and Chinese tech giant Tencent.\n\nHypocritical or hyper-critical?\n\nIt could be that CZ is calling out WeChat for hypocrisy over its proclaimed anti-crypto position while implementing blockchain technology. Or perhaps he is heralding WeChat for its use of blockchain technology, despite its official stance on cryptocurrencies.\n\nLittle further information is given, although some commenters have speculated that any blockchain hook-up that WeChat has could be powered by VeChain. According to reports, there have been previous experiments in blockchain technology between VeChain and Tencent.\n\nMeanwhile, Tencent recently admitted that Facebook\u2019s proposed Libra stablecoin would pose a serious threat to WeChat Pay if it launched in China.\n\nAs reported today, China\u2019s President Xi Jinping called for accelerated adoption of blockchain technology in the country calling it a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d for private innovation.", "description": "WeChat Pay stores payment receipts on the blockchain, says Binance CEO", "authors": ["Jack Martin"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvNmEyYTVjZjJkMjZiOWJiNWRhMWI1NTE3ZTgwMDVkYzYuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
