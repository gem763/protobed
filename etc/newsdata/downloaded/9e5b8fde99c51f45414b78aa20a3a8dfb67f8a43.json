All while leaving 300,000 district school children in limbo.\n\nThis is not about \u201cjustice.\u201d This is not about the students. This is about teachers, guided by the promptings of union heads, getting more for themselves.\n\nIt\u2019s the second time in seven years Chicago Public Schools teachers have gone on strike.\n\n\u201cWe have not achieved what we need to bring justice and high quality schools to the children and teachers of Chicago,\u201d said Jesse Sharkey, the president of the Chicago Teachers Union, in a statement on National Public Radio. \u201cWe need pay and benefits that will give us dignity and respect. We are on strike until we can do better.\u201d\n\nThing is, a study from the nonprofit Illinois Policy found that what these teachers want would translate into an additional $235 tax burden \u2014 or more \u2014 on each and every property owner in the city. That\u2019s a good chunk of cash. Particularly when \u201cnearly 60% of college-educated Chicago workers earn less than the median Chicago teacher salary of $75,000,\u201d Illinois Policy wrote, citing Census Bureau data.\n\nParticularly when the counter-offer from the city only raises tax burdens on property owners by an average of $13.\n\n\u201cAlso,\u201d Illinois Policy reported, \u201csince the recovery from the Great Recession began in 2009, the median Chicago teacher salary has grown 75% faster than the median salary for all Chicago workers.\u201d\n\nTeachers in Chicago, according to the stats, are already overpaid. They\u2019re already stretching the budgets of the taxpayers who hire them. They\u2019re already making more than the hard-working private sector employees who pay school salaries can afford.\n\nFor teachers to discount facts and figures and instead fly their fancies for more, more, more on the wings of uncompromising unions simply showcases their selfishness. Put it this way: There are massive problems in Chicago\u2019s public schools. These problems have been known and discussed for years. And heads up, teachers \u2014 but they don\u2019t have so much to do with salaries as they do with the city\u2019s problems with broken homes.\n\n\u201cBored, Broke and Armed: Clues to Chicago\u2019s Gang Violence,\u201d The New York Times wrote in December, 2016.\n\n\u201cNearly 33,000 [city] juveniles arrested over last two decades,\u201d the Chicago Tribune wrote in July, 2018.\n\n\u201cChicago\u2019s children caught in the crossfire: Alarming number of minors shot or killed in violence-plagued city,\u201d Fox News wrote in August, 2018.\n\nAnd this, from The Great Cities Institute, a white paper on Chicago\u2019s gang violence that was published in January, 2019: \u201cChicago\u2019s high levels of violence are persisting, suggesting that current approaches need to be readjusted. \u2026 The homicide rate [in Chicago] is strongly correlated with race and concentrated poverty, with 75% of all homicides in Chicago taking place between African Americans, despite the fact that the city\u2019s population comprises a relatively equal number of Blacks, Latinos, and whites. Long-term approaches to Chicago\u2019s persistent homicide problem must address the city\u2019s deep-seated issues of racism, disinvestment and concentrated poverty, as well as the more recent issue of the changing nature of gangs.\u201d\n\nLiberals would make the case that poverty comes from racism, bringing with it the frustration and anger that leads to membership in gangs \u2014 and that the Second Amendment is to blame for gun-related and gang-related violence.\n\nBut the larger truth is that Big Government, such as the Democratic Party craves \u2014 such as the Democrat-controlled city of Chicago advances \u2014 kills the free market; kills individual ingenuity, creativity and desire to accomplish; and, combined with a turn from God and traditional biblical principles, leads to moral, cultural and political degradation, including the disintegration of the family unit. And all that opens the door to violence, growth of gangs \u2014 and, along the way, children who are undisciplined, uncontrolled and unconcerned with formal education.\n\nInto this mess come Chicago\u2019s teachers.\n\nAnd their big contribution to the city\u2019s dropout rate of 20% or so \u2014 which reflects an improvement of 50% from 2004 \u2014 is to demand more pay?\n\nThat\u2019s a me, not thee attitude. That\u2019s a demand that\u2019s all about the teachers; zero about the students.\n\nChicago\u2019s public schools problems are many and varied. But throwing more money teachers\u2019 way and giving higher salaries just for the sake of cooling striking heads, will do nothing to fix the schools. It will simply pacify teachers \u2014 and likely, only for a short while. After all, if striking this time brings in a substantial bump in pay, just think of the money that could be made striking next year.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
