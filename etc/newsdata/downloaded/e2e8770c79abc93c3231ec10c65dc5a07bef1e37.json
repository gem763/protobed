On December 5, the trio are planning a \u201cBio-Haque,\u201d which has us intrigued. On her Instagram, Grimes describes it as \u201ca place where the well-proven anti-aging properties of raving have been distilled into the most potent experience available on the market today.\u201d Which to be honest sounds great, as none of our moisturizers are working in the way they were advertised. \u201cThe leading engineers on the team (Grimes, Nina Kraviz, & SOPHIE) have dedicated their lives to identifying the most rejuvenating qualities of music,\u201d which we believe, having seen the reverse aging that is happening to all of them, and the poster graphic seems to show Grimes\u2019 hands prizing apart a pomegranate, a potent symbol of flesh and blood. Hopefully, what this means is some sort of cross pollination of a rave and art happening, but it could also mean a mass baptism in BB serum. You\u2019ll have to go to find out.
