This is unacceptable at any level of the game and our immediate focus is supporting the players and staff involved. As we are sadly aware, this is not the first time our players have been subjected to this level of abuse and there is no place for this kind of behaviour in society, let alone in football. We will be asking UEFA to investigate as a matter of urgency.\n\nBulgaria fans were twice warned over racist chanting (Picture: Getty)\n\nFormer England and Arsenal striker Wright was furious with UEFA\u2019s apparent inability to deal with racism in the game\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018That says everything you need to know about UEFA,\u2019 he said on ITV Sport\u2018s coverage.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re looking at a stadium where half of it\u2019s closed with banners, that\u2019s done nothing.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s the extent of what they are doing to tackle racism in this country. What we can see is there\u2019s certain people there that have no respect.\n\n\u2018At the end of the day, it\u2019s showing UEFA up for what they are. They\u2019re doing nowhere near enough, and I\u2019m so proud that we\u2019re doing what we\u2019re doing at the moment.\u2019\n\nGareth Southgate on the racist chanting \u2018I have to say that the officials were onto everything very quickly,\u2019 Southgate said after England\u2019s win. \u2018We reported everything immediately when we heard things. We had constant communication with the officials and referee and I was in contact with the players during the first half in particular and then again at half-time. \u2018It\u2019s an unacceptable situation. I think we\u2019ve made two statements really by winning the game but also we have raised the awareness of everybody to the situation. \u2018The game was stopped twice and I know for some people that won\u2019t be enough but I think we as a group were on board with that process.\u2019\n\nWright added: \u2018What you\u2019ve got to understand now is you can feel physically sick.\n\n\u2018You\u2019ve been on a football pitch, you know what it\u2019s like and you have to continue to play through that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018But you don\u2019t now, and that\u2019s what\u2019s good. It\u2019s a great day, whatever anyone says.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a terrible day for Bulgarian people and how they\u2019ve been represented, but it\u2019s a great day with respect of trying to tackle racism.\n\n\u2018You can see from that stand with those banners, which mean nothing.What we\u2019re seeing is a set of fans that do not care and they need educating.\n\n\u2018As a black player, we\u2019ve heard it for many years about walking off. It\u2019s something you do not want to do.\n\n\u2018You need the white players to do that for you, so you can go off together because you are a team together.\n\n\u2018When that can happen, and you see how powerful that is, you can do something.\u2019", "description": "Ian Wright launched a scathing attack on UEFA after Gareth Southgate's England players were subjected to racism during their Euro 2020 qualifier with Bulgaria.
