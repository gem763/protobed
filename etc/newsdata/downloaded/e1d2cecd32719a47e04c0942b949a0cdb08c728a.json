Blanco wrote the poem at the request of USA TODAY to capture the feelings of Latinos after El Paso and to celebrate the pride and resilience of Latinos during Hispanic Heritage Month.\n\nThe mass shooting in El Paso on Aug. 3 was one of the deadliest hate crimes in America against Latinos. Twenty-two people were killed and 25 were injured by a lone gunman who, according to law enforcement, posted a manifesto in an online forum that expressed a desire to kill as many people of Hispanic descent and ethnicity as possible. In addition to reporting on the crime, the victims and the heroes, the USA TODAY NETWORK reported the fear in the Hispanic community, and El Paso Times executive editor Tim Archuleta defended his city in a powerful front-page editorial.\n\nNow, two months after the El Paso shooting, USA TODAY is running Blanco\u2019s poem, which is inspired by the U.S. national anthem, as an opinion piece. The poem is also being made available to the 109 USA TODAY NETWORK news sites and has been translated into Spanish as well. Additionally, there is a video of Blanco reading the poem.\n\nThrough poetry, Blanco seeks to connect communities, advance causes and mark important milestones.\n\n\u201cIn the wake of the violence of El Paso shooting, I felt an urgency to take a hard look at our place as Hispanics in the United States. I wanted to honor the victims and survivors of that tragedy, but I also wanted to celebrate our incredible contributions and historical connections to our nation, as an antidote for the fear and isolation we are feeling and fighting right now,\u201d said Blanco.\n\nThe USA TODAY NETWORK seeks to share the experiences and emotions of our country. Often poetry fills a space left open by other forms of communication. Poetry offers a different way for writers to express their opinions in op-eds for USA TODAY NETWORK.\n\n\u201cBlanco draws attention to the perils and joys of being a Mexican-American,\u201d said Tim Archuleta, executive editor of the El Paso Times. \u201cThis powerful work will hopefully get people to question why so many who have give so much to our country are still faced with questions about their place in America.\u201d\n\nBlanco is the youngest, first Latino, immigrant and gay person to serve as a U.S. presidential inaugural poet. He was born in Madrid, where his family had arrived as exiles from Cuba. His family immigrated to New York City when he was only a few weeks old and eventually settled in Miami. His experiences as an immigrant and growing up among close-knit Cuban exiles in Miami influences his writing as an author in his adult life. Blanco\u2019s books and poems include How to Love A Country, which explores immigration, gun violence, racism, LGBTQ issues and more; Matters of the Sea / Cosas del mar, which reproduces Blanco\u2019s stirring poem presented during the historic reopening ceremony of the United States Embassy in Havana, Cuba on August 14, 2015; and \u201cOne Today,\u201d which President Barack Obama invited Blanco to write and share at his second presidential inauguration.
