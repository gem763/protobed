Instead, the phone registered the silicon pattern underneath the finger. This explains why anyone pressing down on the silicone cover was able to unlock devices, because the sensor would see the same silicon pattern, rather than detect the actual fingerprint.\n\nBut the fingerprint sensor bypass wasn't new. As ZDNet reported earlier today, other users had reported the same bug earlier this year.\n\nA user uploaded a video on Imgur in April, showing how a 3D-printed fingerprint could bypass the same fingerprint sensor.\n\n\"This brings up a lot of ethics questions and concerns,\" the user said at the time. \"If I steal someone's phone, their fingerprints are already on it. [...] Most banking apps only require fingerprint authentication so I could have all of your info and spend your money in less than 15 minutes if your phone is secured by fingerprint alone.\"\n\nSamsung is not alone in dealing with an issue in its biometrics authentication system. Google is facing a similar thing after a BBC reporter revealed that the Pixel 4's new Face Unlock feature works even when a owner's eyes are closed -- opening phone owners to situations when someone could unlock their devices when asleep or out cold.", "description": "Samsung promises software patch next week; recommends not using custom screen covers in the meantime.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/03/04/a2a89799-f8fa-4d51-b5b1-64b91687e8be/thumbnail/770x578/03376087dac31018a01e515eef282eb3/samsung-galaxy-s10-plus-review-4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
