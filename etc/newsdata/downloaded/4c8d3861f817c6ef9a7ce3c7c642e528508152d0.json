(Lucas Nowicki, GroundUp)\n\nStudents at Eastcape Midlands College TVET are accusing the college of failing to use NSFAS and government funding appropriately. They say the college has withheld students' allowances and failed to supply new textbooks, reports GroundUp.\n\nA week ago, a group of students protested outside the college\u2019s Grahamstown campus for two days, burning rubbish outside the entrance. They demanded outstanding NSFAS allowances.\n\nThe students dispersed after management promised them that all allowances would be paid that day.\n\nA week later, the matter is still not resolved.\n\nSRC president Sabelo Madlala said the failure to pay allowances was a \"continuous issue which started in 2017\".\n\nHe said Midlands management had agreed to pay all outstanding allowances by the end of June.\n\n\"There are students who are qualified and did claim, but their allowances have not been paid, so they could not attend classes.\"\n\nNSFAS provides allowances for personal care, travel and accommodation.\n\nWhen students' allowances were delayed, they were often unable to attend classes because they didn\u2019t have money for transport. This could mean that they dropped below NSFAS\u2019s required 80% attendance rate, said Sabelo.\n\nNSFAS funds some TVET students directly, but most TVETs are responsible for distributing NSFAS funds to students.\n\nEastcape Midlands communication officer Kate Oladimeji said: \"The college is in continuous communication with NSFAS regarding progress on payment of bursaries.\n\n\"Students are represented on the college\u2019s Financial Aid Committee [to] ensure transparency.\"\n\nShe said the college \"strictly adheres to NSFAS bursary rules and guidelines\".\n\nBut why allowances had not been received was not explained to GroundUp.\n\nStudents also raised the issue of Midlands reusing old textbooks, some hard to read because they are full of notes from previous students. NSFAS is supposed to allocate funds for new ones for each student. Sabelo said that some students had brought him textbooks where \"you were unable to see the pages because of writing\".\n\nOladimeji said the institution\u2019s Academic Board has reuse of textbooks \"in accordance with the Department of Higher Education and Training\u2019s stipulations\".\n\nNSFAS did not reply to multiple requests for comment.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android or iPhone.\n\nKEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter.\n\n- FOLLOW News24 on Twitter", "description": "Students at Eastcape Midlands College TVET are accusing the college of failing to use NSFAS and government funding appropriately by withholding students' allowances and failing to supply new textbooks.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9164/7b6c7e6fa24b4686bb88d65061604834.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-28"}
