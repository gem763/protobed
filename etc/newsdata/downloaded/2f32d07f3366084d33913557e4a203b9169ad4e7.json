Legislation on pharmaceutical prices is one aspect of the agenda that\u2019s likely to be hindered by the development, Sarah Bianchi, Evercore ISI\u2019s head of U.S. public policy, wrote in a note Tuesday.\n\n\u201cPrescription drug pricing legislation was already likely to be watered down -- or perhaps not pass at all,\u201d Bianchi said.\n\nThat echoed comments from Cowen & Co.\u2019s Chris Krueger saying a potential bipartisan deal on the topic could be \u201ccollateral damage\u201d from impeachment proceedings.\n\nREAD: Merck, Celgene (NASDAQ: ) Drugs Could Be Hit By Democratic Pricing Bill\n\nTo be sure, it\u2019s not clear that Congress and the White House had plans or appetite for working through much if any major legislation in the coming months. On guns, for example, Trump is still undecided on what restrictions he\u2019d back, if any, and Senate Republicans have said they can\u2019t move forward until they know what the president would sign.\n\nAnd despite a bipartisan push for new legislation to rein in the cost of prescription drugs, Republican and Democratic leaders have yet to coalesce around actual policy changes.\n\nHowever slim those legislative chances were, or now are, the White House pounced on the opportunity to fault Democrats for any lack of progress.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 move has \u201cdestroyed any chances of legislative progress for the people of this country by continuing to focus all their energy on partisan political attacks,\u201d White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement. Trump made similar comments via Twitter, calling out gun safety and infrastructure in addition to drug prices as areas where progress might be stymied.\n\nREAD: All You (and Trump) Should Know About Impeachment: QuickTake\n\nBianchi said it\u2019s also possible that ratification of the new trade agreement between the U.S., Mexico and Canada could be affected.\n\n\u201cIt is not clear what happens to USMCA, which has a much clearer path forward through Congress than prescription-drug pricing,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, it does require Speaker Pelosi and President Trump to work closely. If things are strained enough, that work could stop as well.\u201d\n\nREAD: White House USMCA Offer Aims to Resolve Democrats\u2019 Final Doubts", "description": "Evercore Says Impeachment Step May Hurt Drug-Price Deal, USMCA", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic310730e0078474402154944aa1e41066.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
