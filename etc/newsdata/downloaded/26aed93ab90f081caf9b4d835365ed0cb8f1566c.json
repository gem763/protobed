REUTERS/Lucas Jackson\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited Kansas on Friday to give a speech on human rights and carefully avoided saying if he might run for a U.S. Senate seat from the Midwestern state.\n\nThere has been wide speculation that Pompeo might seek a Senate seat both to help Republicans keep control of the chamber and to serve as a possible springboard for a White House run.\n\nPompeo did not address the matter in his speech at Kansas State University in Manhattan, Kansas, but drew laughter as he wrapped it up by saying, \u201cI look forward to taking questions on almost any topic.\u201d\n\nHe did not get asked about a Senate race by the audience but did in interviews with local media.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m serving America and working on President Trump\u2019s team to deliver America\u2019s foreign policy. That\u2019s what I\u2019m focused on,\u201d he told Steve McIntosh of Wichita KNSS according to a State Department transcript.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m flattered when people say Mike will be a good United States senator representing Kansas,\u201d he added, saying he and his wife Susan \u201cmiss our church there in Wichita and all our family and friends.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m doing something that I consider an incredible privilege, an opportunity of a lifetime to lead the State Department, and I\u2019m focused on doing that each and every day.\u201d\n\nBorn and raised in Orange County, California, Pompeo moved to Kansas in 1996, established an aerospace company, and served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 2011 to 2017, when he became director of the Central Intelligence Agency.", "description": "U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited Kansas on Friday to give a speech on human rights and carefully avoided saying if he might run for a U.S. Senate seat from the Midwestern state.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1427006954&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF851PI", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
