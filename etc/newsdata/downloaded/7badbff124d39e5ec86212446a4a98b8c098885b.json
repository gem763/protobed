When Wood was 18, she was \u201cstarved, isolated from friends and family and at one point tied up by her hands and feet,\u201d by an abusive partner according to People. Wood only came forward with her story after finding out that her abuser had victimized other women. A lawyer said she couldn\u2019t press any charges, as the statute of limitations on the crimes done to her had long passed. \u201cI said, \u2018That doesn\u2019t sound right. Something\u2019s wrong, what are my options?\u2019 They said, \u2018Well, you can try to change the law.\u2019\u201d Inspired by that challenge, Wood worked to create the Phoenix Act. The law extends the statute of limitations on domestic violence felonies from 3 to 5 years, as well as requiring police officers to undergo more training on the issue of intimate partner violence. Wood came forward with her survivor story in 2018, releasing a video statement explaining why she wouldn\u2019t name her abuser and testifying before Congress on behalf of the Sexual Assault Survivors\u2019 Bill of Rights. \u201cBad things can happen to you, but you can rise out of the ashes. That is exactly why I named it the Phoenix Act,\u201d said Wood. \u201cI do believe that you can come back from tragedy, sometimes even stronger than you were before.\u201d", "description": "Evan Rachel Wood created The Phoenix Act to help survivors like herself in California.
