From athletes to lottery winners, there are countless stories of big earnings going broke because they don\u2019t know how to keep the money they make.\n\nTo avoid such pitfalls, Kiyosaki\u2019s \u201crich dad\u201d taught his son the number one rule \u2014 \u201cthe only rule\u201d \u2014 for getting and staying rich:\n\n\u2018You must learn the difference between an asset and a liability and buy assets.\u2019\n\nIt may be simple, or even anticlimactic, but Kiyosaki says most people without a proper financial education just don\u2019t get it. \u201cAn asset puts money in your pocket,\u201d he wrote. \u201cA liability takes money out of your pocket.\u201d\n\nThe truly wealthy understand this, Kiyosaki said, while everybody else will likely struggle until and unless they wrap their brains around the concept.\n\nHe used this visual to capture the concept:\n\n\u201cVery simply, the rich invest their money in assets that put more money in their pockets, such as real estate, stocks, bonds, notes, and intellectual property,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe middle class and poor invest their money in liabilities that take money out of their pockets such as mortgages, consumer loans and credit card debt.\u201d\n\nKiyosaki also breaks it down in this short video:", "description": "How can I get rich quick?
