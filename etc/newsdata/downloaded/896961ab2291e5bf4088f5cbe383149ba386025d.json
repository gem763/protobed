It depicts the opening stages of a terrorist attack complete with a title card styled to look and feel like a serious thriller, rather than a slice of light entertainment.\n\nWhile the outfits have changed over the years to reflect the military fashion sense of each game's setting, the essentials of the first-person shooter gameplay have remained the same.\n\nIn campaign mode, the player makes use of variety of weapons to eliminate enemies, and assumes the roles of soldiers from a host of different countries. In that respect, this is vintage Call of Duty.\n\nThe story revolves around recovering chemical weapons stolen from a fictional country: Urzikistan.\n\nBut early on, the action shifts to London in a mission that is surprising in its brutality.\n\nImage copyright Activision Blizzard Image caption Players can switch between a variety of weapons\n\nThe sight of terrorists in suicide vests in Piccadilly Circus will no doubt prove to be controversial in the UK.\n\nOverall the tone is dark, using events inspired by reporting from the real world. A mass execution forming background action in one early mission reinforces that feeling.\n\nThat, combined with using objects such a breeze block as a weapon, makes for a campaign that sometimes feels like this title might be trying a little too hard to be edgy.\n\nAt this stage it is almost pointless talking about how well this game plays. Any developer producing AAA titles should be able to churn out a creditable first-person shooter.\n\nFan favourite features in the campaign mode are all present and correct: there's a cinematic feel to proceedings and the player almost has the sense of participating in an interactive movie, where the action will only progress once they have achieved certain objectives or overcome enemies.\n\nThe weapons feel precise, the action forces you to make each shot count and use cover cleverly and often, but this is what any veteran first-person shooter (FPS) player expects.\n\nIt's the polish and the sky-high production values that separate Call Of Duty from the pack.\n\nImage copyright Activision Blizzard Image caption The new game does not shy away from violent, graphic scenes\n\nOn this front Modern Warfare delivers. It feels like a return to and extension of the universe created in the original trilogy rather a rehash or remake.\n\nBut wherever Call Of Duty goes, controversy is often not far behind. The allusion to real-world events - terrorist atrocities at major landmarks, wars in Middle Eastern countries - doesn't always sit well with the series' action-movie aesthetic.\n\nThe game's developers have told me they want the player to think about some of the issues the title raises.\n\nThis notion is perhaps one that few people would question, were this a movie rather than a video game.\n\nI just wonder how effective a tool of reflection and education on contemporary conflict this experience can be, in a game where the primary activity is shooting stuff.\n\nFollowing criticism over the use of loot boxes in Call Of Duty: Black Ops 4, the new Modern Warfare game will instead use a Battle Pass system, similar to the hit game Fortnite.\n\nHowever, PlayStation-maker Sony has decided not to release Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare on its online store in Russia.\n\nAccording to news site Eurogamer, one level depicts a young girl called Farah who gets caught up in a Russian bombing campaign.\n\nIn a statement, Activision said: \"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare is a fictional game that has been thoughtfully created to entertain fans and tell a compelling narrative.\n\n\"Sony Interactive Entertainment has decided not to sell Modern Warfare on the PlayStation Store in Russia at this time. We look forward to launching Modern Warfare digitally in Russia on 25 October on PC and on console via Xbox.\"\n\nMobile hit\n\nImage copyright Activision Blizzard Image caption Call of Duty Mobile was developed by China's Tencent\n\nThere had been some \"consumer fatigue [in CoD] over the last few years\", said Mr Harding-Rolls.\n\n\"However, Activision is busy diversifying the franchise onto other platforms, especially mobile where Call of Duty Mobile has had one of the strongest openings of a game app ever.\n\n\"As such, the franchise is being exposed to a much broader audience and that may help support sales of the AAA version.\"\n\nThe mobile version of Call Of Duty, released on 1 October, and was downloaded more than 100 million times in a week, breaking records.", "description": "The latest Call Of Duty game arrives following calls to boycott Activision Blizzard's titles.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/E246/production/_109362975_ff10df80-90bf-406a-a698-39f6d7f4c886.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
