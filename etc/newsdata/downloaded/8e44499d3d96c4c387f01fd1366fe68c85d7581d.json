REUTERS/Henry Nicholls\n\nHere are the key comments from the judgment read out by Supreme Court President Brenda Hale:\n\n\u201cThe first question is whether the lawfulness of the Prime Minister\u2019s advice to Her Majesty is justiciable. This Court holds that it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe courts have exercised a supervisory jurisdiction over the lawfulness of acts of the Government for centuries. As long ago as 1611, the court held that \u2018the King (who was then the government) hath no prerogative but that which the law of the land allows him\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis Court has concluded that this case is about the limits of the power to advise Her Majesty to prorogue Parliament.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was not a normal prorogation in the run-up to a Queen\u2019s Speech. It prevented Parliament from carrying out its constitutional role for five out of the possible eight weeks between the end of the summer recess and exit day on 31st October. Proroguing Parliament is quite different from Parliament going into recess.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis prolonged suspension of Parliamentary democracy took place in quite exceptional circumstances: the fundamental change which was due to take place in the Constitution of the United Kingdom on 31st October. Parliament, and in particular the House of Commons as the elected representatives of the people, has a right to a voice in how that change comes about. The effect upon the fundamentals of our democracy was extreme.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo justification for taking action with such an extreme effect has been put before the court.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only evidence of why it was taken is the memorandum from Nikki da Costa of 15th August. This explains why holding the Queen\u2019s Speech to open a new session of Parliament on 14th October would be desirable. It does not explain why it was necessary to bring Parliamentary business to a halt for five weeks before that, when the normal period necessary to prepare for the Queen\u2019s Speech is four to six days.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does not discuss what Parliamentary time would be needed to secure Parliamentary approval for any new withdrawal agreement, as required by section 13 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.\n\n\u201cThe Court is bound to conclude, therefore, that the decision to advise Her Majesty to prorogue Parliament was unlawful because it had the effect of frustrating or preventing the ability of Parliament to carry out its constitutional functions without reasonable justification.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis Court has already concluded that the Prime Minister\u2019s advice to Her Majesty was unlawful, void and of no effect. This means that the Order in Council to which it led was also unlawful, void and of no effect and should be quashed. This means that when the Royal Commissioners walked into the House of Lords it was as if they walked in with a blank sheet of paper. The prorogation was also void and of no effect. Parliament has not been prorogued. This is the unanimous judgment of all 11 Justices.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is for Parliament, and in particular the Speaker and the Lord Speaker to decide what to do next. Unless there is some Parliamentary rule of which we are unaware, they can take immediate steps to enable each House to meet as soon as possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not clear to us that any step is needed from the Prime Minister, but if it is, the court is pleased that his counsel have told the court that he will take all necessary steps to comply with the terms of any declaration made by this court.\u201d\n\nSource of the court summary: www.supremecourt.uk/decided-cases/index.html", "description": "The United Kingdom's Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday that Prime Minister Boris Johnson acted unlawfully when he advised Queen Elizabeth to suspend parliament just weeks before Brexit and that therefore the legislature had not been prorogued.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433483537&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N0OB", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
