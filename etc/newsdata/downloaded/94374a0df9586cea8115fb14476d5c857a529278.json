Thanks to all complaining and defending the free press.\u201d\n\nFarrow added: \u201cI\u2019m sorry to all the Australian readers to whom this story is important too. I hope you can import or buy from an independent bookseller, and avoid outlets that yield to these kinds of intimidation tactics.\"\n\nHoward, who remains a top executive at the Enquirer\u2019s parent company, American Media Inc., has hired several high-powered law firms on three continents, including the Sydney-based McLachlan Thorpe Partners, to suppress Farrow\u2019s book, which chronicles the extraordinary lengths the Australian tabloid muckraker had gone to help his friend, criminally charged alleged serial rapist Harvey Weinstein.\n\nHoward\u2019s Australian lawyer, Andrew Thorpe, wrote to book sellers that his client \u201capprehends the book will contain content defamatory of him, by reason of disclosures made to our client\u2019s US attorney by a \u2018fact checker\u2019 working for Mr. Farrow or the publisher.\u201d\n\nThorpe continued: \u201cIf, despite warning to the contrary, the author and publisher decide to release the book in Australia and if the book contains defamatory imputations against our client, then a legal action will be launched by our client against the author, the publisher and any distributors, seeking damages.\u201d\n\nThe book alleges, among other things, that Howard told Enquirer staffers about Weinstein accuser Rose McGowan, \u201cI want dirt on that bitch,\u201d and that AMI chief executive David Pecker tried to purchase and suppress damaging stories about then-presidential candidate Donald Trump.\n\nWhile Howard has declined to comment on Farrow\u2019s book, an AMI spokesperson claimed its \u201cnarrative is driven by unsubstantiated allegations from questionable sources and while these stories may be dramatic, they are completely untrue.\u201d", "description": "\u201cSome Australian outlets\u2014Booktopia,\u00a0 Amazon Aus\u2014caved and banned it due to frivolous legal threats,\u201d Farrow revealed on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Lloyd Grove", "Editor At Large"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_3505,w_6231,x_201,y_445/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571155763/RTX5XLZR_exb4c5", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
