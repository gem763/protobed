We started with nothing, but look how far we\u2019ve come,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Purja served in the British military for 16 years, including 10 in the special forces, and said he was the first Gurkha to climb Everest while serving. The Queen awarded him an MBE in 2018 for his achievement in extreme high-altitude mountaineering.\n\nHis adventures have also been marked by a series of dramatic rescues, including in 2016 when he broke mountaineering conventions to rescue a climber left in the Everest \u201cdeath zone\u201d, bringing her down from 8,450m to safety alone. She is alive and well, living with her family in India.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Mr Purja and his team went back up the mountain to bring oxygen to an accomplished mountaineer who had been stranded alone for more than 36 hours, taking him down to camp where he was then helicopter lifted to hospital in critical condition.\n\nMr Purja\u2019s team said that in the course of completing his main 14/7 objective, he had achieved another six world records, including the most 8,000m-plus mountains scaled in both a spring and summer season. He shaved his own record for the fastest consecutive summits of Everest, Lhotse and Makalu down to just 48 hours.\n\nMr Purja may be due a well-earned break \u2013 but he isn\u2019t taking much time off to recover. He plans to scale Nepal\u2019s 6,800m Ama Dablam peak to plant a poppy for Remembrance Day on 11 November.\n\nHe paid tribute to the support team that helped him to achieve his record, saying the challenge was \u201cnever just about me\u201d. During the mission, one of his Sherpa guides, Mingma David, was credited with becoming the youngest person on Earth to have scaled all the 14 tallest mountains.\n\nPurja said he hoped the project \u201ccould inspire people from all generations, across the world\u201d.", "description": "A Nepalese adventurer says he has achieved a feat by climbing all the world\u2019s 14 highest mountains in just over six months, beating the existing speed record by more than seven years.
