That\u2019s adding to the attractiveness of the currency for carry-trade strategies, according to UBS Group AG and Kotak Securities Ltd.\n\nWith the world\u2019s pile of negative debt almost doubling to $15 trillion this year, investors are increasingly employing currency-related strategies that allow them to squeeze more yields. Going long on the rupee with borrowed dollars offered the best returns in the past month in Asia.\n\n\u201cThe corporate tax cuts are a response to mounting growth pessimism, and should stem Indian equity outflows,\u201d said Rohit Arora, emerging market Asia strategist at UBS. \u201cThis, in our view, works well enough for the rupee carry trades and lower volatility in the near-term.\u201d\n\nCarry trades work by investors borrowing in a lower-yielding currency, such as the yen or the euro, and putting the money into one with higher rates. Indian sovereign bonds offer the second-highest yields among major bond markets in Asia.\n\nRead: How to use currency forwards or swap markets to profit from negative-yielding debt\n\nStill, growing fears of a global recession have dented risk appetite for emerging markets, with returns from purchasing developing nation currencies with dollars easing since July, according to a Bloomberg index. India is also tussling with its slowest growth in six years.\n\n\u201cDomestic risks abated after multi pronged measures to boost growth made rupee a preferred carry currency,\u201d said Anindya Banerjee, a currency analyst at Kotak Securities. Another trade in vogue is shorting the yuan and going long on the rupee to take advantage of the trade tension risks that the Chinese currency faces, he said.\n\nWhile carry-trade strategies are about playing yield and funding differentials, returns can be wiped out by currency fluctuations if investors don\u2019t hedge their exposure. Traders have pointed to concerns that the Reserve Bank of India may act to restrain rupee gains.\n\n\u201cWe are wary of chasing INR rally at the current juncture for many reasons,\u201d said Rohit Garg, a Singapore-based emerging markets strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE: ). The rupee may weaken to 74 to a dollar by year-end on concerns about the negative fiscal impact of its stimulus measures and the central bank\u2019s concerns about a strengthening rupee, he said.\n\nThe currency has dropped 1.8% against the dollar this year, and closed at 71.04 on Tuesday.", "description": "India\u2019s Corporate Tax Cut Makes Rupee Carry Trade More Lucrative", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic7352f6e442149beeab77506f506080c9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
