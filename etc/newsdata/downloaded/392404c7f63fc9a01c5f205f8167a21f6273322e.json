No one believes that\u2019s possible anymore. After Mick Mulvaney took over as Trump\u2019s third chief of staff last December, he let it be known that his approach would be to \u201clet Trump be Trump.\u201d Mulvaney was simply succumbing to reality. As Trump himself has said, he is essentially the same person today that he was at age 7. He has his story, and he\u2019s sticking to it.\n\nGrowth and development are about seeing more. The wider, deeper and longer our perspective, the more variables we can consider \u2014 and the more capable we become. Likewise, the more responsibility we take for our behaviors, and the less we blame others for our shortcomings, the more power we have to influence our destiny.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNone of this is possible for Trump.\n\nI got to know Trump three decades ago when he hired me to write \u201cThe Art of the Deal.\u201d Although the book became a bestseller, working with him was deeply dispiriting, given his almost complete self-absorption, the shortness of his attention span and the fact that he lied as a matter of course, without apparent guilt.\n\nAfter that, I tried to steer my life in a direction as far from Trump as possible, and the next book I wrote was titled \u201cWhat Really Matters: Searching for Wisdom in America,\u201d an exploration of people who had found success and satisfaction in ways vastly different than Trump\u2019s focus on wealth, power and fame. In 2003, I founded the Energy Project to help leaders and their employees pursue healthier, happier, more productive and more meaningful lives. We\u2019ve helped organizations ranging from Google and Pfizer to Save the Children and the Los Angeles Police Department.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs part of our work, we encourage clients to ask themselves two key questions in every challenging situation: \u201cWhat am I not seeing here?\u201d and \u201cWhat\u2019s my responsibility in this?\u201d These questions emerged from studying developmental psychology. Jean Piaget\u2019s theory of cognitive development describes four increasingly complex stages of thinking that we move through in childhood. As we grow up and become less self-centered, our perspective gets progressively bigger and more complex. Thinkers such as Robert Kegan, William Torbert and Susanne Cook-Greuter have described the potential for further growth as adults. Cook-Greuter\u2019s framework, for example, refers to \u201cnine stages of increasing embrace,\u201d characterized both by deeper and deeper self-awareness and the capacity to take into account a wider world.\n\nThose theories teach us that humility enables learning and growth \u2014 but Trump confuses humility with humiliation and defaults instead to hubris and grandiosity. \u201cI alone can fix it,\u201d he told us when he was nominated for president. On multiple occasions since, describing virtually any subject, he has begun with \u201cNobody knows more about ____ than I do.\u201d\n\nIn reality, Trump\u2019s worldview remains remarkably narrow, shallow and short-term. It\u2019s narrow because he is so singularly self-absorbed, which has been true throughout his life. In the 18 months I worked with him, I can\u2019t remember a single time Trump asked me a question about myself. I never saw him engage for more than a cursory couple of minutes with any of his three young children.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s knowledge and understanding remain shallow because he resists reflection and introspection and struggles mightily to focus. When I set out to interview him for \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d in 1986, he was unable to keep his attention on any subject for more than a few minutes. \u201cI don\u2019t like talking about the past,\u201d he would tell me. \u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d After a dozen interview attempts, I finally gave up and settled instead for piecing the book together by sitting in Trump\u2019s office listening in on his constant stream of brief phone calls.\n\nHis need for instant gratification prevents him from considering the longer-term consequences of his actions. Instead, he simply reacts in the moment. This helps to explain why he moves into overdrive whenever he feels attacked. On Wednesday alone, as the furor around him grew, Trump tweeted furiously, more than 20 times in all. \u201cNancy Pelosi needs help fast!\u201d he declared in one post, after the House speaker walked out of a meeting with Trump that Democrats described as a presidential meltdown. \u201cPray for her, she is a very sick person!\u201d\n\nThe negative qualities we ascribe to others are often those we find it most intolerable to see in ourselves. Throughout his adult life, Trump has viewed the world as a dark, dangerous place teeming with enemies out to get him. In the face of potential impeachment, this fear has escalated exponentially. The threat he imagines is no longer just to his fragile sense of self but, realistically, to his future as president. Any capacity Trump ever had to think clearly or calmly has evaporated. Instead, he\u2019s devolved into anger, blame, aggression and sadistic attacks.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen people enter this \u201cfight or flight\u201d state, the amygdala \u2014 the lower part of our brain known colloquially as \u201cfear central\u201d \u2014 takes over from our prefrontal cortex. This wasn\u2019t much of an issue when I worked with Trump because he was riding high. Now, like a drowning man, all that matters to him is survival, no matter how much collateral damage his behaviors cause.\n\nThe only wall Trump has built is around himself, to keep his own insecurity and vulnerability at bay. Ironically, his defense consistently produces precisely what it\u2019s meant to protect against. That is just what happened when the Wall Street Journal broke the story of his attempt to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden. In an impulsive attempt to defend himself, Trump released the transcript of their conversation, which substantiated the very point he was seeking to undercut and led to the current impeachment inquiry in Congress.\n\nThe same thing happened when Trump suddenly decided to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria. After even his most loyal Republican supporters condemned the action, he reacted with anger, singling out Sen. Lindsey Graham, one of his most vociferous defenders. Once it became clear that the withdrawal was a terrible mistake, Trump reacted by writing a crude, bullying letter to Turkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, threatening to destroy Turkey\u2019s economy.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s behavior is an extreme version of what we observe every day in our work at the Energy Project. Facing threats to their businesses and uncertainty about the future, leaders instinctively double down on what\u2019s worked best for them in the past. The problem is that any strength overused eventually becomes a liability: Confidence turns into arrogance. Courage becomes recklessness. Certainty congeals into rigidity. Authority moves toward authoritarianism. Feeling attacked and aggrieved, Trump becomes more Trumpian.\n\nThe prerequisite to growth is the capacity to self-regulate, which frays under stress. As an antidote, we encourage our clients to practice something we call the \u201cGolden Rule of Triggers\u201d: Whatever you\u2019re compelled to do, don\u2019t. Compulsion means we\u2019re no longer in control of how we respond, which is so often the case for Trump. But it is possible to better manage our triggers. Even a brief period of deep breathing, for example, can clear the bloodstream of the stress hormone cortisol and return control to the prefrontal cortex.\n\nTo grow, we need an inner observer \u2014 the ability to stand back from our emotions rather than simply acting them out. Trump is a prisoner of his poor self-control, his inability to observe himself and his limited perspective. Refusing to accept blame or admit uncertainty is a habit he developed early in life to protect himself from a brutal father, whose withering criticism he had watched drive his older brother, Fred Jr., to alcoholism and an early death. In Trump\u2019s mind, if he is not seen as all good, then he is all bad. If he\u2019s not viewed as 100 percent right, then he is 100 percent wrong.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGrowth is possible only when we can see ourselves not as right or wrong, good or bad, strong or weak, but as all of who we are. We won\u2019t change Trump, and he won\u2019t change himself, but we can grow ourselves. The more we see and acknowledge \u2014 our best, our worst and all the shades in between \u2014 the less we feel compelled to defend our own value, and the more value we can add in the world.\n\nTwitter: @tonyschwartz\n\nAD", "description": "Personal growth is about seeing more.
