He managed to raise R4 000 and paid Moyeni with a promise to pay the balance in installments.\"\n\nThe man, however, was \"taken aback\" when the investigating officer in the case phoned him to inform him of his next court appearance a month later.\n\n\"He confronted Moyeni who informed him that any query should be directed to his office. The matter was reported to the Hawks and it was confirmed that the case was indeed allocated to Moyeni and it was disposed of as withdrawn due to different seal numbers on the blood results.\"\n\nThe prosecutor was arrested on Tuesday and made a brief appearance in the local regional court.\n\nHe was granted R1 000 bail.\n\nThe case was postponed to November 29.", "description": "A prosecutor who allegedly took a bribe and tampered with the blood evidence of a drunk driver, has found himself in the dock on charges of corruption and extortion.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8469/f8961544acc540e480a05d6b1f43810f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
