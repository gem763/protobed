She ran herself over, with her OWN car, after she forgot to apply handbrakes before exiting the vehicle. Before you think it\u2019s sad, let me tell you she\u2019s okay.\n\nNow, for the funny part.\n\nThe woman stopped her car outside her house in Kentish town, because she wanted to check out some eggs that had been left on a stand outside the home. As the woman went to look at them closely, the car started moving towards her slowly and eventually hit her and the table of eggs.\n\nCaters\n\nObviously, the woman was left with eggs all over her face. The car then stopped and moved backwards slightly and thankfully the woman didn\u2019t sustain any major injuries. She immediately stood up, hoping that nobody saw the incident, but unfortunately, the whole thing was captured on CCTV camera.\n\nYou might want to remember to apply handbrakes, especially when you are standing in front of your car *LOL*.\n\nCaters\n\nDon't Miss 412 SHARES 150 SHARES 4.5 K SHARES\n\nIn another incident, Prashant Kasana, a resident of Chitehra village in Greater Noida, was not so lucky. He was returning from Jewar in a Jaguar, and his car was being driven at a very high speed as it approached the zero point on the expressway. The person driving it, according to Mahaveer, rolled down the window near the turn and tried to spit something he was chewing and lost the control of his car.\n\nThe car crashed into the grille on the side of the road near zero point, at the point where a vehicle has to follow a loop to switch to the Noida Expressway. He sustained serious injuries on his head.", "description": "It is not everyday you see someone harming themselves!
