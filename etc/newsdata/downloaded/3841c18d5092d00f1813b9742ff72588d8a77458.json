Brexiteers have long argued that Europe\u2019s biggest economy, Germany, which exports hundreds of thousands of cars to Britain each year, would protect that trade.\n\nNissan said it was examining a host of scenarios and wants the tariffs not to be applied if Britain leaves the bloc without an agreement.\n\n\"We are asking not to have tariffs being applied in a no-deal scenario because otherwise the tariffs won't be sustainable for us,\" De Ficchy said.\n\nIn 2016, Nissan said it would build its next-generation Qashqai vehicle at the factory, key to maintaining staff levels of around 6,000 people at the site and an example of how far in advance major decisions are taken.\n\nThe assumption is that investment will go ahead, De Ficchy said on Thursday, but warned that Nissan would need to react if there were a no-deal outcome, although decisions involving plants might take time.\n\n\"We are conscious about the need to react quickly,\" he said. \"But at the same time no quick decision may be taken because the complexity around that scenario is really big.\" (Editing by Paul Sandle)", "description": "No-deal Brexit tariffs of 10% on vehicles would be unsustainable for Nissan in Europe, where it runs Britain's biggest car factory, the Japanese company warned on Thursday.
