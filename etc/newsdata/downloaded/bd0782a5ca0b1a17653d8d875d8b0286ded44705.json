He thrives in his house league team, yet this year he wanted to try out for competitive hockey. Though I wasn\u2019t keen on the idea of adding more hockey to our schedule, I figured there was no harm in letting him take a shot.\n\nAfter the try-outs, he waited anxiously for the results while we continually refreshed the page until it was finally time for him to go to bed. He\u2019d been asleep for awhile when we saw that he had been cut from the team. My heart sunk; his dad wondered out loud how he was going to tell him.\n\nI imagined finding that coach and kicking him right in the shin. Instead, I went to sleep with a heavy heart knowing that in the morning my husband would deliver the bad news.\n\nYou May Also Like: Are You A Free-Range Or Helicopter Parent? My Advice Is To Get Over It\n\nNothing makes me happier than seeing my kids smile. When they are happy, I\u2019m happy. Their sadness can cause an ache so deep in my heart. Our job as parents is to protect our kids \u2014 it\u2019s one of the first promises we make our babies.\n\nThe funny thing about life is that sometimes it can gut punch us so hard that we can barely breathe.\n\nOur job as parents is not to give our kids the easiest, most obstacle-free life possible.\n\nAs humans, we know this. By the time we\u2019ve reached adulthood, we\u2019ve experienced a gut punch or two. Yet as parents, we are terrified of allowing our kids to experience any sort of pain regardless of how little, or how big. In reality, it\u2019s about us more than it is about them. We don\u2019t want to see our kids hurt. We don\u2019t want to witness their tears. So, we do what we think we are supposed to do: we protect them.\n\nThe truth is, that\u2019s not really our job.\n\nOur job as parents is not to give our kids the easiest, most obstacle-free life possible. Our job is to do our best to raise good humans. As much as we want to shelter our kids from the darkness that can be found in the world, at some point in time they will happen upon adversity. And how will they navigate those hardships if we\u2019ve never allowed them to develop the skills?\n\nWhen did parents become so afraid of letting their kids feel uncomfortable?\n\nHere's Advice From The Psychology Foundation Of Canada: \u2018Good Enough\u2019 Parenting And How It Will Help Build Resiliency In Kids\n\nIf our kids are hungry, we produce an array of snacks from the lunch bags that we\u2019ve packed. If they have to go to the washroom, we stop everything to find a bathroom right away. If they\u2019re cold, we give them our sweaters even when we\u2019ve warned them to pack their own.\n\nWe don\u2019t learn what we are capable of from always having things go our way.\n\nParents will go out of our way to ensure that their kids don\u2019t fail. We bring forgotten lunch bags to school, we help finish school projects in the final hours and we race around searching for lost library books.\n\nNone of this is helping them. In fact, it\u2019s hurting them.\n\nConstantly saving the day may make our lives easier, and help us feel like better parents, but it\u2019s not teaching our kids to be accountable for themselves.\n\nWe don\u2019t learn what we are capable of from always having things go our way. We build perseverance by failing, by falling down, by feeling defeat and by doing things we didn\u2019t think we could do.\n\nWhen my daughter wanted to audition for our city\u2019s performance of The Nutcracker, I almost discouraged her from trying. I didn\u2019t think she was going to get a part. But I told myself this would be a great life lesson for her \u2014 you don\u2019t always win, even when you work really hard and give it your all. She showed me by getting a part in the performance. How wrong would I have been to allow my own fears to discourage her from trying?\n\nIf You Like Natalie's POV, You've Got To Read Susan's Piece: I\u2019m Not Here To Make Life Magical For My Children\n\nWhat message do we send our kids when we shelter them from hardships? Do they feel loved and cared for? Or do they think we aren\u2019t confident in their abilities?\n\nI wonder if our kids feel as though we have no faith in them?\n\nI can\u2019t make these struggles disappear, but I can help my kids recognize that they have the ability to overcome hard things.\n\nThe morning after learning my son was cut from the hockey team, I walked into our room where his dad was giving him the bad news. His head hung low, I wrapped my arms around him and whispered, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d I didn\u2019t use my words to try to take the pain away. I didn\u2019t try to justify the coach\u2019s decision \u2014 I didn\u2019t even tell him that he could try again next year. I simply stood beside him and let him know I was there, and allowed him to feel sad.\n\nWe have to allow our kids to feel sad.\n\nI can\u2019t protect my kids from every bad feeling that may come their way. I don\u2019t want to. They are going to fail. They are going to have their hearts broken. They are going to be passed over for the promotion they worked so hard for, or not get the job after thinking they nailed the interview. Life is filled with hard things: divorces, illnesses, death. Being cut from a hockey team is small potatoes when it comes to life\u2019s disappointments.\n\nI can\u2019t make these struggles disappear, but I can help my kids recognize that they have the ability to overcome hard things.\n\nBy dinner time, my son was at peace with not having made the higher level team. He had brushed it off. He spoke eagerly of playing for his house league team. I took comfort in knowing that he had picked himself up.\n\nOur kids are capable of so much if we just give them a shot to prove it to us. They are tougher than we like to think. In reality, it\u2019s actually us who need to toughen up.", "description": "I can\u2019t protect my kids from every bad feeling that may come their way. I don\u2019t want to. They are going to fail.
