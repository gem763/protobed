He is entitled to tweet anything he wants.\"\n\nThe American president has taken to Twitter scores of times to express his disdain for the 14-member organization's output cutting plans that have aimed to boost prices amid a high supply and low demand environment. In mid-June, after OPEC and its non-OPEC allies agreed to extend their output cuts into 2020, Trump tweeted: \"Oil prices are too high, OPEC is at it again. Not good!\"\n\nLower oil prices translate to more affordable gas prices for American consumers, something the president wants to ensure ahead of an election year.\n\nAbdulaziz said Thursday that OPEC and non-OPEC partners would consider deeper production cuts at its next full meeting.\n\nA seasoned veteran of the kingdom's delegation to OPEC with years of experience in the industry, Abdulaziz is the first member of the ruling Al Saud family to hold a position in the massive energy ministry. He told reporters on Monday during the World Energy Congress that there would be no changes to the oil policy of Saudi Arabia, which has taken on the brunt of the OPEC cuts, pumping well below its 10 million barrel per day (bpd) target.\n\nPushing oil prices higher does not seem feasible at this point, even with production cuts, many analysts agree \u2014 the International Energy Agency recently announced its lowest growth forecasts for oil demand in a decade, with demand growth for the first half of 2019 at a paltry 500,000 bpd. Most see Brent crude hovering in the $50 to $60 per barrel range.\n\nThe full OPEC+ coalition will next meet in Vienna, Austria in early December to decide whether any further action to stabilize oil markets is required for 2020.", "description": "Abdulaziz said Thursday that OPEC and non-OPEC partners would consider deeper production cuts at its next full meeting.", "authors": ["Natasha Turak"], "top_image": "https://sc.cnbcfm.com/applications/cnbc.com/staticcontent/img/cnbc_logo.gif?v=1524171804", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
