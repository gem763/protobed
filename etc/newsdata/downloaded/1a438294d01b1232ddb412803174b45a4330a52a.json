'Had one been needed, there was a backup cart on the other sideline which was immediately available. He received appropriate medical care per gameday protocols.'\n\nChris Mack, co-host of Pittsburgh's The Fan sports radio show, suggested Rudolph's treatment says a lot about how the NFL manages head trauma, even after years of work to improve its image on that front.\n\nFrom the NFL, on the #Steelers cart issue that left QB Mason Rudolph being helped off the field rather than leaving in a cart: pic.twitter.com/1HVGeApoJD \u2014 Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) October 7, 2019\n\n'If \"appropriate medical care\" for someone in the condition Mason Rudolph was in is to walk them halfway around the damn stadium to get them to an ambulance, then we can no longer question the league's concern about head injuries: It really doesn't exist,' he tweeted.\n\nSteelers head coach Mike Tomlin suggested the medical cart issue with Rudolph was out of his purview.\n\n'Ask somebody that's in charge of that. I don't drive carts and things of that nature,' Tomlin told reporters when asked about the issue during the post-game press conference.\n\nRudolph must still participate in the league's concussion protocol procedures before he's allowed to practice fully again or play in his team's next scheduled matchup.\n\nNFL rules require players who have suffered concussions to complete a series of medical tests before they're allowed to return to practice or play in their team's next matchup.\n\nSteelers starting QB Ben Roethlisberger was placed on the team's injury reserve list in September after severely injured his right elbow in the team's second game against the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nRudolph's injury leaves only one quarterback - undrafted free agent Devlin Hodges - on the Steelers' roster.", "description": "The Pittsburgh Steelers are receiving criticism for the way medical officials handled an injury to quarterback Mason Rudolph during the team's overtime loss to the Ravens Sunday afternoon.", "authors": ["Chauncey Alcorn For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/06/19379322-0-image-a-61_1570424808637.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
