If negotiations continue to progress, Rowett could watch his first game on Tuesday night against Cardiff from the stand at The Den.\n\nSacked by Stoke in January, despite just three defeats in his last 17 Championship games, Rowett is expected to name Callum Davidson, the former Leicester defender, as his assistant.", "description": "Millwall are in advanced talks with Gary Rowett over becoming the Championship club's new manager.", "authors": ["John Percy", "Keith Hackett", "Sam Wallace"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/20/TELEMMGLPICT000161422758-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6L3Bx11x18zbsv4k04trOP3QFo7fDZgyggOOCRYToPs.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
