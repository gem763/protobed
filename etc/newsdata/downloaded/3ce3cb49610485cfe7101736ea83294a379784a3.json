(Edward Wood/Flickr)\n\nIt was on the warm side of normal today, but humidity on the lower side kept it bearable. As has been the story this warm season, the pleasant times don\u2019t last long. Higher heat and humidity are on the way Monday. The good news is that this should be a quick shot of heat.\n\nListen to our daily D.C. forecasts: Apple Podcasts | Amazon Echo | More options\n\nThrough tonight: Skies remain clear this evening, with temperatures falling toward the 70s around sunset. It\u2019s a star-filled overnight as lows are in the 60s in most spots, which might be 70 downtown. Winds from the south are light.\n\nView the current weather at The Washington Post.\n\nTomorrow (Monday): Another day with abundant sunshine. A few clouds may bubble up in the heat of the day. It\u2019s hot for September, with highs in the mid-80s to around 90. There could be a few late-day showers or storms as a cold front approaches. For now, it doesn\u2019t look like much. Winds are from the south, about 10 mph.\n\nSee Brian Jackson\u2019s forecast through the week. And if you haven\u2019t already, join us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter and Instagram.

I wish we could say the heat is finished, which historically has been the case, but there are hints that more is to come later next week. Running out of time, at least.\n\n\n\nThe forecast for the next two weeks from the European model. (Weatherbell)\n\nWant our 5 a.m. forecast delivered to your email inbox?
