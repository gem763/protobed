Photo by Tom Tingle/The Republic (Photo: Tom Tingle, Tom Tingle/The Republic)\n\nToday, the National Press Foundation has announced Nicole Carroll, Vice President/News and Editor of The Arizona Republic and azcentral.com, has won the prestigious Benjamin C. Bradlee Editor of the Year Award.\n\n\n\nCarroll, who has been with the Republic since 1999, most recently led the NETWORK\u2019s groundbreaking project, \u2018The Wall,\u2019 which combined exceptional news reporting and emerging technologies to document the impact of the proposed border wall between the United States and Mexico. In her current role, Carroll oversees Arizona\u2019s largest news team. In the past five years, the Republic/azcentral.com has twice been named a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in Breaking News (2012, 2014). Carroll also is the Southwest Regional Editor for the USA TODAY Network, overseeing newsrooms in New Mexico and Utah.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are so delighted and so proud for this recognition of Nicole\u2019s great work and impact as a journalist and newsroom leader,\u201d said Maribel Perez Wadsworth, SVP and Chief Transformation Officer, Gannett. \u201cNicole is a passionate advocate for her community and as such is driven to push the boundaries of storytelling, leveraging new tools and platforms to ensure the important work we do connects and resonates with the audiences we serve, while delivering on the highest standards of our craft.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe National Press Foundation established the Editor of the Year Award in 1984 to \u201crecognize significant achievements that enhance the quality of journalism in the United States. It recognizes imagination, professional skill, ethics and an ability to motivate staff \u2014 qualities that produce excellence in media and represent the highest standards of journalism.\"\n\n\n\nThe National Press Foundation judges described Carroll as embodying \u201cthe spirit and courage that defined the legendary Benjamin C. Bradlee\u2026Carroll knows her community intimately. When death threats arose after the Republic\u2019s editorial board endorsed a Democrat for president, Carroll herself went to a Trump rally to brave the harassment hurled at her staff. She channeled the \u201cBuild the wall\u201d chants into exemplary multi-platform journalism \u2013 \u201cThe Wall: Unknown Stories, Unintended Consequences\u201d-- which mapped every mile of the U.S.-Mexico border and educated readers about the issues and challenges of a wall.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe NETWORK was uniquely qualified to tackle such a substantial and critical project like this because of its local footprint, with boots on the ground all along the border and access to the voices and stories that need to be heard. The reporters didn\u2019t just drop in on the story from the outside, they have covered this story, these issues and the people for decades. More than 30 reporters, editors, and photographers based in properties along the border came together under Carroll\u2019s direction to provide this groundbreaking snapshot of life on the wall.\n\n\n\nCarroll will receive her award at the annual NPF awards dinner on February 15, 2018 in Washington, D.C.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2iBTkuY", "description": "Today, the National Press Foundation has announced Nicole Carroll, Vice President/News and Editor of The Arizona Republic and azcentral.com, has won the prestigious\u00a0Benjamin C.
