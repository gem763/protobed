The North has also said rounds of U.S.-led sanctions imposed over its nuclear and missile programs are stifling its economy.\n\nEarly last year, North Korea entered talks with the U.S. over the fate of its advancing nuclear arsenal in return for political and economic benefits from the U.S.\n\nSaturday\u2019s talks were the first between the sides since the February breakdown of the second summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Vietnam. The two leaders held a brief, impromptu meeting at the Korean border in late June and agreed to restart diplomacy.\n\nState Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said the chief North Korean negotiator\u2019s comments about Saturday\u2019s talks did \u201cnot reflect the content or the spirit\u201d of the \u201cgood discussions\u201d that took place over 8 \u00bd hours. She also said the U.S. accepted an invitation from Sweden to return to Stockholm in two weeks to continue talks.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "North Korea said Sunday that it won't meet again with the United States unless it abandons its 'hostile policy' against the North.", "authors": ["Hyung-Jin Kim"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/north-korea-foreign-ministry-united-states-talks.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
