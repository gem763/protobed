I thought this was nirvana,\" Geltner told Out in the Open host Piya Chattopadhyay.\n\nThe journalist from Gainesville, Fla., signed onto a job that consisted of producing in-house, monthly magazines for various associations. Editors were hired, and had to be prepared to work prior to these associations signing on, so Geltner started off without any accounts.\n\nOther editors had multiple accounts, but wouldn't pass off their work because the more magazines they published, the more they could cash in on bonuses. So he had no choice but to wait.\n\n\u2022 CBC NEWS: Most Canadian employees are ready to quit their jobs, survey finds\n\nAs a former newspaper editor who was constantly overworked and bombarded with never-ending deadlines, Geltner relished the opportunity.\n\n\"This is what I want. I just want to sit somewhere, earn my money, then I go home and relax,\" Geltner had thought.\n\n'It just eats away at you'\n\nTed Geltner currently teaches journalism at Georgia's Valdosta State University. (Submitted by Ted Geltner)\n\nAt first, things were great. He spent time surfing the internet, taking walks, or grabbing a coffee and sitting at the picnic tables to read the paper. The only stipulation was that he had to arrive to work on time, and stay the full eight hours.\n\nBut it wasn't long before Geltner became extremely bored. He didn't know what to do with himself.\n\n\"When you get to that point, and there's absolutely nothing to do, it just eats away at you. The time won't pass, and the days seem to be endless,\" said Geltner.\n\n\u2022 CBC NEWS: With 4 generations in the workplace, employers expected to juggle vastly different expectations\n\nEventually, he was assigned accounts, and the work came. But at that point, he realized that the actual work was nearly as boring as having no work.\n\nSo Geltner quit, and said goodbye to what he initially thought was his dream job.\n\n\"I learned that it's not what it's cracked up to be, it's really a mental torture that no one should be forced to endure,\" Geltner reflected.\n\nWhy not allow people to decide for themselves what they have to contribute to the world? It would make them a lot happier than people sitting around, filling out meaningless forms all day. - David Graeber\n\n'Bullshit jobs'\n\nDavid Graeber, an American anthropologist and author of Bullshit Jobs: A Theory, argues that there are many middle managers working in office jobs that simply shouldn't exist.\n\n\"I defined 'bullshit jobs' as any job so completely pointless that even the person doing it secretly believes that, were that job to disappear, it would make no difference,\" Graeber told Out in the Open.\n\nAccording to him, some of those jobs can range from people in telemarketing, advertising, public relations, finance, and even people who produce \"in-house magazines no one would ever look at.\"\n\nWork as a form of suffering\n\nAfter Geltner quit his job, he landed a spot teaching journalism at Valdosta State University, where he's able to find balance in his schedule. He's also realized that fulfillment can be found in different ways.\n\n\"People should find other modes of satisfaction that don't have to do with clocking in and clocking out,\" said Geltner.\n\nOUT IN THE OPEN: A basic income let her stop doing work she had to do, and focus on work she loved\n\nGraeber believes that work has become a form of suffering that helps justify consumer pleasures. He wonders what universal basic income would do for society.\n\n\"Why not allow people to decide for themselves what they have to contribute to the world? It would make them a lot happier than people sitting around, filling out meaningless forms all day,\" suggests Graeber.\n\nThis story appears in the Out in the Open episode, \"Inside Job\".", "description": "Ted Geltner thought he hit jackpot when he landed a stress-free job as a magazine editor.", "authors": ["Out In The Open"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5038270.1551446240!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/ted-geltner.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-01"}
