A record crowd is expected at Marvel Stadium. The hype train has been steaming down the tracks at full speed for months.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nBut it isn\u2019t long before Whittaker adds a qualifier.\n\n\u201cI say it\u2019s my biggest fight to date because it\u2019s my next one,\u201d Whittaker said. \u201cThe upcoming fight is always my biggest. That\u2019s how I always take it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s Whittaker\u2019s way of saying he\u2019s always ready and isn\u2019t focused on a million other things, like some have accused Adesanya of doing. Adesanya is doing something right, and is 17-0 overall in MMA and 6-0 in his 20-month stint in the UFC.\n\nHe\u2019s fought four times since Whittaker last stepped into the cage and feels it\u2019s an advantage.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had six fights in 18 months in the UFC and I finally got a break before this camp,\u201d Adesanya said. \u201cRobert has only fought once in the last two years. Activity is a powerful thing, especially when you\u2019re under those lights, under that pressure. He\u2019s human. I know he\u2019s human. He\u2019s going to feel it. He doesn\u2019t want to let people down.\n\n\u201cMe, I\u2019ve made peace with the outcome. I\u2019m going to have fun. And when I\u2019m having fun, I\u2019m the best in the world.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nNot surprisingly, Whittaker sees it differently. He had to pull out of a title fight with Kelvin Gastelum at UFC 234 in February because he got ill after the weigh-in and nearly died, and as Adesanya said, because of various maladies, has only fought once in 818 days.\n\nWhittaker, though, believes there\u2019s a hidden benefit.\n\n\u201cThe thing I think people don\u2019t realize, or not thinking about, is that yeah, being out, I haven\u2019t fought, but my brain didn\u2019t go through all that trauma,\u201d he said. \u201cMentally, I have had such a big layoff since my last fight. Obviously, I didn\u2019t want this, but it is what it is. But I have to look at the silver lining and the positives that come along with it, and one of those is that I have been able to rest: mentally rest, physically rest and my brain hasn\u2019t taken any significant trauma for a long time. Health is everything in life, and it is in fighting, too. I\u2019m going to be sharp and ready because my body is rested and relaxed and ready for this.\u201d\n\n(L-R) Robert Whittaker and Israel Adesanya fight for the undisputed UFC middleweight title on Saturday at UFC 243 in Melbourne, Australia. (Getty Images)\n\nMany of the physical advantages rest with Adesanya. He\u2019s 6-foot-4 with an 80-inch reach and extremely long legs. He has the ability to throw every type of strike and at incredible speed.\n\nWhittaker, though, is the more well-rounded fighter who has repeatedly shown he is comfortable wherever the fight takes him. He\u2019s beaten an elite striker in Uriah Hall, an Olympic wrestler in Romero (twice) and an elite grappler in Jacare Souza.\n\nThere is no area of the game in which he\u2019s weak.\n\nHe\u2019ll need to get past Adesanya\u2019s jab and close the distance and fight at a middle range in which he\u2019ll have a better chance of connecting on his shots.\n\nWhittaker has great timing and set-ups with his takedowns, and his ability to diversify his game will keep Adesanya guessing.\n\nBut he can never relax because of the sheer number of ways that Adesanya can strike, and the accuracy with which he connects.\n\nBettors have played Adesanya at the MGM Grand sportsbook, and he\u2019s become a slight favorite. He\u2019s now at minus-130, while Whittaker is even money.\n\nMy pick is Whittaker because of his experience against elite opposition and the diversity of his game. I suspect he\u2019ll fight with a chip on his shoulder, as well, because so many are chronicling Adesanya\u2019s meteoric rise to prominence that Whittaker may feel he\u2019s being overlooked.\n\nBoth men will have their moments, but look for Whittaker to win Round 5 and pull out a victory in a memorable bout.\n\nMore UFC 243 coverage from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Adesanya has the physical advantages, but Whittaker is a more well-rounded fighter.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/OPUjE1dbyqRI8YLGD2pm9Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/q4sNb.9uQpP3.CMOOl9VbQ--~B/aD0yNDMyO3c9MzY0ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/0e783120-e679-11e9-9f7b-732b60807956", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
