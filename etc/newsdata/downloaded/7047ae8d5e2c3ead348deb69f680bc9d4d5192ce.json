Many of the buildings in this area were built in the 1950s where it was common to simply park your car on the street, and now there is a shortage of them,\u201d said Adrien Epstein, luxury property consultant at Dogon Group.\n\n\n\nSituated on the roof of San Michele apartment building in Victoria Road, the open-air parking bay offers a splendid oceanic view, private security, and access via the building to one of Cape Town\u2019s most popular beaches, Clifton 1st .\n\n\n\nA guaranteed parking like this is extremely sought-after during Cape Town\u2019s peak-season in summer when thousands flock to the beach. Clifton\u2019s famous beaches are only accessible via long winding staircases. Street parking is limited.\n\nThe property created a bit of a stir on social media:\n\nBut it's not even a record. In 2017, another parking bay in Clifton sold for R1.65 million.\n\nOther bays were sold for R1 million, and R1.1 million respectively in Clifton and Bakoven.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen garages for more. But I think [the bay] is correctly priced for what you are getting. You must compare that some of the houses (in the neighbourhood that) sell upwards of R30 million. So for R1.2 million it comes in at a bargain,\u201d said Epstein.\n\nHowever, even houses on the Atlantic Seaboard have not been immune to the general property price slump that have hit home-owners in SA.\n\nThe latest FNB House Price Index shows that prices in the area were almost 4% lower in the second quarter of this year compared to the same period last year.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "But it's not even a record.
