It does not reflect our operational policies and has since been removed. \u2014 ArcLight Cinemas (@ArcLightCinemas) October 5, 2019\n\nJust to make things clear, the sign was soon taken down and replaced with a message that expanded upon ArcLight\u2019s original Tweet.\n\nOkay I guess that sign wasn\u2019t real, I went back and they have this one up now pic.twitter.com/kdCzVMfkuF \u2014 Nick Ciarelli (@nickciarelli) October 5, 2019\n\nThe original sign appears to have been made by comedian Brad Evans, who later revealed that he and his conspirator Nick Ciarelli actually left the sign up on the front window of the huge multiplex.\n\nFor everyone asking, yes, we did leave the sign up on the front window. pic.twitter.com/M6xhAu8HlP \u2014 Brad Evans (@bradfordevans) October 5, 2019\n\nIn regards to the discourse surrounding the film, director Todd Phillips told The Wrap, \"I think it's because outrage is a commodity, I think it's something that has been a commodity for a while [...] What's outstanding to me in this discourse in this movie is how easily the far left can sound like the far right when it suits their agenda. It's really been eye-opening for me.\u201d\n\nRead more: Warner Bros responds to Joker violence controversy\n\nJoker is currently doing exceptionally well in cinemas.
