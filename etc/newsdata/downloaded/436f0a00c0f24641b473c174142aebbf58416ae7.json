In some places, a month's worth of rain unleashed by a low pressure system fell in half a day.\n\nEvacuation orders and advisories were issued along much of the northern corridor already hit by two typhoons since last month. The city of Ushiku in Chiba received 283.5 mm (11 inches) of rain over 12 hours.\n\nAuthorities warned of the chance of further landslides and floods, especially in areas hit by levee breaks that have yet to be repaired after Typhoon Hagibis lashed central and eastern Japan with heavy rains and high winds.\n\nThat typhoon killed at least 88 people, with seven others still missing and more than 300 injured, said NHK.
