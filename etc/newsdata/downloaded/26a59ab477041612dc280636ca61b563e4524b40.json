However, with a few honourable exceptions \u2013 the Go-Betweens, Sleater-Kinney , more recently the Futureheads \u2013 trying to recreate past glories in the recording studio is generally at best anticlimactic for all concerned. The road to hell is indeed paved with discarded copies of the Verve\u2019s 2008 album, Forth.\n\nGiven how brightly they burned in the late 1980s, Pixies were always likely to struggle to live up to expectations when they decided to write new material, but Indie Cindy (2014) and Head Carrier (2016) were woeful by anybody\u2019s standards.\n\nBeneath the Eyrie is no better: once again, the songs are largely pedestrian, the lyrics too often ploddingly workaday (\u201cI don\u2019t mind the rain/ But I\u2019m ready for love\u201d), the erstwhile Black Francis no longer screaming and yelping like a man possessed. On Graveyard Hill at least opens with a bassline that\u2019s a distant echo of Debaser\u2019s but the song proves to be more \u201cslicing up a nice loaf of bread\u201d than \u201cslicing up eyeballs\u201d;the awkward bar-room lurch of This Is My Fate sounds oddly like Tom Waits, while the Nick Cave-like Bird of Prey starts off with a rare arresting lyric (\u201cI\u2019ll set my broken bones with a twist and a crack\u201d) but goes downhill from there. It\u2019s not a terrible album \u2013 it\u2019s better than many bands that Pixies inspired \u2013 but it isn\u2019t terribly good either.", "description": "(BMG)", "authors": ["Phil Mongredien"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b819ca05b59cdbe5ee59684740d1d9fe181b5a22/0_69_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTIucG5n&enable=upscale&s=8c9abff7718e7f15484cb224276b278f", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
