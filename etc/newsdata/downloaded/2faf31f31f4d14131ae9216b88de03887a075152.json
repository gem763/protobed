Together, they are part of the cannabinoid group of compounds found in hashish, hash oil, and most strains of marijuana. THC is the psychoactive compound responsible for the euphoric, 'high' feeling often associated with marijuana. THC interacts with CB1 receptors in the central nervous system and brain and creates the sensations of euphoria and anxiety. CBD does not fit these receptors well, and actually decreases the effects of THC, and is not psychoactive. CBD is thought to help reduce anxiety and inflammation.\n\n'CBD is this generation's snake oil, where millions are engaging with the product without evidence of any benefit.'\n\nScientists' skepticism has done little to stop Americans from flocking to the trendy product, which has quickly become the hottest topic in health and wellness, according to the new study.\n\n'When talking to colleagues about our study we often play a game we call \"CBD or\" and almost every time experts are shocked to learn that CBD is more popular or nearly as popular,' said Dr Alicia Nobles a research fellow at UC San Diego.\n\n'Consider this one example. For every two internet searches for dieting in the United States we found there is one for CBD!'\n\nThe study, published in JAMA Network Open,' also found that there are now nearly seven-and-a-half-times as many unique online searchers for CBD as for acupuncture, five-times more than for apple cider vinegar and over three-times as many as for meditation.\n\nCBD searches surpassed vaccination searchers by 63 percent, exercise by nearly 60 percent, veganism by 12 percent, and even its own parent plant, marijuana, by 13 percent.\n\nThe rise of CBD searchers has been steep, and the researchers predict it will only continue.\n\nSearches for the compound increased by 125 percent over the course of 2017 and another 160 percent during 2018.\n\nNow, researchers project another 180 percent increase by the end of this year.\n\nAnd the growth of interest in CBD has persisted across all regions of the country.\n\nThough its broadly viewed as harmless, some patients have sought out CBD as not just a complement to but substitute for proven treatments of life-threatening diseases, including cancer, a pattern that has experts deeply concerned.\n\n'Some consumers might forgo seeing a physician or taking medications with known, tested and approved therapeutic benefits in favor of CBD and thereby become sicker or succumb to their illness,' said Dr Smith.\n\n'Now is the time to act,' added Ayers.\n\n'Government regulators must step up to the plate give CBD products the same level of scrutiny as other proven medications.\n\n'Moreover, anyone considering taking CBD should know there are no proven over-the-counter health benefits.'", "description": "Some 6.4 million Google searches for CBD are made a month, UC San Diego research reveals.
