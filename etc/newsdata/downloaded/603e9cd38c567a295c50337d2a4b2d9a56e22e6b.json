Two alleged gang leaders, Aljermiah \u201cNuke\u201d Mack, 33, and Anthony \u201cHarv\u201d Ellison, 31, are on trial.\n\nTekashi says he had a symbiotic relationship with the Nine Trey Bloods\u2014which meant regularly giving Ellison and other members wads of cash\u2014but didn\u2019t realize how much influence he had in the gang until his social media beefs became Nine Trey brawls.\n\nAs an example, he testified that after months of \u201congoing disputes\u201d and \u201ca lot of jealousy\u201d with rival rapper Trippie Redd, he ordered his manager to get \u201csomething done.\u201d A plan was quickly orchestrated to attack Redd at the Gansevoort hotel in Manhattan while he was in town shooting a music video.\n\nTekashi said that while he waited in a car around the corner, four gang members stormed Trippie\u2019s hotel room\u2014fleeing after Ellison punched Trippie in the mouth without warning. The attack, Tekashi said, earned Ellison the rapper\u2019s trust\u2014and access to his bank account.\n\n\u201cAfter the incident with Trippie Redd, [Ellison] and I got super close,\u201d Tekashi said. \u201cI used him as an enforcer, for protection. He became apart of my entourage.\u201d\n\nThe relationship fizzled after \u201cabout four months,\u201d when Ellison started to exhibit \u201caggressive behavior,\u201d Tekashi said. And Ellison was not even invited when Tekashi went to the \"World Star\" SXSW showcase in Austin, Texas, in 2018.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t invite [Ellison] to Austin,\u201d he said. \u201cI just went to perform and didn\u2019t want trouble. But Isaw him at the front of the show. But I didn\u2019t even get to play.\u201d\n\nTekashi was denied entrance to his own show by Rap-A-Lot Records, a move he claims was the result of not \u201cchecking in\u201d with an affiliated Bloods gang in Texas. The next day, the rapper said, he was publicly denied entry into the label CEO's birthday.\n\n\u201cWe had to get them back\u2014it was embarrassing,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey tried to embarrass us, so we were going to rob them.\u201d\n\nA month later, the opportunity for revenge presented itself when several Rap-A-Lot musicians flew into New York for a meeting at the label\u2019s Times Square offices. Tekashi said he and a half-dozen Nine Treys for wind of the meeting and went to Manhattan to defend his honor.\n\nAs soon as they pulled up, Tekashi\u2019s former manager put several bullets into his gun. Tekashi said his own role was videographer\u2014from a nearby car.\n\n\u201cI started recording when we pulled up, and put my phone out the back of the window to make sure to tape the whole thing,\u201d he recalled excitedly, his Dutch braid pigtails bouncing as he spoke.\n\nIn the video played in court Wednesday, several men can be seen through a rain-stained car window walking into an enclosed breezeway of the New York high-rise. Tekashi, then is seen opening the door to get a better view while a fight ensues about 5 feet away. In another surveillance video played to jurors, at least three men involved in the scuffle are armed.\n\nTekashi said his gang escaped with \u201ca book bag...a passport, and fake jewelry,\u201d but their car stopped about 20 feet from the incident at a red light. Right behind them, he said, squad cars were moving in. Amid the chaos, one gang member \u201cthrew the gun\u201d on Tekashi\u2019s lap and told him to get out of the car, he said.\n\n\u201cBro, I\u2019m fucking famous at this point, I can\u2019t leave this car in Times Square with a gun,\u201d Tekashi said in court to laughter.\n\nHe said got out of the car, hiding the gun inside his hoodie, before walking into the Times Square subway station to take the train home with another Nine Trey.\n\nThe rapper testified that after the robbery, the Nine Treys were consumed by infighting, and by July 2018, the gang split into supporters and enemies of Tekashi.\n\n\u201cWe were all part of the same gang, but we were all attacking each other at the same time,\u201d he said.\n\nThe bad blood overflowed the night before the singer\u2019s single \u201cFEFE\u201d was set to drop, Tekashi told jurors. He went to a strip club, then headed home to finish working on the video for the future hit. He realized he needed help from a friend and convinced his driver to take him there.\n\nOn the way, Tekashi testified, they were \u201chit from behind by another car.\u201d The driver exited the car to check out the damage and Tekashi looked through the rear-view window to see a man running toward him with a gun in his hand.\n\n\u201cMy heart falls to my ass and I freeze,\u201d he testified, his voice choking up. \u201cThe guy opens the door, gun pointed at me and says \u2018give me everything.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe rapper said he immediately recognized Ellison\u2014who had been cut off for bad-mouthing Tekashi and his former manager\u2014 as one of the two assailants. He said he pleaded with his ex-friend to not shoot, offering him everything he owns.\n\nEllison, sitting at the defense table, wore a bored expression as Tekashi spoke, but then asked one of his attorneys to leave the courtroom with him.\n\nIn a dash-cam video played in court, Tekashi can be heard begging Ellison to spare him and reminding his fellow Nine Trey: \u201cI\u2019ve always done right by you.\u201d\n\nTekashi said he was eventually taken by Ellison and the other assailant to another location and beaten up. Then he was brought to his Brooklyn home, where the duo wanted his all jewelry, including the pony necklace.\n\n\u201cUsually when I take off my jewelry, I put it on the table and my driver wraps it up and puts it in my daughter\u2019s pink backpack,\u201d Tekashi said, adding that the mother of his child gave the kidnappers the gem-filled backpack in exchange for his life.\n\nMinutes later, Tekashi said, he was let go and ran away to a local police precinct.\n\nDuring opening statements on Monday, defense attorneys called the alleged kidnapping \u201ca hoax\u201d staged by Tekashi for publicity for the upcoming single.", "description": "The rapper testified about crimes he committed, and that time he allegedly was a victim.", "authors": ["Pilar Melendez"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2311,w_4110,x_0,y_188/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568834248/GettyImages-1021309454_ybaumo", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
