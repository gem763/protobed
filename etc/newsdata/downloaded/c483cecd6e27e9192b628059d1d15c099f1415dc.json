So rude!\u2019\n\nIt doesn\u2019t bother her all that much (Picture: Dave Benett)\n\nIn other news Rose may be the only person to not do WhatsApp groups\u2026\n\n\u2018It\u2019s been going on for years. It\u2019s probably because I\u2019m not really a phone person or because I have a weird family,\u2019 she continued to Grazia magazine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRose also \u2018doesn\u2019t really care\u2019 about using social media to see what her friends are up to as she\u2019d rather just catch up with them in person.\n\nShe said: \u2018I hardly ever scroll through Instagram.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t really care about other people\u2019s feeds, I care about them in person.\u2019\n\nFair play to her.\n\nThe 46-year-old actress also spoke about often suffering from nightmares but has found crime scene re-enactment programmes help soothe her when she wakes up anxious and can quickly get back to sleep.\n\n\u2018I have nightmares often, like, three times a week. I wake up covered in sweat and it takes a little while to calm down,\u2019 she said.\n\n\u2018Sometimes I put on a show called Forensic Files \u2013 it\u2019s crime scene re-enactments, with a really soft voiceover about death, and for some reason, that calms me right down and I go to sleep.\u2019\n\nWhen she was writing her autobiography, Brave, Rose turned to historical fiction to stop her own work being influenced by what she was reading in her downtime.\n\nShe explained: \u2018I was reading mostly novels because I didn\u2019t want to have interference from other people\u2019s style.\n\n\u2018I read a lot of Charlotte and Emily Bronte. I re-read classics so nothing would affect me, but it\u2019s given me kind of a strange vocabulary that\u2019s a mix between Californian dude-speak and 18th century English literature.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
