The US has taken Saudi Arabia\u2019s side in this regional conflict, in which there is no \u201cgood side\u201d, and in the process only exacerbated the tensions and violence.\n\nIran is a bad actor, and the United States already takes serious steps to curb its support for terrorism, and to defend Israel. But Trump is making the threat worse by ending the Iran nuclear deal and provoking Iran. We now find ourselves in yet another edition of Trump\u2019s deadly reality show: will he or won\u2019t he strike?! Will he or won\u2019t he risk the lives of American soldiers in an unnecessary war?! Or will he try to manufacture another photo-op summit that does nothing but mask the real problems?! Tune into Twitter to find out! Like everything he touches, Trump has turned America\u2019s Iran policy into a farce, while increasing the likelihood of tragedy.\n\nSaudi Arabia, America\u2019s longtime supposed partner, is also a bad actor. For too long America has stomached Saudi Arabia\u2019s support for extremist ideologies, destabilizing policies, and repression at home. But Trump takes it to an extreme by seemingly outsourcing US policy to Riyadh. After the recent attacks, Trump literally said: \u201cWe are waiting to hear from the Kingdom [of Saudi Arabia] as to who they believe was the cause of this attack, and under what terms we would proceed.\u201d\n\nJared Kushner must have done a facepalm \u2013 it\u2019s supposed to be secret when Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, sends his orders over WhatsApp! Trump summed up why he always sides with Riyadh, even after the Saudi leader ordered the murder of the US journalist Jamal Khashoggi: \u201cSaudi Arabia pays cash.\u201d\n\nOne of the most devastating results of US policy has been the humanitarian disaster in Yemen. Because Saudi Arabia entered the war on one side, while Iran supports the other, the United States has blindly followed Saudi Arabia in fueling this conflict that is starving children and killing innocent civilians. The conflict has taken the lives of at least tens of thousands of people, and a United Nations panel recently said that all sides might be committing war crimes.\n\nIsrael \u2013 and Trump\u2019s relationship with Benjamin Netanyahu \u2013 is at the center of this as well. Israel is a close and important ally, but Trump and Netanyahu have personalized, politicized and radicalized the US-Israeli relationship. While Trump attempts to use the relationship as a political wedge by falsely painting his opponents as enemies of Israel, Netanyahu pushes for conflict with Iran and takes steps that make peace with Palestinians all but impossible \u2013 steps that Trump openly supports. The two feed off each other and support one another\u2019s agendas, which are bad for the relationship and bad for the region.\n\nSince the end of the cold war, US policy in the region has been driven by numerous considerations: countering Iran, fighting terrorism, supporting stability, protecting oil markets and defending Israel. While aspects of these policies were faulty long before this administration, today things are very different. Fossil fuels are destroying life in earth. Actions taken in the name of countering Iran often feed instability. Trump has warped our partnership with Israel into blind support for a self-destructive Israeli government.\n\nIn partnering with autocrats to fight terrorism the United States has sacrificed other priorities. The Arab spring, the war in Syria, and myriad other calamities have illustrated how tyranny in the region is undermining \u2013 not supporting \u2013 stability. And now, ties between Saudi officials and businesses and the Trump family raise serious questions about whether Trump\u2019s Middle East policies are being driven in part by efforts to line his own pockets.\n\nWhatever happens in response to this latest flare-up, the answers for the United States are clear: end support for the war in Yemen. Fundamentally change the relationship with Saudi Arabia. Talk to Iran about the entire range of concerns. Bring the sparring sides together to reduce regional tensions. Stop giving Netanyahu a blank check and return support for Israel to the principles of supporting democracy and a two-state solution. And stop supporting autocrats and start supporting the people.\n\nWhile there is growing support to completely change America\u2019s Middle East policy \u2013 evidenced by the bills ending US support for the Yemen war that passed Congress \u2013 US policy remains stuck in a rut: Trump vetoed these congressional attempts to end support for the Yemen war and every time tensions spike, too many voices on both sides of the aisle respond with the kneejerk reaction of considering military action against Iran.\n\nIf America is going to make big changes to shore up the capacity of US leadership to tackle the biggest challenges it faces, one of the first orders of business will be to fix America\u2019s bankrupt Middle East policy. Now would be a good time to start.", "description": "End support for the war in Yemen, change the relationship with Saudi Arabia, and talk to Iran \u2013 the answers for the US are clear", "authors": ["Michael H Fuchs"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14fe765aca1bd887ee767823c59d4ef0c3106a6f/0_0_2968_1781/master/2968.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=76b8afd80cac1871ec7aee134fd060f9", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
