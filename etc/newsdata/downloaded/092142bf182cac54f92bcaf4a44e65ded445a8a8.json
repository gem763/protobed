The fine will be paid to the Treasury.\n\nICO deputy commissioner James Dipple-Johnstone said: \u201cThe ICO\u2019s main concern was that UK citizen data was exposed to a serious risk of harm.\n\n\u201cProtection of personal information and personal privacy is of fundamental importance, not only for the rights of individuals, but also as we now know, for the preservation of a strong democracy.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased to hear that Facebook has taken, and will continue to take, significant steps to comply with the fundamental principles of data protection.\u201d\n\nFacebook director and associate general counsel Harry Kinmonth said: \u201cWe are pleased to have reached a settlement with the ICO. As we have said before, we wish we had done more to investigate claims about Cambridge Analytica in 2015.\n\n\u201cWe made major changes to our platform back then, significantly restricting the information which app developers could access.\n\n\u201cProtecting people\u2019s information and privacy is a top priority for Facebook, and we are continuing to build new controls to help people protect and manage their information.\u201d\n\nThe ICO\u2019s wider investigation into the use of data analytics for political campaigning is ongoing.\n\nFacebook is now able to continue with its own internal investigations into the Cambridge Analytica scandal on the direction of the ICO.", "description": "The Information Commissioner\u00b4s Office said the tech giant had withdrawn its appeal and would accept the fine without admitting any liability.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/10/wire-20369588-1572431967-915_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
