Chris Murphy, Connecticut Democrat, was deeply disturbed. President Trump had just announced that John R. Bolton would serve as his third appointed national security adviser and Mr. Murphy, a thoroughgoing dove, was alarmed.\n\n\u201cJohn Bolton is being picked for the top non-confirmable national security job because a Senate that confirmed DeVos, Zinke, Price, and Pruitt will not confirm Bolton for anything [because] he is too extreme,\u201d the senator tweeted. \u201cNoodle that for a second.\u201d\n\nNow that Mr. Trump has heaved Mr. Bolton overboard, Mr. Murphy suddenly has second thoughts about Mr. Bolton\u2019s place in the administration. It turns out, you see, that Mr. Bolton was a stabilizing influence.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m legitimately shaken by the grave instability of American foreign policy today,\u201d the senator tweeted after news of Mr. Bolton\u2019s ouster emerged earlier this week. \u201cI\u2019m no Bolton fan, but the world is coming apart, and the revolving door of U.S. leadership is disappearing America from the world just at the moment where a stable American hand is most needed.\u201d\n\nSo, just to get this straight: Mr. Bolton was too extreme, but removing him over policy disagreements \u2014 a normal part of any presidential administration \u2014 is a sign of \u201cgrave instability.\u201d This gives new meaning to \u201cdamned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nMr. Murphy is hardly the only hypocrite who decried Mr. Bolton\u2019s appointment, only to furrow his brows and clutch his pearls over the now-former NSA\u2019s defenestration.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, no fan of Mr. Bolton until roughly five minutes ago, decried his \u201csudden departure\u201d as a \u201csymbol of the disarray that has unnerved our allies since day one of the Trump Administration.\u201d Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat, said that Mr. Bolton\u2019s firing \u201cis just the latest example of his government by-chaos-approach.\u201d\n\nHe added, dishonestly, that \u201cwhen Ambassador Bolton\u2019s extreme views aren\u2019t enough for you, the United States is headed for even more chaotic times.\u201d But, of course, Mr. Bolton was fired precisely because the president found him too extreme on foreign policy, opposing his signature peace negotiations with North Korea and the Taliban, for instance.\n\nSamantha Power, the former Obama administration official chalked up Mr. Bolton\u2019s departure to \u201cinstability at the center of the government that is the most powerful in the world.\u201d \u201cNeverTrump\u201d columnist Max Boot put it more hilariously than most: \u201cJohn Bolton was bad. His departure might be worse.\u201d\n\nMr. Bolton was reported to have supported launching preemptive military operations against Iranian targets. Wouldn\u2019t that have been the definition of \u201cinstability\u201d? Yet now that the chance of that happening has receded markedly, Mr. Trump\u2019s political opponents can only carp about instability and chaos.\n\nThere\u2019s an old saying that \u201cif you find yourself in a hole, stop digging.\u201d The Democrats apparently have a new line: \u201cIf you find yourself in a hole, don\u2019t stop digging. After all, that would be a sign of instability.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Ethan Epstein is deputy opinion editor of The Washington Times.
