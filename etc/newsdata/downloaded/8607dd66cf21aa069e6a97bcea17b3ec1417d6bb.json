We were parents. We went ballistic.'\n\nAssad and his family were met at the border by a smuggler who took them into Raqqa in Syria, where he was reunited with his sons.\n\n'I told them (ISIS) I was just coming for a visit, they said there's no visits \u2026 only migration,' Assad explained.\n\n'They gave me a paper, an exemption, to stay in Islamic State as a citizen, I'm not allowed to carry any weapons, or talk on behalf of ISIS.'\n\nAssad stayed in Raqqa for a year and a half and said he was doing nothing but trying to keep his daughters safe from airstrikes.\n\nIn the same year the family arrived in Syria, his then 15-year-old daughter married Australian Mohammed Masri.\n\nAssad's two sons were killed by airstrikes in Raqqa. They had allegedly left for Syria with Masri, having worked in the same profession fitting air-conditioning and refrigeration in Sydney.\n\nThe 51-year-old former Crown Security employee claims he was prompted to travel the war-torn country after receiving a call from his sons, Allah Qadeem and Abdul Khader.

They came for the same reason ... it was all over the news ... come and help us ... people screaming, people dying,' Assad said.\n\nAssad was asked if he would have been safer to leave his family in Australia when he went to Syria for his sons.\n\nHe said: 'I wasn't really thinking at the time. I did a stupid mistake, it was a stupid mistake.'\n\nAssad is one of 5000 foreigners from more than 50 countries being held in prisons across northeast Syria.\n\nHis wife Bassima, daughters Shayma, Maysa and Assia, and his grandchildren are being held in the overcrowded Al Hawl camp.\n\nAssad asked for news of his family during his interview with AAP, saying: 'What's happening outside? With the women?'\n\nAssad claims he was never an ISIS believer as his 'brain is not twisted to them'.\n\nSpeaking through tears, the 51-year-old said was unsure if he would be reunited with his family again and he just wanted to get back to Australia.\n\n'I probably failed (to protect my family). Please (tell the kids) I love them very much, I miss them a lot. Please do your best to take us out of here,' Assad said.\n\n'If the Australian government thinks we should be in prison in Australia, so be it.'", "description": "Ahmad Assad says he became stuck in the region in 2015 after travelling from Sydney, via Lebanon, with his wife and young children to meet his two sons at the border of Turkey and Syria.", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press", "Zoe Zaczek For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/06/19353102-0-image-a-56_1570341425581.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
