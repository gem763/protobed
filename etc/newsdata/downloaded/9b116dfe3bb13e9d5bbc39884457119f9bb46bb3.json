Mr Kahrmann died from a blood clot in July 2014\n\nUnhappy with the way the transaction had taken place, the sisters handed their \u00a31.1m shares of the money back to his estate to be divided between his beneficiaries.\n\nBut Mrs Harrison-Morgan refused to give back the money, sparking a long and expensive court battle.\n\nIn a trial last year, Alice Kahrmann and her mother, Mme De Muller, challenged Mrs Harrison-Morgan's refusal to return the money, but saw their case dismissed by Judge Richard Hacon.\n\nMme De Muller has since died, aged 70 in January, but her daughter is fighting on alone, hauling her father's ex to the Court of Appeal in an attempt to get the \u00a32.2m back.\n\nRepresenting Alice, who is personal representative of her late father's estate, Penelope Reed QC argued that the profits of the property deals are rightly part of Mr Kahrmann's estate.\n\nHe died intestate, meaning his money would be divided between his children, Mme De Muller - who he was long separated from but still married to - having died.\n\nMrs Harrison-Morgan was not married to Mr Kahrmann or named in a valid will and so is entitled to nothing from his estate.\n\n'In this case, there was no lawful basis for Mrs Harrison-Morgan to receive the money which should have gone to the estate,' Mrs Reed told three senior judges.\n\n'She should never have received the money and must now return the benefit of it to the estate by way of money had and received.'\n\nShe argued that Judge Hacon was wrong last year in saying the estate's claim to the \u00a32.2m had 'no foundation'.\n\n'On any view, the deceased's share of the profits should have gone to the estate,' she told the judges.\n\n'He was plainly entitled to this money had he been alive, and that entitlement passed to the estate.'\n\nThe judge had allowed Mrs Harrison-Morgan to 'walk away with a vast sum of money at the expense of the deceased's beneficiaries,' she added.\n\nBut in her evidence last year, Mrs Harrison-Morgan insisted she had a 'loving relationship' with Mr Kahrmann and he intended she would get cash from the sale.\n\n'Rainer fully intended to make sure that myself and the boys were looked after from the proceeds of sale,' she insisted.\n\n'There's absolutely no doubt in my mind that that is what he intended.'\n\nShe said part of the property deal involved her own home of 23 years and it would not have gone through without her agreeing to leave.\n\nIn the Court of Appeal, her barrister, Clifford Darton QC, said the \u00a32.2m was her payment for agreeing to get out of the maisonette.\n\n'Mr Kahrmann's entitlement to 50% of the profit from the sale had always been predicated on the basis that he would deliver vacant possession,' he said.\n\n'After 3 July 2014, such possession could only be achieved with the consent of Mrs Harrison-Morgan or as a result of a successful claim against her.\n\n'The payment was made...under a contract under seal and in consideration for Mrs Harrison-Morgan's vacation of the property and any claims over it.'\n\nHowever, Mrs Reed, for Alice, insisted that Judge Hacon was wrong and the money should be paid back to the estate.\n\n'She effectively intercepted a legal benefit which the estate was entitled to receive...and which, but for her intervention, would have gone to the estate either directly or indirectly,' she said.\n\n'The enrichment was unjust in the sense that it was made without any lawful basis whatsoever and they were made without the lawful authority of the personal representatives of the estate.\n\n'It is therefore submitted that the personal representatives of the estate were entitled to recover the benefit of this payment from Ms Harrison-Morgan.'\n\nThe judges - Lord Justice Floyd, Lady Justice King and Lord Justice Henderson - reserved their decision in the case until a later date.", "description": "In a Court of Appeal battle, Rainer Kahrmann's daughter is fighting to make her father's former partner give back \u00a32.2m from deals including the sale of a Belgravia mansion in London.", "authors": ["Joe Middleton For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/10/20027860-0-image-a-17_1571735603929.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
