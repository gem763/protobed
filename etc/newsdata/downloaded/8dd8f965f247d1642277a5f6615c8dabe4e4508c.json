That\u2019s the expected thing to do, of course.\n\nHow long will Ramsey be gone?\n\nBut when that player is Ramsey and his absence is left open-ended, it leaves questions open about when or if he\u2019ll actually return to the Jaguars.\n\nIn the same week he's called out sick with the flu and a back injury, Jalen Ramsey is taking an open-ended leave from the Jaguars. (Getty)\n\nRamsey wants out\n\nRamsey reportedly requested a trade from the Jaguars last week following an on-field confrontation with Marrone during Jacksonville\u2019s Week 2 loss to the Houston Texans.\n\nHe later said that his request didn\u2019t stem from the blowup with Marrone, but because of \u201cdisrespectful things\u201d that were said to him after the game.\n\nCalled in sick twice this week\n\nHe played in Jacksonville\u2019s Week 3 win over the Tennessee Titans, but has since called in sick from practice, citing the flu for his absence on Monday.\n\nOn Wednesday, he sat out practice again, this time citing a back injury.\n\nAnd now he has an open-ended leave from the team to attend his daughter\u2019s birth in Nashville.\n\nIncomplete information\n\nStory continues\n\nCertainly there\u2019s a chance that Ramsey caught the flu and suffered a back injury all in the same week that he\u2019s leaving town for childbirth in the midst of a conflict with the team over a trade demand.\n\nAny speculation otherwise could easily be addressed by the team with a note about when he\u2019s expected to return.\n\nBut there was no note on that front, leaving the entire situation up to conjecture.\n\nThe Jaguars face the Broncos in Denver on Sunday. Whether Ramsey plays will provide a better gauge of what\u2019s actually happening behind closed doors.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n", "description": "In the same week he's called out sick with the flu and a back injury, Jalen Ramsey is taking an open-ended leave from the Jaguars.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/dTFEMsRsw5qLltotnsHKpQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/vraTsEHCJzUbnoI74XqGNQ--~B/aD0yNjYxO3c9Mzk5MTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/aafa98b0-da41-11e9-abff-713197f9908b", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
