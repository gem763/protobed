Bachmeier made a sterling debut leading the Broncos back from an 18-point deficit to beat Florida State 36-31 in the season opener on the road. Trailing 31-13, Boise State outscored the Seminoles 23-0 over the final 34 minutes to pull off the victory. Marshall opened with a 56-17 romp over VMI. The 56 points were its most since a 62-0 win over Morgan State in 2016.\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH\n\nMarshall: QB Isaiah Green. He will need to be great against the Broncos if Marshall is going to hang around. He had a pretty good start to the season last week throwing for a career-high four touchdowns. The Broncos defense also gave up two touchdowns of 50 or more yards in the opener so there could be chances for big plays.\n\nBoise State: RB Robert Mahone. He rushed for 142 yards and two touchdowns in the win over Florida State, and averaged nearly 6 yards per carry. It\u2019s a pretty good start for a program trying to continue a 10-year streak of having a 1,000-yard rusher. He\u2019ll be challenged by a Marshall defense that has not allowed a 100-yard rusher in the past 15 games.\n\nFACTS & FIGURES\n\nThe only other series meeting was in the 1994 FCS national semifinals, won by the Broncos 28-24. \u2026 Marshall has lost 15 straight games against ranked opponents, with its last win coming in 2003 over then-No. 6 Kansas State. Marshall had a close call in 2010, losing 24-21 against then-No. 22 West Virginia. \u2026 Boise State ran 108 offensive plays in the opener against Florida State. \u2026 The teams will complete the two-game series next year with a return game at Marshall. \u2026 It will be the first game on a new version of Boise\u2019s blue turf.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Marshall (1-0) at No. 24 Boise State (1-0), Friday at 9 p.m. ET (ESPN2).", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/04/boise_st_florida_st_football_92407_c0-102-2437-1522_s1770x1032.jpg?6ad676e44adff6edf3665f81704c9164673817b9"}
