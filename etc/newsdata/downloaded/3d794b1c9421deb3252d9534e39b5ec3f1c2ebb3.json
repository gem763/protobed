We were all in trauma.\n\n\"All social services want to do is get the quickest, cheapest option.\"\n\nSir James also raises questions about the assessment of kinship carers and their suitability.\n\nIt's not \"always as careful and detailed as they should be\" and \"must be\" improved\", he says.\n\nImage copyright PA Media Image caption Sir James Munby retired in 2018\n\n\"Did anyone come to see how these children were?\" asks Mary.\n\n\"If nanny and granddad are the nice nanny and granddad that they're supposed to be?\n\n\"No. Nobody checked up.\n\n\"It's drop and run.\n\n\"It's a hard slog, because all the children are damaged.\n\n\"They were being abused, neglected, mentally abused and physically abused.\n\n\"The children weren't clean. They were without food. The mess in the bedroom was as high as the bed.\n\n\"The policewoman said she'd never seen anything like it.\"\n\n'So vulnerable'\n\nMary says she reported the situation to social services numerous times and the children were finally taken out the home after one of the children was \"throttled\", leaving a mark noticed by teachers at school.\n\nThe grandmother says she'd previously seen burn marks on their arms and red hand-shaped marks on their faces.\n\n\"When I look back now, we were so vulnerable. We should have looked into it more,\" she says.\n\nBut, recalling the moment when social services and the police came to their home to persuade them to take the children, she feels she had no other option.\n\n\"It's the way they're using words, they're forcing you,\" she says.\n\nMary says the financial pressure means they may have to sell their house and downsize.\n\nWhen the birth mother recently went to court over contact time, she received legal aid - but the grandparents, unlike foster parents, had to cover their own legal fees.\n\n\"These parents still have the power to damage their children even though they're not looking after them anymore,\" Mary says.\n\nAs we talk, the grandson at her side throws his arms round her.\n\n\"He's a good boy,\" she says.\n\n\"We've given the children better than they had, no doubt, but I thought we'd be able to give them the fun things in life.\"", "description": "A grandmother, 72, says social services gave her no option but to take in a relative's six children.", "authors": ["Luke Jones", "Bbc Radio World At One"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1641B/production/_109436119_grandparents-lotsofkids.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
