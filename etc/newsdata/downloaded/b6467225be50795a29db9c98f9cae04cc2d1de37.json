The killers left the victim inside a recently stolen vehicle with license plates SRD-8250 along one of the main avenues in the Monterrey metropolitan area. Police found a threatening message left by the killers claiming that a state police leader had stolen a drug load.\n\nSources consulted by Breitbart Texas revealed that there was no stolen drug shipment. The body left along Morones Prieto Avenue message was meant to intimidate state police intelligence agents and investigators who had been targeting his organization, officials stated.\n\nSoon after the murder, authorities arrested four assassins who have been identified as Jorge Arnoldo Villalobos Carrillo, Jose Carlos Pe\u00f1a Hern\u00e1ndez, Mario Rodriguez Velazquez, and Luis Enrique Trevi\u00f1o Rodriguez. The suspects are described by Mexican military intelligence officials as being part of the inner circle in Gato\u2019s criminal organization.\n\nBased out of the ritzy suburb of San Pedro and once part of the Beltran Leyva Cartel, El Gato and his men control the local drug distribution, extort major businesses, and run a massive tax fraud operation.\n\nIn order to control his criminal empire, El Gato, a former federale himself, has developed a network of law enforcement officials in local state and federal agencies that provide him with protection and information.\n\nVillarreal Hernandez is currently wanted in the U.S. for allegedly ordering the murder of Gulf Cartel attorney-turned-government informant Jesus Guerrero Chapa. Guerrero Chapa was living in the Dallas suburb of Southlake when gunmen murdered him after a long-term surveillance operation. Villarreal had a personal vendetta against Guerrero Chapa, who he blamed for the murder of his father\n\nBreitbart Texas obtained exclusive access to an intelligence report from this week\u2019s murder, that revealed that authorities tracked the four gunmen to San Pedro where they caught up with them in a Mazda automobile with license plates SNW-2270. At the time of the arrest, the gunmen had two rifles, a handgun, and drugs in their possession. Both the license plates in the Mazda and the minivan used to dump the body had been switched prior to the crime. The report also revealed that one of the gunmen has been linked to another cartel execution earlier this year in the parking lot of a Costco store.\n\nAs Breitbart Texas has reported, El Gato has previously threatened top officials with the Nuevo Leon State Investigations Agency, blaming them for the arrest and upcoming extradition of his brother Ramon \u201cMon\u201d Villarreal and the arrest of his top lieutenant Luis Lauro \u201cLa Mora\u201d Ramirez Bautista. After each of those high-profile arrests, El Gato targeted state officials and threatened individual agents.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila, and Nuevo Le\u00f3n to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities. The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used.
