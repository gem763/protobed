Photo: HBO\n\nSure, you could go into HBO\u2019s Watchmen cold. Though inspired by the landmark graphic novel written by Alan Moore, with art by Dave Gibbons and colors by John Higgins, the new \u201cremix\u201d series is very much its own thing, running with the book\u2019s characters and ideas in whatever directions appeal to creator Damon Lindelof. But if you\u2019ve never read the book \u2014 you should, it\u2019s great \u2014 or haven\u2019t read it in a while or, gasp, have only seen Zack Snyder\u2019s film version, it\u2019s not a bad idea to familiarize yourself with some of its key players and events.\n\nThe Watchmen series is set in a version of 2019 that\u2019s still feeling the impact of what happens in the book\u2019s version of 1985. And though it\u2019s filled with new characters played by Regina King, Tim Blake Nelson, and others, that doesn\u2019t mean some familiar faces don\u2019t make appearances as well (sometimes in unexpected places, but we\u2019re not going to spoil who or where). Below you\u2019ll find a guide to some of the key players in the Watchmen universe, and the impact they\u2019ve had on the familiar-but-different universe in which they live.\n\nOne note: In 2012, DC Comics published a batch of miniseries collectively known as Before Watchmen that delved into the lives of key characters prior to the events of the novel. More recently, writer Geoff Johns and artist Gary Frank teamed up for the still-in-progress Doomsday Clock, a crossover between the Watchmen universe and the main DC Comics universe. Since nothing in Lindelof\u2019s series suggests it regards these as canonical, this article ignores them (though some of them are worth your time).\n\nHooded Justice\n\nPhoto: DC Comics/Comixology\n\nThe Watchmen universe doesn\u2019t start to peel off from our own until 1938. In both universes, that year saw the publication of the first issue of Action Comics, which introduced Superman and ushered in the age of superheroes, an age confined to the realm of fiction in our world. In the world of Watchmen, however, 1938 saw the debut of real-world masked avengers who took to the streets to fight crime, Nazis, and other threats to New York.\n\nWhether or not Hooded Justice took inspiration from Superman remains an open question. In fact, Moore and Gibbons leave much about Hooded Justice an open question. Little is known about why he began brawling with would-be robbers in the fall of 1938. Little is known of his final fate, either. He disappeared after refusing to reveal his identity to the House Un-American Activities Committee. In the interim he became a member of the Minutemen, an affiliation of masked heroes. During this time, he interrupted the Comedian\u2019s sexual assault of Sally Jupiter, the first hero to take the name Silk Spectre. And though Hooded Justice was linked to Jupiter romantically, this was a cover for his relationship with Minutemen founder Captain Metropolis. (More on all of this below.) In his memoir, Hollis Mason, the first Nite Owl, speculates that Hooded Justice might have been Rolf M\u00fcller, a weightlifter murdered not long after Hooded Justice\u2019s disappearance.\n\nCaptain Metropolis\n\nPhoto: DC Comics/Comixology\n\nInspired by Hooded Justice, wealthy military hero Nelson Gardner adopted the identity of Captain Metropolis and eventually founded the Minutemen, a team of likeminded masked adventurers. The team disbanded under political pressure from HUAC in the late \u201940s. When a second generation of masked adventurers emerged, he tried to organize them as another team he dubbed \u201cCrimebusters,\u201dwith little luck.\n\nSilk Spectre (Sally Jupiter)\n\nPhoto: DC Comics/Comixology\n\nA masked adventurer with a keen interest in becoming a celebrity, Sally Jupiter (born Sally Juspeczyk) joined the Minutemen with the help of her manager, and later husband, Laurence Schexnayder. The Comedian\u2019s sexual assault of Jupiter helped sour the chemistry of the Minutemen. Years later, shortly after her marriage, Jupiter began a consensual affair with the Comedian that resulted in a pregnancy. Born Laurie Juspeczyk, their child would later become the second Silk Spectre.\n\nThe Comedian\n\nPhoto: DC Comics/Comixology\n\nWatchmen is, among other things, a murder mystery about the death of Eddie Blake, the masked adventurer turned government enforcer known as the Comedian. Known for his violent tendencies and right-wing politics, the Comedian stayed in the adventuring world after the dissolution of the Minutemen, serving in Vietnam and helping to quell the anti-superhero protests of the \u201970s. The Comedian continued his career after the Keene Act compelled masked adventurers to reveal their identities and work for the government. His death, following his discovery of Ozymandias\u2019s plan (see below), sets the events of the graphic novel in motion.\n\nNite Owl (Hollis Mason)\n\nPhoto: DC Comics/Hoopla\n\nThe first masked adventurer to take on the Nite Owl identity, Hollis Mason retired with the dissolution of the Minutemen and began a seemingly long and happy career as a mechanic and mentor to Dan Dreiberg, the second Nite Owl.\n\nMuch of what we know about The Minutemen\u2019s history comes from his memoir, Under the Hood, which can be read in the back pages of the first three Watchmen issues.\n\nDoctor Manhattan\n\nPhoto: DC Comics/Comixology\n\nThe only member of the Watchmen universe to possess superpowers, Doctor Manhattan came into being after nuclear physicist Jon Osterman became trapped inside a sealed chamber used to test nuclear energy. Disassembled at the atomic level, Osterman returns (sort of) as the nearly godlike Doctor Manhattan.\n\nWhere the appearance of vigilantes in the \u201930s and \u201940s slightly diverted the course of the Watchmen universe from our own, Doctor Manhattan\u2019s arrival violently disrupts it. Though he becomes a celebrity and a superhero, Doctor Manhattan\u2019s presence creates a kind of global existential crisis. How is humanity supposed to define itself in the presence of such a being? Doctor Manhattan also interferes with history itself, at least as we know it: The United States wins the war in Vietnam, eventually absorbing the country as the 51st state.\n\nThough Doctor Manhattan begins a high-profile relationship with Laurie Juspeczyk, he becomes increasingly alienated from humanity. Hounded by the press as the events of Watchmen intensify, he retreats to Mars where he builds castles with his mind and reveals Laurie\u2019s true parentage to her. As the book ends, he suggests he plans to leave our galaxy for \u201cone less complicated.\u201d\n\nSilk Spectre (Laurie Juspeczyk)\n\nPhoto: DC Comics/Hoopla\n\nThe child of Sally Jupiter and Eddie Blake, Laurie adopts the Silk Spectre mantle and takes the crimefighting side of the job more seriously than her mother. Her romance with Doctor Manhattan blossoms into an ongoing partnership, but that relationship has already hit the skids as Moore and Gibbons\u2019s Watchmen opens. Eventually, Laurie embarks on a new romance with Dan Dreiberg, the second Nite Owl, after they bond during a night of illicit crimefighting in defiance of the Keene Act.\n\nRorschach\n\nPhoto: DC Comics/Comixology\n\nA vigilante with an unflinching sense of right and wrong, Rorschach opens the book with narration from his journal, which serves as running commentary throughout Watchmen \u2014 and later as a key plot device. The product of a troubled childhood, Rorschach served as a frequent partner to the second Nite Owl in the pre\u2013Keene Act days. Apart from Nite Owl, however, he largely kept to himself, and continued his crimefighting activities even after they were outlawed. Rorschach\u2019s investigation into the murder of the Comedian opens Watchmen, and though he eventually solves it, he doesn\u2019t make it to the end of the book alive.\n\nRichard Nixon\n\nPhoto: DC Comics/Hoopla\n\nThe 37th president in the world of Watchmen, as in ours, Richard Nixon is entering his fifth term as the book opens, his power bolstered by his success in Vietnam. (The Comedian also makes an allusion to ridding Nixon of some troublesome journalists.) Despite his success in Southeast Asia, Nixon and advisors like Henry Kissinger have done little to calm the Cold War in their universe. Tensions mount throughout the novel, and the world appears to be on the verge of a nuclear catastrophe after the Soviets invade Afghanistan.\n\nThe Knot Tops\n\nPhoto: DC Comics/Hoopla\n\nThe New York of Watchmen is filled with teens and young adults wearing a distinctive knotted hairstyle that seems to have some links to a musical subculture whose most successful members include the band Pale Horse, who have an ill-timed Madison Square Garden engagement near the climax of the book. Some members of the Knot Tops have violent criminal tendencies, including the group that murders Hollis Mason. Others seem happy just to paint graffiti of lovers in silhouette, an image inspired by the shadows of those killed at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nNite Owl (Dan Dreiberg)\n\nPhoto: DC Comics/Hoopla\n\nA brilliant inventor inspired by Hollis Mason\u2019s Nite Owl career, Dan Dreiberg adopted the Nite Owl name and became part of a second wave of masked adventurers that included the second Silk Spectre, Rorschach, Doctor Manhattan, and Ozymandias. Running with the owl theme, Dreiberg creates a costume more birdlike than Mason\u2019s and an Owlship capable of hovering in place, which he uses to patrol the city by air. As the book opens, he\u2019s left all that behind him after the passage of the Keene Act and appears to be in the midst of a terminal funk that is shaken only by his unexpected return to crimefighting, a return inspired by the reappearance of Rorschach and Silk Spectre.\n\nOzymandias\n\nPhoto: DC Comics/Hoopla\n\nAnother hero capable of committing to a theme, Adrian Veidt goes full Egyptian for his adventuring exploits, borrowing his name from the Greek name for Ramesses II, as immortalized in Percy Shelley\u2019s poem, \u201cOzymandias.\u201d But Veidt owes his true inspiration to Alexander the Great and his world-conquering ambitions. Using his vast wealth, Veidt has amassed a globe-spanning business empire as Watchmen opens. When Watchmen closes, we\u2019ve come to learn the true purpose of that empire. Veidt has trained all his resources on saving the world, a feat he accomplishes through an act of unfathomable mass murder. (And for those who\u2019ve only seen the Watchmen movie, here\u2019s where it diverges from the book.)\n\nAs Cold War tensions mount, Veidt teleports what appears to be a squid from another universe into Manhattan, killing millions but compelling the nations of Earth to put aside their differences and unite against what they perceive to be a common threat. It\u2019s an unspeakable act but it works, ushering in a new era of peace on Earth, and witnesses like Doctor Manhattan, Silk Spectre, and Nite Owl agree not to expose the truth of it in the interest of the greater good. Only Rorschach, determined to live and die by his unshakable sense of good and evil, remains committed to revealing the truth at all costs, prompting Doctor Manhattan to kill him. Unbeknownst to the others, however, Rorschach has mailed his journal to the right-wing fringe publication, The New Frontiersman, and the novel ends with the unresolved possibility that its publication will undo Veidt\u2019s monstrous-but-effective achievement. (But perhaps Veidt also had some plans to occasionally reinforce the possibility of a squid invasion, lest people forget the threat? That might undermine the journal\u2019s legitimacy.)\n\nRobert Redford\n\nPhoto: DC Comics/Hoopla\n\nIn the final pages of Watchmen, a newspaper headline and a line of dialogue reference Robert Redford potentially running for president in 1988. \u201cWho wants a cowboy actor in the White House?\u201d one character scoffs, in a winking reference to the actor with the same initials who became president. It\u2019s a funny joke, and one worth remembering before watching the HBO series.", "description": "HBO\u2019s new series from David Lindelof expands Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons\u2019s landmark graphic novel, but incorporates key characters and events from the original story.
