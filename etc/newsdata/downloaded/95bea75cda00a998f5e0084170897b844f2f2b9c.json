(Photo: JC Olivera, Getty Images)\n\nMindy Kaling may be the brainchild behind the Emmy-nominated sitcom \"The Mindy Project,\" but she once had to fight the Television Academy to be eligible for a nomination in the first place.\n\nIn an interview for Elle's 2019 Women in Hollywood issue, Kaling shared that the Television Academy almost cut her name from the list of producers for \"The Office\" because there were just \"too many.\"\n\nAt the time, Kaling was the only woman and the only person of color in the sitcom's writer's room, and if her name were taken off the list she wouldn't have been eligible for the Emmy for outstanding comedy series like the rest of her colleagues.\n\n\"They made me, not any of the other producers, fill out a whole form and write an essay about all my contributions as a writer and a producer,\" Kaling told Elle. \"I had to get letters from all the other male, white producers saying that I had contributed, when my actual record stood for itself.\"\n\nIt\u2019s not clear if Kaling was asked to provide materials beyond what was required of the other producers.\n\nAfter advocating for herself, Kaling's name was eventually included in the final list, but \"The Office\" didn't end up winning the Emmy.\n\nThe Television Academy responded to the actress' claims in a statement obtained by USA TODAY.\n\n\"No one person was singled out,\u201d Jim Yeager, TV Academy spokesperson, said in a statement to USA TODAY. \"There was an increasing concern years ago regarding the number of performers and writers seeking producer credits. At the time the Producers Guild worked with the Television Academy to correctly vet producer eligibility. Every performer/producer and writer/producer was asked to justify their producer credits. We no longer require this justification from performer/producers and writer/producers, but we do continue to vet consulting producer credits with the PGA to ensure those credited are actually functioning in the role as a producer.\u201d\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to \"The Office\" creator Greg Daniels for comment.\n\nKaling said it doesn't matter how successful or famous she is, she still faces discrimination.\n\n\"It really doesn\u2019t matter how much money I have,\u201d Kaling says. \u201cI\u2019m treated badly with enough regularity that it keeps me humble.\u201d\n\nShe also recalls a time when she was stopped on the set of her own show, \"The Mindy Project,\" when a security guard told her she was on a closed set, thinking the actress had stumbled onto the lot.\n\nKaling pointed at a billboard with her face on it and said: \"I know. I'm the star.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/09/mindy-kaling-the-office-emmy-nominations-academy-responds/3921084002/", "description": "Mindy Kaling shared that the Television Academy almost cut her name from the list of producers for \"The Office\" because there were just \"too many.\"", "authors": ["Rasha Ali", "Published P.M.
