I love her!\n\n\u201cIt would have been great to have done it on Enable (in the Arc de Triomphe a fortnight ago) but what a number\u2026 It must be a European record.\u201d\n\nStradivarius gave his all in an epic duel with Kew Gardens as both swapped the lead as they hit the final-furlong marker.\n\nJust a nose separated them on the line but it was sufficient to bring to an end the winning streak for John Gosden\u2019s redoubtable stayer, dating back to when he was third in the same race in 2017.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Too much of a slog\u2019 \u2013\n\nGosden took defeat philosophically, saying they had been close to pulling Stradivarius out due to the heavy conditions.\n\n\u201cIt is Champions Day and you let the day down if you do not run Stradivarius,\u201d sad Gosden.\n\n\u201cHe found it too much of a slog on the ground but he\u2019s run a wonderful race. He came back and had a whinny, so he\u2019s happy.\n\n\u201cWe will be back for the Ascot Gold Cup (he has won the last two).\u201d\n\nThere is a tantalising prospect of a rematch with Kew Gardens in next year\u2019s Gold Cup.\n\n\u201cKew Gardens is an incredible horse and it was a great performance,\u201d said trainer Aidan O\u2019Brien.\n\n\u201cWe were thinking about the Gold Cup this year and if the lads (the owners) decide to keep him in training, which I think there is a strong chance they will, he could well go for the Gold Cup.\u201d\n\nGosden, like Dettori, bore a happier face when he welcomed back Star Catcher half an hour after Stradivarius\u2019s heart-breaking defeat \u2014 sweeter too at the expense of O\u2019Brien\u2019s 25/1 shot Delphinia.\n\nGosden said he had remained calm whilst he saddled her following Stradivarius\u2019s defeat.\n\n\u201cYou have to remain calm and collected for the horses,\u201d said the 68-year-old Englishman.\n\n\u201cYou are no damn good if you are jumping around and being neurotic, and when you start saddling them they feel your nerves.\n\n\u201cYou need to be calm.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018He will be remembered\u2019 \u2013\n\nAndrew Balding could have been forgiven for shedding a tear as Donjuan Triumphant won the first race, the Sprint.\n\nIn what is his last race, he gave Thai owners King Power Racing their first Group One winner \u2014 he was the first horse the late Leicester City owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha bought.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fantastic for King Power, a first Group One winner and this was the first horse the Chairman (Vichai) ever bought so it\u2019s all got symmetry, it\u2019s lovely,\u201d said Balding.\n\nO\u2019Brien was to round off the day with his doughty filly Magical taking the Champion Stakes \u2014 the first in the race for the trainer \u2014 and declared her the \u201cultimate racehorse\u201d.\n\nRichard Hannon Junior\u2019s King of Change took the honours under Sean Levey in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes.\n\n\u201cPeople thought I was a little bit petulant after the 2000 Guineas for not celebrating being second,\u201d said Hannon.\n\n\u201cHowever, you do not remember who is second. Now he will be remembered.\u201d", "description": "Ascot (United Kingdom) (AFP) \u2013 Legendary jockey Frankie Dettori enjoyed a sweet and sour Champions Day at Ascot on Saturday, as the joy of his 250th", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/ef544d_legendary-jockey-frankie-dettori-recorded-his-250th-group-one-success-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
