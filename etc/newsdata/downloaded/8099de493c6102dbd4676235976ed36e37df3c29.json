(CGC) recently was downgraded to Sell with a D+ rating by TheStreet's Quant Ratings.\n\nPot stocks have been struggling in the second half of 2019, and this one is a poster child of misery. The trend is in place, and it's all downhill. At some point it will stop, but for now it continues to be a great short opportunity.\n\nMoney flow is poor while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is steep and bending lower. The cloud has been red and pointed lower for months; Canopy Growth could find itself in the mid- teens before too long.\n\nStops are at the top of the channel, around $22.\n\nCarnival Corp.\n\nCarnival Corp. (CCL) recently was downgraded to Hold with a C+ rating by TheStreet's Quant Ratings.\n\nWhile consumers may still be robust spenders, some of the travel companies are not so sure. Carnival got hammered over the last two quarters and continues to make lower lows.\n\nThe recent bear flag (hockey stick) is a good chance to get a short working, around the low $40s area. The cloud is red and widening while relative strength is weak with a very steep angle.\n\nMore downside is coming.\n\nThis commentary is an excerpt from \"5 Bearish Bets\" a weekly feature sent to subscribers of Trifecta Stocks.
