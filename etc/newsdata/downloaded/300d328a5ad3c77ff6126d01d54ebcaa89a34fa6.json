BTC is likely to rise slowly unless it breaks the $8,000 support area.\n\nBitcoin Price Analysis\n\nAfter bitcoin failed near the $8,500 resistance, there was a downside correction against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD traded below the $8,400 and $8,300 levels. Moreover, there was a break below the $8,200 level. However, the 100 hourly simple moving average acted as a support and a low was formed near $8,175. Recently, the price started a fresh increase and traded above the $8,300 level.\n\nThere was a break above the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $8,536 high to $8,175 low. The price climbed above the $8,350 level and tested the $8,400 resistance. It seems like the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $8,536 high to $8,175 low is currently acting as a resistance. If there is an upside break above $8,400, the price is likely to retest $8,500.\n\nIf the bulls manage to surpass the $8,500 barrier, there are chances of more upsides. The next stop for them could be near the $8,800 level. The next key resistance area is near the $9,000 level. On the downside, there is a decent support forming near the $8,250 and $8,200 levels. Moreover, there is a new connecting bullish trend line forming with support near $8,300 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair.\n\nIf there is another decline, the trend line support or $8,250 might prevent losses. If the bulls fail to protect $8,250 and $8,200, the price may perhaps test the $8,000 support. Any further losses may perhaps push the price back into a bearish zone towards $7,500.\n\nLooking at the chart, bitcoin is holding a couple of important supports near $8,200. As long as there is no downside break below $8,200, the price is likely to rise slowly towards the $8,500 resistance or even $8,800.\n\nTechnical indicators:\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD is currently in the bullish zone, with positive signs.\n\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \u2013 The RSI for BTC/USD is currently correcting lower towards 55 and 50.\n\nMajor Support Levels \u2013 $8,200 followed by $8,000.\n\nMajor Resistance Levels \u2013 $8,400, $8,500 and $8,800.", "description": "Bitcoin price is showing signs of an extended recovery above $8,500 against the US Dollar.
