John Bel Edwards on economy in first debate", "language": "en", "text": "Louisiana\u2019s gubernatorial candidates sparred on taxes and economic issues Thursday night but displayed surprising unanimity on many other hot-button topics.\n\nFor example, all three insisted they were firm supporters of the Second Amendment and would not favor the implementation of statewide background checks on all firearm purchases in the Pelican State.\n\nIncumbent Democrat John Bel Edwards, the only Democratic chief executive left in the Deep South, joined his two Republican challengers in saying that not only would they veto any such measure should it come to them, but that a restriction on so-called semi-automatic rifles would also fail with them because it would hurt hunters.\n\nSimilarly, all of the candidates adopted absolutist pro-life positions and said that, because they believe life begins at conception, they would not favor even exceptions for abortion in rare cases of rape and incest \u2014 a position that actually puts them at odds with a majority of Louisianians, according to recent polls.\n\nMr. Edwards\u2018 stances mark him as an outsider in the modern Democratic Party but are in line with his attempt to strike a moderate position in a state where President Trump enjoys high popularity ratings.\n\nThe governor came into the debate with a comfortable lead in most polls over Republican Rep. Ralph Abraham and Baton Rouge businessman Eddie Rispone, and Democrats are hopeful that he will garner 50 percent plus 1 of the vote, allowing him to avoid a November runoff against a presumably united GOP challenge.\n\nIn an effort to chip away at that lead, Messrs. Abraham and Rispone tried to score points on economic issues, arguing that Mr. Edwards\u2018 tax increases in his first term have retarded Louisiana\u2019s economic development in a roaring Trump economy.\n\n\u201cWe have the highest sales tax in the nation and that\u2019s why we don\u2019t have the jobs,\u201d Mr. Abraham said. \u201cOur taxes are too high.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe idea we\u2019ve done anything other than grow and strengthen the economy is just false,\u201d Mr. Edwards shot back, citing low unemployment and record personal income figures.\n\nThe debate on the LSU campus, the first of three scheduled, was surprisingly free of partisan rancor, especially given Mr. Rispone\u2019s recent advertising attacks on the other candidates.\n\nDipping into the $11.5 million of his own money Mr. Rispone gave his campaign, the executive has ripped Mr. Edwards as soft on crime and Mr. Abraham as a congressional vote dodger who never fulfilled his promise to donate his salary to charity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting to watch two politicians go after reach other,\u201d Mr. Rispone said at one point. \u201cI\u2019m just a businessman.\u201d\n\nHis quip came during perhaps the most pointed exchange of the night over Mr. Edwards\u2018 expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare.\n\n\u201cThe easiest decision I made as governor was to expand Medicaid,\u201d Mr. Edwards said, arguing the move saved lives.\n\nBut Mr. Abraham said that not only have the ineligible people who got on the rolls cost taxpayers dearly, but a recent cancellation of a major provider contract that has left nearly a half million people uncertain about their coverage was done for political reasons.\n\n\u201cYou are just 100 percent false,\u201d Mr. Edwards shot back, noting the company in question had given to both the Republican and Democratic governors\u2019 associations.\n\nWhen the subject turned to President Trump, Mr. Abraham said he had backed the president since elected, while Mr. Rispone said his success proves that \u201cit takes someone from the outside,\u201d and that he has been unwavering in his support of Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Edwards tread carefully on the topic, saying he had a good working relationship with both the administration and congress.\n\n\u201cIf we will just refuse to become Washington, D.C., our best days are ahead of us,\u201d he added.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
