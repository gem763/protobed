Recommendations are separate from any business incentives.\n\nYou found a stylish sweater at your favorite store that looked great off the rack. But after wearing\u2014and washing\u2014it a few times, you see it\u2019s pilling up, or linting off on everything it brushes against, or even starting to fall apart at the seams. Don\u2019t make that mistake again. We spoke to experts to find out how to choose sweaters that will last.\n\nReach for natural fibers first\n\nCredit: Getty Images / Toxitz Sweaters made of natural fibers like cashmere, wool, or cotton are best.\n\nThe top recommendation from the experts we interviewed: If you want a sweater to be with you for longer than a season, stay away from synthetic yarns containing acrylic, rayon, and/or polyester.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cHigher quality sweaters tend to be composed of natural fibers, such as merino wool, cashmere, alpaca, and linen,\u201d says Celia Cahill, Vice President of Off-Site Education at the Knitting Guild Association. \u201cMany commercial sweaters are made of acrylic and acrylic blends, which are usually easier to care for and washable, but are not as breathable and comfortable to wear, and don't always wear well over time.\u201d\n\nIf possible, try to stick with one natural fabric per sweater, rather than blends. This won\u2019t always be possible\u2014100 percent cashmere sweaters are luxurious, yes, but they often have luxurious price tags to go along with them\u2014but it can be helpful to narrow down your purchasing options if you decide to get sweaters made with only one or two natural fibers. Having a sweater made of just one material also helps prevent pilling and degradation of the sweater over time.\n\nThat said, you don\u2019t have to stick with just one staple natural fiber to fill your sweater drawer. Maggie Mee, head of merchandising at Trunk Club, says buying sweaters in a wide range of fabrics is a great way to keep them in your wardrobe year-round. \u201cI recommend starting with a high-quality cashmere sweater. It's so cozy and makes a timeless addition to your wardrobe that will last for several seasons,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you live in a cooler climate, a wool sweater is great for keeping you warm. Cotton sweaters are perfect fall and spring transition pieces and usually are more cost-effective than heavier sweaters.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nYou can also grab the odd acrylic or poly blend, if it\u2019s a piece you really love and you understand it won\u2019t be the coziest thing you own, and it probably won\u2019t be with you forever.\n\n\u201cThere isn't a universally bad fabric for sweaters, but when you're looking for an investment sweater to last you for years, I'd recommend shoppers steer clear of synthetic polyester,\u201d Mee says. \u201cFor trend pieces that might last one or two seasons, you can play with synthetic fabrics and blends.\u201d\n\nGet a feel for your sweater\n\nCredit: Getty Images / filadendron Touching a sweater is a great way to gauge its quality.\n\nBuying your sweaters in a brick-and-mortar store? Run your hands over them first. If the material feels scratchy, cheap, or just not like something you ever want to put on your body, don\u2019t even bother trying it on. A bad feel is often a sign that that yarn used to make the sweater is of poor quality, even if it\u2019s made of a natural fiber.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cLower quality fibers and blends can tend to feel stiffer, even plasticky,\u201d Cahill says.\n\nOn the other hand, if the fabric feels pliable, tightly woven, and nice against the skin, it\u2019s probably of higher quality. \u201cA good cashmere is extremely soft to the touch,\u201d says Mee. Basically? If it feels good, it\u2019ll look good for longer, too.\n\nPay attention to the patterns\n\nCredit: Getty Images / jacoblund A sweater's patterns should be well-aligned.\n\nYou\u2019re probably already eyeing up the aesthetics of your sweaters, but really take a good look to ensure any details or accents on it are cohesive. If the pattern looks a little wonky (as in mismatching in a weird way, not intentionally asymmetrical) it could be a sign of some other potential long-term longevity issues\u2014not to mention that you might not want to wear the sweater at all, due to the aforementioned uneven pattern. \u201cSweaters with colorwork or stitch patterns can easily have problems with continuity, particularly at the seams,\u201d Cahill says. \u201cThe best quality sweaters make sure the color patterns, such as on a Fair Isle sweater, or stitch patterns, such as on a cable sweater, line up correctly.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nYou can let this standard slide if you have a friend or relative who recently discovered the knitting community on Instagram, likes to show their affection with hand-knitted goods, and is very much not a professional. But if you\u2019re looking for a commercially-made sweater, consistency with the patterns and design are key.\n\nInspect the seams\n\nCredit: Getty Images / Oleg_Ermak The seams can be a sign of whether or not a piece will last.\n\nAny sweater will have seams of some sort\u2014usually around the cuffs, shoulders, and bottom of the sweater\u2014and they can be a telltale sign of whether or not a sweater will last. If you\u2019re looking at a sweater, check to see that the seams are smooth, even, and keep the sweater in a streamlined shape.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cSeams should be sewn and sufficient to hold the weight of the garment, which is particularly important at the shoulders,\u201d Cahill says. \u201cLower quality garments can have puckering or weak seams.\u201d\n\nEyeball the little things\n\nCredit: Getty Images / Denisfilm The buttons on a cardigan should be flat.\n\nTake a look at some other details of the sweater, like its edging and trim details. The edges of your sweater\u2014often ribbing, a pattern of vertical knitted stripes\u2014should not curl upwards, whether you\u2019re wearing it or it\u2019s placed on a flat surface. If it\u2019s a cardigan, make sure the buttons are evenly spaced out, flat, and the thread holding them to the sweater is firm. If the sweater has a zipper, look out for distortion around edges. \u201cIt is common to see rippling of the fabric,\u201d Cahill says. \u201cThe best quality sweater zippers lie flat.\u201d\n\nIf the sweater has pockets, Cahill says to make sure they are integrated smoothly into the garment and don\u2019t flop open or look stretched out.\n\nKeep your sweaters nice\n\nCredit: Getty Images / PobladuraFCG Proper storage is vital for keeping sweaters fresh.\n\nOf course, if you get a great sweater, you need to do your part to make sure it stays in tip-top shape as long as possible. To do this, Mee advises folding your sweaters and placing them in a drawer instead of hanging them. This way, the fabric won\u2019t stretch out or develop lumps where the shoulders drape over the hanger. \u201cI'd also recommend skipping the dryer and laying these flat to dry,\u201d Mee says. \u201cThis will prevent pilling, shrinking, and loss of shape.\u201d\n\nFinally, it\u2019s important to store the sweaters properly over the summer. When you\u2019re ready to put them away, give them a wash. This is vital, according to Cahill, because tiny bits of food and perspiration can fester on the sweater over the summer, which might attract moths and cause an unpleasant smell once you unearth them in the fall.\n\nOnce dry, fold and place them in a container. You can use plastic, wood, or canvas, depending on your preferences.\n\n\u201cPlastic is most popular because they don\u2019t let the critters in, plus they\u2019re light and stackable. Wood also works well,\u201d says Cahill. \u201cCanvas is probably my favorite choice because it breathes, but you have to make sure the canvas weave is small enough that moths can\u2019t get in, plus it\u2019s not as practical when storing large numbers of sweaters because it doesn\u2019t have much structure.\u201d\n\nSmart storage helps prevent fading, pilling, stagnating scents, and keeps moths that love to munch on wool at bay. You can also throw in some natural moth repellents, like pheromone packets or lavender sachets. But steer clear of conventional moth balls, which are noxious and don't even work all that well.\n\nIf you do that, you\u2019ll have a sweater (or several) to stay with you for many years to come.\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.
