Shortly after the election, James Clapper, then the director of National Intelligence, testified before Congress that American intelligence officials could not clearly pinpoint these facts. \u201cWe don\u2019t have good insight into the sequencing of the releases, or when the data may have been provided,\u201d he said. Today, almost two years later, and after months of investigation, we know a lot more than we once did. But our insight into the timing\u2014at least from publicly available information\u2014remains uncertain. The latest indictment issued by Robert Mueller, the special counsel, charged twelve members of the G.R.U., Russia\u2019s military-intelligence directorate, with hacking and disseminating Democratic e-mails and other files during the election. It is a highly detailed document, in many ways remarkable. In it, we learn, for instance, that Western intelligence officers had penetrated the G.R.U. so thoroughly that they could track the keystrokes of individual Russian operatives at their desks in a Moscow building. We learn that these G.R.U. staff members essentially Googled vulnerabilities in the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee before hacking into it. We learn that, from within the D.C.C.C., the G.R.U. hackers moved into the D.N.C. We learn that D.N.C. data were relayed to an American server in Illinois as they were being exfiltrated. We learn that G.R.U. officers used cryptocurrency to pay people around the world to provide things that the operation required\u2014domain names, access to virtual private networks (V.P.N.s). The indictment may only be an accusation, but it hints at the remarkably granular forensic intelligence that has been gathered. The over-all picture that the indictment offers of the \u201cWikiLeaks connection,\u201d as Clapper once put it, is entirely consistent with previous intelligence assessments, which said that the G.R.U. provided Julian Assange, the editor of WikiLeaks, with the D.N.C. and Podesta archives. But, at the level of evidence, the indictment offers a strange mix: tantalizing, fragmentary new details that suggest the when and how without quite revealing everything that happened. Indictments are not the same as intelligence reports. They are sometimes intentionally written ambiguously, to give prosecutors flexibility in the way they decide to prove their case\u2014emphasizing the strongest links in an argument while implying a bigger picture. It is likely that the charged G.R.U. officers will never face trial, but Mueller may still want to retain flexibility, given that his investigation is ongoing. It is also conceivable that this document was rushed out before Trump\u2019s summit with the Russian President, Vladimir Putin. Herein lies the complication in using this to advance what we know. We can see only bits.\n\nThe \u201cactive measures\u201d portion of the chronology in the indictment\u2014including, by implication, the transmission of files to WikiLeaks\u2014emerges for the first time in an early paragraph, under Count One, the charging of G.R.U. officers for conspiring to commit an offense against the United States: 6. Beginning in or around June 2016, the Conspirators staged and released tens of thousands of the stolen emails and documents. They did so using fictitious online personas, including \u201cDCLeaks\u201d and \u201cGuccifer 2.0.\u201d To make sense of these two sentences, a bit of context is necessary. In 2016, the G.R.U. began a spear-phishing campaign that targeted hundreds of Democratic operatives. People affiliated with Hillary Clinton were targeted as early as March 10th. Podesta, her campaign\u2019s chairman, was targeted nine days later, and his e-mails were stolen on March 21st. The G.R.U. created multiple false online identities to aid its work. By April, it began to set up a mechanism to publish hacked material, a Web site called DCLeaks, purportedly run by American \u201chacktivists.\u201d The site went live on June 8th, after Clinton became the presumptive Democratic nominee, and published tens of thousands of e-mails from at least seven Clinton-campaign staffers, along with other American officials. Seven days later, the G.R.U. created Guccifer 2.0, which never released e-mails in bulk but published on WordPress, in June, screenshots of a Clinton-related e-mail that were so blurry they were unreadable. By then it is also conceivable that the G.R.U. was releasing material to intermediaries: e-mails that were not yet public but were on their way to becoming so. How WikiLeaks enters into this behavior is unclear. But, in the following paragraph, the indictment notes that the G.R.U. relayed an apparently different archive to Assange, explicitly through Guccifer 2.0: 7. The Conspirators also used the Guccifer 2.0 persona to release additional stolen documents through a website maintained by an organization (\u201cOrganization 1\u201d). These two sections, together, suggest two separate acts: one, the staging and releasing of tens of thousands of e-mails starting in June; two, using Guccifer 2.0 to release documents to WikiLeaks. What were those other documents?\n\nIt is worth taking a closer look at what happened in the spring and summer of 2016 to understand how the indictment\u2019s sequence of facts and allegations leaves open some intriguing possibilities. On April 18th, the G.R.U. hacked the D.N.C. computers, and began to extract gigabytes\u2019 worth of files, including opposition research, but it did not penetrate the D.N.C.\u2019s Microsoft Exchange Server, to access its e-mails, until later. The indictment argues that the e-mails were stolen at some point between May 25th and June 1st. What happens next seems significant. By June 1st, the G.R.U. was already in possession of tens of thousands of Clinton-campaign e-mails, including Podesta\u2019s. It had gained access to the D.N.C. e-mails. It had just initiated steps to begin publishing hacked material, on DCLeaks. Then, on June 12th, four days after DCLeaks went live, Assange gave an interview to Britain\u2019s ITV, in which he declared, \u201cWe have upcoming leaks in relation to Hillary Clinton, which is great. WikiLeaks has a very big year ahead.\u201d A bit later in the interview, he added, \u201cWe have e-mails related to Hillary Clinton which are pending publication.\u201d At the time, the G.R.U. hacking operation had not been publicly exposed, and Assange had no reason to suspect that this admission would take on any special significance. What he could not have known was that the D.N.C. was quietly trying to address the G.R.U. hack. It had hired a cyber-security firm, CrowdStrike, to purge the Russian operatives from its computers. To manage the story, it had invited in the Washington Post, which published an article on June 14th disclosing the breach. The Mueller indictment describes in detail Moscow\u2019s response to this news: G.R.U. officers \u201ccreated the online persona Guccifer 2.0,\u201d apparently rushing to mask the hacking operation by promoting the idea that the culprit was a lone Romanian hacker. As they scrambled, they looked up English translations for phrases that could be attributed to their imaginary hacker. Work on the persona, it appears, was finished within hours. The G.R.U. gave Guccifer 2.0 a WordPress Web page, where, on June 15th, it introduced itself and began posting material that it claimed was hacked from the D.N.C. but which, in fact, appears to be drawn from earlier hacks of Clinton officials. Almost immediately, the Web site, in both its tone and content, attracted skepticism. It looked just like what it was: a hastily built Russian construct. It is still unclear if the many tells were left there out of sloppiness, or by design\u2014an artifact of state-sponsored trolling. On June 18th, Guccifer 2.0 released twenty documents on WordPress, which it said were from the D.N.C. but which were almost surely not. Two days later, it teased a \u201cdossier on Hillary Clinton from DNC,\u201d which was nothing of the sort. It implied that it was on a mission to release much more. Then, after establishing itself as a hacker with tons of material, Guccifer 2.0 began giving interviews\u2014most notably on Vice\u2019s Motherboard blog\u2014and on June 22nd it invited people to write to it: \u201cI\u2019d like journalists to send me their questions via Twitter Direct Messages.\u201d That same day, WikiLeaks sent a private message to Guccifer 2.0, presumably over Twitter, saying, \u201cSend any new material here for us to review and it will have a much higher impact than what you are doing.\u201d (Assange later made a nearly identical pitch to Emma Best, a journalist he thought might publish a trove of Guccifer 2.0 material, urging her to route the information to him instead, because the WikiLeaks platform would make it easier to peruse: \u201cImpact is very substantially reduced if the \u2018news\u2019 of a release doesn\u2019t coincide with the ability to respond to the news by searching.\u201d) He told Guccifer 2.0 that he hoped to publish before the Democratic National Convention, and he indicated that he had a specific interest\u2014the \u201cconflict between bernie and hillary.\u201d Throughout late June, the indictment notes, Guccifer 2.0 tried but failed to send an archive of \u201cDNC documents\u201d to WikiLeaks. The reasons for the failures\u2014whether technical, organizational, or personal\u2014are unstated. Co\u00f6rdinating with Assange is not easy. (When I interviewed him last year, he told me, \u201cWe had these hiccups that delayed us, and we were given a little more time.\u201d) Finally, on July 14th, Guccifer 2.0 sent WikiLeaks an encrypted attachment that, according to the indictment, contained \u201cinstructions on how to access an online archive of stolen DNC documents.\u201d Four days later, WikiLeaks confirmed that it had accessed the archive and claimed that it would release the material that week. Then, on July 22nd, Assange began publishing the D.N.C. \u201cemails and other documents,\u201d as the indictment notes, perhaps a reference to attachments. It also says that WikiLeaks \u201cdid not disclose Guccifer 2.0\u2019s role in providing them.\u201d This last statement suggests that WikiLeaks obtained the D.N.C. e-mails from Guccifer 2.0 in the summer, at some point after July 14th\u2014although a legalistic gloss on \u201crole\u201d leaves open the possibility that Guccifer 2.0 provided only some D.N.C. material, such as copies of documents that were also attached to D.N.C. e-mails.\n\nSo did the G.R.U. use the Guccifer 2.0 persona to relay e-mails to WikiLeaks in the summer of 2016? Or did it provide them to Assange by some other means much earlier, in the spring? Let\u2019s look back at the chronology. On June 12th, three days before the creation of Guccifer 2.0, Assange announced that he had a substantial trove of Clinton-related e-mails that were pending publication. Likewise, Guccifer 2.0 proclaimed, on its very first post on the WordPress site, \u201cThe main part of the papers, thousands of files and mails, I gave to Wikileaks. They will publish them soon.\u201d Again and again, the G.R.U. officers tried to drive home this point\u2014which, of course, was evidently the main point of creating the persona. \u201cI sent a big part of docs to WikiLeaks,\u201d Guccifer 2.0 told the editor of the Smoking Gun that same day. On June 17th, Guccifer 2.0 said in another e-mail, \u201cI gave WikiLeaks the greater part of the files.\u201d (For e-mail, the G.R.U. gave Guccifer 2.0 another fake identity: Stephan Orphan.) In other words, both the G.R.U. and Assange appear to have confessed to the transmission and reception of a large trove of Clinton-related e-mails in mid-June, before Guccifer 2.0 was apparently created. The indictment does not address this. There is no way to say precisely what that trove was\u2014if it was the Podesta archive given to WikiLeaks much earlier than is generally presumed, or the D.N.C. e-mails, or both, or something else. (There is also the possibility that both parties were not speaking truthfully.) But, if Assange did have the D.N.C. e-mails before Guccifer 2.0 was created, then the details in the indictment take on new meaning. Some version of the following may be true: it is mid-June, with the convention approaching, and Assange is about to release a bombshell, when he notices the sudden appearance of Guccifer 2.0, a \u201chacker\u201d edging into his turf, inviting journalists to write in. So he writes in, asking for material that interests him. He has already gone through the D.N.C. e-mails and has recognized that the trove highlights conflict within the Democratic Party. He signals that he wants more on that specific issue. The G.R.U. is happy to comply, through its new cutout. Perhaps some of it overlaps with what the G.R.U. already provided, making Guccifer 2.0\u2019s confessions literally accurate. Perhaps it is the same irrelevant dross that Guccifer 2.0 fed to others. Last year, I visited Assange several times in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. He often emphasized to me that the sourcing of his election publications was complex. I usually took this as a dodge. But the sourcing may indeed have been multilayered. There are many conceivable ways that G.R.U. officers could have provided e-mails to WikiLeaks before they created Guccifer 2.0. They could have used the WikiLeaks anonymous-submission system. They could have used a different fictitious online persona. They could have used a human intermediary. Last year, James Clapper told me, \u201cIt was done by a cutout, which of course afforded Assange plausible deniability.\u201d In January, 2017, Clapper oversaw a formal intelligence assessment on Russian meddling. At the time, more than one news organization reported that a classified version of the assessment made clear that the intermediaries between the G.R.U. and WikiLeaks were already known. (Certainly, the intelligence community would also have been in possession of Guccifer 2.0\u2019s Twitter D.M.s at that time, too.) One intelligence official, describing the report, indicated to Reuters last year that the e-mails relayed to WikiLeaks had followed a \u201ccircuitous route,\u201d by a series of handoffs, on their journey from Moscow. Such a scenario seems to be at odds with the idea that Guccifer 2.0 merely sent WikiLeaks an encrypted link to download it all in one swoop. If the hacked e-mails had been provided in this way, to Assange in June, one can imagine a nearly slapstick scenario, in which he was receiving G.R.U. material from two different sources: once at the source\u2019s instigation, and once at his own, receiving one tranche that he published and one that he did not. In our chats in the embassy, Assange sometimes offered hints. One evening, I asked him if he had released all of the election-related records that he had received. He looked up at the ceiling, thought for a long while, then spoke extremely slowly, stopping and starting: \u201cWe published everything that we received about the election that could be verified before the election\u2014everything that was not already published that we could authenticate.\u201d I asked, What percentage did you hold back? \u201cWe received quite a lot of submissions, of material that was already published in the rest of the press, and people seemingly submitted the Guccifer archives. We didn\u2019t publish them. They were already published.\u201d Why not add them to the WikiLeaks library, to insure that they would not be taken down, and also to enrich the exclusive Democratic e-mails that WikiLeaks was putting online\u2014to make the archive more complete? \u201cWe might have done that. But the material from Guccifer 2.0\u2014or on WordPress\u2014we didn\u2019t have the resources to independently verify.\u201d", "description": "Raffi Khatchadourian on the tantalizing new details about WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, and Russia that Robert Mueller\u2019s latest indictment in the 2016-election probe have revealed.", "authors": ["Raffi Khatchadourian", "Sam Knight", "Michael Schulman", "Susan B.
