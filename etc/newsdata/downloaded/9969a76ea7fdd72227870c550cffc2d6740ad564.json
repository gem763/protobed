If you have a cutie or a kitty, you are highly likely to find these furry creatures populating your space worlds now!\n\nRemarkably, this move came along as part of the attempts to boost the player base and to improve the player cross-distribution among blockchain games. The developers mentioned it is possible to see other dApps\u2019 tokens integrated in the future as well, with Axie Infinity being a potential candidate.\n\nApart from that, the team said future updates would include the much-anticipated gas optimization and introduction of buildings into the game. The latter could include factories, decorations as well as some special-type buildings.\n\n0xGames is planning to support the NEO chain in its other projects: 0xWarriors and 0xRacers. The two games, where a grand giveaway marathon has been launched together with CryptoGamingPool, already work on Ethereum, EOSIO and TRON, and right now await new major features to get implemented.\n\nAll dApp enthusiasts are welcome to try 0xUniverse out now or chat and share opinions within the game\u2019s friendly community!", "description": "Crypto game developer 0xGames, creator of blockchain-based space strategy 0xUniverse, has integrated the support for CryptoKitties and Blockchain Cuties", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy85YWVjNWRiZTlhNDkzMjM2YmExNDUzYTI2ZmVjNWNlNS5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
