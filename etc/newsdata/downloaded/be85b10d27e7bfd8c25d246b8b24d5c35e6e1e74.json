He claims that GRG placed him under 'economic duress' which led to some of his assets being seized by RBS in 2010 and sold.\n\nThis week, Morley won the right to call to court Sach and Donald Workman, another senior ex-RBS employee. The alleged misconduct occurred in the wake of the financial crisis, when the banking system was at risk of collapse and the Government owned more than 80 per cent of RBS following a \u00a345.5billion taxpayer bailout.\n\nThe Asset Protection Agency (APA), a now-disbanded Government agency, insured more than \u00a3280billion of RBS's bad loans.\n\nMorley wants to prove the Government pressurised GRG to ruin small businesses so it could take their assets and sell them to boost the bank's profits.\n\nEmails, believed to be from the APA's chief credit officer Brian Scammell, said the bank would be able to extract more money if it squeezed business customers.\n\nMr Justice Kerr, at pre-trial hearing, has allowed Morley to force more documents and emails out of RBS.", "description": "Derek Sach, who ran the Global Restructuring Group, will give evidence in a case starting next week brought by Oliver Morley, 49, a property developer who took out a loan from RBS.", "authors": ["Lucy White For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
