Cory Gardner, who directly pitched one of the top three executives at Amazon the day after the company asked economic development officials in cities with a population of 1 million or more to submit a proposal by Oct. 19 to host its new corporate campus, known as Amazon HQ2.\n\nThe day before Amazon publicized its request for proposals on Sept. 7, the Republican congressman met with Jeffrey Wilke, CEO of Amazon Worldwide Consumer, in his Washington, D.C., office for nearly an hour.\n\n\u201cWe spent a lot of time talking about efforts to boost STEM programs. They talked about how excited they were to be in Colorado, the work they are doing here,\u201d said Gardner.\n\nThe Daily Camera: Boulder Valley officials say they originally didn\u2019t disclose $850,000 fraud case because of legal issues\n\nBoulder Valley School District officials are defending originally not releasing information about last year\u2019s $850,000 fraud case, citing ongoing legal concerns.\n\nThey\u2019re also talking to committees and other groups about the case, providing assurances that the school district has added safeguards to protect from scammers.\n\nA year ago, a scammer posing as a contractor stole about $850,000 of bond construction money. The district has recovered all but $172,000 of that amount.\n\nThe theft came to the district\u2019s attention when contractor Adolfson and Peterson Construction asked for a payment on a past due account, even though the district had been sending payments.\n\nAdolfson and Peterson\u2019s work was part of the district\u2019s $576 million bond issue, approved by voters in 2014.\n\nThe Cannabist: Milestone for Colorado marijuana: $100M in monthly recreational sales\n\nThe trend of summer highs for Colorado\u2019s cannabis industry continued in July as monthly recreational sales surpassed the $100 million mark for the first time since legalization.\n\nThe Cannabist\u2019s calculations of the latest Colorado marijuana tax data show that the state\u2019s cannabis shops sold nearly $137 million in marijuana products \u2014 $101.1 million in adult-use sales and another $35.8 million in medical marijuana sales \u2014 during the month of July.\n\nThe monthly sales tax reports posted by the Colorado Department of Revenue and the subsequent extrapolations by The Cannabist customarily come with their share of caveats: The reported receipts largely reflect sales made in July but could vary because of aspects such as incomplete or late-filed returns.\n\nThe July 2017 sales figures, however, come with some added wrinkles. It\u2019s the first month to reflect a new taxing structure for recreational marijuana.", "description": "The Denver Post: Colorado\u2019s political leaders weigh in on Amazon .09/02/2019 3:22:49AM EST.", "authors": ["Watchdog News", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png"}
