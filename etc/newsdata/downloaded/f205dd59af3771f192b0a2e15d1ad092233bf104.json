(Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP)\n\nFormer vice president Joe Biden made his most direct call for President Trump\u2019s impeachment Wednesday hours after Trump said the Democratic-led inquiry should be terminated \u201cfor the good of the Country,\u201d claiming it was tainted with political bias.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump has indicted himself by obstructing justice, refusing to comply with a congressional inquiry \u2026 he\u2019s already convicted himself,\u201d Biden said during a fiery address in New Hampshire.\n\nThe comments from the Democratic presidential hopeful came a day after the White House said in a scathing eight-page letter that it would not cooperate with the inquiry into the Ukraine scandal on the grounds that it lacked merit.\n\nThe letter was the latest escalation in a standoff with Congress, where Democrats are vowing to hold Trump accountable for pressing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son at a time when U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been suspended.\n\n\u25cf White House escalates standoff with Congress, says it will not cooperate with impeachment inquiry of Trump.\n\n\u25cf Former national security officials fight back as Trump attacks impeachment as\n\n\u201cdeep state\u201d conspiracy.\n\n\u25cf U.S. judge balks at Justice Department bid to deny House access to Mueller grand jury materials.\n\nThe whistleblower complaint | The rough transcript of Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky |The letter from White House counsel to House leaders\n\n2 p.m.: Trump responds to Biden as he speaks in New Hampshire\n\nTrump took to Twitter to respond to Biden on Wednesday as the former vice president called for his impeachment during a campaign appearance in Rochester, N.H.\n\n\u201cSo pathetic to see Sleepy Joe Biden, who with his son, Hunter, and to the detriment of the American Taxpayer, has ripped off at least two countries for millions of dollars, calling for my impeachment - and I did nothing wrong,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cJoe\u2019s Failing Campaign gave him no other choice!\u201d\n\nTrump was referring to business dealings by Hunter Biden in Ukraine and China during Biden\u2019s tenure as vice president.\n\n1:45 p.m. Biden delivers forceful denunciation of Trump\u2019s actions: \u2018He should be impeached\u2019\n\nIn a fiery campaign speech in Rochester, N.H., Biden condemned Trump\u2019s actions and declared that the president should be impeached.\n\nBiden had previously used caveats when discussing whether Trump\u2019s behavior merited impeachment. In his remarks Wednesday, he argued that the president is endangering national security, violating democratic norms and abusing his power to get reelected.\n\n\u201cHe believes he can and will get away with anything he does,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe all laughed when he said he could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot someone and get away with it. It\u2019s no joke. He\u2019s shooting holes in the Constitution, and we cannot let him get away with it.\u201d\n\nBiden seized on Trump\u2019s remarks outside the White House last week, where the president publicly urged China to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter. Trump did so \u201cin the broad light of day,\u201d Biden said.\n\n\u201cIt was the third foreign power that we know of that he\u2019s asked in clear, unmistakable language \u2026 to interfere\u201d in U.S. democratic proceedings, Biden said, adding that Trump has made overtures to Russia and Ukraine as well.\n\nThe speech marked Biden\u2019s most combative on the topic of Trump and foreign election interference.\n\n\u201cWe believe Americans should decide Americans, period,\u201d Biden said. \u201cBut Donald Trump will do anything to get reelected, including violating the most basic forms of democracy. It\u2019s stunning, and it\u2019s dangerous. \u2026 He has seen no limits to his power, regardless what the Constitution says.\u201d\n\nBiden also took aim at Trump for suggesting that the people who provided information to the whistleblower should be executed. \u201cWhat president has ever used such language?\u201d he asked.\n\nAnd he criticized the president for continuing to decline to release his tax returns.\n\n\u201cAnd by the way, even Nixon released his taxes,\u201d Biden said.\n\n12:30 p.m.: Trump understates public support for impeachment\n\nIn an early afternoon tweet, Trump significantly understated the public support for his impeachment found in recent polling.\n\n\u201cOnly 25 percent want the President Impeached, which is pretty low considering the volume of Fake News coverage, but pretty high considering the fact that I did NOTHING wrong,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cIt is all just a continuation of the greatest Scam and Witch Hunt in the history of our Country!\u201d\n\nSupport for impeaching Trump and removing him from office has ranged from 43 percent to 48 percent in independent national polls released this week.\n\nTrump did not point to a particular poll in his tweet, and a White House spokesman did not immediately respond to a question about the source of his information.\n\n12:15 p.m.: Pelosi, House Democrats to hold conference call Friday\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) will hold a conference call with House Democrats on Friday afternoon to deliver an update on the impeachment inquiry, according to two House Democratic aides.\n\nThe call comes days before lawmakers return to Washington from their two-week recess.\n\n\u2014 Mike DeBonis\n\n12 p.m.: Republicans seize on Hillary Clinton interview\n\nRepublicans seized Wednesday on a television interview with Hillary Clinton to bolster their argument that Democrats are seeking to avenge her 2016 loss by targeting Trump for impeachment.\n\nIn the interview, which aired Tuesday on \u201cPBS NewsHour,\u201d Clinton was asked about a Trump tweet this week in which he suggested that \u201ccrooked Hillary Clinton\u201d should enter the 2020 presidential race and referenced the past controversy over her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state.\n\n\u201cSo maybe there does need to be a rematch,\u201d Clinton said, adding: \u201cObviously, I can beat him again.\u201d\n\nIn a tweet Wednesday that included that clip, Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel wrote: \u201cIf there were any doubt that Democrats still refuse to accept they lost in 2016, here is Hillary Clinton herself claiming she beat @realDonaldTrump. She\u2019s completely delusional.\u201d\n\nWhile Clinton received nearly 3 million more popular votes than Trump nationwide, Trump prevailed in the electoral college.\n\n11:20: Trump campaign manager says Democrats \u2018trying to coup\u2019 the president\n\nTrump campaign manager Brad Parscale tweeted Wednesday that Democrats are \u201ctrying to coup\u201d the president.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t the fourth impeachment attempt in American History by Democrats,\u201d Parscale tweeted. \u201cIt is the first COUP attempt in American History by Democrats! You can call what you want, but Democrats are trying to coup the most popular Republican president in history.\u201d\n\n10:40 a.m.: Revealing splits in GOP senators\u2019 reactions to impeachment\n\nIf the House impeaches President Trump, it\u2019s up to the Senate whether to remove him from office. Senators will hold a trial, and it would take 20 Republicans along with all Democrats to reach the constitutionally mandated two-thirds majority, or 67 votes, to remove him.\n\nThat is a long shot, given that Republicans in Congress have largely defended Trump in the face of allegations that he pressured Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son.\n\nStill, some Republican senators want to know more about the whistleblower complaint that started all this. Others have rebuked Trump for soliciting political help from foreign leaders or withheld support for the impeachment inquiry pending more facts.\n\nWe\u2019ve collected reactions from all 53 Republican senators. Read more here about what they have had to say.\n\n\u2014 Adrian Blanco, Amber Phillips, Kate Rabinowitz, JM Rieger and Kevin Schaul\n\n10:15 a.m.: Jordan says Democrats \u2018continue to make the rules up as they go along\u2019\n\nIn an appearance on Fox News, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) criticized Democrats for not holding a vote to open their impeachment inquiry into Trump.\n\n\u201cThey continue to make the rules up as they go along,\u201d said Jordan, who has been one of Trump\u2019s most visible surrogates as the impeachment probe ramps up.\n\nWhile Democrats have not held a vote on opening an inquiry, Jordan said that it appears likely that the House will eventually vote on articles of impeachment.\n\n\u201cIn the end, on articles, it seems like they\u2019re headed down that road,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Jordan tweeted in defense of Trump, arguing that \u201cDemocrats are so busy \u2018striking while the iron is hot\u2019 that they didn\u2019t even have a vote to start their crazy impeachment proceedings!\u201d\n\n9:30 a.m.: Graham says he\u2019s gathering GOP signatures for a letter to Pelosi\n\nSenate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said Wednesday that he is seeking Republican signatures for a letter to Pelosi contending that Trump\u2019s July call with Zelensky does not amount to an impeachable offense.\n\nGraham made his comments during an appearance on Fox News in which he called the House impeachment inquiry \u201ca star-chamber process.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to ask my colleagues in the Senate, Republicans, to sign a letter to Nancy Pelosi saying we do not believe the transcript of the phone call between the president and the Ukraine is an impeachable offense,\u201d Graham said.\n\nIf Trump is impeached by the Democratic-led House, a trial would be held in the Republican-led Senate to determine whether to remove him from office.\n\nGraham also elaborated on his invitation to have Trump personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani testify in front of his Senate panel.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s claiming to have a lot of evidence about corruption in the Ukraine that ties back to the Democrats that\u2019s apart from what the House is looking at,\u201d Graham said. \u201cI think Rudy\u2019s got a story to tell. I want him to tell it in my committee.\u201d\n\n9:05 a.m.: Hoyer says Trump \u2018betrayed our nation,\u2019 urges GOP to support inquiry\n\nHoyer, the No. 2 Democrat in the House, said Wednesday that Trump had \u2018betrayed our nation\u2019 in the Ukraine scandal.\n\nHoyer\u2019s assessment came in a statement in response to the White House announcement Tuesday that it would not cooperate with the inquiry into Trump pressing Zelensky to investigate the Bidens.\n\n\u201cThe letter sent by the White House yesterday is the latest example of this Administration\u2019s efforts to stonewall an investigation into the President\u2019s abuse of power and obstruct justice,\u201d Hoyer said. \u201cThe evidence shows that the President betrayed our nation by encouraging foreign interference in our election, undermining our democracy and national security.\u201d\n\nHoyer also urged House Republicans to work with Democrats on the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cThis is not an issue of party or politics \u2014 it is about our Constitution, the rule of law, and the security of our nation,\u201d Hoyer said. \u201cHouse Democrats will continue to pursue this inquiry with the seriousness and solemnity it deserves.\u201d\n\n8:20 a.m.: Trump calls for end of impeachment inquiry, says whistleblower should be \u2018exposed\u2019\n\nTrump on Wednesday called for ending the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry, claiming that it was tainted by partisanship, amid tweets in which he lashed out in multiple directions.\n\n\u201cFor the good of the Country, this Witch Hunt should end now!\u201d Trump wrote, calling the inquiry a \u201cscam.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Do Nothing Democrats are Con Artists, only looking to hurt the Republican Party and President,\u201d he wrote in another tweet. \u201cTheir total focus is 2020, nothing more, and nothing less. The good news is that WE WILL WIN!!!!\u201d\n\nIn another tweet, Trump took aim at the anonymous U.S. intelligence official whose complaint sparked the impeachment inquiry, writing that the whistleblower \u201cshould be exposed and properly questioned.\u201d\n\nTrump also took fresh aim at House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), writing that he \u201cshould be Impeached for Fraud!\u201d\n\nTrump has taken issue with Schiff\u2019s statement during a hearing in which he embellished Trump\u2019s July call with the leader of Ukraine. Schiff later said that it was meant as a parody and that Trump should have realized that.\n\nIn an earlier tweet Wednesday, Giuliani also sought to paint the impeachment inquiry as \u201cpurely partisan,\u201d saying it should be paid for by the Democratic National Committee.\n\n6:15 a.m.: Eric Trump supports calling impeachment inquiry an \u2018attempted coup\u2019\n\nOne of President\u2019s Trump\u2019s sons, Eric Trump, took to Twitter on Wednesday morning to voice support for Fox News host Sean Hannity, who on Tuesday night told viewers he would no longer refer to the impeachment inquiry by that term because \u201cit is not.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is just the latest attempted coup of a duly elected president,\u201d Hannity said on his prime-time show.\n\n\u201c@seanhannity is absolutely correct \u2014 This is not an impeachment inquiry, it is an \u2018attempted coup,\u2019\u201d Eric Trump tweeted Wednesday morning.\n\n6 a.m.: McConnell says impeachment inquiry has \u2018fallen far short\u2019 on fairness\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), whose chamber would determine whether to remove Trump from office if he is impeached, criticized the House inquiry Tuesday night, saying it has \u201cfallen far short\u201d on fairness.\n\n\u201cOverturning the results of an American election requires the highest level of fairness and due process, as it strikes at the core of our democratic process,\u201d McConnell tweeted. \u201cSo far, the House has fallen far short by failing to follow the same basic procedures that it has followed for every other President in our history.\u201d\n\nLater Tuesday night, Trump retweeted McConnell\u2019s assessment, adding in his own words: \u201cThe Greatest Witch Hunt in the history of the USA!\u201d\n\n5 a.m.: Trump ally on Fox News calls whistleblowers \u2018suicide bombers,\u2019 accuses Democrats of \u2018regicide\u2019\n\nFormer U.S. attorney Joseph E. diGenova turned to European history Tuesday night to describe the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry into President Trump calling their efforts \u201cregicide,\u201d the act of killing a king.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is regicide,\u201d diGenova, a frequent Trump defender, told Fox News host Laura Ingraham. \u201cThis is regicide by another name, fake impeachment. The Democrats in the House want to destroy the president.\u201d\n\nBut diGenova, a conspiracy theorist Trump wanted on his legal team during the Russia probe, wasn\u2019t finished. In a lengthy interview on \u201cThe Ingraham Angle,\u201d the lawyer, who was joined by Giuliani, blasted the two anonymous whistleblowers as \u201csuicide bombers\u201d and accused Democrats of \u201csedition.\u201d\n\nThe fiery rhetoric marks the latest escalation in language used by Trump\u2019s supporters, and even the president himself, to complain about the ongoing impeachment inquiry.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Allyson Chiu", "description": "A day after the White House announced that it would not cooperate with the inquiry into the Ukraine scandal, Democrats vowed to work to hold the president accountable.", "authors": ["John Wagner", "National Reporter Leading The Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "Felicia Sonmez", "National Reporter On The Washington Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/OkoU9KuwCVA-NsIZfgXEk3NQfqw=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FDSDY2XKSQI6THDNINVA35HTDU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
