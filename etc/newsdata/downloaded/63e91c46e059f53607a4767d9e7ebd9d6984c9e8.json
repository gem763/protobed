Gavin Newsom called for the shutdown of the park after it did not heed the California Horse Racing Board's recommendation to suspend racing.\n\nDavid Mcnew/Getty Images\n\nSanta Anita decided to continue racing because it believed that the reforms enacted earlier in the year were working, a spokesman for The Stronach Group, a company that owns the park, told ABC News in June.\n\nThe park announced a series of changes surrounding horse safety in March, including a \"zero tolerance\" policy for the use of almost all medication on racing day. Earlier this year, the California Horse Racing Board further voted to limit whips on racing day as well.
