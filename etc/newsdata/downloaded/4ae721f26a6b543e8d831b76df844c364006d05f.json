It could still happen. The bank\u2019s rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has to plan for all contingencies and it is very definitely one of them.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

On the other hand, there is a high likelihood that consumers, who\u2019ve helped to prop the economy, will take fright, reducing domestic demand, and thus, inflationary pressure.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.\n\nThey\u2019re already showing signs of nerves. The Office for National Statistics recorded a surprising 0.2 per cent fall in retail sales for August, although the three months to August (the better measure) delivered a modest 0.6 per cent rise.\n\nIt\u2019s not just Brexit at work in the numbers. July got a boost from Amazon\u2019s Prime Day, for example. It was over by August, contributing to the weakness in that month.\n\nBut Brexit fears among consumers are still running high and can be seen in other indicators. John Lewis, for example, slumped into the red in the first half of its financial year in part because of shoppers avoiding big-ticket items.\n\nIt seems a no-deal cut from the current 0.75 per cent would be more likely than not, in an attempt to stimulate demand and mitigate the fairly awful consequences.\n\nHow well that would assist an economy in the midst of a shock the likes of which it hasn\u2019t experienced in peacetime remains to be seen.\n\nWhat about a deal and a smooth exit? That may, says the MPC, lead to gradual but limited rises, assuming that the economy picks up and businesses turn on the taps out of relief as much as anything else. Such an outcome looks unlikely right now, but stranger things have happened.\n\nAnd if the impasse continues? With a general election or even another referendum being possible next steps? The MPC issued some additional comments about ongoing uncertainties \u201cin an environment of weaker global growth\u201d and reduced domestic inflationary pressures, which caught the eye.\n\nWatchers of the bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee described those words as \u201cdoveish\u201d. It\u2019s saying, in other words, rates might come down.\n\nAt this point it\u2019s worth noting the annual rate of inflation, which fell sharply to 1.7 per cent in August. That leaves it at its lowest in nearly three years and well below the MPC\u2019s 2 per cent target.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth paying attention to the fact that the MPC is a little out of step with central banks globally. Those in China, India, the US, Europe, at a time when people are fretting about the global economic outlook.\n\nWith Brexit up in the air, the MPC\u2019s failure to follow suit is very understandable. They say a police officer\u2019s lot is not a happy one. That\u2019s no less true of an MPC member in the current situation. Against that backdrop, standing pat makes sense.\n\nBut the odds do seem to be increasingly favouring a cut.
