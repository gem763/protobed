Not sure how to snap a good one? Two words: Portrait mode.\n\nNext, Take a Hard Look at How You Summarize Yourself\n\nYou know the \u201cAbout\u201d section at the top of your profile? That\u2019s actually the most viewed part of your page, which means you want to make sure you update it regularly and that it represents who you are and what you\u2019re looking for. (Pro tip from Decembrele: \u201cKeep it to 40 words or less so it\u2019s more likely to show up in a search.\u201d)\n\nUpdate Your List of Skills\n\nThis is another area that hiring managers look at, so you want to be sure you\u2019re promoting them loud and clear. Not sure how to identify everything you\u2019re good at? You can use LinkedIn\u2019s Skill Assessments tool to verify skills and show that you qualify for job opportunities with specific needs, whether you\u2019re looking to show off your proficiency at Microsoft Excel or the fact that you are a whiz at Javascript.\n\nMake Sure Employers Can Find You\n\nIt\u2019s a common quandary: When you\u2019re employed at one place, how do you put the word out that you\u2019re interested in working somewhere else? Enter Open Candidates, a new feature from LinkedIn that privately signals to recruiters that you\u2019re just that\u2014open to new opportunities. (You toggle it on behind-the-scenes on your personal LinkedIn dashboard, but it\u2019s only visible to recruiters and won\u2019t show up on your public profile.)\n\nAnd That You Know How to Find Them\n\nFinal question: How do you find the influx of October postings? According to Decembrele, you should start by filtering your search on LinkedIn by job function, title, industry and more. You can also use the open search box to add key phrases like \u201cremote\u201d or \u201cwork-from-home\u201d to find opportunities that meet your specific wants and needs. And keep in mind: Hiring managers post the most opportunities on Monday, so you want to be sure to set up Job Alerts so listings are sent to you in real time.\n\nRELATED: 6 Things You Should Never Say During an Interview", "description": "First, Update That Profile PicGet this: LinkedIn profiles with photos receive up to 21 times more profile views, nine more connection requests and up to 36 more messages.
