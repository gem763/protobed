And I am just watching.\"\n\nHe told Sky News: \"It has been a long journey to have her home, with bumps right until the end - and I am grateful to all those at the British Embassy and Iranian MFA who helped smooth all those last blockages.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThe youngster has only been allowed to see mum Nazanin in the notorious Evin Prison when the Iranian authorities would allow.\n\nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was sentenced to five years in jail after being accused of spying, which she vehemently denies.\n\nSince then, husband Richard has been campaigning for the mum to be freed.\n\n(Image: The Free Nazanin campaign)\n\nIn a letter smuggled out of jail recently, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe wrote: \"I have no hope or motivation after my baby goes.\n\n\"There is no measure to my pain.
