People in the ACT are also required to contact Access Canberra, a local government agency, within two hours if they injure a mammal such as a kangaroo.\n\nREAD MORE The UK Labour Party Is Coming In Hot With An Election Promise To Ban All Pet Monkeys\n\nViolent animal activities will attract a fine of up to $48,000 and three years\u2019 jail time, while neglecting your pet \u2013 not providing it adequate food, water, shelter or cleanliness of environment \u2013 will cop you a $4000 fine.\n\nInterestingly, one of the new welfare laws will see owners fined $4000 for confining their dogs for more than a day \u2013 that means keeping a dog cooped up in an enclosed space without access to exercise for over 24 hours.\n\nThe legislation reads:\n\nSection 6F [of the new law] makes it a strict liability offence not to exercise a dog when a dog is confined, unless reasonable exercise is provided or the confinement is necessary for the dog\u2019s welfare.\n\nREAD MORE Bondi Beach Got A Visit From A Huge Antarctic Leopard Seal On Vacay\n\nSo that means that this one won\u2019t apply to dogs kept inside for their own welfare, like if they\u2019re recovering from vet treatment.\n\nOtherwise, though, pet owners are going to have to commit to exercising their dogs, or face the long paw of the law \u2013 exactly as it should be, in my humble opinion.
