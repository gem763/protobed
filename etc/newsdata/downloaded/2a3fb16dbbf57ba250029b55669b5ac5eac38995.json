Warming waters have opened up the Northern Sea Route across the top of the country and made it practical, if not necessarily economic, to search for and exploit oil and gas resources beneath the Arctic seas. Who remembers the Shtokman gas project?\n\nYet the warming that is opening up the Arctic seas may be starting to have a less beneficial effect on the frozen landmass of northern Russia, the heartland of the country\u2019s oil and gas development and production.\n\n\u201cPermafrost is undergoing rapid change,\u201d says the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate report adopted by the IPCC last week. The changes threaten the \u201cstructural stability and functional capacities\u201d of oil industry infrastructure, the authors warn. The greatest risks occur in areas with high ground-ice content and frost-susceptible sediments. Russia\u2019s Yamal Peninsula \u2014 home to two of Russia\u2019s biggest new gas projects (Bovanenkovo and Yamal LNG) and the Novy Port oil development \u2014 fits that bill.\n\nThe problem is bigger than those three projects, though. Some \u201c45% of the oil and natural gas production fields in the Russian Arctic are located in the highest hazard zone,\u201d according to the IPCC report.\n\nThe top few meters of the permafrost, the so-called active layer, freezes and thaws as the seasons change, becoming unstable during warmer months. Developers account for this by making sure their foundations are deep enough to support their infrastructure: including roads, railways, houses, processing plants and pipelines. But climate change is causing that active layer to deepen, which means the ground loses its ability to support the things built upon it. The loss of bearing capacity is dramatic and it\u2019s already well under way, as this chart shows:\n\nFoundations in the permafrost regions can no longer bear the loads they did as recently as the 1980s, according to a 2017 report by the Arctic Council\u2019s Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Program. At Noviy Port the bearing capacity of foundations declined more than 20% between the 1980s and the first decade of this century.\n\nOn the Yamal Peninsula the ground\u2019s bearing capacity is forecast to fall by 25%-50% on average in the 2015-2025 period, when compared with the years 1965-1975. Further south, in an area that includes Urengoy (the world\u2019s second-largest natural gas field) and much of Russia\u2019s older West Siberian gas production, the soil could lose 50-75% of its bearing capacity, according to AMAP.\n\nThat may not be such a big problem for Russia\u2019s newest oil infrastructure, which was designed with climate change in mind. The processing trains and storage tanks at Yamal LNG sit atop 65,000 piles driven up to 28 meters into the permafrost. These are kept cold by a so-called \u201cthermosyphon system\u201d designed to ensure that the soil\u2019s load-bearing capacity is maintained throughout the project\u2019s life.\n\nYet these assumptions depend on the models used to predict the extent of warming and permafrost degradation. What if they\u2019re overtaken by an unexpected climb in temperatures?\n\n\u201cNear-surface permafrost in the High Arctic and other very cold areas has warmed by more than 0.5\u00b0C since 2007\u20132009, and the layer of the ground that thaws in summer has deepened in most areas where permafrost is monitored,\u201d according to the AMAP. Under a high emissions scenario, \u201cthe area of near-surface permafrost is projected to decrease by around 35%.\u201d\n\nWhile the impact of retreating permafrost on Russia\u2019s new Arctic oil and gas developments can be mitigated, it adds to the price of the projects in an already high-cost environment. For older infrastructure the problems are worse. Gas production at the Bovanenkovo field on the Yamal Peninsula is expected to reach 140 billion cubic meters a year \u2014 more than Norway's entire production \u2014 but it \u201chas seen a recent increase in landslides related to thawing permafrost,\u201d says the AMAP.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- President Vladimir Putin needs to go green quickly to stop the permafrost from melting, so that Russian oil and gas companies can keep pumping the hydrocarbons that are\u00a0warming the planet and making the permafrost melt.Even I\u2019m struggling with the warped logic of that one, but", "authors": ["Julian Lee"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/TkezcNXHPqc19GnvdMpr4A--~B/aD03ODI7dz0xMjk2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/9984f0710e23f6b922605cce0dd9b01f", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
