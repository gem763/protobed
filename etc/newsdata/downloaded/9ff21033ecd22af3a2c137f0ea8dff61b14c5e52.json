That match was so up and down from both of us. I only played Magda last week and she killed me so I knew I really had to step it up.'", "description": "Heather Watson saved four match points before beating Magda Linette in a gruelling contest to continue her excellent run to the semi-finals at the Tianjin Open.", "authors": ["Press Association Sport Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/12/19585256-0-image-a-27_1570794245705.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
