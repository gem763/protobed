They also rushed to stores to buy flashlights, ice chests and batteries.\n\nSan Francisco is the only county in the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area where power will not be affected.\n\nSome of California\u2019s most destructive blazes in recent years were started by PG&E power lines. This year, the company agreed to pay billions of dollars to a group of insurance companies representing claimants from deadly northern California wildfires in 2017 and 2018.\n\nBut the potential outages will not be limited to fire-prone areas because the utilities must turn off entire distribution and transmission lines to much wider areas to minimize the risk of wildfires.\n\nThe California department of forestry and fire prevention said it had increased staffing in preparation for extreme fire weather and what was expected to be the strongest wind event so far this fire season.\n\n\u201cWith some of the most destructive and deadliest fires occurring October through December, we need Californians to not be complacent,\u201d said the Cal Fire chief, Thom Porter, in a news release. \u201cResidents need to be ready to evacuate at a moment\u2019s notice in the event of a wildfire.\u201d", "description": "Pacific Gas & Electric plans to cut power to 34 northern and central counties in state\u2019s biggest-ever preventive outage", "authors": ["Guardian Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd9a07e9b0d3ae14457db26da21959355a5dc7af/24_0_3567_2140/master/3567.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=11a9dd824556b98bb6569ac42f635d88", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
