Now, he can skip the tubes and needles and grab some Pedialyte.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nThe Cleveland Browns star wide receiver has been known for a lot of things over the years, from amazing catches and Pro Bowl caliber production to some antics that certainly have raised an eyebrow or two. But at the end of the day, Beckham is an entertainer and one of the best pitchmen in the NFL. That his latest endorsement meets a need in his personal life should be no surprise.\n\nPedialyte is typically known as a supplement recommended by pediatricians for newborns and babies to combat issues related to hydration, but it can also be used by adults, something that few consumers know. Pedialyte is hopeful that its recent sponsorship with Beckham, announced on Friday morning, can significantly raise their profile as a viable option for active adults and athletes when it comes to hydration.\n\nThe sponsorship with Abbott, the maker of Pedialyte, is timely for Beckham ahead of the Browns season opener this weekend. Traded to the Browns this offseason from the New York Giants, he stated last year that he needed to get multiple IVs during the season to combat his distaste for water.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying. I really just don\u2019t like it,\u201d Beckham said last fall. \u201cYou get that stomach feeling \u2014 it\u2019s all slushy. I\u2019m trying to stay hydrated. Sometimes I got to get an IV. It\u2019s just necessary. If you\u2019re cramping in both calves, it\u2019s hard to run and make cuts.\u201d\n\nIn a press release from Abbott, Beckham said that his mother suggested he drink Pedialyte to hydrate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NFL, through a spokesman, said that athletes are free to drink beverages other than official league sponsor brands on the sideline. So theoretically, Beckham could use Pedialyte during games to combat the cramping that plagued him last season.\n\nThe move is a smart one from Pedialyte as it connects their brand, often relegated to the baby aisle of the drugstore and places them square in the hydration field. The adult sports energy drink market is dominated by the likes of Gatorade and Powerade, but Pedialyte is hopeful to make their own push.\n\nUsing an NFL star seems to be a way for Abbott to open Pedialyte to consumers outside of the baby market.\n\n\"With twice the electrolytes and half the sugar of sports drinks, Pedialyte is used by the toughest athletes, coaches and trainers for advanced rehydration needs. That\u2019s why Abbott is teaming up Odell Beckham Jr. \u2014 it\u2019s a natural extension for us \u2014 he\u2019s one of our biggest fans,\" said Chris Calamari, vice president and general manager of Pediatric Nutrition for Abbott.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nBeckham, who will work as a brand ambassador for Pedialyte, will also act as a creative director for the brand by contributing to marketing content and product development.
