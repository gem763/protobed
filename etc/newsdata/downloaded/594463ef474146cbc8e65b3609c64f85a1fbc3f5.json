Today, Dowd decided to dismissively attack Megyn Kelly and wound up getting hammered by her and then ratioed, more than once. It started with a tweet that he has since deleted. Here\u2019s a screenshot:\n\nPutting Lauer, who has been accused of rape, in the same basket with Kelly seems pretty dumb. Kelly pointed out she has been one of the people speaking for women who have been victimized by guys like Lauer.\n\nYes, I could just sit back and \u201cenjoy my money,\u201d @matthewjdowd, but instead I\u2019ve chosen to speak up for women being harassed and abused who have been muzzled by NDAs. Sorry you find that so annoying. https://t.co/Fy86s5QTsF \u2014 Megyn Kelly (@megynkelly) October 19, 2019\n\nDowd decided he could self-rescue with another tweet:\n\nMegyn, i am all for that, and if you read my feed you would know that. However, did you stand up for Christine Blasey Ford, Anita Hill, and all the accusers of President Trump? Also, i know you are blasting NBC, but i don\u2019t see you saying much about Fox. \u2014 Matthew Dowd (@matthewjdowd) October 19, 2019\n\nThere are a few problems with this tweet. For starters, Kelly would have been in college during the Anita Hill hearings. Asking if she stood up for Anita makes about as much sense as asking Dowd if he stood up for Mary Jo Kopechne.\n\nAs for Christine Blasey Ford, her own best friend didn\u2019t stand up for her, despite pressure to do so. Maybe that fact should matter just a bit to an ABC political analyst?\n\nAlso, Dowd seems to have completely missed that Kelly attacked Trump\u2019s behavior toward women more directly than most reporters in 2016. A lot of people on the right still hate Kelly for the question she asked Trump at one of the GOP debates. That question later prompted Trump to say Kelly had \u201cblood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her\u2026wherever.\u201d In fact, Dowd\u2019s own network put together a highlight reel of the feud between Trump and Kelly back in October 2016 (see below). I guess Dowd missed it.\n\nKelly continued to criticize Trump in 2017 for offering an opinion about Al Franken. Suffice it to say that Kelly has criticized Trump\u2019s behavior toward women a lot. And yet, that\u2019s still not the dumbest thing in Dowd\u2019s tweet. The dumbest thing is his claim that Kelly has blasted NBC but \u201cI don\u2019t see you saying much about Fox.\u201d Here\u2019s Kelly\u2019s response:\n\n.@matthewjdowd \u2013 umm, there is a whole movie about me standing up for the women at Fox. & I put Trump accusers on the air. Also my job as a reporter was not to \u201cstand up\u201d for Blasey-Ford. It was to report fairly on her w/o taking a side. You should try it sometime. https://t.co/lLnOCSrm0I \u2014 Megyn Kelly (@megynkelly) October 19, 2019\n\nKelly is referring to the new film Bombshell in which she\u2019s played by Charlize Theron. Since we know Dowd doesn\u2019t pay attention to his own network, maybe he read the NY Times, which published this back in 2016 about Kelly\u2019s role in taking down Ailes:\n\nIt is no secret that Megyn Kelly played a role in Roger Ailes\u2019s ouster as the chief executive of Fox News after she, and others, accused him of sexual harassment. But in her new book, \u201cSettle For More,\u201d which will be released on Tuesday, Ms. Kelly, the Fox News anchor, suggests that by making her allegations known to 21st Century Fox \u2014 in a phone call to Lachlan Murdoch, the executive chairman \u2014 she may have ensured that the investigation into Mr. Ailes\u2019s behavior was a genuine one that he was not able to impede.\n\nAgain, you don\u2019t have to like Kelly to recognize that claiming she hasn\u2019t said much about sexual harassment at Fox is just stupid. She literally wrote a book about it. After getting ratioed by people pointing out how wrong he is, Dowd finally decided to tap out with this tweet:\n\nMegyn, i wish you well. I would put my objectivity up against yours any day of the week. You worked at Fox News. \u2014 Matthew Dowd (@matthewjdowd) October 19, 2019\n\nDowd should really look up the word objectivity in the dictionary because I\u2019m not sure he knows what it means. To be objective is to lack a bias in your reporting. We\u2019ve just seen a display of Dowd\u2019s bias in action. For him, the fact that Kelly worked for Fox is literally the last word, the only thing that matters on this or any other topic. He doesn\u2019t seem to be aware of any facts that contradict his preconceived view even though many other news outlets (including his own) have reported on Kelly\u2019s battles with Trump, Ailes, etc. In short, he\u2019s a hack and, based on this exchange, not a particularly bright one.\n\nHere\u2019s ABC News recounting of the Trump-Kelly feud from 2016:", "description": "\"umm, there is a whole movie about me standing up for the women at Fox...\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Matthew-Dowd-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
