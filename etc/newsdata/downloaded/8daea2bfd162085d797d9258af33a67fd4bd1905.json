REUTERS/Benoit Tessier\n\nDior, part of luxury group LVMH, is one of the first major French brands to kick off Paris Fashion Week, with the likes of Kering\u2019s Saint Laurent and independent Chanel also set to showcase looks for next spring and summer.\n\nHot on the heels of runway shows in New York, London and Milan, where some labels as well as organizers sought to address consumer concerns over the industry\u2019s green credentials, Paris is also looking to improve its environmental record.\n\nDesigner Maria Grazia Chiuri\u2019s latest outing for Dior echoed that message, in the collection and on the set of an \u201cinclusive garden\u201d.\n\nIn a makeshift structure within the grounds of a horse-racing course, models in pale gowns sashayed over soil between more than a hundred trees still standing in pods of earth, and destined for various urban development projects around Paris.\n\n\u201cThe garden is not only an idea of decorative things but also something that could help (us) to have a future. We tried to translate this important element in the show,\u201d Chiuri told Reuters in an interview. French landscape design collective Coloco worked with Dior on the installation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a designer. I\u2019m not a bit expert in this argument. The first thing is to collaborate with someone that knows,\u201d Chiuri added.\n\nInspired in part by Catherine Dior - the sister of late founder Christian Dior and an expert gardener, as well as the inspiration for the brand\u2019s hit Miss Dior perfume - styles were also rooted in the botanical world.\n\nBut rather than the delicate roses Dior was known for in the 1940s in 1950s, dresses and suits were adorned with creeping vines, thistles and thorns.\n\nSome looks, like shaggy rain coats, had a camouflage edge, while models also wore frocks evoking cropped overalls and straw gardening hats.\n\nMasculine silhouettes with oversized jackets followed a strapless, rustling raffia dress.\n\nChiuri also incorporated splashes of color with tie-dye skirts, a rainbow dress and deep blue shirts.\n\nEarlier in September, British label Burberry said its London fashion show was certified as carbon neutral, as did Kering\u2019s Gucci label in Milan.\n\nClimate activists staged a protest in London during the runway presentations, with some gluing themselves to the entrance of one fashion venue.\n\nThe French federation that organises Paris Fashion Week said that by 2020 it aimed for the event to be free of single-use plastics, such as water bottles, as part of other measures like encouraging people to use shuttle services to reduce emissions.\n\n\u201cThe good point of fashion is its mediatic impact\u201d, Nicolas Bonnenfant, co-founder of the Coloco group that helped with the tree installation.\n\nThe Dior show was attended by actresses Jennifer Lawrence and Julianne Moore.", "description": "Christian Dior presented a wardrobe fit for glamorous eco-warriors in Paris on Tuesday, as models showed off looks dotted in wild flowers on a catwalk lined with trees set to be replanted around the city.", "authors": ["Sarah White", "Laetitia", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433436091&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N1RJ-OCAEN", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
