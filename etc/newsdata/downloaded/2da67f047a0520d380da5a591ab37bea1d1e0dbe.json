Subscribe here to get the G-File delivered to your inbox on Fridays.\n\nDear Reader (Including the people who need people),\n\nOkay, bear with me. I think I\u2019m going to write this whole thing as a single run-on sentence and then just add the punctuation later. I\u2019ll just grab a fistful of commas, periods, and semicolons and blow them over the page like so much pixie dust or the last grains of coke on the album sleeve of Quadrophenia before Hunter Thompson started his workday. The gang at NRHQ can worry about putting them in the right place later.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs long-time readers know, from time to time I vent my spleen on the misuse of the phrase \u201cbegs the question.\u201d Every day, someone on TV or radio gets it wrong. And it vexes me. I find it more distracting than when that guy who sat next to me when I took the SAT would absentmindedly tap his No. 2 pencil on his glass eye as he tried to work through the analogy section. I think it\u2019s more annoying than the fact that Debbie Wasserman Schultz can\u2019t rinse the conditioner out of her hair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo for the umpteenth time, \u201cbegging the question\u201d involves assuming a premise \u2014 usually the premise in dispute \u2014 is true. It does not mean to raise a question. Question Begging:\n\nLove is all you need, because love is everything.\n\nEveryone\u2019s eating Tide pods, because eating Tide pods is the hot new craze.\n\nBaal is all-powerful, because I sacrificed 50 goats to him asking for a snow day and then it snowed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, this discursion raises the question of why I\u2019m talking about begging the question.\n\nThe other night, my AEI colleague Ryan Streeter, who worked in the Bush administration, told me a story about his final interview for his highfalutin job in the domestic-policy shop. Harriet Miers asked him a series of blunt questions: \u201cHave you ever hit your wife?\u201d \u201cHave you ever hit your kids?\u201d \u201cHave you ever been arrested?\u201d \u201cHave you or anyone in your family done anything that might later come back to embarrass the administration?\u201d Etc.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is normal in a lot of administrations. I heard that one of the reasons Sidney Blumenthal couldn\u2019t land a real job in the Obama administration, despite Hillary Clinton\u2019s importuning, was because he was asked, \u201cHave you ever sworn fealty to Mephistopheles, Agrat bat Mahlat, Furfur the Great Earl of Hell, or any demonic or eldritch deity?\u201d and he couldn\u2019t answer honestly, so he had to return to the stygian sewers and work off-book for Hillary.\n\nBut, obviously, that\u2019s just got to be another Beltway rumor since, as everyone knows, Sidney Blumenthal wouldn\u2019t have problem lying to get what he wants.\n\nWife Beating: Theory & Practice\n\nAnyway, I bring this up because among the greatest examples of question-begging in everyday use is the phrase \u201cWhen did you stop beating your wife?\u201d\n\nThis sort of rhetorical trick is a mainstay of political debates. They come up in every contentious confirmation hearing. They also show up in any number of policy debates. For instance, gun-control advocates assume that if Republicans oppose \u201cgun free\u201d workplace rules, it\u2019s because they think gunplay at work is okay \u2014 and not because such laws don\u2019t work on people keen on shooting up their office. It\u2019s axiomatic: If someone won\u2019t heed laws against murder, they probably won\u2019t be deterred by a sign that says they could be fined if you bring your Smith & Wesson to work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo why did I bring this up? Oh right, because I think we are in a remarkable moment. Many supporters of the Trump administration argue that one of its great benefits is that it eschews the abstractions of the ideologues in favor of concrete practicalities. \u201cSpare me your lofty arguments about free trade, Ye Sophisters and Calculators!\u201d \u201cYou can keep your \u2018principles\u2019; we\u2019re getting things done!\u201d And to be fair, there are times when this is a good argument \u2014 and a better one than I would have foreseen.\n\nBut if we\u2019re going to talk about leaving the realm of Platonic ideals and talk about the need for concrete practicalities, I think we should at least take a moment and acknowledge that, for the first time in living memory, the phrase \u201cWhen did you stop beating your wife?\u201d has been plucked from the ether of rhetorical abstraction and rendered an utterly pragmatic query. For that is just one of the many questions John Kelly or Don McGahn should have asked Robert Porter.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAnd they probably did! They just took Porter\u2019s denials at face value and didn\u2019t bother to credit the accusers, the FBI background checks, or common sense. I mean, the thing about the \u201cWhen did you stop beating your wife (or wives)?\u201d question is that the person being asked will deny it \u2014 even if he actually beats his wives.\n\nI have no doubt that Porter was good at his job. One hears reports about how he was a stabilizing presence in the White House and a reliable ally of the Gang of Grown-Ups in the West Wing. But it tells you something about the bunker mentality inside the White House that these allegations were simply too bad to check.\n\nIt\u2019s an Eminence Front\n\nA few paragraphs ago, around the time I referenced how one of the great defenses of the Trump administration is its practicality and rejection of abstract theory and ideology, I lit a cigar (Sobremesa Imperiales, if you must know). But that\u2019s not important right now. As anyone who\u2019s read me over the years knows, I am a passionate defender of ideology (my last book was an extended apologia for ideology and my next one is even more so). Part of my defense of ideology is that much of it isn\u2019t abstract theory (though some is).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSaying \u201csomething is an abstraction\u201d isn\u2019t the same thing as calling it a fiction. Pure mathematics is an abstraction, but it ain\u2019t fiction. Applied mathematics takes principles found in pure mathematics and applies them to real-world stuff, such as engineering. A perfect triangle exists only in the abstract. But what we learn from the Platonic ideal of the triangle has all sorts of real-world applications \u2014 and vice versa. My hunch is that humans figured out how to make fulcrums long before anyone dabbled in geometry.\n\nOne of the things I love about conservatism and classical liberalism is that they pan the river of time for the gold of principles amidst the soil of lived existence. These principles don\u2019t always sparkle. Sometimes they are invisible to us, encased in mundane traditions and habits that we take as simple rules. Different thinkers (Burke, Chesterton, Hayek, Polyani, et al.) have different terms for different kinds of knowledge that cannot be simply conveyed with words, such as \u201ctacit,\u201d \u201chidden,\u201d or \u201cembedded\u201d knowledge. \u201cWashington, D.C., is the capital of the United States\u201d is explicit knowledge. How to throw a curveball involves a lot of tacit knowledge; all the variables that go into the price of a loaf of bed is embedded knowledge; all of the arguments that go into why good manners are valuable is hidden knowledge. The point isn\u2019t that we can\u2019t know some of the factors \u2014 the way to hold the ball, the cost of wheat, how to defuse social conflict \u2014 that go into these things, it\u2019s just that we can\u2019t know all of them.\n\nOne of the things I love about conservatism and classical liberalism is that they pan the river of time for the gold of principles amidst the soil of lived existence.\n\nAs I write at length in Suicide of the West, it took hundreds of thousands of years of trial and error to come up with the ideas bound up in liberal democratic capitalism and modernity. We have no conception of all the trial and error that went into food preparation, monogamy, democracy, written languages, or human rights. We inherited those hard-earned lessons of the past. To be sure, there was a feedback loop with higher, more abstract, thinking. God is an abstraction, and so are concepts such as natural rights and the innate worth of the individual. But we refined both the abstractions and the practicality against each other like a blade and whetting stone. We justify practicalities by appealing to abstractions and vice versa all the time (and sometimes this involves a lot of question-begging, which can raise all sorts of uncomfortable questions).\n\nAnd what did we do? We bound a bunch of these principles and lessons and made them into an ideology. For our political ideology, we didn\u2019t include the stuff about food preparation (though if you look closely enough you can find some overlap, hence the political campaign-mounting to make Tide pods look less delicious) but in the realms of law, economics, governance, etc., the supposedly abstract ideology that underlies Western civilization \u2014 on most of the left and most of the right and everywhere in between \u2014 is the greatest achievement of practicality in all of human history.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you don\u2019t like the word \u201cideology,\u201d fine. Call it a \u201cworldview\u201d or, if you want to get fancy, Weltanschauung, which just means the same thing in German. \u201cI know conservatives who say yes to Weltanschauung and no to ideology,\u201d Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn once observed, \u201cbut they seem incapable of distinguishing between them (not surprisingly, because there is no distinction).\u201d\n\nThe benefit of ideology is that it provides time-tested rules to rely upon during the inevitable chaos of everyday life. It operates in much the same way morality does. Morality gives you rules of thumb that prevents you from making bad decisions. Children ask, \u201cWhy can\u2019t I steal that pack of gum or cheat on my test if I can get away with it?\u201d When we answer, we leave abstract concepts of good and evil or right and wrong out of it. We tell them that, if you do what\u2019s right, it won\u2019t matter whether you may or may not get caught.\n\nIn politics, the worry is very often not that the government will knowingly do wrong but that it will take the shortest path to doing what it thinks is right. This is what Michael Oakeshott called \u201cpolitics as the crow flies.\u201d Conservative ideology, rightly understood, is the political conscience that counsels against such expedience. \u201cWhat is conservatism,\u201d Lincoln asked, \u201cif not adherence on the old and tried against the new and untried?\u201d\n\nDebt Soapbox, R.I.P.\n\nI didn\u2019t plan on taking the above detour, but I did so for a few reasons. First, when you set out to simply pound out a run-on-sentence \u201cnews\u201dletter like the climax of Goodfellas, you never know where the keyboard will take you, particularly when you add sweet, sweet nicotine. Another reason is that I planned on writing an extended screed about the budget, and I hate writing about the budget. I guess my id was trying to steer me away from something I didn\u2019t want to do. But, like going to the dentist or adorning your mantle with Wolfsbane and garlic to keep Sidney Blumenthal away, disliking something has no bearing on whether it\u2019s important or necessary. So, as the Hooters hostess said to Bill Clinton, let\u2019s get this over with as quickly as possible.\n\nI have been very hard on Rand Paul over the last year or so, but in this instance, he was on the side of the angels. For the last decade, at least, conservatives have insisted that they were ideologically opposed to precisely the sort of turd burger we saw getting sizzled on the congressional grill this week. Regardless of Paul\u2019s political calculations, his arguments were entirely right. If you passionately insisted that runaway deficit spending was an abomination under Barack Obama, there really is no way you can defend the same thing under Donald Trump. I argued for years that the tea parties were in no small way a delayed backlash against the profligate spending of George W. Bush as much as they were a backlash against Barack Obama. The psychological reasoning boiled down to: \u201cWe felt we had to put up with the crap under Bush because of the war or because he was our guy, but we\u2019ll be damned if we\u2019re gonna put up with it from this guy too.\u201d\n\nThe Left saw nothing but hypocrisy and, often, racism. I always thought the hypocrisy charge had some merit. Bush\u2019s big government \u201ccompassionate\u201d conservatism, as I wrote many times, wasn\u2019t a conservative alternative to Clintonism, it was a Republican version of it. As for claims of racism, I always thought those were wildly overblown by a ridiculously raced-obsessed and partisan media. That\u2019s not to say there was zero truth to it anywhere, just that it was wildly exaggerated by the paranoid style of the American Left.\n\nNot only does this budget blow up any pretense of ideological consistency, there isn\u2019t even a coherent economic theory behind it.\n\nBut none of that matters now, because the Tea Party is done. MAGA nationalism has siphoned off most of it, and what remains is a scattered and spent force. I understand that Paul Ryan and others insist that we\u2019ll move on to entitlement reform. And Ryan may give it the old college try. But it won\u2019t work. For reasons laid out in our National Review editorial and by Yuval Levin, no serious entitlement reform can get through the Senate now, because Republicans gave away reconciliation until after the midterms. More broadly, the president doesn\u2019t like entitlement reform, as he has made clear many times. His State of the Union address didn\u2019t contain a word about it \u2014 but it did float a new paid-family-leave entitlement. The only mention of the word \u201cdeficit\u201d was in the phrase \u201cinfrastructure deficit\u201d \u2014 a term the GOP would have mocked relentlessly if it passed the lips of Barack Obama.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot only does this budget blow up any pretense of ideological consistency, there isn\u2019t even a coherent economic theory behind it. Borrowing and spending more when the economy is doing well violates not only Keynesianism but traditional conservatism. I understand the military needs more funding. I understand politics is the art of the possible, yada yada yada.\n\nBut none of that changes the fact that Republicans have taken a sledgehammer to their last soapbox. We\u2019re not even all Keynesians now \u2014 we\u2019re just crows flitting from one place to another.\n\nVarious & Sundry\n\nOne of the weird things about my line of work is all the blood magic that\u2019s required. You\u2019d think there would be more word magic. Another thing that\u2019s weird is that sometimes you dash off something that you think is no great shakes, and it\u2019s a hit. Other times, you come up with some weird idea that you really like, and it falls flat. You do this long enough, and you tend not to worry about that sort of thing too much. The only test is whether you like it and can stand by it. Two cases in point: Earlier this week, I pounded out in a few minutes a \u201creview\u201d of The Cloverfield Paradox, and people loved it. Kyle Smith, one of the most talented cultural critics in Christendom, called it the best movie review of 2018. I had to go back and make sure they didn\u2019t put my byline on something by Ross Douthat. Meanwhile, my column today, which manages to use an extended analogy based on Father Guido Sarducci\u2019s stand-up routine to critique the Vatican and the Chinese, basically landed without a ripple. Maybe I was overly pleased with cleverness under a very tight deadline, but I liked it.\n\nThe latest Remnant podcast is out, and the reception has lined up much more with my expectations, because I thought it was a hoot and a half (using the old imperial measurements). John Podhoretz came by and we nerded out on neoconservatism and the state of the conservative movement until \u2014 suddenly! \u2014 Gene Shalit sauntered by and reviewed The Poseidon Adventure. Then Vic Matus took his place, and we talked \u201970s disaster movies, sitcoms, and the depiction of male-on-female cinematic assault among other things. Good times.\n\nCanine Update: Everything remains joyous in doggie-land, even in the rain. They still hate crows though. And they\u2019re still working with their buddies from the pack on their album cover and band names (possible solo cover here). The Dingo remains terribly needy and jealous of the Spaniel. I\u2019ve noticed that even if they\u2019re in different rooms, if I start giving Pippa scritches and pats, Zo\u00eb will show up and demand her piece of the action. I tested it this morning. Yesterday, after Pippa lost her tennis ball, we switched to sticks, and she was still so happy she showed off one of best butt-waggles ever. One piece of feedback I often get is that it looks like Zo\u00eb doesn\u2019t get much exercise when we go on our adventures. This is not true. It\u2019s just that much of her best cardio is hard to predict because it depends on her seeing deer, rabbits, or other wildlife and then taking off like Tesla from an airlock. It\u2019s hard to have my iPhone ready in such instances. Still, sometimes she\u2019ll play \u201cChase the Dingo\u201d with me. Actually, she\u2019ll always play that. It\u2019s me who sometimes doesn\u2019t feel up to it.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the other stuff:\n\nLast week\u2019s G-File\n\nShould Trump invoke treason, even jokingly?\n\nJames Comey didn\u2019t defeat Hillary Clinton.\n\nWhy the cult of Trump has taken hold.\n\nThe Cloverfield Paradox is bad.\n\nGeneral Jack Keane is not a fan of the military parade.\n\nMy Special Report appearance\n\nPodcast worlds collide in the latest Remnant.\n\nThe Vatican yields to China.\n\nAnd now, the weird stuff.\n\nRemembering Bailey\n\nDebby\u2019s Friday links\n\nThe first radio jingle\n\nHow UFO reports change with the technology of the times\n\nCutest baby animals\n\nWhat British children in the \u201960s thought the future would be like\n\nThings Philadelphians did\n\nAttack of the crayfish clones\n\nOctopus hides in coconut\n\nThe family pet . . . crocodile?\n\nSpiders used to have tails\n\nThe sorrow and glory of Olympians\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe gastronomic borders of the United States\n\nA corgi rides off into the night\n\nThe tractor-driving dog", "description": "Ideology provides time-tested rules to rely upon during the inevitable chaos of everyday life.", "authors": ["Jonah Goldberg", "Andrew C.
