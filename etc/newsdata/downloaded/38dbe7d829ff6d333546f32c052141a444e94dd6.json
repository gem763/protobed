She was the mother of two young children.\n\nCox\u2019s husband Brendan said he was shocked by the inflammatory language on display and both sides should ponder the impact of the words they used.\n\nWhen asked how his late wife might have responded, Cox said: \u201cShe would have tried to take a generosity of spirit to it and thought about how in this moment you can step back from this growing inferno of rhetoric.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo descend into this bear pit of polarization is dangerous for our country,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cIt creates an atmosphere where violence and attacks are more likely.\u201d\n\nBrexit has illustrated a United Kingdom divided about much more than the European Union, and has fuelled soul-searching about everything from secession and immigration to capitalism, empire and Britishness itself.\n\nThe rage and ferocity of the Brexit debate has shocked allies of a country that has prided itself as a confident - and mostly tolerant - pillar of Western economic and political stability.\n\nCox was clear that the language across the Brexit schism was troubling and that the United Kingdom needed to come together rather than tear itself apart.\n\nSome on both sides of the debate are now using the politics of contrived outrage to argue their point. Johnson says parliament is betraying the will of the people over Brexit, while opponents cast him a dictator who has ridden roughshod over democracy to take the United Kingdom to the brink of ruin.\n\nParliamentary speaker John Bercow told lawmakers to stop treating each other as enemies, saying the atmosphere in the House of Commons was the worst he had known since he was elected 22 years ago.\n\n\u201cThe culture was toxic,\u201d Bercow said in parliament.\n\nBREXIT SCHISM\n\nJohnson returned to the chamber on Wednesday after the Supreme Court ruled that his decision to suspend parliament earlier this month was unlawful.\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson gestures as he speaks at the parliament, which reconvenes after the UK Supreme Court ruled that his suspension of the parliament was unlawful, in London, Britain, September 25, 2019, in this screen grab taken from video.

His opponents roared \u201cresign\u201d and some cast him as a cheating dictator who should stand aside after the court ruling.\n\nJohnson provoked anger by repeatedly calling a law that forces him to ask the EU for a Brexit delay unless he can strike a deal as \u201cthe Surrender Bill\u201d. Speaking to Conservative lawmakers on Thursday, he defended his use of the term and received support from the party.\n\nJohnson told the 1922 Committee: \u201cIt IS a surrender act,\u201d arguing that it hurt Britain\u2019s negotiating stance with the EU. The prime minister added that he took threats to lawmakers very seriously.\n\nBut some were still furious over his response on Wednesday to a question about Jo Cox.\n\nLabour\u2019s Paula Sherriff told the House she had received death threats, some of which echoed the prime minister\u2019s own rhetoric. Johnson replied: \u201cI have never heard so much humbug in my life\u201d, sparking uproar.\n\nIt was not just politicians who were angry. Johnson\u2019s own sister Rachel described her brother\u2019s words as a \u201cparticularly tasteless\u201d way to refer to the memory of a murdered lawmaker.\n\n\u201cWords like collaborationist, traitor, betrayal, my brother using words like surrender, capitulation, as if the people who are standing in the way of the blessed will of the people as defined by 17.4 million votes in 2016 should be hung, drawn, quartered, tarred and feathered,\u201d she told Sky News.\n\n\u201cI think that it highly reprehensible language to use.\u201d\n\nBrendan Cox husband of MP Jo Cox speaks outside Old Bailey courthouse after the conviction and sentencing of Thomas Mair for his wife's murder, in London, Britain November 23, 2016.
