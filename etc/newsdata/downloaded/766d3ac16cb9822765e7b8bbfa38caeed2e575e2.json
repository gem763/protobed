China thus remained the second largest FDI host globally. The US is still the largest recipient of FDI with $143 billion in inflows.\n\nThe UNCTAD said that prospects for the full year's FDI flows remain in line with earlier projections of a 5-10 percent increase. The rebound of flows in developed economies is likely to hold. Developing countries are expected to remain stable, with growth centering on Southeast Asia.\n\nHowever, weaker global economic activities and ongoing trade tensions form the greatest risk to FDI growth, warned the UNCTAD.", "description": "Despite ongoing trade tensions, flows of foreign direct investment (FDI) to China increased by four percent in the first half of 2019, a report published by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has found.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/29/5db83181a310cf3e97a371d7.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
