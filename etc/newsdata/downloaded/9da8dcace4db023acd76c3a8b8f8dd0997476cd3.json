They're also about encouraging folks to support wildlife conservation at home and on their travels by shopping responsibly and avoiding products whose production harms animal habitats, restricting water use and becoming a \"wildlife influencer\" who cares for the environment.\n\nThe results of the contest, organized in partnership with international wildlife charity Born Free Foundation, are due to be announced on November 13, with the winner getting a one-week safari in Kenya's Masai Mara.", "description": "Lion cubs pouncing on sensitive parts of bigger cats.
