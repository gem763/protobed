The seismometer records the waves traveling through the interior structure of a planet. Studying seismic waves tells us what might be creating the waves. On Mars, scientists suspect that the culprits may be marsquakes, or meteorites striking the surface. Heat probe: InSight's heat flow probe, HP3, burrows deeper than any other scoops, drills or probes on Mars before it. It will investigate how much heat is still flowing out of Mars. Radio antennas: Like Earth, Mars wobbles a little as it rotates around its axis. To study this, two radio antennas, part of the RISE instrument, track the location of the lander very precisely. This helps scientists test the planet's reflexes and tells them how the deep interior structure affects the planet's motion around the Sun.\n\nThis image is said to be 'crisper' than previous snaps, which is all thanks to chance.\n\nNASA explained that compared to the pictures of InSight from November 2018, in this shot there is less dust in the air, shadows are offset and the lighting was 'also optimal for avoiding the bright reflections from the lander or its solar panels that have obscured surrounding pixels in other images'.\n\n'However, bright reflections are unavoidable with the seismometer cover just south of the lander because of its dome shape,' the American space agency.\n\nHiRISE has also been keeping tabs on NASA's Curiosity, which is roughly 373 miles from InSight, exploring a region called 'the clay-bearing unit.'\n\nNASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, manages the InSight, MRO and Curiosity missions for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington.
