As everyone\u2019s hearing is different, this allows each person to adjust the sounds they can and can\u2019t hear to enhance their listening experience.\u2019\n\nShe praised the technology for allowing people to customise different instruments to their own needs so lyrics do not get lost.\n\nSir Elton\u2019s farewell tour, which has seen him play more than 300 shows all over the planet, begins its UK leg on November 2 at the O2 Arena in London.", "description": "The innovation will make Sir Elton's concerns much more accessible for a fan base that includes people who bought his debut album Empty Sky 50 years ago.", "authors": ["Jake Harfurt For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/00/20013032-0-image-a-36_1571701031929.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
