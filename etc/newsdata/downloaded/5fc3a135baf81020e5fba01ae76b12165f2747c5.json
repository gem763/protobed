The latest move will add an additional 10% to the price of lobsters headed for China, which already face 25% penalty tariffs.\n\nUS and China agree to reopen trade talks in October Read more\n\nOne clear winner of the trade war has been Canada, which has exported twice as many live lobsters in 2019 as the previous year, according to industry figures.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just picked up a lot more of the market than we had before,\u201d said Geoff Irvine, head of the Lobster Council of Canada. \u201cAnd at the same time, the market is growing, so it\u2019s a twofold story.\u201d\n\nCanada was well-positioned for market dominance. It was already the largest lobster supplier in the world, and has signed free trade agreements with Europe, the US and a number of Asian countries in the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n\nThe booming fortunes of Canada\u2019s lobster industry have also have been aided by a changing climate. The waters around Nova Scotia, where the bulk of lobster are hauled from the Atlantic Ocean, have warmed slightly in recent years, dramatically increasing the number of lobsters that can be harvested.\n\nAs a result of global demand, Canada\u2019s lobster market share is expected to continue its blistering growth, surpassing more than $3bn by 2025 \u2013 triple the figure for 2010 \u2013 according to figures from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. Much of the demand is projected to come from Asia.\n\n\u201cNine years ago, China didn\u2019t buy any lobster,\u201d said Irvine. But rapidly growing middle and affluent classes in the country have spurred demand for luxury shellfish.\n\nCanadian fishermen are hesitant to weigh in on the trade war, fearful they might be caught in the crossfire \u2013 and for good reason: Canada has its own problems with China.\n\nAs recently as last year, talks of a free trade pact between China and Canada looked promising. But diplomatic relations between the two countries entered a deep freeze following the arrest of the telecoms executive Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver at the request of the US.\n\nIn recent months, China has sharply curtailed canola and pork markets imports from Canada, in a move largely seen as retribution for Meng\u2019s detention.\n\nAnd as the tariff war drives greater demand for live Canadian lobster, Irvine cautions against premature celebration. \u201cYou can\u2019t generalize in this industry. Even with the increased sales to China, it\u2019s meant less for other markets \u2013 which has affected people who are focused on those markets.\u201d\n\nBut the effects of the trade war have been unavoidable south of the border: US lobster fishermen are struggling to stay afloat.\n\nStephanie Nadeau, who runs the Lobster Company in Arundel, Maine, said she never experienced such bleak prospects.\n\nOver the past year, exports to China have ground to halt, forcing her to lay off seven employees \u2013 nearly half of her staff. \u201cWe have no market in China right now. None,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cUnless you want to go sell for nothing and you have a giant salesforce that can sit there and beat the phones all day, you\u2019re not going to replace [the Chinese market],\u201d she said.\n\nIn previous years, the US and Canada exported roughly the same amount of lobster to China. By June this year, Maine, America\u2019s largest lobster exporter, was supplying just 15% of the toothsome crustacean, while Canada accounted for 85%.\n\nIn the first six months of 2019, US lobster exports to China dropped to just 2.2m compared to 12m lb in the same period in 2018.\n\nMore than a year into the trade war, US lobster fishermen and women can see no end to their economic pains \u2013 and little sign that their plight has even been recognized by their own government. \u201cHow long am I supposed to sit here and not make any money?\u201d asked Nadeau.\n\n", "description": "Prices are at record levels and demand is growing for fishermen north of the border after China imposed tariffs on live lobsters", "authors": ["Leyland Cecco"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe145e4e0c3ef45c497851fb0d635aab17578aed/0_254_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b9a7cb10dfec52ea2f01331baf324662", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
