With cash flow declining and turnaround plans not working, Forever 21 had reportedly sought additional financing and a debt restructuring. But those talks have stalled, per Bloomberg, and now the company may look to take a debtor-in-possession loan and enter Chapter 11 reorganization.\n\nIn other words, here comes a lot of store closures.\n\nForever 21 didn\u2019t return Yahoo Finance\u2019s request for comment. The company \u2014 founded in 1984 \u2014 sells its cheap wares at more than 800 stores in the U.S., Europe, Asia and Latin America.\n\nTo hear Forever 21 is knocking on death\u2019s door isn\u2019t a shocker. In fact, one has to wonder what in the world took so long.\n\nFor starters, Forever 21 has become increasingly irrelevant in malls throughout the country. Whereas mall apparel rivals such as Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) has invested in product quality to entice shoppers, Forever 21 has stayed true to its cheaply made, cheaply priced merchandise roots. Whereas Zara has upped its fashion game (and its prices), Forever 21 hasn\u2019t kept pace according to experts Yahoo Finance has chatted up.\n\nAnd to add insult to injury, national apparel chains have focused on closing unproductive stores and downsizing others to drive healthier profits.\n\nLONDON, UNITED KINGDOM - 2019/08/09: Shoppers walk past a branch of Forever 21 store in central London.

And as a result, there really isn\u2019t any reason for the chain to exist \u2014 too many better options out yonder for consumers. Too many other better positioned retailers from a fundamental perspective.\n\n\u201cFirst off they lost their way on fashion \u2014 used to be really quick in copying higher end brands. They became over assorted \u2014 less impactful on fashion, while quality declined,\u201d said longtime retail analyst Janet Kloppenburg at JJK Research Associates. \u201cAlso the store footprint just kept getting larger and they have some huge 20,000-square-foot stores.\u201d\n\nSo there is that entire mess.\n\nDeclining retail stores\n\nThen there are the structural issues in retail that are no doubt pounding Forever 21 into the ground.\n\nFirst, there remains too many retail stores in America amid the shift to online shopping. Unproductive retail chains must \u2014 and will \u2014 be weeded out as people reduce trips to physical shops.\n\nThe shakeout in retail is likely to be massive. Investment bank UBS estimated earlier this year that as online retail sales penetration rises to 25% from 16% currently, about 75,000 retail stores will close shop by 2026. That amounts to 7% or so of the 1,044,754 retail locations UBS says exist.\n\nUBS believes 21,000 clothing stores out of the 82,000 in existence will have to close.\n\nIf you are near a Forever 21 \u2014 which has failed to evolve \u2014 this tsunami of store closings is likely to show up at your doorstep.\n\nThe rise of Walmart and Target\n\nMeanwhile, the fact is discount stores such as Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT) have gotten way better at giving shoppers what they want in apparel. The products are usually on trend and at great prices. Remember, the very existence of mall-based specialty apparel shops like Forever 21 came to be because discounters and department stores couldn\u2019t sell good merchandise at fair prices.\n\nNo more. Plus, it\u2019s the discounters with their large supply chains that are able to handle the rising worker wages in overseas markets and increased costs from tariffs. Fast-fashion\u2019s business model has long been predicated on low prices because of low costs.", "description": "Forever 21 potentially going out of business makes a lot of sense.", "authors": ["Brian Sozzi"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0aPGgOpQLmpEQLvyQ9X9Mg--~B/aD0yMjcwO3c9MzUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-07/eea54050-ae1e-11e9-959f-945d90f212aa"}
