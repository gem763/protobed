Typically, people don\u2019t like to ask for cash back unless it\u2019s more than \u00a315 because they are worried about appearing cheap.\n\nAnd friends who do remind people about money they are owed have to ask twice, on average, before they get their cash back \u2013 meaning not one but at least two awkward conversations.\n\nThere\u2019s also a gender repayment gap. Women are less willing to confront their friends and reclaim their cash \u2013 24 per cent of men said they would challenge friends over debts, compared to just 14 per cent of women.\n\nLuke Massie, the founder of VibePay, says: \u201cAs a nation, we find it excruciatingly uncomfortable reminding a friend they owe you money. Yet, this reluctance is not just leaving a big hole in our pockets, it\u2019s also destroying friendships.\u201d\n\nAvoiding awkwardness comes with a pretty hefty price tag. And it\u2019s not just an issue with lending money.\n\nThe cost of avoiding awkwardness\n\nIf you\u2019re owed money and you\u2019re too polite to reclaim it, you may like to know that losing money to avoid awkwardness is a fairly typical British trait.\n\nNine out of 10 British people say they have spent money just to avoid looking impolite, according to a study by the savings website VoucherCodes.co.uk.\n\nThings like paying for a round of drinks or splitting the bill in a restaurant despite having a cheaper meal were some of the most common ways that people said they spent more than they wanted.\n\nAnita Naik, a spokeswoman for the site, said: \u201cBrits have a reputation for being especially polite and non-confrontational but, as the research shows, this quite literally comes at a cost.\n\n\u201cBuying an extra drink when out with friends might seem insignificant on its own, but each of these small costs can really add up \u2013 I\u2019m sure most of us can think of many things we\u2019d rather spend \u00a3279 on.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear us Brits place value on appearing polite and maintaining harmony with our friends and family.\u201d\n\nYet that can\u2019t always work. One in five British people has fallen out with friends because of money, research from the mobile payment system Paym shows.\n\nSo what is the answer? How can good friends help out with an occasional sub or spend without being left out of pocket? Here are some suggestions for keeping both your money and your friends.\n\n* Be clear on timings\n\nBy setting a clear timetable for repayment, even of smaller amounts, you highlight that you expect this cash to be returned to you in good time.\n\nA Paym spokesperson says: \u201cIf you are buying some concert tickets for you and a mate, make it clear when you expect to be paid back, or even better get them to send you the money before you make the purchase.\u201d\n\n* Be clear it\u2019s a loan\n\nMassie recommends being really clear that a loan is not a gift: \u201cWhen you lend a friend money that you expect to be returned, make it crystal clear that they need to pay you back \u2013 don\u2019t let there be any confusion over whether it\u2019s a gift or a loan.\u201d\n\n* Don\u2019t feel you need to justify it\n\nIt may be tempting to explain why you need your money back, with comments like: \u201cI need the money for my holiday\u201d, but Massie says to resist.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do it,\u201d he says. \u201cYou lent them money and they owe you. If they come back with a reason why they can\u2019t pay you back today, set a date for when they can and hold them to it.\u201d\n\n* Chase your money\n\nIt can feel so awkward asking for money that many people simply don\u2019t follow it up. But that is when text messages can be really helpful.\n\nSend a friendly message asking for the cash to be transferred, for example: \u201cHi, can you send me the \u00a310 for Amy\u2019s birthday present?\u201d\n\n* Use tech\n\nThere are so many apps that let you split bills or make fast payments to friends now. Some banking apps allow people to make payment using just a mobile number, for example.\n\nSo if you do end up spending money on a friend and you\u2019ve agreed they will repay you, then having a handy tech solution could ensure they pay up immediately rather than run the risk they will forget.", "description": "If you\u2019ve ever been left quietly fuming because a friend hasn\u2019t paid you back money that they owe then you\u2019re not alone.
