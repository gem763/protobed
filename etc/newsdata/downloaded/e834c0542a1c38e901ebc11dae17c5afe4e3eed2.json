The interest rate on borrowings will remain unchanged.\n\nOutgoing President Mario Draghi was reportedly the package\u2019s biggest sponsor but faced opposition by Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann, Klaas Knot, the president of the Dutch central bank, and their French counterpart Fran\u00e7ois Villeroy de Galhau.\n\nThe policymakers believed the current economic situation did not warrant such a stimulus push, including a restart of unconventional monetary policies known as quantitative easing that pump money into markets through bond purchases.\n\nHowever, before the announcement, investors and economists predicted Draghi would overcome internal opposition. Olli Rehn, the governor of the central bank of Finland, strengthened the expectations of significant new support measures last month when he said monetary stimulus would have had to be substantial in order to be effective.\n\nDraghi will hold a press conference in Frankfurt later this afternoon.", "description": "", "authors": ["Silvia Sciorilli Borrelli", "Bjarke Smith-Meyer", "Paul Taylor", "Ma\u00efa De La Baume"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-866631482-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
