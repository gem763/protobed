Trevor Shaffer of the Melbourne Police Department told Fox News Wednesday an officer was on foot patrol at Paradise Beach Park at around 8 a.m. the previous day when a beachgoer told the officer something suspicious had apparently washed ashore.\n\nShaffer said the officer investigated and found a package that looked like narcotics because of the way it had been wrapped.\n\nHURRICANE DORIAN'S DEVASTATION IN THE BAHAMAS REVEALED\n\nThe lieutenant said that tests determined the brick was filled with cocaine, which he called a \u201crare\u201d discovery for the area. More than a kilogram of cocaine was in the package, with an estimated street value of between $35,000 and $45,000.\n\nHe said the cocaine will be destroyed unless investigators could figure out its source, link someone to the package, and make an arrest.\n\nOn Friday, police in Cocoa Beach said a beachgoer discovered a red duffle bag that contained 15 bricks of cocaine, worth between $300,000 and $450,000.\n\nHURRICANE DORIAN LASHES FLORIDA WITH TROPICAL STORM CONDITIONS, AS CAROLINAS BRACE FOR 'VERY CLOSE BRUSH'\n\nSgt.
