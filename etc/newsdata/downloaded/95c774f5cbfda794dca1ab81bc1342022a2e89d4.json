The party said dentists and community health centres would be reimbursed for the services they provide.\n\nSingh called the announcement \"a down payment\" on party founder Tommy Douglas's goal of having dental care included in Canada's health care system.\n\nThe party laid out the bare bones of a plan back in June in an early platform release.\n\n\"A New Democrat government will work together with provincial partners, health professionals and dentists to develop a roadmap to including dental care in the Canada Health Act,\" says the document.", "description": "The NDP is promising free dental care for households making under $70,000 starting next year if it wins a mandate in this fall's federal election.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5287890.1568805686!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/fedelxn-ndp-20190917.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
