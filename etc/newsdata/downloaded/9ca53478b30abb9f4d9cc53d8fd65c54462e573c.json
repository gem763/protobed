Photo: RICHARD AVEDON, \u00a9 THE RICHARD AVEDON FOUNDATION\n\nWe all know the Richard Avedon style of portraiture: pure-white backdrop, classical pose, a Kissinger or Monroe (or even a man covered with bees) before the lens. But he also shot thousands of advertisements, many in color, most very different from his editorial work. His first was for a department-store line, Salymil Junior by Milgrim, in 1944, and his last was for Harry Winston in 2004. In the American century \u2014 so named by Time and Life, where some of these ads appeared \u2014 Avedon was one of the principal figures who showed us how he and his clients thought it ought to look.\n\nAvedon Advertising.

Before the campaign he shot for Clairol, one in seven American women dyed their hair; afterward, it was one in two. When in the 1990s Hush Puppies carried off a miracle, repositioning itself from \u201cstrictly for dorky sociology professors\u201d to \u201cso clunky it\u2019s hip,\u201d it was Avedon who helped that happen. (The photos, tellingly, focus on the models and barely show the shoes.) And they are his ads: Over the years, he increasingly inserted himself into agency conversations in order to knit together strategy and image.\n\nThe compilers of the book make a case for female empowerment in these images, which only halfway holds up. Yes, the Versace woman commands the shirtless Versace man. Yes, it\u2019s noticeable that African-American women like Leontyne Price and Lena Horne appear in Avedon\u2019s mass-market ads in an era when they were rarely featured outside Ebony or Jet. But it\u2019s impossible not to see that the image of womanhood on view in these pages is somewhat constrained, especially in the earlier decades. What is inarguable is the technical mastery in the photography, with one fantastic model\u2019s gaze after another (even when he\u2019s working for Royal Crown Cola rather than Dior). Make your way through the 60 years covered by this book and you come away better understanding the creation of desire.\n\nClairol, 1959: The brand\u2019s \u201cDoes She \u2026 Or Doesn\u2019t She\u201d hair-dye ads ran for more than a decade, altering women\u2019s consumer trends (a blessing and a curse).
