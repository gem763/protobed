Roughly 150,000 military personnel will conduct drills through Sept. 28, said Remigio Ceballos, strategic commander of the Bolivarian National Armed Forces, who is overseeing operations.\n\nMaduro has come under growing pressure from both the U.S. and Colombia, which along with 50 other nations back opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 as Venezuela's leader. They contend Maduro's reelection in 2018 was bogus.\n\nTensions spiked recently when Colombia and Venezuela accused each other of harboring hostile armed groups within their borders, intent on overthrowing the neighboring government.\n\nImmediately after Maduro's pronouncement, U.S. Special Envoy for Venezuela Elliott Abrams said that Colombia would have full American support in the case of an attack by terrorist groups or Venezuelan armed forces.\n\nHHS AZAR: VENEZUELANS ARE CAUGHT IN A MASSIVE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS\n\n\u201cThe United States is not closer [to a military conflict with Venezuela], but I do worry a lot about the Colombian-Venezuelan border,\u201d said Abrams via videoconference from Brussels, where he had been discussing the Venezuelan crisis with members of the European Union.\n\nAbrams added that U.S. intelligence information has confirmed the presence of the left-wing Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the National Liberation Army (ELN) in Venezuela. Colombian authorities estimate as many as 1,000 ELN rebels \u2014 or around 40 percent of that rebel group's fighting force \u2014 operate from Venezuela. The rebels there plan attacks like the January car bombing at a Bogota police academy that killed more than 20 mostly young cadets, Colombia says.\n\nTRUMP, MADURO CONFIRM 'SECRET' US-VENEZUELA TALKS\n\n\"This is very dangerous because if there are cross-border attacks from Venezuela into Colombia, we can expect the Colombians to react. And obviously, we would be fully supportive of Colombia in that situation,\" said Abrams. The special envoy reiterated what the Trump administration has said on several occasions, that it is not the current policy of the U.S. government to consider a military response to the feud.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nCarlos Trujillo, the U.S. ambassador to the Organization of American States, said it was \"totally unacceptable\" that Maduro's \"illegitimate government\" has threatened the region's security and peace.\n\n\"Colombia's allies will do everything possible to help one of the best allies we've had \u2014 not only in the Americas but in the world,\" Trujillo added during a conference call with reporters.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Disputed Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro announced the start of military exercises on his country's border with Colombia Tuesday, prompting Washington to promise the Bogota government its \"full support.\"", "authors": ["Morgan Phillips"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/ContentBroker_contentid-10aac1bb9a38445b98966b3d0d45677b.png", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
