First and foremost, did he quit or was he fired? If you\u2019re asked to resign, that\u2019s a little bit of both, right? We\u2019ll probably have to wait for the next series of tell-all books to come out to have a better idea.\n\nBut there\u2019s one group of people who probably don\u2019t care how it happened. They\u2019re just glad to see him gone. No, I\u2019m not talking about Tucker Carlson, who mysteriously claimed that Bolton was \u201cfundamentally a man of the left\u201d last night. Nor are we discussing the many Democrats who were setting off fireworks in celebration, simply grateful that Bolton hadn\u2019t talked Trump into another war. No, I\u2019m speaking of the leadership in Iran. No sooner had the news broken than they were out congratulating the President on this decision and calling for an end to the \u201cwarmongering\u201d ways of the former UN Ambassador.\n\nIran\u2019s president urged the U.S. on Wednesday to \u201cput warmongers aside\u201d as tensions roil the Persian Gulf amid an escalating crisis between Washington and Tehran in the wake of the collapsing nuclear deal with world powers. Hassan Rouhani\u2019s remarks signaled approval of President Donald Trump\u2019s abrupt dismissal of John Bolton as national security adviser. Bolton had been hawkish on Iran and other global challenges. Rouhani\u2019s website quoted him as further urging the U.S. to \u201cabandon warmongering and its maximum pressure policy\u201d on Iran. He spoke at a Cabinet meeting in Tehran.\n\nI don\u2019t know what Rouhani\u2019s been smoking in his hookah lately, but I suspect they should be prepared for some serious disappointment. To think that all (or even most) of our policy toward Iran was coming from John Bolton whispering in the President\u2019s ear is more than a bit of a stretch. Trump was planning to get tough on Iran before he was even elected and it was his plan to ditch the nuclear deal and apply sanctions if Iran didn\u2019t show some progress on eliminating their secret nuclear program.\n\nGranted, John Bolton certainly put a more militaristic spin on things than the President generally does. And I won\u2019t deny that he probably wouldn\u2019t have been terribly upset if we\u2019d wound up in a shooting war over there, but that really hasn\u2019t been Donald Trump\u2019s style. Aside from some missile attacks in Syria, he\u2019s generally been quite reluctant to expand our military adventures abroad.\n\nI\u2019m fairly sure that Donald Trump doesn\u2019t want to go down in the history books as the President who started another war that couldn\u2019t be finished before he left office. In fact, despite the criticism he had for Barack Obama over pulling out of Iraq, Trump has seemed more than determined to get us out of Afghanistan. Unfortunately for him, there just isn\u2019t a clean way to do it.\n\nGetting back to Iran, the rest of Rouhani\u2019s complaints were centered on Trump\u2019s policies of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d and sanctions designed to force that country into compliance and cooperation with the IAEA. And again, those were not policies that were cooked up solely by John Bolton. Expecting them to change drastically now that he\u2019s gone simply seems unrealistic.", "description": "Huzzah", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/rouhani-araghchi.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
