'To seemingly feed to their teacup Yorkie? What is happening?? WHY?! Do Yorkies only eat shrimp?'\n\nOn blast: Busy Philipps was flabbergasted when a couple sitting nearby on a recent flight took out a large container of shrimp \u2014 to feed to their small dog\n\nShaming: The 40-year-old tweeted about the inconsiderate dog owners on October 2\n\nHer followers seemed to sympathize, with many blasting the couple for bringing smelly food on a plane \u2014 which most considered to be a major breech of etiquette and a rude thing to inflict on fellow passengers.\n\n'Fish on a plane?! Isn\u2019t there an unwritten rule about that? Like heating up fish in the office microwave. Prayers for your nostrils!' wrote one.\n\n'I bet that smells amazing,' sarcastically quipped another, adding a vomiting emoji.\n\nIn fact, several people posted vomiting and green-faced emojis, and expressed in other ways that they found the move gross.\n\n'How is that allowed on a plane in 2019?' demanded one.\n\n'Get the air marshal!' tweeted another.\n\nA few deliberately missed the point of Busy's tweet and cracked jokes about the incident.\n\nHow shellfish! Plenty of other Twitter users were horrified and confused by the rude passengers\n\n'And they didn\u2019t share? How shellfish,' wrote one.\n\n'Yorkies only eat shrimp on planes. Everyone knows this,' said another.\n\nWhile Busy's experience was no doubt unpleasant, it's at least not as bad as a mishap she encountered with Delta Airlines last year, when she put the air carrier on blast for re-booking her and her daughter Birdie on separate planes to different locations after their original flight was canceled.\n\nBusy was in Los Angeles with her then-nine-year-old Birdie and her youngest daughter Cricket, who was about to turn five at the time.\n\n'Hey @Delta! Thanks for cancelling my flight and then rerouting us and separating my MINOR child onto a different flight than mine and having a 2 HR call time wait!' Busy wrote in a since-deleted tweet. 'You are terrible!'\n\nBusy later provided more details on Instagram, explaining that she had received 'a text that our other flight was canceled and they had rerouted us and put us on different planes to different places'.\n\nWild: Last year, Busy was furious when Delta Airlines canceled her flight, then rebooked her and her daughter Birdie on separate flights landing in different cities\n\nMom fixes it! Busy said she'd never have allowed that to happen and managed to find a flight they could all fit on through her own research\n\nMaking amends: The airline apologized to Busy on Twitter after she called out the company\n\nFixing it: Delta asked Busy to share her confirmation details privately in order to assist her\n\nThe mother said 'B was going to Detroit' while she was headed to St. Paul, Minnesota.\n\nHer family was eventually able to travel together.\n\n'Thankfully, we found a flight that we could all get on at 2:30 in the morning,' she said.\n\nOn Twitter, a fan asked Busy whether Birdie had to travel by herself, writing: 'Why would they separate you from your child? Please tell me you didn't let them fly without you. OMG.'\n\nBusy made it clear that was never a possibility in her mind, responding: 'I would NEVER!!!!!!'\n\nDelta apologized for the incident. An employee told the actress on Twitter: 'Hello, Busy. My sincere apology, please be assured that this does not represent the Delta Brand of customer service.'\n\nThat same employee added in a separate tweet: 'I really would like an opportunity, to do everything possible to help, please share with me in a direct message your ticket number or Confirmation Code from this travel.'\n\nThe airline told People it has refunded the unused part of Busy's travel arrangements.\n\nDelta apologized in a statement to the publication 'for the inconvenience this caused Ms. Philipps'.", "description": "The 40-year-old actor was on a flight on October 2 when, she said, a couple pulled out 'a giant takeout container of cooked shrimp.'
