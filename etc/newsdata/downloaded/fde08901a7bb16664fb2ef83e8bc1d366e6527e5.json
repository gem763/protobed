He boxed with Beto on mandatory gun buybacks.\n\nSouth Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg made a strong pitch to moderate Democrats during Tuesday\u2019s Democratic debate and defended the center against a bevy of attacks. In doing so, he may have helped give centrists who are hesitant about former Vice President Joe Biden a reason to give him another look.\n\nButtigieg\u2019s first eye-catching exchange came with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who he slammed for refusing to say that Medicare for All would raise middle-class taxes. Even the bill\u2019s author, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), admitted as much.\n\n\u201cWe heard it tonight: A yes or no question that didn't get a yes or no answer,\u201d Buttigieg said to Warren. \u201cYour signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything \u2014 except this.\u201d\n\nWarren fired back that Buttigieg\u2019s \u201cMedicare for all who want it\u201d plan really meant \u201cMedicare for all who can afford it,\u201d but she, at best, fought Buttigieg to a draw as he argued against eliminating all private health insurance. Other candidates, meanwhile, jumped in to tweak her for evading a direct answer.\n\nREAD: Warren won't say the word \u2018taxes\u2019 when she talks about Medicare for All.\n\nThe moment was arguably the first time Warren has been knocked back on her heels since the start of debate season.\n\nA bit later, Buttigieg got some of the loudest applause of the night as he sparred with Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), a fellow military veteran, over U.S. foreign policy in Syria and the Middle East.\n\nButtigieg said Gabbard was \u201cdead wrong\u201d for her previous support for removing all U.S. troops from Syria, a move that President Trump has now made with disastrous consequences.\n\n\u201cThe slaughter going in Syria is not a consequence of American presence. It\u2019s a consequence of a withdrawal and a betrayal by this president of American allies and American values,\u201d Buttigieg said, pushing back as Gabbard accused him of supporting \u201cendless war\u201d and a \u201cregime change war.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can put an end to endless war without embracing Donald Trump\u2019s policy, as you\u2019re doing,\u201d he retorted.\n\nGabbard had effectively attacked other Democrats in earlier debates, but Buttigieg got the best of her \u2014 and highlighted his own military service to lend weight to his presidential campaign.\n\nREAD: Democrats can\u2019t agree on how badly they want to screw over billionaires.\n\nOne of the tensest moments of the night came as Buttigieg argued with former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-Texas) over his calls for a mandatory assault weapons buy-back. The exchange was the culmination of weeks of increasingly personal fighting between the two.\n\n\"[Let's] not be limited by the polls and the consultants and the focus groups. Let's do what's right when we have time to do what's right,\" O'Rourke said, accusing Buttigieg of poll-testing his policies.\n\n\u201cThe problem isn't the polls. The problem is the policy. And I don't need lessons from you on courage, political or personal,\u201d Buttigieg fired back. \u201cEveryone on this stage recognizes, or at least I thought we did, that the problem is not other Democrats who don't agree with your particular idea of how to handle this. The problem is the National Rifle Association, and their enablers in Congress.\u201d\n\nAnd at the end of the evening, after front-runners Biden, Warren, and Sanders had sparred with one another, Buttigieg argued they were offering voters a \u201cfalse choice\u201d between a return to politics as usual and an unrealistic vision of the future.\n\nBiden had an uneven night, fading for long stretches, struggling to give a clean answer on his son Hunter\u2019s international work and stumbling even on some layups like his key role in passing gun control legislation in the 1990s. But he\u2019s had other mediocre debate performances and has remained at or near the top of the polls so far, partly because other centrist Democrats have struggled to rise into the top tier of the race.\n\nButtigieg has a long way to go if he wants to be the Democratic nominee \u2014 he\u2019s currently polling a distant fourth in national polls, mired in the mid-single digits behind Warren, Biden and Sanders. But while more than a half-dozen candidates have been looking to be moderates\u2019 next choice if Biden fades in this race, Buttigieg made the best argument yet on Tuesday to get another look.\n\nCover: Sen.
