The announcement comes just days after Trump tweeted about the departure of John Bolton, a hawk who was often at odds with the president and some of his closest advisers.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s worked with me for quite a while now on hostages. And we\u2019ve got a tremendous track record with respect to hostages,\u201d Trump told reporters outside Air Force One on Wednesday.\n\nO\u2019Brien, who was traveling with Trump in Los Angeles, told reporters he \u201clook[s] forward\u201d to working with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark Esper. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a number of challenges, but there\u2019s a great team in place,\u201d he said. \u201cI look forward to working with them and working with the president to keep America safe and continue to rebuild our military.\u201d\n\nMultiple sources close to the White House told Yahoo News that O\u2019Brien, an attorney who was appointed as the special envoy on hostage issues in May 2018, has a strong rapport not only with Trump but also with Pompeo and the president\u2019s senior adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner. \u201cThis guy has done amazing work,\u201d said one source familiar with the matter, citing multiple hostage recoveries without ransoms being paid.\n\nOne of the sources said the president narrowed his shortlist for the post to Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg and O\u2019Brien, but the envoy\u2019s high-profile work to help free A$AP Rocky, the American rapper detained in Sweden, was a key factor in Trump\u2019s decision to name him to the post.\n\nO\u2019Brien\u2019s appointment signifies a further elevation of the importance the administration has placed on rescuing captured Americans overseas. Trump and other senior administration officials have touted their record recovering hostages and pressuring adversaries like Iran, Venezuela and North Korea in tweets and public statements.\n\nO\u2019Brien has worked to help release prisoners from countries including North Korea, Turkey and Iran, and is also credited with advocating for journalist Austin Tice, who has been held in Syria since 2012.\n\nHis most recent high-profile case came in July, when the White House sent O\u2019Brien to Stockholm as Trump and his allies sought to get rapper A$AP Rocky released from a Swedish jail where he was detained during a trial that followed a street brawl.\n\nThe involvement of the hostage envoy, a position President Barack Obama created in 2015 to help recover Americans wrongfully detained or kidnapped, was unique. Sweden, a democratic country, had charged the American rapper with assault; Rocky ultimately had to pay a fine after being found guilty and was released.\n\nRobert O'Brien arriving at the district court in Stockholm for the trial of U.S. rapper A$AP Rocky on Aug. 2.
