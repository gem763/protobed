The network has released a new trailer for its take on Philip Pullman\u2019s His Dark Materials book series (you might best remember them from the title of the first book, The Golden Compass, which was adapted into a movie we don\u2019t talk about). The series stars Logan\u2019s Dafne Keen as the books\u2019 hero Lyra, with James McAvoy as the intrepid Lord Asriel, Ruth Wilson as a frighteningly stern Mrs. Coulter, and Lin-Manuel Miranda trying his darndest to seem gritty as balloonist adventurer Lee Scoresby. Jack Thorne (Harry Potter and the Cursed Child) is writing the show, while Tom Hooper is directing the first two episodes. The project is a co-production with the BBC and reportedly one of the most expensive British drama series to date. You can watch the first trailer below.\n\nThe first season of His Dark Materials follows Lyra, \u201ca seemingly ordinary but brave young woman from another world,\u201d per an HBO release. \u201cHer search for a kidnapped friend uncovers a sinister plot involving stolen children, and becomes a quest to understand a mysterious phenomenon called Dust. As she journeys through the worlds, including our own, Lyra meets Will, a determined and courageous boy. Together, they encounter extraordinary beings and dangerous secrets, with the fate of both the living \u2014 and the dead \u2014 in their hands.\u201d In short: Please don\u2019t cancel your subscriptions, we put Ruth Wilson in a really intimidating coat!", "description": "Watch the trailer for HBO\u2019s big adaptation of Philip Pullman\u2019s \u201cHis Dark Materials\u201d book series produced with the BBC starring Ruth Wilson, Lin-Manuel Miranda, and more.", "authors": ["Jackson Mchenry"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/03/03-his-dark-materials.w1200.h630.jpg"}
