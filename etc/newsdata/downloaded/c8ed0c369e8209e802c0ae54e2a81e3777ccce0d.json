The timeline is a bit messy, so try to stay with us on this one. Microsoft released a Windows update last week to fix a bug from a previous patch that was causing unexpected CPU spikes, killing users\u2019 performance on their desktops and laptops. This patch came with some annoying bugs of its own, which Microsoft (and other users) are now attempting to address.\n\nMicrosoft 10 Updates Have Jumped The Shark It's happened again. Windows 10's September update, designed to remedy a crippling bug in the previous update, is causing more problems than it's fixing. Cheers for that, Microsoft. Here are the functions that are currently affected. Read more\n\nThe first security update, KB4515384, fixed the CPU-spiking problem, but it added a few extra issues of its own. These included breaking the Start-Menu Search feature\u2014giving you a big screen of nothing instead of answers when you searched for items\u2014and causing some unexpected audio issues in various games.\n\nMicrosoft has since rolled back the change that caused gamers\u2019 sound to mysteriously disappear, dramatically decrease in volume, or lose bass (to name a few outcomes). It has also posted an update to provide some advice for what gamers can do to resolve any issues they\u2019re experiencing:\n\n\u201cTo mitigate the issue, open settings in the impacted game and disable multi-channel audio, if this option is available. You can also search in the Windows Control Panel for third-party audio device control panels and disable Multi-channel audio or Virtual Surround Sound, if these options are available. We are working on a resolution and estimate a solution will be available in late September.\u201d\n\nOther potential fixes found by those afflicted include dropping your sample rate (on the Advanced tab of your speaker or headphone properties window), uninstalling the KB4515384 entirely (via Windows Update > View update history), or even disabling all sound effects under the \u201cEnhancements\u201d tab of your speaker or headphone properties.\n\nMicrosoft Admits To Crippling Windows 10 Bug (But A Fix Is Coming) Microsoft launched a new Windows 10 update on August 30 but users soon spotted a major bug causing Cortana to chew up a huge chunk of their CPU's power. Microsoft has acknowledge the error and is working to remedy it. Here's what you need to know. Read more\n\nAs for the Window Search issue\u2014the other biggie\u2014Reddit user CptBrian posted a potential workaround that might be able to get you up and running again:\n\n\u201cI just had the blank Search issue after installing 1903, but I fixed it with a simple registry edit. Regedit: [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Search]\u201cCortanaConsent\u201d=dword:00000001 Basically just change CortanaConsent\u2019s value from 0 to 1. This may require reboot or logout.\u201d\n\nYou can also try running through Microsoft\u2019s generic advice for fixing Windows Search issues. However, I\u2019m willing to bet that these simpler troubleshooting tips probably won\u2019t do you much good.\n\nIf you don\u2019t find any success, you can always uninstall the update (as previously mentioned) and make sure you pause the auto-installation of future updates for a reasonable amount of time. (I\u2019d give it 14 days or so myself, just to be through, but the time you pick is up to you.)", "description": "Here we go again. The timeline is a bit messy, so try to stay with us on this one.
