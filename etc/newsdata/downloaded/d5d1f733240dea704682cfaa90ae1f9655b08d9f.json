Moulding to the body in response to heat and pressure, it allows for a completely even distribution of body weight.\n\nThen, once the pressure is removed, it returns to its original shape, but \u201cremembers\u201d the shape of your head for the following night. Whether you want to treat or prevent joint pains and back problems or help with conditions such as sleep apnoea, these pillows can be a godsend.\n\nOur tests involved sleeping on the pillows for at least a couple of nights, taking into consideration comfort, support, durability and value for money.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

But alas, the yellow piping doesn\u2019t match most decors.\n\nComfort wise, it manages that difficult balance between soft and supportive, but don\u2019t be afraid to try it with a second pillow underneath if you\u2019re usually a two-pillow kind of person and it feels too thin on its own. It\u2019s hypoallergenic, superb at stopping sweat and the 30-night home trial is a nice touch to help the undecided. You might catch a slight chemical whiff initially, but it doesn\u2019t last more than a day or two.\n\nBuy now\n\nTempur comfort pillow cloud: \u00a387.99, Bensons for Beds\n\nOur top choice for back sleepers due to the height, this is also a favourite among some side sleepers especially if they are willing to ditch their two pillows to try just one. It\u2019s heavier than most pillows, which makes it easy to assume it will be rigid.\n\nBut it\u2019s actually very squishy, hence the cloud-like claims (which it really does live up to) yet it bounces back into shape instantly and is supportive enough to provide instant comfort for neck or back ailments. From a top name in memory foam pillows, it has a machine washable cotton cover and also excels at keeping you cool.\n\nBuy now\n\nOTTY adjustable pillow: \u00a384.99, OTTY\n\nThis is the more expensive (by a long shot) of OTTY\u2019s two memory foam pillows, but we think this one stands out for its versatility. The secret lies in the removable foam fillings, which allows you to adapt the firmness and height according to your head size, how broad your shoulders are and whether you\u2019re a front, side or back sleeper. What you don\u2019t use, you can store in the zippable pouch.\n\nIt\u2019s breathable, cool and everything about it feels top quality, including the outer cover which is filled with soft duck down. If you\u2019re not happy with your setup within two weeks, you can get a refund. But for pressure relief, we think there are better memory foam pillows out there.\n\nBuy now\n\nDormeo octasmart pillow: \u00a349, Dormeo\n\nThe concept of having 24 individual memory foam springs under your head might make you wonder if you\u2019ll get any sleep at all. The idea is to keep you supported in every sleep position and actually, it does just that. There\u2019s a good level of squidge and comfort and because the air flows so easily between the octasprings, and it stays noticeably cooler than traditional memory foam pillows.\n\nThe removable, anti-allergenic washable cover stands out too \u2013 it\u2019s made with hundreds of comfort pockets that add an extra level of cosiness. It\u2019s somewhere in the middle in terms of bulk \u2013 there are both flatter and higher memory foam pillows available.\n\nBuy now\n\nRested the moon pillow: \u00a360, Rested\n\nRested has nailed it when it comes to producing memory foam pillows specifically aimed at the type of sleeper you are. First, there\u2019s the butterfly pillow, its unusual shape stops your nose squashing against it if you\u2019re a front sleeper or your neck from lacking support if you\u2019re a back sleeper. And then there\u2019s this, the moon, which is by far its best seller and made for side sleepers.\n\nThe curved edges support the shoulder area while the memory foam core, with its 12cm height, cradles the head and allows for good spinal alignment. Some back sleepers swear by it too. There are other similar shaped pillows with cheaper price tags, but this one tops the lot for all-round quality and it has a washable cover.\n\nBuy now\n\nIkea klubbsporre ergonomic pillow: \u00a329, Ikea\n\nIf you\u2019re prone to getting sweaty at night, this is well worth considering. On one side, there\u2019s bouncy cushioning foam, while on the other there\u2019s cooling gel which \u2013 together with the moisture wicking fabric \u2013 stops your head from getting too hot. The removable, machine washable cover keeps things clean and hygienic and despite the unusual shape, it fits in an extra long 50 x 80cm pillowcase.\n\nThe comfort levels, while good, aren\u2019t quite up there with the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of pillows reviewed here, and we found it quite heavy. But what it loses in squishiness, it gains in saving you from horribly hot, sticky nights.\n\nBuy now\n\nSealy activsleep Geltex memory foam pillow: \u00a334.99, Amazon\n\nThis stands out for breathability, thanks to the focus on ventilation and airflow which runs between the hundreds of tiny fibres that surround the Geltex core. It\u2019s been made with allergy sufferers in mind too, with hypoallergenic filling and a knitted Purotex cover to prevent bugs and bacteria.\n\nIt\u2019s on the stodgy side, as well as being quite high, so perhaps not the best option for anyone wanting a gentle transition into memory foam \u2013 but those who are after something robust and substantial will more than satisfied. Good luck fitting it into a regular sized pillow case, though.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe White Company memory foam comfort pillow: \u00a345, The White Company\n\nThis claims to offer firm support but as it\u2019s made from shredded memory foam, we found it a lot more yielding than many of its rivals.\n\nFeeling more like a luxury down pillow, you can even plump it up. Especially good for side sleepers, it lives up to its promise of bridging the gap between the shoulder and neck for perfect alignment \u2013 something we judged by a noticeable lack of tossing and turning while going to sleep and a distinct reduction in aches and pains among a tester who was prone to waking up to neck twinges.\n\nWe like the hygiene factor \u2013 the polyester/bamboo casing can be unzipped and bunged in the washing machine. And it stays cool, no doubt helped by the added air flow of the contents.\n\nBuy now\n\nTempur original pillow: \u00a372, John Lewis & Partners\n\nThis looks hard, with a dip in the middle, all of which can be quite off-putting, especially if you haven\u2019t yet entered the world of memory foam. But we were smitten. The contour is designed to support the neck and this, together with the soft cover and spot-on sink-ability and height, made it an instant winner for us.\n\nIt\u2019s as if it\u2019s been created specifically for the contours of your body and as such, is off the scale ergonomically. It\u2019s available in different sizes and you can wash the cover at 60C, with spares \u2013 as well as pillow cases \u2013 available to buy separately.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe Emma pillow: \u00a365, Emma\n\nThis is customisable. On one side, there\u2019s a classic memory foam that slowly moulds to your head and neck as you lie into it and on the other, a firmer, more supportive side. In the middle is the core level which supports both. Each of these layers are removable so you can adjust the height of the pillow \u2013 if you\u2019re a side sleeper, you\u2019ll probably keep all three, whereas back and front sleepers may opt for just two.\n\nYou\u2019ll need some patience as it\u2019s not all that easy, but we got there in the end. There\u2019s a 100-night trial so you have time to decide if it\u2019s the one for you, and there\u2019s a machine washable cover. Impressively restful and great for personalisation.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Memory foam pillows\n\nYou can count on Eve\u2019s the memory foam pillow to kill off aches and pains caused by poor posture at night. And if you don\u2019t like the feel of it, you can get your money back after 30 days. The Tempur cloud support pillow should get a special mention too \u2013 it\u2019s soft and squishy yet incredibly supportive.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
