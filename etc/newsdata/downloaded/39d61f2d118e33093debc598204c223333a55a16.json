His flippancy over the fate of the Kurds in northern Syria has been criminal in its disregard for human life, America\u2019s friends and American interests. From Trump\u2019s sort-of green light to Turkey\u2019s assault on northern Syria, to his threat to \u201ctotally destroy and obliterate\u201d the Turkish economy, to his Chamberlain-like dismissal of Kurds\u2019 fate (\u201cWe are 7,000 miles away!\u201d), he has played the clown in chief.\n\nAmerica\u2019s word is worth less today than at any time since 1945. Trust is not an easily recoverable commodity. Solemn accords entered into by the United States, like the Iran nuclear deal, are ripped up \u2014 and replaced by empty threats. Friends like the Kurds who have shed blood to inflict great harm on the Islamic State are betrayed. Day after day a president for whom facts don\u2019t matter dismantles the idea of truth.\n\nThe postwar American-led order was based on treaty undertakings convincing to allies. That\u2019s dead. What will take its place is unclear. Under President Trump \u201cforeign policy\u201d has become an oxymoron . Foreign theater has replaced it \u2014 and people die on the bloody stage of Trump\u2019s whims.\n\nEuropeans now shrug when they don\u2019t laugh. The consensus is the United States has lost it. There\u2019s nobody home. A child-president in the Oval Office writes a letter to the Turkish leader who appropriately tosses it in the garbage. That\u2019s where we are this week. Next week is anybody\u2019s guess. Trump and uncertainty are synonymous. A rough compass indicates presidential derangement is pointing north.", "description": "Kurds always get shafted.
