A government bailout would not have solved the company\u2019s financial problems.\n\n\u201cThe business had been experiencing financial difficulties for many years and was carrying the burden of repayments on \u00a31.6 billion of debt it had built up after coming close to collapse in 2012.\n\n\u201cA government bailout would have thrown good money after bad, leaving taxpayers to pick up the bill.\n\n\u201cWhen a large company faces difficulties, it is standard procedure for one department to act as a single government contact. In this instance it was the Department for Transport.\n\n\u201cIn response to the collapse, the government has promptly convened a national taskforce to support employees and the local communities affected.\n\n\u201cWe have asked the Insolvency Service to fast-track their investigation into the circumstances surrounding Thomas Cook going into liquidation.\u201d\n\nThomas Cook\u2019s auditor, EY, is under investigation by the accounting watchdog, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC).\n\nThe FRC said it would look at EY\u2019s audit of Thomas Cook\u2019s financial statements for the year ending 30 September 2018, adding that the probe could be broadened if required.\n\nThat could spell trouble for EY\u2019s Big Four rival, PricewaterhouseCoopers, which was Thomas Cook\u2019s auditor until 2016.\n\nAdditional reporting by PA", "description": "A union leader has called for ministers to be held to account for the loss of thousands of jobs and chaos for holidaymakers with the collapse of Thomas Cook.
