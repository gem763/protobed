It quoted a White House official who listened in on the call describing the meeting as \u201ccrazy,\u201d \u201cfrightening,\u201d and \u201ccompletely lacking in substance related to national security.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower added that the White House official was \u201cvisibly shaken by what had transpired,\u201d and as the New York Times reported, the official added that there was \u201calready a conversation underway with White House lawyers about how to handle the discussion because, in the official\u2019s view, the president had clearly committed a criminal act by urging a foreign power to investigate a U.S. person for the purposes of advancing his own re-election bid in 2020.\u201d\n\nThat July memo was shared with the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general, and ultimately, with members of Congress.\n\nThe president, not surprisingly, is aware of the latest reporting on this, and he published a series of tweets this morning intended to push back against the revelations. Trump\u2019s missives were absurd, but they helped capture something important: the Republican is stuck in the wrong conversation.\n\n\u201cThe Whistleblower\u2019s facts have been so incorrect about my \u201cno pressure\u201d conversation with the Ukrainian President, and now the conflict of interest and involvement with a Democrat Candidate, that he or she should be exposed and questioned properly. This is no Whistleblower. The Whistleblower\u2019s lawyer is a big Democrat. The Whistleblower has ties to one of my DEMOCRAT OPPONENTS. Why does the ICIG allow this scam to continue? \u201cThe so-called Whistleblower, before knowing I was going to release the exact Transcript, stated that my call with the Ukrainian President was \u2018crazy, frightening, and completely lacking in substance related to national security.\u2019 This is a very big Lie. Read the Transcript!\u201d\n\nThe president is clearly confused about basic details. Trump believes the whistleblower\u2019s account has been discredited, but that\u2019s not true. He also falsely attributed quotes to the whistleblower that actually came from a White House official. He also falsely suggested the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general can derail a congressional impeachment inquiry.\n\nBut what mattered most to me is the president\u2019s idea that he can tear down the whistleblower by alleging that he or she has \u201cties\u201d to a Democrat, is \u201cinvolved\u201d with a Democrat, and has a lawyer who\u2019s a Democrat.\n\nI have no idea who the whistleblower is and whether he or she has political \u201cties\u201d to one party or another. I also have no idea why it would matter.\n\nWhat we\u2019re dealing with is someone who learned of presidential wrongdoing and, in effect, pulled the fire alarm. It set in motion a series of developments that made clear that the fire was (and is) real: Trump tried to privately coerce a foreign government into helping his re-election campaign; he publicly urged another country to help his re-election campaign; there are texts documenting the scope of the scheme; and the White House tried to cover it all up.\n\nTrump has effectively been reduced to arguing, \u201cThe person who pulled the fire alarm may have had suspect motives.\u201d What the president doesn\u2019t seem to realize is that the person who pulled the fire alarm could\u2019ve been an ax murderer and it wouldn\u2019t make any difference.\n\nTrump\u2019s misdeeds have been exposed. The whistleblower\u2019s politics, or lack thereof, are completely irrelevant.", "description": "Trump has effectively been reduced to arguing, \"The person who pulled the fire alarm may have had suspect motives.\" That makes far less sense than he realizes.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/videos/n_tur_turablock_191008_1920x1080.jpg?itok=YkYu02u8", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
