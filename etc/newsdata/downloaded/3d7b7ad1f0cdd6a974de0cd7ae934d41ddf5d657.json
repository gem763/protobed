However, the New York Giants took Jones with the No. 6 overall pick, seeing him as an heir-apparent to veteran quarterback Eli Manning. On Thursday, Patriots head coach Bill Belichick will finally see Jones in action up-close when they take on the Giants at Gillette Stadium in Week 6.\n\nThe unbeaten Patriots (5-0) were installed as an early 16.5-point favorite over the Giants (2-3), who suffered their first loss in three games with Jones as starter. During his pre-Draft workouts with the Patriots, Jones impressed the team\u2019s coaching staff, led by Belichick.\n\n\u201cAgain, a good grasp of the offensive system\u2014protections, routes, route concepts and why they\u2019re used in different combinations and in certain situations,\u201d Belichick said of Jones, adding that the quarterback is also a very impressive person.\n\nBelichick expects Jones to show the same maturity, good football IQ and overall leadership when they collide on Thursday. In his first four games with the Giants, Jones has thrown for 760 yards and four touchdowns with three interceptions. He also ran for 78 yards and two scores for the Giants.\n\nBelichick will face Barkley for the first time\n\nAside from Jones, Belichick told Giants' reporters in a conference call that he\u2019s hoping that second-year rusher Saquon Barkley won\u2019t play Thursday.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the latest news!

NFL New England Patriots\n\nIt was reported that Barkley will be out for six weeks due to an ankle injury but the running back declared that he could come back and face the Patriots. While he\u2019s hoping that Barkley won\u2019t play on Thursday, Belichick said he will be ready for the dynamic rusher, whom he will face for the first time. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s either going to be back or is close to being back, so we have to be ready for him,\u201d said Belichick.\n\nIn an interview, Barkley said playing against veteran quarterback Tom Brady and the rest of the Patriots would be awesome. In three games this season, Barkley carried the ball 37 times for 237 yards and a touchdown.\n\nGiants to be shorthanded vs Patriots\n\nAccording to Michael McMahon of New England Sports Network (NESN), the Giants could be shorthanded when they take on the Patriots on Thursday. The Giants held a walkthrough on Monday, but if they practiced, some of their key offensive players won\u2019t be able to participate.\n\nAmong them were wide receiver Sterling Shepard (concussion), running back Wayne Gallman (concussion) and tight end Evan Engram (knee). Ian Rapoport of NFL Media said Shepard won\u2019t play against the Patriots because he was placed on concussion protocol on Monday. The Patriots are fresh from a 33-7 win over the Washington Redskins in Week 5, thanks to Brady's performance.", "description": "Belichick expects Jones to show the same maturity and overall leadership when they collide on Thursday.", "authors": ["Oliver Vandervoort", "Zeegee Cecilio", "Read More On The Same Topic Zeegee Cecilio", "Patriots Rumor", "Team Poised To Trade For Wide Receiver After Not Activating Ben Watson", "Patriots Heavy Favorite Over Giants", "Barkley Eager To Play Vs", "Best Nfl Team", "In Week", "Team Active In Trade Talks For Wideout"], "top_image": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2019/10/8/os/b_1200x630/belichick-will-face-barkley-for-the-first-time-if-the-latter-plays-on-thursday-image-credit-new-england-patriotsyoutube_2335843.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
