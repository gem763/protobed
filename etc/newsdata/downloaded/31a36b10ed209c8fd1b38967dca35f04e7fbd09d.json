He was only 3 years old in 1979, when he and his two brothers, father and grandmother fled the Ukraine, then a Soviet republic, for the U.S.\n\nOn Fox News on Tuesday night, Laura Ingraham was discussing Vindman's background and claimed his background was 'interesting'.\n\nMSNBC host Nicolle Wallace, (pictured), blasted Trump supporters for criticizing National Security Council official Alexander Vindman and called them 'chicken s**t'\n\nFox News host Laura Ingraham, (center) and ex-Bush Administration official John Yoo, (left), alluded to the fact that Vindman could be a double agent. New York attorney Alan Dershowitz, (right), was also on the discussion panel\n\nFox News host Laura Ingraham, ex-Bush Administration official John Yoo, alluded to the fact that Vindman could be a double agent. New York attorney Alan Dershowitz was also on the discussion panel.\n\nIngraham had claimed: 'Here we have a U.S. National Security official who is advising Ukraine while working inside the White House apparently against the President's interests, and usually they spoke in English.\n\n'Isn't that kind of an interesting angle on this story?' she asked.\n\nJohn Yoo then claimed that 'some people might call that espionage'. He later clarified his comments to say he wasn't accusing Vindman of espionage.\n\nMSNBC host Wallace then played that clip and stated: 'Except those people aren't chicken s**t like the three of you and they know he passed a background check that the president's daughter and son-in-law didn't.'\n\nFootage of the remark was posted on Twitter and users were quick to applaud the left-leaning presenter for her put-down.\n\nVindman's arrival in military blue, with medals, created a striking image as he entered the Capitol and made his way to the secure briefing room.\n\nTrump questions why people he's 'never even heard of' are testifying in the House Democrats' impeachment probe. Trump has denied doing anything wrong and has said the call with Ukraine's leader was 'perfect'.\n\nVindman told investigators Tuesday that he listened to Donald Trump's call with Ukraine's new president Volodymyr Zelensky and 'did not think it was proper' - potentially a huge boost to the Democrats' impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe president began his day on Twitter swinging at Vindman, an active-duty Army lieutenant colonel who was awarded a Purple Heart after being wounded in Iraq, saying he had 'never heard of' him but insisting he is a 'Never Trumper'.\n\nVindman, a 20-year Army officer and Purple Heart Veteran, testified that he twice raised concerns that President Donald Trump and his European Union ambassador, Gordon Sondland, inappropriately pushed Ukrainian leaders to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and son Hunter\n\nRudy Giuliani, Donald Trump's personal attorney, claimed earlier this month that Ukrainian gas company Burisma paid Joe Biden $900,000 in lobbying fees, citing documents released by a Ukrainian member of parliament. The two are pictured together\n\nThe White House also ordered the officer not to testify, prompting the House Intelligence Committee to issue a subpoena directing him to give evidence.\n\nHe is the first White House official to say he heard the July 25 telephone call between Trump and Zelensky that is at the center of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nVindman arrived at the Capitol wearing his dress uniform, displaying his Purple Heart and a series of other decorations for his service.\n\nHe was due to tell lawmakers he was a Ukrainian-born Jewish refugee who had lived 'the American dream' by serving his country in combat and as a diplomat.\n\nTrump vented just before Lt. Col. Vindman arrived that that a transcript of the call makes it clear he did nothing wrong, and that Vindman is an unimportant figure who never crossed paths with him.\n\nMSNBC host Wallace said of the Trump loyalists: 'Except those people aren't chickens**t like the three of you and they know he passed a background check that the president's daughter and son-in-law didn't\n\n'Why are people that I never even heard of testifying about the call. Just READ THE CALL TRANSCRIPT AND THE IMPEACHMENT HOAX IS OVER! Ukrain [sic] said NO PRESSURE,' Trump tweeted.\n\nBut calling Vindman a 'Never Trumper' came as pro-Trump pundits were attacked by other Republicans for questioning Lt. Col Vindman's patriotism, with one Fox News commentator going as far as to accuse him of 'espionage' against the president.\n\nTrump followed up his social media outrage with a string of retweets of congressional allies calling the entire impeachment inquiry illegitimate because of its secretive and one-sided beginning.\n\nIn his opening statement, first published by The New York Times, Vindman claimed the National Security Council proposed that Trump call President Zelensky to congratulate him after his party won parliamentary elections.\n\nHe explained: 'On July 25, 2019, the call occurred. I listened in on the call in the Situation Room with colleagues from the NSC and the office of the Vice President.\n\n'As the transcript is in the public record, we are all aware of what was said. I was concerned by the call. I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government's support of Ukraine.\n\n'I realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma, it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained.'\n\nBurisma Holdings is the Ukrainian energy company where Biden's son Hunter held a lucrative board seat while his father was vice president.\n\nVindman arrived at the Capitol on Tuesday wearing his dress uniform, displaying his Purple Heart and a series of other decorations for his service\n\nU.S. House Intelligence Committee Chair Rep.

Alexander Vindman, director for European Affairs at the National Security Council, as part of the U.S. House of Representatives impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump\n\n'I realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma, it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained.\n\nVindman claimed: 'This would all undermine U.S. national security. Following the call, I again reported my concerns to NSC's lead counsel.'\n\nVindman served multiple overseas tours, including South Korea and Germany, and was deployed to Iraq for combat operations. He was wounded in an IED attack and was subsequently awarded a Purple Heart.\n\nHe served in United States' embassies in Kiev, Ukraine and Moscow, Russia. In Washington, D.C., he was a politico-military affairs officer for Russia for the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff before his appointment to the NSC.\n\nVindman told the committee that he is not the whistle-blower who brought the issue to the CIA and the Committees' attention. He also claimed he never had direct contact or communications with the President.\n\nThe Trump campaign has alleged that Biden quashed a Ukrainian investigation into Burisma, where Biden's son Hunter served on the board from 2014 until earlier this year, using the threat of withholding U.S. foreign aid.\n\nBiden has denied any wrongdoing, and Trump's phone call to the Ukrainian president asking him to look into the matter is at the heart of House Democrats' mounting impeachment probe into Trump.\n\nRudy Giuliani, Donald Trump's personal attorney, claimed earlier this month that Ukrainian gas company Burisma paid Joe Biden $900,000 in lobbying fees, citing documents released by a Ukrainian member of parliament.\n\n'Biden, his son and his brother had a 30-year-long scam to make money, millions, selling his public office,' Giuliani said in an interview on Wednesday night with Fox News host Sean Hannity.\n\nThe interview with Giuliani was just hours after Biden backed the impeachment of Trump for the first time.\n\n'Senator first, vice president second. Ukraine, just the tip of the iceberg,' Giuliani continued.", "description": "MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace blasted Trump supporters who accused Alexander Vindman of espionage after he said he  had concerns about Donald Trump's call with Volodymr Zelensky.", "authors": ["Leah Mcdonald For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/22/20349210-0-image-a-21_1572389265784.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
