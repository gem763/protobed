But the Pelicans didn\u2019t have a very good front office, and so while the plan was obvious, Dell Demps\u2019 execution was lacking. Particularly when it came to shooting, New Orleans always failed.\n\nBut now David Griffin is in charge and the Pelicans are looking forward. However, they are without Davis, who is with the Los Angeles Lakers. Ironically enough \u2014 and not just because of the assets gained in return from L.A. \u2014 the Pelicans have a much better roster these days than the Lakers.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nStill, that hasn\u2019t stopped Davis from waxing poetic about not having to do everything the way he did in prior seasons in Louisiana. Speaking to Dave McMenamin this week, Davis said he was happy that other players were there to shoulder the load.\n\nVia ESPN:\n\n\u201cIt takes a load off me,\u201d Davis said after the Lakers\u2019 126-93 win \u2014 their third victory in three tries against the Warriors this preseason. \u201cIt feels good knowing that you don\u2019t have to do much. Everybody has a role, and when you have guys all over the board who can score the basketball, you don\u2019t need to do everything every possession.\u201d\n\nOf course, this isn\u2019t even remotely true. Los Angeles doesn\u2019t have that many players who can score the basketball, and outside of LeBron James, Davis will actually need to do quite a bit to keep possessions going.\n\nL.A.\u2019s problem will be depth and shooting, very similar to the last several years that Davis spent in New Orleans. Meanwhile, the Pelicans have lots of new, good players, including Zion Williamson. They also have JJ Redick, one of the best shooters in NBA history.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt\u2019s nice that Davis feels as though he is finally being supported, but the reality is probably much different. Him trying to compliment the Lakers while taking a swing at the Pelicans, even though Demps is no longer with the organization, is sort of clumsy. There\u2019s ways for Davis to ingratiate himself with Lakers fans without alienating his legacy in New Orleans, and this ain\u2019t it.", "description": "Davis tried to compliment the Lakers while clumsily taking a swing at Dell Demps.", "authors": ["Dane Delgado"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/mxRxrqhQLNrFA8DT9xHkRQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjIuMDUxMjgyMDUxMjgyMQ--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/JdqjOz0CI4DmvsFZIbcMHQ--~B/aD01NTA7dz05NzU7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/0f3102bfcfeaa361c400f55d3cb227fd", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
