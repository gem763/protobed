Now Asia has eye-watering prices", "language": "en", "text": "MUMBAI/DHAKA (Reuters) - From Kathmandu to Colombo, it\u2019s a kitchen nightmare: Onion prices have gone crazy.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A vendor reads newspaper as he waits for customers at a wholesale onion market in Kolkata, India, November 21, 2016. REUTERS/Rupak De Chowdhuri/File Photo\n\nThat\u2019s because India, the world\u2019s biggest seller of the Asian diet staple, has banned exports after extended Monsoon downpours delayed harvests and supplies shrivelled. And dedicated buyers across the region, like Nepalese housewife Seema Pokharel, are flummoxed.\n\n\u201cThis is a terrible increase,\u201d said Pokharel, out shopping for vegetables in Kathmandu. \u201cOnion prices have more than doubled in the last month alone.\u201d\n\nWhether it\u2019s Pakistani chicken curry, Bangladeshi biryani or Indian sambar, Asian consumers have developed a serious dependence on Indian onion supplies for go-to dishes. Shorter shipment times than from rival exporters like China or Egypt play a crucial role in preserving the taste of the perishable commodity.\n\nBut last Sunday New Delhi banned all exports from India after local prices jumped to 4,500 rupees ($63.30) per 100 kg, their highest in nearly six years, due to the delay in summer-sown crop arrivals triggered by longer, heavier rains than usual.\n\nSince the ban, countries such as Bangladesh have turned to the likes of Myanmar, Egypt, Turkey and China to increase supplies in a bid bring prices down, government officials and traders said.\n\nBut the hefty volumes lost will be hard to replace.\n\nIndia exported 2.2 million tonnes of fresh onions in the 2018/19 fiscal year ended March 31, according to data from India\u2019s Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority. That\u2019s more than half of all imports by Asian countries, traders estimate.\n\n\u2018TAKING ADVANTAGE\u2019\n\nRising prices of alternative supplies will add to the headache for importers trying to get the vegetable from elsewhere, said Mohammad Idris, a trader based in Dhaka. In the Bangladesh capital, consumers are now being asked to pay 120 taka ($1.42) per kilogramme for their prized onions - twice the price a fortnight ago and the highest since December, 2013.\n\n\u201cPrices are going up elsewhere in Asia and Europe,\u201d said Idris. \u201cOther exporting countries are taking advantage of the Indian ban\u201d to raise their asking price.\n\nIn response to the crisis, the government of Bangladesh has initiated sales of subsidised onions through the state-run Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB).\n\n\u201cWe are looking for all possible options to import onions. Our target is to import in the shortest possible time,\u201d said TCB spokesman Humayun Kabir.\n\nBut the shipments from elsewhere - Iran and Turkey are also potential suppliers - that authorities in countries across the region are investigating will all take time.\n\n\u201cIt takes one month when it comes from Egypt and about 25 days from China, while it takes only a few days from India,\u201d said Dhaka trader Idris.\n\nThe need for alternative imports is so severe, though, that countries like Sri Lanka have already placed orders with Egypt and China, said G Rajendran, president of the Essential Food Commodities, Importers and Traders Association.\n\nOnion prices in Sri Lanka have risen by 50% in a week, to 280-300 Sri Lankan rupees ($1.7) per kilogramme.\n\n\u2018DOUBLE THE PRICE\u2019\n\nFor other countries, there may be little option but to sit tight and hope for the best.\n\nMalaysia, the second-biggest buyer of Indian onions, expects the ban to be temporary and sees no reason to panic, said Sim Tze Tzin, deputy minister of agriculture.\n\nBut even India has been importing onions from Egypt in an effort to calm prices. And there won\u2019t be any meaningful drop in prices before summer-sown crops start to hit the market, said Ajit Shah, president of the Mumbai-based Onion Exporters\u2019 Association.\n\nThat\u2019s not expected until mid-November, meaning the export ban isn\u2019t going away in the near term.\n\n\u201cIndia could resume exports once prices drop, but it will take time,\u201d said Shah. \u201cUntil India resumes exports, supplies will remain limited in Asia.\u201d\n\nFor now, consumers like Kathmandu shopper Pokharel are having to change habits across Asia.\n\n\u201cI went to buy 5 kilogrammes of onions for our five-member family but ended up buying only 3 kilogrammes due to higher prices,\u201d said Afroza Mimi, a Dhaka housewife on a shopping expedition the day after India imposed the export ban.\n\n\u201cThey (traders) are selling old stock nearly at double the price. This is crazy.\u201d\n\nFILE PHOTO: A cook fries onions to put into vegetable chowmein at a beachside restaurant in Mumbai, India, January 28, 2011.
