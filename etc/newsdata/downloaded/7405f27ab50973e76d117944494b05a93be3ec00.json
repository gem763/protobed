He said in a statement: \u201cIt is clear that these drivers are the targets of perpetrators who are robbing them of their money and cellphones, and in some instances even their vehicles.\n\n\u201cThe drivers are called to pick up their customers and after the customers are picked up they are being robbed.\u201d\n\nGavin Walburgh, chairperson of the Steenberg Community Policing Forum (CPF), told People\u2019s Post: \u201cIn the Steenberg precinct we have had a spike in Uber and Taxify robberies, then a decline and then a slight increase again recently \u2013 and that is very worrying. It doesn\u2019t seem to be happening in any one specific area so we can\u2019t identify the group of perpetrators.\u201d\n\nUber and Taxify, as cheaper and supposedly safer alternatives to minibus taxis, have repeatedly come under attack since their inceptions in South Africa. Initially, these service providers came under threat due to low tariffs and drivers were fearful for their lives after many had been beaten or otherwise attacked while on duty.\n\nNow in Steenberg, the prevalence of robberies has been on the rise \u2013 with both drivers and passengers who are waiting for their drivers being attacked.\n\nWhile the groups of perpetrators are not yet known, there is hope.\n\nWalburgh said that Steenberg police have made a few arrests in connection with these robberies.\n\nTwigg urged transport users to be more aware of their surroundings, especially when travelling during peak hours, in order to prevent these crimes from occurring.\n\nWalburgh added to that advice: \u201cDon\u2019t use cash. If they are cash clients, drivers should rethink picking up these clients. I would advise these drivers to use card services rather than cash.\u201d", "description": "Steenberg police are warning passenger transport services to be careful when entering the area, due to the rise in crimes committed against drivers and clients recently.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://graph.facebook.com/10227041841/picture", "published_at": "2019-06-25"}
