They have natural flair and outstanding talent but it is their relentless desire to keep working and show courage in those difficult moments that makes them catch the eye.\n\nFabinho was the fulcrum of Liverpool's drive during their comeback victory over Tottenham\n\nTake Alisson. During his eight-week absence with a torn calf, Adrian San Miguel proved to be an able deputy and enjoyed some time in the limelight, with his save in the penalty shootout against Chelsea that enabled Liverpool to win the European Super Cup. He is good \u2013 but he is not Alisson.\n\nLiverpool\u2019s play improves by 10 per cent when Alisson is in goal.\n\nHe uses the ball like a midfielder and his ability to launch attacks with precision passes increases the speed with which his team can attack but Klopp sanctioned his \u00a364.6million signing from Roma for big contributions in his own goal.\n\nIn the 48th minute, big was the right word. A long punt from Spurs keeper Paulo Gazzaniga found its way through to Heung-min Son, who skipped away from Dejan Lovren.\n\nAlisson Becker spread himself wide to push Son away from goal to shoot from a narrow angle\n\nThe goalkeeper improves Liverpool's performances by 10 per cent and is irreplaceable\n\nHe bore down on the Anfield Road net but Alisson made his frame so imposing that Son could only shoot against the bar.\n\nHad the outstanding South Korean\u2019s effort been a fraction lower, 2-0 to Tottenham would have been a long way back for Liverpool. Instead, the reprieve was huge.\n\nFrom there, Fabinho took over and his performance in the middle of midfield was huge.\n\nLike his compatriots, Fabinho likes the quiet life. He doesn\u2019t do many interviews and his command of English isn\u2019t total but the polished way he plays always makes sense. He was Liverpool\u2019s fulcrum, a scurrying and snapping presence, who won countless tackles and never misplaced a pass.\n\nRoberto Firmino hurried about the pitch all evening and put Harry Winks under pressure\n\nHis ball in the 53rd minute gave Jordan Henderson the opportunity to score an equaliser but the point you knew the game had changed completely was in the 57th minute when Firmino, the workaholic centre forward, pounced out of the shadows near the touchline to mug Harry Winks.\n\nSo good was the tackle, Klopp turned to the Main Stand and waved his fists in the air, hollering his noisy appreciation.\n\nIt gave a new twist to the phrase \u2018samba style\u2019 but it was certainly infectious. If Liverpool are to go all the way this year, the Boys from Brazil will provide the blend.", "description": "DOMINIC KING AT ANFIELD: It\u00a0was in a 10 minutes spell, just after half-time, that Anfield became the Kopacabana and Jurgen Klopp was roaring his delight.", "authors": ["Dominic King For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/10/20274398-0-image-a-4_1572258078676.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
