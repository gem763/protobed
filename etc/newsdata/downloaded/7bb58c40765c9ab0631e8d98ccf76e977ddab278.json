(BAX) fell more than 9% on Thursday after the company said it had launched an internal investigation into misstatements involving foreign-exchange transactions.\n\nThe Deerfield, Ill., medical-products company said the transactions, which occurred between different parts of Baxter, were done to generate foreign-exchange gains or losses and used a method that didn't comply with generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nBaxter said it has informed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of the investigation, which covers transactions dating back to at least 2014, and said it doesn't expect to file its third-quarter report with the agency on a timely basis.\n\nShares of Baxter were recently down 9.1%, to $79.96.\n\nWrite to Colin Kellaher at colin.kellaher@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 24, 2019 10:21 ET (14:21 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
