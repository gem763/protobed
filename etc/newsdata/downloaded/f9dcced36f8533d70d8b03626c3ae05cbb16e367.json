Some signs of progress were emerging.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re looking at is brewing central-bank divergence,\u201d said Chris Weston, head of research at brokerage Pepperstone Group in Melbourne. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to see signs of that resonating in currency markets.\u201d\n\nSterling was the biggest gainer.
