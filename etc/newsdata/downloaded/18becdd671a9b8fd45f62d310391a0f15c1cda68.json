I hate it.\u201d\n\nTrump spoke about the process after presiding over a signing event for the new United States and Japan trade deal at the White House.\n\n\u201cWe make each letter different, each person is different, and we make them personal but no matter what you do it\u2019s devastating,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe parents will never be the same, the families will never be the same.\u201d\n\nThe president spoke about the ongoing wars in the Middle East, reminding critics of his foreign policy that he campaigned on to bring the troops home.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been there for many many many years, beyond of what we were supposed to be,\u201d he said. \u201cNot fighting. Just there. Just there.
