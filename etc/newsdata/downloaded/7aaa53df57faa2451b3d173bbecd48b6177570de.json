His rent was always paid, along with other utilities, and he would see me weekly.\"\n\nShe added: \"Anthony is at rest now and will not suffer anymore pain.\n\n\"The really sad thing is that it cost me almost the same amount of money to pay for his death that it would have to have private dental treatment.\"\n\nMr Hoskin was found dead in his flat April 3 by police who had broken in after his mum raised concerns about his welfare.\n\nPC Simon Collins told the hearing at Winchester Coroner's Court police had been called by Mrs Hoskins who said she had not heard from him for a couple of days and he had gone home from work with an illness the previous week.\n\nA bank receipt found in the address showed Mr Hoskins was overdrawn by \u00a33,000.\n\nThe inquest heard he was often asking for overtime at work in the weeks prior to his death.\n\nA statement from Dr Gabriella Day, of Burgess Road Surgery, said Mr Hoskins had last visited the practice in August 2018 with a tooth ache complaint.\n\nA post mortem examination was carried out by pahologist Dr Eleanor Jaynes, who provided a cause of death as hanging.\n\nActing area coroner Samantha Marsh recorded a conclusion of suicide.\n\nThe Samaritans is available 24/7 if you need to talk.
