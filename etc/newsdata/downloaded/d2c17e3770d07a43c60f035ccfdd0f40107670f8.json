We are sorry that we did not see these clips earlier, and that our vetting process was not up to our standard.\u201d\n\n[A new cast member\u2019s racist comments puts SNL in the center of latest comedy storm]\n\nGillis responded on Twitter. \u201cOf course I wanted an opportunity to prove myself at SNL, but I understand it would be too much of a distraction,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI respect the decision they made. I\u2019m honestly grateful for the opportunity.\u201d\n\nMichaels\u2019s spokesperson said that Gillis was hired \u201con the strength of his talent as a comedian\u201d and his audition. \u201cWe want SNL to have a variety of voices and points of view within the show.\u201d\n\nSNL also added two other featured performers last week: Bowen Yang, who was widely celebrated as the show\u2019s first cast member of East Asian descent, and Chloe Fineman. But hours after the casting announcement, freelance comedy journalist Seth Simons called attention to a 2018 episode of \u201cMatt and Shane\u2019s Secret Podcast\u201d in which Gillis and co-host Matt McCusker used slurs against Chinese people, mocking their accents and making racist references to Chinatown. (All of the episodes have been scrubbed from the podcast\u2019s YouTube channel.)\n\nGillis initially addressed the mounting backlash by tweeting that he is a \u201ccomedian who pushes boundaries. Sometimes I miss.\u201d He added he was \u201chappy to apologize to anyone who\u2019s actually been offended by anything I\u2019ve said.\u201d\n\nGillis, who is from Mechanicsburg, Pa., was unknown to a broad national audience before last week, but his star was rising: Over the summer, he performed in showcases for Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cUp Next\u201d and the Just For Laughs comedy festival.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time an SNL hire has caused controversy. Melissa Villase\u00f1or, who will begin her third season when the show returns Sept. 28, was criticized in 2016 after social media users uncovered years-old tweets with questionable humor about race. The show never publicly addressed it.\n\nIn this case, the offending language was recent, and it came not in a tweet or a stand-up set but on a podcast, where the line between joke material and casual conversation can seem blurrier to the public.\n\nThe debate over SNL\u2019s hiring choice raised questions about the show\u2019s vetting process. It also came amid a broader conversation about \u201ccancel culture,\u201d and in what ways comedians should be held accountable for offensive material.\n\nVice reported Friday that Gillis had used an anti-Semitic and racist slur to describe Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang in May while appearing as a guest on another podcast. \u201cI prefer comedy that makes people think and doesn\u2019t take cheap shots,\u201d the entrepreneur responded on Twitter, but said he didn\u2019t think Gillis should lose his newly announced SNL job over the remark.\n\nNot everyone agreed, including some fellow comedians. \u201cAs a comedian I usually side with the comedians on sensitive subjects. But this is just plain racist,\u201d tweeted comedian Jimmy O. Yang. \u201cStanding up against this is just as important as supporting our Asian brothers and sisters. This man has to go.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nHow we ended up vetting celebrities as carefully as politicians\n\nThe weird ways people have been fired from \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019", "description": "The comedian, who was announced Thursday as a featured player for Season 45, was criticized for using slurs against Asians and the LGBT community in recent podcast episodes.", "authors": ["Elahe Izadi", "Pop Culture Writer", "Bethonie Butler", "Reporter Covering Television", "Pop Culture", "September At Pm", "Elahe Izadi Is A Pop Culture Writer For The Washington Post.
