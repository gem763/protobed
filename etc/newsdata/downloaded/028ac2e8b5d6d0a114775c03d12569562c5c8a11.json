But incumbent forces continue to keep coal afloat.\n\nWhere it stands: Despite progress from global insurance companies \u2014 including stricter limits on coal from Europe\u2019s third-largest insurer \u2014 U.S. insurance companies remain out of line with emerging global standards: AIG, Chubb, Berkshire Hathaway, and Liberty Mutual rank last in reducing their exposure to coal, even as costs associated with wildfires and hurricanes keep growing. Thus far, the only U.S. company to distance itself from coal is the Silicon Valley\u2013backed startup Lemonade.\n\nBetween the lines: U.S. insurance companies clearly don't see climate change as a major risk to their bottom lines. As global insurers exit the coal sector, their U.S. counterparts are effectively offering a lifeline to new coal projects that align with the Trump administration\u2019s energy policies.\n\nYes, but: As long as customers don't default on their premiums, insurers (like other suppliers) will benefit from selling services to a sector that's losing its competitiveness. This will change only once insurers start to lose other customers because of reputational harm.\n\nWhat to watch: Last year was the second costliest since 1970 for insurers, hitting $337 billion, 73% of which was from Gulf Coast hurricanes and California wildfires. U.S. insurers may either raise consumer premiums, passing on the cost of extreme weather to consumers, or decline to insure people in risk-prone areas.\n\nJustin Guay directs global climate strategy at the Sunrise Project and advises the ClimateWorks Foundation.", "description": "For now, they seem not to consider climate change a threat to their bottom lines.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/Q2JIuhQiv9SHHL_sV-cJtbDm_ks=/0x349:3000x2037/1920x1080/2018/12/04/1543943716414.jpg", "published_at": "2018-12-05"}
