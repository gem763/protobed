The disease kills more than 400,000 people a year, the vast majority of them babies and children in the poorest parts of Africa.\n\n\"In the history of mankind, it's been estimated that malaria has been responsible for more human deaths than any other disease,\" said Gavin Wright, who co-led the work.\n\n\"So it is both important and fascinating to understand the molecular pathways that enabled this deadly parasite to infect humans.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Kate Kelland and Stuart McDill, editing by Cynthia Osterman)", "description": "Scientists who resurrected a 50,000-year-old gene sequence have analyzed it to figure out how the world's deadliest malaria parasite jumped from gorillas to humans - giving insight into the origins of one of human history's biggest killers.
