I just feel like it\u2019s time we stood up and said, \u2018We are ginger, and we are going to fight.\u2019\"\n\nHarry then steps in to correct him, saying, \"This is slightly awkward,\" before letting Sheeran know he wanted to talk about World Mental Health Day.\n\n\"Yeah of course,\" Sheeran replies, as the camera moves to show him deleting the phrase \"GINGERS UNITE\" from his laptop.\n\nHarry and Sheeran then appear side-by-side with a more serious message on mental health.\n\n\"Guys, this World Mental Health Day, reach out, make sure that your friends, strangers, look out for anybody that might be suffering in silence,\" Harry said directly to the camera. \"We\u2019re all in this together.\"\n\nsussexroyal/Instagram\n\nThe video was shared on the @SussexRoyal Instagram account Harry shares with his wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex.\n\nThe post includes links to more than one dozen accounts for mental health and support and the caption, \"Both Prince Harry and Ed Sheeran want to ensure that not just today but every day, you look after yourself, your friends and those around you. There\u2019s no need to suffer in silence - share how you\u2019re feeling, ask how someone is doing and listen for the answer. Be willing to ask for help when you need it and know that we are all in this together.\"\n\nHarry recently joined Meghan and his brother and sister-in-law, Prince William and Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, in narrating a short PSA for a new mental health initiative in the U.K. called Every Mind Matters.\n\nThe royals have been outspoken advocates of increasing mental health awareness and breaking the stigma of mental health since launching Heads Together in May 2016.\n\nWilliam and Harry have spoken very candidly since then about the loss of their mother, Princess Diana, in 1997 and how it has affected their mental health in the years since.\n\n\"I have probably been very close to a complete breakdown on numerous occasions when all sorts of grief and sort of lies and misconceptions and everything are coming to you from every angle,\" Harry said in a 2017 interview in which he credited William with encouraging him to seek help. \"For me personally, my brother, you know, bless him, he was a huge support to me. He kept saying, 'This is not right, this is not normal, you need to talk to [someone] about stuff, it's OK.'\"\n\nHarry and Meghan have also made talking about mental health a focus of their first two official overseas tours as a couple, in Australia last year and in South Africa this month.\n\nThe couple joined surfers in Cape Town, South Africa, on Sept. 24 to talk about mental health, revealing they both practice meditation to help keep their mental health strong.", "description": "Harry recently narrated a mental health PSA along with William, Kate and Meghan.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/ed-harry-ht-ml-191010_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
