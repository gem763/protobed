In particular, the is down almost 500 pips since July 22nd. Fundamentally, this move is primarily due to fears of the trade war between the US-China. Because New Zealand is so heavily dependent on China to buy its products, fears are that a slowdown in China would mean a slowdown in New Zealand. Earlier in August, the Royal Bank of New Zealand surprised the market by cutting interest rates 50bps (a 25bps cut was expected). At the time, RBNZ\u2019s Orr noted that \u201cnothing is off the table\u201d, referring to the possibility of interest rates moving lower.\n\nThis weekend could be a big tell as to what the RBNZ may do at their next meeting.

After that, the pair can bounce up towards 0.6500, which are prior lows that now act as resistance.\n\nOriginal Post", "description": "Forex Analysis by City Index (Matt Simpson) covering: NZD/USD.
