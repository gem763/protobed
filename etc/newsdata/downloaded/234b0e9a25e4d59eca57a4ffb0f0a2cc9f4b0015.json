They are saving 20% or more of their paychecks, investing in 401(k) accounts, and keeping their debt levels low. But others, even those with good educations and solid careers, are making financial mistakes. And some are making them over and over, digging a hole from which it may take years to climb out.\n\nMillennials can help themselves over the long term by avoiding several key errors. As a wealth adviser by trade, and more importantly, as someone actually of this generation who has personally gone toe to toe with many of the financial challenges often faced by millennials today, here are the 10 most common millennial money mistakes I've witnessed:\n\nWritten by Tom Presley, a Partner and Wealth Adviser at Brightworth who focuses his time on developing and implementing comprehensive financial strategies for high net worth and high income earning individuals.

This thinking is dangerous because as we grow older, our lives often become more expensive.\n\nTo get ahead financially, you don't need to live within your means; you need to live beneath your means. When you get a bonus, a raise or a promotion, take advantage of the additional income and at least partially increase your savings -- not just your lifestyle. Finding a way to save a little each month is really how to get ahead and make financial progress toward your goals.", "description": "Many millennial households are on their way to building substantial wealth.
