FOREX-Dollar treads water before Fed, sterling steadies on looming election\n\n* All eyes on Fed's policy decision due later Wednesday\n\n* UK to hold general election on Dec 12 to break Brexit\n\ndeadlock\n\n* US-China deal may not be ready for signing at APEC\n\nsummit:source\n\n* Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh\n\nBy Tomo Uetake\n\nTOKYO, Oct 30 (Reuters) - The dollar traded narrowly as\n\nmarkets braced for a rate cut by the Federal Reserve later on\n\nWednesday, while sterling steadied after Britain's lower house\n\nof parliament approved calling an early election in December\n\nthat might break the Brexit deadlock.\n\nThe dollar was steady against the euro at $1.1110 and\n\nflat versus a basket of six major currencies at 97.698 as\n\ninvestors awaited the Fed's interest rate decision.\n\nAgainst the yen, the greenback was also little moved at\n\n108.84 yen , not far from its three-month high of 109.07\n\nyen touched on Tuesday.\n\nThe U.S. central bank is expected to cut its policy rate for\n\na third time in a row when it concludes its two-day meeting on\n\nWednesday.\n\nAfter lowering interest rates in July and September, the\n\ncentral bank was expected to cut again by 25 basis points,\n\ntaking the fed funds rate to 1.50%-1.75%, a Reuters poll of\n\neconomists found. Another cut is forecast for early next year,\n\ntaking the rate to 1.25%-1.50%, with no more changes expected\n\nfor the rest of 2020. \"With a cut today completely priced in, markets are looking\n\nto the Fed's stance on its policy outlook,\" said Masahiro\n\nIchikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui DS Asset\n\nManagement.\n\nInvestors are watching for any indication that further cuts\n\nare likely, with futures pricing suggesting more easing is\n\nexpected in 2020. If that is not foreshadowed, traders expect\n\nthe dollar to rise.\n\n\"If the market is going to price in the end of current\n\nrate-cut cycle, the dollar/yen could climb above 110 yen,\" said\n\nTohru Sasaki, head of Japan rates and FX research at JPMorgan.\n\n\"On the other hand, if the market is going to price in two\n\nmore cuts after this month's expected cut, the pair could fall\n\nto mid-107 yen level,\" he added.\n\nOptimism that Washington and Beijing would finalise the\n\nfirst-stage of a trade deal next month had boosted risk assets\n\nin recent days, but markets turned wary on the prospect this\n\ncould be delayed.\n\nA U.S. administration official said on Tuesday an interim\n\ntrade agreement between the United States and China might not be\n\ncompleted in time for signing on the sidelines of an\n\nAsia-Pacific summit in Chile next month, but that does not mean\n\nthe accord is falling apart. Meanwhile, hopes that a disorderly Brexit can still be\n\navoided supported the pound.\n\nBritain will hold its first December election in almost a\n\ncentury after Prime Minister Boris Johnson won approval from the\n\nlower house of parliament on Tuesday for an early ballot aimed\n\nat breaking the deadlock over the UK leaving the European\n\nUnion. The bill calling for a Dec.12 election now goes to the\n\nHouse of Lords for approval. On Monday, the EU agreed to a three-month flexible delay to\n\nBritain's departure. Before settling back, the pound climbed as high as $1.2903\n\novernight on news that an election date was likely to be agreed.\n\n\"Sterling has struggled to hold onto modest knee-jerk gains\n\nbecause the outcome of an election is highly uncertain,\" said\n\nRay Attrill, head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank.\n\nWhile Johnson seeks to gain a parliamentary majority to\n\nratify his Brexit deal, the outcome of the election remains\n\nunpredictable, with large numbers of voters fatigued and enraged\n\nby the Brexit process over the past three years. Both major\n\nparties, the ruling Conservatives and opposition Labour, have\n\nsuffered an erosion of support among their traditional\n\nvote-banks.\n\nSterling last stood at $1.2865 GBP=D4 .\n\nElsewhere, Chinese yuan inched up marginally as investors\n\nawaited the outcome of the Fed meeting and more clarity on how\n\nSino-U.S. trade negotiations are going.\n\nIn the spot market, onshore spot yuan CNY=CFXS was last\n\nchanging hands at 7.0650, 25 pips firmer than the previous late\n\nsession close.\n\nPrior to market opening, the People's Bank of China (PBOC)\n\nset the midpoint rate CNY=PBOC at a two-month high of 7.0582\n\nper dollar, 35 pips firmer than Tuesday's fix.", "description": "FOREX-Dollar treads water before Fed, sterling steadies on looming election", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEE9A19C_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
