Schumer laid the blame for inaction on gun reform squarely on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and President Trump.\n\n\u201cTwo people in Washington can make sure that background checks will pass: Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell,\u201d Mr. Schumer said. \u201cIt\u2019s totally up to them \u2014 totally up to them \u2014 and it\u2019s on their shoulders.\u201d\n\nThey specifically called out the president for appearing to enthusiastically support passing legislation on background checks in recent weeks before wavering.\n\nIn a letter to Mr. Trump, Mrs. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer urged him to intervene and buck GOP \u201cfealty\u201d to the National Rifle Association, arguing the rest of the GOP would follow his lead.\n\n\u201cYou now have a historic opportunity to save lives simply by indicating your support for H.R. 8, the House-passed universal bipartisan background check legislation currently being blocked by Leader McConnell and the Republican majority in the Senate,\u201d they wrote.\n\nA string of mass shootings in Texas, Ohio and Virginia during the August recess renewed the drawn-out battle over gun control.\n\nDayton, Ohio, Mayor Nan Whaley, whose community lost nine people in an Aug. 4 mass shooting, joined the Democrats calling for the Senate to vote on the House\u2019s background check bill.\n\nThe bill in question would expand the current system, which covers gun transactions involving licensed dealers, to include nearly all trades, sales or gifts.\n\nIt initially passed the House in February, with only eight Republicans supporting it, and has been stalled in the Senate ever since.\n\nDemocrats are also set to consider a handful of other gun control provisions later this week in the Judiciary committee.\n\nMr. McConnell has said that he won\u2019t take up any gun bill that he knows the president won\u2019t support.\n\nDespite the apparent stalemate, Democrats are confident that public pressure will help sway Republican senators.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t anyone in this institution or anyone else in public life whose political survival is more important than the survival of our children,\u201d Mrs. Pelosi said. \u201cWe are not taking \u2018no\u2019 for an answer. We are not going away.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
