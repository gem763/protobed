It seems like I\u2019m seeing a couple comics going \u2018You know what? Enough of this shit. I\u2019m doing my thing and let the chips fall where they may,'\u201d Murphy said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where I\u2019m coming from,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m not planning to step on nobody\u2019s foot or get in some controversy or turn over the applecart. I\u2019m just going to be Eddie. Whatever comes out, that\u2019s what it\u2019s going to be.\u201d\n\nMurphy \u2014 who dominated the comedy movie world in the 80s and 90s with classic films like 48 Hours, Trading Places, and Beverly Hills Cop \u2014 cited stand-up comedian Dave Chappelle for embracing edgy jokes.\n\n\u201cI want to see what\u2019s in me. I want to see what comes out. And I see what\u2019s going on, so I know there are parameters. You\u2019ve got to eggshell it in certain areas,\u201d Murphy said. \u201c(Dave) Chappelle has some new stuff out that\u2019s edgy, and I see a couple of other comics doing stuff that\u2019s edgy.\u201d\n\nMurphy told the AP that he gave up stand-up comedy two decades ago amid protests over his 1980s act, prompting him to issue a statement apologizing for jokes about AIDS.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t getting the kick that I would usually get from it. I started feeling like there\u2019s a pressure. People had an expectation,\u201d Murphy said.\n\n\u201cA lot of it was controversial. I\u2019d get picketed. They started being on my act. If I said something it would be in the newspaper. I just wanted to tell some jokes. They were reading too much into it. I was like, You know what? How about I just go do \u2018Dr. Doolittle.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe AP said Murphy will return to stand-up with a tour next year, along with a Netflix special. \u201cThe muscle that always came up with jokes, I never stopped using that muscle,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the core, I\u2019m a funny person. I\u2019m a funny guy.\u201d\n\nMurphy was speaking the the AP about his role in the new Netflix movie Dolemite Is My Name, a biopic of performer Rudy Ray Moore.\n\nThe movie marks the latest comeback for Murphy, who is set to star in the sequel Coming 2 America. He is also scheduled to host Saturday Night Live in December, marking his return to the show after being a cast member during the 80s.\n\nComedians including Jerry Seinfeld, Chris Rock, and Marlon Wayans have publicly spoken out against what is often referred to as \u201ccancel culture,\u201d where left-wing political activists in conjunction with the mainstream media apply social media pressure to get their targets and adversaries fired.\n\nFollow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg.
