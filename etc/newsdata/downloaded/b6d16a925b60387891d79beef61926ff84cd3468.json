In the eyes of many liberals Donald Trump's behaviour has been worthy of his removal for a while, but proving it has been difficult.\n\nOn Thursday, the president basically loaded the bullet himself and fired off a quip about China investigating Joe Biden and his son Hunter that likely left the surrounding press pack smelling cordite.\n\nQuestioned whether he had asked China's President Xi Jinping about starting an investigation into the conduct of the Bidens \u2013 of which no evidence of wrongdoing has yet been presented \u2013 Trump replied that he hadn't but that it's \"certainly something we can start thinking about\".\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

In Trump's eyes a quid pro quo does not exist unless he is addressing someone directly, but the exchange with reporters proves how easily the words drop from his mouth.\n\nFor Democrats, those words should feel like manna from heaven. Impeachment is a political case likely to fall short in the Republican-led Senate, but what helps you prove such a case? When the subject repeats behaviour after having essentially been made clear of the danger.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

That an investigation will boil down to whether it is fit for a president to ask a foreign government to investigate a political rival. That muddies the water in exactly the way Trump wants. Soliciting a foreign country to meddle in an election \u2013 and if Joe Biden becomes the Democrat nominee or is close, how can that not be seen as such \u2013 is a felony.\n\nLate last night it was reported that Trump raised Biden's political prospects with Xi during a call in June and the record of that call was stored on the same exclusive server that hosted the call with Ukraine's Volodymr Zelensky. The call now at the centre of the impeachment probe.\n\nEverything else is just grist to the mill. But it does provide some powerful supporting evidence. Elements of the state department were allowed to assist Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani to help push the investigation into the Bidens, and Trump asked for his attorney general to be involved too. Trump will also mobilise every weapon at his disposal to protect himself, meaning there will always be multiple avenues for investigators to chase up.\n\nThe text messages from officials surrounding the Zelensky call prove that. On the morning of the call between the Ukraine leader and Trump, envoy Kurt Volker informed a Zelensky aide that a visit to the White House was predicated on the president convincing Trump that he\u2019ll \u201cget to the bottom of what happened\u201d in 2016. The week before, on 19 July, Volker tells another US official: \u201cMost important is for Zelensky to say that he will help investigation \u2013 and address any specific personnel issues \u2013 there are any.\u201d\n\nThis, and a number of other texts, show one thing. That Ukraine must be in no doubt that security assistance and aid is tied to help with the investigations Trump wants.\n\nThe president and his inner circle might deny wrongdoing, but the evidence is clear. It is not a legal test that must be passed, but a political one, and the bar has been cleared. Trump must eventually reap what he sows, but we cannot wait for the judgement to come at the ballot box.\n\nTrump must be impeached now. Removal should follow, even if it likely won't.", "description": "A smoking gun,\u00a0that is what Democrats have been searching for more than two years.
