It\u2019s not true. So, if you skip meals, it\u2019s gonna have such a negative effect on your body that when you do go to sit down and eat, you\u2019ll probably overconsume.\n\nNarrator: That\u2019s Lorraine Kearney, one of three dietitians we brought into our studios.\n\nRyan Turner: My name is Ryan Turner.\n\nNikita Kapur: My name is Nikita Kapur.\n\nNarrator: To debunk 18 of the most common weight-loss myths.\n\nKearney: The biggest myth that frustrates me the most is that all calories are created equally. A calorie is not just a calorie. It depends on the source of your calories, whether it\u2019s coming from caloric-dense foods or nutritional-dense foods. Caloric-dense foods would be more so our cookies, our cakes. We can have a cookie that\u2019s 100 calories, we\u2019ll eat it, it will digest really fast, then it\u2019s gonna spike our blood sugar levels where, when we start to crash again, we\u2019re gonna crave more sugar for that energy pick-me-up.\n\nNarrator: And that can make you gain weight.\n\nKearney: On the other hand, you can have a banana.\n\nNarrator: Which is an example of a nutritionally dense food.\n\nKearney: I get the question a lot, do bananas make you fat? Bananas do not make you fat. Bananas, they\u2019re a great source of potassium, but for those 100 calories you\u2019re also gonna get the fibre and the nutrients that your body needs in that cellular level to make sure that you are healthy and that you\u2019re nourished.\n\nNarrator: And you definitely need to nourish your body if you\u2019re trying to lose weight.\n\nKapur: When we are restricting calories, you are restricting the energy source of your body. You\u2019re also restricting the energy source of your brain. And if that\u2019s happening, then, you know, very primitive, protective mechanisms start to kick into place where your body senses that as a physiological threat and does start to shift your metabolic balance to burn less because it\u2019s getting less.\n\nIt\u2019s kinda like a bad budget. Right? So, if you have a paycheck and you\u2019re running out of funds, you\u2019re going to conserve how much you pay till your next paycheck. Your body does the same. Your body will jump into this protective physiological, biological mechanism to reduce the amount of energy you\u2019re using, which is why it is hard for people to maintain weight.\n\nNarrator: And starving yourself can also shrink your muscles.\n\nTurner: You wanna make sure that you\u2019re not eating less than 70% of your overall calorie needs. If you do, that\u2019s where not only are you probably gonna feel extremely hungry and it\u2019s gonna take you off of any goals that you\u2019re setting, but you\u2019re probably gonna start compromising your muscle mass as well, and that\u2019s where weight loss is gonna be unhealthy.\n\nNarrator: But while the amount of calories you consume matters, the timing might not.\n\nTurner: Timing your meals is always a big question. Everyone comes to me and they kinda smirk and they think that I\u2019m gonna give them a thumbs up when they say, \u201cI don\u2019t eat after 6 o\u2019clock or 7 o\u2019clock.\u201d And I say, \u201cOh, all right, do you enjoy that?\u201d\n\nAnd they say, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nAnd I say, \u201cWell then maybe eating after is OK.\u201d Because timing of day is not going to affect weight loss. Calories are what\u2019s going to affect weight loss or body-fat loss. So, if you eat a bunch of additional calories and you\u2019re in calorie surplus and those are coming late at night, then that\u2019s what\u2019s causing something like weight gain.\n\nNarrator: And what about eating first thing in the morning?\n\nKearney: It depends on the body, and it depends on the person and their relationship with food. For a lot of people, me included, if I don\u2019t eat a meal, I usually feel very deprived, and it\u2019s like I want to make up for it later. If that happens, then that\u2019s when we can add in a lot of calories.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m a huge advocate of breakfast. Our body runs on fuel, and food is our fuel. So if we have our breakfast, then we feel we have more sustained energy throughout the day.\n\nNarrator: And if you do choose to eat breakfast, feel free to go for that 2% yogurt.\n\nTurner: Now, fat is incredibly necessary. We should not be afraid of fat. We need fat in the diet. Fat\u2019s gonna be necessary for things like absorbing nutrients, like the fat-soluble nutrients like vitamin A and D and E and K. And you also need to make sure that fat, specifically cholesterol, is what\u2019s gonna help produce things like your hormones, so things like estrogen and testosterone, growth hormones, so we need all those kind of things.\n\nNarrator: Not only is fat healthy, but fat-free foods are often loaded with sugar or salt.\n\nKearney: So, if you have a wholesome product and you\u2019re removing the fat of it, it\u2019s gonna taste completely different. You probably wouldn\u2019t even like it. But what they\u2019re gonna do is replace that flavour with something else, and usually it\u2019s either sodium or sugar.\n\nSo, with sugar, when we have, like, a yogurt that has the fruit at the bottom, they\u2019re gonna have way more sugars than if you had, like, a 2% Greek yogurt.\n\nNarrator: And, as it turns out, fat isn\u2019t the only nutrient you can keep in your diet and still lose weight.\n\nKearney: One of the biggest myths I get about carbs is that you must omit them from your diet to lose weight, or my body doesn\u2019t digest them well and I have to omit them because I\u2019d never lose weight unless I restrict myself. It\u2019s not true.\n\nNarrator: And it\u2019s just not sustainable.\n\nKearney: It\u2019s almost impossible to have a no-carb diet. Fruits and vegetables are known as carbohydrates, and we must get those for their nutrients. Why carbs have a bad name? It\u2019s because of the simple carbs. The carbs that you see prepackaged that are the cookies, the cakes, the sodas, the potato chips.\n\nThey\u2019re called simple carbs because the chemical structure of them is usually one to two glucose molecules put together. So, when you have, like, a small glucose molecule, it\u2019s easy for them to break away.\n\nBut with our complex carbs, they are really long chains of carbon that usually are about 18-carbon long, and then, by the time that your body starts to break it down, it\u2019s gonna take a while, and that\u2019s exactly what we want because it helps balance our blood sugar and also that fibre keeps us full for longer and then also prevents us from snacking.\n\nSo, eat your carbs. Definitely eat your carbs and eat your bread. Bread\u2019s delicious; it\u2019s one of my favourite things.\n\nNarrator: And she has a pro tip for finding bread with more complex carbs.\n\nKearney: Read your ingredient list. With bread, a lot of those mass-produced breads that are in the bread aisle that are shelf-stable, they can last a month without getting mould on them. And when you look at the ingredient list, it\u2019s probably about 50 ingredients long. They\u2019re the ones we wanna avoid.\n\nWhen you\u2019re getting bread, get the fresh bread that comes from the local bakery, which is usually around the deli counter area inside of grocery stores. Those will have maybe four or five ingredients, it will mould after two days, but you can preserve it by just putting it into the freezer and take it out as you need it.\n\nNarrator: And, speaking of bread, what about going gluten-free to lose weight?\n\nKearney: Gluten-free for weight loss can be a huge marketing ploy. So, with gluten-free, there are a lot of people that do have an intolerance to gluten. Or they have celiac disease, which is where the body starts attacking itself and can deteriorate the body.\n\nNarrator: But there are also people without these conditions who are looking to\u2026\n\nKearney: Blame something like the gluten without checking the rest of their diet. If you are honest with yourself, recording your food, checking the ingredients, and then you eat the gluten and you feel the intolerance, then great. But a lot of people will choose to just jump in and be like, gluten\u2019s the enemy.\n\nNarrator: So, most of us don\u2019t need to cut out gluten or fat or carbs to lose weight. But there are some products better left on the shelf.\n\nKearney: The diet sodas are terrible, with all the added preservatives in them, and the hidden sugars. A lot of the added sugars are the synthetic sugars that are supposed to be great because they don\u2019t release insulin, which then doesn\u2019t cause a spike in blood sugar levels.\n\nBut, internally, if we don\u2019t stimulate the release of insulin, those sugars, the synthetic sugars, go to the liver, build up around the liver, hinder the functioning of the liver, and then can lead to nonalcoholic fatty disease. If I\u2019m gonna have a soda, which I have once in a blue moon, it will be the real thing.\n\nYes, there\u2019s more sugar in it, but it\u2019s something that I don\u2019t have on a regular basis.\n\nNarrator: Better yet, she says, drink water.\n\nKearney: Jazz up your water. Add fruit to it, add some mint or cucumber, lemon. Yes, it will take a little bit for your taste buds to reset, but you\u2019re getting so many nutrients from that water, and your body requires water for it to function optimally.\n\nWater is one of the six nutrients that the body needs. And when we\u2019re dehydrated, it also mimics the signs of hunger. So people turn to food a lot if they\u2019re dehydrated, not realising that they\u2019re not hungry, it\u2019s just your body saying, \u201cGive me some water, I\u2019m thirsty.\u201d\n\nNarrator: And what about juice?\n\nKearney: Oh, juice cleanses. [laughs]\n\nSo, juice cleanses are, like, one of my pet peeves. If you\u2019re having a juice every once in a while, great. You\u2019re still getting the antioxidants out of it, you\u2019re still getting the nutrients, but you\u2019re removing that fibre. And fibre is key for the body to support gut health.\n\nWith a lot of juice cleanses, they\u2019re hella expensive, and we have this belief that they\u2019re gonna be better for our bodies or it\u2019s a cleansing effect of our body. Realistically, what\u2019s happening is that, when you have those juice cleanses that are mostly coming from, like, fruit sugars and then the vegetable sugars, it\u2019s a high, high amount of fructose in the body.\n\nWhen the body consumes excess fructose, it has a spasming effect of the GI tract that can lend to the cleansing effect. So that when we are actually having a reaction to the high amounts of fructose in the body, people think it\u2019s the cleansing effect because the marketing ploys have led us to believe that way. But it\u2019s not.\n\nYou would be better cleansing your body by actually eating the apple, eating the spinach, and eating all the other fruits that are in that cleanse. That would be better for you because fibre is our natural detox. What it does is it goes through the body, picks up, like, excess fat, metabolic waste, and help cleanse it out.\n\nNarrator: But juice cleanses aren\u2019t the only diet fads that don\u2019t often work.\n\nTurner: Intermittently fasting is probably a question I get all the time. It\u2019s\u2026we can kinda put it in that myth category.\n\nNarrator: Now, it can restrict calories and, at least temporarily, help you lose weight.\n\nTurner: If you\u2019re only allowed to eat food for eight hours, that just gives someone a lot of structure, and that can be very, very helpful. You can only get so many calories in your mouth in that time. On the flip side, someone can get a lot of calories in their mouth during that time as well.\n\nSo, someone can, and I\u2019ve seen many people do it, they have gained weight through intermittent fasting. So it\u2019s not just gonna be this quick fix; there\u2019s nothing magical to it.\n\nNarrator: And the same goes for many popular diets.\n\nKapur: So, one of the common diets right now that is gaining popularity is the ketogenic diet. So, a lot of people who are doing that are just eliminating carbohydrates, which is why that\u2019s hard to sustain, because your body does need carbohydrates for a reason.\n\nTo be honest, there\u2019s not a lot of research that\u2019s saying that that is something that is helpful. There\u2019s maybe a lot of research in mice models, but that hasn\u2019t been transcribed into human studies.\n\nNarrator: And while people have lost weight on keto, it\u2019s often not without side effects.\n\nKapur: They\u2019re eliminating whole grains and legumes, certain fruits and vegetables, and really increasing their fat intake, which, although fats are important, excess of any nutrient can cause metabolic changes in your body that will impact your cardiovascular health, your physical health, your metabolic health.\n\nSo, an example would be patients that we\u2019re seeing in the clinical setting are following ketogenic diets, are seeing weight loss, however, are coming with higher cholesterol markers, they\u2019re coming with higher LDL markers, they\u2019re coming with more irritable bowel symptoms, they\u2019re coming with more gastrointestinal discomfort.\n\nNarrator: The truth is there\u2019s no one tool that will make you magically lose weight.\n\nKapur: I think the most prevalent concept around health these days is biohacking, which is this idea that you can defeat biology, you can work around your genetic predispositions, your metabolic parameters, and that is actually not true. And the reason for that is because you cannot defeat biology, you cannot hack hunger, you cannot hack access to healthcare, you cannot hack motivation.\n\nAnd this idea that, again, if those results are there, you\u2019re going to be able to feel more satisfied is also not true. So, this biohacking works on this concept and this belief that, you know, you can work your way and fix your body, and that prescribes to the social construct that it is up to you to change that.\n\nNarrator: And that\u2019s also why most diets don\u2019t work.\n\nKapur: They\u2019re hard to sustain, they\u2019re hard to maintain, so the results are very temporary, which is why we go back to something, trying something new. It\u2019s important to focus on behaviours rather than outcomes.\n\nKearney: Where you should start is record your food. A simple food log to lose weight is really just being honest with yourself, identifying your foods and the hidden ingredients that could be contributing to excess of hundreds and hundreds of calories per day.\n\nTake olive oil. Olive oil is great. But when we cook with it, we usually free-pour it into a pan. Each tablespoon of olive oil has 128 calories. Now, if you\u2019re pouring in, like, 6, 7, 8 tablespoons with your vegetables, you\u2019re getting almost 1,000 calories that you don\u2019t need.\n\nNarrator: So, pro tip for cooking with olive oil:\n\nKearney: Put it in, wait till your pan is hot, once it\u2019s hot, add 1 to 2 tablespoons of olive oil, and then add in your vegetables. When the pan is hot enough, it will disperse easier and then you\u2019ll use less. Also, once you put the vegetables in, some water and moisture will come from those vegetables and will add to the liquid in the pan, so you actually don\u2019t need to add excess in.\n\nNarrator: And if you are being mindful of what you eat, that whole idea of cheating? Kearney isn\u2019t a fan.\n\nKearney: I don\u2019t think there is any cheat meals. I don\u2019t like the word cheat. I think it gives it this, it gives us this, like, higher power, like, oh, this is really bad and I can\u2019t believe I did this, I completely fell off the wagon.\n\nNo, remove that. Because then you\u2019re gonna want it more, you\u2019re gonna feel even more guilty about it. If you go out and you\u2019re socialising and you\u2019re trying out one of New York\u2019s best restaurants that\u2019s filled with cream and butter, enjoy it. Just try to get a salad to start.\n\nAnd filling up on salad is a great way to cut the calories, and then, have, like, one of the appetizers that are not in line with your health goals with your table and share, \u2019cause sharing is caring.\n\nNarrator: And there\u2019s more good news.\n\nKearney: You can still lose weight while drinking occasional alcohol, if you\u2019re sticking to the cleaner foods. And by omitting all the foods that you tend to enjoy in the past, by omitting alcohol, trying to increase your exercise, and then doing this, like, detox fad all in one goal, it\u2019s overwhelming, and it\u2019s setting you up for failure.\n\nSo doing it in stages and being more realistic about what you can change now, and then work towards it. What I usually recommend to my clients is take care of your food now. You\u2019ll understand how your body feels when it\u2019s nourished, understand how your gut health is supposed to be supported, and then we\u2019ll focus on alcohol and working in the exercise.\n\nNarrator: But the thing is, no matter how much we care about it, weight definitely isn\u2019t everything.\n\nKapur: I think one of the biggest myths around weight loss and weight is that overweight equals unhealthy, normal weight equals healthy, as defined by the BMI category.\n\nBMI is a very inaccurate measure of health because it is just looking at your height and weight without taking into account what your metabolic factors and parameters are, what is your physiological health, your physical health, your sleep, your mental health, your relationship to food.\n\nAnd I think it\u2019s very important to factor those things if we really wanna define someone as healthy. And if we\u2019re not gonna look at it more holistically, I think what that does is it marginalizes people in bigger bodies.\n\nNarrator: Plus, not everyone can lose weight, even if they\u2019re putting in the same effort.\n\nKapur: That\u2019s a very common myth, that everybody should have, has the same ability to lose weight, and if everybody eats the same way, they\u2019re gonna look the same way, which is very untrue, and that\u2019s incorrect. And the reason for that is I think it\u2019s important to understand that someone\u2019s weight is a factor of so many different things.\n\nIt is so complex. All the way from your genetic predispositions, your family history, your past medical history, your relationship to food as you were growing up, because not everybody has access to food.\n\nBecause health is about inclusion, access, connection, joy, physiological well-being, and we have to take those factors into account.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
