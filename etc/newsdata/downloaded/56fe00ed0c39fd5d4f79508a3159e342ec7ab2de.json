At issue here is a cache of internal documents unearthed in a case brought by Six4Three, a defunct startup whose founders have waged a bitter four-year legal battle with the social network.\n\nIn a nine-page Sept. 13 letter obtained by The Associated Press, the House committee requested all substantive filings from Six4Three\u2019s lawsuit. That would include thousands of pages of internal Facebook documents and emails, some authored by CEO , that were ordered sealed by a California judge. The AP has obtained many of these documents.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal recently reported that the House committee made document requests to \u201cdozens\u201d of smaller companies that compete with Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple.\n\nSix4Three, however, could offer unique insights into Facebook\u2019s behavior, as its documents provide an inside view of executive deliberations and decisions that might be viewed as anticompetitive conduct. Some antitrust investigators have already cited them as potentially important evidence in probes of the company.\n\nSeveral hundred pages of the documents became public in late 2018 after British lawmakers ordered Six4Three managing director Ted Kramer to turn over much of the trove while he was visiting the U.K. Others were leaked to British journalist Duncan Campbell and shared with the AP and NBC .\n\nKramer and his founding investor, Thomas Scaramellino, allege that Facebook deceived and then crushed their startup \u2014 and thousands of others \u2014 by abruptly shutting down access to user data essential to their businesses.\n\nDocuments unearthed in the Six4Three case suggest that Facebook separately targeted specific outside apps for cutoff because they competed with Facebook\u2019s own core services , particularly messaging and photo/video sharing. One was the now-shuttered MessageMe, which has also received a document request from the House committee, according to its former CEO, Arjun Sethi. So has at least one other aggrieved startup, although its founders did not want to be named.\n\nFacebook publicly minimized the scope of its data access shift, describing it as minor changes necessary to protect user privacy. But the effect, its critics charge, was to let the social giant pick winners and losers among companies whose existence depended on Facebook user data.\n\nA few Facebook employees objected to the plan as unethical, according to documents . \"It just makes me feel like a bad person,\" wrote one.\n\nFacebook denies the allegations and otherwise declines to discuss the case, the documents or their wider implications. In a statement, the company\u2019s deputy general counsel, Paul Grewal, said Six4Three \u201ccontinues to mischaracterize documents and testimony\u201d in the service of \u201cmeritless claims.\u201d\n\nGrewal also stated that the company acted to protect user privacy: \u201cWe stand by our decision to limit the data that apps can access and protect people's information.\u201d\n\nThe U.K. parliamentary committee, which requested the documents as part of a broader inquiry into misinformation on social networks, published key emails and presentations from the Six4Three trove. It said companies like Facebook should not be allowed to act like \u201cdigital gangsters\u201d in deciding whether other businesses succeed or fail.\n\nIt also rejected Facebook\u2019s privacy explanation for the change, noting that the company continued to share \u2014 and sometimes overshare \u2014 user data with favored partners who spent heavily on Facebook\u2019s ad network and posed little competitive threat.\n\nSix4Three makes an unlikely crusader. Its only product was an app called Pikinis that let Facebook users seek out swimsuit photos shared by their friends. The feminist site Jezebel called it \u201c creepy \u201d when it launched in 2013 . In an interview, Kramer said Pikinis was merely a way of testing pattern recognition technology the company planned to deploy in future apps, that it respected user privacy settings and never made more than a few hundred dollars.\n\nTo Luigi Zingales, a University of Chicago finance professor who recently co-authored an academic report on reining in digital platforms , the Six4Three case has exposed \u201chow much Facebook has succeeded in blocking competition in a lot of behind-the-scenes ways,\u201d whatever anyone makes of Pikinis.\n\nThe startup\u2019s lawsuit, however, has not gone well for Kramer and Scaramellino. Facebook, one of the largest companies in the world, launched a withering legal counterattack that, among other things, forced the plaintiffs\u2019 trial attorneys to quit the case.\n\nThe trial judge also allowed a forensics firm that has previously worked for Facebook to collect 15 years of sensitive electronic records from the the entrepreneurs, including email exchanges with journalists and antitrust investigators. Facebook\u2019s lawyers justified the intense scrutiny by alleging a conspiracy to leak the sealed documents.\n\nKramer and Scaramellino could also face potentially ruinous legal fees should the state court in San Mateo, California, order them to pay legal costs for Facebook and executives, including Zuckerberg, listed as defendants.\n\n\u201cThe message is, if you go after Facebook, you\u2019re done,\u201d Kramer said in a recent interview.\n\nJudge Raymond Swope has yet to rule on whether Facebook gets to see all the data its forensic investigators have amassed. But the new developments in Washington augur a crucial showdown in his California courtroom. Kramer and Scaramellino hope the legal and political scrutiny will force him to unseal the documents.\n\nA Facebook lawyer has demanded that the plaintiffs refuse to provide the documents to Congress, a company spokesperson confirmed without discussing the letter\u2019s content. Scaramellino said he and Kramer are \u201cevaluating\u201d their response.\n\nAfter suing in April 2015, Kramer and Scaramellino could find no willing co-plaintiffs among the 35,000 or so startups the documents indicate were affected. Four developers they contacted told the AP that while they supported Six4Three, they lacked stomach for the fight or feared being blacklisted. Afraid of retribution from Facebook or its allies, they asked not to be identified.\n\nOne developer still active in Silicon Valley said multiple Facebook executives told him they would make his life \u201ca living hell\u201d if he sued. Others have moved on to other endeavors, some with financial backing from Facebook.\n\nSix4Three did pick up an ally last year after Frans Ros\u00e9n, the Swedish principal of another affected startup, Styleform IT, met Kramer in an ethical hacking competition the latter organized. After comparing notes, Ros\u00e9n said he realized Facebook had carried out, in his words , a \u201cdevastating extortion scheme.\u201d\n\nRos\u00e9n sued Facebook in November, although his case is in peril because he hired the same trial lawyers as Six4Three. He\u2019s now seeking new counsel \u2014 and additional plaintiffs \u2014 and has until Dec. 1 to find them.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFrank Bajak on Twitter: http://twitter.com/fbajak", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
