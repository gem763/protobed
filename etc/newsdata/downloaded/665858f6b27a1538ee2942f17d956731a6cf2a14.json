Neither worked.\n\nThe night in Houston highlighted a puzzle that has vexed 2020 hopefuls \u2014 how to knock Biden off his game. Frequent gaffes haven\u2019t hurt him. His 76 years haven\u2019t stopped him -- and on Thursday, it was Bernie Sanders, 78, who was hoarse and hunched. His checkered history on race hasn\u2019t sunk him.\n\nAnd in a Democratic debate in which Barack Obama was revered, his former vice president was well-positioned to claim he\u2019s the rightful heir.\n\nIn the end, the nearly three-hour debate seemed unlikely to reshape the current contours of the Democratic primary: Biden in a persistent lead as a rising Elizabeth Warren and a steady Sanders battle for second place. None of the others polls in double-digit support, with Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg rounding out the top five.\n\n\u201cI do think that candidates have seen over the course not just in the debates, but over the course of this campaign, that attacking Joe Biden is not the way to advance yourself in the polls,\u201d Biden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield told reporters after the debate.\n\nRuben Gallego, an Arizona congressman who has endorsed Harris, argued that the dynamics of the race will change once the field narrows.\n\n\u201cRight now, asking a voter to dislodge what are positive feelings from Biden \u2014 because he was a good vice president \u2014 for nine other people that they may not know as well yet is going to be very difficult,\u201d Gallego said after the debate. \u201cI think once you\u2019re talking about five people, then there\u2019s going to be a different ballgame.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s age showed through not just his gray hair but his dated references. His first line of the debate evoked President John F. Kennedy, who was elected in 1960. Without irony, he called on families to use a \u201crecord player,\u201d a format that largely fell by the wayside long before many of today\u2019s voters were born.\n\nObama\u2019s Heir\n\nA much-anticipated clash between Biden and Warren, who represent opposite visions for the party, failed to materialize. Harris didn\u2019t attempt another assault on Biden after it backfired in the previous debate. Sanders politely jabbed him for voting for the Iraq war, but Biden had already said it was a mistake. Julian Castro, a rare aggressor on Biden, questioned his short-term memory in a jab that fell flat because Castro flubbed the facts.\n\nBiden set the tone early by tying himself \u2014 yet again \u2014 to Obama, an alliance that has powered him to a commanding lead with the black community, a crucial voting bloc in the Democratic primaries and one that both Sanders and Warren are struggling to reach.\n\n\u00a9 Bloomberg Candidates Attend Third 2020 Democratic Presidential Debates\n\nThe Democratic presidential candidate debate in Houston, on Sept. 12.\n\nIn the first back-and-forth of the debate, Biden contrasted Warren\u2019s support for the Sanders government-run health care plan with his own proposal that builds on Obamacare. \u201cThe senator says she\u2019s for Bernie,\u201d he said of Warren. \u201cWell, I\u2019m for Barack.\u201d\n\nThat forced Warren to play on his terrain. She said, nodding toward Biden, \u201cWe all owe a huge debt to President Obama, who fundamentally transformed health care in America.\u201d\n\nBiden was grilled twice by moderator Jorge Ramos of Univision about one of Obama\u2019s most unpopular decisions: to deport record numbers of undocumented immigrants during his first term. Biden stood firm in his allegiance.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t lock people up in cages, we didn\u2019t separate families,\u201d he said, adding that Obama created the program that allowed people brought to the U.S. illegally as children to remain in the country as adults. \u201cI\u2019m proud to have served with him,\u201d he added. \u201cThe president did the best thing that was able to be done at the time.\n\nDeep Support\n\nBiden later cited one disagreement with Obama -- when he said he opposed the troop surge in Afghanistan.\n\nOther candidates had some strong moments.\n\nAn energetic Beto O\u2019Rourke lit up the crowd as he declared, \u201cHell yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15s, your AK-47s.\u201d Warren drew cheers for proposing to abolish the Senate filibuster to achieve gun control, and spoke eloquently about trade. Harris repeatedly pivoted to attacking President Donald Trump, eliciting approving laughter by calling him \u201ca really small dude\u201d in an allusion to the Wizard of Oz. Pete Buttigieg evoked his military service to call for preventing needless wars.\n\nBut if there\u2019s one thing that\u2019s clear, five months before voting begins, it\u2019s that Biden\u2019s support in the party runs deep enough to withstand his litany of unforced errors.\n\n\u201cPeople are comfortable with Joe,\u201d said Democratic Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, who represents Houston and is neutral in the race. \u201cThe other candidates are saying, give us a chance, and they did a mighty good job. But I think the real issue is comfort.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfrican American voters want to make sure that they have a proven entity. You can prove yourself, but they like a proven entity as well,\u201d she said.\n\n--With assistance from Jennifer Epstein.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Sahil Kapur in Washington at skapur39@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Wendy Benjaminson at wbenjaminson@bloomberg.net, Joe Sobczyk\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "Rivals eager to dislodge Joe Biden from his front-runner\u2019s perch tried attacking him in last month\u2019s debate and going easy on him in Thursday\u2019s debate.
