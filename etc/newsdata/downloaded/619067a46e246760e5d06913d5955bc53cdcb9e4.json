And of course because of the sad times we live in, for some gay people that big moment of coming out, never comes.\n\nIn our country, gay people may now hold equal rights when it comes to marriage but that still doesn't guarantee favourable reactions from friends, colleagues and even parents about their sexuality.\n\nAnd these days, people are choosing to come out online first and then in real life. So if you are ready to let the world know about you, then these 5 tips can help you plan and execute the big reveal with thought, emotion and care. After all, everyone deserves to love and be loved by whoever they choose.\n\n1. Post whatever you want to. There are no set rules for coming out online.\n\nIt's okay to follow the path of someone you look up to or admire when it comes to revealing your sexual identity to your followers. But you can post whatever feels right to you. It could be a poem, a riddle, a super adorable photo of you and your partner or write a heartfelt post on finding love and embracing it. A little advice: please do talk about your struggle. You never know who you might inspire.\n\n2. You might be bombarded with questions from your followers but you are under no obligation to respond to all of them.\n\nNaturally, once you make the big reveal, your followers are bound to send you private messages asking for all sorts of details. Choose to reply to those who you want to. And feel free to ignore really stupid or insensitive questions. It's important to set healthy boundaries even in your virtual life. So again, focus on what feels right.\n\n3. It's okay if some people just don't get it.\n\nListen, you're doing the most normal thing about sharing your love life on social media. If some people don't get it, it's on them. Please don't get upset over their reactions.\n\nJust know these people are on different journeys towards their own physical, emotional and spiritual development.\n\nYou are important. Your love matters. You are free to love whoever. Keep reminding yourself of this again and again.\n\n4. You and your identity still matters.\n\nAfter speaking to many queer people, one thing is for sure: sharing your life about being gay online can be super empowering and enlightening for those who are struggling to accept their own identity. And that is why you will always matter.\n\n5. Keep spreading love. It's exactly what the world needs right now.\n\nThe world is a better place knowing you, your partner and your love story. So keep spreading love and being who you are. Trust us, the world needs more brave people like you.\n\nLet love win every single day.", "description": "And these days, people are choosing to come out online first and then in real life.
