With six minutes remaining on a difficult night, Luis Su\u00e1rez took advantage of a brilliant Lionel Messi run to score his second and take a Barcelona team that had been outplayed at times from a goal down to defeat Internazionale 2-1.\n\nAntonio Conte\u2019s side had seemed set to defeat Barcelona at the Camp Nou for the first time in six years of European football, stretching back 39 games, but a superb first half was not enough. Not with those two around.\n\nWillian\u2019s bouncer vaults Chelsea past Lille after Abraham\u2019s birthday goal Read more\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to take because with everything we created we deserved more. We hurt them, but not as much as we could have. In the end, a move from two superstars changed everything,\u201d Conte said after a game that ended in a way that seemed unlikely when Lautaro Mart\u00ednez gave Inter the lead inside two minutes \u2013 or, in fact, for the next hour. Sent dashing beyond Cl\u00e9ment Lenglet via a rebound, Mart\u00ednez\u2019s finish was hard and low and was just the start.\n\nFor Barcelona, the way Frenkie de Jong, Gerard Piqu\u00e9 and Sergio Busquets had been drawn to the ball and left stranded was a portrait of a recurring problem, the wild slide-tackles that followed deepening the sense that they were grasping for some control. They were, after all, trailing for the fifth time in nine games, aware that turning this around would be some task.\n\nFirst, they had to survive. \u201cWe\u2019re not going with helmets on just to defend,\u201d Conte had said and his team was as good as his word. Inter had less of the ball but used it with a precision, purpose and clarity Barcelona lacked. Asked what he thought of them, Ernesto Valverde said simply: \u201cBloody hell, a great team.\u201d\n\nQuick guide Champions League roundup: Napoli draw blank while Dortmund cruise Show Hide Napoli, the Group E leaders, were held to a goalless draw at Genk. Carlo Ancelotti\u2019s side \u2013 who beat Liverpool 2-0 at home in their opening match \u2013 had started brightly in Belgium, but were not able to find a breakthrough as Genk recovered from their 6-2 thrashing in Salzburg.\n\nBorussia Dortmund won 2-0 at Slavia Prague, with two goals from the full-back Achraf Hakimi, to put Dortmund top of Group F on goal difference. Stanislav Tecl had squandered the chance to equalise in the second half when through on goal, only to shoot into the side netting before Hakimi sealed victory with another well-taken late effort. Valencia, who defeated Chelsea in the opening round in Group H, were beaten 3-0 at home by Ajax, who have a 100% start. Hakim Ziyech\u2019s spectacular effort broke the deadlock on eight minutes. Daniel Parejo then missed a chance to equalise when he sent a penalty over the bar in the 25th minute. Quincy Promes added a second before half-time, with Donny van de Beek scoring a third in the 67th minute for Ajax. In Group G, Zenit St Petersburg beat Benfica 3-1 at home to top the table. Artem Dzyuba put them ahead in the 22nd minute, with an own goal from R\u00faben Dias given following a VAR review and Sardar Azmoun\u2019s solo effort wrapping things up. Ra\u00fal De Tom\u00e1s scored a late consolation. Memphis Depay was on target as Lyon won 2-0 at RB Leipzig, with Martin Terrier also scoring in the second half. PA Media\n\nAs if to underline that, Inter played from deep, their goalkeeper Samir Handanovic joining the passing triangle. One five-pass, one-touch move inside their own area saw them reach an open field; six more passes and 70 metres later, Stefano Sensi was on the edge of the box shooting just over.\n\nSomehow, it was still only 1-0 and Barcelona would be grateful. Milan Skriniar had already had one ruled out, N\u00e9lson Semedo had dived to block Nicol\u00f2 Barella and Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen had superbly saved Mart\u00ednez\u2019s header. Next, Alexis S\u00e1nchez headed Sensi\u2019s clipped delivery wide and, as Barcelona were again pulled out of position, Semedo had to dash back to stop Lautaro.\n\nMo Salah earns jittery Liverpool 4-3 win after RB Salzburg storm back Read more\n\nBarcelona were alive but needed something to happen and Su\u00e1rez happened, thumping a volley from Arturo Vidal\u2019s pass on 58 minutes. Vidal had replaced Busquets, with De Jong moving central and the game shifted. Next, the Chilean and Messi worked it to Griezmann who smashed into the sidenetting before his replacement, Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, struck over. And that, it seemed, was that.\n\nBut at the end of his first full game of the season Messi set off on a long run, left three men behind and slipped it to Su\u00e1rez who, dipping his shoulder and stepping into the area away from Diego God\u00edn, finished calmly.", "description": "Lautaro Mart\u00ednez gave Inter an early lead but Luis Su\u00e1rez scored two superb second-half goals to give Barcelona a 2-1 win in the Champions League", "authors": ["Sid Lowe"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/389fd4d931b76a4183920668d1a7a8fcabacd393/1075_168_2078_1247/master/2078.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bbe0db906ad6ead81d7164a4d14d8925"}
