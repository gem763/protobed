Now.", "language": "en", "text": "Homebuilders are a buy, according to a chorus of analysts.\n\nThat may seem surprising, and even counter-intuitive given slowing U.S. economic growth, but lower mortgage rates, improving affordability, and seasonal trends are all giving homebuilders a boost.\n\nRead: It\u2019s probably time to kiss that housing market rebound good-bye\n\nCombined sales of new and previously-owned homes peaked in late 2017 and flat-lined for the following 18 months. New construction wasn\u2019t making much progress, either, as reported by MarketWatch calling the top of the housing cycle in 2018.\n\nIt may now be time to revise that earlier thesis, particularly given a strong seasonal pattern in builder stock prices identified by several analysts.\n\n\u201cWe see multiple catalysts for order growth and rising demand,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Jay McCanless on Thursday, upgrading his price targets across the universe of builder stocks he covers.\n\nMcCanless thinks housing market conditions are improving for builders \u2013 itself a surprising notion so late in any economic cycle that\u2019s showing increasing signs of slowing \u2013 but he also sees upside to the coming earnings season.\n\nSeparately, as MarketWatch reported several days ago, Bespoke Investment Group told clients that \u201chousing market momentum is likely to continue,\u201d based on metrics like mortgage applications.\n\nFinally, analysts at Fundstrat published a research report Friday demonstrating the calendar effects that make the builders favorable right now.\n\nThe supportive conditions McCanless notes include lower mortgage rates, which are helping boost affordability. So is the slowing pace of home price gains and a resilient job market.\n\nSo far this year, builders have broken ground on more new single-family houses, which are almost all built for purchase, not rent, as shown in the chart below.\n\nThat\u2019s all great for the housing market writ large, but it\u2019s the builder\u2019s business models that make them a buy, rather than other types of housing plays, McCanless said.\n\nCompanies like D.R. Horton inc. DHI, +0.90% have pivoted to more affordable products, something housing market analysts \u2013 and customers \u2013 have clamored for.\n\nSee: Homebuilder stocks are beaten down, but analysts are super-bullish on \u2018super-affordable\u2019\n\nWhy now?\n\nWe\u2019re about to enter what Fundstrat analyst Thomas J. Lee calls the \u201cGolden\u201d six-month stretch. Since 1999, he wrote, builder stocks have generally hit bottom around the end of October and then risen, on average, 18.3% through the end of April, outpacing the S&P 500 SPX, -0.39% .\n\nBut surely this year is different, with home builders up about 25% in the year to date? \u201cDespite this, we still think this seasonal \u2018Golden 6M\u2019 will play out,\u201d Lee wrote. \u201cIn 2012, for instance, Homebuilders were already up 35% but during that \u2018Golden 6M\u2019 managed to gain another 18%.\u201d Similar dynamics held in 2000 and 2003, he said.\n\nIn fact, in the last decade, it\u2019s only failed once, in 2015.\n\n\u201cWe are not entirely sure why this strong seasonality exists, but it may have to do with the Spring selling season for housing,\u201d Lee said.\n\nRead: Why buying and selling a house could soon be as simple as trading stocks\n\nWedbush\u2019s McCanless takes note of the same seasonality in the stocks, and suggests that buying the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF ITB, +0.71% in October or November and selling the following April is another way to ride the rising tide.\n\nMcCanless has outperform ratings on Lennar Corp. LEN, +1.08%, Taylor Morrison Home Corporation TMHC, -0.11%, Century Communities, Inc. CCS, +0.18%, Beazer Homes USA Inc BZH, +1.38% , and William Lyon Homes WLH, -1.07%, saying \u201cwe remain buyers\u201d of those stocks at current levels.\n\nIn contrast, Fundstrat\u2019s Lee identifies 11 stocks \u201cleveraged to homebuilding\u201d that meet some other requirements to fall within the top quintile of his model, including Meritage Homes Corp. MTH, +0.71% , NVR Inc. NVR, +3.00% , PulteGroup Inc. PHM, +0.16% , Taylor Morrison, and Horton. Lee also lists Home Depot Inc. HD, +0.49% , Lowe\u2019s Co. LOW, +0.21% , Simpson Manufacturing Co. SSD, -0.23% , and a few other non-construction stocks to consider; ITB holds all three of those.\n\nSee: Want to profit from the housing shortage?
