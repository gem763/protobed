The result is arguably good news for dedicated fans of chasing and hurdling, as ITV4 will now screen four races from Kelso as well as the planned four from Cheltenham.\n\nThe loss of Doncaster\u2019s card brings a sorry end to the Vertem Futurity Stakes, which has usually been an important two-year-old race but which this year attracted just one entry from a stable other than Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s. There was no immediate word on whether the Group One contest would be restaged but officials said they were working with all parties to \u201censure the best outcome for the sport\u201d.\n\nTalking Horses: Duke Of Navan has quality to lord it over rivals Read more\n\nIt appears that other Group-level races from the Doncaster and Newbury cards could also be saved, provided a home can be found for them in the next seven days. Newmarket\u2019s racedays on Friday and Saturday appear the most obvious option.\n\nThere were humorous suggestions on social media that the Futurity should be restaged at Ballydoyle, O\u2019Brien\u2019s training base in County Tipperary. Some questioned whether it would be a good use of racing\u2019s funds to restage a race that had attracted such a disappointing entry, but there seems little doubt that the British Horseracing Authority will wish to save it, as an important race with a strong record of identifying Classic contenders.\n\nSaturday morning\u2019s course inspection at Doncaster became a forgone conclusion after 32mm of rain in the previous 24 hours. \u201cIt\u2019s as wet as I\u2019ve known it,\u201d said Roderick Duncan, the clerk of the course. \u201cThe forecast has been absolutely correct and they are predicting the rain will continue until 3pm. It\u2019s very disappointing for all of us at Doncaster.\u201d\n\nNewbury was reportedly waterlogged in places, with no chance of improvement in the face of more rain to come. Monday\u2019s card at Leicester is under threat, as that course is also waterlogged in places. An inspection will be held at noon on Sunday.", "description": "Heavy overnight rain has caused the abandonment of Saturday\u2019s race-meetings at both Doncaster and Newbury", "authors": ["Chris Cook"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55dc11eadf094c1b54638ab6b5910481c1363dbe/0_333_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=546a321beaf867baa969626afe8211de", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
