The car was introduced in two high-performance versions, the 670 horsepower Taycan Turbo and the 751 horsepower Taycan Turbo S.\n\nis now using that name to distinguish high-performance versions of the electric car. The Turbo in the name might be a little confusing. These cars have no actual turbochargers because they're powered entirely by electricity. Turbochargers are used to boost the power output of gasoline engines. But Porsche is now using that name to distinguish high-performance versions of the electric car.\n\nAlso, the maximum horsepower figures will be available only in an Overboost power mode for quick launches. Otherwise, the two electric motors -- one driving the front wheels and one the rear -- can produce up to 617 horsepower on either model.\n\nWhile Porsche has previously shown concept versions of the Taycan, the car shown Wednesday is the actual production car that will go on sale soon. The Turbo S will cost about $185,000, while the Turbo will cost about $151,000. Other versions offering less speed and power at lower prices will be available later this year, Porsche said. An electric crossover SUV, the Taycan Cross Turismo, will be offered late next year.\n\nThe Porsche Taycan is initially being offered in two high-performance Turbo versions.\n\nUsing Overboost and a Launch Control system, the Taycan S can accelerate from a stop to 60 miles an hour in just 2.6 seconds. That's as quickly as a Porsche 911 Turbo, according to Car & Driver. Tesla claims its Model S Performance, the high-performance variant, is even quicker and does so without requiring a Launch Control feature.\n\nRead More", "description": "Porsche unveiled the final production version of its first electric car, the Taycan, Wednesday.
