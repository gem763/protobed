He will long remember his 76th-minute equaliser and sprint to celebrate in front of the Rochdale fans he had sent into ecstasy.\n\nManchester United beat Rochdale on pens, Oxford 4-0 West Ham: Carabao Cup \u2013 live! Read more\n\nMatheson, an A-level student, will be 17 next week but it was United\u2019s own 17-year-old, Mason Greenwood, whose earlier strike appeared to have won the tie. United then drew Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in the next round and the manager said: \u201cIf you want to win it you have to beat the best.\u201d\n\nSolskj\u00e6r had retained only Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Andreas Pereira from the West Ham loss. The headline inclusion was Axel Tuanzebe who, at 21, captained United in only a 10th appearance. He was the youngest to do so since a 20-year-old Norman Whiteside in 1985. This was despite Paul Pogba\u2019s first start for close to a month because of injury.\n\nBrian Barry-Murphy\u2019s side are 17th in League One, six points above the relegation zone after nine games, yet reached the break on level terms.\n\nOf particular interest was how Greenwood would perform in his first game as United\u2019s No 9 \u2013 and he impressed. He would have had a first clear chance if Pogba had turned a far-post header to him. Moments later, he was put in along the left by the same player but his control faltered.\n\nUnited seemed to be moving closer to the breakthrough: Greenwood crossed the ball in from the right, yet Pogba\u2019s header was a particularly woeful miss. Possession was largely United\u2019s but they lacked the class and composure to make it count.\n\nOxford United humiliate West Ham in shock Carabao Cup thrashing Read more\n\nThere was then a real scare for the United defence: it could do nothing as Ollie Rathbone \u2013 once of United \u2013 found Callum Camps and suddenly Wan-Bissaka had to clear off the line.\n\nThis had the packed away end delirious and the home support wondering what, precisely, their team was doing. Rochdale could start to believe the upset was on.\n\nGreenwood was United\u2019s brightest player, as he continued to pop up in and around Robert S\u00e1nchez\u2019s goal.\n\nThe sign of United\u2019s desperate times came on the hour when Solskj\u00e6r replaced the toothless Tahith Chong for James, whose impact was instant, laying off a pass to Greenwood whose shot forced S\u00e1nchez to concede a corner.\n\nThen United had the breakthrough and Brandon Williams, on his debut aged 19, was instrumental. He found Pereira, who relayed the ball to Jesse Lingard: Greenwood took over, and it was 1-0. Yet now came the twist as Matheson raced in from the right and buried a finish past Sergio Romero and penalties beckoned.\n\nRathbone finished disappointed but proud. \u201cIt was amazing We were expecting to get drummed here. We did really well,\u201d he said. Solskj\u00e6r added: \u201cYou know we\u2019re better in penalty shootouts than in proper games.\u201d He was joking yet some fans may be worried that such a jest is now true of their team.", "description": "Rochdale\u2019s 16-year-old Luke Matheson equalised Mason Greenwood\u2019s strike to send the Carabao Cup third-round tie to a penalty shootout, which Manchester United won 5-3", "authors": ["Jamie Jackson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bec26238f766f5acb52b934fcd297903cbc98cf7/0_35_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6d575ecd9efa7ac77ac011f4ba579480", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
