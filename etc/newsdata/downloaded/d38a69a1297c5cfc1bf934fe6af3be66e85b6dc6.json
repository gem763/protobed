Luis, from East Sussex, currently needs at least four hours of treatment and more than 20 tablets per day. Luis Walker has spent his whole life in and out of hospital with painful lung infections and other symptoms of cystic fibrosis But he will start taking Orkambi within the next few weeks, helping his breathing by reducing the build-up of mucus in his lungs and giving him more energy to play with friends and go to school. His mother Christina said yesterday: 'There are families across the country now hugging their children with renewed hope. 'I'm really hoping to see a fairly quick easing in his ability to breathe. We've waited four years for this drug. Very sadly people have died during that time. I just urge that lessons are learned.'\n\n'Her reaction speaks a thousand words. Thank you.' She tagged Health Secretary Matt Hancock, NHS England, The Cystic Fibrosis Trust and Vertex.\n\nUp to 5,000 patients in England will benefit from three \u00a3104,000-a-year pill after the deal with Boston-based maker Vertex.\n\nThe deal is thought to be in excess of half a billion pounds and gives NHS England access to the medication for five years.\n\nOrkambi and two other drugs that were also approved - Symkevi and Kalydeco \u2013 slow the decline of lung function, the main cause of death in cystic fibrosis.\n\nMr Hancock hailed the news as 'wonderful' and said the drugs will 'improve thousands of lives', adding the deal was 'great value for money'.\n\nHe said: 'This deal - on the back of several others this summer - shows why we get some of the best value drugs in the world, and is another reason to be so proud of our NHS.'\n\nCystic fibrosis charities described it as a 'very special day' for patients and their families who have campaigned for years for the drugs.\n\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock hailed the news as 'wonderful' and said the drugs will 'improve thousands of lives'\n\nWHAT IS CYSTIC FIBROSIS? Cystic fibrosis is an incurable genetic disease that affects around 70,000 people worldwide. A defective gene causes a build-up of mucus in the airways, making it increasingly difficult to breathe over time. Mucus also blocks the natural release of digestive enzymes, meaning the body does not break down food as it should. Signs and symptoms: A persistent cough that produces thick mucus (sputum)\n\nWheezing\n\nBreathlessness\n\nExercise intolerance\n\nRepeated lung infections\n\nInflamed nasal passages or a stuffy nose While healthy people cough naturally, that does not happen for people with CF. Eventually, lung function depletes to the point that sufferers will need a double lung transplant to survive.

When we stand together and take on the powerful, we win.'\n\nIt comes after more than 117,000 people signed a petition calling on the Government to make Orkambi available on the NHS.", "description": "Beth Finn, from Staffordshire, yesterday recorded her daughter Isabelle's jubilation at NHS England agreeing a deal for Orkambi after four years of deadlock.", "authors": ["Stephen Matthews Health Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/10/20172318-0-image-a-36_1571994294801.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
