Instead, more Americans describe themselves as politically incorrect, feminists, gun enthusiasts, proud Americans, and progressives than they do socialists.\n\nNew Selzer/Grinnell College poll-\n\nWhich of these terms best describe you:\n\n89% Proud to be an American\n\n87% Tired of the circus in politics\n\n70% Believer in America First\n\n54% Progressive\n\n41% Gun enthusiast\n\n38% Feminist\n\n33% Politically incorrect\n\n19% Socialist \u2014 Ryan James Girdusky (@RyanGirdusky) October 29, 2019\n\nThe poll details how increasingly, Americans identify as believers in America First. For example, in September, about 66 percent of likely voters said they believed in America First. In about one month, the total of likely voters describing themselves as America First believers jumped four percentage points.\n\nA March survey by Harvard/Harris found similar results when U.S. voters were asked their opinions on specific policy questions and whether they side with Trump\u2019s America First doctrine on the issues, Breitbart News reported.\n\nIn that survey, about three-in-four voters favor the nationalist-populist America First doctrine on issues like immigration, trade, and foreign policy. The findings were the latest evidence that the open borders, globalization, and endless wars ideology of former administrations \u2014 such as President George W. Bush\u2019s \u2014 have little-to-no support with American voters.\n\nThe poll was conducted between October 17 to October 23 and included more than 1,000 U.S. adults over the age of 18-years-old \u2014 806 of which are likely voters. The poll has a margin of error of +/- 3.1 percentage points.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
