Unlike sweet maduros, which are made with very ripe, almost black, yellow plantains, savory tostones are made with unripe green plantains. Tostones are fried twice: The first fry sears the cut sides of the plantains, establishing a base layer of color; the second fry ensures that every edge is golden and crunchy. Tostoneras, wooden tools designed to create the perfect tostone shape, come in handy here, but a flat-bottomed cup will do just fine in its place.", "description": "A staple dish throughout the Caribbean and Latin America, tostones are crisp, flattened plantains that are often served as appetizers and side dishes Unlike sweet maduros, which are made with very ripe, almost black, yellow plantains, savory tostones are made with unripe green plantains Tostones are fried twice: The first fry sears the cut sides of the plantains, establishing a base layer of color; the second fry ensures that every edge is golden and crunchy", "authors": ["Kiera Wright-Ruiz", "Lidey Heuck", "Colu Henry", "Sam Sifton", "Samantha Seneviratne", "Claire Saffitz", "Samin Nosrat", "Melissa Clark"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/03/dining/kwr-tostones/merlin_161590410_e9698edc-b306-4d49-8a92-88fba092a627-articleLarge.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
