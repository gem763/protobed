The fare for the round-trip is one shilling and sixpence (7.5p). A spiritual and abstinent man, Cook organised the trip to attend a Temperance meeting. But for many of the participants, the attraction was the opportunity to travel by train for the first time.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n1855: Cook goes international\n\nThe international exposition in Paris, set in the dramatic surroundings of Baron Haussmann\u2019s newly redrawn city, provided the perfect target for Thomas Cook\u2019s first international expedition. The steadily rising incomes and increased aspirations of the middle classes brought about by the industrial revolution convinced Cook that there would be a market for trips from London to Paris.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It coincides with the opening of the London Underground, the world\u2019s first subterranean railway.\n\n1874: Cheque it out\n\n\u201cCook\u2019s Circular Note,\u201d the prototype of the traveller\u2019s cheque, is launched \u2013 providing a safe and easy way to carry funds abroad.\n\n1892: Next generation\n\nThomas Cook dies in Leicester. The business is taken on by his son, John Mason Cook \u2013 whose initials are later used for a rebrand of the firm\u2019s package holidays (an experiment which is swiftly and expensively reversed).\n\n1928: Up for sale\n\nThe last two Cooks, Thomas\u2019s grandsons Frank and Ernest, retire. They sell the business to the first of many outside owners, the railway sleeping car firm Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits.\n\n1948: Nationalisation\n\nDuring the nationalisation of the UK\u2019s railways, Thomas Cook somewhat bizarrely also becomes state-owned. Two years later, the first, embryonic mass-market package holidays by air are sold by a young man called Vladimir Raitz \u2013 comprising flights from Gatwick to Corsica, a tent on a beach and non-rationed meals.\n\n1972: Staying the course\n\nThomas Cook reverts to the private sector, with the Midland Bank, hoteliers Trust House Forte and the Automobile Association buying the firm. Two years, the economic gloom of the \u201cThree-day Week\u201d precipitated by a miners\u2019 strike, amplified by the Middle East oil crisis, finished off many travel companies. But not Thomas Cook.\n\n1992: New owners\n\nA German consortium, comprising Westdeutsche Landesbank and the LTU Group, acquire the Thomas Cook Group.\n\n2019: It's all over\n\nThe Thomas Cook Group, by now an Anglo-German firm, ceases trading at 2am on Monday, 23 September", "description": "As we say goodbye to the world\u2019s oldest tour operator, here are the most important years in Thomas Cook\u2019s illustrious history.", "authors": ["Simon Calder"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/07/12/18/Thomas-Cook.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
