Wives and children were due to converge on Toyota this morning but, as World Rugby announced their decision at midday local time, confusion reigned. The heartbreak turned into anger.\n\nParisse momentarily snapped at a reporter who asked about his cap haul \u2014 'I don't care about records,' he said \u2014 and went on to criticise the governing body.\n\n'We know there are typhoons in this part of the world so where is the plan B?\n\n'I don't understand the decision. It's really wrong. It's not like it's 15 days of typhoons. It's one day. Why couldn't we play on Friday? Or Sunday? Or move?'\n\nLegendary Italian captain was supposed to bid farewell against New Zealand in pool clash\n\nItaly still had an chance of reaching the quarter-finals if they had beaten New Zealand.\n\n'They think this game has no big influence,' added Parisse. 'Of course safety is the priority, but maybe they say: 'New Zealand versus Italy \u2014 eight million times New Zealand are gonna win'. Maybe one time in eight million that will be different but we don't have an opportunity to try. This is why we play.\n\n'Some people are saying Italy should be happy to get a draw. That's bull. If England must win against France to qualify, would they say \"draw\" and send England back home? I don't think so. Ireland? No. New Zealand? No. I promise you that. When you realise it's maybe your last ever game or think how much effort you've made to be here, it's tough.'\n\nYounger players, who will probably get another chance in four years, gathered around the media session to hear what Parisse and Conor O'Shea had to say. The head coach paid a heartfelt tribute.\n\n'What a way to finish,' said an impassioned O'Shea, his voice tremoring at times. 'We've been preparing for this since June 2. Sacrificing family life for four months. For it to end like this \u2014 it's hard. It's difficult to speak about.\n\nConor O'Shea's side are upset and Leonardo Ghiraldini (right) broke down at the bad news\n\nAlessandro Zanni (carrier) is another with more than 100 caps to be robbed of his last game\n\n'I saw the reaction at the end of training and it was horrible. You've got guys who have given their lives to Italian rugby and they've finished on a training pitch in Toyota. Win or lose, these guys have always come back for more.\n\n'One hundred per cent, these are the guys that kept Italian rugby alive. They went through all the pain and kept on coming back for more. They're unbelievable men and I find it really hard for them. I hope the young guys see their legacy and want to be like them, as people as much as players. If young guys like Jake Polledri become half the player Sergio is, Italy will be fine.'\n\nThe question now is 'What next?' Italy are due to fly home on Monday but on Thursday afternoon they had no idea whether they were meant to check out of their hotel.\n\nIn the longer term, Parisse has some thinking to do. He wants to return for a farewell Test in Rome during the Six Nations but, as Typhoon Hagibis has showed, anything can happen.\n\n'I don't want to finish like this,' said Parisse, 36, who will be remembered as one of the great rugby players. 'I don't want to finish because some guys in a room make a decision. I don't want to say I finished my career because of a typhoon.\n\nParisse admitted that he does not have the same verve anymore and new blood is needed\n\n'I'm honest, I've given everything I can give to the Italian jersey over 17 years. Physically and mentally. I don't have the same physical energy as when I was 25 years old. When you see the young guys in this team, they deserve to play and take my place. I don't have any more progress.\n\n'Now it's important that I take a step away and leave these guys to play. That's what's best for the team. I would like to play one last game at home in Italy. The Six Nations is the next competition so I will go home, rest and talk about that with the Federation.\n\n'There was a big chance this would be my last game if it went ahead. I wanted to play with Leo and Ale. We grew up playing together. We came in as youngsters. Just walking on the moon.\n\n'We played great rugby, average rugby and not-so-great rugby but we're all really proud. This was like the final for us. The last one.'", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Once the news of Typhoon Hagibis had been confirmed, the collateral damage began to rip through the heart of the Italian team room.
