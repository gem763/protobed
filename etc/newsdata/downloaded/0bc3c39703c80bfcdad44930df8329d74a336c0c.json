Fortunately for me the rest is in the past and I\u2019m moving forward. But please have a skin check.\u2019\n\nMr Glossop continued: \u2018Going through that was scary at first, but then once they said \u201cif we can get this skin graft done, we think you\u2019ll be in the clear\u201d, it was more dealing with the fact I\u2019d have fairly significant scars.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a common perception that melanoma, although can be deadly, can be removed pretty easily and there\u2019s only a small scar.\u2019\n\nThe Glossops are urging the public to be more conscious of Melanoma (Picturer: Ryan Glossop/Facebook)\n\nA strip of skin reportedly 40cm long and 8cm wide was taken from his legs to cover the patch of his neck and back (Picture: A little beauty/Facebook)\n\nAfter his diagnosis in November 2018, Mr Glossop had around 40 biopsies of his neck and back, one of his lung and then four surgeries on the area.\n\nHis latest surgery, in May, involved the removal of a large strips of skin from his neck and legs.\n\nIn a Facebook post, wife Fallon explained: \u2018With any skin cancer, not only do they remove the affected area of skin, but they also take a boundary around it.\n\nMum found clutching dead daughter, 8, in car boot after killing her to spite ex\n\n\u2018Ryan\u2019s boundaries kept coming back abnormal, which was then found to be a skin condition called Nevus Spilus. It\u2019s very rare for it to transition into melanoma, but in his case it did.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018In May 2019 a large area of skin from his neck and back needed to be taken. So in his 4th surgery, Ryan had a skin graft, removing skin from both legs to cover (the) section on his neck and back.\u2019\n\nPraising his strength, she went on: \u2018This whole experience has been hugely challenging for all of us, but if anything good is to come out of this, it is that we now want to help raise more awareness of skin cancer.\n\n\u2018Melanoma accounts for 10 per cent of all skin cancers, which is why it is so important that everyone has regular skin checks.\n\n\u2018Your life is too precious to just bake yourself in the sun and not worry about your skin.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
