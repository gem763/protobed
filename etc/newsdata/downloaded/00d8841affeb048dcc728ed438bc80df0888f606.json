Here's what parents need to know", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE A petition that already has over 60,000 signatures aims to move Halloween from October 31 to the last Saturday of the month. USA TODAY\n\nA group working to change the date of Halloween was dividing the country, so instead, it opted to create a new \"holiday\" \u2013 National Trick or Treat Day.\n\nThe Halloween & Costume Association\u2019s petition originally intended to move Halloween to the last Saturday of October but evolved into an additional day of celebration after it faced some opposition. Now it has more 150,000 signatures and is backed by Party City.\n\nThe day has also made it on the National Day Calendar. This, the group says, makes the day officially official. At least as official as it can get.\n\nAccording to the National Day Calendar website, there is an application process for \"brands, nonprofits, and corporations to register an official National Day that aligns with their product or service.\"\n\nFor reference, the site also lists in November a National Deviled Egg Day, National Chicken Lady Day and National Pizza with the Works Except Anchovies Day.\n\nStill, the Halloween & Costume Association has good intentions \u2013 to increase safety for children and help parents navigate a late-night holiday that often lands on a school night.\n\nHere's what parents need to know about the new holiday, with some help from Aneisha McMillan, who does marketing for the HCA.\n\nWhat is National Trick or Treat Day?\n\nNational Trick or Treat Day (NTTD) is a day for families and communities to come together by \"throwing block parties, community events, costume contests, parades, walks and runs, trunk-or-treating and daytime trick-or-treating as well,\" McMillan tells USA TODAY.\n\n\"NTTD is just an additional day to celebrate Halloween.\" The group is also referring to it as \"ALLoween.\"\n\nWhen is National Trick or Treat Day?\n\nThe last Saturday of October. For Halloween 2019, that is Oct. 26.\n\nThe Halloween & Costume Association notes that late-night trick-or-treating can be dangerous.

Also, for most people, they wouldn't have to worry about working that day or the day following,\" one wrote as their reason for signing the petition.\n\nMORE HALLOWEEN:\n\nDoes this mean we should be prepared to pass out candy on two days?\n\nNot necessarily. McMillan says there \"are no rules\" to NTTD and they are leaving celebrations up to neighborhoods, cities and communities. Just as city officials set trick-or-treating hours for Halloween night, cities have the ability to decide what's best. In fact, some cities have changed trick-or-treating times due to inclement weather. This is the same concept.\n\nThe Halloween & Costume Association is encouraging events and activities on National Trick or Treat Day, the last Saturday in October.

Parents and caregivers should check with area officials for any changes to trick-or-treating hours in their area.\n\nCould the actual date of Halloween ever change?\n\nProbably not. Halloween is not a federally-recognized holiday. The spooky tradition originated with the \"ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, where people would light bonfires and wear costumes to ward off ghosts,\" according to a History.com post detailing the history and evolution of Halloween.\n\nIf a U.S. president was so moved to change the date of Halloween, it would require the government passing a bill to make Halloween a federal holiday, then, of course, setting the date to be the last Saturday of October.\n\nBottom line: It's unlikely to happen, but that doesn't mean you can't celebrate the tradition whenever you want \u2013 though your neighbors might be confused when you show up at their door in costume asking for candy in July.\n\nHappy Hallo-trick-or-treat-o-ween!\n\nFollow the latest from USA TODAY Parenting at usatoday.com/life/parenting.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/parenting/2019/10/23/national-trick-treat-day-new-halloween-thing-what-know/4064258002/", "description": "The group trying to change the date of Halloween, instead created a new holiday: National Trick or Treat Day.
