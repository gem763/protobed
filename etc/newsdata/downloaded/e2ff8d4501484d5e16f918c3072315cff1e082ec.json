(Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a resolution Tuesday declaring the National Rifle Association a \u201cdomestic terrorist organization\u201d and urging the city to examine its financial relationships with companies that do business with the group.\n\nThe sharply worded declaration noted recent acts of gun violence, including the July shooting that killed three people, all younger than 26, at a food festival in Gilroy, Calif., south of San Francisco.\n\n\u201cThe National Rifle Association musters its considerable wealth and organizational strength to promote gun ownership and incite gun owners to acts of violence,\u201d it read. \u201cThe National Rifle Association spreads propaganda that misinforms and aims to deceive the public about the dangers of gun violence, and \u2026 the leadership of National Rifle Association promotes extremist positions, in defiance of the views of a majority of its membership and the public, and undermine the general welfare.\u201d\n\n[NRA money flowed to board members amid allegedly lavish spending by top officials and vendors]\n\nThe resolution, adopted unanimously by the board\u2019s 11 supervisors, notes many of the statistics that make the United States stand out in terms of gun violence, stating that the country\u2019s gun homicide rate is \u201c25 times higher than any other high-income country in the world\u201d and that 36,000 people in the United States die in gun-related incidents every year, an average of 100 per day.\n\nIt also said the city would assess its financial and contractual relationships with vendors that do business with the NRA.\n\n\u201cThe City and County of San Francisco should take every reasonable step to limit those entities who do business with the City and County of San Francisco from doing business with this domestic terrorist organization,\u201d it noted.\n\nThe news of its passage quickly drew attention from conservatives and right-leaning media outlets.\n\nSupervisor Catherine Stefani told reporters that she had decided to write the declaration after the shooting at the Gilroy Garlic Festival. A gunman there killed a 6-year-old, a 13-year-old and a 25-year-old before taking his own life. The mass shooting was followed within days by massacres in El Paso, where a gunman killed 22 people, and Dayton, Ohio, where a man killed nine people.\n\n\u201cThe NRA conspires to limit gun violence research, restrict gun violence data sharing and most importantly aggressively tries to block every piece of sensible gun violence prevention legislation proposed on any level, local state or federal,\u201d Stefani said, according to KQED. \u201cWhen they use phrases like, \u2018I\u2019ll give you my gun when you pry it from my cold, dead hands\u2019 on bumper stickers, they are saying reasoned debate about public safety should be met with violence.\u201d\n\nStefani told The Washington Post that she believed the group had earned the designation as a \u201cterrorist organization.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey should reasonably know by now that they are fueling the hate fire in this country,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are dying, and they continue to stand in the way of reform.\u201d\n\nAmy Hunter, a spokeswoman for the NRA, called the resolution a \u201creckless assault on a law-abiding organization, its members and the freedoms they all stand for.\u201d\n\n[NRA shakes up legal team amid intensifying civil war]\n\n\u201cThis is just another worthless and disgusting \u2018sound bite remedy\u2019 to the violence epidemic gripping our nation,\u201d she said. \u201cWe remain undeterred \u2014 guided by our values and belief in those who want to find real solutions to gun violence.\u201d\n\nThe NRA has been at the center of political tensions in recent years as horrific acts of gun violence continue to regularly punctuate the political conversation. New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, is investigating the group\u2019s finances over its tax-exempt status as a nonprofit group.\n\nLawrence B. Glickman, professor of history at Cornell University, said it was unusual for governments to orchestrate boycotts of private entities.\n\n\u201cMunicipalities in the era of the American Revolution called for ostracism or boycotting of individuals who violated the non-importation movement by using, for example, British tea,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cThose might be the clearest antecedents for the SF Board of Supervisors decision.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nA noose was found hanging in a University of Illinois elevator.
