The claims include racketeering, invasion of privacy and fraud.\n\nIt claims that as soon as they heard she was writing a book in 2016 that included details about the alleged sexual assault, Mr Weinstein and his team attempted to ensure the book was never published.\n\nShe alleged that Mr Weinstein recruited Black Cube to obtain information on the book by posing as an advocate for women.\n\nThe suit says: \"This case is about a diabolical and illegal effort by one of America's most powerful men and his representatives to silence sexual-assault victims. And it is about the courageous women and journalists who persisted to reveal the truth.\"\n\nEric George, attorney for Ms Bloom told AFP news agency: \"There is simply no credible factual or legal basis for her claims against my client. We look forward to our day in court to set the record straight.\"\n\nMr Weinstein's lawyer told the Hollywood Reporter that the allegations against him were \"baseless.\"\n\nRose McGowan's book Brave was published last year and included details on the alleged abuse and how Harvey Weinstein \"poisoned the film and television industry.\"", "description": "The actress files a lawsuit alleging Harvey Weinstein and his team conspired to discredit her.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1512/production/_109349350_043941727-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
