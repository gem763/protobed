(AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth, file)\n\nCtrl + N\n\nIt's official: Politicians have protected status on Facebook.\n\nIf they violate the company's policies by posting misinformation, hoaxes, or hate speech, Facebook generally won't intervene.\n\nThat's direct from Nick Clegg, Facebook's vice president of global affairs and communications, who said in a blog post yesterday that moving forward, it will treat speech from politicians \"as newsworthy content that should, as a general rule, be seen and heard.\" The company also confirmed that it exempts politicians' speech from its third-party fact-checking program.\n\nThis answered a long-running question about what the company planned to do about President Trump, who is known for spreading conspiracy theories or hateful remarks on social media that appear to break the rules. But its hands-off approach raises new questions about whether the company is serious about keeping its platform safe from adversaries seeking to exploit it for political gain.\n\nFor its part, Clegg insists the company's responsibility is to stop outside interference and be transparent about political ads, but not to intervene when politicians speak. \"To use tennis as an analogy, our job is to make sure the court is ready \u2013 the surface is flat, the lines painted, the net at the correct height,\" Clegg said at the Atlantic Ideas Festival.. \"But we don\u2019t pick up a racket and start playing. How the players play the game is up to them, not us.\"\n\nThe company's hands-off approach received swift blowback.\n\nFrom Kevin Roose of the New York Times:\n\nIt\u2019s a good thing no politicians have ever run Facebook disinformation campaigns in order to tip elections or sow division, that\u2019d be bad. https://t.co/loW42vxplA \u2014 Kevin Roose (@kevinroose) September 24, 2019\n\nFrom Fabio Chiusi, a project manager at Algorithm Watch, a non-profit research and advocacy organization:\n\nThis is possibly the worst of all policy decisions on Facebook\u2019s part: \u201cvalued political customers\u201d should be subject to special, more (not less) stringent policy enforcement criteria \u2014 as they have a bigger responsibility to the public in terms of truth, dignity and trust. https://t.co/z2JOUbi2xx \u2014 Fabio Chiusi (@fabiochiusi) September 25, 2019\n\nFacebook's formal policy extends far beyond the U.S. commander-in-chief, and it applies to all elected officials and people running for office around the world, at the executive, national and regional level.\n\nYet the Trump factor is undeniable: Ahead of the 2016 election, Deepa Seetharaman at the Wall Street Journal reported that some of Trump's posts on Facebook sparked debates within the company about how the company should treat posts from politicians. Employees argued some of Trump's posts about the Muslim ban should be removed for violating the company's hate speech policies, but Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg decided not to remove the posts.\n\nTwitter has also faced criticism for not taking action against the president's tweets that could violate its policies on hate speech. The company announced earlier this year that it would begin labeling tweets from leaders that would otherwise be removed from the service. But it's unclear how Twitter is going to enforce this new policy. Twitter said in July that a tweet from Trump telling several Democratic lawmakers to \"go back\" to their countries that prompted widespread allegations of racism against women of color did not violate its policies. But independent researchers struggled to see why that wouldn't break its rules on racist content.\n\nThere are some exceptions to the new rules: Facebook will still subject ads from politicians to its community standards, and the company says it will remove posts from politicians that have the potential to incite violence. Facebook promised to weigh the public interest of a post against the potential harm, and it promised to consider many factors about a country's political environment when making that decision. Facebook's calculations for example could be different in a country that does not have a free press -- and could not easily challenge a politician's claim. If a politician shares a link, photo, or video that the company's fact checkers already debunked, the company will demote the post and include any additional information from the fact-checkers.\n\nClegg acknowledged the company's position would be controversial. He anticipated people would say the company is wrong to give politicians a pass on nasty or false claims, but he said the reverse could potentially be much more damaging.\n\n\"Would it be acceptable to society at large to have a private company in effect become a self-appointed referee for everything that politicians say?\" he said. \"I don\u2019t believe it would be.\"\n\nAlex Stamos, former Facebook chief security officer, also pushed back on critics, asking when it would be appropriate for the \"spectacularly powerful\" company to censor speech of candidates in a Democratic election. From Twitter:\n\nSo who, specifically? And who gets that power?\n\n\n\nThe \"these companies should control political speech by politicians in democracies\" argument is completely incompatible with everything the same proponents say about antitrust, platform power and unaccountable executives. \u2014 Alex Stamos (@alexstamos) September 24, 2019\n\nYou are reading The Technology 202, our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.

(Rich Pedroncelli/AP)\n\nBITS: The activist behind California's groundbreaking consumer privacy law wants to go even further in holding tech giants accountable with a newly unveiled ballot proposal for 2020, my colleague Tony Romm reports. The ballot initiative could bring round two of a high-stakes battle between Silicon Valley tech giants and consumer privacy advocates.\n\nThe proposal from Alastair Mactaggart, the millionaire behind the initiative that eventually morphed into the California Consumer Privacy Act, goes well beyond the protections outlined in the new law. Not only would it give users greater power over how companies collect and sell their personal data including location and financial records, it would create a new state agency to enforce the law, Tony reports. The law would also break open the black-box nature of how companies use data to determine employment prospects, financial services or even shape election results by requiring companies to explain their algorithms to users.\n\nThe new initiative will need a million signatures to make it onto the 2020 ballot, but its unforgiving stance against tech giants probably will result in an all-out lobbying assault from the industry well before then.\n\nAdam Neumann speaks.

We Work's Adam Neumann stepped down as CEO under pressure, the company confirmed today after a Wall Street Journal report. Neumann will stay as nonexecutive chairman of the board, my colleague Marie C. Baca reports.\n\n\u201cWhile our business has never been stronger, in recent weeks, the scrutiny directed toward me has become a significant distraction,\u201d Neumann said in a statement. \u201cI have decided that it is in the best interest of the company to step down.\u201d The company's former co-president and chief financial officer Artie Minson and vice chairman Sebastian Gunningham will serve as co-CEOs.\n\nThe rapid removal of Neumann is a stark reversal of the company's previous stance that Neumann's leadership was crucial to its success.

The revelation comes as Sprint and T-Mobile try to close on a $26.5 billion merger, a decision that will require FCC approval, CNN's Brian Fung reports.\n\nThe company failed to report that nearly 900,000 of the customers it claimed monthly credits for didn't use Lifeline, the subsidized service, the FCC reports. The subscribers in question represent nearly 10 percent of the Lifeline program\u2019s subscriber base \u2014 making it potentially one of the largest cases of abuse of the program. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai called the abuse a \u201ccareless disregard for program rules and American taxpayers\u201d and said the agency will investigate the matter.\n\nDemocratic Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel said on Twitter the agency should \"throw the book\" at Sprint.\n\nWhen companies abuse the Lifeline program we should throw the book at them.\n\n\n\nHere's what we shouldn't do: Kick off the millions of seniors, veterans, and domestic violence shelters nationwide that rely on this program to stay connected.https://t.co/idkLjtvEck \u2014 Jessica Rosenworcel (@JRosenworcel) September 24, 2019\n\nSprint denied any intentional wrongdoing to CNN, attributing the mistake to a change in the program's guidelines in 2016.
