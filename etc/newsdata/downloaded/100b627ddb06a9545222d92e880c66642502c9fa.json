The OpsChain Public Finance Manager (PFM) system enables transparent tracking of public budgets and expenditures viewable by all citizens.\n\nPFM will also reportedly enable public funds to be matched with outcomes, which in turn would provide insight into how effective different policies are.\n\nEnabling data-driven policy decisions\n\nThe system can reportedly track government public funds as they move through different state agencies. According to EY, data provided by the platform can potentially be used to better inform future policy decisions.\n\nEY said:\n\n\u201cBlockchain technology can positively impact processes from tax collection to open data to public spending. [...] Modern public financial management requires focusing on the things that matter most \u2014 transparency, accountability and robust evidence for decision-making \u2014 all factors that can be enhanced by blockchain technology.\u201d\n\nPilot testing in Toronto\n\nEY also reportedly already tested tracking public funds on a blockchain in multiple places, including the Canadian city of Toronto. The system reported financial transfers between different government divisions, and the firm claims that the experiment increased the city\u2019s transparency and efficiency.\n\nChief financial officer of the city of Toronto Heather Taylor said:\n\n\u201cWith a commitment to championing the economic, social and environmental vitality of the city of Toronto, our officials strive to implement technologies that best help us meet our residents\u2019 evolving needs.\u201d\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported in April, the United States federal government is expected to raise its blockchain spending to $123.5 million by 2022.", "description": "Auditing giant EY launched OpsChain Public Finance Manager, a blockchain platform for tracking public funds aiming to enhance transparency", "authors": ["Adrian Zmudzinski"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvNTZlYzg3MmYzMjRlOGFhY2E0ZWRlMGVhMzRkZjNkY2EuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
