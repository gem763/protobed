This reduction would be driven especially by bigger turbines, some measuring almost as high as the Eiffel tower, and lower financing costs.\n\nIn Europe, offshore wind will soon beat new natural gas-fired capacity on cost and be on a par with solar photovoltaics (PV) and onshore wind while in China, it is set to become competitive with new coal-fired capacity around 2030, according to the IEA.\n\nHowever, Birol cautioned that large investments into onshore grid infrastructure and real political action were needed.\n\n\"If the governments are serious about their climate policies and climate neutrality they have to have dedicated policies in order to foster green technologies like offshore wind\".\n\nWhile the green transition is increasingly taking over the global political agenda, there is a growing disconnect between climate ambitions and real-life emissions trends as energy-related CO2 emissions reached a historic high last year.\n\nThe UK today has the biggest capacity but by around 2025, China is likely to have the largest offshore wind fleet. The industry is also growing in markets like the United States, Taiwan and Japan.\n\nDenmark's Orsted is the world's biggest developer of offshore wind, while Siemens Gamesa and MHI Vestas, a joint venture between Vestas and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, are the largest makers of wind turbines employed at sea.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Energy & Commodities - [COPENHAGEN] Offshore wind could become a cornerstone of the world's power supply as steep cost reductions and improved technology unleash the potential of the green energy source, said the International Energy Agency (IEA) on Friday. .
