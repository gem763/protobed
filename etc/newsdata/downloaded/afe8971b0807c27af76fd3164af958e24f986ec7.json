The former German minister will have a 25 sq m (269 sq ft) living space that already has a sleeping area and running water.\n\nSpeaking after the German newspaper Die Welt reported the story, a commission spokesperson said: \u201cWe can confirm that the president-elect would like to use an existing personal retreat next to the president\u2019s office to stay overnight during her days in Brussels.\u201d Sources said some slight adaptations may be needed but declined to elaborate.\n\nAs Germany\u2019s defence minister, Von der Leyen also lived at her ministry in Berlin, an arrangement that is more common in German politics. But the \u201coffice-residence\u201d is less typical in Brussels, where commissioners and travelling MEPs often rent apartments or rooms in the city\u2019s many aparthotels.\n\nJean-Claude Juncker, who stands down at the end of this month, likes to stress that the commission president does not have an official residence.\n\nIn a recent interview with the German newspaper Bild am Sonntag, he revealed that he lived in a 50 sq m aparthotel in the working week, suggesting it was not ideal for a president. \u201cI couldn\u2019t invite anyone home. I can\u2019t talk to official visitors sitting on my bed,\u201d he said.\n\nSources described the president-elect\u2019s living space as modest and said it would cut costs on room rental and security, as the Berlaymont is tightly guarded around the clock. The arrangement will also keep von der Leyen out of the Brussels traffic jams that snarl up main roads during rush hour.\n\nShe may run the risk of unwelcome visitors, however: the occasional mouse has been seen scurrying though commission corridors, albeit not on the 13th floor, which has commanding views of the city.\n\nJack Parrock (@jackeparrock) Filming interview with @eherreracaro earlier in #Berlaymont @EU_Commission we saw a little #mouse and it turns out he made it on cam \u2198 pic.twitter.com/buIp2Xy4bT\n\nThe EU\u2019s 28 European commissioners and their senior advisers work at the star-shaped Berlaymont headquarters, as does the chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier. The building, which owes its name to the Dames du Berlaymont convent that once stood on the land, has been the venue for Brexit negotiations since talks began in June 2017.\n\nVon der Leyen, who is due to take office on 1 November, is the daughter of one of Europe\u2019s first civil servants. Born in Brussels, she attended the European School in Uccle, although she did not overlap with another notable graduate, Alexander Boris De Pfeffel Johnson. She studied economics, then medicine, building a home and a medical career near Hanover.", "description": "Ursula von der Leyen will have tiny flat next to study, partly to avoid heavy Brussels traffic", "authors": ["Jennifer Rankin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc6a3d6c966b9b5686c9edd4cd6a4e6de715c4c8/450_117_2707_1625/master/2707.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5e53e4a32b65cd320c27bca308e5ed9e"}
