It was there that the incident that reshaped his life took place, on July 30, 1955.\n\nMr. Mayes ran into a friend, Sgt. Henry C. Saunders, who told Mr. Mayes that he was heading to town from the base shortly, and invited him to come. Mr. Mayes said he would change clothes and join him.\n\nSergeant Saunders said he had a particular reason to go to town: He was carrying a gun, a personal weapon not issued by the Army, and he wanted to get rid of it.\n\nThe sergeant tucked the small pistol, a .22-caliber revolver, into the inside pocket of his sport coat and entered the base club for noncommissioned officers like himself \u2014 known as the N.C.O. Club \u2014 for a cheeseburger. He was sitting with other sergeants, including one who had been promoted that very day, Sgt. James W. Emery, 21.\n\nSergeant Emery was celebrating. (\u201cYou won\u2019t deny that you had eight or 10 beers, do you?\u201d he was asked later, to which he replied, \u201cI may have had.\u201d) It was 7:30 p.m.\n\nMr. Mayes entered the club and found Sergeant Saunders. Sergeant Emery noticed the private in a place where privates weren\u2019t welcome, and, goaded by the older sergeants around him, rose to tell him as much.\n\nThe scuffle that followed would be hazily recalled later among its three or four principals, the details lost to the heat of the moment and to the beer. Sergeant Emery and Mr. Mayes exchanged words and began shoving one another. Sergeant Saunders and another sergeant broke them up, but the two resumed wresting.", "description": "In 1955, a soldier was dishonorably discharged after a shooting in an Army club.
