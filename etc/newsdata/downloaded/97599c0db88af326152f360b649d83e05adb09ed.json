Jerrold Nadler sloughed off the question as mere \u201cnomenclature\u201d as he expanded the rules for the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s investigations into Donald Trump. Nadler still couldn\u2019t give a straight answer to the question, however, and neither could anyone else in the House Democrat caucus:\n\nThursday\u2019s vote, which does not need to be approved by the full House, gives Nadler the ability to deem committee hearings as impeachment hearings. It allows staff to question witnesses at those hearings for an hour after members conclude, gives the President\u2019s lawyers the ability to respond in writing to public testimony and allows the committee to collect information in a closed setting. But the dissonant messages over the probe have prompted frustration among rank-and-file members, particularly those in competitive races wary of impeachment, and it even led to the House\u2019s No. 2 Democrat walking back his statement on the committee\u2019s investigation on Wednesday. \u2026 \u201cThis Committee is engaged in an investigation that will allow us to determine whether to recommend articles of impeachment with respect to President Trump. Some call this process an impeachment inquiry. Some call it an impeachment investigation. There is no legal difference between these terms, and I no longer care to argue about the nomenclature,\u201d the New York Democrat said. \u201cBut let me clear up any remaining doubt: The conduct under investigation poses a threat to our democracy. We have an obligation to respond to this threat. And we are doing so.\u201d\n\nSearch for hours in that statement and you still won\u2019t find an answer in that question. Ranking member Doug Collins offered one up, however, in response to the rule changes. The Judiciary chair, Collins said, was living on \u201cFantasy Island,\u201d and the rules changes don\u2019t mean anything:\n\nBut Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, the committee\u2019s top Republican, said the resolution doesn\u2019t give the committee any more authority than it already had, and the full House has to vote before there are impeachment investigations. Collins described the Democrats\u2019 strategy as \u201cFantasy Island,\u201d going down a yellow brick road like in \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d and like \u201ca giant Instagram filter: To make it appear that something is happening when it\u2019s not.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not in an impeachment inquiry,\u201d Collins said at one point, as he banged the dais in front of him with the side of his hand.\n\nDon\u2019t forget that the House had an opportunity to authorize a formal impeachment inquiry this summer. Rep. Al Green (D-TX) used a privileged motion mechanism to force a full floor vote by the House, which failed by a 95-332 vote. Nevertheless, Nadler has been trying to sell Judiciary\u2019s investigations as \u201cformal impeachment proceedings,\u201d which the House explicitly rejected and his own party\u2019s leadership keeps dodging.\n\nCNN\u2019s Manu Raju tried to get Nadler to explain that, but Nadler waved him off after the hearing:\n\nAsked if he had any concerns that Pelosi has yet to call what House Judiciary is doing an impeachment inquiry, Nadler told me: \"I'm not going to answer that.\" pic.twitter.com/w6VLuqTe6E \u2014 Manu Raju (@mkraju) September 12, 2019\n\nAt least that much is clear \u2014 no one wants to answer it. Why? Because Democrats are trying to mollify their progressive base by going through the motions on impeachment while putting off their moderates and suburban voters by telling them they aren\u2019t conducting an impeachment inquiry. They\u2019re talking out of both sides of their mouths and aren\u2019t happy to be called out for it, as Judiciary member and caucus leader Hakeem Jeffries told the New York Times yesterday:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to get caught in semantics. We all agree, from Speaker Pelosi through every single member of the House Democratic Caucus, that we have a constitutional responsibility to hold an out-of-control executive accountable,\u201d said Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the leader of the Democratic caucus who also sits on the Judiciary Committee. \u201cThat\u2019s what six committees are doing \u2014 not simply the Judiciary Committee \u2014 and the committees should be allowed to do their work without getting involved in semantical distinctions.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s pretty tough to avoid when Nadler and others use the \u201csemantics\u201d of impeachment to expand their authority, even nominally, as happened today. It\u2019s not a semantic argument anyway, but a political and legal issue. If Democrats want to pursue impeachment, then the full House needs to authorize it \u2014 or else explain to their voters why they aren\u2019t going to do it.\n\nFormer Barack Obama adviser Dan Pfeiffer put it plainly yesterday:\n\nThe politics of impeachment are debatable. Maybe they are good. Maybe they aren't. No one knows. But I do know that the current Democratic strategy of telling the base they are impeaching Trump and telling the moderates the opposite is an absolute disaster. \u2014 Dan Pfeiffer (@danpfeiffer) September 11, 2019\n\nTo which another Obama adviser scored an even better point:\n\nMaybe they\u2019re trying to prove to us that they\u2019re too incompetent to conduct impeachment hearings. If so, they\u2019re winning me over! \u2014 Jon Favreau (@jonfavs) September 11, 2019\n\nThe general election is now less than fourteen months away. The clock is running out on impeachment, and in fact may have already on the grounds being pursued by House committees. Without \u201cRussia collusion,\u201d Trump\u2019s win in 2016 was legitimate and removal would be illegitimate. The latter will go nowhere in the Senate anyway. At some point, voters are going to assume that Democrats literally have nothing else to offer except anti-Trump paranoia and rethink their 2020 choices in that context.\n\nAfter all, when you\u2019ve lost MSNBC \u2014 and apparently literally lost them \u2026", "description": "\"Fantasy Island\" is more like it.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/nadler-raju.png"}
