Photo: Stephen Morton/Georgia Port Authority\n\nAn awful lot of Georgians are interested in the U.S. Senate seat that Governor Brian Kemp will fill by year\u2019s end (currently held by Johnny Isakson, who is stepping down with three years left in his term, due to poor health). Seats in the upper chamber don\u2019t open up every day, particularly those one might occupy without actually conducting a campaign. But Kemp, who is the object of all sorts of conspiratorial speculation about whom he might owe the most in making this selection, has decided to throw the door wide open via an application process in which absolutely anyone can answer a brief online questionnaire, attach a r\u00e9sum\u00e9, and get a shot at becoming a member of the world\u2019s greatest deliberative body. Within hours of the questionnaire going up, 158 people had taken advantage of this opportunity, including one remotely viable possibility, radio talk-show host and former Kemp staffer, Martha Zoller.\n\nIf you want to be considered seriously, you might want to drop a couple of key names, like Kemp\u2019s friend President Donald J. Trump or Senator David Perdue, who, along with his cousin Sonny Perdue (U.S. Agriculture secretary and former two-term governor), reportedly engineered the Trump endorsement that helped the self-styled \u201cpolitically incorrect conservative\u201d soundly beat Lieutenant Governor Casey Cagle in the 2018 GOP gubernatorial runoff. Technically Democrats or independents are free to apply, but anyone who makes it to the live interview phase of the process should definitely wear a MAGA hat.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear why Kemp has taken this approach to his appointment decision, but it might be in order to smoke out pols who are trying to keep their options open, as the Atlanta Journal-Constitution\u2019s Greg Bluestein observes:\n\nConsider the cases of Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr or Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, both newly elected Republican officials who could be seen as overly ambitious ladder-climbers if they openly urge Kemp to appoint them only months into their four-year terms.\n\nOr former U.S. Rep. Karen Handel, who would be pilloried by her GOP rivals in Georgia\u2019s 6th Congressional District if she publicly angled for a Senate seat while she\u2019s competing for a rematch against Democrat Lucy McBath in 2020.\n\nNone of them would comment publicly about whether they planned to apply.\n\nApplications aside, there\u2019s already some public lobbying of Kemp underway from factions in the Georgia GOP. A prominent conservative advocacy group called the Georgia Republican Assembly took a straw poll at its recent convention, and then passed a resolution urging the selection of former congressman Paul Broun. In case the name doesn\u2019t ring a bell, Broun cut capers for eight years in the U.S. House before he ran unsuccessfully for the Senate in 2014 (the year David Perdue was elected). He\u2019s a wing nut of the highest order, as best illustrated by a speech he made at the Liberty Baptist Church Sportsman\u2019s Banquet (yes, there was such a thing) in 2012, in which this member of the House Science Committee condemned all sorts of science stuff as the work of Satan:\n\nGiven the high stakes for the national and state GOP based on Isakson\u2019s replacement (who will have to run in a 2020 special election), Kemp is unlikely to look in Broun\u2019s direction, but then the wiggy former congressman could run against Kemp\u2019s choice in that 2020 jungle primary if the appointee is insufficiently out there.\n\nRight now the front-runners are two current GOP congressmen, Doug Collins (Trump\u2019s best friend on the House Judiciary Committee) and Tom Graves (a longtime conservative favorite). But Kemp\u2019s open-mic night is going to generate some good clean fun before the deal goes down:\n\n\u201cThis application process is the wildest contest since the search for golden tickets in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,\u201d said Josh McKoon, a GOP activist and former state senator.", "description": "Georgia governor Brian Kemp set up a wide-open application process for the U.S. Senate seat Kemp will fill when Johnny Isakson steps down at year\u2019s end.
