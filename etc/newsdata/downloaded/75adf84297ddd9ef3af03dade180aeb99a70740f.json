John Bel Edwards has hired a 2016 Hillary Clinton campaign alumnus to help increase Edwards\u2019 voter turnout as the Democrat moves into the general election.\n\nAccording to a campaign email obtained by Breitbart News, Edwards\u2019 campaign has hired Scott Arceneaux, a veteran political activist, to focus on campaign turnout.\n\nEdwards previously hired Arceneaux for the 2015 election runoff against then-Sen. David Vitter (R-LA). Arceneaux also served as a superdelegate for Hillary Clinton between 2015 and 2019. The Clinton campaign brought in Arceneaux to campaign against then-candidate Donald Trump.\n\nArceneaux has faced sharp criticism in the past.\n\nLeslie Wimes, the founder of the Democratic African American Women\u2019s Caucus (DAAWC), wrote in 2015 that Arceneaux undermined black women in Florida when he was the executive director of the Florida Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cYou have to be aware of the underhanded tactics used by Scott Arceneaux to undermine black women in this state. If not, just ask the Association of State Democratic Chairs,\u201d Wimes wrote in an open letter to Hillary Clinton in 2015. \u201cThey know all about it. Oh wait, that has yet to come out \u2014 but it\u2019s coming.\u201d\n\nThe Florida Saint Peters Blog called Arceneaux in 2017 the \u201cEddie Mush of Florida politics,\u201d contending that everything \u201che touched turned to mush.\u201d\n\nThe Florida blog noted that Arceneaux failed to deliver Clinton Florida during the 2016 presidential election, as well as failed to help Andrew Gillum win Florida\u2019s recent gubernatorial election.\n\nEdwards\u2019 hiring of Arceneaux arises as a recent poll found that Republican businessman and GOP gubernatorial nominee Eddie Rispone has tied with Edwards one month before the November 16 election.\n\nA survey conducted by We Ask America found that both Edwards and Rispone have 47 percent support of Louisiana voters.\n\n\u201cWhile still well-regarded with voters, Edwards sits identical to the percentage he received in the primary. Rispone, however, has quickly moved to consolidate the Republican base, and with the national spotlight shining bright on Louisiana, President Trump\u2019s stellar job approval with Louisianans will only serve to help Rispone in the sprint to the runoff next month,\u201d the summary of the survey wrote.\n\n\u201cRispone has quickly moved to secure 80% of self-identifying Republicans and, perhaps more importantly, 85% of former Abraham supporters,\u201d the survey wrote of Rispone. \u201cRispone, like Edwards, also enjoys a positive image in voter\u2019s minds with a 49% having a favorable opinion of him versus 38% having an unfavorable one.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, has done a poor job. NOW HE IS IN A RUNOFF WITH A GREAT REPUBLICAN, @EddieRispone,\u201d Trump wrote of Rispone in October. \u201cThank you, Louisiana! 66% down to 47% after I explained what a bad job the Governor was doing.\u201d\n\nThe Governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, has done a poor job. NOW HE IS IN A RUNOFF WITH A GREAT REPUBLICAN, @EddieRispone. Thank you Louisiana! 66% down to 47% after I explained what a bad job the Governor was doing. \u2014 Donald J.
