He made a valid argument why he should get the shot during his post-fight media rounds, also taking a few shots at \u201cBones\u201d in the process.\n\nJones clearly heard Reyes, because on Saturday he responded to \u201cThe Dominator\u201d for the first time (via Twitter):\n\nMany have talk shit, all have fallen. You will do the same \u2014 Jon Bones Jones (@JonnyBones) October 19, 2019\n\nLet's run it and see who falls. https://t.co/sixcqlq8SV \u2014 Dominick Reyes (@DomReyes) October 19, 2019\n\nIt appears Jones and his team have some level of hesitation about fighting Reyes next, though. Jones\u2019 manager, Abraham Kawa, said he thinks Reyes could still put together a better resume (via Twitter):\n\nReyes is 1-1 in his last 2 i believe. Reyes needs another win first. The W against volkan is ehhhhh most people thought he lost that one. \u2014 Ibrahim Kawa (@Abraham_kawa) October 19, 2019\n\nIf a fight with Reyes isn\u2019t next for Jones, what is? He once again teased a move to heavyweight, naming the winner of the Stipe Miocic vs. Daniel Cormier trilogy as a potential foe (via Twitter):\n\nI should just wait for the winner of DC and Stipe? Let these light heavies figure out who\u2019s going to present the best challenge https://t.co/PfTK5LxrJN \u2014 Jon Bones Jones (@JonnyBones) October 19, 2019\n\nProbably going to need a few months to pack on some muscle anyway \u2014 Jon Bones Jones (@JonnyBones) October 19, 2019\n\nGallery Dominick Reyes def.
