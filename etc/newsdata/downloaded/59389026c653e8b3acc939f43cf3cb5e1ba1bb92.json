This fall, she\u2019ll add suicide prevention and mental health care to her agenda. (Matt Rourke/AP)\n\nThe life-altering phone call came the Saturday morning of Memorial Day weekend.\n\nRep. Susan Wild, a freshman Democrat from this industrial Pennsylvania district, was home preparing for a week of constituent meetings, a town hall and a cookout she and her longtime partner, Kerry Acker, were hosting later that day when he returned from a stay in New York.\n\nBut Wild\u2019s plans for the weekend \u2014 and for her congressional career and life \u2014 changed the minute she answered the call from a restricted number: A police officer told her Acker had died by suicide.\n\nThe next few days were a blur for Wild, one of just a few lawmakers who have lost their spouses or partners while serving in Congress. She thought it didn\u2019t make sense: While Acker had struggled with depression, he seemed fine when Wild spoke to him Friday night.\n\nThe two had made a grocery list for their barbecue and discussed an episode of \u201cAlpha House,\u201d an old comedy show about three congressmen who were roommates. At 5:30 that morning, before he took his life, Acker texted Wild telling her how much he loved her.\n\n\u201cI was just walking kind of around in a state of shock,\u201d Wild said in an interview. \u201cDisbelief \u2014 you just go through disbelief. . . . I don't feel like I've really dealt with this.\u201d\n\nWild arrived in Washington last fall advocating for labor issues and health care for her pro-union constituency, after flipping a GOP-held, blue-collar district and quickly developing a reputation as an upbeat workhorse. Now, due to a cruel twist of fate, Wild is adding one more policy item to her portfolio: suicide prevention and mental health.\n\nThe 62-year-old former lawyer, who has kept a relatively low profile in the House, will step cautiously into the spotlight this September, which is suicide prevention month. Turning her grief into a purpose, she\u2019s crafting mental health legislation and organizing events to spread awareness and help people in crisis.\n\n\u201cWe still have such a stigma in this society, not only about suicide . . . but also about mental health care,\u201d Wild said. \u201cI felt like if I use my public platform to talk about it, and also if I sort of took what I'm going to call the risk of talking about something so personal . . . it would make others feel like it was more accepted to talk about it and to acknowledge, whether it's them or their family member.\u201d\n\nAt first, Wild didn\u2019t speak publicly about what happened, considering it personal. But a month after the tragedy, when Wild opened up during a late-night speech on the House floor about how Acker had died, the video went viral and prompted an outpouring of people thanking her for sharing her story. Wild realized that thousands were quietly struggling, spurring her to act.\n\nOne man from Iowa, who was contemplating suicide, called Wild to tell her that he saw her speech on Twitter and had changed his mind. \u201cI realized I can\u2019t do it to my wife,\u201d he told her. A prominent leader in her community reached out to share his own closely kept story about his mom\u2019s suicide. And a former NFL player who almost took his life connected with her office to team up on awareness events.\n\n\u201c[My wife] stopped me in my tracks and said, \u2018Hon, you\u2019ve got to see this,\u2019\u201d said Fred Stokes, an ex-Los Angeles Rams and Washington Redskins player who caught Wild\u2019s speech on TV. \u201cI just connected . . . I just saw myself being that guy that had been that close. That could have been me. My wife could have been somewhere . . . sharing about me.\u201d\n\n[REDSKINS SIGN RAMS\u2019 STOKES]\n\nWild\u2019s experience also offers a glimpse into an unofficial support system created by House women. She said her work \u2014 and her colleagues \u2014 helped carry her through the difficult times. Fellow freshmen stepped up to help Wild with events. Reps. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.) and Jackie Speier (D-Calif.), who lost husbands while serving in office, lent a shoulder for her to cry on.\n\nWild met Acker in law school, where he graduated at the top of their class then joined a Wall Street firm. They reconnected in 2002 and had been together since then, with Acker keeping partial residences in New York and Pennsylvania.\n\nAcker\u2019s struggle with depression started a few years later after a surgery unexpectedly induced chronic pain. While secure financially and surrounded by loving family, some things that were once enjoyable in his life, like running five miles a day, were no longer possible, taking a toll on him.\n\n\n\nRep.

Susan Wild)\n\nWild\u2019s political career, however, brought him great joy. A politico who volunteered on the Obama campaign, Acker was Wild\u2019s top political confidant. He kept her abreast of current events while she was busy on the campaign trail. And after she was elected, he was eager to discuss everything from Nancy Pelosi\u2019s (D-Calif.) bid to reclaim to House speaker\u2019s gavel to headlines being made by her more-famous colleagues, like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).\n\n[This lawmaker says a colleague \u2018mansplained\u2019 gender pay equity law to her on the House floor]\n\nAcker was there when Wild took her oath of office. And at a celebration following the event, he acted as the \u201cmaster of ceremonies\u201d in her new office, she recalled. \u201cIt was kind of like we were doing this together,\u201d Wild said.\n\nWhen Acker started to slide back into depression, Wild didn\u2019t know had bad it had gotten. During rough patches, he\u2019d talk about how he might be better off dead or express concerns of never conquering his demons \u2014 but those moments came and went. The two were also set to embark on a new chapter: Acker would be moving out of his part-time New York residence at the end of May; the couple were looking at houses on Capitol Hill, already discussing furniture.\n\nWhen the news hit, Wild\u2019s colleagues pulled together for her. Rep. Chrissy Houlahan (D-Pa.), another female freshman, subbed in for Wild at a veterans\u2019 event on Memorial Day. Calls and texts also trickled in as word quietly spread. Pelosi and House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) checked on Wild regularly. The Obama family sent flowers.\n\nAnd the mountains of cards Wild has yet to finish reading started piling up. Republicans, including Reps. Van Taylor (Texas), Virginia Foxx (N.C.) and later French Hill (Ark.), reached out. \u201cThey were just amazing; they just enveloped me with warmth and hugs,\u201d Wild said of her colleagues.\n\nWild coped by keeping busy with work. She shocked her staff by insisting she would still attend a town hall scheduled three days after Acker\u2019s death, though the event got canceled due to a tornado warning. And when she returned to Washington a week later, Wild jumped back into her typical schedule, working behind the scenes on labor and trade matters and muscling support for a Social Security amendment that would pass in June.\n\n\u201cI was just putting one foot in front of the other,\u201d Wild said. \u201cThe blessing is, [as a busy lawmaker,] you don't really have time to curl up in a fetal position and, you know, and cry it out and really tend to your grieving process. . . . The curse is the same thing \u2014 maybe there needs to be more of that.\u201d\n\nWhen the one-month anniversary of Acker\u2019s death was approaching, Wild decided she was ready to go public with a floor speech she had prepared for days but held off delivering, afraid she\u2019d break down. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Mich.), a close friend, organized members to stand in the chamber for support.\n\nWild spoke about Acker as well as the 47,000 suicides and 1.4 million suicide attempts in the United States in 2017, the most recent numbers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u201cTo anyone out there who is struggling, I\u2019m urging you to reach out,\u201d Wild said tearfully. \u201cThere are people who love you and who will suffer more than you know if they lose you.\u201d\n\nA sea of arms enveloped Wild in hugs and told her how brave she was when she finished. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel brave,\u201d she said of that moment. \u201cIt just felt like something I needed to do.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in her office in late August, it\u2019s clear the wounds from Acker\u2019s death are still fresh. Wild did not cry and smiled throughout constituent events, but during the interview, she acknowledged a sense of nagging guilt as she wonders if she could have done more to save Acker.\n\n\u201cI like to think I've always been a good listener, particularly to constituents and people who want to share problems with me,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think \u2014 probably because I beat myself up some for feeling like I didn't listen carefully enough to things that he was telling me \u2014 I find myself really trying to hear if there's a hidden message in what something somebody tells me.\u201d\n\nIn the coming weeks and months, Wild envisions legislation making insurance companies cover mental health care the same way they would a physical ailment. She\u2019s already working with Veterans Affairs secretary on veteran suicide prevention. And her office is also planning September events that will address supporting families through crisis \u2014 one will even feature Stokes.\n\n\u201cI'm grateful to have this very challenging, rewarding job. I think that if I had still been practicing law down the street here in Allentown, I think it would have been really, really difficult for me to function,\u201d Wild said. The opportunity to make something of her sorrow has helped, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s therapeutic.\u201d", "description": "The Pennsylvania Democrat, who ran on labor and health care for her pro-union constituency, is making suicide prevention and mental health issues a new priority.", "authors": ["Rachael Bade", "Congressional Reporter", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/UlRZUtfGUfzUvihfNfjEN2tdUUM=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JFNGF5WPK4I6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
