She claimed she feared for her life and even asked the public not to believe police accounts that she had committed suicide should she be found dead.\n\nThe performance led to an outpouring of public support and W140 million worth of donations to hire bodyguards to protect her (US$1=W1,181). Police also spent nearly W10 million to protect her at a safe house.\n\nBut soon Yoon found herself subject to a lawsuit on charges of defamation and fraud by a writer who had helped Yoon to publish a book about Jang's suicide and others who had been helping her.\n\nShe promptly fled to Canada and has not returned since. A police official said, \"We intend to seek the cooperation of Canadian authorities to extradite her to Seoul.\" But she reportedly told to police that she is unable to come to Korea immediately citing health problems.\n\n", "description": "Police Seek Starlet's Extradition Over Jang Ja-yeon's Suicide", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/18/2019101801481_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
