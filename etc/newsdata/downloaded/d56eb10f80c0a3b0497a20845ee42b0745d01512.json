(Photo: Getty)\n\nAn Amazon Prime advert has been banned for misleading consumers with options designed to get them to join the subscription.\n\nThe ad on Amazon.co.uk, which is seen during the checkout process, stated: \u2018We\u2019re giving you a 30-day free trial of Amazon Prime! Starting with this order.\u2019\n\nUnderneath, a gold box with the text Order Now With Prime was contained within a larger grey box that read Continue with Free One-Day Delivery. Pay later,\u2019 while another option written separately to the left and in fainter blue writing allowed customers to \u2018Continue and don\u2019t gain Amazon Prime benefits\u2019.\n\nSmall print at the bottom of the page stated: \u2018By signing up you acknowledge that you have read and agree to the Amazon Prime Terms and Conditions and authorise us to charge your credit card after your 30-day free trial.\u2019\n\nSeven people complained that the presentation of the options was unclear and misleading.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmazon said its primary objective was to make sure that consumers who joined Prime did so intentionally.\n\nThe site provided data that it believed proved that consumers were clear that they could continue with their order without signing up for Prime, while also showing that consumers expressly intended to sign up and had not been misled.\n\nUpholding the complaints, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said the option to continue without signing up for the trial was small and placed in a position which could easily be missed by consumers, faint in colour and significantly less prominent.\n\nPrime subscribers get free delivery and other perks (Image: Getty)\n\nThe ASA said: \u2018We considered that the average consumer was likely to view the text within the grey and gold boxes as the only two options available, with the \u2018option\u2019 in the grey box allowing them to continue without signing up to Prime, when that was not the case.\u2019\n\nIt added: \u2018The information provided by Amazon did not demonstrate that the average consumer was not likely to be misled by the presentation of the options.\n\n\u2018Because we considered that the average consumer was likely to view the text within the grey and gold boxes as the only two options available, with the \u2018option\u2019 in the grey box allowing them to continue without signing up to Prime, when that was not the case, we concluded that the presentation of the options was likely to mislead.\u2019\n\nAn Amazon spokesman said: \u2018The evidence from millions of transactions demonstrates that customers have had positive experiences.\n\n\u2018The ASA has instead based its ruling on a handful of complaints and a subjective opinion of the page. We will continue our discussions with the ASA.\u2019", "description": "Advertising Standards Authority slaps down the online retail giant over campaign to make people sign up to its paid subscription service.", "authors": ["Jasper Hamill"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_92279501_1572427701.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
