Usually, this means pairing a photo of a disapproving Prince George with a screenshot of an article about the royals.\n\nJanetti's George has been known to get angry if others are stealing his limelight, and often makes mean-spirited comments about his family members. But after last week, when a video of Meghan Markle appearing to hold back tears went viral, Janetti's trying to avoid criticizing the Duchess.\n\nInstead, he recently posted a photo of George and Meghan together, under which he wrote, \"This is our Uber. I'm taking us on a spa day.\" (Swipe through the below post to see it.)\n\nThe royal meme-maker explained his change of tune to People. \"The way I see it, in my world, she is family, they are family, and George rallies around family,\" he said. \"Now he sees that people and the press have piled on her, he doesn\u2019t like it, and he\u2019s rallying around the family. As of now, Meghan\u2014he wants to take her under his wing. Now we\u2019re seeing George might secretly like her. You know, he does not like to kick somebody when they\u2019re down.\"\n\nHe added, \"it gives him an opportunity play the hero, in George\u2019s eyes. So he\u2019s still getting all the attention, the way he would see it.\"\n\nJanetti, who has written for TV shows like Will & Grace and Family Guy, said his recent post showed George's character development. \"It\u2019s like a story turn, if you think of it as a long-running series,\" he said. \"Stories can take turns. The turn, right now, is that he wants to be her champion. It\u2019s not fun to pile on. George can afford to be generous, and where that goes, we will see.\"\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "\"It\u2019s not fun to pile on.\"", "authors": ["Chloe Foussianes"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/__vOsLd2Ts4d_wcX7ZVfRg--~B/aD01MDA7dz0xMDAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/town_country_721/405c1691c901ed209c9893e419e53553", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
