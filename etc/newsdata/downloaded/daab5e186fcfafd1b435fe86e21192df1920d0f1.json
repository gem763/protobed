By contrast, a quantum computer uses qubits, which can be 1 and 0 at the same time, at least until they are measured,\u201d writes our reporter Dennis Overbye.\n\nImpact: Both China and the U.S. have made quantum computing a national priority, in part because it has the potential to make crucial encryption schemes obsolete.\n\nE.U. looks set to extend Brexit to Jan. 31\n\nEuropean leaders, increasingly exhausted by the Brexit process, were confronted with the task of deciding on a third extension.\n\nThey were expected to settle on Jan. 31, the date set in British legislation that was passed recently. The bloc could announce its decision by the end of the week. As with previous extensions, this would likely be a \u201cflextension,\u201d meaning Britain could potentially depart sooner.\n\nThere was growing concern that even a three-month delay may not be enough to iron out problems.\n\nContext: Despite the E.U.\u2019s mounting frustration with the divorce negotiations, officials wanted to leave no opportunities for Prime Minister Boris Johnson to blame Brussels for the holdup.", "description": "Google's quantum achievement.", "authors": ["Alisha Haridasani Gupta"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/23/briefing/24Briefing-asia-slide-4GS8-copy/24Briefing-asia-slide-4GS8-copy-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
