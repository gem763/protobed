I don't have that as a goal. But we never know, football goes very fast.\n\n\"What makes me happy is to see the quality of Brazilian football. You see Jorge Jesus with Flamengo, and the great players like Felipe, Rafinha, Gerson, Gagibol, who's back shining as he always shone at first at Santos.\n\n\"So without a doubt, I'm happy for our football. I am glad about the ever-growing quality. I'm sincere to say that today I don't have this idea. I have a two-year contract with Arsenal. I have ambitions and goals here with Arsenal, so I came here. But we never know in the future.\"\n\nLuiz has played in all but one of Arsenal's opening nine Premier League games, scoring one goal, which proved to be the winner in the 1-0 win over Bournemouth .\n\n(Image: Arsenal FC via Getty Images)\n\nHe will be hoping he can help turn things around after the Gunners' disappointing 1-0 loss to Sheffield United on Monday left some questioning how long manager Unai Emery should be given to improve results at the club.\n\nArsenal take on Vitoria SC in the Europa League on Thursday before hosting Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Sunday.", "description": "The centre-back only joined the Gunners in August but is already being linked with a move away from the club", "authors": ["Alex Milne", "Image", "Empics Sport", "Arsenal Fc Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20524434.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Arsenal-London-vs-AFC-Bournemouth-United-Kindgom-06-Oct-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
