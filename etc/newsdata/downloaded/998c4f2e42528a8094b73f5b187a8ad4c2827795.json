The decision follows a summer in which Britain and France moved forward with plans to impose taxes on U.S. tech companies.\n\nFacebook alone has 2.4 billion monthly active users worldwide.\n\n\u201cWe have to be mindful, both as policymakers and as corporate leaders, that it's very difficult to disentangle the perception of our biggest economic players that impact the lives of people around the world and our country itself,\u201d Rice says.\n\nRice served as the National Security Advisor under president Barack Obama for three and a half years, giving intelligence briefings to the president each morning; and before that, she spent Obama\u2019s first term as the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. Earlier in her career, Rice served as U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs in Bill Clinton\u2019s administration, and spent several years as a fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n\nShe currently sits on the boards of Netflix and the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.\n\nShe made the comments during a conversation that aired in an episode of Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cInfluencers with Andy Serwer,\u201d a weekly interview series with leaders in business, politics, and entertainment.\n\nFormer National Security Advisor Susan Rice appears on Influencers with Andy Serwer. More\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s justified\u2019\n\nRice pointed to Myanmar, where intensifying ethnic violence over the past decade has in part been attributed to the spread of misinformation on Facebook.\n\n\u201cIf Facebook, for example, is blamed in Myanmar for allowing anti-Rohingya propaganda that incites violence or genocide, that could redound to the detriment of the United States and how we're perceived internationally, because Facebook is such a major player,\u201d she says.\n\nLast year, U.N. Human Rights experts examining violence perpetrated against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar said that social media played a \u201cdetermining role\u201d in the conflict. Marzuki Darusman, chairman of the U.N. Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar, specified: \u201cAs far as the Myanmar situation is concerned, social media is Facebook, and Facebook is social media.\u201d\n\nA Facebook-commissioned report, released last November, acknowledged that the company had failed to prevent the platform from \u201cbeing used to foment division and incite offline violence\u201d in Myanmar.\n\nSpillover criticism from the companies onto the U.S. can have a negative impact even though it may not be warranted, Rice said.\n\n\u201cI'm not saying it's justified,\u201d she says. \u201cI'm not saying it's fair.\u201d\n\nMax Zahn is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.
