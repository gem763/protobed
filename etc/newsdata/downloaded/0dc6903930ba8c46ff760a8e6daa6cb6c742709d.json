It\u2019s discussed in every company analysis and every Finance 101 class. It\u2019s available for everyone to see for every publicly traded company.\n\nAnd yet, investors look right past it, especially in early stage companies and industries when the stocks and numbers tend to be more volatile.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThis not-so-secret, secret ingredient is sales. Or revenue, as it\u2019s called on the balance sheet.\n\nThe more a company brings in, the more upside potential for a stock.\n\nHere\u2019s the deal: Marijuana companies are right now hitting the investing sweet spot where they are starting to generate significant revenue \u2014 yet stock prices are still down.\n\nThat makes NOW the time to buy.\n\nA Proven Path to Big Profits\n\nWhen we look back on 2019, I think we\u2019ll clearly see it was one of the best buying opportunities ever in marijuana stocks. Prices are down even as legalization spreads and sales jump. Eye-popping long-term growth is in the cards, but investors aren\u2019t focused there yet.\n\nHistory shows the massive profits you can earn. Take a look at both Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and some of the mouth-watering opportunities along their growth paths.This is the chance to buy big growth at low prices.\n\nNetflix & Amazon Chart More\n\nNow let\u2019s look at a few marijuana stocks so you can see how they are in that same early stage sweet spot.\n\nAcreage Holdings (OTCMKTS:ACRGF) is a big name in the cannabis industry. Its board includes three of the most connected people on the planet: former U.S. Speaker of the House John Boehner, former Massachusetts Governor and current U.S. presidential candidate William Weld, and former Prime Minister of Canada Brian Mulroney. The company is also central to perhaps the blockbuster marijuana story of the year (so far). Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC), the biggest cannabis company on the planet, agreed to buy Acreage for $3.4 billion when marijuana becomes legal in the U.S. It was practically a flashing neon sign that U.S. legalization is coming sooner than most expect.\n\nStill, the stock has been cut in half this year despite expectations for revenue to soar more than 3,800%, from $21.1 million in 2018 to $838 million by the end of 2021.\n\nAcreage Holdings Chart More\n\nStory continues", "description": "Call it the secret ingredient that compels a stock to move higher.
