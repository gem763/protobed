Critics of the president expressed surprise the White House did not employ a top-level messaging \u201cwar room\u201d to fight back against the charges against the president and failed to deploy a round of surrogates to defend the president on cable news and on the Sunday shows.\n\nBut by the end of the week, it was clear the team leading the fight to defend the president was his re-election campaign, taking cues from Trump\u2019s own combative messaging on Twitter and in person.\n\n\u201cThe campaign gets bigger and stronger, and so does the President,\u201d a campaign spokesperson told Breitbart News. \u201cEvery time Democrats and the media go into a feeding frenzy, the President\u2019s re-election machine kicks into high gear.\u201d\n\nFor years, the campaign invested heavily in campaign infrastructure, building up a team housed in an office building in Rosslyn, Virginia, but last week, they were able to surprise the establishment with a fundraising surge to demonstrate support for Trump.\n\nTrump\u2019s reelection campaign and the Republican National Committee raised $15 million dollars in the 72 hours since Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the impeachment inquiry \u2014 the same amount that former Vice President Joe Biden raised in the entire third quarter.\n\n\u201cKeep it up, Nancy. You\u2019re helping us #KeepAmericaGreat,\u201d Deputy Communications Director Erin Perrine wrote on Twitter.\n\nIn the first 48 hours after @SpeakerPelosi announced her impeachment witch hunt, she helped @realDonaldTrump by firing up our supporters \u2013>\n\n\u2705 $8.5 million to the campaign\n\n\u2705 All small $$$ donors\n\n\u2705 50,000 NEW donors Keep it up, Nancy. You're helping us #KeepAmericaGreat \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 pic.twitter.com/5Ss2Onzw95 \u2014 Erin Perrine (@ErinMPerrine) September 30, 2019\n\nThe campaign immediately invested the money to defend the president, launching an $8.5 million ad campaign with multiple new ads targeting former Vice President Joe Biden, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and their allies in the establishment media in the early campaign states.\n\nBy the following Monday, the campaign trumpeted that their supporters were energized like never before as a result of Pelosi\u2019s impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cThis has the president\u2019s supporters and also independents engaged and in the campaign and supporting President Trump in ways that they were not doing before to this level of intensity, and we have Nancy Pelosi and the impeachment inquiry to thank for that,\u201d Trump\u2019s campaign communications director, Tim Murtaugh, said during a call with reporters on Monday afternoon.\n\nThe contrast between Trump\u2019s reelection campaign and former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign was stark.\n\nTeam Biden responded to the news with carefully constructed tweets, sent their candidate out with prepared remarks (leaked to the press early) and submitted a Washington Post op-ed to combat Trump\u2019s accusation that Biden and his son Hunter Biden were corrupt. Biden and his campaign also inexplicably kept repeating they planned to \u201cbeat Trump like a drum.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign messaging imitated the president \u2014 nimble, red hot, and fighting mad.\n\nThe Trump social media war room spent the week engaging supporters on Twitter and Facebook, with a steady stream of content for Trump supporters to share, including a video of a \u201cBullSchiff-o-meter\u201d mocking \u201cpencil neck\u201d Adam Schiff, and targeted Pelosi, and Biden.\n\n\u201cDemocrats know impeachment hurts the country\u2026\u201d the campaign wrote. \u201cThey just don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nDemocrats know @realDonaldTrump did NOTHING wrong\u2026 Democrats know impeachment hurts the country\u2026 They just don't care. pic.twitter.com/b6psIRsJSv \u2014 Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom) October 4, 2019\n\n\u201cSince the day Donald Trump was elected, Democrats wanted to impeach him,\u201d another video read. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s only crime was beating Hillary Clinton in 2016!\u201d\n\nDemocrats know @realDonaldTrump did NOTHING wrong\u2026 Democrats know impeachment hurts the country\u2026 They just don't care. pic.twitter.com/b6psIRsJSv \u2014 Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom) October 4, 2019\n\nAnother video mocked Pelosi stumbling over her words during a press conference where it was obvious that she was not pleased with how the impeachment inquiry was dominating the headlines.\n\nThe campaign also ramped up spending on digital ads \u2014 $2.1 million on Facebook and $500,000 on Google and YouTube last week, according to ACRONYM, a leftist nonprofit.\n\nThe campaign finished the week with positive messaging, touting the record low unemployment numbers released on Friday, pointing to the president\u2019s success despite unprecedented opposition from Democrats.\n\nVeterans of the 2016 campaign marveled at the well-funded, nimble operation that had been created for the president\u2019s defense.\n\nA former 2016 campaign aid told Breitbart News that the unique blend of the president\u2019s messaging, Democrat attacks, and media criticism sparked moments where the campaign lit up on social media and fundraising. The impeachment efforts by Democrats, he said, was like rocket fuel for the president\u2019s re-election campaign.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anything that the left did in 2016 has infuriated his supporters as much as this impeachment process has infuriated them,\u201d he said.\n\nPast moments energizing Trump supporters included the president\u2019s campaign speech on immigration in Arizona and when he was criticized for saying that Obama had created ISIS, the former campaign staffer recalled.\n\nBack then, Trump went to war on the campaign trail and on Twitter and the campaign did their best to amplify his message.\n\n\u201cPeople forget we were underfunded and understaffed in 2016,\u201d he said. \u201cNow they have a record amount of funding.\u201d", "description": "As impeachment fever swept over Washington last week, President Donald Trump's presidential campaign shifted into battle mode,", "authors": ["Charlie Spiering"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/in-Washington-DC-donald-trump-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
