It's imperative that you ensure the check-out form accurately represents the condition of the car before you take it away\n\nIf you collect a vehicle in the early hours or at night and the sun isn't up, ask the staff member at the desk to move the car under a street light so you can observe it fully before putting pen to paper to verify any blemishes already on the motor.\n\nIf you take pictures with a smartphone, it also records the date and the time the photos were taken \u2013 more evidence that could prove useful later.\n\nAt the end of your rental, check the condition of the car thoroughly with the agent again and take more pictures before handing over the keys.\n\nThey should then hand you the check-in form, which shows the state of the car when you returned it.\n\nThis is where you and they agree that the form is an accurate record of the car's condition.\n\nYou now have two documents that can help you dispute an unfair charge for damage, so keep them safe.\n\nCustomers are recommended to take photos of any damage. Documenting existing scratches or dents is necessary in case the rental firm claims it has got worse during your rental period\n\nYou've had funds taken from your account. Your first move is...\n\nIf you do get billed for damage that you're convinced didn't happen during your rental, gather your photos and paperwork and open a claim online or over the phone with the rental company you used.\n\nIf the damage you're disputing isn't marked on the check-in form \u2013 which both you and the rental company agreed on when you gave the car back \u2013 you've got a good case.\n\nThe rental company's customer service team will take a look and may ask for more details from the local rental agent you dealt with.\n\nIf you booked your car online through a broker or a third party, you can contact their customer service team who will contact the car hire company on your behalf, to put more weight behind your claim.\n\nYou're their customer too, and in it's in their interest to make sure you have a good car rental experience.\n\nMost hire car firms require customers to leave a deposit - usually paid by credit card - to cover the cost for damages. If you do use a credit card, you can dispute a charge via the provider\n\nWhat if the rental company refuses to refund you?\n\nIf, like many of our readers who write in, you don't get anywhere with the rental company, you may still be able to claim the money back if you paid by credit card.\n\nMost rental firms tend to request that any deposit you're forced to make to cover damage costs is done so using a credit card - which should give you some extra powers.\n\nIf this is the case, contact your credit card provider and they should send you a form to fill out.\n\nIf you paid with a debit card, you might be able to claim the money back from your bank under the 'charge back' scheme.\n\nThey will investigate and may refund the rental company's charge if there is doubt about your liability.\n\nIf you're still out of pocket, you can escalate your claim to a consumer rights organisation.\n\nWhich consumer rights group do I need to speak to?\n\nIf you rented within the UK, get in touch with either:\n\n\u2022 BVRLA Conciliation Service (under the Alternative Dispute Resolution for consumer disputes)\n\n\u2022 Citizens Advice Consumer Service \u2013 from there, you should be able to get advice from the consumer helpline, complain to an Ombudsman or report a claim to Trading Standards\n\nIf you rented in the EU or if you live in an EU country, contact:\n\n\u2022 European Car Rental Conciliation Service (ECRCS)\n\n\u2022 European Consumer Centre (from your country)\n\nYou may decide to escalate the case to court and choose to contact a lawyer to represent you.\n\nHowever, fees can be pricey, as will charges if you lose a case and are forced to to cover the legal costs of the opposing party if you end up on the losing side.", "description": "Embarking on the return trip is the low point of all holidays, but some receive a double blow when they're billed for damage to a hire car - especially if they didn't cause it.
