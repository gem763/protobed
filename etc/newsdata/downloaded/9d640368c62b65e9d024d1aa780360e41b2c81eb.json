Thankfully we are fans of easy drinking numbers, and the average across our entire menu is less than 10% ABV per drink.\u201d\n\nAnd what are people looking for in a low proof drink now? \u201cFlavour is key. Instead of fruity, simple alternatives, people are looking for flavour\u2026 they expect something balanced and interesting. Also, appearance is important; they don't want to be singled out so non-alcoholic cocktails need to be indistinguishable from their alcoholic siblings. Sugar carries flavour in cocktails the same way as alcohol in beer, so with non-alcoholic beers having neither it\u2019s hard to give the same profile, though Lucky Saint have managed it.\"\n\nIndeed, we are quite overwhelmed with soft serves: in testing we encountered zero proof spirits that look, smell and taste the part, to refreshing craft ciders and all sorts of botanical wonderment \u2013 that\u2019s not to mention the extremely impressive mixers, spritzers and kombuchas we had no space for in this piece.\n\nIt\u2019s just the alcohol-free wines that seem to be lagging; the really low or no stuff tastes of grape juice in our experience \u2013 you have to go up to the 5.5-7.5% zone to really find something enjoyable (check out thefizzcompany.com for some great examples) so do let us know if you find something lower that\u2019s good. In the meantime, we\u2019ll cheers to these\u2026\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

It\u2019s a very good light, easy drinking lager from a 400 year old brewing background that manages to retain all the characteristics of a boozy craft beer so there\u2019s no FOMO for going dry. An unfiltered blend pilsner malt and light, bright hops all rounded off with a super-smooth \u2013 almost too smooth \u2013 brioche-like citrus note, this goes down a treat any night of the week.\n\nBuy now\n\nStryyk Not Gin: \u00a316, Ocado\n\nThere have been a lot of alcohol-free gin contenders coming on the market and we\u2019re not sold on all of them; there tends to be a cloying sweetness and not enough of that signature \u201cburn\u201d you crave from a real gin. However, this new Not Gin is sugar free and the herby, botanical flavours of coriander, sage, basil and that classic juniper come through in bounds making it a good pretender to a London Dry Gin. It\u2019s zero proof but we thought it was quite convincing as a gin; and certainly more so than other more expensive alcohol free gins we\u2019ve tried. PS. we used a higher spirit to tonic ratio than we\u2019d usually pour and it hit the spot.\n\nBuy now\n\nScavi & Ray alcohol free sparkling wine: \u00a38.99, Dry Drinker\n\nAs we mentioned, alcohol-free wine is a tough gig but this is one of the best examples we\u2019ve found that doesn\u2019t taste solely of grape juice, so it\u2019s extra impressive that it is 0%. It\u2019s almost a convincing prosecco alternative and is just missing that definitive yeasty note that comes with proper fizz, but we\u2019d drink this \u2013 and enjoy it \u2013 if we were abstaining from the real stuff. Overall, a straightforward sparkling non-wine that tastes pleasantly lemony, apple-y and is reminiscent of a basic prosecco: will do the job for a celebration.\n\nBuy now\n\nDrynks Smashed Citrus beer: \u00a31.70, Wise Bartender\n\nThis zippy, zesty alcohol-less lager is pale gold with a nicely balanced blend of hops, malt, lemons and lime on the palate. We don\u2019t think you\u2019d immediately notice the lack of ABV, and that probably comes down to the fact that Drynks uses a cool vacuum distillation process in the making of all its Smashed range, which gently infuses the alcohol out of beer and cider so they taste the same as the alcoholic equivalents. Apparently it\u2019s the most expensive and time-intensive way of doing things, but it tastes like it\u2019s worth it. Smashed Citrus is its brand spanking new one \u2013 and our favourite of the bunch \u2013 but you can also try Smashed Cider (not boozy enough for us), Smashed Hops and Smashed Berry.\n\nBuy now\n\nCeltic Soul spirit: \u00a325, Sainsbury\u2019s\n\nDark spirits are having their turn for an alcohol-free makeover now and this latest one is a pretty impressive attempt. It smells fabulous: smokey, peaty and downright whisky-like (though they don\u2019t bill it as any one spirit in particular). The taste doesn\u2019t quite deliver the fiery burn you\u2019ve come to expect from the whisky aroma \u2013 instead think vanilla, spices and a subtle woodiness \u2013 but it makes a great alternative to booze when mixed with ginger ale and garnished with a twist of your chosen citrus. It\u2019s completely alcohol free too.\n\nBuy now\n\nLowlander yuzu and grapefruit beer: \u00a32.60, 31 Dover\n\nIf you\u2019re after something a bit different to your usual beer, take a look at Lowlander and its interesting flavour profiles. We are very into the elegantly spiced yuzu and grapefruit number, which is zesty, fun and complex enough that you don\u2019t miss the alcohol at all. We weren\u2019t so taken by the ginger and kaffir lime variety which we felt went too far with the aromats, but other testers were; suck it and see. Or try the 0% WIT for a good example of one with decent body.\n\nBuy now\n\nSassy Le Vertaux poire cider: \u00a33.40, Master of Malt\n\nIf you\u2019ve tried alcohol free cider before and quickly thought better of it after the first disappointing waft of Apple Tango, then same. But this is a different beast entirely and one we\u2019ll be ordering up for barbecues, picnics and all the other day drinking occasions where you\u2019d like to maintain your sensibilities but usually fail to. It\u2019s a higher volume than most of the low and no beers and ciders we\u2019re looking at, at 2.5% but wow it is brilliant. A Normandy concoction of pears balanced with the perfect level of acidity and just a touch of sweetness, this is masterful stuff. We\u2019re told that the Normans have it for breakfast and we\u2019re not surprised.\n\nBuy now\n\nNine Elms No. 18: \u00a319.95, Master of Malt\n\nFor something completely different, take a punt on Nine Elms No. 18. It\u2019s hard to categorise \u2013it\u2019s not a wine dupe, even though it looks the part \u2013 and is an infusion of 20 botanicals and four berries designed to be drunk with food (they suggest rich, savoury dishes). The experts agree, as you\u2019ll now find Nine Elms No 18 on the menu at The Clove Club and The Standard hotel. We found it to be an unusual one; there\u2019s the full body you\u2019d find in a wine, and lots of the complexity too, but there\u2019s also the bitterness of some aperitifs. Importantly it\u2019s not sugary sweet or anything like a juice \u2013 thankfully, considering the steep price. Try it as a straight pour with dinner, or mixed in cocktails.\n\nBuy now\n\nHolly Golightly cider: \u00a31.99, Zeroholic\n\nIn a world where most soft ciders taste of fizzy apple juice, this is another good example of a grown-up-tasting beverage that has the bitterness you\u2019d associate with a standard cider. There are plenty of apples in this Audrey-inspired one, obviously, but also a pleasant tartness, persistent bubbles and a welcome feeling that you are having a \"proper drink\" despite being less than half a percent.\n\nBuy now\n\nBrutal Brewing A Ship Full of IPA: \u00a310.90 for six 330ml, Dry Drinker\n\nA good, solid, tangy IPA here that would have you inspecting the bottle for its alcoholic volume: somehow it\u2019s 0%. Again, there\u2019s that cool vacuum distillation involved which means this amber coloured liquid tastes remarkably like a standard alcoholic IPA. Lots of malt, loads of hops, a touch of sweetness and a refreshing finish makes this a reliable choice for anyone hankering after a beer without a sore head.\n\nBuy now\n\nHayman\u2019s small gin: \u00a325, Waitrose\n\nBear with us for this one. It\u2019s real gin and it has a stonking 43% ABV, but Hayman\u2019s has done something clever here by dialling up the distinctive botanical characteristics of this English gin to the extent that just a 5ml thimbleful (thimble provided) of gin mixed with a good tonic will provide the full G&T experience with just 0.2 units of alcohol and 15 calories a pop. And it really does. Of course, this won\u2019t be for everyone as the gin is gin, but an 80 per cent reduction in alcoholic volume is not to be sniffed at and would be ideal for weeknights or when you need to stay sharp.\n\nBuy now\n\nThree Spirit: \u00a324.95, The Whisky Exchange\n\nAnother hard-to-categorise one here with Three Spirit, which is again made from a blend of botanicals but this time without the berries of Nine Elms\u2019. Instead, there\u2019s a prominent savoury note and an expressed bitterness making it a brilliant aperitif. With ingredients like lion\u2019s mane mushroom, yerba mate, black carrot concentrate and coconut vinegar, this isn\u2019t your run of the mill pre-drink and could prove divisive but we welcome the choice. The brand suggests to try with ginger ale and a slice of orange, but there are also espresso-martini-like serves if you want to get experimental.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Low and zero alcohol free drinks\n\nNon-drinkers are spoiled these days, we\u2019re happy to report. Just like their alcohol-consuming counterparts, the success of all of these will come down to peoples\u2019 individual tastes and preferences, but out favourite is the Lucky Saint for a great booze-free choice, and we surprised ourselves with how much we enjoyed Lowlanders yuzu and grapefruit with our Friday night curry.\n\nWe also highly recommend the Sassy poire cider if you can permit yourself the 2.5%; it\u2019s the best example of a cider we\u2019ve tried. Gin lovers deprived of their tipple at gin o\u2019clock should enjoy Stryyk\u2019s Not Gin thanks to the heavy juniper and botanical profile and a splash of bitters should help things along too.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
