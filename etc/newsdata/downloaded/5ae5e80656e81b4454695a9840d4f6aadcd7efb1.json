Thank you very much, Shanghai will always be a special place in my heart.\"\n\nZverev, long touted as the best of the new generation of men's tennis stars, was error-prone, but had no complaints.\n\n\"As I said yesterday, you are probably the best player in the world right now,\" the world number six told Medvedev.\n\n\"How you are playing is unbelievable.\"\n\nMedvedev made a fast start, winning his service game and then breaking Zverev's for an early 2-0 lead.\n\nUnder a closed stadium roof because of rain in Shanghai, Zverev was suffocating, down 3-0 after 11 minutes.\n\nBut the German sent down an ace to finally get a foothold in the match and then broke back for 3-2.\n\nThe duo went with serve until Zverev conceded the set with two calamitous double faults on the trot, the last of which he transpired to gift with a horribly mis-hit second serve that drew a few giggles from the crowd.\n\nThe second set began in the same way as the first -- Medvedev breaking Zverev's first service game for a prompt 2-0 lead.\n\nHe then broke once more in the fourth for a dominant victory, and sealed the title with an ace -- and the most subtle of smiles.\n\nThe next generation has stamped its authority on Shanghai with Djokovic and Federer -- beaten by Zverev -- both going out in the quarter-finals.\n\nNadal failed to play because of a wrist injury.", "description": "Daniil Medvedev won his fourth title of a spectacular year with a thumping victory over Alexander Zverev in the Shanghai Masters final.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5532/25212469e0a942b3bbe2b74ed31e1859.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
