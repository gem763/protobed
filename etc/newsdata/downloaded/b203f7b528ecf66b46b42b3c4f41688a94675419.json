Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nOn Sunday, the New York Times updated its story reporting a new assault allegation against Brett Kavanaugh, which had drawn widespread attention, to clarify that the woman at the center of the incident does not recall it.\n\nA newly attached editor\u2019s note at the bottom of the story reads: \u201cAn earlier version of this article, which was adapted from a forthcoming book, did not include one element of the book\u2019s account regarding an assertion by a Yale classmate that friends of Brett Kavanaugh pushed his penis into the hand of a female student at a drunken dorm party. The book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident. That information has been added to the article.\u201d\n\nThat clarification put already substantial right-wing backlash to the story into overdrive, with many conservative defenders of Kavanaugh \u2014 most prominent among them President Trump \u2014 alleging journalistic malpractice or worse.\n\n\u201cThe New York Times walks back report on Kavanaugh assault claim.\u201d @foxandfriends The one who is actually being assaulted is Justice Kavanaugh - Assaulted by lies and Fake News! This is all about the LameStream Media working with their partner, the Dems. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 16, 2019\n\nJust Out: \u201cKavanaugh accuser doesn\u2019t recall incident.\u201d @foxandfriends DO YOU BELIEVE WHAT THESE HORRIBLE PEOPLE WILL DO OR SAY. They are looking to destroy, and influence his opinions - but played the game badly. They should be sued! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 16, 2019\n\nThe story, which is an adaptation from an upcoming book about Kavanaugh and his confirmation to the Supreme Court by Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, disclosed an incident that had not been previously reported from Kavanaugh\u2019s party-heavy days at Yale. It reported that \u201ca classmate, Max Stier, saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student.\u201d The story says that Stier notified the FBI and senators what he\u2019d seen but has not spoken publicly about it. (The Washington Post reported on Monday that Senator Chris Coons wrote to FBI Director Christopher Wray requesting appropriate follow up on Stier\u2019s allegation.) But it did not originally mention that the unnamed woman has no recollection of it.\n\nThe story also includes new details about Deborah Ramirez, who last year alleged that Kavanaugh thrust his penis in her face at a party during their time together at Yale. The Times reports that at least seven people, including Ramirez\u2019s mother, heard about the incident shortly after it occurred, but that the FBI, in its seemingly perfunctory investigation of Kavanaugh\u2019s past conduct just before his confirmation vote, did not talk to any of them. Instead, the agency focused on the allegations brought forward by Christine Blasey Ford, who said that Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed and tried to remove her clothes during a high-school party, but whose claims could not be corroborated.\n\nIn the wake of the new information, several Democratic presidential candidates, including Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, called on Kavanaugh to be impeached.\n\nEven before the correction appeared, the Times had been criticized for its presentation of a major new revelation about Kavanaugh, who was confirmed to the Supreme Court by a 50\u201348 Senate vote last year amid the misconduct accusations. The article containing the new information confusingly appeared as a \u201cnews analysis\u201d in the paper\u2019s Sunday Review section, rather than as a straight news item, and seemed to be framed mostly as a story about Ramirez\u2019s unhappy college experience; the information about the previously unknown accuser appears 11 paragraphs in, and the headline \u2014 \u201cHe Fit in With the Privileged Kids. She Did Not.\u201d \u2014 does not give any hint of the explosive content within. The Times\u2019s \u201cOpinion\u201d section also ran a tone-deaf tweet downplaying the allegations against Kavanaugh, before deleting it in the face of blowback.", "description": "The New York Times updated a story that had drawn widespread attention for reporting a new assault allegation against Brett Kavanaugh, to clarify that the woman at the center of the incident does not recall it.", "authors": ["Benjamin Hart"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/16/16-brett-kavanaugh.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
