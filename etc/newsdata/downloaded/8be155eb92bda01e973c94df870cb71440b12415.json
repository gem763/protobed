The prime minister is already facing a possible indictment over corruption charges, and his failure to lead Israel's right-wing camp to victory could further erode his position.\n\nThe centrist Blue and White is set to take 32 seats, and two left-wing parties are on course to win a total of 11 seats.\n\nWith neither the centrist bloc nor the right-wing alliance garnering a majority of seats, one option is a national unity government, with Blue and White teaming up with Netanyahu's ruling Likud party. The secular nationalist Israel Beiteinu, with nine seats, could also become the kingmaker in the difficult coalition talks ahead.\n\nThe Joint List, an alliance of Arab parties, is set to become the third-largest force in the legislature, with 12 seats. However, no Arab party has ever participated in a ruling coalition in Israel.", "description": "The Israeli leader faces tough coalition talks.", "authors": ["Lili Bayer"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/themes/politico-eu/static/design/core/template/politico-billboard.png", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
