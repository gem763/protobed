The company is also garnering funds from Coinbase Ventures.\n\nOff Chain Labs Looks to Improve Ethereum\n\nMany likely see Coinbase only as a cryptocurrency exchange, but it has grown into so much more. Coinbase Pro, for example, is a platform designed for institutional investors, while Coinbase Ventures looks to invest in new blockchain and digital currency-based startups. While the company isn\u2019t telling us how much it\u2019s putting into Off Chain, it says the funds are designed to boost the company\u2019s growth and intrigue more people into getting involved.\n\nOff Chain Labs recently garnered just shy of $4 million in seed funding last April. It is presently headed by the former White House deputy chief of technology Ed Felten. In an interview, Felten explained:\n\nArbitrum makes Ethereum contracts faster, more scalable and more private. It\u2019s compatible with Ethereum, so it\u2019s easy for developers to adopt. Our main challenges have been in engineering a system that is reliable and secure enough for use and eliminating performance bottlenecks.\n\nThe announcement comes just as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin is claiming that the Ethereum network is no longer scalable. The blockchain has become the most popular for developing new applications and tokens given Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts capabilities. Unfortunately, so many new coins have led the network to become heavily congested, leading to slow transaction times and high gas fees among other problems.\n\nWhile the platform is still leading the way when it comes to decentralized apps, many competing blockchains, such as EOS and TRON are being marketed as potential alternatives to Ethereum and advertising themselves as faster and less impacted. Thus, Ethereum has been on the verge of losing several new developers and projects as of late.\n\nPerhaps Arbitrum can change all this and make Ethereum the leader it was once again. Off Chain Labs says this new platform can easily be integrated into virtually any Ethereum-based application. It can process as many as 500 transactions per second by utilizing either state channels or sidechains with similar technology to Ethereum.\n\nThe platform\u2019s biggest claim to fame is a feature known as the \u201cAny Trust Guarantee,\u201d which states that so long as validators are being used for honest and true purposes, the decentralized apps utilizing them will execute properly.\n\nThis Is Different from Other Platforms\n\nFelten says:\n\nThis contrasts with other systems that try to gain scalability through a majority voting system among validators. In these settings, it becomes a complicated calculation on knowing who to trust.\n\nMore and more companies are looking to implement private blockchains so that they can obtain necessary information confidentially, though the process has been relatively slow given how few companies trust blockchain when compared with traditional software networks.", "description": "Off Chain Labs, a company that focuses on enterprise, is releasing Arbitrum, a platform designed to boost the scalability of Ethereum.", "authors": ["Nick Marinoff"], "top_image": "https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/https://s3.amazonaws.com/lbn-s3/2018/09/shutterstock_1084901087.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
