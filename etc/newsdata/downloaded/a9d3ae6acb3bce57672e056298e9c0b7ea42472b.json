(AP) - Jordan Phillips was the first to admit the Buffalo Bills didn\u2019t resemble one of the NFL\u2019s best defenses through 2\u00bd quarters against the winless Miami Dolphins.\n\nThat changed when the defensive tackle dug in, burst through the Dolphins line and tackled Ryan Fitzpatrick for a 10-yard loss on first-and-goal from the Buffalo 2. One play later, Tre\u2019Davious White made a diving interception at the 2 to spark a second-half comeback in which the Bills rallied from a five-point deficit for a 31-21 win on Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe are the best defense in the league and we didn\u2019t play like it,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cWe decided to come back in the second half and do what we do, and that\u2019s what we did.\u201d\n\nThough it took nearly three quarters, White put an end to any thoughts of the Dolphins pulling off a Fitz-Magical feat in what would have been a monumental upset for the 17-point underdogs.\n\nWhite\u2019s two second-half takeaways, including a forced fumble in which he punched the ball out of rookie receiver Preston Williams\u2019 arms at the Miami 28, led directly to the Bills\u2019 slow-starting offense scoring two touchdowns and improve to 5-1 - their best start in 11 years.\n\nWhite credited Phillips for making the tackle. Not only did it get the crowd going in the midst of a Dolphins\u2019 16-play third quarter-opening drive, it also allowed White to get back on the field in an obvious pass situation.\n\n\u201cI ran rom the sideline and I jumped up with him,\u201d White said. \u201cFor him to make that play and then we come back the next play and get a takeaway, that\u2019s huge.\u201d\n\nAfter settling for field goals on Buffalo\u2019s first three possessions, Josh Allen led a pair of touchdown drives, capped by 20-yard and 3-yard passes to John Brown and Cole Beasley.\n\nAnd it took safety Micah Hyde to seal the win with 1:38 remaining by returning an onside kick 45 yards for a touchdown, one play after Fitzpatrick scored on an 11-yard run.\n\n\u201cIt took a while into the second half for us to make some plays, but fortunately enough we did,\u201d Hyde said. \u201cI\u2019ll take an ugly win over an ugly loss.\u201d\n\nThe Dolphins\u2019 so-called FitzMagic finally ran out in a game the 15-year journeyman put a real scare into one of his seven former teams.\n\nFitzpatrick put the Dolphins ahead 14-9 by leading consecutive 75-yard touchdown drives. Kalen Ballage put Miami up 7-6 by scoring on a 3-yard run, and Fitzpatrick hit DeVante Parker for a 12-yard touchdown catch with 5:51 remaining in the half.\n\nHe didn\u2019t let up in cutting the Bills lead to 24-21 with his touchdown scamper.\n\nBy the time it was over, the 36-year-old oversaw an offense that ended Buffalo\u2019s six-game streak of not giving up more than 17 points. And he finished 23 of 35 for 282 yards to become the first Bills opponent to top 250 yards passing in 14 games.\n\nThough Miami (0-6) is off to its worst start since losing its first seven in 2011, Fitzpatrick\u2019s performance was an indication the Dolphins might not be as bad as they looked in being outscored 180-42 over their first five games.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten significantly better from Day One to now, and we just have to continue in that trend,\u201d Fitzpatrick said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t won a game. Everybody knows that. But at the same time, we\u2019re making strides.\u201d\n\nFitzpatrick reclaimed the starting job from Josh Rosen a week after leading two fourth-quarter touchdowns drives and coming a 2-point conversion short in a 17-16 loss to Washington.\n\nFirst-year Dolphins coach Brian Flores credited Fitzpatrick for playing well, and said he\u2019s earned the opportunity to start next week.\n\nAllen finished 16 of 26 for 202 yards and produced his third fourth-quarter comeback this season, and fifth overall. His touchdown pass to Brown capped a 12-play, 98-yard drive that followed White\u2019s interception.\n\nCoach Sean McDermott credited his players for having mental toughness for pulling out the win.\n\n\u201cYou could see the look in their eyes at halftime that they were disappointed in themselves and what had unfolded,\u201d McDermott said. \u201cAnd they were convinced they had to do something about it.\u201d\n\nEARLY EXIT\n\nDolphins defensive tackle Christian Wilkins was ejected for throwing a punch at Buffalo Bills tackle Cody Ford on the second snap from scrimmage.\n\n\u201cI was just really, extremely selfish,\u201d Wilkins said. \u201cThat\u2019s not something I\u2019m proud of, that\u2019s not something I intended on doing coming into this game. I just really let myself down and the team down more importantly.\u201d\n\nFAKE FIELD GOAL\n\nWhite\u2019s interception came two plays after Miami successfully ran a fake field goal on fourth-and-1 from the Buffalo 4. Holder Matt Haack caught the snap and then scampered for a 2-yard gain.\n\nINJURIES\n\nDolphins: OT J\u2019Marcus Webb sustained a leg injury in the fourth quarter. G Shaq Calhoun left the game with an illness.\n\nBills: WR Duke Williams did not return after hurting his right shoulder. CB Kevin Johnson did not return because of a head injury.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nDolphins: Prime-time game at Pittsburgh Oct. 28.\n\nBills: Host Philadelphia Eagles on Oct. 27.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jordan Phillips was the first to admit the Buffalo Bills didn't resemble one of the NFL's best defenses through 2\u00bd quarters against the winless Miami Dolphins.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Wawrow"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/20/aptopix_dolphins_bills_football_87563_c0-174-3716-2341_s1200x700.jpg?4e3482fc89dfeeb4d612c6be72e01ce543b61783", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
