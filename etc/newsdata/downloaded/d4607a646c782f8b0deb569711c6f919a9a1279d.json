Her last years were marred by long waits for treatments and interventions.\n\n\"Whenever she got care it was given by overstretched and very dedicated people but it always came after painful and debilitating delays\u201d.\n\nMr Corbyn added: \"Why should that happen to Gillian\u2019s mum or anyone else\u2019s mum?\n\n(Image: Sky News)\n\n\"The problem is the shortage of GPs, the shortage of nurses and the excessive waiting time for people with very difficult conditions and deep pain.\n\n\"They should be sympathised with and supported.\"\n\nMr Johnson stuttered as he answered at first: \"I can certainly say that we will deal with his constituent Gillian's concerns.\"\n\nIncredulous Labour MPs shouted: \"Her mother died! Listen!\"\n\nThen he went immediately on the attack - saying: \"There are 17,300 more doctors and over 17,000 more nurses on our wards since 2010.\n\n\"And I think frankly it is time to differentiate between the politics of protest and the politics of leadership.\n\n\"And he should apologise for continually striking attitudes that I do not think are interests of the...

It has grown by 19% since the Conservatives first came into office, and he would ruin this economy and ruin our ability to fund the NHS, and that is the reality.\"\n\nMr Corbyn said: \"We learned this week that Government officials have met US pharmaceutical companies five times as part of the Prime Minister's planned trade detail. The US has called for full market access to our NHS, which would mean prices of some of our most important medicines increasing by up to seven fold.\n\n\"Whilst the Government is having secret meetings with US corporations, it is patients here that continue to suffer.\"\n\nMr Johnson replied: \"Are you seriously suggesting that the NHS should not engage in negotiations to ensure British patients get the drugs they deserve? Are you so phobic of American companies that you will forbid them from having these discussions?\"\n\nMr Corbyn said: \"Of course we need to import medicines from various places. I just want it to be done in an open and transparent way. I don't want secret talks between Government officials on behalf of ministers with big pharma corporations in the USA.\"\n\nMr Corbyn said last year 34,000 cancer patients waited more than two months for treatment.\n\nHe said the longer people wait, the lower the chances of surviving cancer. He called for more resources to cut waiting times.\n\nMr Johnson replied: \"We intend, if we are allowed, if we come back as the next government, we will invest massively in that NHS and take it forward with the funds that we will make available from a strong and growing economy, and the reality is he would wreck that economy.\"", "description": "Furious MPs shouted \"her mother died!\" in the last PMQs before the general election after the Tory claimed he'd \"deal with\" the case - and said Jeremy Corbyn should \"apologise\"", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Image", "Sky News", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Wpa Pool"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20679553.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Boris-Johnson_17726JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
