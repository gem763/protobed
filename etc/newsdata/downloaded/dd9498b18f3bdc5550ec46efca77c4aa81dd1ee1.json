After testing the international waters in Thailand, RuPaul\u2019s empire has now expanded across the pond, to the land of royalty, hot soccer players, and Adele. Yes, it\u2019s the long-awaited first season of RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race U.K., and it\u2019s airing in the U.S. so we masochists can spend another eight weeks on the emotional roller coaster that has become Keeping Up With Drag Race. So hold onto your vodka-sodas and let\u2019s get started!\n\n(A quick programming note: These recaps will post in conjunction with the episodes\u2019 airing on BBC, which will stream simultaneously in the U.S. via WOW Presents Plus. Each episode will then air on Logo the following Friday. So U.S. viewers, if you\u2019re waiting to watch via Logo, consider this your spoiler warning. It\u2019s a recap, henny!)\n\nIt might feel old to us, but Drag Race is new to these queens, and I\u2019m happy for them! After 11 years of watching their American sisters win fame from afar, ten British queens finally get a chance to play, and they\u2019re eager to show they\u2019ve earned it. The producers have taken the intro we know by heart (minus the prize details \u2014 more on that in a sec) and tacked a U.K. onto the title, if you didn\u2019t know by now what you\u2019re watching. And if that didn\u2019t tell you, wait till Baga Chipz walks in and starts her rapid-fire introduction in a thick accent. At this point, about a minute in, I started looking for the closed-caption button, but among the phrases I could discern were: \u201cgin-and-tonic,\u201d \u201ca good ol\u2019 shag,\u201d \u201cbig, massive knockers,\u201d \u201cknickers on show,\u201d \u201ca right trollop,\u201d \u201cme minj,\u201d \u201cgob shite,\u201d \u201cshitting my knickers.\u201d As newly christened Londoner Taylor Swift once said, \u201cGod, I love the English!\u201d\n\nThe rest of the season\u2019s queens follow, including: Blu Hydrangea, who sets the bar low calling herself \u201ca school art project with legs\u201d; Divina de Campo, who laughs after everything she says; Crystal, who is actually from Canada; Sum Ting Wong, a \u201cmonster of new drag\u201d because she loves \u201cmakeup and Ariana Grande\u201d; Cheryl Hole, an Essex girl (and I actually know what that means!); Gothy Kendoll, who is going to have me saying \u201cGothy. Kendoll. Gothy. Kendoll.\u201d to myself for the next week; Vinegar Strokes, who worked with Michelle Visage on the West End musical Everybody\u2019s Talking About Jamie; Scaredy Kat, who is 19 (?), has a girlfriend (??), and has been doing drag for 11 months (???); and the Vivienne, the U.K. ambassador for Drag Race herself. Got all that? You should, because it\u2019s only ten queens, a true relief after the 15 of Drag Race season 11.\n\nRuPaul comes in to introduce a classic Drag Race premiere mini-challenge \u2014 a high-concept \u201cheadless\u201d photoshoot, with the addition of a cheeky catchphrase of the queens\u2019 own devising \u2014 and drops that there\u2019ll be a new prize: Instead of winning \u201ca year\u2019s supply of Anastasia Beverly Hills cosmetics\u201d (or, I don\u2019t know, Burberry Beauty) and \u201ca cash prize of $100,000\u201d (or pounds, I guess), the winning queen will head to Hollywood to star in a series with the team behind American Drag Race (a.k.a. a series on WOW Presents Plus, most likely). They seem happy about it! We also get to meet the Brit Crew, who are as hot as expected in their fancy hats and little else.\n\nThe photoshoot is a blur, but what really stands out is how much fun Ru is having. He\u2019s interacting with the queens again, and it\u2019s enjoyable to watch. Something in that English water! We\u2019re off to a historic start, with Scaredy Kat, who came out acknowledging her bisexuality from the start, winning the first mini-challenge. No, Scaredy is not straight, she\u2019s openly bisexual, a fact that was confusingly muddled during her walk-in, when all the other queens freaked out over her having a girlfriend. Her lack of drag experience is another story, but talking openly about bisexuality and bi erasure is near-uncharted territory for a show that still expects its viewers and competitors to be into boys and only boys. So even if I wasn\u2019t the biggest fan of her photo of her shitting her head out (\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m doing constantly, shitting myself,\u201d she explains, which I totally needed to hear), I\u2019m glad she gets the early momentum.\n\nThe main challenge is also a fairly straightforward Drag Race staple, a runway challenge showing off two looks: one honoring the queens\u2019 hometowns and one honoring an iconic look of Queen Elizabeth II herself. We see little prep (they don\u2019t call it a \u201cwerkroom\u201d for nothing, producers!), but not even half an hour into the first episode, we do get our first emotional moment. The Vivienne is showing off her clip-in veneer teeth covers, and Gothy tells us in a confessional that she\u2019s self-conscious of her teeth. (If you weren\u2019t paying attention for the last 25 minutes, we\u2019re in the U.K.) But boy, Gothy is cute, and has nothing to be ashamed about. She\u2019s Gothy. Kendoll. Gothy. Kendoll. And don\u2019t you forget it!\n\nIn the werkroom the next day, we get a whirlwind of queens talking about being from places I\u2019ve never heard of and what it\u2019s like there and whether there\u2019s a drag scene and what they think about the royals. And we learn that Scaredy has never been to a drag show, gasp! Before we know it, we\u2019re watching a runway \u2014 if we can make it through Michelle Visage\u2019s cringe-y British phrases first. (She, who acted in Everybody\u2019s Talking About Jamie on London\u2019s West End and is currently killing it on Strictly Come Dancing, a.k.a. British Dancing With the Stars, should know better!) Alan Carr, who is either the new Ross Mathews or the new Carson Kressley, is here as well, along with Andrew Garfield, for his \u201cday in gay heaven.\u201d Oh how lucky we are to witness it!\n\n20 looks later, Crystal, Blu, Scaredy, and Divina are safe. And those girls turn some looks I loved: Crystal\u2019s detailed \u201cmilitary dominatrix\u201d Queen, Blu\u2019s high-concept Queen on the two-pound coin, Scaredy\u2019s apt \u201cBaby Queen,\u201d and Divina\u2019s campy Yorkshire getup featuring trumpets on her boobs \u2014 call them honkers. (What does it have to do with Yorkshire? Give me a break, I\u2019m American!)\n\nMost of the judges\u2019 critiques are agreeable. For the bottoms, Crystal\u2019s trashy Essex girl was on point but her queen look was too simple, both Vinegar\u2019s looks weren\u2019t followed through (no special treatment from her buddy Michelle here, as Michelle confirmed earlier), and Gothy doesn\u2019t give enough confidence on the runway. I\u2019m sad for Vinegar, who serves the most personality of any of the queens, which hopefully can translate into a good lip sync. (She does an amazingly off-point Michelle Visage voice, and I just want to see that Snatch Game!) And poor Gothy! As for the tops, the Vivienne absolutely transformed from her punk, plaid Pete Burns to her \u201cHunting Queen\u201d look, to the point where neither Michelle nor I believe that that\u2019s her real nose. She\u2019s clearly won, but Baga is also rightfully in the top for her on-point Amy Winehouse look and pretty \u201970s Queen. So is Sum Ting Wong, whose Queen stamp look is praised as \u201cballsy,\u201d \u201cbig,\u201d and \u201cdrag.\u201d I saw it as a box on her head paired with an afterthought of a dress, and thought Blu followed through on a similar idea much better, but this is why they\u2019re at the judges\u2019 table and I\u2019m in bed with my laptop and a glass of red wine.\n\nNow it\u2019s time for the judges to deliberate \u2014 oh wait, we\u2019re untucking now! Absent a proper \u201cUntucked\u201d side series, it looks like we\u2019ll get to see the queens untuck during the show; I just hope it doesn\u2019t take more time out of the werkroom and gives us actual drama, unlike the tame whining we get here.\n\nTo no one\u2019s surprise at all, the Vivienne has won the main challenge. So much for the Drag Race ambassador title coming from \u201cjust a little competition in a bar\u201d! And she has won \u2026 something called a \u201cRuPeter Badge.\u201d This is another reference I had to look up, but my bigger question here is, is it worth any money? Yes, this is a BBC program(me), and thus subject to more scrutiny around sponsorships and prizes than U.S. Drag Race, but come on, Ru, tip the dolls! Perhaps British people just enjoy competing for competition\u2019s sake? Regardless, I know it\u2019s just the first episode, but given the title she\u2019s come in with, the Vivienne has quickly established herself as a queen to watch. As for the bottoms, Cheryl is safe on the true strength of her Essex girl look, leaving Vinegar and Gothy.\n\nEver since this series was announced, I\u2019ve been wondering if the queens would lip-sync for their lives, given Charlie Hides\u2019s (there\u2019s a name I bet you haven\u2019t heard in a while) abysmal performance in season nine after claiming that British queens don\u2019t lip-sync. But we will get more lip-syncs, Ru assures, after translating the word \u201cshantay\u201d for our queens, who I hope didn\u2019t need that little vocabulary lesson.\n\nGothy Kendoll and Vinegar Strokes could not be more polar-opposite queens to pit against each other in the first lip sync, with Gothy netting critiques for her shyness and Vinegar coming off a high-profile acting gig. We\u2019re treated to a two-minute bloodbath soundtracked by Dua Lipa\u2019s \u201cNew Rules,\u201d in which it seems like Gothy accidentally wandered on stage during the Vinegar Strokes Show. You can see her thinking through every half-hearted hand motion, and it\u2019s painful. Vinegar, meanwhile, is shaking her boobs and treating us to perfectly timed wig reveals, and this is the stuff we pay to see! Unsurprisingly, she\u2019s safe, and Gothy is the first to go. Poor Gothy! It\u2019s good to see her leave in high spirits, with a referential \u201cMs. Kendoll, Ms. Kendoll.\u201d\n\nI still see potential in Vinegar, a boisterous \u201cdragter\u201d who got off on the wrong foot but who I could see winning an acting challenge. We\u2019ll see next week!\n\nAcross the Pond\n\nAs RuPaul himself said during the photoshoot, \u201cIt\u2019s such a rich cultural exchange for me here!\u201d Me too! I\u2019ve only ever spent one week in the U.K., and if you can\u2019t tell by now, I won\u2019t pretend to know anything about it. So, this section is going to be my notes on what I\u2019ve learned about that wonderful island each week, because if any television program should be educational, it\u2019s Drag Race.\n\n\u2022 Baga Chipz informs us she\u2019s a \u201cgob shite,\u201d and later tells Ru that \u201cif ya got a big gob, you\u2019re loud.\u201d But if a gob is a mouth and shite is just shit, then \u2026 well, the slang jury might still be out on this one.\n\n\u2022 When they\u2019re de-dragging, Cheryl and Crystal praise how in the U.K., drag queens don\u2019t need to have brows and can keep their chest hair. If you say so, girls!\n\n\u2022 Alan Carr quickly earns his seat at the judges\u2019 table by sharing a piece of Queen Elizabeth gossip for the ages: \u201cI\u2019ve met the queen a couple of times and she does not crack a smile. Ru, there was this big concert done for the queen outside Buckingham Palace, and halfway through, she put earplugs in.\u201d And that might just ruin any fever dream of a royal guest judge one day!", "description": "Let the rich cultural exchange begin!
