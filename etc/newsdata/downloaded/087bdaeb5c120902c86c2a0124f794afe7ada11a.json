It is a very good way to operate a lot more safely and assess the risk, without losing [people] in the process ... so it's a lot safer for the guys who are deployed on the ground,\" he said.\n\nThe news comes a day after Boeing Australia announced its partnership with the Trusted Autonomous Systems Defence Cooperative Research Centre (DCRC) to develop artificial intelligence (AI) technologies for unmanned systems for military operations.\n\nOne of the first projects between the pair will examine an unmanned system's route planning, location, ability to identify objects, and the platform's subsequent behavioural response.\n\nThe Department of Defence also handed out over AU$15.1 million in total funding to nine organisations as part of its latest round of Defence Innovation Hub contracts.\n\nThe investment was split between two Australian universities and seven Australian businesses.\n\nAmong the funding, AU$1.5 million was awarded to Agent Oriented Software, a Melbourne company, to demonstrate real-time coordination of intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance assets, including unmanned drones and autonomous vehicles; and Sydney company Marathon Targets was awarded AU$1.1 million to develop an autonomous vehicle target to enhance close combat training by replicating realistic actions of adversaries.\n\nRelated coverage", "description": "XTEK will be responsible for providing repairs, maintenance, and support services for the Australian Defence Force's Wasp AE fleet.", "authors": ["Aimee Chanthadavong"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/06/01/ebb95e49-fabd-4006-9187-090ff967a02d/thumbnail/770x578/a123143f86b8578055c344f042b89849/australian-defence-force-drone-uav-uas.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
