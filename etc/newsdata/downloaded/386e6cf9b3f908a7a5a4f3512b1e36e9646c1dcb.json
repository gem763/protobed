Not only is there a sense of security that comes from being able to call a physical space your \u2018own\u2019, there are also financial rewards associated with property ownership. That said, it\u2019s important to be aware of the risks involved in buying a property \u2013 so you can adequately plan ahead for any challenges that might come your way.\n\nHome loan repayment defaults\n\nThe risks of buying a house are largely financial. For one, there\u2019s the risk of not being able to pay off your home loan, either due to bad financial planning, or circumstances beyond your control, such as unemployment, divorce, or the death of a spouse.\n\nDefaulting on your home loan repayments could incur additional fees and expenses \u2013 on top of your existing mortgage amount \u2013 and it could also tarnish your credit record. Worst-case scenario would be having your home repossessed to settle your debt with your financial lender.\n\nWhat you can do: While there\u2019s generally a late payment grace period for defaulters, it\u2019s always best to contact your lender, as soon as you can, to explain the reasons for your non-payment. This indicates a willingness to take financial responsibility, and your lender may be more open to rearranging your repayments while you get your financial ducks back in a row.\n\nAnother wise decision is to take out a Bond Protection Plan, to cover your bond instalments in the event of death, retrenchment or disability.\n\nLimited or no returns on your investment\n\nAnother financial risk you take when buying a house is that your property might actually depreciate in value over time. Most homeowners buy property with the intention of seeing a positive return on investment should they sell \u2013 but this isn\u2019t guaranteed. The type of structure built on the property doesn\u2019t necessarily determine its long term value either; it\u2019s the actual land on which the property is built that increases or decreases in value, depending on its location, supply and demand in the area, and general property market trends.\n\nWhat you can do: Buy property in a location that\u2019s in high demand and looks to stay that way in the future. Properties close to amenities, such as hospitals, schools and main arterial roads, are less likely to decrease in value over time. New property developments can also see good returns over the long term, depending on what other developments are planned for the area.\n\nWater or fire damage woes\n\nThe other financial risks of buying a house include unexpected damage to a property due to fires, floods or other events beyond your control. There\u2019s nothing worse than going away on holiday and coming home to a burst geyser that\u2019s completely flooded your house!\n\nWhat you can do: While all home loan lenders require a Home Owner\u2019s Cover (HOC) policy as part of the home loan agreement, homeowners who\u2019ve paid off their bonds do not always feel they need to have any form of homeowner insurance \u2013 which leaves them at risk. There were many tragic stories of families in the Knysna area who had their homes damaged or destroyed in the fires in June 2017, for example, and lost everything because they didn\u2019t have insurance. So, even if you don\u2019t have a bond and the compulsory insurance cover your bond provider requires, it would be prudent to have some form of insurance to protect your most valuable asset.\n\nContact SA Home Loans with any questions you may have about our Bond Protection or Home Loan products.\n\nSource: SA Home Loans\n\nReturn to homepage.", "description": "", "authors": ["Sa Home Loans"], "top_image": "https://myhome.24.com/The-top-financial-risks-of-buying-a-house-what-you-should-know/assets/5dX49EcIAl/istock-1091920582-2121x1414.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
