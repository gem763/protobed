A young lady of her station would never have worn her hair loose.\u201d\n\nLisa puts a hand to her mouth at the thought.\n\n\u2013 Sfumato \u2013\n\nThe revelation comes through a deep dive into images made possible through ultraviolet and X-ray technology, revealing details of the layers upon layers of transparent glazes that Leonardo applied to the painting, creating the illusion of three-dimensional volume and bringing his subject to life.\n\n\u201cNearly devoid of pigments, the thin layers of oil paint \u2014 sfumato \u2014 create a light haze, making the transitions from dark to light almost imperceptible,\u201d the narrator says. \u201cThe blurred outlines create the illusion of movement in certain areas.\u201d\n\nThe viewer will also be surprised to note that the 24-year-old Lisa was quite svelte for a mother of five, a fact that is no longer apparent in the timeworn, heavily varnished painting, in which she appears somewhat plump \u2014 some have even suggested she was pregnant.\n\nA dreamlike final 360-degree sequence takes the spectator up in a wooden flying machine imagined by Leonardo, soaring over the mountains and valleys of the painting.\n\nThe retrospective commemorating the master painter\u2019s death 500 years ago, titled simply \u201cLeonardo da Vinci\u201d, runs to February 24 in the Louvre\u2019s Hall Napoleon.\n\nA download of an extended version of the virtual reality experience can be purchased through VIVEPORT and other online platforms.", "description": "Paris (AFP) \u2013 The Mona Lisa is conspicuously absent from the Louvre\u2019s retrospective of Leonardo da Vinci, but the world-famous Florentine", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/27/4206c7_mona-lisa-attracts-an-estimated-30-000-people-day-mona-lisa-graces-louvre-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
