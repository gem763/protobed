The first revolves around leaked audio of Mark Zuckerberg speaking privately to employees at recent town hall meetings, where he called Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s plans to break up Facebook an \u201cexistential\u201d threat to the company and one he would fight. The second is a recent announcement by Facebook that it is exempting political figures from its policy forbidding spreading misinformation in advertisements (yes, politicians spreading false claims in their ads is just a part of the political conversation, according to Facebook).\n\nBoth developments have attracted the ire of Warren who, in a series of tweets this week, argued that the public has a right to know how Facebook \u201cintends to use their influence in this election\u201d and implied that Mr. Zuckerberg and Facebook might be intentionally emboldening the Trump campaign by relaxing advertising rules. Fellow Democrats echoed the concerns: Seema Nanda, C.E.O. of the Democratic National Committee, told CNN that the social network\u2019s ad policy \u201cis a serious missed opportunity by Facebook.\u201d At the same time, old fears that the company\u2019s \u201cI Voted\u201d button, which has proved effective at boosting get-out-the-vote efforts, could give an outsize advantage to Mr. Trump are recirculating.\n\nBut Ms. Warren\u2019s concerns miss a key point about the social network\u2019s roles in elections.\n\nYes, Facebook\u2019s willingness to let politicians lie sets a worrying precedent. And yes, lack of oversight into the platform\u2019s decisions opens up a host of plausible election interference conspiracies. But Facebook\u2019s essential threat to democracy isn\u2019t that Mr. Zuckerberg will intervene on behalf of his preferred candidate \u2014 it\u2019s more fundamental than that. Mark Zuckerberg need not intervene, because Facebook, the platform, will do so instinctively. With its algorithmic mandate of engagement over all else, Facebook has redefined what it means to be a good candidate \u2014 and provided a distinct natural advantage to those who distort the truth and seek to divide.\n\nFew politicians have evidenced this phenomenon better than President Trump, the natural Facebook candidate. He\u2019s light on policy but heavy on the sort of sweeping imagery that translates so easily to memes (some of his memes, like \u201cThe Wall,\u201d eventually do become policy). Almost every iteration of his messaging is the type of polarizing content that is candy for Facebook\u2019s algorithms.", "description": "Mark Zuckerberg doesn\u2019t need to tip the scales in 2020.
