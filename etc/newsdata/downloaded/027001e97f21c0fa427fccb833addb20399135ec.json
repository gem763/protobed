So that was my theory,\" Obama told Roberts. \"And then his name was Barack Obama. He was from Hawaii. I thought, \u2018What,\u2019 you know? So I didn't really know what to expect.\"\n\n\u201cAnd then in walks Barack Obama,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd Barack Obama has always walked like Barack Obama. Like, he's got all the time in the world. He had that stride ... I was, like, \u2018Dude, you're cute.\u2019 But in my mind, I was, like -- off limits. Not even not interested. I'm not going to date one of the few black summer associates ... how tacky, you know?\u201d\n\nDespite an immediate attraction, she insisted they should just be friends.\n\n\"Barack had suggested that we date, but I was, like, \u2018No, no, meet my friends. Do this, do that. It wouldn't be right, no,'\" Michelle Obama recalled. \"And he was, like, 'You're crazy. We should date. I like you, you like me.'\"\n\n\"I liked that about him. He was very straightforward. He wasn't playing games,\" she said. \"I say that to the ladies out there. Not a game player. Very clear about what he wanted.\"\n\nMichelle Obama's insistence on just a friendship changed one summer night when Barack kissed her at a Chicago ice cream shop.\n\n\u201cWhen we stopped for ice cream and he got the sense that I was starting to open up,\u201d she said. \u201cHe played it real smooth. He just leaned in for a kiss. And that really was it. You know, from that kiss on\u2026 it was love. And he was my man.\u201d\n\nAnd that love, she said, still exists for them. In her book, she writes about still having \u201clust\u201d for him.\n\n\"It\u2019s there. I don't know what to tell you ... It still is,\" she told Roberts. \"I love my husband a lot.\"\n\nThe former first lady was also purposeful in \"Becoming\" about painting a candid portrait of their marriage, including revealing that at times they sought marriage counseling.\n\n\u201cI know too many young couples who struggle and think that somehow there's something wrong with them,\u201d Michelle Obama told Roberts. \u201cAnd I want them to know that Michelle and Barack Obama, who have a phenomenal marriage and who love each other, we work on our marriage. And we get help with our marriage when we need it.\u201d\n\n\u201cMarriage counseling for us was one of those ways where we learned how to talk out our differences,\u201d she added. \u201cWhat I learned about myself was that my happiness was up to me.\u201d", "description": "The former president and first lady are the parents of two college-aged daughters.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/barack-michelle-obama-gty-jt-191003_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
