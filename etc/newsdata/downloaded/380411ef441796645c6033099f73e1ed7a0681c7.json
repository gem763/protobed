I love the intensity of campaigning. I love aspects of the fight. I don\u2019t know how much I would love aspects of the actual job yet.\u201d\n\nA person close to the younger Mr. Trump said he \u201ccurrently has zero interest in running for office\u201d and that his sole political focus is his father\u2019s campaign next year. Still, the person added that while the younger Mr. Trump does not expect to be a candidate himself, he anticipates being involved in Republican politics \u201cfor many years to come.\u201d\n\nIvanka Trump, the president\u2019s elder daughter, is also seen by West Wing aides and people who have worked with the family as harboring ambitions of her own for elected office. People close to her insist that she has never discussed it, although some of her friends, in private conversations, have been open about the prospect that they see her as a future presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cIf she ever wanted to run for president,\u201d Mr. Trump told The Atlantic in a recent interview, \u201cI think she\u2019d be very, very hard to beat.\u201d\n\nLara Trump, the president\u2019s daughter-in-law, who is actively involved in his re-election campaign, is also mentioned as a possible candidate by some close to the family.\n\nSuch comments make clear that the Trump family hopes to extend its influence into the future. And the remarks touched on two lingering questions about the future of the Trumps: Will any of the president\u2019s children run for office, and will he fade quietly if he loses in 2020, or finishes a second term in 2024?", "description": "The comments by Brad Parscale were scrutinized for clues as to whether Mr. Trump\u2019s children are indeed planning their own political futures.", "authors": ["Maggie Haberman"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/08/us/politics/08dc-dynasty-sub/08dc-dynasty-sub-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
