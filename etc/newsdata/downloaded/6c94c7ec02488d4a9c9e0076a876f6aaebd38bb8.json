McConnell successfully rolled back some of Obama\u2019s regulations at the start of 2017, though Schumer will need at least four GOP defections to chip away at Trump\u2019s regulations, a difficult task.\n\nThe votes will likely be more of a political exercise, putting pressure on vulnerable GOP senators to break from the party line or face Democratic attacks over the next year of campaigning.\n\nEnvironmental advocates and a coalition of states have already begun what\u2019s expected to be a lengthy legal challenge to the Trump administration\u2019s Affordable Clean Energy regulation of power plant emissions, which have been the subject of heated debate in Congress for the better part of the decade.\n\n\u201cThe EPA has abdicated its responsibility in promulgating this deeply flawed rule and the Senate will abdicate its responsibility if it fails to repeal the ACE rule,\u201d said Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.).\n\nBack in 2015, the full Senate passed two resolutions largely along party lines disapproving of the centerpieces of Obama\u2019s climate change agenda. The political calculus may be similar this time around. Moderate Republicans, including Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), broke with their party during the 2015 vote to vote against the resolutions, while coal state Democrats, like Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), backed them.\n\nAaron Lorenzo contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/86/ed/beaa2a854f5fa6f9dcb5bf0c9322/191010-chuck-schumer-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
