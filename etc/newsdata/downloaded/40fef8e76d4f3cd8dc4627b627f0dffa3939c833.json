She visited Johannesburg\u2019s Victoria Yards, a place for artisans and craftspeople to work and share their creations.\n\nMeghan\u2019s first stop was at Sneakers 4 Change, an organization that collects and donates sneakers to those less fortunate. She then headed to Young Bucks, a small business that makes books from recycled materials. During the stop, Meghan commented that she used to teach a bookbinding class, back when she supplemented her acting work by teaching classes such as calligraphy.\n\nNext up, the 38-year-old royal mom visited Tshepo Jeanmaker, which makes custom jeans and was started by a local designer from Soweto. He spoke to Meghan about the growth of his business, which now employs 10 people, and presented her with a tiny pair of overalls for nearly 5-month-old son Archie. He also revealed that Meghan placed an order for a pair of jeans four weeks ago, which she personally picked up!\n\nTshepo shared this info about the logo for his line: \u201cThe crown on my jeans represents the three ladies who raised me. Enjoy wearing this crown.\u201d\n\nView photos The Duke and Duchess of Sussex/Instagram More\n\nView photos Meghan Markle | The Duke and Duchess of Sussex/Instagram More\n\nFinally, the Duchess of Sussex visited a small market exhibiting some of the items you can find at Victoria Yards and listened to a performance by Belita Andre, a spoken word artist.\n\nFor the occasion, Meghan wore an indigo Wilfred dress featuring buttons down the front by Aritiza and red Everlane flats.\n\nView photos Meghan Markle | The Duke and Duchess of Sussex/Instagram More", "description": "Meghan Markle Makes Another Surprise Outing in Africa", "authors": ["Stephanie Petit"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/USI6Bjet4npeykMPj8M8wQ--~B/aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/6e6ab1c959de6bdc667716d79e852452", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
