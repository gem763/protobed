He said I had to tell them someone else had beaten me up.\n\n\"I don't know how I managed to get up from that floor, but I did.\n\n(Image: SWNS.COM)\n\n\"The next thing I knew I was in the back of an ambulance.\n\n\"The police didn't believe what Kelvin was telling them because, I have been told, the house looked like a murder scene, and a blood-splattered hammer was found on the floor.\"\n\nAfter her hospital stay, she was sectioned for two months because her emotional state was so severe and she still suffers with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n\n\"I would wake up screaming,\" said Gemma. \"In fact, I don't think I've had a night that's been nightmare-free since it happened.\"\n\nGemma told how she'd been beaten up three to four times before by Cornwell.\n\nCornwell, who Gemma describes as \"evil\", would await a special occasion, buy her a new dress, tell her to get her hair done and book a restaurant, then hours before they were due to go out, he would flip.\n\nThe first time he did this was on Valentine's Day last year.\n\n(Image: Lancashire Constabulary /SWNS)\n\nAs her birthday was approaching she knew she had to get out \"for the sake of my unborn child\", said Gemma.\n\nGemma told how she moved to Preston, Lancs., from the Manchester area, when she met Cornwell, who was, at first, a real gent.\n\nGemma said: \"The the emotional abuse started. He'd say things like: 'You're ugly', or 'I'm the only one who'll ever love you'.\n\n\"He controlled what I wore, I couldn't wear anything tight or stylish, I had to be covered up. The usual things people do like going to the gym or shopping were big no's.\n\n\"He would turn my friends and family against me - he'd smash my phones up so I couldn't contact people.\n\n\"He would tell me to kill myself, or say that he would. He made me believe I'd get into trouble if I told anyone what was happening, and that it would be easier to kill myself.\"\n\nBut Gemma, who has moved away but will not reveal her whereabouts, feels lucky to have got out alive.\n\nShe said: \"I could have been a statistic, one of those women killed at the hands of their abusive partners.\n\n\"I could have died that day, so I know I am lucky, though I find it hard to carry on, I daren't even go out.\n\n\"As an ex-soldier he always said he had contacts and that he could keep me under surveillance, so I'm still scared.\n\n\"I now have to take each day as it comes and warn others what he's like in the hope that nobody else suffers at his hands, like myself and others have.\"", "description": "WARNING - GRAPHIC IMAGES: Gemma Griffin, six-months pregnant at the time of the attack, has shared the images as a warning", "authors": ["Samantha Yule", "Neil Murphy", "Image", "Swns.Com", "Lancashire Constabulary", "Swns"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20713593.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SWNS_HAMMER_ABUSE_008.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
