Companies such as Beyond Meat, Zoom Video Communications Inc. and Crowdstrike Holdings Inc. raced out to strong starts and easily doubled their IPO prices before falling back to earth. Others such as Lyft Inc., Uber Inc. and SmileDirectClub Inc. stumbled out the gate.\n\nRegardless of how investors greeted them upon their arrival, the expiration of the share lock-up period \u2014 during which certain insiders and early investors are prohibited from selling shares following the IPO \u2014 has been an unusually severe momentum-draining obstacle for many of the companies.\n\nAfter declining for weeks leading up to its lock-up expiration, Zoom Video has lost an additional seven per cent in the two weeks since, while Lyft has lost nearly 25 per cent since Aug. 14, when it surprised investors by announcing it had moved up its lock-up expiration date to Aug. 19 \u2014 one month earlier than expected.\n\nDespite delivering its first quarterly profit \u2014 beating analyst expectations \u2014 and raising its revenue outlook when it posted its third-quarter earnings Monday, Beyond Meat wasn\u2019t able to avoid the same downward pressure when its share lock-up expired Tuesday. The El Segundo, Calif.-based company has now lost 65 per cent of its share value since reaching its high of US$239 in July.\n\n\u201cWith all of these companies, the issue is about valuation,\u201d said Jay Ritter, a professor at the University of Florida who researches IPOs. \u201cIt was really difficult for me to justify (Beyond Meat\u2019s) valuation at the peak given other long-established food companies were also developing meat substitutes.\u201d\n\nCompanies such as Beyond Meat, Zoom Video and Crowdstrike all launched their initial public offering with tight floats, meaning that only a small percentage of each of their shares were placed on the market. The upward momentum, in part, could be attributed to high demand for low supply.\n\nWhen lock-up periods expire and the remaining shares hit the market, the momentum reverses. The flood of supply begins to outweigh the demand and puts downward pressure on share prices.\n\nAccording to Ritter, there has historically been a predictable drop associated with lock-up periods expiring. In the 1990s, IPOs that were not backed by venture capital declined an average of one per cent while those that did have VC ownership declined an average of three per cent. Between 2001 and 2011, those numbers decreased to average drops of zero and two per cent respectively.\n\nDo you want to have (a sell-off) happen 180 days after the public debut or do you want it to happen all at once? Triton Research co-founder Rett Wallace\n\nHedge funds and short sellers know that that drop is coming, Ritter said, and tend to contribute to it by increasing their short exposure to a name in anticipation of its lock-up expiration. On Monday, Beyond Meat was the most expensive U.S. stock to short, according to S3 Partners data, which attributed a hefty 92 per cent borrow fee to the company along with a total short interest of $560 million. After the drop on Tuesday, short sellers increased their positions by US$110 million.\n\nIn advance of its lock-up expiration in December, Crowdstrike has amassed US$353 million in short interest.\n\nMatthew Kennedy, senior IPO market strategist at Renaissance Capital, said the downward move is fairly common after lock-up periods expire but suggested that most of the individual cases could simply be a \u201cblip.\u201d\n\n\u201cMore often, the lock-up expiry doesn\u2019t have such dramatic impact on the stock price,\u201d said Kennedy, who referred to Beyond Meat\u2019s single-day drop as being \u201cmore dramatic\u201d than that of Lyft, Pinterest and Zoom Video. While each of the three is in the red since their share lock-ups expired, Lyft and Pinterest only fell 1.51 per cent and 1.35 per cent respectively on the day of expiration.\n\nMuch of the action, Kennedy insists, is being taken by private market investors who had their shares frozen and are looking to guarantee profits by cashing out. That exodus combined with the fears of retail investors surrounding lock-up expiration have led to names such as Beyond Meat trading closer to what he considers their fair value.\n\nThe lock-up may appear to have a negative effect on stocks, but Triton Research co-founder Rett Wallace said it\u2019s crucial for an IPO to include one. It allows companies to put their focus on the launch itself and on establishing a long-term shareholder base without worrying about how many private market investors are going to dump the stock, he said.\n\n\u201cThe nerdy academic thing to say is this is why we have lock-ups,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cDo you want to have (a sell-off) happen 180 days after the public debut or do you want it to happen all at once?\u201d\n\n\u2022 Email: vferreira@nationalpost.com | Twitter: VicF77", "description": "Brace yourself \u2014 so-called unicorns have been hitting the skids when the prohibition on selling the stock is lifted", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/beyond-meat-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
