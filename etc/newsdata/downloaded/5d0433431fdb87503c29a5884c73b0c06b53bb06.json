(Shannon Stapleton/Reuters)\n\nWhat on earth is so wrong with a 15-year-old wanting to ask the neighbors for candy on Halloween?\n\nLast year, I wrote about how a law in Chesapeake, Virginia allowed for the jailing of 13-year-olds who dared to go trick-or-treating.\n\nThis year, they softened up the laws. A statement on the city\u2019s official Twitter account, posted October 1st, reads, in part:\n\n\u201cEarlier this year, the Chesapeake City Council voted to remove the (never before used) penalty of jail time from the ordinance, and to raise the age limit from 12 to 14. This makes our ordinance one of the least restrictive in the entire Hampton Roads region.\u201d\n\nNow, you might think that I\u2019d be quick to applaud this move, and leave Chesapeake alone this year. But guess what? You\u2019d be wrong. Rather, I\u2019d characterize the new law as a shift from \u201ccompletely and totally insane\u201d to \u201cstill insane, but less\u201d because \u2014 and I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m coming off as an anarchist here \u2014 I just don\u2019t think that the proper role of government is to protect people from kids wanting to get candy on a holiday that\u2019s centered around kids getting candy.\n\nSeriously, Chesapeake \u2014 what on Earth is so wrong, so dangerous, about a 15-year-old wanting to ask the neighbors for candy on Halloween? What else do you want them to do? Get a fake ID; go to the club wearing fishnets, a thong, and rodent ears; and get blackout drunk? Meet a random, go home with him, and walk home the next morning \u2014 still wearing the fishnets and the thong, the rodent ears left behind somewhere covered in UV Blue-stained vomit? I mean, sure, those may be sorts of activities are more typical of Adult Halloween, but seeing as you\u2019re putting a limit on them engaging in the childhood one, I\u2019m not sure you\u2019re giving them much of a choice.\n\nThe truth is, one of the best things about being 15 years old is that things like candy are still exciting. Once you get older, once you\u2019ve been knocked down enough by this cruel thing we call life, that just won\u2019t be the case anymore. Eventually, you\u2019ll become jaded. Eventually, you\u2019ll have to try harder than a free king-sized Reese\u2019s to make you feel alive. Eventually, you\u2019ll become an adult. And guess what? It sucks.\n\nKids only have a certain number of years to be kids, and the last thing we should be doing is incarcerating them for wanting to make that short-lived magic last. Personally, I trick-or-treated all throughout high school, and I am proud to say that I still have managed to be not dead, nor have I ever caused the death of another. In fact, I even beat teen pregnancy, and I\u2019m not addicted to drugs!\n\nI\u2019m a fair person, and so I\u2019d be totally willing to reconsider if I could see some (any!) benefit coming from a law like this, but I really just can\u2019t. It\u2019s true: I can\u2019t think of even a single way in which society suffers because of a 15-year-old trick-or-treater.\n\nThe United States of America is supposed to be a free country, and its law enforcement is supposed to exist to protect and serve its citizens. Although I may not know any of the Founding Fathers personally (they never return my calls) I am still confident in saying that I\u2019m pretty damn sure they did not rebel against British rule to create a nation where a child\u2019s freedom could be taken away for asking for candy on a holiday that\u2019s all about children asking for candy.\n\nSo, Chesapeake: Get rid of this still insane law. You may pride yourselves on being the least insane out of all of Hampton Road; however, being the least insane one an obvious asylum is hardly something to brag about.\n\nIf you don\u2019t change it? Well, don\u2019t be surprised if you see kids staggering around in fishnets and thongs, stuck somewhere in the space between hungover and still drunk, on November 1st \u2014 and don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you if you do.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: This article originally stated that Chesapeake had not amended the law that banned trick-or-treating for those over the age of 12. It has been corrected and we regret the error.", "description": "I\u2019d characterize the new law as a shift from \u201ccompletely and totally insane\u201d to \u201cstill insane, but less.\u201d", "authors": ["Katherine Timpf", "Robert Verbruggen", "Andrew C.
