I was way too serious when I was that age. I\u2019ve found my 20-year-old alter ego, it just happens to be in this body. But that\u2019s okay. I\u2019m having fun and I love it.\u2019\n\nJane credited her enviable physique with pilates, walking and light weightlifting as well as a healthy diet that excludes sugar and fried foods.\n\nShe said that a \u2018naughty night\u2019 usually consists of \u2018a handful of pistachios, two pieces of very dark chocolate and a glass of wine.\u2019\n\nStunning: The former Bond girl, 68, said she has had to convince producers that she can do \u2018old and gnarly', in order to get a diverse range of parts (pictured in July)\n\nThrowback: Jane is most famous for her role as Bond girl Solitaire in 1973's Live And Let Die and she has barely aged a day since then with her youthful appearance\n\nLast year, Jane said that she was hesitant to have too much cosmetic surgery on her face as she wouldn\u2019t be able to show emotion on screen.\n\n\u2018I need my face to move, if it doesn\u2019t move, I can\u2019t play the characters.

I don't do Botox and I'm happy to fly the flag for older women,' said the former Bond girl.\n\nOut now: Read the full interview in this week's edition of Hello magazine\n\n'I've got plenty of wrinkles though.

I'm very happy to do so.'\n\nMeanwhile, Jane, who has been married and divorced four times, is currently in a relationship with 70-year-old British director David Green.\n\nBut despite walking down the aisle four times, she has insisted that she won\u2019t be tying the knot for a fifth time.\n\n\u2018At the moment I don\u2019t see any reason to get married again.
