Advice not taken. Am married\u201d\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "David had just graduated in the US when he went to China, aged 22, to teach English, with one instruction from the dean of his college: not to fall in love. \u201cSo I didn\u2019t have any sort of intentions of romantic involvement at all,\u201d he says. He arrived at Yunnan University in the summer of 1989, weeks after the protests in Tiananmen Square.\n\nIn October, he asked to accompany a British teacher on a three-day trip through Yunnan province. She had already asked Yurong, who had studied English at university, to go with her as a translator. \u201cI was waiting for them at the bus stop and, when they walked over, he was this tall, young guy,\u201d says Yurong.\n\nThey spent all of their first day on the train. \u201cPeasants got on and got off with their livestock, their grain,\u201d says Yurong. \u201cThere were people selling food. David was able to speak some basic Chinese, but I was the main person who helped them to communicate. He was sitting across from me and I was looking at him thinking: \u2018His eyes are really beautiful.\u2019 He was also very easy to talk to.\u201d\n\nWhat does David remember about Yurong? \u201cThe Chinese wanted to treat foreigners in a very particular way, keep us in our own corner, but she was very laid-back,\u201d he says. He was concerned she would think he wasn\u2019t up to eating local food and feared three days of bland, foreigner-friendly dishes. \u201cI said: \u2018Make sure mine are spicy.\u2019 She turned to the guy that was selling the noodles and said: \u2018He wants his extra-spicy.\u2019 I was eating this bowl of chilli noodles and she was smiling at me \u2013 she had a sense of humour, which I was attracted to.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The couple in their early days.

Their companion went to bed early and David and Yurong took a walk along the railway tracks out into the fields. \u201cWe made lots of jokes about what was surrounding us, the people walking by. Getting to know each other,\u201d says Yurong. She was walking on the rail, with David holding her hand \u2013 \u201cto keep her steady\u201d, he says. \u201cIt seemed the right moment \u2013 and right height? \u2013 to kiss, so we did.\u201d\n\nBack in Kunming, they were concerned about rumours of their relationship getting to Yurong\u2019s family. \u201cSo, we had to make a decision about our relationship really quickly \u2013 there was no halfway,\u201d says David. \u201cBy day five, we had decided we did want to be a couple and she had to tell her parents.\u201d They also had to put up with attention from people unused to seeing a western man with a Chinese woman. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like you have no privacy,\u201d says Yurong. \u201cWe just had to ignore lots of the stares and not be bothered by that.\u201d At the same time, another western teacher called David was rumoured to be seeing several young Chinese women. \u201cWhen rumours about us got back to my university, they all thought it was that David, not me,\u201d says David. \u201cSo we had this unintentional free run for a couple of months.\u201d\n\nYurong wouldn\u2019t normally have considered marriage so quickly, but they had to think about visas. So, in March 1990, after months of paperwork, they tied the knot. David sent a telegram to the dean of his college: \u201cRegrets. Advice not taken. Am married.\u201d\n\nThey moved to the US in July 1990, 10 months after they had met, where they both pursued careers in academia, specialising in Chinese history and occasionally working together. Since then, they have split their time between the US and China, and brought up their two children bilingually and biculturally.\n\nIn Mandarin, the same word can be given different meanings by using different tones. \u201cWith one word, one tone can mean virtuous and another means stupid. A friend said we were virtuous and I think it\u2019s the other way around, that we were stupid,\u201d says David, with a laugh. \u201cWe went into it without realising what was ahead of us and it just worked out.\u201d\n\nWant to share your story?
