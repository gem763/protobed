We just played well across the board - on offense, defense and special teams - and just made plays in all three phases of the game,\" he said.\n\n\"We got field position out of the kicking game, moved the ball on offense and held them to three points on defense, so give the players the credit. They were ready to go and we will turn a page here and move on to Miami.\"", "description": "While quarterback Tom Brady was willing to talk about Antonio Brown on Sunday, Bill Belichick refused to discuss the wide receiver.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/DcOuKT.PiaEPA_isltmqwA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/dKkhe8ZLyALM03sDI0W8nw--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/omnisport.uk/bcaf52cee84dae7dce1aad7bc57e9c08", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
