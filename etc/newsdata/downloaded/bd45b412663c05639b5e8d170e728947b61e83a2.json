REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon\n\nIt was a triumphant return to the tour for Djokovic, who had withdrawn from the U.S. Open in the fourth round due to a shoulder injury, and it was the 10th time he had won a title on his tournament debut.\n\nThe top seeded Serb needed only 69 minutes to dispatch Millman \u2014 who was playing in his maiden ATP 500 final \u2014 and the 32-year-old won the title without dropping a set in the tournament.\n\n\u201cIt was a fantastic week in every sense,\u201d Djokovic said. \u201cI felt great on the court... (I) didn\u2019t drop a set, played really well, served great. Just overall, a great experience.\n\n\u201cWe had a tough battle in the first set. (In) the second set I stepped it up, started swinging through the ball even better than the first set. Overall, it was a great tournament for him.\u201d\n\nDjokovic won a whopping 87% of his first service points and fired six aces, never giving Millman a whiff of a break point. He also broke the Australian ranked 79 places below him three times in the match.\n\nMillman was simply no match for Djokovic, who fired 23 winners and also won eight of 12 points at the net.\n\n\u201cIt sounds silly to say but I hope everyone all around the world realises just how good you are,\u201d Millman, 30, said at the trophy presentation. \u201cYou\u2019re an absolute champion and you\u2019re the type of person who\u2019s going to be remembered forever.\n\n\u201cYour legacy is continuing to build and will just live on long after you\u2019ve finished playing but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve got a fair few more years left.\u201d\n\nDjokovic has already qualified for next month\u2019s season-ending ATP Finals in London.", "description": "World number one Novak Djokovic won his first Japan Open title and the 76th of his career with a dominant 6-3 6-2 win over Australian John Millman in the final in Tokyo on Sunday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191006&t=2&i=1437655170&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF95066", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
