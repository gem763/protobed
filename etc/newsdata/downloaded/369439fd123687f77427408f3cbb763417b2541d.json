Anyone remember Corey Lewandowski\u2019s audition for this role? As Allahpundit wrote a little over a week ago, it was \u201ca freak show all the way through,\u201d backfiring on Democrats who thought they could intimidate Lewandowski into coloring within their lines. Instead, Lewandowski flummoxed House Judiciary Democrats so badly that their own caucus ripped them for not stopping him from making the hearing into a laughingstock.\n\nNow CNN reports that the House Judiciary Committee might have to deal with Lewandowski again \u2026 and again \u2026 and again:\n\nCorey Lewandowski, the political operative who helped elect Donald Trump, has had conversations with White House officials in recent days about potentially taking a position inside the administration to help the President confront a looming impeachment fight. The discussions, including a Thursday afternoon meeting at the White House, reflect the growing recognition among Trump\u2019s allies and advisers that he is without a clear strategy for managing the crisis, which exploded in stunning fashion this week. Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign manager would be in a crisis management type role, and the idea as it currently stands would be for Lewandowski to assemble a team that mirrors the one that existed in Bill Clinton\u2019s White House when he was facing his own impeachment. The list of potential players on the team includes David Bossie, his former deputy campaign manager who angered the President earlier this year by soliciting funds using Trump\u2019s name. Bossie served as the chief investigator of the House Oversight Committee in 1997, helping scrutinize Clinton.\n\nLewandowski might not make many direct contacts with Judiciary in this role, but it will be clear what his approach to an impeachment process will be. To put it mildly, cooperation will not be the overall goal of the White House under Lewandowski\u2019s leadership, nor with Trump either, for that matter. In that sense (only), Lewandowski might be the perfect man for the position. With Nancy Pelosi\u2019s caucus still struggling to come to terms with the idea, though, a more cooperative approach might keep Pelosi from getting enough votes to sustain an impeachment. Picking Lewandowski all but guarantees a party-line vote to impeach Trump.\n\nBut would Lewandowski want the job? Supposedly, he\u2019s preparing to run for the Senate in New Hampshire. In fact, he even used the hearing to tease out a run against Jeanne Shaheen next year. There is no way Lewandowski can do both at the same time. Even if the House fails to impeach Trump, the bloody battle will do its damage to Lewandowski, and in an evenly split state like New Hampshire, that damage would doom his campaign \u2014 assuming he had any time at all to run it.\n\nStill, if Trump wants to adopt an in-your-face approach, no one gets more in your face than Lewandowski. Even PBS wondered last week what Democrats thought they were going to get from subpoenaing him and giving Lewandowski a national platform. They will certainly know that they\u2019re going to get a \u201ccircus\u201d with Lewandowski the next time, even if they don\u2019t subpoena him to testify. If Trump wants to burn it all down, Corey\u2019s his guy, for better and worse.\n\nUpdate: Lewandowski says it\u2019s news to him, but \u2026.\n\n\"I have [had] no discussion with anyone in the White House about a job,\" @CLewandowski_ tells me. He did not clarify whether he spoke to anyone about leading such an effort (impeachment pushback) from outside 1600 Pennsylvania. \u2014 Francesca Chambers (@fran_chambers) September 26, 2019\n\nDon\u2019t forget that Lewandowski made it clear during his hearing that he feels no particular compunction to be honest with the news media. That might be a feature rather than a bug for Trump, of course.", "description": "Circus act.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cl.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
