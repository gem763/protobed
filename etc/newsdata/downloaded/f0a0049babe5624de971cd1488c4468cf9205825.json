Earlier, the U.S. government widened its trade blacklist to include some of China\u2019s top artificial intelligence start-ups.\n\n\u201cThe market was down because the headlines were negative coming into the U.S.-China negotiations. With Powell not changing the narrative, it makes sense that on further signs of deterioration in trade that the market would sell off,\u201d said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta.\n\nLosses were broad-based, led by a 2% drop in the interest-rate sensitive S&P 500 financial index .SPSY, while the Philadelphia Semiconductor index .SOX dropped 3.1%.\n\nA Bloomberg report said that Washington was moving ahead with efforts to limit capital flows to China, while a South China Morning Post report said China had toned down expectations ahead of the talks in Washington.\n\nIn his remarks, Powell also said the time has come to allow the Fed\u2019s asset holdings to begin to expand again, and that the Fed would \u201csoon announce measures to add to the supply of reserves over time.\u201d\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 313.98 points, or 1.19%, to 26,164.04, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 45.73 points, or 1.56%, to 2,893.06 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 132.52 points, or 1.67%, to 7,823.78.\n\n\u201cThe overall tone from the Fed is showing a little more concern,\u201d said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird in Milwaukee.\n\nMarket expectations have increased that the Fed will cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point in October, according to CME Group\u2019s FedWatch tool.\n\nThose bets were bolstered on Tuesday by data that showed U.S. producer prices unexpectedly fell in September.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., October 3, 2019.
