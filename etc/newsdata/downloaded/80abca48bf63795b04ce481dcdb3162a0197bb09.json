But now Dr Gabe Mirkin says putting ice on the sprains and pain could do more harm (file image)\n\nHe told the Sunday Telegraph: 'Actually working out how to gradually reintroduce activity and start weight-bearing takes a lot of prognostic activity.\n\n'This [Dr Mirkin\u2019s comments] should be a significant moment, but I don\u2019t know how many physios will hear the message.'\n\nWhile it has seemed common sense to 'keep still for a few days' and chuck a bag of frozen peas on the sprain, Dr Mirkin's protocol has been updated since the 1970s.\n\nIn 2015 Dr Mirkin backtracked on his findings, which he put forward in The Sportsmedicine Book, and tentatively said ice could 'delay' healing.\n\nHis RICE analogy started to come into question as he wrote about how applying ice prevents inflammatory cells rushing to the injured tissue which then releases the Insulin-like growth factor hormone (IGF-1) which helps the muscles heal.\n\nWriting on his blog, he said: 'Coaches have used my 'RICE' guideline for decades, but now it appears that both Ice and complete Rest may delay healing, instead of helping.'\n\nDr Mirkin's theory has been revised multiple times since the 1970s and Dr Mirkin has written about how there was almost no evidence of ice's quick healing power across 22 scientific articles, on his blog. Athletes cooling their injuries only delayed healing rather than hastened it (file image)\n\nHe cited a study where athletes exercised so intensely that they developed severe muscle damage but the results showed cooling delayed rather than hastened recovery.\n\nAcross 22 scientific articles there was almost no evidence of ice's quick healing power, according to Dr Mirkin's blog, suggesting ice has not been clinically proven as a recovery method.\n\nThe American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) said ice-patches could discourage patients from being active in 2014 and a spokesperson for the Chartered Society of Physiotherapists agreed they could harm patients with chronic pain.\n\nIce-patches could discourage patients from being active, The American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) said in 2014. The Chartered Society of Physiotherapists agreed they could harm patients with chronic pain (file image)\n\nDr Mirkin's comments have now caused the CSP to call on professionals to stop using ice to treat pain and wounds, according to the Telegraph.\n\nThis shows the growing awareness that swelling post-injury is a sign of white blood cells rushing to the damaged area and ice packs could stop the cell's activity promoting repair.\n\nThese cells are similar to 'conductors of the symphony', according to Dr Rachael Murray, former president of the Australasian Wound and Tissue Repair Society.\n\nSoaking in an ice bath might help athletes get back on to the pitch quicker but this is 'not the same as recovery' and the difference between the two gets blurred.", "description": "Dr Gabe Mirkin came up with the Rest, Ice, Compression and Elevation (RICE) acronym for treating injuries in 1978.
