Jackson's voice to Alexa and announces voice-controlled glasses", "language": "en", "text": "SEATTLE (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) on Wednesday said actor Samuel L. Jackson and other celebrities will voice speech for the company\u2019s virtual assistant Alexa, while the voice aid will also be built into a new wearable line of earbuds, eyeglasses and a ring.\n\nAmazon Senior Vice President David Limp announces \u201cEcho Buds\u201d headphones, with the company\u2019s virtual assistant Alexa built in, at a product launch at the company\u2019s headquarters in Seattle, Washington, U.S. September 25, 2019. REUTERS/Jeffrey Dastin\n\nThe news, along with announcements of a new range of voice-controlled Echo speakers, a multilingual mode for Alexa and an additional privacy feature for deleting voice recordings regularly, underscores the investment the world\u2019s largest online retailer is putting into voice-controlled computing, a new area of technology in which it is competing against Alphabet Inc\u2019s (GOOGL.O) Google Assistant and Apple Inc\u2019s (AAPL.O) Siri.\n\nAmazon\u2019s celebrity voice feature will cost $0.99, Senior Vice President David Limp said at an event in Seattle. Jackson\u2019s is the only celebrity voice Amazon has disclosed so far.\n\nIn a new push, the company introduced a lineup of wearables, including the Echo Frames, eyeglasses that allow customers to communicate with Alexa as they walk around.\n\nLimp said the frames are designed so that only those wearing them can hear Alexa talk. They do not include a visual display, distinguishing them from Google Glass, which is marketed toward enterprise customers.\n\nThe new \u201cEcho Buds\u201d come with noise reduction technology from Bose, Limp said.\n\nSince Amazon announced its first Echo speaker in 2014, shoppers have purchased more than 100 million devices that come with Alexa, including microwaves, vacuum cleaners and even cars.\n\nThat has given the company the biggest market share for voice speakers among its rivals, according to research firm eMarketer.\n\nYet customers have been slow to adopt the growing range of tasks that Alexa can perform, often sticking to basic hands-free functions like directing the assistant to play music, set cooking timers or report the weather.\n\nThat may have underscored Amazon\u2019s calculus for courting celebrities to encourage users to turn to Alexa for a wider range of interactions.\n\nThe company on Wednesday also announced a deal with the Food Network television channel under which users of its Echo Show device, which includes a screen display, can tune in to celebrity chef Bobby Flay for inspiration on what to cook.\n\n\u201cI can get to be in basically any kitchen in the world, anywhere in the world,\u201d Flay said in a live promotional demo for the partnership.\n\nAmazon announced an update to its Echo Show, as well as new devices like the Echo Studio, Echo Glow and the Echo Flex.", "description": "Amazon.com Inc on Wednesday said actor Samuel L.
