Trichloroacetic acid, a main ingredient in the kind of chemical peel you would get from an esthetician or a dermatologist, is easy to obtain but it\u2019s not safe to use yourself at high concentrations.\n\nThat\u2019s because applying strong acids to your skin literally eats away at the top layer of skin \u2014 and, if the acid is strong enough, deeper layers as well. The Odyssey reports that DIY skin peels have become a thing on Instagram and YouTube, often featuring acids that are not appropriate for home use. The makeup artists who demonstrate these peels often end up with what look like serious burns.\n\nAnd you should never be doing chemical peels on yourself because you risk causing a chemical burn if you don\u2019t properly neutralize or prep your skin. And you might be contraindicated for a peel and perform it\u2014then you react. Always seek a professional for peels. \u2014 Your Skincare Fav\u2122\ufe0f (@caveofbeauty) September 13, 2019\n\nWhile you can find instructions for at-home chemical peels online, dermatologists and estheticians everywhere emphasise that anything beyond an extremely superficial peel is something you need to do with a professional. An esthetician can perform some types of peels; deeper ones are the territory of physicians.\n\nEither way, a professional will check for contraindications, or reasons that you should not do a peel, which may include sunburns, previous treatments that damaged the skin, and certain medical conditions or medications. They can also make sure that your skin is prepared for the procedure, and that the peel you want is actually able to give you the results you are looking for.\n\nMost importantly, they will try to make sure that the peel doesn\u2019t go any deeper than it\u2019s supposed to, and they\u2019ll help you with after care. For example, you may need to wear sunscreen constantly for days to months afterward to avoid further damage.\n\nSo no matter how good those Instagram results look, remember that chemically burning your own skin is a thing to do with professional help, if you choose to do it at all.", "description": "Just because you can buy something online, doesn\u2019t mean you should.
