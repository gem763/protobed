The club is 3 1/2 games behind the Cubs for the second NL wild card, with wins in eight of its last nine games.\n\nKelly (10-13) became the fifth Diamondbacks rookie to win 10 games. The 30-year-old right-hander struck out nine and walked two, becoming the fourth rookie in team history to throw seven shutout innings with nine or more strikeouts.\n\n\u201cBeing able to get through that seventh and saving the bullpen an arm as we go down the stretch and try to make this wild-card push, we need everybody ready and as healthy and sharp as we can,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cGetting that many innings and using only three guys out of the pen \u2026 that\u2019s a lot more satisfying then going five (innings).\u201d\n\nBradley struck out Nick Martini to wrap up his 11th save after surrendering a run on two hits and two walks.\n\nWil Myers drove in San Diego\u2019s run.\n\nJosh Rojas and Jake Lamb had an RBI each during Arizona\u2019s two-run first inning against starter Ronald Bola\u00f1os. The 23-year-old right-hander made his major league debut after being called up from Double-A Amarillo on Monday.\n\nRojas singled in leadoff hitter Ketel Marte after Marte\u2019s triple, and Rojas scored on Lamb\u2019s fielder\u2019s choice.\n\nBola\u00f1os (0-1) settled down and lasted six innings, allowing two runs and five hits with four strikeouts and two walks. His fastball consistently reached the high-90s mph.\n\n\u201cTo watch a young kid settle in and start to punch a few guys out and execute under stress, it was a really good first outing in the big leagues for him. I wish we could put some runs across the board for him and give him an opportunity to win,\u201d Padres manager Andy Green said.\n\n\u201cI think I was a little bit anxious at first. That is normal for a lot of debuts but from there on out I was able to calm down and work pretty well for the rest of the game,\u201d Bola\u00f1os said through a translator.\n\nThe Padres put the first two batters of the eighth on base against reliever Kevin Ginkel, but after Ginkel struck out Martini and Manny Machado, Andrew Chafin came on and got Eric Hosmer to ground out.\n\nPAD-DING THE ROSTER\n\nThe Padres called up right-handers Eric Yardley and Gerardo Reyes from Triple-A El Paso, as well as infielder Seth Mejias-Brean.\n\nROOKIE ROULETTE\n\nKelly made his 28th start, giving the Diamondbacks a club record 61 starts by rookies this season. That\u2019s most in the majors, two ahead of San Diego.\n\nBALLPARK ECHOES\n\nTuesday\u2019s announced attendance of 15,402 was the smallest crowd at Chase Field this season.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nPadres: IF Fernando Tatis Jr. was transferred to the 60-day injured list with a stress reaction in his lower back. Tatis, placed on the 10-day list on Aug. 16, was not expected to return this season.\n\nDiamondbacks: OF Adam Jones was back in the lineup for the first time since being hit by Yimi Garcia\u2019s pitch late in a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers on Aug. 31.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPadres: RHP Chris Paddack (8-7, 3.69 ERA) starts against the Diamondbacks on Wednesday. He\u2019s allowed only one earned run in each of his two starts against Arizona in this his rookie season.\n\nDiamondbacks: RHP Zac Gallen (2-4, 2.79) is set for the series finale against the Padres. Arizona is 4-1 in his five starts.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Merrill Kelly gave the Arizona Diamondbacks' bullpen some needed rest with one of his best starts of the season.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jose M.
