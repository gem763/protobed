Steve Bullock has a sparkle in his eye like someone who doesn\u2019t take himself too seriously, especially as he engages in the caucus convention of touting his Iowa roots.\n\nHe injects a verbal eye roll as he points out that his mother was born in Ottumwa and that his great-great-grandfather homesteaded in Henry County in the 1850s. His audiences chuckle, as intended \u2014 they\u2019re in on the joke.\n\nBut don\u2019t make the mistake of laughing off Bullock\u2019s candidacy, even though he barely registers in Iowa and national polls. While Bullock faces some formidable challenges, he brings some assets that are unique in the overstuffed Democratic field and should be considered by those who want nothing more than to defeat Donald Trump next year.\n\nWestern charm and a common touch: Bullock is one of only a few candidates who can claim to be a true Washington outsider, and his ability to connect with real folks outside the Beltway is evident. For example, after an hour-long meeting with Register reporters and editors last week, he perched on a countertop in the conference room to chat about arranging his campaign schedule around the start of school for his three children. His charisma sometimes gets lost in shouty on-stage performances, but when he turns on the charm, he can match any of the top names in the race.\n\nCLOSE Steve Bullock discussed the Obama campaign in rural U.S. and Democratic verdict after February on August 21. Des Moines Register\n\nLast governor standing: With last week\u2019s departure of Washington state\u2019s Jay Inslee, Bullock is the only governor left in contention for the Democratic nomination. That\u2019s significant, considering four of the past 10 presidents (George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter) had served as governor. While relative newcomers Barack Obama and Donald Trump were able to snare voters\u2019 attention in recent cycles, governors are the ones who have to get their hands dirty and work with a legislature to get things done. \u201cThey can\u2019t claim credit, as some of the U.S. senators and representatives in the race do, for introducing good ideas that go nowhere,\u201d as one editorial board member put it.\n\nRed-state record: Bullock can tout some genuine progressive accomplishments, including expanding Medicaid, freezing college tuition and limiting dark-money campaign contributions. Those achievements came while working with a Legislature that he likes to point out is \u201cmore Republican\u201d than Iowa\u2019s. For that to work, GOP lawmakers have to see why it\u2019s in their constituents\u2019 interests to act.\n\n\u201cYes, I try to build relationships with my Republican legislators, but I don\u2019t rely on those relationships alone,\u201d he said. \u201cI actually go out into communities and get folks talking to their legislators.\u201d\n\nAs one editorial board member noted: \u201cHe talked with the confidence of someone who knows from experience what it takes to run a government. He seemed free of rancor and focused on getting things done.\u201d\n\nMontana Gov. and 2020 presidential candidate Steve Bullock meets with the Register's editorial board on August 21, 2019 in Des Moines. (Photo: Olivia Sun)\n\nConnecting with Trump voters: Bullock was elected statewide three times in Montana: once as attorney general and twice as governor. He likes to brag that he won re-election in 2016 by 4 percentage points while Donald Trump won Montana by 20 points. About a quarter of Bullock\u2019s supporters also voted for Trump. \u201cI showed up and I listened,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Democrats don\u2019t always show up where we should.\u201d\n\nHe noted: \u201cIf we\u2019re a party that can only connect with the coasts, we\u2019re never going to change what Iowa is right now, with two Republican houses and the governor, which is now 22 states. We want to win back some of those places. It might be a good idea to have somebody at the top of the ticket that\u2019s actually won in a red state.\u201d\n\nPragmatism as blessing and curse: Part of what may make Bullock appealing to general-election voters could hurt his candidacy with caucus and primary voters who want to see bold, progressive policy initiatives.\n\nBullock\u2019s agenda is as much about what he\u2019s against as what he\u2019s for. He calls \u201cMedicare for All\u201d bad policy and politics and instead opts for expanding the Affordable Care Act with a public option. He argues for the urgency to address climate change, including rejoining the Paris accord and adopting fuel-efficiency standards. But he scoffs at some of the perceived excesses of the so-called \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d \u2014 such as the idea that Democrats want to \u201cget rid of all of the cows.\u201d His record of trying to balance the interests of his home-state coal industry with Obama-era emissions standards has not endeared him to some environment-focused constituencies, despite his strong convictions about protecting public lands.\n\n\u25ba More caucus first impressions: Michael Bennet pounds some truth into the campaign (includes links to remarks on Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg and other candidates).\n\nCLOSE Gov. Steve Bullock discussed universal background checks and mandatory buy-backs on guns with the Register on August 21. Des Moines Register\n\nHis record on guns is also more likely to appeal to rural general-election voters than urban progressives. Although he now supports universal background checks and an assault weapons ban, he\u2019s arrived at those positions since his last gubernatorial campaign. He argues against a mandatory buy-back for assault weapons: \u201cOne of the reasons why we\u2019ve got to this point is the NRA has been really, really effective at saying, 'The government\u2019s going to come in and take away all of your guns.'\u201d\n\nThese very contradictions are what could make Bullock a serious contender for the votes of people who are alarmed by the leftward/socialist lurch of the Democratic Party; people who want a candidate who can win back Obama-Trump voters more than they want ideological purity on issues. We\u2019ll have to wait and see whether there are enough of those types of voters to even get him back on the debate stage, let alone launch him past the early-state caucuses and primaries.\n\n\u2014 Kathie Obradovich\n\nThis editorial is the opinion of the Des Moines Register\u2019s editorial board: Carol Hunter, executive editor; Kathie Obradovich, opinion editor; Andie Dominick, editorial writer, and Richard Doak and Rox Laird, editorial board members.\n\nWant more opinions?
