We were all arguing backstage in the dressing room with a couple of your producers. And yes, I feel like I identify as sapiosexual.\"\n\n\n\nHowever, Mark has now said in an interview with Rolling Stone that he wasn't attempting to 'come out' when he made the comments.\n\nAdmitting that he wasn't fully informed about what it means to identify as sapiosexual, Mark said, \u201cI do not consider myself part of any marginalised community and I apologise if anybody misunderstood or took offence to it.\u201d\n\nMark said he later realised that his comments about sapiosexuality could be misinterpreted as him 'coming out'.\n\n\"It sounds like I went on a TV show to be like, \u2018Guys, I have some big news!\u2019 And the fact that I would go on and sort of declare myself \u2014 like as a heterosexual white male \u2014 part of any marginalised community was terrifying to me, or just embarrassing,\" he explained.\n\nWhile Mark has been criticised for not being informed about sapiosexuality, others believe that those who identify as sapiosexual can't be considered a marginalised group in the same way as other members of the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nLmao Mark Ronson came out...sort of??? \u2014 Azealia\u2019s Rant Wig (@turnandstomp) September 19, 2019\n\ni'm happy the guy fancies clever people - so do i. but maybe let's not use the language of oppression (\"comes out\") for something which has absolutely no negative social consequence or historic prejudice attached https://t.co/HIWiJshBXA \u2014 Sirena Bergman \ud83c\udf08 (@sirenabergman) September 20, 2019\n\nOne reddit user believes that \"personality preferences are not sexualities.\"\n\nYou aren't sapiosexual, you are just classist. Thank you for coming to my TED Talk. \u2014 Dr Eleanor Janega (@GoingMedieval) September 19, 2019\n\nMeanwhile, others think that \"sapiosexuality is the height of ~queer because cool~ing\" and that it's irresponsible and problematic to include sapiosexuality as part of the queer community.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "\"I do not consider myself part of any marginalised community.\"", "authors": ["Emily Gulla"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7GDtbDxoKJpBz_FF45tTnQ--~B/aD0xNDQwO3c9Mjg3OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmo_633/8a0a72a17b73e4d26420da21b0064603", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
