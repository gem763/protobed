Barr reportedly worked with Pence\u2019s policy team to draft the legislation, and it\u2019ll likely be included in a White House package of gun safety proposals that go to Congress.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said earlier this month that he wanted mass murderers to face the death penalty \u201cquickly\u201d and \u201cdecisively,\u201d and \u201cwithout years of delay.\u201d He was reacting to shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, which together left more than 30 people dead.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. attorneys are seeking the death penalty for the El Paso shooter on federal hate crime and weapons charges. Earlier this month, Democrats urged Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to push senators to vote on House-passed universal gun background checks legislation. McConnell previously refused to bring the legislation to the floor.\n\nTrump\u2019s stance on gun control has varied widely over the years. After saying there was a \u201cvery strong appetite\u201d for background checks in the wake of the Dayton and El Paso shootings, he backtracked, casting doubt on their effectiveness against gun violence and instead blaming mass shootings on mental illness.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the last four or five \u2014 going back, even five or six or seven years, for the most part, as strong as you make your background checks, they would not have stopped any of it. So it\u2019s a big problem. It\u2019s a mental problem. It\u2019s a big problem.\u201d", "description": "President Donald Trump wants the death penalty process streamlined for mass shooters, and the Justice Department announced that it has drafted legislation.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6d6c4b2500005500014802.jpeg?cache=araxwab2n0&ops=1778_1000"}
