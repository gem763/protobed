Food tech startup Muy landed a fresh $15 million Series B to expand into Mexico and soon Brazil. The service is currently operative in Colombia.\n\nMuy is a \u201ccloud kitchen meets Chipotle,\u201d says one investor. The company describes itself as a virtual kitchen and smart chef system that uses AI to produce food based on forecasts of demand, which can help to reduce food waste. Muy, translated from Spanish to English as \u201cvery,\u201d allows users to place personalized orders in one of Muy\u2019s physical restaurants or through a mobile app. Muy\u2019s concept also exists as 20 physical dining locations offering what it says are quick, fresh and personalized dishes. Founder Jose Calderon says Muy is serving more than 200,000 dishes per month.\n\nThe round was led by Mexico-based investor ALLVP, with previous investor Seaya returning. The $15 million Series B brings MUY\u2019s total funding to $20.5 million.\n\nCalderon is no newcomer to the takeaway experience space. He previously raised $47.7 million for a Colombian online food ordering startup called Domicilios, which he exited to Delivery Hero.\n\nThe explosion of delivery apps has kept options competitive for customers not only in the U.S. but across Latin America. The congested highways of S\u00e3o Paulo, Mexico City, Bogot\u00e1 and beyond are filled with motor couriers running deliveries with Rappi, UberEATS and the like.\n\nCalderon notes that cloud kitchens are poised to make on-demand ordering and delivery more efficient in these high-density cities due to the long commute times that keep the growing middle class out of their homes for extended periods of 12 hours or more.\n\nAlternatives like full service restaurants can be prohibitively expensive and time consuming, and traditional casual restaurants don\u2019t meet quality standards. A large part of the market, around 40%, brings a lunch to work, says Calderon. But as disposable income increases, he predicts that more people will avoid cooking at home and will opt for faster and higher-quality options like Muy.\n\nCloud kitchens \u2014 the fully equipped, shared, commercial grade spaces for restaurant owners \u2014 have left U.S. investors balking. Journalists have described these virtual spaces as \u201cghost kitchens\u201d and many have noted the threat they pose to independently owned restaurants. My colleague Danny Crichton wrote that \u201ccloud kitchens are the WeWork for restaurant kitchens,\u201d adding that suddenly sharable kitchen space will lead to bidding wars between these virtual food brands.\n\nThis rhetoric isn\u2019t hindering the rise of cloud kitchens and the services that support them from launching in the U.S. and down to Latin America. According to Calderon, the food service market opportunity in Latin America will reach $270 billion by 2021.\n\nThe founder also notes that the Latin America market is highly fragmented; the top 10 chains only hold around 5% of market share in comparison to countries like the U.S. where this figure reaches 24%. \u201cLarge players will consolidate and win, and small ones will face pressure,\u201d he says.\n\nLarger incumbents have already begun to dip into the cloud kitchen opportunity. Earlier this year, Amazon took a $575 million bite into Deliveroo, which opened its first shared kitchen in Paris in 2018. City Storage Systems, the holding company of CloudKitchens, was backed with a $150 million controlling stake from Uber founder and ex-CEO Travis Kalanick.\n\nFor better or worse, delivery apps and cloud kitchens are revolutionizing the way we eat in the U.S., Asia and now in Latin America. The winners among the various global delivery apps, cloud kitchens and controlling incumbents have yet to emerge, but what we do know is that everyone needs to eat lunch.", "description": "The cloud kitchen craze has reached Latin America.
