Freiburg may have a fraction of the budget of Bundesliga heavyweights but Christian Streich\u2019s formidable team so far has the best defence in the league with only three goals conceded.\n\nThey also have a club record 10 goals after four matches, bettered only by Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund.\n\n\u201cYou could say it is the tactics, but it\u2019s all mentality, it is all in the head,\u201d Streich said after his team\u2019s 3-0 win at Hoffenheim.\n\nHERTHA MISERY\n\nIt is exactly the opposite story for Hertha Berlin, whose new coach Ante Covic has yet to celebrate his first Bundesliga win and is under mounting pressure following their worst start since 1972.\n\nHertha lost 2-1 at Mainz 05 for their third loss in a row with the visitors\u2019 defence being a shadow of the solid backline of previous seasons under Pal Dardai.\n\nWith only three goals in four games their frontline is equally weak.\n\n\u201cThere is not always a clear solution in football,\u201d forward Davie Selke, who hit the post, said. \u201cThere is no answer why we are not scoring when we carve out our chances.\u201d\n\nFILE PHOTO: Soccer Football - Bundesliga - RB Leipzig v Bayern Munich - Red Bull Arena, Leipzig, Germany - September 14, 2019 Bayern Munich's Robert Lewandowski celebrates scoring their first goal with Thomas Muller and team mates REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch DFL regulations prohibit any use of photographs as image sequences and/or quasi-video\n\nPIZARRO FIRSTS\n\nClaudio Pizarro has done almost everything in his 20 years of Bundesliga but in their 2-1 win at promoted Union Berlin even the 40-year-old Werder Bremen forward, who is the league\u2019s all-time second-highest scoring foreign striker, found himself in new territory.\n\nHe had never played at the Alte Foersterei stadium before Saturday and he was forced to come on late in the unexpected role of a defensive midfielder.\n\n\u201cThis 10-minute appearance of Pizarro on the six position is not something you train often,\u201d Werder coach Florian Kohfeldt said.", "description": "Five talking points from the Bundesliga weekend", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430354027&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F0BA", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
