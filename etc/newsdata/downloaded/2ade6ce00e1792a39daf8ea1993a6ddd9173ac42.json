It's been a tough year-and-a-half and we thought it was quite a basic conclusion.\"\n\nDuring the final day of the inquest, South East Coast Ambulance Service paramedic James Lyle revealed that numbers of emergency call handlers were \"grossly under the required level\" at the time of the tots death.\n\nMr Lyle has repeatedly recommended improvements since, but said it was tricky to retain call handlers because of the \"high levels of stress\".\n\nConcluding the inquest at Archbishop's Palace on Monday, Coroner Roger Hatch said that giving the two-year-old a small sausage was \"unwise\" and noted there had been a delay in reaching a call handler.\n\nHe also said the endotracheal tube was found in the wrong place, but added Mia's chance of survival from choking was \"extremely slim\".", "description": "Mia Atkins' mum had to call the emergency services three times as inquest told Kent call centre was 'grossly understaffed'", "authors": ["Gregory Kirby", "Sean Mcpolin", "Chris Kitching", "Image", "Beth Ranger", "Swns.Com", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20755423.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SWNS_CHOKE_INQUEST_001.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
