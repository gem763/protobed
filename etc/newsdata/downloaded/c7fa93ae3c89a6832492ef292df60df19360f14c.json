They refused to leave as she got treatment.", "language": "en", "text": "Yet that\u2019s what appears to have happened to the undocumented woman on Sunday, according to advocates who had spoken to her family, as authorities called the ambulance and then followed her to a nearby hospital. The agents stayed with her inside the emergency room for nearly five hours on Sunday, refusing to budge even as doctors and nurses came to ask her questions and give her medication.\n\nAD\n\nThomas Kennedy, who filmed videos documenting the incident, told The Washington Post the incident raises questions about the line \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 between immigration enforcement and emergency medical care. He declined to name the woman out of concern for her safety.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cA hospital should be a place where a patient is protected from interrogation,\u201d Kennedy, the political director at the Florida Immigrant Coalition, said in an interview. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have a Border Patrol agent right there with you while you\u2019re getting treatment.\"\n\nHigh-profile incidents in recent years have drawn attention to Border Patrol\u2019s role in hospitals along the U.S.-Mexico border, where agents have allegedly handcuffed asylum seekers to their beds or rushed migrants to the emergency room after they\u2019ve gotten sick in detention.\n\nAD\n\nLess has been documented about Border Patrol\u2019s place in hospitals elsewhere in the 100-mile \u201cborder zone,\u201d where the agency can operate with a heightened kind of authority. That area, which encompasses a majority of the U.S. population, includes any point in the country that\u2019s within 100 miles of a coastline, Canada or Mexico \u2014 including the entirety of states like Florida, Michigan and Massachusetts.\n\nAD\n\nIn the border zone, agents can stop and question anyone they suspect of having committed immigration violations, as authorities indicated they had done on Sunday.\n\nThe woman, her ex-husband, and two children were driving home from Haulover Beach Park when they were pulled over by a Border Patrol car, its sirens ringing. She is in the U.S. illegally, officials said.\n\nAD\n\nUpon apprehending the woman, Border Patrol took her to nearby Aventura Hospital and Medical Center, less than 30 minutes north of downtown Miami, where an agent insisted on remaining inside Emergency Room No. 26 as she received medical attention. For nearly five hours, the agent stayed put, either inside the room where the woman was being treated, or right outside an open door.\n\nA representative for Customs and Border Protection, which oversees the agency, said in a Monday statement that agents had called the ambulance, accompanied the woman and then taken her to a Border Patrol station, according to \u201cstandard processing procedures.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBorder Patrol\u2019s Miami office \u201cdoes not conduct any enforcement operations in hospitals,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cHowever agents will transport persons in custody and remain with them until medically treated and cleared.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCBP\u2019s written policies note that its officers, which includes Border Patrol, should call an ambulance when a detainee starts experiencing a medical emergency, such as a heart attack or trouble breathing. At least one agent must follow the ambulance until medical officials decide if they need more attention, according to CBP policy.\n\nThe rule provides little clarity about what should happen if and when a detainee is hospitalized. Besides documenting the incident, an agent must \u201cfollow their operational office\u2019s policies and procedures,\u201d the guidelines say. A detainee\u2019s private medical information must be protected and \u201cdisseminated only to those personnel with a legitimate need to know.\"\n\nAD\n\nKennedy charged that didn\u2019t happen. The hospital acted \u201cirresponsibly\u201d by allowing the agent to stand inside or so close to the room, he said, and may have violated patient privacy rules under the HIPAA Security Rule.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis woman is under extreme duress,\u201d he said he told the officer. \u201cHaving a Border Patrol agent right now is not safe for her information. She\u2019s not in the right state of mind to be questioned.\u201d\n\nA viral video posted to Twitter by another Florida Immigrant Coalition staffer shows Kennedy and other members of the group clashing with the Border Patrol agent and questioning why he needed to stay with the woman as she received medical attention.\n\nSouth Florida, we need an #immigration lawyer ASAP!\n\nAt Aventura Hospital a woman is currently in the ER while ICE is waiting outside her room to take her into detention. Officer refuses to provide a warrant & the hospital is not protecting the patient.

Who told you that?\u201d the official told them in Spanish.\n\n\u201cTo be here, you need a warrant,\u201d Kennedy shot back.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need a warrant. Where did you get that from?\u201d the agent insisted.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the law.\"\n\n\u201cWhat law? What do you know about the law?\u201d the agent said, before a hospital employee cut off the conversation in English: \u201cAlright, I\u2019m going to ask you guys to step outside.\u201d\n\nImmigration attorney Alexandra Audate, who arrived a short time later, said the patient was not allowed to consult a lawyer away from the Border Patrol agent, thus making it difficult to receive proper legal advice.\n\n\u201cNo one should have to be subjected to having a perfect stranger in a hospital room while discussing their medical history or having an emergency medical need,\u201d Audate told The Post. \u201cThere should be certain boundaries.\u201d\n\nThe incident ultimately points to what some immigration advocates and medical professionals say is a growing trend of aggressive enforcement tactics hurting patients\u2019 access to care.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cU.S. and international laws protect the right to nondiscriminatory access to health care for all individuals,\u201d the nonprofit group Physicians for Human Rights wrote in a June report. \u201cBut, in certain instances, loopholes permit enforcement actions in medical facilities which interfere with this right.\u201d\n\nEstrella Madrigal, a 23-year-old from Honduras, said she was never allowed to speak in private with the doctors treating her at a Tucson hospital after she crossed the border and asked for asylum.\n\n\u201cI just kept my mouth shut,\u201d she told Arizona Public Media, adding that she did not mention the physical abuse she had suffered before coming to the United States.\n\nAD\n\nIn other instances, Border Patrol also appears to have detained immigrants while they\u2019ve sought out medical care \u2014 a tactic that advocates say can keep others from getting help when they\u2019re sick.\n\nAD\n\nIn October 2017, an undocumented 10-year-old girl with cerebral palsy, Rosa Maria Hernandez, was arrested in Texas while being transferred from one hospital to another. Two years earlier, a woman was put into deportation proceedings when she presented fake ID at a gynecologist appointment in Houston.\n\nIn Florida, the woman faced a fate that advocates said can cause similar sorts of fearmongering, or put others seeking treatment in the hospital at risk: Once she was released from the Aventura facility, Border Patrol put her back in their vehicle and drove her away, Kennedy said. As of late Sunday night, her family and lawyers were still trying to locate her.\n\nImmigration enforcement just escorted a patient out of @AHMCAventura. There was no regard for her privacy or continuity of care. Aventura Hospital failed to adhere to any medical ethics during this process. We will keep folks updated as we know more. pic.twitter.com/SIyBwRFRyO \u2014 Anmaar Javed Habib (@ajhabibinator) October 13, 2019", "description": "The incident at Aventura Hospital in South Florida raises questions about the line between immigration enforcement and emergency medical care.", "authors": ["Teo Armus", "Reporter On The Morning Mix Team"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/K8SZfa98teq0zdF20RaMmTh5x-M=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FGNC42NSNRBCVHYX2DDBLL3RLA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
