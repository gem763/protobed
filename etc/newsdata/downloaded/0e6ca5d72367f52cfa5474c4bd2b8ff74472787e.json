At 26.5cm across, it works pretty well for most cakes, too.\n\nBuy now\n\nHouse Doctor rustic cake stand: \u00a355.50, Trouva\n\nThis light grey porcelain stand has a low profile with a wide base, and has a beautiful, rustic finish. It will be just as at home in a minimalist Scandi-style home as a country farmhouse. It\u2019s quite subtle, so we like to use it for things other than cake too \u2013 croissants, fruit, and cheese and biscuits have all graced ours.\n\nBuy now\n\nCanvas Home Abbesses cake stand red rim: \u00a329, Canvas Home\n\nThis cake stand is named after Abbesses, a pretty, charming Parisian district, and it more than lives up to its name. A brick-red rim elevates the otherwise simple, minimalist design to something more distinctive; it\u2019s also available with a green, grey or blue lip.\n\nBuy now\n\nAnthropologie Glinda cake stand: \u00a347, Anthropologie\n\nThe Glinda stand is the most unusual we\u2019ve seen as it\u2019s made not from the usual porcelain or earthenware, but from capiz shell, giving it a beautiful iridescent glow. Its hypnotic spiral grooves add to the ethereal feel. At 33cm across it\u2019s one of the widest we\u2019ve seen and it looks its best piled high with pillowy pavlova.\n\nBuy now\n\nFortnum\u2019s St James two tier cake stand: \u00a3125, Fortnum & Mason\n\nWho better to provide the display for your sweet treats than afternoon tea royalty Fortnum & Mason? This two-tier stand is made from fine bone china and features the British Institution\u2019s signature eau de nil, a minty blue-green. The plates are edged in gold.\n\nBuy now\n\nMosser buttercream green glaze milk glass cake stand: \u00a359.95, The Cake Decorating Company\n\nMilk glass was a popular import in 1930s America and originals are very popular collectibles. This one is slightly more affordable, however and has the same beautiful, glossy, opaque finish. It\u2019s also a slight, elegant shape, both 23cm across and tall.\n\nBuy now\n\nWest Elm marble + brass 2-tier cake stand: \u00a333, West Elm\n\nFor a minimalist modern twist on the classic Fortnum\u2019s two-tier stand, West Elm\u2019s brass and marble (yes, real marble) stand has two completely flat plates, 30cm and 25cm across, and a simple metal pole running through the middle. When it\u2019s not covered in scones or biscuits, we like to arrange a full cheeseboard across it.\n\nBuy now\n\nBerylune melamine cake stand: \u00a324.95, Not On The High Street\n\nMelamine makes a good dupe for milk glass: it has the same glossy finish and rich opaque colour, but without the high price point and is more durable, too. Berylune\u2019s come in six colours, including deep green and plummy pink, but for the true vintage feel, opt for a pastel shade.\n\nBuy now\n\nBordallo Pinheiro cabbage cake stand: \u00a339, Arket\n\nPortuguese artist Raphael Bordalla Pinheiro\u2019s vegetable-shaped earthenware has inspired many copies, but the original is still the best. His cabbage-leaf cake stand has a beautifully textured surface, and we love to the contrast of the green with delicately coloured buttercream.\n\nBuy now\n\nGreta black stoneware cake stand: \u00a325, Habitat\n\nFor a more dramatic, modern look, this, from Habitat, is a low stand with a sturdy base, made from black stoneware. It\u2019s a great choice for those who find most cake stands too delicate and pretty, and the dark colour gives a dramatic contrast with your baked goods.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Cake stands\n\nJohn Lewis & Partners' porcelain stand is modern, elegant and affordable, while Mosser\u2019s milk glass is a vintage-style classic. For something a little different we love West Elm\u2019s marble and brass two-tier stand.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
