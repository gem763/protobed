Faye added: \"I felt like I had been stabbed in my left leg. It instantly began burning up and I thought it was probably just a silly mosquito bite, so I went into the pool to cool it off.\n\n\"But as I went in, my leg started to burn up more and my toes began bleeding, which I thought was odd, but dismissed it until the next morning, as I didn't want to waste anybody's time. I woke up in the middle of the night with shooting pain up and down my leg. I collapsed on the floor.\n\n\"I think they thought I was just another British drunk who had fallen over, but even though I told them I hadn't sprained it, they sent me back to the hotel with a pair of crutches.\"\n\nFaye trusted her gut instinct and left her sister in Benidorm and flew home, but had to be wheeled on to her flight. She said: \"I was too weak to walk on my own and I began being sick every five minutes as I boarded the flight.\"\n\n(Image: Faye Wilkes / SWNS)\n\nFaye begged the cabin crew to phone her an ambulance to pick her up from Gatwick airport when she arrived.\n\nShe was admitted to intensive care in Royal Surrey Hospital and diagnosed with sepsis. Her foot was covered in blisters, and doctors warned they may have to open up her leg and flush out the infection, or if that didn't work - amputate her leg.\n\nShe said: \"I was absolutely horrified, as I didn't think a measly bite from a bug in Benidorm would result in sepsis, let alone the loss of my leg.\n\n\"They couldn't find the bug in my system, so were unable to work out which one caused me to have sepsis, but I'm glad that I went to the hospital when I did, as I was close to death.\"\n\nDoctors told Faye that if hadn't got to the hospital she could have been dead within 24 hours.\n\n(Image: Faye Wilkes / SWNS)\n\nShe said: \"Although they got rid of the infection, my foot and leg is still scarred and my circulation is awful, so I have to keep it propped up near enough 24/7.\n\n\"I think it was either a dirty spider or mosquito that brought this pain and distress upon me - but I will never know.\n\n\"The main thing is that I'm alive and I still have my left leg and foot - but I know I still have a long way to go until I'm out of the woods. I had to learn to walk again and build up my strength.\"", "description": "WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT Medics in Benidorm, Spain, thought she was just worse for wear but the painful truth nearly cost Faye Wilkes a leg", "authors": ["Amy Walters", "Sam Elliott", "Image", "Faye Wilkes", "Swns"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20688536.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_SWNS_SPIDER_BITE_006.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
