Now She\u2019s Writing for Herself.", "language": "en", "text": "Woodson hadn\u2019t entirely planned on writing for young people. She had always wanted to write everything, across genres and media; her inspirations were figures like Langston Hughes, Maya Angelou and Nikki Giovanni. But she credits that class at the New School with guiding her to look at the interior lives of children. \u201cI thought, Here is where my voice can be heard,\u201d she says. \u201cHere is where my voice is very necessary.\u201d\n\nIn 1985, of the estimated 2,500 children\u2019s books published in the United States, only 18 were by black authors or illustrators, according to research by the Cooperative Children\u2019s Book Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Last year, of the 3,653 books submitted to the C.C.B.C., 202 were by African or African-American writers and illustrators \u2014 a notable but imperfect improvement. There were many factors in this change, but many in the industry will tell you that Woodson\u2019s decades of writing are among them.\n\n\u201cShe has just set a standard for herself and for others,\u201d says Kathleen T. Horning, the director of the C.C.B.C. \u201cI think when kids read her books, they feel like it\u2019s somebody who isn\u2019t making the world seem different from how it is.\u201d Jason Reynolds, a writer of children\u2019s and young-adult books, says Woodson has spent her career challenging the industry to help children understand themselves and their surroundings: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be this hokey, you know, apple-pie type of story. Nor does it have to be about slaves.\u201d He points to Woodson\u2019s middle-grade novel \u201cHarbor Me,\u201d published last year \u2014 a sort of \u201creimagining of \u2018The Breakfast Club,\u2019 \u201d he says, where students gather every week in a classroom to talk about their lives, like one child\u2019s fear that his missing father has been deported.\n\nWoodson\u2019s intuition for what motivates people \u2014 and her eye for capturing stories that are harder to find on the page \u2014 emerges even more in her adult literature. \u201cRed at the Bone\u201d revolves around a teenage pregnancy that draws together two black families of different social classes. Iris leaves her baby, Melody, at home in Park Slope to be raised by her family and the baby\u2019s father and tries to forge an independent identity for herself; the novel takes its name from her longing for another woman while she\u2019s a student at Oberlin, the way she \u201cfelt red at the bone \u2014 like there was something inside of her undone and bleeding.\u201d The older generations of Iris\u2019s family, we learn, fled the Tulsa Massacre to settle in New York City and try to rebuild their wealth, all the while knowing how tenuous that effort might be. \u201cThose white folks came with their torches and their rages,\u201d says Sabe, the matriarch whose mother was nearly burned to death as a child. \u201cTurned my people\u2019s lives and dreams to ash. So my mama taught me all I know about holding on to what\u2019s yours. I know you hold on to your dreams and you hold on to your money.\u201d In July, the writer Ta-Nehisi Coates took to Instagram to praise the book. \u201cThis is the wealth gap as literature,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut it never says that. Never didactic.\u201d Certain topics, he told me later by phone, can be difficult to communicate to people directly. \u201cIt\u2019s become really clear to me,\u201d he said, \u201cthat sometimes those things are better said in the form of stories and in fiction.\u201d\n\nThere is an urgency to Woodson\u2019s writing in the book, as though she\u2019s willing her characters to reveal the humanity of real-life people. Amid the increase of racist political rhetoric over the past few years, she said, working on the novel \u201cfelt like writing against such a tide.\u201d She recalled a conversation she had with her partner, Juliet Widoff, after Donald Trump announced his campaign for the presidency. \u201cJuliet was like, \u2018This is so ridiculous; this is such a joke.\u2019 \u201d But Woodson was traveling the country promoting her memoir and noticing what she describes as \u201ca lot of white rage.\u201d She disagreed: \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018He\u2019s going to win.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAnd in the world of children\u2019s books, she saw a related sense of agitation. There, white writers were trying to create characters of color but receiving criticism from people of color who felt that those stories were not being thoughtfully or accurately told and that they should be the ones telling them. These conversations were clearly new ones for some of the people involved, but they were entirely familiar to Woodson. Twenty-one years ago, in 1998, she wrote an essay in The Horn Book Magazine, a children\u2019s-literature journal, titled \u201cWho Can Tell My Story\u201d \u2014 a foundational piece that questioned whether white people who had only other white people in their lives were equipped to tell the stories of black, brown or immigrant folks. She wasn\u2019t particularly surprised to find herself, decades later, watching the same discussions unfold, only now in concert with vitriolic news cycles. She saw, she says, \u201ca lot of people panicking about diversity\u201d \u2014 a lot of people \u201ctrying to get a foothold of where they fit into the movement.\u201d", "description": "The award-winning author on her mission to diversify publishing \u2014 and why she turned back to adult readers with her new novel, \u201cRed at the Bone.\u201d", "authors": ["Kat Chow"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/22/magazine/22mag-woodson-image-02/22mag-woodson-image-02-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
