OpenSea said:\n\n\u201cWe appreciate the work you\u2019ve done exposing vulnerabilities in the auction system. [...] To compensate for the work you\u2019ve done to expose these vulnerabilities, we\u2019re prepared to offer you 25% of the winning bid price of each name you return. We\u2019ll also refund your purchase price.\u201d\n\nOne domain, coffeshop.eth, has already received a bid of 100 wrapped Ether (WETH), worth around $14,000 at press time.\n\nAustralian hacker stole $450,000 in XRP last year\n\nCointelegraph previously reported that Australian citizen Katherine Nguyen pleaded guilty to stealing $450,000 in XRP in January 2018.
