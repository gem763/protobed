First half I felt their energy \u2014 I was a little bit hyped and the adrenaline was pumping. I just needed to calm down.\u201d", "description": "Los Angeles (AFP) \u2013 The Nets, out to make Brooklyn the center of New York City\u2019s NBA universe, edged the Knicks 113-109 Friday, but not before", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/25/617b5d_brooklyn-kyrie-irving-drives-basket-new-york-knicks-elfrid-payton-in-nets-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
