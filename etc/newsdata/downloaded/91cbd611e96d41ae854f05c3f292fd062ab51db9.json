They are bouncing all over the place with no plan.\u2019\n\nSince then, Woodward has altered the football structure of the club and signed Harry Maguire, Aaron wan-Bissaka and Daniel James.\n\nHe\u2019s also reached out to the Class of 92 with Nicky Butt working at the club, but has been estranged from Neville.\n\nKeen to utilise former United stars in the same way that Liverpool have done, Ferguson favourites Darren Fletcher and Patrice Evra have been invited to the training ground at Carrington.\n\nWoodward would like to employ a former big-name player to work as a media ambassador and talk to British and overseas media to reflect the club\u2019s standpoint.", "description": "Woodward and Neville haven't spoken for five months with Neville increasingly strident on television in blaming the executive vice-chairman for the slump in form at Old Trafford.", "authors": ["Joe Bernstein For Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/21/19936708-0-image-a-25_1571517837977.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
