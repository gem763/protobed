Photo: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images\n\nAmy Sedaris is particular about her stuff. So particular, in fact, that when the Strategist site launched in 2016, her distinct kind of particular-ness when it came to shopping was discussed as one of our many inspirations for what the site could be. So when I visited her stuffed-to-the-brim one bedroom on a recent afternoon, it was not much of a surprise to find a Venn diagram of most every type of thing the Strategist covers: from surprising things that have multiple uses (the drugstore laxative she uses to steam her pores), to the relatively unexciting items she is determinedly specific about (she uses Heavy Duty Scotch Shipping Packing Tape \u2014 if it\u2019s not heavy duty, she\u2019ll, in her words, \u201chave a meltdown\u201d), to the useful and singular (like the Renova pink paper towels her brother David brings her back from London), to the decidedly useless but no less specific (like her plaster \u2014 not plastic \u2014 fake Cornish Hen).\n\nThe important thing is that no object in Sedaris\u2019s house carries less significance than the other: each, from her box of small hats (labeled \u201cSmall Hats\u201d) to the five real-hair wigs shelved in her bedroom, is a revered piece of her carefully curated, eccentric ecosystem. Below, some 50 of those items.\n\nAccessories\n\nPhoto: AmySedaris/Instagram Goody Ribbon Clips I was obsessed with these Goody bows when I was little. Now I find them on eBay. $18 at eBay Buy\n\nPhoto: The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon/YouTube Made-to-Fit Wig This wig was made for me at the University of North Carolina School of the Arts. It\u2019s all real hair. at University of North Carolina School of the Arts Buy\n\nAdam Selman Printed Ribbed Cotton-Blend Socks $11 (was $35, now 69% off) I\u2019m best friends with Adam Selman, and he makes these tube socks, which I\u2019m completely obsessed with. The quality is so nice and cushion-y and thin. Plus, the initials of his company is A.S.S., which is printed on the ankle of these. So I\u2019ve been sending them to assholes lately. $11 at Net-A-Porter Buy\n\nCrafting Tools\n\nPhoto: SiamHillTribes/Etsy Half-Inch Pom Poms I cannot live without pom-poms. I put them on everything: pillows, lamps. $10 at Etsy Buy\n\nPhoto: PartyFavorsPlus/Etsy Plain White Matches I buy a ton of plain white matchbooks so I can decorate them myself.

I like to think of it as a little hidden secret. From $7 at Talas Buy\n\nJean Roy\u00e8re $64 (was $90, now 29% off) This is one of my favorite books about decorating. I used it for inspiration when I was working on my TV show. $64 at Amazon Buy $64 at Amazon Buy\n\nBeauty Things\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Vendor Comme Des Garcons Avignon Eau De Toilette I have 13 bottles of Comme des Gar\u00e7ons\u2019 Avignon perfume, just in case they ever stop making it. $95 at Nordstrom Buy\n\nPhoto: EVER-SHiFTiNG-PARADiGM / Alamy Stock Photo/Alamy Stock Photo First Aid Cotton Swabs First Aid is one of the only companies making wooden swabs anymore, which is a shame. $5 at Amazon Buy $5 at Amazon Buy\n\nBuly 1803 Superfin Mexican Tuberose Soap Buly 1803 makes the most beautiful soaps. My brother David bought me the perfume version of this Tuberose one. $44 at Mr Porter Buy\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Vendor Swiss Kriss Herbal Laxative Flakes $7 (was $8, now 13% off) I use this herbal laxative to steam my pores; I\u2019ve never found anything better. Some people use it in tea when they\u2019re constipated. $7 at Amazon Buy $7 at Amazon Buy\n\nEpicuren Enzyme Concentrate Vitamin Protein Complex I keep this enzyme spray in every room of my house: bathroom, living room, bedroom, plus two in my office. I just spray it on all the time, whenever I look at it. $31 at Dermstore Buy\n\nEpicuren After Bath Moisturizer in Kukui Coconut My favorite body lotion is also from Epicuren, it\u2019s called After Bath Moisturizer. I like the Kukui Coconut scent. I use it every day, often twice. $40 at Amazon Buy $40 at Amazon Buy\n\nEpsom Salt Fresh Bath Soak I\u2019m obsessed with Epsom salts, obsessed with them. I take Epsom baths all the time. $5 at Target Buy\n\nBedding\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Vendor Pacific Coast Down Pillow The exact ones they used to use at the haunted Heathman Hotel. $95 at Amazon Buy $95 at Amazon Buy\n\nPhoto: Bates Mill Store Bates Mill Store Snowdrop Bedspread My rabbit, Tina, constantly chews these linen bedspreads up. Which means I buy about four sets a year. $100 at Bates Mill Store Buy\n\nKitchen Things\n\nPhoto: Formaggio Kitchen/gabigago Bonilla a la Vista Snack Potato Chips David hauls a huge drum of these on the plane from London for me. They\u2019re made with olive oil, and they\u2019re the best potato chips I\u2019ve ever had in my life. $70 at Amazon Buy $28 at Formaggio Kitchen Buy\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Vendor Renova Fuchsia Paper Towel 4-pack David also brings me back these Renova paper towels; he finds them at his local Tesco. $16 at Amazon Buy $16 at Amazon Buy\n\nPhoto: NoPro Norpro Deluxe Bean Frencher When I want to jazz up a meal, I\u2019ll get out my Norpro hand-crank bean Frencher. $23 at Amazon Buy $23 at Amazon Buy\n\nHome Repair\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Vendor Heavy Duty Metal Wall Brackets I have an abundance of L brackets, so I can put up shelves to hold all my stuff. Straight guys love L brackets. Every time a straight guy comes over he says, \u201cI wish you had some L brackets, so I could help you put up some shelves.\u201d And I say, \u201cwell I have an abundance of L brackets!\u201d $23 at Amazon Buy $23 at Amazon Buy\n\nD\u00e9cor\n\nPhoto: Kutimall/Etsy Mini Straw Hat My small box of small hats says small hats on it.

It sits at the foot of my bed. $145 at Collyer\u2019s Mansion Buy\n\nPhoto: Autom 100% Pure Beeswax Candles I get my beeswax candles from a church-supply site. Greek Orthodox churches have the most beautiful candles, so I figured a church supply website would be the place to go. I was right. From $89 at Church Supply Warehouse Buy\n\nCire Trudon Ernesto Classic Candle But I also love Cire Trudone\u2019s Ernesto candle. I\u2019m really serious about lighting candles for people when they come over. And this one burns really nicely. $95 at Forward by Elyse Walker Buy\n\nPhoto: Jean-store/Ebay Kylin Express Chair Knit Socks I got these little chair socks in Tokyo.

I look at it, then I hand it off to my friend Paul Dinello. $95 for 12 at Amazon Buy $95 for 12 at Amazon Buy\n\nSanta Maria Novella Cardboard Gift Box I\u2019m obsessed with empty boxes, it\u2019s the one thing I want to change about myself but cannot. When we were doing Sex and the City, I used to ask Sarah Jessica for her boxes, because she had amazing ones from Manolo and Herm\u00e8s. Santa Maria Novella boxes are really good. They\u2019re the perfect size for, say, a dead mouse. $4 at eBay Buy\n\nStuff for Tina the Rabbit\n\nPhoto: B&G Foods Green Giant Sweet Fixin\u2019s Julienned Carrots These are a big extravagance for Tina. I call them her french fries. She rarely gets them, because it\u2019s too much sugar. She also occasionally eats a tiny raisin, and in the morning, she gets half a banana slice. She\u2019s a lucky rabbit. $4 at Instacart Buy\n\nPhoto: Howcast; Howcast/Youtube Sweet Meadow Timothy Hay I order nine pounds of hay from a farm near Boston called Sweet Meadow. $7 at Cheshire Horse Buy\n\nPhoto: Drollery Press House Rabbit Handbook House Rabbit Handbook is the only good book on rabbit care.

I gift it to teens, because it\u2019s just a blast to use. $4 at Kryolan Buy\n\nFakes\n\nPhoto: Bellatopperandmore/Etsy Pastel Pink Fake Cake I used to make fake cakes.
