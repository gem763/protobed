It's more important to me that he learns from his mistake, and other people can learn from it too,\" she told the BBC.\n\nActress Tracey Ann Oberman, who has appeared in EastEnders and New Tricks, expressed her disgust in a tweet which has been liked and re-tweeted hundreds of times.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Eastenders and New Tricks actress Tracey Ann Oberman called on the student to apologise and \"donate to a Jewish charity of his choice\"\n\nMs Oberman, who has written for the Jewish Chronicle, said the photograph displayed 1930s \"levels of Nazism\" and called on the university to take action.\n\nOther social media users described the image as \"disgraceful\" and \"horrendous.\"\n\nHowever, another Twitter user commented: \"This is a joke pic, that's all. I'm Jewish and not offended.\"\n\nDisciplinary panel\n\nNottingham Trent University - which replied to the tweets by saying they take \"hate crime, including anti-Semitism, very seriously\" - confirmed the student was suspended earlier this week.\n\nIts spokesperson told the BBC: \"We launched an immediate investigation the moment we were made aware of a screen grab circulating on social media, in which NTU was mentioned in an individual's personal profile.\n\n\"We acted very quickly to identify an individual who had not yet started his first year at the university.\n\n\"An investigatory officer interviewed this individual and they were immediately suspended.\n\n\"As part of this investigation we have been told that a Palestinian flag had been superimposed onto the image.\n\n\"A disciplinary panel will now decide on appropriate action. We are proud of our diverse and inclusive community, and do not tolerate any form of hate crime, including anti-Semitism.\"\n\nDaniel Kosky, Campaigns Organiser at the Union of Jewish Students, welcomed the university's response.\n\n'We are pleased to hear about the swift action taken by Nottingham Trent University in launching an investigation and suspending a student.\n\n\"It will reassure Jewish students that Nottingham Trent University takes anti-Semitism seriously, and will act upon it if it appears on their campus.\"", "description": "Nottingham Trent has passed the matter to a disciplinary panel after the image spread on social media.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/247C/production/_109104390_416536e4-5da0-45de-8d1f-e62dea299519.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
