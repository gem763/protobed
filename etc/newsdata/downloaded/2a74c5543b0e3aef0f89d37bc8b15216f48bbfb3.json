Just look at what happened to Jeff Bezos with his phone being hacked and certain photos being leaked,' she told MailOnline in an email.\n\nRegular security practices involve changing one's password, using a password manager, and make sure you don't open any suspicious links (Stock image)\n\nThat being said, Levine says Musk's habit is far from sound when it comes to your average person.\n\n'This idea seems pretty absurd for the average person,' Levine said.\n\n'Switching out your phone would get rid of any malware that was installed on that specific device. However, it would not solve anything in terms of \u201cAccount Takeover\u201d attacks where the hackers gain access to your credentials and login information. Even on a new device this will be the same unless you change it.'\n\nLike most cyber security experts, Levine recommends the standard hygiene when it comes to protecting yourself from cyber threats.\n\n'Don\u2019t connect to a WiFi network you do not know, do not open links in text messages or emails from someone you do not know, do not download apps that are not legitimate,' she said.", "description": "In new legal documents, a SpaceX employee divulged that Musk systematically destroys his phones for 'security purposes' and then switches to brand new ones.", "authors": ["James Pero For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/21/19402154-0-image-a-12_1571432293571.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
