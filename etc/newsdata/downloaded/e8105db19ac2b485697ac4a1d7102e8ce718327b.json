I don't understand what the purpose of this was.\"\n\nCrucet responded that she came because she had been invited, and she spoke about white privilege \"because it's a real thing that you are actually benefiting from right now in even asking this question.\"\n\nShe continued: \"What's so heartbreaking for me and what is so difficult in this moment right now is to literally have read a talk about this exact moment happening and it's happening again. That is why a different experience, the white experience, is centered in this talk.\"\n\nSome students burned her book\n\nAfter her talk, Crucet tweeted that other students had come to her defense during the lecture and disrupted those making \"ignorant comments.\"\n\n\u2014Jennine Cap\u00f3 Crucet (@crucet) October 10, 2019\n\nLater, videos circulated on social media showing students burning Crucet's novel or ripping out pages.

We also value discussion and debate of important issues from all sides and perspectives,\" the department chair, Russell Willerton, told The George-Anne. \"We regret that Crucet's experience in Statesboro ended as it did. We call on students to remain civil in disagreement, even on difficult issues, and to make Georgia Southern University a place that we all can feel proud to represent.\"", "description": "A Georgia Southern University spokesperson told Insider burning was within students' First Amendment rights but didn't align with the school's values.", "authors": ["Michelle Mark"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da0bf52e94e862da71f0131?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
