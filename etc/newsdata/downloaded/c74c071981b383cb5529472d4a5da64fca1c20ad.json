Combined with Samoa and Tonga they provide almost 20% of the world\u2019s professional rugby players. Fiji are Olympic champions in sevens and just won the HSBC World Sevens Series again. Pacific Island players regularly sweep up the end-of-year awards in all the top leagues for player of the season and nearly every top try-scorer in those leagues is from the Pacific. So it\u2019s a no-brainer, right? Slap what\u2019s left of your recently remortgaged mortgage on a Fiji v Samoa World Cup final on 2 November? Maybe don\u2019t do that. Their actual fortunes in this World Cup will be very different.\n\nThe average difference in scoreline of Tier 2 teams v Tier 1 teams, as well as the margin of their biggest defeats, has been coming down every World Cup since 2003. That trend may well come to a grinding halt in Japan.\n\nRugby World Cup 2019: Samoa team guide Read more\n\nSteve Hansen, the All Blacks head coach, threw a few grenades at World Rugby after his side demolished Tonga 92-7 last weekend. He hit them twice \u2013 first about the lack of Tier 1 games for Pacific Island teams and then about the lack of financial support by World Rugby for those same nations.\n\nRugby\u2019s governing body was quick to respond to Hansen, saying a record \u00a360m support package for Tier 2 teams had been provided for the World Cup and its preparation and that 120 of the 150 coaches and support staff involved in those teams have been identified and funded by World Rugby.\n\nNothing was mentioned about Hansen\u2019s first point because it didn\u2019t have a defence. That punch landed and it is critical to finally getting a few more seats on that mahogany Tier 1 top table. Not only do the Tier 2 teams need more big games to get used to the intensity and learn from those encounters, but those top\u2011tier nations also need to agree to a share of the gate from those games to help significantly supplement what World Rugby provides.\n\nDo that and the beginnings of real change on the islands will be seen. Even a fraction of those profits will make a far bigger difference than World Rugby\u2019s aid ever can. It has worked hard to finance these countries but it does not provide all the solutions. Those unions are still generally underfunded and money is not always spent in the right areas.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest New Zealand\u2019s George Bridge skips clear of Tonga\u2019s defence to score a try during their one-sided international last week.

Yes it has coaches and staff paid for by World Rugby. They will have had their preparation camps paid for too. However, the targeted funding by which World Rugby operates has led to the majority of funds in the Pacific being channelled to Fiji over the past four years \u2013 this has left Samoa and Tonga to survive on even less. This has affected their coaches\u2019 visits to Europe and monitoring, with the knock-on effect of less communications with clubs and less access to players. Some World Rugby appointments to these unions are fantastic but some are because they could not get a job elsewhere. There is a reason for that and often local appointments are needed (on a fraction of those costs) \u2013 as much as an aspirational signpost for those local coaches and support staff.\n\nUntil Super Rugby gives a Pacific Island team a spot in their competition, cohesion is always going to be an issue.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, Tonga suffers from a serious lack of governance while internal politics in Samoa has led to a high turnover of coaches and players, both of which have caused big problems for those teams, but it is now about permanent positive change, not papering over the cracks. That means the competitions and the top unions actually helping and for World Rugby to take a harder line to make that happen and to enforce the right practices, procedure and governance in those Pacific unions.\n\nIn Pool D in Japan Fiji have got a real chance of knocking over Australia or Wales and going through to the knockouts. They have an excellent coaching and management team that have largely been together since the 2015 campaign. They have world\u2011class players, will have a good culture, won\u2019t worry about the schedules or have high demands and they will be incredibly resilient.\n\nWorld Rugby instigated a \u201cscrum factory\u201d in Fiji a few years ago to combat their front-row problems and it has worked well. Against them is preparation time compared to Australia and Wales. They have not had the intensity of matches compared to those two either. Finally, they have been formed from clubs all over the world in many leagues, not a small handful from one league in the way their major opponents have been. Cohesion is massive in team sport and, until Super Rugby gives a Pacific Island team a spot in their competition, then it is always going to be an issue.\n\nIt is unfair to just point at World Rugby and say it is wholly the governing body\u2019s fault that the islands are not maximising their potential. The major unions need to front up as do the major leagues and those island unions also need to improve.\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\nSuper Rugby\u2019s contractual demands mean there are more than 40 players in New Zealand and Australia franchises who could be available for Fiji, Samoa or Tonga making themselves unavailable because, if they are suddenly ineligible for NZ or Australia, their contracts could be in danger. That is just one example of countless changes required but they are all possible.\n\nMaybe as a result of going backwards in the World Cup on the field, it might all mean a move forwards in the future.\n\n\u201cVei Lomani\u201d, or translated into English \u201clove each other/work together\u201d, was the Fiji sevens motto at the Rio Olympics in 2016. For that same success in the XVs game, that is exactly what is needed across the game now.\n\nBen Ryan coached Fiji\u2019s sevens team to Olympic gold in 2016", "description": "Fiji, Samoa and Tonga export masses of rugby talent but deserve more equal resource sharing and better domestic management", "authors": ["Ben Ryan"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fcde387c6be9b8a9694840ce16f154fb8ac0f18/671_2_1923_1153/master/1923.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=d5189c66a370104a0f46a6e840dcfa1b", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
