Luckily, there are strategies to get back on track.\n\nBelow, financial planners share the most common mistakes, and how they help their clients recover.\n\n1. Failing to create a plan\n\nA retirement plan is one of the best ways to spot potential hurdles to long-term goals, says Nancy Skeans, CEO of Schneider Downs Wealth Management Advisors in Pittsburgh.\n\nCreating a retirement plan means estimating future expenses and expected income.\n\nBe sure to write it down. \u201cA plan is not in your head \u2013 it\u2019s on paper,\u201d Skeans says.\n\nWhere will you get income from in retirement? Look for these three streams\n\n2. Forgetting about taxes\n\nIf you\u2019ve been saving for a while, you might get excited when you peek at your balance. Don\u2019t forget that a chunk of that money \u2013 assuming it\u2019s in a 401(k), traditional IRA or similar tax-deferred account \u2013 will go to taxes.\n\nYou can\u2019t avoid taxes, but you can diversify with after-tax accounts. For example, with a Roth IRA, you put money in after you\u2019ve paid taxes. Then, your money, including investment earnings, comes out tax-free in retirement.\n\nAnother idea is to save money in a taxable investment account. You may owe taxes annually on capital gains or dividends, but those rates often are lower than regular income tax rates.\n\nOwning a Roth or taxable account in addition to tax-deferred accounts helps you manage your taxes in retirement. If distributions from a 401(k) or traditional IRA will push you into a higher tax bracket, you can use money from a Roth to keep your tax rate lower.\n\n\u201cWe always want our clients to have the most flexibility that they can,\u201d Skeans says.\n\n3. Overpaying on fees\n\nThere are many retirement-account fees to watch for, including mutual fund front-end loads and expense ratios, trading commissions, and account maintenance fees. All of these eat into investment returns over time.\n\nAt a minimum, look for low or free trading commissions and invest in exchange-traded funds or index mutual funds.\n\n\u201cThese are very low cost,\u201d says Lindsay Martinez, founder of Xennial Planning in Oceanside, California. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to pay a load for a mutual fund if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d\n\nStay prepared:3 retirement expenses you may not be planning for\n\n4. Tapping savings before retirement\n\nEmergencies happen, there\u2019s no doubt. But people sometimes pull money out of retirement accounts when it\u2019s not absolutely necessary.\n\nDoing so triggers taxes and a potential 10% penalty. Depending on your tax bracket, \u201cyou could wipe out close to half of what you\u2019re withdrawing with taxes and penalties,\u201d Martinez says.\n\nIdeally, bank some savings separately for emergencies, and save up for your financial goals.\n\n5. Taking on too much, or not enough, investment risk\n\nIt can be hard to get investment allocations just right. A good rule of thumb: If you have at least five years to let your money sit, harness the stock market\u2019s long-term growth to build your balance. You have time to ride out market volatility \u2013 your investments may lose value in a downturn, but they\u2019ll grow as the market recovers.\n\n\u201cYou can take on a little bit more risk,\u201d says Shaun Melby, founder of Melby Wealth Management in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nThe opposite is true for people who\u2019ll need their money in less than five years. Investing too aggressively in stocks could be a problem because you may have to sell investments that have lost value.\n\nRetirement:These 5 sources of income aren't taxable\n\n6. Failing to save enough\n\nSometimes, not saving enough isn\u2019t a mistake so much as a lack of resources. But no matter how the problem arose, there are ways to address it.\n\nIf you\u2019re older and retirement is coming up fast, working longer may be your best option.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t necessarily mean more years at a job you hate, says Ashley Coake, founder of Cultivate Financial Planning in Radford, Virginia. A lower-paying, part-time job could be enough to tide you over until you fully retire.\n\nKeep in mind, though, that working longer isn\u2019t always possible. Life, in the form of a health scare or job loss, can foil this plan.\n\nAnother strategy that works at any age? Trim spending. \u201cCutting back on expenses is a tough thing to do but that\u2019s a great way to make a huge impact\u201d on retirement savings, Coake says.\n\n7. Working longer than needed\n\nPeople in their 60s or 70s often come to Coake, saying they\u2019re tired of working and wondering when they can retire.\n\n\u201cHonestly, this happens a lot,\u201d Coake says. \u201cAnd I have to say, \u2018You could have retired three years ago.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not that surprising, Coake says. Figuring out how various investment and retirement accounts will create income, and how those accounts interact with Social Security, is complicated.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a really hard picture to put together in your head,\u201d Coake says.\n\nThat\u2019s where a written retirement plan comes in handy.\n\nMORE: See if you\u2019re on track with a retirement calculator\n\nMORE: Learn more with this complete retirement guide\n\nMORE: How to choose between a Roth IRA and traditional IRA\n\nAndrea Coombes is a writer at NerdWallet.
