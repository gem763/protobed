That's because funds generally reopen when performance is cool and shut when it's hot. I prefer to buy low and sell high, hence the bias toward reopening.\n\nGenerally, funds reopen at a time when they are in outflows and management believes that the fund has either shrunk to the point where it can handle more money, or it is suffering so many outflows that it would like some inflows to at least slow down the rate of outflows. A third option is when a fund was originally closed owing to concerns about hot money rather than overall capacity size, and it reopens when things have cooled off.", "description": "Evaluating the prospects of Vanguard Dividend Growth and three other recently reopened funds.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt4eb669caa7dc65b2/blt0b3599e1033702f6/5c76ba5c2617ffd7604a1e4c/RussKinnel_1x1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-06"}
