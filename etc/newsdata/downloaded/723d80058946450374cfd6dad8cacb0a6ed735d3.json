The US will follow.\n\nMarkit reports German Composite PMI sinks to lowest since October 2012.\n\nKey Findings\n\nFlash Germany PMI Composite Output Index at 49.1 an 83-month low.\n\nFlash Germany Services PMI Activity Index at 52.5 a 9-month low.\n\nFlash Germany Manufacturing PMI at 41.4 a 123-month low.\n\nFlash Germany Manufacturing Output Index at 42 an 86-month low.\n\nComments from Phil Smith, Markit Principal Economist\n\n\u201cThe manufacturing numbers are simply awful. All the uncertainty around trade wars, the outlook for the car industry and Brexit are paralyzing order books, with September seeing the worst performance from the sector since the depths of the financial crisis in 2009.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith job creation across Germany stalling, the domestic-oriented service sector has lost one of its main pillars of growth. A first fall in services new business for over four-and-a-half years provides evidence that demand across Germany is already starting to deteriorate.\u201d\n\nEurozone His Stall Point\n\nMarkit reports Eurozone Close to Stalling in September as Factory Downturn Deepens.\n\nKey Findings\n\nFlash Eurozone PMI Composite Output Index at 50.4 a 75-month low.\n\nFlash Eurozone Services PMI Activity Index at 52.0 an 8-month low.\n\nFlash Eurozone Manufacturing PMI Output Index at 46.0 an 81-month low.\n\nFlash Eurozone Manufacturing PMI at 45.6 an 83-month low.\n\nComments from Chris Williamson, Markit Chief Business Economist\n\n\u201cThe eurozone economy is close to stalling as a deepening manufacturing downturn shows further signs of spreading to the services sector.\n\n\u201cThe survey data indicate that GDP looks set to rise by just 0.1% in the third quarter, with momentum weakening as the quarter closed.\n\n\u201cThe goods-producing sector is going from bad to worse, suffering its steepest downturn since 2012, but a further worrying trend is the broadening-out of the malaise to the service sector, where the rate of growth has now slowed to one of the weakest since 2014.\n\n\u201cThe details of the survey suggest the risks are tilted towards the economy contracting in coming months. Most vividly, new orders for goods and services are already falling at the fastest rate since mid-2013, suggesting firms will increasingly look to reduce output unless demand revives.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, hiring is being scaled back due to the order book slowdown, with jobs growth now down to the lowest since the start of 2015. A worsening labour market adds to the risk that households could trim their spending.\n\n\u201cThe overall picture of an economy on the cusp of sliding into decline is underscored by a further deterioration in firms\u2019 pricing power, with average prices charged for goods and services barely rising in September.\n\n\u201cWith survey data like these, pressure will grow on the ECB to add to its recent stimulus package.\u201d\n\nMish Comments\n\nThis is not 2012 or 2104 where stepping on more QE would help. The US is not immune to a slowdown in Europe and China, just as China was not immune to a global slowdown in 3007.\n\nDecoupling Theory\n\nSome readers may recall that I correctly rebutted the widespread notion in 2007 that China would decouple from the global economy.\n\nOther readers may note that I failed to recognize that QE in 2012-2104 would help.\n\nThey are both correct.\n\nMish Policy\n\nI have a simple policy: Admit mistakes before someone forcibly admits them for you.\n\nIf you are looking for perfection, you won't find it here, or for that matter anywhere else.\n\nAdmissions aside, the notion that a third of the global economy will decouple from two thirds of it is silly.\n\nThe US is no more immune from a slowdown in China and the Eurozone today than China was immune from a slowdown in the US and the Eurozone in 2007.\n\nUS Will Not Decouple\n\nDecoupling theory is silly. The US will not decouple.\n\nEither the Eurozone and Chinese economies pick up, or the US slides with them.\n\nPlace your bets.", "description": "European manufacturing continues to dive, led by Germany.
