You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nA Thomas Cook collapsed under the weight of its \u00a31.7bn of debt early on Monday morning, and immediately prices on other airlines began to increase. The stock market reacted by marking up the value of rival tour operator Tui and the budget airline easyJet by 7 and 5 per cent respectively on the day.\n\nThe kinds of price hikes I have seen include basic last-minute packages about twice as expensive as you might expect at this time of year. Air fares, too, are soaring, especially on routes where Thomas Cook Airlines was dominant \u2013 such as London to Antalya in Turkey, costing \u00a3786 one way this week for a 1,800-mile hop from Gatwick on Turkish Airlines.\n\nBut these prices comprise a very specific reaction to the sudden reduction in capacity, with thousands of seats taken out of the market overnight, and an understandable desire by disappointed Thomas Cook customers to continue with their travel plans \u2013 even at a vastly increased cost. The hikes are driven by systems that raise prices sharply when they detect a surge in demand. But they won\u2019t remain at those levels for long.\n\nWhen other airlines and holiday companies see disproportionately high \u201cyields\u201d for flights and packages, they naturally react by starting to serve the relevant route or resort as swiftly as possible to extract a premium. And when a significant competitor goes under, as Thomas Cook so sadly did, they move in to grab departure slots at key airports while they decide on their commercial response. They will know, for example, that Thomas Cook provided prodigious capacity to southern Turkey, and may go some way to matching it.\n\nThe workings of the market mean that the more capacity that incoming airlines add, the lower the fares go. By around Easter 2020, when the summer season slowly starts, supply and demand are likely to have converged: carriers such as easyJet, Jet2 and Ryanair will have added capacity which will come close to matching the Thomas Cook flight programme.\n\nJet2 and Tui will also be looking to sign deals with many of the hotels that were formerly contracted by Thomas Cook, which should keep a lid on package holiday prices.\n\nQ Normally at this time of year I take a week\u2019s holiday, basically wherever is cheap (and sunny). As I believe you recommend, I just wait until couple of days ahead and find something suitable \u2013 either a package or independent. I want to travel on Sunday or Monday, 29 or 30 September. But it appears that I\u2019ve timed it all wrong because of the collapse of Thomas Cook and prices going through the roof. Am I going to have to settle for Devon, or can you suggest something from the London area?\n\nName withheld\n\nA The back end of September and first half of October should be a real buyers\u2019 market, with a week on a lovely Mediterranean such as Malta, Corfu or Crete in the low \u00a3200s. Indeed before the collapse of Thomas Cook, I bought from the firm a week\u2019s holiday in Corfu, departing from Stansted on 14 October, for just \u00a3187. But with around 30 per cent of short-haul package capacity taken out of the market, prices have soared. For a similar holiday I now face paying at least twice as much.\n\nIndependent travellers, too, are facing problems \u2013 because fares for outbound flights in the next few weeks have soared after Thomas Cook Airlines shut down on Monday morning.\n\nOn your behalf I have taken a look at appealing destinations where the sadly defunct carrier had no presence. Top of the list is Pula in northwest Croatia. The city is at the southern tip of the Istrian peninsula \u2013 a heart-shaped territory, slightly larger than Dorset, and joyful in autumn. Think of it as good-value alternative to Italy \u2013 with beautiful fishing ports, and inland a ripple of hills draped with vineyards, meadows and woodland. You will even time it well for the truffle season; the subterranean fungus enlivens dishes in Istrian restaurants at this time of year.\n\nThe best outbound flights are on Sunday. Ryanair (\u00a335) is cheapest but involves a 6.50am departure from Stansted. Later in the day Jet2 (\u00a349) offers a flight from the same airport. But easyJet at \u00a345 from Southend may suit you better.\n\nComing back a week later, the flights are much more in demand. But Ryanair at \u00a389 is still reasonable value; grab it soon. If it disappears, then head around the top of the Adriatic to Venice, where plenty of flights in the \u00a380s are available. And it\u2019s a great journey through Slovenia.\n\nQ The sad demise of Thomas Cook jogged my memory and I fished out some old travellers\u2019 cheques from the back of a drawer. Sure enough, they are branded Thomas Cook \u2013 and also carry the Mastercard logo. I\u2019m not sure exactly when I got them, but I wonder if they have any value?\n\nRobert J\n\nA The Thomas Cook collapse has been a tragedy for the 21,000 staff of the pan-European company, and distressing for many of the hundreds of thousands of customers who either were abroad at the time of the collapse or have forward bookings for holidays that will now no longer take place.\n\nThe failure also had some unexpected consequences \u2013 and, for me, one of them is the sheer number of people who still have travellers\u2019 cheques.\n\nThese antique foreign instruments were effectively invented by Thomas Cook himself, who devised the \u201ccircular note\u201d to help travellers manage their money abroad. Throughout the 20th century, these cheques were invaluable \u2013 providing a safe store for funds, because if they were lost or stolen, the numbers were cancelled and the company provided a swift and full refund.\n\nIn the US, dollar-denominated cheques could be used as cash in many retailers, restaurants and hotels.\n\nBut by the start of the 21st century, the travellers\u2019 cheque was looking decidedly retro, and now they are difficult to encase \u2013 even if the company whose name is on the paper is still in business, unlike Thomas Cook.\n\nFortunately, I have found a solution. The travel money business of Thomas Cook was taken over in 2001 by Travelex, and this organisation is honouring one of the liabilities it picked up at the same time \u2013 in the shape of travellers\u2019 cheques.\n\nYou can find the encashment form online easily, and cash them by post or in person at a Travelex retail bureau de change in the UK.\n\nUnsurprisingly, there is a fee: 5 per cent or \u00a37 (whichever is the higher) will be deducted from the final payment.\n\nNon-sterling cheques will also be converted at the prevailing rate of exchange on the day. You can call the Travelex travellers\u2019 cheque team on 01733 279760 for more details.\n\nQ I read about the new Saudi visitor visa, and wondered what you knew about it \u2013 as well as whether it\u2019s worthwhile or dangerous to go there?\n\nJames Y\n\nA As part of its process of modernisation and moving away from total dependence on oil revenues, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has revolutionised the process of obtaining a visa. Until now, the vast majority of visitors have been pilgrims making the Hajj to the holy city of Mecca.\n\nAfter news of the new visa scheme for 49 countries emerged yesterday, I applied for an e-visa and found the process very user-friendly: about as easy as a Turkish e-visa, and far more straightforward than an American Esta permit. The only tricky element is that you are supposed to give the name, phone number and email address of your first night\u2019s accommodation; I am now planning to stay at the Radisson Blu Corniche in Jeddah.\n\nThe cost is a punishing 463 Saudi riyals, today worth \u00a3100, but a quarter of that is for compulsory medical insurance. And unlike many other e-visas, it is valid for a year from the date of issue, and allows multiple visits.\n\nHaving read a fair amount about the country I am looking forward to going this winter \u2013 starting in Jeddah, which sounds an energetic and cosmopolitan Red Sea port city. Flights are expensive on Saudia and British Airways, but there are much cheaper deals available via Athens, Istanbul or Cairo.\n\nThe leading archaeological location is Mada\u2019in Saleh \u2013 the Saudi version of Petra in Jordan. Like Petra, the city was hewn from solid rock by the Nabateans. Unlike Petra, it has very few visitors.\n\nThe country also has mountains rising to 10,000ft amid some spectacular highland scenery.\n\nBy all accounts (well, at least that of Lonely Planet co-founder, Tony Wheeler) Saudi Arabia is welcoming, friendly and easy to get around.\n\nHowever, the regime is conservative and intolerant of dissent \u2013 during the visa process you are warned \u201cpublications related to any religious beliefs or political tendencies that contradict with Islam are prohibited in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\u201d.\n\nA recent Amnesty International report said: \u201cThe authorities used the death penalty extensively, carrying out scores of executions. Despite limited reforms, women faced systemic discrimination in law and practice.\u201d\n\nThe Foreign Office warns about a range of threats, and urges against travel within 50 miles of Yemen, but I think a greater risk is posed by the \u201chigh number of serious accidents\u201d on the roads. Flying is a safer prospect than long-distance road travel.\n\nEmail your question to s@hols.tv or tweet @simoncalder", "description": "Q\u00a0You have written about the sharp increases in air fares and holiday prices since the collapse of Thomas Cook, but it\u2019s all been about the next few weeks and months.
