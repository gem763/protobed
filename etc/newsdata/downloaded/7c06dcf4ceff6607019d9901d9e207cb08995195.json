\u2018average\u2019 size.\n\nBut in her mid-20s, she started to pile on the pounds.\n\n\u2018It happened when I was newly married.\n\n'I was happy and I wasn\u2019t being careful about what I ate,\u2019 says Tasha, who works in payroll.\n\nBefore she knew it, as she approached 30, she was a size 22 and weighed 19 stone.\n\nBut there was another reason Tasha had turned to food.\n\n\u2018Some of it was comfort eating, because about a year after getting married, my husband Ross and I started trying for a baby and it just didn\u2019t happen.\n\n\u2018I have lots of dreams, but the main one was starting a family.\n\n'I\u2019m the eldest of four and had a lovely childhood.\n\n\u2018We were trying for about five years and thought it was never going to happen.\n\n'We had all sorts of tests, but doctors couldn\u2019t ever find a medical reason why I couldn\u2019t get pregnant.\u2019\n\nTasha had tried losing weight in the past, but she didn\u2019t think size was an issue when it came to having a baby.\n\n\u2018Friends my size had had little ones, so why shouldn\u2019t I?\n\nI didn\u2019t see why my weight was such a problem.\u2019\n\nEventually, after almost giving up hope on having the family they craved, Tasha and Ross decided to try IVF.\n\nBut Tasha was in for a shock when doctors told her she needed to lose weight.\n\n\u2018They said I had to reduce my BMI to 30 before we could even begin IVF, because if I didn\u2019t, it was far less likely to work.\u2019\n\nThe news hit home with Tasha.\n\n\u2018I\u2019d tried diets before but nothing had worked.\n\n'However, this time I was so determined and totally focused.\n\n'I badly needed to change my eating habits.\u2019\n\nTasha would often skip breakfast \u2013 but then have a packet of crisps when she got to work.\n\n\u2018For lunch I\u2019d go to the supermarket and buy a pasty or a triple sandwich with white bread and cheese and mayonnaise, which I\u2019d have with a fizzy or sugary fruit drink.\n\n\u2018I\u2019d probably have a couple of snacks in the afternoon, perhaps another bag of crisps \u2013 I love crisps \u2013 and a bar of chocolate and more unhealthy drinks.\u2019\n\nTea would involve ridiculously portioned meals \u2013 \u2018My husband has always been able to eat what he wants and stay slim\u2019 \u2013 like a bowl of nachos each, with loads of cheese and a bowl of chilli with spoonfuls of soured cream, cheese and pitta bread.\n\n\u2018Then I\u2019d probably have another bag of crisps and a bar of chocolate or sweets.\u2019\n\nReaching her goal\n\nTasha managed to lose a couple of stone on her own by calorie counting and going to the gym, before she realised she needed help.\n\nShe chose The Jane Plan, which creates healthy meals that are delivered to the client.\n\n\u2018I wanted something regimented and strict that I didn\u2019t have to think about,\u2019 says Tasha.\n\n\u2018Something that I didn\u2019t have to have control over, just add veg if I wanted and pop it in the microwave.\u2019\n\nBreakfast was usually something like a healthy muesli or porridge, lunch was soup or a tuna or salmon fillet with bulgur wheat, and dinner might be chicken in a low-calorie sauce that Tasha could add veg to, or a pasta dish.\n\n\u2018I really enjoyed the food, so it didn\u2019t seem like a diet.\n\n'It was tasty and good for me, and as well as helping me to lose weight, it got me back on track with healthy eating and appropriate portion sizes.\u2019\n\nIt took just over a year, but Tasha lost almost half her body weight, reaching 10 stone, a healthy weight for her frame.\n\nShe\u2019d also gone from a size 22 to a size 10.\n\nExciting news\n\nLosing weight meant Tasha and Ross could finally start IVF.\n\nIt was gruelling, but all her hard work wasn\u2019t for nothing.\n\nAfter their first cycle of treatment, the day had finally arrived to find out if it had worked.\n\n\u2018We\u2019d been told to do the test on a specific date and this was it.\n\n'I really needed to go for a wee, so I woke my husband and told him I was going to do it.\n\n\u2018We waited together, looking at the stick for the result to come up in the little window.\n\n'Finding out I was pregnant was overwhelming and amazing \u2013 I was over the moon.\n\n'We just hugged each other, it was really emotional.\n\n\u2018Losing weight was good \u2013 I felt good.\n\n'But the best reward of all was to fall pregnant.\n\n'I couldn\u2019t believe it at first.\u2019\n\nFamily first\n\nBaby Arabelle was born on 3 December 2015 and was an energetic bundle of joy.\n\n\u2018She\u2019s beautiful and so lively and active \u2013 she really keeps me on my toes,\u2019 says Tasha.\n\n\u2018She has made motherhood everything I wanted and thought it would be.\n\n'It\u2019s just absolutely wonderful.\u2019\n\nBut neither Tasha nor Ross wanted her to be an only child.\n\n\u2018I had a great childhood growing up with my siblings,\u2019 says Tasha, \u2018so I wanted that for Arabelle.\n\n'We decided to use one of the frozen embryos left from treatment.\n\n'And it worked again.\u2019\n\nNow Arabelle is three years old, and Tasha is pregnant with her second child, due in November.\n\nTasha says, \u2018I\u2019m finally going to have the family I always wanted, which, if I\u2019m honest, I was frightened I\u2019d never have.\n\n\u2018To have one child was amazing \u2013 but to have two children will make us complete and fulfil my dreams.\n\n'I am so happy.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s hard to believe, having thought I might never get pregnant, that our little girl is going to have a brother or sister.\n\n\u2018I think this will be it, but who knows?!\n\n'What I do know is that having this family means the world to me.\n\n'The most important thing in life is to be happy \u2013 and I am, and I\u2019ll do everything to make sure my children are just as happy too.\n\n\u2018Losing weight has helped me achieve my dreams, and that means every ounce, every pound, every stone was worth it.\n\n'A family is worth its weight in gold.\n\n\u2018All I had ever dreamed of was having a family and being a mum, so Arabelle means everything to me and Ross, just like our other child will when he or she comes along.\n\n\u2018In losing weight I have gained so much \u2013 I have gained everything I ever wanted.\u2019", "description": "Tasha Frampton, 36, from Farnborough, was told she needed to dramatically lose weight, or lose her dream of getting pregnant", "authors": ["Janet Tansley"],
