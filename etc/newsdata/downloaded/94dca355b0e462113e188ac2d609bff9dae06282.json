Levine delivers a poignant performance as he reminisces about loved ones lost.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s to the ones that we got / Cheers to the wish you were here, but you\u2019re not / \u2018Cause the drinks bring back all the memories / Of everything we\u2019ve been through,\u201d he sings.\n\n\u201cMemories\u201d is directed by David Dobkin, who also directed Maroon 5\u2019s videos for \u201cSugar\u201d and \u201cGirls Like You.\u201d Levine said Monday on The Ellen DeGeneres Show that the song is dedicated to his late friend and manager, Jordan Feldstein.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a heavy song. This incredible guy came to me with this song \u2014 it was unfinished, but it was definitely about what it was going to be about already, which is loss and experiencing and suffering loss,\u201d the star said.\n\n\u201cI had just gone through losing my manager and my best friend,\u201d he added. \u201cThis song came to me at a very interesting time. I filled in the holes with the proper words that I thought would match the experience of what I had been going through.\u201d\n\nFeldstein, the brother of actors Jonah Hill and Beanie Feldstein, died at age 40 in December 2017.\n\n\u201cI miss him every day, and this is, to me, the best possible way to tribute him,\u201d Levine said.\n\nMaroon 5 released \u201cMemories\u201d in September. The song is the group\u2019s first new original music since the album Red Pill Blues, released in November 2017.", "description": "Oct. 8 (UPI) \u2014 Maroon 5 is back with a new music video.
