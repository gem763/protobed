But he said overall the food industry was \"largely asleep at the wheel - it is time for a wake-up call\".\n\nHe added: \"If industry fails to act for child health, then we look forward to the introduction of mandatory sugar reduction targets in 2020.\"\n\nThe Food and Drink Federation said the industry was committed to cutting sugar.\n\nBut it added: \"Public Health England set hugely aspirational targets and these could never be met across all categories in the ambitious time frame given.\"\n\nCould the sugar tax be extended?\n\nThere are no current plans. However, the idea has been raised.\n\nEngland's top doctor, Prof Dame Sally Davies, has previously accused the food industry of \"failing the public\".\n\nIn May this year she said: \"I want parents to be incentivised to buy healthy food.\n\n\"We need to make sure that fresh fruit and vegetables are cheap.\n\n\"Maybe we have to subsidise them by charging more, by taxing unhealthy food.\"\n\nFollow James on Twitter.", "description": "Soft drinks have 29% less sugar on average since a levy was imposed, but we're eating more sugary food.", "authors": ["James Gallagher", "Health", "Science Correspondent", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/F17A/production/_108881816_gettyimages-1173151357.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
