I remember my mother\u2019s tears as she sat glued to the TV, watching what looked like an earthquake. Cars buried in rubble, streets ripped open, dozens of photographers and police officers on the scene of what in my mind could only have been a natural disaster.\n\nI quickly realised that wasn\u2019t the case \u2013 that a terrible murder had been committed. The white Fiat Croma buried in the dirt was carrying Cosa Nostra\u2019s number one enemy, the anti-mafia magistrate Giovanni Falcone. Mafia bosses had placed 300kg of explosives under the motorway between the airport and Palermo. As the convoy of cars surrounding the Fiat got closer, the bomb was detonated, killing Falcone, his wife and three members of his police escort.\n\nLess than two months later, the same fate struck Falcone\u2019s colleague Paolo Borsellino, killed in a car bomb attack with five members of his escort outside his mother\u2019s apartment building in Palermo.\n\nFollowing the killings, the bosses from Corleone ordered champagne to toast the judges\u2019 murders. Five days later, the government dispatched 5,000 military personnel to contain what by that point had become an all-out war against the Italian state. I was 10 at the time, and for the next four years I played football in streets surrounded by soldiers carrying machine guns. It was a show of force unknown to Italy since the end of the second world war. \u201cPalermo like Beirut\u201d was the headline splashed across the front pages of Italy\u2019s leading newspaper. Sicily was on its knees, and I felt as though it was the beginning of a catastrophe. On the contrary, the bloody summer of 1992 marked the beginning of the end of the world\u2019s most powerful criminal organisation.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The scene on the highway near Palermo, Sicily, after a bomb killed anti-mafia judge Giovanni Falcone, his wife and three bodyguards in 1992.

On the windows of dozens of storefronts and restaurants in Via Maqueda, the lively street that runs through the city\u2019s historic centre, is the \u201cAddiopizzo\u201d (Goodbye extortion) sticker, which is a pledge that the business owners have refused to pay protection money to mafia bosses. It\u2019s just one of the many signs that today Cosa Nostra is the one on its knees.\n\nThe effective demise of the Cosa Nostra empire was declared last week by one of the most prominent figures in the Italian judiciary, the former chief prosecutor of Rome, Giuseppe Pignatone.\n\nFBI and Italian police arrest 19 people in Sicily and US in mafia investigation Read more\n\nIn a rare interview on TV with La7, Pignatone, who recently retired after working for the main Italian prosecution offices in the south of Italy, said: \u201cToday the Sicilian mafia is way less dangerous than before. Today we can say that the mafia \u2013 the one capable of killing magistrates and attacking the state \u2013 has been defeated.\u201d\n\nHe is not alone in his assessment. According to numerous experts, the organisation that crafted its own mythology \u2013 inspiring films, books and television series \u2013 has never been weaker. Decimated by relentless arrests, weighed down by the recent economic crisis, short on cash and on foot soldiers, Cosa Nostra has become a paper tiger.\n\nDead? No, because it\u2019s still embedded in Sicilian society; but transformed, yes: reduced, according to many, to the level of a neighbourhood gang.\n\n\u201cIt is very probable that today\u2019s mafia is the weakest in its history,\u201d says Salvatore Lupo, a professor of contemporary history at Palermo University and a renowned expert in the history of Italy\u2019s Cosa Nostra. \u201cThe Italian state has obtained unprecedented results. Judicial pressure and the crisis it has caused in recent years is something that mafia bosses have never experienced in the organisation\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The No Mafia memorial museum in Palermo.

Photograph: Alessio Mamo/Observer\n\nSince Falcone and Borsellino\u2019s deaths, the police have arrested more than 4,000 mafiosi, including 361 in 2011 and 300 in 2014. One of the most important arrests following the magistrates\u2019 deaths was that of Tot\u00f2 \u201cthe beast\u201d Riina, one of the most ruthless bosses in the history of Cosa Nostra.\n\nRiina, who ordered the magistrates\u2019 killings and another 150 murders, was arrested in 1993 and sentenced to life in prison. In November 2017, he died in jail while in a medically-induced coma following cancer treatment.\n\n\u201cRiina formally remained the boss of the Sicilian mafia until the day he died,\u201d says Sergio Lari, former anti-mafia prosecutor who for more than 10 years was head of the Palermo anti-mafia directorate and lead investigator in the Falcone and Borsellino killings. \u201cIt\u2019s clear, however, that in recent years it was difficult for him to manage the organisation\u2019s business interests, given his poor health and the fact that he was isolated in prison.\u201d\n\nThe truth is that no one had enough authority to take his place. Today, the most respected bosses are all in jail or have died there. They have been replaced by younger criminals who don\u2019t seem to have the same authority as their predecessors. Rosalba Di Gregorio, one of Palermo\u2019s leading lawyers, defended the superboss and right-hand man of Riina, Bernardo \u201cthe tractor\u201d Provenzano. She describes the mafia as in disarray, with \u201cnew bosses who are not really bosses at all. They are men who, once they\u2019ve served their prison time and are back on the streets, put on airs as godfathers. They think they\u2019re bosses. The truth is that this is no longer Cosa Nostra.\u201d\n\nGiovanni Falcone\u2019s sister, Maria, says: \u201cIn comparison to yesterday\u2019s bosses, who waged war against the Italian state, the new generation are chicken thieves.\u201d\n\nSome believe that the only true godfather capable of taking the reins of the Sicilian mafia is Matteo Messina Denaro, one of the world\u2019s most wanted fugitives, who has been in hiding since 1993. But experts, and many mafiosi, disagree.\n\n\u201cAside from being a dangerous criminal, the idea that Denaro could be the new super-godfather is just media rhetoric,\u201d says Lupo, co-author of the book La mafia non ha vinto (The Mafia Hasn\u2019t Won) with Giovanni Fiandaca. \u201cWe are persuaded to believe that his capture represents that ultimate defeat of Cosa Nostra, but Messina Denaro doesn\u2019t even enjoy legitimacy among many Sicilian bosses.\u201d\n\n\u201cMessina Denaro is the last Mohican of the old mafia,\u201d says Lari. \u201cHe may be the boss of the entire province of Trapani, but he certainly isn\u2019t the boss of bosses of Cosa Nostra. Internal dynamics aside, he could never be the superboss for one reason: Matteo Denaro is not from Palermo, and that role is normally held by men from Palermo.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Maria Falcone, sister of the judge Giovanni Falcone, during a commemoration of the 25th anniversary of the murder of her brother. Photograph: Alessio Mamo\n\nTechnological advances in the fight against the mafia have played a crucial role. First and foremost is the use of wiretaps and hidden cameras. Bugs placed in bosses\u2019 homes and hidden cameras in mafia hangouts have shed light on the new mobsters\u2019 activities. They have led to compelling evidence in court, with bosses often receiving long sentences in maximum-security prisons.\n\nFollowing the deaths of Falcone and Borsellino, the notoriously harsh prison regime, first introduced in 1975, was intensified, aiming at cutting off mafia inmates completely from their former criminal associates. The new regime banned the use of telephones, any association or correspondence with other prisoners, or meetings with third parties. In order to avoid living a completely isolated life, many mafiosi decide to turn state\u2019s witness.\n\nIn Italy they are called pentiti, literally \u201crepentant\u201d. They are mafiosi who, in exchange for lighter sentences, have testified in court against their former associates, thereby contributing to additional arrests and the further weakening of Cosa Nostra. Today, more than 300 former mobsters are collaborating with authorities in Sicily.\n\nThe economic crisis, which has hit Italy hard, has also affected the mafia. One of the mafia\u2019s most profitable earners has traditionally been the construction sector, in which companies with ties to mafia bosses would earn millions by skimming contracts for bridges, roads and buildings. In the mafia\u2019s golden years of the 1970s, in Palermo alone mafia-controlled construction activity was worth more than \u00a31bn.\n\nToday the building sector in Sicily is at one of its lowest points: 73,216 people were made redundant between 2008 and 2017, and more than 5,000 businesses have closed, according to Italy\u2019s largest trade union federation. Many mafia families have been forced to decrease the amount of protection money asked of business owners. Investigations in Palermo have even brought to light the technique of paying on an instalment plan, a strategy that, nonetheless, has resulted in arrests following reports from rebellious shopkeepers who are now less fearful of a weakened mafia and more confident that the law will be successfully enforced.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A stall selling Godfather themed t-shirts in Palermo. Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The Observer\n\nIn wiretaps, bosses have complained of the economic crisis and have admitted the organisation\u2019s increased weakness.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of bloody mafia are we?\u201d asked Alfredo Giordano, a former mafioso from Palermo caught on wiretap. \u201cThe mafia of lost causes.\u201d He wasn\u2019t even able to recover objects that were stolen from his daughter.\n\nThe mafiosi who speak today used to drive Mercedes down the streets of Palermo in the 1980s. Men who held in their hands the life or death of police officers and journalists have lost their power to intimidate.\n\nThe wife of mafia boss Salvatore Spica, in a wiretap, complained to her husband: \u201cI used \u20ac100 for my mother\u2019s groceries, \u20ac200 for the dentist. What\u2019s left? All I have left is spare change.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we had to draw a graph of the military and economic power of Cosa Nostra in the last 100 years,\u201d says Lari, \u201cthe highest point on the curve would be the mid-1980s. From the 1990s on, with peaks and troughs, the general trend would be a decrease, up to today, where we\u2019d find the lowest levels.\u201d\n\nLari believes that one of the most telling examples of the mafia\u2019s current state of crisis is the drugs trade, \u201cwhere we\u2019ve seen an absolute monopoly on the part of Cosa Nostra transform into bilateral and subordinate agreements, often with the powerful Calabrian \u2019Ndrangheta\u201d.\n\nIn the 1970s, the mafia not only trafficked drugs, it also produced them. Morphine was often purchased in Switzerland and transported to Palermo, where it was processed in hundreds of refineries hidden in the countryside. At the time, 30% of the heroin in the US was produced in Sicily.\n\nToday, the tonnes of cocaine on the streets of Palermo and Catania, as recent investigations have revealed, are moved by the Calabrian \u2019Ndrangheta. Once snubbed by the Sicilian bosses, today their Calabrian counterparts forge ties with Colombian narcos, control ports, and sell their goods to the Sicilians, who have been demoted to the status of \u201ccustomers\u201d.\n\nBetween 1978 and 1983, the Sicilian mafia killed more than 1,000 people. Hundreds died in the early 80s. Since the mid-1990s, the number of homicides has decreased significantly. The last five years in Palermo have seen only one homicide attributable to Cosa Nostra.\n\nIt was 22 May 2017 when two hitmen killed the boss Giuseppe Dainotti, who every morning around 7.50am would ride his bike to the grocery. He took one bullet to the head and a second to the body. The residents in the Noce quarter of Palermo couldn\u2019t make sense of what had happened, as Dainotti\u2019s body lay in a pool of blood for 10 minutes. People had become so unaccustomed to hearing gunshots that they mistook the sounds for fireworks.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Students of the Istituto Nautico Gioeni \u2013 Trabia in front at the mural of judges Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, killed by the mafia.

Hundreds of visitors stop, in both directions, to leave flowers and pray. They do the same in front of the memorial placard on Via D\u2019Amelio where Borsellino was murdered.\n\nGigantic masterpieces of street art on the buildings of Palermo, depicting mafia victims, have taken the place of pro-mafia slogans. The city\u2019s scars have become monuments and an indelible reminder that in the war between good and evil, good has gained the upper hand.\n\n\u201cThe battle isn\u2019t over,\u201d says Maria Falcone. \u201cMy brother Giovanni said that the mafia is a human phenomenon, and like all human phenomena, it had a beginning and it will have an end. Well, despite the current crisis of Cosa Nostra, that end has not yet arrived.\u201d\n\nMaybe the end hasn\u2019t come yet. But at least the mafia bosses who used to drive fancy cars, buy lavish villas and feel arrogant enough to take on the Italian state, like the boss Dainotti, now move and die on a bicycle.", "description": "As the Cosa Nostra is finally brought to its knees, our reporter recalls his childhood in Palermo when the mob families felt free to murder at will", "authors": ["Lorenzo Tondo"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8830fe970c75004d4f553b8dca0de3686472ca57/2_216_1983_1189/master/1983.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=341fbeee7b7fdd04557eca8515b3858e", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
