His lesson on selfies is eternal.", "language": "en", "text": "It has been 350 years since Rembrandt van Rijn died penniless in Amsterdam on October 4, 1669, but there\u2019s much modern Americans can learn from the deceased Dutch master through the works he left behind.\n\nRembrandt was known for the 17th century equivalent of the selfie: He created an unusual number of self-portraits \u2014 close to 100 throughout his life \u2014 but there is a stubborn honesty to these works that far remove him from some heavily doctored posts in 2019.\n\nThe average millennial will snap a lifetime total of more than 25,000 selfies. But unlike Rembrandt, in our highly filtered Instagram culture, we rarely seek to show ourselves as we are; we project ourselves as we wish to be seen. Social media encourages the facade by linking the natural human desire for validation to the viral power of the internet. Toss in the near-universal fear of rejection, the other side of the validation coin, and we see a race away from reality.\n\nRembrandt did the opposite. In doing so, his honest self-portraits become models of courage, showing us how to engage life as it really is, as opposed to a filtered, ultimately fake existence built by fear.\n\nGaze upon the range of Rembrandt self-portraits and you\u2019ll see a man ageing as close to real-time as you get for the 1600s. The impish eyes, unruly hair and confident look of \u201cSelf Portrait as a Young Man\u201d were painted when Rembrandt was 23. While his use of chiaroscuro conceals his eyes, there is nevertheless great vulnerability in faithfully presenting one\u2019s own face.\n\nForty years later, he has become the weary-eyed, grey old man of \u201cSelf Portrait with Two Circles.\u201d He\u2019s fatter. There are lines on his face. The chiaroscuro is still there, but there is nevertheless no filter.\n\nIt\u2019s not that there weren\u2019t any materialistic reasons driving Rembrandt\u2019s art. He had a strong financial incentive to sell his portraits, especially later in life. He married into wealth but lived beyond his means, especially when it came to real estate. After his wife\u2019s death, his reputation among Amsterdam elites plummeted when his affairs became known. It cost him commissions.\n\nThe portraits also had some creative utility; he used them as studies for other, larger works. But it\u2019s hard to conclude he produced them all for \u201cthe love of the gram,\u201d in the way we do so frantically today. If that were so, Rembrandt\u2019s later self-portraits might appear gentler, less haggard.\n\nThey don\u2019t. The youthful energy of Rembrandt the young man has yielded to one weighed down by life, loss of loved ones to illness, loss of reputation and housing to poor decisions.\n\nFor Americans in 2019, the lesson seems to be, \u201cThis is real life.\u201d\n\nAnd we might add another lesson: You cannot be at peace with others until you make peace with yourself, with reality.\n\nRembrandt\u2019s \u201cThe Return of the Prodigal Son\u201d captures this truth. We see the wayward son of Jesus\u2019 parable on his knees, face buried in his father\u2019s robes. The boy has just returned from squandering his inheritance in a faraway land. Realizing his sin and starving for both food and love, he comes home to his father, who has been lovingly waiting for him ever since he left.\n\nThe son\u2019s grief and shame, more readily identifiable emotions, would be easier to capture than the sublime blend of relief, joy and love in the face of the boy\u2019s father. But Rembrandt, at the height of his artistic powers, shows us the father.\n\nThe son\u2019s face stays hidden. And as a result, his becomes the face of all humanity. Your face and mine. Turned away from the viewer, it is the very opposite of the selfie. Ironically, it is the face of one no longer hiding his failings. His honest, hard look at himself, though incredibly painful, has brought him back into relationship with another.\n\nFor Americans weary of division, this is Rembrandt\u2019s great gift. This is the answer to tribalism, relentless self-promotion, the pursuit of validation and the constant foisting of ourselves onto the world for money, attention, respect.\n\nRembrandt himself, beset with debts, likely knew these drives well. But in his painting, he offers a way out, epitomized by the \u201cThe Return of the Prodigal Son.\u201d If such a broken person as the prodigal son can be reconciled, so can we.\n\nHow do we know? Because, at rock bottom, we all have a fundamental shared dignity. Rembrandt showed it by including everyone as subjects in his art. Wealthy patrons. His family. The homeless. In his works, they all have dignity and beauty. Not necessarily by looks; they do not all have high cheekbones or perfectly symmetrical faces. But it\u2019s clear the artist strived, in his own words, to give them \u201cthe greatest and most natural movement.\u201d\n\nWe all have a fundamental shared dignity. Rembrandt showed it by including everyone as subjects in his art. Wealthy patrons. His family. The homeless.\n\nI should confess to having no formal training in art history; my principal experience has been in national security at the Pentagon, working with and among people highly attuned to life\u2019s grimmest realities.\n\nBut Rembrandt matters in this context, too. Perhaps especially so.\n\nBecause if we are all worth painting, we are all worth protecting. And like Rembrandt\u2019s art, those entrusted with the responsibility to protect will need to uphold the dignity of the human person. They will need to engage with the world as it really is, as opposed to a filtered, ultimately fake existence built by fear. And they will need to do these things through deep, strong relationships with one another.", "description": "The Dutch painter's honest self-portraits show us how to engage life as it really is, rather than as a filtered, ultimately fake existence.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/20/81/90/1000x563_cmsv2_2feac368-0191-5a1f-9f41-9a4b4e6054fa-4208190.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
