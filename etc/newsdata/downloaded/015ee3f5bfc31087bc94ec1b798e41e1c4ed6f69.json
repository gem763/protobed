Their best chance saw defender Harry Maguire head wastefully wide from a corner on the stroke of halftime.\n\nThe 20-time English champions will enter the international break in 12th spot, two points above the relegation zone and 15 behind leaders Liverpool who they host in a fortnight. Newcastle are a point behind United in 16th spot.\n\nIt was Steve Bruce\u2019s best day since replacing the popular Rafa Benitez as he claimed a first win as manager over his old club at the 23rd attempt on his 400th match in charge of a Premier League club. However, the day belonged to Longstaff. Relive all the action:\n\nHello and welcome along to live coverage of Newcastle vs Manchester United... Team News Both sides make a number of changes in an attempt to rediscover some form. Newcastle, after last weekend's 5-0 thrashing against Leicester, bring Ciaran Clark, DeAndre Yedlin, Jetro Willems, Matt Longstaff and Allan Saint-Maximin into their starting XI. Manchester United, meanwhile, make six changes from the team that drew with AZ Alkmaar on Thursday night, with Harry Maguire, Axel Tuanzebe, Ashley Young, Andreas Pereira, Scott McTominay and Marcus Rashford all coming into the side. There's a Premier League debut for 19-year-old Matty Longstaff this afternoon. He'll partner his brother Sean in midfield. Advertisement Steve Bruce is optimistic that today's game could be the catalyst for an upturn in fortune at St. James' Park. \u201cYes, they might not be the Manchester United of the past, but they\u2019ve still got some very good players and we\u2019re going to have to be better than we were last week,\" the Newcastle boss said. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful time to play them because it\u2019s a full house live on TV. If you have to bounce back against anybody, what better way than against them? \u201cIt\u2019ll be a big occasion and we have to make sure we\u2019re ready for it. We\u2019ve played badly in a couple of games, but we\u2019re capable. We\u2019re going to have to play well on the day.\" center no-repeat #999999;cursor:pointer;top:-1px; border-radius: 0px 0px 2px 2px;\">\u21b5 Some pre-match reading from Miguel Delaney: Solskjaer\u2019s words of optimism ring hollow Advertisement Wolves' remarkable 2-0 victory at Manchester City means they leapfrog United into 11th in the Premier League standings. Should Solskjaer's side win this afternoon, though, they'll climb to the lofty heights of seventh place. In praise of Newcastle United\u2019s astonishingly loyal supporters A win for Newcastle today would take them out of the bottom three, but their supporters are unlikely to be overly optimistic. They've won just once in seven games this season, and scored a measly four goals. The early signs are not good. Advertisement The players are out at St. James' Park! We're almost ready for kick off. KICK OFF Newcastle get things underway! Newcastle 0-0 Manchester United 1 minute A quick start from the hosts! Allan Saint-Maximin sets off on a driving run through the middle, reaching the edge of the box before playing in Almiron, whose attempted shot is blocked. The move is greeted by a roar of approval from the home fans. Advertisement Newcastle 0-0 Manchester United 2 minutes Almiron glides forward with the ball and goes down having been clipped by Fred. Newcastle have a free kick within shooting range... Newcastle 0-0 Manchester United 4 minutes Schar goes for goal from the free kick but can only slam his effort against the wall. Newcastle 0-0 Manchester United 8 minutes This is not a flowing, high-quality game of football so far. Both sides have been sloppy in possession and there's been very little in the way of creativity. Newcastle 0-0 Manchester United 11 minutes Newcastle started brightly but they appear content to sit back now, staying compact and asking United to break them down. That has been a successful strategy for a number of teams against Solskjaer's side this season.
