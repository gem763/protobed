The One Nation Party leader this week refused to vote with the government on non-critical legislation until it agreed to regulate the dairy industry, which she said was suffering a painful demise since its deregulation in 2000. Senator Hanson called on the government to \u201cget out and do your job for the people in this country because dairy farmers are going under\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve got to take a stand with this because the government\u2019s not doing anything about it, the National Party\u2019s not doing anything and Labor is all talk and no action,\u201d she said.
