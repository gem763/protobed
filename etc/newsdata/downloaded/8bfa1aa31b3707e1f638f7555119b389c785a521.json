Sullivan, which constrains public officials' ability to sue for defamation.\n\n\"In times of social tension, our impulse is often to pull back from free expression because we want the progress that comes in from free expression but we don't want this tension,\" he said. \"In the end, all of these decisions were wrong.\"\n\nAnd Zuckerberg said it would be inappropriate for tech companies to be the arbiters of speech, even when it comes to political ads and statements that contain falsehoods. \"I don't think most people want to live in a world where you can only push things tech companies judge to be 100 percent true,\" he said.\n\nInstead, Facebook will continue to focus its content moderation efforts around taking down only material that \"can cause real danger\" while giving free reign to anything else. Zuckerberg added that he believes a broadly permissive political advertising platform offers the greatest benefits to grassroots campaigns and challengers for public office, helping them get their messages out more easily than they could if they had to navigate more restrictions and red tape.\n\nThe speech comes amid controversy over Facebook's refusal to take down Trump campaign ads that make the false claim that former Vice President Joe Biden got a Ukrainian prosecutor fired to halt an investigation into his son's business dealings in the country. The Biden campaign came away from Zuckerberg's speech unimpressed.\n\n\u201cFacebook has chosen to sell Americans\u2019 personal data to politicians looking to target them with disproven lies and conspiracy theories, crowding out the voices of working Americans,\u201d said Bill Russo, deputy communications director for the Biden campaign.\n\nHe added: \u201cZuckerberg attempted to use the Constitution as a shield for his company\u2019s bottom line, and his choice to cloak Facebook\u2019s policy in a feigned concern for free expression demonstrates how unprepared his company is for this unique moment in our history and how little it has learned over the past few years.\u201d\n\nBoth the setting and the messenger for Thursday's address were key. Being in Washington guarantees the speech grabs the political class' attention, and Georgetown in particular holds significance as a standard-bearer of Jesuit traditions of open inquiry and free expression.\n\nAnd sending the CEO was a recognition that other Facebook envoys to Washington haven't been able to convince many in the capital that the company\u2019s on the right track.\n\nCristiano Lima contributed to this report.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/60/7f/edbedac744eca1a6d1f76650f7b6/191017-zuckerberg-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
