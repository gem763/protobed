But we still lived together and still filled the family car,' Paulina wrote. 'Everyone who knew Ric knew that he could be aloof. And not particularly social. But when he decided to turn his focus on you, it was as if the sun came out.\n\n'His smile and his gaze warmed you and made you feel like the most special person in the world. I had that gaze and smile on me for most of my life.'\n\nPaulina married Ric in August 1989, after meeting the singer on set while The Cars were filming the music video for Drive in 1984.\n\n'For a long long time, no one could make me feels [sic] as loved as Ric. He was my sun,' she recalled. 'With this, I don\u2019t mean my sunshine, no, Ric could be pretty gloomy.\n\n'In fact, when we first met, he reveled in his nickname \"the Master of Doom\". But in my universe, it was where he rose and where he set that was the point to which I oriented myself,' she explained.\n\n'Like a plant, I tilted my head to catch his rays. Our separation didn\u2019t alter this one bit. He was rising and setting and I planned my life around it as one does a day: depending on the position of the sun in the sky: you\u2019ll have breakfast or go to work or dinner with your friends.\n\n'His death is the end of my world as I knew it.'\n\nStory: Paulina met Ric (pictured in 1990) when The Cars were filming the music video for Drive in 1984, and they wed five years later. They were still married at the time of his death\n\nMemories: 'His smile and his gaze warmed you and made you feel like the most special person in the world,' Paulina wrote of The Cars frontman\n\nPaulina, who shares sons Oliver, 21 and Jonathan, 25, with the 75-year-old singer, found him dead in their Manhattan townhouse on September 15.\n\nA New York City medical examiner determined last month that he died from hypertensive and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with pulmonary emphysema being a contributing factor.\n\nRic had undergone surgery two weeks before, but while speaking with Rolling Stone last week, Paulina stressed it was 'not at all related' to his death.\n\n'I don\u2019t know how much I want to say about the surgery, but it was successful. He was recuperating really well,' she said. 'So his passing was a f*****g shock.'\n\nThe Sports Illustrated star told the publication that she brought Ric cookies the night before he died.\n\n'When I got there, he was sitting in his usual chair and I said, \"I got some gooey cookies,\" and he said, \"OK, thanks, hon \u2014 I had some terrible cookies because I was in the mood for cookies, but I\u2019ll have your gooey cookies tomorrow. I think I\u2019m going to bed early since I\u2018m feeling a little sore,\"' she recalled.\n\n'And that was the last time I saw him alive.'\n\nPaulina said she thought he was asleep when she came back and checked on him the next morning.\n\nMourning: Paulina, who found Ric dead in their Manhattan townhouse, shared a family statement on Instagram on September 16\n\nTouched: The supermodel shared images of the flowers and toy cars left by fans, writing, 'Thank you,' alongside the image\n\n'I did some chores and then it was 11, and I thought, \"This is weird, there\u2019s something not right about this,\"' she said. 'I poured the coffee and came upstairs to give it to him and he was in the exact same position; he hadn\u2019t even moved a little bit. And at that point, I knew, but I couldn\u2019t believe it.\n\n'I walked up to him and he still looked asleep. Except he was really, really still and his eyes were a little bit open. I thought he was waking up, actually. I was about to wave my hand in front of his face and go, \u201cHey, I brought you coffee.\u201d But I touched his cheek and it was like touching marble. That was pretty f*****g awful.'\n\nPaulina said she waited to call 911 because Ric's manager had warned her that she and her family would be hounded by the press once the news broke.\n\nThe musician has six sons in total, two from each of his three marriages\n\n'I wanted Ric\u2019s sons to get here so we could all say goodbye to him,' she explained. 'So we waited, and we got to circle the bed and hold hands and really say goodbye. We were here with his shape for many hours after his death.\n\nIt was kind of wonderful because we all understood he was gone. He definitely left us. But the minute I called 911, literally two minutes [after], there were paparazzi at our house,' she noted. 'That\u2019s just disgusting.'\n\nThe day after Ric's death, Paulina released a family statement on Instagram.\n\nLong marriage: Paulina and Ric (pictured in 2018) were together for 28 years before she announced their separation last year\n\nCandid post: Paulina shared this message on Instagram in regards to their split\n\n'Ric was at home recuperating very well after surgery. Our two sons, Jonathan and Oliver, and I were making sure he was comfortable, ordering food and watching TV together,' she wrote.\n\n'I found him still sleeping when bringing him his Sunday morning coffee. I touched his cheek to rouse him. It was then I realized that during the night he had peacefully passed on.\n\n'We appreciate the great outpouring of love. We, his family and friends, are completely and utterly devastated by his untimely and unexpected death and would appreciate the privacy to mourn in private.'\n\nShe also posted an image of the flowers and toy cars that were left by Ric's fan, writing: 'Thank you.'\n\nPaulina and Ric were together for 28 years before she announced their separation.\n\n'Our family always has been \u2014 and still is \u2014 a well-built car. When the four of us are together, we can go wherever the road takes us,' she wrote on Instagram at the time.\n\n'But as a bicycle, my husband and I no longer pedal in unison. So we're ditching the bike. The love we have for one another is so wide and deep it's practically tangible, and that sort of love can never disappear.'\n\nThe pair put their $15 million townhouse on the market in January. It's the same townhouse where he was found.", "description": "The supermodel took to Instagram on Thursday to share a black and white photo of herself with her estranged husband, who died on September 15 at age 75.", "authors": ["Erica Tempesta For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/22/19560510-0-image-a-66_1570743105307.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
