It is allowed to trade within a narrow band of 2% above or below the day's midpoint rate, and if it deviates too far, the Chinese central bank steps in to put a lid on volatility.\n\nThe yuan weakened past a psychologically important level of 7 per dollar in August, which led analysts to believe that China could let its currency weaken to help offset the impact of higher duties on Chinese exports to the U.S.\n\nA weak currency makes a country's exports cheaper on international markets, and therefore more attractive.", "description": "China maintains strict control of its currency's exchange rate for the onshore yuan, which is traded on the mainland.
