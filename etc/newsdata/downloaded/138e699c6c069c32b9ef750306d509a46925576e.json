But she admitted it has its challenges when raising young boys.\n\nLow key: The Avatar actress, 41, looked relaxed in a casual grey sweater and matching sweat pants after leaving a local branch of Whole Foods\n\n'I'm always gonna be honest and that is always the best way to welcome healthy and truthful discourse, especially around parenthood. \u2026 [The twins] made a comment two weeks ago like, \"Boys are stronger than girls,\" because they're in that stage of comparisons,' she told the publication.\n\nZo\u00eb confessed the goal to inform her children about breaking down gender norms, such as avoiding ideas like boys being stronger than girls, was to embrace them being a 'blank slate'.\n\n'[To] not bring all this charge that you have as an adult and as a woman into their lives,' she said. 'They're a blank slate.'\n\nHappy family: The actress and husband Marco Perego are parents to three boys; twins Bowie Ezio and Cy Aridio, four, and Zen, two\n\nZo\u00eb first opened up about her gender-neutral household and why it was a priority for the family in 2018.\n\n'We have a very gender-neutral environment where my husband participates in a lot of tasks that were normally given to women and vice versa,' she told US Weekly.\n\nTheir relationship is different from others as it was decided for Marco to take Zo\u00eb's last name and for her to take his last name when they got married in 2013. So she technically is Zo\u00eb Saldana Perego to his Perego Saldana.\n\nUnconventional: Zo\u00eb recently admitted to raising her three children within a gender-neutral household in order to discourage them from buying into gender stereotypes\n\n'I get to do a lot of male things, which is, I don't know, put the TV together, fix things that break,' Zo\u00eb continued. 'We're sort of a very gender-fluid household. I think it's important to raise boys in that environment, and girls as well.'\n\nMarco has also been praised by Zo\u00eb because of their commitment to making women as equal as men in their household.\n\n'I have the most perfect partner in my life,' she told Women's Health. 'I've never met a male like my husband, who [believes] any woman is naturally his equal.'\n\nIdeal man: Marco has also been praised by Zo\u00eb because of their commitment to making women as equal as men in their household\n\nThat belief is driven home with their children when it comes to disciplining them.\n\n'That \"Mom's the boss\" thing is not going to happen in our family, because that means he's [husband Marco Perego] the fun one, the good guy, while I'm the disciplinarian,' she said.\n\n'I don't want my kids to look at women like, \"Oh, god, they're so annoying! They always come with structure\".'", "description": "The Avatar actress, 41, looked relaxed in a casual grey sweater and matching sweat pants after leaving a local branch of Whole Foods.", "authors": ["Jason Chester For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/09/19434336-0-image-a-9_1570524901573.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
