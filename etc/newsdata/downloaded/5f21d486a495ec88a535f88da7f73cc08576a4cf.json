But the bottom line is, we are concerned that their plans are taking longer and costing significantly more than they originally thought,\u201d Diana Maurer, director of the GAO\u2019s Defense Capabilities and Management team, told The Washington Times.\n\nThe new cemeteries include urban and rural locations and have been proposed for California, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Montana, Nevada, New York, North Dakota, Utah, Wisconsin, Wyoming. As of late last month, new cemeteries had been completed in only two locations \u2014 Laurel, Montana, and Fargo, North Dakota.\n\nThe GAO report comes after the Army last month announced new rules to restrict who can be buried at Arlington National Cemetery, which is running out of space for gravesites.\n\nUnder current Army regulations, nearly all of the nation\u2019s 22 million living service members and veterans are eligible for burial at the cemetery. The new rules would limit in-ground burials only for presidents and vice presidents, those killed in action and certain decorated veterans. Veterans who retired from active duty will be able to have their cremated remains kept in above-ground urns.\n\nThe proposed restrictions are expected to keep the cemetery, which has an average of 25 burials a day, functional for another 150 years.\n\nThe Army manages Arlington National Cemetery, while the Department of Veterans Affairs is responsible for 137 cemeteries in 40 states.\n\nThe VA\u2019s program to build additional burial grounds stemmed from a study it undertook earlier this decade that found \u201capproximately 10 percent of the veterans in the United States, or over 2.1 million veterans, did not have reasonable access to burial options in a veterans cemetery.\u201d\n\nOfficials then defined reasonable access to a cemetery within 75 miles of a veteran\u2019s residence, with a goal of building up to 18 graveyards to meet that standard. The project was intended to conclude in 2017, Ms. Maurer said.\n\nAccording to the GAO, cost estimates for those cemeteries have increased by more than 200%, from about $7 million to $24 million.\n\nNational Cemetery Administration officials admitted they \u201cmight have overstated\u201d their goals for completing the project by 2017, the GAO said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
