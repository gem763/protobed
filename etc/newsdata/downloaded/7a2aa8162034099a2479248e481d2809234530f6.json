We all make mistakes every single day of our lives, [but] it\u2019s what makes you a good entrepreneur and an interesting person,\" she shared.", "description": "", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/gwyneth-paltrow-rt-jt-190927_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
