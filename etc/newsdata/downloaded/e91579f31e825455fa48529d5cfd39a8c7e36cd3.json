Barr did not learn of the call until several weeks after it took place, and has not communicated with Ukraine, according to the Justice Department. But as the nation's top law enforcement official, Barr has taken several actions that have benefited Trump and caused Democrats to question his independence. He decided in March not to prosecute Trump for obstruction of justice for interfering with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian attempts to influence the 2016 election. When he released Mueller's report in April, Barr echoed Trump's refrain that the special counsel had found \"no collusion\" between his campaign and Russia. Mueller in fact had concluded that there was not enough evidence to bring criminal conspiracy charges, but outlined numerous examples where campaign officials welcomed Russian interference in the election.
