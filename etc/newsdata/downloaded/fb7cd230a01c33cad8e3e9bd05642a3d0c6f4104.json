Max Rose, a New York Democrat and one of his party\u2019s last opponents of impeachment, endorsed an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump during a town hall in Staten Island on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cNow I have opposed a rush to judgment to date because the American people deserve to know that when this country is in crisis, we\u2019re going to react responsibly and deliberately, especially when it involves impeachment,\u201d he told an audience of more than 100 at the Jewish Community Center of Staten Island. \"But instead of allaying our concerns, the president and his administration have poured gasoline on the fire.\n\n\u201cThe American people have a right to know if their president used the power of his or her office to get a foreign power to interfere in our elections,\u201d he added. \u2033We have got to follow these facts where they lead us. And where we find ourselves today, the president has no one to blame but himself.\u201d\n\nRose, 32, who unseated Republican Rep. Dan Donovan in November, is exactly the kind of Democrat that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California had sought to shield from the potential political fallout of the impeachment process. In 2016, Trump defeated Hillary Clinton among voters in Rose\u2019s district, which also includes a sliver of southwest Brooklyn, by nearly 10 percentage points.\n\nNow the number of House Democrats who haven\u2019t come out in favor of the impeachment inquiry is down to 10. The attendees at Wednesday\u2019s town hall were largely supportive of Rose\u2019s announcement, applauding after he made it.\n\nBill Clark/Getty Images Rep. Max Rose (D-N.Y.) said Wednesday that he supports an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.\n\nOne man interrupted Rose during his remarks to ask whether he had supported Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence officer who created a dossier on Trump during the 2016 presidential race.\n\nRose and his staff told the man to sit down and suggested that he would get a chance to ask his question.\n\n\u201cSir, I promise you that there\u2019s not a question in this room that I will ignore. I promise you,\u201d he said. (In the end, Rose completed the town hall after more than an hour without getting to the man\u2019s question.)\n\nOverall, Rose appeared to face more pressure in the room from activists to his left. Joe Schwartz, who identified himself as a retired union member and activist in a question submitted in writing, wrote that he would gladly give up his union-bargained insurance for the chance to enact a \u201cMedicare for All\u201d single-payer health care system. Schwartz asked whether Rose would support the single-payer bill in the House.\n\nMedicare for All is \u201cbetter than that union\u2019s health insurance, including my union,\u201d Schwartz wrote.\n\nRose, who previously worked as an administrator at a New York City-based health care provider, stuck to his opposition to Medicare for All. Instead, he reiterated his support for, among other things, increasing subsidies for people who buy insurance on the Affordable Care Act exchanges, lowering the Medicare eligibility age to 55 and allowing all Americans access to a public health insurance option.\n\n\u201cOur disagreement is centered around policy, not values. I will not rest until we have true universal health care in the United States of America,\u201d he said, prompting applause from the audience.\n\nThey already tried, and we kicked their ass. And guess what: That\u2019s exactly what is going to happen again. Rep. Max Rose (D-N.Y.)\n\nMiriam Arnold, a retired city employee and union member, said she was pleased that Rose had come around on impeachment.\n\nBut Arnold said, \u201cHe\u2019s got a long way to go yet on Medicare expansion, and possibly a single-payer system.\u201d\n\nMark Birmingham, a union ironworker who arrived with a group of fellow workers to raise awareness about a dispute with a rival construction union, did not fault Rose for taking his time before supporting impeachment.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a man. He can make his own decisions,\u201d Birmingham said. \u201cNo one should rush him.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to reporters after the event, Rose denied that his decision to back impeachment was motivated by the news that Rose has a progressive primary challenger, Richard-Olivier Marius. Marius, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America who volunteered for Rose in the 2018 cycle and attended Wednesday\u2019s town hall, is disappointed in Rose\u2019s refusal to support Medicare for All and other progressive policies.\n\nRather, Rose said, it was various Trump administration officials\u2019 indications in recent days that they would not cooperate with an investigation into Trump\u2019s alleged solicitation of political help from Ukraine that convinced him \u201cthat this has got to be escalated\u201d to an impeachment inquiry.\n\nRose also dismissed the prospect that his support for impeachment would endanger his reelection in the Republican-leaning district.\n\n\u201cThey already tried once and we kicked their ass,\u201d he boasted, referring to his 2018 victory. \u201cAnd guess what: That\u2019s exactly what is going to happen again. They have been absolute jokes.\u201d\n\nRose nonetheless took pains throughout the town hall, which focused mostly on improving transportation infrastructure, easing commute times and addressing the opioid crisis, to distinguish himself from more liberal Democrats in Congress.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand, we have Democrats who, before they have sworn the oath of office, want to impeach the president of the United States,\u201d he said, making what appeared to be a veiled reference to comments by Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan. \u201cOn the other side, though, we have Republicans who swore the same oath that I did but suddenly they become deaf, mute and blind whenever allegations against the president come up. That\u2019s an even greater threat to our democracy.\u201d", "description": "Rose, who unseated a Republican congressman in a district Donald Trump won, was one of his party's last holdouts.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9538c72200005200dc7a3e.jpeg?cache=mrrbzxba5a&ops=1778_1000"}
