Photo Mathieu Bitton/Netflix.\n\nWatching Dave Chappelle\u2019s latter-day comedy specials\u2014the most recent of which was released on Monday\u2014is like dropping in on a rascally uncle who doesn\u2019t know, or doesn\u2019t care, how much he\u2019s disappointing you. Maybe he was a favored relative once, the kind of eyebrow-wagging scamp who made the other grown-ups uncomfortable just to entertain you but also gave you peeks into adult complexity that few others would. He was more clever than anyone you\u2019d met up until that point, and there was something impressive about the lengths he\u2019d go to make you laugh. Then he went away for a long time, and while you changed with the times, he fashioned himself a badge of honor for defiantly not doing so. Now, his jokes make you wince. The soundness of their logic is as intact as ever, but they\u2019re seldom informed by facts or new perspectives. Each visit reminds you that your face is technically capable of laughing and cringing at the same time\u2014but it certainly doesn\u2019t feel good to do so. Despite it all, Uncle Dave insists it\u2019s not that his viewpoints have gotten stale: Everyone\u2019s just gotten so much more sensitive.\n\nIn his fifth Netflix special, titled Sticks & Stones, Chappelle rails against the perceived softness of many different groups: Louis C.K.\u2019s victims, Kevin Hart\u2019s detractors in the gay community, and Michael Jackson\u2019s survivors, whom he says he doesn\u2019t believe anyway. Chappelle also directs his exasperation at his own audience, or at least the kinds of viewers who aren\u2019t interested in supporting artists and celebrities responsible for horrendous things. \u201cIf you do anything wrong in your life,\u201d he ventriloquizes, \u201cand I find out about it, I\u2019m gonna try to take everything away from you. \u2026 You\u2019re fucking finished.\u201d But as is so often the case with those who accuse others of having thin skin, it\u2019s mostly projection. \u201cThis is the worst time ever to be a celebrity,\u201d Chappelle complains early on. He bemoans \u201ccelebrity hunting season\u201d several more times, and a photo montage during the end credits, in which the comedian poses with the likes of Will Smith, Jay-Z, Kanye West, Chris Rock, and Jon Stewart, betrays his true affiliation despite his car-mechanic-alluding designer coveralls. Even the comedian\u2019s son\u2019s not safe from the wrath of the public. \u201cYou probably gonna get shot, nigga,\u201d Chappelle imagines telling his child, who has just undergone a school-shooting drill. \u201cYou got a famous dad. I talk a lot of shit. They gonna be gunning for you, little buddy.\u201d\n\nGet Slate Culture in Your Inbox The best of movies, TV, books, music, and more, delivered three times a week.

The comedian sells his self-centered worldview, hard: Jackson didn\u2019t molest any kids, because the singer didn\u2019t target a prime candidate like Macaulay Culkin. C.K. didn\u2019t do anything wrong, because exposing himself to female colleagues isn\u2019t a crime worthy of reporting to the police. The opioid crisis makes him understand how white people felt during the crack epidemic, because \u201cI don\u2019t care, either.\u201d I don\u2019t think we can always take Chappelle at his word; his evident obsession with the details of the Jackson cases, in particular, gives the impression that he accepts more of the allegations than he professes to. He\u2019d just rather reach for the neatest narrative or the most puckish punchline than grapple with messy truths. But he obviously also takes pride in serving as an oracle, at least for the kinds of audience members who whistle and applaud when he calls Jackson\u2019s accusers liars or evokes the right\u2019s \u201cgay agenda\u201d by declaring homophobia the single biggest taboo in show business. An audience member who yells out R. Kelly\u2019s name at Chappelle, seemingly asking for an exoneration of that singer too, encapsulates the pact of mutual affirmation between the comedian and his fans. For his part, Chappelle says he thinks Kelly \u201cdid that shit,\u201d but uses the moment to chide Surviving R. Kelly executive producer Dream Hampton for asking him to participate in the documentary\u2014in his telling, yet another instance of the perils of fame.\n\nChappelle does offer a few breaks from the grievance-a-thon, and you respect his prodigious talents, even when his words are depressing as hell. (Kinda-sorta seeing it R. Kelly\u2019s way: \u201cNo such thing as good 36-year-old pussy.\u201d) A final segment on Jussie Smollett might qualify for the least objectionable portion of the special, given the Empire actor\u2019s status as a universal laughingstock. But even then, Chappelle\u2019s decision to call him \u201cJuicy Smolier\u201d (the surname pronounced in the French style) carries an unmistakable ring of homophobia. (So much for the omnipotence of \u201cthe alphabet people.\u201d) The rest feels like the comedian shoring up his reputation as an audacious truth-teller. But you can\u2019t help wondering: If the jokes were so funny on their own, would Chappelle have to spend so much time justifying his right to tell them?", "description": "Chappelle\u2019s once-confrontational comedy now aims for clapter and cringe.", "authors": ["Inkoo Kang"], "top_image": "https://compote.slate.com/images/771dccac-065f-4ba0-960f-435c0d5e1766.jpeg?width=780&height=520&rect=1560x1040&offset=0x0"}
