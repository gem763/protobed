Zeuch's opening pitch in his first big-league start was one he'd like to have back.\n\nThe Toronto right-hander will still have fond memories of the game's end result.\n\nZeuch refocused after Boston's Mookie Betts homered on the first pitch and his Blue Jays teammates picked him up with three home runs in a 4-3 win over the Red Sox on Tuesday night at Rogers Centre.\n\n\"Facing that lineup, he did a good job,\" said Toronto manager Charlie Montoyo. \"I know he feels good about it.\"\n\nCavan Biggio and Reese McGuire hit solo shots for Toronto while Rowdy Tellez hit a go-ahead two-run blast in the fifth inning as the Blue Jays (56-89) ended a seven-game losing skid.\n\n\"We didn't keep the ball in the ballpark,\" said Boston manager Alex Cora. \"When you don't do that, you pay the price at this level.\"\n\nWATCH | Blue Jays beat Red Sox in series opener:\n\nRowdy Tellez homered in the fifth inning to drive in the game-winning run, giving Toronto a 4-3 win over Boston. 1:32\n\nZeuch did well to keep his composure after Betts launched the ball off the foul screen in left field. It was his 28th homer of the year.\n\nThe Red Sox scorched a few more pitches in the opening frame off the 2016 first-round pick. Zeuch gave up a pair of singles before retiring the side.\n\n\"I thought I made adjustments to keep the ball a little farther down in the zone as the game went on,\" Zeuch said. \"But I didn't keep the ball in the zone as much as I would have liked to and it cost me.\"\n\nHe worked 4 1/3 innings, giving up six hits, three earned runs, three walks while striking out one.\n\nReliever Justin Shafer (2-1) worked 1 1/3 innings for the win in the opener of a six-game homestand. Ken Giles closed things out in the ninth for his 19th save.\n\nSearching for wins\n\nThe Red Sox (76-69) have lost four games in a row. Toronto's skid was its longest since a seven-gamer in April 2017.\n\nBiggio tied the game in the third inning by turning on a 1-2 offering from Boston starter Nathan Eovaldi for his 13th homer of the year. McGuire went deep in the fourth for his fifth homer of the season.\n\nThe Red Sox chased Zeuch in the fifth after doubles by Rafael Devers and J.D. Martinez. Reliever Buddy Boshers gave up a two-out single to Andrew Benintendi that scored Martinez to put Boston up 3-2.\n\nEovaldi worked 4 1/3 innings and allowed six hits, three earned runs and two walks while fanning six.\n\nHis replacement, Josh Taylor (1-2), was greeted with Tellez's 18th homer of the year. Biggio also came across after reaching on a leadoff walk.\n\n\"I'm just getting to pitches that I need to get to,\" Tellez said. \"I'm not trying to do too much. Sometimes in situations when I was younger, I was trying to hit balls a country mile when all you need to do is hit it right over the wall.\"", "description": "Rowdy Tellez hit a go-ahead two-run shot in the fifth inning \u2014 one of three Toronto homers on the night \u2014 as the Blue Jays defeated the Boston Red Sox 4-3 on Tuesday at Rogers Centre.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5278680.1568168902!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/bba-red-sox-blue-jays-20190910.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
