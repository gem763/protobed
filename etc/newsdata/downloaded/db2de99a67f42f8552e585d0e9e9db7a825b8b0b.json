Representative government, or not, in Iraq,\" Thomas said on \"Face the Nation\" Sunday. \"So there'll be a void, and I think they will rally. These are resilient adversaries. We've done nothing to knock down the ideology, and I think they'll see this is certainly a respite if not an opportunity to have a resurgence.\"\n\nAfter President Trump ordered an unexpected withdrawal of the U.S. troops tasked with preventing fighting between Turkey and U.S.-allied Kurdish forces in northern Syria, the Turkish military launched a full-blown offensive with the help of Arab militants to take the land held by the Kurds, which the government in Ankara has long accused of fostering discord and terrorism within Turkey.\n\nThe swift Turkish-led incursion prompted Mr. Trump to order a \"deliberate withdrawal\" of all of the approximately 1,000 U.S. troops in northern Syria \u2014 a decision which elicited strong bipartisan condemnation from lawmakers who accused the White House of abandoning the Kurdish forces that were instrumental in U.S. efforts to defeat the territorial ISIS caliphate.\n\nAmid the pressure from Congress, the White House on Thursday brokered what it called a temporary ceasefire that required Turkey to end hostilities for five days to give Kurdish forces a chance to abandon their positions from areas Ankara is looking to occupy.\n\nThe brief ceasefire, however, remains fragile and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has vowed to resume the offensive if the Kurdish withdrawal does not come to fruition.\n\nAsked if the Kurds have been effectively asked to surrender by the American-backed deal, Thomas replied, \"I think they are being asked to survive.\"", "description": "\"I think they'll see this is certainly a respite if not an opportunity to have a resurgence,\" retired General Raymond Thomas told \"Face the Nation\"", "authors": ["Camilo Montoya-Galvez"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/20/3d3de62d-f0ea-4169-9d58-393ff700b33f/thumbnail/1200x630/f9ef533d9ad882d91f5866ee66eee600/thomas1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
