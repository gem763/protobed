This was such a dominant, sleek victory that it must have felt as if it was happening to another football club but Arsenal are entitled to ascribe it some longer-term significance. On another occasion the return of H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn, who was roared on to the pitch as a substitute and promptly set up their third goal with his first contribution after nine months out, might have been the obvious good news story but this time it was difficult to know where to start.\n\nProvisions must be made for the fact Nottingham Forest, distracted by a Championship promotion campaign that resumes on Friday, were present in little more than name. But there were visions of Arsenal as they might yet be. They have missed the composure of Rob Holding, sidelined for a similar period to Beller\u00edn, but saw him rise confidently on his first appearance since December for the header that doubled their lead.\n\nA fit Kieran Tierney might well have illuminated the season\u2019s early weeks and now, on his debut, he could be seen tearing up the left flank and delivering a stream of smart crosses. Gabriel Martinelli, who scored their first and last goals, looks an outstanding prospect at centre-forward while Joe Willock suggested further what we already know: that there are few 20-year-old midfielders with comparable potential in English football.\n\n\u201cIt was a good result and we can be positive that we have different options for different matches,\u201d Unai Emery said. Martinelli, who is 18, looks a serious one. Arsenal\u2019s young recruits from South America have often disappeared after being subjected to obscure loan spells but there is something different about the Brazilian, who careered on to an excellent volleyed cross from Calum Chambers to thud in the opener and then curled a deflected fifth at the end.\n\nTottenham crash out of Carabao Cup to Colchester on penalties Read more\n\n\u201cHe deserves it,\u201d Emery said. \u201cHe has worked and trained with big spirit and a big performance.\u201d Martinelli showed impressive strength and footwork throughout. Willock, who has a happy knack of arriving in threatening areas, stood out too and was the beneficiary of Beller\u00edn\u2019s overlap and centre in the 77th minute. With a moment like that, it was as if the Spain international had never been away; Emery said he had wanted to play the entire 90 minutes but must be patient, with Monday\u2019s game at Manchester United also likely to be too soon for a start.\n\nNot to worry: Chambers, an unexpected success as stand-in right-back against Aston Villa on Sunday, shone again in that position and then switched flanks upon Beller\u00edn\u2019s introduction, subsequently setting up a finish on the stretch from Reiss Nelson for number four. He must have felt far from view during last season\u2019s loan with a desperate Fulham but, at 24, looks ready to contribute if he can nail down a position.\n\nThat is a debate for another day. The only semblance of a cloud for Arsenal on this one was the first-half departure of Emile Smith Rowe, who went off on a stretcher as a precaution after taking a blow to the head. Even Mesut \u00d6zil\u2019s wheeling-out as captain, which could have been pored over if things had gone differently, generally escaped scrutiny.\n\n\u201cI think the game for us in 90 minutes was very consistent,\u201d Emery concluded and, if that becomes a familiar refrain, expectations of Arsenal may have to be adjusted yet again.", "description": "The Brazilian teenager Gabriel Martinelli scored twice and Rob Holding marked his comeback from injury with a goal as Arsenal thrashed Nottingham Forest 5-0 in the Carabao Cup", "authors": ["Nick Ames"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb55e69f1deb5b217bb9b7092ec281a5e893d374/0_111_1967_1180/master/1967.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2e54394e7089b27c56d44aac82e5c82a", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
