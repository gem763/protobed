Peter Braig\n\nTuesday's reduction in the local benchmark cash rate to a record-low 0.75 per cent contributes to a global lowering of interest rates that is prompting institutional investors to seek higher-yielding assets. Consultancy PwC says the hunt for higher returns will near-double the allocation of institutional assets under management in commercial real estate from $US1.2 trillion ($1.8 trillion) in 2016 to $US2.2 trillion by 2025.\n\nDevelopers are gladly offering assets to soak up some of that money. Macquarie Bank last week kicked off a campaign to sell the 30,000 sq m office tower it has won approval to develop at 39 Martin Place, in the core of Sydney's CBD. The sale of the tower, with an estimated price tag of $750 million, could pit local investors such as AMP Capital against deep-pocketed overseas institutions.\n\nAlso last week, Investa's unlisted wholesale office fund launched a $500 million capital raising to finance development projects and new acquisitions and to replenish the fund's balance sheet.\n\nAny lowering by Stockland off the return targets it set out at its last earnings presentation in August of 7 per cent to 9 per cent on recurring income assets and 12 per cent to 16 per cent on active income assets would please Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, who in August called for companies to invest more, rather than return cash to shareholders.\n\nIt would also show companies are responding to the lower-growth environment, as veteran economist Ian Harper last month said they should.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe market is telling you to invest,\" Reserve Bank board member Dr Harper said. \"Maybe those hurdle rates need to be revisited.\u201d\n\nUnder the weight of capital searching for a home, hurdle rates will come down over the next five to seven years as investors such as pension funds allocate more capital to real estate assets, AMP Capital head of real estate research Luke Dixon said.\n\nThe Hodes-Weill & Associates 2018 Institutional Real Estate Allocations Monitor report shows institutional allocations to real estate rose from 8.9 per cent in 2013 to a likely 10.6 per cent in 2019. If it continued on the same trajectory this could rise to between 13 per cent and 14 per cent in five years' time, Mr Dixon said.\n\n\"You could see a material uplift in overall real estate allocation by global pension funds,\" he said. \"They need the annuity income.\"\n\nThis would push hurdle rates down over the next five to seven years, he said.\n\n\"Whether that\u2019s 100 basis points or 300 basis points I can\u2019t tell, but they will trend downwards,\" Mr Dixon said.\n\nThe lower-yield environment is also causing investors to shift the goalposts and consider lower-yielding assets than they have in the past, he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The definition of core real estate is starting to change,\" Mr Dixon said. \"Traditionally it\u2019s always been office and retail.\"\n\nAssets such as logistics, health care, storage, childcare, education and \u2013 in the US \u2013 multi-family build-to-rent assets were gaining in popularity, he said.\n\n\"Core is being redefined for its income profile.\"", "description": "The head of the country's largest diversified developer says his board is likely to revise investment return benchmarks.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2356%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_253%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/26d14f054f1e37c261e791699f05d0c1cfc0733e", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
