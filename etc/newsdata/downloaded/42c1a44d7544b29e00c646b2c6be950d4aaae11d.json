The Bears were aided by a pass interference call and, after forcing Washington to call three timeouts, Thomas connected on a field goal shorter than an extra point.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a dream come true, basically. It\u2019s like what you ask for as a kicker, last kick comes down to you and you make it,\u201d Thomas said\n\nWashington (1-1, 0-1) took a 19-17 lead with 2:05 left when Peyton Henry hit a career-best 49-yard field goal that sneaked inside the right upright. It was the last of Henry\u2019s four field goals, two of which came inside 25 yards.\n\n\u201cCertainly kicking too many field goals isn\u2019t going to get it done for us. That was frustrating. Really frustrating,\u201d Washington coach Chris Petersen said.\n\nGarbers was 11 of 18 for 111 yards passing, but it was California\u2019s run game that controlled the night. Marcel Dancy ran for 72 yards and a pair of third-quarter touchdowns of 20 and 8 yards, and Christopher Brown Jr. added 80 yards rushing.\n\nDancy spun his way through several tackles and scored on a 20-yard run just as midnight approached, pulling the Bears even at 10-10 early in the third quarter. It was Cal\u2019s first offensive touchdown against the Huskies since the 2016 game, after scoring only defensive touchdowns in the past two meetings.\n\nHis 8-yard TD gave the Bears a 17-13 lead going to the fourth quarter. The Bears rushed for 124 yards in the third quarter alone after having just 90 yards total offense in the first half.\n\nAfter a terrific debut a week ago, Washington quarterback Jacob Eason was 18 of 30 passing for 162 yards, one interception and a fumble lost. And the Huskies left points on the board. Washington had a chance to take the lead midway through the fourth quarter after a 16-play drive to the Cal 2 where it faced fourth-and-1. But Washington was called for a false start and settled for Henry\u2019s third field goal of the game, this time from 25-yard to cut the deficit to 17-16 with 7:10 left.\n\nThat was Washington\u2019s last chance at finding the end zone. Washington\u2019s Salvon Ahmed rushed for 119 yards and the Huskies\u2019 only touchdown.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to execute better down there. Same old situation,\u201d Petersen said.\n\nEASON\u2019S SECOND ACT\n\nEason found life against California much more difficult than the opener against Eastern Washington. After throwing for 349 yards and four touchdowns against the FCS school, Eason was flustered, flushed and forced into mistakes. He threw his first interception. He had another turnover on a sack and fumble. He was a bit late with a throw to Andre Baccellia in the end zone and missed a chance at a touchdown that would have given the Huskies a seven-point lead in the first half.\n\nSTORMY NIGHT\n\nThe teams played 5 minutes, 14 seconds of the first quarter before suddenly being brought to a halt shortly before 8 p.m. Severe thunderstorms and lightning were moving from the south toward the Seattle metro area. Teams cleared the field and fans sitting in metal bleacher sections of Husky Stadium were encouraged to seek shelter.\n\nThe warning was accurate.\n\nThe storms moved swiftly into the area. Within minutes of the delay, lightning was flashing in the sky. Fans were removed from the open bleachers of the stadium and huddled under cover or in the concourses of the stadium. Thousands made their way to the parking lots surrounding Husky Stadium and resumed tailgating, although many just got in their vehicles and headed home with the already late kickoff.\n\nAs the rain picked up in intensity, the sky was a continual flash as lightning was constant throughout the area.\n\nShortly after 10 p.m., Petersen grabbed a stadium microphone and announced the game was resuming.\n\n\u201cThe key in those things is you don\u2019t want them falling asleep and you don\u2019t want them banging their heads on the locker for two hours,\u201d Wilcox said. \u201cYou just stay in that zone and they did. We were fine.\u201d\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nCalifornia: The Bears won their sixth straight season-opening game away from home, including wins at Texas, Northwestern and North Carolina. \u2026 LB Evan Weaver had 18 tackles, two tackles for loss and a forced fumble.\n\nWashington: The Huskies need to find a solution to their run defense. The 192 yards rushing by California was the most allowed by Washington since the Fiesta Bowl two years ago, when Penn State, led by Saquon Barkley, rushed for 203.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCalifornia: The Bears return home to host North Texas.\n\nWashington: The Huskies return to non-conference play hosting Hawaii.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "It took until early Sunday morning before California could run onto the field in celebration, party with the few Golden Bears fans still hanging around and enjoy another victory over Washington.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tim Booth"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/08/california_washington_football_17721_c0-124-2970-1855_s1770x1032.jpg?6f10403a88b04f3af5506aca99333a92b37c1bb6", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
