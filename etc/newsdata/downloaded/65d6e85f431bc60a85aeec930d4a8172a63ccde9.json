In particular knowing that his/her mother was killed so they could be sold into a life of captivity through the illegal pet trade.'\n\nThe orangutan was far more behaved when his family posed for a picture\n\nOrangutans are native to Indonesia and Malaysia and share 97 per cent of their DNA with humans.\n\nThey have been studied for decades for their learning abilities and intelligence.\n\nSadly, experts predict the critically endangered great apes will be extinct in the wild within 10 years in Sumatra and shortly after that in Borneo.\n\nLogging, fires, palm oil plantations and poachers pose the biggest threats for the beautiful animals.", "description": "Australian father Ian Roles, 42, was at\u00a0Bali Zoo, near Denpasar, with his family on Saturday when he posed for a photograph with a cheeky orangutan.", "authors": ["Kelsey Wilkie For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/05/19975888-0-image-a-2_1571632327878.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
