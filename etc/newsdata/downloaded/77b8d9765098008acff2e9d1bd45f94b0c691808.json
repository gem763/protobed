And the fact that it comes out as President Trump\u2019s reelection campaign looms doesn\u2019t hurt.\n\nIn fact, while it is decidedly not one of them, Dignity looks at first blush like it might be another \u201chow we got Trump\u201d entry; that familiar genre replete with Midwestern diners and struggling main streets and fed-up fiftysomething men grousing in dive bars. Dignity also resembles British conservative Theodore Dalrymple\u2019s Life at the Bottom, an exploration of the (mostly white) British underclass. But what sets Arnade apart is that he is not a professional journalist or sociologist, peppering analysis or narrative with anecdotes gleaned and selectively chosen from a few quick trips out to Middle America. Anecdotes of Middle America\u2014and the Bronx, and Selma\u2014are almost the entire book.\n\nWhile Arnade has found favor with conservatives\u2014two of my colleagues at The American Conservative have written about his work, and J. D. Vance of Hillbilly Elegy fame has a blurb on the back\u2014he is himself a classic leftist. The sort, for example, who believes that \u201cpolitical structures are far more responsible for people\u2019s behavior than individual responsibility.\u201d On the other hand, he decries the fact that America\u2019s elite \u201conly care about one form of meaning, which is the economic.\u201d He is firm in his conviction that racism is to blame for much of the black community\u2019s struggles; but he also notes that he has been excommunicated by some on the Left for caring just as much about struggling white people. He eschews technocracy and believes that the problems he observes are simply \u201ctoo big for any policies.\u201d Arnade is refreshing in his mix of humility and forthrightness.\n\nFirst, an element that conservatives might not like: Arnade firmly believes in harm reduction when it comes to vices like prostitution and drug addiction. He helps some of his subjects avoid police run-ins, and at one point finds a drug user a place to shoot up safely. He passes little or no moral judgment on these habits and lifestyles. To a cynic or a traditionalist, this can all look like enabling antisocial behavior by seeking to reduce its costs. One can also imagine the argument being leveled, at least regarding the people of color he meets, that Arnade is the \u201creal racist,\u201d betraying the bigotry of low expectations by eschewing personal responsibility and individual agency.\n\nBut none of this would be accurate, let alone charitable. Arnade explains that his support for harm reduction comes from humility: from observing that in far too many cases what cops or social program managers think is best for transient or struggling people simply does not work. He does not presume to know what will work, but perhaps it is cruel to make life as difficult as possible for such people, especially when little is being done to remedy the conditions that shaped their suboptimal choices.\n\nIf the reader can accept this approach to social problems, then the rest of the book is likely to be easy reading, though not pleasant. The core theme of Dignity is that America is increasingly divided into two classes and worldviews, which Arnade dubs \u201cfront row\u201d and \u201cback row.\u201d To simplify only a little, in the front row are rootless elites who rush out of their hometowns, pile up degrees, and chase high-paying or high-prestige jobs. Most of the people in the higher reaches of journalism, government, business, and academia fall into this category. \u201cBack row\u201d America includes the people who couldn\u2019t, or didn\u2019t want to, leave their hometowns; who value non-material and non-economic things like family, place, home, and faith.\n\nLike all categories, these are much neater than the real world, but they capture a core truth: the elite do not fully understand why people would choose a lifestyle different than their own, and often are not fully aware of the systemic barriers to doing so. The resulting policies and worldviews they propagate are not necessarily malicious, but they are often ignorant and counterproductive. Despite imagining themselves as individualistic and free-thinking, the front row tends to do what Arnade himself did before he left his plum job as a Wall Street trader: \u201cI had removed myself from the realities of the majority of Americans.\u201d\n\nBut for all the opportunities Dignity offers to consider policy and economics, or to cast shade at the elite, this is almost all subtext. The book is centered on the people and communities Arnade meets, whether in various McDonalds or deserted main streets or disfavored urban neighborhoods or Wal-Mart parking lots off interstate ramps. Arnade\u2019s America, largely invisible to the elites, is an unrelentingly grim one. It is an America ravaged by decades of drug addiction, drug war, urban crime, racism, white flight, and deindustrialization. Arnade demonstrates something familiar to watchers of the 2016 election: America is divided by class and race to be sure, but it is also divided, perhaps even more decisively, by geography.\n\nOne realizes, particularly when reading the interviews with older African Americans, how recently in our history grinding poverty was the norm, and how short our time as a more-or-less universally affluent country has been. Arnade himself remembers shotgun houses without running water, and plenty of his interviewees do too. One also realizes, or is reminded, that many African Americans have never enjoyed a standard of living befitting a developed country.\n\nAfter seeing Arnade\u2019s photos, included between chapters, and reading story after story of decline and disintegration\u2014a homeless dad pushing dirty kids aimlessly around in a shopping cart; more ruined downtowns than you can count, some miles and miles from the nearest schlocky chain store; mass graves for dead homeless off Long Island\u2014one wonders whether the United States really is a developed country. Many social scientists no longer think so. In fact, one at times even struggles to believe everything Arnade recounts, though there is no reason to disbelieve him other than what not doing so would do to your own sense of virtue and patriotism. Perhaps the most charitable explanation for why the elites ignore the plight of the \u201cback row\u201d is that they cannot imagine that any of this actually happens in America.\n\nIn perhaps the most unsettling vignette, Arnade learns about one of the only jobs available in Selma: scraping the mortar off old bricks, salvaged from demolished warehouses that once, perhaps, provided somewhat better jobs. The work pays poorly, is very hard, and not infrequently results in injury. The work exists because salvaged bricks are worth a lot of money for their \u201chistorical charm.\u201d \u201cMost of the buyers,\u201d Arnade explains, \u201care fancy restaurants in fancy neighborhoods, places where Selma seems so far away.\u201d\n\nThere are other interesting bits that underscore how independent people are, and how they resist easy categorization. There are African Americans who decry racism, rap, and black-on-black crime all at once. There are Somalis who prefer white neighborhoods to black ones, because they feel they are not welcomed as \u201creally\u201d black. There is a transgender woman, a prostitute, and many drug addicts who believe strongly in God and Jesus. There are charming, chaotic street scenes in which a kind of order and equilibrium somehow establishes itself.\n\nArnade has few policy recommendations, though he pointedly condemns an economic system that \u201crequires everyone to always be economic migrants.\u201d He makes few moral judgments, preferring to view human behavior, at least at the macro level, as arising out of certain contexts and conditions. His conclusion\u2014that we should listen to each other and open our eyes\u2014will strike some readers as anticlimactic. But perhaps there is no other answer.\n\nHow easy would it be for the average person to go, Arnade-style, to disfavored neighborhoods and learn about \u201cback row\u201d America? \u201cNothing negative ever happened,\u201d Arnade says: no muggings, no stabbings. Even in the \u201cworst\u201d places, the vast majority of people are basically decent. Arnade suggests spending some time in a poor or majority-minority neighborhood (too often the same thing) near you. Some people, ensconced, perhaps, in exurban superzips, will bristle at this. It\u2019s okay to bristle, because it means you\u2019re listening.\n\nAddison Del Mastro is assistant editor of The American Conservative.
