The pair bid adieu ahead of another long day of rehearsals\n\nEarlier this month, David shut down rumours of falling victim to the so-called Strictly curse.\n\nCompeting on Strictly requires hard work and often draws competitors away from their families, creating rifts between loved ones. This phenomenon is known as the Strictly curse and has led to several divorces and breakups.\n\nA series of couples have fallen victim to the curse since the show's inception in 2004, including Natasha Kaplinsky, Ben Cohen, Louise and Jamie Redknapp, and more recently Neil and Katya Jones.\n\nThe show is also responsible for forming new romances, with lovebirds Giovanni Pernice and Ashley Roberts and Joe Sugg and Dianne Buswell embarking on romances following the 2018 series.\n\nSharing his thoughts on the claims, the BT Sport pundit told The Mirror: 'My view is that, in life itself, if two people are attracted to each other then something might happen, and it doesn\u2019t need to be Strictly that causes that.\n\n'Nadiya is a fantastic teacher, I want to be a fantastic student, but we\u2019re on Strictly Come Dancing, not Love Island or some other show where people get themselves together\n\nAs I said, I think the chemistry between the two of us is perfect because we know what we\u2019re here for and we\u2019re enjoying the process, even though being in the dance-off isn\u2019t fun. If that\u2019s what it looks like then we\u2019re happy.'\n\nThe pair kicked off the dance series with an average 17 out of 40 points, before landing the lowest score of the evening the following week.\n\nBouncing back with a mere 16 points in week 3, the dancers achieved their highest score in week 4 with 28 points.\n\n'We're not on Love Island': Earlier this month, David shut down rumours of falling victim to the so-called Strictly curse", "description": "The former footballer, 49, and the ballroom dancer, 30, put on a cosy display as they strolled along London on Wednesday following a long day of refining their footwork for Saturday's live show.", "authors": ["Rianne Addo For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/18/19848948-0-image-a-34_1571331802458.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
