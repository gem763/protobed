In fact, she challenged Ford\u2019s accuracy. \u2018I don\u2019t have any confidence in the story.'\u201d\n\nThis on-the-record quote is the first time that Keyser has spoken publicly about what was previously reported in detail in the new bestseller \u201cJustice on Trial: The Kavanaugh Confirmation and the Future of the Supreme Court\u201d (of which this writer is co-author).\n\nThe New York Times authors dismiss Keyser\u2019s statement as the product of a bad memory, before noting that their unsuccessful efforts to corroborate Blasey Ford\u2019s claims including desperately searching for a house that matched the description she gave. Nevertheless, their \u201cgut\u201d told them to believe her in the absence of facts.", "description": "", "authors": ["Mollie Hemingway", "Thefederalist.Com New-Book-Christine-Blasey-Fords-Friend-Leland-Keyser-Doesnt-Believe"], "top_image": ""}
