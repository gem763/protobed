Jute in particular is a highly sustainable, rapidly renewable resource that relies on rainfall rather than hugely consuming irrigation systems to mature.\n\nThe plant grows very quickly and doesn\u2019t require the addition of harmful chemical pesticides. It also enhances the fertility of the soil it grows on for future crops, and is a recyclable material. A bit of a hero product, then.\n\nBeing a natural material, jute rugs can come in slightly different forms so there are a number of things to consider when making your purchase: the thickness of the weave you\u2019re looking for; the softness under foot; the colours that are interwoven through it; and whether you want a more rustic or refined finish.\n\nTaking all those factors into consideration, we\u2019ve rounded up the best natural rugs to give your home that raw, boho charm \u2013 for every budget.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

If you\u2019ve been umming and ahhing over whether to purchase this jute rug for a while, we can happily recommend that you snap it up. Fast. Why do we love it so much? It\u2019s soft underfoot as well as hardwearing. After three weeks taking pride of place in a heavy-traffic living room, the rug showed no signs of wear and tear and, if anything, got softer. Over time, it offers a lived-in but not shabby look. And the large size for \u00a380? It\u2019s a bargain.\n\nBuy now\n\nHole-patterned jute natural rug: \u00a379.99, H&M\n\nDimensions: D180cm\n\nInject a slice of bohemian chic into your home with this cutout circular natural rug. Pair it with colourful floral-print cushions, wooden furniture and metallic accent pieces for a luxury boho vibe worthy of a cool Californian pad. We found this rug to be well made, albeit a little on the thin side compared to others, and a good size for the price tag.\n\nBuy now\n\nRiya extra large woven jute natural rug: \u00a3249, Made\n\nDimensions: 200 x 300cm\n\nThis large, woven jute rug is the perfect statement piece to place under your sofa, bed, or dining table. Comfortable yet practical, it\u2019s durable and easy to hoover, as well as looking stylish \u2013 the holy grail of rugs. We particularly like how it\u2019s interwoven with black, offering a slightly different look to all-natural-hued versions, and the rural basket weave design is on-trend yet timeless.\n\nBuy now\n\nGlendive handwoven brown area natural rug: \u00a383.99, Wayfair\n\nDimensions: 91 x 152cm\n\nThe only rug in the list that\u2019s interwoven with wool, this smart natural jute rug is supremely comfortable, as well as being resilient and cosy. We found it a little thicker than many of the other rugs and, while this added a sumptuous, luxurious feel, it does stand prouder from the ground, so is a style factor to consider if you prefer a rug that blends seamlessly into the floor. The rug offers a high-quality ribbed loop wool boucle pile and jute yarn, which has been handcrafted by skilled weavers on a loom using traditional techniques. Not only is it a lovely artisanal product, it\u2019s also GoodWeave-certified, which means it\u2019s helping to support fairer working conditions, too.\n\nBuy now\n\nJute boucle natural rug: \u00a3134, West Elm\n\nDimensions: 152 x 244cm\n\nThis is one for the social and ecologically-focused consumer. Similar in style to the lohals rug from Ikea, but it\u2019s a little more expensive. But for the higher price margin, you\u2019re purchasing a product that\u2019s certified to Nest standards, a non-profit organisation that works to improve women\u2019s wellbeing beyond factories, and preserve important cultural traditions around the world. This particular rug is handcrafted with jute in southern India. It\u2019s durable and soft, but easy to keep clean and doesn\u2019t highlight dirt. We noticed a little bit of shedding of fibres at first, but this dissipated over a month with regular vacuuming.\n\nBuy now\n\nEnso seagrass natural rug: \u00a3142, Maisons du Monde\n\nDimensions: D180cm\n\nSlightly raw and a little wild, this natural seagrass rug is perfect for adding a rustic-chic feel to your home. While seagrass is not quite as comfortable as jute \u2013 it has a more rigid feel \u2013 it\u2019s also very resilient and practical. It\u2019s ideal for a nautical or boho room, with its durable fibre protecting your floor while creating a stylish finish. Not as easy to hoover as a flat jute rug, but we loved its earthy, back-to-nature texture.\n\nBuy now\n\nHempy pure jute rectangular natural rug: \u00a3240, La Redoute\n\nDimensions: 160 x 230cm\n\nJute rugs can often have a very raw look due to the fact they\u2019re handcrafted with a natural fibre. However, we love how this rug is given a luxury spin by the way it\u2019s been weaved into ever-decreasing rectangles. The overall effect is smart yet informal, and adds that relaxed look without being too rustic. What\u2019s more, we found the quality to be high. It got softer over time, was easy to clean and very hardwearing.\n\nBuy now\n\nCroft Collection jute round natural rug: \u00a3100, John Lewis & Partners\n\nDimensions: D180cm\n\nWell-known for its good-quality products, John Lewis & Partners doesn\u2019t disappoint with this lovely round jute rug. It boasts an appealing honey-toned hue with some darker threads weaved through, and the classic style will perfectly match any neutral-themed home. A good size, a good price, and good craftsmanship.\n\nBuy now\n\nNatural chunky jute natural rug: \u00a3179, Dunelm\n\nDimensions: 200 x 290cm\n\nThis might be a chunky-weave rug but it has a lovely slim profile, and sits well on the floor (no upturned corners or unsightly bumps). It has some lovely tones running through it, with rust and black hues intricately woven into the body, for a slightly different look. The price is reasonable for its large size and, as with most of the other options on the list, it comes in different dimensions if you want to go smaller and don\u2019t want to splash out too much.\n\nBuy now\n\nNatural handspun jute natural rug: \u00a345, George at Asda\n\nDimensions: D133cm\n\nNot necessarily the first place you might think of to buy a rug for your home, this round jute number has received rave reviews online, and with good reason. It\u2019s well-made, really robust, super-soft and a fantastic price point. It\u2019s a little smaller than some of the other rugs, and isn\u2019t available in other sizes, so if you\u2019re looking for a statement, large piece it might not be for you. However, it\u2019s the perfect rug to put at the end of the bed or in a small kitchen.\n\nBuy now\n\nJute natural rug: \u00a344.99, Carpetright\n\nDimensions: 100 x 150cm\n\nAnother small but perfectly formed option is this jute rug from Carpetright. We found it to be a very raw version, with more loose and stray fibres than some of the other alternatives. However, this may be a plus if it\u2019s a really rustic look you\u2019re after. It\u2019s ideal for a small dining space, living room or kitchen, and would be great to add an organic feel to an otherwise more modern room.\n\nBuy now\n\nBraided natural rug: \u00a3325, The White Company\n\nDimensions: 120 x 180cm\n\nFor a spot of real luxury (and if your wallet is feeling rather full), treat yourself to the beautiful braided jute rug from The White Company. With the smallest size starting at \u00a3325, it\u2019s the most expensive option on the list. But it feels soft and looks smart, with the plaited finish offering a more polished, sophisticated feel. It would make the perfect finish for any elegant, neutral-themed space.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe Verdict: Natural rugs\n\nIf you\u2019ve already spent thousands decorating your home, and the rug budget is a little diminished, you really can\u2019t go wrong with the reliable yet stylish lohals from Ikea. It fits nicely with any interior, adding a warm texture to a contemporary home and even more charm to a character property, while also being durable and comfortable. If you have a little more left in the pot, the La Redoute hempy rug is a brilliant option for a slightly more refined rustic aesthetic.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
