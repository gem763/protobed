A prog\u00adramme over the next 20 years to build three million social homes is affordable and would ensure people don\u2019t have to face homelessness in retirement.\u201d\n\nThe survey of 3,995 private renters is released today on World Homeless Day.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nSky-high house prices and a lack of social housing have left hundreds of thousands of older people stuck in expensive private rental properties.\n\nThe Tories\u2019 benefits cap means private rents have outstripped housing allowance in 97% of areas in England, leaving pensioners struggling to cover the shortfall.\n\nThere are more than a million people on the waiting list for social rent homes.\n\nGovernment figures show over 8,000 people aged 65 and over have become homeless or been threatened with homelessness in the past year.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nAge UK says rising rents are leaving around 33% of older renters in poverty.\n\nIt added that Section 21 orders, when private landlords can repossess a property without giving a reason to tenants, means 750,000 older renters face uncertainty and the risk of homelessness.\n\nI'm being kicked out - but now rent has gone through the roof\n\nGail Hickman, 68, gave up her home of 14 years in a secured tenancy to move to a rented bungalow for health reasons.\n\nAfter just nine months she was asked to leave by the landlord and now can\u2019t find anywhere else to live as local rents have \u201cgone through the roof\u201d.\n\nGail, from Bideford, Devon, spent her career working as a private investigator specialising in helping adopted children find their birth parents.\n\nShe said: \u201cI was promised a long-term tenancy. I have now been given notice to quit after nine months as the property is \u2018required for their family\u2019. I am a gold star tenant, pay my rent in full on time, live quietly, don\u2019t drink or smoke and have excellent references from my previous landlord.\n\n\u201cMy previous rent was \u00a3525 for 14 years, then increased to \u00a3650 for this property. Now rental prices have gone through the roof.\n\n\u201cAs a state pensioner on benefits it\u2019s simply unaffordable for me, plus all the cost and upheaval of moving again in such a short time and the money I have spent here like fitting blinds on windows, lampshades, rugs, carpets, furniture, etc.\n\n\u201cI am beyond distressed.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Homelessness charity Shelter says the only solution is to build three million social homes", "authors": ["Amy Coles", "Image", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20547013.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Waiting-in-line-for-a-bowl-of-soup.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
