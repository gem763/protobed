It was built to hold 778.\n\n\u201cWhen we take the example of the National Penitentiary, which is the largest detention center in the country, it could be likened to a concentration center,\u201d lamented Haitian lawyer Jacques Letang.\n\nOutside prison walls, opponents of President Jovenel Moise have protested what they see as his illegitimate election in 2016, barricading roads and snarling supplies of staple foods, while raising fears that the country\u2019s already precarious humanitarian situation will become worse.\n\n\u201cAmid the crisis, it\u2019s hard to get food and water to prisons,\u201d Ducena said.\n\nEven the courts themselves have been drawn into the strife.\n\n\u201cAlmost all courts in the country are closed and three judicial buildings have been burned since the beginning of the crisis,\u201d Ducena said.\n\n\u201cThe situation is always alarming, and rather than take risks, lawyers and judges stay at home.\u201d\n\nThe Port-au-Prince courthouse \u201cis sandwiched between the fiefs of several rival gangs,\u201d Ducena said.\n\nIn the area around the public prosecutor\u2019s office in Port-au-Prince, armed groups routinely divert vehicles, while gun battles have broken out at random for the past year.\n\n\u2013 Justice delayed \u2013\n\nThe paralyzed justice system means people jailed while awaiting trial languish as their cases go unheard, Haitian rights organizations say.\n\nAsked about the situation, prison and police authorities in Haiti declined to comment.\n\nThree-quarters of the 10,905 people jailed in Haiti today are awaiting trial, some for more than a decade, in what Letang said was the blatant flouting of criminal procedure.\n\n\u201cAnyone arrested must be able to have their case heard before a judicial authority within 48 hours, but police make arrests and let people spend weeks or months in custody,\u201d said Letang, president of the Human Rights Office in Haiti NGO.\n\nOne way to stop this practice would be to penalize judges who don\u2019t hear cases on time, he said.\n\n\u201cAn examining magistrate who leaves an individual behind bars for years without worrying about his fate has no cause for concern,\u201d Letang said in describing the situation today.\n\nBut judicial reforms will matter little if the corruption rife in Haiti\u2019s justice system is not also addressed.\n\n\u201cToday, if you have money, you do not go to jail long,\u201d Letang said.", "description": "Port-au-Prince (AFP) \u2013 With protests rocking the streets, some prison authorities in Haiti have confined inmates to cells that lack showers or", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/20/fc3bb6_detainees-in-haiti-prisons-are-in-cells-in-rights-groups-say-is-meant-stop-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
