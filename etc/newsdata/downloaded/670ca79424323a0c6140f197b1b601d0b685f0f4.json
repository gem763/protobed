Shortly before his death, Miller took a combination of alcohol, cocaine, and fentanyl (an opioid that\u2019s 50-100x more potent tan morphine).\n\nFentanyl is a cheap synthetic opioid that has played a major part in the opioid crisis that has ravaged the US in recent years.\n\nA grand jury indictment accuses Cameron Pettit, Stephen Walter and Ryan Reavis of conspiring and distributing the fentanyl-laced drugs that lead to the 26-year-old\u2019s untimely death.\n\nThe trio had already been charged with drug-related offences, but the new charges are related to the fact that the counterfeit pills were directly related to Miller\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cThe indictment contains two counts that accuse the men of being responsible for Mac Miller\u2019s death \u2014 a conspiracy count and the narcotics distribution charge. Previously, Pettit and Miller were charged with distributing narcotics, and now the indictment alleges that their conduct resulted in a death,\u201d the United States Attorney\u2019s Office clarified to Rolling Stone.\n\nAccording to the official court documents, the charges include: \u201cconspiracy to distribute controlled substances resulting in death\u201d and \u201cdistribution of Fentanyl resulting in death\u201d among others.\n\nIt is understood that the fentanyl-laced pills came from Walter, who sold them to Pettit before he eventually sold them to Mac Miller on the morning of September 5th 2018.\n\nRyan Reavis stands accused of being the \u201crunner\u201d for Walter, who hand-delivered the counterfeit oxycodone pills to Pettit.\n\nAccording to BBC, prosecutors say that evidence against Pettit includes a text he sent a friend saying \u201cmost likely I will die in jail.\u201d\n\nMiller, who had a history of substance abuse but no history of overdoses, is believed to have purchased the pills under the assumption that they were oxycodone, and not the fentanyl-laced counterfeits.\n\nWalter and Reavis both have criminal histories including previous drug charges, as well as felony ammunition charges. Pettit has also been charged previously with drug-related offences.\n\nIf convicted, the men will face a mandatory prison sentence of at least 20 years. The potential of a life sentence without parole is also possible if it is found that they were in-part responsible for Miller\u2019s death.\n\nREAD MORE Mac Miller\u2019s Dad Goes In On Drug Dealer Arrested Over His Death At Anniversary Vigil", "description": "Three men have been charged with drug-related crimes in relation to rapper Mac Miller's fatal overdose in September 2018.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-612060332.jpg"}
