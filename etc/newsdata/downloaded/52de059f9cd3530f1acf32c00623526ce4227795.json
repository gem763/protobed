What\u2019s happened to this point is an audition, nothing more. If you want to look at a list of scoring leaders, you can find that elsewhere.\n\nAssume a half-point PPR scoring format. Perhaps it\u2019s not the industry standard yet, but it is at Yahoo and I think we\u2019re going there across the board.\n\nPlease don\u2019t get hung up on the exact prices, anyway. What matters most here is how the players relate to one another, where the talent clusters and where the talent drops off. Players at the same price are considered even.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAs always, I will not rank the significantly injured. I don\u2019t see the purpose of it. I tend to be less optimistic about these types of players, but you can decide what they\u2019re worth to you. If you want to hold A.J. Green for weeks and dream of the star he used to be, that\u2019s your business.\n\nAlso, don\u2019t get hung up on the tier names or where the divisions are. We like to break up the copy.\n\nThe Needle-Movers\n\n$44 DeAndre Hopkins\n\n$43 Michael Thomas\n\n$42 Julio Jones\n\n$41 Amari Cooper\n\n$37 Cooper Kupp\n\n$35 Chris Godwin\n\nToo much back-class to bail on Hopkins, who\u2019s still tied to an elite quarterback and an infrastructure that\u2019s always unlocked him in the past. I doubt anyone would be dumb enough to sell-low on Hopkins in a competitive league, but you could pay full freight for him and I\u2019ll sign off . . .\n\nThomas is still at about 90 percent effectiveness even with Drew Brees hurt . . .\n\nStory continues\n\nJones hasn\u2019t popped yet, shocking when you consider Matt Ryan is on a 710-pass pace. But Atlanta\u2019s defense might be unfixable and the running game is going nowhere; the Falcons will be a weekly carnival, and Jones is too good not to bust out shortly. Like Hopkins, I\u2019d say buy low if I thought it was even remotely gettable. But you\u2019re fine if you pay full market, too . . .\n\nIt was hard to know how much amp-up time Kupp would need after a major knee injury; I never could have anticipated this seamless a return. I used to think he was the bass player in the Rams offense, but he looks like Jimi Hendrix now. He\u2019s their most important skill player . . .\n\nI don\u2019t see a major gap between Godwin and Evans, but Godwin\u2019s done too much to deny him the first listing. And the team always shrugged and said these guys were 1 and 1A receiver, anyway; they\u2019re not kissing any ring in the game planning. Follow the volume. And take heart that uber-talented O.J. Howard isn\u2019t a part of this tree, which was extremely narrow to begin with.\n\nSometimes No. 1s, dynamite No. 2s.\n\n$33 Keenan Allen\n\n$33 Mike Evans\n\n$32 Odell Beckham\n\n$32 Adam Thielen\n\n$32 Davante Adams\n\n$31 Tyler Lockett\n\n$29 T.Y. Hilton\n\n$28 Robert Woods\n\n$27 JuJu Smith-Schuster\n\n$25 Kenny Golladay\n\n$24 DJ Chark\n\n$24 Tyler Boyd\n\nBeckham\u2019s raw talent can\u2019t be denied, but Freddie Kitchens might be over his head in Cleveland. And Baker Mayfield remains more of a distributor than a lock-in quarterback; he\u2019s not going to dump 12-15 weekly targets on OBJ every week, just for the heck of it . . .\n\nWoods hasn\u2019t been touchdown-fortunate yet, but the rest of his stats look very similar to last year\u2019s breakout. I don\u2019t see any reason to dramatically change your August opinion of him; in some leagues, he could be gettable under market . . .\n\nSmith-Schuster is talented enough to succeed with anyone, but his first-round upside vanished the moment Ben Roethlisberger was hurt . . .\n\nBoyd is a volume monster who has shown he can produce with or without A.J. Green over the past two years. And Cincinnati figures to be chasing the game more often than not. Whatever you paid in the summer, you\u2019re headed for a tidy profit.\n\n[Play in Yahoo\u2019s NFL $300K Baller. $10 entry fee and $30K to first place]\n\nToo good to sit, but not sure things\n\n$22 Julian Edelman\n\n$22 Will Fuller\n\n$21 Courtland Sutton\n\n$21 Allen Robinson\n\n$21 Brandin Cooks\n\n$20 Larry Fitzgerald\n\n$19 Michael Gallup\n\n$19 Stefon Diggs\n\n$19 Tyrell Williams\n\n$18 DJ Moore\n\n$16 Marvin Jones\n\n$16 John Brown\n\n$16 Alshon Jeffery\n\n$16 Calvin Ridley\n\n$16 Jarvis Landry\n\n$15 Josh Gordon\n\nJosh Gordon has yet to take off in 2019. (Maddie Meyer/Getty Images)\n\nWhen Josh Gordon landed in New England, it was easy to envision the upside and downside. Maybe he\u2019d click with a winning culture and a HOF-tracked quarterback. Or maybe he\u2019d lose his way, like in the past, and encounter his demons again.\n\nDid anyone see the third path? Did anyone really think an available, healthy Gordon could be this . . . ordinary?\n\nGordon has a mediocre 54.3% catch rate in 2019, nothing special when linked to a 14.7 YPC (a healthy 2.5 below his career mark). He\u2019s scored one piddly touchdown. He\u2019s yet to finish better than WR28 in any game this year. This deep into the season, we\u2019re justified to wonder, \u201cIs this all there is?\u201d He\u2019s not even the team\u2019s No. 1 target \u2014 Julian Edelman holds that role. We\u2019re not in it for the names or the past performances, we just want today\u2019s numbers. Gordon is not an automatic play for me in any format.\n\nI have some Sutton shares this year, but I pine for more. The fear of Joe Flacco loomed over everything, but Sutton has at least seven targets in every game and has three touchdowns in the last two weeks. That 10.6 yards per target number jumps out at you, and he\u2019s turned into the team\u2019s featured receiver, eclipsing Emanuel Sanders . . .\n\nMoore has no problems getting open, but often times Kyle Allen doesn\u2019t see him or can\u2019t pull the trigger. The Panthers are winning without Cam Newton, but let\u2019s not kid ourselves \u2014 the offense would be much better off with a healthy Newton . . .\n\nA narrow tree is helping Williams in Oakland, and maybe Derek Carr is better than we initially thought. Say this for Jon Gruden, he prioritizes getting the ball to his best talent.\n\nSunday coin-flippers\n\n$14 Marquise Brown\n\n$14 Curtis Samuel\n\n$13 DK Metcalf\n\n$12 Mike Williams\n\n$12 Robby Anderson\n\n$12 Terry McLaurin\n\n$12 Sammy Watkins\n\n$11 Emmanuel Sanders\n\n$11 Dede Westbrook\n\n$11 Mohamed Sanu\n\n$9 Christian Kirk\n\nAnderson becomes a weekly starter the moment I\u2019m sure Sam Darnold is completely healthy again . . .\n\nMcLaurin\u2019s breakthrough is remarkable, given all the discord around him. And it sounds like Case Keenum returns for Week 6; by default, he\u2019s the best answer Washington currently has . . .\n\nWatkins was lovely in Week 1, but the idea of him being a WR1 and a league winner was always misguided. He\u2019s into his sixth season and has given us plenty of tease moments and recurring injuries. Lucy always talks a good game, but she never holds the football for long . . .\n\nWestbrook is a capable possession guy, but Chark is the juice receiver in Jacksonville, the downfield guy, the full-route guy. Chark also has a more developed rapport with rookie QB Gardner Minshew. Westbrook won\u2019t be more than a WR3/4 this season . . .\n\nSanu sneaks into the weekly flex discussion, as byes pile up and the Falcons keep passing to set up the pass.\n\nGood luck timing the market\n\n$7 A.J. Brown\n\n$7 Golden Tate\n\n$7 Sterling Shepard\n\n$6 Marquez Valdes-Scantling\n\n$6 Preston Williams\n\n$6 Auden Tate\n\n$5 Corey Davis\n\n$5 Jamison Crowder\n\n$5 DeVante Parker\n\n$5 Diontae Johnson\n\n$5 Keke Coutee\n\n$4 Demarcus Robinson\n\n$4 Phillip Dorsett\n\n$4 Darius Slayton\n\nAny wideout tied to Aaron Rodgers used to be a cheat code, but it hasn\u2019t worked for MVS or Allison this year. Name brands die hard. The Packers are just another offense . . .\n\nDavis constantly fails the eyeball test, the idea that someone with his draft pedigree should look like a monster once or twice a game. And Marcus Mariota certainly isn\u2019t a kingmaker at quarterback . . .\n\nCoutee is a handy player until the next injury, which is never far away . . .\n\nRobinson and Hardman are difficult ranks, given the current gridlock and injury uncertainty in Kansas City. It\u2019s a crowded tree, too. And maybe Patrick Mahomes won\u2019t be healthy all year; the ankle has been an issue ever since the treacherous Jaguars game Week 1.\n\nLongshot Lounge\n\n$3 Cole Beasley\n\n$3 Kenny Stills\n\n$3 Geronimo Allison\n\n$2 Demaryius Thomas\n\n$2 Deebo Samuel\n\n$2 Willie Snead\n\n$2 Adam Humphries\n\n$2 Mecole Hardman\n\n$2 Byron Pringle\n\n$2 TreQuan Smith\n\n$2 Nelson Agholor\n\n$1 Danny Amendola\n\n$1 Randall Cobb\n\n$1 Duke Williams\n\n$1 Chris Conley\n\n$1 Marquise Goodwin\n\n$1 Taylor Gabriel\n\n$1 Ted Ginn\n\n$1 KeeSean Johnson\n\n$1 Dante Pettis\n\n$1 Miles Boykin\n\n$1 David Moore\n\n$1 Parris Campbell\n\n$1 Anthony Miller\n\n$0 Paul Richardson\n\n$0 James Washington\n\n$0 Albert Wilson\n\n$0 Zach Pascal\n\n$0 Trey Quinn\n\n$0 Rashard Higgins\n\n$0 Antonio Callaway\n\n$0 DaeSean Hamilton\n\nUnranked until they return\n\nNR Tyreek Hill\n\nNR A.J.
