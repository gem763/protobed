Putin last visited Budapest in 2017.\n\nOrban, a self-styled \u201cilliberal\u201d strongman and anti-immigration figurehead for nationalists around Europe and beyond, has adopted a policy of \u201cEastern opening\u201d in recent years.\n\nHe has tasked his foreign ministry with sourcing trade deals in countries such as Russia, Turkey and China, a strategy that has seen the 55-year-old maverick accused of cozying up to autocrats and dictators.\n\n\u201cOrban presents himself as the bridge between the East and the West,\u201d said Peter Kreko, director of Budapest-based think tank Political Capital.\n\n\u201cEven if Hungary is a member of the Euro-Atlantic alliance, he opens to the East,\u201d he told AFP.\n\n\u2013 Eastern opening \u2013\n\nLast year during a visit to Moscow, Orban denounced EU sanctions on Russia over its annexation of Crimea.\n\nNext week Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan visits Orban in Budapest, soon after praising the Hungarian for his \u201csupport\u201d of Ankara\u2019s military operation in Syria.\n\nOrban has argued that Hungary\u2019s national interest lies in allying with Turkey to avoid it sending millions of Syrian refugees currently in the country toward Europe.\n\nEarlier this month Hungary held up a joint EU statement condemning Turkey\u2019s incursion.\n\nOrban held an anti-Russian stance before becoming premier in 2010, but now calls his foreign policy a \u201cpragmatic\u201d courting of regional powers.\n\nBrushing off western criticism as \u201chypocrisy,\u201d he often cites German and French business and political engagements with Moscow.\n\nPutin\u2019s regular visits to Orban allows the latter to \u201cdemonstrate to his own electorate what an important leader he is,\u201d said Andras Racz, a Russia expert with the German Council on Foreign Relations.\n\n\u201cBut it is equally symbolic that Putin is the only important leader doing so, no one from the EU or NATO is,\u201d he told AFP.\n\n\u2013 Increasing dependence \u2013\n\nWednesday\u2019s agenda, which will feature a joint press conference after their meeting, covers talks on Hungarian-Russian trade and energy relations \u2014 primarily the joint project to expand Hungary\u2019s only nuclear plant at Paks, south of Budapest.\n\nIn 2014 Orban signed a 10-billion euro ($11 billion) loan deal with Putin to build two reactors at the facility, but the two sides have agreed to renegotiate the loan terms.\n\nWith Hungary relying on Russia for around 85 percent of its energy needs, the pair are also due to sign a major gas supply deal.\n\nThey will also finalise a joint consortium project to make railway carriages for Egypt and discuss the headquarters move to Budapest of a controversial Russian-led development bank.\n\nCalled \u201cPutin\u2019s Trojan horse\u201d by critics, the International Investment Bank (IIB)\u2019s shift to an EU capital is seen by some observers, including the US, as potentially enabling spying activity by Russia.\n\nThe bank firmly denies the claims, while Budapest says hosting the IIB will help Hungary become an international financial hub.\n\n\u201cAll the cooperation points to increasing energy dependence on Russia, while under the surface there are increasing signs that the Hungary-Russia relationship is highly asymmetrical,\u201d Kreko said.\n\nThe IIB headquarters move, the Egypt train carriages deal, and a separate expensive refurbishment of Budapest metro carriages by a Russian firm are \u201cgood for Russia, bad for Hungary,\u201d he said.", "description": "Budapest (AFP) \u2013 Russian President Vladimir Putin visits Hungary\u2019s nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban in Budapest Wednesday for trade and", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/29/961cc8_orban-putin-held-talks-annually-years-putin-visits-close-eu-ally-hungary-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
