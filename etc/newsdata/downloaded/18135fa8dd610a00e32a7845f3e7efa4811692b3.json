Right now, we are hurtling towards a new calamity, entirely of our own making, and apparently unwilling to ask the people if they are happy to come along for the ride.\n\nIn truth, the disaster that befell the world economy more than a decade ago was much more than a financial crisis. It was a social and political crisis \u2013 a landmark moment in the erosion of trust between citizens, authorities and experts in those countries most affected.\n\nIn the UK it was cynically and cleverly recast not as an international crisis but a domestic one, by then shadow chancellor George Osborne. He talked of an \u201cage of irresponsibility\u201d, blaming the then Labour government for failed regulation and soaring debt.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nA year later, he talked of spending on the nation\u2019s credit card: \u201cFree social care. Free hospital parking. Free childcare places. We would all like those things. But where is the money coming from? He [Gordon Brown] is treating the British people like fools.\u201d\n\nBoris Johnson\u2019s elevation to No 10 seems to have marked the end of the hard austerity that followed and every new day seems to bring further promises of increased government spending. This time \u00a31.8bn for the NHS, to add to the \u00a37bn to raise the income tax threshold, \u00a31bn for extra police officers, and tens of billions on free ports, full-fibre broadband, and HS3 linking Leeds and Manchester.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. \u2018Brexit is like...\u2019 The Top 20 Twitter analogies Show all 20 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.\" Shutterstock / sasha2109\n\nWhen asked where the money is coming from, ministers resort to smoke and mirrors, even claiming that the extra \u201cfiscal headroom\u201d Philip Hammond once said would be available if we left the EU with a deal, as opposed to without one, is a real stash of cash burning a hole in the Treasury\u2019s pockets.\n\nBut it begs the question, what would Osborne say about the level of debt his former government is getting itself in to resolve Brexit, the self-inflicted domestic crisis?\n\nIn the week after the Bank of England has downgraded its economic forecasts for the UK economy predicting a one-in-three chance of a recession, we are faced with the prospect of government borrowing in excess of \u00a36bn to plan for no deal.\n\nThe nation\u2019s debt in 2019 is approaching \u00a32 trillion, totalling 85 per cent of gross domestic product. Compare that to two years after the financial crisis, when debt was less than \u00a31 trillion and at 70 per cent of GDP.\n\nThere was once talk of \u201cfixing the roof while the sun was shining,\u201d but borrowing in June 2019 was at its highest since 2015. And now our government is recklessly rain-dancing as we edge towards no deal. We could be about to walk into a hurricane, but the chief roofer seems to be determined to break every tile in sight.\n\nOf course, I reject Osborne\u2019s suggestion at the time that Labour failed to repair the roof and we most certainly did not smash a hole in it, then \u201cmax out the credit card\u201d on raincoats. Nor did we tour the country in the midst of a crisis promising everything to everyone as Boris Johnson is doing, claiming there is \u201cfiscal headroom\u201d. Johnson is genuinely \u201ctreating the British people like fools\u201d.\n\nThis is debt for future generations, many of whom never had a say in the issue to which it relates. It is debt for future generations, millions of people who were not in the 0.1 per cent of the population who selected this prime minister.\n\nThis is not good enough.\n\nWhat we have now is a very real domestic crisis. We are not being brought to the brink by events out of our control. We are deciding the course of our future; except of course we are not being given a Final Say. Everything that is wrong about our country can be fixed by everything that is right about our country. Our principles. Our values. Our belief in the fundamentals of democracy. Our people.\n\nEarlier this year, I put forward a compromise motion to ensure any Brexit deal went back to the people for ratification via a people\u2019s vote. I put my faith in them. It is time this government did too.\n\nMargaret Beckett is Labour MP for Derby South", "description": "On 15 September 2008, when Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, it marked the beginning of the global financial crisis.
