It's a uterine fibroid. No one thinks anything of it, but in layman's terms it is a tumour.\n\n\"Luckily not a cancerous tumour, but still a tumour.\n\n\"The size of it was astonishing. The scan came up saying it was 10cm, so about the size of a grapefruit, but it has come out the size of a cantaloupe.\n\n\"It was humongous. It was probably about 15cm wide. It managed to come out in one.\n\n\"My doctor was like a pimple popper - I was so impressed that he got it out in one.\n\n\"I had been carrying that but I hadn't thought of it as heavy because it had been tucked into my womb. It didn't particularly stick out.\n\n(Image: Kennedy News and Media)\n\n\"I've been carrying that around and not realising. It didn't feel heavy.\n\n\"If I lay on my side it wouldn't really move as such because it's all joined in with the rest of my body.\n\n\"I've had it years - maybe seven, maybe more, years. It was never that big, if that makes sense, so it's probably grown in that time.\n\n\"Now I have to recover from the surgery, which is eight to nine weeks physically. In terms of internally, I have got to wait at least six months as well.\n\n\"My whole uterus has been cut in half, basically, to try and get it out.\"\n\nThe mental health worker was warned she may need a hysterectomy due to the size of the tumour depending on how the surgery went.\n\nHowever thankfully everything went according to plan - meaning Sophie is still hoping she can fulfil her dream of having biological children.\n\nIf Sophie gets pregnant in the future, she would not be able to carry to full term to prevent her uterus contracting and therefore risking rupture.\n\nSophie said: \"My biggest fear before I had it done was the doctors said it was a big surgery because of the size, and I could bleed out quite a lot so might need to have a blood transfusion and stuff, which is fine.\n\n(Image: Kennedy News and Media)\n\n\"But he also said if he couldn't stop the bleeding I might have to have a full hysterectomy. That was my biggest fear. I was going through the surgery to have a baby, maybe in the future.\n\n\"Going through the surgery he was saying potentially it was a serious thing. But he was an amazing surgeon and the team were amazing.\n\n\"He said as long as you recover well you will still have those opportunities. That was the biggest relief.\n\n\"One thing at a time first though. I've got to fully recover before even thinking about those things.\n\n\"With how big the surgery was, I wouldn't be able to carry [a child] to full term. It's the muscle they've cut that would be the muscle that would be contracting [in labour], so you cannot allow the muscle to be contracting because that will rupture.\n\n\"There are those scary things to think about, but I just need to recover first before I think about those.\"\n\nNow Sophie is urging others with any lumps to get checked out if they have any unexplained lumps or show any symptoms of fibroids.\n\nSophie said: \"Just get checked, and don't be scared to get checked.\n\n(Image: Kennedy News and Media)\n\n\"I probably had this lump years and years ago but I didn't think anything of it. It didn't really bother me. I wasn't in pain.\n\n\"Sometimes I thought I had a bit of trapped wind or something, but I wasn't really bothered because it was quite small at the time.\n\n\"It didn't actually stick out. I'm quite chunky anyway so I never thought anything of it.\n\n\"When something doesn't really hurt you, you put it to the back of your mind and carry on as normal. You just ignore it.\n\n\"I don't like wasting people's time and I didn't think it was an emergency so you don't think anything of it.\n\n\"I woke up three or four times or even more times a night just to go to the toilet for a wee.\n\n\"But I drink so much water, so I never put it down to the lump before until they said that might be the reason why. I just thought it was quite normal.\n\n\"I had back pain but I work in an office chair and I drive a lot for my job, so you just put that to the back of your mind as well.\n\n\"Things like heavy periods are so subjective but it's really hard and quite a lot of women get that as well.\n\n\"Because we were thinking of starting a family and really struggling with it, I went to the doctor's and said I have a bit of a lump. They said, 'it's quite a big lump actually'.\"", "description": "WARNING GRAPHIC IMAGES Sophie Lee, 30, suffered back pain and a constant need to go to the toilet before she decided to visit a doctor about her symptoms", "authors": ["Jessica Cripps", "Neil Murphy", "Image", "Kennedy News", "Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20713185.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Kennedy-News-and-Media.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
