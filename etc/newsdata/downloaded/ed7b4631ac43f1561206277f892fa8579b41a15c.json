(AP) - Kyle Allen realized it was a monumental gamble to turn pro after his junior season of college, knowing he wouldn\u2019t be selected in the NFL draft.\n\nBut the Carolina Panthers improbable starting quarterback said it was chance he was willing to take.\n\n\u201cI was ready to bet on myself because I thought I had the ability,\u201d Allen said. \u201c\u2026 As an undrafted quarterback in this league, you have to keep betting on yourself because nobody else is going to.\u201d\n\nAllen will make his third NFL start on Sunday when the Panthers visit the Houston Texans. It is a meteoric rise for someone who failed make Carolina\u2019s opening day roster in 2018 and was without a job for seven weeks last season.\n\nBut an injury to franchise QB Cam Newton, an unwavering internal confidence and a knack for taking advantage of opportunities has thrust Allen into the spotlight in Carolina.\n\nHe\u2019s 2-0 as a starter, including a four-touchdown pass performance last Sunday in a 38-20 win over the Arizona Cardinals. That followed a Week 17 last season against the Saints after the Panthers had been eliminated from playoff contention.\n\nOn Sunday Allen electrified a team in dire need of a win after starting the season 0-2 at home with Newton at the helm. In a game where it felt like the season might be teetering on the brink, Allen completed 19 of 26 passes for 261 yards and finished with a QB rating of 144.4.\n\nAnd he made it look easy.\n\nBut nothing has been easy for Allen.\n\nThe No. 1-rated quarterback in the nation coming out of high school, Allen struggled in his first two seasons at Texas A&M; and was benched for Kyler Murray. He transferred to Houston, sat out one year and played three games as a junior before being benched again.\n\nOther players might have considered returning for a senior season or even transferring again.\n\nNot Allen.\n\n\u201cI knew going into (the draft) I was probably going to go undrafted,\u201d Allen said. \u201cI mean, I knew. I got benched the third week of the season. I\u2019m self-aware.\u201d\n\nThat meant signing a league minimum contract as a free agent.\n\nAllen made $56,470 in his brief stint with the Panthers last season after the team signed him to the 53-man roster late in the season, according to Spotrac. This year he\u2019s making $495,000, a far cry from Newton\u2019s average yearly salary of $20.7 million.\n\n\u201cGuys that succeed as undrafted free agents are those guys that do exude confidence,\u201d Panthers coach Ron Rivera said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the things that helps set him apart from guys when you watch him in practice. Just having watched him the last two training camps, you see it. He\u2019s got a lot of confidence in his own ability.\u201d\n\nAnd the determination.\n\nAllen said going undrafted is \u201cingrained\u201d in who he is as a person.\n\n\u201cUntil you keep proving yourself, it\u2019s a week-to-week thing,\u201d Allen said. \u201cYou have to show up every single day because you\u2019re not going to get as many opportunities as everybody else. I think it\u2019s shaped me.\u201d\n\nJake Delhomme can relate.\n\nDelhomme was also an undrafted quarterback who played seven seasons in Carolina, leading the team to its first Super Bowl in 2003 setting all sorts of franchise passing records along the way - most of which have since been broken by Newton.\n\n\u201cAs an undrafted quarterback, you have to keep at it because you aren\u2019t going to get the chances that a first-round pick is going to get,\u201d Delhomme said. \u201cThere\u2019s only one quarterback on the field and there\u2019s only one ball. You don\u2019t get many reps.\u201d\n\nDelhomme recalled something he learned from Tony Robichaux, the late baseball coach at his alma mater Louisiana Lafayette, who told him, \u201cYou have to work while you wait.\u201d\n\nHe said that means simulating plays and decisions in your head while other QBs take reps in practice and games.\n\n\u201cLook, you have to put in the time and if you\u2019re not ready when your number is called, you\u2019re going to get exposed,\u201d Delhomme said. \u201cAnd if you get exposed as an undrafted quarterback, you might not ever get another opportunity.\u201d\n\nAllen gets that.\n\nThat\u2019s why he\u2019s constantly studying film, and why trying to take advantage of this opportunity, knowing that once Newton returns from a mid-foot sprain he\u2019s expected to be the starter.\n\nBut for now, Allen will keep betting on himself.\n\nNOTES: Panthers outside linebacker Bruce Irvin is expected to see his first action of the season Sunday after missing the first three games with a hamstring injury. Cornerback Donte Jackson, who had two interceptions against Arizona, did not practice due to a groin injury.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Kyle Allen realized it was a monumental gamble to turn pro after his junior season of college, knowing he wouldn't be selected in the NFL draft.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steve Reed"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/24/young_quarterbacks_football_52261_c0-100-2400-1499_s1770x1032.jpg?c570a5b2757182622f78ee702b43ab425751dd7b", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
