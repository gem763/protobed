That was the biggest two-day rise since the financial crisis.\n\nThe pound has also risen 3.5 per cent against the euro since Johnson and his Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar indicated on Thursday afternoon that they could 'see a pathway to a possible deal'.\n\nBrexit hopes: Shares in British companies soared amid signs Boris Johnson is closing in on a deal with the European Union\n\nFurther talks in Brussels yesterday between Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay and the EU's chief negotiator were described as 'constructive'.\n\nThe European Commission said the two sides had now 'agreed to intensify discussions over the coming days' \u2013 raising hopes that a deal will be struck.\n\nShares in British companies soared with banks, builders and High Street retailers among the biggest risers.\n\nSome 25 stocks in the FTSE 350 made double-digit percentage gains with the FTSE 250 clocking up its biggest points rise of all time.\n\nIn a bullish note to clients, JP Morgan economist Malcolm Barr said: 'This changes everything.\n\n'We now expect a deal. For the first time, a UK exit from the EU on the basis of a withdrawal agreement within a matter of weeks now looks the single most likely path ahead.'\n\nHarry Adams, co-chief executive at currency firm Argentex, said further positive rhetoric around a deal could trigger 'a very aggressive rally' in sterling past $1.33 \u2013 and then to around $1.40 if an agreement is passed by Parliament.\n\n'However, analysts warned that the market rally could be reversed if hopes of a deal are dashed.\n\n'Sterling is only ever as good as the latest headline,' said Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe.\n\nA host of British stocks also soared higher.
