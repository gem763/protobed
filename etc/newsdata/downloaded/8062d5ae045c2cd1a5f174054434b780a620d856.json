(via Bstroy/via Bstroy Instagram)\n\nAt a fashion show in New York City this weekend, a tall model walked down a narrow runway flanked by streetwear devotees. He wore white-and-gold sneakers, khaki pants and a dark gray sweatshirt with the hood up. Across his chest, the word \u201cColumbine\u201d jumped out in embroidered white letters surrounded by ripped holes.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t alone. Three other models soon strutted the checkered floor, each wearing a hoodie tattered with bullet-like holes and embroidered with the names of the deadliest school shootings in American history.\n\nThe co-founder of the fashion label later explained he wanted to \u201cmake a comment on gun violence... while also empowering the survivors of tragedy.\u201d But instead, the show left victims and their families demanding the company shelve the line and apologize.\n\n\u201cThis is just absolutely horrific,\u201d the Vicki Soto Memorial Fund, which is managed by the family of a teacher who died in the Sandy Hook shooting, tweeted on Monday. \u201cA company is mak[ing] light of our pain and other\u2019s pain for fashion.\u201d\n\nThe sweatshirts, designed by streetwear brand Bstroy, reference shootings at Columbine High School, where 13 people were killed in 1999; Virginia Tech, where 32 people were killed in 2007; Sandy Hook Elementary School, where 26 people were killed in 2012; and Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where 17 people were killed in 2018.\n\nThe shirts first drew widespread attention on Sunday, after the brand\u2019s co-founder, Brick Owens, posted photos of the clothes on Instagram. By Tuesday afternoon, the posts had been inundated with criticisms from gun-violence survivors and victims\u2019 families.\n\n\u201cUnder what scenario could somebody think this was a good idea?\u201d tweeted Fred Guttenberg, whose daughter died in the Stoneman Douglas shooting. \u201cThis has me so upset.\u201d\n\nUnder what scenario could somebody think this was a good idea? This has me so upset. If any of my followers no anybody involved with this clothing line, please ask them to stop it immediately.https://t.co/VzAlog0TCt \u2014 Fred Guttenberg (@fred_guttenberg) September 17, 2019\n\nThe aunt of another student who died in the Parkland shooting told the company, \u201cYou should be ashamed of taking advantage of her death to make\" money.\n\n@bRicKOwens My 14 year old fashionista niece was murdered in Parkland. She was a professional illustrator and aspired to be clothing designer like you. You should be ashamed of taking advantage of her death to make \ud83d\udcb0 Today, I proudly wear her designs. pic.twitter.com/j8DZ8waROe \u2014 Shawn M Sherlock (@shawn_sherlock) September 17, 2019\n\nBstroy\u2019s co-founders, Owens and Dieter Grams, met on Myspace when both were teenagers and started their label in Atlanta in 2012. They gravitated toward designs that run dark. The brand once staged a fashion show in a funeral home, saying their clothes were designed for a post-apocalyptic world. They make Nikes dipped in concrete, jackets with two hoods and a pair of $1,000 \u201cdouble-edge\u201d jeans that look like two pairs of pants sewn together at the waists and ankles.\n\nThe company once ran a tagline on its site reading, \u201cBstroy is protected by pointed violence, psychological warfare and Art. All opposition should be organized at the risk of those endangered,\u201d according to the Internet Archive. The brand has sold T-shirts prominently featuring firearms, including preppy crew-necks with fencing teams and archers armed with assault rifles instead of foils and bows.\n\n\u201cWe are making violent statements,\u201d Grams, who publicly goes by Du, told the New York Times in a feature last week. \u201cThat\u2019s for you to know who we are, so we can have a voice in the market. But eventually that voice will say things that everyone can wear.\u201d\n\nBstroy isn\u2019t the first clothing company to catch heat for potentially profiting from school shootings. In 2014, Urban Outfitters was pilloried online for selling a faded Kent State University sweatshirt that appeared to be splattered with blood. Many observers thought the sweatshirt referenced the Ohio National Guard shooting and killing four students and injuring nine others there during a campus protest in 1970.\n\nBstroy did not immediately respond to a message late on Tuesday, but on Instagram, the company suggested the clothing line, called \u201cSamsara,\u201d was meant to be ironic.\n\n\u201cSometimes life can be painfully ironic,\u201d reads a card that features an artist\u2019s statement on the show. \u201cLike the irony of dying violently in a place you considered to be a safe, controlled environment, like school. We are reminded all the time of life\u2019s fragility, shortness, and unpredictability, yet we are also reminded of its infinite potential.\u201d\n\nOwens elaborated on his thinking in an email sent to the \u201cToday\u201d show.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to make a comment on gun violence and the type of gun violence that needs preventative attention and what its origins are, while also empowering the survivors of tragedy through storytelling in the clothes,\u201d the designer wrote.\n\nHe also suggested that the harsh response to the sweatshirts was rooted in prejudice, because both he and Grams are black men in their late 20s.\n\n\u201cAlso built into the device is the fact that our image as young, black males has not been traditionally awarded credit for introducing avant-garde ideas,\u201d Owens wrote. \u201cSo many people have assumed our message to be lazy just because of what they\u2019ve been taught about black men. These hoodies were made with all of these intentions in mind, and to explore all of these societal issues.\u201d\n\nAlthough the company\u2019s early statements indicated that the sweatshirts were created as an art piece for the show and weren\u2019t meant to be sold, Bstroy now says it is considering putting them up for sale.\n\n\u201cThe hoodies have only been shown not sold and the school shooting hoodies were initially intended to be just for the show and not to sell but that may change now,\u201d the company told The Cut.\n\nCritics suggested that making money off the line would be an insult to survivors.\n\n\u201cSo offensive!!\u201d tweeted Christine Pelosi, a Democratic National Committee official and the daughter of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in response to Guttenberg\u2019s post. \u201cRevolted to see bstroy monetize your pain.\u201d", "description": "Atlanta-born fashion label Bstroy debuted the controversial sweatshirts at a fashion show in New York.", "authors": ["Katie Shepherd", "Morning Mix Reporter", "September At Am", "Katie Shepherd Is A Reporter On The Washington Post'S Morning Mix Team.
