A former pupil, using the name Edward, said he had been told that Aldo, who died in 1980, had been \u2018killed\u2019\n\nAs an adult, Edward told the Marist Brothers, who ran St Columba\u2019s, about his own ordeal - and claimed the order had urged him not to tell the police.\n\nRecounting his time at St Columba\u2019s, Edward said he was seven or eight when \u2018vicious\u2019 McKell targeted him for sexual abuse on about \u2018two dozen\u2019 occasions.\n\nHe tried to run away in around 1964 or 1965 because he was living in \u2018absolute fear and horror\u2019 of the paedophile brother.\n\nEdward said he would be taken from his bed by McKell \u2018in the dead of night\u2019, and forced to take part in a bizarre ritual which involved climbing up to retrieve a black leather bag from a loft.\n\nWhen he came back down, McKell would tell him he was dirty and instruct him to take off his pyjamas and get into a bath, before sexually abusing him \u2013 and hitting him if he cried out.\n\nEdward, who described St Columba\u2019s as a \u2018cesspit\u2019, said: \u2018I was crying and that was not pleasing him, you would get an extra slap for crying.\u2019\n\nHe told the inquiry: \u2018I would describe myself as being zombified\u2026 I wasn\u2019t able to speak.\u2019\n\nRecounting his time at St Columba\u2019s, Edward said he was seven or eight when \u2018vicious\u2019 McKell targeted him for sexual abuse on about \u2018two dozen\u2019 occasions.

McKell died in 1998.\n\nEdward said Mr McEwan had told him: \u2018Do not phone the police\u2019, as he insisted the order would do it on his behalf.\n\nBut Edward said he later found out police were never told.\n\nThe inquiry, before Lady Smith, continues.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: An inquiry heard of Aldo Moroni's 'punishment' at the hands of Brother Germanus - real name David McKell.
