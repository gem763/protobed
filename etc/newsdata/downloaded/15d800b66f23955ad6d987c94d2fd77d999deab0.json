But given the stretched financial situation at the RFU \u2014 their most recent accounts revealed an annual loss of \u00a330.9m \u2014 England have let money talk and gone with the highest bidder.\n\nUmbro, founded in Cheshire in 1924, are a brand with relatively little history in rugby but are synonymous with football.\n\nBobby Moore lifted the World Cup in 1966 in a shirt made by Umbro, who, at their peak, equipped 85 per cent of the clubs in the Football League.

Umbro called out their rivals for using an almost identical pattern to the one they had prepared for the 2010 Peter Saville-designed England football shirt.\n\nA Canterbury spokesperson said: 'We continuously review our commercial partnership arrangements.'", "description": "EXCLUSIVE BY NIK SIMON: Umbro have agreed a shock multi-million-pound deal to take over as England's official kit manufacturer next season.", "authors": ["Nik Simon For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/21/19342832-0-image-a-23_1570308501817.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
