You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe body positivity advocate stated she wants to be \u201cconscious of not contributing to fast fashion because of how wasteful it is\u201d.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s either that or I run around naked. Plus-size fashion is not there yet,\u201d Holliday said.\n\nFast fashion culture involves shoppers regularly buying cheap clothes, which they then wear on a small number of occasions before discarding.\n\nBuying new clothes on a frequent basis can have a damaging effect on the environment, due in part to the quantity of clothing which ends up in the landfill and the carbon emissions which are produced when clothing is transported around the world.\n\nAccording to a study recently released by global poverty charity Oxfam, while three in 10 people are shocked by the detrimental impact fast fashion has on the environment, they would be reluctant to change their shopping habits.\n\nMeanwhile, one in 10 people said they are \u201cnot bothered\u201d at all about how their shopping habits may cause damage to the environment.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
