I want to fight to keep my place and help the team.\u201d\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nGerman boss Tuchel also left Edinson Cavani on the bench in Belgium, with Neymar also absent, both injured and completing a three-match suspension.\n\nAs such, his decision to treat Mbappe, who has already missed a month of the season due to injury, with kid\u2019s gloves, was understandable.\n\nThe World Cup winner only appeared for 13 minutes on his comeback in the weekend win at Nice, scoring at the Allianz Riviera, where he hugged his coach before entering the fray; there was no similar embrace in Belgium.\n\nMbappe admits being frustrated by his spell on the sidelines and is in a rush to make up for lost time.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\n\"Football is my passion, it's been two months that I could not play and I found that very frustrating,\" said Mbappe. \"But I thank the medical staff, they took good care of me.\n\n\"I want to play every game, resume the pace and score goals. I want to go back to being 100 per cent.\"\n\nOn the victory, Tuchel offered: \"It's an extraordinary result, because I'm convinced it's always very difficult to win a Champions League game.\n\n\"It was hard until we scored the second goal. That gave us confidence and we won the ball back more.\n\n\"Kylian coming off the bench did us good, but we mustn't forget the work done for 60 minutes before that.\"", "description": "Mbappe scored a 21-minute treble in PSG's Champions League win over Genk, having been left on the bench", "authors": ["Alex Richards", "Image", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20704914.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Champions-League-Group-A-Club-Brugge-v-Paris-St-Germain.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
