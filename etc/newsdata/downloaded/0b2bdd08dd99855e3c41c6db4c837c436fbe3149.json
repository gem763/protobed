We may,\u201d Trump told reporters on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews, en route to an event in Chicago.\n\n\u201cWe may take certain parts of it and release it, yes,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president described the ISIS chief\u2019s demise in cinematic and grisly terms during an address from the White House on Sunday announcing the overnight raid\u2019s success, employing vivid rhetoric that some critics deemed gratuitous.\n\n\u201cHe died like a coward. He was whimpering, screaming and crying,\u201d Trump said, adding that Baghdadi and \u201cthe losers\u201d under his command \u201cwere very frightened puppies.\u201d\n\nTrump even likened his real-time monitoring of the mission to \u201cwatching a movie,\u201d although the overhead surveillance feeds he was viewing during the raid could not display what was happening in the underground tunnel where Baghdadi killed himself \u2014 nor the sounds he was making at the time of his death, according to a report by The New York Times.\n\nTrump\u2019s disclosure of various sensitive details regarding the long-planned assault by Army Delta Force commandos also provoked alarm among veterans of previous operations who worry the president\u2019s remarks could imperil future raids and intelligence gathering.", "description": "The IS leader died \u2018whimpering, screaming and crying,\u2019 says US president.", "authors": ["Quint Forgey", "Nahal Toosi", "Wesley Morgan", "Peter R.
