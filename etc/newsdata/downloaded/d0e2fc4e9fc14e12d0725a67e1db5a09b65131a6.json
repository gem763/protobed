He paid homage to Lee for kick-starting the Marvel legacy, calling him a \u201cgenius.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was enthused with humanity and kindness,\u201d said Feige, who did not attend the ceremony but spoke on a large video screen. \u201cHe put that into every creation he had, which is why they all still resonate today. It will resonate for centuries to come.\u201d\n\nFeige was recognized for the successful creation of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), a film world with multiple story lines and characters that so far has spanned 23 films over 11 years. The latest phase of the franchise triumphantly concluded with the record-breaking \u201cAvengers: Endgame\u201d film, which took home multiple awards including best comic-to-motion picture release.\n\nThe awards show was simulcast for the first time on several platforms including its official YouTube channel, Twitch, Cinedigm\u2019s CONtv and Pluto TV Sci-Fi Channel.\n\nAisha Tyler hosted the event, created in 1973 to recognize horror, sci-fi and fantasy films that typically don\u2019t get recognized at major award shows. The awards were presented at the Avalon Hollywood venue in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cIron Man\u201d and \u201cLion King\u201d director Jon Favreau and Marvel\u2019s head of television Jeph Loeb also received honorary awards. Favreau was handed the Saturn Visionary award for his work in modern cinema, while Loeb was given the Dan Curtis Legacy award, which highlights the accomplishments in genre television.\n\nFavreau remembered when he first saw a Saturn Award while visiting Feige\u2019s office years ago. He also spoke about the progression of superhero films along with sci-fi and fantasy genres.\n\n\u201cAt the time, people weren\u2019t really recognizing superhero films or genre films. Now, we\u2019re a part of mainstream,\u201d Favreau said. \u201cNow horror, superheroes and sci-fi have become a part of what keeps the film business going. But way back when I was growing up, it was a small group in the lunch room that liked that kind of stuff. \u2026 It\u2019s so amazing how this has blossomed.\u201d\n\nLoeb said his father\u2019s colorful stories of his workday during his childhood encouraged him to become a storyteller.\n\n\u201cHe told a story about going to the post office. But in my mind, he was Indiana Jones meets Jesse James,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was a stockbroker for 37 years, but he made me want to be a storyteller. \u2026 They say in this business don\u2019t meet your heroes. You\u2019ll find out they\u2019re just mortals. But I have and they\u2019re in this room. They\u2019re in my office and on my sets.\u201d\n\n\u201cHalloween\u201d star Jamie Lee Curtis received a standing ovation after winning best actress in a 2018 film. The actress isn\u2019t a huge fan of horror films but said she was grateful that her role in the first \u201cHalloween,\u201d in 1978, help kick-start her career.\n\n\u201cI never, ever, ever thought I would be an actress,\u201d Curtis said.\n\nRobert Downey Jr. won best actor for his work in \u201cAvengers: Endgame.\u201d\n\nGeorge Takei, the \u201cStar Trek\u201d actor, called himself an \u201cO.G. nerd\u201d before announcing HBO\u2019s \u201cWestworld\u201d as the winner for best science fiction television series.\n\n\u201cSupergirl\u201d star Melissa Benoist accepted the award for the CW show, which won best superhero television series.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Kevin Feige was honored at the 45th annual Saturn Awards but the Marvel Studios president gave higher praise to someone other than himself.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jonathan Landrum Jr."], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/13/saturn_awards_21862_c0-170-3770-2368_s1770x1032.jpg?d19294575593aba4de5a0cd2aa53a21965783d2e", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
