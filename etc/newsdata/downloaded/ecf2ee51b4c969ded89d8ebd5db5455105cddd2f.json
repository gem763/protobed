A born and bred New Yorker, McCalmon thought of grad school as an opportunity to take a short detour from her hometown. But the more research she did, the more she realized that, as a media and advertising executive climbing the ladder at publishing powerhouses, the uptown Ivy offered the kind of curriculum, mentorship, and community that matched her aspirations.\n\n\"My Columbia application was my best application ever,\" McCalmon told Business Insider. She spent months perfecting her essays, spoke with countless members of the Columbia community, and meticulously prepared for interviews. But in the end, she believed that it was the fact that she knew exactly what she wanted out of the experience that helped her land a coveted spot in the Columbia Business School class of 2019: \"They want to know how you are going to show up at the school,\" McCalmon reflected.\n\nMichael Robinson, the director of admissions at Columbia Business School, affirmed that point during a recent interview with Business Insider. \"In the end, we want people who are going to add value to our community, and you can't really add value without knowing the community, taking the time to immerse yourself, and asking: 'Is this the right thing for me, given what I want to do?'\" he explained.\n\nRemembering his own application process, Steve Guerrini, class of 2015, explained that he would advise anyone considering Columbia to really understand what the school is all about and the community on campus. \"Even if you have an amazing GMAT score, I'm sure admissions can tell when someone puts together a formulaic application,\" he said. But you have to think to yourself, he added: \"How am I speaking the language of the school? How do I use the same words and really reflect the community? Everything has to be personal about this, when you think about how much it changes your professional life and network.\"\n\nSteve Guerrini. Courtesy of Steve Guerrini\n\nOf course, if you're contemplating business school in the first place, excellence is likely a key criterion: Columbia Business School is ranked number six in terms of top business schools by U.S. News and World Report and number seven in Bloomberg Businessweek, and 94% of the class of 2018 received job offers within three months of graduation.\n\nRead on to learn more about the best way to go about applying to CBS \u2014 and how to avoid the most common errors candidates make year after year.\n\nShow leadership potential and engagement with the CBS community\n\nRobinson has been a member of the Columbia Business School community for nearly 20 years, initially as a student himself before becoming an administrator. In all that time, he reflected, the characteristics of good candidates have remained consistent: \"We're looking for the kind of person who has the potential to be an impactful, transformational leader,\" he said.\n\nAdmissions admittedly doesn't have a crystal ball for spotting these individuals, but they have developed some telling criteria. For example, explained Robinson, if a candidate was brought into a firm with a cohort, they'll ask: Were they promoted faster than their peers? Were they given more key assignments and high-profile projects from senior leaders? Do they work well in a team-focused environment?\n\n\"When I read your recommendation, [and] it's from an expert practitioner who is your boss, does that person say: 'I've been in this space for 10 to 20 years, [and] this is why I think she has the potential to be a leader in the future because this is what I've seen her do'?\" he said. You want to have galvanized support through a consistent demonstration of skills, while standing out as a star.\n\nMichael Robinson. Courtesy of Michael Robinson\n\nAnother aspect of a successful application has to do with engagement with the CBS community: Knowing the school and having a clear sense of why they want to be there, as McCalmon did, is key. Students might build that relationship with Columbia in person, or, in the case of international applicants, the process may happen online. \"They're on the virtual platform, they're engaging with people on the team, they're watching webinars, sending emails to our admissions ambassadors,\" said Robinson of the ideal candidate, who also encouraged potential students to dig into the school's MBA YouTube page.\n\nDon't underestimate the value of making connections within the community during the application process, either. \"By the time I was applying to CBS, I'd gone to a number of events, met with admissions officers, [and] spoken to current students and alums, so I knew how to map my career-to-date and interests onto what I wanted to get from and contribute to CBS across academics, career, and community,\" said McCalmon. By the time she arrived on campus, she had already made connections \u2014 a factor that helped her hit the ground running.\n\nRemember that test scores aren't everything \u2014 seriously\n\nThe currently enrolled class at CBS has a median GMAT score of around 730. But, according to Robinson, there are people in the class every year whose scores fall in the 500s, and room for the fact that some people just test poorly due to anxiety or other mitigating factors, including access to prep resources. (At the same time, he encouraged those wondering how they compare to the current and past student body to dig into Columbia's class profiles. \"If the school has never admitted someone who had a GPA in the 1.0s, that might be tough,\" he said.)\n\n\"Many people think you have to have the perfect application. But CBS means it when they say they look at applicants holistically,\" added Brad Boone, class of 2020. He first started considering business school while waiting to receive final clearance from the military. Originally, he struggled to find a program that stood out, before speaking with another veteran who was at Columbia at the time. Connecting with her helped him realize it was the right place for him.\n\nThis isn't to say that scores don't matter at all \u2014 or that prepping for the GMAT is something applicants can afford to take lightly. \"Definitely [don't] underestimate the challenge \u2014 especially the math component,\" said Guerrini. \"That part is really competitive. It's something people need to spend a lot of time on.\"\n\nBrad Boone. Courtesy of Brad Boone\n\nThe bottom line, said Robinson, is that \"because our school is very global, context matters.\" One key question that goes into evaluating potential students is: \"Do we have real evidence that this person is going to be okay in the classroom?\" Another is: \"Does this person have the potential to be an impactful leader going forward?\"\n\nIf you tend to test badly, considering taking the Executive Assessment exam, a variation on the GMAT. Reach out to an admissions advisor early on in the process to discuss your specific questions and concerns about your application \u2014 that's what they are there for. \"Look at all the options so that when you apply, you're applying with your best self,\" said Robinson.\n\nPrepare for a lengthy process, and capitalize on rolling admissions\n\nWhen you think of \"cramming,\" the time span of three months probably doesn't leap to mind \u2014 but Robinson said that's the minimum amount of time to set aside for the process.\n\n\"The majority of candidates on the shorter side [take] about six months to 18 months, [and] up to two years\" to prepare to apply to CBS (or any business school for that matter), he said. If it's more of an issue of, \"What school do I choose?\" rather than \"Should I even do this?\" the trajectory can be shorter. \"But if you're starting from scratch, I would recommend nine months to a year,\" he said.\n\nIt's also important to understand the decision process itself, which differs depending on the school. \"Columbia has a rolling admissions, which means we read and review applications in the order that we get them \u2014 so, all things being equal, the earlier one applies, the better [their] chance,\" Robinson explained. If someone with a weak element on their profile wanted to maximize their chances of being admitted, Robinson would also encourage that person to at least explore early admission: \"That's when we have the most space possible, and when we're willing to take a risk, because it's wide open.\"\n\nUnderstand what financial support Columbia offers\n\nWhile students finance their MBA in a variety of ways, from loans to corporate sponsorship to scholarships and beyond, Robinson explained that Columbia awards funding from two buckets.\n\nThe first is merit-based and controlled by admissions, which looks at criteria that includes both academic and leadership potential. The people who receive this funding are \"like the stars within the stars,\" Robinson said. They're also on top of deadlines: Applications are due in January.\n\nNeed-based awards are controlled by the financial aid office and based on your tax information. \"Your goal is to maximize the merit piece and the need-based piece so you're using less of your own savings and loans to pay for those things,\" advised Robinson.\n\nFor McCalmon, financial aid was paramount. \"I wouldn't have been able to attend school without it,\" she said, adding that she ended up receiving both merit and need-based scholarships to attend Columbia.\n\nAvoid the mistake candidates make every single year\n\n\"We really want people who have been thoughtful, who know themselves, who have done the real research and due diligence,\" said Robinson. The most common mistake he sees, year after year, is easily avoided.\n\n\"Say someone has a top choice school and they say to themselves: All the big schools in the top 10 are the same, so I'm going to force my essays for School A into School B in order to be efficient,\" said Robinson. \"Every single year we have a number of essays that may have passed spell check but have another school instead of [Columbia] written as where they really wanted to go.\"\n\nThe lesson? If you really want to stand out, tailor your materials to CBS specifically, and watch out for minor errors that give away your lack of hard work.\n\nAnd if at first you don't succeed \u2026 try again\n\nRejection: It's a bummer. But not getting in once doesn't mean that you're out of the game for good.\n\n\"So many people outside the process think it's a simple, binary thing, but it's really hard\" to get into business school, said Robinson. \"The majority of people who apply are qualified to be in the program. If we admitted them, they would pass all the classes, do well, get a great job post-MBA. Sometimes it's just a matter of space and time.\" In other words: If CBS is really the place for you, maybe next time you'll have a greater shot of getting in.
