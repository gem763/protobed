Something to suit all vibes and tastes. Here\u2019s THE LIST.\n\n\n\nTayer and Elementary\n\nThis new spot on Old Street serves what just might be our favourite cocktail list in London right now. The ingredients are bang on trend and it\u2019s no surprise given that Alex Kratena, formerly of The Artisian when it was named best bar in the world, is behind the drinks. The menu switches frequently depending on seasonal ingredients but we\u2019ve enjoyed everything from Rhubarb and White Peach highballs to Watermelon negronis. Plus there\u2019s those katsu sandos courtesy of TATA Eatery to soak up the booze.\n\nSeabird\n\nPerched on the 14th floor of The Hoxton, Southwark Seabird is a collaboration with Premier Enterprises, the team behind NYC\u2019s Maison Premiere, a consistent award winner and on the World\u2019s 50 Best Bars list. As you\u2019d expect there\u2019s a serious cocktail list, alongside the biggest selection of oysters in London (and you know what they say about oysters), plus killer views of the city. Our favourite cocktail is the Toucan, served in a glass shaped like a bird alongside never-ending puns. Toucan do what after dinner? That part is up to you!\n\nWave Bar, Park Chinois\n\nStepping inside Park Chinois feels like you\u2019ve been transported to a film set. It\u2019s one of the most glitzy places in London \u2013 no penny was spared on these interiors. Wave Bar is a sexy spot in the basement and like the food and decor, most of the drinks have an Asian spin or an OTT element like the truffle Old Fashioned or Yuzu Levant. If a date brings you here, they are most definitely a keeper.\n\nAmerican Bar, The Stafford\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for somewhere with old school charm and you\u2019ve just been paid (or found yourself a generous date) the American Bar at the five-star hotel The Stafford is a good choice, as it feels a little more clubhouse than stuffy cocktail bar. The American Dream menu is based around those who achieved the American dream through history. The Raven is our fave \u2013 whisky infused with peanut butter, maple syrup and chocolate bitters.\n\nCub\n\nThis super cool spot gets a place on our list due to its sustainability creds, not to mention the insta-friendly decor and innovative cocktails. Hidden on Hoxton Street it\u2019s a great place to take a first date because it\u2019s an education on waste ingredients that should give you enough fodder to keep talking all night \u2013 even on the driest date.\n\nEve\n\nWe love bars that experiment with flavours and combos, but the drinks have to taste good. Eve is one of those spots that manages to create all kinds of crazy, delicious drinks including a couple which use the restaurants leftover waste and what just might be the best Espresso Martini in London. Then there\u2019s the bar snacks \u2013 cheese donuts and crab kimchi tarts. Bloody brilliant.\n\nDiscount Suit Company\n\nDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019re not suggesting you have your first date whilst getting fitted for a knock down priced suit for your wedding day. Talk about jumping the gun! This basement cocktail bar still has its shop frontage but there are no suits inside. It\u2019s dark, sexy and the drinks are strong. The kinda place you go for one and end up been kicked out at closing time.\n\nThis list was created by London lifestyle website London On The Inside.\n\nJoin Guardian Soulmates today and start planning your cocktail date.", "description": "It's London Cocktail week, so we've teamed up with London lifestyle website London On The Inside who have selected their favourite cocktail bars in London.
