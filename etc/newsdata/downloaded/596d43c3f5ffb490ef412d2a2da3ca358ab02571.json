The 36-year-old backrower will join his former teammate Mauro Bergamasco and ex-Samoa midfielder Brian Lima as the only players to compete in five Rugby World Cups when he leads Italy out against Namibia in a Pool B game on Sunday at Hanazono Rugby Stadium.\n\nParisse\u2019s career highlights are a testament to his longevity in the rough-and-tumble sport. The match against No 23-ranked Namibia will be his 141st cap, moving him level with Ireland\u2019s Brian O\u2019Driscoll in second place on the all-time list, seven behind former New Zealand captain Richie McCaw\u2019s record for most international appearances.\n\nRugby World Cup tactics: Nick Evans on how the leading nations will play Read more\n\nBut there\u2019s a lingering statistic that he wants to improve. The Italians have never progressed out of the pool stage at the Rugby World Cup, and the prospects this time are daunting in a group containing defending champion New Zealand and South Africa which have a combined five titles Namibia and Canada. The Italians have lost eight of their nine tests in 2019 the only win coming against No. 20-ranked Russia and are 1-2 in head-to-heads with Namibia, although the two losses were in 1991.\n\nParisse made his World Cup debut against New Zealand as far back as 2003, when he was still a teenager, and played four games at each of his first three World Cups. Injuries restricted him to just one start four years ago in England.\n\n\u201cThe fifth I hope it will be my best,\u201d Parisse said on Friday. \u201cThe first World Cup was a huge match and I will never forget my first try against Canada in 2003. The 2007 edition in France left me the most disappointed, as we had a really good chance of qualifying for the quarter-finals but we lost to Scotland.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m nearer the end of my career than the start, I\u2019m aware of this, but I\u2019m not going to start thinking about it. It is something to be proud of, but my main aim is to think about helping the squad.\u201d\n\nItaly\u2019s coach, Conor O\u2019Shea, said Parisse\u2019s influence on the squad was invaluable. He is probably the best Italian rugby player of all time,\u201d O\u2019Shea said. \u201cHe never thinks about himself, only about the team. Maybe it is his last World Cup. I hope for him and the rest of the squad that it is his best.\u201d", "description": "Sergio Parisse\u2019s run at the Rugby World Cup has been more like a marathon than a sprint", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c9ad7a6026d129113788c709fee70816487095c/0_37_3138_1883/master/3138.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b7950819e3cf72c7cda81a391cd19a22", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
