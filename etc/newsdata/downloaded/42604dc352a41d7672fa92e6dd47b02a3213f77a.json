I\u2019m so shocked\u2026not.\n\nI\u2019ve not met a high-horse rider yet who doesn\u2019t eventually tumble off into a pit of shameless hypocrisy.\n\nBut I\u2019ve got to hand it to Trudeau, when he fell, he really FELL.\n\nFor a guy so keen to paint himself as the male Mother Teresa, the revelation that he has literally painted himself to appropriate non-white skin color is a bombshell from which I doubt he will ever recover.\n\nTrudeau had attended an \u2018Arabian Nights\u2019 party in a turban and with his face painted dark brown\n\n\u2018I shouldn\u2019t have done that,\u2019 a stern, ashen Trudeau said in an impromptu news conference aboard his campaign plane last night. A second picture from the same night is seen above\n\nTrudeau said on his plane: \u2018I take responsibility for it. It was a dumb thing to do. I\u2019m disappointed in myself. I\u2019m p****d-off at myself for having done it. I wish I hadn\u2019t done it but I did and I apologize for it. I should have known better but I didn\u2019t'\n\nBecause like all holier-than-thou preachers caught with their metaphorical trousers down, Trudeau\u2019s whole USP just crashed and burned.\n\nUntil yesterday, this guy was the very epitome of liberal self-righteousness, a caring, sharing bundle of worthy concern.\n\nNow he\u2019s been forced to admit he\u2019s the thing his fans despise most - a racist.\n\nOr rather, he says he WAS a racist but isn\u2019t any more.\n\nIn an impromptu news conference aboard his campaign plane last night, Trudeau responded to a report by TIME magazine and admitted it was indeed him pictured in \u2018brownface\u2019 in a yearbook from West Point Grey Academy.\n\nHe had attended an \u2018Arabian Nights\u2019 party in a turban and with his face painted dark brown.\n\n\u2018I shouldn\u2019t have done that,\u2019 a stern, ashen Trudeau said. \u2018I take responsibility for it. It was a dumb thing to do. I\u2019m disappointed in myself. I\u2019m p****d-off at myself for having done it. I wish I hadn\u2019t done it but I did and I apologize for it. I should have known better but I didn\u2019t.\u2019\n\nSo far, so predictably self-flagellating; Trudeau knows the only way out of this Grand Canyon sized hole he\u2019s in is to beat himself up.\n\nBut there are two problems with his statement.\n\nFirst, he wasn\u2019t a young student at the time of his Arabian Nights\u2019 brownface stunt - he was a 29-year-old teacher.\n\nPressed to disclose if there were other incidents like this, Trudeau admitted to wearing \u2018blackface\u2019 at a high school talent show, where he sang \u201cDay-O\u201d, the song made famous by black singer and civil rights campaigner Harry Belafonte\n\nAnd a few hours later, a third incident emerged in which he was seen with blackface in a video, apparently from the \u2018early 1990s\u2019 - laughing, pulling faces and sticking his tongue out\n\nAnd this wasn\u2019t 1951, it was 2001, so the explanation that a man of nearly thirty had no idea that painting his face brown to an Arabian Nights party might be racist doesn\u2019t fly, especially as TIME reports he was the ONLY person there in brownface.\n\nSecond, it wasn\u2019t his only venture into the face-painting arena.\n\nPressed to disclose if there were other incidents like this, Trudeau admitted to wearing \u2018blackface\u2019 at a high school talent show, where he sang \u201cDay-O\u201d, the song made famous by black singer and civil rights campaigner Harry Belafonte.\n\nSure enough, CBS News soon located a photo of him performing at that show in blackface.\n\nAnd a few hours later, a third incident emerged in which he was seen with blackface in a video, apparently from the \u2018early 1990s\u2019 - laughing, pulling faces and sticking his tongue out.\n\nSo Trudeau\u2019s a serial offender, and I would imagine yet more embarrassing images will soon be unraveled as the media swarm over this growing scandal.\n\nThe timing is particularly damaging because Trudeau is facing an election in several weeks time.\n\nBut the far greater damage is to his carefully honed reputation as Mr Progressive, the great defender of multiculturalism and racial tolerance.\n\nAs the Prime Minister himself conceded last night, this kind of racist face-painting is \u2018a significant thing that is very hurtful\u2019 to \u2018communities and people who live with intersectionalities and face discrimination.\u2019\n\nMustafa Farooq, executive director of the National Council of Canadian Muslims, said: \u2018Seeing the Prime Minister in brownface/blackface is deeply saddening. The wearing of blackface/brownface is reprehensible and hearkens back to a history of racism which is unacceptable.\u2019\n\nYes it is.\n\nBut as pressure piles up on Trudeau, he steadfastly refuses to resign.\n\nAnd by insisting it\u2019s not a resignation matter, he lays himself open to the charge of stunning hypocrisy.\n\nBecause we all know how he would have responded if one of his rivals was caught in this situation \u2013 he\u2019d take the high moral ground, an area that frankly he rarely leaves, and furiously demand their head on a plate.\n\nAnd we also know exactly how his supporters would have responded too.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen in America how incensed liberals get over blackface.\n\nNBC star Megyn Kelly was banished from the airwaves last year after musing that it didn\u2019t used to be deemed offensive to do it on Halloween.\n\nKelly never actually blackfaced herself, but that didn\u2019t matter as she became the sacrificial lamb to a howling mob of outraged liberals who\u2019d never forgiven her for working at Fox News.\n\nI detest the modern cancel culture.\n\nIt perfectly exemplifies the hysterically over-the-top reaction to everything by largely snowflake millennials who want anyone they disagree with to be obliterated.\n\nI particularly detest the rank hypocrisy of those who practice cancel culture. The same high profile liberals who demanded Kelly\u2019s head on a plate are not doing the same with Trudeau, even though he repeatedly did the very thing she only talked about.\n\nThey are all lining up to praise his \u2018honesty\u2019, and his \u2018sincere apology.\u2019\n\nThis, we\u2019re assured, is a very much a \u2018teachable moment\u2019 that he should survive.\n\nHmmm.\n\nIt\u2019s not \u2018honest\u2019 to keep this blackface habit a secret for two decades until the press uncovers it.\n\nAnd as for sincere apologies and teachable moments, Megyn Kelly made an abject tearful mea culpa on air and it made zero difference to the mob.\n\nNBC star Megyn Kelly was banished from the airwaves last year after musing that it didn\u2019t used to be deemed offensive to do it on Halloween\n\nKelly never actually blackfaced herself, but that didn\u2019t matter as she became the sacrificial lamb to a howling mob of outraged liberals who\u2019d never forgiven her for working at Fox News\n\nThe only lesson she got was that there\u2019s one rule for conservatives on such matters, and quite another for liberals.\n\nCan you even begin to imagine how the same people defending Trudeau today would react if this was Donald Trump who\u2019d been caught wearing blackface.\n\nThey would want him instantly hounded out of office.\n\nYet because it\u2019s nice-guy Justin, the one who REALLY cares, he gets a pass.\n\nWell sorry, but the double standard absolutely stinks.\n\nJustin Trudeau\u2019s feeling shame-faced and red-faced over his brownface and blackface.\n\nBut it\u2019s his barefaced hypocrisy that should render his position untenable.\n\nLive by the woke cancel culture, die by it.", "description": "Justin Trudeau, the Prime Minister of Canada and arguably the most woke, virtue-signalling and PC-crazed leader in the history of Mankind turns out to have a rather cracked halo?", "authors": ["Piers Morgan For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/19/18/18683764-0-image-a-6_1568913743804.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
