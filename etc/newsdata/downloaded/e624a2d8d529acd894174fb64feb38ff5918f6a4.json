You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nDuchesses and princes, religious leaders and travellers, authors and scientists, entrepreneurs and athletes have all had and have their huge followings. Many have used that fame to earn a crust (or maybe a whole breadbasket) through sponsorships, partnerships and associations.\n\nNone of this is new. But today\u2019s influencers have upped their game. The rules of engagement haven\u2019t changed but the speed of that engagement has, according to leading psychologists.\n\nWhen once us mere mortals would have gone out to search the hillsides for the same feather a leading light of Georgian society had in their hat according to a newspaper a month old, today we click the Amazon Prime link included in their Insta post from five seconds ago. The shoes, tech or airline tickets could be in your hands the same day, maybe even the same hour.\n\nThat instant gratification, that hit of dopamine that fades as fast as it arrives, can and regularly does spell financial disaster long after the Insta king or queen has moved on to the next \u201cmust have\u201d.\n\nBut the average single post by the world\u2019s top Instagrammers contains \u00a36,700 of luxury items. With one in three of the under-40s aspiring to live the influencer lifestyle, according to research by fintech business CreditKarma, they\u2019d need an annual salary of \u00a31.7m to achieve it. Or \u00a33.1m if you include the vehicles on display.\n\nReal or not, Generation Z-ers and millennials collectively spend \u00a3400m every month imitating the stars of social media. Around 70 per cent are going into debt to do it. Others say so-called \u201csocial spending\u201d is affecting their saving, including hindering long-term goals like buying a house, as well as their ability to cover everyday costs.\n\nJo Hemmings, a behavioural psychologist who specialises in celebrity culture, warns that it\u2019s especially hard to see through the smoke and mirrors to decide what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not on social media. \u201cIt\u2019s essential to remember that posting about expensive items and lavish lifestyles is a full-time job for many social media influencers. Many of these \u2018social celebrities\u2019 have either been gifted these items or have been paid to promote them. You can see whether there is formal promotion behind a post by looking at the hashtags \u2013 influencers often reference #Ad at the bottom of a post. Others on Instagram have a disclaimer at the top that says \u2018paid partnership\u2019.\u201d\n\nShe suggests that we gravitate towards those with similar values whom we see as authentic. We buy items related to those people, endorsed by those people as a validation, not just of the items we own or places we\u2019ve been but who we are. And all that costs money.\n\n\u201cWhen people buy the items being displayed on social media the values of each item often aren\u2019t that much, but cumulatively, it becomes a lot of money,\u201d Hemmings adds.\n\nWhen it comes to luxury goods in particular though, part of the satisfaction of buying seems to be about setting yourself up as a special member of your particular tribe.\n\nSeparate research from Hitachi Personal Finance released this week suggests that four in 10 UK adults prefer to buy expensive items rather than cheaper alternatives, but not simply because of the perceived or real quality of the item itself. In fact, the same proportion of people would buy an expensive item when lower priced alternatives were available because they know \u201cnot everyone could afford them\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, the UK\u2019s record personal debt levels keep on spiralling upwards.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s vital we cut through the noise and look at the important facts when discussing debt,\u201d says John Ellmore, director of comparison site Know Your Money. \u201cThat 69 per cent of under-40s have some form of debt is not surprising \u2013 indeed, our own research shows that 70 per cent of all UK adults are in debt.\n\n\u201cWhat is important is that people feel in control of their debt, and unfortunately a quarter of consumers say this isn\u2019t the case. Feeling out of control of your debt, which can result from taking on too much debt or not first considering repayment plans, can lead to significant mental health problems. We must ensure support and education is provided so people only take on responsible, manageable debt; in turn, this will help us break the taboo surrounding the subject and prevent debt being treated as a dirty word.\u201d\n\nSo where does the Insta generation \u2013 and anyone else who tends towards a bit of Fomo or keeping up with the Joneses \u2013 go from here?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still in the instant gratification stage of consuming,\u201d says Hemmings. \u201cWe\u2019re not in the habit of delayed return of even stopping to think about saving for something. We\u2019re not questioning the thought process. I think will be some time before we get back to considering purchases like that. This bubble isn\u2019t close to bursting.\u201d\n\nBut, she adds, it may be close to being questioned as we become more aware of the damage our consumer spending is having \u2013 on our emotional wellbeing, the environment and on our personal finances.", "description": "There have always been influencers.\u00a0 People whose words, actions and appearance affect those around them to such an extent that they emulate and copy them.\u00a0 To feel like part of the tribe, we have long invested in the same clothes, accessories, possessions and experiences as those we choose as the leaders of that tribe.", "authors": ["Kate Hughes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/03/09/istock-1095028274.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
