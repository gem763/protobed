Of course you have. But with help you can move on \u2026\n\nHow many grudges do you have at work? The workplace grudge can spring with equal force from small and large hurts. These may range \u2013 allow me to try to imagine \u2013 from the seemingly accidental negligence of the person who changed the toaster setting in the canteen so that your breakfast bagel burned, to the larger disappointment of being overlooked for a job. In my \u2013 former \u2013 workplaces, I visualised grudges as small red flags fluttering above the heads of certain colleagues. This can\u2019t be healthy. So why are grudges so powerful, and what is the best way to manage them?\n\n\u201cAs soon as you point the finger at someone who has wronged you, there are always three fingers pointing back at you,\u201d says Steven Sylvester, a psychologist and the author of Detox Your Ego. According to Sylvester, all grudges predate themselves because they spring from a grudge-ready mindset.\n\nA grudge is really \u201ca person manifesting their frustration by pointing it at someone else. It\u2019s a defensive tactic to explain away something we fear,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you have serial grudges, that [shows] a strong desire not to take full responsibility for what is happening in your life.\u201d\n\nAs a former professional cricketer who had to compete for selection, Sylvester has first-hand experience of grudges. He was also unfairly overlooked for a job once \u2013 although this was a validated grudge because one member of the interview panel thought Sylvester had been wronged, and phoned him later to apologise. The key, he says, is \u201cto hold the mirror\u201d to your grudge. \u201cWhat does it really say about you?\u201d\n\nSylvester\u2019s job is \u201cmassaging out the pain of the grudge\u201d in workplaces. \u201cThat\u2019s what I do every day.\u201d For those who can\u2019t get themselves to a grudge spa (or to talking therapy), Sylvester advises asking three questions. First, what emotions are being evoked by the person you hold a grudge against? Second, what does that say about you? \u201cWe inherently want to avoid the truth about ourselves,\u201d he says. This is the time to accept that you could have stepped in to readjust the toaster setting if you were less passive in social situations, or told you could have prepared more effectively for the job interview. The third step is \u201cself-correction\u201d, such as: \u201cI\u2019m going to cheerfully guard the toaster each morning until my bagel is cooked,\u201d or: \u201cI\u2019m going to look at a number of opportunities in the company to upskill myself.\u201d\n\nWhen a grudge takes hold \u2013 whether it begins as a feeling of acute pain or modest resentment \u2013 that is the time to catch yourself in the act, says Phil Renshaw, the co-author of Coaching on the Go. \u201cMost people are not out to be mean and nasty. Make yourself take the other person\u2019s perspective.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Accept that you could have stepped in to readjust the toaster setting.\u2019 Photograph: tatianatatiana/Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nRenshaw thinks that role-playing the begrudged person, or writing out their supposed thoughts, is more helpful than merely thinking about them. Our heads are not always the best places to do this. \u201cThere\u2019s too much jumping around. It\u2019s more exacting to write down the thoughts or say them aloud. They become more real when you hear yourself.\u201d Mind you, Renshaw says he has never had a work grudge, being \u201cone of those annoyingly glass-half-full guys\u201d.\n\nA grudge can be dissipated by following Renshaw\u2019s or Sylvester\u2019s advice \u2013 or it can be transmuted, as in the case of the crime-fiction writer Sophie Hannah, who has written a nonfiction book called How to Hold a Grudge. A grudge, she says, is simply \u201can instructive story that we choose to learn from, not a lasting feeling of resentment. This enables us to honour our most significant emotional and psychological experiences and commit to our highest values.\u201d\n\nIn any case, isn\u2019t there a pleasure to be had from a well-nourished grudge? Sylvester describes lighter grudges as something \u201cto be picked up and put down like a newspaper\u201d, almost like a leisure activity. The author Joanna Cannon wrote on Twitter that she feeds and waters her grudges \u201cas if they were small exotic plants\u201d. And William Blake\u2019s poem A Poison Tree is perhaps the seminal work of grudge literature. Surely it\u2019s OK to reserve a small, manageable dose of dislike for someone? Emma Donaldson-Feilder, an occupational psychologist, doesn\u2019t think so. \u201cActually, I think that\u2019s really unhealthy for most people. I would define a grudge as holding on to something beyond the point that it\u2019s useful \u2026 It\u2019s a stone in your shoe,\u201d she says.\n\nIf you have used the original hurt to motivate you, but the hurt still remains, \u201cit may be helpful to let go\u201d says Donaldson-Feilder. This feels vaguely disappointing. It doesn\u2019t seem so very wrong to keep the motivation and the grudge. \u201cMmm,\u201d she murmurs sympathetically. \u201cBut having negative feelings towards someone is always going to be a bit destabilising. It comes down to compassion, and being kind to ourselves and valuing ourselves.\u201d\n\nAt least after this I should have a clear run at the toaster tomorrow.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.
