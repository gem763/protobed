This trajectory-induced increase in rainfall is exacerbated by the climate-warming impact on the hydrologic cycle. Increased atmospheric moisture enhances the likelihood of extreme rainfall events of all types.\u201d\n\nA report in the New Scientist this month noted that \u201churricanes are expected to intensify faster, to become stronger overall, to dump more rain and to move more slowly as the world warms, and that seems to be just what is happening\u201d.\n\nThe study authors said their findings indicated the likelihood of increased rain and greater damage as hurricanes stall more frequently should be taken into account by those planning emergency response strategies.", "description": "Hurricane Dorian is the joint most powerful storm to make landfall in modern history, with sustained wind speeds of 185mph and gusts of up to 220mph at its peak, but despite this ferocity, the storm itself has been particularly slow-moving.
