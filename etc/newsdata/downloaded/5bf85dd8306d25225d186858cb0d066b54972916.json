Holmes posted the letter Sutherland received criticizing his hairstyle to social media on Monday. The letter begged Sutherland to cut his long dreadlocks to look like the \u201cclean cut\u201d men of yesteryear.\n\nShelton had shared the letter on Twitter with the caption, \u201cOne of my teammates got this. Explain to me how this isn\u2019t racist.\"\n\n\u201cThough the athletes of today are certainly superior to those in my days; we miss the clean cut young men and women from those days. Watching the Idaho game on TV we couldn\u2019t help but notice you--well-- awful hair,\u201d Johnstown, Pa. native Dave Petersen wrote.\n\n\u201cSurely there must be mirrors in the locker room! Don\u2019t you have parents or girlfriend who\u2019ve told you those shoulder length dreadlocks look disgusting and are certainly not attractive,\u201d Petersen continued.\n\nHolmes added: \u201cmy teammate got this in the mail today, and tbh Im [sic] at a lost for words.. I also have locs [dreadlocks], Tats, and NFL dreams too, these messages can not be tolerated, this was extremely inappropriate, racially biased, and selfish to feel like you even have a right to send this message.\"\n\nPetersen told The Tribune-Democrat he was unaware that his letter had ignited a firestorm on Twitter, with many users accusing him of racial insensitivity. He said that \u201cwas not the intent at all. I would just like to see the coaches get the guys cleaned up and not looking like Florida State and Miami guys.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt [his letter] wasn\u2019t threatening or anything,\" Petersen added. \"I was just disgruntled about some of the hairdos that we\u2019re seeing. You think of Penn State as a bunch of clean-cut guys. And you do see many who are clean cut. But the tattoos and the hair-- there are a lot of guys with hair coming down their backs and it just looks awful. And it\u2019s the same for the NFL and NBA, too.\u201d\n\nAccording to The Tribune-Democrat, Petersen is a 1966 Penn State graduate with a degree in speech pathology.\n\n\"You will certainly be playing 'on Sunday' in the future but we have stopped watching the NFL due to the disgusting, tattoos, awful hair and immature antics in the end zone. Players should act as though they've 'been there before,'\" the letter concluded.\n\nPenn State responded to Shelton's tweet by saying the letter does not align with their values.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"While we don\u2019t know the source of this letter or the authenticity, obviously its content does not align with our values. We strongly condemn this message or any message of intolerance,\" the university tweeted.\n\nThe Nittany Lions have won their first five games of the season and are ranked No. 10 in the country. They travel to Iowa to play the No. 17 Hawkeyes Saturday night.", "description": "The Penn State alumnus who wrote a \u201cracist\u201d letter to\u00a0defensive back Jonathan Sutherland has said\u00a0that making a racial or cultural statement \u201cwas not the intent at all.\u201d", "authors": ["Morgan Phillips"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Jonathan-Sutherland-Getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
