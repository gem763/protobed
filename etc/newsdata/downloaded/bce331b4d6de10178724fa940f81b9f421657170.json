The only note of discord I came across was the response of the Council of Institutional Investors, which expressed concerns that the BRT statement \u201cundercuts notions of managerial accountability to shareholders.\u201d\n\nI applaud the BRT statement. \u201cThis is great,\u201d I thought when first reading it, followed by \u201cwhat took you so long?\u201d Given the suffering brought upon so many Americans by the 2008 global financial crisis, the worst since the Great Depression, restoring trust in business and in our capitalist economic system should have been a top priority for corporate leaders. To help appreciate why it\u2019s taken the BRT over a decade to affirm that companies have obligations to society, let\u2019s take a look at the prevalent economic and political context of the past 50 years.\n\nThe notion that maximizing shareholder value should be the primary goal of corporate managers is relatively recent, an idea primarily formulated by academic economists about five decades ago, most notably those associated with the Chicago School of Economics. Through much of the 1960s, I was a physics major at the University of Chicago.\n\nIn a 1970 article, The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase its Profits, Chicago economist and Nobel Prize recipient Milton Friedman wrote:\n\n\u201cIn a free-enterprise, private-property system, a corporate executive is an employee of the owners of the business. He has direct responsibility to his employers. That responsibility is to conduct the business in accordance with their desires, which generally will be to make as much money as possible while conforming to the basic rules of the society, both those embodied in law and those embodied in ethical custom.\u201d\n\nMr. Friedman believed that business concerns beyond making profit--such as \u201cpromoting desirable social ends,\u201d or \u201cproviding employment, eliminating discrimination, avoiding pollution and whatever else\u201d--amounted to \u201cpreaching pure and unadulterated socialism.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that in the previous decades, from the 1930s to the 1970s, corporations, for the most part, were run for all stakeholders. It was a time when the interests of business and society were closely aligned, resulting in both high profits and decent livelihoods, making it possible for large portions of the U.S. population to achieve a middle class life-style and aspire to what we think of as The American Way of Life. Keynesian economics, named for British economist John Maynard Keynes, was the standard economic model during this period. It was a pragmatic, mixed model of capitalism, based on a predominantly private sector economy but with an appropriate role for government, such as the New Deal during the Great Depression and the Internet Highway System and GI Bill in the post-WWII years.\n\nKeynesian economics started to fall out of favor with the ascent of the Chicago School in the 1970s, whose views became highly influential over the next several decades, especially with former U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. Beyond the primacy of shareholder value, the Chicago School advocated a nearly universal trust in markets and a circumscribed role for government. Understandably, its influence waned considerably after the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at the BRT\u2019s Statement on the Purpose of the Corporation, which is based on five fundamental commitments to all stakeholders:\n\nDelivering value to our customers. We will further the tradition of American companies leading the way in meeting or exceeding customer expectations.\n\nInvesting in our employees. This starts with compensating them fairly and providing important benefits. It also includes supporting them through training and education that help develop new skills for a rapidly changing world. We foster diversity and inclusion, dignity and respect.\n\nInvesting in our employees. This starts with compensating them fairly and providing important benefits. It also includes supporting them through training and education that help develop new skills for a rapidly changing world. We foster diversity and inclusion, dignity and respect. Dealing fairly and ethically with our suppliers. We are dedicated to serving as good partners to the other companies, large and small, that help us meet our missions.\n\nSupporting the communities in which we work. We respect the people in our communities and protect the environment by embracing sustainable practices across our businesses.\n\nGenerating long-term value for shareholders, who provide the capital that allows companies to invest, grow and innovate. We are committed to transparency and effective engagement with shareholders.\n\nTo me, this all harks back to the roots of free-market, free-trade capitalism as first articulated by Adam Smith, the 18th century Scottish economist and philosopher, in his two major works, The Wealth of Nations and The Theory of Moral Sentiments. Mr. Smith believed that in a free market, an individual pursuing his own self-interests tends to also promote the good of his community as a whole, and that the free market, while appearing chaotic and unrestrained, is actually guided to produce the right results by a so-called invisible hand. But, while believing that our actions are guided by self-interest, Mr. Smith also advocated that our actions should be guided by sympathy, the human ability to have strong feelings of concern for another person with no regard for financial returns, seeing no contradiction between these two positions.\n\nLet me conclude by borrowing and tweaking Winston Churchill\u2019s dictum about democracy: Capitalism is the worst form of economic system except for all those others that have been tried from time to time. But, as I recently wrote, free-market, free-trade capitalism is at a crossroads. A well-functioning capitalist economy requires trust and confidence in its various institutions, so that together, they can not only work more efficiently but also contribute to a more decent society.\n\nWhile a prime responsibility of business leaders continues to be the viability and prosperity of their own companies and the generation of long-term value for their shareholders, they can no longer ignore the interests of customers, employees, suppliers, and communities. As the Business Roundtable wrote in its recent statement, \u201cEach of our stakeholders is essential\u2026 for the future success of our companies, our communities and our country.\"\n\nIrving Wladawsky-Berger worked at IBM from 1970 to 2007, and has been a strategic adviser to Citigroup, HBO and Mastercard and a visiting professor at Imperial College.
