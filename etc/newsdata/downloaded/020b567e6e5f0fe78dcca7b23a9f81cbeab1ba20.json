As if to validate these overwrought concerns, the New York Police Department even deployed undercover police officers to opening-night screenings.\n\nNone of it has stopped \u201cJoker\u201d from a projected weekend debut of $90 million-plus. Part of what\u2019s made it a box-office success is doubtless that we were all warned it was a dangerous and problematic film that some people might take the wrong way, and we can\u2019t have that.\n\nThe film, as most everyone knows by now, is about Arthur Fleck, a mentally ill clown who lives with his mentally ill mother and dreams of becoming a standup comic. Played by a rail-thin (and very disconcerting) Joaquin Phoenix, Fleck has serious problems and is very much in need of real help, which he doesn\u2019t get. Instead, he suffers a series of setbacks and humiliations and gradually slips into a violent psychosis.\n\nBy the film\u2019s end, amid a violent city-wide riot, he has become a folk hero to the disgruntled rabble of Gotham. Amid random mob violence and societal breakdown, the Joker is born.\n\nWhat critics have objected to above all is that Fleck is not portrayed as pure evil. He has actual reasons behind his violence. Simply put, he\u2019s taking revenge on an unjust world that showed him too little kindness and no love at all.\n\nIn recent interviews director Todd Phillips has expressed his disgust with liberal Hollywood and \u201cfar-left\u201d woke culture. But the objections of these woke critics notwithstanding, \u201cJoker\u201d isn\u2019t really all that political. To the extent there\u2019s a political analogy at work, it\u2019s an indictment of the coarseness of civic life. There\u2019s even a subtle anti-Antifa feeling to the masked Gothamites holding up signs that read \u201cWayne = Facist\u201d and \u201cKill the Rich.\u201d\n\nThe character of billionaire industrialist Thomas Wayne isn\u2019t quite a Trumpian figure, but he is an unapologetic elite who\u2019s entirely correct when he says there\u2019s \u201csomething wrong with Gotham\u201d and that the city needs help. He\u2019s also telling the truth about Arthur\u2019s mother, Penny, and her disturbing history of mental illness and abuse. In the end, he and his wife are killed not directly by the Joker, but by a random rioter inspired by the Joker\u2019s psychotic violence.\n\nAt the risk of reading too much into what is, at bottom, a comic-book supervillain origin story movie, \u201cJoker\u201d is on some level an indictment. But not quite in the way liberals critics suppose. What \u201cJoker\u201d indicts is moral relativism.\n\nConsciously or not, the film makes some implicit arguments, including an argument for compassion and community and against moral relativism and indifference. Here we have a profile of a disturbed man sliding into psychosis who gets no help from anyone\u2014not least the government social worker who\u2019s supposed to be helping him. It\u2019s set in a city simmering with hatred and violence, where basic government services like trash collection have broken down.\n\nA pop culture professor told the Washington Post that all the talk about potential real-world violence around the film is distracting from a great opportunity \u201cto use the movie for a dialogue about questions like alienation, toxic masculinity and the fragility of whiteness.\u201d\n\nBut \u201cJoker\u201d is really an opportunity for an altogether different dialogue about the role of families, about what people need most in life, about what makes for civic comity and solidarity. What it suggests, however unintentionally, is that maybe the best way to fend off the kind alienation and frustration that beset Arthur Fleck is with an intact family, a loving mother and a father.\n\nMaybe the thing people need most in life is friendship and love and community. Maybe we need to rethink the way we\u2019ve torn down the institutions and traditions that used to support these things. Maybe the radical atomization and isolation and autonomy of modern life doesn\u2019t foster prosperity and happiness. Maybe we need to start taking these things seriously.\n\nIf we do, that will mean rethinking a half-century of progressive thought, and questioning whether it has all been a pack of lies. And maybe that\u2019s the real reason woke media hate \u201cJoker.\u201d", "description": "Woke critics worry about the film\u2019s sympathetic depiction of a mass murderer, but their real beef is with its indictment of moral relativism.", "authors": ["John Daniel Davidson"], "top_image": "https://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Joker.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
