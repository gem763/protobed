The former Domain chief and the billionaire remain ACM's only shareholders, though it sounds like only one of their stakes is unencumbered.\n\nCatalano and Bolton were previously on the same side of an attempt to derail Nine's 2018 takeover of Fairfax Media, publisher of this newspaper, which achieved nothing beyond column inches. Could Bolton have subsequently helped fund Catalano's entry into Fairfax\u2019s regional papers?\n\nBolton said: \"Catalano does not have our $5 million\", adding that the media executive has \"plenty of money of his own\". He also stated that Catalano was \"not the transaction counter-party\". Catalano did not address a question about whether he was or had ever been in negotiations with Bolton about Keybridge's $5 million.\n\nLast week, Keybridge told the ASX it was in \"ongoing discussions with the counter-party to the proposed transaction in an attempt to resolve impediments to the transaction completing as originally intended\". That would be because the terms of Keybridge\u2019s payment remain unresolved.\n\nMajor concern\n\n\"Until these discussions conclude, [Keybridge] has elected to not immediately call for the payment to be returned. [Keybridge] has, however, obtained a personal guarantee from the transaction principal to ensure it has a security satisfactory to the Keybridge board for the ability to obtain return of the payment.\"\n\nThe transaction was an issue of major concern to Keybridge's board, control of which is split between nominees of the Bolton-controlled Aurora and the Farooq Khan-controlled Bentley.\n\nIt also raised alarm bells at Deloitte, which audits Keybridge. The firm's auditors state in Keybridge's annual report that they have been unable to ensure \"certain transactions recorded in the Group's accounting records were appropriately authorised and undertaken for the group's benefit\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The matters are so material and pervasive to the financial report that we are unable to express an opinion on the financial report taken as a whole.\"\n\nIn Perth\u2019s Federal Court earlier this month, a judge dismissed attempts by directors aligned with Bolton and with Khan to dismiss each other from the Keybridge board. Dissatisfied with the Bolton-aligned Keybridge chairman John Patton\u2019s explanation of the $5 million investment, Khan had passed a motion to dismiss him as chairman. The Court overruled that, as well as Khan\u2019s own removal by Patton.\n\nGiven Bolton's rap sheet with the corporate regulators, his (indirect) financial backing of The Canberra Times, Newcastle Herald and Illawarra Mercury becoming public would presumably be a little mortifying for their proprietors.", "description": "Two days before Nine sold Australian Community Media, Keybridge Capital made an intriguing transfer.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_5.3214%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/182d3d6a0f884ce4715b5bbb55e3507f7886e59f", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
