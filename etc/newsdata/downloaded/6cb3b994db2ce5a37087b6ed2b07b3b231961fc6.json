Add Interest\n\nMeanwhile, the world of esports is navigating a controversy of its own, after a high-profile gamer from Hong Kong was banned from the platform Blizzard for voicing support for protesters in Hong Kong during a post-game interview. In a statement announcing his removal, Blizzard said they were banning player Blitzchung for violating its competition rules by engaging in an act that \"offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image.\"\n\nBoth cases have illustrated the difficulty of navigating China's lucrative market.\n\nBefore the controversial tweet, the Rockets were one of the most beloved teams in China. On Oct 4., its general manager Daryl Morey tweeted in support of pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong. While the tweet was quickly deleted, the backlash was swift. Within a few days, China's state-run broadcasting network ordered a blackout of NBA coverage. China's internet giant Tencent, which inked a five-year, $1.5 billion deal in August to stream NBA games in China, also announced that they will not play Rockets games.\n\nMorey has apologized, and the Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta said that Morey does not speak for them. Rockets players James Harden and Russell Westbrook apologized at a news conference, with Harden adding, \"We love China, we love playing there.\"\n\n1/ I did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China. I was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event. I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives. \u2014 Daryl Morey (@dmorey) October 7, 2019\n\nOn Wednesday, President Donald Trump weighed in, telling reporters outside the White House that \u201cthe NBA knows what they are doing,\u201d when asked with he thought about the situation.\n\nTrump then attacked Golden State Warriors\u2019 coach Steve Kerr, referencing a recent news conference when Kerr called the situation \u201ca really bizarre international story\u201d that a lot of us \u201cdon\u2019t know what to make of.\u201d\n\n\u201cI watched this guy, Steve Kerr, he was so scared. He was like a little boy, he didn't know how to answer the question and he was shaking,\u201d Trump said.\n\nHe also took aim at Gregg Popovich, coach of the San Antonio Spurs, accusing Popovich and Kerr of \u201cpandering to China.\u201d\n\nThe fallout from the tweet also continued in China. On Wednesday, video spread on social media of an NBA banner being ripped off the side of a building in Shanghai.\n\nAly Song/Reuters\n\nThe NBA said that it was not its decision to call off Wednesday's NBA Cares event with the Lakers, which was supposed to benefit the Special Olympics. On Tuesday, a separate NBA Cares event with the Brooklyn Nets at a school in Shanghai was also called off by the Chinese government. NBA commissioner Adam Silver said that they would still donate computers to the education center as planned, according to ESPN.\n\nIn a statement announcing their decision to suspend plans to broadcast a series of NBA preseason games, China's state-owned broadcasting network CCTV said it is \"strongly dissatisfied and opposed\" to Silver's \"claim to support Morey's free expression of rights.\"\n\n\"We believe that any speech that challenges national sovereignty and social stability is not within the scope of freedom of speech,\" the statement added. \"To this end, CCTV Sports Channel of the Central Radio and Television General Administration decided to immediately suspend the current broadcast arrangements of the NBA preseason [China Games] and immediately investigate all cooperation and exchanges involving the NBA.\"\n\nAly Song/Reuters\n\nOnline gamer banned from competition\n\nAs the NBA is still reeling from the fallout, the world of esports was rocked by a separate scandal after a high-profile gamer from Hong Kong spoke out in support of the anti-government demonstrations in an interview -- and then was abruptly banned from the competition.\n\nNg Wai Chung, known by his gaming handle \"Blitzchung,\" was banned from the platform Blizzard, where he was competing in a Hearthstone tournament, after a post-game interview supporting protesters in Hong Kong. In a statement announcing his removal, Blizzard said they were banning Blitzchung for violating its competition rules by engaging in an act that \"offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, #BoycottBlizard was trending on Twitter in the U.S. Chung has not publicly responded to the news, but his Twitter bio was updated to read that he was \"banned\" as a grandmaster and states: \"Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\"\n\nThe move drew bipartisan criticism from lawmakers on Twitter.\n\n\u201cBlizzard shows it is willing to humiliate itself to please the Chinese Communist Party,\u201d Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said in a tweet. \u201cNo American company should censor calls for freedom to make a quick buck.\u201d\n\nBlizzard shows it is willing to humiliate itself to please the Chinese Communist Party.
