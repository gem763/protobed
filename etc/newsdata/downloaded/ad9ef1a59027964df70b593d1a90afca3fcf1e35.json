The state had asked for $17 billion to compensate for the deaths of more than 4,000 residents over the past 20 years.\n\nA spokesman for Attorney General Mike Hunter declined to comment on the filing. \"Given the pending matter both before Judge Balkman and the Supreme Court, we aren't going to comment outside of what has been filed with the courts at this time,\" said spokesman Alex Gerszewski.\n\nPurdue Pharma files for bankruptcy amid numerous lawsuits over opioid epidemic\n\nJohnson & Johnson maintains the miscalculation resulted in the amount the judge awarded for the costs to the state for developing and disseminating information on treating babies born addicted to opioids. The cost of these services should have been about $107,000, not $107 million, attorneys wrote.\n\n\"No evidence supports this higher amount, which appears simply to reflect a mistaken addition of three zeros to the calculation of the annual average, yet the state's proposed judgment fails to account for this discrepancy,\" the filing states.\n\nThe company's request for a reduced award was outlined in its response to the state's proposed final judgment. In that proposal, the state asks the court to immediately order the company to pay the entire $572 million award to its attorneys. The state also maintains the court could order the company to pay even more to abate the opioid crisis in future years.\n\nJohnson & Johnson on Tuesday reached a settlement for more than $20 million with two Ohio counties. It faces more than 2,000 lawsuits over the opioid epidemic.", "description": "Oklahoma court erroneously added three zeroes in calculating $572 million opioid case award, company claims", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/02/fdaab633-94ba-4bbf-84e1-98c23694b87a/thumbnail/1200x630/b8fbdf9babdf8726cd3958d8e258fffc/johnson-gettyimages-1164571026.jpg"}
