He was sitting against the balcony and the railing moved.\n\n\"His friend's mum came to our house to tell us there had been an accident.\n\n\"I didn't think it was my boy, I thought she'd got it wrong.\n\n\"I cannot put it into words how it feels when you think you could lose your son, it's worse because I wasn't with him.\"\n\nDoctors told the family they expect he will suffer some \"challenging behaviour\" and there's a risk of memory loss.\n\nThe mum was told by medical experts it could take one year before he can walk again.\n\nMedical staff are unable to tell the family an expected outcome and are taking things \"hour-by-hour\".\n\n(Image: JustGiving.com)\n\nGeorge will require surgery to his brain, skull, face and spinal injuries before he can be flown back home to the UK.\n\nMarion added: \"I would give anything to swap places with him.\n\n\"I just want him to open his eyes and talk to me again.\"\n\nGeorge's two older sisters Jade and Kelly Copeland have since set up a Just Giving page to help raise money for the expenses of being abroad.\n\nHis sister, Jade Copeland, 28, said: \"We got a knock on the door at about midnight to say that George had fallen from the balcony. We spoke to one of his friends who said it was quite bad.\n\n\"A nurse who happened to be staying there managed to get to him and started CPR straight away and the ambulance came five or six minutes later.\n\n\"My mum and dad flew out there the next morning and have stayed with him ever since.\n\n\"George has a great social life, lots of friends and lots of people really do care about him. It's so overwhelming.\n\n\"He's such a loving person he's upbeat and just positive all the time.\"\n\n(Image: JustGiving.com)\n\nAlthough George took out travel insurance, it is currently unknown whether the insurance company will provide coverage so his family are trying to raise as much money as possible.\n\nAfter just 36 hours of hospital stay, his family were advised that George's hospital bill is in excess of \u20ac12,000 ( \u00a310,000).\n\nThe family also need to find money for flights, accommodation, taxis and phone usage while in Ibiza.\n\nThe Just Giving page reads: \"George is our little brother, the youngest of five, also known as 'The Runt of the Litter'!\n\n\"He has such a lovable personality, that even when he's annoying you, he only has to flash his cheeky smile to make you melt.\n\n\"He has such a big and generous heart, he will go to the ends of the earth for those he loves.\n\n\"He has more friends than we can count, and so many people have reached out to offer their support, just making us realise exactly how incredibly loved he is.\n\n\"All we know is, that if it were the other way around, George would be moving mountains to bring us home.\n\n\"We've fallen on hard times and it is not in our nature to ask for help. But desperate times require desperate measures and we would be eternally grateful for anything that could be donated, no matter how much - every penny will count!\n\n\"Our family cannot express enough our appreciation for any help we receive during this devastating time. Thank you all so much.\"\n\nThe page has already collected over \u00a310,000, with a \u00a315,000 target and Marion said the support has so far been amazing.\n\nShe said: \"There's nothing I can say or do to thank everyone for their support.\"\n\nA hotel spokesman said: \"I cannot offer any information in this regard. However, the incident was due to causes completely outside the hotel.\"\n\nYou can donate by visiting the family's Just Giving page", "description": "George Stephenson, from Canvey Island, Essex, suffered severe brain trauma and multiple skull, facial and spinal fractures following the horror fall on the first night of his holiday", "authors": ["Sophie Finnegan", "Image", "Justgiving.Com"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20535513.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_George-Stephenson.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
