Under the terms of the agreement, GE is to bring its own 3-D printers into Air Force repair depots and train the military\u2019s repairers to use them, Roper said. It also comes with a licensing scheme in which the Air Force pays GE a fixed fee every time it prints a part.\n\n3-D printers build three-dimensional products from a wide variety of materials using specialized software.\n\nAD\n\nRoper said the Defense Department does not mind the fees as long as the practice contributes to the service\u2019s readiness goals. The Air Force faces the dual challenge of keeping more planes battle-ready while increasing its total number of squadrons.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFighting over the legality of whether we can reverse-engineer a part is not where we want to spend our time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019d like to pay a fair price for being able to do that and move on.\u201d\n\nU.S. military spending set to increase for fifth consecutive year, nearing levels during height of Iraq War\n\n3-D printers are seen as a possible solution for a problem that has dogged the Air Force since the Cold War. The Defense Department estimates that about 70 percent of a military airplane\u2019s long-term cost comes from sustaining it. The purchase price, even though it is usually in the tens of millions of dollars, is smaller than the cost of repairing and maintaining the plane.\n\nAD\n\nThe problem is made worse by the fact that today, the Air Force includes more old aircraft than at any other time in the service\u2019s history.\n\nAt the beginning of 2019, the Air Force had roughly 5,500 aircraft, by far the largest force in the world. But a recent report from the Congressional Budget Office placed their average age at 28 years. Hundreds of them are approaching their sixth decade of service, and they are expected to become even more costly to maintain as they age.\n\nAD\n\nPart of the problem is that aircraft manufacturers often hold intellectual-property rights for parts that give them a degree of control over the price. In some cases, contractors have used intellectual-property arrangements to justify outrageous price increases. Government officials overseeing supply contracts often don\u2019t challenge the higher prices or even ask for financial data that would show whether the price is fair.\n\nAD\n\nIn a report from the Defense Department inspector general released this year, an aircraft supply holding company called TransDigm was accused of earning \u201cexcess profits\u201d on a sample of 47 spare parts. The inspector general identified profit margins ranging from 17 percent to well over 4,000 percent for specific spare parts.\n\nMilitary parts supplier TransDigm draws scrutiny over prices\n\nThe company later paid back the Defense Department $16.1 million for the products. Company executives said TransDigm had not broken any procurement laws and described the payment as voluntary.\n\nAD\n\nIn other cases, parts are hard to find because the aircraft\u2019s original manufacturer has shut down the production line. When such a part is critically necessary to achieve the military\u2019s readiness goals, price concerns often go by the wayside.\n\n\u201cWhat I have a hard time doing is getting excited about intellectual property that is on the geriatric side of the Air Force,\u201d Roper said. \u201cFor a part that is sitting on a 40- or 50-year airplane, it\u2019s hard for me to think that that [intellectual property] is there for the right reasons.\"\n\nAD", "description": "Defense Department officials are hoping the partnership can be expanded to help control soaring sustainment and repair costs.", "authors": ["Aaron Gregg", "Reporter Covering The Defense Industry", "Commercial Aviation", "Government Contractors."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ZhufBDfiN1emXhgUvtrRGvzaRpE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ARDNQPW23UI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
