After all, Fidelity offers a variety of investment options from sector-based funds to key actively managed funds. The company provides investment advice, discount brokerage services, retirement services, wealth management services, securities execution, and clearance and life insurance products to its clients.\n\nAt Fidelity, a large group of investment professionals carry out extensive and in-depth research to provide potential investment avenues worldwide for their investors. To top it, low expenses, effective fund management and the ability to survive market volatility have resulted in strong fund performance. Let\u2019s look at the best performing Fidelity mutual funds of Q3.\n\nFidelity\u2019s Performance in Q3\n\nBy the end of the third quarter, Fidelity Investments had more than $1.9 trillion of assets under management. The initial investment of the majority of Fidelity mutual funds ranges from $0 to $2,500. As of Aug 31, 2019, out of the total number of funds under Fidelity, only 3.2% were load funds, while the remaining 96.8% were no load funds.\n\nFurther, Fidelity Advisor Growth Opportunities Fund Class M FAGOX turned up as one of the best-performing mutual funds from the Fidelity family. The fund posted solid gains in the period between July and September. FAGOX, which invests a bulk of its assets in common stocks of companies with above-average growth potential, returned 6.2% in the third quarter and has added 26% so far this year.\n\nWhat Contributed to Fidelity\u2019s Gains?\n\nFidelity invests in a variety of sectors that are sensitive, cyclical and defensive. From the sensitive sectors, most investments were made in the technology sector. Among the cyclical sectors, the fund family invested the maximum in the financial services sector, while among the defensive sectors it invested heavily in healthcare.\n\nTechnology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) climbed 27.9% in the YTD period and has remained the best-performing sector so far this year among the 11 S&P 500 sectors.\n\n4 Best Funds to Buy Now\n\nGiven such circumstances, we have highlighted four Fidelity mutual funds carrying a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) that are poised to gain from such factors. Moreover, these funds have encouraging third quarter and YTD returns. Additionally, the minimum initial investment is within $5000.\n\nWe expect these funds to outperform their peers in the future. Remember, the goal of the Zacks Mutual Fund Rank is to guide investors to identify potential winners and losers.
