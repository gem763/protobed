Some are good. Some are alarming. For many of them, there may be things that you will want to manually opt out of if you want to guard your privacy.\n\nBut before we begin, let\u2019s start with a general observation: if you link your fitness account with your Google or Facebook account for login purposes, you\u2019re giving the company access to your contact list and social activity. You may not want to do that.\n\nSecond, most apps will want to use the ad-tracking features native to your platform. You can turn them off:\n\nOn an iPhone, go to \u201cSettings\u201d > \u201cGeneral\u201d > \u201cPrivacy\u201d > \u201cAdvertising\u201d > \u201cLimit Ad-Tracking\u201d\n\nOn Android 9, go to \u201cSettings\u201d > \u201cGoogle\u201d > \u201cAds\u201d > \u201cOpt out of Ads Personalization\u201d\n\nFinally, note that the directions in this article are for US users. If you\u2019re in Europe, GDPR may apply, and the rules are more in your favor.\n\nWith Strava, you own all of the content you create: workouts, data, photographs, posts, and so on. (If you create a route and make it public, that belongs to Strava.) However, the company claims the right to use that content and your name \u2014 including in ads pushed to other users \u2014 unless and until you delete it. If you upload your contacts or link your account with other social media accounts, it uses that to suggest other people you may want to follow. This all sounds obvious, but do keep this in mind: the more information you give it, the more information it has.\n\nBy default, you give Strava access to everything you do on its platform, and your profile and activities are public. Strava, for instance, maps your runs, which can be useful. But that feature can expose exactly where you live, work, or exercise regularly. You can mask that, but you should be aware that you\u2019ll have to do it manually through the app settings.\n\nHow to opt out: Fortunately, Strava gives you a great deal of control over how exposed your data is. Besides its formal privacy policy, which is written in reasonably comprehensible English, Strava has published a blog post that clearly walks you through ways to protect your personal data.\n\nFitbit doesn\u2019t collect as much data as Strava does, but its platform isn\u2019t as ambitious, either. It does collect the data that you presumably want it to gather \u2014 steps, heart rate, weight, sleep stages \u2014 and tracks your location, step data, and coached classes.\n\nBut remember that those coaching services may be provided by a third party, like one of Fitbit\u2019s services or possibly your employer or insurance company. If you take a class, Fitbit collects information about your plan, your goal, your communications with your coach, and even the notes that your coach keeps about you. (That last bit may be especially creepy if the class is provided or required by your employer or insurance company.) In addition, the company may use your information to feed you customized insights.\n\nHow to opt out: You can decline to share most personal information, and you can control many social notifications. Open the app, go to the Account screen by tapping the icon on the app\u2019s upper left corner, and proceed to the \u201cPrivacy and Security\u201d section.\n\nFitbit says it may aggregate and de-identify your data and disclose it publicly in reports or to marketing partners. You cannot opt out of that.\n\nYour iPhone and Apple Watch probably know everything about you. Apple says your personal data is encrypted; the company can\u2019t see it, and it doesn\u2019t market it to third parties.\n\nHow to opt out: As with Apple\u2019s other products, you can opt out of Apple\u2019s marketing mailing list by going to your Apple ID preferences, and you can limit ad tracking.\n\nZen Labs\u2019 privacy policy is a little slippery. First of all, it\u2019s available only on your phone; the policy on the web is only the policy for its partners. Digging through the app (by going to Settings > Consent Management), you learn that C25K collects and shares your device\u2019s advertising ID and location data so companies can push ads to you. (Zen Labs says no personally identifiable data is included.) Tracking is on when the app is running in the background, too.\n\nOne of Zen Labs\u2019 partners, Sense360, also collects a list of the other apps on your phone, including when the apps are closed. Sense360\u2019s site indicates that it serves mostly the fast-food industry, which makes it kind of an odd partner for C25K.\n\nHow to opt out: Other than turning off your ad tracking, there\u2019s no way to opt out of C25K\u2019s tracking.\n\nMyFitnessPal is part of Under Armour, which has lots of different parts, so its privacy policy is extensive and dense. Some of the data you provide by using the app gets used to feed you targeted workouts and other fitness-related content.\n\nBasically, the MFP policy says that whatever you do or connect to on its app, it can share with third parties. That includes making associations between your MFP account and other users, other social media accounts, or anyone else. That information is not necessarily anonymized.\n\nApple users catch a break: Under Armour says its partners treat iOS data according to Apple\u2019s Developer Guidelines, which are strict about privacy. Android users are apparently on their own.\n\nHow to opt out: You can control what you publicize to other users about your activity and control how much email the app sends you about your friends\u2019 achievements. You can also turn off MFP\u2019s ability to feed you location-based ads by going to the lower right corner of the app and selecting More > Privacy Center > Personalization. There is no apparent way to opt out of MFP\u2019s third-party sharing other than to turn off ad tracking entirely.", "description": "How much of your data is shared, and to whom, is usually set out in the privacy policy that most people accept (and don\u2019t bother to read) when they are installing an app. To see exactly what you are agreeing to, we took a look at the privacy policies of some popular fitness apps.", "authors": ["Dan Rosenbaum", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/88S4gUmJrT9HxgmVtU-adLiILQs=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13959700/acastro_190204_1777_privacy_0002.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-03"}
