President Trump: 'I just want to congratulate you, what you do is incredible. You are very brave people. I don\u2019t think I would want to do it, but I must tell you that you are amazing people.' 'They are conducting the first ever female spacewalk to replace an exterior part of the space station.' 'They\u2019re doing some work and they are doing it in a very high altitude, an altitude that very few people will ever see.' 'Congratulations to Christina and Jessica on this historic event.' 'This is truly historic and you are right now on television all over the world, so don\u2019t get nervous.' 'I would like to ask you a question.' 'What would you like to tell everyone listening and watching today, especially young girls and women who are interested in space.' Jessica Meir: 'We don't want to take too much credit because there have been many other female spacewalkers before.' 'This is the first time that there's been two women outside at the same time.'\n\n'We don't want to take too much credit because there have been many other female spacewalkers before,' she said.\n\n'This is the first time that there's been two women outside at the same time.'\n\nThe first woman to complete a spacewalk was Russian astronaut Svetlana Yevgenyevna Savitskaya in 1984 \u2013 a total of 15 women have ever spacewalked, including Meir and Koch.\n\nRegardless of the blunder, Koch and Meir will still go in history books for the first all-female spacewalk.\n\nThe duo left the International Space Station at 07:38am ET (12:38pm BST) today to begin the first all-female spacewalk ever.\n\nTheir job was to fix a broken part of the station's solar power network.\n\nThe pair moved to the space station's P6 truss at the far end to begin work, where they replaced a failed power controller.\n\nThe spacewalk was streamed live by NASA and is a landmark moment for female astronauts and scientists.\n\nAn all-woman spacewalk had been planned for March but one of the astronauts was replaced by a man because her space suit didn't fit.\n\nThe first American female spacewalker, who carried out her own mission 35 years ago, Kathy Sullivan, said she was delighted by today's milestone.\n\nAnd a NASA spokesperson said: 'Our achievements provide inspiration to students around the world, proving that hard work can lead you to great heights, and all students should be able to see themselves in those achievements.'\n\nKoch and Meir replaced battery units called BCDUs after they failed to provide increased power to the ISS.\n\nThis failure has not significantly impacted the crew or its mission but needs to be repaired nonetheless.\n\nJessica Meir (left) and Christina Koch (right) have made it safely back inside of the International Space Station after fixing exterior parts of the craft\n\nMeir (right) chimed in to clarify that there has been 'many other female spacewalkers before' \u2013 the first woman to spacewalk took place in 1984 and 14 more have since followed. Her and Koch (left) participated in the first ever all-female spacewalk\n\nAccording to NASA, BCDUs regulate the charge for batteries that draw energy from the station's solar collectors to provide power as the station orbits at night.\n\nKoch, who is also set to complete the longest single spaceflight by a woman as she remains in orbit until February 2020, said gender milestones like the spacewalk were especially significant.\n\n'There are a lot of people who derive motivation from inspiring stories from people who look like them, and I think that it\u00b4s an important aspect of the story to tell,' she told a NASA briefing in Houston this month.\n\n'What we\u00b4re doing now shows all the work in the decades prior from all the women that worked to get us where we are today,' Meir added.\n\nKoch, who was slated for the earlier spacewalk, will be making her fourth walk and will become the 14th woman ever to walk in space. Today will mark Meir's first spacewalk. The ISS has seen more than 200 spacewalks since 1998.\n\nAn all-woman spacewalk had been planned for March but one of the astronauts was replaced by a man because her space suit didn't fit. However, Meir (left) and Koch (right) were able to complete the spacewalk and make history\n\nKoch can be seen during today's space walk with a red band around her space suit leg\n\nNASA astronauts Christina Koch and Jessica Meir exiting the International Space Station\n\nJessica Meir's helmet cam as she moved along the ISS to the work station\n\nNASA, astronauts Christina Koch, right, and, Jessica Meir pose for a photo on the International Space Station\n\nNASA makes history as two women astronauts embark on the first ever all-female spacewalk from the ISS\n\nThe pair exited the International Space Station at 07:38am ET (12:38pm BST)\n\nThe planned all-woman spacewalk in March was called off because astronaut Ann McClain needed a medium spacesuit but only a large was available.\n\nDue to safety issues with the fit she did not participate and man took her place, making today the revised date for the landmark mission.\n\n'We must never accept a risk that can instead be mitigated,' she said on Twitter after the event. 'Safety of the crew and execution of the mission come first.'\n\nWatchers took to Twitter to share their delight at the first all-female space walk in history taking place\n\nAt the time the cancellation drew widespread criticism, including from former U.S. First Lady Hillary Clinton and global activism group March for Science.\n\nWoman completing spacewalks date back to July, 1984 when Russian cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya became the first to do so.\n\nRussian cosmonaut Alexei Leonov \u2013 who died just last week \u2013 conducted history's first spacewalk in 1965, four years before the US put men on the moon for the first time.\n\nOthers jokingly asked whether the women would be paid the same for the walk\n\nChristina H. Koch, left, and Meir greeted each other after Meir's arrival on the International Space Station last month\n\nWhile today's event was a long time coming, NASA said it was not planned.\n\n'It is something that was bound to happen eventually, and the increase in female astronauts in space for the past year is providing another window of opportunity,' a spokeswoman said.\n\n'Fifty percent of the 2013 astronaut candidate class are women,' she noted, 'and of the 11 members of 2017 astronaut candidate class still in training, five are women.'\n\nNASA astronauts Christina Koch (L) and Jessica Meir (R) in Baikonur, Kazakhstan, September 2019\n\nThis photo provided by NASA shows astronauts Andrew Morgan with Christina Koch and Jessica Meir at the International Space Station on Friday, Oct. 18, 2019", "description": "NASA astronauts Jessica Meir and Christina Koch made history today for the first all-female spacewalk, however, President Trump congratulated the pair for being the 'first ever female spacewalkers'.", "authors": ["Stacy Liberatore For Dailymail.Com", "Sam Blanchard", "Milly Vincent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/19/19898832-0-image-a-4_1571424723590.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
