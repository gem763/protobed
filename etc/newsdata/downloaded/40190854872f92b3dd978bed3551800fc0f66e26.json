For what? Who gains from that?\n\nRihanna graces us with her presence on the November cover of Vogue America\n\n\u2018Not my people. I just couldn\u2019t be a sell-out. I couldn\u2019t be an enabler. There\u2019s things within that organisation that I do not agree with at all, and I was not about to go and be of service to them in any way.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the agonising wait for her follow-up to 2016\u2019s Anti continues, the 31-year-old Barbadian did share that she is going back to her roots when her album does finally drop.\n\n\u2018I like to look at it as a reggae-inspired or reggae-infused album,\u2019 she said. \u2018It\u2019s not gonna be typical of what you know as reggae. But you\u2019re going to feel the elements in all of the tracks.\n\n\u2018Reggae always feels right to me. It\u2019s in my blood. It doesn\u2019t matter how far or long removed I am from that culture, or my environment that I grew up in; it never leaves. It\u2019s always the same high.\u2019\n\nOnce she has finished the entrepreneur \u2014 who also juggles music with her lingerie and make-up businesses \u2014 says she \u2018without a doubt\u2019 wants to have kids with 31-year-old Saudi billionaire Hassan Jameel.\n\nThe Umbrella hitmaker has been dating the businessman, for two years and they\u2019re still going strong with RiRi pretty much confirming that they\u2019re in it for the long haul and sees marriage in their future.\n\nShe even revealed which designer would have the absolute pleasure of creating the gown for her future wedding: \u2018It would probably be a collaboration between myself and [John] Galliano, of course.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
