We have to come out of the boy zone and play like men and respect the game. They are very talented and learning to be ruthless.\"\n\nBen Chilwell began the destruction in the 10th minute when he tapped in on the rebound, and Ryan Bertrand's red card - awarded via VAR for a late tackle on Ayoze Perez in the build-up to the opener - helped the away side open the floodgates.\n\nQuickfire strikes from Youri Tielemans and Perez put Leicester three goals to the good with less than 20 minutes gone amid a downpour on the south coast.\n\nPerez struck again seven minutes before the break from a Chilwell cross to make it four before Vardy scored his first of the evening as Leicester racked up five goals in the first half of a league match for the first time since 1984.\n\nIt was also the first time that a side had crashed home that many goals in the opening period of a Premier League game since Manchester City beat Burnley 6-1 in April 2010.\n\nThat didn't stop Leicester from raining down goals on Southampton however, with two coming within a minute just before the hour mark.\n\nFirst Perez completed his treble after collecting Hervey Barnes' superb lofted through ball in the 57th minute, and Vardy headed home from another precise Chilwell cross seconds later.\n\nJames Maddison made it a record-breaking away scoreline with five minutes remaining when he swung home a perfect free-kick that zipped past the desperate Angus Gunn.\n\nAnd Vardy sealed Leicester's place in the record books with his ninth of the season deep into stoppage, firing home a penalty that also took him top of the Premier League scoring charts with nine goals after he was brought down by Jan Bednarek.\n\n\"It was an embarrassing performance, the stuff of nightmare and especially playing at home,\" Saints' Nathan Redmond told Sky Sports.", "description": "Leicester City went into the Premier League record books with a hammering of Southampton that equalled the biggest ever win in the history of the division.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2150/e7eb4e5a120a4714874a427a391cc48d.gif", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
