Most had never met him.\n\nIt was a touching tribute to Staff Sgt. Lyndon Badgett, 57, a U.S. Air Force veteran who seemed to outlast most of his family and friends. For weeks, it seemed as if he would be buried alone.\n\n\"No veteran should be left to leave here alone after spending their time serving this country,\u201d said one of the attendees, Mark Harris of Clarksville, Tenn.\n\nAfter Badgett's death Aug. 30, the Gateway Funeral Home in Clarksville spent several frantic weeks trying to find a next of kin -- to no avail. Not wanting to bury him alone, they put a call out on Facebook for people to come and honor him at his final resting place.\n\nThe response was overwhelming.\n\n\u201cI expected a lot of people, but I have to say that I was shocked at the numbers that were there and the outpouring of people and the distances that came,\u201d said Wade Winkler, funeral director for Gateway Funeral Home.\n\nThe funeral home covered the cost of his memorial services. He received full military honors.\n\nAs the veteran\u2019s casket, which was draped in an American flag, was carried into the Middle Tennessee State Veterans Cemetery, tears fell down people's faces, even though many in attendance were strangers.\n\nOLDEST LIVING WWII VETERAN CELEBRATES 110TH BIRTHDAY\n\nAmong those to show up was Sylvia Melton, an Army veteran who served in the 9th infantry division. She said knew Badgett from the nursing home where the two lived. She and several other friends of Badgett traveled more than 50 miles to honor him.\n\n\u201cWe was told he had nobody,\u201d Melton said. \u201cAs a veteran, you never let somebody die by themselves. You come out and you honor them.\u201d\n\nAnother friend, Arthur Jester, said he also got to know Badgett at the nursing home. He said he was a \u201chell of a good guy\u201d whose presence would be missed.\n\nTOP OFFICIALS DISCIPLINED OVER ANT BITES AT GEORGIA VA HOSPITAL\n\n\u201cHe was the kind of guy, you could talk to today and you know he\u2019s a good guy,\u201d he said. \u201cHe never said nothing bad about nobody. That was the kind of guy he was.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Patriot Guard, Badgett served in the U.S. Air Force and the Air Force Reserve from 1981 to 1997. Other than that, little was known about him.\n\nWinkler said the night before Badgett\u2019s service, the funeral home received a call from a woman who said she was Badgett's daughter. She couldn't make the funeral service, but Winkler said she agreed with what the funeral home was doing for her father.\n\n\u201cOne thing I did tell his daughter is that, 'he will not be alone',\" Winkler said, \"And that came true.\u201d", "description": "A United States Air Force veteran with no known family members in the wake of his death received his final honors as he was laid to rest in Nashville.", "authors": ["Charles Watson", "Charles Watson Joined Fox News In As A Multimedia Reporter Based In Jackson"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/10ea3169-IMG_1477.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
