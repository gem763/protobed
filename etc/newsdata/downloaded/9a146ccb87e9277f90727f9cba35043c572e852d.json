Read more\n\nThe invaders protested that they had been excluded from the proceedings. No matter that dozens of Republicans are sitting in on the hearings, where closed-door status is not remarkable and entirely appropriate, according to Republicans themselves. No matter that 13 of the 41 Republicans who protested being banned from the proceedings in fact had access to the room and had actually attended the hearings, according to the Washington Post.\n\nIn light of those facts, Republicans\u2019 invasion charade might seem desperate, but it points to an important feature of Trump\u2019s overall impeachment defense, analysts warned, and one that opponents of the president might underestimate.\n\nTrump\u2019s playbook when he faced special counsel Robert Mueller was to seek to discredit the investigation as a corrupt, partisan \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d with no grounding in fact. He is pursuing a similar strategy now, with the help of young Republican members in Congress who recognize that the fastest route to building power \u2013 and fame, and perhaps even wealth \u2013 in today\u2019s Washington is to be seen defending the president on TV.\n\nUnder this strategy, the substance of the impeachment inquiry does not matter; it only matters what the inquiry looks like to the American voters who stand behind the members of Congress in whose hands Trump\u2019s fate lies. Each degree that Trump is able to move the conversation away from his alleged misdeeds and toward supposed flaws in the process or poison in the politics represents a success for him.\n\nTo that end, Trump in the last week has used racially inflammatory language to describe the inquiry, attacked Republicans who oppose him as \u201chuman scum\u201d, and repeatedly demanded that the identity of the whistleblower in the Ukraine affair be revealed. He has sprinkled some conspiracy dust on top, claiming on Thursday that the impeachment inquiry is part of an \u201cinsurance policy\u201d held by the \u201cdeep state\u201d to circumvent or override his election.\n\nAnd Trump congratulated the \u201ctough, smart and understanding\u201d Republicans who invaded the hearing room, some of whom \u201casked to be arrested\u201d, according to Chad Pergram of Fox News.\n\nTrump impeachment: chaos erupts as Republicans barge into inquiry hearing Read more\n\n\u201cThey wanted the optic of being frog marched out of the SCIF [secure room] in front of TV cameras,\u201d Pergram wrote. \u201cThat would help with [the] GOP narrative of Democratic process abuse.\u201d\n\nNone succeeded in being arrested, although they stayed long enough to order pizza.\n\nThe Republican demands for \u201ctransparency\u201d in this early stage of the impeachment inquiry has a certain flavor of myopia about it, analysts noted, speculating that public testimony, for example by Bill Taylor, the top US diplomat to Ukraine, could be even more damaging for Trump than was Taylor\u2019s private testimony on Tuesday, which shocked lawmakers.\n\n\u201cMark my words,\u201d wrote former FBI special agent and commentator Asha Rangappa, \u201cwhen it comes time, these same people are going to try their damnedest to keep these witnesses from testifying publicly.\u201d\n\nAs Taylor testified, Trump met with lawyers at the White House \u2013 notably omitting the embattled Rudy Giuliani \u2013 and called congressional Republicans to demand better coordination and a more aggressive impeachment defense, the Wall Street Journal reported. But Republicans complained that they did not have talking points to follow and it was unclear whom, apart from Trump, they should be taking their cues from.\n\nOther planks of Trump\u2019s defensive strategy appear improvised. Steve Bannon, he of Trump\u2019s successful presidential campaign, has announced a daily radio show run from his basement to defend Trump, imagining it as \u201can outside war room\u201d. On the show, Bannon and his co-hosts have counseled Trump and Republicans to throttle back on the conspiracy theories, respect the political chops of the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and treat impeachment as a serious threat.\n\nAnd the South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham, a stalwart Trump defender, called a news conference on Thursday to announce that he would introduce a resolution in the Senate condemning the impeachment inquiry.\n\nGraham\u2019s rush for the cameras came in seeming response to mounting pressure on him, exerted by the Trump inner circle including Donald Trump Jr, to do more to protect the president, Axios reported.\n\nGraham had some advice for Trump this week, as well, telling reporters that it would be good for the White House to assemble a communications team with legal experience to be specially dedicated to impeachment.\n\nThe White House communications director, Stephanie Grisham, responded to that advice with an attack on Democrats.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to message anything that\u2019s going on behind closed doors and in secret,\u201d she was quoted by Bloomberg News as saying, ignoring the fact that 48 Republicans, including the vice-president\u2019s brother, sit behind those \u201cclosed doors\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re fighting a ghost. You\u2019re fighting against the air. So we\u2019re doing the best we can.\u201d", "description": "The charade may seem desperate, but it\u2019s a strategy straight out of Trump\u2019s playbook when he faced Mueller", "authors": ["Tom Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d1681898d04982f359e9072f2a3adcdf3bb4ef0/0_232_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0388a2ce2f76d989e95c820d757c4a2f", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
