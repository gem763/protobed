Giuliani and an Emirati princess. Aaron Blake sums up the latest developments of the impeachment inquiry. And Rick Maese explains how coastal sports teams are planning for climate change.\n\nPost Reports is the daily podcast from The Washington Post. Unparalleled reporting. Expert insight. Clear analysis. Everything you\u2019ve come to expect from the newsroom of The Post -- for your ears.\n\nAn Emirati princess and the president\u2019s personal attorney walk into the Trump hotel\n\nEmirati Princess Hend Al Qassemi had been in a child custody battle with her estranged husband for years. Desperate for help, she arrived at the Trump International Hotel in Washington on June 22. It was there that she happened to spot Rudolph W. Giuliani, personal attorney to the president of the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was one of those things that, when I first started looking into it, is something that you couldn't have made this up,\u201d says Post video reporter Dalton Bennett.\n\n\n\n\n\nHend had flown from Dubai to the Trump hotel in the hope that she would be able to receive help in her personal lawsuit by meeting Trump\u2019s personal lawyer.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis previously untold story, Bennett writes, is a \u201cvivid illustration of how the Trump hotel is perceived by some abroad as a portal to American power \u2014 and of how, in some cases, it can be exactly that.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe latest on the impeachment hearings\n\nClosed-door impeachment hearings on the Trump-Ukraine scandal continue. Tuesday\u2019s testimony from the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, William B. Taylor Jr., is being hailed \u201cas a complete game changer\u201d by Democrats, says senior political reporter Aaron Blake . Republican House members, however, cried foul about the private testimony.\n\n\n\n\n\nBlake breaks down what Congress learned from Tuesday\u2019s hearing and what to expect the rest of the week. He adds that the opening statement from Taylor revealed the ambassador\u2019s suspicions that \u201cthere was quid pro quos, that shady things were happening and also that he was privy to some of them.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe House launched a formal impeachment investigation of the president last month after Trump apparently pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into investigating Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in the country, while withholding financial aid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBill Taylor is not just talking about the idea that military aid was being withheld for leverage or that a meeting was being withheld for leverage,\u201d Blake says. \u201cHe actually described how this was communicated to Ukrainian officials, which would be understood, at least to Ukraine, as a potential quid pro quo.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanning for climate change\n\nAs waters rise, coastal teams such as the Oakland Athletics are investing money in stadium infrastructure intended to withstand the test of time.\n\n\n\n\n\nSports reporter Rick Maese has been examining how climate change is affecting the world of sports. \u201cFor this one, we wanted to see now just how rising sea levels are going to impact not just the sports world,\u201d Maese says, \u201cbut the economics that keep the sports world afloat.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:", "description": "Dalton Bennett on the unexpected meeting between Rudolph W.
