And even if you pay somebody to maintain your car, it\u2019s important to know the age and condition of your car\u2019s various bloods.\n\nChanging your car\u2019s fluids is critical, and, usually, designed to be pretty easy. Your oil, brake and clutch fluid, transmission fluid, coolant and even power steering fluid are meant to be serviced, and changing them on time keeps your car sweet and responsive for more kilometres. But it still leaves you with vessels of toxic poison to dispose of. Here\u2019s a front to back guide on what to do there.\n\nWhy Flush Fluids\n\nAll automotive fluids expire after so many heat cycles and months in service. It happens to your motor oil going sludgy; it happens to everything.\n\nCar fluids are chemically engineered to flow a certain way and maintain specific temperatures. As they age, they lose these properties and become less effective. As that happens, the components they\u2019re in wear down more quickly and don\u2019t work as well as they should.\n\nBrake fluid, for example, has a high boiling point, low viscosity, and anti-corrosive properties. When you hit the brake pedal over and over again, the fluid that flows down to your brakes to clamp them closed gets hot. That\u2019s not a problem when the fluid\u2019s clean.\n\nBut brake fluid is hygroscopic, which means water in the air eventually contaminates it. Once that starts to happen, it boils more easily. If your brake fluid boils, there will be less of it, and air bubbles, in your brake system. By then, if you go to pump the brake pedal, there will be less juice to flow to the brake caliper, and that will mean you won\u2019t be stopping in a hurry.\n\nSplurging on a $15 bottle of brake fluid every few years could make the difference between your brakes working well enough to prevent a crash, or, not.\n\nWhen It\u2019s Time For New Fluid\n\nGenerally speaking, automotive fluids start clear or nearly-clear and get darker as they age. You usually pour them in looking like light beer, and you want to change them when they start to have around the opacity of a lager. By the time they look like Guinness, you definitely want to think about refreshing.\n\nBut actually, you\u2019re just going to want to Google around for your car\u2019s factory service manual then consult said manual\u2019s index. The correct change intervals will be findable from there, and that book will tell you exactly what type of fluid you\u2019ll want to add, which is important too.\n\nIf you\u2019ve got a new-to-you used car and you don\u2019t know how old its fluids are, it\u2019s not a bad idea to baseline everything and do a full refresh.\n\nWhy Flush Fluids Yourself\n\nChanging fluids on most cars isn\u2019t hard, but it is time-consuming. That makes it the perfect task to avoid outsourcing since you might pay a lot for labour time on something you might be able to do yourself.\n\nBut more significantly, if you change your own fluids, you get to pick out the best chemicals for your car. And you\u2019ll get very familiar with the underside and underhood areas of the machine.\n\nWhy Have A Pro Flush Fluids\n\nAgain, changing fluids on most cars isn\u2019t hard, but it is time-consuming. Some people find their time more precious than a mechanic\u2019s fees, so if that describes you, go ahead and outsource.\n\nIt\u2019s also pretty icky \u2013 dealing with toxic fluids isn\u2019t everybody\u2019s bag, nor is rolling around under your car, and it can be hard to grab a buddy to bleed brakes with you.\n\nDon\u2019t let anybody shame you into feeling like you\u2019re not a \u201creal car enthusiast\u201d if you don\u2019t change your own oil. But do take the time to research a reputable repair shop, maybe even one that specialises in your type of car, if you want someone else to do it.\n\nHow To Prepare To Deal With Fluids\n\nAssuming you do decide to attempt your own fluid flushing, let me emphasise the most important piece of advice in this post: Always wear eye protection and skin protection when doing this kind of work.\n\nOnce more, for the people in the back: Get good safety goggles and gloves, and wear them, before you start cracking drain plugs. The time I got carburetor cleaner in my eyeball was one of the most painful experiences of my life, and that\u2019s saying something... I\u2019ve had a UTV roll over onto my hand, I\u2019ve had my AC joint split by a kangaroo, I\u2019ve had my share of knockouts and pain.\n\nAnyway, besides being suited up like it\u2019s eighth-grade chemistry class, make sure you\u2019ve got plenty of trashy rags around and a good vessel to catch old fluid in.\n\nI\u2019d recommend using a vessel you don\u2019t mind surrendering when you dispose of your waste fluids, as some places might make you just leave your whole bucket. More on that later. Whatever bucket you do use, keep in mind that the fluids you\u2019ll be catching are caustic enough to eat through some plastics.\n\nA glass jar might be a good option if you can find a cheap one. Finally, you\u2019re going to have to cart this to a disposal site, so use something that won\u2019t easily be spilled from.\n\nDraining And Refilling\n\nEach car and, of course, each component is going to have its own flushing process. Consult that factory service manual I mentioned for specific instructions and online forums for people who own your kind of car for wisdom that might help you preemptively prevent mistakes.\n\nGenerally speaking, you\u2019re going to want to avoid letting a hydraulic accessory run completely dry, and never start a car with any of its fluids depleted.\n\nHow To Figure Out How To Dispose Of Fluids\n\nPretty much every home-wrenching car enthusiast I talked to gave me the same response when I asked what to do with old auto fluids, something to the effect of \u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019ve just got a big vat in my garage.\u201d\n\nListen, you don\u2019t have to live like that.\n\nPretty much any auto parts store will take used motor oil, which is fairly common knowledge, but it\u2019s not that much harder to find out where brake fluid, coolant, and all the other juices need to go when they go bad.\n\nStart by Googling household waste collections in your area. Auto fluids are typically considered \u201chousehold waste\u201d and while they can\u2019t go in your regular trash, your town or a town nearby will have some provision for taking it which I bet you\u2019ll find by searching \u201cyour town + waste disposal\u201d or something similar.\n\nBigger cities will have permanent collection centres for such things. You can start by calling or emailing your local council, or skip straight to your local sanitation department if you can find its number.\n\nNow that I know my truck\u2019s got fresh brake fluid I can rest easily knowing not only that I\u2019ll be stopping as well as I can, but also that I can throw out the toxic old fluid legally and ethically without being inconvenienced that much. It feels good!\n\nIf nothing else, disposing of your chemicals the right way makes all auto enthusiasts look good. Dumping it in a big puddle behind your house makes us look like greasy cretins.
