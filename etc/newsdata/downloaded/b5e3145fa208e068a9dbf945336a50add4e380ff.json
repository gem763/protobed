The best currently easy access account actually comes with both\n\nThe table-topping savings deals and their catches\n\nCoventry Building Society has bumped up the rate on its triple access account in line with its Isa offering, which means both now pay a market-leading 1.46 per cent.\n\nThe mutual offers savers a better rate than Goldman Sachs' Marcus and other big names like Investec Bank and Virgin Money, but both versions of the account come with some pitfalls.\n\nThe account allows holders access to their money only three times a year, and it also contains a bonus rate.\n\nThe bonus rate of 0.31 per cent expires at the end of January 2021 in the case of the tax-free account, and the end of March 2021 when it comes to the regular savings account.\n\nCaveats such as the limit on withdrawals and a temporary bonus rate are commonplace at the top of the easy access tables at the moment.\n\nIndeed no less than five accounts with the best rates in our easy access tables; Coventry, Cynergy Bank, Marcus Bank, Saga \u2013 which is also a Marcus-backed account \u2013 and Principality Building Society, come with bonus rates of varying lengths.\n\nThis is less the case in the Isa market, but in both instances there are also a number of top-paying accounts where the trade-off for a better rate is less access to your money.\n\nFive of the top easy access accounts out there come with temporary bonus rates\n\nSome of these restrictions can be a little confusing and east to fall foul of\n\nFor example, like Virgin Money's savings account and Isa account, which let you make two withdrawals a year, simply ban you from making any more.\n\nSainsbury's Bank's Defined Access Saver, cuts the rate on your savings from 1.29 per cent to 0.5 per cent once you've made more than three withdrawals a year.\n\nOne last account to be aware of is Yorkshire Building Society's One Year Limited Access Saver, paying 1.4 per cent, which lets you make as many withdrawals as you want but only on one day of the year. This account after 12 months is also transferred to an older version paying 1.1 per cent.\n\nThree quirky accounts to get better rates\n\nThe accounts above may seem relatively simple compared to some of the even more unusual ones on offer.\n\nWe have rounded up three of them below, that may be worth considering despite their complexity.\n\nThis account has so many moving parts you could probably devote 1,500 words to it on its own but Anna Bowes of Savings Champion notes, 'once you get your head around it, I think it's a cracking account'.\n\nThe account is a notice account, which means you must tell the bank you want to withdraw money a certain period of time in advance, but it also contains an easy access element and a loyalty rate.\n\nBowes said: 'The rates on offer depend on the notice period you choose for the bulk of the savings and the amount you would like to have easy access to, which can be up to 20 per cent.\n\n'In addition, a loyalty rate of an extra 0.05 per cent will be paid after 90 days, if no notice is placed.'\n\nThe Investec Notice Plus Account takes a bit of time to get your head around, as it lets you pick your notice period and how much of your balance you can access straightaway, but it could be an option for those with larger balances who want a better rate\n\nYou can choose to have easy access to either 0 per cent of the money deposited, 10 per cent or 20 per cent, with an interest penalty on a sliding scale depending on what you choose.\n\nEssentially the headline figure if you choose 95 days notice, the longest notice term, is you can get an account paying 1.7 per cent, where a fifth of your balance can be accessed immediately.\n\nThis rate increases to 1.75 per cent if you don't attempt to make a notice withdrawal in the first 90 days.\n\nThe easy access facility doesn't affect the loyalty rate.\n\nThere are some caveats. The minimum deposit amount is \u00a310,000 which means it isn't for everyone, while if you make an easy access withdrawal, Bowes said, 'you cannot make another one for the number of days of your chosen notice period, even if you withdraw less than your chosen immediate access percentage.\n\n'You will have to wait for the number of days of your chosen notice period to make another immediate access withdrawal, but that can be up to 10 per cent or 20 per cent of the new balance.'\n\nTo use an example, if you deposit \u00a3100,000 into the 95 day notice option and give yourself instant access to 20 per cent of the balance, then for the first 90 days a rate of 1.7 per cent is paid. After that it increases to 1.75 per cent.\n\nIf you made an easy access withdrawal of \u00a310,000 on day 60, you couldn't make a withdrawal of the other \u00a310,000 making up that 20 per cent easy access portion for another 95 days. After those 95 days another easy access withdrawal of up to \u00a318,000 can be made, which is 20 per cent of the \u00a390,000 new balance.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThese accounts from an Epsom building society are basically the opposite of Investec's account. That requires you to make all the decisions, but Family Building Society does the sums for you.\n\nAvailable in both regular and tax-free varieties from \u00a3500, with the latter currently offering a better interest rate, the account attempts to save you the hassle of worrying about temporary bonus rates and switching accounts by tracking the savings market.\n\nThe Market Tracker Saver takes Moneyfacts data and pays an average interest rate of the 20 best easy access rates, while the Tracker Isa uses that data and then tacks on an extra 0.05 per cent.\n\nThe saver currently pays 1.29 per cent, and the Isa 1.34 per cent. The rates are updated four times a year, in March, June, September and December.\n\nBoth accounts can be applied for online, by post or in its branch, while the Isa accepts transfers. The accounts are both easy access, but you must withdraw a minimum of \u00a3500 each time.\n\nFord Money doesn't tend to take pole position in the best buy race but is often in the chasing pack offering decent rates.\n\nThe bank offers 1.27 per cent on its easy access cash Isa, the eight-highest rate in our tables, and its 1.55 per cent two year fixed-rate is the ninth-best offer.\n\nWhat makes its offers really valuable though is that you could combine those two different flavour of Isa under one umbrella, whereas normally as you can only pay into one cash Isa each tax year you are restricted to picking between a fix and an easy access deal.\n\nThis portfolio Isa gives savers a solution to the dilemma of choosing whether to save into a fixed-rate or easy access Isa.\n\nThis is Money covered this in-depth back in April, and Ford Money's chief deposits officer Suzanne Lewsley explained at the time how it could work. She said: 'One example of this in action would be if you had \u00a320,000 to invest, but did not want to lock it all away for a fixed term.\n\n'You could split your cash between several products. This could mean putting \u00a35,000 in an easy access Isa, \u00a35,000 in a one-year fixed-rate cash Isa, and the remaining \u00a310,000 in a two-year fixed-rate.\n\n'This means savers can combine fixed and variable rate Isa products, accessing different rates and different types of product benefits.'\n\nFord Money pays the best easy access rate of any of the providers which offer this service, while Kent Reliance \u2013 which pays a 1.15 per cent on an easy access Isa and 1.4 per cent on a one year fix \u2013 Newcastle Building Society, Charter Savings Bank and Nationwide are among some of the others.\n\nObviously none of the three accounts we've outlined necessarily top the best buy tables, but if you're fed up with teaser rates and easy access accounts with withdrawal limits, they might be worth considering.", "description": "Limits are commonplace among top savings deals but there are others that come with even more hoops to jump through and might be worth taking.", "authors": ["George Nixon For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
