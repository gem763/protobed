The sadness I felt was matched by a macabre desire to learn that his death was a violent one. (It was not. He died of cancer.) That feeling returned each time a relatively young person I knew died and I didn\u2019t yet know the cause of death. And despite the reality that black women and girls are hypervulnerable to homicide, too (their homicide rate in 2016 was 5 per 100,000, triple the rate for white women and girls), I react this way only when it\u2019s black men in their 30s and 40s like me, who performed some sort of hood alchemy to escape their teens and early 20s without becoming \u201cR.I.P.\u201d T-shirted.\n\nI\u2019m not certain why I do this, but I have a theory: I\u2019ve learned to associate black maleness with early death. And because I\u2019m so familiar with the possibility of violence, I\u2019ve convinced myself that I can avert it. I can sense when the stillness of the street is a precursor to danger, like the moment before a storm hits and the air adopts a menacing tranquillity. I know the shuffle of someone carrying them tools in baggy jeans. I can feel it when the clamor at a nightclub shifts from festive to menacing. I know how to run. I know how to sit in public spaces (with my back facing a wall, so that I can see everything). I know how to park in lots (with the back in first, to make a quick getaway if necessary). I know how to look like I know how to fight. Of course, none of this matters if a stray bullet has my name on it. But I believe it does, and that belief has been a security blanket.\n\nBut how do you duck from a stroke? How do you run when cancer decides to chase you? How do you mean-mug a blood clot?\n\nThere are measures you can take to decrease the likelihood of dying that way. Doctors you can see. Pills you can swallow. Kale you can eat. But the same ecosystem of susceptibilities that heightens the risk of violent death at 17 just transfers that risk inside our adult bodies. We age out of bullets and into high blood pressure. And so, when I hear about another death, a part of me prays it was murder sometimes because the thought of a 37-year-old ex-teammate dying that way is less scary than an undetected tumor or a diabetic coma. I pray for murder sometimes because violence is a familiar phantasm \u2014 a ghoul you loathe, sure, but know well enough to maybe share a laugh with it at lunch. But this new terror? I pray for murder sometimes because dying any other way when you\u2019re black and male and 29 or 41 just isn\u2019t fair.\n\nTwo months ago, I was sitting in a Whole Foods parking lot and browsing Facebook when I learned of the death of a 39-year-old I\u2019d known since we were in our early teens. We\u2019d played with and against each other on basketball teams at the Homewood Y.M.C.A. and the Shadyside Boys & Girls Club, in high school, summer leagues, fall leagues and over-30 leagues. We were never close, but always cool. He was also active \u2014 still hooping and playing baseball and still coaching \u2014 and looked to be in good shape. The last time I\u2019d seen him, I think, was at the LA Fitness in Bakery Square last year. Cause of death? Heart attack.\n\nThe Whole Foods visit is a part of my evening routine. I stop there when I leave the gym, mostly because their salad bar makes me feel grown. As usual, I\u2019d backed into my parking space, so I was facing the store\u2019s entrance when I read the news, watching the (mostly) white customers enter and exit. One was holding an avocado. I remembered that my doctor shared that they were a source of healthy fats.\n\nI also remember now as I write this that there is a paradox of refreshing these sorts of memories in front of (white) people anxious to consume them. Do I attempt to alleviate some of this mess about black death by writing through it in public, as I\u2019m wont to do when stuff needs working through? Or do I swallow it and pretend it isn\u2019t gnawing at me, because I can\u2019t let them see me \u2014 see us \u2014 sweat?\n\nI don\u2019t know. I do know that the need for quick getaways sometimes feels foolish when I\u2019m at Whole Foods or dropping my daughter off at preschool now. But the familiarity of it makes me feel like \u201cI got this.\u201d Makes me remember what I\u2019ve escaped. Makes me feel safe. Makes me forget that I never will be.\n\nDamon Young (@DamonYoungVSB) is the author of \u201cWhat Doesn\u2019t Kill You Makes You Blacker\u201d and a founder of VerySmartBrothas.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
