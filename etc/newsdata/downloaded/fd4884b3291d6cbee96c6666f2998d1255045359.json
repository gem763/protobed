Or at least it was until September, when a dramatic market shift took place as investors rotated out of proven winners.\n\nGoldman chief US equity strategist David Kostin says that the high-quality strategy isn't dead, although he does see it becoming increasingly difficult to find stocks that are priced affordably and primed for outperformance.\n\nHe says one way to identify those is by assessing return on equity, a measurement of a company's ability to deliver earnings growth from its investments. High-ROE stocks represent a subset of the so-called quality strategy that are still attractively priced, according to Kostin.\n\n\"High returns on capital is one representation of 'quality' that still trades at a reasonable valuation,\" Kostin said in a note to clients.\n\nHe continued: \"We expect investors will continue to assign a scarcity premium to stocks with high ROE.\"\n\nTo that end, here are seven stocks identified by Kostin as offering the strongest ROE growth over the next 12 months. They're ranked in increasing order of future ROE growth.", "description": "The firm names a group of stocks that offer strong returns on equity, a key measurement of company quality that isn't overvalued by investors.", "authors": ["Marley Jay"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5331d0c569bedd6462203660-1334-667.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
