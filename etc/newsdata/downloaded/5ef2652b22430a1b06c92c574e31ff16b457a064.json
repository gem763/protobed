(Jeff Chiu/AP)\n\nTwitter CEO and co-founder Jack Dorsey\u2019s account was hacked Friday, demonstrating the potential vulnerabilities of even the most high-profile social media accounts.\n\nStarting Friday afternoon, Dorsey\u2019s @jack account began unleashing a stream of more than a dozen tweets and retweets, including obscenities, shout-outs, threats and racial slurs. The tweets remained on the account, which has 4.2 million followers, for less than an hour before Twitter removed them.\n\n\u201cIntel is there\u2019s a bomb at Twitter HQ,\u201d read one of the tweets. \u201cShoutout to Ron and Kyle,\u201d another said. Many of the tweets were tagged with #ChucklingHella.\n\n[Twitter adds labels for tweets that break its rules \u2014 a move with potentially stark implications for Trump\u2019s account]\n\nThe company said in a tweet Friday evening that the phone number associated with Dorsey\u2019s account \u201cwas compromised due to a security oversight by the mobile provider.\u201d The hacker was then able to use the phone number to compose and send tweets via text message using the platform\u2019s tweet-via-SMS feature.\n\nTwitter said the issue has been resolved, and that there is no indication their systems were compromised.\n\nIn a statement, a Twitter spokeswoman added that the company looked into the bomb threat and \u201ccan confirm it was not credible.\u201d The accounts mentioned by the hacker while controlling @jack appeared to be suspended Friday afternoon.\n\nDorsey\u2019s account was previously compromised in 2016 by the hacking group OurMine.\n\n[Twitter bans dehumanizing posts about religious groups]\n\nThe event raises questions about vulnerability of even high-profile accounts at one of the largest social media companies in the world. Dorsey\u2019s account \u2014 like other high-profile accounts \u2014 was an obvious target, and likely well-shielded. Political leaders, including President Trump, use the platform to share news and opinions. If compromised, a hacker could use the account to make political claims or even try to start a war.\n\nIt was also unclear why the tweets \u2014 which violated numerous rules with offensive language and even included a pro-Nazi retweet \u2014 stayed up so long. Twitter has previously boasted about tools to quickly catch policy-violating content.\n\nThe phone number associated with the account was compromised due to a security oversight by the mobile provider. This allowed an unauthorized person to compose and send tweets via text message from the phone number. That issue is now resolved. \u2014 Twitter Comms (@TwitterComms) August 31, 2019\n\nThe hack also comes at a time when social media companies are under intense public pressure to implement more effective content-monitoring procedures. The platforms have struggled to balance policing extremism and hate speech \u2014 such as the content posted by Dorsey\u2019s hacked account \u2014 with creating a forum for free expression.\n\nIn June, Twitter announced it would begin labeling rule-breaking tweets from national political figures, including Trump, with a message that says: \u201cThe Twitter Rules about abusive behavior apply to this Tweet. However, Twitter has determined that it may be in the public\u2019s interest for the Tweet to remain available.\u201d The company also said its algorithms would de-prioritize such tweets so the content is circulated to fewer people.\n\n[Twitter and Facebook take first actions against China for using fake accounts to sow discord in Hong Kong]\n\nThe next month, Twitter updated its policies to ban users from tweeting language that dehumanizes people based on religion. The company said the ban would eventually expand to other types of dehumanizing language.\n\nOn Friday, several Twitter users noted with irony that the hacked @jack account was tweeting slurs and threats while this message remained pinned to his profile: \u201cWe\u2019re committing Twitter to help increase the collective health, openness, and civility of public conversation, and to hold ourselves publicly accountable towards progress.\u201d", "description": "Twitter co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey\u2019s Twitter account was hacked Friday.", "authors": ["Marie C.
