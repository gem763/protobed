Sanders defender, but I think he can be given some leeway here,\u201d Stephen Cobb, who also served as a Virginia deputy attorney general, told Hill.TV. \u201cAnd, yes, they\u2019re trying to figure out what the campaign looks like going forward.\u201d\n\n\"It\u2019s not 100 percent surprising that the first statement was a little different than how things are actually playing out,\" he added.\n\nSeveral news outlets, including Politico, accused the Sanders campaign of trying to hide his heart attack.\n\nNina Turner, co-chairwoman of Sanders's presidential campaign, dismissed this criticism in an interview with Hill.TV, calling such remarks \u201casinine.\u201d\n\nSanders himself called these claims \u201cnonsense\u201d and defended his campaign\u2019s handling of his hospitalization, telling NBC News on Wednesday that it had \u201cacted appropriately.\u201d\n\nDuring that same interview, he also appeared to backtrack on previous comments about scaling back his campaign, vowing to continue a \u201cvery vigorous campaign.\u201d\n\n\u201cI misspoke the other day. I said a word I should not have said and media drives me a little nuts to make a big deal about it,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get back into the groove of a very vigorous campaign.\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019s hospitalization has put renewed focus on age and health in the 2020 Democratic primary. The Vermont senator, 78, has polled consistently among the top three contenders in the race \u2014 all of whom are in their 70s.\n\n\u2014Tess Bonn", "description": "A former senior adviser in the Obama administration called on the media to give Sen.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/sandersbernie_090319gn13_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
