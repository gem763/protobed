Bush and met Brouillette at that time. [That's] certainly true of David Bernhardt and Andy Wheeler. Dan Brouillette is in that same mold.\u201c\n\nAs Perry's deputy, Brouillette has been one of the administration\u2019s point people in promoting U.S. LNG exports as a way for European countries to reduce their dependence on Russian gas.\n\nBrouillette has criticized the Russia-to-Germany Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, and at a gas conference in Germany earlier this year, he referred to reliance on Russian gas as \"a strategic liability.\u201d\n\nBrouillette has a reputation around Washington as a pragmatist who can break through policy log jams. During the Bush administration, he was a key figure in laying the groundwork for what became the 2005 Energy Policy Act. The law, which expanded DOE\u2019s research and development authority, first began to take shape while Brouillette was assistant secretary for congressional and intergovernmental affairs at DOE, a post he held from 2001 through 2003.\n\nTauzin said Brouillette helped get the bill through a House-Senate conference, and resulting bill passed in the House.\n\n\u201cWe had tried a number of times to do that, and it was only when I brought Dan in as chief of staff that we succeeded,\u201d Tauzin said.\n\nTauzin\u2019s version failed in the Senate by two votes, but a similar bill passed the next year after both Tauzin and Brouillette left Congress. By then, Brouillette had become vice president of Ford\u2019s federal affairs office, where he participated in negotiations over the Energy Policy Act of 2007, which expanded fuel economy programs and the nation's biofuels program, the Renewable Fuel Standard.\n\nBrouillette was confirmed to the No. 2 job at DOE in a bipartisan 79-17 vote in the Senate in August 2017.\n\nBrouillette has nine children, all of whom he and his wife home-schooled, according to Tauzin.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/ba/18/a427efe54fc4a797bb71227d0cbf/191018-dan-brouillette-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
