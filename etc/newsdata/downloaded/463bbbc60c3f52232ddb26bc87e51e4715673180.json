Her lawyer says all involved in the adoption case knew she was in fact alive and that a fake NGO engineered the adoption without her consent.\n\n\n\nThe mother's case is not unique \u2013 as outlined in an Al Jazeera Faultlines investigation that won a News and Documentary Emmy on September 24. In 'Adoption Inc: The Baby Business', Anna Cavell uncovered cases of fraud and exploitation in adoptions between Uganda to the US. In one case, two parents thought they were sending their children to boarding school \u2013 only for them to be legally adopted and sent to the United States without their knowledge and consent.\n\n\n\nOn Monday we'll look at the human impact of contentious adoption cases in Uganda and what is needed to safeguard the rights of parents and children.
