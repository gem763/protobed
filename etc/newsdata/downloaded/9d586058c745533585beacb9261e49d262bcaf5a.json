The reserves rose in August, and state media at the time heralded it as a sign that China was doing a better job at hedging against financial risks.\n\nChina introduced strict capital outflow controls in 2016, enabling it to maintain stability in the amount of money leaving the country despite its trade war with the United States.\n\nOfficials from China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) said total foreign currency reserves were up US$19.7 billion, or 0.6 per cent, since the start of 2019, but did not detail month-to-month movements.\n\n\"Factors including the global economic growth, monetary policies of major countries, the global trade situation and geopolitics led to the rise in the US dollar index and the drop in bond prices of major countries,\" SAFE spokesman Wang Chunying was quoted as saying in state media.\n\nHe insisted China's foreign exchange reserves were generally stable, with small fluctuations in the scale of reserves affected mainly by valuation.\n\nThe ongoing trade spat is casting an ominous shadow over the global economy. AP\n\nChina will release quarterly GDP data in 10 days. Beijing has forecast 6 per cent growth for 2019, although trade tensions with the United States could make this difficult to achieve. Senior US-China trade negotiators are scheduled to meet in Washington this week before the latest round of US tariffs on Chinese goods come into effect.\n\nCapital Economics estimated China sold US$20 to US$25 billion of reserves in August, but the actual size of foreign exchange intervention would not be known until the People's Bank of China (PBOC) publishes its balance sheet later in the month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe PBOC has not sold or bought foreign exchange in any meaningful amounts this year and it appears that did not change last month,\" Julian Evans-Pritchard, Capital Economics senior China economist, said.\n\n\"In the statement accompanying the reserve data release, the PBOC said that the change in the headline FX reserves was the result of valuation effects.\"\n\nHe estimated trade tensions would likely flare up again, putting renewed downward pressure on the renminbi.\n\nIran said this week China\u2019s state oil company withdrew from a US$5 billion deal to develop part of the country\u2019s offshore natural gas field. There have also been reports of some major Belt and Road infrastructure projects being halted before completion which suggests Beijing is taking a more cautious approach to overseas spending.", "description": "While China attributed the decline to currency fluctuations, some economists were sceptical after the yuan bounced back in September from a sharp fall the previous month.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3027%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_58/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/84354ca5ea12e5f30ac549efa00fbe288c1018f2", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
