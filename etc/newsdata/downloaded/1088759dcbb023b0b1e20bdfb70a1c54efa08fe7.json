Subleasing the appearance of good governance from some Clinton-era fossil without one iota of fiduciary responsibility. What a joke. Was Jimmy Cayne too busy playing bridge? \u201cI was impressed with the company being principled,\u201d Summers told this newspaper. That and his new (invisible) stock options.\n\nRemember, this is the guy who helped broker the removal of barriers between US retail and investment banking. \u201cThis historic legislation,\u201d he said of the Glass-Steagall Act\u2019s repeal in 1999, \u201cwill better enable American companies to compete in the new economy.\u201d And 10 years later, to blow it sky high.\n\nThen, as Harvard president, Summers resigned after suggesting \u201cthere are issues of intrinsic aptitude\u201d explaining why women were under-represented in the senior ranks of science and engineering. Has Afterpay\u2019s chairman Elana Rubin considered the kind of message Summers\u2019 bought endorsement would send the company\u2019s female software engineers (if they had any)? Or did that consideration simply not pass through (what Larry considers) Rubin's inferior lady-brain?\n\nFinally, on Wednesday, Tom Beadle and Jonathan Mott of UBS became the first banking and credit analysts to initiate research on Afterpay, giving it a 12-month price target of $17.25, 52.8 per cent south of Tuesday\u2019s $36.56 closing price.\n\nSome would say that\u2019s generous! Their modelling relies on Afterpay having 5 per cent of US adults spending $2800 a year on the platform by 2030 and for its revenue to hold at 4 per cent of total transaction value right out to 2025. But Klarna, its much larger rival in that market, already has a rack rate for merchants of 2.3 per cent. If Afterpay can maintain its income at 4 per cent, we\u2019ll throw a garden party for Nick Molnar at Camp David.\n\nAfterpay has since fallen to $31.98, down 12.5 per cent. Motion sickness, anyone? And AUSTRAC's only just getting warmed up. Hey, regardless of where you\u2019re sitting, this is easily the best ride in the park.", "description": "Subleasing the appearance of good governance from some Clinton-era fossil, can Anthony Eisen and his cast of spinners dance or what?!", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6255%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_102/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/48452110b54a30fe02b67ee138de6df2c7bf8818", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
