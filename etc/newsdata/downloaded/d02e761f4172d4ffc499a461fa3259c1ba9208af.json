And EU officials have not yet responded to Johnson's reluctant request for an extension of the month's end deadline.\n\n\"The can is not kicked far down the road with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson expected to seek a new 'meaningful vote' on his deal as soon as Monday with the countdown to the Brexit deadline,\" Jingyi Pan of IG said in a commentary.\n\nIn this Oct. 11, 2019, photo, a man walks past an electronic stock board showing Japan's Nikkei 225 index and other Asian market index at a securities firm in Tokyo.

The resulting deficit of 123 billion yen ($1.1 billion) reflected weak exports to China, South Korea and other Asian countries, customs data showed.\n\nThe mixed performance to start the week is a continuation of the wobbles that ended last week, when the S&P 500 index logged its second straight weekly gain even though stock indexes ended lower on Friday.\n\nTechnology companies led the slide, which erased the major U.S. indexes' gains from the day before. Communication services, industrials and health care stocks also fell, outweighing gains in real estate companies, banks and elsewhere in the market.\n\nInvestors are focusing on company earnings reports, searching for a clearer picture on the impact that the trade war between the U.S. and China is having on corporate profits and the broader economy.\n\nThe S&P 500 index fell 0.4% to 2,986.20. The index is just 1.3% below its all-time high set in late July.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1% to 26,770.20 and the Nasdaq lost 0.8%, to 8,089.54. The Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks gave up 0.4% to 1,535.48.\n\nUncertainty over the standoff between Beijing and Washington has been roiling markets.
