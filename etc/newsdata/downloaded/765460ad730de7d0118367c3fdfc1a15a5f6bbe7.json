Our editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, said: \u201cWe want to ensure that we are being scientifically precise, while also communicating clearly with readers on this very important issue.\u201d These are the guidelines provided to our journalists and editors to be used in the production of all environment coverage across the Guardian\u2019s website and paper:\n\n\u201cThe urgency of climate crisis needed robust new language to describe it,\u201d the Guardian reported.\n\n\u2022 Climate emergency\u201d or \u201cclimate crisis\u201d will be used instead of \u201cclimate change.\u201d\n\nClimate change is no longer considered to accurately reflect the seriousness of the overall situation; use climate emergency or climate crisis instead to describe the broader impact of climate change. However, use climate breakdown or climate change or global heating when describing it specifically in a scientific or geophysical sense eg \u201cScientists say climate breakdown has led to an increase in the intensity of hurricanes.\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u201cClimate science denier\u201d or \u201cclimate denier\u201d to be used instead of \u201cclimate sceptic.\u201d\n\nThe OED (Oxford English Dictionary) defines a sceptic as \u201ca seeker of the truth; an inquirer who has not yet arrived at definite conclusions\u201d. Most \u201cclimate sceptics,\u201d in the face of overwhelming scientific evidence, deny climate change is happening, or is caused by human activity, so \u2018denier\u2019 is more accurate.\n\n\u2022 \u201cUse \u201cglobal heating\u201d not \u201cglobal warming.\u201d\n\n\u2018Global heating\u2019 is more scientifically accurate. Greenhouse gases form an atmospheric blanket that stops the sun\u2019s heat escaping back to space.\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u201cGreenhouse gas emissions\u201d is preferred to \u201ccarbon emissions\u201d or \u201ccarbon dioxide emissions.\u201d Although carbon emissions is not inaccurate, if we\u2019re talking about all gases that warm the atmosphere, this term recognizes all of the climate-damaging gases, including methane, nitrogen oxides, CFCs etc.\u201d\n\nAnd the Guardian believes emotion-evoking animals in its reporting will serve a purpose.\n\n\u2022 Use \u201cwildlife,\u201d not \u201cbiodiversity.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe felt that \u2018wildlife\u2019 is a much more accessible word and is fair to use in many stories, and is a it less clinical when talking about all the creatures with whom we share the planet.\n\n\u2022 Use \u201cfish populations\u201d instead of \u201cfish stocks.\u201d\n\nThis change emphasizes that fish do not exist solely to be harvested by humans \u2013 they play a vital role in the natural health of the oceans.\n\n\u201cToday we pledge to give the climate crisis the attention it demands,\u201d Viner said. \u201cPeople need reminding that the climate crisis is no longer a future problem \u2013 we need to tackle it now, and every day matters.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince we announced these changes, they have been reported widely, shared across social media channels, and even prompted some other media outlets to reconsider the terms they use in their own coverage,\u201d the Guardian reported, adding that it is now incorporating CO2 levels to its weather coverage.\n\n\u201cIn order to keep below 1.5C of warming, the aspiration of the world\u2019s nations, we need to halve emissions by 2030 and reach zero by mid century,\u201d the Guardian reported. It is also likely we will need to remove CO2 from the atmosphere, perhaps by the large-scale restoration of nature. It is a huge task, but we hope that tracking the daily rise of CO2 will help to maintain focus on it.\u201d\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter", "description": "The Guardian newspaper announced it is changing its style rules to reflect that it is not \"climate change\" but a \"climate emergency.\"", "authors": ["Penny Starr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/07/climate-change-global-warming-protest-polar-bear-ap.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
