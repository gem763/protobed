The bill is currently paused while Johnson waits to hear what, if any, extension the EU will grant. He was forced by U.K. law to request one in order to avoid the U.K. leaving without a deal on October 31.\n\nEU leaders are keen not to be drawn into the U.K.\u2019s internal political disputes and are unlikely to be swayed by any of Johnson\u2019s personal entreaties, senior EU officials and diplomats said.\n\nTusk tweeted that he explained to Johnson why he is recommending the EU27 accept the U.K.'s extension request. EU ambassadors are scheduled to meet at 5:30 p.m. Brussels time this afternoon to discuss the request.\n\nEarlier, a spokesperson for the Irish government said Varadkar supports an extension until January 31, as suggested by U.K. law.", "description": "However, European Council President Donald Tusk says he will recommend EU leaders approve a delay.", "authors": ["Eleni Courea", "Emilio Casalicchio", "David M.
