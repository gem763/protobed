It continues to be range-bound but well above resistance levels of August, although it\u2019s unable to mount a serious challenge to forge new records on the upside.\n\nPerhaps what\u2019s more telling for investors isn\u2019t the resolve of stocks, but panic assets giving up the ghost. Gold shed 1.9% to close at $1,510. Bitcoin (BTC) meandered but has given up huge gains since peaking in June.\n\nOn June 25th, Bitcoin closed at $12,913, after hitting an intra-day high of $13,826. I was impressed by how well the cryptocurrency performed at the height of the recession talk, rallying more than its safe-haven rival Gold, which also posted strong gains. Bitcoin ended 2018 at $3,686. Even at $8,437, this has been an impressive year, but I am not sure if it\u2019s the coming-out party that it appeared to be in the early days of summer.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum are old-school Financials, which have lost so much of their old cache. It\u2019s not just cryptocurrencies and direct stock listings, but the move into Fintech also possess real competition. However, valuations and potential speak louder now than lame investment propositions, such as buying banks on a hunch where there would be higher interest rates.\n\nWe added a new Financial idea to the model portfolio, leaving cash at the lowest level in some time.\n\nHome Sweet Home - Homebuilder Stocks\n\nThe stealth rally in homebuilder stocks is now gaining the attention of a wider audience. After the close, KB Home (KBH) posted very impressive financial results and solid guidance.\n\nFourth Quarter 2019 (4Q19) Guidance:\n\nRevenue: $1.64 billion, Street: $1.53 billion\n\nAverage Selling Price: $410,000 +19,5%\n\nOperating Margin of 10.5%\n\nCommunity Count: +10%\n\nManagement is focused on taking market share, which could be good news for homebuyers, as median prices have far outpaced incomes over the past decade. The shares were a little lower, but the fundamentals for the company and industry have gotten better.\n\nScrambling\n\nI was accused of being heartless earlier this week when I said it was a blessing that many people (myself included) have multiple jobs. Of course, those working two jobs simply to survive are obviously struggling. Many are working multiple jobs or side hustles to make extra money. They called it \u201cscrambling\u201d in my old neighborhood. It\u2019s something to be admired.\n\nFor the record, most Americans are not working two or more jobs.\n\nAugust Employment Metrics 2019 2018 Want a Job 5,331,000 5,534,000 Multiple Job Holders 8,038,000 7,540,000 Percentage of total jobs 5.1% 4.8% Men 3,951,000 3,639,000 Percentage of total jobs 4.7% 4.4% Women 4,086,000 3,901,000 Percentage of total jobs 5.5% 5.4%\n\nPortfolio Approach\n\nWe added a Financial as mentioned above. If you need help with the model portfolio, contact your rep or research@wstreet.com.\n\nCommunication Services Consumer Discretionary Consumer Staples 1 2 2 Energy Financials Healthcare 1 2 2 Industrial Materials Real Estate 3 2 1 Technology Utilities Cash 3 0 1\n\nSkipping Peloton\n\nPeloton is set to go public today. I\u2019m skipping it, as there are too many issues, from music rights to competition, to ever making a profit.\n\nToday\u2019s Session\n\nThe futures are lower after the whistleblower report was released. The major indices are mixed. The news also sent yields on the 10-year treasury down to 1.69%, lower by 4 basis points, and the dollar is slightly higher.\n\nOn the economic front, initial claims for the week ending September 14 were up by 2,000 to 208,000. A better gauge, the 4-week moving average decreased by 750 to 212,500. Claims have been lower than 300,000 for 237 consecutive weeks, indicative of a tight labor market.", "description": "Yesterday was the best session in a couple of weeks .09/26/2019 12:45:59PM EST.", "authors": ["Charles Payne", "Matt Vespa", "Guy Benson", "Cortney O'Brien", "Katie Pavlich"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/268/8423a90f-e5d4-44b4-bb14-674e0692cc30.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
