When I ran, there were more women in space than women running for president, right?\" Clinton said.\n\nColbert then asked if Clinton had endorsed anyone yet.\n\n\"No. No, I\u2019m not going to,\" she replied.\n\n\"What if somebody came out and said let\u2019s get rid of the Electoral College?\" Colbert followed up.\n\n\"I think they\u2019ve all said that. I\u2019ve said that since 2000, and boy did I mean it in 2000,\" Clinton joked.\n\nClinton is not the only big name Democrat to not endorse anyone during the primary. Former President Barack Obama has stayed silent on his preferred choice, even with his former vice president now in the mix.\n\nIn the early days of the presidential race, Joe Biden claimed he asked Obama to not endorse him.\n\n\"I asked President Obama not to endorse and he doesn't want to \u2014 whoever wins this nomination should win it on their own merits,\" Biden said.\n\nIn a statement shortly after Biden entered the race, Obama spokeswoman Katie Hill said, \"President Obama has long said that selecting Joe Biden as his running mate in 2008 was one of the best decisions he ever made. He relied on the vice president\u2019s knowledge, insight, and judgment throughout both campaigns and the entire presidency. The two forged a special bond over the last 10 years and remain close today.\"", "description": ".10/01/2019 11:23:08AM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Cortney O'Brien", "Leah Barkoukis", "Timothy Meads", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/274/d0885607-ebe2-45d6-9bc8-7f70a9d2396f.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
