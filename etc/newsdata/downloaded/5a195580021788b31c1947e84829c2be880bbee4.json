Every tattoo is a reference to him: his favourite numbers (one and three); his date of birth (13 October 1995); an image of the grim reaper alongside the words \u201cLive now pay later\u201d; a dragon koi, because Jake loved fishing; the musical notation for the chorus of his song Try Me. Then, tattooed along his forearm in script, is \u201cResilient J\u201d, Jake\u2019s rapper name.\n\nJake had so much potential and was beginning to turn his life around. He had been sober for almost two years after drinking excessively since he was 16. After years in flux \u2013 pinballing from supported accommodation in Brighton to homeless hostels, squats and friends\u2019 sofas \u2013 he seemed to be on the verge of getting his own place. He was even beginning to make inroads into the music industry: in January 2018, he joined in a filmed session with the hugely successful singer-songwriter Rag\u2019n\u2019Bone Man. But in the end, Resilient J wasn\u2019t quite resilient enough. After losing a close friend to suicide and witnessing another overdosing, he relapsed. A three-week drinking binge followed, before he killed himself on 29 August 2018. Jake was 22.\n\nSuicide is the second-biggest killer of homeless people in the UK, and Brighton has one of the highest suicide rates in the country. The city is a transient place: great for holidaymakers and day trippers, but tough for many people growing up there. Austerity has rattled Brighton, producing a lack of secure employment and affordable housing, which has led to some of the highest rates of rough sleeping and homelessness outside London. Cuts have decimated social care and education, contributing to a mounting youth crisis and communities where one in three children are living in poverty. At the same time, the influx of wealthier people (often second-home owners) to the city has increased house prices.\n\nJake didn\u2019t leave a suicide note. It is impossible to know exactly what was going through his mind at the end. But the more you look into this life, the more you see all these elements coming into play \u2013 transience, loneliness, cuts to social care and support groups, unregulated services and, ultimately, institutional failings.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jake Humm (right) with his father Joules. Photograph: Courtesy of Joules Humm\n\nWe meet Jake\u2019s father in a cafe on Brighton\u2019s seafront, underneath the bandstand where Jake loved to hang out with friends. Joules is accompanied by Michelle Hunter, a project team leader at the YMCA DownsLink Group, which was supporting Jake at the time of his death. It is nine months since he died, and Joules is still staggering towards an understanding and acceptance of what happened. Jake was his only child, his fishing partner, his soulmate. And yet, as is so often the case, there were tensions; they bickered and, ultimately, couldn\u2019t live with each other.\n\nHunter had known Jake for years. She says he adored his father, and tells us how she and Joules would work together, behind his back, to try to keep Jake\u2019s life on track. She talks about Jake with huge affection and emotion. She is also, perhaps unsurprisingly, a little defensive.\n\nHe was one of our young people. Once you\u2019ve come to us and we\u2019re there, the door is always open Michelle Hunter, YMCA Downslink Group\n\nJoules, a 48-year-old carpenter, says it is uncanny how much he and Jake had in common \u2013 the same hobbies, obsessions and weaknesses. It was Joules who introduced Jake to music (all sorts, from Led Zeppelin to Eminem), taught him how to fish and encouraged his tidiness, which later became a fixation. But there was more. Joules knew exactly how tough it could be for young people, men in particular, trying to make their way in Brighton. He had moved there from London as a young man. Like Jake, he was creative, funny and handsome. Like Jake, he had struggled to make ends meet, battled depression and alcoholism (he last drank eight years ago) and spent time sofa surfing and in temporary accommodation. There is little that Jake went through that his father didn\u2019t understand. Joules says there were times when he, too, was suicidal.\n\nJoules says he and his son always had a special bond. Jake\u2019s parents split up when he was about four; Joules says he was denied custody because he was living in temporary accommodation. Four years later, when Joules was settled, Jake moved into a flat with him.\n\nQ&A What is 'The empty doorway' - the Guardian series on people who died homeless? Show Hide An estimated 800 homeless people died in Britain in the 18 months before March 2019. Over the next few months, G2 and Guardian Cities will look behind this statistic to tell the stories of some of those who have died on Britain\u2019s streets. We will tell not just the story of their death, but the story of their life \u2013 what they were like as kids, what their dreams were, their hobbies, what people loved about them, what was infuriating. We will also examine what went wrong with their lives, how it impacted on their loved ones, and if anything could have been done differently to prevent their deaths. As the series develops, we will invite politicians, charities and homelessness organisations to respond to the issues raised. We will also ask readers to offer their own stories and reflections on homelessness. We want the stories we tell to become the fulcrum of a debate about homelessness; to make a difference to a scourge that shames us all. It is time to stop just passing by.\n\nIn some ways, Jake was a natural leader. At the age of seven, he was a star of the local football team, Saltdean United. Joules says he showed a rare maturity. \u201cIf someone was not pulling their weight in a certain position, rather than stand up front for the glory, Jake would drop into that position.\u201d But in other ways, he struggled. School didn\u2019t know what to do with Jake. He was bright, good with words, but he couldn\u2019t settle. He played truant, and was disruptive when he did turn up.\n\nAt the age of 14, he was being seen by the child and adolescent mental health services. Eventually, he was diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder. He wasn\u2019t violent or aggressive, but he was pig-headed. He would find daft, random ways of getting into trouble at school. Joules tells the story of the marrow. \u201cHe went into a biology classroom and he picked up a marrow that the year below were growing, and one of the kids said: \u2018You can have it, Jake.\u2019\u201d When the teachers asked him to return it, he refused, telling them it was a gift. He was deliberately winding them up. But the game got out of hand. By the end of the day, it had become a perverse matter of principle. \u201cJake climbed up on the school roof and launched it across the playground so nobody could have it,\u201d says Joules. \u201cThat\u2019s when he got into trouble, because it could have hit somebody.\u201d\n\nIt is such a mild act of rebellion, yet somehow it sums up Jake\u2019s brooding sense of injustice, that all was not well with the world. On social media he would vent his anger at all that was wrong with society. He became a conspiracy theorist, convinced that the US government was behind the bombing of the twin towers.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Joules Humm has dedicated his left arm to tattooed references to his late son, Jake. Photograph: Peter Flude/The Guardian\n\nHe was 16, still at school and already drinking too much when he decided to leave home. Joules agreed it was the best thing. There were no dramas, he says; they just needed their own space. \u201cThe relationship didn\u2019t break down, but both of us could see where it was going. Maybe it was an alpha-male thing. It wasn\u2019t a case of me saying: \u2018Jake, you\u2019ve gotta go.\u2019 It was kind of a mutual thing. It was quite calm; it wasn\u2019t ugly.\u201d\n\nJake moved into accommodation at the YMCA in Brighton, a supported hostel with space for up to 15 residents. Hunter remembers that the first time she saw him he was wearing his school uniform. He was drinking more and more heavily, and started as he meant to go on \u2013 with spirits. We ask Joules where he got the money. Joules smiles and says he doesn\u2019t think the local Co-op would have been best pleased with his son. When Jake wasn\u2019t drinking, he would become agitated. At times, he would self-harm.\n\nAlcohol is strictly prohibited at the YMCA. Jake lasted almost a year with the charity before being evicted after a \u201cnumber of incidents involving anti-social behaviour\u201d. Hunter says there was no choice \u2013 he was breaking the rules and making it tough for others. She insists the YMCA continued to support him. \u201cTo us, he was one of our young people,\u201d she says. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve come to us and we\u2019re there, the door is always open.\u201d The door may have been open, but Jake was no longer allowed to sleep at the YMCA.\n\nJake Humm's death fills me with anger and despair \u2013 thousands like him are at risk Read more\n\nAfter the YMCA, Jake\u2019s living situation fell into chaos. He bounced around every kind of housing project throughout Brighton, Newhaven and further afield. He and Joules remained close, but they knew it wouldn\u2019t work if he moved back in. Jake had admitted that there were numerous occasions when he was offered help and refused it.\n\nIn October 2016, as he turned 21, he decided to take himself in hand and checked into a 10-day detox programme in London. At the end of that month, Jake announced to his Facebook friends: \u201cA new chapter in my life is on the horizon, a life without drink an drugs, no doubt my demons will wanna war but [it\u2019s] a war I\u2019m gonna win!!! bring on tomorrow!\u201d\n\nFor a long time, it looked as if he was winning it. After kicking the booze, he got back into shape, took on voluntary work and strengthened his relationship with his father. Jake and Joules spent weeks together camped out on lakes, catching and posing with carp the size of pitbulls. For the first time in five years, Jake moved back in with the YMCA \u2013 this time into semi-independent accommodation, which he hoped would be a stepping stone towards independence. He also embarked on a period of ferocious creativity.\n\nThe music organisation AudioActive is based in an old warehouse in Brighton. It looks like any old ramshackle building, until you enter and discover a rabbit warren of recording studios. AudioActive helps young people express themselves through music, and this is where Jake created some of his best work. For almost two years after Jake became clean, he attended a weekly session called Room to Rant, which provided just that. He was one of half a dozen struggling young men who turned up to express their anger, frustration and talent through music. Jake was older than most of his fellow ranters, but younger than the youth workers who supported them. He ended up close to both groups.\n\nIn the video with Rag\u2019n\u2019Bone Man, Jake explained what Room to Rant had done for him. \u201cThere\u2019s not enough places for young men to be able to express themselves and express their feelings. Whatever it is on your mind, you can come here and you\u2019re not going to be judged for it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to have someone looking down their nose, like: \u2018Oh, you\u2019re weak, or you\u2019re vulnerable,\u2019 because we\u2019re not. We just have trouble sometimes with life.\u201d\n\nTom Hines, AudioActive\u2019s project manager, leads us to a studio where we meet four of Jake\u2019s friends. Olly and Rob are regular ranters, while Ed Hallwood and Jon Clark are AudioActive mentors. Olly and Rob have also been homeless. Rob, clad head to toe in sportswear, is buzzing with restless energy. He rocks from one subject to another: his dramatic weight loss; the occasion he was battered by a police officer, leaving him with a classic boxer\u2019s nose; AudioActive\u2019s amazing equipment. Olly is quiet and still.\n\nPlay Video 1:15 Jake Humm explains the importance of the Room to Rant programme to Rag'n'Bone Man \u2013 video\n\nBoth boys talk about the horrors of hostel life and a welfare system they feel has let them down. \u201cHostels are shitholes,\u201d Olly says. \u201cI\u2019ve got friends who were really fucked up by them. There are not people looking out for you the way they should be, and there\u2019s drugs everywhere. I\u2019ve had friends kicked out of the same shitty hostels for small reasons without a place to go.\u201d Perhaps the hostels can\u2019t win \u2013 after all, Jake felt hard done by when he was evicted for drinking. The one thing the boys seem uneasy talking about is Jake. After they leave, Hines tells us that Jake\u2019s friends haven\u2019t come to terms with his death, that it is still raw.\n\nHines and his fellow mentors talk about Jake with love, admiration and pain. It feels like a group therapy session. Hines says Jake was like an older brother to the ranters: they listened to him, because he had been through it all. \u201cHe was happy to tell young people the dangers of drink and drugs. When I was about to do my job, I\u2019d find he\u2019d jump in and do it for me.\u201d\n\nAll three men agree he was the most talented rapper at AudioActive. \u201cIt was as if everything else in his week was funnelled into those two hours,\u201d Clark says. \u201cHe\u2019d turn up and have three or four new things he\u2019d done. He\u2019d do one and we\u2019d all be gobsmacked, and do the next one and the next one, and it seemed like he was writing every night and this was his forum. This was his place to go and make it happen.\u201d\n\nOne of the reasons we couldn\u2019t get funding is we couldn\u2019t measure our impact. Unfortunately, we kind of can now Tom Hines, AudioActive\n\nThe word they use again and again is \u201cfierce\u201d \u2013 not about Jake, but about his music. Jake didn\u2019t run away from reality, or soften and sanitise, or big himself up in his lyrics. He rapped about addiction, homelessness, mental health, friendship, love. He was political, but not in an ideological way. \u201cHe would walk down the high street and analyse all the forces at work,\u201d Clark says.\n\nThey knew he was struggling at times \u2013 all the young men at Room to Rant were. There was even one occasion when he stood at the door screaming that he was sick of life and wanted out. But moments later, they say, he was smiling, anticipating a big future for himself. After all, he was Resilient J.\n\nYes, he rapped about feeling desperate, Hines says, but rappers tend to rap in character. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to thousands of rappers, and you can\u2019t just take the lyrics at face value. They\u2019re often stories, they\u2019re often metaphorical. People say all sorts of things about death, and sometimes it\u2019s just the best rhyme for that scheme.\u201d Hines says it is the most difficult part of his job \u2013 distinguishing between the rapper in character and the cry for help from the individual.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jake Humm (left) pictured with Rag\u2019n\u2019Bone Man in 2018 . Photograph: Image supplied by Joules Humm\n\nHallwood says that, of all the people who attended Room to Rant, Jake was the one he worried about least, because he was so sure he was destined for success. He talks about the last time he saw him \u2013 at the final Room to Rant session. \u201cI didn\u2019t have Jake as a Facebook friend, but it didn\u2019t matter, because I had in my mind that next time I see Jake he\u2019s gonna be on a viral YouTube video, or on a poster bill next to his favourite rappers.\u201d\n\nDid anything happen towards the end of his life that may have made him fall off the wagon? The room goes quiet. \u201cThis is really important,\u201d Hines says eventually. \u201cWe ran out of funding. Room to Rant had to close.\u201d The grant, provided by Brighton and Hove clinical commissioning group, was for \u00a35,000 \u2013 enough to run Room to Rant for a year. \u201cOne of the reasons we couldn\u2019t get funding is we couldn\u2019t measure our impact,\u201d Hines says. \u201cUnfortunately, we kind of can now, because another young man quickly ended up in jail and Jake lost a support network. There was a real sense of loss there.\u201d\n\nHow did Jake feel about Room to Rant ending? \u201cHe wasn\u2019t happy about it,\u201d Hines says. \u201cNo one was,\u201d adds Clark. \u201cBrighton can be a very difficult city to make real friends,\u201d Hallwood says. \u201cEspecially for young people. You can find a lot of people who will happily drink with you, happily snort coke with you. You\u2019ll feel like friends because you\u2019re opening up while on drugs, but very few of them will actually put their hand on your shoulder and go: \u2018Are you all right?\u2019\u201d That is why Room to Rant was so special for Jake and the others. \u201cThey were together a couple of years,\u201d Hines says. \u201cThat\u2019s a long time. When a group of young men really open up in front of each other, it makes them very close.\u201d\n\nIn her tiny office in a building called Norman Shaw North, near the Houses of Parliament, Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP for Brighton Pavilion, burns with contained rage. She says Brighton and Hove city council has been devastated by the loss of more than \u00a3100m in core government grants since 2010. A report published last November by the housing charity Shelter revealed that Brighton and Hove had the second-highest rate of homelessness in Britain outside London, with 4,317 people registered homeless \u2013 one in 67 of the population. In 2017, Brighton and Hove recorded 178 street homeless people, second only to Westminster among England\u2019s local authorities.\n\nIt was hardly a surprise that taking housing benefit away from under-21s led to more young people being on the streets Caroline Lucas, MP\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion Caroline Lucas. Photograph: Clodagh Kilcoyne/Reuters\n\nLast year, there was a dramatic fall, to 64. But these figures were controversial \u2013 the council admitted it had changed the way it reached its total of street homeless people, and the figures were collated on a snowy November night when many homeless people were thought to have taken refuge indoors. Meanwhile, data published by the Office for National Statistics showed that, between 2013 and 2017, there were an estimated 48 homeless deaths in Brighton \u2013 among the 10 highest figures for local authorities in England and Wales.\n\nLucas believes the homelessness crisis is a shocking but inevitable consequence of government policy. If you refuse to build council homes, sell off the remaining stock and strip young people of housing benefit, she asks, what else can you expect? \u201cIt was hardly a surprise that taking housing benefit away from under-21s led to more young people being on the streets. It\u2019s a callous disregard. The government is content to see that as the collateral damage of its economic ideology.\u201d\n\nLucas is alarmed by the rates of homelessness and suicide in Brighton and is urging the council to hold an inquiry. The problem, she says, is that so much of the data is confidential. Without access to data, it is virtually impossible to find exactly where people have been failed. She has also been distressed by her own impotence. In January 2017, the Greens on the council proposed a 24/7, year-round shelter to ensure that nobody had to sleep on the streets: a simple enough plan with obvious benefits. But they were told it wasn\u2019t possible. \u201cWe were told there just wasn\u2019t the money for it,\u201d says Lucas. \u201cWe proposed using council-owned buildings, at least to get a temporary roof over people\u2019s heads. But, actually, the more you learn, the more complex it is in the sense that there isn\u2019t a cost-free option, because people have got to be safe, and to make places safe costs money.\u201d\n\nAt the inquest into Jake\u2019s death in January 2019, the coroner, Veronica Hamilton-Deeley, considered Jake\u2019s relapse. She heard evidence about the suicide of his friend four months before he died and said it would have reminded him of another suicide (that of his step-sister, years earlier) and led to a rapid downward spiral. \u201cThis would have been history repeating itself for him,\u201d said Hamilton-Deeley. \u201cThis instability would have played a huge part. It\u2019s very hard to cope with everything and your own struggles when you\u2019re low.\u201d She concluded that he had killed himself, that it was \u201can impulsive act\u201d and that he \u201cobviously had the support around him\u201d.\n\nYet his social media posts suggest his suicide was anything but impulsive. He documented his final three weeks in unsparing detail, telling his friends he was back on the booze and this time determined to drink himself to death. Jake seemed to revel in his relapse. He announced it enthusiastically to his Instagram followers on 9 August 2018, with a picture of bottles of Coke and spirits and a Marilyn Monroe CD resting on top of his coffee table, captioned with the hashtags #relapse and #dontdothingsbyhalves. His inner battles spilled out on to his social media timelines, revealing shifts in mood from hope to despair. Five days into his binge, he posted on Facebook a list of all the drink and drugs he had consumed, while expressing confusion at still being alive with a laughing emoji.\n\nOver the next couple of days, the breezy take on his self-destruction was replaced with scathing rebukes of psychiatry and therapy, and a desperate lament for the perceived lack of support he had received. Jake ended the post by saying he hoped the alcohol \u201cputs me in my grave in the next few days\u201d. Days later, Jake seemed to have changed his mind again when he posted a picture of the empty bottles resting on his bed and announced he had sobered up. He even recorded himself pouring a bottle of Jack Daniel\u2019s down a toilet. Now it was all about the future. \u201cWatch this space next 2 years are gonna be a madness, focused an driven be ready when I call on u ... I see something new, I see another way out,\u201d he wrote. This renewed optimism was short-lived, however: he relapsed again four days later.\n\nHowever anguished they were, these posts often went unliked and uncommented on. He became nostalgic for his childhood. He recalled his days at Saltdean United, including the occasion he almost scored a brilliant overhead kick in a new pair of boots (\u201cBest years of my life so far thank u everyone that was apart of the team and the mums and dads that showed their support even in the pissing down rain\u201d).\n\nOn 26 August, he wrote a bleak and tender poem \u2013 one that echoes so much of what people have told us about him.\n\nMy heart is pure,\n\nMy mind distorts\n\nMy souls of course,\n\nThe systems flawed\n\nI don\u2019t live like society\n\nAn abide by the law,\n\nNever believed in\n\nThe Lies you bought\n\nNever agreed with how\n\nSchools taught\n\nI see the world for what it is\n\nNow my eyes are so sore\n\nOn 29 August, the day Jake killed himself, he talked with friends on his feed about meeting up for a chat and buying a new Panic! At the Disco album, but his desolation was evident. Then he posted this:\n\nLaying on my floor\n\nWith a bottle full of brandy ...\n\nI just want to be dead,\n\nCoz I\u2019ve got nothing left\n\nNothing to hold on to\n\nEverything\u2019s been said\n\nI\u2019ve got a girl in my bed\n\nBut I don\u2019t even care\n\nBut I do I\u2019m just scared.\n\nBy now, he seemed exhausted, terrified and desperately lonely. \u201cAll I want is real love. In these days it seems impossible,\u201d he wrote. He asked his father for money in a Facebook post, told him how much he adored him, then hanged himself. Joules was away that day and didn\u2019t see the post.\n\nWhen the police came to inform Joules of his son\u2019s death, he says he told them why they were there. \u201cFor a long time, deep down, it was my deepest, darkest fear. That\u2019s why I knew when they came to the door.\u201d Since that day, Joules has constantly interrogated himself about his role in his son\u2019s suicide. \u201cThe hardest thing for me, even now, is to not beat myself up about it,\u201d Joules says, his voice breaking. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to,\u201d Hunter says gently. \u201cI like to think, deep down, that I did everything possible,\u201d Joules says. \u201cHe did,\u201d Hunter says to us. \u201cBut that does not stop me from kicking myself every day,\u201d Joules adds.\n\nJake\u2019s body was discovered after other residents in the YMCA-run house in which he was living complained of smelly drains. \u201cIf you remember last year, we had a heatwave,\u201d Joules says. \u201cAnd I think the rest is pretty self-explanatory.\u201d\n\nIt was Hunter who discovered Jake, after he had been dead for two days. \u201cAnd there\u2019s my guilt,\u201d she says. She is in tears; it is Joules\u2019s turn to comfort her.\n\nThe room in which Jake died is a little more than 200 metres from where we are seated with Joules and Hunter at the bandstand on the beach. We walk up to Bedford Square. It is the first time Joules has visited the building \u2013 a Regency townhouse \u2013 since Jake died there. Hunter points to the top floor, where Jake\u2019s room was. Joules looks up and breaks down. He walks away, weeping.\n\nPlay Video 3:49 Jake Humm raps over a photo montage made by friends for his funeral \u2013 video\n\nSo many of Jake\u2019s social posts in his final three weeks read like cries for help that went unheard. Yet throughout this time, he was living in semi-independent YMCA accommodation and was seen by Pavilions, the Brighton-based treatment centre for drug and alcohol abuse. Jake\u2019s care co-ordinator at Pavilions, Paula Hinks, told the inquest that, during an appointment in August last year, he had said he was enjoying drinking and had no intention of giving up.\n\nWe ask Pavilions if it was also aware of his suicidal thoughts, whether it shared information about his relapse with support staff at the YMCA and whether it considered sectioning Jake under the Mental Health Act. Pavilions tells us it does not share any information regarding the treatment and care of its service users because it is confidential.\n\nHunter\u2019s concern and affection for Jake could not be more apparent. Yet there is still a question mark about whether the YMCA did all it could do to protect him from himself when he was at his most vulnerable. Was Bedford Square sufficiently staffed to monitor Jake\u2019s fatal three-week binge?\n\nShortly after meeting Joules and Hunter, we receive an email from the YMCA DownsLink Group saying it would like to help in any way possible. We ask how many staff work at Bedford Square and whether they are residential. But the return email is surprisingly unhelpful. \u201cMy understanding is that the article is about Jake\u2019s story and we want to keep it focused on him, therefore we don\u2019t think the questions regarding our staffing and services etc are necessary,\u201d says a manager at the YMCA DownsLink Group.\n\nWe ask the YMCA whether it knew that Jake was drinking and suicidal. \u201cWe were aware that Jake had started using alcohol again in the weeks before his death,\u201d the YMCA tells us. \u201cStaff were supporting him to access specialist mental health and substance misuse services. Jake also expressed suicidal thoughts and we therefore agreed a \u2018safe plan\u2019 with him on 17 August.\u201d When we ask what Jake\u2019s safe plan involved, the YMCA does not respond. It does, though, quote the coroner\u2019s findings that Jake \u201cobviously had the support around him\u201d.\n\nWhen Jake committed to things, he gave 150%, including his death. He meant what he did, as hard as that is to say Joules Humm\n\nThe YMCA describes itself as \u201cthe largest provider of safe, supported accommodation for young people in England and Wales\u201d, offering more than 9,100 beds, \u201cwhich includes everything from emergency accommodation through to supported longer-term housing and youth hostels\u201d. Although the YMCA is regulated by the Charity Commission and the Regulator of Social Housing, much of the support offered in its accommodation is unregulated. The semi-independent home in Bedford Square, where Jake died, is self-regulating because it provides support rather than \u201cpersonal care\u201d. This means that its support is neither monitored by the Care Quality Commission nor Ofsted, despite the fact that residents may be as young as 16.\n\nWe ask Brighton and Hove city council if it is considering an inquiry into Jake\u2019s death. The council quotes the coroner\u2019s verdict, saying: \u201cWe do not see any basis for conducting a further inquiry into these circumstances. We had no involvement in the care he received from the YMCA DownsLink Group in the period leading up to his death, and have no comment to make on it.\u201d\n\nHomeless deaths: share your tributes Read more\n\nHowever, the YMCA tells us it conducted an internal review after Jake\u2019s death. We ask if the review considered whether the YMCA should have had Jake sectioned or moved into supported accommodation, whether they had seen Jake enough in the weeks leading up to his death and whether it was satisfactory that he had been left for at least two days despite being a known suicide risk. The YMCA did not answer these questions, but it did say: \u201cOur review concluded that there were no errors or omissions in the service we provided, despite the sad outcome. However, we did identify some changes we could make, such as, for example, introducing a ligature risk assessment whereby potential ligature points could be identified and promptly removed if a resident was deemed to be at risk of suicide or self-harm.\u201d\n\nFor Caroline Lucas, self-regulation is simply not good enough. \u201cWhenever you\u2019ve got institutions that are unregulated, then you\u2019re putting people at risk, because mistakes happen. Interventions should have happened and they didn\u2019t, and risk factors should have been recognised and they weren\u2019t.\u201d\n\nIt has been just over a year since Jake\u2019s death. At AudioActive, they are continuing to feel the fallout. The project manager, Tom Hines, says his job has changed \u2013 much of it now is about safeguarding. He worries that he is nannying too many of the youngsters he works with. \u201cIt\u2019s made my life a bit harder \u2013 I probably bother kids more than I should do.\u201d One piece of good news is that they have managed to find the funds to relaunch Room to Rant, partly through donations made at Jake\u2019s funeral, including \u00a3500 from Rag\u2019n\u2019Bone Man.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jake with a catch from one of the fishing trips he and Joules enjoyed together. Photograph: Provided by the Humm Family\n\nAs for Joules, he seems to be in a more profound state of shock than he was when we first met him three months ago. Recently, he had to talk one of Jake\u2019s friends out of killing himself. Over the past week, he says two more young people have died through suicide in Brighton. Both of them knew Jake. He still believes that, ultimately, his son was determined to kill himself. \u201cWhen Jake committed to things, he gave 150%, including his death. He meant what he did, as hard as that is to say.\u201d\n\nHe says he misses his son so much, and a day doesn\u2019t pass without a what-if. Often, when he is out fishing on the lake by himself, he will tear into Jake for his stupidity, for leaving him in the lurch. \u201cI swear at him a lot,\u201d Joules says. \u201cI\u2019m not angry with him. I\u2019ll be sitting there thinking about things we did, and it just hits you, and I\u2019ll be like: \u2018Yeah, you little bastard, we won\u2019t be doing that again, will we?\u2019\u201d\n\nNowadays, he says, it feels as if he has got an extended family \u2013 father to none and father to all. So many of Jake\u2019s friends turn to him for advice, but he is in no state to carry their load. He has got enough baggage of his own. \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m struggling,\u201d he says.\n\nIn the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or by emailing jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.
