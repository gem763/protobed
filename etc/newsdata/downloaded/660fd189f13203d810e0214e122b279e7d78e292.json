We want to make sure that travel agencies have all the information they need to make the right purchasing decisions, and we can exceed travelers\u2019 expectations throughout their journey. We believe that Amadeus provides the best technology for agents to book and retail Japan Airlines\u2019 travel offers and have therefore chosen Amadeus as our recommended partner,\u201d said Yoriyuki Kashiwagi, Executive Officer, International Passenger Sales of Japan Airlines.\n\nDecius Valmorbida, President, Travel Channels, Amadeus, said, \u201cWe recognize that Japan has a unique profile of travel agencies, which gives rise to specific requirements and expectations. This is exactly why we have evolved the Amadeus Travel Platform, so that all of our customers can access more content, via multiple channels and devices. Partnering with JAL to become its recommended distribution partner is a testament to our ongoing investment in technology and our extensive global network.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Asia Travel Tips", "description": "With Amadeus becoming JAL\u2019s recommended distribution partner, Amadeus\u2019 global network of travel sellers will have access to a broader range of JAL\u2019s content, including the full range of international, as well as preferred and negotiated fares.
