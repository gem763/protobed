Following a meeting of EU ambassadors yesterday morning, one senior diplomat told the Daily Mail this would be the \u2018best case scenario\u2019.\n\nThree letters were sent to the EU on Saturday night after the Commons voted to debate Mr Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal further. The Prime Minister sent a letter to the EU requesting an extension, as required by the Benn Act \u2013 known formally as the European Union (Withdrawal) (No2) Act \u2013 but he did not sign it.\n\nThe Prime Minister sent a letter to the EU requesting an extension, as required by the Benn Act \u2013 known formally as the European Union (Withdrawal) (No2) Act \u2013 but he did not sign it\n\nHe also sent a second letter \u2013 which he signed \u2013 to EU Council president Donald Tusk, saying that a delay would be a mistake. The third letter was an explanatory one from Sir Tim Barrow, the UK\u2019s ambassador to the EU.\n\nFrench president Emmanuel Macron is believed to be emphatically opposed to any further unnecessary delay.\n\nBut if the deal is voted down this week, or the legislation is scuppered by wrecking amendments, the EU is likely to convene an emergency summit to decide whether to offer Britain another extension \u2013 and for how long.\n\nDonald Tusk started ringing EU leaders yesterday to assess their thoughts about another extension\n\nLast night it emerged that one option being considered is to delay Brexit until January 31, as set out under the Benn Act, with the option of the extension dissolving away if the Commons passes Mr Johnson\u2019s deal before then.\n\nThe \u2018flextension\u2019 could see Britain leave later in November, in December or earlier in January if the deal is passed before the extension ends, say diplomatic sources.\n\nNo decision will be made until EU leaders have had the chance to assess the chances of Mr Johnson\u2019s deal getting through the Commons and how long that could take if MPs bombard the legislation with amendments.\n\nAccording to EU sources, if MPs force a second referendum then countries led by Germany will push for a longer extension, potentially until June next year.\n\nThe first letter (pictured) was the letter demanded by the Benn Act, which asks the EU to delay Brexit beyond the October 31 deadline \u2013 but not signed by Boris Johnson \u2013 using the exact wording specified in the legislation\n\nBut if it is for any other reason it is unlikely an extension would be granted beyond January 31.\n\nPeter Altmaier, Germany\u2019s economy minister, cautioned against a long extension, saying prolonged uncertainty further endangers jobs and prosperity. \u2018If an extension by a few weeks is necessary, I wouldn\u2019t have a problem with it,\u2019 he said.\n\nThe EU is not obliged to offer an extension. If the Withdrawal Bill\u2019s passage through the Commons is relatively trouble-free, but still needs a few days or weeks beyond October 31 to pass, EU leaders are likely to grant a short \u2018technical\u2019 extension. This could be done without them holding a summit via the EU Council\u2019s \u2018written procedure\u2019, with EU capitals granting approval \u2018remotely\u2019 either by letter or email.\n\nIn a separate letter to Donald Tusk, Mr Johnson made clear that he does not want the EU to grant a further Brexit extension\n\nBut if the Withdrawal Bill meets fierce opposition and looks unlikely to pass, EU leaders may opt for an emergency summit at the end of the month to consider a longer extension. This could last into 2020 if it was for an event like a general election. The remaining EU27 leaders have to unanimously agree for a delay to be granted.\n\nMr Tusk started ringing EU leaders yesterday to assess their thoughts about another extension. He aims to have spoken to all of them by tomorrow before making a call on whether to pencil in a summit before October 31.\n\nThe European Parliament is planning to press ahead with its own vote on whether to approve the deal on Thursday.", "description": "The EU is considering a Brexit 'flextension' that could last until next year - but will delay a decision until it has seen whether PM has Commons backing for his new deal, it emerged last night.", "authors": ["David Churchill Brussels Correspondent For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/23/19969302-0-image-a-12_1571612235118.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
