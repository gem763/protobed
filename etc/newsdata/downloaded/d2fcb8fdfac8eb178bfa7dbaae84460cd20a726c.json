Game 4 is Tuesday at Mohegan Sun Arena.\n\nDelle Donne, the WNBA\u2019s Most Valuable Player, did not participate in any basketball activities all week in an effort to get her ailing back to a manageable state to allow her to play Game 3. She had 13 points and six rebounds and made three of her four three-point attempts. Mystics starting guard Ariel Atkins also played despite experiencing back spasms that began Thursday night.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNo one has more WNBA wins than Mike Thibault. But his first title has been elusive.\n\nDelle Donne clearly wasn\u2019t her usual self \u2014 her movement was severely limited, and she was far more hesitant to take shots than usual \u2014 but her presence and perimeter scoring were critical in a win that Emma Meesseman, Kristi Toliver and Natasha Cloud dominated.\n\nMeesseman had 21 points, 14 of which came in the fourth quarter. Cloud had 19 points and coordinated the type of high-energy defensive effort the Mystics needed. And Toliver, the only Mystics player with a WNBA title pedigree, had 20 points and 10 rebounds to beat the Sun on their home court in front of a loud, sellout crowd of 9,170.\n\nWashington never trailed in the second half, though the Sun was within one point on a few possessions in the third quarter. Each time, the Mystics had an answer.\n\nAD\n\nEarly in the third, it was a free throw from Sun leading scorer Jonquel Jones that put Connecticut down one, 43-42. Toliver answered with a three.\n\nAD\n\nShekinna Stricklen pulled the Sun back within one on its next possession with a three of her own but Ariel Atkins hit a pullup to push the lead back to three. Later in the quarter, the Sun closed back to within two before Delle Donne hit a three to push the margin back to five. Connecticut would get no closer.\n\nStricklen and Jasmine Thomas finished with 16 points each and Bria Holmes had 15. Jones, who had 32 points and 18 rebounds in Tuesday\u2019s Game 2, finished with just nine points, a testament to a renewed defensive effort from the Mystics.\n\nAD\n\nWashington limited Jones to four field goals, controlled the glass to out-rebound Connecticut 18-9 midway through the second quarter and played excellent perimeter defense. The Sun were 2-for-9 from deep at the end of the first half, and Jones didn\u2019t have her first field goal until 85 seconds before halftime.\n\nAD\n\nThey did all that despite the fact that Delle Donne was in and out of the locker room throughout the first half, stretching and staying warm in the training room when she subbed out as opposed to sitting on the bench. The two-time MVP was more hesitant to shoot than usual but hit both of the field goals she attempted in the first half. On defense, she was much slower than usual, but still made herself a presence in the post.\n\nEven without the usual production from Delle Donne, the Mystics found a balance through Toliver and Cloud and led 41-27 in the second quarter before Connecticut went on a 12-2 run to close the half.\n\nAD", "description": "League MVP plays 26 minutes in 94-81 win, putting Washington one win from title.", "authors": ["Ava Wallace", "Reporter Covering Local Colleges"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/q0EFZyIKRqz-P0F65eIhvwTfs-M=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DZQRY2HIPAI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
