This prompted the sell initiation at CFRA.\n\nSee: Beyond Meat initiated at sell as large competitors make gains in plant-based food\n\n\u201cWhile Beyond Meat is well-positioned to benefit from this movement, investor expectations seem overly optimistic, evidenced by a more than 400% share-price appreciation since the company\u2019s $25 IPO in late May,\u201d wrote Arum Sundaram in the CFRA note.\n\n\u201cOver the recent months, several large packaged food companies have entered this space and introduced competing plant-based products. Also, Impossible Foods, Beyond Meat\u2019s food tech rival, recently entered the $95 billion U.S. meat retail market to compete head on with Beyond Meat.\u201d\n\nBernstein analysts predicted there will be upside to Beyond Meat\u2019s 2019 sales guidance because of these restaurant partnerships. \u201cSpecifically management expected sales to exceed $240 million in fiscal 2019, which could be conservative as it does not include the incremental revenue from potential new food service and retail partnerships, like Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, McDonald\u2019s and HelloFresh,\u201d analysts wrote. \u201cInvestors will want to hear an update on the competitive landscape, especially after Impossible Foods launched in retail.\u201d\n\nFactSet is guiding toward fiscal 2019 sales of $264.9 million.\n\nBernstein rates Beyond Meat shares market perform with a $130 target price.\n\nBeyond Meat\u2019s stock has an average hold rating and an average target price of $139.73, according to the dozen analysts polled by FactSet.\n\nAlso: Chipotle\u2019s carne asada supply is running low, bringing the limited-time offer to an early end\n\nHere\u2019s what to watch for in Beyond Meat earnings:\n\nEarnings: FactSet is pointing to earnings per share of 4 cents.\n\nEstimize, which crowdsources estimates from sell-side and buy-side analysts, hedge-fund managers, executives, academics and others, expects per-share earnings of 6 cents.\n\nBeyond Meat missed the consensus earnings forecast in the last quarter, reporting wider-than-expected losses of 24 cents per share.\n\nSales: FactSet forecasts third-quarter sales of $82.2 million.\n\nEstimize expects sales of $84.38 million.\n\nBeyond Meat has exceeded sales expectations in its previous two earnings reports.\n\nStock price: Beyond Meat stock has tumbled nearly 55% over the past three months. The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.41% is up 0.6% for the period.\n\nOther items:\n\n\u2022 Key to Beyond Meat\u2019s success so far is not just the willingness of consumers, particularly meat-eating ones, to try the meat alternative, but the \u201cretrial rate,\u201d according to Cowen analysts.\n\nCowen data show that both Beyond Meat and its fellow plant-based-meat leader Impossible Burger have a 79% retrial rate among omnivores.\n\nAnd when these customers see a Beyond Burger or Impossible Foods item on a restaurant menu, 77% of consumers Cowen surveyed say it\u2019s a compelling reason to go back to that restaurant.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: McDonald\u2019s expected to jump into the chicken-sandwich war next year: KeyBanc\n\n\u2022 Some brands will be a competitive threat, but it will take time, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts.\n\n\u201cIn the case of both Conagra Brands Inc.
