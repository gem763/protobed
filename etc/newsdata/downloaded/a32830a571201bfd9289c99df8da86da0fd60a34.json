Currently, laws in Australia do not prohibit minors from viewing pornography but now the federal government is developing proposals that would require viewers to prove their age before watching porn.\n\nA new proposal from the Department of Home Affairs would have viewers\u2019 faces matched with images from official identity documents such as a passport or divers license in order to ensure that the viewer is of legal age. The proposal immediately received objections as an infringement of citizens\u2019 privacy.\n\nSenator Rex Patrick, a centrist lawmaker from the state of South Australia, commented on the proposal stating: \u201cI think people should be very concerned about any government department that\u2019s seeking to store this kind of information.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Home Affairs did not respond to questions about the proposal and the attorney general\u2019s office directed all questions about the proposal to Home Affairs. This proposal echoes a similar law from the United Kingdom which required porn viewers to submit a valid form of ID in order to access certain websites.\n\n\u201cWhen someone first clicks on a site, they\u2019ll be asked to register with AgeID and verify their age using a Mobile SMS, credit card, passport, or driving licence,\u201d reported the Sun in March of this year. \u201cUsers will then be able to use their AgeID username or password to access all porn sites that use AgeID \u2013 though some may use different age verification systems.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs well as registering with AgeID, Brits will also be able to access porn sites using a voucher you can buy from high street shops,\u201d the Sun explained, adding that each voucher \u201cwill cost \u00a34.99 for use on a single device, or \u00a38.99 for use across multiple devices.\u201d\n\nBritish obscenity lawyer Myles Jackman warned that a similar system could also be applied to social networks in the future, stating: \u201cThere seems to be a massive groundswell of opinion in Westminster that age verification is a solution to the problem. It\u2019s seen as a simple way forward to cure all the ills allegedly caused by social media.\u201d\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
