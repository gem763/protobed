But Temple got the ball back and Adam Barry shanked a punt from the end zone to give Maryland first-and-goal at the 10.\n\nAgain, the Owls held the Terrapins, and a fourth-down pass was incomplete with 2:14 to go to complete the upset. Anthony Russo\u2019s intentional safety finished off the scoring.\n\nThe Terps had been favored by seven points.\n\nRusso threw for 277 yards and three touchdowns for the Owls. McFarland ran for 132 yards and Josh Jackson threw for 183 yards and was sacked four times for the Terps.\n\nThe Terps (2-1), who had opened with two straight blowout wins, made a series of plays in the third quarter to shake out of a road malaise.\n\nMcFarland, who had four touchdowns rushing in his first two games, gave Maryland a 9-7 lead when he scored on a 4-yard run early in the third. That got a rise out of thousands of Maryland fans who had made the 130-mile trek north to watch the Terps try and stay unbeaten.\n\nThen, Jackson hit Tyler Mabry with a 17-yard pass to put Maryland ahead 15-13 - the 2-point conversion was missed.\n\nTemple had its supporters, too, at the home of the Philadelphia Eagles, and the announced crowd of 30,610 wasn\u2019t far off the actual mark. It was the biggest home game of the season and the parking lots were stuffed with tailgating fans hungry for a win.\n\nRusso hit Jadan Blue in stride for a 79-yard touchdown in the third quarter for a 13-9 lead, and that gave those Temple fans hope another upset was on the horizon.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nMaryland flashed one of the more dominant offenses in the nation in the first two games, rolling to a 79-0 win over Howard and 63-20 victory over then-No. 21 Syracuse. The Terps averaged 335.5 yards rushing, the fourth-best average in the country and were best among Big Ten teams.\n\nThe Terps\u2019 offense dragged in Philadelphia.\n\nMaryland had just 79 yards rushing and two first downs in the first half, its lone score came on a safety. Jackson was sacked three times, McFarland was stuffed on fourth-and-goal and Joseph Petrino was wide left on a 42-yard attempt. Maryland even botched a fake field-goal attempt in the second quarter, and suddenly the Terps seemed to be spiraling toward another upset loss to the Owls.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nThe Terps cracked the Top 25 for the first time since 2013 and hadn\u2019t ranked as high as No. 21 since November 2006. So much for that.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nTemple plays Saturday at Buffalo.\n\nMaryland has a week off before Penn State on Sept. 27.\n\n__\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Kenny Yeboah put Temple ahead on a one-handed touchdown catch late in the fourth quarter, and the Owls used two clutch stops at the goal line to beat No. 21 Maryland 20-17 on Saturday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dan Gelston"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/14/maryland_temple_football_16111_c0-330-4000-2662_s1770x1032.jpg?40ed43b48ff9e665a851402b38068d24fcb2f640", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
