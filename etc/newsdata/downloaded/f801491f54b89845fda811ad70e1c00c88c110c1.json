Then a couple of weeks later, we walked into a room and they\u2019re all sat there and I was like, \u201coh my God hi!\" \u2019\n\nSeveral other Love Island stars were also said to have auditioned for the group with Wes saying they trusted the 'process'.\n\nHe said: 'With this process, we\u2019re completely new to this. This is not our forte, we have no expertise on this, so you just trust the process.\n\n\u2018They obviously heard numerous people audition \u2013 so they put us together so they must feel we sound good together.\n\nGroup: Wes Nelson, 21, Samira Mighty, 22, Zara McDermott, 23, and Eyal Booker, 24, all auditioned separately and were put together by producers (pictured in October 2019)\n\n\u2018And when we sat in the room together for the first time, we were like, \u201cis this going to work? We don\u2019t know?\u201d But then when we did start to sing together, we just got stronger since.\u2019\n\nThe group believe the fact they are already well-known before doing The X Factor could be something of a double-edged sword.\n\nAsked if he think it will make taking part in the show more difficult, Eyal said: \u2018In some ways yes, because people already have a preconception of us having been in the public eye.\n\n'But one the other hand, maybe not because we\u2019re used to public scrutiny and people hating on us.\u2019\n\nShow: Several other Love Island stars were also said to have auditioned for the group with Wes saying they trusted the 'process' (pictured in October 2019)\n\nSamira added: \u2018People talking about you positively or negatively is quite hard going in without a profile, so you need to adjust yourself to the life after, but we\u2019ve already had the exposure.\u2019\n\nOther Love Island stars have been supportive of the group trying their hand as singers.\n\nWes said: \u2018I\u2019ve had so many in the DMs when I\u2019ve shared it on my Stories like \u201coh my God, I\u2019m so happy you\u2019re doing it, you\u2019re finally doing something with your voice\u201d.\n\n'All these Islanders were in the villa with us so they\u2019ve heard us singing around the villa.'\n\nZara added: We weren\u2019t in the villa to sing, we were there to find love so it wasn\u2019t really in their interest to put any singing in the show I suppose.\n\n'I don\u2019t think they\u2019re allowed to anyway. This is the most terrifying thing we\u2019ve ever done.\u2019\n\nFame: The group believe the fact they are already well-known before doing The X Factor could be something of a double-edged sword (pictured in October 2019)\n\nStrictly Come Dancing's Brendan Cole and actor Jeremy Edwards, who together are known as Cole and Edwards, are also part of the groups category.\n\nThe pair admitted they likely have the least amount of singing experience out of all the celebrities taking part.\n\nHowever, Jeremy did think some of the criticism directed at them from judges Randy Jackson and Howie Mendel was harsh.\n\nHe told MailOnline: 'This was just me, I can\u2019t speak for Brendan on this\u2026 Brendan is more used to it than I am. They edited down quite a lot of what Howie said and I\u2019m gonna be completely honest with you, I don\u2019t think a lot of it was necessary.\n\n'That\u2019s all cos I don\u2019t mind criticism, and certain things didn\u2019t work but certain things did and there was a lot of positives there, but A, he talked for ages and B, it was negative, negative, negative.'\n\nContenders: Jeremy Edwards and Brendan Cole, who together are known as Cole and Edwards, are also part of the groups category (pictured in October 2019)\n\nBrendan added: 'Luckily Nicole [Scherzinger] and Simon [Cowell] were really nice to us.'\n\nThe pair also added that they would not be too impressed if they are deemed the novelty act of this series.\n\nJeremy said: \u2018I\u2019d find that insulting!\u2019\n\nBrendan added: \u2018We didn\u2019t come on the show to be as good as everyone else. Next week there is some phenomenal singing on the airways!\n\n\u2018We didn\u2019t come in to be the best singers, that\u2019s apparent, but all of us have got something about us. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve been in our different careers for so many years.'\n\nGlee star Kevin McHale previously sang frequently as a castmember on the hit musical series.\n\nHowever, the actor believes there is a big difference between singing as the character he played and now performing as himself.\n\nPerformer: Glee star Kevin McHale previously sang frequently as a castmember on the hit musical series (pictured in October 2019)\n\nHe said: 'When you\u2019re a character you have everything to fall back on - you have the writer who made this happen, the person who chose the song and if it sucks it doesn\u2019t matter because the character chose to do that.\n\n'I haven\u2019t sung live since the Glee tour in 2011 but we were singing as characters so I probably haven\u2019t sung as myself since I was 17 which is a whole different thing, and I was in a boy band then so does that even count?\u2019\n\nYouTube stars Max and Harvey were already fans of The X Factor before taking part and found it surreal to audition in front of Simon.\n\nHarvey said: \u2018Honestly, just to think that is what every single contestant that has ever been on the show in the past, for what, 15 years now? It\u2019s just completely weird and surreal.\n\n\u2018Just to be at the age that we are now, to flick the switch and be in the position of all of these people, it\u2019s crazy for us.\u2019\n\nThe X Factor: Celebrity starts October 12 on ITV at 8.35pm.", "description": "Wes Nelson, 21, Samira Mighty, 22, Zara McDermott, 23, and Eyal Booker, 24, told MailOnline they all auditioned to take part in the show separately and were put together by producers.", "authors": ["Ellie Phillips", "Sean O'Grady For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/14/19589830-0-image-a-221_1570800630027.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
