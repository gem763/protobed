This upwards momentum has sent it up towards $185, which has previously been a strong level of support for the cryptocurrency.\n\nNow analysts are noting that Ethereum\u2019s network is expressing significant strength, which may be a positive sign for the cryptocurrency\u2019s near-term price action.\n\nEthereum Surges Towards $185\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is trading up over 3% at its current price of $185, which marks a significant recovery from its recent lows of roughly $170 that were set earlier this month.\n\nETH has consistently found support around this price level over the past several days and weeks, and its ability to surge today may point to some underlying bullishness that could be significantly extended in the coming days and weeks.\n\nJosh Olszewicz, a popular crypto analyst on Twitter, spoke about Ethereum\u2019s price action in a recent tweet, concisely saying \u201chere\u2019s your $ETH hopium\u201d and pointing to chart that shows a short-term long target at $320.\n\nThis target came about after Olszewicz said that all the indicators are resetting for BTC which, in addition to its dwindling volume and volatility, points to the possibility that a \u201cface rip\u201d move is imminent.\n\n\u201cIndicators/oscillators all resetting or reset on $BTC. Volume basically dead, volatility plummeting. OI nearing infinity on bmex and dbit. Face rip move coming soon,\u201d he said.\n\nindicators/oscillators all resetting or reset on $BTC volume basically dead, volatility plummeting OI nearing infinity on bmex and dbit face rip move coming soon \u2014 Josh Olszewicz (@CarpeNoctom) September 14, 2019\n\nETH Network Showing Major Strength\n\nIt is critical to note that Bitcoin\u2019s hash rate \u2013 which many analysts look towards as a sign of its network strength \u2013 recently surged to all-time-highs. Ethereum\u2019s network is also showing signs of significant underlying strength.\n\nChris Burniske, a partner at Placeholder, explained in a recent tweet that the recent surge in ETH\u2019s gas usage \u2013 which just hit an all-time-high \u2013 signals that demand for the Ethereum network is incredibly high at the moment.\n\n\u201cThis can be read as: demand for #Ethereum\u2019s world computer is at ATH,\u201d he noted.\n\nThis can be read as: demand for #Ethereum\u2019s world computer is at ATH. https://t.co/lV1hZEBOtc \u2014 Chris Burniske (@cburniske) September 14, 2019\n\nThis fundamental robustness may signal that significantly further gains are imminent, as widespread network utility may ultimately be followed by a surge in the cryptocurrency\u2019s price, which is currently reclaiming what previously proved to be a strong support level.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.", "description": "Analysts are noting that Ethereum\u2019s network is expressing significant strength, which may be a positive sign for ETH's near-term price action.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/shutterstock_1300066633-1200x780.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
