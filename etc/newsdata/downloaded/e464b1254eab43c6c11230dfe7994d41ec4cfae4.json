He is weighing how best to address the issue of violence and calculating which policies would actually work. It\u2019s not a simple task, and it requires careful consideration of two facts that media outlets would rather ignore: Universal background checks and \u201cassault weapons\u201d bans aren\u2019t the solution.\n\nUniversal background checks would do nothing to stop mass shootings. The simple fact remains that all mass shooters in recent history passed a background check except for three \u2014 two of whom stole their firearms and one of whom reports say bought his rifle from an illegal manufacturer.\n\nThe House will hear testimony regarding a ban on so-called assault weapons. This is equally ineffective. America banned what anti-gun activists call \u201cassault weapons\u201d from 1994 to 2004, and two independent Justice Department studies found that the ban had no impact on crime.\n\nSemiautomatic rifles are popular in America today, with more than 16 million in circulation. They are used in less than 2% of firearm homicides. That means every time an \u201cassault weapon\u201d was misused, nearly 16 million weren\u2019t. The media obsession with these firearms erroneously leads the public to believe they\u2019re used in most mass killings. That\u2019s not true. Perpetrators have used fire, knives, vehicles and other firearms to commit heinous acts.\n\nOUR VIEW: Donald Trump called for 'strong background checks' after El Paso and Dayton. Now? Crickets\n\nRally near the Tennessee State Capitol in 2018. More\n\nThe Second Amendment protects firearms in common use. These rifles are used safely every day for hunting, competition and self-defense. But that hasn\u2019t deterred anti-gun states from attempting to ban them.\n\nAmerica\u2019s violent crime rate is at historically low levels. We should look to the solutions that led to dramatic reductions in violent crime during the 1990s and that don\u2019t strip Americans of their constitutionally protected right to defend themselves. We must fix our broken mental health system and the revolving-door justice system that fails to hold criminals accountable.\n\nJason Ouimet is executive director of the National Rifle Association Institute for Legislative Action.\n\nIf you can't see this reader poll, please refresh your page.\n\nWhat do you think of the NRA's view?\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: NRA: Universal background checks won\u2019t stop mass killings", "description": "President Trump is calculating which policies would actually work, writes Jason Ouimet, executive director of the NRA Institute for Legislative Action", "authors": ["Jason Ouimet", "Opinion Contributor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/BGgHTAz0EdclFNx5.VBgvA--~B/aD0zMzMzO3c9NTAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_opinion_532/ab0447c85ed5235ea4e0ed07820bb598", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
