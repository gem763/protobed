Amex won't require a personal guarantee from the founder, and there won't be any effect on their personal credit score. Instead, data from the startup's linked business bank account will be used to determine spending power.\n\nThe card is invite-only, but startups are able to request more information from AmEx's website.\n\n\"Typically, these are startups that are in or around Series A or B funding and are looking to grow and scale quickly,\" Courtney Kelso, the senior vice president for commercial-card products and consulting at American Express, said in emailed comments to Business Insider. \"We know from talking to prospects and customers that this product is of interest.\"\n\nThe rise of the startup's startup\n\nThe business of catering specifically to startups has grown in recent years.\n\nFrom banking services to work spaces and corporate cards, companies, many of them startups in their own right, are recognizing the opportunity in offering services to new businesses on the rise.\n\nMany of these fintechs directed at startup clients are addressing a particular pain point startup founders face: access to capital. Traditional card issuers are typically reluctant to offer startups a corporate line of credit, and if they do, founders may have to personally guarantee payments or provide security deposits.\n\nMost notably, there is Brex, one of Silicon Valley's hottest fintechs. The fintech offers corporate cards to startups without requiring a founder's personal guarantee. Reaching unicorn status in just two years, Brex is valued at $2.6 billion as of its latest funding in June.\n\nRead more: Brex, the $2.6 billion credit card company for startups, explains why it's getting closer to traditional finance with its new Brex Cash bank account product\n\nThis month, Brex announced the launch of Brex Cash, an SIPC-insured account, marking the fintech's push into traditional banking products.\n\nLast year, Brex told Business Insider that along with Chase, AmEx was one of its top competitors. \"I'm not sure if they're aware of us. I'm not sure if they're threatened,\" cofounder Henrique Dubugras said.\n\nBrex's risk model is similar to that of the new AmEx product. Brex looks at the cash and equity raised by a startup, as well as the company's spending patterns, to determine credit limits. Amex's dynamic spending limits adjust with \"business-bank-account activity, spending, and other factors,\" Kelso said.\n\nRead more: Rho, a digital bank aimed at startups, is launching this month. Its cofounders told us why 'move fast, break things' doesn't work in fintech.\n\nBrex isn't the only startup looking to service its peers. Rho, for one, is a digital bank specifically for startups, which offers a cash-back corporate card in addition to checking accounts with 1% annual percentage yield.\n\nStripe, which started as a payments-processing startup, recently announced plans to offer loans to its customers. The fintech, which is valued at $35 billion as of September, provides physical points of sale, credit-card-payments processing, and working capital to startups.\n\nHowever, Kelso stands by the fact that while a specific product did not exist, early-stage companies were already part of their customer base.\n\n\"While we haven't always offered a corporate solution to startups, startups have been using our business and consumer products for years,\" she said.", "description": "AmEx's new launch will bring it into competition with buzzy fintechs like Brex, which offers corporate cards to startups.", "authors": ["Shannen Balogh"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da8d8574af9093d0556dcca?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
