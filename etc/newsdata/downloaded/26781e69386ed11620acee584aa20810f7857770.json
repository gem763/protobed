Fiji are a side packed full of first\u2011class talent, who many fancied to make the quarter-finals. Alas, they are now reduced to trying to throw a spanner in someone else\u2019s works (Wales\u2019s). Otherwise, the key game in this pool was Wales-Australia, won by the former in just the sort of bloody-minded fashion they have made their own lately.\n\nWhat\u2019s still at stake? Fiji may yet throw that spanner on Wednesday but it would be of limited use to them. Wales finish against Uruguay on Sunday and will surely take maximum points. In which case it would be Australia who likely benefit, the Wallabies finishing with a game against Georgia on Friday. An upset there is not quite out of the question, but it would be big \u2013 of Tonga\u2011France-in-2011 proportions, if not quite Brighton 2015. If Wales beat Fiji (and they are currently 17-point favourites to do so) they will top the group with a win over Uruguay, which would pitch Australia into the England\u2011New Zealand side of the draw. Fiji look safe for third place, which would mean Georgia back on the qualification beat for 2023.", "description": "Minute-by-minute report: Will Wales maintain their 100% record in Pool D when they face Fiji?
