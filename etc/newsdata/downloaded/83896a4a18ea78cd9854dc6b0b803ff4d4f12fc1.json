He\u2019s on page 129 as the #63 richest person in America, and I\u2019m mentioned by name on p. 22 for my gross output (GO) model. (I took a more academic road to success.)\n\nIn this issue, Steve Forbes endorses my GO model, saying GO is a \u201cfar more comprehensive, realistic and enlightening picture than GDP. It\u2019s like the difference between an X-ray and a CAT scan.\u201d\n\nGO measures spending at all stages of production, including the all-important supply chain, and gross domestic product (GDP) measures final output only. Big difference!\n\nGDP is $21 trillion in 2019, while GO is over $45 trillion.\n\nGO not only demonstrates that business spending is far more important than consumer spending, but it\u2019s also a leading indicator. GO has slowed considerably in 2019, suggesting we are heading toward a mild recession.\n\nIn his column, Forbes takes the federal officials at the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) to task for not releasing GO on a timely basis. It comes out three months later than GDP! (The next release is Oct. 29 for second-quarter GO.)\n\nForbes stated, \u201cPresident Trump should immediately order the BEA to get off its duff and issue GO at the same time it does GDP.\u201d\n\nGood news! I\u2019m pleased to announce that Brian Moyer, the BEA director, informed me that they plan to release both GO and GDP at the same time by next year\u2026 not unlike publicly traded companies issuing \u201ctop line\u201d (sales) and \u201cbottom line\u201d (profits) every quarter. Economics finally has caught up to accounting and finance in the 21st century!\n\nSteve Forbes\u2019 column on GO is now available to read by clicking here.\n\nThe post SKOUSEN: Steve Forbes on the GO and I Make the Forbes 400 Richest Issue! appeared first on Stock Investor.", "description": "Charles Schwab and I have several things in common \u2014 .10/10/2019 14:34:25PM EST.", "authors": ["Mark Skousen", "Katie Pavlich", "Guy Benson", "Julio Rosas", "Bronson Stocking", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
