Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) isn\u2019t just a random backbench member of Congress. He\u2019s the top Republican in the U.S. House, and he\u2019d likely be elevated to the House Speaker\u2019s office in the event of a GOP takeover of the chamber.\n\nThe California Republican is also a close ally of Donald Trump and the White House, who\u2019s helped take the lead in his party for defending the president against the Ukraine scandal.\n\nIt\u2019s just not going especially well for him.\n\nOn CBS\u2019 60 Minutes two weeks ago, McCarthy seemed inexplicably lost when told that Trump told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, \u201cI would like you to do us a favor, though.\u201d Last week, the House Minority Leader told Fox News, \u201cYou watch what the president said, he\u2019s not saying China should investigate.\u201d In reality, Trump stood on the White House South Lawn, appeared in front of a significant group of journalists, and literally said, \u201cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens.\u201d\n\nAll of which led to this morning\u2019s press briefing with the House Republican leadership.\n\nQ: I hear all of you attacking the impeachment process but none of you defending the president\u2019s actions. Do any of you think it was okay for the president to ask more than one foreign nation to investigate his campaign rival? McCARTHY: The president wasn\u2019t investigating a campaign rival. What the president was trying to get to the bottom, just as every American would want to know, why did we go through two years?\n\nThe Republican leader went on to describe the Russia scandal as a \u201choax,\u201d again in defiance of reality, suggesting that Trump\u2019s focus has been retrospective, not focused on Biden.\n\nI honestly don\u2019t understand what it is that Kevin McCarthy doesn\u2019t understand.\n\nIt\u2019s been nearly a month since the White House released an official call summary of Trump\u2019s July 25 conversation with Zelensky, in which the American president was quoted saying, \u201c[T]here\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with [Attorney General Bill Barr] would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it \u2026 It sounds horrible to me.\u201d\n\nA week after that call summary was released to the public, Trump stood on the South Lawn of the White House and told reporters on camera, \u201cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens.\u201d The Republican added soon after, \u201cI would say that President Zelensky, if it were me, I would recommend that they start an investigation into the Bidens.\u201d\n\nWith this in mind, when McCarthy says the president wasn\u2019t pursuing an investigation into a domestic political rival, did he just miss these developments? Is he hoping that we missed them? Did he not understand what Trump very clearly said?\n\nWhile we wait for those answers to come into focus, there\u2019s also the larger issue of Republicans continuing to struggle with the root question: is it all right for a president to solicit campaign assistance from a foreign power? Some in the party \u2013 most notably Iowa\u2019s Joni Ernst and Colorado\u2019s Cory Gardner \u2013 have struggled to dodge the question, while Texas\u2019 Ted Cruz actually answered it well.\n\nLeave it to Kevin McCarthy, however, to pretend Trump didn\u2019t say what everyone else heard him say.", "description": "The more Kevin McCarthy tries to defend Trump, the more I don't understand what it is that the House GOP leader doesn't understand.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/04969229_0.jpg?itok=eZO4F1rl", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
