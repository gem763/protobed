That goes against the grain of what super should be, and I think we\u2019ll see some subtle changes that will give people more choice,\u201d Mason says.\n\n\u201cIndependence\u201d is a tricky issue, says Nick Callil, senior consultant and head of the retirement income practice at Willis Towers Watson.\n\n\u201cWhether the government mandates it or not, there is a shift to funds wanting to demonstrate that they have \u2018independent\u2019 trustees. Everyone is grappling with governance, but there is the problem that the people who have the skills that make them attractive as a trustee director have usually worked in the industry.\n\n\u201cBut if we push too hard on the \u2018independence\u2019 aspect, then the most independent person is going to be someone who has never worked anywhere near the industry \u2013 and thus may not have the appropriate skill base. That can be a dilemma \u2013 we don\u2019t want to prioritise independence over competence,\u201d Callil says.\n\nLevel of fees\n\nAn obvious conflict area that the royal commission did not address \u2013 and which requires ongoing work \u2013 is the level of fees, charges and costs in the super industry, says independent governance expert Darren McShane, a former executive director of Hong Kong's mandatory pension regulator.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the classic conflict of interest area, where no matter what safeguards you have around it, there are always two diametrically opposed interests, being those getting the fees versus those paying them. The royal commission didn\u2019t really touch on that, but there\u2019s been a lot of activity from the regulator on that front,\u201d McShane says.\n\nAlex Dunnin, director of research and editorial at financial services research firm Rainmaker Group, says fees are just one aspect of the \u201cefficiency issues\u201d that dog the system \u2013 and which are at least as detrimental as conflicts of interest. \u201cAustralians pay about $32 billion a year in super fund fees, so while everyone focuses on conflicts, the system is just too expensive. It\u2019s great that annual fees have reduced to a 1 per cent benchmark, but given so few funds beat their asset class benchmarks you have to wonder how they can justify charging even 1 per cent,\u201d Dunnin says.\n\nConflicts will always exist, he says, but they are \u201cbeing better managed,\u201d and reducing. \u201cAs long as we have people paid or remunerated in any way from the funds they recommend, advise on or help manage, there will be conflicts. But the point is that conflicts are being pushed out. We need to fix the problem of conflicts of interest, but we also have to fix the problem of the free-riders and rent-seekers that exist in superannuation.\u201d\n\nDeloitte\u2019s Mason says there are \u201cstill too many super funds\u201d \u2013 there are about 100 on offer in the Australian marketplace \u2013 and on efficiency grounds, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) will \u201cget much more serious in the near future\u201d on encouraging mergers. \u201cAPRA won\u2019t do that by saying to funds directly, \u2018You need to merge,\u2019 but it will set tests and minimum criteria for them to meet,\u201d Mason says.\n\nThe mergers issue\n\n\u201cThen they\u2019ll tell the fund, \u2018You\u2019re not meeting these standards, and if you continue not to meet these standards, we will have to rethink your holding an APRA licence and being able to operate your fund.\u2019 So I think we will see mergers continue for some time \u2013 surprisingly, led by the bigger funds, not the smaller funds, who probably should be having those discussions more pressingly.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Mason sees a small number of very large super funds \u2013 about 10 \u2013 and then about 20\u201330 smaller to mid-sized funds serving specific industries, niche players. \u201cThere is a place for both. I don\u2019t agree necessarily with the school of thought that says, \u2018Unless you\u2019re a $30 billion fund you won\u2019t survive \u2013 I think there are some mid-sized funds that will survive because they have a loyal membership and they\u2019re serving a niche industry; and perhaps they\u2019re able to provide some services and insurance cover that more generalist funds can\u2019t provide,\u201d he says.\n\nDunnin also sees mega-funds emerging. \u201cWe can be reasonably certain that the leading 10-to-15 funds will become really dominant. Some of these organisations will become enormous, and become fundamentally different beasts \u2013 mega-investors on a scale we have not seen in Australia. They will have staggeringly large amounts of capital to invest, and they will become massive financial institutions, and global players.''\n\nThe size of the system is \u201ccreating its own problems,\u201d he says. At present, the Australian superannuation pool holds $2.8 trillion, or 145 per cent of Australia's GDP.\n\nAs the system grows, Rainmaker projects it to reach about $8 trillion by 2040. \u201cThat\u2019s got to be managed and we haven\u2019t even begun to think about the ramifications of that. But it\u2019s a great problem to have \u2013 superannuation is a national treasure, and it\u2019s going to be an export opportunity for us. We have to remember that many other countries would die to be in our position,\u201d he says.", "description": "Efficiency issues, such as high fees and under-performance, are prevalent.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3983%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_331%2C$y_306/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/dcd2e4945bdc5e0f5934bb5c6bc24026f5b2175c", "published_at": "2019-06-25"}
