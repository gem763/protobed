Media rush to cover for disgraced congresswoman Katie Hill as she resigns", "language": "en", "text": "Democratic congresswoman Katie Hill has resigned, after explicit evidence emerged that she\u2019d had affairs with multiple staffers, but the spin machine is working overtime to portray her as an innocent victim of \u201crevenge porn.\u201d\n\nHill announced her resignation on Sunday, just four days after the House Ethics Committee launched an investigation into whether she had a sexual relationship with her legislative director, Graham Kelly. The openly bisexual congresswoman has admitted to a relationship with a female campaign staffer \u2013 that affair began before she was elected, and is technically legal. And to hear the media tell it, Hill has done nothing wrong.\n\nAlso on rt.com Katie Hill hell breaks loose as GOP and Dem supporters clash over her naked pics, Nazi tattoo and affair with staffer\n\nAfter a trove of salacious photos, including a nude shot of Hill holding a bong, surfaced on RedState and spread to other conservative outlets, mainstream media rallied to Hill\u2019s defense. Even after her resignation, they have continued running interference, with headlines like \u201cRep. Katie Hill Will Resign After Details Of Her Sex Life Were Published\u201d and \u201cAfter resignation, Katie Hill vows to battle revenge porn, which critics blame for her downfall.\u201d In their telling, it is Hill\u2019s ex-husband, who\u2019d shared the female staffer with Hill in a \u201cthrouple,\u201d who is the villain of the piece. After Hill left him \u2013 for Kelly, he claims \u2013 he allegedly leaked the photos.\n\nThe scandal involves a messy divorce and what is being called \u201crevenge porn\" https://t.co/w1mMyocn5U \u2014 POLITICO (@politico) October 28, 2019\n\nI wish that Katie Hill hadn\u2019t decided to resign. But this is an America that accepts an admitted sexual abuser as president and demands this from women\u2014even when they\u2019re the victims of revenge porn. Read @MoiraDonegan, from last week, on \u201cperfect victims.\u201d https://t.co/emiltRYGWg \u2014 Jamil Smith (@JamilSmith) October 28, 2019\n\nBut Hill isn\u2019t exactly innocent. The first-term congresswoman had the misfortune to be elected in 2018, less than a year after a rule was passed in the House barring representatives from sexual relations with their staff. A bipartisan initiative, championed by Hill\u2019s fellow California Democrats Nancy Pelosi and Jackie Speier, it sailed through the House after four representatives resigned in the space of six months over sexual scandals.\n\nHill holds a special place in history as the first woman to be investigated by the Ethics Committee for an inappropriate relationship with a subordinate. The new rule was passed in the wake of #MeToo, and it\u2019s unlikely members of the House had women in mind when they imagined what unethical behavior would look like. But with the rule now in place, it would be regressive and positively anti-feminist to hold women to a lower standard of behavior than men.\n\nOutlets like Politico and Buzzfeed have avoided pointing this out, instead insisting that women should never be shamed for their sex lives, rules be damned. The people who look at the nude photos are the wrongdoers here, blue-check Democrats declared on Twitter, while acknowledging that there are over 700 \u201crevenge porn pics\u201d in the hands of Republican operatives.\n\nCNN correspondent Kyung Lah said today a GOP operative told her they have over 700 revenge porn pics of Katie Hill.\n\n\n\nImagine Republican men passing around these naked pictures and leering at them. This is sick.\n\n\n\nNo wonder she resigned. She must feel like her life is over. \u2014 Matthew Chapman (@fawfulfan) October 28, 2019\n\nI\u2019m going to curse in this Tweet.\n\n\n\nWe have a President who has been credibly accused of multiple sexual assaults, we have many examples of politicians screwing anyone around, and it is a woman Rep (Katie Hill) who resigns for consensual sex?\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s some straight-up Bullshit. \u2014 Rob Anderson for Louisiana (@RobAnderson2018) October 28, 2019\n\nRepublicans have delighted in pointing out that Hill was a prominent voice opposing the nomination of Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. But Democrats have tried to turn that around, reminding the GOP that several women have accused President Donald Trump of sexual harassment and that at least Hill\u2019s trysts were consensual.\n\nStill, Hill was vice chair of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, making her indiscretions that much more hypocritical. She is expected to step down next week and has promised to \u201cpursue all of our available legal options\u201d against the source of the photos, calling their publication \u201can appalling invasion of my privacy.\u201d\n\nIt is with a broken heart that today I announce my resignation from Congress. This is the hardest thing I have ever had to do, but I believe it is the best thing for my constituents, my community, and our country.\n\n\n\nSee my official statement below. pic.twitter.com/nG97RQIwvO \u2014 Rep.
