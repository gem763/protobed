They\u2019ve failed my dad and they\u2019ve failed the family. We don\u2019t want them to fail anyone else.\u201d\n\nThe Met Office issued a \u201cLevel 2\u201d alert for the \u00adsouth-west of England in the days leading up to the Glastonbury Festival \u00adwarning that the heatwave was \u201cdangerous\u201d.\n\nThe cause of Martin\u2019s death is still unknown with further results expected later this year.\n\nWilliam said the family are angry about how G4S bosses have behaved in the aftermath of his death.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt\u2019s been very cold-hearted. We\u2019re angry that no one checked up on dad for up to 30 hours.\u201d\n\nWidower Martin had worked for G4S on a \u00adzero-hours contract for two years.\n\nHe\u2019d previously spent 19 years caring for wife, \u00adJanette, 62, before she died in 2014.\n\nMartin had worked as a security guard when his two children, \u00adWilliam and Susan, 37, were young.\n\n(Image: Daily Record)\n\nHe was taken on by G4S to work at sporting events and concerts. But his work life was insecure with \u00adperiods of inaction followed by intense 80-hour weeks.\n\nIn June, he was asked by G4S to work at the Download Festival in Leicestershire and Glastonbury in Somerset.\n\nCoincidentally, William attended Glastonbury with other family \u00admembers, including father-in-law Richard Fearn.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe were surprised when my dad said he was \u00adstaying in a tent.\n\n\u201cAn employer shouldn\u2019t be \u00adasking workers to stay in tents in this day and age. He\u2019d done work trips before and they always sorted out accommodation. Dad didn\u2019t even own a tent, so I borrowed one and organised an airbed for\n\nhim.\u201d\n\nAfter working at Download, \u00adMartin travelled to Glastonbury and arranged to meet his son.\n\nWilliam added: \u201cIt was extremely hot. Dad said he wasn\u2019t due to work until the following night.\n\n\u201cWe saw some bands and said goodbye at around 3am. It was the last time I\u2019d see him. I texted him in the afternoon because I didn\u2019t want to wake him.\n\n\u201cI tried contacting him again later but he never responded. It was very noisy and he was working so I\n\nwasn\u2019t surprised.\u201d\n\nMartin\u2019s movements after work remain unclear. But he finished his shift at 8am and used a meal voucher to buy his breakfast in the staff \u00adcanteen. William said: \u201cMy dad wasn\u2019t \u00adparticularly good with phones.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think too much about texts and calls going unanswered.\n\n\u201cHe was also working nights so I thought he must\u2019ve been resting.\u201d\n\nPolice called William after G4S staff made the grim discovery.\n\n(Image: Daily Star)\n\nWilliam added: \u201cI just broke down. Police told me it wasn\u2019t advisable to see his body. I looked around the corner and could just see his toe sticking out from under a cover.\n\n\u201cI wanted to know what had \u00adhappened but G4S staff told police they were too upset to talk to me.\u201d\n\nG4S paid for Martin\u2019s body to be transferred to Scotland. But when they arrived home, William and \u00adRichard began asking questions.\n\nIt was then G4S told them he had been missing for up to 30 hours.\n\nWilliam added: \u201cSome staff go \u00admissing, preferring to go to gigs instead of working but my dad wasn\u2019t like that. He was 64. If he didn\u2019t turn up for work, it should have started alarm bells.\u201d\n\nRichard said: \u201cG4S has stopped answering our calls and only paid Martin\u2019s wages a fortnight ago for the work he\u2019d done before he died. We want to know how this happened.\n\n\u201cWhy did G4S go to his tent on the Sunday morning but not go in?\n\n\u201cThe family think it\u2019s important that workers at Glastonbury are safe and their welfare is monitored.\u201d\n\nA letter sent to the family from Mendip Council said it was \u00ad\u201cshocking\u201d \u00adMartin had been left unchecked for so long.\n\nThe council\u2019s \u00adenvironmental officer Marietta Gill wrote: \u201cI do understand it is not uncommon generally for staff and volunteers to not turn up for their shifts but I would expect a good employer to make \u00adreasonable checks.\n\n\u201cI work closely with Glastonbury Festivals and have been encouraging them to ensure that all people are fully aware of what work they will be expected to do and are informed of how best to look after themselves in pre-event briefing.\n\n\u201cThis year especially we were \u00adconcerned about people who were expected to sleep during the day time, as it was so hot.\u201d\n\nEmergency services said they treated 70 people for \u00adheat-related illnesses at the festival.\n\nUnion GMB, which represents G4S workers, said: \u201cThe circumstances surrounding Mr Fallone\u2019s death are both sad and \u00adtroubling. The Glastonbury Festival generates a fortune.\n\n\u201cIt would be a modest request of the festival organisers to ensure both they and its sub contractors are adhering to decent employment standards and living arrangements during the course of the event.\u201d\n\nAndy Lane, chief operating officer for G4S Secure Solutions UK, said: \u201cMartin Fallone\u2019s death was a tragedy and our thoughts remain with his family at this difficult time.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman added G4S didn\u2019t decide where staff stayed on the \u00adfestival site.\n\nGlastonbury Festival was contacted for comment but did not respond.", "description": "Martin Fallone, of Clydebank, Glasgow, was found a day after he missed a \u00adnightshift - and now his grieving son has criticised G4S for failing to check on him", "authors": ["Gordon Blackstock", "Image", "Daily Record", "Collect", "Daily Star"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article17676505.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Martin-FalloneJPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
