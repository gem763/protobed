It was up 0.3% at $0.67795, as of 0401 GMT.\n\nThe New Zealand dollar was up 0.1% at $0.6324.\n\nBoth the currencies were headed for their third straight weekly rise though the gains were likely to be miniscule.\n\nMarket sentiment turned positive after a first day of trade talks between top U.S. and Chinese negotiators that U.S. President Donald Trump characterised as \"very, very good.\"\n\nA White House official said the talks had gone \"probably better than expected\" and a U.S. Chamber of Commerce official briefed by both sides raised the possibility of a currency agreement this week.\n\nThe broader improvement in risk sentiment led to a sell-off in bonds with yields on New Zealand government notes 0#NZTSY= rising about 6-9 basis points at the short-end of the curve.\n\nThree-year Australian bond contract YTTc1 slid 9 ticks to a 1-1/2-week trough of 99.34. The 10-year contract YTCc1 dipped 1.25 ticks to 98.9850.\n\nDespite the trade optimism, analysts broadly expect the antipodean currencies to remain under pressure.\n\n\"Easier central bank policy has effectively removed the last vestiges of hope for AUD & NZD as these currencies succumb to the USD carry king,\" said Mazen Issa, senior forex strategist, TD Securities.\n\nIn the absence of \"an appreciable and sustained positive global macro impulse, these currencies will continue to languish in FX purgatory.\"\n\nIn Australia, investor attention will be on official employment data for September due on Thursday that is likely to show the jobless rate stayed stuck at a one-year high of 5.3% despite three interest rate cuts by the country's central bank.\n\nThe employment report has become a critical indicator for the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), which is counting on continued job strength to help reduce the spare capacity in the country's labour market.\n\nFinancial futures 0#YIB: are pricing in a 50-50 chance of a fourth rate cut to 0.5% next month.\n\nIn New Zealand, data on retail sales out on Friday showed electronic card spending rose 0.4% in September, double the market expectations but slower than a solid 1.2% in August.\n\n\"Consumers checked their spending habits in September,\" said ASB economist Mike Jones.\n\n\"Looking ahead, a pick-up in housing market activity, falling mortgage rates, and fiscal cash will help support retail spending.\" (Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips)", "description": "Australian, NZ dollars climb on Sino-U.S. trade optimism, bonds sell-off", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/forex_2_800x533_L_1411898837.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
