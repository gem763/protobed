She was saying, 'You have to watch Hindley, mind.\n\n\"'She is very manipulative. You don't realise it, but she gets you doing stuff for her. Oh, she's clever, all right. She's flippin' dangerous, that one. She ain't going to take me for a c*** again.' And so heralded the end of the romance.\"\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nTheir relationship was one of many female relationships West enjoyed from the beginning of her life sentence in prison.\n\nHindley and Brady were convicted in 1966 of killing Lesley Ann Downey, 10 and Edward Evans, 17; and Keith Bennett, 12, and Pauline Reade, 16, in 1987.\n\nHindley died aged 60 in 2002.", "description": "The House of Horrors killer had a relationship with Myra Hindle when they were held in the same prison during the mid 90s, according to reports", "authors": ["Tiffany Lo", "Image", "Pa", "Pa Archive Pa Images", "Press Association", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20651891.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Rosemary-West-collect-photo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
