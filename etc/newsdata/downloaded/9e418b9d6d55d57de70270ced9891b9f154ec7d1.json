There is no uncertainty about that. Why your confusion?\"\n\nAs he spoke, Haros wore a shirt bearing the words by Omar that had offended many.\n\nHe continued: \u201cOn that day 19 Islamic terrorists, members of Al Qaeda, killed over 3,000 people and caused billions of dollars of economic damage. Is that clear?\u201d\n\nHaros told Hannity he has been receiving hate mail for his comments about Omar, but insisted his criticism of the congresswoman wasn't racist or sexist. He said he was hurt by Omar's description of the events and simply wanted to make a statement.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"That hurt. I am a victim's son and I decided to take 9/11 as my one day of perhaps credible standing to make that statement which many people who have told me it represented their views,\" Haros said.\n\nOn Wednesday, Omar tweeted a somber video describing her reaction to 9/11, calling the attacks \"life-changing, life-altering for all of us.\"\n\n\"On September 11th we experienced one of the most horrific terrorist attacks that we have ever lived through as a nation. Today, we remember the victims, the first responders and their loved ones,\" Omar tweeted along with the video.", "description": "Rep.
