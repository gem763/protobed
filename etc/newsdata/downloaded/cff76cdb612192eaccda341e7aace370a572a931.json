The 28-year-old marketing manager coped in part by posting an essay on LinkedIn about how the tragedy affected her work. It drew almost 10,000 page views. \u201cI don\u2019t think grief is talked about enough, especially as it pertains to the workplace,\u201d she says.\n\nMs. Madaio and her late father John, shown here at a Boston Red Sox game, were avid sports fans and attended many New England sports events together.

Not only are they more likely to talk about grieving at work, but they\u2019re also pressuring employers to loosen rigid limits on bereavement leave. While some companies are changing their policies, others are sticking with tight limits.\n\nSome 89% of employers have a bereavement-leave policy, up from 81% in 2016. But the policies tend to define family narrowly and allow as few as three days off for a death in the family. That\u2019s barely enough time to travel to a funeral in a distant state, says Terri Rhodes, chief executive of the nonprofit Disability Management Employer Coalition.\n\nLaura\u2019s employer was far more generous. She needed the entire week after John\u2019s death to help her mother, Sue, and her sister, Molly, arrange John\u2019s funeral and wake, where almost 1,500 people gathered to pay their respects to the Paxton, Mass., attorney. Laura and Sue also spent days sifting through his files and paperwork.\n\n\u201cThe standard bereavement leave doesn\u2019t take into account the logistics of managing a death,\u201d Laura says. \u201cPeople think you\u2019re attending services or curled up in bed. But in reality, we\u2019d never been busier.\u201d\n\nMs. Madaio says speaking up about grieving at work prompted others to share their own stories of loss and bereavement.

Her boss, Sam Iserson, surprised her when he said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take two weeks off for yourself and then we\u2019ll discuss things further?\u201d Later, Mr. Iserson urged Laura to take another five days.\n\n\u201cAfter an event as sudden and tragic as that, I didn\u2019t want her to worry about what was happening here,\u201d says Mr. Iserson, president of NC3 in Rumford, R.I.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nMore large employers are moving in the same direction. Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg announced a doubling of the company\u2019s bereavement leave in 2017 to as much as four weeks, citing her own need for flexibility after the sudden death of her husband in 2015. Both Airbnb and Mastercard mentioned Ms. Sandberg\u2019s experience in announcing 2017 increases in their maximum bereavement leave to 20 days. Adobe also expanded bereavement leave in 2017, followed more recently by General Mills and U.S. Steel.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great opportunity for employers to show up in the moments that really matter,\u201d says LuAnn Heinen, a vice president at National Business Group on Health, an employer group.\n\nA few companies are easing restrictions on the kinds of relationships that qualify for bereavement leave. \u201cMore progressive companies would allow the employee to determine who matters,\u201d Ms. Heinen says. That avoids putting employers in the awkward role of deciding how many days an employee should be allotted to mourn, say, a brother-in-law vs. a romantic partner.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to let employees take their allotted days off intermittently as needed, Ms. Heinen says.\n\nShare Your Thoughts How do you feel about the bereavement policy at your workplace? Join the conversation below.\n\nFor a while after her father\u2019s death, Laura Madaio felt she\u2019d lost her passion and motivation. Gradually, she noticed a change. \u201cI began thinking and saying, \u2018I need to do something really hard,\u2019 \u201d she says. She told her boyfriend, Dylan Vitali, she felt like training for a marathon, opening a restaurant and applying to business school, all at once.\n\nShe stepped up her workouts at the gym. \u201cWhenever I want to dog it or I don\u2019t want to do another rep, I think of Dad,\u201d says Laura, a Division III college athlete who was captain of both her field-hockey and softball teams.\n\nWhen she was invited to interview for a challenging job in an unfamiliar industry, she says, it was difficult to leave an employer who had stood by her in hard times. But she felt the job switch could provide that tough new challenge. Her boss, Meghan Kennelly, says she has set up two new marketing partnerships in her first 10 months at Yamaha Unified Communications, a Sudbury, Mass.-based maker of audio and videoconferencing equipment.\n\nMs. Madaio\u2019s boss Meghan Kennelly, right, shown here in their Sudbury, Mass., offices, gave her the day off on the anniversary of her father\u2019s 2018 death. Photo: Josh Andrus for The Wall Street Journal\n\nLaura has even surprised herself. \u201cIf you\u2019d asked me two years ago what I\u2019d do if my dad died, I\u2019d have told you I\u2019d need to be hospitalized or bedridden,\u201d she says. Instead, while getting through the workday can be a struggle, \u201cI\u2019m probably more motivated than I\u2019ve ever been.\u201d\n\nSome two out of three bereaved individuals respond with similar resilience, says George Bonanno, a psychology professor at Columbia University and author of \u201cThe Other Side of Sadness.\u201d Still, grieving can take a mental toll.\n\nPeople who are shown reminders of deceased loved ones continue for several years to show increased cognitive activity in brain regions tied to emotion, recent research shows. Resilient people tend to suppress those responses. \u201cThey might be sad for a few minutes or an hour, but they go in and out of these states,\u201d Dr. Bonanno says. \u201cIt\u2019s a fleeting consciousness, at the periphery of our awareness.\u201d\n\nIt can be hard to navigate grieving and work at the same time. Laura is sometimes beset by what she calls \u201cbrain fog\u201d: an unfocused mind state that triggers minor errors, such as leaving her laptop at home.\n\nThe good days are starting to outnumber the bad. But the anniversary last August of her father\u2019s death brought renewed sadness, she says.\n\n\u201cI told her to take the day off, on us,\u201d says Ms. Kennelly, a global marketing and communications manager at Yamaha. She did.\n\nWrite to Sue Shellenbarger at sue.shellenbarger@wsj.com", "description": "More companies are putting extra thought into their bereavement leave policies, one of the trickiest elements in any benefits package.", "authors": ["Sue Shellenbarger", "Sue.Shellenbarger Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-120774/social", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
