For fans in his new home city, his gesture Wednesday night might be the biggest home run yet.\n\nAlonso coordinated the purchase and production of custom 9/11 cleats for Mets players to wear on the 18th anniversary of the terrorist attacks. The shoes were painted red, white and blue and included \u201cWe will never forget\u201d and lettering for first responder units.\n\nFollowing the Mets\u2019 9-0 win over the Arizona Diamondbacks, Alonso said he wanted to design hats the Mets could wear on the field, but that idea was rejected by Major League Baseball, which hasn\u2019t allowed the Mets to wear first responder hats during games since 2001.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s kind of sad that first game back, they\u2019ve kind of shot it down every single year since,\u201d Alonso said. \u201cIt\u2019s real unfortunate. So a way to kind of get around that was the cleats.\u201d\n\nAlonso said he went around the Mets locker room and collected shoe sizes and preferred brands for each teammate. He said he didn\u2019t contact Major League Baseball about the cleats.\n\n\u201cI feel like if Major League Baseball kind of got their hands on it, it may not have been approved,\u201d Alonso said. \u201cBut I\u2019m really happy that we kind of banded together here in the clubhouse and made something cool happen.\u201d\n\nThe cleats were just the latest in Alonso\u2019s efforts to assist those impacted by the attacks. After winning the All-Star Home Run Derby in July, Alonso donated $50,000 of his $1 million prize to the Tunnels to Towers Foundation.\n\nPrior to the first pitch Wednesday night, children who lost parents or grandparents to 9/11-related illnesses ran to each position before being joined by the Mets\u2019 starters. Alonso gave autographed baseballs to the two children at first base.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the victims, it\u2019s the scars left behind, like someone missing their mom or missing their dad,\u201d Alonso said. \u201cFor me, I can\u2019t imagine what that\u2019s like. The toll isn\u2019t necessarily all taken on that day, it\u2019s progressively after because there\u2019s not someone there in their family. It\u2019s different from then on.\u201d\n\nBoth the Mets and Diamondbacks wore first responder hats during batting practice, then lined up on their respective baselines alongside firefighters, police and EMTs prior to the national anthem.\n\nThe Mets ended the game with nine runs on 11 hits.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Pete Alonso has been full of surprises during a memorable rookie season with the Mets.
