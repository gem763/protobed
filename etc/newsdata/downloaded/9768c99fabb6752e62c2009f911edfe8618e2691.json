The company also reported a wider-than-expected C$0.29 loss per share compared to the C$0.06 loss analysts polled by Bloomberg had been bracing for.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re asking if we\u2019re a little red-faced, yes we are,\u201d Aurora\u2019s Chief Corporate Officer Cam Battley told Yahoo Finance, blaming the miss on the company\u2019s ancillary businesses. \u201cIf you take a look at our core business, our cannabis businesses, we came in exactly where we guided for which was between C$90 [million] and C$95 [million] and we came in at C$95 million.\u201d\n\nBattley listed the company\u2019s construction division and analytics testing labs for the weakness in ancillary segments.\n\nThe symbol for Aurora Cannabis appears above a trading post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange as the Canadian company lists, Tuesday, Oct. 23, 2018. (AP Photo/Richard Drew) More\n\n\u201cIn the beginning of the year, we were targeting positive EBITDA in our fourth quarter, the June quarter of this year,\u201d he said. \u201cAt that point we were anticipating \u2014 as I think everybody else was \u2014 that there would be more retail stores open in Canada.\u201d\n\nAs the largest seller of recreational cannabis in Canada, Battley said the fact that stores have been slower to open has \u201cdisproportionately\u201d impacted Aurora\u2019s sales. Other Canadian cannabis companies that have been hammered for slowing growth have pointed to the same theme on earnings calls.\n\nGross margins a bright spot\n\nLooking for a silver lining from the quarter, Battley highlighted that gross margins continue to improve \u2014 something that competitor Canopy Growth was not able to say in their latest quarter. Aurora\u2019s margins inched higher to 58% from 55% last quarter.\n\n\u201cThat would make any other cannabis company green with envy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reason why we\u2019re able to generate increased margin is because even though [our] average selling price came down, because we were selling more in the consumer market and a little bit less proportionately in medical, [is] we actually brought our cost of production \u2014 our cash cost to produce \u2014 came way down to about C$1.14 [per gram.]\u201d\n\nFor now, that silver lining wasn\u2019t enough to reverse what has been continued pressure for Aurora and the sector overall. Aurora shares are now down about 25% over the past three months.\n\nZack Guzman is the host of YFi PM as well as a senior writer and on-air reporter covering entrepreneurship, startups, and breaking news at Yahoo Finance.
