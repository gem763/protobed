The sanction is nowhere near strong enough for what has happened.\n\n\"He might be a dentist again next year, whereas we will be without Magzine forever.\"\n\nAt a hearing on October 14, a GDC professional conduct panel suspended Dr Patel for 12 months.\n\n(Image: Gordon family / SWNS)\n\nPatel, who has 30 years' experience, admitted the allegations of misconduct that were put to him.\n\nAccording to the report, he expressed remorse and has apologised to the patient's family.\n\nBut Magzine's siblings have said no one in the family has received an apology from Dr Patel.\n\nDawn paid tribute to her sister, who she described as a \"committed\" community volunteer who loved to help other people.\n\n\"She had lots of friends and did so much for the local community\", said Dawn.\n\n\"She set up a support group for the LGBT community and was always smiling, was always happy and was a very positive person.\n\n\"Magzine was only concerned about fighting other people's corner and always stood up for people.\n\n\"She loved to help people and we are very proud of her for that.\"\n\nDuring her time working for the Department for Work and Pensions she was proud of her work on policies for 2012 Paralympic Games, in London, her family said.\n\n(Image: Gordon family / SWNS)\n\nA JustGiving page was set up in Magzine's memory by one of her dearest friends, Janet Connelly, to raise money for LGBT charity London Friend.\n\nOn there she paid tribute to her \"passionate friend\" who was \"so sharp, full of sparkle and loud and infectious\".\n\nOther friends described her as \"an amazing woman\".", "description": "Magzine Gordon, who was an LGBT activist and charity volunteer, died after dentist Tushar Patel removed all her top teeth in two sessions in the same week", "authors": ["Jack Longstaff", "Image", "Gordon Family", "Swns"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20736842.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SWNS_DENTIST_DEATH_02.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
