That's a reference to White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney.\n\nThe New York Times reported that Bolton had a tense encounter with Sondland on July 10 and instructed Hill to notify Eisenberg about Sondland's work with Giuliani and Mulvaney.\n\nBut the person familiar with Sondland's account said Tuesday that neither Bolton nor Hill raised any concerns directly with him.\n\nTo bolster his account that officials did not sound the alarms to him about the Ukraine activities, Sondland is prepared to describe the aftermath of a meeting he had with Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Kurt Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine.\n\nHill claimed Bolton was so disquieted by the back-channel activities that he referred to Giuliani as a 'hand grenade who is going to blow everybody up'\n\nPresident Trump had his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani working as a key emissary for Ukraine policy\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said while sitting next to Trump at a press conference that Trump didn't put any pressure on him to investigate the Bidens\n\nPerry soon after summarized the discussion to Bolton, recounting internal deliberations within the administration about when to organize the call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, according to a readout of the communication described by a person who insisted on anonymity to discuss private conversations.\n\nPerry told Bolton that he, Volker and Sondland were in agreement that the call should be held sooner than later to demonstrate support for Ukraine and to develop the relationship with the two countries, with the expectation that Ukraine would embrace unimpeded investigations and clean up corruption.\n\nBut he told Bolton that other staff wanted to wait until there was something more substantive to talk about. Bolton at that time did not bring up any concerns about Giuliani or the discussions, the person said.\n\nThat phone call, now the basis of a whistleblower complaint, took place on July 25 and involved Trump repeatedly prodding Zelenskiy to investigate Biden's son, Hunter.\n\nAt the time, the Trump administration was withholding hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid from Ukraine.\n\nSondland, who had agreed to be interviewed without a subpoena, was to have testified last week as part of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nBut the White House blocked him, with Trump tweeting that he would be 'testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court.' House Democrats subpoenaed Sondland, and he agreed to comply.\n\nOn Thursday, he is expected to be asked about text messages that show him and two other U.S. diplomats acting as intermediaries as Trump urged Ukraine to investigate the 2016 U.S. election and Burisma, the company linked to Biden's son, Hunter.\n\nOne of the texts shows Sondland addressing another envoy's concerns about whether military aid was being withheld in exchange for the investigations by saying the diplomat, William 'Bill' Taylor, was 'incorrect about President Trump's intentions. The president has been crystal clear no quid pro quo's of any kind.'\n\nSondland is expected to say that the reassurance about there being no quid pro quo was based solely on what Trump told him in a phone call before he sent the text.\n\nHe is also expected to say that he did not associate Burisma with the Biden family and viewed the emphasis on investigating corruption as part of a goal shared broadly across the administration.\n\nSondland, a wealthy hotelier and philanthropist, took an unconventional path to the diplomatic post and to supporting Trump himself.\n\nHe initially backed Jeb Bush during the Republican primary, but ultimately donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee.", "description": "Sondland's appearance in Washington tomorrow comes three days after former White House aide Fiona Hill testified that John Bolton had called Giuliani a 'hand grenade' over his Ukraine dealings.", "authors": ["Ross Ibbetson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/12/19785030-0-image-a-3_1571225833741.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
