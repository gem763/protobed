Russell apologised unreservedly after Year 10 and 11 students were filmed yelling the vile chant which includes the line, \u201cI wish that all the ladies were holes in the road. And if I was a dump truck I\u2019d fill them with me load\u201d, on a public tram in Melbourne last Saturday. The students were said to be on their way to a sports carnival.\n\n\u201cWe have always and will continue to challenge such poor behaviour and misogynistic attitudes through programs at school and with the co-operation of parents,\u201d Russell said in a statement to media at the time.\n\nIt is understood a number of students were suspended on Tuesday.\n\nThe new video is blurry but appears to show St Kevin\u2019s students in casual clothes yelling the chant in a public space. The Herald Sun reports the video was posted during an argument between St Kevin\u2019s students and female students of a sister school.\n\nThe female student who posted the video had called out the schoolboys for trying to defend St Kevin\u2019s after they said the exact \u201csame fucking words on your year 12 celebration night.\u201d\n\n\u201cU didn\u2019t have to make it this easy to prove my point by filming it and posting it on your story guys, so Thank You!\u201d she commented, per The Herald Sun. \u201cOne time, a bad choice maybe. Twice? Maybe try and change your school song.\u201d\n\nThe entire thing has since been wiped from Facebook.\n\nFormer student Luke Kiernan, now a tutor at the school, told the ABC he emailed the college to raise his concerns over Saturday\u2019s incident.\n\n\u201cThere is a wide-scale disrespect towards women, not at a superficial level, but more deeply,\u201d Kiernan wrote in the email.\n\nAfter speaking out, Kiernan\u2019s school portrait on the High Academic Achiever\u2019s Board was vandalised with the words \u201ctraitor\u201d and \u201csnitch\u201d.\n\nKiernan told news.com.au that he has received \u201cquite a lot of harassment\u201d for his actions.\n\n\u201cWhen somebody cuts against the grain, they are absolutely victimised because you\u2019re not allowed to leave the \u2018boys\u2019 club\u2019 and you\u2019re certainly not allowed to criticise it publicly.\u201d\n\nPEDESTRIAN.TV has reached out to St. Kevin\u2019s for comment.\n\nIn a recent newsletter to parents, obtained by news.com.au, Russell said the school has started to speak to students from Year 5 upwards, about the offensive and misogynistic behaviour.\n\n\u201cSadly, we are aware that the use of misogynistic language such as in the chant on Saturday, is more widespread than we understood and this knowledge has intensified our determination to resolutely reshape our programs and to look to do so much in this area.\u201d\n\nRussell also appeared to acknowledge and denounce the new video, writing \u201cthat some recent graduates foolishly and recklessly thought it would be amusing, when they were celebrating, to use this horrible chant.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE Elite Private School Apologises After Students Yell Fucked Sexist Chant On Melbourne Tram", "description": "Another video, said to be of St Kevin's College students, has emerged showing the recent graduates chanting that same sexist chant at a pub crawl on Monday.", "authors": ["Steffanie Tan"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-25-at-12.31.59-pm.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
