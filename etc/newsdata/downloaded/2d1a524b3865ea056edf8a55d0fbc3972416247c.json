My son even struggles to breathe and his chest is not good because of the damp which is a worry.\n\n\"My son isn't developing properly because he's constantly ill, his speech is delayed, and it's physically stressing me out. I feel completely drained all of the time.\"\n\nThe mum-of-one added: \"I feel let down. I've got a young child and I just want to be moved because I'm depressed living here, I don't want to be here anymore. I can't stand it every day.\n\n\"They should have re-plastered the walls when I originally complained and before I noticed the plaster beetles. If they'd fixed it at the start then this could have been avoided.\"\n\nA council spokesman said: \"All work to resolve the issues reported were completed in May.\n\n\"Ms Smith also expressed an interest in moving to Newcastle in April. She was given contact details by our housing team for organisations which manage properties in Newcastle. We have not heard from her since.\"", "description": "Mum-of-one Hayley Smith, 23, says she struggles to sleep at night in her Stoke-on-Trent home \"because I'm constantly itching from the beetles crawling over my skin\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20740254.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Tenant-Hayley-Smith-is-demanding-to-be-re-housed-after-claiming-plaster-beetles-are-leaving-her-an.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
