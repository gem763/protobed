For the final event of the year, Shiseido WTA Finals Shenzhen, Ukraine\u2019s world No. 8 and defending champion Elina Svitolina reflects on her year and outlines her plans for the off-season.\n\nThis is the end of another long, gruelling season; one full of highs and lows.\n\nOn the one hand, I reached two Grand Slam semi-finals \u2013 I\u2019d never gone that far in a major before this year \u2013 but I set my sights higher than that and it\u2019s been a year where I\u2019ve struggled to be fully fit.\n\nI\u2019ve had a knee problem since February, which disrupted my preparations for Roland Garros but I took a lot of confidence from runs to the semi-finals at Wimbledon and the US Open.\n\nElina Svitolina is looking to defend her WTA Finals title (Picture: WTA)\n\nThey obviously boosted my ranking but also gave me extra belief that my tennis is capable of reaching the level required to achieve my future goals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQualifying for the Shiseido WTA Finals Shenzhen \u2013 the final event of our season \u2013 is always a goal and I\u2019m glad to have the opportunity to defend the title I won in Singapore 12 months ago.\n\nBeing among the top-eight players in the world is always a big honour. It\u2019s a great chance to reflect on the fact you\u2019ve had a good enough year to be part of this group. Given my injury problems this season, it\u2019s particularly satisfying that I\u2019ve managed to get here again.\n\nAlthough I will be giving everything to win the title at the inaugural event in Shenzhen and my focus is not straying from the task at hand, I am definitely ready for a period of rest and recuperation after another long year.\n\nI like to put my racquet away and do yoga and pilates at this time of year as well as some cardio-focused boxing classes but I will obviously be doing a lot of rehab work on my knee so it\u2019s fully ready for the new season.\n\nI\u2019m not really planning a sunny getaway as such, I\u2019ll spend most of my time off in Europe.\n\nMy boyfriend and ATP tennis player Gael Monfils still has a few weeks left of his season and he is still hoping to reach the season-ending ATP Finals in London \u2013 the men\u2019s equivalent of the event I\u2019ll be competing in this week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe will also be heading to Madrid for the Davis Cup finals so I will be there to support him out there.\n\nI\u2019ll also take some time for myself and will head to Ukraine to see my family as well as host an auction for my charity, the Elina Svitolina Foundation, in Kiev in November.\n\nThen in about a month\u2019s time I will probably head out to Dubai to step up my pre-season preparations, building up my fitness and, of course, trying to work on my game.\n\nI\u2019ll be doing everything in my power to be 100% ready for the new season and it helps that these days I know exactly how I\u2019m scheduling a year, so I don\u2019t really need to worry about where I\u2019ll be and when because it\u2019s all second nature now I\u2019m a little bit more experienced.\n\nMy coach, Andrew Bettles, is my regular hitting partner but we\u2019ll also look to have five days or so in a month with other players in order to see if what we\u2019ve been working on is working.\n\nI\u2019m normally in big cities so it\u2019s quite easy to find other players to hit with.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor example, last year I was in London and doing some work at the National Training Centre and there would be some other English girls working down there who I could have training sessions with. The same will be true in Dubai.\n\nWe normally have a little think about who could be there and send a few messages out to them to see if they fancy getting together for a session.\n\nI set my sights high and nothing will change for the new season.\n\nElina Svitolina fact file Age: 25\n\nNationality: Ukrainian\n\nCurrent ranking: 8\n\nCareer-high ranking: 3\n\nBest Grand Slam result: Semi-finals (US Open, 2019/Wimbledon, 2019)\n\nMy aim is to win a Grand Slam, to win as many titles as I can and become world No. 1. But I also really just want to improve my game.\n\nI want to be physically strong, to be consistent, and that consistency will then bring the best out of me and allow me to get to the top of the women\u2019s game.\n\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019m looking for and it\u2019s important to be mentally fresh. Our seasons are the longest in sport so you have to be ready for a big, long slog. A period of rest will definitely help on that front.\n\nI don\u2019t want to get too far ahead of myself, though, and I\u2019ve still got business to take care of this week.
