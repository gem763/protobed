And \u2026 that scared my mother.\u201d\n\nRosanne said Cash wrote his hit \u201cI Walk the Line\u201d about her mother Vivian Liberto\u2019s constant fear that the charismatic musician would step out on their marriage.\n\n\u201cHe wrote, \u2018I\u2019m gonna stay true,\u2019\u201d Rosanne says during Burns\u2019 program. \u201cOf course that wasn\u2019t true.\u201d\n\nRosanne was the eldest of four daughters and remembers her father as \u201cthe sweetest dad,\u201d but noted there were difficult periods with her father in their household due to his battle with addiction.\n\nJOHNNY CASH-THEMED RESTAURANT OPENING IN NASHVILLE IN LATE SPRING\n\nCash would begin a romantic relationship with June Carter, a member of Cash\u2019s touring cast, which led to Liberto filing for divorce from the \u201cFolsom Prison Blues\u201d performer in 1966.\n\nCash and Carter would tie the knot two years later after Cash had gotten clean.\n\nThe \"Composed\" author admitted to the magazine that she never harbored any ill will towards Carter. In fact, she praised both her mother and Carter.\n\n\u201cI had two really good examples from women in my life,\u201d Rosanne said.\n\n\u201cIt seemed inevitable, though it was so painful for my mom,\u201d Rosanne said of Cash\u2019s affair with Carter. \u201cMy mom gave me this powerful sense of discipline, family, mothering and detail orientation. And June gave me this sense of expansiveness and how to live life as a performer.\u201d\n\nGREG LAURIE: JOHNNY CASH'S STORY IS A ROADMAP FOR EVERY CONFLICTED SOUL\n\nRosanne ultimately followed in her father\u2019s footsteps, but she initially only wanted to be a writer because she didn\u2019t believe she had the voice of a singer. She also wanted no part of fame, based on the behavior she had seen from her father \u2013 most specifically, his constant absence in her childhood.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think I could sing,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I grew up thinking becoming famous was about the worst thing you could do. You went on the road, you started doing drugs and got divorced and didn\u2019t see your kids and everything fell apart.\u201d\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nRosanne said it wasn\u2019t until Cash invited her to join him onstage for a duet of \u201cI Still Miss Someone\u201d that her resentment of her father turned around.\n\n\u201cHe worked out all his problems onstage, and that happened with me that night with him,\u201d she said. \u201cIt just all got fixed.\u201d\n\n\u201cCountry Music\u201d is slated to premiere on Sunday on PBS.", "description": "Rosanne Cash is shedding light on what it was like growing up with her iconic father, Johnny Cash.", "authors": ["Julius Young", "Julius Is An La Entertainment Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-88263537.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
