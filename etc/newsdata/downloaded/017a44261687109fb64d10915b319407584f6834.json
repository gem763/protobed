It\u2019s the one thing his team has been doing really well. The Browns got whistled for 13 more of them Sunday in a 27-13 loss to New England that dropped them to 2-5.\n\nCleveland leads the league in total penalties \u2014 70 of them and that\u2019s not counting 16 more that were declined. Also a league high: the minus-252 net yards, which is a whopping 102 more than the nearest contender (Minnesota). By comparison, 7-1 Green Bay is plus-248.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nSo in less than half a season, the Browns are net 500 yards down in penalties to an actual Super Bowl contender. Astounding.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not answering questions about penalties,\u201d Kitchens said Sunday.\n\nSorry, Freddie, there\u2019s more.\n\nTeams that rank 2-8 on the most penalties in 2019 list have all played eight games to Cleveland\u2019s seven. Second-ranked Atlanta has been involved in 206 more snaps and still trails by three penalties.\n\nIf the Browns set their minds to it, they can pad their lead Sunday in Denver in what may be a must-win game at the start of a must-win stretch of the season for Kitchens\u2019 employment status.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just the consistency and lack of discipline and accountability right now,\u201d quarterback Baker Mayfield said after the game.\n\nThe penalties are part of Cleveland\u2019s issues, but it goes beyond that. Sunday in Foxborough was a nationally televised tutorial in sloppy, undisciplined football.\n\nFreddie Kitchens of the Cleveland Browns looks on in the first half against the New England Patriots at Gillette Stadium. (Getty Images)\n\nThere were three turnovers on three successive snaps that gave New England a 17-0 lead that they simply never blow at home.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere were two painfully dumb challenges by Kitchens that were both easily denied that cost the Browns two timeouts.\n\nThen there was the fourth-and-11 from their own 24-yard-line with 6:17 remaining in regulation and the Browns technically in the game. First the punt team was sent out, but KhaDarel Hodge committed a false start, making it fourth-and-16 from the 19. Even though the situation was more difficult, Kitchens then decided to go for it. Mayfield was sacked.\n\nBoth CBS and the Browns radio broadcast reported that Kitchens ordered the penalty because he didn\u2019t want to burn a precious final timeout (which wouldn\u2019t have been the case without the doomed second-half challenge).\n\nWho knows? The mere fact this sounds plausible \u2014 setting up a fourth-and-16 \u2014 says it all.\n\nCleveland gained more yards per play than New England (5.3 to 4.8). It got a pass rush (Myles Garrett mostly) that got to Tom Brady (three sacks). The offensive play-calling was good.\n\nThey still lost by two touchdowns.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not shocking, that\u2019s how people usually win,\u201d Kitchens said. \u201cThey don\u2019t turn the ball over and they don\u2019t [commit] penalties. \u2026 We expect more out of ourselves. We\u2019re just not getting that right now and that needs to change.\u201d\n\nThey already had their bye week to work on fundamentals. It apparently didn\u2019t take.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t correct these mistakes we\u2019re going to be the \u2018if\u2019 team or \u2018coulda, woulda\u2019 all of those things, so [expletive] has got to get corrected,\u201d Odell Beckham Jr. said of a promising season slipping away. \u201c... Enough is enough. It\u2019s just time. There\u2019s no more time to lose any games or keep saying, \u2018We could have.\u2019 It\u2019s done.\u201d\n\nThere is no shame in losing in New England. Pretty much everyone does it. Just giving the Patriots the game, though, is another thing. Cleveland has way too much talent to just roll over from self-inflicted wounds.\n\n\u201c[New England] is a team that plays perfect,\u201d Beckham said. \u201cA team that doesn\u2019t beat themselves. A team that has few penalties.\u201d\n\nThe 8-0 Patriots rank second to last in total penalties among teams that have played eight games.\n\nLook, no one expects Kitchens to be Bill Belichick. And no one can blame the coach solely for all the flags. Three of Cleveland\u2019s four false starts came from tight ends and wide receivers.\n\nYet they aren\u2019t going to fire the players, who still bring a breathtaking amount of individual talent to the table. Kitchens may not be coaching his players to do dumb stuff but it is imperative that he finds a way to coach his players to stop doing dumb stuff.\n\nKitchens appears to be a likable guy. He doesn\u2019t take himself too seriously. He grinded his way to the top. Until 2018, he was never more than a position coach and got the job only because the Browns fired Hue Jackson midseason and later moved on from interim Gregg Williams. The team responded to Kitchens and he got the full-time job. It should be a nice story.\n\nWhen the offseason brought even more skill to the roster, Kitchens had a Ferrari on his hands.\n\nCan a first-time driver handle that? So far, no.\n\nTime has ticked far enough that everything is on the brink. Yes, the schedule softens. And yes, neither the AFC North nor an AFC wild-card spot is out of reach despite the poor start. It won\u2019t, though, happen this way.\n\n\u201cWe need to stop committing penalties, alright?\u201d Kitchens said. \u201cWe need to focus and concentrate on staying onsides, so we don\u2019t end up in first-and-20? Alright? That\u2019s how you win games.\u201d\n\nSaying it is easy. If Freddie Kitchens is going to survive, he better find a way to make it a reality.
