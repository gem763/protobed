He later dropped her off at a car wash near the shopping centre\n\nHowever, when he was asked if he would ask for the same jail time if the victim had been his own child during an interview with Sunrise on Tuesday, he was unable to give a proper answer and fumbled through a response.\n\n'As a father myself, I'm a father of a young seven-year-old daughter as well, it's quite a difficult question and one that I've been asked many times.\n\n'Ultimately my job is to make sure Sterling has a fair sentence, that all the facts are before the court.\n\n'Six-to-nine years is what we estimate the offending on the relevant cases in the legislation that is currently before the courts as well. That is still something that needs to play out in his sentence today.'\n\nThe girl, seven, had been shopping with her mother when she wandered into a different aisle of the toy section (pictured). Free had been watching the girl and took his opportunity to abduct her\n\nSterling Mervyn Free (pictured) has been remanded in custody, he will appear in court for sentencing in October\n\nHe said he had to be mindful not to put his personal views forward and ensure he was acting in his clients best interest.\n\nThe Crown has asked for an eight to ten year sentence.\n\nHowever, Free's defence team has asked for eight years, telling the court there was genuine remorse from their client.\n\nBarrister Angus Edwards said Free cried once he realised what he had done.\n\nThe victim's mother, who was in court during the hearing, shook her head in response.\n\nThe father-of-two drove with the girl to remote bushland more than half-an-hour away and assaulted her. Free was then captured on CCTV dropping her back at Kmart\n\nEarlier in the day, chilling CCTV footage showed Free luring the girl away from her mother, who was shopping for Christmas presents.\n\nThe girl's desperate mother called store staff to help find her.\n\nAfter frantically searching for 30 minutes - by which time the girl was 30km away - Westfield security phoned police.\n\nAbout 90minutes after she went missing Free dropped the girl at a car wash near the shopping centre.\n\nThe girl's mother found a scratch on her back and a Facebook post was circulated in search of the kidnapper.\n\nFree was arrested at his home two days later.\n\nFree pleaded guilty in the Brisbane District Court in July to taking a child under 12 for immoral purposes, deprivation of liberty and indecent treatment.\n\nPrior to his arrest Free had worked at a local Fantastic Furniture store.\n\nJudge Julie Dick will decide her sentence on Friday.", "description": "A sentencing hearing for Sterling Free, 27, is underway in the Brisbane District Court this week after he pleaded guilty to abducting the girl from Kmart at Westfield North Lakes in Brisbane.", "authors": ["Charlie Moore", "Kelsey Wilkie For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/07/17/03/16143108-0-image-a-46_1563329599984.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
