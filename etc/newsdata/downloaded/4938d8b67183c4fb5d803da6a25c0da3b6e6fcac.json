Photo: REUTERS/Simon Dawson\n\nDeutsche Bank (DBK.DE) CEO Christian Sewing on Wednesday reassured investors that the banks sweeping overhaul remains on track, as the bank delivered third quarter results.\n\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s revenue in the third quarter was \u20ac5.3bn and it made a pre-tax loss of \u20ac687m. Loss attributable to shareholders was \u20ac832m. Return on tangible equity, a key measure of bank performance, was negative 7.3%.\n\nThe quarterly figures represent the first full quarter since Deutsche Bank announced a radical restructure of the bank in July aimed at returning the profit to consistent growth and profit. The plan involves shutting Deutsche Bank\u2019s stock trading business and cutting 18,000 jobs globally. CFO James von Moltke said on Wednesday that around 1,500 jobs were cut in the third quarter.\n\nSewing highlighted better underlying performance at much of the bank once the cost of its turnaround plan is stripped out.\n\n\u201cDespite having launched the most comprehensive restructuring of our bank in two decades, we delivered profits in our four core businesses during the quarter and grew loans and assets under management,\u201d Sewing said.\n\n\u201cTransformation is fully underway with tangible progress on costs and de-risking.\u201d\n\nHowever, analysts flagged concerns over declining revenues and weak bond trading. Revenue was down 15% on the \u20ac6.1bn Deutsche Bank took in during the third quarter of 2018.\n\n\u201cThe decline in revenues can\u2019t be masked,\u201d Neil Wilson, chief markets analyst at Markets.com, said. \u201cBond trading is about all it has left in investment banking and the fixed income division posted a 13% drop in revenues.\u201d\n\nShares in Deutsche Bank dropped 3.1% in Frankfurt.\n\nAnalysts had no consensus forecast for Deutsche Bank\u2019s third quarter performance given the ongoing restructure. However, the results were broadly in line with what analysts at UBS had forecast. Analysts at the Swiss bank had forecast revenue of \u20ac5.4bn and a pre-tax loss of \u20ac1.1bn on restructuring charges.\n\nDeutsche Bank booked \u20ac186m in transformation charges in the three-month quarter and said restructuring costs for the year will reach \u20ac1bn. Deutsche Bank made a huge \u20ac3.1bn loss in the second quarter of 2019 as a result of the costly transformation plan.\n\n\u201cI want to thank our employees for their strong performance and commitment during this period of change, and our clients for the strong vote of confidence in our new strategy,\u201d Sewing said.", "description": "Deutsche Bank made a net loss of \u20ac832m in the third quarter as the cost of its sweeping overhaul plan hit the profit and loss account.", "authors": ["Oscar Williams-Grut", "Senior City Correspondent", "Yahoo Finance Uk"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ir1icq7hB35zN9f_FpCcag--~B/aD0yOTI5O3c9NDc1NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-07/3a903cb0-a18e-11e9-9e77-ec8b71fbdfc9", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
