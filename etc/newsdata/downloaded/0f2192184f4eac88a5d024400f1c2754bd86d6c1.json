This compares to earnings of $0.05 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 52.94%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this data-management software company would post a loss of $0.32 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.30, delivering a surprise of 6.25%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.\n\nVaronis, which belongs to the Zacks Security industry, posted revenues of $65.65 million for the quarter ended September 2019, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.70%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $67.05 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nVaronis shares have added about 18.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 20.6%.\n\nWhat's Next for Varonis?\n\nWhile Varonis has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Varonis was unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future.

The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.10 on $79.19 million in revenues for the coming quarter and -$0.91 on $256.88 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.
