REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo\n\nWray, addressing a crowd of law enforcement and child protection officials at the Department of Justice in Washington, said that Facebook\u2019s (FB.O) plan would produce \u201ca lawless space created not by the American people or their representatives but by the owners of one big company.\u201d\n\nFacebook intends to add encryption of wide swathes of communications on its platform.\n\nHis speech, which came ahead of an address on the same topic by Attorney General William Barr, ratchets up the pressure on Facebook as the U.S. and allied governments renew their push to weaken the digital protections around the messages billions of people exchange each day.\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s No. 2 official estimated that tips to law enforcement about possible child exploitation could drop by as much as 70 percent if Facebook encrypts its messaging program.\n\nFacebook reported 16 million child-exploitation tips last year, Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen said. By contrast, Apple, which already uses end-to-end encryption on its messenger, reported 43 tips last year.\n\n\u201cAre we to assume that Apple (AAPL.O) magically ran platforms free of child exploitation?\u201d Rosen asked. \u201cOr is it that companies with end-to-end encryption cannot see harmful illicit activity that was occurring on these platforms and they choose to avert their eyes by deploying end-to-end encryption?\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department event is part of a renewed push by the American, Australian, and British governments to force tech companies to help them circumvent the encryption that helps keeps digital communications secure.\n\nDebates over encryption have been rumbling for more than 25 years, but officials\u2019 anxiety has increased as major tech companies move toward automatically encrypting the messages on their platforms and the data held on their phones.\n\nIn the past, officials have cited the threat of terrorism to buttress their campaigns again encryption. But as the Islamic State and other extremist groups fade from the headlines, governments are trying a different tack, invoking the threat of child abuse to argue for \u201clawful access\u201d to these devices.\n\nFacebook\u2019s privacy-focused move, announced by founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg this year, is causing particular consternation because the platform is the source of millions of tips to authorities about child abuse images every year.\n\nZuckerberg, speaking on the company\u2019s weekly internal Q&A livestream, defended the decision, saying he was \u201coptimistic\u201d Facebook would be able to identify predators even in encrypted systems using the same tools it used to fight election interference.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to lose the ability to find those kids who need to be rescued,\u201d Wray said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to lose the ability to find the bad guys.\u201d\n\nMany people have applauded Facebook\u2019s push for privacy and security. Academics, experts, and privacy groups have long worried that circumventing the protections around private communications would open dangerous vulnerabilities that could make the entire internet less safe, and leave billions of users exposed to abusive surveillance.\n\nWray steered clear of making any specific proposal, saying that \u201ccompanies themselves are best placed\u201d to offer a way for law enforcement to get around encryption.", "description": "FBI Director Christopher Wray said Friday that Facebook's proposal to encrypt its popular messaging program would turn the platform into a \"dream come true for predators and child pornographers.\"", "authors": ["Raphael Satter", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1437052170&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9312Z", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
