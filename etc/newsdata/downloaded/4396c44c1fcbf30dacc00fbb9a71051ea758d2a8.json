In politer terms, Grant told Johnson that he would not mess with his children\u2019s future, nor destroy the freedoms that his grandfather fought two world wars to defend.\n\nWhile the prime minister stated that he wanted to reduce the cost of living, Michael Gove said that food prices may go up in the event of a no-deal Brexit. They don\u2019t seem to be able to agree on this issue, or consistently on some other issues. Although Gove supported Johnson\u2019s decision to close the Commons for more than a month, less than three months ago he spoke out against the idea.\n\nRegardless, from a Liberal Democrat Remain perspective, no-deal Brexit will have massive implications for people of all income levels, but will be most detrimental to families who are already struggling. As a councillor, I refer residents to food banks all the time, so the impact of prices increasing will be unthinkable for these families and will place enormous pressure on welfare services.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nEven in Islington, the former home of the PM, which has a reputation for being affluent, over a third of people are living in poverty with children also disproportionately affected. Although it is a trendy, liberal borough, no one is immune to the impact of rising prices.\n\nOne of my east London constituents, a single parent, buys her children\u2019s clothes from a charity shop, but goes to great lengths to hide this from them. She buys 5p carrier bags from high street stores and asks for hangers to enable her to make charity shop-bought clothes look as though they are new, not least because she wants to protect her children from any potential bullying for wearing second-hand clothes.\n\nShe is just one of many people attempting to hold onto dignity in this Brexit crisis by saving money in other areas so that she can afford to feed her family.\n\nBut rising prices won\u2019t only impact the physical wellbeing of poorer families, it\u2019ll also affect their mental health, putting further strain on the NHS and other support services.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It follows that a reduction in quantity, availability and choice will push up prices.\n\nIn addition, a no-deal Brexit could cause the pound to drop to an all-time low, according to the Bank of England, which would push up the price of imported goods, including food. Academics from the Universities of Warwick and Bristol predict significant price rises, with the average weekly grocery shop rising from \u00a358 to \u00a371.\n\nPoliticians need to get their priorities right.\n\nWhile they spend most of their time bickering over Brexit, it is now more than two years since the Grenfell tragedy, and families are still waiting for justice. Displaced families are still living in very poor housing and have not received health screenings to determine any health effects as a result of the fire. To add insult to injury, rising food prices will add to the trauma of these families who are struggling to keep going, many of whom have been forced to use food banks. Sadly, there have already been several deaths by suicide and suicide attempts in the aftermath of the tragic event.\n\nIrrespective of where you live and whether or not you voted to leave or remain in the EU, one thing is certain; any increase in food prices will affect everyone. Approximately 30 per cent of all food consumed in the UK is imported from the EU, meaning that a no-deal Brexit would force the UK to impose average food import tariffs of 22 per cent.\n\nInstead of spending time and money on no-deal Brexit propaganda, proroguing parliament and stifling democracy, the government should remember how so many people in Britain today, across different income levels, are struggling with the fear of a no-deal Brexit and its financial implications for them and their loved ones.\n\nAs Tennessee Williams once wrote: \u201cLife is an unanswered question, but let\u2019s still believe in the dignity and importance of the question.\u201d\n\nWell, Brexit is an unanswered question. And many are desperately clutching onto their dignity as politicians debate its importance, without regard for their wellbeing.\n\nWe can take hope from the fact that there are affluent people who are standing up for those who are struggling and setting an example for which our government can learn, but it\u2019ll take a lot more to prevent the inevitable should Johnson\u2019s government get its way.\n\nRabina Khan is a Liberal Democrat councillor for Shadwell in Tower Hamlets", "description": "In an expletive-laden Twitter rant last week, actor Hugh Grant condemned Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament this month.
