His team scored 10 runs in the first inning en route to a 13-1 pounding of the Braves. Even eight more innings hadn\u2019t calmed Shildt down, because holy F-bomb, his victory speech was something else. It might be St. Louis\u2019 version of New York Yankees manager Aaron Boone\u2019s \u201cSavages in the Box\u201d rant that became a rallying call for his team.\n\nHere\u2019s the text version, if it\u2019s easier or for when the video is inevitably scrubbed from the internet:\n\n\u201cThe [Braves] started some s\u2014-. We finished the s\u2014-. And that\u2019s how we roll. No one f\u2014\u2014 with us ever. Now, I don\u2019t give a f\u2014- who we play. We\u2019re gonna f\u2014- them up. We\u2019re gonna take it right to them the whole f\u2014-ing way. We\u2019re gonna kick their f\u2014-ng a\u2014.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nWe don\u2019t usually see this sort of thing because managers don\u2019t do this when the media is around. But Cardinals outfielder Randy Arozarena must have not learned from Antonio Brown\u2019s mistake because he put the postgame speech on Instagram Live for the whole world to see. The rookie apologized not long after the video started to circulate. A rookie mistake indeed.\n\nHere\u2019s a statement that Randy Arozarena posted on Instagram, in his original Spanish and with the app\u2019s English translation. #stlcards pic.twitter.com/JFovlcWmTg \u2014 Jeff Jones (@jmjones) October 10, 2019\n\nArozarena will probably get in some trouble for breaking the sacred \u201cWhat happens in the clubhouse, stays in the clubhouse rule,\u201d but it\u2019s still an entertaining look at what happens after a team wins a do-or-die playoff game like the Cardinals did.\n\nAnd now we know that even the Cardinals \u2014 one of the more respect-the-game organizations out there \u2014 can sound like Tupac every now and again.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMike Oz is a writer for Yahoo Sports.
