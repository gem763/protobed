As far as I'm concerned, it's better than shouting at the television set,\" he told the Guardian.\n\nA pilot for the resurrected show has already been filmed, Mr Law added.\n\nThe pilot will also feature the Duchess of Sussex wearing a glittery top with the word \"Princess\" printed on the front.\n\nImage copyright Avalon Image caption Meghan and Prince Harry also receive the caustic puppetry treatment\n\nUnlike its 1980s heyday, Mr Law said the new series would not focus on the lower ranks of British politics, explaining: \"It's an awful lot of trouble to go to, and you want it to be effective.\"\n\nHe told the paper the show's producers are in talks with US-based networks about bringing the show to a wider global audience.\n\nThe caricaturist first told BBC Two's Front Row on Friday that he planned to bring the show back.\n\nMr Law told the cultural discussion show's host, Mary Beard, anybody in the public eye would be \"fair game\" for the Spitting Image satirical treatment.\n\nHe admitted to the Guardian satirising President Trump offered a challenge \"because he's a satire in himself\", but said puppets allowed them to go further than actors could.\n\nImpressionist Luke Kempner confirmed his involvement in the show, writing on Twitter: \"This is my latest project I've been working on!! So exciting and a true honour!! Watch this space!\"\n\nCaricaturist Adrian Teal said he has been working on the show's puppet designs to bring the \"TV satire juggernaut\" back to screens, tweeting: \"Well, it's official!\"\n\nBroadcast on ITV from 1984 to 1996, the often-controversial programme parodied political leaders, celebrities and royals across 18 series.\n\nAfter the topical show ended, Mr Law worked as a fine artist and in 2018 donated his entire Spitting Image collection to Cambridge University.\n\nThe archive, which is held in the university's library, includes original scripts, puppet moulds, drawings and recordings.\n\nImage copyright Avalon Image caption US rapper Kanye West and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg are among the current crop of famous faces to get their own puppets\n\nThe anarchic show that packed a punch - and 15 million viewers\n\nSpitting Image was created by caricaturists Peter Fluck, Roger Law and Martin Lambie-Nairn\n\nAt its height it pulled in an audience of 15 million viewers\n\nIt was nominated for nine BAFTA Television Awards (winning two) and four Emmys\n\nMuch of Margaret Thatcher's Cabinet was parodied, with Douglas Hurd depicted with \"Mr Whippy ice cream\" hair, and her successor John Major caricatured as a dull, grey puppet with a penchant for peas", "description": "The satirical puppet show plans to target global figures such as Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/12F85/production/_109010777_sitrumpputincollage.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
