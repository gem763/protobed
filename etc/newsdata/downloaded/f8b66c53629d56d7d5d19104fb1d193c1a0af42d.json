This includes the automatic conversion of database objects such as SQL, Stored Procedures, workflow and orchestration logic (ETL), DDL, and other code types, from technologies such as Teradata and Netezza.\n\n\u201cSHIFTTM was specifically designed to accelerate the migration from legacy data warehouses to the cloud,\u201d said Chetan Mathur, Chief Executive Officer at Next Pathway. \u201cThe migration of complex legacy code is proving to be the greatest bottleneck in any cloud migration project, and with SHIFTTM,we\u2019ve helped our customers greatly accelerate their migration while reducing their end-to-end project costs.\u201d\n\nTraditionally, the path to decommission legacy data warehouses involved lengthy manual development and testing efforts to rewrite and refactor code that has been built over decades \u2013 a process that takes months or years to complete. Through the use of SHIFTTM, customers can automatically convert the most important (or the most complicated) workloads in hours, greatly reducing migration costs.\n\n\u201cNext Pathway will provide Snowflake customers with a fast, efficient and cost-effective path for migrating data to our cloud-built data warehouse,\u201d Snowflake CEO, Frank Slootman said. \u201cBy automating the migration effort, customers can refocus their time on understanding and leveraging the data to drive their business forward.\u201d\n\nSnowflake will incorporate SHIFTTM into their technology offerings under the banner, \u2018SnowPATH Powered by Next Pathway\u2019, effective immediately.\n\nAbout Snowflake Inc.\n\nSnowflake is the only data warehouse built for the cloud, enabling the data-driven enterprise with instant elasticity, secure data sharing and per-second pricing, across multiple clouds.
