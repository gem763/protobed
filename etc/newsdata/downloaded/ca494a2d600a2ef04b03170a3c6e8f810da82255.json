The fire was ruled arson after investigators determined it was started with gasoline.\n\nOn Thursday, Carlos Montalvo-Rivera, 52, was charged with arson and murder in the death of his wife, police said. He was also charged with trying to kill their young children, ages 13, 9 and 8, each of whom survived the fire.\n\nMontalvo-Rivera was being held without bail.\n\n\u201cEvery time we reviewed this case, every time we looked at the evidence, the finger of guilt pointed back at one person,\u201d Lancaster County District Attorney Craig Stedman said, according to Fox 43 York.\n\nMOM OF CHILDREN FOUND HANGING TOLD 911 DISPATCHER SON WAS BULLIED, 'DIDN'T WANT TO GO ALONE'\n\nMontalvo-River told police he and his wife were happily married and denied having any marital problems, the station reported.\n\nBut Sanchez\u2019s sister Dolores Ojedo told detectives the marriage was on the rocks.\n\n\u201cI will kill you like a dog,\u201d she quoted Montalvo-River as telling her sister a year before she was killed, according to the station.\n\nPHILADELPHIA WOMAN ARRESTED IN CONNECTION WITH DEATHS OF 2 DAUGHTERS AND THEIR DAD: POLICE\n\nPolice said Montalvo-Rivera\u2019s account of what happened was riddled with inconsistencies, beginning with his claim that intruders set the fire after breaking into the house and knocking him unconscious for 45 minutes.\n\nA neurologist told investigators last month that based on medical records, Montalvo-Rivera\u2019s version of what happened was \u201chighly unlikely.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe medical science is not backing up what the defendant is claiming that he had been knocked out for 45 minutes, which is an excessively long time for a significant head injury,\" Stedman said, according to the station.\n\nA neighbor also refuted Montalvo-Rivera\u2019s account that he escaped the fire with his hands tied behind his back.\n\nThe neighbor said that after he reported the fire, he saw Montalvo-Rivera with his hands untied trying to climb into a second-floor window and then tried unsuccessfully to help him.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "Pennsylvania\u00a0authorities conducted a nine-year investigation before arresting a man in the murder of his wife.", "authors": ["Robert Gearty"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/03/iStock-Police-Tape.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
