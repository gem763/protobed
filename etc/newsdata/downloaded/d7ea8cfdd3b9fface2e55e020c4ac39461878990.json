It extended existing federal authority to limit pollution in large bodies of water, like the Chesapeake Bay and Puget Sound, to smaller bodies that drain into them, such as tributaries, streams and wetlands.\n\nUnder the rule, farmers using land near streams and wetlands were restricted from doing certain kinds of plowing and from planting certain crops, and would have been required to obtain E.P.A. permits in order to use chemical pesticides and fertilizers that could have run off into those bodies of water. Those restrictions will now be lifted.\n\n[Want climate news in your inbox?

It is expected that the new rule, still being developed, will retain federal protections for larger bodies of water, the rivers that drain into them and wetlands that are directly adjacent to those bodies of water.\n\nBut it will quite likely strip away protections of so-called ephemeral streams, in which water runs only during or after rainfalls, and of wetlands that are not adjacent to major bodies of water or connected to such bodies of water by a surface channel of water. Those changes would represent a victory for farmers and rural landowners who lobbied the Trump administration aggressively to make them.", "description": "The administration is expected to complete the  repeal of a major Obama-era regulation that  put limits on  chemicals that could be used near streams, wetlands and water bodies.", "authors": ["Coral Davenport", "Lisa Friedman"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/12/us/12cli-water/12cli-water-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
