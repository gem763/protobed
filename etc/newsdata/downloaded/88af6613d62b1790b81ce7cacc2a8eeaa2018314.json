In fact, Federal Trade Commission reports show a significant spike in credit card fraud from the first quarter to the second quarter this year, with about 110,000 reports.\n\nFraud, scams and data leaks are all on the rise. Not surprisingly, 2019 is on track to be the worst year yet for your privacy, online and otherwise. What do you need to watch out for? Click or tap here for 6 of the biggest scams fooling even the savviest internet users right now.\n\nHow can you stay safe in a digital world with hackers lurking around every corner? It starts with strong passwords to protect your accounts, and creating effective ones is about more than tossing in a capital letter and a number. Click or tap here for 5 rules you need to follow every time you create a new password.\n\nKeeping your finances safe also requires diligence. Here's what you need to know about five threats facing you and your card accounts. Let\u2019s start with those sneak credit card skimmers, because they can be hard to spot.\n\n1. Sneaky skimmers\n\nCredit card skimmers sit directly on top of ordinary credit card slots and are designed to not interfere with their normal function. You can use what seems like a normal card reader and never know your data is being swiped by a scammer.\n\nThe most common locations for credit card skimmers are gas pumps and ATMs. After hours, they're often left unmonitored, which makes it easy for criminals to install and attach a skimmer.\n\nSo how can you spot them? \"Off-colored\" plastic, irregular lights or awkwardly shaped readers can be a red flag, but many skimmers are so small and covert they're tricky to spot. There are a number of different styles, all with their own tells, and I can help you identify them. Click or tap to see what money-stealing card skimmers look like.\n\nHow can you avoid these devious devices? Paying a cashier at the gas station is a great way to stay clear of skimmers at a high-risk location. When choosing an ATM, try to stick to machines attached to your bank instead of generic units and fine those locked behind doors at night.\n\n2. Malicious merchants\n\nPaying a cashier directly doesn't rule out the dangers of merchant or point-of-sale fraud. Credit card skimmers or skimming software can easily be hooked up to a register, and reports of sketchy stores doing this are not uncommon.\n\nOne of the strongest options to fight retail fraud might be in your wallet right now: the EVP chip on your credit or debit card. Not every card uses a chip, but those that do are much harder to extract data from. Most skimmers scan the magnetic strip to extract your data, so your chip card can't be copied in the same way.\n\nYou could also just opt to use cash over a card, but make sure to carry only a little more than you need. Having lots of loose bills on your person makes you more vulnerable to robberies and theft.\n\nDon't get taken advantage of. Your private information is for your eyes only.

Horrible hacks at popular places\n\nEstablishments like fast food restaurants are becoming higher priority targets for hackers due to the sheer volume of money that passes through their doors each day.\n\nCarrying cash is the safest method to avoid fraud, but another strategy is to use your credit card when you're eating out or shopping instead of your debit card. Credit card limits can put a cap on how much a thief can steal at once. If a thief has access to your bank account, it's possible for them to take you all the way to zero.\n\nRELATED: Scammers aren\u2019t the only ones with clever hacks.

Tap or click for 10 essential digital life hacks you\u2019ll wish you knew sooner.\n\nStrong consumer protection laws for fraudulent credit card charges mean you'd be on the hook for $50, at most. The laws against debit card theft, though, aren't as powerful. You can challenge transactions made with your stolen card, but be prepared to wait to get your money back. And you don't alert you bank in time, you may take the entire loss on the nose.\n\nThieves will do whatever it takes to get your information but you don't have to be a victim. Don't sit by passively and let them steal your info. Fight back and shop smart.\n\n4. Fear the free Wi-Fi\n\nEveryone needs to use the internet when traveling, and hotel or coffee shop Wi-Fi is usually the default choice. When the Wi-Fi is free, that's even better, right? Well, not so much.\n\nAs we've discussed before, free Wi-Fi has a host of its own security issues. It's easy for network owners to monitor your activity, and even easier for outsiders and hackers to target the computer you use on the network. This goes double if you use free public Wi-Fi to shop or make purchases. Our advice? Wait to shop or bank until you're on a secure network.\n\nIf you can't wait, you mask your network activity with a VPN to hide your identity, protect your devices through encryption and keep hackers out. Click or tap for an in-depth guide on how VPNs work and how to set one up on a Windows PC or Mac.\n\n5. Evil emails infiltrating your inbox\n\nWe can't cover scams or hacks without talking about phishing \u2014 the most annoying and prolific cybercrime on the web. It's so popular because it's easy to do and requires the victim to \"let the hacker in\" on their own merits. It's a classic bait-and-switch for credit card and identity info.\n\nMost commonly, phishing schemes are found in your email inbox or on a social media platform like Facebook Messenger. Sometimes, the messages look like official government forms or corporate communications. One thing they all have in common? They link to another website to trick you into entering personal information.\n\nRegardless of what the message or website claims, never enter any personal info online unless you're certain the website is legitimate. You can usually tell by glancing at the address bar. If the url is long, complicated and doesn't contain a familiar \".com\" you know and love, it might be a fake.\n\nAnd remember, be wary when opening an email or message from anyone you don't know, and never follow suspicious external links or download unknown files. A sharp eye and natural skepticism is the best way to stay safe \u2014 both on and offline. Your wallet will thank you.\n\nBONUS: 8 ways you\u2019re ruining your Windows computer\n\nWe all use computers in one capacity or another, but that doesn't mean we're all adept at taking care of them. There are things we do time and time again that make it difficult to keep our machines in tip-top shape \u2014 like not running virus protection software or leaving tons of tabs open online so your performance is eventually dragged down.\n\nThere are a number of things you may be doing right now to ensure you're fast-tracking your way to certain doom, in terms of your computer, anyway.
