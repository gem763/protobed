But despite those numbers, as the New York Times reports, the Food and Drug Administration is calling on researchers to include more male patients in clinical trials of breast cancer treatments.\n\nBecause most breast cancer patients are women, there is often little to no data about whether various treatments are effective in men. As the Times notes, some drugs are approved only for female patients.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so frustrating in clinic to see patients and say, \u2018Well, we don\u2019t really know \u2014 the drugs have been tested in women. We think it should work in men, but there\u2019s no real evidence to back that up,'\u201d Dr. Sharon Giordano, a professor of breast medical oncology at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, told the publication.\n\nSome researchers have also called for a large, international trial specifically focused on men with breast cancer to pool resources and gather as much data as possible. However, securing funding for such a trial has proven difficult. \u201cNo one wants to invest in a disease that is only one percent of all breast cancers,\u201d Dr. Fatima Cardoso, the director of the breast unit at Champalimaud Clinical Center in Lisbon, said.\n\nUltimately, awareness is key when it comes to early detection of breast cancer in men \u2014 and according to Cardoso, there\u2019s plenty of room for improvement.\n\n\u201cSome men are not even aware they have breasts and not aware they can have breast cancer,\u201d she said. \u201cEven health professionals often don\u2019t think about it. General practitioners who see male patients don\u2019t pay attention to the breast.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: RealClearLife, a news and lifestyle publisher, is now a part of InsideHook.
