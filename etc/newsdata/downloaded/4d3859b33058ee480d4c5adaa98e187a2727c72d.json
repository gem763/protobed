A spokesman for China\u2019s foreign ministry said that if the legislation were to become law \u201cit wouldn\u2019t only harm China\u2019s interest in China-U. S. relations, but would also seriously damage U.S. interests\u201d and that China \u201cwill definitely take strong countermeasures in response to the wrong decisions by the U.S. side to defend its sovereignty, security and development interests.\u201d\n\nSee: China vows \u2018strong countermeasures\u2019 in wake of U.S. bill supporting Hong Kong protesters\n\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s possible this bill will push China into a public show of defiance against U.S. \u2018interference,\u2019\u201d which could mean a crackdown on Hong Kong protesters, said Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, in a note.\n\n\u201cUnder that scenario, markets would be relieved if China\u2019s retaliation kept the trade pact intact. However, higher political uncertainty in Hong Kong would be a sizable downside risk,\u201d Lawler said.\n\nIn economic data, a report on U.S. September retail sales missed expectations, falling for the first time in seven months.

AA, +0.00% and railroad CSX Corp. CSX, -0.18%.\n\nShares of United Airlines Holdings Inc. UAL, +0.61% were expected to be in play after third-quarter profit reported after Tuesday\u2019s close topped expectations and the company raised guidance for the year.\n\nShares of MGM Resorts International MGM, -0.18% may be in focus after it announced late Tuesday that it would sell its Circus Circus casino resort in Las Vegas and a huge interest in its Bellagio resort.\n\nThree major drug distributors are in talks to pay $18 billion to settle litigation brought by state and local governments blaming them for fueling the opioid crisis, The Wall Street Journal reported, potentially offering a resolution to lawsuits that have shaken the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nThat report said that three distributors \u2014 McKesson Corp.
