Once, rounding the Horn, on a Celebrity Cruises ship on a voyage from Buenos Aires to Valparaiso in Chile, and again crossing the Drake Passage returning from Antarctica.\n\nBoth times I longed to step ashore on the rocky headland and take the steep path up to the albatross sculpture (a monument to the thousands who have perished in this treacherous sea) that I could see through my binoculars.\n\nSo, my dream cruise would be to join one of the two Australis expedition ships that land passengers at Cape Horn from Zodiac boats and also explore the channels and fjords of Tierra del Fuego, such as Beagle Channel. Going ashore to see Wulaia Bay, where Charles Darwin landed from the Beagle in 1833, has enormous appeal to me.\n\nThe North Pole - Douglas Ward, author\n\nThe Fifty Years of Victory nuclear-powered icebreaker makes its way through frozen waters in the Kara Sea\n\nTo celebrate my 50th year in the cruise industry in 2016, I sailed to the North Pole on Fifty Years of Victory, the Russian nuclear-powered icebreaker that goes five years without refuelling. You join the ship in Murmansk and embark on the voyage of a lifetime.\n\nWe saw polar bear families up close before, with much icecrushing, we arrived at the top of the world. All 130 passengers decanted to an ice floe for a barbecue, led by a team of four Russian national park rangers who gave presentations in English. Zodiac boat landings are also made at Franz Joseph Land.\n\nDid I enjoy it? It was the best 12 days of my life.\n\nJapan - Emma Le Teace, blogger\n\nA woman with traditional kimono dress and umbrella walking Kyoto\u2019s Arashiyama bamboo grove, Japan\n\nLast year I took a cruise with Princess Cruises from Singapore to Tokyo that included two Japanese ports, but it was not enough. I enjoyed everything about the experience and would love to see more of Japan, such as Kyoto\u2019s Arashiyama bamboo grove.\n\nI was introduced to cruising at the age of 11 on a family voyage to Alaska. Since then I have sailed around much of Europe and America but have never been anywhere as fascinating as Japan. Even a trip to buy a drink is an experience.\n\nWe visited temples, shrines and gardens, giving us an opportunity to learn a little about the culture and history. There is so much to see and do that.\n\nTahiti - Dave Monk, cruise writer\n\nOn the French Polynesian island of Tahiti, Paul Gauguin Cruises offers guests the chance to swim in lagoons\n\nI\u2019ve been on more than 60 cruises \u2013 from voyages on 12-person barges to one on the biggest ship in the world. But the place I dream of visiting? It has to be the French Polynesian island of Tahiti.\n\nThere, Paul Gauguin Cruises operates a ship called Paul Gauguin that sails into small ports and to private islands. I\u2019m not normally a beach person but the thought of swimming in azure lagoons, relaxing in shoreside infinity pools and exploring the depths on an underwater scooter, is my dream come true.\n\nAll the way around Australia - Vicky Mayer, Editor, World of Cruising\n\nOne writer dreams of taking a cruise around Australia, visiting Sydney, the Barrier Reef and Tasmania. Pictured above is Tasmania's Russell Falls in Mount Field National Park\n\nI lived in Australia in the 1990s and still have a soft spot for this amazing country \u2013 and what better way to see it than on a ship?\n\nI\u2019m dreaming of a sundrenched cabin on board Coral Adventurer. On a 60-day circumnavigation voyage, the ship will visit 35 destinations around Australia in November and December 2020, culminating with a trip to Uluru on Christmas Day to dine under the stars.\n\nCoral Expeditions is a small, proudly Aussie line that prides itself on offering adventure cruises around the Southern Hemisphere, so they\u2019re experts in the region, with chatty staff on board to help you make the most of your time Down Under. Sightseeing in Sydney, dining on oysters in Tasmania and snorkelling on the Barrier Reef \u2013 if I win the lottery, you\u2019ll find me in the best cabin on this cruise of a lifetime.\n\nSea of Cortez - Julie Peasgood, contributing editor, Cruise International\n\nThe Sea of Cortez is known as Mexico's own version of the Galapagos, with whales, pelicans and sea turtles all roaming it\n\nI was once told: \u2018If you want to see whales, you should go to the Sea of Cortez.\u2019 Also known as the Gulf of California, the Sea of Cortez is a slice of marine paradise dividing mainland Mexico and the Baja California peninsula.\n\nDubbed by Jacques Cousteau \u2018the world\u2019s aquarium\u2019, it is home to a variety of whales \u2013 pilot, fin, orca, humpback, grey, Peruvian beaked and mammoth blue. It also happens to be Mexico\u2019s own version of the species-rich Galapagos, with pelicans, boobies and sea turtles among the wildlife to marvel at. One day I will go there..\n\nGreenland - Andy Harmer, Director of Cruise Lines International Association\n\nThe natural beauty of Greenland, with its stunning scenery and varied wildlife, is the perfect place to unwind\n\nI have cruised to some of the most exciting cities on the planet, such as Sydney, Istanbul, Hong Kong and Athens. As someone who likes to explore ports by foot, there have been some great places to soak up the atmosphere, enjoy the culture, food and history, and to wonder at the diversity of different countries.\n\nBut I am most in awe of the chance to explore some of the world\u2019s areas of natural beauty, from the magnificence of Alaska and the Norwegian fjords to the breathtaking Croatian coast and varied islands of Greece.\n\nSo my ultimate voyage would be the Arctic, the wilderness area that includes Greenland, Iceland and Svalbard. It appeals to my joy of discovering new places, to take time to relax and unwind surrounded by stunning scenery, and to get close to some of the planet\u2019s most varied wildlife, such as whales and polar bears.\n\nIt would be the ultimate combination of landscapes, new cultures and Mother Nature.", "description": "A 60-day voyage around Australia, visiting 35 destinations including Sydney and Tasmania features, as does a cruise in the Arctic, a trip to Tahiti and a sailing holiday to the Sea of Cortez in Mexico.", "authors": ["Dave Monk For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/12/13/18393428-0-image-a-100_1568290890804.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
