Adrian Peterson rushed for a season-high 118 yards in the 17-16 victory.\n\nOne week doesn\u2019t change an entire team, but some of the specific details emphasized last week played a huge part in Washington\u2019s first victory of the season.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOur theme here is that our practice preparation really just shows up in game-day reality,\u201d Callahan said. \u201cThose clips that we take from practice carry over.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the Redskins have suddenly turned the corner, and the 5-0 San Francisco 49ers undoubtedly will provide a stiffer test than the winless Dolphins. But the things that were preached in Callahan\u2019s first week \u2014 attention to detail, running the ball, complementary football, physicality \u2014 were all on display Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a young team, you go through the down, but it\u2019s how you react to them,\u201d defensive tackle Tim Settle said. \u201cThe season can flip at any time. You\u2019ve just got to stay in it. \u2026 Still play with an edge. You don\u2019t know how things will pan out. It\u2019s a long season, people deal with a lot of adversity. I feel like we can get something going, take away the penalties and just play football. Us playing football with no penalties, we can execute and play with that poise. It\u2019s just the little things.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe minimizing of the penalties, development of the run game and improvement of the defense all seemed to go hand-in-hand. Too often this season, offensive-line penalties put the team in unfavorable down-and-distance situations that often resulted in punts after short possessions. That put pressure on the defense, which would tire late in games as the team\u2019s time of possession ranks No. 31 in the league.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe goal going in was to manage the game in a different manner where we could stay more manageable\u201d on third downs, Callahan said. \u201cThat was a focus and that was our intention going into the game. A little bit of a different mind-shift philosophically.\u201d\n\nRedskins linebacker Jon Bostic actually felt some sympathy for the Dolphins, who couldn\u2019t get off the field when Washington was backed up against its own goal line with 4:41 remaining.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI was telling guys on the sideline, \u2018Crazy thing is, we know their pain right now,\u2019\u201d Bostic said. \u201cTrying to get off the field. Trying to make a play. Trying to get the ball back to your offense. \u2026 Going forward, we\u2019ve got to keep that up. Keep the physicality up. Stay staying after the run game. We\u2019ve got to play complementary football.\u201d\n\nCallahan explained that the penalties were a major focus this week, and the team studies each officiating crew to pick up their tendencies. That gives players an awareness of what the officials are looking for and what they rarely call. The Miami victory was the first game this season the Redskins did not have an offensive penalty.\n\nAD\n\nThe offense was nowhere near perfect with six three-and-outs and seven punts, but this was a team built to win with defense and a strong running game, and that played out Sunday.\n\nAD\n\nRunning back Chris Thompson suffered a foot injury against the Dolphins and had an MRI on Monday. Callahan said they were awaiting the results.\n\nSafety Deshazor Everett was inactive as an ankle injury suffered in practice put him on the injury report late last week. Callahan said he\u2019ll miss a couple weeks, and he was spotted in the locker room with his right foot in a boot.\n\nRecently signed tight end Jerome Cunningham suffered a knee injury that Callahan expected to have more detail later Monday.\n\nCallahan also addressed the timing of placing tight end Jordan Reed on injured reserve. Reed suffered a concussion, his seventh documented in the NFL, in the third preseason game and has yet to be cleared from the league-mandated protocol when the team placed him on IR on Saturday. Callahan was unsure if the team would bring Reed back off IR later in the season.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe gave him as much time as possible to overcome his injury,\u201d Callahan said, \u201cand at this juncture it\u2019s going to be a little bit more prolonged. So, I think the decision to put him on IR was probably the smartest move we could make at this time for him.\u201d\n\nRead more Redskins coverage:\n\nAD", "description": "Bill Callahan made a variety of tweaks to practice after being promoted to interim head coach last week.
