Zelensky told him that Ukraine, a country that relies on international financial and defense aid and is vulnerable compared to its powerful Russian neighbor, would work on the investigation.\n\nThere are question marks over why around $400 million of military aid to Ukraine was put on hold by Trump ahead of the phone call between the presidents. Trump has denied any suggestions that the withholding of aid was to pressure Ukraine into investigating a political opponent.\n\nSpeaking to reporters Thursday, Zelensky said the goal of the call with Trump was to arrange a meeting with the president, according to comments reported by Reuters. He also said he told Trump that Ukraine was asking the White House to change its rhetoric on the country.\n\nHe said military aid to Ukraine was blocked before the phone call but said \"our calls were not linked to Burisma or military aid\" and said no conditions were attached to meeting Trump.\n\n\"I don't want to interfere in U.S. elections,\" Zelensky also said Thursday. He also said Ukraine was waiting for an official visit to the U.S.\n\nThe White House said Tuesday that it will not cooperate with House Democrats' impeachment inquiry into Trump.", "description": "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has said there was no blackmail involved during a telephone call with President Trump that has set in motion an impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Holly Ellyatt"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106157619-1569929172384gettyimages-1171051095.jpeg?v=1570406749", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
