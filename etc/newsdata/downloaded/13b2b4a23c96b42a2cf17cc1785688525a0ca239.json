I hope the casting couch culture isn\u2019t tolerated any more,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to Melissa Silverstein, the founder of Women and Hollywood, the #MeToo movement has been \u201cnothing short of revolutionary\u201d and \u201creshaped the film industry\u2019s DNA\u201d. But film festivals as institutions are still lagging behind, she said.\n\nThis year the London film festival said 65% of its films were directed by women, at Toronto it was 36%, while Berlin had eight and Cannes had four films in competition by women. However, the Venice film festival\u2019s decision to include only two films by women in its 21-film competition was called an \u201cintentional provocation\u201d before the event in September. Venice also premiered films by Roman Polanski \u2013 convicted in 1978, of raping a 13-year-old girl \u2013 and Nate Parker, who was acquitted of an allegation of rape at university.\n\nBoth issues overshadowed the festival and Silverstein called the decision \u201ccompletely tone-deaf\u201d. \u201cThese festivals have not done enough,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes it feels as if they are just sighing and doing what they need to do because they think this will pass. But it won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nSmith said the initiatives that have been introduced at Cannes \u2013 such as a creche and a sexual assault hotline \u2013 do little to counter the \u201cpredatory vibe\u201d of some of the parties held during the festival. The lack of women on judging panels is another way progression has been halted, according to Smith. \u201cThe Palme d\u2019Or jury is so often dominated by older men with the odd glamorous young actress,\u201d she said. \u201cThat perpetrates a very out-of-date message \u2013 the kind of world that Weinstein lived in.\u201d\n\nDame Heather Rabbatts, UK chair of Time\u2019s Up, said that the BFI and Bafta\u2019s decision to introduce guidance on preventing bullying and harassment was a sign of improvement, but that the key for the future would be ensuring that organisations \u201cdo what they say they will\u201d and that any initiatives are sustainable.\n\nIn music, the past 24 months has seen a procession of big name stars coming forward with their own experiences of sexism, harassment and assault. Taylor Swift won a court case against a radio DJ who groped her while taking a photograph with her. Lily Allen gave a detailed account of a record industry executive sexually assaulting her as she slept, warning that similar abuse is \u201crife\u201d in the music business.\n\nHookworms and also The Orwells broke up after accusations of sexual and psychological abuse surfaced \u2013 though all accused deny the allegations. In February, the New York Times levelled a series of accusations of manipulative behaviour at Ryan Adams, who allegedly \u201cdangled career opportunities while simultaneously pursuing female artists for sex\u201d. Adams apologised to anyone hurt but denied all allegations.\n\nThe Brit awards\u2019 organising body, the British Phonographic Industry, encouraged attendees at the 2018 ceremony to wear a white rose pin \u201cas a symbol of solidarity\u201d, without specifically mentioning a cause in a move that was widely criticised. Vick Bain, a former chief executive of the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors, said the industry should \u201cbe focused on creating meaningful change\u201d, while Paul Pacifico, chief executive of the Association of Independent Music, said he appreciated the gesture \u201cbut we already know there is a problem\u201d.\n\nThere has been progress on gender parity at some music festivals, with Primavera Sounds in Barcelona achieving a 50/50 split. \u201cIt\u2019s not difficult once your mind is set,\u201d said Primavera\u2019s Marta Pallares Olivares. After research revealed that 80% of festival lineups were male, 45 events pledged to have gender parity on their lineups by 2022. Last weekend saw the Hear Her festival take place in Poole, which featured an all-female line-up of artists from across a spectrum of folk, pop and indie rock.\n\nSeveral TV shows including Glow, The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Fleabag, The Good Fight, Catastrophe and Silicon Valley have all dedicated storylines to the subject of #MeToo. Dan Reed\u2019s Leaving Neverland made new allegations about Michael Jackson abusing two young boys in the 1990s, while the documentary Surviving R Kelly detailed decades of alleged abuse by the R\u2019n\u2019B singer who is currently awaiting trial and denies the allegations. In Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon\u2019s forthcoming Apple TV project, The Morning Show, the host of a popular chat show is sacked after sexual misconduct.\n\nHBO, meanwhile, introduced intimacy co-ordinators, such as Alicia Rodis who joined David Simon\u2019s 1970s porn and prostitution show The Deuce. These are employed to ensure actors aren\u2019t \u201cleft fumbling in the dark\u201d when trying not to cross boundaries during sex scenes. The practice has now become widespread, with immersive theatre shows such as The Wolf of Wall Street also employing intimacy co-ordinators to protect actors.\n\n\u201cThis is a long-term project and is something that people will have to keep working on all the time,\u201d said Silverstein. \u201cSocial change is not linear.\u201d", "description": "Progress towards equality in the entertainment industry has been patchy, say campaigners", "authors": ["Lanre Bakare"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3635cd1060df9b0df2763c134eeedfc19530c827/83_0_2204_1323/master/2204.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=de3d34f8a4364f0ca98fb452c287f015", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
