But Mr and Mrs MacPhail went further than what was there before.\n\n\u2018In between, they narrowed the alleyway above ground and they dug it out below, right up to the flank wall of Mr and Mrs Gueterbock\u2019s house \u2013 a \u201cland grab\u201d.\u2019\n\nMr Gueterbock, 50, wants an injunction requiring Mr MacPhail to fill in the basement and make the passageway wider again.\n\nMr MacPhail claims that the passageway between the two houses forms part of the title to his property.\n\nWhen the bombsite was compulsorily purchased by the council in 1949, it included the entirety of the passageway, he insists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his defence to his neighbours\u2019 claim, his barrister Sebastian Kokelaar says the Gueterbocks originally objected to the planning application for the MacPhail house.\n\nThey had concerns over the boundary line, a basement lighting grate in the alley floor, and their access for bikes and pushchairs down the side of the house.\n\nBut after negotiations, they had withdrawn their objection, which he says meant they effectively agreed that the gap between the houses was part of what is now the MacPhail property. The boundary between them runs along the side of the Gueterbocks\u2019 house, he says.\n\nHe said: \u2018They stood by and allowed the development to proceed, knowing that the company and the MacPhails believed \u2013 mistakenly, on the Gueterbocks\u2019 case \u2013 that the plans submitted to the council in support of the planning application correctly showed the location of the boundary.\n\n\u2018If, which is denied, the Gueterbocks are the legal owners of the western half of the passageway, it would be unconscionable for them now to insist on their rights of ownership.\u2019\n\nIn court, the MacPhails\u2019 solicitor, Thomas West, said any court order requiring the basement or outer wall of the house to be moved would effectively mean \u2018partial demolition of a completed building\u2019.\n\nThe case appeared in court for a brief preliminary hearing in which parts of the case against Mrs MacPhail were dismissed because, since her November 2016 divorce, she no longer owns the house.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Gueterbocks are seeking an injunction requiring the partial filling in of the basement and repositioning of the house wall against Mr MacPhail alone.\n\nHowever, they continue to sue both Mr and Mrs MacPhail for damages for trespass from the date that the work started until the date she ceased to own it.\n\nNone of the neighbours were present for the hearing and the case itself will be heard by a judge at a later date.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
