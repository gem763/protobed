Schiff, the California Democrat who is leading the impeachment inquiry as the chairman of the Intelligence Committee. The vote, which failed in the Democratic-led chamber, was a display of Republican solidarity for Mr. Trump.\n\nThere are risks for Democrats in the longer timeline, which could make it more difficult for lawmakers in politically competitive districts, who fear a backlash from constituents if they appear to be preoccupied with targeting Mr. Trump instead of addressing major issues such as gun safety or health care.\n\nAnd Democrats are all too aware that Mr. Trump has succeeded in the past in steering the subject away from allegations of misconduct on his part, as he did with the investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential election conducted by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.\n\nThis time, Democratic leaders hope to deny him the opportunity.\n\nThey have issued subpoenas to a growing cast of characters, including Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Trump\u2019s private lawyer who is at the center of the Ukraine pressure campaign, and have demanded documents from Vice President Mike Pence. They have invited or compelled Trump administration officials past and present to appear at the Capitol before rolling television cameras, and cloistered them behind closed doors to extract a daily drip of testimony that backs up their case.\n\nThat effort continues Tuesday when William B. Taylor Jr., the top American diplomat in Ukraine, is scheduled to testify behind closed doors about text messages in which he wrote to other officials that it was \u201ccrazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d On Wednesday, investigators will question Laura Cooper, a Pentagon official, about decisions to hold up Ukraine\u2019s military aid.", "description": "House Democrats, once eyeing an impeachment vote by Thanksgiving, now conceded they may have to go slower as they plan public hearings to drive home their case.", "authors": ["Michael D.
