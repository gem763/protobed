The property index also jumped 6 per cent.\n\nThe withdrawal of the draft legislation was one of the protesters' key demands. Ms Lam has said before that the bill was \"dead\" but she did not withdraw it.\n\nHong Kong returned to China under a \"one country, two systems\" formula that allows it to keep freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland, like the freedom to protest and an independent legal system, hence the anger at the extradition bill and perceived creeping influence by Beijing.\n\nReuters revealed in an exclusive report on Monday that Ms Lam told business leaders last week she had caused \"unforgivable havoc\" by introducing the bill and that if she had a choice she would apologise and resign, according to a leaked audio recording.\n\nAt the closed-door meeting, Ms Lam told the group that she now has \"very limited\" room to resolve the crisis because the unrest has become a national security and sovereignty issue for China amid rising tensions with the United States.\n\nMs Lam's remarks are consistent with a Reuters report published on Friday that revealed how leaders in Beijing were effectively calling the shots on handling the crisis.\n\nINJURIES\n\nThe Chinese government rejected a recent proposal by Ms Lam to defuse the conflict that included withdrawing the extradition bill altogether, three people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\n\nAsked about the report, China's foreign ministry said the central government \"supports, respects and understands\" Ms Lam's decision to suspend the bill. The Global Times, a nationalistic tabloid published by the Communist Party's official People's Daily, denounced it as \"fake\".\n\nChina has regularly denounced the protests and warned about the impact on Hong Kong's economy\n\nChina denies it is meddling in Hong Kong's affairs but warned again on Tuesday that it would not sit idly by if the unrest threatened Chinese security and sovereignty.\n\nThe unrest had shown no sign of easing by Tuesday night.\n\nRiot police fired beanbag guns and used pepper spray - both anti-riot weapons - on Tuesday to clear demonstrators from outside the Mong Kok police station and in Prince Edward metro station, with one man taken out on a stretcher with an oxygen mask over his face, television footage showed.\n\nVideos showing the man being apprehended by the police in the station have been widely shared on social media with protest groups and activists saying it is evidence of the police brutality they say is widespread and needs to be investigated.\n\nThe police, who have repeatedly denied using excessive force, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Hong Kong police are due to hold a news conference at 4pm (0800 GMT).\n\nThree men, aged between 21 and 42, were taken to Kwong Wa Hospital late on Tuesday, a hospital authority spokesman said.\n\nTwo, including the man stretchered out of Prince Edward station, were in a stable condition and one had been discharged, she said.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [HONG KONG] Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam will announce on Wednesday the formal withdrawal of an extradition bill that triggered months of unrest and has thrown the Chinese-controlled city into its worst crisis in decades, Cable TV and other media said. .
