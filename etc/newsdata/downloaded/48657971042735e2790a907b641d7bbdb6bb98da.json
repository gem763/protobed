Leon Neal/Getty Images\n\nThe three-day hearing dealt with two appeals - one lodged in the English courts by campaigner Gina Miller, and one lodged in the Scottish courts by the government.\n\nMiller appealed against the English High Court's decision that the prorogation was \"purely political\" and not a matter for the courts.\n\nThe government appealed against a ruling by Scotland's Court of Session that prorogation was \"unlawful\" because it had been used to \"stymie\" parliament.\n\nThe case was brought by SNP MP Joanna Cherry and a group of over 80 MPs and peers.\n\nThe government's lawyer Lord Keen QC argued that it was \"forbidden territory\" for judges to intervene in political matters.\n\nBut Lord Pannick QC, representing Gina Miller, said the \"exceptional length\" of the prorogation was evidence that Johnson had acted to \"silence parliament\" because it could be an impediment to his political aims.\n\nJohnson claimed that he shut down parliament in order to hold a new Queen's Speech in October and outline the new government's plans for domestic legislation, which is not unusual.\n\nBut opponents said the timing was a clear indication that the real purpose of prorogation was to reduce sitting time ahead of the Brexit deadline on October 31, which MPs planned to use to try and stop Boris Johnson from carrying out his threat to deliver Brexit with or without a deal.\n\nWill Boris Johnson resign?\n\nBoris Johnson FRANK AUGSTEIN/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe prime minister, who is in New York for a UN climate conference, has already faced loud calls from his opponents to resign, which he is likely to resist.\n\nOfficials travelling with Johnson said it would take time to digest what they called an \"extraordinary\" ruling, and provided no indication of when such a ruling would come.\n\nThe Scottish National Party MP Joanna Cherry, who helped bring the case forward, said that Johnson's position was now \"untenable.\"\n\nLabour also called on Johnson to \"consider his position.\"\n\nAsked before the ruling whether he would quit if the Supreme Court found against him, Johnson said: \"I'm going to wait and see what the judgement is.\"\n\nHe added that the government \"fully respects the law and fully respects the judiciary.\"\n\nHowever, the ruling against Johnson will be hugely politically embarrassing and comes after a difficult start to his premiership in which he has lost a series of parliamentary votes and lost his majority in the House of Commons after expelling more than 20 Conservative MPs from the party.\n\nWill parliament return?\n\nBoris Johnson UK Parliament\n\nThe ruling was clear in its judgement that Johnson's prorogation of parliament was \" null and void and had no effect.\"\n\nThat means that, in the eyes of the law, parliament was never suspended, and is likely to re-open immediately.\n\nJohn Bercow, the House of Commons Speaker, called on Tuesday for parliament to return at 11.30 on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe government has insisted that it will \"abide by the ruling\" of the Supreme Court, meaning they are unlikely to resist the verdict.\n\nThis means that members of Parliament, who are currently taking part in a series of party conferences, may have to return to London as early as Wednesday.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who is at the party's annual conference in Brighton, brought forward a speech scheduled on Wednesday to Tuesday afternoon in order to facilitate that plan.", "description": "In a devastating blow to Boris Johnson's authority, the Supreme Court ruled that his decision to shut down parliament before Brexit was unlawful.", "authors": ["Thomas Colson", "Adam Bienkov"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d89e95d2e22af3c4427a872-960-480.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
