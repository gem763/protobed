I was pretty much booed off stage, and laughed off stage, and laughed at during my performances, which crippled my confidence.\u201d\n\nAsked why she was targeted, she said: \u201cI was just the girl that was picked on because I was quite a vulnerable person to be picked on. I\u2019ve really had a rough time of it.\n\n\u201cI love music, but it was never really in my future because I could never see myself being able to come out of my shell.\u201d She said her first practice with the Celebrity X Factor group left her in a state, and she had to see a counsellor.\n\nZara added: \u201cOur first rehearsal session, I was a nervous wreck. I could barely sing in front of the vocal coach.\n\n\u201cI was struggling so much, I was shaking. With the help of therapy that nervousness is getting less.\n\n\u201cIn my head I don\u2019t feel I\u2019ve properly overcome it. Once I get up on that stage and I\u2019ve sung in front of Simon [Cowell] and it\u2019s gone well, that\u2019s when it\u2019ll hit me, and I\u2019ll be like \u2018I\u2019ve overcome it \u2013 I can do anything now\u2019.\u201d\n\nOther stars taking part include Strictly dance pro Brendan Cole, US chat show host Ricki Lake and The Chase quizzer Jenny Ryan.\n\nThe show also features journalist Martin Bashir, Corrie actress Victoria Ekanoye, reality TV star Megan McKenna, and rugby internationals Ben Foden and Thom Evans.\n\nSimon will judge the series alongside Louis Walsh and Nicole Scherzinger.\n\n* The show is today on ITV at 8.35pm.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: The Love Island star has finally found the courage to take part in X Factor: Celebrity after having therapy", "authors": ["Tom Bryant"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20560717.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS195500202.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
