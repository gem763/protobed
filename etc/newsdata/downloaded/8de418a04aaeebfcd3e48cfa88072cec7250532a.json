REUTERS/Simon Dawson\n\nThe FTSE 100 index .FTSE dipped 0.4% by 0755 GMT, with Mondi (MNDI.L) and its rivals DS Smith and Smurfit Kappa (SKG.L) falling 2.8%-4.5%, after Mondi reported a plunge in core earnings due to lower sales volumes and pricing pressure.\n\nHomewares retailer Dunelm (DNLM.L) slid 5.3%, after it flagged a softer market, which partly led to 0.3% dip in the FTSE 250 .FTMC.\n\nAfter starting on the front foot on hopes that trade talks scheduled for tomorrow and Friday would yield a breakthrough, a report that Beijing has urged Washington to stop unreasonable pressure on Chinese companies dragged the main index in to the red.\n\nA report that the U.S. was mulling a currency agreement with China as part of a partial deal that could see a planned tariff hike next week being cancelled had offered some respite to markets, though a separate report said there was lack of progress in deputy-level talks held this week.\n\n\u201cUltimately, goodwill gestures are great but it doesn\u2019t resolve the deep divides that clearly exist on certain issues, which makes a deal in the foreseeable future unlikely,\u201d Oanda analyst Craig Erlam said.\n\nAmidst the trade angst and Brexit worries, the FTSE 100 formed a \u201cDeath Cross\u201d pattern as its 50-day moving average (DMA) crossed below the 200 DMA, a technical pattern that is a warning sign that more losses are likely in the near term.\n\nThe blue-chip bourse last formed the pattern roughly a year ago when Brexit negotiations and Italy\u2019s budget deficit had hit risk appetite.\n\n\u201cThe ebb and flow of sentiment around US, China trade continues to pull global stock markets from pillar to post,\u201d CMC Markets\u2019 Michael Hewson wrote.\n\nSpirits company Diageo (DGE.L), British American Tobacco (BATS.L) and consumer goods firm Unilever (ULVR.L), all of whom book a major part of their earnings in the U.S. dollar, weakened as sterling recovered.\n\nHowever, luxury brand Burberry (BRBY.L) added 1.3% following French rival LVMH\u2019s (LVMH.PA) robust quarterly results despite the Hong Kong protests.\n\nHousebuilders edged higher, led by a 1.1% gain in Taylor Wimpey (TW.L), after a survey showed that a key headline house price index figure rose to a three-month high in August, even as broader uncertainties remain.\n\nSmall-cap fashion retailer N Brown (BWNG.L) jumped 7% after a profit beat.", "description": "London's FTSE 100 handed back gains on Thursday as trade sentiment turned sour after yet another twist in the U.S.-China trade war saga ahead of official talks, while packaging firm Mondi slumped after a weak update.", "authors": ["Muvija M", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439253999&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF99169", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
