It was part of a larger exhibit of the Spanish surrealist\u2019s works at the Dennis Rae Fine Art gallery.\n\n\u201cThey just popped in to the gallery, probably distracting one of my coworkers,\u201d gallery director Angela Kellett told ABC affiliate KGO-TV. \u201cIt was our showcase item. We have a special Salvador Dali show right now, and, yeah, they just ran off with it, too quick for anyone to do anything about it.\u201d\n\n(Check out the interview in the video above.)\n\nA cable and lock attaching the work to the easel were also missing when the etching was grabbed Sunday, according to KGO. It wasn\u2019t known if the cable was cut at the time the work was taken or had been removed earlier.\n\nThe heist reportedly took all of 32 seconds. The thief apparently had a female accomplice who stayed outside and acted as a lookout. The thief\u2019s escape was reportedly captured on other sidewalk surveillance cameras.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how the etching will be fenced. Art thieves sometimes serve clients who want particular pieces, but gallery director Rasjad Hopkins, who was working in the gallery at the time of the theft, told The Associated Press that he believes the heist was a \u201ctheft of opportunity.\u201d\n\nThe thief was \u201cin and out of there in a shot,\u201d he said.\n\nHopkins called the1960s limited-edition, hand-colored work \u201cone of the most desirable pieces out of that period.\u201d He also said it was insured.", "description": "\"They just ran off with it, too quick for anyone to do anything about it,\" said a gallery director.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da534972100001a0e3450fc.jpeg?cache=vwxc6puizn&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
