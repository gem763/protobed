What the public want to hear is what we are doing for them and for the country and the investment in ways of uniting the country.\u201d\n\nAfter days of revelations about Johnson\u2019s relationship with the American tech entrepreneur Jennifer Arcuri, the first day of the Conservative conference in Manchester on Sunday was dogged by the accusation that Johnson grabbed the thighs of two women at a lunch while he was editor of the Spectator magazine.\n\nEdwardes claimed that at the lunch in 1999 Johnson groped her leg under a table, grabbing \u201cenough inner flesh beneath his fingers\u201d to make her \u201csit upright\u201d. She also alleged that he did the same to another woman at the same event.\n\nBoris Johnson groping a woman\u2019s thigh? I can believe that | Suzanne Moore Read more\n\nMary Wakefield, a commissioning editor at the Spectator and the wife of the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, issued a statement saying she was not the woman referred to in the article. \u201cBoris was a good boss and nothing like this ever happened to me,\u201d she said. \u201cNor has Charlotte, who I like and admire, ever discussed the incident with me.\u201d\n\nDowning Street initially declined to comment on Sunday, but after senior ministers were questioned repeatedly about the claim a No 10 spokesperson said: \u201cThe allegation is untrue.\u201d\n\nIn a round of media interviews on Monday morning, Sajid Javid, the chancellor, refused to discuss any details of the allegation or whether it should be investigated.\n\nHe repeatedly backed the prime minister\u2019s version of events, telling BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI\u2019ve talked to the prime minister about that. And first of all, he couldn\u2019t be clearer, absolutely clear, that [the claims] are completely untrue. I totally trust him on that.\u201d\n\nPlay Video 0:26 Sajid Javid backs Boris Johnson over groping allegations \u2013 video\n\nJavid also told BBC One\u2019s Breakfast: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to get drawn into personal allegations. For my part I\u2019m not going to get into that. The prime minister has said that this is completely untrue, and I have full faith in the prime minister. I don\u2019t doubt what he has said for a second but I\u2019m not going to get drawn into these allegations.\u201d\n\nJavid\u2019s backing for Johnson has not been completely matched by current and former ministers. On Sunday evening, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, told Channel 4 News of Edwardes: \u201cI know her and I know her to be trustworthy.\u201d\n\nAmber Rudd, the former work and pensions secretary who resigned this month, later tweeted: \u201cI agree with @MattHancock.\u201d\n\nJustine Greening, the former Tory cabinet minister who now sits as an independent, told the Today programme: \u201cI can\u2019t comment on those accusations but they are deeply concerning and in a sense they go to the heart of this question about character and integrity of people in public life and what standards the electorate have a right to expect.\u201d\n\nAsked if there should be an investigation into the claims, Javid told Sky: \u201cThere are these types of allegations all the time against all sorts of people, and I\u2019m not going to get drawn into what should or shouldn\u2019t happen when such allegations are made.\u201d\n\nJavid will make a speech to the conference later on Monday as the centrepiece of a day devoted to what will be the Conservatives\u2019 key election message on greater spending for public services and infrastructure.\n\nThe chancellor was due to announce billions of pounds of spending on roads, buses and internet connectivity as \u201cthe first step in our plans to deliver an infrastructure revolution\u201d.\n\nHowever, little of the money is new. The main commitment, \u00a325bn to upgrade roads over five years, was announced last year. The only new element is confirmation of which specific projects have been chosen as the first to go ahead.\n\nAnother element of the spending package, \u00a3220m for what is billed as a national bus strategy to improve services across England, including money on electric buses, was announced at the last government spending round.\n\nHowever, the Treasury said all but \u00a3200m of an announced \u00a35bn to improve full-fibre and 5G internet networks was new.\n\nJohn McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, called the announcements a \u201ccombination of re-announcements and damp squibs\u201d.", "description": "Prime minister is asked about journalist\u2019s claim during visit to business in Manchester", "authors": ["Peter Walker", "Kate Proctor", "Heather Stewart", "Frances Perraudin", "John Crace"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65bb575f271bce3de4faade3555c6ce995667ad5/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=37e36d480b1c0ffa9a23e81dff917302", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
