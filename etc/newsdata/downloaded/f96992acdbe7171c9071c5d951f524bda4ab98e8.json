Well, it looks like this exact scenario happened to Willow and Jayden this week. On Wednesday night, Will Smith announced that he is officially expanding his social media empire by joining TikTok, the app that turns every teen into a mini-Scorsese for up to 15 seconds. Smith\u2019s first TikTok features a youth scrolling through photos of Smith on his phone while a rap song bumps underneath. He eventually plucks one of the photos of Smith off of his Phone, and physically drops Smith into the room with him! As the song crescendos, the camera zooms in on a visibly confused Smith who says, \u201cI guess I\u2019m on TikTok now. That was weird\u201d before ending the video by awkwardly looking around like the middle aged man that he is. Smith is not the only movie star to step up their social media game recently, as Reese Witherspoon joined TikTok last week with the help of her son, Deacon. If megawatt movie stars keep downloading apps to connect with their teenage children, we predict that the film industry will be rendered completely obsolete in approximately 18 months. Thanks a lot, Gen Z!\n\nWill Smith has joined TikTok pic.twitter.com/5F4sN1G7kV \u2014 Taylor Lorenz (@TaylorLorenz) October 3, 2019", "description": "Movie Stars like Will Smith and Reese Witherspoond continue to expand their ever growing social media presence by joining social media platforms like TikTok.", "authors": ["Chris Murphy"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/10/02-Will-Smith.w1200.h630.jpg"}
