And every family deserves to have good healthcare from day one. So let's build on Obamacare and finish the job.\"\n\nThe 15-second ad, called \"Family,\" is running on YouTube. It is part of the campaign's six-figure advertising campaign on television and digital platforms in Iowa.\n\nHere's the ad that was released Tuesday morning:\n\nAccording to data from the media tracking firm Advertising Analytics, Biden's campaign has spent $686,573 on television advertisements in the Hawkeye State. The Biden campaign says \"Family\" is designed to complement the health care message in other television and digital advertisements by hitting voters multiple times a day.\n\nWhile the ad will reach voters across Iowa, the campaign says it will specifically focus on new parents, and it will target voters who are engaging with products designed for newborns.\n\nMost of the advertisement features home pictures and videos, which the campaign gathered from supporters. It shows families spending time together and newborn babies in the hospital before closing with a shot of Biden hugging former President Obama.\n\nBiden has been the frontrunner in the Democratic primary since entering the race. In the most recent CBS News Battleground Tracker poll, 29% of registered Iowa voters who are Democrats said Biden is their top choice for the nomination, followed by Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders with 26% and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren with 17%.\n\nHealth care is the top issue for Democrats in Iowa, with 89% saying the issue is \"very important,\" according to a July CBS News poll. In that poll, 66% of Iowa Democrats said they preferred a national health insurance plan that competes with private insurance, while 34% preferred eliminating private insurance.\n\nBiden has drawn sharp contrasts with Sanders and Warren on healthcare by saying that Democrats should build on the Affordable Care Act rather than pushing for a \"Medicare for All\" system that eliminates private insurance.\n\n\"I know that the senator says she's for Bernie, well, I'm for Barack,\" Biden said during the third Democratic debate, referring to Warren and Sanders' shared stance on Medicare for All. \"I think the Obamacare worked. I think the way \u2014 we add to it, replace everything that's been cut, add a public option, guarantee that everyone will be able to have affordable insurance.\"", "description": "The ad is aimed at new parents and will target voters who are engaging with products for newborns", "authors": ["Adam Brewster", "Musadiq Bidar"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/08/07/385e69ed-05de-4e9a-b926-ac496dd90c9e/thumbnail/1200x630/9c2229566a96f6009efbdd27f0f2b1d4/gettyimages-1149334411.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
