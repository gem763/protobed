How will Keenum be remembered? Is he keeping the driver\u2019s seat warm for first-round pick Dwayne Haskins or can he prove he\u2019s a good NFL quarterback, like he looked in Minnesota in 2017? Keenum\u2019s performance against the Eagles will provide the first real hint of how this season might go.\n\nDerrius Guice is one of the most popular players among Redskins fans, yet Sunday will mark his first time ever taking a regular-season snap. After tearing his ACL in his first preseason game as a rookie in 2018, Guice completed a long road to recovery and will start Sunday. Washington listed him ahead of Adrian Peterson on the depth chart, with coach Jay Gruden saying the team has gotten him prepared to handle \u201cthe mother load\u201d of carries.\n\nCarson Wentz will take the field for the first time since his second straight season-ending injury, a fractured vertebra. Wentz\u2019s last game was Dec. 9 of last year; he missed the playoffs and sat out the 2019 preseason. The former No. 2 overall pick will face extra scrutiny as he returns to lead a team that again has Super Bowl aspirations \u2014 after all, this year Wentz doesn\u2019t have Nick Foles waiting in the wings if he goes down again.\n\nPre-game reading:\n\nWhat goes around keeps going around for the #Redskins, @thomloverro writes https://t.co/ms1sMKZiRg \u2014 WashTimes Sports (@WashTimesSports) September 6, 2019\n\nWith the possibility of being inactive for Week 1, Adrian Peterson is accepting a reduced role in the #Redskins offense, by @Matthew_Paras https://t.co/LiAYrvRLjq \u2014 WashTimes Sports (@WashTimesSports) September 6, 2019\n\nPower shift: Marquee players find leverage in league long ruled by owners, by @Matthew_Paras https://t.co/uZs6jJy9ql \u2014 WashTimes Sports (@WashTimesSports) September 6, 2019\n\nCase by Case: As a backup or starter, #Redskins QB Keenum keeps an even keel, by @Matthew_Paras https://t.co/5pVWnvSViV \u2014 WashTimes Sports (@WashTimesSports) September 5, 2019\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t have been unheard of for Jay Gruden to relinquish play-calling duties to Kevin O\u2019Connell.
