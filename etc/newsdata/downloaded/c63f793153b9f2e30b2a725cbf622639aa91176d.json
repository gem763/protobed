But he has since turned them into a rallying cry like his predecessor and blamed them for the collapsing economy as hopes fade that he will revive the country's fortunes.\n\nThe U.S. says the sanctions are not against Zimbabwe's government at large and do not affect business between the countries. The U.S also says it is the biggest provider of humanitarian assistance to the southern African nation, whose 300% inflation is the second highest in the world after Venezuela's.\n\nZimbabwe has tried to rally regional countries to speak out against the sanctions and earlier this week even held a tearful anti-sanctions prayer meeting organized by the president's wife and attended by the president, his cabinet and dozens of others.\n\nSome in the capital struggled to comprehend the rationale behind such events by a government that is failing to pay doctors and buy medicines, but they said they wouldn't mind the holiday.\n\n\"We march, watch soccer, eat, drink and dance the night away ... then what next?\" asked Chengetedzo Mbundure, an office worker in Harare. \"It is unnecessary but it is welcome. Who doesn't love a holiday?\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Africa news at https://twitter.com/AP\u2014Africa", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
