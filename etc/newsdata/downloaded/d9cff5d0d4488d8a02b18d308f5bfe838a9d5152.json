Here's Why", "language": "en", "text": "When Donald Trump says he\u2019s \u201cnever met\u201d someone, it can mean a lot of things. One thing it doesn\u2019t: that they literally have never met.\n\nOn multiple occasions over the last few years, the president has plainly stated that he doesn\u2019t know someone, has never met them or doesn\u2019t even know who they are \u2014 even when he clearly does.\n\nOne example came at a press conference in November of 2018, when he was asked about the rapper Lil Jon, who said that Trump had once called him an \u201cUncle Tom.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know who Lil Jon is. I don\u2019t \u2014 I really don\u2019t,\u201d Trump replied.\n\nBut Trump not only knows who the rapper is, he knows him personally. Lil Jon was a two-time contestant on \u201cThe Celebrity Apprentice.\u201d Trump has referred to him in the past as an \u201camazing and wonderful guy,\u201d a \u201cterrific guy\u201d and a \u201cgreat friend.\u201d\n\nIn that case, Trump was claiming he didn\u2019t know someone who had accusing him of poor behavior. He used a similar defense against a former Trump Tower receptionist who said that Trump once kissed her \u201cdirectly on the mouth\u201d against her will during an introductory meeting. Trump responded that he didn\u2019t know her and had never met her.\n\nAnd he used the line when defending himself after mocking a New York Times reporter at a 2015 campaign rally, claiming that his curled-up hands and shaking on stage were not a reference to the reporter\u2019s disability since he doesn\u2019t know him or \u201cwhat he looks like.\u201d\n\nBut Trump also uses the same line against his critics, as a way of arguing that they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about. That was the case with George Conway, the husband of one of his top aides. \u201cI barely know him,\u201d Trump said on Twitter. He later retweeted his campaign manager claiming that \u201cPOTUS doesn\u2019t even know him!\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post later published a 2006 letter from Trump in which he thanked Conway for his help on a problem in one of his buildings, adding in a postscript \u201cyou have a truly great voice, certainly not a bad asset for a top trial lawyer!\u201d\n\nTrump has also used the line against critics that he really doesn\u2019t know, including former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and retired Marine Gen. John Allen.\n\nIt\u2019s also a way for Trump to diminish someone as unimportant, since he presumes they would have met if they were. That was the case when he attacked Democratic Sen. Bob Casey during a 2018 campaign rally for his Republican opponent.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I ever met Bob Casey, I never met him,\u201d Trump told the audience at a Pennsylvania arena. Then, he added: \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure I did, I shook his hand. His father was a good man, a totally different person. I don\u2019t think, I don\u2019t know this man. He\u2019s a senator, there\u2019s 100 senators, I don\u2019t know him.\u201d\n\nA Philadelphia TV station then dug up a photo and transcript of Casey and Trump at a meeting in the Cabinet Room of the White House talking about proposed tariffs on imported steel earlier that year. A spokesman for Casey\u2019s campaign cited three other interactions in previous months as well.\n\nTrump has also used the line to distance himself from people when a relationship might be problematic, as he did when former campaign adviser George Papadopoulos got into legal trouble.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know him. I saw him sitting, in one picture, at a table with me. That\u2019s the \u2014 that\u2019s the only thing I know about him,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Trump had previously cited Papadopolous as a member of his foreign policy team\u2014\u201dan energy and oil consultant, excellent guy,\u201d he said an interview with the Washington Post \u2014 and once tweeted a photo of a meeting in which Papadopoulos sat near him.\n\nPapadopoulos, a former foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign, pleaded guilty to lying to federal agents @realdonaldtrump/twitter/reuters George\n\nTrump even used the line against his own acting attorney general \u2014 \u201cI don\u2019t know Matt Whitaker\u201d \u2014 contradicting what he had said a month earlier on Fox News \u2014 \u201cI mean, I know Matt Whitaker.\u201d\n\nHe did the same with WikiLeaks, the website that worked with Russian intelligence to publicize stolen Hillary Clinton emails. During the 2016 campaign, Trump regularly brought up WikiLeaks, saying at one rally \u201cI love WikiLeaks.\u201d But when WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange was arrested in London, Trump took the opposite tack.\n\n\u201cI know nothing about WikiLeaks,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s not my thing.\u201d\n\nTrump made a similar about-face with Russian president Vladimir Putin. From 2015 to 2016 he went from saying that he has \u201ca relationship\u201d with Putin, that Putin once gave him a present, that he\u2019s spoken with him and \u201cgot to know him very well,\u201d to saying \u201cI don\u2019t know who Putin is,\u201d \u201cI have no relationship with Putin\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t know Putin.\u201d\n\nTrump, as the saying goes, has \u201cnever met\u201d a person he doesn\u2019t like.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "When Donald Trump says he's \"never met\" someone, it can mean a lot of things.
