The Ninth Circuit ruling said the two contractors could face limited questioning.\n\nJoseph Margulies, a Cornell University law professor who represented Zubaydah for more than a decade, said the ruling was a milestone.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first time an appellate court, to my knowledge, has come right out and said that the enhanced interrogation techniques were torture,\u201d Marguelies told the San Francisco Chronicle . \u201cWe\u2019re no longer going to equivocate.\u201d\n\nZubaydah has been held without charge since September 2006 at the detention center on the U.S. base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. His lawyers have urged the government to file charges against him so they can challenge his confinement.\n\nThe Palestinian man was wounded and captured in Pakistan in 2002 by U.S. agents, who labeled him a high-ranking Al Qaeda operative. He was shuttled between secret CIA sites around the world for the next four years before winding up at Guantanamo Bay.\n\nThe court cited a report in 2014 by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, chaired by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California.\n\nMost of the 6,700-page report remains classified, but a 525-page public summary included a disclosure that the CIA had eventually concluded Zubaydah was not a member of Al Qaeda. The report also found that torture in interrogations had produced little useful intelligence.\n\nAt the secret CIA sites, the court said, Zubaydah was \u201cpersistently and repeatedly waterboarded,\u201d held in a \u201ccoffin-sized \u2026 confinement box\u201d for hundreds of hours, kept in cramped and stressful positions, slapped, grabbed and deprived of sleep. Insects were placed near him to exploit a personal phobia, and he was subjected to a mock burial.\n\nJames E. Mitchell and John \u201cBruce\u201d Jessen, psychologists in Spokane, Washington, were hired by the CIA as independent contractors, developed the interrogation program, and, according to the Senate report, took part in waterboarding Zubaydah.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Ninth U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco used the word \"torture\" in a 2-1 ruling to describe the harsh interrogation methods used against a prisoner known as Abu Zubaydah while he was held in clandestine CIA detention facilities overseas.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/19/cia_torture_49161_c0-124-338-321_s1770x1032.jpg?872df73b0725e9fb0d4b07278c18283ccd7a0e2a", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
