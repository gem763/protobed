Economists expect a fall in sterling and higher oil prices following an attack on a key refinery in Saudi Arabia to push up consumer prices in the coming months.\n\nAnnual inflation in the U.K. slowed to 1.7% in August, the Office for National Statistics said Wednesday, the slowest rate of price growth since December 2016. Consumer prices rose 2.1% on the year in July.\n\nThe slowdown was fueled by a 5% decline in computer game prices between July and August and smaller rises in clothing prices compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe Bank of England has signaled it expects to nudge up interest rates two or three times in the next couple of years to keep a lid on inflation, assuming the U.K.'s exit from the European Union goes smoothly.\n\nWrite to Jason Douglas at Jason.Douglas@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 18, 2019 04:47 ET (08:47 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
