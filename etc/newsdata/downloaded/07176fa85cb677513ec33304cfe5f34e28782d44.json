Photo: Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nThe first person a fake version of Donald Trump kills after entering the \u201cChurch of Fake News\u201d is a fake version of Peter Fonda, who once tweeted something terrible about Barron Trump. Then he turns his attention to the media, blasting bullets through people with the logos of Vox, Bloomberg, and Politico superimposed over their faces. Then comes ABC, the New Yorker, Vice News, Slate, and more. If the message wasn\u2019t clear enough, he also shoots several people labeled \u201cFake News.\u201d\n\nThe ultra-violent video, adapted from the 2014 movie Kingsman: The Secret Service, was shown last week at a pro-Trump conference held at the President\u2019s own Trump National Doral resort in Florida, according to the New York Times. The conference also included appearances by Donald Trump Jr., former White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, and Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz, according to its website.\n\nIn addition to killing people representing different media organizations, the figure with Trump\u2019s face superimposed on it also takes out several of his political rivals. Adam Schiff, John McCain, Maxine Waters, Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton are among his targets. So too is a person representing Black Lives Matter.\n\nThe video of a mass shooting by the President inside a church is reminiscent of the Charleston shooting. Executing members of the media is reminiscent of the Maryland newsroom shooting.\n\n\n\nThis video is racist and hateful and it\u2019s flabbergasting that it was shown at Trump\u2019s resort. pic.twitter.com/v9BqxZ4Ns5 \u2014 Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) October 14, 2019\n\nIn a statement on its website, American Priority, the organization holding the conference where the video was played, says the \u201cunauthorized video\u201d was shown in a \u201cside room\u201d at the gathering. \u201cThe video was not approved, seen, or sanctioned\u201d by festival organizers, the statement from organizer Alex Phillips said. He goes on to blame the Times for focusing on the unsanctioned video, rather than the conference\u2019s panel \u201ccondemning political violence.\u201d\n\nThe Trump campaign has also distanced itself from the video, saying in a statement that it \u201cwas not produced by the campaign, and we do not condone violence.\u201d White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham issued a pre-condemnation on Trump\u2019s behalf Monday, tweeting that he \u201chas not yet seen the video,\u201d but \u201cbased upon everything he has heard, he strongly condemns\u201d it.\n\nTrump\u2019s critics are not letting him off the hook though. After years of declaring the press the \u201cenemy of the people,\u201d a video celebrating the murder of journalists is drawing broad disapproval.\n\nThe White House Correspondents\u2019 Association said in a statement Sunday that it\u2019s \u201chorrified.\u201d The statement continued: \u201cAll Americans should condemn this depiction of violence directed toward journalists and the President\u2019s political opponents. We have previously told the President his rhetoric could incite violence. Now we call on him and everybody associated with this conference to denounce this video and affirm that violence has no place in our society.\u201d\n\nCNN said in a statement that this \u201cis not the first time that supporters of the President have promoted violence against the media in a video they apparently find entertaining \u2014 but it is by far and away the worst.\u201d\n\nAt least one of the people whose face appears on the body of a victim also responded.\n\n\u201cIm depicted as being murdered by The President of the United States in this video,\u201d comedian Kathy Griffin tweeted. In 2017, Griffin was widely criticized for posting a photo showing her holding a fake decapitated Trump head. \u201cThe left, right & center left me hanging out to dry regarding the Trump mask photo. Please don\u2019t let it happen again. No, this video isn\u2019t a joke to his followers. And it will not be taken as such.\u201d\n\nCindy McCain, whose late husband, the former Senator John McCain, is smashed in the back of the head with a pistol in the video, tweeted that it violates \u201cevery norm our society expects from its leaders& the institutions that bare their names.\u201d\n\nTrump has not tweeted about the video, but he did tweet this:\n\nVote for good guy @seanspicer tonight on Dancing With The Stars. He has always been there for us! \u2014 Donald J.
