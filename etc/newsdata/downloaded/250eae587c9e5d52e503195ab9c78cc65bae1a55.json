It\u2019s wild\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "He sounds like Joe Cocker, swears like a trooper and has David Hasselhoff beating down his door. How did Lewis Capaldi become a global superstar? \u2018I\u2019ve got no clue,\u2019 he says on tour in Chicago\n\nThe last time Lewis Capaldi visited Times Square in New York, he was confronted by his own face: a poster for Spotify stretching the height of a building. It featured him wearing a selection from his apparently inexhaustible collection of idiotic-looking sunglasses: a white-framed women\u2019s pair, not unlike the ones Kurt Cobain took to wearing near the end of his life. He looked at least a little more like a rock star than he usually does in promotional photos. A British poster campaign features what is supposed to be his Tinder profile: a photo of Capaldi grinning gormlessly, his hair wrapped in a towel. He is flashing a peace sign and the caption reads: \u201cOtherwise known as the Scottish Beyonc\u00e9.\u201d\n\nOf course, he took a photo of the Times Square poster and stuck it on Instagram and Facebook. In a perfect example of Capaldi\u2019s approach to social media, he listed his location as \u201cGENERAL ERECTION\u201d and counselled \u201cnyc pls don\u2019t trip over yr boners xox\u201d. The thing is, he asks, as he demolishes a burger in a Chicago restaurant, how else are you supposed to react? These ridiculous things keep happening to him.\n\nHe posted a video of himself frowning while listening to Camila Cabello\u2019s new single, mock-horrified that it could outsell his single Someone You Loved in the US. The next thing he knew, Cabello had covered Someone You Loved, \u201cand obviously she smashed it, doing all these vocal runs I can\u2019t do \u2013 I was like: \u2018Can\u2019t you just sing it without showing me up?\u2019\u201d The other night, there was a knock on his dressing room door and David Hasselhoff was standing outside: when Calvin Harris commented on the ensuing Instagram selfie, Hasselhoff immediately nipped in and suggested the three of them make a record together, \u201cwhich would obviously be fucking excellent\u201d, Capaldi laughs. \u201cJump in My Car, but with Calvin Harris producing. The last time I saw David Hasselhoff in the flesh, he was playing Captain Hook in the panto at the Glasgow Armadillo. I was there with my family the day after Christmas, pished. And I\u2019ll tell you something: his performance was a revelation.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s all so weird, he says, that you have to laugh at it. \u201cYou cannot fathom some of the stuff when it is going on. It\u2019s just daft. I sometimes worry that people think I\u2019m just talking shite, and feel I\u2019m not as surprised with things: \u2018Oh, he\u2019s been doing so well now that he must be used to it.\u2019 But I\u2019m not. It\u2019s fucking wild.\u201d\n\nIt is indeed. A year ago, Capaldi looked suspiciously like he could be a one-hit wonder. One of a glut of earnest, dressed-down acoustic singer-songwriters the Guardian subsequently referred to as \u201cordinary boys\u201d, he had been plucked from a life of obscurity playing pubs around his home town of Bathgate, West Lothian, by a manager who stumbled across the songs Capaldi was uploading to SoundCloud. \u201cMy immediate reaction,\u201d notes Capaldi, \u201cwas: \u2018Fuck off.\u2019\u201d His single Bruises became a vast streaming hit \u2013 28m plays on Spotify, apparently unprecedented for an unsigned artist \u2013 but its follow-ups did nothing like as well. \u201cI shat myself,\u201d says Capaldi, \u201cbecause I thought the single we\u2019d released \u2013 Tough \u2013 was the best song I had, and it hadn\u2019t done anything.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Someone You Loved.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until Capaldi\u2019s label released Someone You Loved that things went ballistic: seven weeks at No 1, the biggest-selling single of the year in Britain, and a platinum hit across Europe and Australia. His album, Divinely Uninspired to a Hellish Extent, is the fastest-selling debut by a British artist in eight years. Then it started selling in the US.\n\nThe day I meet him, Someone You Loved is No 3 in the US chart, causing Capaldi to start referring to himself ironically as \u201cAmerica\u2019s sweetheart\u201d, posing for photographs in an Uncle Sam outfit while clutching a bunch of roses and plastering the slogan all over his US tour merchandise. \u201cIt started as a shite joke,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause I\u2019m not America\u2019s sweetheart, do you know what I mean? I\u2019ve got one song. The album has only just started to move here. But then people who come to the gigs are making it a thing. They started screaming: \u2018America\u2019s sweetheart!\u2019 at me. They\u2019re making little videos about it online, so it just became: \u2018Well, how stupid can we make it?\u2019 So we rented an Uncle Sam costume, really taking the piss.\u201d\n\nThe music should be serious, and everything else should be fun because it is fun\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d he deadpans, \u201cI looked absolutely tremendous in it.\u201d\n\nHe seems baffled as to why it has happened; why he \u2013 out of the serried ranks of post-Ed Sheeran singer-songwriters \u2013 became the one who is selling millions and the first artist in history to sell out a UK arena tour before he had even released an album. \u201cI\u2019ve got no clue. \u2018What right do I have to be playing arenas?\u2019 is what goes through my head. Impostor syndrome. I\u2019m not better than any of these people, I\u2019m not better at writing songs or singing.\u201d\n\nThe prosaic answer is that none of his peers had a song that captured audiences\u2019 imaginations the way Someone You Loved has. It is a breakup track that acts as a kind of evil twin to Adele\u2019s Someone Like You; that song\u2019s stoic resolve replaced by wounded disbelief. It might also have something to do with Capaldi\u2019s voice \u2013 a full-throated, emotive roar that he alighted on after hearing Joe Cocker\u2019s 1969 cover of the Beatles\u2019 With a Little Help from My Friends as a teenager.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Delusions of grandeur can be very, very dangerous indeed \u2026\u2019 Lewis Capaldi on stage at Thalia Hall Photograph: Michelle Kanaar/The Guardian\n\n\u201cI could always sing loud because I was playing pubs when I was 11, and you\u2019ve got to sing loud there. But I saw Joe Cocker on some Beatles documentary, and I was floored. I tried to sing like that, and I was fucking terrible, as you would expect from someone going through puberty trying to give it the raspy voice,\u201d he laughs. \u201cBut then I finally fell into it at around 18. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve done some irreparable damage to my voice trying to get here. I never had any lessons, but obviously now I\u2019ve had coaching to keep it going. I get really bad acid reflux, so I\u2019ve got to watch myself on tour: no spicy foods, as little alcohol as possible.\u201d He sighs. \u201cSee Mick Jagger, Elton John, all these cunts on tour in the 70s, going around doing everything, taking all these drugs, sounding great. I take one drink of Red Bull and I\u2019m choked.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s something else about Capaldi\u2019s fame. He is incredibly likable in person: funny, warm, and implausibly fond of swearing (looking at the transcription of our interview, he said \u201cfuck\u201d or \u201cfucking\u201d 243 times in the space of 90 minutes). Moreover, he has proved very adept at projecting that likability on stage \u2013 where what he refers to as his \u201cblether\u201d between songs occasionally lasts as long as the songs themselves \u2013 and on social media.\n\nHis Instagram and Twitter feeds are unfailingly hilarious and self-deprecating. In a pop world filled with artists telling audiences to be themselves while posting perfectly filtered selfies, Capaldi is himself, whether he is mocking his chubby physique (\u201cIt\u2019s an honour to have been #blessed with these abs & to finally be able to give back and help others reach those #jacked goals is beyond a dream\u201d), parrying the insults hurled his way by Noel Gallagher or talking about his own mental health issues. He started having panic attacks on stage a year ago, became convinced he had a brain tumour and paid for an MRI scan before learning to quell them with cognitive behavioural therapy. He plans to set aside a space at his gigs so that other people with anxiety issues can attend in relative comfort.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest US fans queuing for Capaldi\u2019s Chicago gig. Photograph: Michelle Kanaar/The Guardian\n\nHe is a very modern kind of pop star: part singer-songwriter, part social-media celebrity who easily #relatable in an era when #relatability is a hugely saleable commodity. He says his record label has never suggested he employ a stylist or go to the gym. And he calls me out when I refer to his social media campaign. \u201cYou say \u2018campaign\u2019, but no one\u2019s told me to say anything. It\u2019s just me, jetlagged in a room somewhere, talking absolute shite. The self-deprecating thing \u2013 that\u2019s just how people from my home town talk. I love the comedian Limmy and the way he pushes things until they get more and more stupid. It always makes it funnier when everyone else has stopped laughing and you\u2019re still, like: \u2018No, this is brilliant.\u2019 The music should be serious, and everything else should be fun because it is fun.\u201d\n\nBesides, he says, you may as well enjoy it because you\u2019ve got no idea how long it\u2019s going to last. He\u2019d be happy, he adds, if his second album does even half the sales of the first. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s the way I\u2019m wired; maybe my mum and dad have put pessimism in my veins. But I think it\u2019s a good way to be. Delusions of grandeur can be very, very dangerous indeed. You have to have a word with yourself, like: shut your fucking hole, you\u2019re living your dream here. Going: \u2018Hi, I\u2019m Lewis Capaldi and you\u2019re listening to Chicago\u2019s B96,\u2019 \u2013 these people are playing your song, so just get on with it. My pal at home, he literally digs graves for a living. So saying: \u2018You\u2019re listening to my new song,\u2019 on some radio station, it\u2019s not really a hard time.\u201d\n\nAnd off he goes to get on with it. That night, Thalia Hall in Chicago is sold out: the queue starts snaking around the block hours before showtime. The audience know every word of every song, and do seem to be taking the idea of Capaldi as America\u2019s sweetheart seriously, amending chants of \u201cUSA!\u201d to: \u201cLew-is-A!\u201d Just before the closing performance of Someone You Loved, persons unknown throw a pair of stars and stripes underpants on to the stage. He pulls them on over his jeans. \u201cI hope these are XXL size,\u201d he nods. \u201cBecause I have a massive penis.\u201d Then they start chanting again.", "description": "He sounds like Joe Cocker, swears like a trooper and has David Hasselhoff beating down his door.
