This is a fine, seemingly unflawed sequence of events, but a little rest in between bath and sear will help ensure you don\u2019t overcook your steak (or chop).\n\nYou have probably been told you don\u2019t need to \u201crest\u201d a precision cooked meat, as the lack of temperature gradient inside a precision cooked steak or chop means you don\u2019t have to worry about juices spilling out if you slice too soon.\n\nThis is all true, but putting a hot steak in an even hotter pan is just going to raise its temperature further, meaning \u2014 in the case of thinner cuts especially \u2014 that piece of meat you just slowly cooked for an hour or so is now more \u201cdone\u201d than you wanted it to be. (The reverse sear method takes this into account \u2014 you intentionally slow cook your meat to a temperature that is 15-20 degrees below your target temperature, as the act of searing will bring it up to the target temp.)\n\nIf you usually finish your precision cooked meat on the grill, you probably haven\u2019t noticed this: by the time you take the meat out of the bag, pat it dry, walk it over to the grill and futz around with the grill a bit (grillers are prone to futzing), it\u2019s probably dropped in temperature. But if you\u2019re the type to pre-heat your cast iron before your steak even comes out of the bag, you might be overcooking it in your quest to get that perfect crust.\n\nBut don\u2019t take my word(s) for it, let\u2019s look at some numbers. The other night I cooked two pork chops, with a precision cooker, for an hour and a half at 60 degrees Celsius. One chop was seared immediately upon removal from the bath, and the other was seared after a 10-minute rest on the cutting board.\n\nIn just a few minutes, after searing both sides (and the fatty edges) to a nice, deep, just-past-golden brown, the unrested chop had reached an internal temperature of 64 degrees Celsius, which is quite a bit hotter than I wanted it to be. (And yes, I flipped frequently to help the heat dissipate.) The rested chop, however, had dropped down to 52 degrees during its nap, and after searing, climbed back up 58, a mere two degrees over the bath temperature.\n\nLuckily, none of this is a very big deal, and overcooking your precious precision cooked steak or chop is easily avoided. Just let the meat rest for 10 minutes or so while you heat your cast iron pan and dress a salad or whatever. Sear it, unhurried, for a few minutes, letting that beautiful crust develop, unworried about crossing the dreaded line from medium-rare to medium.", "description": "Most precision cooked meat recipes follow a pretty standard format: Put your meat in a plastic bag, place the bag in a water bath set to your desired temperature, cook the meat for about an hour, then finish the meat on the grill or super hot pan.
