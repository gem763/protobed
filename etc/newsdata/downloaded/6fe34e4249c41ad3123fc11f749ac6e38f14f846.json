He now urges everyone to take control of their health.\n\nAfter the tumor was discovered, doctors also told Mathison they believe the mass was growing inside his kidney for 10 years or possibly longer. Amazingly enough, the tumor hasn't spread.\n\n\"I don't drink, eat incredibly healthy, I eat a very low sugar, low carbohydrate diet typically,\" he explained. \"Things that likely in our best guess have have helped it from spreading, and growing even quicker.\"\n\nMathison is set to have surgery Thursday to remove the mass.\n\n\"We might be taking a kidney outta your body,\" he says doctors told him, depending on the surgery results.\n\nAfter the interview, Dr. Jennifer Ashton said in Mathison's case, \"Always trust your body.\"\n\nWhile insurance and costs might make it hard for a doctor to send you for an MRI or another test right away after your first visit, no one knows your body better than you.\n\n\"The key is making the diagnosis as early as possible,\" she added.", "description": "Actor, host and former", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/cameron-mathison-abc-ml-190911_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
