However, incessant bickering can be very harmful for your bond. Here\u2019s how to be smarter when you are at loggerheads with each other.Don\u2019t nitpick about every little thing; choose to make an issue about things that really matter to you and the relationship. However, if you find that there are certain serious issues that your partner is unwilling to compromise on, that always ignite huge fights, then you would do better to let them be for the sake of peace and deal with them in other ways.If you find that the fight is escalating beyond control, then it would do you and your partner well to take some time to cool off. Remove yourself from the situation for a bit\u2014go for a walk or to another room\u2014till you are calmer. Experts say that it takes us about 40 minutes to truly get our equanimity back! However, don\u2019t leave in a huff; tell your partner that you think it would be best for both of you to take a time-out.Have the grace to see the other person\u2019s point of view and admit that you were wrong. It does not make you a smaller person. Holding on to grudges and being unwilling to compromise will make the fight fester and cause a deeper rift than it deserves.There\u2019s no rule that says that you have to keep all your relationship stresses close to your chest. If you feel that you cannot handle a situation or if a cold war is going on for too long with your guy, then feel free to confide in a friend or family member and request them to mediate. They will not only be able to guide you but will also be able to provide a third person perspective in the issue at hand.", "description": "If you must fight with your partner, then do it intelligently.
