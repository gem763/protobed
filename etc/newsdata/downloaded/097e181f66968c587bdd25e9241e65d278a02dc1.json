(NASDAQ: AAPL) shares have been flirting with record highs in recent sessions, thanks to upbeat expectations surrounding the uptake of the latest iPhone.\n\nThe Cupertino, California-based company is set to report fourth-quarter results Wednesday after the market close.\n\nUpbeat Q4 Expectations\n\nAnalysts, on average, expect Apple to report fourth-quarter earnings per share of $2.84 compared to $2.91 one year ago, according to the Yahoo Finance database.\n\nThe Street EPS estimate has been revised substantially higher, from $2.67 at the start of the quarter to the current $2.84.\n\nThe consensus revenue estimate is $62.99 billion, almost flat with $62.9 billion a year ago.\n\nOver the past four quarters, Apple has beaten EPS estimates by an average of 3.23%.\n\nFollowing a forecast-beating third quarter, when revenues broke a two-quarter streak of declines, Apple's shares added 2% after rising as much as 6.4% in intraday trading.\n\niPhone 11 Lineup Deemed A Success\n\nApple unveiled its iPhone 11 lineup, comprising the budget iPhone 11, the iPhone Pro and iPhone Pro Max, in late September, giving the fourth-quarter 10 days of sales for the newest iteration.\n\nStrong data points on the phone launch bode well for Apple, which suffered a backlash last year due to the lukewarm reception for the phone's 10th anniversary model.\n\niPhone is maintaining leading market share among customers of all four major U.S. wireless carriers, Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley said in a note, citing a survey conducted by the research firm.\n\nThe analyst expects fourth-quarter results to hit the top end of the guidance due to the stronger-than-anticipated initial sales.\n\nCanaccord estimates iPhone volume of 43 million for the quarter, higher than an earlier estimate of 41 million.\n\nView more earnings on AAPL\n\niPhone revenues, which accounted for roughly 48% of Apple's total revenue in the third quarter, fell about 12% year-over-year to $25.99 million.

The business accounted for 21.3% of third-quarter revenue.\n\nThe company could double its 2016 Services segment revenue by 2020, said Canaccord's Walkley said.\n\nConversely, KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Andy Hargreaves said the Services narrative is already priced into the stock.\n\nQ1 Expectations\n\nThe consensus expectations for the December quarter are upbeat, with the Street calling for EPS of $4.45 on revenue of $86.92 billion. This compares to the year-ago EPS of $4.18 and revenue of $84.3 billion.\n\nRelated Links:\n\nSpotify Reports Q3 Earnings Beat, Throws Some Shade at Apple And Amazon\n\nThe Bull And Bear Case For Apple TV+\n\nPhoto courtesy of Apple.\n\nSee more from Benzinga\n\n\u00a9 2019 Benzinga.com.
