I\u2019m excited for my next chapter in life whatever that may be.\u201d\n\nSam Burgess has announced his retirement from rugby league (Nigel French/PA)\n\nBurgess, who burst onto the scene as a teenager with Great Britain in 2007, was lured to the Rabbitohs by club owner and Hollywood actor Russell Crowe in 2010, arriving in Sydney on his 21st birthday, and immediately became a big hit.\n\nHe went on to make 182 appearances for Souths, was named International Player of the Year in 2014 and won his club\u2019s players\u2019 player of the year award five times.\n\n\ud83d\ude22 @SamBurgess8 has announced his retirement from Rugby League with immediate effect.\n\n\n\n\u2665\ufe0f Thanks for everything, Sam...#ThankYouSam pic.twitter.com/lTBg9gIAJ5 \u2014 England Rugby League (@England_RL) October 30, 2019\n\nBurgess, who played rugby union for his country at the 2015 World Cup during a brief spell with Bath, won 24 caps for England\u2019s league side in addition to making two appearances for Britain.\n\nCurrent Lions captain James Graham led the tributes, saying: \u201cHe\u2019s a huge loss for our competition in the NRL. Our game\u2019s going to be poorer for him not being there.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of the competition\u2019s biggest stars, there\u2019s no doubt about it. The biggest drawcard who puts bums on seats.\n\n\u201cWhen you go to the Magic Weekend, he\u2019s the player people want to see.\n\n\u201cHe was one of England\u2019s and Great Britain\u2019s greatest and one of the NRL\u2019s greatest players of a generation.\n\n\u201cObviously\u2019s he\u2019s an international superstar, but he\u2019s still a lad from Yorkshire that you can have a beer and a coffee with and a chat about life.\u201d\n\nGraham was the man involved in the first tackle of the 2014 Grand Final in which Burgess suffered a fractured eye socket and cheek bone but went on to play the full game and won the Clive Churchill Medal as man of the match.\n\nFormer England captain Jamie Peacock, who is the Great Britain team manager, said: \u201cThat performance was the most inspirational and courageous I\u2019ve ever seen by a rugby league player and I don\u2019t think it will be surpassed.\n\n\u201cTo fracture your cheekbone like that and go on to win the man of the match, in the biggest game of the year, is absolutely incredible, the best player I ever played alongside.\u201d\n\nBurgess was joined at the Redfern-based club by older brother Luke in 2011 and younger twin siblings George in 2012 and Tom the following year, and all four played together in a match in 2013.\n\nTom said: \u201cSam wants us not to feel sad, just celebrate what he has done and the good times we\u2019ve had together and that\u2019s what I\u2019ll be doing.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s made a decision for himself, for his body, and only he can do that. I\u2019m proud of him for having the strength and the will to do that.\u201d\n\nGreat Britain coach Wayne Bennett said: \u201cHe was one of the drawcards for me in coming to coach at South Sydney. His leadership and capabilities on the field match the man he is off it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to have played a small role in his career and I feel blessed that he has been part of mine.\u201d", "description": "The 30-year-old said: `The decision was out of my hands essentially.\u00b4", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/10/wire-20368456-1572430191-109_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
