(Patrick Semansky/Associated Press)\n\nThe Washington Nationals prepared to get blown out. They trailed the New York Mets by six in the sixth inning Wednesday and, despite the previous night\u2019s epic comeback, conceded it could stay that way. Aaron Barrett got up in the bullpen. The right-handed reliever had endured years of surgery and rehab to return to the majors , and he rejoined the Nationals on Wednesday morning. He would return in a low-leverage inning.\n\nBut then, as Max Scherzer once said, \u201cthings were happening.\u201d Gerardo Parra walked. Andrew Stevenson, too. Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera singled in a run, and Anthony Rendon doubled in two more to trim the deficit to three. The crowd perked up, Barrett sat down, and Wander Suero was roused.\n\nThen the magic bottle finally ran dry. Lefty specialist Luis Avil\u00e1n struck out Juan Soto. The Mets\u2019 best reliever, Seth Lugo, delivered two easy innings. Lefty Justin Wilson closed it out. The Nationals lost, 8-4, and dropped the series to finish their season slate against the Mets at 7-12. It\u2019s their second-worst mark against any team they have played five or more times, and neither Manager Dave Martinez nor his players could pin down why.\n\n\u201cWhatever it may be, they had our number,\u201d shortstop Trea Turner said.\n\nThe defeat sunk the Nationals seven games behind the National League East-leading Atlanta Braves, who had the day off before the Nationals arrive Thursday for a four-game set this weekend. The clubhouse admitted some frustration that, despite being the best team in baseball since late May, the Nationals remain so far behind. Martinez pointed out, \u201cat least we now get a chance to go head-to-head,\u201d but he stressed not changing the approach that got them here.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re making a mistake if we start saying: \u2018We have to win X out of X of these games to put ourselves in position,\u2019 \u201d closer Sean Doolittle said. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to go take it one game at a time. I know it sounds really cliche, but they\u2019re too good for us to take a big-picture approach.\u201d\n\nExcept that brief jolt in the sixth of, no way, they can\u2019t be doing this again, the hot and slow afternoon at Nationals Park felt sluggish as an encore to Tuesday\u2019s theatrics. It was just hours earlier that the Nationals mobbed home plate to complete the greatest comeback in the ninth inning or later in franchise history.\n\nThey had surrendered five runs in the ninth to trail 10-4, and they looked doomed: The Mets were 806-0 when leading by six or more runs in the ninth or later in franchise history and, when trailing in the same scenario, the Nationals were 0-775. But then the hits started and never stopped. Kurt Suzuki stepped to the plate and delivered the decisive blow, a walk-off, three-run, no-doubt home run. The clubhouse celebration got so rowdy afterward the manager good-naturedly told his players to go home; first pitch Wednesday was scheduled for 1:05.\n\n\u201cYesterday happened. It was a great feeling for us,\u201d Martinez said before Wednesday\u2019s game. \u201cBut we got to focus on today.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals had a chance to win the series, a significant fact considering their struggles against the Mets. Nationals Park felt as though it had momentum; in his first at-bat Wednesday, Suzuki received a scattered standing ovation. But the Nationals, for whatever reason, seemed intent on recreating Tuesday night\u2019s dire circumstances.\n\n[Box score: Mets 8, Nationals 4]\n\nStarter An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez cruised through the first two innings but, as the afternoon wore on, struggled to keep his pitches down in the zone. Hitters prey on the veteran right-hander when he goes upstairs, and the Mets capitalized in the third. Juan Lagares got a letters-high cutter that, even though he had only hit 22 home runs in 2,085 career plate appearances, he crushed beyond the deepest nook in center field.\n\nS\u00e1nchez tried to adjust his pitching during the game, to get the ball down, but he struggled to find a rhythm. He likes to tweak his approach during at-bats, but the Mets prevented him from doing so by staying aggressive and swinging at the first pitch.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t let you work on the count,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to make adjustments [in that case].\u201d\n\nThe 35-year-old looked lost in what became his worst outing of the season, and he departed in the sixth having faced three batters without getting one out. His line \u2014 five innings, seven earned runs \u2014 looked worse than it was because the defense hiccupped. Victor Robles\u2019s miscue on a line drive up the middle allowed the Mets\u2019 sixth run to score and put their seventh in scoring position.\n\nStill, S\u00e1nchez had fewer strikeouts (two) than home runs allowed (three). Martinez saw them as three mistakes and \u201cthat was it.\u201d He found no serious cause for concern moving forward. Robinson Can\u00f3 hit the second homer one inning after Lagares, but almost in the same location, and the two-run, opposite-field blast gave the Mets a lead they never gave up \u2014 despite efforts from their bullpen.\n\n\u201cWe had good at-bats. We hit the ball pretty hard,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cJust couldn\u2019t get that one timely hit.\u201d\n\nThe results didn\u2019t diminish the hope. The crowd remained almost the same size throughout the afternoon. Smaller plays \u2014 Robles\u2019s double in the seventh, Howie Kendrick\u2019s single in the eighth \u2014 drew relatively louder cheers. People wanted to believe.\n\nSuzuki came to the plate with two outs in the ninth, the man who capped Tuesday night\u2019s comeback carrying the hopes for another. He got buzzed on a pitch up and in that Martinez believed was \u201cvery unintentional.\u201d The catcher eventually walked, but the deficit was too much. Robles grounded into a fielder\u2019s choice.
