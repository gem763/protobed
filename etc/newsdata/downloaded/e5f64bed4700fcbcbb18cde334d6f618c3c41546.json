The location of most of the inhabitants is unknown.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Turkey launches offensive into Syria Show all 25 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

The trio have since been evacuated by Kurdish-led forces to Raqqa, when Ain Issa came under fire.\n\nBut Sonia Kush, Syria director of Save the Children argued that all British children should be brought home, whether they are with their parents or not. Until Monday's report, previous estimates put the total at just over 35 British children in northern Syria.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

It is important that they be seen as children and prioritised,\u201d she told The Independent.\n\n\u201cThe children should not be separated from their mothers which is an idea that is harder for governments to handle. But we have confidence in the judicial and legal process back home.\u201d\n\nAlison Griffin, Save the Children\u2019s director of Conflict and Humanitarian Campaigns, stressed that older children who lived under Isis likely witnessed appalling acts of brutality, including beheadings, and so were in need of urgent physiological care.\n\n\u201cTheir short lives have been full of violence and fear but with the right care they can bounce back, recover and amaze us. They deserve that chance, no matter what they\u2019ve been dragged into by the decisions of adults,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe camps with the majority of foreign women and children have not yet been reached by fighting and remain under the control of the Kurdish authorities. The time to act is now,\u201d she added.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan launched a controversial offensive to repeal Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces and create a 30km-deep buffer zone along its border.\n\nAfter President Donald Trump announced the withdrawal of US troops, who had been fighting alongside Kurdish forces against Isis, the SDF struck a deal with the Assad regime to defend the border.\n\nFighting continues in some areas, despite a US-brokered temporary ceasefire, which is due to expire on Tuesday.\n\nSave the Children warned the potential administrative take-over of the Syrian regime would likely halt access international rights groups have to the camps as the NGOs are not registered with the Syrian regime.\n\nIt would also likely complicate the repatriation process, as it would mean the UK government would have to directly negotiate with Damascus rather than the Kurds.\n\nThere are also concerns that British children have gone missing in northern Syria as the frontline has moved.\n\nWhen the inhabitants of Ain Issa fled, among them were at least two British women and their children: Tooba Gondal, from east London who joined Isis in Syria and worked to recruit others to follow her, and Zara Iqbal, also from east London.\n\nThe pair are now believed to be in a camp run by Turkish-backed Syrian forces, after they were captured while escaping shelling.\n\nThe location of the rest of the camp\u2019s inhabitants is unknown.\n\nKurdish doctors who run clinics in the camps said countries like the UK were running out of time, as the camps were becoming more volatile.\n\nAid workers in Al-Hol camp, home to some 70,000 people, including 11,000 foreigners affiliated with Isis, told The Independent that dozens of families have attempted to break free from the camp at least five times over the last few days.\n\nSimilar concerns were raised about Roj camp, which is home to 950 foreigners including Shamima Begum, who was part of the \u201cBethnal Green trio\u201d of girls who joined Isis.\n\n\u201cFrom the outset, we have asked all countries to receive their nationals who are affiliated with Isis but unfortunately this has been repeatedly ignored by most countries and only heeded by a few,\u201d said Dr Ahmed Sheikhmus, Kurdish Red Crescent coordinator in Roj.\n\n\u201cWe have no objection to handing foreign nationals to their governments, now is the time,\" he added.\n\nWe have no objection to handing foreign nationals to their governments, now is the time Dr Ahmed Sheikhmus, medical coordinator Roj camp for the displaced\n\n\u201cIn relation to unaccompanied minors or orphans, assuming that they would represent no security threa t\u2026 We would be willing to see them returned home if that can be done in a safe way given the situation on the ground,\u201d he said.\n\nSave the Children\u2019s team, meanwhile, said they spoke to one British mother with two young children \u2013 a baby and an under-five \u2013 in one of the camps who said there were 15 British citizens there.\n\nThe mother said she and her family made a traumatic escape from \u2018hell\u2019 in Baghouz and along with her children and sister, they ended up sleeping in the open desert as they fled. Her youngest baby nearly died from bronchiolitis when they arrived at the camp earlier this year.\n\n\u201cShe accepted that she would face investigation in the UK but said she felt that in Syria no one would ever hear her case,\u201d the group wrote.\n\n\u201cShe told us that she was scared to be in the camps and very afraid of what would happen to her children.\"", "description": "At least\u00a0 60 British children who fled Isis-held\u00a0areas are trapped in\u00a0northern Syria,\u00a0Save the Children has revealed,\u00a0adding that the\u00a0number is double previous estimates.
