Or losing the same job because she needed more graduate courses, depending on whichever interview you choose to believe.\n\nUnable to defend herself, Warren took to Twitter to tell the stories of countless other women who have experienced pregnancy discrimination but whose names are also not Elizabeth Warren.\n\nIn her Twitter video, Warren says \u201cso I get out and on the campaign trail, I tell my story. And I\u2019ve asked other people to tell their stories as well. I think that\u2019s a good way to fight back.\u201d\n\nTo fight back? Against the truth?\n\nWarren then goes on to read various \u201cstories\u201d from her iPhone that were submitted by other people, including one from \"Sarah.\"\n\n\u201cMy mom was demoted and then fired from her job when she was pregnant with my sis and me (we\u2019re twins),\u201d Sarah said. \u201cShe re-told us that story recently and let me tell you, 30+ years later, the pain and anger from that experience was still very raw and real. Women don\u2019t share this stuff willy nilly.\u201d\n\nWarren then adds, \u201cso true, Sarah.\u201d\n\nSo true? First of all, Warren agrees that women \u201cdon\u2019t share this stuff willy nilly,\u201d but she shared her folktale countless times on the campaign trail. And by adding a \u201cyup\u201d and \u201cso true\u201d after every woman\u2019s story, Warren is attempting to appropriate their victimhood. But what should we expect from a woman who appropriated Native American ancestry?\n\nThe best story Warren reads appears to come from someone using the name Summer. Warren is seemingly being trolled and is completely unaware of it:\n\nOh, here\u2019s one from Summer. My dudes, women are STILL fired or not hired at all basically just for looking like they might one day soon want to become pregnant. Someone at the UN once told me TO MY FACE this was why I didn\u2019t get a job. I was then single, and ten years later still have no kids.\u201d\n\nWarren then quips, \u201cI got it, Summer.\u201d\n\nYou can\u2019t make this stuff up. Only Elizabeth Warren can.\n\nYou have to see the full video:", "description": "Elizabeth Warren was caught telling another folktale, this time about losing a job because she was pregnant. .10/09/2019 18:08:57PM EST.", "authors": ["Bronson Stocking", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/151/9d0a40ae-5b68-463a-a49a-40c3aa9d99ed.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
