But when the party retook the House in November and Nancy Pelosi began her historic second term as speaker, no one doubted the search was over. She\u2019d been a GOP target and, some centrists thought, an electoral liability given her San Francisco roots. But now no one doubted that she was the indispensable Democrat, cheerfully jousting with AOC and \u201cthe Squad,\u201d mediating the hoary conflict between the party\u2019s left and its center (she describes herself as \u201ca weaver,\u201d which is a nice word for how she sometimes has to operate), winning with substance (her party\u2019s focus on health care) and imagery (the famous Max Mara red coat, the donning of the sunglasses after her triumphant border wall meeting with Trump and Senator Chuck Schumer), and holding fire on impeachment until precisely the right moment. The Speaker talks to Abigail Tracy about the road to impeachment, how the Democrats won in 2018, why Trump is unique among presidents she\u2019s known, and the work to be done after Trump is gone.\n\nTell me about the moment you reached the decision to go down the impeachment path.\n\nI take a lot of guidance from the vision of our founders, and our founders fought very hard for our democracy, for our country, for our Constitution. In the dark days of revolution, Thomas Paine said, \u201cThe times have found us.\u201d We believe that the times have found us to keep the republic from all enemies, foreign and domestic. And that would be those who say things like, \u201cArticle II says I can do whatever I want.\u201d That\u2019s not a republic, that\u2019s a monarchy. That\u2019s not what we have.\n\nJuly 24, 1:07 p.m.\n\nPelosi with security detail and aides on her way to drop by the New Democrat Coalition lunch. Photograph by Annie Leibovitz.\n\nDo you think President Trump understands why people think what he said in his call with the Ukrainian president was wrong?\n\nI don\u2019t know what he understands. But if he understands that Article II lets him do whatever he wants, then it\u2019s a big misunderstanding.\n\nHow did your experience as a legislator during the Bill Clinton impeachment shape your view?\n\nThe Clinton impeachment was totally, totally wrong for our country. The president, of course, was personally wrong to do what he did. But that\u2019s not an impeachable offense. I was very concerned at the time\u2014because I do take impeachment seriously\u2014that the Republicans were using it very frivolously and were disrespectful to the Constitution.", "description": "\u201cThe president admitted it to me on the phone without even any embarrassment.\u201d Nancy Pelosi, super Speaker, on Trump\u2019s unfitness, the decision to impeach, and \u201cweaving\u201d her fractious caucus.", "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Abigail Tracy", "Annie Leibovit", "Kenzie Bryant", "Yohana Desta", "Julie Miller"], "top_image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5d9de9630fa2040008f28446/16:9/w_2560,c_limit/201912-pelosi-TOUT.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
