Public prosecutors accuse him of forgery in an alleged faked arbitration case involving several others. He has denied wrongdoing and said the case is \"politically motivated\" by rivals in Kuwait.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
