While theft of the emission-controlling devices is a nationwide problem, it is particularly acute in London and south-east England. One Lexus dealership alone in the capital told the Guardian it had 500 on order, although it is not expecting to receive them until December.\n\nThere were 2,900 catalytic converter thefts reported in the first six months of this year, compared with just under 1,700 in the whole of last year, according to Metropolitan police figures provided to the Guardian.\n\nPalmers Green Police (@MPSPalmersGreen) 2/2 Thurs 5th a Toyota Prius on Davey Close had it catalytic converter taken.\n\n\n\nOn Ulster Gardens, 3-4am on Thurs 12th a black Toyota, reg WU18KZR was taken by relay attack.

Rhodium is trading at double its price at the start of the year and more than eight times its 2016 value.\n\nAs well as hybrids having higher amounts of precious metals, their catalytic converters tend to be in better condition because they are not used when the vehicles run on electricity.\n\nIn response to inquiries on its website, a Toyota UK customer services agent wrote on Wednesday: \u201cWe have seen a 2,000% rise in demand for parts due to the recent crime wave for catalytic converters in certain areas of the UK. We, and our supply chain, are unable to keep up with demand for this essential part.\u201d\n\nThe website says some Prius and Auris hybrid models \u201chave been a particular target\u201d.\n\nCustomers have posted about the difficulties in replacing the part, with some complaining there was insufficient warning about the risk of theft.\n\nRobW wrote on Monday: \u201cIt\u2019s been six weeks now without my car since the cat on my Auris Hybrid was stolen \u2013 just 10 miles from the Derby factory. The car is at the Toyota dealer and they have no ETA [estimated time of arrival] on when the part will be available to fit. They have three other cars with the same problem.\u201d\n\nAnother driver said their insurance company had told them it could be three months to source a replacement, while one said a garage in Yeovil had been unable to tell them when it would be available.\n\nIn many instances thieves have operated in broad daylight, with some instances caught on camera.\n\nLincolnshire Police (@lincspolice) We would like to speak with these men in connection with a theft from a car. On August 8th three male suspects approached a parked car in St Paul\u2019s Car Park, St Paul\u2019s Lane, Lincoln, and made off with the exhaust and catalytic converter. Call 101. https://t.co/1huqsvoCAH pic.twitter.com/nyVmwsq3GR\n\nIronically, the increase in cost of the metals has been driven by their use in catalytic converters, with the automotive industry accounting for about 85% of demand for rhodium and palladium.\n\nJames Clark, senior press relations manager at Toyota UK, said such thefts were not limited to the company\u2019s products, but added: \u201cThe recent rise in the value of such parts for recycling has meant that police forces have seen a very significant rise in these offences in the last few months.\n\n\u201cThis sudden rise is one we could not have envisaged set against many years of low incidents of theft. This has impacted our ability to source enough of the parts we need in some cases, for which we sincerely apologise; but we are taking urgent action to address this with our suppliers.\u2019\n\nHe said the company had posted guidance online for customers and sought to contact them, in some cases through dealers. It has also introduced a \u201ccatloc\u201d device, to help defer theft, at a reduced price, sought to minimise the cost of replacement and its French supplier has increased production.", "description": "Toyota has seen a 2,000% rise in demand for parts for models that contain precious metals", "authors": ["Haroon Siddique"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc7e7f9172529616681478adb9d96c45968d9bbe/0_0_4045_2427/master/4045.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c47c24b2e64f3291d593c0a3fd0d2b7e", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
