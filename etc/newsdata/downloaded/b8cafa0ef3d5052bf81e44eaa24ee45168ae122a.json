But the investigation had been dropped by that time, and the European Union and many American allies backed the dismissal of Shokin, who was widely viewed as corrupt.\n\nSo although the allegation about Joe Biden has been widely discredited, Republican allies of the president who as a candidate vowed to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d of Washington influence peddling have a fallback issue to pursue: Why was Hunter Biden, who had no evident experience in either Ukraine or the energy business, appointed to the board of directors (for a reported salary of up to $50,000 a month) of a natural gas company in Kiev?\n\nHunter Biden (Photo illustration: Yahoo News; photos: Teresa Kroeger/Getty Images, AP) More\n\nThe Trump talking point, which appears to have originated with his lawyer and adviser Rudy Giuliani \u2014 that Biden intervened in this case to protect his son\u2019s business interests \u2014 has become gospel for many Republicans, as was illustrated in a Sunday exchange between CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper and one of Trump\u2019s most outspoken defenders, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio.\n\nJordan: \u201cWhen they see the vice president\u2019s son getting paid $50,000 a month in a field, in an industry he has no experience in ... and then when the company that\u2019s paying that money is under investigation, guess what? Daddy comes running to the rescue. The vice president of the United States comes running in and says, \u2018Fire that prosecutor.\u2019\u201d\n\nTapper: \u201cThat's not what happened. Sir, sir, that\u2019s not what happened. The European Union, the Obama administration, the International Monetary Fund, pro-clean-government activists in Ukraine, [all] thought that the prosecutor was not prosecuting corruption.\u201d\n\nJordan: \u201cSo you\u2019re saying Joe Biden didn\u2019t tell Ukraine to fire that prosecutor? I think he did.\u201d\n\nTapper: \u201cHe did, but the guy was not prosecuting anything. That was the problem.\u201d\n\nJordan: \u201cHere are the facts \u2014\u201d\n\nTapper: \u201cYou\u2019re not saying facts. You say, \u2018Here are the facts,\u2019 these are not.\u201d\n\nJordan: \u201cDid Joe Biden tell him to fire the prosecutor?\u201d\n\nTapper: \u201cBecause he wasn\u2019t going after corruption. He wasn\u2019t going after corruption. Do you understand what I\u2019m saying?\u201d\n\nWhile a version of that real-time fact checking played out on other Sunday morning shows this weekend regarding Shokin\u2019s firing, an unavoidable \u2014 if tangential \u2014 question still remains: Was Hunter Biden in effect trading on his father\u2019s name in winning the lucrative directorship?\n\n\u201cI have had no role whatsoever in relation to any investigation of Burisma, or any of its officers,\u201d Hunter Biden said in a statement to the New York Times in May when asked about Shokin. \u201cI explicitly limited my role to focus on corporate governance best practices to facilitate Burisma\u2019s desire to expand globally.\u201d\n\nWhile the younger Biden is a lawyer who had served on the board of directors at Amtrak as well as a number of nonprofit organizations, worked at the Commerce Department during the Clinton administration and was a Washington lobbyist for various universities and U.S. companies, he had no real experience in Ukraine before he joined Burisma Holdings.\n\nTrump has made even more outlandish claims about another of Hunter Biden\u2019s business ventures, a 2013 deal with a Chinese private equity fund, BHR Partners. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff \u201cdoesn\u2019t talk about Joe Biden and his son walking away with millions of dollars from Ukraine and then millions of dollars from China. Walking away, in a quick meeting, walking away with millions of dollars,\u201d Trump said in a press conference last week. There is no evidence that Joe Biden made any money at all from the deal, and Trump has thrown around the figure of $1.5 billion, the amount BHR supposedly raised for investments abroad, in a way that implied Hunter Biden personally profited by that amount.", "description": "The former vice president's son sat on the board of directors of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma Holdings.
