REUTERS/Yves Herman/File Photo\n\nThe European Commission is now racing to wrap up the two-year investigation into the brand owner of IKEA, known for giant out-of-town budget furniture stores, but the timing may still slip as it weighs the scope of the case, the people said.\n\nThe EU executive declined to comment.\n\nLaunched in 2017, the EU\u2019s investigation focuses on Inter IKEA Systems in the Netherlands, which operates IKEA\u2019s franchise business and records all revenue from its franchise fees worldwide collected from IKEA shops.\n\nThe Commission said at the time its investigation was triggered by a 2016 report from European Parliament green lawmakers which estimated that IKEA avoided 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) in taxes over the course of six years.\n\nInter IKEA said in an emailed comment on Monday: \u201cJust like all other companies working under the IKEA trademark, Inter IKEA Systems B.V. is committed to paying taxes in accordance with laws and regulations wherever we operate. We believe that we also in these cases have paid the correct amount of tax.\u201d\n\nThe spotlight is on two tax rulings granted by the Dutch tax authorities in 2006 and 2011, which the European Commission said have significantly reduced Inter IKEA Systems\u2019 taxable profits in the Netherlands and given it an unfair advantage.\n\nThe EU competition enforcer said the first tax ruling, which covered 2006 to 2011, resulted in a significant part of Inter IKEA Systems\u2019 franchise profits shifting to a Luxembourg unit where it was not taxed.\n\nA 2011 ruling allowed a substantial part of the company\u2019s franchise profits after 2011 to be transferred to its Liechtenstein parent.\n\nThe EU order comes after Europe\u2019s second-highest court last month backed the EU executive\u2019s methodology in its cases against Fiat and Starbucks.", "description": "IKEA brand owner Inter IKEA could be ordered to pay millions of euros in Dutch back taxes by the end of the year, two people familiar with the matter said, as EU competition enforcers push on with their crackdown against unfair tax deals granted to multinationals.", "authors": ["Foo Yun Chee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1437993142&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF960ER", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
