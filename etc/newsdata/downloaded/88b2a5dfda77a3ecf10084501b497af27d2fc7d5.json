In other words, Morey\u2019s tweet put the entire NBA and all of its players\u2019 lucrative relationships with China in the crosshairs.\n\nLike many other American businesses, the NBA has staked much of its future on China, a market that has 300 million people playing basketball. Several NBA players have signed healthy endorsement deals with Chinese companies or, like James, have made regular visits to China, as they continue to capitalize on a Chinese market that is thirsty for American basketball. All of that was nearly compromised with one tweet.\n\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d James continued, \u201cyou have to think through things that you say that may cause harm not only for yourself but for the majority of people.\u201d\n\nAs someone who has been critical of his own government, James is the last person who should ever give the impression that he favors the suppression of any viewpoint\u2014even one that is proving to be as costly and uncomfortable as Morey\u2019s has been for the NBA. Freedom of speech isn\u2019t something that should be protected only on a case-by-case basis. It becomes a slippery slope for some people\u2014including James\u2014when it actually requires some sacrifice.\n\nStill, expecting James and other NBA players to solve a tense political crisis between China and the league is unfair, and outside of their responsibilities. Inevitably, strengthening the league\u2019s relationship with a repressive country was going to involve some pitfalls. Even though James, more than any other player, is the face of the NBA, he doesn\u2019t have to be an authority on China\u2013Hong Kong relations. Nobody should be surprised if he\u2019s more vocal about issues he\u2019s lived with in America than about those in China.\n\nIn 2017, James called Trump a \u201cbum\u201d in a tweet, which became the most retweeted tweet by an athlete that year. James was coming to the rescue of his colleague Stephen Curry, the Warriors guard whom Trump attacked after Curry admitted that he had no interest in making the traditional visit to the White House to celebrate the Warriors\u2019 NBA championship.\n\nThat was just one of many times James went after Trump, who finally fired back at James by insulting his intelligence. While conservatives excoriated James for his criticisms, the former league MVP didn\u2019t lose a single dollar over what he said about the president. The NBA may have gained a few more detractors, but it was largely business as usual, and it certainly didn\u2019t put the league in the middle of a crisis.\n\nBut what if James\u2019s takedowns of Trump had resulted in a more costly backlash? What if the league, other players, and James himself had lost sponsorships and endorsements? Would he have apologized or backpedaled?", "description": "James didn\u2019t defend free speech.
