Daughter Tracey Kerwin released the shocking picture of her mother being carried up the stairs in a bid to prompt officers to take action.\n\nJanet has lived in the property in Dunfermline for more than 40 years, but hasn't been able to manage the stairs for the last two years.\n\nHer grandson has now have to move in with her in order to carry her up and down the steep stairs and prevent her being completely housebound.\n\n(Image: CASCADE NEWS)\n\nTracey told The Daily Record : \"It's utterly heartbreaking to see my mum having to go through this.\n\n\"She no longer has the strength in her legs to climb the 16 steps up to her home.\n\n\"This has made her a prisoner in her own home.\n\n\"Until my son moved into the property to help her get up and down the stairs and care for her, there have been times when she has been unable to leave home for three or four weeks at a time.\n\n\"Her lack of mobility means she is no longer able to have a shower, which she is finding particularly upsetting.\"\n\nTracey said they had been offered a ground-floor flat in the Townhill area but the bathroom was unsuitable.\n\nShe added: \"This has been going on too long and the mental strength is beginning to take its toll.\n\n\"Mum is so distraught and fears she will die before being found a new home.\n\n\"That's why posting up the picture was the last resort.\"\n\nFife Council housing officers told Tracey there are more than 2,100 people waiting for a council property in the Dunfermline, Cowdenbeath and Crossgates area. The local authority housing stock amounts to just 212.\n\nAlison Mitchell, lead housing access and advice officer, said: \"We took Mrs Fotheringham to view a vacant property, but an on-site assessment found that she would still have problems independently accessing that home.\n\n\"The bathroom facilities were also unsuitable for her.\n\n\"Finding the right housing for Mrs Fotheringham has taken longer than we would have liked because of the accommodation the family are requesting.\n\n\"Ground floor, two bedroom properties are in high demand in their area of choice.\n\n\"We will continue to work with the family to find suitable accommodation.\"", "description": "Janet Fotheringham has to be carried up and down two flights of stairs at her home in Dunfermline and fears she will die before Fife Council finds her a new home", "authors": ["Cath Ashcroft", "Image", "Cascade News"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20728347.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Cascade_janet_Fotheringham_stairs01.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
