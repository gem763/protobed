Conservative constituents branded him a traitor: \u201cI\u2019m Brutus, and Trump\u2019s Julius Caesar,\u201d he said. In short order, he was forced to explain himself to the Trump campaign\u2019s political director, top House Republicans and the acting White House chief of staff. All had the same question: \u201cWhat the heck are you doing?\u201d\n\nAs evidence mounts that Mr. Trump engaged in an intensive effort to pressure the leader of Ukraine to investigate a political rival, Mr. Amodei is one of a growing number of Republicans who, while not explicitly endorsing the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry, are at least indicating an openness to it. None have said Mr. Trump should be impeached. But neither are they defending him.\n\nIt is a politically delicate but increasingly common approach among independent-minded lawmakers like Mr. Amodei, who are working to balance their fear of inviting Mr. Trump\u2019s wrath \u2014 and that of the party base \u2014 with a deep anxiety that there is more to be revealed about the president, some of it potentially indefensible, and the knowledge that history will hold them accountable for their words and actions.", "description": "Republicans like Representative Mark Amodei of Nevada balancing the risk of President Trump\u2019s wrath and the knowledge that history will hold them accountable for their actions.", "authors": ["Sheryl Gay Stolberg"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/04/us/politics/00dc-repubs-promo/00dc-repubs-promo-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
