More and more high streets are dying A broken rental market, sky-high business rates, council parking charges and a shift to online shopping are devastating bricks-and-mortar businesses. Big names such as House of Fraser, Marks & Spencer, Prezzo and Jamie\u2019s Italian shut 2,868 outlets in the first six months of the year \u2013 110 a week. The closure rate is the highest since the Local Data Company and PwC started the survey in 2010. Store openings resulted in a net decline of 1,234.\n\nRetailers who have a centre's larger units, with higher rents, pay higher services charges - although there is usually a significant discount for a shopping centre's 'anchor' stores of which John Lewis is invariably one.\n\nThe decision to withhold 20 per cent of service charges from - reportedly - 20 or so landlords of the chain's most-expensive units through retail's critical October/November/December quarter was done 'without consultation' with landlords, the BBC reported.\n\nIn a statement John Lewis said: 'At a time when we are doing everything we can to reduce our cost base, we have unfortunately been faced with regular increases to the service charges we pay for some of our shops in shopping centres.\n\n'Over the last three years we have seen an increase in service charges of 20% and these continued increases are simply not acceptable, particularly in the absence of strenuous efforts by landlords to work collaboratively with us to reduce these costs.\n\n'We are investing more in our current shop estate than ever before to do everything we can to encourage customers to grow footfall to our shops and we hope that our landlords will support us in continuing to do this.'\n\nOne property owner told the corporation: 'John Lewis is in a much better place than most of its rivals but its revenues are under enormous pressure right now.\n\n'What they're up to, I think, is trying to open up a broader conversation about property costs more generally.\n\n'The market is distorted right now. The stronger retailers are pretty concerned about this uneven playing field.'\n\nJohn Lewis said it had taken the decision to withhold 20% of its service charges from some landlords this Christmas after being hit with increases of 20% and try - and failing - to get landlord to work with them to reduce communal costs\n\nWell-managed, securely-financed John Lewis is still paying full rents across its portfolio.\n\nWhereas Debenhams, which has been pulled out of administration, slashed its rent bill by up to 50 per cent after securing a restructuring deal with creditors.\n\nAnd after House of Fraser was bought out of administration by Mike Ashley most of its stores are currently paying little or no rent unde rthe terms of the rescue.\n\nNonetheless service charges are contractually agreed and one landlord said: 'Every landlord will be looking at their lease, talking to lawyers who will get revved up to recover this money as a debt.'\n\n'I am astounded to hear this from a company which sets the gold standard in retail,' one property expert told the BBC.\n\n'There's nothing new in retailers trying to challenge the specifics of a service charge. But to seek to withhold money like this is in breach of a contract.\n\n'This is going to go down like a lead balloon.'\n\nRob Collins, managing director of the Waitrose business, will leave at the end of January\n\nIt comes after the Partnership announced the the boss of its Waitrose chain would leave, and around 75 head office roles would be axed, under plans to bring its department stores and supermarket under the same management team.\n\nRob Collins, managing director of the Waitrose business, will leave at the end of January after a 26-year career with the group following its decision to scrap separate management teams for its two divisions.\n\nThe overhaul means it will cut around 75 of its 225 senior management head office roles as part of moves that will save it around \u00a3100 million 'over time'.\n\nBut John Lewis managing director Paula Nickolds will remain with the group, taking on the newly created role of executive director for brand from next year.\n\nSir Charlie Mayfield, outgoing chairman of John Lewis, said the group needed to take 'bolder steps' to turn around its fortunes in a difficult retail market.\n\nHe said: 'Although there will be little or no disruption to our shops or websites in the near term, there will be considerable change in many other areas of the partnership as we bring the two businesses much closer together.\n\n'These are necessary and these changes will be difficult for some of our partners and we will implement as carefully and sensitively as we can.'\n\nThe partnership slid \u00a325.9million into the red in the year to July 17, down from a profit of \u00a31million in the same period last year.
