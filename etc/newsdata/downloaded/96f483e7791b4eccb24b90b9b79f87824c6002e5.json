So I ended up going on the assault course and went round and round on my hands and knees like geriatric I am.\n\n'There were some kids who bashed into Hollie and so I said, ''Excuse me, you can't do that on this'' while looking around for their parents.\n\n'Hollie was upset, so I raised my voice to these little gits. Hollie swam off, so I had to follow her, and there were these three stepping stones that I crawled over.'\n\nSharing the moment she broke her leg, the TV star added: 'I ran on them really quick, made it, and then I got to the inflatable platform, but fell and twisted my leg back on itself, and fell back into the sea.\n\n'I'd never broken anything in my life, it felt like a shift. I've pulled tendons before so it felt like that but a bit worse. In the leg, I felt sick. I swam back one-legged while swearing and trying to wave at Chris.'\n\nAmanda insisted she has experienced worse things in life, explaining: 'I had to be put under a general [anaesthetic]... They've put a metal plate [into my leg] which is the best way to heal it because I'm very impatient.\n\n'There's a cast which they molded just under my leg, so I can lift my leg in and out of it, so it's hard underneath but soft on the top. I'm in full glam and a lash, things aren't that bad! I feel like a one-legged dog.'", "description": "Amanda Holden showed she was bouncing back from her horror injury as she struck a playful pose in the\u00a0 Heart Radio Studios on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Eve Buckland For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/10/20370210-0-image-a-107_1572432748507.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
