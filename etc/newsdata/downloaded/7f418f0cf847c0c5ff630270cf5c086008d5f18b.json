(Picture: WireImage/Getty Images)\n\nJames Bond star Susie Venner has revealed that Idris Elba \u2018could work\u2019 as the next actor to take on the role of the spy.\n\nThe actress starred as a Russian agent in The Spy Who Loved Me, the 10th installment in the James Bond franchise, and is well known for her romantic encounter with the late Roger Moore\u2019s Bond, with the two sharing a passionate scene together.\n\nNow, Susie has revealed that she thinks Idris is \u2018strong and beautiful\u2019, and he could be an ideal candidate for the role of 007, following the end of current actor Daniel Craig\u2019s tenure.\n\nSpeaking at the launch of the London Cabaret Club\u2019s Bond-themed London Never Dies event, she said: \u2018Maybe, that could work. But it\u2019s still got to stay traditionally British.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s very strong and he\u2019s beautiful, so that could work.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd when asked if she still watches the previous Bond films, and if she intends on watching the next installment, No Time To Die, she replied: \u2018Yes I will and I do. I\u2019ve watched every single James Bond.\u2019\n\nHowever, Susie is opposed to a woman taking over the role, believing that it would \u2018change the whole storyline\u2019 from the original book series by Ian Fleming.\n\n\u2018There are amazing actresses around that could play a strong role like 007, for instance Jodie Comer is fantastic,\u2019 she continued.\n\nSusie starred alongside the late Roger Moore in the James Bond classic The Spy Who Loved Me (Picture: Twentieth Century Fox)\n\n\u2018But I really don\u2019t think I want James Bond movies changed to that degree. It\u2019s changing the whole storyline that Ian Fleming wrote and I love the tradition and history of it all, it means so much, the storylines and characters reflect the time of when it was written.\u2019\n\nIn the meantime, it has been announced that the next James Bond movie, No Time To Die, will receive a slightly earlier release than originally planned, after being pushed forward from 3 April to 2 April 2020.\n\nThe movie is set to be the 25th in the franchise and Daniel Craig\u2019s final role as the titular character.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo Time To Die will be released in cinemas on 2 April 2020.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
