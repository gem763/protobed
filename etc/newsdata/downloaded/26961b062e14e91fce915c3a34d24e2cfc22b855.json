She\u2019s certainly been less than kind to conservatives, and that dead-eyed photo of her holding up a bloody facsimile of the president\u2019s disembodied head, Taliban-style, wasn\u2019t something his son needed to see.\n\nSo we really thought we had reached the end of the world \u2014 the bottom of the pit, at least \u2014 when Griffin announced that she was holding a press conference about the whole thing \u2026 with attorney Lisa Bloom, daughter of Gloria Allred. The press conference, held back in June 2017, was a disaster, but for some reason, Griffin is throwing Bloom under the bus Monday and saying she hadn\u2019t even seen the \u201cglamor shots\u201d that had been tweeted out.\n\nWho\u2019s worse? You decide:\n\nA) @LisaBloom suggested holding a press conference a couple days after the Trump photo scandal upended my life. As you can see, it turned out to be an infomercial for her firm in her office. I didn't know she had tweeted out this memo with glamour shots the night before. pic.twitter.com/mcGJayE6bp \u2014 Kathy Griffin (@kathygriffin) September 9, 2019\n\nB) I have never called for a press conference in my life and trusted her. Do I look safe in the photo? It\u2019s my understanding she didn\u2019t vett anyone in attendance. Her office just sent out a mass email. I expected a small group of reporters from major outlets like the LA Times pic.twitter.com/MQlNC3O2qS \u2014 Kathy Griffin (@kathygriffin) September 9, 2019\n\nC) While the LA Times was there, conservative trolls from random blogs also showed up and harassed me.She also invited press outlets like ET and and privately did interviews with them in the hallway without me. I was in her office with her husband who held the door closed. \u2014 Kathy Griffin (@kathygriffin) September 9, 2019\n\nD) @LisaBloom charged me $40,000 for representation and advocacy\ud83d\ude44 I got a terrible press conference that did nothing but damage me. She never apologized for her conduct and unprofessionalism. When I asked for my money back, she refused. \u2014 Kathy Griffin (@kathygriffin) September 9, 2019\n\nIt was a train wreck.\n\nE) Here\u2019s @lisabloom on the day she resigned as Harvey Weinstein\u2019s attorney. Lisa, I tried that therapy, turns out it didn\u2019t stop two federal agencies from investigating me and considering charging me with the crime of conspiracy to assassinate the President of the United States pic.twitter.com/uGLJeyDL3A \u2014 Kathy Griffin (@kathygriffin) September 9, 2019\n\nNo one cares \u2014 BetseyCarolinaGirl (@GirlBetsey) September 9, 2019\n\nThoughts and prayers. \u2014 Jeni Peni (@peni_jeni) September 9, 2019\n\nSerious question, what about her resume made you want to hire her? \u2014 K Sabrena (@KSabrena_) September 9, 2019\n\nThat is a very good question.\n\nLike mother like daughter! Why anyone would trust either of them is beyond me! \u2014 sandy (@sgalicastro) September 9, 2019\n\nThis \u201ccomedian\u201d is still desperately clinging to whatever tiny amount of relevance she once had. \u2014 RandomAsshole (@smarterdanyou) September 9, 2019\n\nMuch like that photo, I suspect this tweet isn't working out quite like you expected. \u2014 extrashaky (@extrashaky) September 9, 2019\n\nPress conferences suck when the press that shows up asks actual questions and aren\u2019t there to kow-tow. \u2014 @charliefromnyc \ud83e\udd95 (@CharliefromNYC) September 9, 2019\n\nNoooooo sympathy. \u2014 Kayyyy (@MidmodArtist) September 9, 2019\n\nYour career had already been upended.

I have this full dumpster I've been trying to set on fire for months, to no avail.
