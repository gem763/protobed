Jerry McNerney called the \u201csecretive and capricious nature\u201d of the waivers that largely keep recipients a secret due to business confidentiality concerns.\n\nThe waiver program is meant to benefit small refineries who argue that blending in ethanol would cause a hardship. But Democrats have targeted the program since it was revealed that some of those refineries were owned by major oil companies.\n\nRep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) said the waivers show \u201cTrump and his cronies get theirs and ordinary Americans get hurt.\u201d\n\nIndeed, ethanol producers have argued they have had to close plants and lay off workers due to a decline in ethanol demand. Their backlash resulted in a new proposal from the EPA designed to allays their concerns and promise to force other oil refineries to blend in the gallons small refineries were exempted from adding.\n\nBut when more details about the plans were released, farm groups said there had been a bait and switch. The EPA would require larger refineries to add more ethanol based on government projections rather than the actual amount of gallons exempted.\n\nRefiners were likewise opposed to the plan.\n\n\u201cWhile the granting of widespread small refinery exemptions should not be occurring in the first place, there is simply no logic in forcing complying refineries to bear the burden of decisions outside of their control,\u201d Frank Macchiarola, vice president of downstream and industry operations at the American Petroleum Institute, said at the time.\n\nOn Tuesday, Chet Thompson, president and CEO of the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, said the waiver process should remain confidential, adding, \u201cWe\u2019re not anti-ethanol, we\u2019re anti-mandate.\u201d", "description": "Lawmakers are looking for a solution to fix the nation\u2019s ethanol program after proposals from the Trump administration have repeatedly irked both corn farmers and gasoline producers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/ethanol_05242019_2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
