Coyote \u2013 Super Genius", "language": "en", "text": "The opinions expressed by columnists are their own and do not represent the views of Townhall.com.\n\nIf you are a member of Generation X or older, you undoubtedly remember the Warner Brothers cartoons featuring a hapless coyote, chasing a road runner who always outpaces him.\n\nToday, we\u2019re seeing this scenario play out in real life, in the endless and absurd pursuit of President Trump by the Democrats and their dedicated supporters in the media.\n\nThis comparison goes far beyond casual observation.\n\nIn these cartoons, the methods the coyote uses in his attempts to catch the road runner become more and more ridiculous, to the point where it is no longer clear how the scheme will even advance the ultimate goal of catching the road runner.\n\nIn the same way, Democrats and their allies in media continually raise the bar, never pausing to consider the appearance of their approach.\n\nEvery time they think they can finally \u2018get\u2019 Trump, they end up at the bottom of a canyon with a massive boulder directly overhead, finally emerging from the rubble with piano keys for teeth.\n\nThis was best exemplified in the 1958 short \u201cWhoa, Be-Gone!\u201d in which Wile E. Coyote donned a helmet with a pulley on top which he was going to somehow ride down a clifftop wire, upside-down.\n\nThe bit features the coyote carefully balancing himself on the wire, to the sound of a dramatic drumroll. Yet the moment he believes he has balanced himself and is ready to descend, the wire beneath his head snaps with a loud twang, and he plummets to the ground below.\n\nThis scenario, while hilarious, begs an obvious question. How did the coyote think this was going to help him catch the road runner?\n\nAnd that\u2019s where the Democrats are now.\n\nThey are so obsessed with their pursuit of Trump that their methods no longer look rational.\n\nTheir overconfidence is another near-perfect metaphor for Wile E. Coyote.\n\nIn an equally famous Warner Brothers show titled \u201cOperation: Rabbit,\u201d the coyote is paired against Bugs Bunny, who outwits him at every turn.\n\nThe coyote tells Bugs that it is pointless for him to resist his desire to catch and eat him because he is a genius. He suggests that he is smarter, faster, and stronger. His victory is so assured that there is no point in even objecting.\n\nDoes that sound familiar?\n\nDemocrats and their many allies in media pushed a conspiracy on the American public for three years, claiming that Trump colluded with Russia to win the 2016 election. When that was revealed as untrue, they moved on to another ridiculous claim, not unlike Wile E. Coyote buying a large rubber band from ACME that he could strap around a large cactus, only to launch himself face-first into the ground.\n\nThese are not serious people, and they should not be taken seriously.\n\nThey are clowns, chasing a goal they will never reach. They become more detached from reality with each new failure.\n\nLike Wile E. Coyote, Democrats and the media will continue to create more elaborate schemes which will serve only to showcase their fall off a cliff.\n\nThe coyote is a cartoon character. His ludicrous stupidity is meant to make us laugh.\n\nWhat is their excuse?", "description": "If you are a member of Generation X or older, .10/15/2019 12:20:03PM EST.", "authors": ["Mike Lachance", "Guy Benson", "Cortney O'Brien", "Timothy Meads", "Katie Pavlich", "Leah Barkoukis"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/276/6a7d2689-a635-48fe-b48b-a7ac97b5f208.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
