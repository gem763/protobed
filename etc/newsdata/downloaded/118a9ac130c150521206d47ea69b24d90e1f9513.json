Put another way, do you care more about advancing your views than preserving freedom for diverse views to be on platforms? \u2014 Adam Mosseri (@mosseri) October 26, 2019\n\nLeft-wing activist-journalists have been freaking out over the past few days over Facebook\u2019s decision to include Breitbart News in its list of 200 sources, which will deliver news to Facebook users via the social network\u2019s dedicated News Tab.\n\nMosseri provided a more nuanced take to other criticism throughout the day. At one point he said, \u201cI simply asked if it was more important to get your way than to be default open to speech? The stakes are so high it just might be, but I believe it\u2019s worth asking the question.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m honestly not trying to play a game. I don\u2019t even want Breitbart to be part of Facebook News. I simply asked if it was more important to get your way than to be default open to speech? The stakes are so high it just might be, but I believe it\u2019s worth asking the question. \u2014 Adam Mosseri (@mosseri) October 28, 2019\n\nMost of the 200 sources are mainstream or left-wing, including the New York Times, the Washington Post, BuzzFeed, Hearst, Business Insider, Cond\u00e9 Nast, The Wall Street Journal, and NBC among others. Breitbart News and Fox News are among the only conservative sources that have currently been revealed to be on the list.\n\nSome of the sources on Facebook\u2019s list will also receive funding from the social network, although Facebook won\u2019t say which ones will receive funds, for what, or how much. The Associated Press reports that the sums range from one to two million dollars per eligible publisher.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has clashed with former heads of Instagram. The co-founders of the image sharing platform left the company last year following clashes with the Facebook boss. On this issue, however, Instagram and Facebook appear to be showing a united front.\n\nAre you an insider at Reddit or any other tech company who wants to confidentially reveal wrongdoing or political bias at your company?
