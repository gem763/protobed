There\u2019s a real sense of going back, so of course I need to address that.\u201d\n\nBut in a community as diverse as Latinos in the United States, there is not universal agreement. A small but vocal minority of Hispanics are steadfast supporters of Mr. Trump and dismiss any suggestion that he has encouraged racist attacks with his rhetoric.\n\nRecent polls of Latino voters show, however, that the overwhelming majority believe they are facing increasing threats and view racism as a pressing issue. A Univision poll showed that 87 percent of Latinos who are registered to vote view racism as a significant issue, the highest percentage in nearly a decade, and some 66 percent of voters surveyed said they were \u201cvery worried\u201d there would be another mass shooting \u201ctargeting people based on race or country of origin.\u201d\n\nMs. Castro, now 72, once urged a reporter not to confuse her sons\u2019 politics with hers \u2014 she was more radical. But during the September debate, she was pleased by Mr. Castro\u2019s aggressiveness, and hopes it is a tone that he sticks with, especially in the debate next week.\n\nShe grew up at a time when Mexican-Americans were banned from living in certain neighborhoods in her native San Antonio , and restaurants hung signs that read \u201cNo dogs or Mexicans.\u201d Drawing lessons from the civil rights movement, Chicano activists in the 1960s and \u201970s staged protests and walkouts throughout the Southwest, demanding access to better housing, education and political power.\n\n\u201cDuring my own time and the time of the \u201960s, for me much of what I did came out of anger \u2014 it was just a raw deal for our people,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cI think that with my sons, there is no need to come out of anger. They come out of an educated place, an experienced place \u2014 not to say that they can\u2019t get angry, but they\u2019re coming out of an understanding how public policy is made and in a strategic way.\u201d", "description": "He was raised by a second-generation Mexican-American whose activism was more pronounced than her son\u2019s ever was.
