Across the South, winter-weary residents woke up Wednesday to a region encased in ice, snow and freezing rain, with forecasters warning that the worst of the potentially \"catastrophic\" storm is yet to come.

At one point, the man in the car next to me jumped out of his vehicle and made a pit stop in the nearby bushes. Additionally, I saw a group of mothers blocking the 400 south exit onto Holcomb Bridge in order to help their children's school bus get through the intersection and into the parking lot to unload the kids. In this encounter, there were plenty of curse words, middle fingers, and horns, but the mothers fearlessly stood in front of traffic to hasten the retrieval of their children. It looked dangerous but was fueled by motherly love. I was just glad to have a couple lanes between me and the raucous scene.\n\n\u201cOver the course of 12 hours, I saw countless cars stuck on ice, abandoned and crashed after sliding off the road. After 72.5 miles and almost getting stuck 50 feet from the house, I finally arrived safely home at 3 a.m. I might have missed my birthday, but my wife greeted me with a kiss and a glass of wine, and we toasted my birthday adventure.\u201d\n\nHere are more tales from this week\u2019s storm that dumped three inches of snow on metro Atlanta, iced roads, canceled nearly 800 flights, caused roughly 1,200 accidents, injured at least 130 people, killed two, wrecked countless commutes and stranded thousands in local schools and businesses.\n\nIn surreal scene, cars pile atop each other\n\nOn Camp Creek Parkway, there were enormous amounts of traffic, but I couldn't turn around to go another way. The traffic was at a standstill. I said to myself, Where are all of these people coming and going? It\u2019s only 2:45 p.m. Little did I know my 15-minute drive home was going to turn into a four-hour nightmare.\n\nThe traffic was \u201cmoving\u201d at 5 mph, with large 18-wheelers turned over and others' cars in ditches; needless to say, it was cluster of accidents. I wasn't driving in the snow. I was driving on ice. Three hours later, I was two miles from home. At the intersection of Camp Creek Parkway and Campbellton Road, cars were piled up on top of cars. It was surreal; there was no law enforcement around to get motorists out of this mess.\n\n\u2014 Garry Jones\n\nAtlanta and state officials need to answer tough questions\n\nBy 1 p.m. on Tuesday, it was obvious the snowfall was too steady for the predicted light sprinkling. It was really snowing, and I innately knew that Georgia was not prepared.\n\nI phoned my mother to see if her job was letting employees out early. \"It's business as usual today,\" she said. But about three hours later she was stuck in the massive traffic jam that hindered commuters. Fortunately, she was able to get home in three hours instead of the 20-plus some Atlanta drivers endured.\n\nPublic officials are dancing around key concerns of metro Atlanta citizens: What time had workers officially started pre-treating roads with salt? Who gave the official go-ahead for schools, government and private businesses to send people home at the same time? These questions haven't been answered.\n\nI thought Atlanta had learned from 2011's winter atrocity, but apparently not fully.\n\n\u2014 Nicole Denise\n\nOn the road for more than 24 hours\n\nMy brother-in-law, Don, lives in Dalton. He drives an 18-wheeler. We were scrambling to reach him by phone. We reached him around 5:30 p.m.; he had been sitting on I-285 since 11:30 a.m.\n\nAt midnight he was still there. The law required him to get some sleep. There was a knock on his cab door \u2014 two motorists seeking warmth. By noontime he was moving. Under normal traffic conditions, he was an hour away from home. He arrived home safely seven hours later. He had spent twenty-four and one-half hours on I-285.", "description": "Tales from this week\u2019s storm that dumped three inches of snow on metro Atlanta, iced roads, forced the cancellation of almost 800 flights, caused roughly 1,200 accidents, injured at least 130 people, killed two, wrecked countless commutes and stranded thousands in local schools and business.", "authors": ["Tim Skillern"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.TCdEIAhB4ZwlgqyVpLgbQ--~B/aD0xNDg2O3c9MjIzMztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/ap_webfeeds/aca5a180195452044a0f6a706700148d.jpg", "published_at": "2014-01-30"}
