Such a sentiment prompted President Trump to literally fire The New York Times and Washington Post this week. The White House has canceled its subscriptions to the two newspapers, irked by their endless negative, speculative or suggestive coverage of Mr. Trump and his administration.\n\nYes, well.\n\nSuch fierce sentiments about the press are not a new phenomenon. Consider that Fox News host Howard Kurtz wrote a book titled \u201cMedia Circus: The Trouble with America\u2019s Newspapers.\u201d The year was 1993, and obviously the \u201ccircus\u201d is alive and well, and has even expanded and mutated in the past quarter-century.\n\nBut wait. Mr. Kurtz also authored another book titled \u201cSpin Cycle: How the White House and the Media Manipulate the News\u201d in 1998 during the Clinton administration years. In 2012, Mr. Kurtz produced yet another book titled \u201cHot Air: All Talk, All the Time\u201d which tracked bombastic broadcasters. By 2018, the author produced \u201cMedia Madness: Donald Trump, the Press and the War over Truth.\u201d\n\nOK then. Mr. Kurtz has significant institutional knowledge. And here\u2019s what he has to say these days, as told to \u201cFull Measure\u201d host Sharyl Attkisson on Sunday. \u201cIn your view, did Donald Trump cause the media to descend into madness or just expose media madness that was already in existence?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cThe media\u2019s credibility problems were maybe more like a fever. Once Trump trauma took effect \u2014 that\u2019s what I call it \u2014 I think he sort of made the media go crazy. That\u2019s not to let the press off the hook. But there\u2019s something so visceral in the response of many journalists and pundits to the Trump presidency, to Donald Trump himself. I mean, in addition to the fact that you might expect them to be ideologically opposed to a lot of what he wants to do, he just drives them up the wall,\u201d Mr. Kurtz replied.\n\n\u201cThey never fully accept, many of them, that he is the president. So I think that\u2019s where I got the \u2018madness\u2019 in the title. For the press, Donald Trump has become like the great white whale. And it is hard to avoid the conclusion that so many journalists are invested in an outcome that either sees him driven from office or defeated in 2020,\u201d he observes.\n\nTHE GOP SKEWERS SOCIALISM\n\nThe Republican Party is formally pushing back against the constant and often glowing calls from assorted Democrats and progressives who seek to persuade Americans that in an ideal world, the United States should really be a socialist nation.\n\n\u201cDemocrats want to bring socialism to America. They are offering \u2018free\u2019 everything, from government-run health care to free college-for-all. Learn the truth about what that actually means from real people who lived in socialist countries, and survived to tell their tale,\u201d the GOP advises at a brand new online resource which offers a reality check from those who have not had a very positive experience with socialism.\n\n\u201cThis is the truth about socialism. Hear from the people who have suffered under the oppression of a centralized socialist government. The promises of free government services and equality for all turned into a nightmare,\u201d advises an introductory video.\n\n\u201cAmerica was founded on liberty and independence \u2014 not government coercion, domination, and control. We are born free, and we will stay free. Stand with President Trump to tell Democrats: America will never be a socialist country,\u201d it concludes.\n\nCurious? Take a peek at Victimsofsocialism.org.\n\nFOR ALL YOUR IMPEACHMENT NEEDS\n\nYes, the ever-mutating impeachment \u201cinquiry\u201d is hard to track, given that facts and truth are subject to interpretation. Or they appear to be non-existent. All that aside, one indefatigable public affairs network has launched a new resource for those who pine for a little clarity.\n\n\u201cC-SPAN introduces its new Impeachment Inquiry webpage, designed to make searching, viewing and sharing all of C-SPAN\u2019s impeachment coverage easier,\u201d the network advises.\n\n\u201cCongressional briefings, House hearings, Trump administration response and more. C-SPAN\u2019s Impeachment Inquiry webpage is your fast and easy way to watch unfiltered coverage and our points of interest help you identify key moments if you don\u2019t have time to watch the entire event,\u201d the news organization says.\n\nThank you, ever helpful C-SPAN. Find their new feature at C-span.org/impeachment.\n\nKABILLION GAZILLION JILLION\n\nTrillion used to be a rare word in news coverage, unless, say, it was a story on plankton or stars. Thanks to certain spend-happy politicians, the word appears before the public on a regular basis, prompting some to wonder if we need a new word like, oh, \u201ckabillion\u201d to cover everything. Actually, \u201cquadrillion\u201d follows trillion, but what the heck. On to the news, meanwhile.\n\n\u201cMedicare for All will require $32 trillion in higher taxes over the next decade, according to a report by the Urban Institute and the Commonwealth Fund,\u201d reports Americans for Tax Reform, which combed through the findings and focused upon \u201csingle payer\u201d socialized health care for all U.S. residents, including illegal immigrants.\n\nThe grassroots activist organization advises that Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren has refused to answer whether the \u201cMedicare for All\u201d concept will raise taxes on the middle class \u2014 and she has done this at least 23 times on camera in her broadcast appearances. Yes, the group has compiled the video evidence of this at ATR.org.\n\nMeanwhile, the tax-centric folks also cite Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2018 proposal for Medicare for All \u2014 which contains $14 trillion in tax hikes, or roughly 40% of the total cost of the program.\n\n\u201cIt is also important to note that a significant portion of Sanders\u2019 $14 trillion tax increase relies on eliminating healthcare options for American families ($4.2 trillion) and a 7 % tax on employers large and small ($3.5 trillion),\u201d the group says in their analysis.\n\nPOLL DU JOUR\n\n\u2022 72% of Americans say they have shot a gun.\n\n\u2022 59% say \u201cat least some of their friends\u201d own guns.\n\n\u2022 57% live in a household with no guns.\n\n\u2022 48% grew up in a household with a gun.\n\n\u2022 30% currently own a gun.\n\n\u2022 11% don\u2019t own a gun but live with someone who does.\n\nA Pew Research Center analysis RELEASED TUESDAY, based on a poll of 3,930 U.S. adults conducted March 13-April 4, 2017.\n\n\u2022 Helpful information to [email protected]\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
