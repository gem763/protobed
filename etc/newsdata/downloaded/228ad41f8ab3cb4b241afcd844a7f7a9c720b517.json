He needs our support.", "language": "en", "text": "Sports columnist\n\nWhat Evgeny Kuznetsov needs right now isn\u2019t wrath or scorn, but support. The three-game suspension the NHL handed the Washington Capitals forward on Saturday was a punishment. What he needs is a path forward. The good news for Kuznetsov: He \u2014 and no one else \u2014 will determine whether that path is a direct line to becoming a consistent, accountable, productive professional, or if it\u2019s the meandering and (occasionally) maddening route his career has been on thus far.\n\nEven after Kuznetsov faced questions from the media and spoke for the first time since he tested positive for cocaine during the World Championships in May, there\u2019s only so much we can know. Is he someone who used the drug once, regretted it and moved on? Or does he have a problem for which he needs help?\n\n\u201cI said everything in the statement already,\u201d Kuznetsov said Saturday, referring to a release issued by the Capitals.\n\nForget that he didn\u2019t address that issue in his statement. This isn\u2019t a time for condemnation, because whether he dabbled and put it down or was a regular user, he has been outed. That has the benefit of being good for Kuznetsov personally and professionally, because he can get himself right. It also, in a roundabout way, can be good for the Capitals. Regardless of the magnitude of the problem \u2014 minuscule or major \u2014 exposure was the best route to making sure Kuznetsov acts, each and every day, not only like one of the centerpieces of an organization that has entrusted him with much money and responsibility, but also a 27-year-old father of two, a more important role.\n\n[D.C. Sports Bog: Alex Ovechkin takes first shift \u2014 as a Giant cashier]\n\nSaturday at the Capitals\u2019 Arlington training facility, Kuznetsov said a lot of the right things.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people who are supporting me, and I\u2019m going to appreciate it,\u201d Kuznetsov said. \u201cAnd as a hockey player, the only chance to say thanks to them is to prove on the ice. Growing as a person, I want to get better and I\u2019m going to learn from this, for sure.\u201d\n\nBut he also said a few things that seemed misplaced, incongruous with what he was facing, which were serious questions about his state of mind, his maturity, his professionalism, his reliability, his health. Keep in mind: Kuznetsov is inherently loopy, a goofball who wants to lighten the mood in any room with a joke. So often over the monotony of an 82-game season, that works. Faced with serious questions about his own accountability, that might not be the best approach.\n\nEither way, the core question for a Capitals fan \u2014 shoot, for a Capitals coach or a Capitals exec or a Capitals teammate \u2014 would be: Evgeny, did you have off-ice issues that affected your performance in 2018-19, which was, shall we say, uneven?\n\n\u201cProbably no,\u201d Kuznetsov said. \u201cOf course, after 70 points, a bad year, you look for the bounce back, right?\u201d\n\nWithout question, he said it flippantly. Seventy points is a lousy year, and you have to look for off-ice reasons that caused it? Please.\n\nHere\u2019s where Kuznetsov needs to be careful, even as so much of what he says is contrite, even as teammates have publicly and privately shown support. The Capitals believe he is an elite talent. Yes, the 72 points Kuznetsov produced in 76 games last year could be considered a career achievement for players of a certain ability. List any of those players, and the Capitals believe Kuznetsov is more talented. What Kuznetsov didn\u2019t say: that 72-point season featured one 25-game stretch in which he scored just one goal. Too many nights, you didn\u2019t notice he was on the ice, and he\u2019s way too good for that.\n\n[For Caps Coach Todd Reirden, second season is first chance at fresh start]\n\nSo had a video of Kuznetsov with a substance that appeared to be cocaine never surfaced, had he not tested positive, this training camp would have opened with questions about who Kuznetsov will be: the best-guy-on-the-ice-every night character that appeared during the Caps\u2019 run to the 2018 Stanley Cup, or the will-he-show-up-or-not enigma who disappeared in last spring\u2019s first-round exit? It\u2019s an important issue for the future of the organization given that after cornerstones Alex Ovechkin and Nicklas Backstrom have moved on \u2014 it\u2019s coming, people \u2014 Kuznetsov will remain. He has six years remaining on his eight-year, $62.4 million deal.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s more there,\u201d Coach Todd Reirden said Saturday.\n\nEveryone on the Capitals realizes that. Forty-five players registered more points than Kuznetsov last year. You think Kuznetsov thinks there are 45 better offensive players in the league? He shouldn\u2019t, because there aren\u2019t.\n\nStill, drawing a direct line between Kuznetsov\u2019s positive test and his inconsistent performance is risky. The Capitals themselves aren\u2019t doing that, not in the front office, not in the dressing room. I asked Ovechkin the other day whether, as the team\u2019s captain, he had reached out to Kuznetsov in the wake of the news.\n\n[Svrluga: The Caps said some tough goodbyes. There\u2019s more to come.]\n\n\u201cNot as captain,\u201d Ovechkin said. \u201cAs a friend.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the right approach. Put aside the hockey. If you need help, we\u2019re here, in the room or in the stands. Should you choose to cheer Kuznetsov when he first appears in the regular season at Capital One Arena, which would be Oct. 8 against Dallas, those cheers shouldn\u2019t be seen as an endorsement of his previous choices, but as support for the pledges he has made to be better because of it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a bad person,\u201d Kuznetsov said Saturday.\n\nYou so want to take his word for it, and yet trust must be rebuilt. When the video first appeared, Kuznetsov issued a statement that he had \u201cnever\u201d done drugs. He initially said that to both the Capitals and the NHL, too, and while the league said his suspension was for \u201cinappropriate conduct\u201d that we would assume related to the subsequent positive test, it could also have related to misleading the team and the league when the issue first came up.\n\nEither way, the time for judging is tomorrow, and the next day, and the next and into January and through June, because that\u2019s when Evgeny Kuznetsov will show us what path he has chosen.\n\n\u201cI feel bad for my friends, for my teammates, for the organization, for the fans that they have to deal with this news,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I will pay back more than people give me right now.\u201d\n\nSupport that idea, and help him follow through. Maybe Evgeny Kuznetsov slipped up once. Maybe he had a full-blown problem. What matters is the path ahead. It is his to choose.", "description": "In wake of suspension, the Capitals forward must confront some hard questions.", "authors": ["Barry Svrluga", "Sports Columnist With Beat Writing Experience On Baseball", "Golf", "The Nfl", "College Basketball", "College Football", "Sports Columnist", "September At Pm", "Barry Svrluga Became A Sports Columnist For The Washington Post In December He Arrived At The Post In To Cover Football", "Basketball At The University Of Maryland"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/-6_n6VDEJjsnV4kGDd0BMDBv3lY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DLUS2SSNUYI6TDH4FROQTGOCDY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
