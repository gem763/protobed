Max also told me that he had not seen the yellow flags at all, which I understand, because normally you are informed by your team in such a moment.\n\n\"He also saw that other people were not lifting the gas, so Max is disappointed that only he got the penalty.\n\n\"But I see it as another learning moment for Max.
