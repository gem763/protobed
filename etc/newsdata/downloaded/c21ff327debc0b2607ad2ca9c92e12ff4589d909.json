If your child is more unwell than you\u2019ve ever seen them before, and if they\u2019re getting sicker by the hour, see a doctor, and ask, \u201cIs this sepsis?\u201d \u2019\n\nParents have long been advised that if a red or purple skin rash on their child doesn\u2019t fade when a glass or tumbler is pressed against it, it is a telltale sign of the brain disease (stock image)\n\nDr Bernatoniene adds: \u2018With prompt treatment, even patients with severe meningitis can make a good recovery.\n\n\u2018Parents should trust their instincts if their child appears be getting worse and seek medical attention immediately.\u2019\n\nNormal rashes are often the result of inflammation on the skin surface.\n\nPressure from a glass pressed on the rash restricts the blood supply to it, leading to blanching or whitening.\n\nMeningitis is inflammation of the protective membranes called meninges surrounding the brain and spinal cord. It is usually caused by a virus or bacteria.\n\nThe rash it causes is different from the normal sort. It can appear as pin-prick red or purple spots on the skin, or look like bruising.\n\nThe marks occur when the bacteria that cause meningitis invade the bloodstream, producing toxins and damaging blood vessels.\n\nBlood starts to \u2018leak\u2019 into the skin, resulting in the characteristic rash, but this stage could mean sepsis has already set in.\n\nSepsis strikes when an infection sparks a violent immune response in which the body attacks its own organs.\n\nAaron Phipps, 36, a Paralympian and GB wheelchair rugby player, was diagnosed with bacterial meningitis and sepsis at 15.\n\n\u2018My first symptoms were similar to flu,\u2019 he recalls. \u2018I did get a rash but by then I was delirious and confused and had collapsed. I went from rash to life-support machine in 60 minutes.\u2019\n\nWith all his organs shutting down, Aaron was placed in an induced coma and given a 20 per cent chance of survival.\n\nIncredibly, he recovered, but had to have both legs and most of his fingers amputated and was in hospital for a year.\n\n\u2018I urge parents and teens to familiarise themselves with the early symptoms,\u2019 he says.", "description": "Aaron Phipps, 36, a Paralympian and GB wheelchair rugby player, was diagnosed with bacterial meningitis and sepsis at 15.
