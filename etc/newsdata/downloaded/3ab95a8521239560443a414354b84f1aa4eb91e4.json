Eventually a dark-coloured Porsche Cayenne rolls up and its windows rolls down slowly, revealing a young man originally from Moscow with many questions. All approach the car as one would an estranged, childhood friend.\n\nTwo dudes (photographer Nick Wiesner and I) perched on the corner of Wythe and North 4th in Williamsburg, sipping iced coffees and tapping smartphones. It\u2019s a bourgeoise scene, yet we\u2019re brought together by a bright-orange 4x4 standard of the Soviet Union. It\u2019s called the Lada \u201cNiva\u201d (Russian for \u201cfield with crops\u201d).\n\nAt a glance, it\u2019s an absurd combination of object and place \u2014 like a coconut tree growing out of a Norwegian Fjord. But, then again, it isn\u2019t. Something feels right. I can\u2019t shake the feeling that the Niva is supposed to be there, up against that sticker-bombed fire alarm call-box.\n\nOur street encounters shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise. Since the late \u201880s, New York City has seen a surge of immigration from the former Eastern Bloc. In particular, immigrants from the former USSR (Ukrainians, Polish, Russians, Uzbeks, Kazakhs, Belarusians, Kyrgyz and so on) form a sizable chunk of New York City\u2019s population, especially in South Brooklyn. And though these groups are culturally and linguistically distinct from one another, being under a single Soviet banner for the better part of a century did have some universalising effects: like the mayonnaise-laden \u2018salads\u2019 and, of course, the cars \u2014 Ladas in particular.\n\nBut even beyond the USSR\u2019s borders, Ladas left their mark across the entirety of the Eastern Bloc \u2014 in states like Poland, Hungary and Bulgaria. And for the New Yorkers who hail from this vast chunk of world (of which there are many), Ladas are a reminder of a not-so-distant socialist past.\n\n\u201cPeople have stopped on a highway \u2014 almost held up traffic to the point of an accident \u2014 to stop, take photos; to tell me that they both loved and hated this car,\u201d Nick tells me.\n\n\u201cOne or two people say that this is the exact [Niva] that their grandfather had.\u201d Another guy was once \u201calmost overwhelmed to tears\u201d by the car.\n\nMoreover, it\u2019s not just New Yorkers with Eastern Bloc roots that are responding. The Niva was actually sold all over the world. And I\u2019m not just talking about the Soviet-allied states like Egypt or Cuba. Even the Canadians got them; though the U.S. never did, sadly.\n\nSoon enough, another awestruck New Yorker pauses in front of the Niva. He mentions that he\u2019s from Haiti. Blissfully examining the car, he whispers something to himself about all the memories.\n\nNick\u2019s own relationship with the Lada Niva began where you wouldn\u2019t necessarily expect \u2014 in his ancestral homeland of Medell\u00edn, Colombia. Nick didn\u2019t set out to buy a Niva in particular. He needed a durable, off-roadable and, above all, cheap ride to get around Colombia\u2019s mountainous terrain. A white Niva ended up being Nick\u2019s solution. But only sort of.\n\nWhen Nick bought the Niva, his family laughed. Not with him, at him. Ladas have a reputation in Colombia for being, well, not particularly reliable. But this didn\u2019t phase Nick. He was a man in need of a beater, and that\u2019s when the best kind of mistakes are made.\n\nIt only got funnier when Nick drove the Niva three hours into the mountains, where the timing chain decided to snap. On a blind corner of a narrow, winding road. With heavy traffic and big rig trucks barreling past in both directions. All while accompanied by an American who\u2019d never been to South America before \u2014 who was having a panic attack.\n\nYou\u2019d think this episode would forever put an end to Nick\u2019s relationship with Soviet cars. But that\u2019s not how these things work. The more epic your nightmare, the stronger your bond. As such, Nick\u2019s turbulent expedition through the mountains of Colombia was just another twist in a lasting love affair \u2014 one between a young man and an old car. And it\u2019s a love that has since transcended continents. Because, when Nick relocated to Brooklyn a few years back, he bought another Niva: the bright-orange one you see here.\n\nAdmittedly, it may seem like an irrational thing to do \u2014 owning a Niva, let alone any classic car, in New York City. But Nick may be onto something here.\n\nThough New York isn\u2019t necessarily a \u201crugged, off-road terrain, it is in certain ways,\u201d Nick admits. The Niva works as an \u201curban off-roader.\u201d As such, no construction plate, knee-deep pothole, or unmarked speed hump presents a serious challenge to the Niva \u2014 a car designed to survive Siberia, let alone Park Slope.\n\n\u201cIt works for New York City,\u201d Nick says of his Niva. \u201cI\u2019m at the same height as the Land Rovers and Range Rovers, but at a quarter of the other dimensions, so I can squeeze past.\u201d This is key because driving in New York City often comes down to squeezing gaps. As it\u2019s roughly as wide as a third-gen Smart Car, the Niva is in the top-tier of the gap-squeezing hierarchy.\n\nNick says he\u2019s given the \u201cright of way\u201d often, partly because \u201cpeople understand that you might not be able to brake on a dime.\u201d But it also might be because the Niva, despite its smallness and spartanness, is very noticeable.\n\nAt one point a bro starts yelling at us from the back seat of an Uber.\n\n\u201cWhat car is that?\u201d\n\n\u201cA Niva,\u201d Nick says.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\n\u201cA Lada.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d\n\n\u201cA Russian car.\u201d\n\n\u201c. . . Oh.\u201d\n\nNick gets these questions \u2014 in that exact order \u2014 all the time. \u201cPeople who don\u2019t know what [the Niva] is still find it aesthetically interesting.\u201d There\u2019s something aesthetic about the car. \u201cRight now, this look is coming back. People want FJs; people want Land Cruisers; people want this kind of old Range Rover/Land Rover Defender kind of vibe and [the Niva] has that kind of DNA in it.\u201d\n\nIn a perpetually gridlocked city with a 40km/h speed limit, it\u2019s hard to imagine enjoying a car. But going over, say, the Manhattan Bridge, Nick can wind out the Niva to its full potential. \u201cI can overtake\u201d and speed up to \u201calmost forty miles per hour.\u201d Sure, in some old Porsche these speeds feel lame. But in a Soviet-built 4x4 with vending-machine aerodynamics, it feels exciting, if not a bit terrifying.\n\nI got to drive Nick\u2019s car around Williamsburg and, I must say, a classic Niva feels surprisingly light \u2014 even lighter than the 2019 model I reviewed earlier this summer. The transmission is crisp and smooth in spite of its age. The clutch travel is light and short which, for city traffic, is fine. The steering will surprise you. Yes, it\u2019s unassisted, but the wheel is enormous \u2014 fit for a city bus, if not a dump truck. And, the wider your steering wheel, the less work your forearms do.\n\n(I should note that this Niva is a borderline-pristine example. It\u2019s an import from Russia, where it was garage-kept by an old man for most of its life. Everything works as it should and, since buying the car, Nick\u2019s been able to solve most problems \u201cwith a simple set of tools.\u201d )\n\nParallel parking the Lada Niva is a joy. This thing is inches shorter than the smallest new Mini you can buy. Plus, when you\u2019re squeezing into a tight spot, there\u2019s no vague bulge of 8km/h-bumper affecting your judgment \u2014 just very matter-of-fact 90 degree angles.\n\nMost importantly, the Lada Niva is a classic car that doesn\u2019t cause paranoia. After all, this isn\u2019t some Pebble-Beach-money-pit British roadster with caviar leaking out of the glove compartment. This is important because, in New York City, few vehicles survive the environment unscathed. If anything, a Niva with some battle scars is more authentic.\n\nNow is all this to say that you should purchase a Lada Niva to use as a daily around your city? Absolutely not. It goes without saying, there are many fundamental problems with the Niva. I\u2019m not suggesting that New Yorkers purchase a vintage Niva over, say, a Toyota Corolla or a MetroCard.\n\nBut if you\u2019re going to go through the trouble of owning a classic car in New York City \u2014 to drive occasionally and for fun \u2014 the Niva is an option that makes sense. It\u2019s inexpensive, easy to park, a pleasure over potholes, and tiny enough to squeeze through gridlock. If something hits you \u2014 which is, frankly, inevitable \u2014 it isn\u2019t the end of the world.\n\nPlus, everybody wants to be your friend, and half of South Brooklyn has a story for you.", "description": "Among a sea of rubber-necking passersby, a woman from Bulgaria stops dead in her tracks, and some Polish men in a van slow to crawl.
