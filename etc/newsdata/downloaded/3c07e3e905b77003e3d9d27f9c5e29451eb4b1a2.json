Bernard Sanders and the more fiscally moderate former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cYou know Brett, socialism is the oldest trick in the book,\u201d Mr. Perez said. \u201cYou\u2019re a very good student of history. When Social Security was debated, when Medicare was debated, when the minimum wage was debated, Republican opponents of all of those three critical elements of our social compact said this is socialism. What Social Security and Medicare and the minimum wage have done is make capitalism work for everyone. And so, this is the oldest attack line in the book. Voters are smart. When you have coverage for people with a preexisting condition, I\u2019d hardly call that socialism. I\u2019d call that sound health policy and sound economic policy.\u201d\n\nMr. Baier then asked if Democrats would substantively address how they proposed to pay for their initiatives while also controlling deficits and debt.\n\n\u201cThe big difference between Republicans and Democrats on the economy is that Democrats believe that the economy should work for everyone \u2014 not just a few at the top. Republicans don\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Perez replied. \u201cDemocrats have passed, in the House, an increase in the minimum wage. Donald Trump said seven and a quarter [dollars] is enough to feed your family. \u2026 If you want fiscal responsibility in this country \u2014 go back 20, 30 years \u2014 elect Democrats. [The] stock market does better. The deficit goes down. George Herbert Walker Bush handed Bill Clinton, you know, a deficit as long as the eye can see. Bill Clinton handed George W. Bush surpluses.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
