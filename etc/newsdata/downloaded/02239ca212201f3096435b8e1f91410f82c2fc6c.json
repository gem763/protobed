The company has also completed its first manufacturing facility and has brought on a veteran aerospace executive to oversee its flight program. Lilium says it remains \u201con track\u201d to launch passenger operations in several locations around the world by 2025.\n\nThe last we heard from Lilium was in May of this year, when its unpiloted prototype finished its first test flight \u2014 basically taking off, hovering for a few seconds, and then landing. The new footage released today shows the aircraft transitioning from vertical flight to level flight, which is a key maneuver for so-called electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft. Lilium called the transition from vertical takeoff to forward flight \u201cone of aerospace\u2019s greatest challenges.\u201d\n\nLilium\u2019s jet certainly stands out among the current crop of \u201cflying car\u201d startups: it has an egg-shaped cabin perched on landing gear with a pair of parallel tilt-rotor wings. The wings are fitted with a total of 36 electric jet engines that tilt up for vertical takeoff and then shift forward for horizontal flight. There is no tail, rudder, propellers, or gearbox. The cabin can seat five passengers.\n\nWhen it\u2019s complete, the Lilium Jet will have a range of 300 kilometers (186 miles) and a top speed of 300 km/h (186 mph), the company says. Lilium says this puts it ahead of its competitors and allows it to fly between regions rather than just short hops within cities.\n\nThe release of the footage arrived as the company also celebrated the completion of its first manufacturing facility. The 3,000-square-meter space is located at the company\u2019s Munich headquarters, and it will soon be complemented by a second larger facility, which is already under construction at the same site. Combined, they will support Lilium\u2019s aim of producing hundreds of aircraft a year by the time commercial services begin in 2025.\n\nLilium also announced the hiring of Airbus veteran Yves Yemsi as chief program officer. Yemsi worked as head of program quality for the highly successful Airbus A350 aircraft.", "description": "German air taxi startup Lilium has completed its first phase of testing, with its five-seater 36-rotor electric prototype hitting speeds of 100 km/h (62 mph).
