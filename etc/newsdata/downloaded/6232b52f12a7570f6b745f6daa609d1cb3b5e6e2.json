Not only would I make a fortune on the road, breast implants would take me to the next level of my film career, according to my agent (he said I\u2019d never be in the upper echelon of porn stars otherwise). I briefly entertained the thought of implants and went so far as to get a consultation, but in the end wasn\u2019t brave enough to go under the knife. I was too afraid of coming out lopsided; I imagined a future where one boob spontaneously burst during a rough sex scene or due to a minor car accident during L.A. rush-hour traffic. I didn\u2019t have the courage to face that future; somehow my agent\u2019s ridicule was more tolerable. Personal preference aside, my agent was right about one thing: big boobs sell themselves. Of course, at the time no one had heard the term \u201cBII\u201d\u2014breast implant illness.\n\nSuffering from migraines not even medication could dull, constant fatigue, hair loss, and a myriad of other symptoms, Karmen Karma has been in and out of doctor\u2019s offices for the last year trying to reclaim her quality of life. All the tests came back normal. How she could be in her twenties, supposedly in the prime of her life, yet feel closer to 60 was a mystery until a couple of months ago, when a worldwide recall was issued for textured breast implants. \u201cI had the same ones that were recalled but mine were smooth not textured, and I got worried,\u201d says Karma. \u201cI read about breast implant illnesses and it sounded like everything I had.\u201d\n\nIt hadn\u2019t always been that way.\n\nIn 2014, a year and a half into her career as an adult actress, Karma heeded the advice of her agent and industry colleagues and opted for a breast augmentation. It was an instant career boost. \u201cI struggled with getting work in the beginning because of my tattoos. As soon as I got my implants, all these companies that weren\u2019t shooting me before were suddenly interested,\u201d recalls Karma. \u201cI guess I\u2019m happy I got them even after everything that\u2019s happened because they made me so much money.\u201d\n\nTowards the end of last year, Karma had a second breast augmentation\u2014this time to replace her old implants. With a post-baby body, her proportions had changed and it was either go bigger or get a lift. Karma went bigger. That\u2019s when the problems began. Realizing her implants were having a negative effect on her health, Karma struggled with the decision to have explant surgery, concerned about how it could impact her career. \u201cI just though, what\u2019s more important, being an active part of my daughter\u2019s life or continuing to live like this?\u201d Karma opted to explant last week. Though she\u2019s still recovering and in her first week post-surgery, she says she feels better now than she has in almost a year.\n\nWith the release of her first book, Overcome, a memoir chronicling her adult career and journey to sobriety, Karma gained a new sense of confidence in her ability to earn a living without implants. \u201cBefore, it was like what else would I do? I make so much money and it\u2019s what I know how to do. I don\u2019t have a degree, I have tattoos all over me, and I\u2019ve done porn. I don\u2019t know what else I\u2019d do but now that I wrote the book, I feel like if no one wants to see me anymore I can take a different avenue,\u201d says Karma. \u201cIt\u2019s the first way I\u2019ve made money without my body, not that I\u2019m ashamed of porn or anything I\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\n\u201c I was told by certain male overseers, agents, and directors, that if I got my boobs done I\u2019d make a lot more money, so in my naivet\u00e9 I jumped at the first doctor I could find to do the procedure. \u201d \u2014 Nicole Aniston\n\nMany other women in the adult industry face similar circumstances, and feel forced into making decisions that pit their health against the only career they\u2019ve known.\n\n\u201cI was told by certain male overseers, agents and directors, that if I got my boobs done I\u2019d make a lot more money, so in my naivet\u00e9 I jumped at the first doctor I could find to do the procedure,\u201d recalls adult actress Nicole Aniston.\n\nExcited and happy with her new look and the additional work it brought to her, it would be several years before Aniston had a second procedure and then later a third to correct the work that wasn\u2019t done properly the first time around. \u201cAfter I went smaller in November of last year, I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that something wasn\u2019t right,\u201d says Aniston, who\u2019d begun to experience some unpleasant side effects.\n\nBefore considering implant removal, Aniston had to consider the impact it would have on her earnings. To do that she turned to social media, where she has over half a million followers to query. \u201cI put it on social media for my fans so they could prepare for it,\u201d says Aniston. \u201cI know now that if I never shoot for another company again, the fans that are really interested in my life who follow me on OnlyFans and Snapchat are dedicated to seeing me as a woman and will continue to support me.\u201d\n\nWith dedicated fan support, women in the industry have more power to choose their health over implants while maintaining a successful career\u2014especially with the prevalence of webcam modeling.\n\nRenowned webcam model Christy Foxx had always wanted breast implants; in fact, she\u2019d been planning on it since the age of 16. \u201cI did so much research on what kind, what size, what brand, high or low or teardrop, I focused so much on what kind of implant I wanted that I didn\u2019t look into the risks of getting it,\u201d says Foxx.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t prepared for the side effects. \u201cI struggled with the fear of taking them out and what they would look like even though I had all kinds of physical problems, breathing issues, severe memory loss. I was fatigued and tired all the time,\u201d Foxx remembers. \u201cI\u2019d have to lift both of my boobs up just to take a deep breath. I had no idea what BII was. I\u2019d never heard of it before and didn\u2019t think anything of it until my friend had her implants removed.\u201d\n\nSeveral procedures later, Foxx is feeling better now with a different set of implants; she\u2019s not ready to give up on them just yet but says if her quality of life begins to deteriorate again, she\u2019ll choose her health.\n\nNonetheless, if she could give some advice to her younger self it would be this: \u201cDon\u2019t do it, don\u2019t do implants. Not that BII happens to everyone but you don\u2019t actually need them for the job. If I could go back in time I\u2019d never have gotten them in the first place.\u201d", "description": "Many adult actresses are pressured into getting bigger breasts for bigger paydays, but for some it\u2019s led to a number of health problems.", "authors": ["Aurora Snow"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_843,w_1500,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567471270/190829-snow-xxx-breast-implants-tease_do8uhy"}
