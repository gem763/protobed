Only Turkey recognizes a Turkish Cypriot declaration of independence in the island's northern third.\n\nThe Greek Cypriot-led government has said its offshore drilling operations are an exercise of a sovereign right and that any future gas proceeds would be shared equitably if a deal to reunify the island is reached with the breakaway Turkish Cypriots.\n\nThe three leaders also condemned Turkey's planned military offensive into northeastern Syria, after President Donald Trump said earlier this week the U.S. would step aside for an expected Turkish attack on Syrian Kurdish fighters, who have fought alongside Americans for years.\n\nThey vowed to step up efforts to tackle illegal migration across the eastern Mediterranean and hone their anti-terrorism tactics.\n\nThe Greek leader said that Egypt is a strategic partner for the European Union and that Cyprus and Greece would work to strengthen EU-Egypt relations.\n\nIn a previous meeting, the three countries agreed to broaden \"strategic cooperation\" on energy, including how to transport newly found gas in the region to Europe and linking the electricity grids of Europe and North Africa via an undersea cable.\n\nThe 2,000 megawatt cable, known as the EuroAfrica Interconnector, will stretch nearly 1,000 miles from Greece to Egypt through Cyprus.", "description": "Egypt, Cyprus, and Greece on Tuesday condemned an \"unlawful and unacceptable\" bid by Turkey to drill inside waters where Cyprus has exclusive economic rights.
