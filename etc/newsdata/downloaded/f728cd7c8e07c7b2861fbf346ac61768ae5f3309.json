I almost didn\u2019t know about it because I haven\u2019t checked my voicemails from my dad for the last, like, 12 years?\u201d She went on to joke that she had \u201ca lot in common\u201d with the other roasters on the stage\u2014including Caitlyn Jenner, Robert De Niro and others\u2014because \u201clike them, I don\u2019t really know you that well either.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of people know my dad as that guy from the Mission: Impossible movies or that guy from 30 Rock,\u201d Ireland added. \u201cI know him as that guy from like, half of my birthday parties?\u201d\n\nAlec could only pretend to laugh at that one.\n\nLast year, Demi Moore showed up as a surprise roaster for her ex-husband Bruce Willis\u2019 Comedy Central roast, joking memorably that their marriage was \u201clike The Sixth Sense: you were dead the whole time.\u201d Ireland\u2019s mother Kim Basinger did not show up to roast her ex.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to be the daughter of an iconic movie star,\" Ireland added later. \"But I\u2019m not here to talk about my mom and her Oscar.\u201d\n\nAfter the voicemail leaked in 2007, Baldwin made a public apology, writing, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, as everyone who knows me is aware, for losing my temper with my child. I have been driven to the edge by parental alienation for many years now. You have to go through this to understand. (Although I hope you never do.) I am sorry for what happened.\u201d\n\nIn a 2012 interview with Page Six Magazine, Ireland downplayed the incident, saying that \u201cpeople made it out to be a way bigger deal than it was\u201d and that her father had \u201csaid stuff like that before just because he\u2019s frustrated.\u201d\n\nLater in the show, comedian Jeff Ross joked that President Donald Trump has actually been doing an Alec Baldwin impression for the past few years. \u201cHe calls people names, he yells at the press, he married an immigrant half his age,\u201d Ross said from the stage. \u201cThe only difference is that Trump calls his daughter a fox, not a pig.\u201d\n\n\u201cGreat job, Ireland,\u201d he added. \u201cYou didn\u2019t oink once.\u201d\n\nFor more, listen to Roastmaster General Jeff Ross on The Last Laugh podcast below:", "description": "Alec Baldwin\u2019s daughter got her revenge 12 years after that infamous voicemail leaked.", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1191,w_2117,x_356,y_34/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568399062/1173055199_ireland-alec_rd2muh", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
