I had it out for a couple of days looking at it and then it was back in the case and in the cupboard under the stairs.\n\n(Image: Mark Robinson)\n\n\"I don\u2019t have a trophy cabinet yet so there quite a few medals and trophies under there alongside the hoover and an old computer. My Commonwealth medal is under there but so are a lot of odd little things.\n\n\"I am just not one for flashing it about but maybe once I move into my new house I might put some stuff on display, but right now I just want to be a world champion and as good as I can be.\n\n\"To me, the belt is just a bit of metal, being world champion is what I want to be. I am not too fussed about everything that goes with it, or being famous.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nTaylor splits his time between Kent and Haddington in East Lothian and recently had a new house built with his girlfriend Dani.\n\nThe 28-year-old has won each of his 15 professional fights having won Commonwealth gold as an amateur.\n\nVictory over Prograis could catapult him into a fight against current unified champion Jose Ramirez in a clash to determine the undisputed king of the 140lb division.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nAnd Taylor added: \"I got into boxing to become a world champion and make my family financially secure so money was some motivation.\n\n\"I am not a money-oriented type of guy, I just want to be financially secure and look after my family, that is part of the drive and motivation.\n\n\"I don\u2019t want to achieve my dream of becoming a world champion and then, when I retire, have to go and get a job and work on a building site because I have no money.\n\n\"I want to make wise investments and hopefully have a nice life after boxing.\"", "description": "Josh Taylor has no plans to show off his collection - even if he can become a unified world champion on Saturday night", "authors": ["Martin Domin", "Image", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Mark Robinson", "Pa", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20659073.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Regis-Prograis-Josh-Taylor-Press-Conference.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
