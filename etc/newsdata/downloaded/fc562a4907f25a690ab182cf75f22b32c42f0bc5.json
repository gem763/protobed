Then she found solace in a virtual world populated by \"Pikachus\", \"Weedles\" and \"Smeargles\".\n\nPerez started playing Pokemon Go, the augmented-reality game that encourages players to travel around looking through their mobile phone cameras so they can collect animated creatures that \"appear\" in front of them.\n\nNow the 75-year-old spends up to six hours a day walking the streets of of Badalona, a quiet Spanish town to the north of Barcelona, chasing after digital ghosts, dragons and monsters.\n\n\"I don't want to be stuck at home all afternoon watching television. I also don't want to sit around all day reflecting with people my age \u2013 I want to do something in the fresh air,\" Perez told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, chuckling.\n\nAs people live longer, the World Health Organization predicts that one in five - 2 billion people - will be aged 60 or older by 2050, double that of 2015.\n\nAnd ageing populations all over the world are already putting pressure on healthcare, infrastructure, housing and other social services.\n\nFinding surprising ways to keep older people mentally and physically healthy is a point of pride for Badalona, one of nearly 80 cities, towns and regions taking part in this year's European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing.\n\nLaunched by the European Commission in 2012, the partnership aims to improve the health and quality of life of older citizens, such as those suffering from dementia and Alzheimer's disease.\n\nThe initiative wants to add two years to the average healthy lifespan of European Union citizens by 2020 - which currently stands at about 64 years.\n\nAnca Paduraru, the European Commission's spokeswoman for public health projects, said countries should see ageing as \"an opportunity to innovate\" and modernise health systems.\n\nPerez, who was introduced to Pokemon Go by her daughter after it first launched three years ago, said she walks between 12 and 15 km (7-9 miles) every day playing the game.\n\nCatching Pokemon is a good way of meeting people and getting to know Badalona better, she explained, because it takes her to neighbourhoods she would not normally visit.\n\nAnd she is motivated by the health benefits of playing the game, which have helped her recover after she suffered a bout of skin cancer.\n\n\"One of the main reasons I play is to not put on too much weight \u2013 that's important,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nRELIEVING ISOLATION\n\nPokemon Go can be \"a good way of connecting people with others so they are less isolated,\" said Carlos Sanchez, a social worker who works with people suffering from loneliness and other living difficulties in Badalona.\n\n\"It's most useful for people that don't have anything to fill their time, like if they don't have grandchildren to pick up from school,\" he stressed, adding that he recommends the game to some of his clients.\n\nJordi Piera Jimenez, chief information and R&D officer at public healthcare provider Badalona Care Services, agreed, adding that \"more and more people are coming to live in cities and isolation is becoming a huge problem\".\n\nAlmost 70% of the world's population is expected to be living in urban areas by 2050, according to the United Nations.\n\n\"Isolation and a feeling of loneliness are problems that in rural areas are less common, because people are more resilient and used to taking care of each other ... Cities tend to be more impersonal,\" Piera lamented.\n\nSpotting unmet demand, technology and toy companies are marketing devices such as robotic pets, like the therapeutic seal from Japanese company Paro which remembers how it has been stroked and responds to certain words.\n\nThere are also glasses from French firm Abeye that can call for help when they detect the wearer has taken a fall and artificial intelligence products like ElliQ, which initiates conversation to keep older people company.\n\nIn Badalona, at least 300 residents aged 65 and over are using or have used Pokemon Go, Piera said.\n\n\n\n\n\nFINANCING PRESSURES\n\nBadalona - which, unlike most cities, owns its public healthcare system - is promoting and testing the use of digital healthcare solutions but is held back by funding issues, said Piera.", "description": "At first, when she retired from a lifelong career in nursing in her native Spain, Joanna Perez Osuna struggled with a lack of purpose.
