And I think we all know what that does to you.\u201d\n\nIn an emotional video posted just hours before Harris' crash, the singer said she'd been driving for 12 hours and reflected on the deaths in her family linked to her memories of Taos.\n\nCowan said, \u201cIf you\u2019ve ever had a little kid and they run around the living room in circles trying to keep themselves awake and they look like they\u2019re on steroids \u2014 I think that after driving 12 hours and being excited and wanting to stay awake, that that\u2019s the probable frame of mind that she was in at that point. And that\u2019s probably not safe, but we really won\u2019t know the answer for quite some time.\u201d\n\nFIRST RESPONDER TO KYLIE RAE HARRIS CRASH WAS FATHER OF 16-YEAR-OLD VICTIM\n\n\u201cTexas is a huge state, and she would drive all up and down the state highways to remote towns and out in the middle of nowhere,\u201d Cowan added. \u201cThose musicians are traveling at 2 o\u2019clock in the morning when everybody out there is dangerous. It\u2019s a very dangerous life to lead. But she was made to do what she did, and I would never want her to have not been that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that we worried about quite a bit when she started traveling like that because she wasn\u2019t, honestly, famous enough to have a driver,\u201d she continued. \u201cShe drove herself everywhere and sometimes her car was working well and sometimes it wasn\u2019t. It was a daily struggle for her, and that\u2019s true for a lot of startup musicians.\u201d\n\nCowan also said that Harris' last memories of Taos were heartbreaking: When Harris' father was last in the northern New Mexico town, he was visiting his terminally ill mother, who died shortly after. Within 10 days of Harris' grandmother's death, her aunt also died. When Harris' father went to the doctor upon arriving home from Taos, he was diagnosed with lung cancer and died nine months later.\n\nSHERIFF SAYS WITH 'MOST CERTAINTY' KYLIE RAE HARRIS CAUSED CRASH THAT KILLED HER, TEEN: REPORTS\n\n\u201cKylie\u2019s last remembrances of her dad \u2014 before he got sick \u2014 were at Taos,\u201d Cowan says. \u201cSo that was huge.\u201d\n\nLaw enforcement said Harris was traveling south on State Road 522 in a black 2017 Chevrolet Equinox when the SUV made contact with the back of a Chevrolet Avalanche pickup truck. Authorities said the maneuver caused Harris to veer left into oncoming northbound traffic where her vehicle collided head-on with a white 2008 Jeep Liberty driven by the teenage girl.\n\nBoth drivers were pronounced dead at the scene. The driver of the Avalanche was uninjured.\n\nPolice said Pedro Cruz, a Taos County firefighter/EMT, responded to the scene and found his daughter, Maria Elena Cruz, 16, dead upon arrival.\n\nONETIME \u2018AMERICAN IDOL\u2019 CONTESTANT HALEY SMITH, 26, DIES IN MOTORCYCLE CRASH\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s no stranger to going out on calls \u2014 both medical, crashes and other things \u2014 but very traumatic for him to not know but to respond anyway and then find it was his family member,\u201d Taos County Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe said.\n\nThe Sheriff\u2019s Office also suspects speed and intoxication were factors in the accident, though authorities are awaiting a toxicology report from the Office of the Medical Investigator before making any official determination.\n\nCourt records indicate that Harris had a history of drinking and driving. In June 2017, she was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated after records indicated she had a blood alcohol content level of over 0.15, nearly twice the legal limit. Harris was convicted in October 2017 and was ordered to have an ignition interlock device installed in her car.\n\nThe crooner was also cited for speeding in 2014 when she was clocked going 81 in a 60 MPH zone.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nCourt documents obtained by Fox News show Harris was charged in May 2009 with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.
