Commerce officials may have taken a number of steps to pressurize NOAA into supporting the president\u2019s assertions.\u201d\n\nTrump wrote on Twitter on Sept. 1 that \u201cin addition to Florida - South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated\u201d by Dorian, then one of the most powerful Atlantic storms ever.\n\nThe NWS Birmingham office responded on Twitter 20 minutes later writing: \u201cAlabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian. We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama. The system will remain too far east.\u201d\n\nAfter days of controversy, NOAA \u2014 which is part of the Commerce Department \u2014 on Friday released an unsigned statement Friday that suggested the Birmingham tweet \u201cspoke in absolute terms that were inconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available at the time.\u201d\n\nIt referenced a storm probability map that on Sept. 1 forecast a 5-10% chance of tropical storm force winds hitting a small sliver of southeast Alabama.\n\nThe panel seeks all communications between the White House and Commerce related to the Trump Dorian Alabama tweet and the subsequent statement by Sept. 20. It also asks Ross whether Commerce officials issued any threats \u201cemployment-related or otherwise\u201d if the White House or Commerce Department was involved in writing the unsigned statement.\n\nCommerce Department Inspector General Peggy Gustafson is reviewing NOAA\u2019s Friday statement, said Robert Johnson, Gustafson\u2019s chief of staff.\n\nThe New York Times reported Ross threatened to fire top employees after the Birmingham office contradicted Trump and that acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney had directed Ross to order NOAA to disavow the NWS tweet.\n\nTrump denied on Wednesday he had directed Mulvaney to ensure\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross arrives to a meeting at the Planato Palace in Brasilia, Brazil July 31, 2019.
