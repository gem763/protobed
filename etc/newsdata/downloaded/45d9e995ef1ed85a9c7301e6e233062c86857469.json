Sisi has denied holding political prisoners and his backers say the security measures were necessary to stabilise Egypt after its 2011 uprising.\n\nSawy, a long-serving judge and senior prosecutor, was assigned to the technical office of the Cairo Appeals Court in 2015. He later headed the complaints committee of the election commission and investigated corruption cases as a judge.\n\nThe public prosecutor had previously been appointed by the Supreme Judicial Council, the governing body that sits on top of the Egyptian judicial ladder, and approved by the presidency.\n\nOutgoing public prosecutor Nabil Sadek\u2019s four-year term was due to end on Sept. 19.", "description": "Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has selected long-time judiciary official Hamada al-Sawy as public prosecutor, judicial sources said on Thursday, the first such appointment since the constitution was amended earlier this year.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429023339&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B0OY-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
