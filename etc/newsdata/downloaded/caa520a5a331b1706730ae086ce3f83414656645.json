Republicans hold a slim majority in the Senate, where an impeachment ruling would need a two-thirds majority to pass.\n\nBut the process could damage the president\u2019s image as he vies for re-election, with only about 45% of Americans approving of his performance as president, especially if damaging information comes out during public hearings.\n\nIt could also boost Trump if Americans believe Democrats are unfairly targeting the president.\n\nThe S&P 500 closed down 0.84% on Tuesday, hurt partly by the anticipation of Pelosi\u2019s announcement, and Asian shares were weaker on Wednesday because of the possibility of political uncertainty in the world\u2019s largest economy. The dollar nursed losses against most major currencies.\n\nPelosi\u2019s change of heart followed reports that Trump had pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a July 25 telephone call to investigate Biden, the former U.S. vice president, and his son Hunter, who had worked for a company drilling for gas in Ukraine.\n\nTrump has admitted that he discussed Biden and his son in the call, but denied putting any pressure on the Ukrainian leader despite his administration\u2019s withholding of nearly $400 million in military aid approved for Kiev by Congress.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) announces the House of Representatives will launch a formal inquiry to investigate whether to impeach U.S. President Donald Trump following a closed House Democratic caucus meeting at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, U.S., September 24, 2019. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\n\nSupport from House members for impeachment has surged in recent days, fuelled by anger over the Trump administration\u2019s refusal to comply with a law requiring the release of a whistleblower\u2019s complaint over the discussions with Ukraine.\n\nDemocratic Rep. John Yarmuth said that when Pelosi mentioned her phone call with Trump today, she said Trump had told her that \u201che\u2019d like to figure this out,\u201d and Pelosi responded to Trump by saying, \u201cTell your people to obey the law.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Senate voted unanimously on Tuesday, with no objections from Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans, for a resolution calling for the whistleblower\u2019s report to be sent to Congress.\n\nThe House is due to vote on a similar non-binding resolution on Wednesday.\n\nREPUBLICAN SUPPORT\n\nThe White House had refused to hand over the whistleblower\u2019s complaint to Congress but an administration official said late on Tuesday it was now preparing to release it by the end of the week and would most likely allow the whistleblower to meet with congressional investigators.\n\nTrump\u2019s approval among Republicans remains strong. A Sept. 16-20 Reuters/Ipsos poll showed that 82% of registered Republicans approved of his job performance.\n\nKevin McCarthy, the party\u2019s leader in the House, accused Democrats of seeking to overturn the 2016 election. \u201cThis is all about politics. Not about facts,\u201d he said.\n\nPelosi had considered creating a select committee to lead the impeachment inquiry, but instead opted to rely on the House Judiciary, Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and other committees already conducting probes of the Trump administration.\n\nThose investigations will continue and committee leaders will decide whether to hold public hearings.\n\nSeparately, Trump announced on Twitter on Tuesday that he would release a transcript of his telephone call with Zelenskiy.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump ATTENDS a bilateral meeting with Iraq's President Barham Salih on the sidelines of the annual United Nations General Assembly in New York City, New York, U.S., September 24, 2019.
