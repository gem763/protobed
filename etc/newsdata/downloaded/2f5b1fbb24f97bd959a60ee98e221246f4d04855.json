No one is the toady of any other agency.\u201d\n\nBrennan allies and skeptics of the Durham investigation note that the CIA played no role in the probe involving Americans, and was narrowly focused on determining Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s motivations and how the Kremlin was carrying out its election attack in 2016.\n\n\u201cThe CIA was focused on Russia\u2019s interference in the election and the role that Russian officials played,\u201d said Nick Shapiro, who served as Brennan\u2019s chief of staff at the CIA and is now his spokesman. \u201cIn our government, the FBI is who conducts counterintelligence investigations on U.S. citizens. What Barr and Trump are reportedly up to not only doesn\u2019t make any sense whatsoever, but it is yet another dangerous abuse of power, something that seems to now happen on a daily basis in this administration.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny investigation into John Brennan by this corrupt administration must \u2014 on its face \u2014 be viewed with a minimum with maximum skepticism,\u201d said former CIA spokesman George Little. \u201cThe intelligence community deserves the respect of the president and his Cabinet, not politically motivated investigations.\u201d\n\nA source close to the White House said the president has been \u201cwarned repeatedly by smart legal minds around him to stay out of\u201d the investigation. But he also claimed that \u201ca big chunk of the Barr-Durham investigation\u201d is believed to involve \u201ctop Obama administration officials, including Brennan.\u201d\n\nAnother person close to the president said that Brennan is a \u201ctopic of conversation\u201d in the White House. He said he didn\u2019t know for sure whether Trump told Barr to focus on Brennan, but \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised.\u201d\n\nDurham hung up when called by POLITICO and didn\u2019t respond to a follow-up text message. DOJ declined to comment.\n\nAsked for comment, White House deputy press Secretary Hogan Gidley said: \u201cJohn Brennan lied before Congress when he got caught spying on American citizens and lied about having Russian collusion evidence that never existed. The only way I\u2019ve ever heard anyone in the White House mention him is as a punchline.\u201d\n\nBrennan has in the past called Durham a \u201cvery well-respected individual.\u201d But he largely wrote off the ongoing Durham-Barr probe in an interview earlier this month. \u201cI\u2019m supposedly going to be interviewed by Mr. Durham as part of this non-investigation,\u201d Brennan said on MSNBC. \u201cI don\u2019t understand the predication of this worldwide effort to try to uncover dirt\u201d on the 2016 Russia probe.\n\nOne former White House official acknowledged that Brennan\u2019s rhetoric has made him a target. Trump \u201cis hyper-sensitive about any type of criticism of any kind, he\u2019s always got to be the smartest guy, he\u2019s always got to know more than everybody else,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAny investigation into John Brennan by this corrupt administration must \u2014 on its face \u2014 be viewed with a minimum with maximum skepticism.\" - Former CIA spokesman George Little\n\nBrennan has not been understated in his criticism: In July 2018, after Trump sided with Russian President Vladimir Putin over the U.S. intelligence community in a press conference in Helsinki, Finland, Brennan tweeted that Trump was \u201cwholly in the pocket of Putin.\u201d He has also called Trump \u201ctreasonous,\u201d though \u2014after Mueller could not establish that Trump had engaged in a criminal conspiracy with Russia \u2014 he softened his tone, saying he may have received \u201cbad information\u201d about the extent of the Trump campaign\u2019s Russia ties.\n\nWhat little Barr has said about the Durham probe is directly at odds with Brennan\u2019s language. \u201cHow did the bogus narrative begin that Trump was essentially in cahoots with Russia to interfere with the U.S. election?\u201d he said in July, describing one of the questions he hoped to answer.\n\nAs with the IG report, Trump\u2019s allies have been raising expectations for the Durham investigation for months, predicting that he will uncover a deep state plot to stage a \u201ccoup\u201d against the president. Durham and Barr have been focusing primarily on the intelligence community\u2014reportedly seeking interviews with the CIA analysts who drew conclusions about Putin\u2019s motivations in 2016\u2014and have not requested interviews with any of the senior FBI or DOJ employees who were directly involved in the opening of the Russia investigation in 2016, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nBarr has also been fixated on the question of how the intelligence community determined that Russia intervened specifically to help Trump win rather than to just sow chaos and distrust in the Democratic process, according to the New York Times. But as POLITICO first reported, that question has already been asked and answered at the CIA\u2019s highest levels \u2014 by Mike Pompeo, a Trump loyalist.\n\nJust after Pompeo took over as CIA director in 2017, he conducted a personal review of the CIA\u2019s findings, grilling analysts on their conclusions in a challenging and at times combative interview, people familiar with the matter said. He ultimately found no evidence of any wrongdoing, or that the analysts had been under political pressure to produce their findings.\n\nThe intelligence community also released a joint assessment in January 2017 concluding that Putin directed a wide-ranging interference campaign aimed at harming Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy, and Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report detailed dozens of contacts between the Trump campaign and Russians in 2016.\n\nTrump has refused to accept the intelligence community\u2019s conclusions, however, instead pointing the finger at Ukraine, the Obama administration, and the private cybersecurity firm that confirmed the Russians had hacked the Democratic National Committee.\n\nIronically, Barr\u2019s long Washington career began at the CIA, he noted in the same oral history interview, at a time when the intelligence community was under assault from congressional Democrats who believed the agency had run amok in part by spying on the domestic political activities of American citizens.\n\nAs a young lawyer in the CIA\u2019s office of legislative counsel, Barr helped the agency contain what it saw as damaging overreach by Capitol Hill. In testimony before his 1991 confirmation as attorney general, he described his role as \u201canalyzing the impact of proposed legislation on Agency operations, drafting Agency bill comments, drafting Hill testimony, carrying on liaison with congressional committee staffs.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s also no stranger to interagency battles: It was Barr who recommended that Bush oust FBI director William Sessions, who was accused of serious misconduct in an internal DOJ watchdog report. Barr was ultimately vindicated when Bill Clinton, a successor he disdained for what he called his defects of character, removed Sessions in 1993.\n\nOne veteran Washington Republican who has worked with Barr in past administrations and previously respected him said that he has been surprised and disappointed in Barr, describing him as a \u201chenchman\u201d for Trump.\n\nAnd intelligence veterans affiliated with both parties have leapt to the defense of their former colleagues, noting that it wasn\u2019t just the CIA that was concerned about Moscow\u2019s support for the Trump campaign.\n\n\u201cTalk about witch hunts!\u201d said former CIA director Michael Hayden, who served during the George W. Bush administration. \u201cThis is a perfect example of that. Russian interference in the 2016 election was the judgment of the entire intelligence community. And it remains so today.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["-", "Former Cia Spokesman George Little"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/8c/80/4ca6004c473bb21bc6288c4aa62e/20191021-john-brennan-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
