In a campaign video released on Wednesday, the representative from Hawaii accused the DNC and their \u201ccorporate media\u201d partners of attempting to \u201crig the 2020 primary\u201d against early-state voters. The events aren\u2019t true debates, Gabbard declared, but \u201ccommercialized reality television\u201d (via Townhall):\n\nI am seriously considering boycotting October 15 debate to bring attention to DNC/corporate media\u2019s effort to rig 2020 primary. Not against Bernie this time, but against voters in early states Iowa, New Hampshire, South\u2026 \u2013> https://t.co/x5P3GFGbyn pic.twitter.com/UgKCj6DGI0 \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) October 10, 2019\n\nThat\u2019s quite a list of complaints for someone who actually qualified for the debate tomorrow. That\u2019s not to say that Gabbard\u2019s wrong in every instance. She\u2019s certainly correct that these aren\u2019t really debates as much as they are the rhetorical equivalent of gladiatorial combat, but Gabbard didn\u2019t seem to mind that much when she swung a figurative mace upside Kamala Harris\u2019 head in July. Harris has never recovered from that blow, and she might have been the happiest about Gabbard\u2019s proposed boycott.\n\nAs for the DNC \u201crigging\u201d the contest through polls \u2026 meh. The DNC has few measures to consider when limiting participation on stage, and polls are arguably the most \u201cdemocratic\u201d of them. The other measure is donors, which isn\u2019t exactly broadly \u201cdemocratic\u201d either. The only other options are regular Democratic caucuses in each state to determine who gets on stage \u2014 which would bankrupt the party \u2014 or to let everyone on stage. If Gabbard thinks these are ridiculous \u201ccommercialized reality television\u201d events now, try that option and see what happens.\n\nBut would Gabbard, currently at 0.7% in RCP\u2019s aggregate polling, really sacrifice the opportunity of a nationally televised appearance to make a stand for her principles? Of course she wouldn\u2019t:\n\nI will be attending the debate. \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) October 14, 2019\n\nIn other words, this was an extended publicity stunt. That\u2019s too bad, because if Gabbard had been serious and objected on the proper terms, perhaps both the DNC and RNC might have reconsidered their debate strategies. The better method for primary debates with a crowded field is to pair off candidates and have them debate each other for limited periods of time. That would allow each candidate roughly the same amount of time to address the nation without forcing them into political stunts to grab attention. Gabbard\u2019s not far off the mark about debates being nothing more than entertainment; game shows are a closer model to what we have now than reality television, but YMMV.\n\nAnyway, Gabbard now says she\u2019ll participate, and that has to make Joe Biden pretty happy. It doesn\u2019t hurt to have your wingman on stage, only this time perhaps Gabbard will take aim at Elizabeth Warren rather than Harris.
