This is the first-ever energy drink from the company, and all versions will include 114 milligrams of caffeine per 12-ounce serving.\n\nThe cherry flavor will only be in the U.S. because \u201cAmericans love Cherry Coke!\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nCoke Energy first launched in Spain, and by July the product had captured 2% share of the energy category, Chief Executive James Quincey said on the second-quarter earnings call. The drink is sold in 25 countries across Europe. There\u2019s a limited edition cinnamon flavor coming for the holidays, and new flavors, like cherry vanilla and orange vanilla, in the pipeline.\n\nSee: Impossible Burger couldn\u2019t be sold in supermarkets until company secured FDA approval of game-changing ingredient\n\nOn the second-quarter analysts call, Quincey said the information from the \u201c1.0\u201d rollout in Europe will aid with the \u201c2.0\u201d launch in the U.S.\n\n\u201cThis is a major national launch, which suggests Coke Energy is likely performing well in Europe,\u201d wrote Evercore ISI analysts in a note. They think this is \u201ca potentially highly disruptive development for an increasingly competitive U.S. energy drink category.\u201d\n\nThe category includes Red Bull and Monster Energy. Evercore rates Coca-Cola stock outperform with a $60 price target. Analysts are \u201ccautious\u201d about Monster Beverage Corp. MNST, +0.96%\n\nEvercore says Coca-Cola Energy will be placed \u201cas far from Monster Energy as possible. Coca-Cola emphasized the product is not targeted at Monster Energy.\u201d The American Arbitration Association gave the green light for Coca-Cola Energy\u2019s launch, with the group finding that it wouldn\u2019t break the terms of a contract that Coca-Cola has with Monster.\n\nOn a per-ounce basis, Evercore says pricing will be between Red Bull\u2019s premium pricing and the mainstream pricing of brands like Rockstar.\n\n\u201cSome cannibalization of regular Coke expected based on early results in Europe,\u201d wrote Evercore. \u201cNet, it\u2019s a positive given higher price points and profitability.\u201d In Europe there has been \u201climited cannibalization of regular Coke, [and it\u2019s] growing the category, primarily sourcing share from Red Bull.\u201d\n\nCredit Suisse analysts think the launch so far in Europe shows that there will be \u201climited cannibalization to Monster,\u201d but the new brand could be coming for Red Bull.\n\n\u201c\u2019Picture of success\u2019 is placement in energy cooler next to Red Bull,\u201d Credit Suisse wrote. Credit Suisse rates Coca-Cola stock neutral with a $54 price target.\n\nCoca-Cola has an average overweight stock rating, according to 24 analysts polled by FactSet. The average price target is $57.64.\n\nRead: Pepsi\u2019s $1 billion green bond pits it in growing ranks of big companies selling debt for climate change\n\nHere\u2019s what to watch for in Coca-Cola\u2019s earnings:\n\nEarnings: FactSet forecasts earnings per share of 56 cents, down from 58 cents last year.\n\nEstimize, which crowd sources estimates from sell-side and buy-side analysts, hedge-fund managers, executives, academics and others, expects per-share earnings of 58 cents.\n\nCoca-Cola has exceeded FactSet earnings expectations the last nine quarters.\n\nRevenue: FactSet expects sales of $9.43 billion, up from $8.26 billion last year.\n\nEstimize is guiding for sales of $9.53 billion.\n\nCoca-Cola has beaten the FactSet sales outlook the last dozen quarters.\n\nStock price: Coca-Cola stock is up 2.5% for the last three months, and has rallied 13% for the year to date.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.34% is up 15.8% for the year to date.\n\nWatch: Could paying farmers to sequester carbon reverse climate change?\n\nOther items:\n\n-Sparkling beverages are doing well, according to Credit Suisse.\n\n\u201cThis is a direct benefit of strategy put in place a few years ago, including a shift in focus from volume to revenue growth,\u201d analysts wrote in a note following meeting with Coca-Cola investor relations in late September.\n\n-Jefferies thinks the third-quarter will be in line with expectations.\n\n\u201cDespite pockets of weakness (e.g. Argentina, Middle East, Mexico), we believe Q3 should be another strong quarter for Coca-Cola as it builds on recent momentum under CEO James Quincey\u2019s leadership,\u201d analysts wrote.\n\nStill, analysts think the strength of the dollar could weigh on earnings estimates.\n\nJefferies rates Coca-Cola stock hold with a $56 price target.", "description": "Analysts think Coca-Cola Energy has done well in Europe, though there could be some cannibalization.", "authors": ["Tonya Garcia"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT491_cokeen_MG_20191017084057.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
