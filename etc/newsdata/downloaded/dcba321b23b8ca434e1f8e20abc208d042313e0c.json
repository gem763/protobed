The volume of the purchases hasn\u2019t been finalized but may be around 100,000 tons, some of which will be for state reserves, the people said.\n\nFutures on the S&P 500 extended gains, while the and the Hong Kong pared declines. The Australian currency pared losses against the dollar to trade little changed and the yen deepened declines.\n\nThe imports may be part of China\u2019s efforts to ease tensions with the U.S. as they strive to reach a trade deal. They also come at a time when the Asian nation, the world\u2019s biggest pork consumer, desperately needs more of the meat. China has already boosted pork imports from the U.S., with July imports at the highest in two years, as the government also makes purchases for its state reserves.\n\nChina\u2019s commerce ministry didn\u2019t immediately respond to a fax seeking comment. U.S. and Chinese officials held working-level negotiations earlier this month and are aiming for a high-level meeting around Oct. 10. Beijing will continue to exempt U.S. farm goods including soybeans and pork from additional tariffs, state-run Xinhua cited the commerce ministry and National Development and Reform Commission as saying on Tuesday.\n\nPrices of pork have surged more than 70% this year in China due to the spread of a deadly pig disease, prompting Beijing to become increasingly concerned about its potential to mar celebrations for the 70th anniversary of Communist Party rule on Oct. 1.\n\nChina\u2019s seen an almost 40% plunge in hog numbers as the impact of African swine fever worsened. Chinese Vice Premier Hu Chunhua has warned that the supply situation will be \u201cextremely severe\u201d through to the first half of 2020, and that the country is likely to have a pork shortage of 10 million tons this year, more than the roughly 8 million tons in annual global trade.\n\n(Adds market moves in third paragraph.)\n\nTo contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Niu Shuping in Beijing at nshuping@bloomberg.net;Steven Yang in Beijing at kyang74@bloomberg.net;Jenny Leonard in Washington at jleonard67@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Anna Kitanaka at akitanaka@bloomberg.net, Sharon Chen\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "China Prepares\u00a0to Buy More U.S. Pork as Trade Talks Revive", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picc8fd252f07867322803bc76efb15fafb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
