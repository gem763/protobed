He was admitted to New Marathi Primary school and the K. J. Somaiyya Secondary School in Shrirampur.\n\nAfter showings his skills with the ball and making quite an impression in school, he started playing in the local Revenue Colony Cricket Club (RCC) in Shrirampur after which he started his career in Pune.\n\nDon't Miss 120 SHARES 3.1 K SHARES 259 SHARES\n\nEarly Life\n\nGetty Images\n\nOne of India's finest fast bowlers, Zaheer Khan was born on 7 October,1978, in Diamabad, Ahmednagar District, Maharashtra. He was born to Zakia and Bakhtiyar Khan. Zaheer Khan got his primary education from New Marathi Primary school and later went to K. J. Somaiyya Secondary School.\n\nThe interest in cricket came to him at a very early age, and it began an obsession with the game that would turn him into one of India's most revered fast bowlers.\n\nEarly Career\n\nReuters\n\nIn 1996, Zaheer Khan came to Mumbai, and joined the National Cricket Club that played in Division A in the city. He played in various competitions for the team, and was very impressive with both bowl and bat. Although playing solely as a front-line bowler, Zaheer used to score handy runs lower down the order which made him a very valuable player to the team.\n\nAfter terrific performances, he was later sent to the MRF Pace Foundation in Chennai by Sudhir Naik, owner of the National Cricket Club. Impressed by his talent, the bowling coach there, T. A. Sekhar, pushed Khan to play for Baroda.\n\nIt was in the 2000-01 season of the Ranji Trophy that Zaheer came into the limelight with his pace and swing. Against Railways, Zaheer received the man of the match award after he returned figures of 8/145 for the match, including a five-wicket haul in the second innings (5/16), helping his team lift the trophy for the fifth time and a first in 43 years.\n\nHis brilliant season with the ball was rewarded with his first international call-up and made his ODI debut against Kenya in ICC KnockOut Trophy. And a month later he made his Test debut against Bangladesh. After impressing with the ability to swing it both ways, and also having the pace to trouble the batsmen, he found a place in the 2003 World Cup.\n\nHe had a decent tournament as India finished runners up to Australia. A few years later, Zaheer Khan struggled with inconsistent form and found it difficult to cement a place. In 2005, with new players like RP Singh and Sreesanth making their debuts and impressing early on, Zaheer's path back was blocked.\n\nZaheer Khan transferred to Mumbai at the start of the 2006\u201307 Indian cricket domestic season.\n\nHe fought his way back though, and was part of the 2007 World Cup squad that made a shock group-stage exit at the tournament. Later that year, he was omitted from the squad for the inaugural T20 World Cup which India went on to win. From the following year, Zaheer became the mainstay in the team and was impressive in both ODIs and Tests.\n\n2011 World Cup and Retirement\n\nAFP\n\nZaheer saved his best for the 2011 World Cup. In the subcontinent, being a pace bowler can be a bane, and in limited overs cricket, with flat decks, there is no mercy from the batsmen. But Zaheer bowled out of his skin in the tournament and helped India to win the World Cup.\n\nHe was the leading wicket taker with 22 scalps along with Shahid Afridi. Zaheer had shown tremendous skill and made the use of 'knuckle ball' which troubled the batsman throughout the tournament. He is often called the first improviser of the knuckle ball.\n\nZaheer again struggled to maintain his spot in the side, and finally called time on his successful career in 2014. Zaheer ended with 311 Test wickets in 92 matches, at an average of just over 32 runs per wicket. The second most for an Indian fast bowler after Kapil Dev's 434. He also played in 200 ODIs for India, taking 282 wickets.\n\nHe has since retired, and now is a cricket commentator.", "description": "Zaheer Khan is a former Indian cricketer who played as a fast bowler for the Indian cricket team.
