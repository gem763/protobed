But speaking after organisers claimed a million marched for a 'People's Vote', he suggested it was worth the wait because the question is \"fundamental\".\n\nThe Shadow Brexit Secretary told the BBC: \"Of course we need an amendment to say that whatever deal gets through, it should be subject to a referendum.\n\n\"Where that deal is put to the public and they\u2019re asked 'do you want to leave on these terms, or would you rather remain in the EU'.\"\n\nSir Keir said any amendment would most likely come from campaigning backbench MPs - such as Labour's Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson.\n\nAsked If Labour would then back it, he replied: \"Yes. Almost every victory we've had on anything in the last three years has come from the back benches.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nAsked to confirm if Labour would whip MPs to vote for such an amendment he replied: \"We've already voted I think three times as a party for a second referendum with a three line whip behind it and that is the clear policy.\n\n\"Whether it's this deal or any future deal, it's got to go back [to] the public.\"\n\nShadow Chancellor John McDonnell told Sky News: \u201cThat will almost inevitably come up. There was an amendment tabled on Saturday. We\u2019ve always said, let the people decide.\u201d\n\nSir Keir added: \"A growing number of people believe now the only way to truly settle this is to ask - do you want to leave on these terms or would you rather remain?\"\n\nMPs forced Boris Johnson last night to send a letter to the EU asking for a three-month delay to Brexit.\n\nIn a political stunt that could be fought in court the PM refused to sign the letter, and sent another at the same time branding a delay \"corrosive\".\n\nDespite the setback the Prime Minister is planning to push on and attempt to pass his Brexit deal by October 31 anyway.\n\n(Image: Kiran Ridley)\n\nTo do that he needs to pass a law called the Withdrawal Agreement Bill (WAB) which will begin its journey through the House of Commons on Tuesday.\n\nThe government will also try to have a single 'meaningful vote' on whether to accept Boris Johnson's deal on Monday afternoon.\n\nIt's the WAB that MPs will use to attach conditions to Boris Johnson's Brexit deal as it passes through Parliament.\n\nSir Keir said he expected \"dozens\" of amendments - including ones tabled by Labour to attach a customs union with the EU and single market alignment.\n\nToday the DUP suggested it could back a shared single customs union. Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson said: \"The DUP wants to 'get Brexit done' but it must be a Brexit for the whole of the United Kngdom.\"\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nDespite saying Labour will back a second referendum amendment, Sir Keir refused to say exactly what form that would take.\n\nBecause of the way the law works, Labour could in theory end up backing an amended version of Boris Johnson's deal - on the condition it is put back to the people in a vote.\n\nThat risks prompting a major row at the highest levels of the party, where shadow ministers are pressing Jeremy Corbyn to take a pro-Remain stance.\n\nSir Keir would not comment on whether backing Boris Johnson's deal with conditions would be the end result, saying: \"I don\u2019t know I really don\u2019t know because things are moving so fast.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nSir Keir said any decision this week would not be the final step. \"There will be an amendment on a referendum,\" he said.\n\n\"Whether there will be detailed amendments put next week for the whole of the referendum I don\u2019t know, there\u2019s a lot of discussions going on.\n\n\"But the principle is very very clear.\"\n\nAny referendum could throw plans for a general election, which Labour wants, into limbo. It was put to Sir Keir that that could last six months.\n\nHe replied: \"I accept that\u2019s probably the timeframe. It could be shortened a bit but probably not much.\n\n\"But this is such a fundamental question that we have to press this point about a referendum.\"\n\nLabour has furiously attacked the deal Boris Johnson brought back from Brussels last week for watering down commitments on workers' rights and setting up a border down the Irish Sea.\n\nSir Keir said Labour would table a string of amendments in the coming week in a bid to fix problems in the deal and \"close\" a \"trapdoor\" that could allow no deal to slip through when a transition ends in December 2020.\n\n\"It is essential that we expose this deal for what it is,\" he said. \"It\u2019s a deal that fundamentally changes our economy.\"\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nTory no-deal planning chief Michael Gove vowed to leave on October 31 - despite Boris Johnson having to ask for a delay.\n\nThe Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster told Sky News: \"We are going to leave by October 31. We have the means and the ability to do so.\"\n\nMr Gove, who will chair a meeting of the 'XO' no-deal planning committee later today, refused to comment on whether Boris Johnson has been privately telling EU leaders he does not want an extension.\n\nHe said the Government has triggered the next stage of Operation Yellowhammer no-deal plans because the delay request had increased the chances of leaving without a pact.\n\nHe added: \"If we vote to leave, if we get the legislation through, then there is no extension - October 31 is within sight.\"\n\nAnd he even revealed he'd made a bet about Brexit with Health Secretary Matt Hancock. Sources later insisted the bet - for a bottle of wine - was about the majority for the WAB, not whether Brexit would happen at all.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nMeanwhile there was a boost for the PM as Amber Rudd - who quit the Cabinet and Tories to block no-deal - said she would back his deal.\n\nShe told the BBC's Andrew Marr: \"I want to support it and I will.\n\n\"And I think, not all of us, but most of us [21] former Conservatives, who supported the Letwin amendment will do so as well.\"", "description": "Shadow Brexit Secretary said Labour will back a bid for a second referendum when MPs attempt to attach it to Boris Johnson's Brexit deal", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Image", "Pa", "Kiran Ridley", "Afp Getty Images", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20658790.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Brexit.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
