With the construction of the mausoleum progressing within the defined timeframe, all patriotic Zimbabweans were shocked to learn that the remains of the former President had been surreptitiously taken yesterday (Thursday) to Zvimba for a private burial on Saturday 28 September 2019.\n\nAround 200 people attended the funeral service, while only family members were present for his private burial. No senior ZANU-PF officials nor Zimbabwe\u2019s current president and Mugabe\u2019s former deputy, Emmerson Mnangagwa, were present at the service after they successfully ousted him from office in late 2017.\n\nVarious family members spoke at the service, including Mugabe\u2019s sister in law Shuvai Gumbochuma, who revealed it was his dying wish to be buried in his hometown.\n\n\u201cI spoke to him personally as to why he would not want to be buried at the national hero\u2019s acre, he said to me \u2018I was humiliated\u2019. I immediately stopped the discussion thereafter,\u201d Grace\u2019s sister Shuvai Gumbochuma said. \u201cI know they will say this was a decision of the wife, but what I know is that this was his wish.\u201d\n\nMugabe\u2019s nephew Walter Chidhakwa also said they had honored his uncle\u2019s wishes. \u201cWhat has happened here was [Mugabe\u2019s] wishes,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we had discussions the burial issue was non-negotiable. We want to say thank you to president Emmerson Mnangagwa for respecting his wishes.\u201d\n\nMugabe, who died this month aged 95, led Zimbabwe as a far-left dictator for 40-year\u2019s following its liberation from the British Empire. His tenure was marked with bloodshed, persecution of political opponents, and widespread rigging of elections. He also plunged the country, once known as one of the wealthiest in Africa, into an unprecedented economic disaster so severe that the government introduced a trillion-dollar note before eventually reverting to the U.S. dollar.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "The family of the former Zimbabwean dictator Robert Mugabe smuggled him to his hometown holding a low-key burial this weekend in Zvimba.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/GettyImages-1171761087-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
