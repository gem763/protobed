Most such visits prove uneventful. A few, like one over the weekend in Fort Worth, Texas, end up with someone getting killed by police.\n\nExperts in law enforcement training and tactics say there is a multitude of questions raised by the shooting of 28-year-old Atatiana Jefferson, who was cut down at her home by a bullet fired through a window by an officer responding to a call in the middle of the night about her front door being open.\n\nAmong the questions: Did the neighbor who made the call see or hear something that raised alarm bells? What, if anything, happened that made the officer believe there was an imminent threat? Why not just knock on the door and announce that a police officer was there?\n\nExperts say there\u2019s no one correct way for officers to respond to such calls. It can depend on a number of variables. At police academies around the country, recruits spend hours being put through simulations of a variety of calls designed to show them ways to de-escalate situations or prevent unjustified shootings.\n\nIn this case, Fort Worth police and the mayor said Monday that there was nothing to justify the officer firing his weapon; the police chief said he was prepared to fire the officer, Aaron Dean, 34, but he resigned first. Dean had been on the force for a year and a half.\n\nThe very nature of the call \u2014 made to a non-emergency line and not reporting any crime in progress \u2014 might suggest it would be simple and straightforward. But Maria Haberfeld, an expert in police training and procedures and a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, said many factors must be taken into consideration, such as whether police have had previous trouble at a certain address or neighborhood, or whether the officer heard or saw something that appeared to pose an immediate threat.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t completely dismiss the possible danger in a wellness call. It\u2019s not clear-cut, black and white in that sense,\u201d she said.\n\nFort Worth police said officers responded about 2:25 a.m. Saturday. Video from the officer bodycam shows him walking around the home, holding a flashlight, and then standing outside a window.\n\nPolice said in a statement that officers saw someone near a window inside the home and that one of them drew his gun and fired after \u201cperceiving a threat.\u201d On the video released by police, one officer shouts, \u201cPut your hands up! Show me your hands!\u201d then fires a split-second later.\n\nThe video does not show that Dean identified himself as a police officer. It is also not clear what, if anything, he saw happening inside the home, where family members said Jefferson had been playing video games late into the night with her 8-year-old nephew.\n\nThe bodycam video released to media included images of a gun inside a bedroom. Interim police Chief Ed Kraus said Monday that he did not know if Jefferson was holding the weapon and that the mere fact she had a firearm in her home was not sufficient justification for the shooting and shouldn\u2019t be considered unusual in Texas.\n\nAnother officer was there with Dean but did not fire her gun. The police chief said she is being treated as a witness.\n\nAn attorney for the family and some relatives called for an independent investigation and demanded Dean\u2019s arrest. Police said they are looking into charges.\n\nAgencies routinely get calls asking police to stop by an address to check on someone. Increasingly, some police departments are referring non-emergency calls to social workers or others who aren\u2019t in law enforcement, to avoid escalating a situation by having someone with a gun show up, said Tom Manger, who retired this year as a police chief in Maryland after four decades in law enforcement.\n\n\u201cThis call that this officer went on? That day, there were probably thousands of other cops that went to a similar call and nothing happened. It was figured out. It was resolved. It was handled with no problems at all,\u201d Manger said. \u201cThey are trained to be cautious but not overreact. And that\u2019s what they have to determine, why this officer did what he did.\u201d\n\nManger said he has been on calls in which the responding officer approached with his or her hand on a firearm, and other calls when the officer drew a weapon right away. In some of those cases, he said, he thought to himself: \u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a great idea. What if you\u2019re startled and it\u2019s not something bad but you\u2019re just startled?\u201d\n\nOfficers arriving on the scene in such situations typically check to see if the door had been broken in or if there are other signs around the house of forced entry or something untoward happening inside. They have to decide whether to knock or whether that would be too risky. They have to figure out whether to call for backup.\n\nThose examining the shooting are likely to take up the same questions. Ultimately, they may look at whether the shooting resulted from some larger problem, such as poor training.\n\n\u201cThe real question in this thing that the officer is going to have to explain is what they thought was the immediate threat that necessitated deadly force,\u201d said Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, which provides research and guidance on police practices.", "description": "On any given day in the U.S., police respond to thousands of non-emergency calls asking them to check on someone's home.
