The impact would be \"dramatic,\" the trade group said.\n\nHigher prices \"will hit Americans in the wallet just as the holiday season is approaching,\" the group said. \"The cheese/charcuterie board that currently cost you $45 will put you back $60 after tariffs. The treats you provide your family to celebrate Thanksgiving and the year-end holidays may become out of reach.\"\n\nSingle-malt whisky represented over half of the total value of British products on the U.S. tariff list, amounting to over $460 million, according to the Scotch Whisky Association.\n\nShares in European luxury goods, including British fashion brand Burberry Group Plc <BRBY.L>, and drinks companies, such as France\u2019s Remy Cointreau SA <RCOP.PA>, rose on Thursday, after the tariffs excluded cognac, Champagne and leather goods.\n\nThis week's tariffs on Scotch whisky, liqueurs and cordials, and wine could affect nearly $3.4 billion in imports \"and could lead to a loss of approximately 13,000 U.S. jobs, including truckers, farmers, and bartenders and servers in the hospitality industry,\" the Distilled Spirits Council said.\n\nJos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, a Spanish-born Michelin-starred chef who has helped provide millions of meals in areas hit by natural disasters and owns more than a dozen U.S. restaurants, criticized the tariffs on Twitter on Thursday, saying it \"will affect not only rural economies in Europe, but thousands of small American businesses all over!\"\n\nHe urged U.S. President Donald Trump to reconsider: \"You are a Deal Maker? A businessman! If you can negotiate with enemies, do it with allies first.\"In June 2018, the EU imposed 25% tariffs on American whiskey in response to U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs. The EU is now considering more tariffs on additional U.S. spirits and U.S. wine as part of a separate WTO civil aviation investigation.\n\nSince the new EU tariffs, American whiskey exports have declined 21 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Peter Cooney)", "description": "New 25% U.S. tariffs on Italian cheese, French wine, Scotch whisky, British biscuits, Spanish olives and thousands of other European food products will lead to higher prices ahead of the holiday season and cost American jobs, trade groups said on Thursday.
