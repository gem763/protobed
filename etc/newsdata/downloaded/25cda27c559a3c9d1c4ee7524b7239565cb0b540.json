We\u2019ll see. This week I am testing a sleep robot (\u00a3549, meetsomnox.com) that aims to banish insomnia, aiding natural rest and reducing stress. It is an example of soft robotics, and could be revolutionary in the field: most tech is hard-edged, and many overnight devices merely track sleep rather than promoting it. Somnox describes itself as a \u201csleep companion.\u201d The kidney-shaped, possibly sentient cushion breathes softly in and out, and plays calming noises. The idea is that users hold it close to them in bed, building up an emotional bond over time. Every night, you breathe together in time until you fall sleep, perchance to dream of electric sheep.\n\nThere is obvious industry and sophistication here. The product is made of high-quality material, with nothing extraneous in the design. It is heavy \u2013 like organic-material heavy. It is the weight of a baby. And it is comforting, cushioned with foam and soft, thick fabric. We climb into bed and I switch it on. A warm light within the fabric comes to life, pulsing in and out. The robot has a soft belly part, which gently expands and deflates, with a noise like a discreet ventilator. I start getting a strange feeling in my belly, too. \u201cCreating life is our design philosophy\u201d is the chilling strapline printed on the \u201cbirth certificate\u201d included with each purchase. \u201cIt took us nine months to create your new sleep companion, just like a real baby.\u201d (I hope the process wasn\u2019t exactly the same.) It is a weird timeframe. Nine months to R&D, prototype, test and market a complex robot sounds insufficient. Unless they are talking about the manufacture of the specific item I am holding, in which case that is way too long. You couldn\u2019t scale a cookie business if each biscuit took a month to make.\n\nCreating life may be Somnox\u2019s focus; I wish it was creating apps. Their one doesn\u2019t work, at least not after the firmware update I installed. The Bluetooth pairing with the robot dropped a few times, and needed to be reinstated; eventually, the app and device stopped recognising each other completely.\n\nWhile it was working, I tried the deep sleep exercise: essentially a timed breathing pattern of longer exhalations. (The other options are nap and relaxation modes.) I selected a few of the soothing musical options, which include \u201cforest walk\u201d, \u201cpink noise\u201d and \u201ccosmic moon\u201d but they didn\u2019t work. Each time, an identical mechanical wheeze emerged from the speaker in perfect sync with the breathing. Like being in bed with a baby Darth Vader. The robot has CO 2 sensors in its head, which adapt to the user\u2019s breathing to help slow it down. But I had to cover the device with the duvet to muffle the maddening noise. My breathing was getting more and more rapid with irritation anyway, until I turned the thing off. This happened the next night, too, and then the app packed up entirely. I was quite relieved, as it had been keeping me awake.\n\nWithout the in-app exercises, the device still works. Is it nice? It\u2019s more \u2026 odd, this breathing baby-weight. More useful in the daytime, when noise issues aren\u2019t so big an issue. I don\u2019t have a cat, so used this as a substitute, sitting it on my lap with a bowl of minestrone while I watched Friends \u2013 I am aware how lonely this sounds; can we not focus on that? \u2013 and the weight was soothing. The delicate rasp could be purring. If anything, it is slightly more affectionate than a couple of cats I could care to mention, and didn\u2019t wake me up with a claw to the nostril. But frankly I would take the claw, or the empty bed, over this witchetty grub herald of post-human dystopia.\n\nThe sleep robot feels like an uncomfortable blurring of categories. Soft robotics is not yet a gamechanger in the field of, er, night-time technology and I am glad. I like my robots hard, so they have no place in my bed. Others will have different needs. They may come to rely on Somnox for comfort. I would rather spoon a fork. Not the other way round, I stress.\n\nThe Times They Are a-Brandin\n\nIt is weird to have a product that comes with a birth certificate AND a manifesto. But maybe all babies should have a manifesto? Never too soon to gain that competitive edge.\n\nWellness or hellness?\n\nHard no-bot. 2/5", "description": "The kidney-shaped cushion comes with a birth certificate and mirrors your breathing patterns to help you nod off.
