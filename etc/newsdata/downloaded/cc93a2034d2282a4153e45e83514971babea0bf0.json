REUTERS/Amr Abdallah Dalsh\n\nThe airline said inbound traffic to Hong Kong in August had fallen by 38% and outbound traffic by 12% compared with the previous year, and it did not anticipate September would be any less difficult.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s finance secretary reported earlier this week that visitor arrivals plunged nearly 40% in August, deepening from July\u2019s 5% fall, as sometimes violent anti-government protests took a rising toll on the city\u2019s tourism, retail and hotel businesses.\n\nThe weak demand and cuts to capacity will place more pressure on Cathay at a time when it is grappling with management upheaval and is trying to complete a three-year financial turnaround plan driven by boosting revenue and slashing costs.\n\n\u201cGiven the current significant decline in forward bookings for the remainder of the year, we will make some short-term tactical measures such as capacity realignments,\u201d Cathay Chief Customer and Commercial Officer Ronald Lam said in a statement.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, we are reducing our capacity growth such that it will be slightly down year-on-year for the 2019 winter season (from end October 2019 to end March 2020) versus our original growth plan of more than 6% for the period.\u201d\n\nCathay has become the biggest corporate casualty of anti-government protests after China demanded it suspend staff involved in, or who support, demonstrations that have plunged the former British colony into a political crisis.\n\nChairman John Slosar announced plans last week to step down in November, less than three weeks after CEO Rupert Hogg left amid mounting regulatory scrutiny.\n\nCathay said on Wednesday demand for premium class travel had fallen more significantly than for leisure travel, with demand from mainland China and Northeast Asia severely hit, although Australia and New Zealand were more positive.\n\nThe carrier said lower travel demand, an increased mix of transit passengers and the negative impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar had placed passenger yields, a measure of the average fare paid per kilometre per passenger, under further pressure.\n\n\u201cWe expect airfares to continue to fall in coming months as Cathay struggles to maintain load factors within reasonable bounds,\u201d BOCOM International analyst Luya You said, in reference to a measure of the percentage of seats filled. \u201cIn terms of earnings, the second half may be notably dismal considering plummeting yields across all classes.\u201d\n\nTransit passengers are typically less lucrative for airlines because they face competition from more rival carriers than for non-stop flights, which places pressure on pricing.\n\nThe load factor fell by 7.2 percentage points to 79.9% in August, Cathay said. The amount of cargo carried fell by 14% amid a weak global market for air freight and the effects of tropical storms and disruptions at Hong Kong airport.", "description": "Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd <0293.HK> said on Wednesday it would cut capacity for the upcoming winter season after reporting an 11.3% fall in passenger numbers for August as anti-government protests in Hong Kong hit demand.", "authors": ["Jamie Freed", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428625998&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A0M6", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
