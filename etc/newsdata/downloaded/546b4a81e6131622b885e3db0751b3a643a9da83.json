The sixth pick in this year's draft began New York's comeback with a 75-yard TD pass to Evan Engram on the first play of the second half, and a 7-yarder to Sterling Shepard midway through the third quarter.\n\nWinston threw TD passes of 21, 3 and 20 yards to Mike Evans to help Tampa Bay build a 28-10 halftime lead. His 44-yard completion to the Giants 9 set up the last-second field goal try by Gay, who also missed an extra point and had another blocked.\n\nJones, making his first NFL start in place of benched two-time Super Bowl MVP Eli Manning, completed 23 of 36 passes. With Saquon Barkley exiting with a right ankle injury late in the first half, Jones also led the Giants with 28 yards rushing on four attempts.\n\nAfter falling awkwardly on a six-yard reception, New York running back Saquon Barkley was forced to exit the game during the second quarter.

Shaquil Barrett had four of Tampa Bay's five sacks and forced a fumble that led to a field goal that put Tampa Bay up 31-25 with six minutes to go.\n\nJones also lost a fumble that led to one of Winston's TD passes to Evans, who finished with eight catches for 190 yards.\n\nEngram's long catch and run was the highlight of a six-catch, 113-yard performance. Shepard, back in the lineup after missing the previous game with a concussion, had seven catches for 100 yards, including a 36-yarder that set up the winning touchdown.\n\nJones played one series in New York's season-opening loss to Dallas. Manning replaced Kurt Warner after the ninth game of his rookie season in 2004 and started 232 of New York's next 233 regular-season games. The Giants averaged 420 yards on offence in the first two games this year, but only scored four touchdowns while averaging 15.5 points.\n\nThe 38-year-old Manning was Jones' backup, but did not accompany New York's other captains to midfield for the pregame coin toss.", "description": "The Daniel Jones era is off to a rousing start for the New York Giants.
