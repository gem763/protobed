efforts to monitor a range of policies on issues such as air quality, tackling plastic pollution and meeting net zero climate goals.\n\nHowever, some environmentalists are concerned it will not have proper funding to scrutinise laws, investigate complaints and take enforcement action properly.\n\nConservative peer Lord Randall, who previously advised Theresa May on green issues, told the BBC: \u201cI can see it might look silly if one government body fines another, but it would be a very powerful weapon\u201d.\n\nThe long-awaited Bill, which will also enshrine environmental principles in law, is not likely to make progress as a general election is expected to be called in the coming weeks or months.\n\nBut the Bill, which builds on a series of announcements on the environment under Ms May\u2019s premiership, shows the government is keen to set out its green credentials in the face of rising public concern over climate and wildlife.\n\nThere will also be measures to ensure net gains for wildlife in new developments, with house builders required to show they have delivered a 10 per cent boost in nature. It will also use the \u201cpolluter pays\u201d principle to make the government consider the environmental implications of every decision.\n\nEnvironment Minister Zac Goldsmith described it as a \u201clandmark\u201d piece of legislation.\n\nHe told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme: \u201cIt is a world leading bill. It guarantees a number of things.\n\n\u201cIt guarantees that our standards, at least, will not go down. Preferably, they\u2019ll go up, they\u2019ll improve.\n\n\u201cAnd it guarantees that there will be a new regulatory system \u2013 a new body, an independent regulator, whose job will be to hold government and government departments and local government and public public bodies to account.\u201d\n\nMr Goldsmith added: \u201cMy view is that the power that this body has is enough to ensure that governments play by the rules and that departments play by the rules.\n\n\u201cI had a note from one of the people who\u2019s been campaigning hardest for this body, an outsider, an environmentalist, saying \u2018I asked for legislation with teeth, a new body with teeth, and you sent us a great white shark\u2019.\n\n\u201cAnd I think for most of the people who\u2019ve been campaigning on this, if not all of them, this is really good news.\u201d\n\nAmong the measures in the draft legislation being introduced are plans for a legally binding target to reduce air pollutant PM2.5, a fine particulate matter. There will also be a boost to local powers to address air pollution from domestic wood burners.\n\nAnd, in the case of a repeat of the Volkswagen emissions scandal which revealed cars were emitting more pollution than tests showed, ministers will be able to demand manufacturers recall vehicles that do not meet relevant standards.\n\nThere will also be measures the government said would ensure net gains for wildlife in new developments, with house builders required to show they have delivered a 10 per cent boost in nature.\n\nAnd after Sheffield Council faced criticism over tree-felling, the Bill also includes steps to give communities a greater say in the protection of local trees.\n\nThere will be a more consistent approach to recycling across England, a deposit return scheme for drinks containers and a mechanism for introducing a levy on single use plastics, similar to the carrier bag charge, that could be applied to items such as takeaway cutlery.\n\nJoan Edwards, director of public affairs at The Wildlife Trusts, said: \u201cNature and the wild places it depends on are in crisis \u2013 on land and at sea \u2013 and people are crying out for decisive action.\n\n\u201cIt is vital that this Bill kickstarts a major recovery of natural habitats and provides more space for nature to fightback \u2013 before it\u2019s too late.\u201d\n\nDebbie Tripley, Director of Environmental Policy and Advocacy for WWF, welcomed the inclusion of climate change targets within the draft legislation.\n\nHowever she said it was important the new watchdog had real independent and authority to act against those who flout the rules.\n\nShe said: \u201cThe existing EU regulator can currently impose fines and we need to see that same power in the UK, if we\u2019re going to hold government to account over its promise to leave our environment in a better state for future generations.\u201d\n\nEnvironment Secretary Theresa Villiers said the bill would secure the health of the natural environment for generations to come.\n\nShe said: \u201cThat\u2019s why our landmark Environment Bill leads a green transformation that will help our country to thrive.\n\n\u201cIt positions the UK as a world leader on improving air quality, environmental biodiversity, a more circular economy, and managing our precious water resources in a changing climate.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by PA", "description": "The\u00a0new environment watchdog will have no power to fine the government if it fails on its own commitments to protect the natural world, it has been revealed.\u00a0 Currently most of the UK\u2019s environment rules are enforced by the EU which has the power to impose heavy fines for missing environment targets such as cutting pollution.", "authors": ["Phoebe Weston"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/15/10/pri86906595.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
