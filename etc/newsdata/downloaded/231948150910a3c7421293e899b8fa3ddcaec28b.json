But Trump\u2019s been dictating the message.\n\nNOONAN: Yes, Trump is the president. He has that megaphone. I think Joe Biden, for the past two weeks, has been a little on the back of his heels over this issue, not sure how to address it, not sure what exactly precisely to defend and what to concede. But I have to tell you Cornell, I disagree with you a little bit. I don\u2019t think this is merely a \u201cmuddy the water\u201d story. This is a story that at least half the American people understand the Hunter Biden story as a story of the swamp, the elite, buddy-buddy-ism, using your family influence to do well in life. The American people don\u2019t like it. They have never liked it. And it is \u2014\n\nTODD: So how does it come from the Trumps though? Like, it\u2019s sort of an awkward charge coming from the Trumps. But you say with a Cheshire cat smile.\n\nNOONAN: Well, was that a Cheshire cat smile?\n\nTODD: Yeah \u2014\n\nNOONAN: I\u2019m so relieved to hear it was. That\u2019s an interesting question, I think is how I\u2019d respond to your question.", "description": "Sunday, during the roundtable portion of NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan warned the Hunter Biden side of the Trump impeachment story, which she called \"the story of the swamp,\" puts the younger Biden on the wrong side of the American people. | Clips", "authors": ["Jeff Poor"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Noonan1013-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
