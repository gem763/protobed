(Best of all: It\u2019s free.)\n\nAll files uploaded to Black Hole are encrypted first, and the data is then split and shared among other Blockstack users. This means your files and personal data are kept entirely private, even from Black Hole. Only your public username is accessible to other users.\n\nJust as with pretty much any other file transfer service, Black Hole still has size limitation for uploads. The current free version limits your uploads to 512MB, but an upcoming Plus version will increase that limit to 8GB.\n\nThose are on the slightly lower end compared to other services \u2014 for instance, Dropbox Transfer starts at 2GB file for free accounts, and many other services allow up to 10GB files or larger.\n\nThat said, Black Hole\u2019s reliance on blockchain means all users have unlimited total storage; download links never expire; and uploaded files can be downloaded by anyone with the link to the file, from any browser, even if they don\u2019t have a Black Hole or Blockstack account. (You\u2019ll still need to sign up if you wish to upload or send files, though). You\u2019d be hard-pressed to find another service that offers all of those features (or any of them) for free.\n\nBlack Hole has both a web client and windows app. Both versions have all of the above features, but the Windows app has a few unique benefits like transfer history, the ability to delete and disable links, and password-protected files.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in giving Black Hole a try, here\u2019s how to sign up and upload files.", "description": "We\u2019ve covered many file-transfer services previously, but we recently stumbled upon Black Hole, a relatively new service uses the blockchain-based Blockstack network for user logins, file storage, and delivery.
