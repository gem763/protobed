White House Emails Democrats Its Trump-Ukraine Talking Points.", "language": "en", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS Let's just pretend this never happened.\n\nIn what sounds like a scene straight out of \u201cVeep,\u201d the White House on Wednesday accidentally emailed all of its talking points on President Donald Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president to House and Senate Democrats \u2015 and then followed up with a \u201crecall\u201d email hoping lawmakers would ignore what just happened.\n\nThe White House even sent those GOP talking points to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), her office confirmed \u2015 a day after she announced a formal impeachment inquiry spurred by Trump\u2019s Ukraine call.\n\nThe mishap means that Democrats (and the public) now have insight into how Republicans are being coached behind the scenes to defend Trump pressuring President Volodymyr Zelensky to open an investigation into 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter while Trump withheld military aid approved for Ukraine.\n\nThe White House sent out its original email, with the subject line \u201cWhat You Need To Know | President Trump\u2019s Call with President Zelenskyy,\u201d at 11:21 a.m. It took less than an hour for the follow-up email to go out.\n\nHere\u2019s a screenshot of the recall message, provided by a Democratic lawmaker\u2019s office:\n\nHere's a screenshot of the White House asking House Democrats to please disregard the talking points on Trump/Ukraine they just emailed them pic.twitter.com/55HgOESWyL \u2014 Jennifer Bendery (@jbendery) September 25, 2019\n\nA White House spokesman did not respond to a request for comment on why any of this happened.\n\nSome Democratic lawmakers mocked the White House for its mistake. Rep. Brendan Boyle (D-Pa.), for one, sarcastically thanked Trump\u2019s team for sending him their spin.\n\nI would like to thank @WhiteHouse for sending me their talking points on how best to spin the disastrous Trump/Zelensky call in Trump\u2019s favor. However, I will not be using their spin and will instead stick with the truth.\n\nBut thanks though. \u2014 US Rep Brendan Boyle (@RepBrendanBoyle) September 25, 2019\n\nRep. Bill Pascrell Jr. (D-N.J.) went ahead and shared what had been shared with him, calling the GOP talking points \u201ccomplete Orwellian lies and toxic trash.\u201d\n\nThe trump White House just accidentally sent our office their talking points for deflecting trump\u2019s treachery. They\u2019re complete Orwellian lies and toxic trash, but maybe you\u2019d like to read them to appreciate their corruption!
