We started off in Vegas, and are making a slow trek to Denver, Colorado, stopping at National Parks along the way.\n\nIt\u2019s a lot of fun. It\u2019s also a lot of shared hotel rooms and Airbnbs, shared meals and petrol purchases. Since we\u2019re splitting a lot of those expenses, the 95 of them we have could be an accounting nightmare. Instead, we\u2019re using a free app called Splitwise to keep track of it all, and it\u2019s amazing.\n\nWith Splitwise I created a \u201cgroup\u201d for our road trip consisting of myself, my friend Sara and my friend Claire. It\u2019s an app great for things like group trips, but could also be useful for any sort of situation where you\u2019re splitting multiple expenses with a group of people.\n\nAs we\u2019ve had expenses, we\u2019ve added them to the app along with information on how they should be split. For instance, I paid the $250 for our Airbnb rental last night on my credit card and told the app that it needed to be split equally three ways. Sara charged our breakfast and split the bill by what we all ate since there were some large variations on that front.\n\nExpenses can be divided pretty much any way you would want to. They can be split equally, by a percentage, or by a specific amount. You can also do things like have the app split everything equally, but then adjust it so one person it maying an extra few dollars.\n\nYou can add photos of receipts to individual expenses if you want. While that\u2019s not necessary for our trip, since we are all here and see how much things cost, I can see that feature being useful in a roommate situation where you\u2019re splitting household items like toilet paper or food and want to see how much individual items actually cost.\n\nThe beauty of the app is that it pays attention to how much each person is spending and then shows you how much you cumulatively owe other people or how much they owe you. So Sara might owe me $90 for that Airbnb, but I owe her $20 for breakfast. The app does that maths and deducts that breakfast from the Airbnb cost.\n\nOnce all your expenses are done, a \u201cSettle Up\u201d button allows you to tell the app that money has exchanged hands to make things even.\n\nFor us it\u2019s been great, in that we all know exactly how much money we owe each other, and there\u2019s no stress in someone always picking up meals or hotels and potentially getting finally screwed. All that info is right in front of you all the time which means you don\u2019t have to have any conversations about money during your journey and can instead focus on having fun.", "description": "I\u2019m currently in the middle of a 10-day road trip with two friends of mine.
