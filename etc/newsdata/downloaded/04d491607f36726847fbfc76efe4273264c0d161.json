Bush: Is there room for us to have a conversation?", "language": "en", "text": "\n\n\n\nShould we all just get along?\n\nNo, according to the outcry Ellen DeGeneres faced when she hung out with George W. Bush at a Dallas Cowboys football game last Sunday. She addressed the controversy on her show, first joking, \u201cWhy is a gay Hollywood liberal sitting next to a conservative, Republican president?\u201d and later launching into a monologue about their unlikely friendship.\n\n\u201c...Here\u2019s the thing, I\u2019m friends with George Bush. In fact, I\u2019m friends with a lot of people who don\u2019t share the same beliefs that I have,\u201d the talk show host said. \u201cWe\u2019re all different, and I think that we\u2019ve forgotten that that\u2019s OK that we\u2019re all different...just because I don\u2019t agree with someone on everything, doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m not going to be friends with them. When I say, \u2018Be kind to one another,\u2019 I don\u2019t mean only the people that think the same way that you do. I mean, be kind to everyone. Doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Bush\u2019s representative responded to Fox News,\"President and Mrs. Bush really enjoyed being with Ellen and Portia (de Rossi) and appreciated Ellen\u2019s comments about respecting one another. They respect her.\u201d\n\nMany questioned why a woman whose career was almost derailed for coming out as gay would be paling around with a former president who once called for a constitutional amendment to exclude gay couples from marriage.\n\nYes, that was me at the Cowboys game with George W. Bush over the weekend. Here\u2019s the whole story. pic.twitter.com/AYiwY5gTIS \u2014 Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) October 8, 2019\n\n\n\nMark Ruffalo tweeted \u201cSorry, until George W. Bush is brought to justice for the crimes of the Iraq War, (including American-lead torture, Iraqi deaths & displacement, and the deep scars\u2014emotional & otherwise\u2014inflicted on our military that served his folly), we can\u2019t even begin to talk about kindness\u201d and \u201cThe Good Place\u201d star Jameela Jamil who reportedly first supported DeGeneres, according to BuzzFeed, later called him a \u201cmonstrous leader\u201d adding, \u201cI now understand the rage.\u201d\n\nOther celebs expressed support for their friendship. On Instagram, Orlando Bloom wrote \u201cKill \u2018em with kindness.\u201d Kristen Bell shared a photo of the comic and politician with a bunch of crown emojis, and then deleted it. Reese Witherspoon also tweeted \u2014 and then deleted \u2014 \u201cThank you for this important reminder, Ellen!\u201d\n\nWhile not excusing policies that hurt a lot of people, is there value to building bridges \u2014 or at least having conversations \u2014 with people who hold different viewpoints? Yes and no, according to experts.\n\nExchanging contradictory ideas can lead to personal enlightenment and compassion for others, according to Los Angeles psychoanalyst Bethany Marshall, PhD. According to a small preliminary study by Keystone University in Pennsylvania, \u201cAssociating with friends with different personality traits may be an advantage to you both, as each of you supplement the other\u2019s weaknesses.\u201d\n\nMarshall warns that power dynamics can break these friendships, though. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between people agreeing to disagree and one person weaponizing or legislating ideas to suppress the other. Sometimes there are real consequences to a difference of opinion.\u201d\n\nBut healthy friendships can still develop among big differences. \u201cPeople are better at tolerating different beliefs if they are confident in their own values,\u201d Marshall tells Yahoo Lifestyle.\n\nThe Republican leader\u2019s relationship with high-profile liberals has amused. In October, Michelle Obama explained why President Bush famously passed her a cough drop at Senator John McCain\u2019s funeral. \"...He's my partner in crime at every major thing where all the 'formers' gather. So we're together all the time,\u201d the former first lady later told Today. \"I love him to death. He's a wonderful man, he's a funny man.\"\n\nIn 2017, Bush was interviewed by Degeneres and said of his bond with Obama, \"(The friendship) surprised everybody. That's what's so weird about society today, [the surprise] that people on opposite sides of the political spectrum can actually like each other.\"\n\nAnd why shouldn\u2019t that surprise people? A 2018 Ipsos Mori Social Research Institute poll found that 84 percent of Americans say their country is \u201cdivided\u201d with 44 percent blaming political views for the \u201cgreatest cause of tension.\u201d\n\nWould Ellen, a \u201cHollywood liberal\u201d have sat through a baseball game with Bush if he were still in office, actively exercising conservative ideals? We don\u2019t know.\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\n\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "A photo of Ellen DeGeneres and former president George W.
