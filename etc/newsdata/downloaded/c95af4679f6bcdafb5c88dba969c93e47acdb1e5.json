The atmosphere is great.\"\n\nImage copyright Kim Kyung-Hoon / Reuters\n\nAs a practising doctor, Mr Nagayama is very aware of the risks involved in playing a high-impact sport at his age.\n\nThe Fuwaku Rugby Club's website gives detailed advice on health precautions and includes links to a life-insurance company.\n\nImage copyright Kim Kyung-Hoon / Reuters\n\n\"Since I joined Fuwaku club, I have broken ribs many times and broke my collarbone too,\" Mr Nagayama says.\n\n\"When I noticed an irregular pulse, I would take medicine to adjust so I can still do it. I can't stand not playing.\n\n\"This may sound strange but I have lost my wife years ago and now I would say I don't mind dying playing rugby.\"\n\nMr Nagayama can be seen in his home below, praying at an altar for his late wife.\n\nImage copyright Kim Kyung-Hoon / Reuters\n\nAnother Fuwaku player, Tony Hartley, 71, is originally from the UK.\n\n\"I was at the Tokyo Sevens and I got chatting to a guy next to me because he had a shirt on that said: 'Fuwaku Rugby Club since 1948', which is when I was born, so I was curious,\" he says.\n\n\"He said he could introduce me to the club, which he did the following week and I have been playing more or less ever since. That was seven years ago.\n\n\"I was really surprised because the scene doesn't really exist in the UK, certainly not at 60 [or] 70. It was a really welcome surprise and a good way of making friends.\"\n\nImage copyright Kim Kyung-Hoon / Reuters\n\nPhotos by Kim Kyung-Hoon.", "description": "Tokyo's Fuwaku rugby club has three players over the age of 90.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/E48B/production/_108670585_724dee21-cae2-46d9-8175-c071f48602a7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
