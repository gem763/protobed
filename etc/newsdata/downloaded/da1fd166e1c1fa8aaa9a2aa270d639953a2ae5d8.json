You\u2019re going to want to try out your snazzy new phone as soon as you open that box. But first, you need to get all of the apps and data from your old iPhone onto your new one.\n\nIt\u2019s actually very easy \u2014 in fact, if your current phone has iOS 12.4 or later, it\u2019s easier than ever. (If your phone has a version of iOS earlier than that, don\u2019t worry; just follow the instructions in the article we ran last March.)\n\nThe difference between now and then is that the process of moving your data used to involve restoring it from an iCloud or iTunes backup. Now, you don\u2019t have to bother with that backup (although backing up your stuff is always a good idea). You can move your apps, data, and ID over to the new phone directly with what Apple calls iPhone migration.\n\nHere\u2019s how.\n\nWireless connection\n\nStart up your new phone. You\u2019ll be asked a couple of initial questions (such as what language you want to use) and then you\u2019ll be invited to transfer data from another phone, if you want.\n\nPut your old phone near your new one. Make sure both phones are plugged in (you don\u2019t want them running out of power in the middle of the data move).\n\nWhen the connection is made, your new iPhone screen will display a pattern and your old phone will open its camera and display a blank circle in the middle of the screen. You\u2019ll be asked to hold your new iPhone up to the camera of your old one so that the pattern is centered in the circle.\n\nYou\u2019ll then be invited to move your attention to your new phone to finish the setup.\n\nEnter your Apple ID when asked; you may also be asked whether you want to setup Face ID or Touch ID.\n\nThere will be several screens to go through before the transfer begins, including the usual terms and conditions, whether you want to share your location and your analytics, and whether you want to set up FaceTime, iMessage, and Siri.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve made all your choices, the transfer will begin. The phone I was moving from in this test hadn\u2019t been used much, so it only took about six minutes; a well-used iPhone with lots of apps and data on it will probably take much longer.\n\nSign in to your new iPhone again and you\u2019re done!\n\nGrid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWired connection\n\nOne advantage of Apple\u2019s updated migration feature is that you can also use a cable to transfer the data. If you\u2019ve got especially slow Wi-Fi, a wired connection may make the transfer faster, although ironically, during my test, it increased the download time from a little under six minutes (using the wireless method) to nine minutes and 40 seconds. However, if you\u2019re having any trouble with the wireless transfer, this could be a good alternative.\n\nFor a wired connection, you\u2019ll need a Lightning to USB 3 camera adapter and a Lightning to USB cable.\n\nAs with the wireless method, start up your new phone and go through the initial questions until you get the invite to transfer data from another phone.\n\nAs before, put your old phone near your new one and make sure both phones are plugged in.\n\nConnect the Lightning to USB 3 camera adapter to your old phone. Connect the Lightning to USB cable to your new phone. Join the two cables together using the adapter. Power the adaptor through its Lightning port.\n\nAfter that, follow the same directions as above, including using the camera to find the pattern, and answering all the setup questions.\n\nYou\u2019ll know that the phones are using the wired setup because once the transfer starts, there will be a small \u201ccable\u201d between the two phone icons on the screen.\n\nWhichever method you choose, enjoy your new iPhone.", "description": "If you\u2019re one of the many who have just gotten Apple\u2019s new iPhone 11, 11 Pro, or Pro Max, you need to get all of the apps and data from your old iPhone onto your new one.
