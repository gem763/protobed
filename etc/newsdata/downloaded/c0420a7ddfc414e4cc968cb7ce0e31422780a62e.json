Much of that robust stock performance is due to Ford's ample dividend, which remains impressive at a forward dividend yield of 6.7%.\n\n[READ 7 Autonomous Vehicle Stocks Leading the Market]\n\nThe performance of global automakers as a whole is totally erratic, with no clear trend emerging for the group as a whole. What is clear though, is that Ford stock has delivered pleasant returns; its 16% year-to-date uptick is better than any publicly traded U.S. automaker, and best of the five most valuable publicly traded auto companies on Earth.\n\nWhile it doesn't begin to make up for the 34% haircut F stock took in 2018, it's a welcome bounce nonetheless. Still, both the longer-term trend (shares have been cut in half since 2014) and the shorter-term trends (it's 8% below the 200-day moving average) are bearish.\n\nWith 2020 beckoning, and as the auto industry remains a puzzle for investors, can Ford turn things around? Auto industry experts say that the outlook is on the downside, as Ford struggles to adapt to a changing automotive landscape.\n\nFord Stock at a Glance\n\nIgnoring for a moment the nominal YTD gain, Ford's stock performance of late is underwhelming.\n\nFord stock is trading near $8.50 per share, down from $13 at the start of 2018 and 52% from its 2014 high of $17.72. Analysts don't seem particularly enthusiastic about the stock; two have revised their 2019 earnings expectations lower within the last 30 days.\n\nAnd as far as growth expectations are concerned, Ford doesn't stack up too well against rivals: analysts expect 2020 revenues to fall 0.9%, which stacks up miserably against General Motors Co. ( GM, estimated 0.2% sales decline), Fiat Chrysler ( FCAU, 1.1% increase in 2020 expected revenue) and obviously pales in comparison to the likes of Tesla ( TSLA), expected to grow 22% next year.\n\nFord, like most automakers, is stuck in low gear. Through September, U.S. auto sales were down 3.5% year-over-year, with conditions trending lower recently as the decline was 4.9% in the third quarter. Only trucks are performing well: U.S. sales are up 8.8% in the first nine months of 2019.\n\n\"The reality for auto brands in the U.S. right now is declining overall sales, so any good news is welcome for vehicle makers,\" says Mike Dickerson, product innovation lead at Alter Agents, a Los Angeles-based market research firm that specializes in the auto industry. \"While SUV and (crossover utility vehicle) sales have grown, sedan sales have declined precipitously, creating an overall drag on auto manufacturers.\"\n\nEven SUVs have been underperforming; sales fell 10.5% in the U.S. last quarter.\n\nGoing forward, Dickerson says, \"the most successful brands will be those that can adapt their model lineup and production numbers to meet consumer demand as this shift away from traditional sedans plays out.\"\n\nPros to Buying Ford Stock\n\nFord stock seems to be treading water right now, although there are some signs of demand.\n\nAccording to Robintrack, a website created to track the most popular stocks on Robinhood, the trading app, Ford is the third most widely held stock on the app. There are over 284,000 accounts proudly holding Ford, according to Robintrack, versus more than 152,000 for Tesla, the next-most popular auto stock.\n\n[Artificial Intelligence Stocks: The 10 Best AI Companies.]\n\n\"The most commonly cited reasons for owning Ford are its low price-earnings ratio coupled with the potential upside from its self-driving initiatives,\" says Bernard George, chief executive officer at Nvstr, a stock market data analysis firm. \"Press reports suggest Ford's self-driving cars are capable of navigating very complex urban environments, though there is some skepticism about the controlled nature of Ford's demos of this technology,\" he says. \"Users also note Ford's dividend yield is attractive.\"\n\nStory continues", "description": "Headquartered in Dearborn, Michigan, Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) started rolling cars out for the mass market in 1903.
