He was appointed acting secretary to replace Kirstjen Nielsen after she quit. Nielsen succeeded John Kelly in the job when Kelly was tapped to be Trump\u2019s White House chief of staff. (Elaine Duke served as acting secretary for six months between Kelly and Nielsen.)\n\nTrump said he would announce a new acting secretary soon. The acting deputy is David Pekoske, the head of the Transportation Security Administration.\n\nPrior to his appointment with DHS, McAleenan worked in various positions with Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and was confirmed as commissioner of CBP in March 2018.\n\nHe was seen as a level head who could effectively manage the border crisis but, like many other former administration officials who came before, Trump eventually soured on him.\n\nHis tenure was marked by internal squabbling and jockeying by others in the department vying for top jobs, all playing out against a backdrop of outrage and horror amid reports of children being held in squalid conditions and images of those who perished trying to make the trek.\n\nJust last week, he spoke to the Washington Post about what the paper described as his \u201cunease\u201d with a law enforcement agency being used for partisan political purposes.\n\n\u201cWhat I don\u2019t have control over is the tone, the message, the public face and approach of the department in an increasingly polarized time,\u201d he told the Washington Post. \u201cThat\u2019s uncomfortable, as the accountable, senior figure.\u201d\n\nThe 240,000-person department is tasked with election security and cybersecurity, disaster response and even the Secret Service. But for Trump, the Department of Homeland Security means one thing: immigration.\n\nThe president\u2019s signature issue makes the department his focus and his ire, and balancing a White House eager to push major changes with the reality on the ground is a constant challenge.", "description": "Kevin McAleenan was the fourth person to lead the department in two years", "authors": ["Guardian Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b22971e2ab6ef645acdc8c773f69cdde52fbdbf/0_17_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b7a33b107e654ad73fe973064a421a54", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
