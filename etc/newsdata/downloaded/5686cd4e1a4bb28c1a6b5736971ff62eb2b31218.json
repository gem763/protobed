But there is a fear that adults and children are being sucked into a cycle of betting, debt and poverty.\n\nOne government minister has called this \"a curse on youth\", and in May the country introduced new gambling regulations, including a ban on advertising outdoors and on social media.\n\nParliament has now voted to raise the excise duty on bets, from 10% to 20%.\n\nSportPesa said it was \"disappointed\" by the move and that it would stop its operations until a \"non-hostile regulatory environment\" returned. The firm has deactivated its website. It said the new tax comes on top of an existing 20% tax on individual gamblers' winnings.\n\n\"This will have severe consequences for licensed betting companies, which dutifully pay their taxes and ultimately will lead to a decline in government tax revenue to near zero and will halt all investments in sports in Kenya,\" the firm said.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Sports betting has exploded across Africa, but are the betting companies playing it straight?\n\n\"Until such time that adequate taxation and non-hostile regulatory environment is returned, the SportPesa brand will halt operations in Kenya.\"\n\nSportPesa was founded in Nairobi by Kenyans backed by Bulgarian investors. As well as Everton it has also had partnerships with English clubs Arsenal, Southampton and Hull City.\n\nWhistle-to-whistle ban\n\nIt comes amid concerns about the effects of gambling in both the UK and Africa, particularly around sport.\n\nLast December, the UK's biggest gambling companies voluntarily agreed to a \"whistle-to-whistle\" television advertising ban. The Remote Gambling Association (RGA), which includes Bet365, Ladbrokes and Paddy Power, struck a deal to stop adverts during live sports broadcasts.\n\nIt follows political pressure about the amount of betting advertising on TV. The Labour Party has said football clubs will be banned from signing shirt sponsorship deals with betting companies if it were in power.\n\nGambling giant GVC Holdings, which owns Gala, Ladbrokes and Coral, has said it is stopping all football shirt sponsorship, as well as stopping perimeter advertising at matches.\n\nEverton has previously said it values its \"developing relationship with SportPesa, who have demonstrated a strong alignment with our values\", in particular around its support for the club's community work.\n\nMeanwhile, the BBC has looked at the dangers of football gambling in both Kenya and Uganda, and found young people and students being sucked into gambling addiction.", "description": "The football club's sponsor, SportPesa, halts operations in the east Africa nation after new gaming taxes.", "authors": ["Bill Wilson", "Business Reporter", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8310/production/_109025533_mediaitem109022484.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
