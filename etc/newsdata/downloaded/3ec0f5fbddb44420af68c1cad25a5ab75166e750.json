The decision to delay some tariffs until mid-December will support growth in 2019, but it will create greater uncertainty heading into 2020.\n\nGiven the growing economic concerns, it's unsurprising that business owners are growing anxious.\n\nBusiness owners are rethinking their hiring plans\n\nThe findings from our latest survey of US business owners, which we conduct quarterly to gauge their sentiment on the economy as well as investment and policy issues, indicate a significant shift in their outlook. Specifically, as concerns over the US-China trade conflict grow, most business owners who earlier in the year had expansion plans told us that those plans are now beginning to be put on hold.\n\nLast quarter, 46% of these business owners planned to increase their hiring; that number has now dropped to 25%. More broadly, business owners' plans to invest in their own businesses have also been scaled back from earlier this year. In the second quarter, 36% planned to invest more in their firms, while only 24% now still plan to do so.\n\nThis retrenchment is largely due to the trade conflict - nearly 70% believe that it has had a negative effect on the US and global economies. Moreover, if the conflict lasts another six months without any notable progress toward a resolution, business owners indicate their hiring plans would further retract, reducing net hiring to its lowest level in three years and net investment to negative levels.\n\nIt's important to place these concerns in context. Although the US economy is growing more slowly, relatively healthy US consumer fundamentals indicate a recession is still avoidable.\n\nThe Federal Reserve cut rates by 0.25% at its September meeting, and we expect this to be followed by additional reductions through the end of 2020. Easing of monetary policy won't prevent the economy from slowing, and it can't reduce trade uncertainty, but it should help the economy from slipping into recession.\n\nChanging investment plans could weigh on economy\n\nBut even with strong consumer indicators and flexible monetary policy, the effects of a deepening trade dispute remain a risk to the US economy's primary growth drivers, most notably the job creation and investment potential of private businesses.\n\nIn recent months, economic growth has been driven almost entirely by consumer spending, which in turn has been underpinned by a healthy labor market. If business owners dial back their hiring plans, the labor market, the consumer economy and US growth as a whole will experience even greater headwinds.\n\nConsumers will soon start to feel the effects of tariffs when they go shopping. The previous rounds of tariffs focused largely on industrial goods that could be relatively easily substituted with suppliers from outside of China. But the August 1 announcement of 10% tariffs on the remaining $300 billion of Chinese imports covers a range of consumer goods, including smartphones, personal computers, cameras, and clothing, for which it will be much harder to find substitutes from elsewhere.\n\nThe decision to delay the imposition of tariffs on some goods until mid-December will help in the near term, and could actually end up boosting growth. The fear that tariffs will push up prices in the months ahead could encourage consumers to front-load some of their purchases. It's not hard to imagine some retailers using the coming tariffs as a sales pitch.\n\nHowever, once the tariffs kick in, those incentives will evaporate. A slowdown in consumer spending will create a drag on the US economy and in turn may affect business owner sentiment.\n\nSo far, the labor market and the consumer economy seem to be fighting off trade tensions. But if this climate persists into next year, business owners are telling us that their patience may not last for long: 60% of business owners told us they want to de-escalate the trade war, after having extracted concessions from China, or end it altogether.\n\nIf policymakers value the US's economic health, they should be paying close attention to the business owners that have contributed to job growth and the economy over the past three years. The message from those businesses is clear: It's time to find an end for the US-China trade conflict, or risk damaging America's economic growth engine.\n\nTom Naratil is copresident of UBS Global Wealth Management and president of UBS Americas.", "description": "Business owners are starting to draw back on their hiring and investment plans because of the trade war, this should wake up Washington.", "authors": ["Tom Naratil"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8296ed2e22af07fb769957-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
