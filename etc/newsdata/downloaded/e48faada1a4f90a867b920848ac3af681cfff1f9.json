US Steel, the 120-year-old icon of the sector, told investors that its financial outlook would suffer in the second half of the year because of falling prices and weak demand. It was the third steel company this week to issue a profit warning to investors.\n\nUS Steel's stockfell 11% on Thursday. It's the latest drop in a steady decline of the company's share price \u2014 it is down more than 60% from a year ago \u2014 as President Donald Trump's promises to revive the industry\n\nEarlier Wednesday,, whose stock is down 34% in the last year, warned of declining profits from its steel operations. And, the nation's largest steelmaker, lowered its profit estimates on Monday. Nucor's stock is down 18% over the past year.\n\nsaid Wednesday that it now projects a $0.35 loss per share for the three months ending in September, after taking a $53 million hit from a fire at one of its facilities and restructuring costs. The company also said negative market conditions and a lack of demand will result in the continued idling of two US blast furnaces, decreasing the company's shipments in the quarter.\n\nThe company's European operations are also hurting. On Wednesday US Steel reiterated its plans to reduce its headcount in Europe by 2,500 positions by the end of 2021, layoffs that were first announced in July . The European headquarters has already cut 1,800 positions to date.\n\nDeclines in steel prices and steady raw material costs hurt US Steel's margins in Europe. And Trump's tariffs on China, meant to help boost the US steel industry, may actually be hurting the company's European operations. It cited a \"continued high level of steel imports to Europe\" as one factor contributing to its struggling performance, imports that may be coming from Chinese steel producers unable to sell in the United States because of the tariffs.\n\nThe company also expects pressures on its \"Tubular Products\" business segment, which focuses on the oil and gas industry, will hurt its 2019 earnings. Weaker demand and lower prices, as well as continued imports from non-American steel companies, forced the company to lower its full-year shipment projections for those products.\n\n-- CNN Business' Chris Isidore contributed to this report.", "description": "US Steel lowered its outlook for the second half of the year, citing falling steel prices and a lack of demand.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190918170439-us-steel-slovakia-file-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
