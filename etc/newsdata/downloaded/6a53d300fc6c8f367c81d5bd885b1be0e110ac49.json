Peru and Hong Kong have already ratified their side of the deals while Indonesia is yet to do so.\n\nLabor, had it won the election, had promised to renegotiate the deals, especially that with Indonesia, to introduce labour market testing before foreign workers could be brought in, and to remove investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) clauses. These allow foreigners to take legal action against Australia if their commercial interests are hurt by government policy action.\n\nWith the Indonesian FTA, Labor fought for concessions, including the abolition of a 1993 bilateral investment agreement with Jakarta which had an ISDS clause with no safeguards.\n\nUnder the new FTA, the ISDS comes with safeguards to do away with frivolous claims and carve-outs to protect claims against Australia in any area of public health.\n\nACTU president Michele O'Neil, who is one of those lobbying hardest against the deals, said the government had given no undertaking to abolish the 1993 agreement.\n\nThe unions also want mandatory labour market testing before foreign workers can be imported. Contract Service Providers wishing to import labour must negotiate this separately but the unions do not believe this to be an adequate safeguard.\n\nMs O'Neil said the ACTU was not opposed to trade and was insisting only on amendments.\n\nShe also noted there had been no independent analysis of the economic benefits of the deals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSenator Birmingham said the unions were indulging in a scare campaign. The plan was to have the House of Representatives pass the bills next week and have them through the Senate by the end of the year.\n\n\u201cOur government is committed to ensuring that the benefits from these agreements are realised as soon as possible,'' he said.\n\n\u201cFor example, Australian grain growers will be able to export 500,000 tonnes of feed grains each year into Indonesia tariff free, building on our already substantial milling wheat exports.\n\n\u201cUnder our deal with Hong Kong zero tariffs will be locked in on goods, market access will be guaranteed for services suppliers, and conditions for two-way investment will be significantly improved.\n\n\u201cAustralian dairy farmers will have historic new access to the Peru market, with zero tariffs locked-in from day one on 7000 tonnes of products.\"", "description": "Shadow trade minister Madeline King has recommended Labor support legislation enabling three new free trade deals.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2103%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_5/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/7f8ec0f46e50f2a09f9126a1d913688e4d5ff740", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
