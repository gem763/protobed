But the unidentified woman\u2019s questions took a bizarre turn when she suggested people should eat children.\n\n\u201cEven if we would bomb Russia, we still have too many people, too much pollution, so we have to get rid of the babies,\u201d the woman said. \u201cJust stopping having babies is not enough; we need to eat the babies.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Debunked: Moon landing conspiracy theories 1/8 Flag waves but there is no wind on the moon The theory goes that as the flag is waving in the wind, it must have been on earth as there is no wind on the moon. If it were on the moon it would simply droop. The truth is that it is not waving, rather it is being held in place by a telescopic pole running through the top of the flag and it is crumpled as it had been screwed up for days en route to the moon Nasa 2/8 Boot doesn't match the boot print It is suggested that this picture of a boot print on the moon is fake because it does not line up with the tread of this boot from Neil Armstrong\u2019s spacesuit. That\u2019s right, it doesn\u2019t NASA 3/8 Boot doesn\u2019t match the boot print The print does however match that of the outer boots, the ones worn by the Apollo crew when walking on the moon. And while we\u2019re at it: the print is from Buzz Aldrin, not Armstrong. NASA 4/8 No stars in outer space? Why are there no stars in sight when this picture was taken on a rock in outer space that has no atmosphere? Answer: camera settings. In order to capture this photo in direct sunlight, the camera would have to have a very narrow aperture and the shutter would only stay open for a minuscule amount of time. This means that the camera will not take in the light of the distant stars, only that of the much nearer, brighter sun. NASA 5/8 Astronauts couldn\u2019t survive the radiation belts The Van Allen belts are regions of extremely high energy charged particles are trapped in the earth\u2019s magnetic field. The conspiracy theory goes that the astronauts could not possibly survive exposure to this level of radiation. NASA 6/8 Astronauts couldn\u2019t survive the radiation belts Professor Anu Ojha of the National Space Centre answers: \u2018Firewalking. If you\u2019ve ever done firewalking, you\u2019ll know the one thing you don\u2019t do is linger around in the middle of the firepit. You cross as quickly as you can... as long as you walk across quite quickly, looking at the thermal conductivity of your feet, you are not going to have enough thermal energy going into the soles of your feet to burn you. You\u2019re absolutely fine. Just don\u2019t hang around in the middle! In a similar way, the transit time through the Van Allen radiation belt right at the beginning of the Apollo voyages was incredibly short. Travelling through the Van Allen radiation belt if you are going fast enough \u2013 which you need to be if you\u2019re going to the Moon \u2013 is no problem whatsoever.\u2019 AFP/Getty 7/8 Shadows aren\u2019t parallel - must be a lighting set-up These two shadows are pointing in separate directions, hence they must be lit by two separate lights in a studio set-up rather than the single-point source of the sun. NASA 8/8 Shadows aren\u2019t parallel - must be a lighting set-up No, this is simply a matter of perspective. The moon\u2019s surface is not flat and so the shadows are not projected perfectly parallel. This question would have never been asked if we could see the beginning of the shadows, which would all align with the same vanishing point.

Then came the great Brainwashing Affair of 1974, when members were convinced they had been programmed to kill by the CIA.\u201d\n\nKnown now as the LaRouche Pac, the group essentially creates \u201cchaos\u201d in order to halt focus, according to Mr Sweet\u2019s tweets. He noted that they\u2019ve veered from all around conspiracy-spreading to being vehement supporters of Donald Trump, adding that \u201cPutin is their first love.\u201d\n\nThe group itself later confirmed on Twitter that they were behind the stunt.\n\nThe revelation is a blow to Republicans eager to make Ms Ocasio-Cortez and others concerned about the climate crisis look unnecessarily upset, including the president and his son.\n\nAfter Don Jr tweeted out video of the incident, the president quote-tweeted his son, writing \u201cAOC is a wack job!\u201d\n\nThese tweets were sent before the stunt was revealed to be the work of the president\u2019s own supporters.\n\nIn her own tweet acknowledging the planted chaos, representative Ocasio-Cortez acknowledged that the woman was a Trump supporter, and added \u201cgood to know they were not in crisis.\u201d", "description": "An outlandish interruption at a town hall event for representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s constituents was revealed to be the work of a pro-Trump conspiracy theory group.", "authors": ["Lily Puckett"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/04/20/gettyimages-1173479824.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
