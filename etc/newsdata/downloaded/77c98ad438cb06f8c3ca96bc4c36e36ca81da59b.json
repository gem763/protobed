Trump Handed Terrorists a Free Pass.", "language": "en", "text": "NICE, France\u2014Sir Elton John\u2019s enormous cream-colored villa on Mont Boron looms high in the distance, visible from the dingy flats of this cit\u00e9, or housing project, in northeast Nice called \u201cBon Voyage.\u201d It\u2019s a different world, and in recent years, a number of young French Muslims left it to join the so-called Islamic State in Syria.\n\nThis was once home to Omar Diaby, who, from his base in Syria, became the biggest recruiter of ISIS fighters in France. He briefly faked his death in Syria, but is now believed to be at large. Another local, 31-year-old Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel, drove a truck into a crowd of 300,000 in Nice on July 14, 2016, killing 86 people before he died in a hail of bullets.\n\nOne young Salafist Muslim, whom I last spoke to three years ago and who knows French fighters from here, was in a more jovial mood than I remember when I met him Tuesday at a kebab joint in La Trinit\u00e9, one of two major Muslim enclaves on the outskirts of Nice.\n\nU.S. Surveillance Turns Away From ISIS\u2014and to Its Own Troops\n\nBachir is smiling. Why? Because thanks to U.S. President Donald Trump pulling troops out of northeast Syria, French ISIS fighters, captured in recent years by Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in northern Syria, are said to be escaping their captors\u2014and rejoining their former comrades in what could mean a renaissance for the once mighty Islamic State.\n\nBetween 400 and 450 French ISIS fighters have been detained in Kurdish camps in northeastern Syria. Last week Turkey launched \u201cOperation Peace Spring\u201d after the Trump gave the de facto go-ahead by moving U.S. troops out of the way. The Kurds, desperate after being abandoned by the U.S., are now aligning themselves with the hated President Bashar al-Assad of Syria and no longer have the manpower to guard their prisons. As The Daily Beast reported, the American forces now withdrawing have had to turn their attention away from pursuing ISIS and focus on the risk that ISIS will be pursuing them.\n\nHere in Nice, Bachir denies that he is pro-ISIS but his facial expressions indicate otherwise. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of misinformation about what our brothers are trying to accomplish over there,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope they have a second chance to do some good work, thanks to the U.S.\u201d\n\nAnd who are some of those ISIS fighters who may live to fight another day and \u201cdo some good work\u201d\u2014courtesy of Trump and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan?\n\nFor starters, 35-year-old Adrien Guihal, a French convert to Islam who was part of the infamous and deadly Artigat network, named for a village near Toulouse where extremists\u2014including the terrorist Mohammed Merah who shot up a Jewish school in Toulouse in 2012\u2014used to meet in a farmhouse.\n\nGuihal was the \u201cvoice of ISIS\u201d who claimed responsibility for several major French terrorist attacks. Followers of ISIS on social media say Guihal may have escaped from a Kurdish prison with several other key figures\u2014possibly the equally dangerous Thomas Barnouin \u2014in the chaos that\u2019s followed Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw 1,000 troops from northern Syria.\n\n\u201cWith the collapse of ISIS and the attitude of Turkey against the Kurds, the resurgence of attacks in France is being planned,\u201d Christian Estrosi, the mayor of Nice, warned on Tuesday. \u201cJihadists like Adrien Guihal who took up arms against France are destined to reorganize themselves and begin again.\u201d\n\nGuihal, whose nom de guerre is Abu Oussama al-Faransi (which would translate roughly as Father of Osama, the Frenchman) had claimed responsibility for the slaughter in Nice, although direct connections to ISIS were never established, as well as Magnanville, where a policeman and his wife, who also worked for the police, were murdered in front of the toddler, and Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray, where would-be holy warrior slit the throat of an aged priest. French Twitter was awash in furious comments about Guihal\u2019s escape. As one poster wrote ironically, that Trump and Erdogan \u201ccan sleep well tonight\u201d having set such a person free. \u201cMission accomplished!\u201d\n\nFrench terrorism expert Jean-Charles Brisard told The Daily Beast that the situation in Syria was \u201canarchy\u201d and there was no actual confirmation of Guihal\u2019s escape yet.\n\nBut Brisard also told the Nice-Matin newspaper that he spotted an encrypted email used by someone familiar with Guihal that indicated \u201cfive brothers\u201d had escaped from the Kurdish-held Qamishli prison and one of them was \u201cAbu Oussama al-Faransi,\u201d Guihal\u2019s alias.", "description": "NICE, France\u2014Sir Elton John\u2019s enormous cream-colored villa on Mont Boron looms high in the distance, visible from the dingy flats of this cit\u00e9, or housing project, in northeast Nice called \u201cBon Voyage.\u201d It\u2019s a different world, and in recent years, a number of young French Muslims left it to join the", "authors": ["Christopher Dickey"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gWzRAARTjzc4Z7rVfsp1cQ--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/e8b8d961bd05a3f84b9d830960f461f1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
