REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\n\nIn the memo, Trump asks Zelenskiy directly to investigate his political rival, Democratic challenger Joe Biden, Biden\u2019s son\u2019s business dealings, and a Ukraine prosecutor.\n\nThe memo is more damning than anticipated, said Adam Schiff, the Democrat who heads the House Intelligence Committee. He called it a \u201cmafia-like shakedown\u201d of a foreign leader.\n\nRepublicans said it showed Democrats were wrong to move forward with impeachment. \u201cThere was no quid pro quo and nothing to justify the clamor House Democrats caused,\u201d said Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nThe memo shows Trump pressured Zelenskiy to look into other issues beyond Biden, while criticizing U.S. allies and a former ambassador. Here are six new pieces of information it contains, in order of appearance:\n\nTRUMP SAYS MERKEL DOES NOTHING FOR UKRAINE\n\nTrump says that the United States is doing much more for Ukraine than European countries, and singles out German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The European Union has given 3.3 billion euros ($3.6 billion) financial assistance to Ukraine, since 2014, the largest to any non-EU country, Reuters reported in July.\n\n\u201cI will say that we do a lot for Ukraine. We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time. Much more than the European countries are doing and they should be helping you more than they are Germany does almost nothing for you. All they do is talk and I think it\u2019s something that you should \u00b7really ask them about. When I was speaking to Angela Merkel she talks Ukraine, but she doesn\u2019t do anything.\u201d\n\nZELENSKIY COMMITS TO BUY RAYTHEON-LOCKHEED EQUIPMENT\n\nZelenskiy says he plans to buy more Javelins, anti-tank missiles developed by the United States military that are now produced by Raytheon Co (RTN.N) and Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N).\n\n\u201cI would also like to thank you for your great support in the area of defense. We are ready to continue to cooperate for the next steps specifically we are almost ready to buy more Javelins from the United States for defense purposes.\u201d\n\nTRUMP ASKS FOR INVESTIGATION OF TECH COMPANY THAT FINGERED RUSSIA\n\nThe president asks Zelenskiy to \u201cdo us a favor\u201d and investigate CrowdStrike, the American cybersecurity company that investigated the hacking of the Democratic National Committee. CrowdStrike was one of three firms that led U.S. intelligence officials to conclude Russian intelligence had hacked the DNC, former FBI Director James Comey told Congress in January 2017.\n\nTrump says: \u201cI would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike ... I guess you have one of your wealthy people... The server, they say Ukraine has it.\u201d\n\nIn his response, Zelenskiy agrees to the request, saying, \u201cI also plan to surround myself with great people and in addition to that investigation, I guarantee as the president of Ukraine that all the investigations will be done openly and candidly.\u201d\n\nTRUMP PRESENTS GIULIANI AS A KEY U.S. CONTACT\n\nRudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, holds no official government position. That means he has not been subject to the U.S. Senate confirmation process like other top presidential advisers. Still, he is mentioned multiple times as a go-to figure in the U.S.-Ukraine relationship.\n\nZelenskiy indicates his office is in touch with Giuliani early in the call. \u201cI will personally tell you that one of my assistants spoke with Mr. Giuliani just recently and we are hoping very much that Mr. Giuliani will be able to travel to Ukraine and we will meet once he comes to Ukraine. I just wanted to assure you once again that you have nobody but friends around us.\u201d\n\nLater, Trump says of Giuliani, \u201cHe was the mayor of New York City, a great mayor, and I would like him to call you. I will ask him to call you along with the attorney general. Rudy very much knows what\u2019s happening and he is a very capable guy.\u201d\n\nThen, Trump says twice more he will ask Giuliani and Barr to call, pairing the U.S. attorney general together with his personal lawyer.\n\nZELENSKIY SAYS HE STAYS AT A TRUMP PROPERTY\n\nZelenskiy said he stayed at Trump Tower, Trump\u2019s New York apartment building. The building is not a Trump hotel. It is a condominium residence. He indicates that Ukrainian citizens are buying property there.\n\n\u201cI would like to tell you that I also have quite a few\u00b7Ukrainian friends that live in the United States,\u201d he says. \u201cActually last time I traveled to the United States, I stayed in New York near Central Park and I stayed at the Trump Tower. I will talk to them and I hope to see them again in the future.\u201d\n\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and U.S. President Donald Trump face reporters during a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the 74th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York City, New York, U.S., September 25, 2019. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nTHE TWO DISCUSS INVESTIGATING A U.S. AMBASSADOR Speaking of Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine who was abruptly removed from her post in May, Trump says: \u201cThe former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad news and the people she was dealing with in the Ukraine were bad news so I just wanted to let you know that.\u201d\n\nLater, Zelenskiy says: \u201cI would kindly ask you if you have any additional information that you can provide to us, it would be very helpful for the investigation to make sure that we administer justice in our country with regard to the Ambassador to the United States from Ukraine as far as I recall her name was Ivanovich(sic?). It was great that you were the first one who told me that she was a bad ambassador because I agree\u00b7with you 100%.\u201d\n\nTrump responds \u201cWell, she\u2019s going to go through some things,\u201d then says he will have Giuliani \u201cgive you a call\u201d with Attorney General Barr to \u201cget to the bottom of it.\u201d", "description": "The White House released a memo on Wednesday summarizing President Donald Trump's phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in July that prompted Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives to start an impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Heather Timmons", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433875447&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O1TR", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
