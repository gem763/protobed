All of K Street have been dealing with this since at least Obama was on the trail,\u201d said Cristina Antelo, CEO of Ferox Strategies. \u201cBashing lobbyists is a cheap and easy soundbite that belittles the vital role we play.\u201d\n\nAntelo has long had Democratic ties, working for Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonWarren defends, Buttigieg attacks in debate that shrank the field Democrats fear Ohio slipping further away in 2020 Poll: Warren leads Biden in Maine by 12 points MORE in the Senate in 2004 via the Democratic Steering Committee and volunteering on her 2008 presidential campaign.\n\nOne Democratic lobbyist said that while progressives might want to target lobbyists working for interests that are counter to their ideas, that is not all of K Street.\n\n\u201cLobbyists with clients that are unsavory, for example if you\u2019re lobbying for the NRA [National Rifle Association] ... but to put that on all of the industry is wrong,\u201d the lobbyist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said to The Hill.\n\nOthers worry Democratic candidates\u2019 policies will fail to bring the right changes to K Street.\n\nWarren has proposed an aggressive plan to target what she calls \u201cWashington corruption,\u201d with a proposed tax on annual lobbying expenditures of at least $500,000 a year, new definitions of what constitutes a lobbyist and bans on lobbying for foreign entities. Much of Warren\u2019s plan, though, would require congressional approval, a tough lift if the GOP keeps the Senate.\n\nWarren on Tuesday also released a plan to block federal candidates from taking corporate PAC money and establish public financing for conventions.\n\nSanders has also proposed a ban on corporate funding for conventions, as well as a lobbying ban on former members of Congress and senior staffers. His proposals could be enacted without Congress.\n\nThe lobbying industry has pushed back on those proposals as unconstitutional, arguing they would be a restriction on First Amendment rights.\n\nDemocratic lobbyists said while those proposals may be intended to target K Street\u2019s biggest spenders, they could also silence voices for progressive causes.\n\nMichaeleen Crowell, a former Sanders chief of staff, is a principal at S-3 Group, a bipartisan public affairs and lobbying firm.\n\n\u201cProgressives need to have a seat at the table. Being able to discuss policy differences and work collaboratively with those who have any number of political opinions allows me to bridge divides and work toward creative and innovative solutions,\u201d Crowell told The Hill.\n\nKate Mills at Monument Advocacy worried proposals going after lobbyists who donate to candidates are too broad.\n\n\u201cThe question is with all these plans, how are they going to deal with people like me? I\u2019m a lobbyist and it\u2019s personal money when I donate to campaigns and you know who all my clients are,\u201d Mills told The Hill.\n\nPrior to joining Monument in 2015, Mills was assistant director of the Office of Congressional Relations at Immigration and Customs Enforcement under President Obama and was a senior counsel to Rep. Zoe Lofgren Zoe Ellen LofgrenHillicon Valley: Google, Reddit to testify on tech industry protections | Trump joins Amazon-owned Twitch | House to vote on bill to combat foreign interference House to vote this month on legislation to combat foreign interference in elections Hillicon Valley: Zuckerberg to testify on Libra | Extremists find home on Telegram app | Warren blasts Facebook for not removing anti-Biden ad | California outlaws facial recognition in police body cameras | China rips US tech sanctions MORE (D-Calif.).\n\nMills said candidates would need to refine their proposals for K Street.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to have to pick and choose. Maybe they would have to look at in-house lobbyists and PACs before they look at contract lobbyists.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSanders\u2019s campaign defended his push for new rules on K Street.\n\n\u201cCorporate lobbyists should be very afraid of a Bernie Sanders presidency. Any lobbyist who thinks Bernie Sanders will give an inch on confronting corporate power in Washington is living in denial. The American people are sick of the unprecedented corruption and greed they see, and they are demanding a political revolution to end lobbyists\u2019 grip on Washington,\u201d Briahna Joy Gray, Sanders\u2019s national press secretary, said.\n\nWarren\u2019s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTalk of tougher rules on lobbying is nothing new and has long been a potent message for Democrats and progressives.\n\nObama also vowed to get tough on K Street as a candidate, running on proposals that aimed at shutting the revolving door between government and industry and rejecting corporate money.\n\nObama blocked recent registered lobbyists from working in his administration and former officials couldn\u2019t contact the agency they worked for until two years after leaving.\n\nBut critics questioned the effectiveness of those rules, noting that many former senior Obama officials went on to lobby for trade groups and major businesses. Victoria Espinel, a former Obama adviser on intellectual property, is CEO of BSA | The Software Alliance, and former press secretary Jay Carney is senior vice president of global corporate affairs at Amazon.\n\nPresident Trump Donald John TrumpWarren defends, Buttigieg attacks in debate that shrank the field Five takeaways from the Democratic debate in Ohio Democrats debate in Ohio: Who came out on top? MORE undid many of Obama\u2019s lobbying rules. Under Trump, agency officials are prevented from lobbying the agency they worked with for up to five years but are allowed to lobby other agencies.\n\nAntelo also questioned the effectiveness of Obama\u2019s tougher rules.\n\n\u201cThe Obama policy led to more folks going underground and underreporting their contacts, not a reduced impact of lobbying. More secret meetings at Caribou Coffee instead of the EEOB,\u201d she said, referring to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building.\n\nA persistent argument against tougher restrictions on lobbying is that they would lead to more so-called shadow lobbyists, those who do lobbying work but do not register. A lobbyist must register with the Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) if they spend 20 percent or more for a particular client on lobbying activities.\n\n\u201cPeople say I\u2019ll just be a consultant and limit my time with that client but still produce the same results for them,\u201d Mills said.\n\nWarren would revamp the definition of lobbyist to require anyone who lobbies to register with the LDA, removing the 20 percent baseline.\n\nBurt some Democratic lobbyists are brushing off the attacks on their industry. They say it\u2019s not surprising that Warren or Sanders would take on K Street on the campaign trail.\n\n\u201cThere are no concerns at this point because this is not surprising to anyone,\u201d one Democratic lobbyist told The Hill. \u201cIf this was Joe Biden Joe BidenWarren defends, Buttigieg attacks in debate that shrank the field Five takeaways from the Democratic debate in Ohio New study: Full-scale 'Medicare for All' costs trillion over 10 years MORE saying this or any conservative-leaning candidate, I think people would be surprised, but people would also be thinking, \u2018He\u2019s appealing to the liberal base.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAnother Democratic lobbyist said K Street had seen such rhetoric before.\n\n\u201cThis is no different than what President Obama said he would do,\u201d that lobbyist said.\n\nWarren\u2019s and Sanders\u2019s proposals, though, would go further than Obama.\n\nAntelo said Democratic candidates should instead be pushing proposals that increase transparency on K Street, allowing lobbyists for all sides to do their work, while being more open.\n\n\u201cLobbying isn\u2019t going away,\u201d she said. \u201cThey should focus instead on creating an environment that promotes disclosure.\u201d", "description": "Democratic lobbyists find themselves in a tough spot, eager for their party to recapture the White House in 2020 but also bristling at the top-tier candidates\u2019 attacks on K Street.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/kstreet_042919gn4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
