The Commerce Ministry and China\u2019s economic development agency decided on the measures, the report said.\n\nThe U.S. and China are finding ways to break deadlocked trade talks before planned high-level negotiations next month. President Trump on Wednesday put off until Oct. 15 a tariff increase on about $250 billion in imports from China that had been set to take effect Oct. 1. China\u2019s Commerce Ministry had said it welcomed Mr. Trump\u2019s gesture.\n\nIn addition, Beijing is looking to narrow the scope of its negotiations with the U.S. to only trade matters, seeking to put thornier national-security issues on a separate track, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nWrite to Chao Deng at Chao.Deng@wsj.com", "description": "The move by Beijing follows President Trump\u2019s two-week postponement of higher tariffs on some Chinese goods.", "authors": ["Chao Deng", "Chao.Deng Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106912/social", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
