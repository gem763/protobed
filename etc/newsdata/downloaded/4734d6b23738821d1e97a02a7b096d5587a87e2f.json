Nobody can beat us militarily. Nobody can even come close.\u201d\n\nTrump on Wednesday ordered Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to \"substantially increase sanctions\" on Iran.

But plenty of time, plenty of time.\u201d\n\nFriday\u2019s sanctions are the latest in a series of measures designed to tighten the screws and stop Tehran\u2019s sponsorship of terrorism in the region.\n\nThe Trump administration pulled the U.S. out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal last year and has re-imposed waves of sanctions since then. The latest sanctions come after last weekend's bombing on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities, an attack that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo described as \"an act of war.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTensions are likely to bubble up next week at the U.N. General Assembly where both U.S. and Iranian leaders, including Trump, will be in attendance. Trump said he wants to be restrained on the question of military action against Iran and would prefer that the country reform and then to succeed on its own.\n\nBut he added: \"Iran knows if they misbehave, they\u2019re on borrowed time.\u201d\n\nFox News' Adam Shaw and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "President Trump on Friday said he believes sanctions against Iran are working but indicated he would not hesitate to order military action if necessary, saying it would amount to a \u201cvery severe form of winning\u201d for the United States.", "authors": ["Alex Pappas", "Alex Pappas Is Senior Politics Editor At Foxnews.Com."], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/20/694940094001_6088078890001_6088079161001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
