Former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke was the beneficiary of a remarkable display of comradely cheerleading, as one rival after another praised his response to last month\u2019s mass shooting in O\u2019Rourke\u2019s hometown of El Paso. And they underscored the degree to which they broadly agree on issues ranging from gun control, climate change, immigration \u2014 and even, despite their fierce disputes on Medicare-for-all, on the need to guarantee health insurance to all Americans.\n\nThe debate Thursday at Texas Southern University in Houston seems likely to have a paradoxical political effect. On the one hand, nothing obvious happened to disturb the current advantages of the three leaders in the contest, former vice president Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). On the other hand, several candidates running further back in the polls made their presence felt in ways that will keep them in the minds of voters as plausible alternatives should the leaders falter.\n\nBiden had his strongest performance in the debates so far, showing moments of spark and fluency, and generally avoiding the gaffes and awkward pauses that hurt him in the June debate in Miami, although he got a bit lost Thursday in a response to a question about Afghanistan. Warren was energetic and forceful throughout, returning again and again to her themes of battling corruption, inequality and corporate power, even when discussing gun control. Sanders was his uncompromising and combative self, which, no doubt, reinforced the loyalty of his base.\n\nBut it was potentially a breakthrough evening for Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.), who has slipped in recent polling. Viewers saw what might be called \u201cHarris Unplugged.\u201d She was far looser, leavened her arguments with humor, and largely kept her focus on Trump. Her opening statement was directed to the president and ended with the words: \u201cAnd now, President Trump, you can go back to watching Fox News.\u201d Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.) showed passion throughout, assuming the role of preacher in describing \u201ca crisis of empathy in our nation.\u201d\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) unapologetically cast herself as the moderate in the race. \u201cIf you feel stuck in the middle of the extremes in our politics and you are tired of the noise and the nonsense,\u201d she said, \u201cyou\u2019ve got a home with me, because I don\u2019t want to be the president for half of America. I want to be the president for all of America.\u201d South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg continued to display moments of eloquence. He also offered, uncharacteristically for him, some sharp retorts, at one point speaking directly to Sanders in defending his alternative to Medicare-for-all \u2014 a public option that would allow Americans to choose Medicare voluntarily \u2014 by asking: \u201cI trust the American people to make the right choice for them. Why don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nBiden came in for a variety of gibes, as one would expect for the front-runner, but only former HUD secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro launched attacks with gusto, and even a touch of meanness. When Biden denied that his health-care plan required poor people to buy in, Castro argued that Biden was contradicting himself, and seemed to reference the former vice president\u2019s age by asking, \u201cAre you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\u201d The crowd booed.\n\nThe relative comity did not mean that Democratic divisions went unmentioned. There were clear ideological divides \u2014 particularly on health care.\n\nMaking arguments Republicans are certain to echo, Biden, Buttigieg and Klobuchar hit hard against Medicare-for-all plans that they said would require higher taxes and force Americans to give up private insurance. Warren and Sanders defended them as guaranteeing universality and taking insurance company profits out of the system.\n\nIt was the best debate so far, partly because the ABC News moderators did not focus quite as much as earlier questioners did on inspiring conflict. They also covered a broader range of issues, particularly with questions related to racism. Only political junkies were likely to have stuck with the ordeal to the end. Those who did were likely the most loyal Democrats who, on the whole, heard more of what they wanted to hear about Trump\u2019s shortcomings and less about divisions in their own ranks that could haunt them next fall.\n\nRead more from E.J.
