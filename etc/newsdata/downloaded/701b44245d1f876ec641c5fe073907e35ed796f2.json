FOREX-Dollar steady, though trade deal optimism aids riskier currencies\n\n* Impeachment risk recedes, Trump stokes trade-deal optimism\n\n* Dollar hands back some gains to trade-exposed currencies\n\n* Sterling nurses losses as Brexit outlook clouds\n\n* Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh\n\nBy Tom Westbrook\n\nSINGAPORE, Sept 26 (Reuters) - The dollar consolidated on\n\nThursday, staying near multi-week highs against most major\n\ncurrencies while slipping against riskier ones after U.S.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said there could be a trade deal with\n\nChina soon.\n\n\"It's the Trump pump, and it works,\" said Matt Simpson,\n\nsenior market analyst at Gain Capital in Singapore.\n\n\"But there's not really any major moves either, it's a\n\nslight boost to risk,\" he said, noting traders were also trying\n\nto assess the likely direction of a Trump impeachment probe\n\nopened by the Democrats on Wednesday.\n\nThe Australian dollar edged higher and the safe-haven yen\n\nwas marginally firmer at 107.65 per greenback, not far\n\nfrom a one-week low.\n\nThe euro bounced from an overnight two-week low but\n\nremained under $1.10 at $1.0959. Sterling also edged off\n\na two-week low hit as investors priced in many more months of\n\nBrexit and election risk, touching $1.2368 on Thursday.\n\nTrump stoked hopes for a trade deal by telling reporters in\n\nNew York that the U.S. and China were having \"good\n\nconversations\" and that an agreement \"could happen sooner than\n\nyou think\". That helped the Australian dollar claw 0.2% higher, while\n\nthe New Zealand dollar NZD=D3 kicked ahead further after New\n\nZealand's central bank governor said it was unlikely he'd need\n\nto use unconventional monetary policy. The kiwi rose 0.6% for the day to $0.6307. The Chinese yuan\n\nwas slightly firmer at 7.1229 per dollar.\n\nThe dollar index nudged lower to 98.877 after its\n\nsharpest rally in three months overnight. It remained stronger\n\nthan at any point last week.\n\nThe greenback had at first been sold when U.S. House of\n\nRepresentatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the Democratic-led\n\nchamber was launching an impeachment inquiry over Trump's\n\nhandling of a call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\n\nA summary of the call subsequently released by the\n\nadministration showed Trump pressed Zelenskiy to investigate\n\nformer Vice President Joe Biden - Trump's leading Democratic\n\nrival - but did not show Trump threatening to withhold aid.\n\nThe House inquiry could trigger a trial in the Senate on\n\nwhether to remove Trump from office, though that is seen as\n\nunlikely to succeed because Republicans control the Senate.\n\n\"Markets shrug these things off very, very quickly and we\n\nmove on to the next stuff,\" said Nick Twidale co-founder of\n\nSydney-based trade finance provider Xchainge, who said investors\n\nwere shifting the prospect of impeachment to the long-term.\n\n\"As it moves on, it's going to be interesting, but we have\n\nto go back to the fundamentals and fundamentals are going to\n\npush the dollar higher over time.\"\n\nEditing by Richard Borsuk)", "description": "FOREX-Dollar steady, though trade deal optimism aids riskier currencies", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEA6R05F_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
