The more you have of one, the less you have of the other,\" he told Reuters.\n\n\"If the government doesn't have the powers to enact legislation that reflects the European rulebook, that could make future debates over market access more difficult.\"\n\nDIVERGENCE OR CONVERGENCE\n\nBritain's parliament reconvened on Wednesday after the Supreme Court, Britain's highest judicial power, ruled that its suspension earlier this month was unlawful.\n\nBut it is not clear if parliament will approve the outstanding EU items or revisit a Financial Services Bill covering future EU regulation, seen critical to the smooth running of the UK finance industry after Brexit.\n\nBritain's finance ministry said it would ensure there was a fully functioning financial services regulatory regime from the day the country leaves the EU.\n\nThe two remaining items from the EU's existing rulebook will complete their \"onshoring\" into UK law once the suspension of parliament ended, a finance ministry spokesman said.\n\nBut a parliamentary bill to onshore pending EU financial rules has stumbled and bankers fear that the government may not commit to tracking these incoming rules, thus putting equivalence into doubt.\n\nThe legislation could get caught up in an unfolding debate about regulation in Britain and whether to keep tracking the EU or take a more independent approach.\n\n\"If you have a government intent on divergence not convergence, they might not put any priority on it at all,\" a senior official at an international bank said.\n\n\"In fact it might be rather odd for potentially a new government coming in and saying it wanted a full break with the EU in a no-deal Brexit, because this would be echoing EU legislation into UK law.\"\n\nThe finance ministry was unable to say that a specific financial services bill would be resubmitted.\n\n\"Details of future legislation will be set out in the next Queen's speech,\" it said, referring to when the head of state announces legislative plans at the start of a new parliamentary session.\n\nIt is unclear when the speech will be delivered as Britain could hold a general election in coming weeks.\n\nPost-Brexit plans for a new Financial Services Bill to turn so-called \"in-flight\" rules currently being finalised by the EU into UK law will now not be possible until after a general election.\n\nFailing to turn the \"in-flight\" rules into UK law would leave gaps that Brussels could use to deny equivalence, the bankers and industry representatives say.\n\nMeanwhile, Britain's financial services minister John Glen told a UK Finance dinner last week that Brexit gave an unprecedented opportunity to look again at a UK regulatory regime that will no longer be subject to EU horse-trading.\n\n\"In some cases, we may choose to pursue the same outcomes. In other cases, we may decide to do things differently,\" Glen said.", "description": "Bankers say Britain risks being shut out of EU financial market", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8O11G_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
