Terms of the financing are \u201cfar superior\u201d to a rival proposal from the bondholder group led by Elliott Management Corp. and Pacific Investment Management Co., the company said.\n\nThe financing was included in a PG&E filing defending its exclusive right to move forward with a plan to exit the largest utility bankruptcy in U.S. history. While the judge overseeing the case has already ruled that the San Francisco-based company should keep that control, the bondholder group is fighting to kill the exclusivity so it can pitch a proposal that would all but wipe out current shareholders and give creditors a controlling stake.\n\nPG&E blasted the group\u2019s proposal in Friday\u2019s filing, saying it would lead to an \u201cunjustified windfall\u201d of billions of dollars for the creditors at the expense of shareholders and utility customers. The plan, for example, would reinstate long-term debt at above-market rates, PG&E said.\n\nU.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali is scheduled to consider arguments over whether the company should retain its exclusivity during a hearing Monday. He signaled he\u2019ll be setting a high bar for the creditors behind the competing $29.2 billion restructuring plan, sending PG&E shares soaring 14% Friday.\n\nMontali wrote in an order late Thursday that the matter was already \u201cfully briefed, argued and decided\u201d when he ruled in August. The creditor group will have to explain \u201cwhat has changed in such a short period of time to justify reversing course,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe order could lend support to PG&E as it works to exit bankruptcy by the middle of next year. The company has been fighting creditors for months while struggling to balance the interests of ratepayers, shareholders, California regulators and the victims of wildfires ignited by its equipment. The blazes are what forced PG&E into bankruptcy, saddling it with an estimated $30 billion in liabilities.\n\nPG&E said in its court papers Friday that it has made substantial progress toward getting a plan confirmed. It has obtained more than $14 billion in equity commitments and settled for $11 billion with insurance companies and holders of insured claims, including the Baupost Group, which is also a large shareholder. The insurance group said Friday that it opposed Elliott\u2019s effort to allow competing reorganization plans.\n\nFire Victims\n\nThe Elliott and Pimco group is proposing a restructuring that would pay out $25.5 billion to victims of the wildfires and their insurers. A group of wildfire victims have signed off on the plan and are supporting the creditors\u2019 petition to strip PG&E of its exclusivity.\n\nThe PG&E filing Friday cited an email exchange between a wildfire attorney and Elliott to buttress the company\u2019s argument that the two were working for their own interests at the expense of other parties. After being informed by Elliott of a settlement between PG&E and insurance companies, one of the wildfire victims\u2019 attorneys, Frank Pitre, replied, \u201cLet\u2019s get our deal done and screw them all!,\u201d according to the filing.\n\nPitre said in an email to Bloomberg that he will respond to the PG&E filing in court. The creditors group declined to comment.\n\nPG&E said Elliott and the fire victims hadn\u2019t presented \u201cany evidence to support the magnitude of claims Elliott has taken upon itself to settle.\u201d The utility reiterated its proposal to enter into mediation with fire victims to reach a settlement.\n\nAttorneys for wildfire victims have expressed frustration with PG&E over reaching a settlement and moved last month to align themselves with Elliott and the other bondholders. PG&E\u2019s biggest labor union, the official creditors committee that includes power providers, and ratepayer advocates and a separate wildfire victims group also supported opening up the bankruptcy to competing plans in filings earlier this week.\n\nMontali, however, appears hesitant to give the bondholders too much control over the company\u2019s path forward, said Katie Bays, a utility analyst for Sandhill Strategy LLC.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- PG&E Corp., seeking to fend off a group of bondholders trying to take control of its bankruptcy, said it has lined up $34.4 billion in debt financing commitments for its planned reorganization.The California utility giant has received the commitments from banks including JPMorgan Chase", "authors": ["Mark Chediak"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/yudQ_HcDl_EivclzaXhyjA--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/6a1c19eb931590361394a5014a69da67", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
