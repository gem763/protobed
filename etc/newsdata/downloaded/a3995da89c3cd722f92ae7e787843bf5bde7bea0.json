Amir Ismael/Business Insider\n\nReady or not, fall hath reared its chilled breath in the northern hemisphere. Time to put the board shorts and boats to bed and break out the socks, shoes, and soon enough, the shovels. Yeah, I'm not too thrilled either. But we can also wave goodbye to mosquito bites and sunburns, and then there's the electric-blanket comfort of flannel, and time to \"Netflix and chill,\" whatever that means.\n\nBut back to the flannel. There are plenty of great brands out there, and there's no shortage of those with decades upon decades of heritage. While Toad&Co is by no means the new kid in town (the brand got its start in a Colorado garage in the early '90s), it offers soft, comfortable, and ( Oeko-Tex 100-certified) organic cotton at a steal.\n\nA year in, here's how it's held up\n\nAnd here's the unadulterated shirt, in case the presence of yours truly and the yellow brick wall behind me was too much of a contaminant. Amazon\n\nI received this shirt from the brand a little under a year ago, and I wore it all fall, winter, and spring, until it was time to break out the linen shirts. It suffered through countless washes in both my cheap-as-hell, garment-shredding washer and drier (no, really, they've killed many a shirt), and as I wear it today, there's not a loose thread, button, or stitch upon it. Come to think of it, Insider Picks should probably test all of our clothing that we consider for review in that utterly compassionless contraption.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nIf you're not donning suit and tie to work, and you're existing somewhere north of, say, the Tropic of Cancer, there's a good chance you'll be needing something along the lines of a flannel shirt at some point in the coming months, and then again the following year, and likely the one after that (and I'd put down good money that this shirt will see them all). Death, taxes, and winter are all inevitable facts of life outside the tropics. Alas, we might as well reach for the good stuff, and while it's on sale, no doubt.", "description": "Fall's here, and ready or not, it's time to break out the flannel.
