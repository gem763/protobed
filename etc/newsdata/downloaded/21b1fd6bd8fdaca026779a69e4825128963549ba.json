Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said on Monday.\n\nSouth Korea operates some 60 coal-fired plants, generating about 40% of the country\u2019s electricity, but is facing growing calls to improve air quality, rated as the worst among its peers in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in 2017. [nL3N2100QS]\n\nSouth Korea has halted some ageing coal-fired power plants in recent years to reduce air pollution. But the National Climate Change and Air Quality committee recommended closing up to 14 over December to February and up to 27 in March, dramatically scaling up the closures.[nL3N20N065]\n\nThe committee, set up President Moon Jae-in, also recommended capping operations at other coal-fired power plants during those months at 80%. At present, plants are only capped at 80% when an air pollution advisory is issued. [nL4N1XH3XD]\n\n\u201cThe gist of our policy proposal is cutting air pollutant emissions by over 20% from a year earlier through reduction measures,\u201d the group said in a statement.\n\nFor the transportation sector, the advisory body suggested restrictions on older diesel vehicles and introducing incentives to encourage ships entering the country\u2019s ports to use low sulphur fuel oil.\n\nThe government would consider implementing group\u2019s proposals, the group said.", "description": "South Korea should close up to a quarter of its coal-fired power plants between December and February and nearly half in March in a bid to tackle pollution, an advisory body headed by former U.N.
