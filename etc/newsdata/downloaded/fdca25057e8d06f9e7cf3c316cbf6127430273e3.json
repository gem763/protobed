His program Conversando con Correa (\u201cTalking with Correa\u201d) featured Maduro this week.\n\n\u201cVenezuela is not being sanctioned, it is being attacked,\u201d said Correa. \u201cEven if they were sanctions, on what basis are they? Under what international law?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor that reason, I will say something that is not an exaggeration,\u201d Maduro responded. \u201cDonald Trump has a kind of obsession and hatred against the Latin American people in general, against refugees, immigrants \u2026 but he has a special hatred for the people of Venezuela and all our history.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Donald Trump is playing out that hatred against the people of Venezuela in a similar way to Nazi Germany, with the same vision that Hitler had against the European Jews in the 1930s before war broke out in 1939,\u201d Maduro alleged.\n\nMaduro a Correa: \"Yo lo comparo a Trump con la era de Hitler\" Venezuela: realidades y mitos, persecuci\u00f3n financiera mundial, manipulaci\u00f3n medi\u00e1tica, modelo rentista\u2026 son algunos de los temas que abordar\u00e1n @MashiRafael y @NicolasMaduro en el programa #ConversandoConCorrea. pic.twitter.com/YtAfaibZIO \u2014 RT en Espa\u00f1ol (@ActualidadRT) September 18, 2019\n\nMaduro then went on to mock the legitimate president of Venezuela, Juan Guaid\u00f3, who has failed to wrestle power away from the socialist dictatorship and instigate a transition to democracy.\n\n\u201cThe strategy of building a parallel government with the support of the United States and its Latin American allies from the Lima Group, it has failed, it has no chance of success,\u201d Maduro said.\n\nHe continued:\n\nThe real power is in the hands of the European oligarchic structures, they are the closest allies of the American government. They are like blood brothers. Donald Trump has imposed his extremist policies towards Venezuela on Europe. There is a distorted image of Venezuela in the international media, and then there is the real Venezuela that you can see with your own eyes. It is nation that above all protects itself, like a family.\n\nThe Russian government is one of the few in the world to continue recognizing Maduro as the head of state of Venezuela, despite his term expiring in January. Moscow actively supports Maduro financially and militarily. As an arm of the Putin regime, RT regularly attempts to downplay the extent of Venezuela\u2019s economic and humanitarian crisis while giving substantial coverage to individuals blaming the country\u2019s problems on the United States.\n\nCorrea and Maduro have long been friends and allies on the basis of their shared socialist principles. As president, Correa was a strong supporter of the late dictator Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and counted on support from a collection of leftist leaders that rose to prominence in the region in the 2000s. Most have since lost power, ceding their leadership to more right-leaning heads of state, most notably Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil, Mauricio Macri in Argentina, and Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era in Chile.\n\nLast year, an Ecuadorian court issued an arrest warrant for Correa over his alleged involvement in the kidnapping of the lawmaker and political opponent Fernando Balda in 2012. Criminal investigations into his political tenure began after he refused to testify on his deals with China, in which he sold vast amounts of oil to Beijing at low prices in what the Ecuadorian Prosecutor General last year described as the \u201cgreatest heist in the country\u2019s history.\u201d He has so far refused to abide the warrant and remains in his wife\u2019s native Belgium, from where he is yet to face extradition.\n\nDuring his decade in office, Correa himself faced criticisms for his left-wing authoritarianism, which included attempts to curtail the freedom of the press and threatening and persecuting political opponents. In 2015, he also stoked controversy by responding to accusations of fascism by tweeting \u201cHeil Hitler!\u201d That same year, he also attacked President Barack Obama\u2019s views on American history, declaring it \u201ctroubling that an Afro minimizes history.\u201d\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "Venezuelan dictator Nicol\u00e1s Maduro compared President Donald Trump to Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler in an interview.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/08/GettyImages-1158326025-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
