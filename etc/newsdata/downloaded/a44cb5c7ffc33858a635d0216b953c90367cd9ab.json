My one concern for Slack on Wednesday was whether the market was focused on the bottom line, rather than the top line and billings. Guess what the headlines talking about dismal guidance focused on? The bottom line for next quarter. We saw a similar reaction with Palo Alto.\n\nThe initial reaction sent Palo Alto down by 10%, but as the company talked about the cloud, shares reversed course and found their way to green. From an after-hours low of $180 after a $200 close, all the way to a $220 printing in the pre-market this morning. The irony here is the confusion I'm reading among analysts this morning in regards to Palo Alto's business model transition or non-transition, as the case may be. Additionally, the company lowered free cash flow margins from to 30% from 37%, but yet discussed little of the transition, which would have explained the decrease.\n\n\n\nConfusion among analysts is not a positive thing.\n\nI understand the need to transition. PANW is at the heart of a maturing business and a maturing industry. It's one of the reasons the stock initially sold down. Earnings per share came in a nickel ahead of expectations, with revenue of $805.8 million, which edged past estimates.\n\nBut the cloud is the future, not PANW's legacy architecture. That core will still have a place to come, but we'll see that revenue year-over-year growth of 28% begin to decline. Billings did exceed $1 billion, but the 22% growth will need to remain stable for PANW to continue to garner its current multiples. That's the challenge of a maturing business and the law of large numbers.\n\nMaybe I'm off here, but the small $75 million buy of Zingbox may the best thing to come out of the report. Getting involved in the Internet of Things -- a.k.a. IoT -- will help transition, but I foresee several more small buys like this by PANW over the next 12-18 months. It needs to get even more involved in the cloud as quickly as possible.\n\nIn terms of the price action, there's an atypical bearish head-and-shoulders pattern on the weekly chart traders need to watch. A weekly close under $200 would be very bearish. On the buy side, I'm not looking, unless I'm willing to buy $200 with a very tight stop and play the bounce or buying on a close above $220 or $230. I think I'm in the $230 camp at the moment, but $220 might get me nibbling.\n\nSecondary indicators are showing consolidation, which makes sense when we add in the shoulder trading range of the past four months. Overall, I came away from the PANW report with a neutral-to-cautious view. I would get interested in the $170-$180 range should $200 fail to hold as support. This one lands in the look, but don't touch category in the near term.", "description": "As the initial wild ride of PANW settles down, here are the stock's sweet spots....PANW", "authors": ["Timothy Collins", "You'Ve Got To Parse Palo Alto'S Earnings To See Big Picture", "As The Initial Wild Ride Of Panw Settles Down", "Here Are The Stock'S Sweet Spots.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Jim Cramer", "James", "Rev Shark", "Paul Price", "Helene Meisler"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/8be8c371-3a9b-11e9-9b32-551097edac3e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
