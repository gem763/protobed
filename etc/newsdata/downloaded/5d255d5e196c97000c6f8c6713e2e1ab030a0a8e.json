We were just the actors there,\u201d Seiger said.\n\nSeiger recalled that after Trump offered the family his condolences, he quickly dropped the bombshell that Anne Sacoolas \u2014 the American woman whose car struck their son, British police say \u2014 was willing to meet and was in the next room. Seiger told Cooper he shot down the idea, saying: \u201cNo, Mr. President, that\u2019s not why we\u2019re here.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe said he explained to Trump that the circumstances were not appropriate. \u201cIf we ever do this, it\u2019s going to be in England when she [Sacoolas] is going through the court system,\u201d Seiger added.\n\nDunn, 19, was killed in August when his motorcycle was struck by a car that police say was driven by Sacoolas, 42, who has acknowledged that she was driving on the wrong side of the road at the time of the crash. Sacoolas, as the wife of a U.S. government official, claimed diplomatic immunity under international law and returned to the United States a few weeks later.\n\nHarry Dunn\u2019s parents, Tim Dunn and Charlotte Charles, told CBS that the meeting took their breath away. Not only was the president of the United States proposing they meet with Sacoolas, but Trump wanted the meeting to happen there and then \u2014 unplanned and thrust upon them.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump said Wednesday that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson asked him to set up the meeting. But on Thursday, a spokesperson for Johnson contradicted Trump\u2019s claim, saying: \u201cThe PM and the president spoke last Wednesday, and the PM asked the president to do all he could to resolve the issue.\u201d\n\n\u201cDuring the conversation, the president raised a possibility of a meeting with Anne Sacoolas at the White House, but at that stage we weren\u2019t aware of any plans for the family to go [to the United States] so it wasn\u2019t discussed further.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to Fox News on Thursday, White House spokesman Hogan Gidley defended the president\u2019s actions. Trump \u201cwasn\u2019t trying to ambush anybody,\u201d said Gidley, who also reiterated Trump\u2019s claim that the meeting took place \u201cat the behest of Boris Johnson.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nFOX NEWS: Did Trump apply pressure during his meeting w/ grieving parents of a UK teen who was killed in accident involving wife of US diplomat?\n\n\n\nHOGAN GIDLEY: No. He was wonderful\n\n\n\nFN: The parents said it was 'an ambush' and 'terrifying'\n\n\n\nGIDLEY: Again, that's their description pic.twitter.com/t1rS76zhlZ \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) October 17, 2019\n\nWhile Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn have long expressed desire to meet with Sacoolas, they have maintained that they want any meeting to take place on British soil with trained mental health experts on hand to help both sides come to terms with the situation.\n\nDunn\u2019s parents said Trump asked them repeatedly during the meeting if they would meet with Sacoolas even though they had already declined the offer.\n\nAD", "description": "\u201cIt didn\u2019t feel beautiful,\u201d the spokesman said in a television interview, describing Trump's efforts to prod the grieving parents to meet the woman blamed for the death of their son.", "authors": ["Jennifer Hassan", "Social Media Editor For The Foreign Desk"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/GhddHDriUcZXQBsjV6moT7ZPAfQ=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/10-16-2019/t_0984857e56424105b9db24bde14f050b_name_1920_harry_dunn_scaled.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
