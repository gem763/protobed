But the one she heard last November seemed too generous to be true.\n\nA nonprofit organization was looking to give 20 African American single mothers living in public housing $1,000 each month for a year. They\u2019d be able to use the money in any way they pleased.\n\n\u201cI could do anything?\u201d Gray, a 25-year-old single mother of two, recalled thinking, because this was not the way assistance programs typically worked.\n\nFor decades, Republicans and Democrats alike have tried to push families out of poverty by adding restrictions to government welfare programs. There were work mandates, time limits, benefit caps \u2014 rules aimed at pointing families toward what the government thinks are good choices.\n\nNow, there is increasing interest in trying out the reverse. Here, in the cradle of the South, the women would be a part of one of the first pilot programs in the country to assess a seemingly simple solution to systemic poverty: giving people money \u2014 no strings attached.\n\nThe idea of guaranteed income is gaining traction, from the presidential debate stage to Silicon Valley, where tech titans such as Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk have promoted it as a way to fend off a gloomy future in which automation and climate change eliminate millions of jobs. Activists associated with the Movement for Black Lives are advocating guaranteed income for African Americans as a form of reparations for slavery.\n\nNow, some Democratic hopefuls have promoted the concept as a way to reduce wealth inequality. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) has proposed providing every child born in the United States $1,000 in interest-bearing accounts known as \u201cbaby bonds.\u201d Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) is pitching guaranteed tax refunds of up to $6,000 for families making less than six figures. And entrepreneur Andrew Yang has staked his entire campaign on a \u201cuniversal basic income\u201d \u2014 giving $1,000 a month to every American adult.\n\nOpponents of such programs argue that they would add at least billions to the deficit while providing too little oversight of recipients, who might abuse the privilege \u2014 claims that supporters say are rooted in stereotypes.\n\n\u201cAmericans will work even harder when they\u2019re given the resources to get ahead,\u201d Yang said recently on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cThe money will go right into local Main Street businesses, to car repairs, to day care, to Little League.\u201d\n\n\n\nGray and her children, Allonah and Alonzo Hawkins, ages 7 and 9. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\nIn Jackson, Gray just wanted to escape poverty. She had grown up poor and was pregnant at 16, which is when she started hearing people say she\u2019d \u201cnever become nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wanted to show I could do it all on my own,\u201d she said.\n\nShe tried to defy the stereotypes by staying in school and going to Jackson State University. Her bachelor\u2019s degree in social work led her to $40,000 in student loan debt, a busted car and a cleaning job that paid no more than $11 an hour.\n\nShe had gotten used to the sound of gunshots while living in government-subsidized housing. The hallways smelled like old cigarettes, and her two children \u2014 Alonzo, 9, and Allonah, 7 \u2014 slept in the same room. An emptiness surrounded them: vacant lots and pothole-laden streets with no sidewalks, boarded-up houses and abandoned strip malls.\n\nShe tried to remain positive by telling herself what the rapper Tupac Shakur once said: The things that you do as a caterpillar make you whatever butterfly you\u2019re going to be. She kept participating in programs she thought would help, going to presentation after presentation by local nonprofit groups. But over time, being one pothole away from a financial disaster and trying to tend to her children after working overnight, her ambition shriveled.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not even sure what I want to do now,\u201d Gray said recently. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to be living like this.\u201d\n\nWith the new money, she figured she could pay for graduate school so she could get a job with decent hours. Maybe she could find a new place to live.\n\nBut the money came with a natural consequence for families using the social safety net. More income triggered decreases in government help. She lost the $150 she received each month for food stamps. Because her rent was linked to her income, her monthly housing payment rose from $300 to $757.\n\n***\n\n\n\nAisha Nyandoro, founder and chief executive of Springboard to Opportunities, works at her office in Jackson. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\nFor all the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 writing and programming that the Springboard to Opportunities workforce development program does to launch its clients into the middle class, its chief executive found that mothers still had one continual need.\n\n\u201cMy mothers need cash,\u201d said Aisha Nyandoro, also helped to establish the Jackson-based program.\n\nThey fretted over bills. They\u2019d miss work because they couldn\u2019t repair a car, or because they couldn\u2019t afford child care. \u201cI just need $25,\u201d Nyandoro recalled one mother telling her. The woman\u2019s child had qualified for a citywide science fair, but she didn\u2019t have enough cash to pay for registration.\n\nThe requirements accompanying public assistance such as food stamps and housing vouchers left her clients \u201cpigeonholed,\u201d without the flexibility to craft budgets based on their specific situations, Nyandoro said.\n\nThis search for cash \u2014 not politics or job-sapping technology \u2014 is why she said she sought out a fledgling foundation co-chaired by Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes called the Economic Security Project, which is sponsoring guaranteed-income projects in Stockton, Calif., and Chicago.\n\nTrying the experiment in conservative Mississippi, though, made the program inherently different.\n\nThe women live in a state with some of the most restrictive social service systems in the country. Minimum wage is $7.25. And a 2018 study by the National Conference of State Legislatures showed that Mississippi had the harshest penalties in the country for recipients not meeting work requirements for food stamps.\n\nAnd yet, in an area where jobs were scarce and transportation options were lacking, the social safety net was the most secure source of income clients had. Some worried about how much their benefits would be cut if they took the monthly checks from Nyandoro\u2019s program, and about the bureaucracy that might be involved if they needed to reclaim those benefits.\n\nOf the 110 women eligible to be a part of the program, only 38 applied.\n\n\n\nThe sun sets over downtown Jackson. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\nThe 20 women selected for the experiment in November 2018 earned an average of $12,000 a year at the time. Fifteen of the women were working. Twelve had reported being so short on cash that they had used an emergency lender in the preceding six months.\n\nThe women started receiving the checks in December. Many of them kept their participation secret because they were afraid that neighbors and relatives might ask for money. To protect their privacy, Nyandoro held a meeting in a place that people in their community rarely ventured: a gourmet ice-pop shop in an upscale neighborhood about a 10-minute drive away.\n\nSome of the women talked about their gift-filled Christmases and sported new hairstyles. Some said they took a sick day for the first time. They began paying off overdue electricity bills and high-interest loans.\n\nKira Johnson, a social worker, asked how much money the women had saved.\n\n\u201cI blew all of it,\u201d Gray recalled. \u201cIt only took a weekend.\u201d\n\nMost of the women said the same thing. In a month, nearly all of the money had vanished.\n\nThe situation exposed a truth about poverty. The women knew how to make minimum-wage paychecks stretch, Johnson said, but they had little experience with discretionary income.\n\n\u201cThen, they asked if we were going to hand them the next check,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nWhen Johnson heard the request, she realized something else: Before the program, most of the women had not used a bank account.\n\n***\n\nGray and her children head for school on the first day back after summer break. Alonzo gets ready for school. Allonah fixes her hair before school.\n\nTOP: Gray and her children head for school on the first day back after summer break. BOTTOM LEFT: Alonzo gets ready for school. BOTTOM RIGHT: Allonah fixes her hair before school.\n\nThe discussion at the shop exposed another truth for the women: Receiving money would not be enough on its own to lift them out of poverty. If they were going to save anything, the women said they would need a little more guidance and support about how to do it. Johnson set them up with a financial adviser who taught them about savings accounts, interest rates and building credit.\n\nSoon, Johnson said, the women began sharing small victories. One woman used the extra money to take time off and finish community college. Some sent their children to day camp. One woman filled her gas tank to drive her children to see their grandfather in Pennsylvania. The children had never met him.\n\nAt the end of six months, none of the women reported using an emergency lender. Nearly all said they had enough money to buy school supplies, when fewer than half had said that before. They reported cooking more balanced meals, visiting the doctor and attending church more often.\n\n\u201cThe beauty of all of this has just been how folks are light,\u201d Nyandoro said. \u201cThey aren\u2019t walking around with the heaviness of life that, unfortunately, so many times low-income folks have to carry.\u201d\n\nMany women who were employed found better jobs. But, despite Yang\u2019s prediction, the number of women who were in the workforce did not change. Similar results were reported from a guaranteed-income study that took place in Finland.\n\nEyitayo Onifade, who is the director of the Center for Children and Families at Clark Atlanta University who is evaluating the Jackson program, said wages were so low in the city that there was not much incentive to choose employment, particularly for single mothers.\n\n\u201cThe women attached to the workforce were not making much more money than the women who were not attached to the workforce,\u201d Onifade said. \u201cSo some make the choice that they\u2019d rather spend time raising their children.\u201d\n\nGray\u2019s relationship with money changed dramatically. She used to want to put her children in the hottest clothes to prove that she was providing for them, but now saw the value of visiting the clearance racks. She paid off $4,000 in credit card debt. She found an $11-an-hour teaching job at a preschool and another part-time job, so she could save more money. As her new bank account grew from zero to $1,000 to $2,000, she began looking to leave the projects.\n\nWhen a friend told her about a program to help low-income families buy houses, she decided to apply.\n\nIn April, Gray learned that her application had been approved. A local affiliate with the faith-based Habitat for Humanity would provide her with a no-interest, 30-year mortgage after a $1,000 down payment for a renovated home.\n\nGray had to agree to attend financial literacy workshops and complete 125 hours of \u201csweat equity\u201d \u2014 hammering nails, painting and doing other tasks with the volunteers that Habitat uses to keep costs low.\n\nOn a summer evening, she took Alonzo and Allonah to the place that would be their new home. It is in a quiet neighborhood, and it has a large front yard and yellow siding. Through the windows, they could see that the home had been gutted.\n\n\u201cI like it, Mom,\u201d Allonah recalled saying.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d Alonzo said.\n\nThe windows were so big that he worried he might get hurt if a bullet came through.\n\n***\n\nGray and volunteers work on the house she is buying through Habitat for Humanity. Gray works on her home. A message on a wall in Gray's house.\n\nTOP: Gray and volunteers work on the house she is buying through Habitat for Humanity. BOTTOM LEFT: Gray works on her home. BOTTOM RIGHT: A message on a wall in Gray's house.\n\nA few weeks later, Alonzo and Allonah stuffed their new backpacks with erasers, colored pencils and notebooks. Gray put on a pair of leggings and a ball cap.\n\nIt was the children\u2019s first day of school. And, according to the calculations she kept in a little book, it was Gray\u2019s the last day volunteering to work on the house.\n\nAfter dropping off the children, she drove to the work site. She stepped out of her car and took a deep breath. Pine trees perfumed the air.\n\n\u201cYou working today?\u201d asked David Smith, the construction manager. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be pretty tough. The heat index is 110 degrees.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s my last day,\u201d Gray said.\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d Smith said. He was eager to show the progress they had made since the last time Gray volunteered. The two walked inside. It was still mostly wood framing and cinder blocks, but he asked her to envision a dream more full.\n\nAt one end of the house were rooms for her children, and she wondered how easy it would be for them to adjust having more space. Then, they entered the master bedroom, with a closet so big she couldn\u2019t possibly have enough clothes to fill it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have my own dishwasher?\u201d she said as he showed her the kitchen area. Then she mouthed, \u201cWow.\u201d\n\nKira Johnson, the social worker, pulled up to the site. She smiled at Gray\u2019s new home. This place was a big step, but Johnson reminded her that a new house was only one of the ways to break out of poverty.\n\nJohnson asked about her son, who had failed his reading assessment last year. Gray was now spending $60 a week to send her children to tutoring.\n\n\u201cAre you reading to him?\u201d Johnson asked. Gray told her she tried, but that sometimes she was just too sleepy after work. She said he could read the words but was frustrated by not knowing their meaning.\n\n\u201cWhat the heck is wrong with me?\u201d Gray recalled her son saying.\n\n\n\nGray at the house being prepared by Habitat for Humanity.\n\nThen there was Gray\u2019s own education. She told the social worker it was still too expensive to carry out her plan to go to school full time. And there was no time to take classes when she was still working two jobs.\n\n\u201cMaybe you should just take a course,\u201d Johnson suggested.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Gray said, looking away.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re saying okay, but your face is not saying okay.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just think school is down the road,\u201d Gray said.\n\nStill, Gray was gaining hope. Nine months into the program, she had saved close to $13,000.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m making something of myself,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t worry that much about money no more.\u201d\n\nOutside, Smith was gathering the group of volunteers who had come to help Gray build her home. They were about to rush inside.\n\n\u201cAll right everyone, let\u2019s go inside,\" he said. \u201cLet\u2019s go!
