REUTERS/Henry Nicholls\n\n(Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is facing a new rebellion from his cabinet over concerns of a no-deal Brexit, with a group of cabinet ministers poised to resign, The Times newspaper reported on Wednesday.\n\nCulture Secretary Nicky Morgan, British Minister for Northern Ireland Julian Smith, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland, Health Minister Matt Hancock and Attorney General Geoffrey Cox are all on a \"resignation watch list\", according to The Times report bit.ly/33fODZW.\n\nAn unnamed cabinet minister cited by the newspaper said that a \u201cvery large number\u201d of Conservative members of parliament will quit if it comes to a no-deal Brexit.\n\nThe Times said that ministers had warned Johnson in a cabinet meeting about the \u201cgrave\u201d risk of the return of direct rule in Northern Ireland and raised concerns about Dominic Cummings, Johnson\u2019s most senior adviser.\n\n\u201cCabinet will set the strategy, not unelected officials. If this is an attempt to do that then it will fail\u201d, the report quoted another cabinet minister as saying.\n\nThe report comes as the European Union accused Britain of playing a \u201cstupid blame game\u201d over Brexit after a Downing Street source told Reuters a deal was essentially impossible because German Chancellor Angela Merkel had made unacceptable demands.\n\nWith just over three weeks before the United Kingdom is due to leave the European bloc, the future of Brexit remains deeply uncertain as both London and Brussels position themselves to avoid blame for a delay or a disorderly no-deal Brexit.", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is facing a new rebellion from his cabinet over concerns of a no-deal Brexit, with a group of cabinet ministers poised to resign, The Times newspaper reported on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438661043&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9802V", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
