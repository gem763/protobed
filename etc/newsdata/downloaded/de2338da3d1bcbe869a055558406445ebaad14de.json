Will we get yet another flip-flop? Traders are increasingly less confident in the number of cuts the FOMC will carry out this year. A hawkish cut is a firm possibility, albeit the median projected fed funds rate from the dot plot should come down a touch,\" he added.\n\nOil also has trimmed its gains on Wednesday, after collapsing 13% since the initial spike, after Reuters reported that Saudi Arabia's output is expected to resume at normal levels in the next two to three weeks. The report cited a top Saudi source, who was unnamed.\n\n\"More optimism that production output will return to levels before the drone and missile attacks on Saudi Arabia before the end of September should encourage further declines in oil by the end of the week,\" said Wilson.\n\nHe added that it wouldn't be \"surprising\" if Brent crude edged back to $60 by the end of the week.\n\nHere's how markets look on Wednesday morning at 9 am in London (4 am EST):\n\nUS futures are set to open down marginally with the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all down 0.1%.\n\nEurope also opened muted, with the DAX and Euro Stoxx up 0.1%.\n\nAsian stocks were a bit more mixed, with the Nikkei dropping 0.2%, the Shanghai Composite up 0.3% and the Hang Seng down 0.2%.\n\nIn terms of commodities, Brent crude is down 0.3% around $64 a barrel, while WTI is down 0.4% hovering around $58.\n\nGold prices are also down 0.3%.\n\nMarkets Insider", "description": "Markets on Monday morning were muted, with US futures notching down, while European stocks opened rising marginally as 'all eyes are on the Fed.'\u00a0 Th...", "authors": ["Finanzen.Net Gmbh"], "top_image": "https://images.markets.businessinsider.com/image/5d81e0ea2e22af6de6108205-2400/2019-08-23t220936z2lynxnpef7m1yortroptp4usa-fed-jacksonhole-powell.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
