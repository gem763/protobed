Look, whoever's behind these doors might need my help. I'm going in,\" Harbour says.\n\nAfter mistaking a trapped Aidy Bryant for \"Stranger Things\" character Barb (justice for Barb!) and seeing Beck Bennett get attacked by a Demogorgon, Harbour stumbles across Davidson.\n\n\"No, it can't be: Pete Davidson!\" Harbour exclaims. \"Is this where you've been? In the Upside Down?\"\n\n\"Yeah dude, it's lit,\" Davidson responds.\n\n'Saturday Night Live' skewers LGBTQ town hall, Ellen DeGeneres with Billy Porter, Lin-Manuel Miranda cameos\n\nDavid Harbour hosts: 'SNL' reimagines 'Joker' with parody of Sesame Street, Oscar the Grouch\n\nWhen a gate to the \ud835\udd4c\ud835\udd61\ud835\udd64\ud835\udd5a\ud835\udd55\ud835\udd56 \ud835\udd3b\ud835\udd60\ud835\udd68\ud835\udd5f appears in Studio 8H\u2026 \ud83d\ude33 #SNL pic.twitter.com/ebbgiP1C1x \u2014 Saturday Night Live - SNL (@nbcsnl) October 13, 2019\n\nUltimately, Davidson wanted answers to the question that most fans are wondering: Did Hopper really die at the end of Season 3?\n\nHarbour stuttered around the question, not being able to reveal any secrets: \"No, I mean I'm not exactly authorized. Uh, just watch the show, you'll find out next season.\"\n\nRelated: Did 'Stranger Things' really kill (spoiler!) in Season 3?\n\nDavidson also returned later in the show for the Weekend Update segment with Colin Jost and Michael Che, where he sat down to offer his professional opinion on the reported rise of treatable STDs being attributed to the rise of dating apps.\n\n\"I understand people can be worried about STDs. I get tested for STDS all the time, because I look like I have all of them, and I might have created my own,\" Davidson joked. \"The flu can last like a month but syphilis is like four days, bring it on.\"\n\nDavidson also bemoaned the return of gonorrhea.\n\n\"Does everything in my generation have to be a reboot?\" Davidson joked. \"The clap and 'Rambo' came back in the same year, and neither of them were wanted.\"\n\n'Stranger Things' star David Harbour: Blaming shootings on mental illness is 'cowardly'\n\nPete Davidson stops show to unleash NSFW tirade against college audience\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: SNL: David Harbour finds Pete Davidson in 'Stranger Things' monologue", "description": "After missing the first two episodes of \"Saturday Night Live,\" host David Harbour managed to find Pete Davidson in the Upside Down.", "authors": ["Anika Reed", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5b5jcgPpdy3BWmi3ckBkZw--~B/aD01NDA7dz05NjA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://d.yimg.com/hd/cp-video-transcode/1009217/cc22d64f-15ca-4c00-affa-02d1794aab2b/75497f6f-9127-5e99-a519-ce51c29fb7f1/data_3_0.jpg?s=12005b30a887832371d533fedd7fa953&c=075468f6a932a5ceb39c880e4c0fcd05&a=tripleplay4us&mr=0", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
