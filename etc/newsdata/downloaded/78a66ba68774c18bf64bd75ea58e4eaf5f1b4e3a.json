REUTERS/Akhtar Soomro/Files\n\nISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan\u2019s consumer inflation edged up to 10.49% year-on-year in August, accelerating slightly from 10.3% a month earlier, following the inclusion of rural markets in the inflation survey, the Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday.\n\nPrevious inflation figures factored price changes only in Pakistan\u2019s urban markets. Under that metric, the inflation rate would have surged to 11.63%.\n\nThe spike was driven by higher food and fuel prices, continuing the squeeze on household budgets.\n\nPrices of food products such as chicken, tomatoes and onions, which make up a third of the overall basket used to calculate inflation, rose 3.42% from the previous month.", "description": "Pakistan's consumer inflation edged up to 10.49% year-on-year in August, accelerating slightly from 10.3% a month earlier, following the inclusion of rural markets in the inflation survey, the Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1426051587&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF830J2"}
