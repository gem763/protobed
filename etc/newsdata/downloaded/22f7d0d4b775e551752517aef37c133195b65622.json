Clashes between police and activists were less intense than at the start of October when the city was virtually shut down\n\nHong Kong riot police spent much of Sunday afternoon skirmishing with small groups of masked pro-democracy protesters who held flashmob gatherings in multiple locations -- although crowds were smaller and less violent than recent weekends.\n\nRallies erupted in multiple neighbourhoods with some protesters blocking roads, spraying graffiti on pro-China businesses, smashing windows and erecting barricades.\n\nPolice made multiple arrests as they rushed to intercept activists but the clashes were less heavy than earlier this month when the city was virtually shut down by the most intense unrest of the four month protest movement.\n\nIn the district of Mongkok, riot police burst from an unmarked van that had screeched up to a blockade made of bamboo scaffolding poles and quickly chased down multiple protesters who were pinned to the ground and detained.\n\nProtestors held flashmob gatherings in shopping malls across Hong Kong\n\nIn Tai Po district, officers charged into a mall where protesters had tagged a number of businesses with slogans with at least two arrests made.\n\nSimilar flashmobs and brief clashes were witnessed in at least three other locations with bystanders often heckling police as they made arrests.\n\nHong Kong has been shaken by four months of massive democracy protests which have seen increasingly violent clashes between hardcore demonstrators and police, as well as regular transport disruptions.\n\nThe wave of protests in the international finance hub was sparked by opposition to a now-scrapped proposal to allow extraditions to mainland China, but has since morphed into a larger movement for democracy and police accountability.\n\nThe city enjoys unique rights under the terms of its handover to China by Britain in 1997, including freedom of expression and an independent judiciary, but many believe these are under threat from an increasingly assertive Beijing.\n\nStreet battles between riot police and small groups of protesters have become a weekly occurrence, hammering the already struggling economy, spooking tourists and undermining Hong Kong's reputation for stability.\n\nThe protests were sparked by a now-scrapped proposal to allow extraditions to mainland China but have morphed into a wider movement for democracy and police accountability\n\nThe beginning of October saw a particularly fierce period of unrest with protesters upping their violence as Communist China celebrated its 70th birthday party.\n\nClashes further intensified after the city's leader invoked colonial-era emergency laws to ban face masks at protests.\n\nOver the course of a week, protesters went on a vandalism spree, much of it targeting the city's subway network and pro-China businesses.\n\nPolice also increased their response, firing tear gas and rubber bullets with renewed ferocity. Two teenagers were wounded with live rounds during clashes with police.\n\nBut the last few days have seen a comparatively calmer period.\n\nProtesters are pushing for an independent inquiry into the police, an amnesty for the more than 2,500 people arrested and universal suffrage.\n\nBeijing and city leader Carrie Lam have repeatedly rejected those demands.", "description": "Hong Kong riot police spent much of Sunday afternoon skirmishing with small groups of masked pro-democracy protesters who held flashmob gatherings in...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/09/wire-19649178-1570954965-545_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
