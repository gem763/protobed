I didn't leave them for long at all, but it seems that as soon as my back was turned, someone took them all.\n\n\"I left and the stuff was just gone when I got back. It made me really unhappy.\n\n\"It\u2019s harder to get something warm to try and keep warm on an evening than it is to get food, so it's a real blow to lose my quilt especially, really.\n\n\"I\u2019m not looking forward to the winter but I just have to get by in the cold, I\u2019ve just got to do it.\n\n(Image: HullLive)\n\n\"Someone gave me that tent over there which was nice, but water has come through so I'm having to sleep in this sheltered area now.\"\n\nMr Hall has lived on and off the streets, spending time at the homes of family and friends who could put him up.\n\nHe claims he was forced out of his mum's home after she died earlier this year, and he refused help from professionals who prescribed medication.\n\nHe said: \"For about the last 11 weeks I've been living rough. I was staying at my mam's but sadly she died. It was horrible really. I came back home and walked in the house and found her face down blue just not moving or breathing.\n\n(Image: HullLive)\n\n\"I rang 999 but the paramedics couldn't save her. It was so sad and so frightening.\n\n\"Then I had to leave the house and cope with losing her as well as being homeless.\n\n\"I know there are hostels about, but I've had problems staying in them before and won't go in one again.\n\n\"There's always drugs about and I had a hedge trimmer for work at the last place I stayed at but they told me that it was a dangerous weapon and kicked me out when I refused to get rid of it.\"\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nHe added: \"After I lost my mum, the doctors noticed that I had problems with my mental health and got a psychiatrist out to see me and tried to prescribe me meds, but I wouldn't have them, as what they were giving me made me feel worse and not better.\n\n\"I will drink now and again but I'm not as bad as I used to be and I won't touch the drugs. I used to be drinking 12 cans a day but had to detox as it made me so ill that I couldn't go on like I was anymore.\n\n\"I speak to people when I see them but don't go out of my way to get my face about.\n\n\"Some people know me for the music I make and the words that I mix and tell me that I have a good voice, but I've never been able to get that far with it really.\n\n\"People try and be nice to me, doctors and even the staff here at Lidl will talk to me, as well as shoppers who give me food, but at the end of the day, they are going home to a nice warm house and I'm still stuck out here on the street.\"", "description": "Homeless Paul Hall, who claims he was forced onto the streets after his mum died, says his possessions, including his quilt and bike, have been stolen from his tent outside a Lidl in Hull", "authors": ["Anna Riley", "Image", "Hulllive"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20574532.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Grieving-homeless-man-living-in-tent-in-Lidl-car-park-after-finding-mum-deadPaul-Hall-tragically-lo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
