The long drive put the Panthers in the lead for good after an unexpectedly close battle with the Blue Hens.\n\n\u201cThat was not the Pitt football team I like to see,\u201d coach Pat Narduzzi said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we came out with the emotion that we could have. I thought we came out flat. Blame me for that.\u201d\n\nA pair of short fields after Pitt turnovers led to touchdowns for Delaware. After a Patti interception in the second quarter, Nolan Henderson passed 7 yards to Gene Coleman II to tie the game.\n\nWhen Maurice Ffrench fumbled in the third quarter to give Delaware another short field, Henderson hit Jourdan Townsend with a 5-yard score to give the Blue Hens a four-point lead.\n\n\u201cWe had a little momentum and we had the opportunity to extend our lead and we just were not able to do that,\u201d Delaware coach Danny Rocco said.\n\nThat\u2019s when Pitt responded with the long drive from Patti, who finished 23 of 37 for 271 yards, two touchdowns and an interception while making his first career start. He relied heavily on Mack, who had five catches for 124 yards.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a guy that takes the top off the defense and is a great playmaker,\u201d Patti said. \u201cBut we have more guys like that. It was just Taysir getting his number called, going out and executing.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Pickett, Pitt played without top running backs A.J. Davis and Vincent Davis and starting cornerback Jason Pinnock. Narduzzi said after the game that all of them were dealing with injuries but declined to reveal their statuses moving forward.\n\nTodd Sibley saw his most extensive action at running back, with 22 carries for 106 yards.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nDelaware: The Blue Hens had one shot against a Power Five team on their 2019 schedule, and they made an impact by taking Pitt to the wire. The question will be whether they can translate that showing at the FCS level where Delaware plays in a Colonial Athletic Conference that features six ranked teams, including the Blue Hens.\n\nPitt: Despite the win, the slog over the Blue Hens sapped any momentum the Panthers may have had coming off an upset over then-No. 15 UCF a week ago. The absence of Pickett is concerning for the Panthers\u2019 offense. He entered the week fifth in the FBS in completions per game.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nDelaware: Continues a two-game road swing by visiting Elon.\n\nPitt: Returns to ACC play with a trip to 3-1 Duke next Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Backup Nick Patti capped a fourth-quarter drive with a touchdown pass to help Pittsburgh survive a scare from Delaware, 17-14, on Saturday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Alan Saunders"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/28/delaware_pittsburgh_football_62887_c0-93-2600-1608_s1770x1032.jpg?8c945af33f66d3c81999ee516b77492447f565ca", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
