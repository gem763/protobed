Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nFour key defendants in a historic opioid lawsuit reached a landmark settlement Monday with state and local governments suing makers and distributors of the highly addictive painkillers.\n\nThe tentative settlement came hours before opening statements were set to be delivered in the Ohio case. The Wall Street Journal reported that terms of a deal involving McKesson Corp., Cardinal Health Inc., AmerisourceBergen Corp. and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. would be announced later in the day. The Associated Press, citing a lawyer involved in the case, confirmed that a deal had been struck.\n\nA fifth defendant, Walgreens Boots Alliance, had not yet reached a deal, making it unclear whether the trial would go on, the Journal reported.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Dan Polster has encouraged a settlement, which would provide affected communities the funds to combat opioid addiction much sooner than the lengthy process of going through a trial and the likely appeals afterward.\n\nMore than 115 people in the United States die every day from opioid overdoses, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.

However, Paul Hanly, a lead lawyer for local governments in the lawsuits, had called that mass settlement idea \u201cmost unlikely.\u201d\n\nThe Ohio trial would be the first federal trial related to an opioid crisis that has claimed an estimated 400,000 American lives over two decades. Cuyahoga and Summit counties in Ohio are suing drug manufacturer Teva Pharmaceuticals, four distributors and the drug store chain Walgreens claiming their practices contributed to the devastating opioid epidemic.\n\nDrugmakers have routinely denied wrongdoing, saying the drugs had survived intense Food and Drug Administration scrutiny and carry warning labels explaining the addictive risks of opioids.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/21/opioid-trial-settlement-report/4051076002/", "description": "An opioid settlement throws a historic trial into doubt.
