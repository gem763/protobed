Prager has called the film a \"wake-up call\" to the American people and claimed the left was trampling on free speech to satisfy its agendas.\n\n'NO SAFE SPACES' STAR ADAM CAROLLA SAYS CENSORSHIP 'HURTING EVERYONE,' NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE\n\nCarolla said the goal of his new documentary was simply to \u201cmake people aware of how nuts it is on campuses and in the media when it comes to censorship based on feelings\u201d rather than facts.\n\n\u201cIt's not a left or a right wing thing,\u201d Carolla told Fox News this past Wednesday. \u201cWe have people across the political spectrum in the film, including [liberal CNN pundit] Van Jones, who says it doesn't help his team to have young people who can't defend their beliefs. This is hurting everyone.\u201d\n\nSafe spaces, physical locations for students who feel victimized or offended, have become increasingly common on college campuses.\n\nIn addition to liberal universities, \u201cNo Safe Spaces\u201d also took on censorship in China. In one scene, Carolla said that in China, \u201cyou go to jail if you say anything nice about gay people.\u201d Another scene featured a cartoon character singing about the First Amendment while mocking China.\n\nThe documentary had \u201ca couple of risky scenes\u201d considering \u201cChina-owned AMC Entertainment is set to exhibit the film in several of its theaters early in the film\u2019s distribution pattern,\u201d The Hollywood Reporter noted.\n\nDENNIS PRAGER ON WHY NEW FILM 'NO SAFE SPACES' IS UNFAIRLY RATED\n\nCarolla said the filmmakers weren\u2019t scared of attacking the Communist nation despite possible financial backlash.\n\nIn \u201cNo Safe Spaces,\u201d Carolla and Prager traveled the country, talking to experts and advocates on both sides of the aisle, touring college campuses and examining their own upbringings to try understanding threats to free speech. The documentary featured commentary from a variety of Hollywood actors, scholars, academics, political figures and media members, including conservative political commentator Ben Shapiro, attorney Alan Dershowitz and actor Tim Allen.\n\n\"No Safe Spaces\" was released Oct. 25 and is set to expand this week in Phoenix ahead of engagements in San Diego and Denver.\n\nOn Nov. 8, limited engagements are scheduled for Tampa, Fla., Greenville and Spartanburg, S.C., followed by a wide distribution of the documentary the next week.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I'm really proud of this movie and hope the rest of the country will love it as much as we and our fans in Phoenix do,\" Carolla said reacting to the strong opening.\n\nFox News\u2019 Brian Flood and Jessica Napoli contributed to this report.", "description": "A film about free speech, \u201cNo Safe Spaces,\u201d starring comedian Adam Carolla and conservative radio personality Dennis Prager, had a strong opening with the second highest ever box office gross for a documentary on a single screen.", "authors": ["Talia Kaplan", "Talia Kaplan Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com.
