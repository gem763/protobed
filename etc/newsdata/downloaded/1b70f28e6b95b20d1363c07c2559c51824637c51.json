A man of many talents, Kristofferson was also a Rhodes scholar.\n\nMe and Kris Kristofferson ... Gerry Harvey tries out his guitar at Saddles restaurant. Kate Geraghty\n\n\u201cMy wife is only 58 and she knows a lot more about music than me, but when I told her I was off to see Kris Kristofferson, she said: \u2018Who\u2019s that?\u2019\u201d a bemused Blackmore told The Australian Financial Review.\n\n\u201cThese young ones \u2013 they don\u2019t know much,\u201d chimed in Cowin.\n\nKris Kristofferson and Barbra Streisand starred in the movie A Star Is Born in 1976.
