But on Thursday, the waters came again.\n\nFloodwater was 4 feet deep around Mr. Revia\u2019s house in Winnie, Texas, about 80 miles east of Houston, and his propane tank was leaking when firefighters rescued the single father and his four children Thursday morning.\n\nThe family lost furniture and beds in Harvey and has had problems with their floor. Now, after the arrival of Tropical Depression Imelda, which dumped more than 40 inches of rain in some areas of Texas over three days this week, Mr. Revia suspects he has lost his car and wonders what the new damage to the house will be.\n\n\u201cWe really haven\u2019t recovered from Harvey,\u201d Mr. Revia said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing [we were rescued], because we\u2019d be really stuck.\u201d\n\nIt was a somber familiarity many shared as Imelda\u2019s arrival brought flooding to parts of East Texas that residents thought they would see only once in a lifetime and left at least four people dead.\n\nImelda, which made landfall late Tuesday and dumped its heaviest rains Thursday, caught many by surprise.\n\nAfter inundating and stranding hundreds in the communities of Beaumont and Winnie, it made an unexpected swing west to Houston. As rescuers scrambled boats to retrieve hundreds in the Beaumont area, the communities were left largely cut off due to flooded roadways.\n\nMickey Galley, who carried his 3-week-old infant through waist-deep water to a rescue boat in Winnie, marveled at how fast the flood rose. They were among hundreds who hunkered down in a Red Cross shelter Thursday night, manned by many of the same volunteers who knew the ropes from Harvey.\n\nCars were abandoned across the area. Semitrailer trucks were swept off roadways by the strength of the floodwater.\n\nAmong the dead were a man electrocuted trying to rescue his horse and another who drowned in his car, both near Beaumont, as well as one who drowned in his van and a fourth man was found in a ditch near Houston, authorities said.\n\nThursday was the fifth-wettest day on record for Houston, according to the National Weather Service. If preliminary rainfall totals are confirmed, Imelda would be the seventh-wettest tropical cyclone in U.S. history.\n\nDeondria De Leon spent much of Thursday in a truck with her husband, Jose De Leon, driving down water-filled roadways to retrieve her mother from her home and their nephew, who was trapped at a Walmart.\n\nAlong the way, they saw water that reached the roof of trucks and fellow citizens rescuing each other in boats.\n\nMs. De Leon said flooding was worse than Harvey.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid of the climate change that I see on the news,\u201d she said. \u201cIt seems like it\u2019s getting worse every year.\u201d\n\nWrite to Elizabeth Findell at elizabeth.findell@wsj.com", "description": "For East Texas residents like James Revia still recovering from devastating Hurricane Harvey two years ago, tropical depression Imelda brought flooding they thought they would see only once in a lifetime.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Findell"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109304/social", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
