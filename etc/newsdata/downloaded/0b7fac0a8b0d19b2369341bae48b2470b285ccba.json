Rather than doing a traditional survey to compile their report, the researchers who wrote the report did lengthy interviews with 30 women who own businesses that have surpassed $5 million in revenue.\n\nMany of the owners said they were misunderstood and discounted by other business people including investors. The report found that women owners encountered mistaken assumptions about why they launched their companies.\n\n\u201cWhen a woman starts a business, some potential backers may assume that she is running the business out of her home, for fun, or just to supplement her family\u2019s income,\u201d the report said. \u201cBackers may then fail to see the business as growth-oriented and worthy of investment.\u201d\n\nTheir products or services can also be devalued, especially if the target customers are women or mothers. The report quoted Raegan Moya-Jones, co-founder of baby products manufacturer Aden & Anais, as saying, \u201cbusiness people didn\u2019t, and still don\u2019t, take me seriously a lot of the time.\u201d The negative judgments persisted although Aden & Anais products are sold in retailers including Walmart and Bloomingdale\u2019s and the company has annual revenue over $100 million.\n\nDarlene Panzitta, founder of DSP Clinical Research, said she encountered doubts because she was young as well as a woman.\n\n\u201cIt was a double whammy of, \u2018OK, she\u2019s female, plus she\u2019s young so she\u2019s not going to be aggressive,\u2019\u201d said Panzitta, whose company conducts research on women\u2019s health issues.\n\nOwners also encountered perceptions that they weren\u2019t running companies with an eye to expanding them and creating wealth, something that male owners were expected to do. Instead, they found they were being perceived as merely pursuing a project because they were passionate about the idea behind the business.\n\nThe negative attitudes have continued even as the growth rate for women owned companies has surpassed that of businesses in general. A report released last month by American Express found that the number of companies owned by women owned by women grew by 21.3% between 2014 and this year, compared to 9% growth for companies overall.", "description": "A report released last week by Babson College and Bank of America that analyzed the challenges women encountered as they were building their companies.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/Kim-Kardashian-GettyImages-1167365176.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
