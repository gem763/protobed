The Liberal Democrats, having languished in single figures for the best part of a decade, now vie on equal terms with the other parties in what appears to be a new kind of four-party politics. Chuka Umunna\u2019s decision to join the Lib Dems last week raises the prospect of others following. The two traditionally major parties are cracking and melting like the Arctic ice sheet.\n\nWhile the media inevitably focus on the uncertainty around who will lead the Conservative Party, there are three potentially more important imponderables of a structural rather than personal nature.\n\nThe first is whether a Brexit deal is deliverable under a new Tory leader. Merely to ask the question is to perpetuate a myth which dogged, and eventually destroyed Theresa May: that the British \u2013 through negotiating skill or threats \u2013 can change the terms of Brexit. The reality is that the 27 members of the EU are not going to offer the UK a better deal outside the EU than inside it, just because a new PM bangs the table, raises his voice and speaks slowly.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

The \u201cmax fac\u201d technological solution favoured by Boris Johnson has already been considered and rejected as unworkable.\n\nA possible, but not very plausible, route to delivering a deal is that Johnson pleads for some minor, synthetic changes to the \u201ccomfort letter\u201d from the EU which was previously declared to have no legal force. Then, having appointed a plausible minion as attorney general, the new PM would get him or her to endorse it, where a lawyer of integrity like Geoffrey Cox had refused.\n\nHowever, such cynical manoeuvring would still then require the DUP, wavering Tories and perhaps 20 to 30 Labour Leavers to suspend their critical faculties to \u201cget Brexit over the line\u201d. It could happen, but it is somewhat far-fetched.\n\nA second question is: if a new deal is not negotiable, or is rejected, is \u201cno deal\u201d then inevitable or, at least, likely? Notwithstanding the rejection of Oliver Letwin\u2019s procedural motion last week, I have never sensed that there is any willingness, except on the fanatical fringes, to allow no deal to happen by accident or design.\n\nParliament is overwhelmingly opposed and has a variety of options still available to stop it. A no-confidence motion leading to an election (which prominent Conservatives have said they will be supporting in extremis); the adoption of a Final Say referendum (which is winning some reluctant support even from the likes of Ken Clarke, if no deal is the alternative); or, as a last resort, revocation of Article 50.\n\nBrexit cannot be achieved without parliament passing a raft of legislation \u2013 on migration for example and a trade bill \u2013 all of which provide opportunities for the Commons to steer a new course. And the European Union has made it clear that Brexit could be delayed, again, if there were the prospect of an election or referendum.\n\nMy third question is whether Jeremy Corbyn could win an election. This question matters because the main factor inhibiting many Conservatives (and some Labour supporters) from precipitating a general election through a no-confidence vote is the fear that Corbyn could win.\n\nHis unexpectedly good performance in 2017 helps to keep this nightmare vivid. In practice, it is difficult to see Labour making headway under Corbyn, let alone winning. Scotland has abandoned Labour. Some north of England Leave seats will probably go Conservative or to the Brexit Party, and some heavily Remain, London and university seats held by Labour would probably fall to the Lib Dems.\n\nIt is possible that, with the Conservative vote splitting off to the Brexit Party, large numbers of Tory seats could switch to my party too. If that happened, the Lib Dems could then plausibly be a stronger force than either or both of the \u201cbig two\u201d.\n\nIt is just about possible to see a combination of chance factors helping Labour to edge the Conservatives for the largest number of seats in the Commons, but they would be well shy of a majority. Fear, then, of his enacting a ruinous socialist agenda is misplaced. A Corbyn socialist government is, in the current jargon, a \u201cunicorn\u201d. Corbyn\u2019s real thinking is that a hard Brexit followed by hard economic times might be the only thing which could make the unicorn real.\n\nWe may not get clarification on these issues until October and it promises to be a climactic month (but then, we said that about March and May). For those troubled by uncertainty, hold on tight, you are in for a rough ride.\n\nSir Vince Cable is the leader of the Liberal Democrats", "description": "The last few weeks have radically changed the face of British politics.
