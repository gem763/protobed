What they didn\u2019t have in mind, \u201cwas nine old people in Washington sitting in robes telling everybody else how to live.\u201d\u2026\n\n\u201cI say the country is owned by We The People. We wrote a Constitution, we put down what we wanted to put in it. We can amend it when we wish and it is not up to nine people to tell 330 million Americans how to live.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Cnn.Com Politics Neil-Gorsuch-Precedent-North-Korea-Washington-Nationals-Trump Index.Html"], "top_image": ""}
