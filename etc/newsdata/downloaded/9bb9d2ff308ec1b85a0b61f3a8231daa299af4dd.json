When Hazard does a one-two you can't get anywhere near him.\n\n\"When I was younger, people said to me you won't always be able to rely on speed. I used to just kick it past players and run - but nowadays that won't happen, especially when people bank up on me.\"\n\n(Image: SIPA USA/PA Images)\n\nJames has already impressed with his performances for the Red Devils, with the 21-year-old already drawing praise from club legends Gary Neville, Patrice Evra and his international boss Ryan Giggs.\n\nHe followed up his decent league form with a goal for Wales in the recent international break.\n\nGiggs said when James joined up with the squad last month: \"When you score, it gives you a lift. It doesn\u2019t matter who you are in the world or what kind of ability you have. Confidence is everything and it builds.\n\n(Image: Manchester United via Getty Imag)\n\n\"We all know what he\u2019s capable of, what he\u2019s done, especially over the last eight or nine months, he just keeps getting better and better.\"\n\nJames was started in the more unfamiliar position of centre-forward for United's recent draw with AZ Alkmaar, but is likely to return to the wing for the trip to Newcastle on Sunday.\n\nUnited are currently 11th in the table, but a win could see them leapfrog their way into sixth, with top four rivals Arsenal also in action against Bournemouth .\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nHazard meanwhile got his Madrid career up and running with his first goal for the club in their 4-2 win over Granada on Saturday.\n\nMadrid boss Zinedine Zidane said: \"We need to see Eden like this, playing well and scoring goals.\n\n\"He wanted that, he was happy in the dressing room. We hope it\u2019s the first of many for him.\"", "description": "The 21-year-old begun his Premier League career this season after the curtain had closed on Hazard's time in England", "authors": ["Darren Wells", "Image", "Getty Images", "Sipa Usa Pa Images", "Manchester United Via Getty Imag", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20515463.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_La-Liga-Santander-Real-Madrid-v-Granada.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
