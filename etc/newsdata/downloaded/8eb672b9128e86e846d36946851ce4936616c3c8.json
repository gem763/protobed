Wales need Davies back.\n\nHadleigh Parkes - 6\n\nLittle spark in the final third, but made 31 hard-earned metres.\n\nJosh Adams - 7.5\n\nDefended well when he was seriously challenged, and smashed Alldritt once with a huge hit.\n\nDan Biggar's kicking kept Wales in contention throughout the closely-fought match in Oita\n\nDan Biggar - 7\n\nKicked his goals - which proved vital \u2013 but attacking-wise Wales were average. Missed touch a few times with kicks too.\n\nGareth Davies - 6 (T Williams, 55)\n\nTried for a couple of trademark intercepts without success. Williams came on to inject more pace.\n\nWyn Jones - 6 (Carr\u00e9, 63)\n\nSeen as the best scrummaging prop in the squad, but Welsh could not smash set-piece.\n\nKen Owens - 7 (Dee, 76)\n\nNineteen tackles as he threw himself in the way of the French.\n\nTomas Francis - 6 (Lewis, 63)\n\nOne penalty conceded, and took a knock in the second half before going off.\n\nRoss Moriarty was sent to the sin bin but came back on to score the winning try for Wales\n\nJake Ball - 7 (Beard, 63)\n\nEleven carries, all for a metre each. Wales won all their lineouts when he was on, but did not dominate up front.\n\nAlun Wyn Jones - 7.5\n\nFelt like he and Owens were making every tackle when France battered into Wales in the second-half.\n\nAaron Wainwright - 8\n\nSearing pace for his try, and does so much well for such a young boy. Will be a dominant figure for years.\n\nJustin Tipuric - 7\n\nBreakdown was a total mess \u2013 not helped by referee Peyper's interpretations \u2013 but a few classy touches.\n\nJosh Navidi - 5 (Moriarty, 28 - 7)\n\nTaken off early injured, but had been left for dust by Vakatawa when the centre set up Ollivon's try.\n\nAaron Wainwright delivered a stunning performance which included Wales' first try\n\nFRANCE\n\nMedard 8 (Rattez, 78 6); Penaud 7, Vakatawa 8, Fickou 7, Huget 7; Ntamack 8 (Lopez, 41 6), Dupont 8 (Serin, 73 6); Poirot 7 (Baille, 68 6), Guirado 7 (Chat, 50 6), Slimani (Setiano, 73 6), Le Roux 7.5 (Picamoles, 66 5), Vahaamahina 0, Lauret 7, Ollivon 7.5, Alldritt 7 (Gabrillagues, 55 6).", "description": "WILL KELLEHER AT THE OITA STADIUM: Wales reached their first-semi final since 2011 with a tense 20-19 victory over France, thanks to tries from Aaron Wainwright and Ross Moriarty.", "authors": ["Will Kelleher For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/10/19951990-0-image-a-44_1571563885846.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
