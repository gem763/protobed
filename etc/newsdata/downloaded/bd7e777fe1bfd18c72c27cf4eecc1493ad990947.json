REUTERS/Piroschka van de Wouw\n\nThe six, aged 18 to 25, and their ailing father were found near Ruinerwold, a village in the northern province of Drenthe, local Mayor Roger de Groot said. They had apparently had no contact with the outside world for nine years.\n\nDe Groot said a 58-year-old man, not the father of the children, was arrested at the farm. His role was unclear.\n\n\u201cAs far as I know their mother died before they arrived there,\u201d he said. \u201cPolice found makeshift living quarters where the family was living in hiding.\u201d\n\nThe family, who according to local news reports had been waiting for the end of time, was discovered after one of the siblings escaped and sought help at a nearby cafe.\n\nAn employee at the cafe told RTV Drenthe one of the family members, a 25-year-old man, had come in looking scruffy and bewildered with long hair and said he had not been outside for nine years.\n\n\u201cYou could see he had no idea where he was or what he was doing,\u201d the cafe owner, Chris Westerbeek, told the broadcaster. \u201cHe said he had run away and that he urgently needed help.\u201d\n\nThe siblings and their father, who was reportedly bedridden after a stroke, were receiving treatment at an undisclosed location, the mayor said.\n\n\u201cI understand there are a lot of questions,\u201d de Groot said. We have many too. The police are investigating all possible scenarios.\u201d\n\nThe siblings had apparently lived in a hidden cellar and survived on vegetables and animals tended in a secluded garden, local TV RTV Drenthe reported.", "description": "Six young adults and their father were receiving medical treatment on Tuesday after Dutch police acting on a tip-off discovered them locked away in a secret room at an isolated farm, officials in the Netherlands said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441161283&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E1BV", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
