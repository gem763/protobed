There are only a few more sessions of recording JW\u2019s score in LA.\"\n\nOK, fine, so it's not a beat-by-beat summary of the movie, but there's still a lot to unpack and interpret here. Firstly, the fairly self-explanatory title of 'The Falcon's Last Ride' heavily implies that the beloved ship will finally meet its end in The Rise of Skywalker, but more importantly, it also suggests that the character piloting it will die. While most closely associated with Han Solo, the ship has been flown by Rey in the last two movies, but the teaser for the new movie showed that the Falcon's original owner, Lando Calrissian, is finally back in the pilot's seat. It's possible that Lando may meet his end shortly after being reunited with the Falcon. A sadder possibility is that Chewbacca, the longtime loyal copilot of the Falcon, will be the one who dies.\n\nThe leaker also mentions a callback to an earlier movie, saying that elements of 'Duel of the Fates', a track from The Phantom Menace, will be heard in the score. 'Duel of the Fates' is the striking music that plays over the prolonged fight scene between Darth Maul, Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi. That battle ended with a Jedi Master losing his life, and the recurring musical motif in The Rise of Skywalker might suggest another dramatic death for a main character.\n\nIt could also herald the return of fan favorite Darth Maul; while he appeared to die in The Phantom Menace, he has since been seen in animated shows The Clone Wars and Rebels, and briefly in Solo: A Star Wars Story. The return of one of the most recognizable villains in the series, who first appeared in Episode I, sure would be a hell of a way to wrap up Episode IX.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "Details from the movie's theme music might have just given away some major plot points.", "authors": ["Philip Ellis"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6jaCSmZoNNEvagUXWlL2dA--~B/aD01MTA7dz0xMDIxO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/hearst_mens_health_171/b75110ae18ff50c7fb9b1d9b55cd5df8", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
