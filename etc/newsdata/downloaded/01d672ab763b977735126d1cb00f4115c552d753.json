It is not right for them to have early access to subjects that are not appropriate for their ages.\"\n\nThe announcement by the mayor, who is affiliated with the evangelical megachurch Universal Church of the Kingdom of God and wrote in his 1999 book that homosexuality is a \" terrible evil,\" prompted an immediate reaction.\n\nThe day after he posted the tweet, the book had sold out.\n\nIn a September 6 tweet, Crivella defended his call for a ban, saying it \"had only one goal: to comply with the law and protect families. According to ECA (Brazil's Child and Adolescent Statute), the works should be sealed and identified as to their content. In this particular case, there was no warning on the subject matter.\"\n\nCrivella's tweet came after Rio councilman Alexandre Isquierdo posted about the book on Instagram, writing that it was an \"absurd crime\" that \"spreads homosexuality to CHILDREN!\"\n\nBook fair organizers responded by filing an injunction with Rio de Janeiro's Court of Justice that aimed to \"ensure the full operation of the event and the right of exhibitors to market literary works on the most diverse themes \u2014 as foreseen by the Brazilian legislation,\" according to a statement posted on Instagram.\n\nJudge Heleno Ribeiro Nunes of the Court of Justice granted the injunction and prevented the event's possible cancellation of its sales license. The book fair reportedly continued without issue until Sunday.\n\nBrazil's largest newspaper, the S\u00e3o Paulo-based Folha de S.Paulo, backed the decision to defend the book by printing a photo of a kiss between Young Avengers Wiccan and Hulkling on the cover of its Saturday edition.\n\nRead more:\n\nDorian toppled a huge construction crane and wrecked buildings in Canada despite it losing its hurricane status\n\nTwo years before the Harvey Weinstein story broke, his brother wrote him a letter saying his 'misbehavior' had 'brought shame' to the family\n\nThe Trump administration is downplaying the growing threat of white-supremacist terrorism.
