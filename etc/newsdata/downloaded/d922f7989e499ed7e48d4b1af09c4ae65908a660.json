At 1.59 per year, the European Union\u2019s current births are too low to sustain its survival. And while native birthrates have declined, Europe\u2019s overall population continues to grow due to mass immigration.\n\nFor the younger generation in Europe, employment is either non-existent or so poorly paid that it doesn\u2019t allow them the means to support themselves, let alone a prospective family. But Europe\u2019s declining birthrate is by no means just a result of work precariousness\u2014there\u2019s a much deeper cause.\n\nA 27-year-old conservative thought-leader in Italy and Europe, Francesco Giubilei, publisher of Future Nation magazine, says this crisis stems mainly from cultural and social factors. Today\u2019s youth is taught by its parents, of the anti-traditionalist \u201968er generation, that there is little intrinsic value in building a family. The consequence has been a generation that\u2019s planning its lives without any aspirations to have children. Additionally, European youth are moving from rural areas to large cities in search of study and job opportunities. This has contributed to them leading atomized lives detached from community. Today\u2019s youth feels that it doesn\u2019t belong anywhere, and so why should they leave anything behind for a future generation?\n\n\u201cThere is a total lack of perspective in my generation\u2019s way of approaching life. They don\u2019t see a future for themselves beyond the present moment,\u201d Giubilei said. \u201cFurthermore, there\u2019s the added factor of our provincial, rural areas disappearing into our cities. Our youth moves to study or to build work opportunities in a city, but the family isn\u2019t factored into this equation. Many of them end up living individualistic lives with no proper direction beyond their careers.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor politicians, the crisis of meaning among European youth isn\u2019t an issue worth addressing. They see declining birthrates as a natural result of post-industrialized economies, where people living comfortable lives do not feel the need to have children. And importing a new generation of young people from abroad seems like a convenient solution to an aging European population that isn\u2019t able to sustain itself.\n\nAs the German migration researcher Wolfgang Kaschuba, who works for the Berlin Institute for Empirical Integration and Migration Research, recently warned: \u201cIf Germans want to maintain their economic well-being, we need about half a million immigrants every year. We need to guarantee that our society stays young, because it\u2019s aging dramatically.\u201d\n\nAmong European politicians, only the populists have been challenging this issue. In doing so, they\u2019ve gained popularity among disaffected, working- and middle-class people.\n\nThese new leaders have no qualms about using the words \u201creplacement migration\u201d to describe how ruling elites prefer to address declining birthrates. Unlike in the United States, where such contentions are still controversial, European conservatives have brought them into the mainstream.\n\nThe leader of the Dutch conservative Forum for Democracy, Thierry Baudet, told The American Conservative: \u201cIt\u2019s not a conspiracy theory, it\u2019s a state of belief of European leaders.\u201d He noted that \u201cit\u2019s important that we don\u2019t replace the European population with foreigners.\u201d Similarly, a European member of Parliament for the anti-immigrant League party in Italy, Francesca Donato, told The American Conservative: \u201cWe are not in favor of the replacement of the Italian population with foreigners. We want to preserve our national identity, culture, and history.\u201d She clarified that while \u201cmulticulturalism is welcome, it shouldn\u2019t translate into complete replacement.\u201d\n\nThe leader of the Spanish Vox party, Santiago Abascal, argued that immigration is a political euphemism for the trafficking of cheap labor into Europe so that multinational companies and financial interests can increase their profits: \u201cThe establishment argues that our system must be maintained in the face of an aging population, but mass immigration renders work increasingly precarious.\u201d According to Abascal, the 2015 refugee crisis was used as a pretext to further the economic ambitions of Brussels bureaucrats at the expense of Europe\u2019s working population, especially its youth.\n\nBaudet also argues that establishment politicians push for immigration because they favor a globalized worldview under which national identities will disappear: \u201cThey genuinely believe we should move beyond religious and national identities to become global citizens.\u201d Baudet, however, thinks such policies would be disastrous, not only because they risk plunging Europe into \u201ctremendous conflict,\u201d but also because they risk creating a \u201cbrain drain\u201d from Africa and the Middle East.\n\nThe solution to this problem, many of these conservative leaders say, is to provide motivation and assistance to Europe\u2019s young people so they have their own children. Abascal uses Hungary as a model, where, under Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, families that have three or more children are given government grants to buy houses and no longer have to pay income tax. The state finances free nurseries, allowing women to re-enter the workforce without having to worry about childcare costs. In addition, Hungary has inscribed Christianity in its constitution to create a strong religious identity, providing its youth with a sense of direction and meaning.\n\nThe problem of low birthrates ultimately lies internally, within Europe\u2019s culture and social life. A young generation that doesn\u2019t aspire to have families and that\u2019s increasingly alienated from any sense of community has driven much of the crisis. Whether Europe can be salvaged and revived is yet to be seen.\n\nAlessandra Bocchi is a freelance journalist focusing on foreign policy in North Africa, Europe, and the U.S. She has been covering the protests in Hong Kong.
