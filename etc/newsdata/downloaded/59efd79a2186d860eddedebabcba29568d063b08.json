But she was always a trooper.\n\n(Image: MEN Media)\n\n\u201cWe grew used to the operations, but it never made that horrible feeling in the anaesthetic room any easier.\n\n\u201cBut I definitely couldn\u2019t fault the staff \u2013 they were all fantastic.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cI was in and out of the Starlight Unit to the point where I knew everyone\u2019s name and they knew me.\n\n\u201cWhen dad recently hosted the NHS awards in Manchester, just how much the staff do for patients really hit home.\n\n(Image: MEN Media)\n\n\u201cThe condition I had is nothing compared to the severe cases they face each day. I have so much admiration for the work and miracles they have performed on so many children.\n\n\u201cSo I joined Glow as a thank you to them all. It was also Royal Manchester Children\u2019s Hospital\u2019s 10th birthday this year, so I thought it might as well be this year.\u201d\n\nOlivia no longer needs operations, and has not visited the hospital regularly since she was 14.\n\nLater this month, she will take part in Glow in the Park, a 5k night time run in Heaton Park in aid of the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital Charity, to thank the people who saved her life.\n\n*Glow takes place on Saturday, October 26 in Heaton Park\n\n\n\n", "description": "The actor from Cold Feet and A Confession says his daughter would not be here today if it weren't for the quick-thinking NHS staff", "authors": ["Verity Sulway", "Image", "Men Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20555127.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_JS195572226.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
