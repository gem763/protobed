(Monica Almeida/Reuters)\n\nGenerational pride is the cheapest form of identity politics.\n\nI\u2019ve changed my mind (a little) about how we discuss generations.\n\nFirst, let me illustrate my longstanding gripe.\n\n\u201cI am probably the biggest fan of the Millennials you\u2019ll ever meet,\u201d retired navy admiral William H. McRaven, who oversaw the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, said in a recent CBS interview. \u201c[Critics] talk about Millennials being soft and pampered and entitled? Well, I\u2019m quick to say that you\u2019ve never seen them in a firefight in Afghanistan. . . .This is a fabulous generation, and anybody that worries about the future of the United States, I don\u2019t think you need to worry.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can\u2019t stand that kind of talk.\n\nImagine that I said, \u201cI am probably the biggest critic of Millennials you\u2019ll ever meet. Fans talk about Millennials being brave and courageous. Well, I\u2019m quick to say that you\u2019ve never seen them mooching beer money in a 7-Eleven parking lot.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis might instantly strike you as unfair \u2014 and it is! That\u2019s the point.\n\nThere are some 83 million Millennials, defined as Americans born between 1981 and 1996. It\u2019s difficult to generalize about a group of people this large. Within the ranks of Millennials there are pro-life Mormons and pro-choice atheists. There are immigrants and descendants of the Mayflower settlers. Some obsess over the best way to make avocado toast, and some obsess over the best way to clean an M1 rifle.\n\nI would leap at the opportunity to buy beer for the Millennials who raided bin Laden\u2019s compound. But some random guy who was playing video games when bin Laden was taken out? He can buy his own beer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn other words, characteristics can be generalized, but character is formed by individual deeds. There is no transitive property to glory or blame. A hero in one generation isn\u2019t less heroic because of the misdeeds of someone else his age. Generational pride is the cheapest form of identity politics.\n\nOn the other hand, it\u2019s true that you can make some useful generalizations about various generations. There are roughly as many Millennials in America as there are Germans in Germany. And while painting \u201cthe Germans\u201d with too broad a brush can have its pitfalls, there are still some things you can say about Germans that you can\u2019t say about Swedes or Costa Ricans. So it is with any generation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoseph Sternberg, an editorial writer for the Wall Street Journal, has a new book, The Theft of a Decade: How the Baby Boomers Stole the Millennials\u2019 Economic Future. He casts a thoughtful, nuanced, and important light on the plight of Millennials. Crucially, Sternberg does it from a center-right, pro-market perspective rather than from the more familiar, center-left view that often gets mired in larger identity-politics formulations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMillennials entered the workforce in large numbers around the time of the financial crisis of 2007\u201308 and the deep recession that followed it. That, along with policies in areas such as housing and education pushed by allegedly self-interested Baby Boomers, had dire consequences for a large swath of young people. Entering the labor market during a severe downturn puts a drag on lifetime earnings. Saddling yourself with college loan debt can too.\n\nSternberg\u2019s argument that Millennials \u2014 whether they fought in Afghanistan or not \u2014 have legitimate complaints about how the system is failing them strikes me as a valuable and worthwhile form of generational stereotyping. It\u2019s rooted in empirical facts and figures.\n\nBut Sternberg\u2019s attempt to blame the Boomers for the Millennials\u2019 travails strikes me as the wrong kind of generational stereotyping. And I say that as a Gen Xer for whom bashing Baby Boomers is a birthright.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have no doubt that some of the policy missteps Sternberg lays at the feet of the Boomers can be attributed to certain generational attitudes. (They were the damn hippies, after all.) But many of those attitudes were inherited from the \u201cGreatest Generation\u201d or earlier.\n\nMore to the point, the policies the Boomers implemented were hotly debated among Boomers themselves, and virtually none of them expressly argued from a desire to self-deal for their own generation at the expense of others. Just as there are Millennial socialists and Millennial anarcho-capitalists, there are Boomers in those categories as well. If we\u2019re going to assign blame \u2014 and why not? \u2014 it\u2019s more helpful to put it on those who were wrong rather than indicting an entire generation of some 75 million people.\n\nIf it\u2019s wrong to demonize Millennials, it\u2019s probably wrong to demonize the Boomers, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u00a9 2019 Tribune Content Agency, LLC", "description": "To generalize about generations is to ignore the character formation of individuals.", "authors": ["Jonah Goldberg", "Andrew C.
