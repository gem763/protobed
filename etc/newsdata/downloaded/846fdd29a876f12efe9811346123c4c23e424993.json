I have an idea", "language": "en", "text": "Former chancellor Ken Clarke was the only Conservative MP to vote against the Bill in Wednesday's Commons session: PA\n\nKenneth Clarke could be the prime minister who asks the EU for a Brexit extension. If Boris Johnson means what he says, he is not going to reach agreement with the EU on the terms of our exit, because he insists on a customs border in Ireland, which it says is unacceptable; and, he says, there will be \u201cno delay\u201d.\n\nThat was what he said after he had submitted a document to the Scottish courts confirming that he would obey the law and request an extension if there is no deal. The document says: \u201cThe prime minister accepts ... that [if parliament has not approved a withdrawal agreement] \u2026 he will send a letter in the form set out in the schedule by no later than 19 October 2019.\u201d\n\nThe only way the two statements could be compatible is if his submission to the court were written in the third person, and it refers to \u201cthe prime minister\u201d who may not be him \u2013 although it would appear to be a \u201che\u201d.\n\nRead more\n\nDoes Boris Johnson have the votes in parliament for a deal?\n\nSo it could mean that whoever is prime minister on 19 October will send the letter, and that that person could be Clarke. If Johnson keeps his word, he has to resign as prime minister if he cannot get a deal through parliament, and in that situation, I think Clarke would emerge as the successor \u201cmost likely to command the confidence of the House of Commons\u201d, in the words of the Cabinet Manual.\n\nIt couldn\u2019t be Jeremy Corbyn, as Jo Swinson rightly pointed out in an attempt to deflect attention from her own refusal to support the Labour leader. She said the 21 ex-Conservative MPs wouldn\u2019t support him; and nor would several former \u2013 and even current \u2013 members of his own party.\n\nIf Clarke were to lead a government of national unity \u2013 even temporarily, just to send a letter and organise an election \u2013 he would need a cabinet of national unity, and ministers of national unity, and possibly parliamentary private secretaries of national unity. Even Ed Vaizey, who Johnson forgot to sack despite expelling him from the parliamentary Tory party, could carry on as trade envoy to southeast Asia.\n\nSo who would be in the temporary cabinet, running the temporary government for the five or six weeks of the election campaign? I was surprised by how easy it is to construct a credible line-up, consisting solely of ex-Conservative independent MPs, Labour backbenchers and minor parties. Here we go.\n\nDeputy prime minister: Harriet Harman. As the longest-serving female MP, she is the obvious complement to Clarke, but she is not as well suited to the role of caretaker prime minister herself because that post should be taken by an independent MP.\n\nChancellor: Philip Hammond. Well, he knows where the Treasury is. Foreign secretary: Hilary Benn. Author of the act requiring an extension rather than a no-deal Brexit, he was sacked as shadow foreign secretary by Corbyn for supporting airstrikes against Isis in Syria.\n\nHome secretary: Yvette Cooper. Another leader of backbench legislation against a no-deal exit, she was also Theresa May\u2019s shadow for five years. Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster: Jo Swinson. Give her a seat at the cabinet table without departmental responsibilities so that she can focus on the election campaign.\n\nJustice secretary: Dominic Grieve (he\u2019s a lawyer). Defence secretary: Amber Rudd (cool head if there is a crisis). Health secretary: Anna Soubry (leader of the Independent Group for Change; she was a rather good junior health minister under David Cameron). Business secretary: Ed Davey (deputy leader of the Lib Dems, who had the energy and climate change part of the brief in the coalition). Digital, Culture, Media and Sport: Chuka Umunna (a third Lib Dem).\n\nStory continues", "description": "Kenneth Clarke could be the prime minister who asks the EU for a Brexit extension.
