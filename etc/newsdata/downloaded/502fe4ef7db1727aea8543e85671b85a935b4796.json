(MCK) said it swung to a loss for its second quarter, but revenue rose about 9% from a year earlier, beating Wall Street estimates.\n\nThe Irving, Texas-based pharmaceutical supplier reported a loss of $730 million, or $3.99 a share, compared with a profit of $499 million, or $2.51 a share, a year ago.\n\nThe company said its results included roughly $1.4 billion in charges related to an impairment related to the company's exit of its investment in Change Healthcare.\n\nExcluding one-time items, adjusted earnings were $3.60. Analysts polled by FactSet were expecting earnings of $3.03 a share, or $3.60 a share on an adjusted basis.\n\nRevenue rose to $57.62 billion from $53.08 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected $55.08 billion of revenue in the quarter. The company said its results were driven by growth in its U.S. pharmaceutical and specialty solutions unit, due to branded pharmaceutical price increases and higher volumes from a retail national account customer.\n\nWrite to Patrick Thomas at patrick.thomas@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 30, 2019 07:32 ET (11:32 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
