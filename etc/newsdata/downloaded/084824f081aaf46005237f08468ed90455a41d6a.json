Chief among them is making the traveling experience delightful again.\n\n\"Here in Silicon Valley, the word disruption is a good thing,\" she said. \"But if you're a traveler, disruption is not a good thing.\"\n\nIn the same way that small delays can cascade through an airlines' schedule and wreak havoc on hundreds of flights and thousands of passengers' itineraries, so too can small efficiencies \u2014 even mere minutes \u2014 help the entire airline stay on time.\n\nOne example of a JetBlue investment that's paying off is Lumo, Simi said, which is helping the company build better schedules with insights humans could never find on their own.\n\n\"They're an AI company out of MIT,\" she said. \"And they pull in all of the data from air-traffic control, and weather, actual flights, and they help us build better schedules. If we move a departure by three minutes, that might actually save a delay of three hours because of some ground-delay program that always happens at a certain time at a certain airport.\"\n\n\"While that's easy to do as you're managing a fleet of only 50 airplanes, but as you've got 200, 300, 400 aircraft, thousands of flights a day, humans can't do that,\" she added.\n\nLaunched in 2016, JetBlue Technology ventures has made more than 20 investments, a representative said. The company has not disclosed average funding amounts.\n\nRead more: The president of JetBlue's venture capital firm is a renaissance woman who just might transform air travel\n\nBut it hasn't all been without controversy. While pioneering facial recognition for international flights at JetBlue's New York hub, the airline faced some backlash amid privacy concerns. That's not slowing down JetBlue's customer-side investments, which can speed up boarding.\n\n\"The reality is if you're traveling internationally, you've got a passport,\" Simi said. \"The government already has your picture. If you fly internationally on JetBlue, you can go straight through the boarding process without even pulling out your ticket.\n\n\"Of course, you can opt out. But if you choose, your picture bounces right off the government database. We don't hold the data whatsoever. Then you board the flight without pulling out your ticket or any additional identification.\"\n\nWeather remains an airline foe\n\nWeather, of course, is the crux of most airline delays, and the issue is right in Simi's focus with another investment, in a company called ClimaCell.\n\nThe so-called microweather company \"takes the signals from cell towers and cars and can sense the weather right now on a street level,\" Simi said. \"Whatever the weather is on Embarcadero and Market versus down at San Francisco Airport is going to be very different. But if you open up your weather app, it's just going to say San Francisco.\"\n\nThat granularity can be crucial.\n\n\"That allows us to run better ramp operations,\" Simi said. \"When is the lightning going to come? When do we need to roll the deicing trucks? When we have much more precise weather, it makes a much more seamless journey for you.\"\n\nThere's one area that even JetBlue is struggling to break into\n\nPlanes have landed somewhat autonomously for decades with a function known as autoland.\n\n\"I landed a 777 at SFO in zero visibility 20 years ago,\" Simi said. But those systems are limited to certain airports and specific aircraft. Expanding that, she said, could be a game changer.\n\n\"There is a company we haven't invested in, but I keep trying to invest,\" she said. \"They're stealth so I can't say exactly what they are, but if we think about all of these robotics, it's only at specific airports. If you could do those autolands at any airport, because of a self-contained piece of technology, that completely reduces the disruptions that you have for weather.\"\n\n\"There is a startup that's doing that here in the Bay Area,\" Simi said. \"We see that positively impacting the industry ahead. I hope they're watching because I want to invest in them.\"", "description": "Bonny Simi, a former Olympian and pilot, says there's one area even JetBlue is struggling to make inroads with but hoping to invest in soon.", "authors": ["Graham Rapier"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5daf5e17cc4a0a53a113bcbc?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
