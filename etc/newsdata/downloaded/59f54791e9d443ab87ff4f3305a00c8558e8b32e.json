The feeling within was that Chevrolet had massively overpaid and it was never going to get done again.\"\n\nIt has left United with a commercial headache, with Old Trafford chiefs already beginning their search for a new shirt sponsor from the 2021/22 season onwards.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nDespite their woes in the pitch, United bosses believe that the club's iconic red shirt still remains attractive to potential sponsors.\n\nA United spokesperson said: \"Chevrolet is a fantastic partner.\n\n\"The sponsorship continues to achieve the brand and business objectives for both parties and we will continue to work to activate and maximise it.\"", "description": "United have made their worst start to a Premier League campaign in 30 years and are just two points above the relegation zone", "authors": ["Matt Maltby", "Image", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20557787.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Premier-League-Manchester-United-v-Arsenal.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
