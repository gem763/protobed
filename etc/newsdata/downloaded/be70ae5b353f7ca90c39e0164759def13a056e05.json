Read more\n\nSacoolas left the UK along with her husband Jonathan at the beginning of last month, days after Harry Dunn was killed in a head-on collision with a car that police believe had been driving on the wrong side of the road for 400 yards.\n\nIn a sign that the US will resist appeals for the return of Sacoolas, the US embassy said the family left the UK on the advice of senior state department officials, adding that diplomatic immunity is rarely waived in such instances.\n\nSuch cases receive \u201cintense attention at senior levels and are considered carefully given the global impact such decisions carry\u201d, the US Department of State said.\n\nThe US embassy has expressed its profound sadness at the death, but has refused to comment on how London and Washington interacted when the US first ruled that the Sacoolas family were entitled to claim diplomatic immunity to leave the UK, and so stymie further UK police inquiries.\n\nThe Foreign Office, probably sensing the grounds for protest were limited by international law, made no public objection to Sacoolas\u2019s departure and onlybegan to make its concerns public when the family of Dunn demanded answers in the media.\n\nThe episode raises fresh questions about whether diplomatic immunity is routinely abused to provide improper blanket protection for diplomats and their families, so they can evade justice in cases where they have committed illegal acts that have no connection with their professional life.\n\nChris Daw QC, a barrister, said: \u201cIf the US government allows diplomatic immunity (for a spouse, not even a diplomat) to frustrate a serious British criminal investigation, they are no better than the Russians over Salisbury.\u201d\n\nDunn died after a collision with a Volvo XC90 near RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire on 27 August. It is alleged the Volvo driver went 400 yards down the wrong side of the road after pulling out of the airbase. The Sacoolas family had only been in the UK for three weeks.\n\nDunn sustained multiple injuries and was taken to John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford, where he died a short time later.\n\nPolice said the suspect \u201cengaged fully\u201d with them at the time and confirmed \u201cthat she had no plans to leave the country in the near future\u201d.\n\nNorthamptonshire police disclosed only on Saturday that Sacoolas had left the UK despite previously telling officers she intended to remain in the UK. Death by careless driving can lead to a custodial offence.\n\nThe Croughton airbase acts as a joint intelligence analysis centre. In early 1994 the US and UK governments struck a deal that all those working in RAF Croughton including their families would have diplomatic protection. That deal probably gave Sacoolas the cover to claim immunity.\n\nPressed on the controversy on Monday, Johnson said: \u201cI do not think it can be right to use the process of diplomatic immunity for this type of purpose.\u201d\n\nPlay Video 0:58 Harry Dunn's parents call for diplomat's wife to face justice over son's death \u2013 video\n\nSpeaking to reporters during a visit to a hospital in Watford, he added: \u201cI think everybody\u2019s sympathies are very much with the family of Harry Dunn and our condolences to them for their tragic loss.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister added that he hoped Sacoolas would come back and \u201cengage properly with the processes of law as they are carried out in this country.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a point that we\u2019ve raised or are raising today with the American ambassador here in the UK and I hope it will be resolved very shortly.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said discussions about the case had already been held between Raab and the US ambassador, Woody Johnson, and the details were \u201cextremely concerning\u201d.\n\nDunn\u2019s parents said they were prepared to travel to Washington to meet Donald Trump about waiving Sacoolas\u2019s diplomatic immunity.\n\nDunn\u2019s mother, Charlotte Charles, said if the diplomatic waiver was declined then funds raised by friends and family would be used to travel to try to see the president. Charles said it was a \u201cdishonourable thing to do\u201d for Sacoolas to leave the UK while she remained a suspect.\n\nShe told CBS: \u201cShe killed our boy. If it wasn\u2019t for her being under this suppose diplomatic immunity, it would have been a clear cut case we\u2019d have had justice by now.\u201d\n\nAndrea Leadsom, the business secretary and the MP for South Northamptonshire, tweeted in response to Charles\u2019s comments : \u201cI met Harry\u2019s family yesterday. They are totally heartbroken. We have to get proper justice for Harry and closure for his family.\u201d\n\nNick Adderley, the chief constable of Northamptonshire police, said US authorities had been appealed to in \u201cthe strongest terms\u201d to apply a waiver and \u201callow the justice process to take place\u201d.\n\nAdderley confirmed he and Stephen Mold, the police, fire and crime commissioner for Northamptonshire, had contacted the embassy asking for immunity to be waived.\n\nDunn\u2019s father, Tim Dunn, said the family wanted to get to the truth in order to move forward. He added: \u201cWe can\u2019t grieve for him at the minute, we are unaware where we are going.\u201d\n\nCharles said they learned that Sacoolas had left the UK after their son\u2019s funeral.\n\nShe said her son \u201cwas part of the gel that put us together. Now we are just broken inside and out. Everything hurts every day. We know we can\u2019t bring him back but we need to do so\u201d.", "description": "PM to appeal to Donald Trump if Anne Sacoolas fails to return to UK over fatal traffic collision", "authors": ["Patrick Wintour"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb33a0935f8224fb4a2c53dff7842e01307b24f0/0_1199_2169_1300/master/2169.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b0e8979bf04f4c89758e543cab1f693c", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
