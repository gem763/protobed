Smith memorial dinner Thursday night, capitalizing on the annual opportunity to banter about politics at the white-tie charity affair.\n\nIn the wake of President Donald Trump\u2019s remarks during an explosive meeting Wednesday with congressional leaders about the situation in Syria, in which Trump dubbed Mattis \u201cthe world\u2019s most overrated general,\u201d Mattis claimed the title with pride.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not just an overrated general, I am the greatest, the world\u2019s most, overrated,\u201d Mattis quipped.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m honored to be considered that by Donald Trump, because he also called Meryl Streep an overrated actress. So I guess I\u2019m the Meryl Streep of generals. And frankly, that sounds pretty good to me.\u201d\n\nMattis continued to unleash the one-liners throughout his speech, roasting the president again later, saying: \u201cI earned my spurs on the battlefield; Donald Trump earned his spurs from the doctor\u201d \u2015 in a brazen reference to Trump\u2019s deferral from service in the Vietnam War due to a medical disqualification for \u201cbone spurs\u201d in his feet.\n\n\"I\u2019m not just an overrated general. I\u2019m the most overrated general,\" Mattis says. \"I'm honored to be considered that by Donald Trump because he also called Meryl Streep an overrated actress.

He wasn\u2019t tough enough,\u201d Trump said, according to the aides. \u201cI captured ISIS. Mattis said it would take two years. I captured them in one month.\u201d\n\nMattis, a retired Marine Corps general, was Trump\u2019s first defense secretary. He resigned in 2018 because, he said, his views on policy did not align with those of the president.\n\nTrump called Oscar winner Streep one of the \u201cmost over-rated actresses in Hollywood\u201d in 2017 after she criticized him during her speech after winning an award at the Golden Globes.\n\n\u201cYou do have to admit that, between me and Meryl, at least we\u2019ve had some victories,\u201d Mattis quipped Thursday.", "description": "The former defense secretary unleashed a hilarious roast on the president at the annual Alfred Smith memorial dinner.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da91e8e2100001715ad3245.jpeg?cache=tfxozdx120&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
