CNN reports several of Epstein\u2019s lieutenants were facing charges in Florida a decade ago but that all evaporated when Epstein signed a sweetheart deal with the US Attorney. The question the story raises is whether or not these women should be prosecuted now, even though Epstein is dead. There\u2019s little doubt these women participated in illegal activity but there\u2019s also a good chance they became Epstein\u2019s victims before they were abusers themselves.\n\nAccording to police reports, civil lawsuits and other court filings, these women approached girls in various places including near their schools, offering them the opportunity to make money by giving what they described as massages to an older man. They arranged transportation to Epstein\u2019s residences for girls who were too young to drive themselves. And they handed cash payments to the girls after their encounters with Epstein. And for some of them, court papers and other filings indicate, their work for him may have been a product of his abuse. The starkest example appears to be Nadia Marcinkova, an Epstein assistant who is accused in civil lawsuits of having perpetrated abuse alongside Epstein, aiding him to \u201csatisfy his criminal sexual desires by, on occasion, directly participating in sexual abuse and prostitution of the minor girls,\u201d according to one of the lawsuits\u2026 In a report filed by the Palm Beach Police Department during an earlier investigation of Epstein, multiple victims said Marcinkova played a role in their abuse. One victim said she was repeatedly paid to have sex with Marcinkova, while Epstein watched and masturbated. Another victim said she, too, was instructed to \u201ckiss and fondle\u201d Marcinkova as the two of them provided a massage to Epstein\u2026 In the police report, one victim who alleged she was forced to have sex with Marcinkova told police Epstein bragged that he had \u201cpurchased\u201d Marcinkova and brought her to the US to be his \u201cYugoslavian sex slave.\u201d\n\nMarcinkova\u2019s attorney told CNN, \u201cLike other victims, Nadia Marcinko is and has been severely traumatized.\u201d Given Epstein\u2019s track record, that\u2019s very likely true. She was probably 15 when she came to the United States and perhaps 16 when she engaged in sex with others at Epstein\u2019s behest. And yet, she met regularly with Epstein after his conviction:\n\nJeffrey Epstein was approved for visits with one of his underage rape victims while serving time for soliciting minors in Palm Beach. Documents obtained by DailyMail.com show that the Palm Beach County\u2019s Sheriff\u2019s Office recorded approximately 90 visits between Epstein and Nadia Marcinkova in their official prison log.\n\nSo what does justice look like here? My own thought is that Marcinkova probably deserves to be prosecuted for luring underage girls to Epstein knowing what he planned to do. That said, had she been prosecuted at the time of the incidents she would have been as a minor and her own abuse would have been taken into account in any sentence. She probably wouldn\u2019t have served much time.\n\nI\u2019d like to see prosecutors go after Ghislaine Maxwell. She was reportedly Epstein\u2019s right-hand woman and she was an adult. Prosecuting her for her involvement doesn\u2019t seem like much of a grey area.", "description": "\"Epstein bragged that he had 'purchased' Marcinkova and brought her to the US to be his 'Yugoslavian sex slave.'\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Epstein-Maxwell.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
