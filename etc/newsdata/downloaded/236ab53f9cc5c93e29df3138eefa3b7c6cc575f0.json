Weak economic growth, high unemployment and substantial slack in the economy suggest inflation will remain below target this year and next, analysts say, requiring more easing.\n\nCopom reiterated that the government must press on with economic reforms to help keep inflation expectations anchored. But it removed a reference in recent statements that the upside threat to inflation if these reforms stalled was the \"dominant\" risk.\n\nThe central banks of almost every major developed and emerging market economy, from the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank to Brazil's Copom and the South African Reserve Bank, are easing policy to boost flagging growth.", "description": "Brazil cuts rates to record low, sees room for more", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/Brazil-Stock-Market_3_800x533_L_1414427437.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
