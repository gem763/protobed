Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), a leading candidate for the party\u2019s 2020 presidential nomination, is a huge fan of government \u201cplans.\u201d\n\nAccording to her website: \u201cElizabeth has a lot of plans, but they\u2019re really one simple plan: We need to tackle the corruption in Washington that makes our government work for the wealthy and well-connected, but kicks dirt on everyone else, and put economic and political power back in the hands of the people.\u201d\n\nTo date, Warren has authored more than 50 so-called plans, covering a wide array of issues, that she claims will magically solve all of the \u201cproblems\u201d plaguing America. According to Warren, if she becomes president (highly unlikely at this point), she will implement her plans, even if it requires trampling upon the Constitution.\n\nFor example, in her recently released \u201cSecuring LGBTQ+ Rights And Equality\u201d plan, she states, \u201cif Senate Republicans put small-minded partisanship ahead of protecting these rights, I will end the filibuster so that we have a path to getting critical legislation like the Equality Act passed.\u201d\n\nApparently, if she somehow, miraculously attains the keys to the Oval Office, Warren would simply issue edicts from the White House. Her disdain of America\u2019s founding principles\u2014including federalism, limited government, separation of powers, and checks and balances\u2014could not be more appallingly apparent. Sorry, but that is not how things work in the United States.\n\nPutting aside all the debate over the veracity of Warren\u2019s plans, there is one indisputable truth (a foreign concept to Warren) about her plans: If enacted, the central government will become more powerful than ever before.\n\nUsing simple pattern recognition, a prevalent theme in every single one of Warren\u2019s 53 plans (so far) is that bureaucrats in Washington, DC should micromanage almost everything. Despite her false promise to \u201cput economic and political power back in the hands of the people,\u201d Warren will really supercharge the central government\u2019s size and scope.\n\nOf course, this will increase corruption, and all other types of government malfeasance. As Lord Acton once said, \u201cpower tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\u201d\n\nAccording to Warren, we need all-encompassing government because, \u201cThere is nobody in this country who got rich on his own. Nobody.\u201d I beg to differ\u2014but what Warren fails to realize is that giant government plans almost always exacerbate problems and create all sorts of unintended consequences.\n\nHistory is littered with government plans that have turned out to be utter disasters. For example, the Soviet Union issued a series of so-called five-year plans that led to mass famine and economic devastation. Massive government plans in China, Cuba, Venezuela, and many other countries have also resulted in abject horror and wanton destruction.\n\nIs Warren ignorant of the sordid history of central planning? Or does she, like most progressives (i.e. those in favor of expanding government power), believe those plans failed because they were not detailed enough? Or perhaps the bureaucrats enforcing those plans didn\u2019t have enough power?\n\nRegardless, Warren is running on the platform that Americans are incapable of making their own decisions or solving their own problems. She wants to increase government power to solve a whole host of economic and social problems\u2014whether or not they are as dire as Warren claims. She also has little faith in the private sector, because most American companies are run by criminal greed heads who prey upon their workers and bilk consumers. Or so she says.\n\nThese tired old talking points are a farce.\n\nIn America (and several other nations), the family, religious institutions, private charities, and even private businesses have been more than willing and able to address the problems that Warren thinks only government can solve. As usual, Warren is out of touch with the views of hard-working, patriotic citizens.\n\nMaybe Sen. Warren should leave the Beltway Bubble and trek across America\u2019s heartland\u2014instead of flying over it on a private jet while lecturing all of us about climate change.\n\nIf she accomplishes this monumental feat, she might finally realize that Americans, without the aid of overwhelming government plans, have gotten along just fine for a few hundred years, thank you very much.", "description": "Like most socialists, Sen.
