A persistent flow off the ocean made for an ideal cloud-making environment across the region today. Unfortunately, that cloud cover will only thicken overnight and Sunday, with a better chance of some scattered showers developing by tomorrow afternoon.\n\nListen to our daily D.C. forecasts: Apple Podcasts | Amazon Echo | More options\n\nThrough tonight: Winds from the southeast at around 5 to 10 mph keep the cloud cover locked into place for the evening and overnight hours. Temperatures will be warmer than last night, with lows generally in the mid- to upper 50s.\n\nView the current weather at The Washington Post.\n\nTomorrow (Sunday): Mostly cloudy again on Sunday, with some scattered afternoon showers likely. Winds from the south will keep things mild, with highs topping out in the low to mid-70s. Humidity values will be elevated as well, so it may feel a bit sticky at times. Scattered showers and mild tomorrow night with lows in the low to mid 60s.\n\nSee Ian Livingston\u2019s forecast through next week.
