Chopped mint and added to anti bacterial cleaner and filled with water. Sprayed under window sill outside and around the door.'\n\nAnd members of the group were delighted with the advice given on how to get rid of the eight-legged insects.\n\n'Thanks for that tip...have just put bowls of fresh conkers all round my house,' wrote one, while a second penned: 'I've literally just purchased mint and citronella oil to add to a spray a bottle as we have had loads of spiders so far already and I can't bear them.'\n\nSylvia Crawford, from the UK, revealed how she was able to keep spiders at bay with the use of mint leaves from ASDA and antibacterial spray from Waitrose\n\nCreative Sylvia went on to explain that her discovery saw her watching the spiders 'run' as she sprayed.\n\n'They hate mint right enough,' she penned. 'Some people use essential oils but I just thought I would use up what I had.'\n\nWith the cost of ASDA' fresh mint leaves a mere 50p and a bottle of antibacterial spray from Waitrose just 77p, Sylvia's useful trick totals a bargain \u00a31.27.\n\nFollowing the smart hack, more than 1,000 social media users were quick to praise the useful trick.\n\nThe Facebook user shared a picture of Asda's fresh mint leaves and the bottle of antibacterial spray from Waitrose that she had used to get rid of the eight-legged insects\n\nSylvia, whose purchase cost a bargain \u00a31.27, told the group she sprayed under the window sill and saw the spiders 'run away'\n\n'Seen this and might try it outside around windows and doors,' enthused one, while a second member suggested: 'Plain salt water kills spiders and their nests.'\n\nEager to share their enthusiasm, another social media user commented: 'I already have a bottle.'\n\nHowever, another person disagreed with the trick and stated that spiders were actually valuable insects: 'To scare spiders? Really? Beneficial insects,' she wrote.\n\nAccording to the British Pet Control Association, while spiders in the UK are not dangerous, the best way to remove them from the household is to place a small carton over them and gently place them outside.\n\nSome companies can also provide house owners with alternative treatment methods.", "description": "Sylvia Crawford, believed to be from the UK, revealed how she was able to keep spiders at bay with the use of mint leaves from ASDA and antibacterial spray from Waitrose.", "authors": ["Bhvishya Patel For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/03/14/19253610-0-image-a-35_1570108355329.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
