The good news, as you see in this chart, is that the 2017 tax reform improved America\u2019s ranking from 28 to 21.\n\nThe bad news is that the United States is still in the bottom half of industrialized nations.\n\nWe should copy Estonia, which has been in first place for six consecutive years.\n\nFor the sixth year in a row, Estonia has the best tax code in the OECD. Its top score is driven by four positive features of its tax code. First, it has a 20 percent tax rate on corporate income that is only applied to distributed profits. Second, it has a flat 20 percent tax on individual income that does not apply to personal dividend income. Third, its property tax applies only to the value of land, rather than to the value of real property or capital. Finally, it has a territorial tax system that exempts 100 percent of foreign profits earned by domestic corporations from domestic taxation, with few restrictions. \u2026For the sixth year in a row, France has the least competitive tax system in the OECD. It has one of the highest corporate income tax rates in the OECD (34.4 percent), high property taxes, a net tax on real estate wealth, a financial transaction tax, and an estate tax. France also has high, progressive, individual income taxes that apply to both dividend and capital gains income.\n\nHere are some other important observations from the report, including mostly positive news on wealth taxation as well as more information on France\u2019s fiscal decay.\n\n\u2026some countries like the United States and Belgium have reduced their corporate income tax rates by several percentage points, others, like Korea and Portugal, have increased them. Corporate tax base improvements have been put in place in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada, while tax bases were made less competitive in Chile and Korea. Several EU countries have recently adopted international tax regulations like Controlled Foreign Corporation rules that can have negative economic impacts. Additionally, while many countries have removed their net wealth taxes in recent decades, Belgium recently adopted a new tax on net wealth. \u2026Over the last few decades, France has introduced several reforms that have significantly increased marginal tax rates on work, saving, and investment.\n\nFor those who like data, here are the complete rankings, which also show how countries score in the various component variables.\n\nNotice that the United States (highlighted in red) gets very bad scores for property taxation and international tax rules. But that bad news is somewhat offset by getting a very good score on consumption taxation (let\u2019s hope politicians never achieve their dream of imposing a value-added tax!).\n\nAnd it\u2019s no big surprise to see countries like New Zealand and Switzerland get high scores.\n\nP.S. My only complaint about the International Tax Competitiveness Index is that I would like it to include even more information. There presumably would be challenges in finding apples-to-apples comparative data, but I\u2019d be curious to find out whether Hong Kong and Singapore would beat out Estonia. And would zero-tax jurisdictions such as Monaco and the Cayman Islands get the highest scores of all? Also, what would happen if a variable on the aggregate tax burden was added to the equation? I\u2019m guessing some nations such as Sweden and the Netherlands might fall, while other countries such as Chile and Poland (and probably the U.S.) would climb.", "description": "The Tax Foundation churns out\u00a0lots of good information, but I .10/04/2019 12:54:23PM EST.", "authors": ["Daniel J.
