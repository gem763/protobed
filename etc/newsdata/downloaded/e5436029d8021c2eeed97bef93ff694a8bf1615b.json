Have you noticed the Benjamin Franklin bust in the background and the clock on the mantle bisecting the frame? The instantly iconic photo of Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi literally standing up to Donald Trump in a contentious cabinet-room meeting about Syria on Wednesday is sparking a great many takes, both about the political dynamics\u2014Pelosi stood out, literally, as a woman at a table lined predominantly with men\u2014and the photo\u2019s artistry. It was snapped and released by an uncredited White House photographer.\n\nTellingly, the president perceived the photo of a powerful woman asserting herself as somehow incriminating: He tweeted it on Wednesday night with the cantankerous caption: \u201cNervous Nancy\u2019s unhinged meltdown.\u201d But it was quickly reclaimed as more evidence of the first and only female Speaker\u2019s political courage; Pelosi herself made it her Twitter background photo.\n\nDiscourse soon raged about the photo\u2019s composition, lighting, and even its likenesses to The Last Supper. To further examine what will surely go down as a historical Trump-era photo, Vogue asked an art history professor, a museum curator, and two former coeditors of the Tabloid Art History Twitter account for their close reads.\n\nNika Elder, Ph.D., assistant professor of American Art at American University\n\nOne of the things that stood out to me is that Nancy Pelosi is standing at the same height as the bust of Benjamin Franklin. It draws an equivalence between the two of them in terms of their impact. And her figure is actually being superimposed on the bust of George Washington\u2014that\u2019s who we would see if she were sitting down. Basically, the photo is replacing this sculpture of the first president with the living, breathing body of the first female Speaker of the House.\n\nPairing people with sculptural busts actually has a precedent in art history. It\u2019s by no means an exact parallel, but Portrait of Citizen Belley, ex-Representative of the Colonies by a French artist named Girodet came to mind. It\u2019s a portrait of a man named Jean-Baptiste Belley, who was involved in the Haitian Revolution and went on to become the first black deputy in the National Convention in France, and he\u2019s standing next to a classic bust of a [white] philosopher named Raynal. The painting as a whole is speaking to ideas about black liberation. When I looked at the Pelosi photo, it\u2019s using a similar strategy to make a point about female power.\n\nAnother important aspect of the photo is the painting hanging on the back wall: It\u2019s by a French artist, Charles \u00c9douard Armand-Dumaresq, and it depicts the Declaration of Independence. Paintings like this one are called history paintings. They were really popular at the end of the 18th century and beginning of the 19th, and they depicted important political events, military events, and diplomatic events. [American artist] John Trumbull did all of these massive history paintings in the Capitol\u2014Nancy Pelosi herself surely sees them often. The Pelosi photo reads like a modern-day equivalent of one of those paintings, but with one important difference: There is a woman in it, and she\u2019s the most active and most powerful person in the image. This is a photo encapsulating the idea that the future is female.\n\nChloe Esslemont and Mayanne Soret, coeditors of the former Twitter account, Tabloid Art History\n\nChloe Esslemont: Part of what strikes me about this image is that the internet loves to shout \u201cAccidental Renaissance\u201d at compelling candid pics. Usually when that\u2019s done, the pictures actually fit more into the Baroque category, with lots of dramatic movement. For once, this Pelosi/Trump image does actually seem to fit more into the Renaissance side of things, with less of the \u201cin the moment\u201d movement that characterized Baroque images; most of the figures here have more of the \u201cstillness\u201d quality that differentiates the two.\n\nThe background behind Pelosi is a white background that is radiating light\u2014it makes her stand out, and the figure of her head/torso appears clearer than it would if it had been shot face on, which would have seen the people sitting behind her be the background. I think if it was head-on, that would definitely evoke even more of a Renaissance feel\u2014think about the POV of The Last Supper, for example.", "description": "We asked a curator, an art professor, and the Tabloid Art History editors to close read the image for Renaissance influences and hints of Norman Rockwell.", "authors": ["Michelle Ruiz"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5tzJldi1cgL1j9KUBDbcBA--~B/aD0xMzY0O3c9MjA0ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/vogue_137/e803932161bc477bf11c06cd98da8c9b", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
