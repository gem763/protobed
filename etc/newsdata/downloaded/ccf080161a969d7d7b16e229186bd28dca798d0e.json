Barksdale\u2019s faulty ball-strike calls did not define the Houston Astros\u2019 7-1 victory in Game 5 of the World Series, and they did not deserve credit reserved for Gerrit Cole or blame assigned to Washington\u2019s quiet bats and leaky bullpen. But they did overtake the conversation during the game, and they will provide a backdrop as Major League Baseball continues a seemingly inevitable \u2014 if potentially misguided \u2014 creep toward robot umpires.\n\nAll game, the Nationals fumed over borderline calls that went against them. Immediately and decisively, technology allowed them, their fans and anybody with an Internet connection to validate their anger. The combination proved toxic for the sport. On its grandest stage, umpiring decisions became not only a small part of why the Nationals sunk into a 3-2 series hole but also a dominant topic of conversation that overshadowed the baseball brilliance on display.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt is precisely that scenario that prompts MLB\u2019s consideration of an automated ball-strike system. Players, media and fans have instant access to data compiled by TrackMan and synthesized into binary outcomes. Ball or strike. Right or wrong. The only person without access is the umpire, the man charged with making decisions that games and seasons and legacies hang on.\n\nOn several occasions Sunday night, the technology left no doubt that Barksdale \u2014 an umpire whom even aggrieved Nationals classified as proficient at his job \u2014 had gotten it wrong. In the sixth inning, reliever Tanner Rainey threw a fastball to Michael Brantley that was in the zone on its entire path and didn\u2019t even touch a corner, and Barksdale called it a ball.\n\nIn the seventh inning, Robles took a 3-2, 98-mph fastball from Cole that started well outside the zone and swerved back toward the corner but didn\u2019t come close to touching it. When Barksdale rang him up, equipment flew and boos rained. In a regular season game, both Robles and Manager Dave Martinez, who railed from the top step, probably would have been ejected for their outbursts. Barksdale may have spared them because even he knew they were justified.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfterward, the Nationals opted for diplomacy. First baseman Ryan Zimmerman said Cole beat them, not Barksdale. Catcher Yan Gomes acknowledged the questions would not be asked if there wasn\u2019t a problem, but he offered no criticism.\n\n\u201cYou know what? I will not ever sit here and criticize an umpire,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cI\u2019ve known Lance for a very long time, and he\u2019s really good. And that\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say about it. I\u2019m not going to sit here \u2014 I know there were some choice words, but that\u2019s just in the heat of the moment. They\u2019re doing their job, and they do it really well. That\u2019s why they\u2019re an umpire in the World Series.\u201d\n\nA reporter asked outfielder Adam Eaton about whether, after a season spent controlling the strike zone so well, he and his teammates found frustration by a zone taken out of their control.\n\n\u201cDid you watch the game?\u201d Eaton said, cracking a wry smile.\n\nThe game is not only watched. It is analyzed and tracked to a granular level. After an at-bat or an inning on the mound, players can pick up a tablet in the dugout and confirm their suspicions that they had been jobbed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt can be frustrating when you\u2019re not getting borderline calls and then you see some borderline calls go the other way,\u201d reliever Sean Doolittle said. \u201cBut that\u2019s part of the human element of the game. I thought there were times tonight when we didn\u2019t get a call. Tanner Rainey, for example. He stayed in it, and I think he got him out on the very next pitch. Joe Ross made a great pitch to [Carlos] Correa and put it right on the corner. He just didn\u2019t get it. He hits the home run a couple pitches later.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough, but it\u2019s still part of the game. It should\u2019ve been a walk to Robles, and \u2014 I don\u2019t know. I think what we can\u2019t do right now \u2014 and I don\u2019t think anybody in here is using it as an excuse or a crutch \u2014 but it can\u2019t be something we\u2019re thinking about. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be, knowing the character of this team. You\u2019ve got to turn the page and come out ready to go in Game 6. Whole new ballgame.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the minor leagues when we didn\u2019t have any of that [technology], we still were able to yell at the umpires,\u201d Eaton said. \u201cAs players, you just have an overall feeling of how the game\u2019s going and the vibe of guys coming back. We discuss literally every pitch to each other. I would agree you have the evidence right then and there.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe next logical step, of course, is that if everybody can see clear-cut results immediately, why shouldn\u2019t they be used to determine outcomes rather than a failure-prone set of human eyes? Game 5 of the World Series raised the question: Should MLB use an electronic system to call balls and strikes?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Doolittle said. \u201cI\u2019ve gone back and forth on this. I don\u2019t know. We can talk about it after the World Series.\u201d\n\n\u201cCall me in like January or spring training and ask me that question,\u201d Eaton said.\n\nGomes had the most clever version of avoidance. Asked whether the box representing the strike zone on a pitch-tracking display should determine actual balls and strikes, he paused. \u201cWouldn\u2019t the box get in the way?\u201d he said, chuckling.\n\nAD\n\nIt may be coming soon. If you want to know how MLB wants to run its game, the best place to look is the minor leagues, where it can implement rule changes without restriction imposed by the collective bargaining agreement. This year, MLB formed a partnership with the independent Atlantic League and experimented with robot umpires by using a setup called the automated ball-strike system. It also employed the ABS system this year in the Arizona Fall League.\n\nAD\n\nThe introduction of the system in the majors would come with undesirable consequences, some of them unintended and some unforeseen. It would change the way the sport looks as we know it. For 150 years, a pitcher who missed his spot in the strike zone and made his catcher lunge awkwardly often was punished with a ball; those would become strikes. The three-dimensional nature of the strike zone, and the human eye\u2019s ability to recognize how a 90-mph projectile flies through that plot, means balls in the dirt have always been balls, even if they clip the very front of the zone at the knees. Those would become strikes. It would also eradicate the skill of pitch framing or expanding the zone throughout the game, skills that make baseball richer.\n\nMLB does not want the problem the NFL faces. It introduced replay to get calls right. New technology necessitated an expansion of the rule book, to the point that trying to define a simple act such as a catch is rendered undecipherable. Trying to legislate out officiating errors introduced more problems and bastardized the game. Rule books are written with human eyes in mind, and legislating sports with advanced tech inherently changes how those rules govern the sport.\n\nAD\n\nBut maintaining the status quo also creates problems. It places umpires in an unfair spot, and their exposure is only growing. A Twitter account with the handle @Jomboy_ has gained a following for an expert ability to enhance and isolate audio of players and umpires picked up by broadcast microphones. After Rainey\u2019s should-have-been strike three, it picked up an exchange between Gomes and Barksdale.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou were taking off on me,\u201d Barksdale said, seeming to suggest he had called the pitch a ball because Gomes had leaped out of his crouch in anticipation of a strike call, which could be perceived as a form of showing up the umpire.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d Gomes replied, putting both hands on his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nUmp doesn't call strike three. Tells Gomes he was taking off on him. Gomes replies 'Oh it's my fault?\"\n\n\n\nThen Martinez kindly asks the up to wake up because its the World Series. pic.twitter.com/iRUr349bQh \u2014 Jomboy (@Jomboy_) October 28, 2019\n\nFrom the dugout, Martinez screamed at Barksdale. \u201cIt\u2019s the World Series!\u201d he shouted. \u201cWake up!\u201d Other voices offered their feedback in a more profane manner.\n\nThe Nationals can only hope the calls go their way in Game 6. And MLB can only hope the focus returns to the players.\n\n\u201cThrough time, you see umpires and players and managers going at it about the strike zone,\u201d Eaton said. \u201cI think it\u2019s no different now. It\u2019s part of the game I enjoy. I think the banter is great. It\u2019s unbelievable. It\u2019s what makes baseball great. But when you\u2019re on sometimes the bad end of it, it\u2019s not all that fun. That\u2019s the beauty of baseball.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRead more:", "description": "The blown calls in Game 5 will provide a backdrop as Major League Baseball continues a seemingly inevitable \u2014 if potentially misguided \u2014 creep toward robot umpires.", "authors": ["Adam Kilgore", "Reporter Covering National Sports"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ord0qTjoGA1fHvK2cfXLxQ-KV3E=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4I3N4OHZFQI6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
