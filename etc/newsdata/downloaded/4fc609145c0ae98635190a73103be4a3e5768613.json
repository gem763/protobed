Now, when I change the background...ah!\"\n\n(Image: Twitter)\n\n(Image: Twitter)\n\nCarol's lime green dress, along with her torso, appears on the screen.\n\nCarol posted the clip to her 164,000 followers with the caption \"This is why we don't wear green in front of the green screen xxx\" along with a string of cry laugh emojis.\n\nAppearing in the 2015 edition of Strictly, Carol was paired with the hunky pro Pasha Kovalev.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nDespite, finishing tenth, she seems to have enjoyed the experience and reflected on it co-hosts Dan walker and Louise Minchin.\n\n\"Carol, how many years is it now since you did Strictly?\" Dan asked.\n\n\"Four,\" she laughed.\n\nWhen Dan asked if she had any fond memories, Carol beamed: \"Yes! You know I'll never forget it and I'll never regret.\"\n\nShe's set a trend of broadcasters turning their eyes on the dance floor, as sports presenter Mike Bushell is currently locked in a struggle for survival in Strictly's 17th series.\n\nMike survived a dance off with former England goalkeeper David James at the weekend by the skin of his teeth, and some fans reckon he'll get the boot this Sunday.", "description": "Carol was wearing a green dress which made her body blend into the green screen map of the UK behind her", "authors": ["Will Twigger", "Image", "Twitter", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20703866.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Carol-Kirkwood.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
