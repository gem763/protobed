Gordon\u2019s absence comes after he appeared to twist his knee on Thursday against the New York Giants.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nBe OK Josh Gordon pic.twitter.com/TLf275ZPVi \u2014 Warren Sharp (@SharpFootball) October 11, 2019\n\nAlso questionable are receiver Julian Edelman (chest), Phillip Dorsett (hamstring), Gunner Olszewski (hamstring), running back Rex Burkhead (foot), and safety Patrick Chung (heel, chest). One or more of those players could be downgraded.\n\nIn total, the injury report accounts for a total of 1,253 of New England\u2019s 1,789 receiving yards this season.\n\nBen Watson\u2019s return becomes more important\n\nAssuming most, if not all, of the questionable players end up playing (these are the Patriots, after all), the biggest question facing the team figures to be how well Ben Watson slots in now that he and blocking specialist Eric Tomlinson are the team\u2019s only healthy tight ends.\n\nLaCosse and Izzo were the only tight ends to post receiving yards this year for the Patriots, though they weren\u2019t a focal point of the offense with 169 yards between them.\n\nStory continues\n\nWatson posted 400 receiving yards and two touchdowns with the New Orleans Saints last year before retiring, un-retiring, signing with the Patriots, getting a four-game suspension for performance-enhancing drugs, getting released by the Patriots after his reinstatement, then re-signing with the team just a week later.\n\nThe Patriots will be without Josh Gordon this week.
