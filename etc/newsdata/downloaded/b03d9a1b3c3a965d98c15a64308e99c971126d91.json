They won 11 out of 12 from Aug. 25-Sept. 7 to pull within 1\u00bd games of the second wild card spot, but are now 4\u00bd behind the Chicago Cubs with just 14 to play.\n\nVotto, who turned 36 earlier this week, gave the Reds a 2-0 lead in the third inning when he hit a two-run homer over the left field wall. It was his 15th of the season.\n\nThe Diamondbacks pulled within 2-1 in the fourth before VanMeter launched a two-out, two-run homer to extend the Reds\u2018 lead. Both runs were unearned because of an error by second baseman Wilmer Flores.\n\nRaisel Iglesias pitched a scoreless ninth, working around Ketel Marte\u2019s two-out double, for his 30th save.\n\nCastillo (15-6) gave up two runs over five innings, striking out three to push his season total to 211. The Reds have won four of his last five starts.\n\nMike Leake (11-11) threw six innings for the Diamondbacks, giving up five hits and four runs (two earned).\n\nWEB GEMS\n\nCincinnati shortstop Jos\u00e9 Iglesias made two phenomenal defensive plays, including one that saved a run.\n\nThe first was when the 29-year-old leapt to grab Adam Jones\u2019 liner that seemed headed for the left-center field gap. The second was when he dove to grab Christian Walker\u2019s hard grounder before turning to make the throw and get the third out at second base, which stranded Ketel Marte at third.\n\nHAZEN EXTENDED\n\nThe Diamondbacks announced before the game that they\u2019ve extended the contract of GM Mike Hazen.\n\nThe team didn\u2019t release details of the extension. The 43-year-old was hired in 2016 and has kept the Diamondbacks competitive in the NL Western Division, though they\u2019ve finished behind the Dodgers each year.\n\nHazen\u2019s name had been linked to the GM opening with the Boston Red Sox after they fired Dave Dombrowski. Hazen worked in the Red Sox front office before being hired by the Diamondbacks.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nDiamondbacks: Luke Weaver (4-3, 3.03 ERA) threw two scoreless innings on Friday in a rehab assignment in Single-A Visalia. The right-hander hasn\u2019t pitched in the big leagues since May 26 because of forearm tightness.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nReds: RHP Anthony DeSclafani (9-8, 4.06 ERA) is scheduled to start. He\u2019s pitched at least six innings in each of his last four outings and has a 2-1 record with a 2.32 ERA over his last five starts.\n\nDiamondbacks: RHP Merrill Kelly (10-14, 4.68) will start for the first time against the Reds. Kelly\u2019s spot rotation was in peril a few weeks ago, but he\u2019s been better in his last two outings, giving up three earned runs over 13 innings.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Joey Votto and Josh VanMeter homered, Luis Castillo pitched five solid innings and the Cincinnati Reds beat the Arizona Diamondbacks 4-3 on Friday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "David Brandt"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/14/reds_diamondbacks_baseball_78408_c0-151-3600-2249_s1770x1032.jpg?86a0ad2941f4f8cac64fde118e16286d6ebd0c8d", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
