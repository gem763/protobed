Rebekah Vardy (pictured) lashed out at Danielle Lloyd on Thursday after she slated her on This Morning - Danielle said she thought Vardy was guilty of leaking Coleen Rooney stories\n\nHitting back: Rebekah implied that Danielle was holding a grudge for other reasons with her cryptic post - suggesting that it was because she failed to set her up with a man a while back\n\nHer response: Danielle quickly hit back at Rebekah's words as the WAG war rumbled on\n\nShe wrote: 'Danielle Lloyd making false claims on @thismorning that we have had \u2018similar run-ins\u2019 is utter b****cks.\n\n'She is just fuming that I \u2018didn\u2019t get Jamie recruiting\u2019 for her like she asked me to...'\n\nBecky seems to be implying that Danielle is holding a grudge against her, after Jamie (Vardy) failed to find her a man after Danielle split from ex-husband, fellow footballer, Jamie O'Hara.\n\nDanielle and O'Hara were married from 2012 - 2014 and have three sons together.\n\nHand-WAGS at dawn: Rebekah laid into Danielle (right) after she claimed she wasn't shocked to see Coleen call out the WAG for betraying her and said: 'I've had similar run-ins with her before'\n\nOpinionated: Danielle seemed pretty sure of her opinion that Vardy is in the wrong and said 'she probably thought she wouldn't get caught'\n\nBoth sides: However, Lizzie Cundy (left), played devil's advocate and said there is a chance that Rebekah is innocent. She said: 'It doesn\u2019t mean you're guilty, just because you\u2019re friends with journos'\n\nShe is now happily married to electrician Michael O'Neill and they have a son called Ronnie, 23 months.\n\nBecky then tweeted: 'On a more serious note I\u2019ve been inundated with messages from everyone but I\u2019m not saying anything more until we\u2019ve finished looking into this situation properly.'\n\nDanielle shot back: '@RebekahVardy Do you mean like how the sun recruited you Luv! #secretwag.'\n\nThings on her mind: Coleen was pictured stepping out on Thursday lunchtime as the war rumbled on\n\nTaking her side: Danielle has been good friends with Coleen for some time\n\nTaking sides: The day before, Danielle clearly made her feelings known when she started replying to Coleen's post with RAT emojis about Becky\n\nNot having it: Danielle also defended herself against a follower who said she should leave Rebekah alone because she is pregnant\n\n'We are all entitled to our opinions and we all know it came from your account attacking me won\u2019t take that away another low blow by you #notagirlsgirl.' [sic].\n\nThe words came moments after Danielle joined fellow former WAG Lizzie Cundy on This Morning to discuss the war between Coleen and Becky.\n\nDanielle believes Rebekah IS guilty of leaking stories about Coleen, (a claim she denies), and said she has had similar issues with her before.\n\nMore to come: Rebekah (pictured with husband Jamie) appears to be fuming about Danielle's words on TV and is keen to clear her name\n\nFellow WAG: Danielle and O'Hara were married from 2012 - 2014 and have three sons together\n\nColeen released a statement on Wednesday, accusing Rebekah of leaking fake stories about her to The Sun and Danielle posting some rat emojis in the comments as she threw her support behind Wayne's wife.\n\nShe had shared them on her private Instagram, but blocked all her friends from viewing them except Rebekah, in order to get conclusive proof of a betrayal.\n\nDanielle said: 'I think Becky did it as she thought she probably wouldn't get caught.'\n\nLizzie was previously married to footballer Jason Cundy and Danielle was married to O'Hara.\n\nLizzie, 50, who also follows Coleen's private Instagram account said she had noticed Coleen had 'gone quiet' as she had blocked all her friends from viewing her stories... except Becky.\n\nBold: Coleen released a statement on Wednesday revealing she had been posting fake stories on her Instagram which she believes were leaked by Rebekah\n\nNot true: Rebekah, who has been friends with Coleen for years (pictured in 2016) has denied all allegations and said she is 'disgusted' to be dealing with this while heavily pregnant\n\nThe full statement: Coleen made these shock claims on Instagram after discovering she had been betrayed by someone close to her and she concluded that it was Rebekah Vardy's account\n\n'I don't need the money': Rebekah denied all accusations against her minutes after the post and said she had nothing to gain and had no financial motivation - she also slammed her for going public when she is heavily pregnant\n\nShe said: 'I thought she had gone quiet. We\u2019ve all got busy lives, but who knew she was being Columbo. I was so shocked.\n\n'When I saw the post, I couldn\u2019t believe it. Why would she do it? To get brownie points with journalists?'\n\nBut Danielle said the revelation didn't surprise her as she made her own feelings on Becky quite clear.\n\nFinding out the truth: Hosts Holly WIlloughby and Phillip Schofield listened in to Lizzie and Danielle's debate\n\nDiplomatic: Lizzie said that people should not assume that Vardy is guilty\n\nShe said: 'I wasn\u2019t shocked. I\u2019ve had run-ins with Rebekah over similar things.'\n\nAfter the show, Danielle also responded to a viewer who wrote that Danielle and Coleen shouldn't have waded in while Rebekah is heavily pregnant.\n\nDanielle hit back with: 'She is big enough and ok enough to pipe up to me though while pregnant.'\n\nMeanwhile, diplomatic Lizzie defended Coleen's decision to publicly 'out' Becky and said: 'She's had two years of these stories disturbing her own family. She's had to get to the bottom of it.'\n\nDanielle said: 'She must have been sitting there not knowing who to trust, it\u2019s not a nice situation to be in at all.'\n\nHowever, Lizzie played devil's advocate and said there is a chance that Rebekah is innocent.\n\n'They've got beef': Twitter went wild with many viewers taking Danielle's side but others thought she may have an agenda\n\nShe said: 'It doesn\u2019t mean you're guilty, just because you\u2019re friends with journos. I do a radio show with one. Coleen wouldn\u2019t have gone through this if she didn\u2019t have concrete evidence.'\n\nDanielle added: 'It\u2019s defo come from Becky\u2019s account. I think she did it, sadly I really do. It\u2019s a Shame as she probably thought she wouldn\u2019t get caught.\n\n'She must have thought that if she was feeding the press stories, she would get more headlines for herself.'\n\nCan't believe it: Lizzie is good friends with Becky (pictured together in January 2018) and said she is shocked at the latest news but admits Coleen would have been sure before sharing that post\n\nBut Lizzie concluded: 'There's nothing worse that being accused. If Becky\u2019s saying she didn\u2019t do it, Coleen's got to show the proof.\n\n'I\u2019ve had it done to me and it\u2019s the worse thing in the world.'\n\nTwitter went wild during the interview as the feud has captured the interests of the nation.\n\nViewers wrote: 'Agreeing with Danielle Lloyd. A new low for me. #ThisMorning.'\n\n'They've got Danielle Lloyd on This Morning saying she thinks Rebekah Vardy did it and this is the content we, as a society going through a stressful time, deserve.'\n\n'Danielle Lloyd obviously has \"beef\" with Rebekah Vardy.'\n\n'I agree with her I think Rebekah 100% did it!'\n\nHeavily pregnant Rebekah has denied all accusations against her and said she will clear her name, but Lizzie told Channel 5 news the day before that Coleen wouldn't have pointed the finger if she had any doubt.\n\nDumbfounded: Lizzie told broadcaster Claudia-Liza Armah about her friendship with both Coleen and Rebekah and said: 'Well, like everyone else, I am in total shock'\n\nTalking from her home, Lizzie told broadcaster Claudia-Liza Armah about her friendship with both Coleen and Rebekah and said: 'Well, like everyone else, I am in total shock.\n\n'Coleen has been doing her detective work for a couple of years now. I know these stories about her have been repeatedly coming out in the press.\n\n'She really wanted to get to the bottom of it and she did. I know Coleen and I am friends with both. Coleen is very intelligent, very bright. I don't think she is given enough credit for that.\n\nLizzie said: 'I know Coleen and I am friends with both. Coleen is very intelligent, very bright. I don't think she is given enough credit for that'\n\nThe FAKE stories Coleen shared which were sold to The Sun and followed by media outlets Wayne and Coleen Rooney's \u00a320m 'Morrisons' manor is 'flooded On Tuesday, it was claimed that the Rooney's basement had flooded due to Storm Lorenzo. It was said to have caused a 'massively stressful' setback in the completion of the sprawling three-storey mansion Coleen Rooney 'is so desperate for a baby girl that she's looked into controversial \u00a38K gender selection treatment' The Sun first reported that mother of four sons, Coleen had looked into 'gender selection' treatment in a desperate bid for a daughter and had flown to Mexico earlier this year to discuss the controversial \u00a38,000 treatment with doctors Coleen Rooney 'hopes to revive her TV career including a Strictly stint now she's moved back to the UK' after husband Wayne's scandal The Sun wrote that she was in talks to revive her once successful UK TV career now her family has moved back to this side of the Atlantic. The mother-of-four apparently had to decline the offer to appear on this year's Strictly Come Dancing but could compete in 2020\n\n'She is determined and wanted to know who is releasing these stories. Whether it's right to out someone in the way she did is another question, but it was really upsetting her and upsetting her family life.'\n\nLizzie said she admires the way Coleen found out the truth.\n\nShe said: 'She wanted to get to the bottom of it. It was a clever way to do it. I am one of the followers who follow her on her private Instagram.\n\n'And I did wonder what was going on as she had been very quiet. I've got such a busy life and I didn't see anything coming up - but I would have a flick through.'\n\nLizzie knows Rebekah well and said she still can't believe this is something she would do.\n\nShe said: 'I can't believe she would do this. What are the reasons? She doesn't need the money. She has got a wonderful lifetyle, a wonderful family. It just beggars belief.'\n\nClaudia made clear that Vardy has denied the accusations and that other people do have access to her Instagram account.\n\nShe asked Lizzie what Rebekah is really like and she replied: 'I love her. We were at the National Television Awards together. We have great fun.\n\n'She doesn't need the money, she doesn't need the fame. The only other reason is possibly to keep in with journalists and press by giving these stories.\n\n'I have to say, for Coleen to do this, she must have had concrete evidence, because there is no way she would put this on social media knowing it's going out to the world.\n\n'She wouldn't do this unless she knew 100%. Really, I just can't believe that Becky would do this. Coleen really feel she has done it.'\n\nClaudia added: 'Rebekah also follows two of the journalists who reportedly posted these stories.'\n\nLizzie replied: 'Well yeah she does. But she is in the public eye. There are a lot of journalists who follow me and I follow them.\n\nThe flip side: Claudia-Liza Armah made clear that Vardy has denied the accusations and that other people do have access to her Instagram account\n\nLizzie said: 'I do a radio show with one of the top journalists in the country. It's part of our work. It doesn't mean she's guilty' - pictured with handsome co-host Stephen Leng\n\n'I do a radio show with one of the top journalists in the country. It's part of our work. It doesn't mean she's guilty.'\n\nLizzie also hinted that Coleen could have got the idea for her detective work from Jennifer Lopez.\n\nShe said: 'I once interviewed J-Lo and I asked her how she keeps her close knit circle of friends and how does she know who to trust?\n\n'She said, \"I give fake stories and when that fake story is released, I know it's them and I get rid of them\".\n\n'Coleen felt very strongly about this and it's been very upsetting to her and her family for months.\n\n'She wanted to out that person... and that person is Becky Vardy.'", "description": "Rebekah Vardy took to Twitter to lash out at fellow former WAG Danielle Lloyd just moments after she slated her in a This Morning interview on Thursday.", "authors": ["Rebecca Davison For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/12/19536508-0-image-a-79_1570707025404.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
