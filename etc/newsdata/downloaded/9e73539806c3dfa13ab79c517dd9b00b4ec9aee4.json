REUTERS/Mary F. Calvert/File Photo\n\nThe cause of death was \u201ccomplications concerning longstanding health challenges,\u201d his office said in a statement. Cummings had been absent recently from Congress due to health concerns including heart and knee problems.\n\nThe son of sharecroppers who rose to lead the powerful House Oversight and Reform Committee, Cummings clashed with Trump over multiple probes involving the Republican president, from his personal finances to possible abuses at federal agencies.\n\nThe oversight committee is one of three congressional panels leading impeachment proceedings that were launched on Sept. 24 after Trump asked Ukraine to investigate 2020 Democratic presidential rival Joe Biden.\n\nCummings\u2019 replacement as chairman will be decided in the coming days, largely by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Such replacements are often based on seniority, which would put Representative Carolyn Maloney of New York next in line, but it is not necessarily the deciding factor.\n\nThe Maryland Democrat, first elected in 1996, served as oversight chairman since January after the Democrats gained control of the House of Representatives in 2018 elections.\n\nBefore the impeachment probe, Cummings\u2019 committee had been investigating whether Trump used his office to enrich himself, his family or his businesses including Trump hotels.\n\nHis panel has also been involved in fights with the Trump administration over subpoenas challenged by the president.\n\nThe African American lawmaker called Trump a racist and sharply criticized his immigration policies.\n\nTRUMP CONDOLENCES\n\nDespite their differences, Trump issued condolences to Cummings family and friends on Thursday.\n\n\u201cI got to see first hand the strength, passion and wisdom of this highly respected political leader. His work and voice on so many fronts will be very hard, if not impossible, to replace!\u201d he said on Twitter.\n\nCummings\u2019 investigations drew Trump\u2019s ire over the summer after his committee issued subpoenas to White House officials, including Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, in a probe of government record-keeping.\n\nIn July, Trump called Cummings a \u201cbrutal bully\u201d who should concentrate on cleaning up his \u201cdisgusting, rat and rodent infested\u201d Baltimore district rather than criticizing the work of U.S. immigration officers on the Mexican border.\n\nFellow Democrats recognized Cummings\u2019 commitment to fairness, civil rights and to his hometown, a diverse city that has struggled with racism and poverty.\n\n\u201cToday we have lost a giant,\u201d U.S. House Majority Whip James Clyburn said.\n\nFellow Maryland lawmaker U.S. Senator Ben Cardin said, \u201cCummings guaranteed a voice to so many who would otherwise not have one, and stood as a symbol for the heights one could reach if they paid no mind to obstacles, naysayers and hate.\u201d\n\nSome Republicans issued tributes including Cummings\u2019 oversight committee colleague Mark Meadows. \u201cThere was no stronger advocate and no better friend than Elijah Cummings,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo, a congressman before becoming one of Trump\u2019s most trusted advisers, called Cummings a \u201cdedicated public servant\u201d in a Twitter post.\n\nCummings was a trial lawyer before being elected to office to represent Baltimore and other parts of central Maryland, and has championed civil rights issues.\n\nHe graduated from Howard University, where he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in political science, and the University of Maryland School of Law.", "description": "U.S. Representative Elijah Cummings, one of the most influential Democrats in Congress and a key figure in the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump, died on Thursday at age 68.", "authors": ["Rich Mckay", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441895587&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G1BM", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
