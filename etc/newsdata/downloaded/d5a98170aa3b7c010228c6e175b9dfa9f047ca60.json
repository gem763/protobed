Once the water gets halfway up the tires of the car, SUV, or firetruck, it's prone to be swept away.\"\n\n3 things to survive a flash flood in a car\n\nABC News\n\n1. Don't let the car fill up before getting out\n\nThe first step is to take off your seat belt and roll the window down as quickly as possible. Because most cars' electric system would eventually fail, it's vital to get it down before that happens. Also, don't touch your phone until you're out of the car.\n\nWhen the water rushes in like this, experts say you want to get out of the car as quickly as you can because the car can potentially flip upside down.\n\nWithin three minutes, the car Gutman was in for the demonstration had already risen from his feet up to his hips.\n\n2. Get to the roof\n\nOnce the windows are down, make sure to use the tools your car gives you, such as the seat-belt, which can be used as a safety line for support.\n\nAfter you've made it onto the roof, call 911 for help and stay put as long as possible, because it's much easier be spotted by rescuers on the roof than in the rapids.\n\nThomas B. Shea/Getty Images\n\nPeople often get knocked off their cars into the water, so if you were to get swept away, practice defensive swimming, which Gutman immediately did. It entails keeping your feet up to avoid getting stuck or pulled under and also to conserve energy.\n\nOnce a person is close enough to shore or an area where the water calms, experts suggest offensive swimming, which means swimming as fast as possible to get to safety.\n\n3. Turn around don't drown\n\nMost importantly, Berna wants you to remember the rule of thumb.\n\n\"If you're approaching a flood at roadway, remember it's not worth it,\" Berna said. \"Turn around, don't drown.\"", "description": "ABC News' Matt Gutman demonstrates the severity of flash flood water at various depths to show how and when to safely get out of the situation.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/flooding-gty-er-190922_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
