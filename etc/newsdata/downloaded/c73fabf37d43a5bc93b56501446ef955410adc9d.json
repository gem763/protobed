All guests were required to show a photo ID upon entrance, photography was strictly forbidden, with attendees even having to keep their phones in sealed cases for the entire event.\n\nThere would be no leaks in Fenty-land, which began with an experiment resembling Lord of the Flies where desperate influencers were left with nothing to do with their hands.\n\nThings were more casual last year, when Rihanna enlisted a diverse cast to strut their stuff at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. (The model Slick Woods, who walked at nine months pregnant, went into labor shortly after leaving the runway.)\n\nThis time around, Amazon ran a tight ship for Rihanna\u2019s fans, the so-called Navy. From the show\u2019s announcement, which came by surprise tweet last month, the Fenty extravaganza was seen in strong contrast against Victoria\u2019s Secret annual show.\n\nThe latter, perennially controversial affair faced renewed contention this past year after former CMO Ed Razek made anti-trans comments to Vogue in November. (CEO Leslie Wexner\u2019s ties to Jeffrey Epstein did not help the brand\u2019s image.) As a result, the future of 2019\u2019s televised VS show is in flux; enter Fenty.\n\nBefore the show started, A-list guests began to trickle in. Country singer Kacey Musgraves fretted over her too-loose waistband in front of a full-length mirror in the women\u2019s room. Anna Wintour arrived, minus her ubiquitous sunglasses, as the lights in the stadium were too low for eyewear.\n\nAshley Graham, James Charles, and Paris Hilton were spotted, as well as Normani, Joan Smalls, Vanessa Hudgens, Patrick Schwarzenegger, and Lisa Rinna and her daughters Delilah Belle and Amelia Gray.\n\nThe show was held on a piazza-like stage with winding staircases and arched windows seemingly made for dancers to high-kick through. It started with a chorus of women of all sizes performing choreography by Parris Goebel.\n\n\u201c It seemed the only requirement for casting in the show was the ability to twerk with abandon and attitude \u201d\n\nRihanna was among them, thrusting her hips and flexing her wrists like a sexy flamingo. Unlike the Victoria\u2019s Secret show, where models channel innocent \"Angels,\" the Fenty women looked like praying mantises who devour their mates during sex. Every gyration or back arch seemed to say, \"Take your male gaze and shove it.\" Sensuality did not equal softness.\n\nIn between the rousing routines were walks from the likes of Gigi and Bella Hadid, Slick Woods, Cara Delevingne, and Laverne Cox. More exciting were the non-famous faces of varying sizes, ethnicities, and abilities. It seemed the only requirement for casting in the show was the ability to twerk with abandon and attitude.\n\nThere were performances from Halsey, Big Sean, Migos, and Tierra Whack. DJ Khaled, a man who proudly admits he \u201cnever\u201d goes down on women, screamed his name into a microphone over and over again, as he is known to do.\n\nThese numbers were performed to a camera crew that gamely hopped around the stage after them, which made for a somewhat clunky watch from the risers. Hopefully those viewing from home will feel as if they are up close, seeing the show from inside.\n\nRihanna made a final sweep at the end in an off-the-shoulder black leather gown, waving to everyone as her dancers took their bows. Then, as ferociously as it started, the stage went black and everyone rushed out to grab their phones. It was over\u2014at least until September 20, when the whole shebang drops on Amazon Prime.", "description": "Rihanna\u2019s New York Fashion Week show had famous guests\u2014Anna Wintour, Laverne Cox, Cara Delevingne, Gigi and Bella Hadid, and Paris Hilton\u2014and a sensual power all its own.", "authors": ["Alaina Demopoulos", "Style Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568175062/190910-alaina-fenty-tease2_smokgv", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
