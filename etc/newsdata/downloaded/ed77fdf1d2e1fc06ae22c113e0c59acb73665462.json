Joseph Votel expressed disappointment on Tuesday with the Trump administration's decision to stand down as Turkey prepares to launch military operations in northeast Syria.\n\nThe Trump administration's said Sunday that it would move a small contingent of US troops away from Syria's border with Turkey.\n\nVotel, who oversaw the US's fight against ISIS before his retirement earlier this year, described the decision as an \"abrupt policy\" that appeared to \"abandon our Kurdish partners,\" in a candid column in The Atlantic coauthored with Middle East Institute non-resident fellow Elizabeth Dent.\n\nSeveral US lawmakers and allies also described it as an abrupt move that would all but assure the deaths of Kurdish partners who led the fight against ISIS. In addition to assistance fighting ISIS, the presence of US troops at the border has been viewed as a deterrent to potential Turkish incursions in the region.\n\nUS Marines OIR Syria More\n\nCpl. Gabino Perez/US Marine Corps\n\nTurkey claims the Kurdish People's Protection Units, or YPG, and the Kurdish-majority Syrian Democratic Forces are a threat with links to the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a Turkey-based group that Ankara and the US, among others, have designated a terrorist group.\n\nThe tenuous relationship between Turkey, the Kurds, and their mutual partner in the US was evident as US forces have struggled to establish a \"safe zone\" between the Kurds and Turkey in northern Syria.\n\nVotel stressed in the column that because of the speed of ISIS's spread in Syria in 2014, the US had to go after the terrorist group \"quickly and effectively.\"\n\nThis, he writes, led to the US's reliance on 60,000 \"battle-hardened\" Kurdish forces \"fighting for their lives against ISIS.\" Roughly 11,000 people from the Kurdish militia have died in the conflict.\n\nRead more: 'The President eats his own': Military veterans in Congress unload on Trump for abandoning a US ally in the ISIS fight\n\n\"Without it, President Donald Trump could not have declared the complete defeat of ISIS,\" Votel wrote of Kurdish forces in Syria. Trump has frequently claimed ISIS has been unequivocally defeated.\n\nBut the \"sudden policy change this week breaks that trust at the most crucial juncture and leaves our partners with very limited options,\" Votel added.\n\nSenior US military officials denied the characterization of the announcement as abrupt and said they were consulted in the days before the move.\n\nA senior US State Department official also said that it did not \"support\" Turkey's looming operation \"in any way, shape or form,\" according to The Washington Post.\n\nDonald Trump Army West Point More", "description": "\"It didn't have to be this way,\" retired Army Gen.
