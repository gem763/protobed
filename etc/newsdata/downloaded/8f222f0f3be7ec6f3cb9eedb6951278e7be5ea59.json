And as freedom of choice, as we all know, is the paramount human right, we obviously are on shaky grounds here with the aforementioned experiments that I have the audacity to propose.\n\nCan I now propose a faint possibility for your consideration? Something that you seem to have overlooked?\n\nIs it possible that poverty is all about access to the right to choose?\n\nCan you try and imagine standing in front of a mansion occupied by a member of the same species claiming to be a \u201csocial animal\u201d when there is a party going on while you have not eaten for three days?\n\nWhy can\u2019t one just walk in and eat?\n\nThe reason that seems to have escaped us all is that no human is born poor, as each arrives with an equal right to the planet earth and its fruits, but some are rendered poor and forced to remain poor by the institution of state that functions to protect the right of the rich.\n\nSo, if the problem statement was really to \u201calleviate poverty\u201d, it is obvious that experiments would have been proposed to bring behavioural changes in the rich.\n\nBut, instead we are experimenting on the poor, and we can do it because we have an implicit understanding that the rich can\u2019t be subjected to experimentation or intervention as their freedom to choose, be it WCs made from solid gold or having caviar and champagne even if they don\u2019t need the calories from either.\n\nIf we think that this is the way forward to solve the problem of \u201cmore than 4 billion that people live on less than the equivalent of $5 a day\u201d, I am sorry to say that it is nothing but an emotional closure of the temporary guilt that we feel and ask for the \u201cdoggy pack\u201d when we are eating a lavish dinner discussing how hard it is to maintain weight, while a hungry kid stands staring at us through the restaurant window.", "description": "As the conversation is building around the \u201cNobel\u201d prize for economics (and will quickly be set aside when Mandir judgement is out), I want to use this small window of attention to take up the...", "authors": ["Samir Shukla"], "top_image": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/11.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
