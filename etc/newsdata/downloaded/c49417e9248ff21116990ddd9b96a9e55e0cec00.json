Testifying Thursday about the whistleblower allegation that President Trump pushed Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 election, acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire called election security his \u201cmost fundamental priority.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTerwilliger said he had heard from an administration official that \u201ctheir big concern is deepfakes,\u201d or doctored images and videos. But he said he was also worried about the \u201cactual physical infrastructure\u201d of election machines, while cautioning that the issue was outside his purview.\n\nWith the \u201ccomplete decline of ISIS and the caliphate,\u201d Terwilliger said his office is \u201cfocused a lot more on state-sponsored cyberattacks.\u201d\n\nHis office charged a Russian accountant with involvement in funding disinformation campaigns in 2018. Though Terwilliger said it\u2019s \u201cunlikely\u201d she will ever be extradited, he argued that \u201cwe had to tell people this was happening.\u201d If his office were to have a similar case in the run-up to the next election, he said he would \u201cpush . . . to get that information to the public.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTerwilliger declined to say he believed Russia would again be intervening on Trump\u2019s behalf, insisting it was too early to say \u201cif they\u2019ve calculated who would be a better president for their interests.\u201d\n\nHe also suggested that some of the anger directed at his office for prosecuting Edward Snowden and Julian Assange, as well as trying to compel Chelsea Manning to testify before a grand jury, was sparked by Russia.\n\n\u201cWhen I see that comment level get up into the couple hundred thousands, I have to imagine it\u2019s some of the same stuff,\u201d he said, citing media coverage of the cases. \u201cPeople are just trying to fan the flames.\u201d\n\nTerwilliger obliquely defended the Assange and Snowden cases, both of which involve leaks of classified information. While he said he couldn\u2019t talk about the individual cases, \u201cit actually isn\u2019t that complex \u2014 if it\u2019s somebody who is in a position of trust who signed a nondisclosure agreement and got that information and then unilaterally made the decision to leak it, to me that\u2019s not a tough one.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nReferencing the whistleblower complaint made public Thursday, he said, \u201cwe\u2019re learning a lot about today about what this whistleblower process looks like . . . there are people on both sides of the aisle who will gladly take this information.\u201d\n\nAs for WikiLeaks founder Assange, Terwilliger sought to distinguish his actions from those of traditional journalists.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a huge difference between somebody who simply gets information, is given information . . . and then writes about it versus somebody who is complicit in its theft . . . sophisticated enough . . . to know what they have and put it out there, who put people in harm\u2019s way,\u201d he said.\n\nBy contrast, he suggested a \u201clisticle by BuzzFeed\u201d in which \u201cnobody knew\u201d the sensitivity of the information would be treated differently.\n\n\u201cI do think the public has a right to know to some extent, but the public does not have a right to know because you as an individual unilaterally decided to share the information,\u201d he added.\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news\n\nAD", "description": "\u201cThey\u2019re going to do the same thing,\u201d the federal prosecutor said.", "authors": ["Rachel Weiner", "Local Reporter Covering Federal Court In Alexandria", "Va.", "Local Court In Arlington"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/LjBijI5iS3mYMc5pzYi3npMz41M=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OROPIZHARQI6TDOIJGHKXQJJUA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
