The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the subpoena or Volker\u2019s resignation.\n\nThe committees announced the subpoena after the Trump administration missed a Thursday deadline to provide documents and information about contacts with Ukrainian officials, as well as a July 25 telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\n\nThat call is central to the impeachment investigation that Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the Democratic-led House of Representatives, announced this week.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry has cast a new pall over Trump\u2019s presidency just months after he emerged from the shadow cast by Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into whether he colluded with Russia in the 2016 election.\n\nTrump has reacted furiously, arguing he did nothing wrong, and accusing Democrats of launching a politically motivated \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\nMore than 300 former national security officials from both Republican and Democratic administrations on Friday endorsed the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry, saying they did not prejudge the outcome but wanted to know more facts.\n\nTRUMP DOUBLES DOWN WITH AD\n\nAs the subpoena was announced, Trump\u2019s re-election campaign said it would spend $10 million next week airing an ad called \u201cBiden corruption\u201d on television and websites that accuses Democrats of playing politics with the impeachment investigation.\n\nThe White House this week released a summary of Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call where he asked Zelenskiy to investigate his Democratic rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden ahead of the November 2020 presidential election - a call at the heart of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint.\n\nHunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company called Burisma when Biden was in office. There has been no evidence that the former vice president used his position to help his son in the Ukraine matter.\n\nUkraine\u2019s anti-corruption investigation agency said on Friday it was investigating permits given to companies managed by Burisma during 2010-2012. Hunter Biden was hired in 2014. The agency said it would only go further if compelling new testimony emerged.\n\nThe whistleblower raised concerns about interactions that Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudolph Giuliani - who has promoted theories about Biden\u2019s activities in Ukraine - had with former and current Ukrainian officials.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) speaks during a news conference on lowering drug costs, at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, U.S., September 25, 2019. REUTERS/Al Drago/File Photo\n\nThe complaint raised questions about Giuliani\u2019s role in the early recall of Marie Yovanovitch, who was the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. The whistleblower said Volker and Gordon Sondland, U.S. ambassador to the European Union, worked to try to \u201ccontain the damage\u201d from Giuliani\u2019s travels and meetings.\n\nThe House Democratic committees said they had scheduled depositions for Yovanovitch, Volker and Sondland during the next two weeks, as well T. Ulrich Brechbuhl - a State Department aide who the whistleblower said had listened in on Trump\u2019s call with Zelenskiy.\n\nThe committees also said it had scheduled a deposition with State Department Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent, who oversees Ukraine policy. Kent was Deputy Chief of Mission at the U.S. Embassy in Kiev from 2015 to 2018, and worked on anti-corruption policy in the region before that time.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Democrats are debating the merits of summoning Giuliani, a source familiar with deliberations said.\n\nOn Oct. 4, the committee also will hear closed-door testimony from the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general Michael Atkinson, who had determined that the whistleblower\u2019s report was credible.\n\nMILITARY AID\n\nA week before his call with Zelenskiy, Trump had ordered $400 million in military aid and foreign assistance for Ukraine to be put on hold a week before the call, and lifted the freeze earlier this month.\n\nTrump denies he pressured Zelenskiy to do anything improper and said he was not using the aid as leverage, but wanted to make sure Ukraine was taking steps to address corruption.\n\nDefence Secretary Mark Esper said on Friday the freeze in aid to Ukraine had no impact on U.S. national security.\n\n\u201cAt this point most of the money is out the door,\u201d Esper told reporters.\n\nEsper said the Pentagon would provide whatever information it could to Congress about the incident. On Friday, the Pentagon\u2019s inspector general - an internal watchdog - said it was reviewing a request from Democratic Senator Dick Durbin to investigate the hold.\n\nDemocratic leaders of two House committees asked the White House Office of Management and Budget on Friday for a long list of written details and documents by Oct. 1 about the decision to withhold the aid, saying they were concerned the delay was an abuse of executive branch authority.\n\nA spokeswoman for the OMB said the office acted within its bounds. \u201cOMB has clear legal authorities to help ensure that agencies spend funds consistent with the law and the president\u2019s priorities, and all actions taken under this administration were clearly within those authorities,\u201d Rachel Semmel said.\n\nWhite House officials also defended the handling of records of the Trump-Zelenskiy call on Friday after the whistleblower complaint described how an electronic record had been moved from the computer server where such records are normally kept to one reserved for highly classified intelligence matters.\n\nWhite House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway told reporters that procedures for handling records of Trump\u2019s conversations with world leaders had changed early in his tenure.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\n\u201cEarly on in our time here, his calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia leaked and then his conversation with the Russian ambassador ... leaked,\u201d Conway said.\n\n\u201cMy understanding is we changed some of the protocols then, in other words, in handling leader calls.\u201d", "description": "Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives who are pursuing an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump forged ahead with their probe on Friday, issuing a subpoena to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for documents concerning contact with the Ukrainian government.", "authors": ["Patricia Zengerle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434599453&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q16L", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
