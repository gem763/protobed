Abe responded by saying that the two countries \"should continue to talk.\"\n\nThey also agreed on the importance of bilateral and trilateral cooperation involving the U.S. in dealing with North Korea.\n\nHowever, Lee and Abe did not see eye to eye over the issue of compensation for Korean victims of forced labor during World War II, which sparked the spat between the two neighbors, and again reiterated their respective positions and differences.\n\nSeoul remains of the opinion that the government cannot interfere in judicial rulings here, while Tokyo insists that all compensation claims were settled under lump sum reparations in 1965.\n\nLee also proposed a summit with President Moon Jae-in, but Abe stayed mum. Lee presented Abe with a personal letter from Moon before the meeting ended.", "description": "PM Agrees with Abe on Need to Improve Bilateral Relations", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/25/2019102500907_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
