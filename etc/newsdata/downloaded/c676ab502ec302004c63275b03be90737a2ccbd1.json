Now, not only can you lease an Xbox One console from Amazon, but you also have the option to upgrade to the mysterious Project Scarlett console when it eventually comes out next year.\n\nAll Access is essentially an easier way to buy an Xbox, paying for it monthly installments until you\u2019ve paid it off while still using it \u2014 no dropping hundreds you might not have all at once. Microsoft today announced it was \u201crelaunching\u201d All Access in more countries, including the US, UK, and Australia. When you buy one, you get an Xbox One and a two-year subscription to Xbox Game Pass. You can get an Xbox One X, One S, or One S Digital if you\u2019re in the UK or US (Australia players have the option to get a One X or One S with Forza Horizon 4 bundles).\n\nBack when All Access was first announced, I said that the likely purpose behind it was a last-ditch effort to eke more sales out of the Xbox One, as well as cultivate a little brand loyalty before Project Scarlett came out. Turns out I was right in a more literal sense than I could have known.\n\nTo sweeten the pot and get more buyers on board, Microsoft is now offering the option to upgrade to a Project Scarlett console when it eventually comes out. The still-somewhat-mysterious next-gen console is set to launch in Holiday 2020. Jeff Gattis, Microsoft\u2019s GM of Platform and Device Marketing, even admits in the announcement that the company\u2019s deliberately trying to tempt those staying on the fence until the next-gen consoles launch:\n\nWe realize buying a console is an investment and some players are waiting to make the jump to the next generation with Project Scarlett when it launches in Holiday 2020 alongside \u201cHalo Infinite\u201d. This is why as a limited time offer this holiday season, players in the U.S. and U.K. who purchase an Xbox One X with Xbox All Access through December 31, 2019, have the option to upgrade to the next Xbox console in as few as 12 months and once Project Scarlett has officially launched.\n\nAs he mentioned, this appears to be limited to American and UK users, and you must qualify with Microsoft\u2019s financing partner (which, though they don\u2019t directly say it, I\u2019m assuming means a credit check).\n\nThis iteration of All Access also fixes one of the major caveats before \u2014 namely, when it was originally announced, you could only participate by going to one of Microsoft\u2019s physical locations. Because there are several states in the US alone where there are no Microsoft stores, that made it untenable for a large number of people.\n\nNow, according to Microsoft, the deal is available through \u201cselect consoles and retailers.\u201d For US users, this includes an online option from Amazon, while UK and Australian users can get their consoles at GAME and Telstra, respectively. It\u2019s nice to finally have some options.\n\nPurchase an Xbox One with Xbox All Access for No Upfront Cost; Special Upgrade Offer Available for a Limited Time on Xbox Wire", "description": "", "authors": ["Rachel Kaser"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2017%2F06%2FXbox-One-X.jpg&signature=51f22ddab9ff8e09ab8803db98bd138d", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
