Defensive back Tino Ellis was the culprit in both instances, called first for pass interference and then for holding, but the entire team had fallen victim to self-inflicted setbacks.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe program had a bye week after the Temple loss to pinpoint and solve those issues, but they resurfaced against Penn State last weekend, leaving Coach Michael Locksley hoping yet again his team will be less error-prone when it plays Saturday at Rutgers.\n\n\u201cWe need to get it straight quickly,\u201d Locksley said earlier this week. \u201cOur guys, we talk about it all the time. Discipline will precede winning. Part of discipline is not beating yourself.\u201d\n\nMaryland readies for Rutgers knowing the threat of a team with nothing to lose\n\nDespite two solid outings to open the season \u2014 reflected both in the games\u2019 outcomes and the much shorter list of undisciplined moments \u2014 such problems plagued Maryland when it began conference play against Penn State. The Terps turned the ball over three times, and Penn State scored a touchdown on each ensuing drive. Locksley said the staff found that 22 percent of the offensive plays included a \u201cself-inflicted error,\u201d such as a penalty, turnover, dropped pass or sack. The team missed 17 tackles. Previously, Maryland had missed no more than seven in a game. The offensive line allowed four sacks.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe're already playing the No. 12 team in the country,\u201d Locksley said. \u201cI don't think they need help with being able to beat us the way they did.\u201d\n\nWould solutions to these problems have changed the outcome against Penn State? That\u2019s doubtful. Consider KJ Hamler\u2019s impressive 58-yard touchdown catch. Yes, Maryland missed multiple tackles on that play, but that\u2019s also a testament to Hamler\u2019s speed and skill. While the Terps\u2019 mistakes helped, Penn State did plenty to earn that 59-0 result, which served a stark reminder of the wide gap that still separates Maryland from the Big Ten\u2019s top programs.\n\nBut since it all unraveled so early, the Terps watched a game suddenly slip out of hand. Two of Maryland\u2019s first three drives ended with interceptions. Only 10 of Maryland\u2019s offensive plays began inside the 50-yard line. Nine of those came on the opening drive, which ended with a pick; the other came in the final quarter on a fourth-down attempt from the 48 and resulted in a sack. Meanwhile, the Nittany Lions needed just four snaps to score their first two touchdowns.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAs a team, that\u2019s probably the most disappointing part of this game is how we beat ourselves in the first half,\u201d offensive lineman Ellis McKennie said after the loss. \u201c \u2026 We were moving the ball. We beat ourselves and that\u2019s something we\u2019re going to have to figure out as a team: How do we get more disciplined? How do we not beat ourselves early in games to give ourselves a shot?\u201d\n\nThe game against Penn State, regardless of the outcome, could have offered signs that the Temple miscues wouldn\u2019t persist. Instead, it became obvious Maryland needs to correct the issues before they establish themselves as a troubling trend. Against Rutgers, an already struggling team playing under an interim coach after the recent firing of Chris Ash, Maryland should have more of a cushion. But a relatively clean performance would still provide reassurance that this team can assess mistakes and quickly adjust.\n\nLocksley placed the onus on himself. A typical option would be swapping players who made the errors. But with the way Maryland has racked up injuries in recent weeks, the staff will primarily need to guide the usual contributors toward better play.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMaryland finished last season as one of the most penalized teams in the nation running Matt Canada\u2019s motion-based offense. The Terps averaged about 80 penalty yards per game, second-most out of 130 FBS teams. But through the first two games of 2019, Maryland only lost 75 total yards through penalties. Those marks shot upward in the two matchups that followed \u2014 a total of 18 flags for 173 yards.\n\nSince he became Maryland\u2019s coach, Locksley has preached the importance of discipline. He carries that over from three years at Alabama but also credits former Terps coach Ralph Friedgen for that philosophy. During Friedgen\u2019s interview process in 2000 for the head coaching job at Maryland, a process Locksley was part of as a holdover from the previous staff, a player asked Friedgen how he\u2019d help the team win. Friedgen said he would teach Maryland\u2019s players how not to lose, meaning they\u2019d learn to avoid these self-inflicted struggles.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the big things that Coach Locks harps on,\u201d linebacker Shaq Smith said. \u201cWe want to be the least penalized team in the game. Majority of the penalties that we had in [the Temple game] were penalties that we can control \u2014 offsides and unsportsmanlike [conduct], things like that.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLocksley and Penn State's Franklin are joined at the roots\n\nThe Maryland players have noticed a change this season, which they believe should translate to the field. At practice, \u201cyou don\u2019t see anybody\u2019s T-shirt hanging out,\u201d receiver Brian Cobbs said, describing the uniform practice attire known as \u201cplain Jane.\u201d\n\nFor the first two weeks of the season, it worked. So these players know it\u2019s possible to play this way. Now it\u2019s a matter of rediscovering the discipline that\u2019s been missing.\n\nWith Ellis\u2019s mistakes against Temple, Locksley saw the defensive back in the right position but said he just needs to relax and not panic. When Maryland could have seized some life early in the Penn State game, quarterback Josh Jackson had an open receiver. He just missed the play and threw an interception instead. To Locksley, the issues are evident. But so are the opportunities for simple fixes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThose are things that are all teachable,\u201d Locksley said. \u201cThose are all correctable.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nWhen Navy takes on Air Force, Malcolm Perry will try to keep the hits from coming\n\nLorenzo Harrison III to have knee surgery, further depleting Terps\u2019 running back corps\n\nTerps basketball, deeper and more experienced, expects a longer March run this season\n\nThe Kyle Trask Story: Six years as a backup QB, then a Hollywood debut for Florida\n\nAt Tennessee, how bad can it get?
