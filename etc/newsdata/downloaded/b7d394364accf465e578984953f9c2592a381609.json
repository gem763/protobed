The company first introduced the Levorg at the 2013 Tokyo auto show. Its name was derived from the words Legacy, Revolution, and Touring, but don't ask us to how the marketing people made sense of that one. Since then, the Levorg has lived as the longroof version of the last-generation Impreza and the current WRX\u2014exclusively sold overseas, of course.\n\nWhile it's disappointing that America misses out on another enthusiast-oriented station wagon, the all-new Levorg should provide some clues about what to expect from future U.S.-bound Subaru models, especially the highly anticipated next-gen WRX. Most notably, the Levorg now rides on the Subaru Global Platform, which currently underpins the Impreza as well as several other, newer Subaru models. Since the WRX still sits on an obsolete architecture, it's only a matter of time until that transition happens. When it does, we hope it includes the Levorg's bold design language.\n\nClearly drawing inspiration from its Viziv Tourer wagon and Viziv Adrenaline concepts, Subaru appropriately tones down their aggressive aesthetics for production while still making the Levorg look mean as hell. Its hexagonal grille bears the company's iconic Pleiades star cluster and is outlined by an angular surround that protrudes into a pair of recognizable headlights. Its attention-grabbing face also features a prominent hood scoop and menacing lower fascia that flow into boxed front fenders and more gently folded side surfacing. The Levorg's rear-three-quarter view reveals bulging fenders and a hard shoulder line that meets a raked rear window, which in turn is stacked above a pumped-up bumper complete with dual exhaust tips.\n\nPhoto credit: Subaru More\n\nSubaru hasn't divulged many specific details, but it has confirmed that the upcoming Levorg will be powered by a newly developed four-cylinder engine. Following tradition, this new turbocharged 1.8-liter mill will continue to be a horizontally opposed flat-four\u2014also known as a boxer. With direct injection and fuel-saving technology, Subaru says the torquey four will balance acceleration and efficiency. The company didn't mention what transmission will feed its standard all-wheel-drive system, but a continuously variable automatic (CVT) was the only gearbox available on the outgoing Levorg.", "description": "The Levorg's chiseled looks and updated technology could reach our shores on other Subaru models, but, sadly, probably not in this form.", "authors": ["Eric Stafford"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/zlbpZOsHeLBydGNCIRLiHA--~B/aD03MjE7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/car_and_driver_581/166f497c31eb3b5efa95799b8502541c", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
