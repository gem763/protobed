If that happens without a divorce agreement to smooth trade, it could disrupt business dealings between the U.K. and the 27 remaining members. Europe\u2019s trade-focused industries are facing further turmoil from the U.S.-China trade conflict. U.S. President Donald Trump has imposed tariffs on Chinese goods as he seeks to overhaul trade relations with Beijing; uncertainty over tariffs has sideswiped the 19-country eurozone as businesses delay investments and new orders.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Its policies have wide-ranging impact on inflation, employment, business borrowing costs and the prices of assets such as stocks, bonds, currencies and real estate. The ECB\u2019s ability to act swiftly set it apart from European Union leaders as the eurozone economy\u2019s first line of defense during the debt crisis.\n\nLagarde said she would aim to communicate clearly with the public to explain the bank\u2019s decisions. She said that while \u201cfinancial market operators\u201d were likely to understand the ECB\u2019s message on monetary issues \u201cI want the people of the euro area to understand why decisions are being made.\u201d\n\nLagarde is not an economist, although she is versed in finance after serving as French finance minister and head of the IMF. She said that at the IMF she had asked staff to improve communication by not using confusing acronyms.\n\nShe praised the \u201cagility\u201d that led the bank under Draghi to come up with new tools to confront the crisis over heavily indebted governments and then a period of low inflation that threatened to lead to chronic economic stagnation. Those unusual tools have included a negative interest rate for deposits from banks \u2013 to push them to lend the money instead of leaving it at the ECB \u2013 and a promise to purchase the bonds of countries facing excessive borrowing costs.\n\nSome of those tools have faced criticism, in particular from German news media and politicians. Some critics say they have led to low returns for savers and that stimulus has reduced the incentive to reform financially shaky governments. Draghi\u2019s announcement of the bond-purchase promise in 2012 is credited with defusing the debt crisis, so much so that the backstop was never actually used.\n\nThe hearing preceded a vote by the full parliament on the nomination, though the parliament cannot block the nomination. In 2012 they voted against the appointment of Yves Mersch to the ECB\u2019s top executive board to underline their displeasure at the lack of female candidates for top ECB posts. The eurozone leaders made the appointment anyway.\n\nAnalysts say the ECB could add new stimulus measures at its Sept. 12 meeting. Lagarde said she could not comment on the upcoming meeting since she\u2019s not in office yet.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Incoming European Central Bank head Christine Lagarde defended the bank's record low rates amid economic troubles from trade wars and Brexit", "authors": ["David Mchugh"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/christine-lagarde-ecb-low-rates.jpg?quality=85&crop=0px%2C0px%2C1024px%2C536px&resize=1200%2C628&strip"}
