Ted Cruz (R-TX) is on a roll in his defense of the Second Amendment, first taking on actress Alyssa Milano, then turning his attention to Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot.\n\nHis exchange with Lightfoot came after the mayor took issue with him pointing to Chicago as an example of gun control not working.\n\nLightfoot argued that a majority of the illegal firearms recovered from the city come from out of state\u2014those \u201cdominated by coward Republicans like you who refuse to enact commonsense gun legislation.\u201d She then called on him to \u201ckeep our name out of your mouth.\u201d\n\nIn a series of tweets, Cruz then pointed out why her \u201canger is misplaced.\u201d\n\n1/x Mayor, your anger is misplaced. Virtually every year, Chicago has the most murders of any city in America. In 2017, the top five were: Chicago (650 murders), Baltimore (343), Philadelphia (317), New York (290), and Los Angeles (286). https://t.co/JYsaYcxgSF https://t.co/wcFc4MflzV \u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) September 3, 2019\n\n2/x All five of those cities have had Democratic mayors for decades and aggressive gun control policies\u2014none seems to be working. Your explanation (\u201cblame Indiana!\u201d) doesn\u2019t hold water. There are 27 states with GOP governors. Chicago is not alone in having neighboring red states. \u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) September 3, 2019\n\n3/x But Chicago\u2019s murder totals are often DOUBLE the next closest city. So how do you explain the big cities in red states, without aggressive gun control laws, where murder rates are MUCH lower than Chicago? \u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) September 3, 2019\n\n4/x Maybe, rather than getting angry when others point out the tragically high murder rate in Chicago, you put aside the partisan talking points & the failed gun-control policies Chicago has pursued for decades. Instead, lock up the violent criminals who are committing murder... \u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) September 3, 2019\n\n5/x ...PREVENT felons & fugitives from illegally buying firearms, and ALLOW law-abiding citizens (who are right now obeying Chicago\u2019s prohibition) to exercise their constitutional right to protect their own lives and their families. \u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) September 3, 2019\n\nHe then retweeted a post by talk show host Joe Pags noting that Lightfoot has completely missed the point.", "description": "Cruz is on a roll. .10/02/2019 12:51:11PM EST.", "authors": ["Leah Barkoukis", "Katie Pavlich", "Cortney O'Brien", "Julio Rosas", "Guy Benson", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/309/7028a400-2c21-4644-996f-326db1c51727.jpg"}
