There are potholes all over the place.\n\nWhat\u2019s happened to this point is an audition, nothing more. If you want to look at a list of scoring leaders, you can find that elsewhere.\n\nAssume a half-point PPR scoring format. Perhaps it\u2019s not the industry standard yet, but it is at Yahoo and I think we\u2019re going there across the board.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n[Play in Yahoo\u2019s NFL $250K Baller. $10 entry fee and $25K to first place]\n\nPlease don\u2019t get hung up on the exact prices, anyway. What matters most here is how the players relate to one another, where the talent clusters and where the talent drops off. Players at the same price are considered even.\n\nDon\u2019t get hung up on the tier names or where the divisions are. We like to break up the copy.\n\nEvery-Week Answers\n\n$34 Travis Kelce\n\n$31 George Kittle\n\n$29 Zach Ertz\n\n$29 Austin Hooper\n\n$26 Mark Andrews\n\n$26 Hunter Henry\n\n$24 Evan Engram\n\n$22 Darren Waller\n\nHooper\u2019s set-up couldn\u2019t be much better. He\u2019s in his fourth season and there\u2019s always been linear improvement in his game. Matt Ryan trusts him in all spots. Every opponent walks on the field focused on stopping Julio Jones, not Hooper. And the Falcons have always made Hooper a priority in the red-area; his two-point usage before 2019 suggested latent touchdown upside that\u2019s cashing in now.\n\nIt takes a village to tackle Austin Hooper.

Ryan and friends are in weekly high-scoring affairs, chasing the game. The volume is safe. Atlanta\u2019s rushing game hasn\u2019t been consistent. Hooper looked like a solid-but-boring value pick in the summer, but now he has the tint of a league-winner.\n\nStory continues\n\nKelce doesn\u2019t need much to validate his cost, just some touchdown regression. The return of Tyreek Hill can only help . . . As wonderful as Kittle is, he\u2019s still scored a modest six touchdowns in his last 21 games. He\u2019s also been a lot less explosive this year, losing almost five yards per catch from last season\u2019s record-smashing return. This is all nit-picking; he\u2019d be welcome on any of my teams . . . My only concerns with Henry and Engram are health-related. The Chargers pushed Henry into a hybrid-receiver role last week, and he smashed in his first game back. They need him and they\u2019re going to use him plenty. The Giants also realize the importance of not making Engram take out the trash.\n\nPlausible Upside\n\n$14 Greg Olsen\n\n$13 T.J. Hockenson\n\n$11 Jason Witten\n\n$11 Delanie Walker\n\n$10 Eric Ebron\n\n$9 *Chris Herndon\n\n$9 Gerald Everett\n\nThe connections don\u2019t always work, but the Lions are trying to get Hockenson going in the red area. He\u2019s going to be a star someday, and he should be startable for the rest of 2019 . . . I would prefer not to rank Herndon at all, the injury optimism rules and what-not. Healthy, he\u2019s a high-teens guy. Right now, he\u2019s a zero. You decide how you want to spin it. I\u2019m still holding a handful of shares . . . Witten is a catch-and-fall guy now with not much upside, but he always does something. Targets by week: 4-4-4-4-4-7 . . . Everett has some pedigree as a second-round pick, and he looked like a monster for two weeks before nothing last Sunday. He\u2019s still an interesting upside guy to bet on.\n\nBest stuff that\u2019s readily available\n\n$7 Jimmy Graham\n\n$6 Jared Cook\n\n$5 Jack Doyle\n\n$5 Vance McDonald\n\n$5 O.J. Howard\n\n$5 Darren Fells\n\n$4 Dawson Knox\n\n$3 Noah Fant\n\n$3 Ricky Seals-Jones\n\n$3 Luke Willson\n\n,\n\nI still don\u2019t see much with Graham at this stage of his career, but the Packers keep skimming targets his way . . . Knox and Fant are guys I\u2019m eager to play in 2020 and 2021, but rookie expectations have to be managed . . . Fells is tied to a star quarterback and his snaps and usage keep nudging forward. You certainly could do worse. If nothing else, let\u2019s acknowledge that he deserves to be ahead of Akins . . . I don\u2019t know who to blame in Tampa Bay for the Howard disconnect, but it\u2019s been six weeks and we have to trust what we\u2019ve seen. If it were easy to fix, it would be fixed by now. I\u2019m just as frustrated as you are . . . Willson knows his way around the Seattle locker room and is now needed with Will Dissly hurt. Exposure to Russell Wilson justifies a lottery ticket . . . I\u2019d probably have RSJ a couple of bucks higher if not for the Freddie Kitchens disaster . . . You haven\u2019t really played fantasy football until you\u2019ve been let down by Jared Cook.
