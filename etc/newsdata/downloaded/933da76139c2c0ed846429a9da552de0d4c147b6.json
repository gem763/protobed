Davies -- Global stocks mixed after tricky quarter -- Hong Kong stocks set for worst quarter since 2015 -- Brent crude drops 1.2%\n\nGlobal markets were mixed Monday at the end of a volatile third quarter in which investors faced attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil industry, unrest in Hong Kong and a spike in a critical U.S. overnight lending rate.\n\nThe biggest move among major stock markets was Shanghai, which slipped 0.9% despite manufacturing numbers that were better than expected. Official data showed manufacturing activity rebounded in September mainly on improving domestic demand. Chinese stock markets will be closed for the rest of the week to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.\n\nThe Japanese Nikkei 225 was down 0.6% Monday, but closes out the quarter as one of the better performers, up 2.3%. The Stoxx Europe 600 was up 0.1% Monday and the FTSE 100 in London was 0.15% lower. U.S. futures were up 0.3%.\n\nWhile the Chinese data was a positive surprise, the trend still points toward a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy. Weaker manufacturing and export data globally has been the story of the quarter, although employment and consumer spending has remained resilient. Still, the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank have begun new rounds of looser monetary policy, supporting stock markets.\n\nGovernment bond yields in the U.S. and Europe tumbled in August before rising sharply again in early September, while some currencies have also seen big moves. The Chinese yuan has dropped nearly 4% against the dollar, its weakest run since the second quarter of 2018.\n\nMonday's Chinese manufacturing data was \"encouraging, given the tighter industrial production restrictions ahead of the 70th Anniversary Celebration for environmental concerns,\" Citigroup economist Xiangrong Yu wrote in a note.\n\nStocks in Hong Kong meanwhile rose 0.5% Monday after another weekend of major pro-democracy protests. The Hang Seng has been one of the worst performing of the world's major indexes in the past three months, down nearly 9%, since the protests took a more violent turn in late July.\n\nA big positive was a strong debut in Hong Kong for the newly listed shares of Budweiser Brewing Co. APAC, the Asia business of European beer giant Anheuser Busch InBev. The stock climbed 4.4% above its initial public offering price. Budweiser had raised $5 billion in Asia's largest IPO this year and the funds will go toward reducing AB InBev's debt.\n\nThere was also a strong debut on Shanghai's Nasdaq-style Science and Technology Innovation Board for shares of Shenzhen Transsion Holdings Co., a Chinese mobile-phone maker known for its dominance in Africa. These closed 64.4% above their IPO price. The handset producer had raised about $394 million in its IPO.\n\nBrent crude oil was down 1.2% Monday at $60.32 even though there are several factors threatening to restrict supplies. Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said in an interview with \"60 Minutes\" broadcast Sunday that energy prices could hit unimaginable highs if a conflict with Iran escalated.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal also reported that the U.S. shale boom was slowing, with production growth of just 1% in the first six months of 2019.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York is due to conduct another overnight lending operation for banks Monday to help keep market interest rates in check over the tricky quarter end when funding markets tend to be restricted.\n\nThe Fed began to support repo markets, where banks and investors swap U.S. Treasurys and other safe bonds for cash, nearly two weeks ago after lending rates rose sharply. It currently has nearly $162 billion out on loan to banks in a mix of overnight and 14-day repo operations. About $23 billion will be repaid this morning and the New York Fed is offering up to another $100 billion in overnight money.\n\nElsewhere German 10-year bond yields were 0.1 percentage points higher at minus 0.563%, while French 10-year yields were 0.1 points higher at minus 0.269%. In the U.S. 10-year Treasury yields were 0.02 percentage points higher at 1.698%.\n\nGold was also lower, down 0.8% $1494.00. The WSJ dollar index was up 0.1%.\n\nWrite to Paul J.
