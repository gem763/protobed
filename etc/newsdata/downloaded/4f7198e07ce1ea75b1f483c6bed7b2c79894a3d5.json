(angela n./Flickr)\n\nBelieve it or not, our average high is now in the upper 60s, so today\u2019s area-wide 70s were on the warm side. Still, it\u2019s hard to complain given the wall-to-wall sunshine, lack of humidity and general pleasantness of the situation. We still need rain, and there\u2019s a chance for some by midweek. Until then, we have more autumnal bliss.\n\nListen to our daily D.C. forecasts: Apple Podcasts | Amazon Echo | More options\n\nThrough Tonight: High pressure will continue to settle into the region. This means we\u2019ll have clear skies and a quick loss of daytime warmth with sunset. It will be a bit chilly overnight, as lows range from the low 40s to around 50.\n\nView the current weather at The Washington Post.\n\nTomorrow (Tuesday): There won\u2019t be much change compared to today. We\u2019ll be a little deeper into fresh cool air, so it might end up slightly cooler, despite mostly sunny skies. Highs will be mainly near 70 and into the low 70s. Winds will turn to come from the south and southeast during the day, around 5 to 10 mph.\n\nSee Jason Samenow\u2019s forecast through the weekend.

With an elevation over 3,000 feet, the valley is surrounded by taller mountains. The combination of high elevation and sheltered valley creates quite a short growing season and very cold nights. This morning, it got down to 17.6 degrees there! It wouldn\u2019t be too shocking if that area sees some snowflakes at the tail end of the midweek storm system, either.\n\nCanaan Valley #WV has an amazing micro-climate. As a high mountain valley, they maximize cold air drainage overnight. Last night they dropped to 17.6F at 5:40 am. #frigid pic.twitter.com/LiaRiHVnVN \u2014 Tom Niziol (@TomNiziol) October 14, 2019\n\nWant our 5 a.m. forecast delivered to your email inbox?
