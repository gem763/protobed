It\u2019s a sweltering September afternoon in Anderson, Indiana, and the vice president has returned to his home state to deliver the Good News of the Republicans\u2019 recently unveiled tax plan. The visit is a big deal for Anderson, a fading manufacturing hub about 20 miles outside Muncie that hasn\u2019t hosted a sitting president or vice president in 65 years\u2014a fact noted by several warm-up speakers. To mark this historic civic occasion, the cavernous factory where the event is being held has been transformed. Idle machinery has been shoved to the perimeter to make room for risers and cameras and a gargantuan American flag, which\u2014along with bleachers full of constituents carefully selected for their ethnic diversity and ability to stay awake during speeches about tax policy\u2014will serve as the TV-ready backdrop for Pence\u2019s remarks. To hear more feature stories, see our full list or get the Audm iPhone app.\n\nWhen the time comes, Pence takes the stage and greets the crowd with a booming \u201cHellooooo, Indiana!\u201d He says he has \u201cjust hung up the phone\u201d with Donald Trump and that the president asked him to \u201csay hello.\u201d He delivers this message with a slight chuckle that has a certain, almost subversive quality to it. Watch Pence give enough speeches, and you\u2019ll notice that this often happens when he\u2019s in front of a friendly crowd. He\u2019ll be witnessing to evangelicals at a mega-church, or addressing conservative supporters at a rally, and when the moment comes for him to pass along the president\u2019s well-wishes, the words are invariably accompanied by an amused little chuckle that prompts knowing laughter from the attendees. It\u2019s almost as if, in that brief, barely perceptible moment, Pence is sending a message to those with ears to hear\u2014that he recognizes the absurdity of his situation; that he knows just what sort of man he\u2019s working for; that while things may look bad now, there is a grand purpose at work here, a plan that will manifest itself in due time. Let not your hearts be troubled, he seems to be saying. I\u2019ve got this. And then, all at once, Pence is back on message. In his folksy Midwestern drawl, he recites Republican aphorisms about \u201cjob creators\u201d and regulatory \u201cred tape,\u201d and heralds the many supposed triumphs of Trump\u2019s young presidency. As he nears the end of his remarks, his happy-warrior buoyancy gives way to a more sober cadence. \u201cWe\u2019ve come to a pivotal moment in the life of this country,\u201d Pence soulfully intones. \u201cIt\u2019s a good time to pray for America.\u201d His voice rising in righteous fervor, the vice president promises an opening of the heavens. \u201cIf His people who are called by His name will humble themselves and pray,\u201d he proclaims, \u201cHe\u2019ll hear from heaven, and He\u2019ll heal this land!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see how Pence could put so much faith in the possibilities of divine intervention. The very fact that he is standing behind a lectern bearing the vice-presidential seal is, one could argue, a loaves-and-fishes-level miracle. Just a year earlier, he was an embattled small-state governor with underwater approval ratings, dismal reelection prospects, and a national reputation in tatters. In many ways, Pence was on the same doomed trajectory as the conservative-Christian movement he\u2019d long championed\u2014once a political force to be reckoned with, now a battered relic of the culture wars. Because God works in mysterious ways (or, at the very least, has a postmodern sense of humor), it was Donald J. Trump\u2014gracer of Playboy covers, delighter of shock jocks, collector of mistresses\u2014who descended from the mountaintop in the summer of 2016, GOP presidential nomination in hand, offering salvation to both Pence and the religious right. The question of whether they should wed themselves to such a man was not without its theological considerations. But after eight years of Barack Obama and a string of disorienting political defeats, conservative Christians were in retreat and out of options. So they placed their faith in Trump\u2014and then, incredibly, he won. In Pence, Trump has found an obedient deputy whose willingness to suffer indignity and humiliation at the pleasure of the president appears boundless. When Trump comes under fire for describing white nationalists as \u201cvery fine people,\u201d Pence is there to assure the world that he is actually a man of great decency. When Trump needs someone to fly across the country to an NFL game so he can walk out in protest of national-anthem kneelers, Pence heads for Air Force Two.\n\nMeanwhile, Pence\u2019s presence in the White House has been a boon for the religious right. Evangelical leaders across the country point to his record on abortion and religious freedom and liken him to a prophet restoring conservative Christianity to its rightful place at the center of American life. \u201cMike Pence is the 24-karat-gold model of what we want in an evangelical politician,\u201d Richard Land, the president of the Southern Evangelical Seminary and one of Trump\u2019s faith advisers, told me. \u201cI don\u2019t know anyone who\u2019s more consistent in bringing his evangelical-Christian worldview to public policy.\u201d But what does Pence make of his own improbable rise to the vice presidency, and how does he reconcile his faith with serving a man like Trump? Over the past several months, I\u2019ve spoken with dozens of people who have known the vice president throughout his life\u2014from college fraternity brothers and longtime friends to trusted advisers and political foes. (Pence himself declined my requests for an interview.) While many of them expressed surprise and even bewilderment at the heights of power Pence had attained, those who know him best said he sees no mystery in why he\u2019s in the White House. \u201cIf you\u2019re Mike Pence, and you believe what he believes, you know God had a plan,\u201d says Ralph Reed, an evangelical power broker and a friend of the vice president\u2019s. Pence has so far showed absolute deference to the president\u2014and as a result he has become one of the most influential figures in the White House, with a broad portfolio of responsibilities and an unprecedented level of autonomy. But for all his aw-shucks modesty, Pence is a man who believes heaven and Earth have conspired to place him a heartbeat\u2014or an impeachment vote\u2014away from the presidency. At some crucial juncture in the not-too-distant future, that could make him a threat to Trump.\n\nPence\u2019s public persona can seem straight out of the Columbus, Indiana, of his youth, a quiet suburb of Indianapolis where conformity was a virtue and old-fashioned values reigned. His dad ran a chain of convenience stores; his mom was a homemaker who took care of him and his five siblings. The Pences were devout Irish-Catholic Democrats, and Mike and his brothers served as altar boys at St. Columba Catholic Church. Pence was \u201ca fat little kid,\u201d he told a local newspaper, \u201cthe real pumpkin in the pickle patch.\u201d Young Mike did not initially thrive in this setting. He was useless at football (he later sized up his own abilities as \u201cone grade above the blocking sled\u201d), and he lacked the natural athleticism of his brothers, who were \u201clean and hard and thin.\u201d Pence was \u201ca fat little kid,\u201d he told a local newspaper in 1988, \u201cthe real pumpkin in the pickle patch.\u201d But by the time Pence arrived at Hanover College\u2014a small liberal-arts school in southern Indiana\u2014he had slimmed down, discovered a talent for public speaking, and developed something akin to swagger. The yearbooks from his undergraduate days are filled with photos that portray Pence as a kind of campus clich\u00e9: the dark-haired, square-jawed stud strumming an acoustic guitar on the quad as he leads a gaggle of coeds in a sing-along. In one picture, Pence mugs for the camera in a fortune-teller costume with a girl draped over his lap; in another, he poses goofily in an unbuttoned shirt that shows off his torso.\n\nPence wasn\u2019t a bad student, but he wasn\u2019t especially bookish either, managing a B-plus average amid a busy campus social life. As a freshman, he joined Phi Gamma Delta and became an enthusiastic participant in the Greek experience. Dan Murphy, a former fraternity brother of Pence\u2019s who now teaches history at Hanover, told me that the \u201cPhi Gams\u201d were an eclectic bunch. \u201cYou had in that fraternity house everything from the sort of evangelical-Christian crowd to some fairly hard-core drug users.\u201d Pence was friendly with all of them, and in his sophomore year was elected president of the fraternity. Murphy and Pence lived in neighboring rooms, and made a habit of attending Catholic Mass together on Sunday nights. On their walks back home, they often talked about their futures, and it became clear to Murphy that his friend had a much stronger sense of his \u201cmission in the world\u201d than the average undergrad. Pence agonized over his \u201ccalling.\u201d He talked about entering the priesthood, but ultimately felt drawn instead to politics, a realm where he believed he could harness God\u2019s power to do good. It was obvious to his fraternity brothers, Murphy told me, that Pence wanted to be president one day. Pence underwent two conversions in college that would shape the rest of his life. The first came in the spring of 1978, when he road-tripped to Kentucky with some evangelical friends for a music festival billed as the Christian Woodstock. After a day of rocking out to Jesus-loving prog-rock bands and born-again Bob Dylan imitators, Pence found himself sitting in a light rain, yearning for a more personal relationship with Christ than was afforded by the ritualized Catholicism of his youth. \u201cMy heart really, finally broke with a deep realization that what had happened on the cross in some infinitesimal way had happened for me,\u201d Pence recounted in March 2017. It was there, he said, that he gave his life to Jesus.\n\nThe other conversion was a partisan one. Pence had entered college a staunch supporter of Jimmy Carter, and he viewed the 1980 presidential election as a contest between a \u201cgood Christian\u201d and a \u201cvacuous movie star.\u201d But President Ronald Reagan won Pence over\u2014instilling in him an appreciation for both movement conservatism and the leadership potential of vacuous entertainers that would serve him well later in life. Murphy told me another story about Pence that has stayed with him. During their sophomore year, the Phi Gamma Delta house found itself perpetually on probation. The movie Animal House had recently come out, and the fraternity brothers were constantly re-creating their favorite scenes, with toga parties, outlandish pranks, and other miscellaneous mischief. Most vexing to the school\u2019s administration was their violation of Hanover\u2019s strict alcohol prohibition. The Phi Gams devised elaborate schemes to smuggle booze into the house, complete with a network of campus lookouts. Pence was not a particularly hard partyer, but he gamely presided over these efforts, and when things went sideways he was often called upon to smooth things over with the adults.\n\nOne night, during a rowdy party, Pence and his fraternity brothers got word that an associate dean was on his way to the house. They scrambled to hide the kegs and plastic cups, and then Pence met the administrator at the door.\n\n\u201cWe know you\u2019ve got a keg,\u201d the dean told Pence, according to Murphy. Typically when scenes like this played out, one of the brothers would take the fall, claiming that all the alcohol was his and thus sparing the house from formal discipline. Instead, Pence led the dean straight to the kegs and admitted that they belonged to the fraternity. The resulting punishment was severe. \u201cThey really raked us over the coals,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cThe whole house was locked down.\u201d Some of Pence\u2019s fraternity brothers were furious with him\u2014but he managed to stay on good terms with the administration. Such good terms, in fact, that after he graduated, in 1981, the school offered him a job in the admissions office. Decades later, when Murphy read about Pence vying for a spot on the presidential ticket with Donald Trump, he recognized a familiar quality in his old friend. \u201cSomewhere in the midst of all that genuine humility and good feeling, this is a guy who\u2019s got that ambition,\u201d Murphy told me. And he wondered, \u201cIs Mike\u2019s religiosity a way of justifying that ambition to himself?\u201d For all Pence\u2019s outward piousness, he\u2019s kept the details of his spiritual journey opaque. Despite his conversion to evangelical Christianity in college, he married his wife, Karen, in a Catholic ceremony and until the mid\u2011\u201990s periodically referred to himself as an \u201cevangelical Catholic.\u201d That formulation might befuddle theologians, but it reveals the extraordinary degree to which Pence\u2019s personal religious evolution paralleled the rise of the religious right.\n\nIndeed, it was just a year after Pence\u2019s born-again experience in Kentucky that Jerry Falwell founded the Moral Majority, a national movement that aimed to turn Christian voters into a pavement-pounding political force. In the decades that followed, white evangelicals forged an alliance with conservative Catholics to fight abortion, gay marriage, and an encroaching secularism that they saw as a threat to their religious freedom. With conservative believers feeling under siege, denominational differences began to melt away. In 1988, at age 29, Pence launched his first bid for Congress. He garnered attention by riding a single-speed bicycle around his district in sneakers and short shorts, dodging aggravated motorists and drumming up conversations with prospective voters on the sidewalk. It was a perfectly Pencian gimmick\u2014earnest, almost unbearably cheesy\u2014and it helped him win the Republican nomination. But he was unable to defeat the Democratic incumbent, Phil Sharp. Pence tried again two years later, this time ditching the bike in favor of vicious attack ads. The race is remembered as one of the nastiest in Indiana history. In one notorious Pence campaign spot, an actor dressed as a cartoonish Arab sheikh thanked Sharp for advancing the interests of foreign oil. The tone of the campaign was jarring coming from a candidate who had nurtured such a wholesome image, a contrast memorably captured in an Indianapolis Star headline: \u201cPence Urges Clean Campaign, Calls Opponent a Liar.\u201d He ended up losing by 19 points after it was revealed that he was using campaign funds to pay his mortgage and grocery bills (a practice that was then legal but has since been outlawed).\n\nAfterward, a humbled Pence attempted public repentance by personal essay. His article, \u201cConfessions of a Negative Campaigner,\u201d ran in newspapers across the state. \u201cChrist Jesus came to save sinners,\u201d the essay began, quoting 1 Timothy, \u201camong whom I am foremost of all.\u201d With two failed congressional bids behind him, Pence decided to change tack. In 1992, he debuted a conservative talk-radio show that he described as \u201cRush Limbaugh on decaf.\u201d The quaint joke belied the meticulousness with which Pence went about building his local media empire. \u201cHe knew exactly what he wanted his brand to be and who his audience was,\u201d says Ed Feigenbaum, the publisher of a state-politics tip sheet, whom Pence often consulted. Most of his listeners were \u201cretirees and conservative housewives,\u201d Feigenbaum says, and Pence carefully catered to them. Over the next eight years, he expanded his radio show to 18 markets, started hosting a talk show on a local TV station, launched a proto-blog, and published a newsletter, \u201cThe Pence Report,\u201d which locals remember primarily for its frequent typos and Pence\u2019s lovingly drawn political cartoons. \u201cHis Mikeness,\u201d as he became known on the air, began each radio show with a signature opening line\u2014\u201cGreetings across the amber waves of grain\u201d\u2014and filled the hours with a mix of interviews, listener calls, and medium-hot takes. Pence\u2019s commentary from this period is a near-perfect time capsule of \u201990s culture-war trivia. He railed against assisted suicide (\u201cKevorkian is a monster\u201d) and fretted about the insufficient punishment given to a female Air Force pilot who had engaged in an extramarital affair (\u201cIs adultery no longer a big deal in Indiana and in America?\u201d). He mounted a rousing defense of Big Tobacco (\u201cDespite the hysteria from the political class and the media, smoking doesn\u2019t kill\u201d) and lamented parents\u2019 growing reliance on day care (pop culture \u201chas sold the big lie that \u2018Mom doesn\u2019t matter\u2019 \u201d).\n\nPence also demonstrated a knack for seizing on more-creative wedge issues. For instance, a 1995 initiative to reintroduce otters into Indiana\u2019s wildlife population became, in Pence\u2019s able hands, a frightening example of Big Government run amok. \u201cState-sanctioned, sanitized otters today,\u201d he warned, ominously. \u201cBuffaloes tomorrow?\u201d Despite Pence\u2019s on-air culture-warring, he rarely came off as disagreeable. He liked to describe himself as \u201ca Christian, a conservative, and a Republican, in that order,\u201d and he was careful to show respect for opposing viewpoints. \u201cNobody ever left an interview not liking Mike,\u201d says Scott Uecker, the radio executive who oversaw Pence\u2019s show. By the time a congressional seat opened up ahead of the 2000 election, Pence was a minor Indiana celebrity and state Republicans were urging him to run. In the summer of 1999, as he was mulling the decision, he took his family on a trip to Colorado. One day while horseback riding in the mountains, he and Karen looked heavenward and saw two red-tailed hawks soaring over them. They took it as a sign, Karen recalled years later: Pence would run again, but this time there would be \u201cno flapping.\u201d He would glide to victory.\n\nTo his colleagues on Capitol Hill\u2014an overwhelmingly secular place where even many Republicans privately sneer at people of faith\u2014everything about the Indiana congressman screamed \u201cBible thumper.\u201d He was known to pray with his staffers, and often cited scripture to explain his votes. In a 2002 interview with Congressional Quarterly, for example, he explained, \u201cMy support for Israel stems largely from my personal faith. In the Bible, God promises Abraham, \u2018Those who bless you I will bless, and those who curse you I will curse.\u2019 \u201d He became a champion of the fight to restrict abortion and defund Planned Parenthood. Pence didn\u2019t have a reputation for legislative acumen (\u201cI would not call Mike a policy wonk,\u201d one former staffer told the Indianapolis Monthly), and some of his colleagues called him a nickname behind his back: \u201cMike Dense.\u201d But he did have sharp political instincts. Before long, he was climbing the leadership ranks and making connections with key figures in the conservative-Christian establishment. The New Yorker\u2019s Jane Mayer has documented Pence\u2019s close ties to the Koch brothers and other GOP mega-donors, but his roots in the religious right are even deeper. In 2011, as he began plotting a presidential run in the upcoming election cycle, Pence met with Ralph Reed, the evangelical power broker, to seek his advice. Reed told Pence he should return home and get elected governor of Indiana first, then use the statehouse as a launching pad for a presidential bid. He said a few years in the governor\u2019s mansion\u2014combined with his deep support on the Christian right\u2014would make him a top-tier candidate in the 2016 primaries.\n\nPence took Reed\u2019s advice, and in 2012 launched a gubernatorial bid. Casting himself as the heir to the popular outgoing governor, Mitch Daniels, he avoided social issues and ran on a pragmatic, business-friendly platform. He used Ronald Reagan as a political style guru and told his ad makers that he wanted his campaign commercials to have \u201cthat \u2018Morning in America\u2019 feel.\u201d He meticulously fine-tuned early cuts of the ads, asking his consultants to edit this or reframe that or zoom in here instead of there. But he wasn\u2019t willing to win at all costs. When the race tightened in the homestretch, Pence faced immense pressure from consultants to go negative. A former adviser recalls heated conference calls in which campaign brass urged him to green-light an attack ad on his Democratic opponent, John Gregg. Pence refused. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to be a hypocrite,\u201d the former adviser says. Pence won the race anyway, and set about cutting taxes and taking on local unions\u2014burnishing a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that would impress Republican donors and Iowa caucus-goers. The governor\u2019s stock began to rise in Washington, where he was widely viewed as a contender for the 2016 presidential nomination. Then, in early 2015, Pence stumbled into a culture-war debacle that would come to define his governorship. At the urging of conservative-Christian leaders in Indiana, the GOP-controlled state legislature passed a bill that would have allowed religious business owners to deny services to gay customers in certain circumstances. Pence signed it into law in a closed-press ceremony at the statehouse, surrounded by nuns, monks, and right-wing lobbyists. A photo of the signing was released, and all hell broke loose. Corporate leaders threatened to stop adding jobs in Indiana, and national organizations began pulling scheduled conventions from the state. The NCAA, which is headquartered in Indianapolis, put out a statement suggesting that the law might imperil \u201cfuture events.\u201d The Indianapolis Star ran a rare front-page editorial under an all-caps headline: \u201cFIX THIS NOW.\u201d\n\nCaught off guard by the controversy, Pence accepted an invitation to appear on This Week With George Stephanopoulos, where he intended to make the case that the law wasn\u2019t anti-gay but rather pro\u2013religious liberty. What took place instead was an excruciating 12-minute interview in which Pence awkwardly danced around the same straightforward question: Does this law allow a Christian florist to refuse service for a same-sex wedding? \u201cGeorge, look,\u201d Pence said at one point, sounding frustrated, \u201cthe issue here is, you know, is tolerance a two-way street or not?\u201d For Pence\u2014and the conservative-Christian movement he represented\u2014this was more than just a talking point. In recent years, the religious right had been abruptly forced to pivot from offense to defense in the culture wars\u2014abandoning the \u201cfamily values\u201d crusades and talk of \u201cremoralizing America,\u201d and focusing its energies on self-preservation. Conservative Christians had lost the battles over school prayer, sex education, and pornography censorship, and the Supreme Court was poised to legalize same-sex marriage. Meanwhile, a widespread decline in churchgoing and religious affiliation had contributed to a growing anxiety among conservative believers. By 2017, white evangelicals would tell pollsters that Christians faced more discrimination in America than Muslims did. To many Christians, the backlash against Indiana\u2019s \u201creligious freedom\u201d bill was a frightening sign of the secular left\u2019s triumphalism. Liberals were no longer working toward tolerance, it seemed\u2014they were out for conquest. \u201cMany evangelicals were experiencing the sense of an almost existential threat,\u201d Russell Moore, a leader of the Southern Baptist Convention, told me. It was only a matter of time, he said, before cultural elites\u2019 scornful attitudes would help drive Christians into the arms of a strongman like Trump. \u201cI think there needs to be a deep reflection on the left about how they helped make this happen.\u201d\n\nAfter seven chaotic days, Pence caved and signed a revised version of the religious-freedom bill\u2014but by then it was too late. His approval ratings were in free fall, Democrats were raising money to defeat him in the next gubernatorial election, and the political obituaries were being written. Things looked grimmer for Pence, and the religious right, than they ever had before. Deliverance manifested itself to Mike Pence on the back nine of Donald Trump\u2019s golf course in New Jersey. It was the Fourth of July weekend, and the two men were sizing each other up as potential running mates. Each had his own hesitations. Coming into the game, Trump had formed an opinion of the Indiana governor as prudish, stiff, and embarrassingly poor, according to one longtime associate. Pence, meanwhile, had spent the primaries privately shaking his head at Trump\u2019s campaign-trail antics, and had endorsed Senator Ted Cruz for the nomination. But as the two men played golf, Pence asked what his job description would be if they wound up in the White House together. Trump gave him the same answer he\u2019d been dangling in front of other prospective running mates for weeks: He wanted \u201cthe most consequential vice president ever.\u201d Pence was sold. Before flying out to New Jersey, Pence had called Kellyanne Conway, a top Trump adviser, whom he\u2019d known for years, and asked for her advice on how to handle the meeting. Conway had told him to talk about \u201cstuff outside of politics,\u201d and suggested he show his eagerness to learn from the billionaire. \u201cI knew they would enjoy each other\u2019s company,\u201d Conway told me, adding, \u201cMike Pence is someone whose faith allows him to subvert his ego to the greater good.\u201d\n\nTrue to form, Pence spent much of their time on the course kissing Trump\u2019s ring. You\u2019re going to be the next president of the United States, he said. It would be the honor of a lifetime to serve you. Afterward, he made a point of gushing to the press about Trump\u2019s golf game. \u201cHe beat me like a drum,\u201d Pence confessed, to Trump\u2019s delight. The consensus among the campaign\u2019s top political strategists was that a Trump\u2013Pence ticket was their best shot at winning in November. After a bitter primary season, Trump\u2019s campaign had moved swiftly to shore up support from conservative Christians, who advisers worried would stay home on Election Day. Trump released a list of potential Supreme Court nominees with unimpeachably pro-life records and assembled an evangelical advisory board composed of high-profile faith leaders. One of the men asked to join the board was Richard Land, of the Southern Evangelical Seminary. When the campaign approached him with the offer, Land says, he was perplexed. \u201cYou do know that Trump was my last choice, right?\u201d he said. But he ultimately accepted, and when a campaign aide asked what his first piece of advice was, he didn\u2019t hesitate: \u201cPick Mike Pence.\u201d Nonetheless, as decision time approached, Trump was leaning toward New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a fellow bridge-and-tunnel loudmouth with whom he had more natural chemistry. The candidate\u2019s advisers repeatedly warned that the \u201cBridgegate\u201d fiasco would make Christie a liability in the general election. But they were unable to get through to Trump.\n\nThen, on July 12, a miracle: During a short campaign swing through Indiana, Trump got word that his plane had broken down on the runway, and that he would need to spend the night in Indianapolis. With nowhere else to go, Trump accepted an invitation to dine with the Pences. In fact, according to two former Trump aides, there was no problem with the plane. Paul Manafort, who was then serving as the campaign\u2019s chairman, had made up the story to keep the candidate in town an extra day and allow him to be wooed by Pence. The gambit worked: Three days later, Trump announced Pence as his running mate. On the stump and in interviews, Pence spoke of Trump in a tone that bordered on worshipful. One of his rhetorical tics was to praise the breadth of his running mate\u2019s shoulders. Trump was, Pence proclaimed, a \u201cbroad-shouldered leader,\u201d in possession of \u201cbroad shoulders and a big heart,\u201d who had \u201cthe kind of broad shoulders\u201d that enabled him to endure criticism while he worked to return \u201cbroad-shouldered American strength to the world stage.\u201d Campaign operatives discovered that anytime Trump did something outrageous or embarrassing, they could count on Pence to clean it up. \u201cHe was our top surrogate by far,\u201d said one former senior adviser to Trump. \u201cHe was this mild-mannered, uber-Christian guy with a Midwestern accent telling voters, \u2018Trump is a good man; I know what\u2019s in his heart.\u2019 It was very convincing\u2014you wanted to trust him. You\u2019d be sitting there listening to him and thinking, Yeah, maybe Trump is a good man!\u201d According to several sources, Pence wasn\u2019t just thinking about dropping out\u2014he was contemplating a coup. Even some of Trump\u2019s most devoted loyalists marveled at what Pence was willing to say. There was no talking point too preposterous, no fixed reality too plain to deny\u2014if they needed Pence to defend the boss, he was in. When, during the vice-presidential debate, in early October, he was confronted with a barrage of damning quotes and questionable positions held by his running mate, Pence responded with unnerving message discipline, dismissing documented facts as \u201cnonsense\u201d and smears.\n\nIt was the kind of performance\u2014a blur of half-truths and \u201cwhatabout\u201ds and lies\u2014that could make a good Christian queasy. But people close to Pence say he felt no conflict between his campaign duties and his religious beliefs. Marc Short, a longtime adviser to Pence and a fellow Christian, told me that the vice president believes strongly in a scriptural concept evangelicals call \u201cservant leadership.\u201d The idea is rooted in the Gospels, where Jesus models humility by washing his disciples\u2019 feet and teaches, \u201cWhoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to be first must be your slave.\u201d When Pence was in Congress, he instructed his aides to have a \u201cservant\u2019s attitude\u201d when dealing with constituents. Later, as the chairman of the House Republican Conference, he saw his job as being a servant to his fellow GOP lawmakers. And when he accepted the vice-presidential nomination, he believed he was committing to humbly submit to the will of Donald Trump. \u201cServant leadership is biblical,\u201d Short told me. \u201cThat\u2019s at the heart of it for Mike, and it comes across in his relationship with the president.\u201d Another close friend of Pence\u2019s explained it to me this way: \u201cHis faith teaches that you\u2019re under authority at all times. Christ is under God\u2019s authority, man is under Christ\u2019s authority, children are under the parents\u2019 authority, employees are under the employer\u2019s authority.\u201d\n\n\u201cMike,\u201d he added, \u201calways knows who\u2019s in charge.\u201d On Friday, October 7, 2016, The Washington Post published the Access Hollywood tape that showed Trump gloating about his penchant for grabbing women \u201cby the pussy,\u201d and instantly upended the campaign. Republicans across the country withdrew their endorsements, and conservative editorial boards called on Trump to drop out of the race. Most alarming to the aides and operatives inside Trump Tower, Mike Pence suddenly seemed at risk of going rogue. Trump\u2019s phone calls to his running mate reportedly went unreturned, and anonymous quotes began appearing in news stories describing Pence as \u201cbeside himself\u201d over the revelation. One campaign staffer told me that when she was asked on TV the day after the tape came out whether Pence would remain on the ticket, she ad-libbed that, yes, he was 100 percent committed to Trump. She remembers walking away from the set and thinking, \u201cI have no idea if what I just said is true.\u201d It\u2019s been reported that Pence sent Trump a letter saying he needed time to decide whether he could stay with the campaign. But in fact, according to several Republicans familiar with the situation, he wasn\u2019t just thinking about dropping out\u2014he was contemplating a coup. Within hours of The Post\u2019s bombshell, Pence made it clear to the Republican National Committee that he was ready to take Trump\u2019s place as the party\u2019s nominee. Such a move just four weeks before Election Day would have been unprecedented\u2014but the situation seemed dire enough to call for radical action.\n\nAlready, Reince Priebus\u2019s office was being flooded with panicked calls from GOP officials and donors urging the RNC chairman to get rid of Trump by whatever means necessary. One Republican senator called on the party to engage emergency protocols to nominate a new candidate. RNC lawyers huddled to explore an obscure legal mechanism by which they might force Trump off the ticket. Meanwhile, a small group of billionaires was trying to put together money for a \u201cbuyout\u201d\u2014even going so far as to ask a Trump associate how much money the candidate would require to walk away from the race. According to someone with knowledge of the talks, they were given an answer of $800 million. (It\u2019s unclear whether Trump was aware of this discussion or whether the offer was actually made.) Republican donors and party leaders began buzzing about making Pence the nominee and drafting Condoleezza Rice as his running mate. Amid the chaos, Trump convened a meeting of his top advisers in his Manhattan penthouse. He went around the room and asked each person for his damage assessment. Priebus bluntly told Trump he could either drop out immediately or lose in a historic landslide. According to someone who was present, Priebus added that Pence and Rice were \u201cready to step in.\u201d (An aide to the vice president denied that Pence sent Trump a letter and that he ever talked with the RNC about becoming the nominee. Priebus did not respond to requests for comment.)", "description": "Will the vice president\u2014and the religious right\u2014be rewarded for their embrace of Donald Trump?", "authors": ["Mckay Coppins"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/2017/11/WEL_Coppins_Pence/facebook.jpg?1522344070", "published_at": "2017-12-05"}
