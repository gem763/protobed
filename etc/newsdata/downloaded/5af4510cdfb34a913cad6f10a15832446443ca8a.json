On Monday, Afghan president Ashraf Ghani sought to regain control of the peace process by telling a meeting of military leaders in Kabul that his nation were ready for peace talks, but that a ceasefire would need to be implemented.\n\n\u201cWe are ready for peace talks but if the Taliban think they can scare us, look at these warriors,\u201d Ghani said, declaring that peace could not be unconditional as he repeated demands for a truce that the Taliban have so far refused. \u201cPeace without a ceasefire is impossible,\u201d he added.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

But when applied to sensitive foreign policy matters, the results can be disastrous.\n\nIn this case, the president\u2019s apparent willingness to cut some kind of secret deal with the Taliban without the buy-in of the Afghan government, America\u2019s partners in Afghanistan, including the UK, and possibly his own foreign policy team, will likely have serious consequences.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It suggests the president has no sense of what his words might imply, and how they may complicate future peace efforts.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing is not to be credulous about Trump\u2019s claims,\u201d Jarrett Blanc, a former official under US President Barack Obama, told The Independent. \u201dNo meeting was going to happen at Camp David, so he called off the peace process for some other reason. Meanwhile tweeting about Camp David ... provides legitimacy without even having the meeting.\u201d\n\nThe debacle resembled Trump\u2019s announcement last year that he was immediately ordering US troops out of northeast Syria, shocking both Washington\u2019s local allies and UK and French commandos battling Isis remnants alongside Americans.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

US officials announced resignations over what they described as a betrayal of Syrian Kurdish allies. Turkey, Russia, Iran, and the dictatorship in Damascus began planning their moves once the US withdrew its 2,000 troops, and hundreds of diplomats and contractors out of northern Syria.\n\nBut 10 months after the announcement, US troops remain in northeast Syria \u2013 even partaking in a high-profile joint patrol with Turkish colleagues on Sunday. US politicians and defence officials convinced Trump to first delay what they saw a disastrous and premature move, and then he seems to have lost interest in Syria.\n\nBy all accounts, Afghan officials and ordinary citizens are terrified that the US will throw them under the bus, abandoning them to fend for themselves against the Taliban which imposed a harsh, sectarian version of fundamentalist Islam when it ruled the country from 1996 to 2001.\n\nAfghans may be temporarily relieved that Washington and the Taliban aren\u2019t going to cut a new deal any time soon.\n\n\u201cThe Qatar talks will not restore stability in Afghanistan and may plunge Afghanistan into a civil war,\u201d warned the state-run Afghan newspaper Hewad. \u201cTaliban attacks on different parts of the country showed that the Taliban are not interested in peace at all nor do they believe in peace.\u201d\n\nBut Afghans are also bracing for a fresh increase in violence. While Ghani\u2019s government welcomed the US decision to end talks, the Taliban declared that it would \u201ccontinue to carry on the current jihad with the firm belief that the final victory will be ours\u201d.\n\nFaced with the uncertainty of an erratic patron in the White House, a shaky Afghan government in Kabul, and a resurgent Taliban \u2013 along with the local Isis affiliate lurking within the mountains \u2013 ordinary Afghans are voting with their feet. One third of Afghans have been displaced by war or forced to migrate since 2012, and indications from transit countries such as Turkey suggest they are heading in larger numbers towards western Europe.\n\nWho can blame them. A report issued Sunday by the United Nations humanitarian coordination arm found 2 million Afghan children suffering from malnutrition.\n\n\u201cOngoing hostilities across large parts of the country, including ground engagements, aerial operations, landmines and indiscriminate use of improvised explosive devices, often suicide attacks, continue to cause extreme levels of physical and psychological harm,\u201d says the report. \u201cRecord numbers of civilian casualties were seen in 2018 and this trend has continued in 2019.\u201d\n\nA resurgent Taliban, and the perception that the US is on the precipice of cutting and running from Afghanistan, will exacerbate the country\u2019s misery and violence, prompting a fresh new exodus toward Europe. Trump\u2019s misguided attempt to extract some kind of glory from Afghan tragedy causes only more suffering, and ultimately makes it more difficult to achieve peace.", "description": "Donald Trump has astonished Afghanistan as well as Washington\u2019s national security establishment\u00a0by disclosing that he had first invited and then uninvited officials of the Taliban for a summit at Camp David, abruptly declaring a US exit from ongoing peace talks.", "authors": ["Borzou Daragahi"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/02/28/09/ashraf-ghani-0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
