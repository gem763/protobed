And yet, of course, the same can be said about all sorts of cerebellum-related technologies, from electroconvulsive therapy to deep brain stimulation. Indeed, just the other day, it was reported that scientists at Boston University believe that gentle brain zaps can help people over 60 with their memory, perhaps even combatting Alzheimer\u2019s Disease. If such zapping is proven to work, who won\u2019t want want to get jumper cabled?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoreover, if we step back a bit further, we can see that people have been using brain enhancements for a long time, starting with whoever drank the first cup of coffee. Beyond caffeine, plenty of other drugs have been tried. What was the ringing finale of \u201cWhite Rabbit,\u201d that Jefferson Airplane rock song from the \u201960s? Oh yes: \u201cfeed your head!\u201d Okay, it\u2019s true that hard hallucinogenics didn\u2019t work out well, but plenty of other drugs, including marijuana, have found their places in society. There\u2019s a whole pharma chest full of newish stimulants, starting with Adderall.\n\nIn addition, it\u2019s often been argued that video games and social media are their own kind of self-doping feedback loops, delivering little highs with each click. And if that sounds scary, it must be remembered that gambling has been delivering the same cheap thrill for eons.\n\nFurthermore, it\u2019s worth pointing out that BrainCo\u2019s Focus EDU headband has actually been on the market for two years. And the company offers other similar products aimed at aiding physical training and mental alertness. Are these gadgets truly helpful? Or are they helpful only because of a happy placebo effect? Or are they somehow harmful? It will take a while to figure all that out, and in the meantime, there are at least a dozen other companies in the same market space.\n\nStill, there\u2019s something scary about the People\u2019s Republic of China using this technology. And so the word \u201cdystopian\u201d in that SupChina headline seems justified.\n\nThat is, if teachers can observe students, then so, too, can the state. Indeed, it\u2019s easy to imagine the sort of big data collection envisioned in Focus EDU becoming a part of China\u2019s Social Credit System\u2014that\u2019s the system of metrics being developed by the PRC government to track the supposed virtue of each of the country\u2019s 1.4 billion citizens.\n\nAnd of course, when Beijing thinks about virtue, it isn\u2019t just thinking, it\u2019s doing. As we know, over the last few years, China has locked up an estimated one million Chinese Uighur Muslims. And God only knows what technology\u2014imported from Massachusetts or made at home\u2014the PRC is using on those unfortunate souls.\n\nTo be sure, the Chinese communists were locking up people (or worse) by the millions long before anyone had heard of big data. Indeed, the whole of the Chinese political tradition is not exactly Lockean. So in that sense, digital technology\u2014including a pervasive network of surveillance cameras keyed to facial recognition\u2014is merely a boost to the already familiar Chinese command and control.\n\nStill, it\u2019s worth wondering what will happen when old autocracy and new technology achieve a full union. Will freedom in China be snuffed out for good? Or will its history take yet another unforeseen turn? One has to wonder, for example, about the long-term politico-cultural impact of tens of millions of diasporic Chinese, including those who run feisty sites such as SupChina, which is based in New York City.\n\nIn the meantime, here in the U.S. and in the West, we should wonder whether it can happen here\u2014\u201dit\u201d being defined, of course, as the loss of freedom. We should be proud that over the last few hundred years, we\u2019ve carved out real gains for liberty, and shared them, however fitfully, with the world. And we should recall that past predictions about the death of freedom\u2014from bureaucratism, communism, fascism, advertising mesmerism\u2014have proven to be greatly exaggerated.\n\nYet we\u2019ve also never seen anything like the Internet. Just last week, this author noted the onslaught of digital dominion, sweeping away the last vestiges of analog privacy. So maybe now it\u2019s worth wondering what will come next.\n\nSpecifically, one must ask whether the Information Age is imprinting itself on all of us, East and West alike, in dramatic and civilization-shaping ways.\n\nThat was the argument of the late Alvin Toffler in his book from 1980, The Third Wave. The first wave of human history, Toffler maintained, was agriculture, and that imposed one way of interacting with the world. The second wave was industry, and that changed everything. Now the third wave was coming in information\u2014and yet another civilizational reordering was underway.\n\nSo today, it\u2019s fair to ask whether we are, in fact, melding with the machines. How else to explain why we seem inseparable from the gadgets in our hands, on our laps, jammed in our ears\u2014and maybe soon wrapped around our heads?\n\nIndeed, it could be argued that today\u2019s young \u201csnowflakes\u201d are the obvious products of a lifetime immersion in digitalism. Having lived their lives on little screens, the larger physical reality\u2014sometimes dubbed \u201cmeatspace\u201d\u2014might seem scary. Hence the fear of being \u201ctriggered,\u201d the need for \u201csafe spaces,\u201d and all the other crutches of political correctness.\n\nWe might further observe that computers, by their binary nature, bolster systems of rigidity, even orthodoxy. As techies might say, that\u2019s a feature, not a bug.\n\nOf course, the geeks who designed all this tech might wish to think of themselves as wild-and-crazy bros, or even revolutionaries. Yet the ultimate Tofflerian reality is that computers and code are about engineering\u2014and engineers are, of course, a rules-based bunch.\n\nMeanwhile, since digital technology works so much better than its predecessors\u2014better at producing wealth, better at providing choice\u2014it\u2019s not surprising that the whole of human civilization is now surfing on this third wave, defying the rocks and the risks.\n\nYet if there\u2019s a third wave, then there\u2019s sure to be a fourth. And what might that be? One shrewd take on things to come is found in Jack Williamson\u2019s 1947 sci-fi novella, With Folded Hands. In that tale, Williamson imagines a new species of super helpful robots, operating according to the slogan, \u201cThe Perfect Mechanicals: \u2018To Serve and Obey, And Guard Men from Harm.\u2019\u201d\n\nSadly for humans\u2014after 72 years, it seems safe to offer up at least something of a spoiler\u2014it doesn\u2019t quite work out that way.\n\nSo will With Folded Hands be remembered as accurately predicting the fourth wave, which will be the robot takeover? Or will it be remembered as encouraging humans to think more carefully about who, and what, we\u2019re putting in charge\u2014thus prolonging the prosperity of the third wave?\n\nSurely that\u2019s the great question of the age.\n\nJames P.
