They\u2019re still saying you cannot do Bill O\u2019Reilly, you cannot do Newsmax,\u201d she said, which Mr. Gorka said was \u201ca shame.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey suspended me. I\u2019m not going to get fired. You know I\u2019m worried that that suspension was the basis to tee up for anything I do wrong, they\u2019ll fire me,\u201d she added.\n\nThe Washington Times has reached out to Fox News for comment and has yet to receive a response.\n\nThe suspension occurred in March after Ms. Pirro questioned whether Rep. Ilhan Omar wearing a hijab was \u201cindicative of her adherence to Shariah law, which is in itself antithetical to the U.S. Constitution.\u201d\n\nFox News condemned Ms. Pirro\u2019s comments about the Minnesota Democrat as unreflective of the network and said it discussed the issue with her. She didn\u2019t appear on her show for the two weekends following with no explanation given.\n\nWatch below, via Media Matters:\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
