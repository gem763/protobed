If those tariffs go into effect as scheduled, that would mean virtually every Chinese product shipped into the U.S. would be subject to a tariff.\n\nMore: China demands US discard tech sanctions ahead of high-stakes trade talks\n\nChina has retaliated by placing tariffs on more than $75 billion worth of U.S. products, including agriculture products, cars, auto parts, chemicals, whiskey, cigars, clothing and TVs. A second round of tariffs by China is to take effect Dec. 15, the same date the latest U.S. tariffs are scheduled to kick in.\n\nThe latest round of trade talks takes place as Trump faces domestic pressures that include an impeachment investigation in which China plays a role.\n\nLast week, lawmakers in both parties assailed Trump for saying that China should investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who had business interests in China.\n\nThe House Democrats' impeachment investigation centers on Trumps' efforts to get Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.\n\nChina has rejected Trump's request, saying it didn't want to get involved in U.S. domestic politics.\n\nTrump told reporters Thursday it didn't matter to him one way or another. \"China has to do whatever they want,\" he said. \"If they want to look into something, they can look into it. If they don't want to look into it, they don't have to.\"\n\nMore: Fox News poll: 51 percent favor Trump's impeachment and removal from office\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Donald Trump to meet with China official amid trade war", "description": "President Donald Trump and China's top trade negotiator will meet at the White House amid the latest round of trade talks between the two countries.", "authors": ["Michael Collins", "David Jackson", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6xd3LI2jy4Kas3gePpl4gg--~B/aD0zNjQ4O3c9NTQ3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/f237a744b761b6aafc37bb53a0b0a643", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
