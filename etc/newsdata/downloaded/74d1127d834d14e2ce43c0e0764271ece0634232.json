The president has made no secret that he wanted Ukraine to investigate any improper overlap between Biden\u2019s own diplomatic efforts there and his son\u2019s role with a gas company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch. \u201cSomeone ought to look into Joe Biden,\u201d Trump told reporters Friday in response to a question about his call with Zelenskiy.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison depart a news conference in the White House, on Friday, Sept. 20, 2019. (Doug Mills/The New York Times) More\n\nThe revelations added urgency to questions about Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine, which is battling Russian-controlled separatists in the country\u2019s east. When the president sought the Biden investigation, the Trump administration\u2019s military aid to Ukraine had been frozen for weeks.\n\nThe United States suspended that assistance in early July, according to a former U.S. official. Trump did not discuss the aid in the July 25 call with Zelenskiy, whose government did not learn of the suspension until August, according to people familiar with the call. The Wall Street Journal first reported details of the call.\n\nFor Democrats who want to examine the whistleblower complaint \u2014 itself the subject of an internal administration dispute over whether to hand it over to Congress, as is generally required by law \u2014 the key question is whether Trump was demanding a quid pro quo, explicitly or implicitly. Democratic House committee chairmen are already investigating whether he manipulated U.S. foreign policy for personal political advantage and have requested the transcript of the Zelenskiy call.\n\nThe growing controversy had echoes of the dominant scandal of the first years of Trump\u2019s administration: whether his campaign sought help from Russia to benefit him in 2016. Ultimately, the special counsel found that although \u201cinsufficient evidence\u201d existed to determine that Trump or his advisers engaged in a criminal conspiracy with the Russians, his campaign welcomed Moscow\u2019s election sabotage and expected to benefit from it.\n\nAny attempt by Trump to ask a foreign power to \u201cdig up dirt\u201d on a political rival while withholding aid is corrupt, said Rep. Adam B. Schiff, D-Calif., the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, one of the panels examining Trump\u2019s Ukraine dealings.\n\n\u201cNo explicit quid pro quo is necessary to betray your country,\u201d tweeted Schiff, who has also pushed for the whistleblower complaint to be given to Congress.\n\nTrump opened a direct counterattack Friday against the whistleblower, whose identity is unknown, as are many details about the complaint. The president dismissed the allegations and labeled the whistleblower, without evidence, a political partisan.", "description": "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump pressed the Ukrainian president in a July call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's son, according to a person familiar with the conversation, an apparently blatant mixture of foreign policy with his 2020 reelection campaign.Trump also repeatedly told", "authors": ["Julian E.
