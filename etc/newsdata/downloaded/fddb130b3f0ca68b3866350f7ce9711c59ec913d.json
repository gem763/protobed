Tencent signed a five-year deal worth an estimated $1.5 billion with the NBA earlier this year.\n\nThe latest exchange of restrictive measures comes only two days before top-level trade representatives are due to resume talks on resolving the trade dispute between the two countries.\n\nHowever, the latest actions illustrate how the task of resolving commercial disputes is being complicated by other antagonisms rooted in politics and conflicting world views.\n\nAlthough not directly related, China\u2019s move comes within hours of the U.S forbidding its companies to do business with 28 Chinese technology companies due to their role in facilitating alleged human rights violations in the western Chinese province of Xinjiang.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. government and Department of Commerce cannot and will not tolerate the brutal suppression of ethnic minorities within China,\u201d Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement that was a million miles away from concerns about trade imbalances. \u201cThis action will ensure that our technologies, fostered in an environment of individual liberty and free enterprise, are not used to repress defenceless minority populations.\u201d\n\nEurope\u2019s economy has proved itself more vulnerable to this rivalry than investors had thought possible this year. While the Chinese and U.S. economies have slowed, it\u2019s the euro zone which is sliding into recession first \u2013 a 0.3% rise in German industrial production in August, reported this morning, is unlikely to stop that.\n\nWith the commercial boycotts now appearing to make a breakthrough at this week\u2019s talks a forlorn hope, European markets have lost one of their key short-term supports. The was down 0.3% by 5 AM ET (0900 GMT) at 381.66, giving up around half of Monday\u2019s gains. The trade-sensitive German was down 0.4% while the eked out a 0.1% gain due to more weakness.", "description": "StockBeat: Europe Stocks Hit as China Blocks NBA in Blacklist Spat", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/c267018b943711a62d5f67c632ed6b43_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
