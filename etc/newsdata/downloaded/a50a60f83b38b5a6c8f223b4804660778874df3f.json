He looked on as many of his superiors during wartime, including high-ranking Nazi Party officials stationed at Auschwitz, were convicted in the Nuremberg trials from 1945 to 1949 for their crimes against humanity. But Hanning, a former SS guard, was not considered a high-profile war criminal, so he was never indicted.\n\nThat is, until three years ago. In accordance with Germany\u2019s lifted statute of limitations for the prosecution of war criminals, Hanning, who was then 94 years old, found himself face-to-face with justice in June of 2016 when he was charged with 170,000 counts of murder\u2014approximately the number of people who died during his tenure as a sergeant at the death camp.\n\nBut proving Hanning was an accomplice to murders that occurred 70 years ago\u2014in a crime scene that has since been destroyed, along with almost all pertinent records\u2014was a tall order. Contributing to the morass was Hanning\u2019s claim that he never personally witnessed victims being gassed to death. Prosecutors needed evidence to link Hanning to the charges in his indictment: monitoring \u00adarriving prisoners as they were sorted into groups headed directly into labor or the gas chambers, a process that came to be known as \u201cselection.\u201d Essentially, the court needed to travel back in time and see what Hanning saw, from the perpetrator\u2019s vantage point.\n\nThat\u2019s how virtual reality wound up in the courtroom, for the first time, in what might be the last World War II Nazi trial. David Freid\u2019s short documentary Nazi VR details how a team of German forensic VR engineers recreated a 3-D model of Auschwitz-Birkenau through millions of laser scans, historical blueprints of the site, aerial photographs, and witness testimonies. Wearing the VR goggles, investigators and judges can climb the watchtowers and observe how prisoners would have been moved around the 15-mile camp, where more than 1.1 million people were murdered during the war.\n\n\u201cVirtual reality is a great tool to objectively establish what was visible to the defendant,\u201d says David Scheffer, who served as the U.S.\u2019s war-crimes ambassador from 1997 to 2001, in the film. \u201cSo, as Mr. Hanning claimed, \u2018I was in such a position that I could not have seen what was occurring elsewhere in the camp,\u2019 the VR will contradict that claim.\u201d\n\nAs Freid\u2019s documentary reveals, the reconstructed model indeed refuted Hanning\u2019s claims. In the court decision, the judge explicitly referenced the VR experience as having aided his ability to establish accountability.\n\n\u201cTechnology reveals the memory of what occurred 70 years ago,\u201d says Scheffer. \u201cHanning represented the common man in the killing machine. Only a very small fraction of those individuals have ever faced justice.\u201d\n\nFreid told me that while making the film, he was moved by the experience of entering the digital camp. \u201cI was also taken by the lengths at which Germany tries to remember its past, and to make sure young people learn from it. I think we need to do a better job of that here [in the U.S.]\u201d", "description": "In Germany, prosecutors are using virtual-reality models of the death camp to build cases against World War II criminals.", "authors": ["Emily Buder"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/video/img/2019/04/Nazi_VR/video-featured.jpg", "published_at": "2019-04-05"}
