GENERAL ASSEMBLY Trump briefly pops into UN climate summit after expected snub\n\nPresident Donald Trump made a brief semi-surprise appearance at the United Nations climate summit in New York Monday morning, despite expectations that he would fully snub the landmark event.\n\nHe found a seat in the auditorium just as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi took the stage, according to pool reports. Earlier Monday, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said she wouldn't be surprised if Trump popped into the summit, which is occurring against the backdrop of global demonstrations designed to urge action on climate change.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe summit brings together leaders from dozens of countries to submit climate plans intended to surpass the emissions reduction and renewable energy goals of the 2016 Paris Agreement, an accord from which Trump withdrew and that many of the remaining signatories are well short of fulfilling.\n\nFor days, the administration indicated Trump would skip the summit to instead give an address on religious freedom. On Sunday, Trump told reporters that his absence from the event would not be \"a snub at all\" and noted that he was making visits to Ohio and Houston, where there is major flooding.\n\n\"The floods are very important to me, and climate change \u2014 everything is very important,\" Trump said.\n\nJoin our reporters for live coverage of the U.N.
