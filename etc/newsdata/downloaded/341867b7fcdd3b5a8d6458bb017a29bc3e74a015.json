What we need is operational, legally binding solutions for both parties\", Barnier concluded.\n\nThe Finnish Minister for European Affairs Tytti Tuppurainen, who also spoke at the European parliament, warned MEPs that a no-deal scenario in which the Uk would \"crash out\" of the EU is a \"dangerously realistic scenario\".\n\nYou can watch Juncker's speech \u2014 and that of the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier \u2014 in the video player, above.", "description": "EU chief Jean-Claude Juncker refused to rule out a Brexit deal as he condemned the \"blame game from London\".", "authors": ["Chris Harris"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/21/99/16/1000x563_cmsv2_7f779f01-ba3d-51da-9f0b-aa5d2f74865c-4219916.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
