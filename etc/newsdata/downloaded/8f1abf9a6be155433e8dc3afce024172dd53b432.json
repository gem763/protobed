But after a contentious July confirmation hearing, Mr. Canterbury\u2019s nomination has been languishing.\n\nMr. Graham, South Carolina Republican, hinted Wednesday the administration may ultimately withdraw Mr. Canterbury\u2019s nomination.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll have that up to them, but I think that one will be a problem,\u201d Mr. Graham said when asked by The Hill if the White House would retract the nomination.\n\nMr. Graham also told the outlet Mr. Canterbury\u2019s confirmation vote is \u201cgoing to be very problematic.\u201d\n\nThe nomination was on the committee\u2019s agenda just before it broke for a two-week recess earlier this month. But since the recess ended, Mr. Canterbury has disappeared from the committee\u2019s vote schedule.\n\nMr. Canterbury frustrated senators of both parties during his confirmation hearing this summer. Senators repeatedly pressed him for his opinions on the major gun-rights debates facing the country, but Mr. Canterbury demurred saying he could not stray from the FOP\u2019s official positions.\n\nTwo Republican Senators, Mike Lee of Utah, and John Kennedy of Louisiana said the dodging could cost their votes.\n\n\u201cI like straight answers, and you are being evasive,\u201d Mr. Kennedy said at the time. \u201cYou have been nominated to run ATF. I think every member of this panel, both my Democratic friends and Republican friends who have feelings about the Second Amendment, are entitled to know both morally and legally what you believe.\u201d\n\nRepublicans hold a 12-10 majority on the committee so unless Democrats are willing to crossover to support Mr. Canterbury \u2014 an unlikely scenario \u2014 he does not have enough votes to clear the committee.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
