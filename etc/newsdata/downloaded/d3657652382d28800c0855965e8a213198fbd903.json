But some of his most enjoyable creations are the costumes he creates (and wears) for conventions. One of his most popular of all time was his No-Face outfit, which Adam decided to revisit and upgrade for New York Comic-Con 2019.\n\nThose who haven\u2019t seen Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s Spirited Away might assume that the mask worn by No-Face reveals the character\u2019s eyes and mouth, but hidden just below it is a giant, somewhat terrifying tooth-filled grin into which No-Face eventually shovels full of food at a giant feast.\n\nIt\u2019s a feature that Savage\u2019s original No-Face costume, which has racked up over a million views on YouTube over the past seven years, was missing \u2014 but not any longer.\n\nSavage isn\u2019t the first cosplayer to recreate No-Face\u2019s gaping maw, but with decades of prop-building experience under his belt, his new and improved No-Face costume might be one of the most impressive recreations to ever wander through a convention. Built using a combination of aluminium strips from a hardware store, yards of crushed velvet, foam, and hand-carved plastic teeth, Savage actually took some inspiration from another well-known prop builder, Stuart Freeborn, for an extra level of added detail.\n\nWhen No-Face\u2019s mouth opens, it activates an additional wire cable mechanism that makes the character\u2019s lips retract and teeth more visible, and it\u2019s based on the mechanism that Freeborn created so the mouth movements of the Chewbacca costume used in the original Star Wars movies appeared more realistic.\n\nAdam Savage will be roaming the floor of 2019 New York Comic-Con while incognito in his upgraded No-Face costume, and we\u2019ll have an interview with him later this week.", "description": "Adam Savage is known for building everything from rocket-powered cars on Mythbusters\u00a0to props for the Star Wars sequels while at ILM.
