Likewise providing the music.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing that years later George\u2019s music is finally centre-stage of a film. He would have loved it.\u201d\n\nLast Christmas, in cinemas on November 15, was co-scripted by Emma Thompson, who also stars, alongside Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding, who was in Crazy Rich Asians.\n\nThompson wanted to make a film inspired by George\u2019s song Last Christmas and in 2013 she even visited him at his London home, where he gave her his blessing.\n\nEmma said: \u201cThe wisdom and emotional scope of George\u2019s lyrics have always amazed me.\u201d\n\nThe soundtrack, released on November 8, features three Wham! songs including Last Christmas and Everything She Wants as well as 12 of George\u2019s tracks from his solo years.\n\nThere is even a new track \u2013 This Is How (We Want You To Get High) \u2013 which has never been heard before.\n\nMusic insiders say they have high hopes for the album \u2013 and many of the singer\u2019s fans hope it could even land Michael with a posthumous Christmas number one, something he has never achieved.\n\nLast Christmas peaked at two back in 1984, as Band Aid\u2019s Do They Know It\u2019s Christmas kept it off the top spot.\n\nFour Weddings and A Funeral featured Hugh Grant, Andie MacDowell, Kristin Scott Thomas and Rowan Atkinson.\n\nWet Wet Wet recorded Love Is All Around for the soundtrack and stayed at Number 1 for 15 weeks.", "description": "The Wham! singer had been offered a part by Richard Curtis and asked to provide music for the soundtrack", "authors": ["Tom Bryant", "Image", "Pa", "Polygram Film International"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20578617.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_X-Factor.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
