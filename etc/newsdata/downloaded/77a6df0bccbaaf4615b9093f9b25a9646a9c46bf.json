You\u2019ll note I didn\u2019t say I have driven the new Vette. For even though I actually steered the wheel, pressed the gas pedal and stomped on the brake, I didn\u2019t actually \u201cdrive\u201d the supercar, at least not like it wants \u2014 hell, needs \u2014 to be driven. Indeed, my 45-minute meander through suburban Detroit was little more than a whistle wetter.\n\nNonetheless, I got a hint of what the C8 will be like, enough, in fact, that I can at least tell you what a mid-engine Corvette will feel like on your everyday commute. So, without further ado\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s the real deal\n\nNo. I didn\u2019t clip even a single apex in anger. Or even mow through the gears with bad intentions. But I can still say this is a Corvette apart. It \u2014 as you might expect \u2014 feels different, just like a mid-engine supercar does when you\u2019re driving responsibly. The steering is lighter than in front-engine Vettes, the connection between driver and front wheels a little more direct. There\u2019s very much a sense you are sitting right over the very centre of the car; that\u2019s because your butt is very close to its centre of mass. That\u2019s fairly easy to imagine, with the massive LT2 small-block thrumming right behind your ear \u2014 you\u2019ve very aware just how close you are to the heaviest single component in the entire car.\n\nBut there\u2019s more to it than that. There\u2019s the fact that mid-engine cars have a much smaller polar moment of inertia. Not as immediately obvious a concept as mass centralization, polar moment of inertia is a measure of how far the weight of the engine and other components are from the car\u2019s centre. The engine in a C7, for instance, is all the way up front, and the axle/transmission all the way in the back. In other words, the weight of the driveline is concentrated at the extreme ends of the chassis. Imagine a broom with a weight dangling at each end. Now try to spin it. Not easy, right? Now move both weights to the centre of the broom and try to spin it again? Much easier, no?\n\nThat\u2019s what putting an engine amidships does for a supercar\u2019s polar moment of inertia. And you can feel it even driving at moderate speeds, the new C8 lighter and more responsive than its 1,530 kilograms suggests. How this translates onto the racetrack we will report on in the future, but it certainly feels like there\u2019s plenty of potential.\n\nThis new Corvette feels super sophisticated\n\nAlmost too sophisticated. Indeed, the ride in Tour mode is the most compliant I have ever tested in a mid-engine car \u2014 even compared to the McLaren GT, which the automaker claims to have tailored for more moderate driving. It could be too compliant, the ride from Chevrolet\u2019s revised magneto-rheological suspension so positively cushy that Corvette\u2019s traditional clientele might not find it \u2014 pardon the sexist reference \u2014 \u201cmanly\u201d enough. Don\u2019t worry, guys; flip the really nifty mode selector to Sport or Race and the new Vette will rattle your fillings just like God and Zora Arkus-Duntov meant. And just in case you\u2019re actually weak of arm yet still long for that manly ride, there are not just one but two custom modes that allow you to customize suspension compliance, steering weight and throttle response individually. Eventually, what will decide the new C8\u2019s worth is how adroitly it can navigate through hairpins and sweepers, but right now the biggest surprise is how gently the car coddles posteriors.\n\nCritics be damned, the interior is Tony the Tiger Greeeeat!\n\nThere\u2019 been some criticism of the C8\u2019s cabin layout. Well, having lived with it \u2014 albeit for 45 short minutes \u2014 I can tell you few of them are valid. Oh, the actual gauge set is a little underwhelming and GM would do well to spruce it up, but that square steering wheel works wonders for being able to see the entire gauge set without craning your neck sideways. It also does nothing to reduce steering feel, so good one, GM.\n\nAs for that long line of buttons that has so many on the blogosphere upset, it\u2019s totally ergonomic. First, it really does make the view from the driver\u2019s seat feel like a cockpit \u2014 more so, even, than supercars from more prestigious brands. Said buttons are also easy to decipher and manipulate. What more could you ask for?\n\nDitto the infotainment touchscreen. Ideally placed for actuation, it also feels almost built into the dash \u2014 although it is a separate piece \u2014 compared with the perched-on-top items that look so cheap on higher-end Mercedes and BMWs. Throw in a very stylish mode control mouse and you have a pretty nifty centre console.\n\nAs for the general decor, it\u2019s still not quite up to the standards of a Ferrari, or even an Audi. But the leather quality, the panel gaps and the general ambiance is so far advanced from Corvettes previous that one wonders, considering that there has not been a giant price increase, why the hell these improvements weren\u2019t instituted before. All in all, a massive step forward.\n\nA little more drama perhaps\n\nWith 495 horses and 470 pound feet of torque, there\u2019s a certainly bit of giddy-up to the C8. I hardly got to test said power, but the potential is there, no doubt. I do, however, wish there was a bit more aural entertainment from the engine compartment. Even with the Z51 version \u2014 and its optional performance exhaust in Race mode \u2014 the potent 6.2-litre small-block didn\u2019t seem to bellow as loudly as previous Vettes. Is GM keeping the full song for yet another accessory exhaust system? Is the full opera being reserved for some future Z06 variant? C\u2019mon guys, even we who can only afford base Stingrays want the full 1812 Overture. Let my pistons sing!\n\nFinally, there\u2019s an even greater sense of the incredible value of the new C8\n\nWe already knew that this level of performance \u2014 three seconds to 100 kilometres an hour \u2014 was unheard of in a mid-engine supercar that starts at less than $70,000. But combined with the aforementioned sophistication, the incredibly improved interior and the overall tightness of the chassis, said $69,998 MSRP is even more amazing. Even the fully optioned 3LT \u2014 Napa- and Mulan-leather-clad GT2 seats, leather-wrapped steering wheel and microsuede trim bits \u2014 is a perfectly reasonable $85,398.\n\nI suspect, though, that the C8\u2019s sweet spot will be the 2LT version, which, for $79,898, includes a 14-speaker Bose audio system, heated and ventilated seats, wireless charging and a bunch of safety features. Throw in the must-have Z51 Performance package \u2014 upgraded exhaust and suspension, electronically controlled limited-slip differential, grippy Michelin Pilot Sport 4S performance tires and Brembo monoblock front calipers \u2014 and you\u2019re squirting to 100 km/h in three seconds for just $85,798.\n\nAssuming its track performance equals the car\u2019s impressive road manners, this makes the new C8 the supercar deal of the century.", "description": "It was just a tease of a drive, but this is what we learned in our short time in the new mid-engine Corvette in Z51 trim", "authors": ["Hours Ago"], "top_image": "https://postmediadriving.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/dsc00312.jpg?quality=80", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
