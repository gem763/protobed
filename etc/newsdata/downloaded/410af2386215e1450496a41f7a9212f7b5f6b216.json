He also expressed concern that the searches cause public distress and embarrassment for the named subjects and their families\u2019.\n\nThe raids on the homes of former armed forces chief Lord Bramall, the widow of former Home Secretary Leon Brittan and Tory ex-MP Harvey Proctor still went ahead, with devastating consequences.\n\nMr Proctor, falsely accused of being a serial child killer by Beech, said: \u2018Those who enforce the law should not be seen to be above it. The public can finally see for itself the truly disgraceful conduct of Operation Midland which has ruined the lives and reputations of so many people.\n\n\u2018It is outrageous that Steve Rodhouse remains in post. Will no one take the blame for the worst police and criminal justice scandal in decades?\u2019\n\nMr Proctor\u2019s counsel, Geoffrey Robertson QC, said the Henriques Report revealed that \u2018Operation Midland was conducted incompetently, negligently and almost with institutional stupidity\u2019.\n\nPaul Settle, a former detective chief inspector who raised concerns about Beech\u2019s credibility, said: \u2018I am astounded that even after all this time the Metropolitan Police continue with their pitiful attempt at trying to protect senior officers. Today we have seen the level of incompetence which permeated right to the very top, and we have to ask are these people fit to lead what was the greatest force in the world?\u2019\n\nSir Richard said in his 2016 report, released in a fuller version yesterday after a campaign by the Mail, that:\n\nLabour\u2019s deputy leader Tom Watson \u2018created further pressure\u2019 to probe Beech\u2019s claims;\n\nOfficers could have closed down Operation Midland within weeks, yet it lasted 16 months;\n\nDetectives failed to properly investigate Beech\u2019s credibility at the start of the probe;\n\nA senior officer\u2019s use of the phrase \u2018credible and true\u2019 to describe Beech was inappropriate and misleading;\n\nThe search warrants were obtained unlawfully.\n\nD-Day hero Lord Bramall\u2019s son Nick said: \u2018Operation Midland and the extraordinary incompetence, insensitivity and damaging way in which it was handled has finally been laid bare.\n\n\u2018Good men through absolutely no fault of their own have been publicly vilified and taken to the darkest of places.\n\n\u2018The Metropolitan Police were simply seduced by the idea of a VIP paedophile ring and failed utterly in their duty to properly investigate.\n\n\u2018They resorted to search warrants that were illegal, raided homes with battering ram insensitivity and left my father to fend for himself while tainted with a veneer of guilt.\u2019Mr Rodhouse apologised for the \u2018distress\u2019 caused by the operation, adding: \u2018In hindsight I can see I did not ensure that we got the balance right.\u2019\n\nPriti Patel is to tell Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Constabulary to review the force (pictured is deputy assistant commissioner Steve Rodhouse who oversaw the shambles) and its response to the \u2018Nick\u2019\n\nScotland Yard\u2019s Deputy Commissioner Sir Stephen House said in a statement: \u2018Mistakes were made in Operation Midland and we have apologised for those. We apologise for them again today.\u2019\n\nA Downing Street spokesman said last night: \u2018This is a deeply concerning case. The trial of Carl Beech raised serious issues over the Metropolitan Police response. We welcome the decision to publish further detail.\n\n\u2018That is why the Home Secretary has asked Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services to follow up on the report\u2019s findings and ensure the necessary improvements have been made and continue to be made.\u2019\n\nConvicted paedophile Beech, 51, was jailed for 18 years in July for his VIP abuse lies and other offences.", "description": "The Met spent \u00a32.5m on false claims by Carl Beech and none of the five key officers have faced charges.
