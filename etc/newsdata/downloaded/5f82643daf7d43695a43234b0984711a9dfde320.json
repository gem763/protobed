On campus, headsets are used to provide access to virtual reality technology.\n\n\n\n\"Augmented reality allows students to visualize and manipulate anatomical structures and develop a deep understanding,\" McDonald said. \"You can superimpose anatomical structures over a peer who can perform movements along with the app, to better understand muscle function,\" he added. \"It is a great resource for both team work and self-directed learning.\"\n\n\n\nThe university said that, in terms of cost, the use of AR technology amounted to 10 Australian dollars ($6.74) per student compared to over 100 Australian dollars for just one textbook.\n\nTechnology is driving change across the education sector, with computers and tablets now a common site in classrooms and libraries around the world. The last few years have also seen the development of digital based learning platforms including massive open online courses, or MOOCS.\n\n\n\nProviders such as edX \u2014 which was founded by Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2012 \u2014 offer free online courses from renowned institutions such as Columbia University and Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. The platform provides more than 2,400 courses and its users come from all over the world.\n\n\n\nIn July this year education publisher Pearson announced that all new releases of its 1,500 active U.S. titles would be \"digital first.\" The company said the titles would be updated on a continuous basis \"driven by developments in the field of study, new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, data analytics, and Pearson's own efficacy research.\"", "description": "The way students learn is changing, with technology becoming increasingly sophisticated.", "authors": ["Anmar Frangoul"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106169720-1570533966491gettyimages-1133259607.jpeg?v=1570534024", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
