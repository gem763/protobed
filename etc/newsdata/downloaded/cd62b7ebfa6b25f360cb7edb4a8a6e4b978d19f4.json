But it seems Dr DisRespect will not next.\n\nDr DisRespect, real name Herschel Beahm, has mocked what he refers to as Mixer\u2019s low engagement rates and suggested that its long-term prospects are not as good as Twitch\u2019s.\n\n\u2018Mixer wants to be relevant,\u2019 he said during his latest stream. \u2018Their expectation is to mix their little Xbox streams and a space for influencers to grow. They claim 30 million monthly active users but that\u2019s because all of their Xbox users get default Mixer streams. Their engagement is extremely low, trust me.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut not only did Dr DisRespect claim that he was \u2018the first\u2019 to be asked by Microsoft to join Mixer he claims he\u2019s already making more money than either Shroud or Ninja.\n\nThat seems unlikely given rumours that Ninja was paid at least $50 million to make the jump, and Shroud was presumably paid something similar, but then again Dr DisRespect\u2019s shtick is, well\u2026 disrespecting people.\n\n\u2018We love Shroud, and we wish him good luck\u2019, he said in a more conciliatory tone.\n\n\u2018The man got paid. Did he get paid more than the Doctor? Did the guy with the blue hair, the little Dragon Ball Z anime guy, did he get paid more than the Doctor? No, both of them didn\u2019t.\u2019\n\nWhether that\u2019s true, and whether he\u2019d even know, isn\u2019t clear but one thing\u2019s certain: Dr DisRespect isn\u2019t leaving Twitter. At least not until Microsoft up their offer.\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter\n\nMORE: Ninja ditching Twitch was \u2018bad move\u2019 says Dr Disrespect as he claims to know Mixer deal\n\nMORE: Dr Disrespect is back on Twitch now after two week ban\n\nMORE: Ninja dyes hair \u2018Twitch colours\u2019 after accusing site of \u2018promoting porn\u2019 and moving to Mixer", "description": "Microsoft may have signed up another high profile streamer for its Mixer service, but Dr Disrespect insists he\u2019s staying with Twitch.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screenshot_1-5d40_1572031863.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
