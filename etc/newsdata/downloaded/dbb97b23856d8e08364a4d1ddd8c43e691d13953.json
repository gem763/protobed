The cheapest model starts at 5,499 yuan ($777). That mark-up is less than last year's iPhone XR \u2014 the equivalent of the new iPhone 11 \u2014 which commanded a 28% premium.\n\nApple was eventually forced to slash its iPhone prices in China for that series.\n\nBut the cheaper iPhone 11 pricing has got Chinese consumers interested.\n\nFenqile, a Chinese e-commerce firm and an authorized Apple reseller, told CNBC that of all the iPhone 11 devices pre-ordered \u2014 including the Pro and Pro Max \u2014 40% reserved the 128GB iPhone 11 and 22% ordered the 64GB iPhone 11. They are Apple's two cheapest models, which means the majority of pre-orders were for the iPhone 11.", "description": "Apple's own website shows delivery times for certain iPhone 11 models as late as October 15, several weeks after the September 20 launch date.", "authors": ["Arjun Kharpal"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106122313-1568148404759gettyimages-1167245730r.jpg?v=1568217004", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
