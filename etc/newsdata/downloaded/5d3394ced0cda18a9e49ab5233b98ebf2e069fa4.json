The Cohens were reasonably well-off, but their neighborhood wasn\u2019t fancy, and their son was what could be called rich-adjacent: He went to the top-rated, well-funded Horace Greeley high school, about a 20-minute drive south in the tonier town of Chappaqua, which he identifies with more readily than Yorktown Heights.\n\nHis great-uncle, Nat Zuckerman, was an amateur magician who taught him basic card tricks starting when Cohen was six years old. They went into Manhattan together on occasion to shop at Tannen\u2019s Magic Store for trick objects, such as color-changing handkerchiefs and a ball that would vanish from its box. Cohen began leaving fliers around school advertising his magic-show services for a modest fee. When he was ten, in 1981, he landed his first performance at a four-year-old\u2019s birthday party, making $25. As he continued to perform around Westchester County into his teens, the real rush came when he saw that the grown-ups standing in the back were enjoying his show as well.\n\nWord spread about the precocious magician, and, at seventeen, David Rockefeller asked Cohen to perform at the family\u2019s Pocantico Hills estate for their Christmas party\u2014Cohen\u2019s first direct experience with the ultra-rich and famous. It would prove to be a life-changing moment. He performed two sets: one for the children and one for the adults. Afterward, the adults invited him to dine at their table, and he sat next to Peggy Rockefeller and performed close-up magic for her. \u201cShe\u2019s going bananas,\u201d Cohen tells me. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Wow, this is incredible. This is someone who\u2019s very powerful.\u2019 Her painting\u2019s on the wall, you know?\u201d\n\nShortly after performing for the Rockefellers, Cohen enrolled at Cornell. He went to Tokyo for a study-abroad program at Waseda University, and then, after graduating, returned to Tokyo, where he worked as a magician at the New York Grill at the Park Hyatt Hotel (later made famous stateside by Sofia Coppola\u2019s Lost in Translation). He had married Yumi Morishige, a journalist he had met at university, and they moved back to the U.S. in 1995. But he wasn\u2019t sure how to jump-start his career back home. He tried brushing shoulders with wealthier people, going to New York\u2019s Peninsula Hotel on Fifth Avenue to perform close-up magic at the bar. Without a steady venue or media coverage, however, he struggled to build a network of affluent clients. \u201cWe were eating a lot of pasta,\u201d he says. \u201cMoney was tight.\u201d\n\nAfter working briefly as a television consultant to David Blaine, Cohen teamed up with the amateur magician and self-described \u201cdifferentiation consultant\u201d Mark Levy to find a way to stand apart. In 2000, they met at a diner in Manhattan and did tricks for one another, like Cohen changing the time on Levy\u2019s watch with his mind\u2014and then changing it back so Levy wouldn\u2019t miss his train. At the time, Levy remembered, \u201cSteve was trying to differentiate by calling himself a conjuror. But back in 2000, before the Harry Potter book series became enormous, most people didn\u2019t really understand what a conjuror did.\u201d\n\nLevy saw that Cohen was at ease performing in front of the very rich, and he had \u201ca sophistication to his thinking and speaking\u201d thanks to \u201chis Ivy League education.\u201d There was also an opening in the market in the heady pre-crisis days in New York. \u201cWhile certain market segments had been claimed by other magicians\u2014David Blaine was The Street Magician, Penn & Teller were The Bad Boys of Magic\u2014no one was doing magic for the rich,\u201d Levy said.\n\nCohen was counseled to make business cards, to dress sharply, and to brand his act as \u201cmagic for the filthy rich\u201d or the \u201cdecadently rich.\u201d\n\nHe counseled Cohen to make business cards, to dress sharply, and to brand his act as \u201cmagic for the filthy rich\u201d or the \u201cdecadently rich.\u201d They settled on a less aggressive moniker that they\u2019d seen in a brief write-up of Cohen\u2019s magic shows in a defunct society magazine called Avenue: \u201cthe Millionaires\u2019 Magician.\u201d Together, Cohen and Levy wrote Chamber Magic\u2014the tricks, the script, and the stagecraft, tailoring it all to Cohen\u2019s new brand. \u201cWe changed his clothing and even the tricks themselves, so they fit that persona,\u201d Levy said.\n\nCohen was only 30 at the time, and he felt the whole act was a bit of a stretch. \u201cAs a young man, it\u2019s kind of hard to call yourself that,\u201d he says. He finally scored a permanent venue when Holly Peppe, a socialite and publicist, got Cohen a room at the Waldorf, where he would go on to perform Chamber Magic from 2001 to 2017. And that\u2019s when Cohen really started to become comfortable in the skin of his stage act. \u201cAs you get a little bit older and as you become a millionaire, as you get gray and wear glasses, people started looking at me like, \u2018Well, this guy must know what he\u2019s doing,\u2019\u201d he says.\n\nAt Chamber Magic, an intimate hour-and-a-half of parlor magic that accommodates no more than 60 people, seats go for between $125 and $250. This already lucrative stream of income is supplemented by the windfalls of Cohen\u2019s private magic shows, which can climb to $25,000 per performance. Over the past two decades, he\u2019s netted, by his estimate, $25 million. In one paroxysm of publicity after a CBS Sunday Morning appearance in 2006, he managed to book a million dollars in shows in a single week.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something about close-up magic,\u201d said Joe Posnanski, author of the upcoming The Life and Afterlife of Harry Houdini. \u201cAgain and again you will see people say something like, \u2018I don\u2019t really like magic,\u2019 but when they see it live and up close, when it is done right before their eyes, their minds explode. It\u2019s a whole different experience than what they associate with \u2018magic.\u2019 That\u2019s not to say a big magic show lacks magic\u2014the great ones can blow minds in huge theaters. But the closer you get to the magic as a spectator, the more power it has.\u201d\n\nA few years ago, when Barry Diller\u2014the business mogul who\u2019s worth about $4 billion\u2014came to a Chamber Magic show at the Waldorf Astoria, his reaction was one of childish wonder. It helped Cohen understand the service he was really providing\u2014and why today\u2019s global elites seem to love magic so much.\n\nDiller was sitting at the very front. During his show, Cohen regularly goes around the room to recruit volunteers, asserting his control in sometimes humorously degrading ways. On the night I attended, a quiet young man and his girlfriend sat near me, the man impassive at first. When Cohen poured a Negroni from his magical silver teakettle, he walked the drink past the audience, stopping in front of the young man to let him inspect it. \u201cDoes this smell dry and Italian,\u201d Cohen asked, \u201ckind of like you?\u201d The jab may have been a little harsh, but the man was amused and became only further engaged in the show.\n\nCohen didn\u2019t need to risk this kind of humor with Diller, who was eager to participate. \u201cAt one point,\u201d Cohen remembers, \u201cI said, \u2018I need to borrow a wristwatch from someone in the audience.\u2019 He says, \u2018Here, use mine!\u2019 I mean, it was even more expensive than the watches I wear, and I wear expensive watches. But he was so comfortable with me at that point that he just jumped up on stage. And I saw this man who is in control of a multibillion dollar business suddenly become a little boy again. I could see it in his eyes.\u201d\n\nCohen says, \u201cIt\u2019s the twinkle of possibility. Like anything can happen.\u201d\n\nHis performances are puzzle boxes, perfectly timed for the big reveal. In one trick I saw, he raised a hat to reveal that the silver coin that had been beneath it had disappeared. But this wasn\u2019t the whole of the trick. Almost as an aside\u2014although it was actually tightly scripted\u2014he looked to a young man sitting in the front row and said, \u201cThis guy\u2019s not impressed. He\u2019s like, \u2018I\u2019ll be impressed if there\u2019s a brick under there\u2019\u201d\u2014at which point Cohen raised the hat once more and, inexplicably, a red brick was indeed beneath it. When Martha Stewart played host to Cohen on one of her television shows, he asked her to remember a photo of something in one of her books, telling her that the object in that image would materialize in the picnic basket that dangled above their heads. Stewart said she had her object in mind, the basket was lowered, and a loaf of sourdough was revealed. \u201cAh ha!\u201d she said. \u201cBut I was thinking of spools of thread.\u201d But, again, the trick was not over. Cohen had her tear the bread open; there were three spools of thread, baked inside.\n\nCohen says, \u201cIt\u2019s the twinkle of possibility. Like anything can happen. They\u2019re not in control of this moment, and they want to see where it takes them. And I think that\u2019s what someone who has anything and everything so wants.\u201d\n\nBut when it comes to the wealthy, Cohen is also tapping into a deeper urge, rooted in magic\u2019s history.\n\nReligion and magic have a long and intertwined history; there is even evidence that Christ was thought of as a magician. (Cohen likes to tell a possibly apocryphal story about Catholic priests who used a trick in which they\u2019d light urns of oil on fire, which would mix with hidden urns of water so that steam passed through hidden tubes, powering a pneumatic mechanical gear network that could open enormous stone doors at the back of the church\u2014the priest would seem to have opened these heavy doors with fire from afar.) Religion is at once a feat of magic and a response to magic\u2014Christians railed against Pagan \u201cmagic\u201d while proclaiming the power of their own homegrown miracles. In 2005, the magician Brock Gill tried to replicate Jesus\u2019 famous miracles for a BBC/Discovery Channel documentary, successfully turning water to wine and walking on water. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that there was some type of trick because I was able to do it,\u201d Gill said.\n\nMagic has also historically shared elements with the wondrous field of science. The two intermingled up to the eighteenth century, with John Maynard Keynes famously referring to Isaac Newton as \u201cnot the first of the Age of Reason,\u201d but, rather, \u201cthe last of the magicians.\u201d Modernity truly appeared, Max Weber once wrote, with the \u201celimination of magic from the world.\u201d As rationalism triumphed and everyday life was drained of magic, it became something more of an entertainment, to be recreated in theatrical environments.\n\nThrough the Renaissance, magicians tended to work in traveling fairs and in informal settings. It wasn\u2019t until the early eighteenth century that magic shows shifted from low-key public events for the popular classes to respected, private events for affluent patrons. Isaac Fawkes, a British showman, was one of the first to spot this trend, promoting his magic shows with detailed descriptions and probably false claims, including that he\u2019d privately performed for King George II, in order to reach a more rarefied audience. \u201cHe throws up a Pack of Cards, and causes them to be living birds flying about the room,\u201d one of Fawkes\u2019 advertisements from the 1720s read. \u201cHe causes living Beasts, Birds, and other Creatures to appear upon the Table. He blows the spots of the Cards off and on, and changes them to any pictures.\u201d\n\nIn 1845, Jean Eug\u00e8ne Robert-Houdin, a clockmaker and magician who would serve as Harry Houdini\u2019s namesake, opened a magic theater in Paris, solidifying the shift from magic as public, roving performance art to box office\u2013style entertainment for the middle to upper classes, more akin to opera or ballet but with a vaudevillian bent. \u201cHe took magicians away from the gaudy costumes and put them into evening clothes, adding class and grace to magic,\u201d said Posnanski.\n\nMagic as we know it took root alongside the decline of royalty and a turn toward democracy. Magic, today, presents itself as both a return to pre-Newtonian possibility\u2014in which witches and religion and magic were a part of everyday life\u2014and to a time when social elites were wholly unchallenged in their power and status. In addition to possessing superhuman magical talents, Cohen has masterfully exploited the psychological space his shows create: Close-up magic, in grand, ornate rooms befitting presidents and tycoons, recreates an era in which wealth and culture were closely linked\u2014as were wealth and near-infinite possibility.\n\nMagic, today, presents itself as a return to a time when social elites were wholly unchallenged in their power and status.\n\nIf the rich still rule the world, they no longer do so with the impunity they formerly enjoyed. Even card-carrying members of the Republican Party rail against global \u201celites,\u201d while cultural institutions have started to shun their patronage. For every Koch-funded monument to the arts, there is a call to remove the Sacklers\u2019 engraved names from the Met or a (successful) campaign to kick a multimillionaire weapons-manufacturer off the board of the Whitney or a boycott of fitness and sports chains owned by Trump donor Stephen Ross. The horizons for the ultra-wealthy have become ever so crabbed, which is why so many plutocrats, from Elon Musk to Richard Branson to Jeff Bezos, have set their sights on space. But they can no longer expect to command a country\u2019s politics and culture like, say, the Medicis. The power of wealth today is quite different from the power of wealth generations ago. But, if anything, this fall from public favor has only helped Cohen\u2019s business: The very rich want to escape modernity more than ever before, to a place where anything\u2014anything at all\u2014is still possible.\n\nMagic for the very rich has become increasingly popular in the last few years. There are similar shows now at the luxury Nomad hotel, the Players Theatre, and the McKittrick Hotel. The great irony of Cohen\u2019s show\u2014and all of these apparent copycat shows\u2014however, is that although he often performs for the wealthy, most of his money is still made through New Yorkers and tourists who come to his show, thanks largely to Chamber Magic\u2019s long-held and much-coveted spot at the top of TripAdvisor\u2019s \u201cconcerts and shows\u201d vertical in New York City.\n\n\n\nCohen\u2019s branding as the Millionaires\u2019 Magician, while attractive to the rich, is perhaps more of a way to market his performance to the common classes. Millionaires and billionaires don\u2019t fill up 60 seats for five performances a week in a Midtown hotel. Older couples from out of town, lingerers at the downstairs bar, guests of the hotel, and New Yorkers on a date night are the majority of his nightly audience.\n\nCohen\u2019s magic is a way for the very rich to once more inhabit an invitingly gilded past. But for everyone else, his performances are what marketing wizards call an aspirational good\u2014a conjuring trick that allows the viewer to feel, for an evening at least, surrounded by original nineteenth-century rococo paintings and ornate ceilings, rich oneself. \u201cSymbolically, the word \u2018millionaire\u2019 isn\u2019t just about money,\u201d said Levy. \u201cIt\u2019s about excellence, refinement, and access to things that most people don\u2019t ever get a chance to see.\u201d\n\nCohen would know. His business really began to pick up in 2005 when he was featured in Forbes\u2019 \u201c400 Richest Americans\u201d issue, not primarily for his personal wealth but for his ability to get wealthy people to see his shows. (\u201cSteve Cohen knows lots of neat tricks, like how to get hired by people with deep pockets.\u201d) Suddenly, he could see his own aspirational dreams come true. \u201cI could afford the nice clothes and the nice watches and all the trappings. So it didn\u2019t look like I was putting anything on,\u201d he says. Each show he wore a beautiful tuxedo with tails. He got to wear his Patek Phillipe. He made regular audience members feel that they were in a rarefied setting, while, in his mind, he was on the same level as his ultra-wealthy clients. These days it\u2019s difficult to tell where \u201cSteve Cohen\u201d ends and where \u201cSteve Cohen the Millionaires\u2019 Magician\u201d begins\u2014just as it\u2019s also become all but impossible to parse the distinction between performing for the decadently rich and being the decadently rich.\n\nAs we are getting ready to leave the Rarities bar, he stands up to button his jacket, once more wrapping himself in his Herm\u00e8s lining. He says, \u201cNow I\u2019m like one of my clients. I\u2019m at the same level. It feels great. It\u2019s very satisfying. It\u2019s very rewarding.\u201d But there will be no rest for Cohen. He has another set of shows that weekend. There are people to be entertained\u2014a vision of marvelous possibility to be unlocked for a few; a dream of mere riches for nearly everyone else.", "description": "Steve Cohen, a.k.a. the Millionaires' Magician, has made a killing doing parlor magic for the wealthy\u2014revealing the dreams and aspirations of those who already have everything.", "authors": ["Cody Delistraty"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/1f5125e11e48d4d1eddc640ca52a7ef6a84c5b75.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg"}
