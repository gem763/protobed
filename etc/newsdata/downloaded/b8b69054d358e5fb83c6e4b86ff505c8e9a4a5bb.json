He was going to be terminated.\u201d\n\nHe also added, \u201cI was sick to my stomach when I heard this. \u2026 We were all appalled.\u201d\n\nRELATED: After 6-Year-Old Girl Arrested for Tantrum at School, Angry Family Speaks Out: \u2018A Literal Mugshot\u2019\n\nAs a reserve officer, Turner served at the will of the chief of police \u2014 meaning Rol\u00f3n had the authority to fire him before the end of the investigation, the chief told NBC.\n\nThe Orlando Police Department did not immediately respond to PEOPLE\u2019s request for comment.\n\nOn Thursday, Sept. 19, Turner arrested two 6-year-olds, one boy and one girl, in two separate incidents at Lucious and Emma Nixon Academy in Orlando, despite the principal\u2019s request not to do so, The New York Times reported.\n\n\u201cI was sick to my stomach when I heard this,\u201d Chief Rol\u00f3n told the outlet. \u201cWe could not fathom the idea of a 6-year-old being put in the back of a police car.\u201d\n\nThe young girl\u2019s grandmother spoke out after the incident, telling WKMG that she had received a call from Turner after her granddaughter allegedly kicked a staff member while acting out in class. He then told her that he would be arresting the young girl for battery.\n\n\u201cNo 6-year-old child should be able to tell somebody that they had handcuffs on them and they were riding in a police car to be fingerprinted (and have a) mugshot (taken),\u201d Meralyn Kirkland told WKMG about her granddaughter, Kaia Rolle on Friday.\n\nWKMG-TV More\n\nAccording to NBC, the other 6-year-old boy was arrested and processed in a separate incident, and later released to a relative.\n\nThe children were both charged with misdemeanor battery, though State Attorney for the Ninth Judicial Circuit Aramis D. Ayala told reporters Monday that her office had no intention of prosecuting the children.\n\nRELATED: Louisiana Police Officer Fired After Saying Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Should Be Shot\n\n\u201cI refuse to knowingly play any role in the school-to-prison pipeline at any age,\u201d Ayala said. \u201cThese very young children are to be protected, nurtured and disciplined in a manner that does not rely on the criminal justice system to do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not a reflection of the children, but more of a reflection of a broken system that needs reform,\u201d Ayala added.\n\nIn the news conference on Monday, Rol\u00f3n also apologized to the families involved and the community for the breach of trust.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of myself and the entire Orlando Police Department, I apologize to the children involved and their families,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a grandfather of three children less than 11 years old, I can only imagine how traumatic this was for everyone involved.\u201d", "description": "Officer Fired After Arresting 6-Year-Olds", "authors": ["Claudia Harmata"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/PSLZmIlIrgeyjwquDpb4RQ--~B/aD0yNzAwO3c9MTgwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/31319d1e7c3fa01eb455fb3d9753a639", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
