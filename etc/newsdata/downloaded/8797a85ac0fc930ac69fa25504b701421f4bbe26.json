He died in in 1997 aged 68.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nDemi would eat at Mirabelle restaurant, which was run by Doumas, with her mother.\n\nHe soon started turning up at her school and later raped her at her flat, she said.\n\nAfterwards he asked her: \"How does it feel to be wh***d out for $500?\"\n\nIt is not believed she reported the attack to the police.\n\n(Image: Good Morning Amercia)\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nGeorge Germanides, who ran the Mirabelle restaurant with Doumas, told the Sun on Sunday : \"His real name was Basil and his nickname was always Val. He was a sort of silent partner of mine from 1974. He had a lot of money.\n\n\"I bought him out after seven years.\"\n\nHe said he had \"no idea\" if Demi's allegations are true.\n\n(Image: Good Morning Amercia)\n\nLast month Demi said her mum, who was an alcoholic, started taking her out to bars to get attention from men when she was very young.\n\nBut she also said she doesn't think her mum had sold her to the police.\n\nSpeaking on Good Morning America, Demi explained: \"I think in my deep heart, no. I don't think it was a straight forward transaction but she still did give him the access and put me in harm's way.\"", "description": "Demi, 56, has identified her attacker as Basil Doumas, who died in 1997 and would have been 48 when he raped her", "authors": ["Molly Pike", "Image", "Reuters", "Good Morning Amercia"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20525299.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Actors-Demi-Moore-and-Ashton-Kutcher-announce-the-launch-of-their-Real-Men-campaign-at-a-news-conf.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
