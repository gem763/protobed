Until roughly two years ago, violators of the statute, known as the Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA, typically received only an administrative slap on the wrist.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Us Politics Gregory-Craig-Acquitted.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
