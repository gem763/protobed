(I hate to think how many people walked by the fishbowl window of our Food Lab and wondered what was wrong with the woman weeping as if it was the opening few minutes of \u201cUp.\u201d) Despite the waterworks, it\u2019s hard to resist the result: a rich, fragrant, deeply colored pot of comfort. The best renditions are so beautiful, they might bring a tear to your eye \u2014 at least metaphorically.\n\n[The secret to a deeply flavorful vegetarian soup: Dried porcini mushrooms]\n\nThat\u2019s the kind of recipe I\u2019m presenting you with today. Even better, this Fast French Onion Soup from kitchen wizard and Serious Eats chief culinary adviser J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt is speedier than a traditional preparation, and it doesn\u2019t sacrifice flavor in the interest of time. His method, which I culled from his impressive 2015 cookbook, \u201cThe Food Lab,\u201d uses sugar, baking powder and increased heat to speed up the onion caramelization process. The sugar (only 1 tablespoon, don\u2019t worry!) contributes sweeter, deeper, faster-developing flavor. Baking powder speeds up browning (that Maillard reaction you may have heard about) and leads to softer onions by breaking down the cells faster. And heat? Well, naturally, food cooks faster at a higher temperature, and the addition of water here reduces the risk of burning and better distributes all the sugars. As the subtitle of the book says, \u201cbetter home cooking through science.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re willing to put in the work to make French onion soup the traditional way,\u201d as in several hours, \u201cit does develop different flavors,\u201d L\u00f3pez-Alt told me. They\u2019re not necessarily flavors that are better or worse than with the quicker approach. But will most people be able to tell the difference when this recipe takes only around half an hour to caramelize the onions? (If you\u2019re as deliberate with a knife as I am, it might take you less time to caramelize than to slice the 5 pounds of them.) Certainly not, and it might not even be discernible to a typical palate in a side-by-side tasting. \u201cThey\u2019re both good; they\u2019re just a little different,\u201d L\u00f3pez-Alt says.\n\n\u201cDifferent\u201d might not be the first word that comes to mind when you taste this soup. \u201cLike velvet\u201d was one taster\u2019s observation, with the rest of the sentiments falling somewhere between \u201camazing\u201d and \u201choly cow.\u201d Speaking of cow \u2026 the deeply caramelized onions created such a rich, dark liquid that it prompted some to wonder whether the soup had been made with beef broth. Nope. I got stunning results using a good store-bought chicken broth. And it wouldn\u2019t be a huge leap to make this with a good vegetable broth if you prefer to keep things meatless. \u201cThe broth is very important,\u201d L\u00f3pez-Alt says, but that does not mean you have to abandon the prospect of French onion soup at home if you don\u2019t have homemade broth. If you do, great. If not, I\u2019m not sure you\u2019d be able to tell the difference there, either, when the onions do so much of the work for you.\n\nCooking the onions at a higher temperature requires a bit more hands-on work, as you have to make sure you aren\u2019t burning them or the flavorful browning on the bottom of the pan. The goal is to get everything as dark as possible without it turning black, L\u00f3pez-Alt says. Medium-high is a relatively safe heat. Even then, you might have to make adjustments, depending on your pan and stove top. You also must be vigilant about stirring the onions every few minutes, which is another safeguard, with the water, against scorching. It\u2019s how you achieve even, robust color, as well.\n\nThe only way a whole pot of this oniony bliss gets any better is if you top each portion with toasted bread and a generous layer of cheese. Tears of joy? Fine by me.\n\nRecipe notes: The soup is satisfying enough to serve as a main course but is just as welcome as a side or first course. If you don\u2019t have broiler-safe bowls for serving, broil the slices of cheese-covered bread on a sheet pan before floating them on top of the soup.\n\nThe soup can be refrigerated for up to 1 week or frozen, ideally flat in zip-top bags, for several months.\n\nScale and get a printer-friendly version of the recipe here.\n\nIngredients\n\n1 tablespoon sugar\n\n5 pounds yellow onions, thinly sliced\n\n2 tablespoons unsalted butter\n\n1/4 teaspoon baking powder\n\n2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more as needed\n\n1/2 cup water\n\n1/4 cup dry sherry\n\n6 cups homemade or low-sodium chicken broth\n\n2 bay leaves\n\n6 to 8 sprigs fresh thyme\n\nFreshly ground black pepper\n\n1 baguette, sliced 1-inch thick and toasted\n\n8 ounces Gruy\u00e8re or Swiss cheese, grated\n\nSteps\n\nStep 1\n\nPour the sugar into a large Dutch oven and cook over medium-high heat, swirling the pot gently as the sugar melts, until it is completely liquid and a golden-brown caramel. Add the onions and cook, stirring with a wooden spoon and tossing constantly until they are evenly coated in the caramel, about 30 seconds. Add the butter, baking powder and 2 teaspoons salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are a light golden brown and a brown coating has started to build up on the bottom of the pot, about 10 minutes.\n\nDid you make this recipe?

Shake the pot to distribute the onions evenly over the bottom and cook, shaking occasionally, until the liquid evaporates and the browned coating starts to build up again, about 5 minutes. Add 2 more tablespoons water and repeat, allowing the coating to build up and scraping it off, then repeat two more times. (Reduce the heat as needed if the coating is burning and turning black.) By this point, the onions should be deep brown. If not, continue deglazing and stirring until the deep brown color is reached.\n\nStep 3\n\nAdd the sherry, chicken broth, bay leaves and thyme, bring to a boil, and reduce the heat to low, so the soup is at a gentle simmer. Simmer, uncovered, until the liquid is deeply flavored and slightly reduced, about 15 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Discard the bay leaves and thyme.\n\nStep 4\n\nTo serve, heat the broiler. Ladle the soup into four broiler-proof bowls. Float 1 or 2 bread slices on top of each bowl and cover with the grated cheese. Broil until the cheese is melted, bubbly and golden brown in spots. Serve immediately.\n\nAdapted from \u201cThe Food Lab: Better Home Cooking Through Science\u201d by J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt (W.W.
