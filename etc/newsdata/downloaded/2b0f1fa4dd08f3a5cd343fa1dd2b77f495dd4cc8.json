The Russia-collusion hoax, Ukraine-gate, Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation circus, all of the non-stop, relentless attacks on Donald Trump and his administration from the day he was sworn in were bound to happen.\n\nThe political moment we are living through is not the usual one. This is more than the corporate leftist media and Democratic attacks to which we\u2019ve become accustomed against any Republican, including the usual tripe about how Bush or (pick a name) is a Nazi and the election of said Republican signals the end of days. This with Trump is about so much more.\n\nJames Piereson described it best this week at a conference co-sponsored by American Greatness and The New Criterion: we\u2019re used to domestic politics, where the discussions are over the size of tax cuts, etc. What we are seeing today is vicious regime politics and a struggle over who is really in charge of this country\u2019s governmental agencies. The duly elected president of the United States? Or players inside of that administrative state, along with their mouthpieces in the media?\n\nNone of these absurd fairytales of collusion were ever really about actual suspicions that Trump was somehow tied to Putin. (Though certainly many Americans bought the story.) The breathless nonstop reporting by the corporate leftist media can be explained by one of two possible causes either they are too stupid to understand what is actually taking place (a perfectly reasonable argument) or they are part and parcel of the attempted regime change from the start.\n\nThis is all about who truly decides.\n\nThe only surprise is that we didn\u2019t reach this moment sooner as a country. It took an outsider\u2014someone not from Washington, D.C. and not from the ruling class\u2014to be elected president.\n\nTrump was never \u201cread into\u201d how it\u2019s \u201call supposed to work,\u201d how \u201cthings are done in D.C.\u201d No, he had the temerity to show up and think that maybe, just maybe, we are still a democratic, constitutional republic in which power still flows from \u201cWe the People\u201d to our president and other elected officials. In response to this sensible and very American view of things, the ruling class and administrative state emphatically said, \u201cWe don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\nA Constitutional Republic No More\n\nIt is becoming apparent that for many inside Washington, D.C., elections and the peaceful transfer of power are quaint notions of yesterday\u2019s republic. Presidents, administrations, and their political appointees come and go but the permanent governing class remains. It\u2019s not really that much of a surprise that they think they\u2019re in charge, as for generations the administrative state has expanded and more and more power as been ceded to it and to them.\n\nThis didn\u2019t just happen yesterday. We\u2019ve arrived here by degrees.\n\nThe pivot away from America as a constitutional republic and into a country run as an administrative state began in the late 1800s, especially if one looks at Woodrow Wilson\u2019s The Study of Administration, written in 1887. Wilson argued that politics should be kept separate from administration, though to be fair, administration shouldn\u2019t completely ignore public opinion. But Wilson and other Progressives\u2014Democrat and Republican alike\u2014truly believed that efficient administration was a far better approach for \u201cprogress\u201d than the sometimes messy, gridlock approach of the constitutional republic.\n\nWilson\u2019s ideas, and other progressive fever dreams, would be given life in the first Progressive Era between 1895 and 1920, when the progressive ideology took firm root in both the Democratic and Republican parties. The administrative state was born and then firmly entrenched during Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s administration with the New Deal. Progressives believed real progress could only occur if power is consolidated into an administrative state run by an educated cadre of bureaucrats who had as little interference from politicians as possible. They made the fatal mistake of entrusting great power to imperfect human beings, something the Founders, who knew men weren\u2019t angels, wisely feared. Our Founders did not trust consolidated power in the hands of imperfect human nature, thus the machinery of our republic; separation of powers, federalism, and so on.\n\nOnly One Choice\n\nThe political torment we are experiencing today is, in many ways, the logical endgame to all of this.\n\nThere is an inherent tension between having an administrative state inside of a constitutional republic: the larger and more powerful that state becomes, the less likely it is to accept the restrictions placed upon it by republican institutions.\n\nIn fact, the two approaches to governing are completely incompatible. Even worse, those inside a powerful administrative state, much like the one we have today with over 430 departments, agencies and sub-agencies filled with millions of career employees, think that they are the decision makers on the domestic and foreign policy fronts. They believe they are entitled to rule us.\n\nThe question for us now as a country is, \u201cWhich direction are we going to go?\u201d We really are at a crossroads. We cannot take the tension any longer: we must choose. Either we are governed by an administrative state that is not accountable to the political process spelled out by our Constitution or we return to the constitutional republic intended by the Founders. Fundamentally that is what all of this is about. The tension has broken into the open because Trump has forced the issue.\n\nFor those of us who believe in the original meaning of our Constitution, in limited government and natural rights, there is only one choice: break the state. Devolve it, not only in size, but also its purposes. Get it out of D.C.. Break its power base.\n\nThere can only be one winner in this struggle between Trump and the administrative state if we have any hopes for the republic surviving and that is the duly elected president of the United States who is the only one in this fight who represents the sovereign American people. If you think the state actors somehow are going to surrender, think again. Get ready for some more fireworks: the next year is going to be yet another bumpy, ugly ride.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://amgreatness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-wpt053-e1571458527807.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
