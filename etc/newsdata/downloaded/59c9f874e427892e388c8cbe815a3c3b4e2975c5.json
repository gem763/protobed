He honed his hot-stepping skills running round the streets of Kraaifontein, a Cape Town suburb.\n\nCheslin Kolbe is the 5ft 7in, 11st 9lb cousin of Olympic 400m champion Wayde van Niekerk\n\nMakazole Mapimpi has scored more tries than he has played Tests for South Africa\n\nAnd Mapimpi, whose surname translates loosely from Xhosa to 'cobra', has gone in three years from playing in front of 3,500 fans in the Currie Cup for the Border Bulldogs to becoming a World Cup superstar.\n\nMapimpi has scored more tries than he has played Tests \u2014 13 in 12 internationals, including five tries in Japan to top the tournament charts alongside Wales's Josh Adams and Brave Blossom Kotaro Matsushima.\n\nMapimpi only made his Test debut last year, against Wales in the low-key match in Washington DC, scoring a try in the two-point defeat.\n\nShaun Edwards, the Wales defence coach, is very wary of him and Kolbe. 'Out wide they've got incredible speed,' he said.\n\n'If there was a 4x100m relay race with all the teams in the World Cup, they would probably be the fastest. They have blowtorch speed on the edges.'\n\nEdwards reserved his highest praise for Kolbe, the 25-year-old Toulouse winger who won an Olympic bronze medal with the South African Sevens team at the 2016 Games, and compared him to an England great.\n\nShaun Edwards, Wales' defence coach, is very wary of the pair ahead of the semi-final\n\n'If you want to watch a game of rugby, you want to go and watch Cheslin Kolbe,' Edwards said. 'We'll have to keep an eye on him. He's one of the most dynamic players I've ever seen.\n\n'I was lucky enough to play with Jason Robinson for many years, I was his captain at Wigan when he first came in the team there. Kolbe is a similar player to Jason; incredibly explosive, short and defies the notion that you have to be big to play rugby. It's a game with all shapes and sizes. Let's hope that continues.'\n\nKolbe was left out by previous size-obsessed Springbok coaches. Some told him he would never make it, others tried to move him to scrum-half.\n\nBut current coach Rassie Erasmus handed him a lifeline in the 2018 Rugby Championship and Kolbe scored a key try when South Africa beat New Zealand 36-34 in Wellington.\n\nThe Boks faced the All Blacks again in the opening game at this World Cup and, despite losing 23-13, Kolbe tore them to shreds, running 124 metres and beating 11 defenders. It is his elusiveness that sets him apart from the rest.\n\nEdwards reserved high praise for Kolbe, comparing him to former team-mate Jason Robinson\n\nKolbe might be the smallest winger at the World Cup, but he packs a serious punch. 'There is a saying that dynamite comes in small packages,' he said.\n\nMapimpi is bigger and older, aged 29, but he never thought he would make the Test grade.\n\nHis story is one of hardship and hard work. Mapimpi's mother, brother and sister have all died. Eunice, his mother, was killed in a car crash, his sister Zukiswa died suddenly, too, and brother Zolani never recovered from losing a leg when electrocuted while stealing electricity cables.\n\nA fly-half as a youngster, Mapimpi struggled to progress in an area not regarded as a traditional rugby heartland. He is from the Eastern Cape villages of Tsholomnqa and in his late teens played for a team named the Vultures.\n\nBut eventually he was discovered, went through the famous Craven Week trials and in 2014 went on to the Bulldogs as an amateur winger. He was at the Southern Kings Super Rugby side two years ago, before playing a season in the Pro14 with the Cheetahs.\n\nA move to the Natal Sharks saw him appear on Erasmus' radar, and, since his Test debut in June 2018, Mapimpi has failed to score a try in only four of his 12 Tests. At the World Cup, he has scored two against Namibia, one against Italy and two in the win over Japan in the quarter-finals.\n\nHaving teamed up with Kolbe, the pair are primed to take on the world.", "description": "WILL KELLEHER IN TOYKO: If Wales are to realise their World Cup dream they first have to deal with the pocket rocket and the snake-hipped sensation.", "authors": ["Will Kelleher For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/22/20056766-0-image-a-9_1571780149565.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
