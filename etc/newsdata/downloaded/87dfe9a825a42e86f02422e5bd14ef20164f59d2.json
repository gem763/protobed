My 17-year manhunt for a $50m art criminal", "language": "en", "text": "For years, documentary-maker Vanessa Engle has been on the trail of a notorious swindler who escaped from prison and disappeared into thin air. Then one day, the phone rang ...\n\nYou probably haven\u2019t heard of Michel Cohen. Do a search and you get Michael Cohen, the Trump fixer who went to jail. Wrong one. Though this one did go to jail, too. He\u2019s French, born in 1953 on an estate in a poor suburb of Paris and his first job was to sell the Encyclopedia Britannica door-to-door, which he was very good at.\n\nCohen later went to the US and started selling French pat\u00e9, then prints. He got into the art world, became a dealer, sold Picassos, Monets, Chagalls. For a while he lived the dream, drove fast cars, had a house in Malibu with his German wife and two kids, a chef, horses, everything. He got into the options market. That didn\u2019t go so well, so he got into debt. Cohen started to put loans and artworks that weren\u2019t his into the market; the hole got bigger and bigger. In the end he disappeared, having swindled the New York art world out of $50m.\n\nThat was in 2001. Vanessa Engle, the documentary maker (The Funeral Murders, The Cult Next Door, Women, Jews, Lefties, loads of other brilliant stuff) was making arts documentaries at the time. She clocked the story as one to keep an eye on.\n\nAnd she did \u2026 for 17 years. \u201cNobody knew where he had gone; he had just vanished with his wife and kids,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought it was an interesting story, but I didn\u2019t have a way in. The art world is very secretive, they don\u2019t like to talk, especially if they have just been ripped off to the tune of many millions. It\u2019s a world built on trust. Clients are not going to want to know a dealer of a gallery that could so easily be defrauded.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re in a north London pub, and Engle is telling me about her manhunt: the search for Cohen. \u201cI\u2019ve searched his name online every two or three months for 17 years.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018He just vanished\u2019 ...

Cohen had been arrested, by Interpol, in Rio de Janeiro; he was in jail in Brazil. \u201cI thought OK, now\u2019s my chance, maybe the Brazilian authorities will let me into the prison, I can get the whole story, it\u2019s going to happen,\u201d says Engle, reliving the excitement.\n\nShe was on another project, but there was no hurry because he would be in prison for a long time. Then, later that year, she searched again and \u2026 he had escaped! The story just got better \u2013 Papillon meets The Goldfinch meets The Great Train Robbery. But it had also gone cold. \u201cI thought: oh, I\u2019ve missed it.\u201d\n\nThe trail stayed cold for years, although Engle never forgot about Cohen. In 2017 she spoke to a commissioning editor at the BBC. She didn\u2019t think she would find him, didn\u2019t even know if he was alive, but she could talk to his friends, and people in the art world.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve often said I should have been a policeman because what we do is the same,\u201d she says. \u201cWe gather clues to put together a plausible story, and find witnesses who can testify to that story.\u201d\n\nYet Engle argues she\u2019s not really the detective in this story. \u201cI\u2019m good at getting people on board, mapping the story, but if it was not for Billie \u2026\u201d Billie is Billie Shepherd, the producer Engle hired because she worked on Who Do You Think You Are? and knows how to find people. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to fall out with Billie,\u201d says Engle. \u201cShe will track you down.\u201d\n\nThey made a timeline of transactions, paintings, swindles and people; it ran to more than 100 pages. They called in legal documents from the US and Brazil, sometimes getting people to go to court and photocopy them.\n\nOnce they had names and addresses, they made a big drawing: Cohen in the middle, then his inner circle of family and close friends (people such as Richard Roy, who plays a big part in the film), followed by an outer circle of those he had done business with or ripped off.\n\nThen Engle wrote letters to them. She had heard rumours there were people who wanted to have Cohen assassinated. \u201cThere are people in the art world who have mafia connections, laundering money,\u201d says Engle. \u201cIt\u2019s actually quite a dirty business. In the end, I was convinced there are people who would know where to get a hitman.\u201d Or he might just be dead; he would be in his mid-60s.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Vanessa Engle: \u2018I should have been a policeman.\u2019 Photograph: Johann Perry/BBC/Top Hat\n\nShe concentrated on the outer circle first, fearful that someone near Cohen would tip him off and cause him to run. They got some hits: old acquaintances who agreed to talk, dealers, just about enough to make a film. \u201cThen we thought, we\u2019ve got nothing to lose, and pressed go on that last lot of letters, including ones we hoped might get to his family and \u2013 maybe \u2013 him.\u201d\n\nEngle waited. There was no response from Cohen\u2019s sister, but they got Roy, Cohen\u2019s friend and business partner, who had gone to the US with him and set up the pat\u00e9 business. \u201cWhen we got him, me and Billie were just screaming,\u201d says Engle.\n\nThen, one day, Engle was at home when the phone rang. \u201cThis woman said: \u2018My name is blablabla\u2019 [she doesn\u2019t want me to know the woman\u2019s name]. I was distracted, I didn\u2019t know if it was the wrong number, or someone asking if I was satisfied with my gas supply,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI can be slightly brusque, so I said: \u2018Sorry, who is this?\u2019\u201d\n\nIt was Cohen\u2019s wife, who had also gone to Brazil with the two kids, had a third there, then had a really tough time after he was arrested. She was going to be able to fill in the missing pieces, perhaps even lead Engle to the man himself.\n\nCohen\u2019s wife was very nervous. She said she couldn\u2019t really talk on the phone, didn\u2019t say anything about where Cohen was or whether he was still alive, but did agree to meet in a cafe. Not in London, but a different country \u2013 and Engle was to come alone. The BBC weren\u2019t happy about that, so a colleague went as well, pretending not to be there, tracking Engle\u2019s phone.\n\nMrs Cohen, it turns out, was \u201clovely, sweet and warm\u201d. She talked for hours. Now, would she do it on camera? Absolutely not. Uh oh. It is a shame, but not the end of the world, because ... well, it\u2019s in the film.\n\nWhich is fabulous; a stonkingly good romp. Not a million miles away from the Netflix Fyre festival documentary, but with more personality, motifs and metaphors running through it. \u201cAnd we got the guy!\u201d says Engle. \u201cThere has been a whole spate of these films where you have a central protagonist who\u2019s done something really wrong, but it\u2019s very rare to get the guy.\u201d\n\nOops, spoiler alert. Actually, not such a spoiler: he\u2019s there, right at the beginning of the film. He was there in that cafe, too. \u201cA small man shuffled up to the table, unshaven, his hair was quite long, wearing a scruffy sweatshirt,\u201d says Engle. \u201cI thought: is that the guy I\u2019ve been looking for for 17 years?\u201d And it was.\n\n\u2022 The $50m Art Swindle is on BBC Two on 23 September 2019 at 9pm.", "description": "For years, documentary-maker Vanessa Engle has been on the trail of a notorious swindler who escaped from prison and disappeared into thin air.
