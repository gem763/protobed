The deals in some cases helped to fill its newer office spaces, as the company went on a growth binge that added more than 400 new locations over three years.\n\nIncentives are relatively common in the real estate industry to fill new buildings. Fuller, thriving buildings are often seen as more attractive to would-be tenants, which don't want to be left isolated in a large, relatively empty space. That's especially true for WeWork, which made a sense of community and an opportunity to network a part of its pitch to potential new arrivals.\n\nWeWork's ability to quickly attract tenants to its new buildings was a core part of its pitch to Wall Street investors, too. Although its spaces incur losses in the first year or so after it signs a lease, they quickly become money makers because they rapidly reach high occupancy levels and stay that way, it said in its IPO paperwork.\n\nHowever, little has been revealed about how exactly WeWork filled these buildings so quickly. WeWork has said in its S-1 filing that it had in some cases used discounts as it opened new locations at a faster rate or to encourage longer contract terms.\n\nThat filing came as WeWork was still publicly committed to aggressive growth under cofounder and now-former CEO Adam Neumann.\n\nAt least one commercial real estate industry executive familiar with the arrangements said these kinds of deals were possibly loss-making for WeWork. \"There's not enough [profit] margin to give a 50% discount and you're not underwater,\" the executive said.\n\nAs the company's new management team shifts its focus to shoring up WeWork's financials following the ousting of Neumann, it's possible these kinds of deals could be reassessed. WeWork has now shelved its IPO indefinitely, and told The Wall Street Journal last week that it expects the pace of entering new lease agreements to slow as it pursues \"more strategic growth.\"\n\nA WeWork representative declined to comment.\n\nWeWork resorted to particularly generous promotions to land tenants in new locations\n\nIn trying to fill up its new spaces, WeWork sales reps in some cases resorted to particularly generous promotions, those familiar with the deals said, offering discounts to both new clients, and existing customers.\n\nThe starting point for the discounts for existing tenants was one free month off a year-long contract, but account executives or salespeople could offer even more generous terms or different kinds of incentives, such as reducing the monthly rent or offering additional credits for things like supplies and services, a former New York-based WeWork sales representative said.\n\nIn other cases, WeWork sales reps reached out to companies in existing locations that were on discounted deals that were set to expire, said the commercial real estate industry executive. It agreed to extend those deals if the companies agreed to relocate to new locations with low occupancy levels, the executive said.\n\nUnder the deals, the tenants could pay half the going rate for their spaces \u2014 or less, the executive said. By moving, the companies were \"able to perpetuate those discounts,\" the executive said.\n\nAlternatively, tenants could get a bigger office at the lower-demand location than they had at the higher demand one at the same or lower cost, the former sales representative said.\n\n\"Anything to get the deal done,\" the sales representative said.\n\nWeWork offered such promotions to convince existing tenants to relocate \"a bunch of times,\" said a former employee who worked in the company's New York headquarters.\n\nTraditional landlords sometimes take similar steps when they open new buildings or locations, said Jeff Langbaum, a real-estate analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nBut in the traditional office space market, leases cover multiple years \u2014 at least three and often much longer. Generally, landlords balance initial discounts with higher rents later on that pay for them. By contrast, WeWork's customers typically sign only short-term leases, giving the company little time to make back discounts.\n\nThe average lease commitment of WeWork's customers is for only 15 months and many customers can break their deals with only a month's notice, the company said in its IPO paperwork.\n\nBecause of that, there's no real economic advantage for WeWork to shift tenants from older to newer facilities, said Langbaum. The only benefit it would seem to get is to show higher occupancy levels at its newer sites, he said.\n\nWithin 18 months of being open to occupants, the average WeWork space is 89% full, the company said in its IPO filing. The space is generally still at that occupancy level after two years, it said in the filing.\n\nWeWork didn't disclose any specific details about the occupancy levels of locations that have been open for longer than two years. The company considers such spaces \"mature,\" with \"generally stable\" occupancy levels, it said in its IPO paperwork.\n\nWhat WeWork offers is \"a short-term lease that may very well wind up with nothing left at the end of it,\" Langbaum said, making it seem like the company is \"basically just playing a numbers game.\"\n\nGot a tip about WeWork or another company?
