REUTERS/Huseyin Aldemir/File Photo/File Photo\n\nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence announced the five-day pause in Turkey\u2019s cross-border assault after more than four hours of talks on Thursday at Erdogan\u2019s presidential palace in Ankara - a meeting that began inauspiciously with stony faces and few smiles.\n\nDespite the sombre start, officials from both sides say a draft accord had already been sketched out ahead of the meeting, but crucial obstacles remained ahead of a deal to halt the latest battle in Syria\u2019s ruinous eight-year civil war.\n\nThe goal was to stem a fresh humanitarian crisis which has put 200,000 civilians to flight in northeast Syria and ease a security scare over thousands of Islamic State captives guarded by the Kurdish militia targeted in Turkey\u2019s assault.\n\nAlso in the balance were fractious ties between Turkey and the United States, two NATO allies whose disputes over Syria policy and Russia led U.S. President Donald Trump to announce sanctions and threaten to \u201cobliterate\u201d Turkey\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cIt was obvious that Pence\u2019s talks in Turkey would not be easy,\u201d the official told Reuters.\n\nEven before his plane landed in Ankara, Turkey had rejected Pence\u2019s call for a ceasefire unless Kurdish YPG fighters, whom it considers terrorists because of their links to guerrillas waging a deadly insurgency in southeast Turkey, agreed to withdraw from a 20-mile deep \u201csafe zone\u201d along the border.\n\n\u201cThere were many disagreements\u201d in the talks, the senior official said, declining to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter. But the central issue was Turkey\u2019s insistence that there could be no open-ended truce.\n\n\u201cThe make-or-break point in the meeting was when Erdogan demanded a deadline if they wanted the operations to be paused,\u201d he said. \u201cErdogan said it could be 24 or 48 hours. Pence said it was a very short frame and he couldn\u2019t make that decision by himself.\u201d\n\nWith the Turkish president refusing to give ground, the issue was taken up in a second, expanded meeting.\n\n\u201cFollowing discussions, a deadline of 120 hours was agreed on. Once this was settled, there was fast progress on other issues,\u201d the official said.\n\nA senior U.S. administration official said: \u201cAt one point, Erdogan asked how long it would take (the) YPG to pull out and we (the U.S. delegation) took that as a glimmer of hope that the Turks were open to a deal.\u201d\n\nBREAKING THE ICE\n\nPictures of the start of the meeting between the U.S. vice president, an evangelical Christian, and the Turkish president who leads a party with Islamist roots, suggested an awkwardness between the two men.\n\nBut early in the conversation Pence told Erdogan that Trump \u201cliked, respected and valued\u201d him, according to the Turkish official, an introduction which he said \u201cwarmed the atmosphere\u201d.\n\nAt another point in the talks, when Turkish officials cited their battle casualties in the week-old military operation, Pence told them there were military veterans in the U.S. delegation and his own son was in military service.\n\nHe conveyed U.S. condolences to those killed and to their families, a gesture which the U.S. official said appeared to move a Turkish general in the meeting.\n\nThose personal connections may have helped ease some of the tensions in a relationship frequently characterized by uncompromising rhetoric from both sides.\n\nThe agreement has de-escalated tensions in the north of Syria, but there are signs the temporary truce remains fragile.\n\nOn Friday morning, shelling could be heard near the Syrian town of Ras al Ain close to the border with Turkey, although Reuters journalists in the area said the bombardment subsided by mid-morning.\n\nAnd there was confusion over how big the \u201csafe zone\u201d is that Turkey intends to secure. Erdogan said the swathe of land ran 440 km from east to west, but U.S. special envoy for Syria, James Jeffrey, said the accord covered a smaller area.\n\nOn the eve of Thursday\u2019s talks, the White House released a letter Trump sent to Erdogan warning him on Oct. 9 - the day Turkish troops crossed into northeast Syria: \u201cDon\u2019t be a tough guy\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t be a fool\u201d, and repeating a warning that Trump could destroy Turkey\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really strange to talk to somebody like Erdogan in this tone, and expect him to accept this,\u201d a second Turkish official said.\n\nThe tone of the letter was a particular surprise in Ankara, since Turkish officials have repeatedly said that the two presidents have a strong personal bond.\n\n\u201cTrump and Erdogan would have made a deal sooner if it was up to Trump,\u201d the second official said. \u201cBut Pence made a massive contribution.\u201d", "description": "The surprise deal to suspend Turkey's military offensive against Kurdish-led forces in Syria hinged on President Tayyip Erdogan's demand that Washington agree a time limit on any ceasefire, a senior Turkish official said on Friday.", "authors": ["Orhan Coskun", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442443155&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H20Z", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
