The active and healthy couple fell pregnant naturally, and had no issues or complications during the pregnancy .\n\nHowever, after the birth of her daughter Annabelle in June 2017, Emma had to be rushed to straight to the operating theatre in hospital for the first of 10 surgeries she would need to recover after suffering second-degree multi-directional tears.\n\nA year after welcoming Annabelle into the world, Emma, 31, was diagnosed with a rectovaginal fistula (RVF) - an abnormal connection between the lower portion of the rectum and the vagina.\n\n(Image: Mercury Press & Media)\n\n(Image: Mercury Press & Media)\n\nThe fistula left the new mum in excruciating daily pain. She was unable to go anywhere without a pillow to sit on, and a five minute walk would leave her exhausted for days.\n\nShe is also being treated for post-traumatic stress disorder, and still has flashbacks from the birth.\n\nEmma said: \"I was an active person with an active job. I went to the gym and I'd socialise at the weekend.\n\n\"It was a lovely pregnancy, I didn't have any major issues.\n\n\"During labour, when it came to pushing, my legs were put in stirrups.\n\n(Image: Mercury Press & Media)\n\n(Image: Mercury Press & Media)\n\n\"There was a struggle to get the baby out and there was meconium in my waters which caused concern.\n\n\"Mark was down the business end so unfortunately for him he saw it happen, and the look of shock on the midwives' faces.\n\n\"After Annabelle was born and the doctors were repairing the damage in the first surgery, they described the tissue down there as being like 'butter' and that they were struggling to stitch it together.\n\n\"But on the ward I spoke to a midwife and knew from her expression that something was very wrong.\n\n\"I was told I'd have to go into surgery again.\n\n\"A midwife told me 'your husband loves you very much'. I asked her, 'am i going to die?' because I genuinely believed I would.\n\n(Image: Mercury Press & Media)\n\n(Image: Mercury Press & Media)\n\n\"I'm still traumatised about it. I was told over and over that they'd not seen anything like this in 30 years. I knew it was a bad situation.\n\n\"It's every mother's nightmare being separated from your baby. You want that bonding time.\"\n\nEmma was taken away for an emergency three hour procedure to repair the complicated tears before she was returned to the recovery ward.\n\nBut within hours she was back in the operating room, after doctors noticed she had developed a pelvic hematoma - when blood accumulates outside of blood vessels as a result of blood vessel damage.\n\nEmma spent a week in hospital before she was well enough to go home, but even after being discharged she was in constant pain.\n\nAlthough she had been warned she would be sore after the birth, Emma knew something wasn't right and spent hours on the Internet searching for answers.\n\n(Image: Mercury Press & Media)\n\n(Image: Mercury Press & Media)\n\nShe was even unable to have sex with her husband Mark, a solicitor, who had also been left traumatised by the birth.\n\nThe couple eventually opted for private health care and pushed for more tests, which revealed that Emma had an RVF and needed a setom - a piece of surgical thread to repair the abnormal connection.\n\nShe said: \"My day would start with excruciating pain when I went to the toilet. The pain was crippling, it would last a few hours, sometimes all day.\n\n\"Mark had to put a suit on and leave for work while I was crying out with pain.\n\n\"I just spent my days either obsessively researching or crying. I did everything that I could for Annabelle energy-wise. I would feed her and she would sleep on me and I would lie on the sofa with my phone, just trying to find some hope.\n\n(Image: Mercury Press & Media)\n\n(Image: Mercury Press & Media)\n\n\"I felt completely in the dark, that my body had failed me. I was doomed and my active life was over.\n\n\"I was worried about my marriage. I was worried if I couldn't have sex, if I couldn't have further children.\"\n\nOver time things slowly began to improve, and Emma continued to look for support online. Eventually she stumbled across the Mummy MOT - a postnatal check up programme.\n\nNow, two years later and with their specialist help, Emma is learning to manage her injuries and has a new lease of life.\n\nIn September, the determined mum had her tenth surgery, injecting steroids into her scar tissue to help with continual tightening and improving her pelvic floor.\n\nShe now attends regular physiotherapy appointments in London and was even able to go swimming in an emotional celebration of her fifth wedding anniversary in August.\n\n(Image: Mercury Press & Media)\n\n(Image: Mercury Press & Media)\n\nShe said: \"I am getting my life back. Mark and I always try to reflect over the last couple of months and look at what we've achieved.\n\n\"We had our fifth wedding anniversary at the hotel we got married, and I went swimming for the first time. I cried with happiness.\n\n\"Annabelle is just starting nursery, so I will be using my Instagram page to raise awareness.\n\n\"With my job, I can be a private tutor on evenings and weekends and a supply teacher during the week. I love being a stay-at-home mum.\n\n\"Annabelle is the most amazing little girl. We're so blessed that she's healthy and happy.\"", "description": "First-time mum Emma Reeves from Newcastle has been left in constant pain after the traumatic birth of her daughter", "authors": ["Hollie Bone", "Image", "Mercury Press", "Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20728580.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/4_PAY-CHILDBIRTH-TEAR-NEARLY-KILLED-ME.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
