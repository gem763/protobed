Sign up here.\n\nManufacturing across vast parts of Europe and Asia remain deeply mired in a crisis that took another turn for the worse over the weekend.\n\nOne day after the U.S. and China enacted new tariffs on each other\u2019s imports, factories from Germany and Italy to Japan, South Korea and Taiwan sent a gloomy reminder that they are suffering badly from increased global trade hostility. Purchasing managers\u2019 indexes for all those countries, as well as the 19-nation euro area, signal a contraction in activity.\n\nThe global growth outlook is already the lowest since the financial crisis a decade ago, and central banks have started to cut interest rates to underpin domestic momentum. With no end to the U.S.-China trade war in sight and the risk of a disorderly Brexit increasingly weighing on European sentiment, pressure may mount on policy makers to do more.\n\nECB President Mario Draghi has held out the prospect of lower interest rates and renewed asset purchases for Europe as soon as this month. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell may shed light on his intentions in a speech on Friday -- after the publication of key gauges for manufacturing and the labor market.\n\nIn Asia, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan have been hit hardest by trade tensions, a cooling technology boom and slowing demand in line with a weaker global economy. China\u2019s official manufacturing index dropped further below 50, signaling contraction, with sub-gauges showing that domestic and new overseas orders contracted.\n\nWhat Bloomberg\u2019s Economists Say\n\n\u201cAugust purchasing managers\u2019 indexes showed weakness spreading across Asia\u2019s economies...The deterioration increases pressure on Asia\u2019s authorities to step up policy support.\u201d\n\n--Chang Shu and Justin Jimenez Read the ASIA REACT\n\nThe outlook for corporate earnings has clouded in emerging markets. Analysts have cut the average profit estimate for the benchmark MSCI Emerging Markets Index for a sixth successive week, the longest streak in four years.\n\nIn Europe, manufacturers including Germany\u2019s Daimler, Italy\u2019s Pirelli and France\u2019s Renault are among those that have cut their forecasts. Factory activity in the region has shrunk for seven months, with the latest update showing order books contracted and companies shed jobs in a sign that they have excess capacity.\n\nThe headline measure for the U.K. dropped to the lowest since 2012.\n\n\u201cA marked deterioration in optimism about the year ahead suggests companies are expecting worse to come,\u201d said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.\n\nDevelopments in U.S.-China trade relations remain the dominant driver of sentiment. On Sunday, higher U.S. tariffs on roughly $110 billion in Chinese imports took effect, as did Beijing\u2019s retaliatory duties on U.S. goods.\n\n\u201cHigh uncertainty over U.S.-China trade policies, Brexit and other political and geopolitical developments continues to weigh on the global outlook,\u201d economists at Barclays wrote in a note. \u201cThe news flow leaves room for hope on potential U.S.-China or Brexit deals, but the development pattern so far makes us skeptical about any sudden solutions.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Enda Curran and Michelle Jamrisko.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Jana Randow in Frankfurt at jrandow@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Fergal O'Brien at fobrien@bloomberg.net, Zoe Schneeweiss\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars.
