The Redskins had no answer for Dak Prescott on Sunday and have allowed 63 points and 911 yards in two games. Dallas scored on five consecutive possessions after Washington took a 7-0 lead, and the Cowboys put up 474 total yards of offense while converting seven of their 11 third downs. \u201cWe have a very talented group on defense, and we\u2019re not reaching them,\u201d Redskins Coach Jay Gruden said afterward. \u201cWe have to play better, and we will play better.\u201d Will Manusky be around when they do?\n\nHail: Jet Sweeps\n\nJay Gruden\u2019s play-calling was more memorable and less predictable than usual. The Redskins dialed up a deep shot to rookie wide receiver Terry McLaurin on their first play from scrimmage, but Case Keenum underthrew the pass, which fell incomplete. Later in the first quarter, Washington ran consecutive plays with jet sweep action, giving the ball to rookie wide receiver Steven Sims both times for a combined 12 yards. It was refreshing to see Gruden\u2019s offense find creative ways to get one of the team\u2019s quickest players involved, and it\u2019s likely the result of first-year offensive coordinator Kevin O\u2019Connell\u2019s influence.\n\nFail: \u201cRotten Apples That Come From Hell\u201d\n\nLast week, Redskins cornerback Josh Norman was asked about Prescott\u2019s dazzling performance in the Cowboys\u2019 season opener against the Giants. \u201cYou stand back there in the pocket all day and go through your first, second and third reads and come back to your first one, okay, cool,\u201d Norman said. \u201cAnybody can do that. At the end of the day, he\u2019s been playing well. As you can see, he\u2019s evolved. He\u2019s growing in the system. He\u2019s just taking his keys and picking his targets and throwing the ball on time.\u201d\n\nSeveral media outlets latched onto Norman\u2019s \u201canybody can do that\u201d quote, leading to disingenuous headlines such as \u201cNorman Calls Out Cowboys QB Dak Prescott.\u201d Cowboys executive vice president Stephen Jones was even asked about the perceived slight. After the game, Norman, who was burned by Devin Smith for a 51-yard touchdown in the loss, said he had nothing but respect for Prescott and expressed frustration with some unidentified media members for misconstruing his words.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the reason athletes, entertainers, don\u2019t even want to f--- with you guys to be 100 with you,\u201d Norman said. \u201cIt\u2019s no need. ... You really gotta watch the [reporters] that are doing great jobs. You gotta suffer with me because of the spoiled, rotten apples that come from hell. It\u2019s unbearable. There are good reporters that actually come in here and do the job that they\u2019re supposed to do and hold their head high and you respect them. But it\u2019s those sour apples, man, that make y\u2019alls job [stink]. It\u2019s sad, it really is sad, because you pin us against each other. You pin my brother against my other brother. You don\u2019t have to do that.\u201d\n\nPrescott said he was aware of Norman\u2019s comments, but didn\u2019t use them as motivation on Sunday.\n\nHail: Adrian Peterson\n\nHis final line \u2014 10 carries for 25 yards \u2014 wasn\u2019t worth celebrating, but Peterson moved into sole possession of fifth-place on the career rushing touchdown list with his 107th in the second quarter. Peterson now sets his sights on Walter Payton, who had 110. \u201cIt\u2019s a blessing,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cThis one means a lot more than the other ones will when I pass them, because Jim Brown\u2019s a guy that I looked up to. I\u2019ve had the opportunity to talk to him on several occasions. Just the look in his eyes when I\u2019m talking to him, that alone is just motivating to me. It feels good to have passed him today, but it\u2019s bittersweet because we didn\u2019t get this divisional win.\u201d\n\nThere we go!! 5th all time \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udd25. @AdrianPeterson \u2014 2\ufe0f\u20e39\ufe0f\u20e3 (@DhaSickest) September 15, 2019\n\nFail: The Pro-Cowboys Crowd\n\nThe announced attendance of 57,013 for Washington\u2019s Week 2 game against the Colts last season was the Redskins\u2019 smallest for a home opener since FedEx Field opened in 1997. There were 75,128 people in Landover for Sunday\u2019s game, but at least half of the crowd was cheering for the Cowboys, according to most estimates. Those in the stands wearing silver and blue were loud and had plenty to cheer about, even if some of them were a little iffy when it came to knowledge about their favorite team.\n\nTwo games in, the Cowboys look every bit like a top NFC contender\n\nSo... these Cowboys \"fans\" may need to get to know their \"team\" a little better pic.twitter.com/3omOZUfFj6 \u2014 Pete Hailey (@PeteHaileyNBCS) September 15, 2019\n\nHail: Scary Terry McLaurin\n\nMcLaurin tied for the team lead with five catches for 62 yards and a touchdown. After demonstrating his speed in Week 1, the rookie showed his ability to be physical at the line of scrimmage by shaking off a defender and making a catch on a short comeback route on Sunday. His one-yard touchdown catch with the game already decided late in the fourth quarter made him the first Redskins rookie wide receiver with at least two touchdown receptions in his first two games since Charlie Brown had three in 1982. Brown finished the season with eight.\n\nFail: Lead Changes\n\nLast season, the Redskins became the first team not to experience a lead change in their first nine game since 1954 and started the year 6-0 in games in which they scored first. Washington has scored first in both games this season, only to watch the Eagles and Cowboys erase the early deficits and cruise to relatively comfortable wins.\n\nRead more on the Redskins:\n\nToo many near-misses doom the Redskins in frustrating loss to Cowboys\n\nThree takeaways from Redskins\u2019 31-21 loss to Dallas in home opener\n\nThink the Redskins\u2019 start to the season has been bad? It may be about to get worse.\n\nThe Redskins\u2019 defense was supposed to be the strength of the team.
