In a Friday interview with Sky News, McKinnon said that attempts to level the playing field for women\u2019s sports by discriminating against transgender athletes was the equivalent of \u201cdenying their human rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll my medical records say female,\u201d McKinnon said. \u201cMy doctor treats me as a female person, my racing license says female, but people who oppose my existence still want to think of me as male . . . So, if we want to say, that I believe you\u2019re a woman for all of society, except for this massive central part that is sport, then that\u2019s not fair.\u201d\n\nVictoria Hood, a former cycling champion and manager of a British all-female cycling team, challenged McKinnon, telling Sky that \u201cit is not complicated, the science is there and it says that it is unfair. The male body, which has been through male puberty, still retains its advantage, that doesn\u2019t go away. I have sympathy with them. They have a right to do sport but not a right to go into any category they want.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, McKinnon issued a press release denouncing Hood for having \u201can irrational fear of trans women.\u201d\n\nAfter the victory, McKinnon took to Twitter to challenge critics.\n\nMany people claim to support trans women But often they only support us until our lives impact them in any meaningful way In my case, people literally say they support trans women\u2026but not in sport There can be no 'but' We are either full and equal women, or not We are. \u2014 Dr. Rachel McKinnon (@rachelvmckinnon) October 20, 2019\n\nOn Sunday, McKinnon tweeted \u201cI have yet to meet a real champion who has a problem with trans women. Real champions want stronger competition. If you win because bigotry got your competition banned\u2026 you\u2019re a loser.\u201d\u2019", "description": "Biological-male cyclist Rachel McKinnon won the women\u2019s world championship on Saturday, and set a women\u2019s world record in the qualifying event.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Jim Geraghty", "William Z.
