The pending announcement comes as McAleenan told lawmakers he would not testify this week before leaving the agency.\n\nInterested in Impeachment Inquiry?

Add Interest\n\n\u201cWhile I had planned to exhaustively prepare for this very important hearing, I am instead focused on winding down my tenure and facilitating an orderly and expeditious transfer of responsibilities to my successor,\u201d McAleenan wrote in a letter to House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson.\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images, FILE\n\nThompson issued a subpoena for McAleenan\u2019s appearance last week after the committee said Homeland Security refused to cooperate. McAleenan instead offered another top DHS official in his place.\n\n\u201cIt is inexcusable that the people charged with keeping the country safe from terrorism are refusing to show up to testify before Congress and speak to the American people about what they are doing to secure the homeland,\u201d Thompson said in a statement last Thursday.\n\nTrump promised to name McAleenan\u2019s replacement in the days following his Oct. 11 resignation. But more than two weeks later, the president still has not named McAleenan's successor.\n\nMark Morgan and Ken Cuccinelli, two top acting officials known for their hawkish views, have previously been floated as possible contenders for the job.\n\nThe Washington Post via Getty Images, FILE\n\nTrump has told reporters he likes the \u201cflexibility\u201d of agency leaders serving in acting roles, but the Federal Vacancies Act puts limits on how long interim department leadership can serve without a formal nominee. The White House personnel office has reportedly told Trump that both Cuccinelli and Morgan would be ineligible to serve as acting DHS Secretary under federal law.\n\nSome of the most avid supporters behind Trump\u2019s immigration restrictions favor Cuccinelli, who, as the acting head of Citizenship and Immigration Services, is responsible for creating stricter standards on legal immigration.\n\nRJ Hauman is the head of government relations at the Federation for American Immigration Reform -- a group that supports hard limits on immigration. He called Cuccinelli a \u201cskilled lawyer with good political sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cDHS is desperate for an outsider who is committed to President Trump\u2019s entire immigration agenda,\u201d Hauman said. \u201cPicking a career official or close associate of a former secretary who was forced out won\u2019t change a thing.\u201d\n\nCuccinelli and Morgan have taken on vocal roles in advocating for the administration\u2019s immigration agenda.\n\nMorgan, the acting head of Customs and Border Protection, told Fox News host Tucker Carlson earlier this year that he could tell if an immigrant child was a gang member after having \u201clooked in their eyes\u201d at immigrant detention facilities.\n\nAnother major hurdle for both agency leaders is surviving Senate confirmation where they could face opposition from Democrats and even moderate Republicans.\n\nBefore taking over at USCIS, Cuccinelli ran the Senate Conservatives Fund \u2013 a group that supported far-right challenges to incumbent Republicans.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you have to wait for the midterms for Mitch McConnell to worry about his job,\u201d Cuccinelli told ABC\u2019s Powerhouse Politics podcast prior to last year\u2019s election.\n\nChad Wolf, acting under secretary of strategy and policy at DHS, is another potential option to replace McAleenan, according to current and former administration officials.\n\nWolf helped establish the Transportation Security Agency after 9/11 and worked in the private sector as a lobbyist and consultant on security issues. With his tenure as a seasoned security executive and his focus on planning and operations at Homeland Security, Wolf has built internal support at DHS.\n\n\u201cHe knows the ins and outs of how the department operates,\u201d said one senior DHS official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \u201cIf [Trump] selects him as acting, he would be able to pick up the ball on day one and carry on with the president\u2019s agenda.\u201d\n\nWolf also served as chief of staff to former Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen during Trump\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy that led to the expedited separation of children from their parents at the border. As a result, his confirmation as under secretary was held up by Senate Democrats.\n\nBut votes in the Senate wouldn\u2019t be necessary if Wolf is tapped to lead as acting secretary before Trump decides on a formal nominee.", "description": "As the current chief refuses to testify, President Donald Trump looks to appoint a new Homeland Secretary.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/trump-wall-gty-aa-191025_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
