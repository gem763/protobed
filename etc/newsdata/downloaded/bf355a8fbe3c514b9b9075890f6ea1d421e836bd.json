(Deb Lindsey/For The Washington Post)\n\n2. Rooster & Owl\n\n(Excellent)\n\nFew chefs cook outside the box like Yuan Tang. When\u2019s the last time you had meatless larb or pig ear seasoned as if it were a Buffalo chicken wing? Do you care? You should, because as strange as some combinations sound, they make wonderful sense in your mouth. That larb, a riff on a Laotian salad, features shiitakes jazzed up with lime leaves and Thai chiles and slicked with a dressing of tamarind, hazelnut oil and lime \u2014 divine. Braised in pho broth and fried to a crackle, that zesty pig ear gets mixed with kohlrabi and peanuts and striped with ranch dressing \u2014 fun!\n\nRavioli stuffed with roasted carrots seasoned with miso and draped with walnut pesto would taste at home in an Italian standard-bearer, save perhaps for the pickled blueberries on the plate. And instead of a cheese course, Rooster & Owl offers brie custard with shortbread that\u2019s a ringer for a Ritz cracker. (Birthdays are acknowledged with cake pops in owl jars.)\n\nFour courses for $65 is fair admission for fabulous food and smart service. The dining room is by comparison subdued, but the leather chairs are comfy, and a recently designated private space for 10 is sure to call to gastronauts. Were you expecting mints with the check? Tiny robot-shaped gummies flavored with raspberry and prosecco are more this animal\u2019s style.\n\n3 stars (Excellent)\n\nRooster & Owl: 2436 14th St. NW. 202-813-3976. roosterowl.com\n\nOpen: Dinner Tuesday through Saturday.\n\nPrices: Dinner $65 per person, bar a la carte: $12-$26.\n\nSound check: 74 decibels / Must speak with raised voice.\n\nThe Top 10 restaurants of 2019:\n\n10.

(Deb Lindsey/For The Washington Post)\n\nRooster & Owl makes magic\n\n(Excellent)\n\nChef Yuan Tang works nights, and his wife and business partner, Carey, keeps day hours. Throw in the couple\u2019s passion for animals, and Rooster & Owl makes perfect sense as a name for their debut restaurant on 14th Street NW. The space isn\u2019t much to look at, but the lack of scenery hardly matters when the food starts showing up. Baby carrots take on the flavor of good barbecue, aided and abetted by a scoop of velvety cornbread ice cream, a combination you might question until it hits your tongue. Meat takes a back seat here, deployed more as a garnish than a featured player, an exception being fried baby quail glazed with miso, honey and yuzu juice and splayed on creamy grits fired up with red pepper relish. Tuesday nights give diners a chance to decide what stays and what goes on the four-course script. That\u2019s when Tang introduces four new dishes for $35, giving diners the option of eating works in progress for less than the usual price of admission. Crowd favorites from a recent audition included cucumbers accessorized with yuzu gel, feta cheese and ginger-garlic crumble, and salmon sporting a crisp coat of falafel. Think of them as public votes of confidence to the benefit of future diners. One thing is for certain: Rooster & Owl has animal magnetism.\n\nThe Top 10 new restaurants of 2019:\n\n10. Gravitas\n\n9.

(Deb Lindsey/For The Washington Post)\n\nRooster & Owl is D.C.\u2019s most exciting restaurant debut this year\n\n(Excellent)\n\nWashington has a new restaurant with a little problem that\u2019s going to make it hard for you to try it, despite the considerable talent of its chef, Yuan Tang.\n\nSuffice it to say, 50 seats is too few for the crowds I predict at Rooster & Owl on 14th Street NW once word gets out about his handiwork. Carrots cooked to taste like you\u2019re at a barbecue, noodles pulled from kohlrabi and celery root, and oxtails reimagined as pot roast are sure to generate the kind of enthusiasm that has made reservations at, say, Fancy Radish, Himitsu or Three Blacksmiths as challenging as the union of Kellyanne and George Conway.\n\n[Tom Sietsema\u2019s 9 favorite places to eat in D.C. right now]\n\nGoing into Rooster & Owl, I had never heard of Tang, who owns the restaurant with his wife, Carey. Leaving their debut venture, I felt extraordinarily well fed by the Falls Church native, who until recently had been earning his living as an Uber driver.\n\nThe dining room (formerly Cr\u00e8me) doesn\u2019t prepare you for what\u2019s to come. The leather chairs are comfortable, but also tightly spaced, and random overhead branches and leaves suggest the remains of a Halloween party. Shelves of plastic food containers keep some space between the visible kitchen and Tang\u2019s audience. From a design stance, Rooster & Owl looks unremarkable. It doesn\u2019t much matter, though, because as soon as the food starts showing up, your eyes will be riveted to the plates.\n\n\n\nFrom left: Yuan and Carey Tang, chef and co-owner of the new Rooster & Owl. (Deb Lindsey/For The Washington Post)\n\nThe menu is four courses for $65, with four choices in as many categories. Like a lot of his brethren, Tang wants you to share your food with your tablemates. Easier said than done. The portions are restrained, the compositions frequently luscious. Once you try his lobster etouffee \u2014 pulsing with tropical heat, finished with fish sauce and lightened with an herb salad \u2014 you\u2019re inclined to keep it close at hand (or mouth). As with most of his ideas, the bread service tells a little story. Guests are greeted with subtly sweet pineapple buns, named for their crackly diamond-stamped tops and introduced as the chef\u2019s childhood snack when he lived in Hong Kong. The butter on their plate, piped to look like a flower, is made on the premises.\n\nWithout an ounce of sermonizing, Rooster & Owl encourages customers to eat their vegetables, which play a leading role on the menu. The heavy cloak of winter was lifted with every bite of a salad of raw julienne kohlrabi and celery root, invigorated with a lemon vinaigrette and fresh mint. What could have passed for linguine, with the exception of its faint crunch, was made more compelling with a scattering of cotija \u2014 the Parmesan of Mexico \u2014 and crushed sesame seed brittle. A number of restaurants are pushing carrots as center-of-the-plate attractions, but no kitchen has made them taste heartier and sassier; Tang applies a dry rub to the baby vegetables before roasting them to softness and applying barbecue sauce thereafter. The tang is the ideal foil to their cool and silken accompaniment. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know you were missing cornbread ice cream in your life, did you?\u201d asked a server as we explored the scoop.\n\nShe didn\u2019t inquire about the impact of Tang\u2019s oven-roasted Napa cabbage on my existence, but I\u2019m here to say, a wedge whose leaves are stuffed with shallots, pear and thyme, and presented on a little pool of green peppercorn sauce, is quietly life-affirming.\n\n\n\nRooster & Owl on 14th Street, NW. (Deb Lindsey/For The Washington Post)\n\nDiners at Rooster & Owl. (Deb Lindsey/For The Washington Post)\n\nNot to say meat fanciers can\u2019t eat here, or will feel deprived. Tang seems driven to consider all points of view with his cooking. Look, then, for the aforementioned \u201cpot roast,\u201d whose quote marks hint that the recipe is unlike anything any mother is likely to have served. For one thing, it\u2019s just a cup or so of comfort (the way most of us should be eating, but I digress). For another, braised oxtail acts as mere garnish for a bed of buttery whipped potatoes and diced rutabagas sweetened with a bit of maple syrup. Contrast, thy name is crispy shallots, the crowning touch on the small plate.\n\nCrackling fried baby quail, glazed with miso, honey and yuzu juice, lounges on grits fired up with Thai chile in a red pepper relish: fusion at its finest.\n\nDespite the Uber gig, Tang, 36, is no Johnny-come-lately. His New York credits include line cook positions at the esteemed Jean-Georges and the Modern. Most recently in Washington, the college accounting major served as a sous-chef at the late Rogue 24. I can taste those and other stops at Rooster & Owl, an effort Tang preceded by three years of catering gigs, pop-ups and driving strangers around town in his own car.\n\n\u201cLOVE Rooster & Owl,\u201d a friend with great taste texted me after she tried the restaurant in its first week. \u201cCome with 4 pple so you can have everything. 4 stars out of the gate. Seriously.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve never given any area restaurant my highest rating out of the gate, preferring to see how they settle in over time, but I can understand my friend\u2019s animal enthusiasm. Tang sets a high bar for himself. Familiar as some of the combinations read on paper, none of them dip below very good. There\u2019s an ocean of crudo out there, but the kanpachi lapped with coconut milk and dappled with lime leaves and grapefruit at Rooster & Owl tastes wholly fresh. Gnocchi staged with shiitakes and preserved lemon is so ethereal, I glance up from my plate to see if Fabio Trabocchi or Amy Brandwein has momentarily slipped into Tang\u2019s Batman Crocs.\n\n\n\nEclair with hazelnut, brown butter and dark chocolate. (Deb Lindsey/For The Washington Post)\n\nRooster & Owl? The name acknowledges that Carey has a day job, at Children\u2019s National Hospital, and Yuan works nights. The couple has a thing for animal art, too, pieces of which they display at home and used as inspiration before christening their restaurant. Good thing they drilled down; Giraffe & Elephant just doesn\u2019t have the same ring to it.\n\nDinners are inspiring to the last crumb. Pastry chef Olivia Green comes to the project from the much-admired M\u00e9tier and Kinship. Here, she seduces diners with a downy goat cheese bavarois tarted up with cranberries, slender eclairs piped with praline mousseline and graced with brown butter ice cream, not to forget bite-size, robot-shaped milk chocolates with the bill.\n\n\u201cWe want to put a smile on people\u2019s faces when they get the check,\u201d says Tang.\n\nNice gesture, but honestly, Rooster & Owl pretty much has diners grinning from the first bite.", "description": "Yuan Tang packs flavor and fun into every one of his dishes.", "authors": ["Tom Sietsema", "Food Critic", "Tom Sietsema Has Been The Washington Post'S Food Critic Since He Previously Worked For The Microsoft Corp.", "Where He Launched Sidewalk.Com", "The Seattle Post-Intelligencer", "The San Francisco Chronicle", "The Milwaukee Journal.
