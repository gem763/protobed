An additional 14.8 percent plan to loosen those requirements, while another 17.2 percent are considering it.\n\nThat\u2019s good news for jobseekers: About 62 percent of employers said they lowered the required years of experience they asked for job applicants, and another 49.7 percent said they reduced the education requirements. About 21 percent of respondents don\u2019t plan to drug test candidates anymore, and 16 percent have halted background checks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe takeaway is clear: U.S. companies realize they must adapt in order to source temporary talent in such a candidate-driven market,\u201d the study found.\n\nAlthough the concern is that lowering application standards could result in a decrease in the quality and potential of candidates, or potentially result in the hiring of someone who could pose a safety threat in the office, the study found the rewards often outweigh the risks.\n\nStill, there are other means for employers to attract new talent, too \u2014 like increasing paychecks. August data revealed that over the past year, however, average hourly earnings have risen a modest 3.2 percent to $28.11.
