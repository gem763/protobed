However, according to McCarthy, the testimony did not stand up to Ratcliffe\u2019s questioning.\n\n\u201cIn 90 seconds, we had John Ratcliffe destroy Taylor\u2019s whole argument,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cWe can\u2019t really talk about it, but what we\u2019re finding is just his questioning in 90 seconds refuted everything of what Adam Schiff leaves out there. There\u2019s no quid pro quo, and what you find out in this process is all this information is just like that whistleblower. Remember, we haven\u2019t seen that whistleblower.
