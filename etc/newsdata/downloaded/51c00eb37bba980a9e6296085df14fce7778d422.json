But she\u2019s a beautiful girl and all of the staff here love her.\n\n(Image: rspca)\n\n(Image: rspca)\n\n\u201cShe makes friends quickly and loves to snooze on your lap and play with toys. She really enjoys training and is very bright.\n\n\"When she first arrived she didn\u2019t know any commands or skills but she\u2019s picked up lots of tricks and is a very well-behaved girl.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a real favourite among staff and volunteers who\u2019ve become extremely attached to her over the years.\n\n\"But we\u2019re all so desperate for her to go off to a loving forever home and we simply can\u2019t understand why no one wants to give her a chance.\u201d\n\nFaith is a big fan of tail wagging and loves to be walked, although needs a muzzle as she struggles around other dogs.\n\n(Image: rspca)\n\n(Image: rspca)\n\nShe loves to run around, so a big garden would be perfect for her to play in.\n\nAnd Faith needs a quiet and calm home with plenty of routine, although she is fine around older children.\n\nShecan even be left alone for short periods of time and one of her favourite hobbies is sitting quietly with her favourite chew toy.\n\nRachel said: \"Faith will make a loving companion and a fun play friend and we really hope someone will give her a second chance this Adoptober.\"\n\nFaith will need a little time to settle in her new home but makes friends easily.\n\nFor more information about Faith visit her online profile or contact Bath Cats and Dogs Home on rehoming@bcdh.org.uk or 01225 787321.\n\nIf you\u2019re not in a position to give a pet a home this October, you can still help thousands of animals in our care by donating at www.rspca.org.uk/donateadoptober , sponsoring a dog kennel or cat pod for just \u00a31.50 a week, or showing your support for rescue pets with one of our RSPCA T-shirts.\n\nFind out how to support the work of your local RSPCA here.", "description": "Faith was found trying to dodge traffic when she was still a puppy by Buffy the Vampire and Merlin star, Anthony Head", "authors": ["Jane Lavender", "Image", "Rspca"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20535353.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Faith-Bath-1jpeg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
