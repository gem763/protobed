The auditor is still owed \u00a3900,000(S$1.58 million) from Thomas Cook for work completed.\n\nAfter the Carillion and BHS collapse, two government-backed reviews have proposed setting up a new regulator, forcing companies to hire two auditors, and requiring the Big Four to run their audit and advisory services separately to avoid treading softly on audit to win lucrative advisory business.\n\nBut Britain's business minister Andrea Leadsom said last week the government would wait until early 2020 to propose legislation after a third review into the role of audit reports back before the end of 2019.\n\nPwC and EY officials said reform should be implemented as a package drawing on all three reviews. If legislation is proposed in early 2020, change may still take a year or two, with even the regulator sceptical of planned reforms like joint audits.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [LONDON] Accounting firms have not shown a \"learning curve\" from the collapse of travel company Thomas Cook and builder Carillion, with urgent reform the only way to improve audit quality, a senior British lawmaker said on Tuesday. .
