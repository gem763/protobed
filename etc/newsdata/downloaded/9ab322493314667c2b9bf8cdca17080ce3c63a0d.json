Bernie Sanders has a friendship with Utah Sen. Mike Lee.\n\nIf that surprises anyone, it shouldn\u2019t. The duo was instrumental in passing a Senate resolution earlier this year that directed the removal of U.S. troops from Yemen who were sent there without approval from Congress.\n\nLee has built relationships with a handful of other \u201csurprising\u201d colleagues, including Democratic Sens. Cory Booker, Dick Durbin and Dianne Feinstein.\n\nAnd if viewers made it to the end of Tuesday\u2019s three-hour Democratic debate, they would have stumbled on this final question: \u201cWhat friendship have you had that would surprise us, and what impact has that had on you and your beliefs?\u201d\n\nRep. Tulsi Gabbard pointed to Trey Gowdy. Sen. Amy Klobuchar and former Vice President Joe Biden both mentioned John McCain. Sen. Elizabeth Warren said she befriended Republican solicitor general Charles Freed. Sen. Cory Booker has Bible study with Sen. Jim Inhofe and takes his Republican colleagues out to lunch. Sen. Kamala Harris noted the work she did with Sen. Rand Paul. Sanders referenced Lee.\n\nPresumably at the risk of offending the left-leaning audience, each candidate felt compelled to clarify their relationships: \u201cWe don\u2019t agree on anything, however \u2026\u201d (fill in the blank). \u201cHe\u2019s a deeply principled Republican, but we still \u2026\u201d (insert bipartisan achievement here).\n\nMaybe it\u2019s time for America to live more within those exceptions than to settle for the falsehood, \u201cwe have nothing in common.\u201d And maybe it\u2019s time the country stops labeling these partnerships as \u201csurprising.\u201d\n\nNot everyone in Congress agrees on everything, nor should they. But bipartisanship isn\u2019t \u2014 at least it shouldn\u2019t be \u2014 a myth. It\u2019s how things get done.\n\nBipartisanship isn\u2019t \u2014 at least it shouldn\u2019t be \u2014 a myth. It\u2019s how things get done.\n\nLiving within those exceptions \u2014 the spaces where common ground pokes through a tangle of thorny divisions \u2014 is the hallmark of a good legislator. And it should be the aim of everyone as they sit down to dinner, chat with neighbors or engage friends online.\n\nBut data released by the Pew Research Center last week shows most people aren\u2019t doing so well. Almost three-quarters of Americans now say they not only can\u2019t agree on policy plans but that they also can\u2019t agree on basic facts.\n\nThat means it\u2019s up to the remaining 26% who at least have their facts straight to bridge the divide and search for agreement. Debating opposing views is helpful, and sometimes entertaining, but when progress is needed it\u2019s the common ground that always gets the votes.\n\nThese \u201csurprising\u201d friendships are what will ultimately move the needle on immigration reform, public safety, health care and federal spending. No position among members of Congress is so extreme it doesn\u2019t allow for a spot of common ground. That\u2019s where legislation needs to live, especially heading into an election year that threatens to consume any semblance of bipartisan lawmaking.\n\nAnd no individual opinion should be so extreme it precludes even talking to someone who thinks differently.\n\nSen. Klobuchar closed her final minutes with this statement: \u201cWhat unites us is so much bigger than what divides us. ... Our job ... is to change the tone in our politics.\u201d It\u2019s more than a squishy sentiment; it\u2019s a way of life that\u2019s slipping away. Living in the exceptions will keep America running strong.", "description": "Not everyone in Congress agrees on everything, nor should they.
