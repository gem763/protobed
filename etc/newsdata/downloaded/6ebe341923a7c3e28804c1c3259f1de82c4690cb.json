Her access to power is righteously over,\u201d the 38-year-old \u201cThe Joke\u201d singer said in a tweeted statement. \u201cI forgive her. I mean no disrespect. I wish her well and hope that she comes to understand the error in her part of this shameful policy.\u201d\n\nMs. Carlile was supposed to perform at Fortune\u2019s Most Powerful Women Summit in Washington, where Ms. Nielsen is slated to speak Tuesday. Hillary Clinton also pulled out of the three-day event due to scheduling issues, but one source told Slate that it was also because of Ms. Nielsen, who oversaw the Trump administration\u2019s family separation policy at the border.\n\n\u201cSurviving R. Kelly\u201d filmmaker Dream Hampton dropped out of the event Friday because of Ms. Nielsen\u2019s involvement, saying the former Trump official\u2019s presence at the summit would amount to \u201creputation rinsing.\u201d\n\n\u201cSharing a stage with Nielsen, who separated immigrant families and put babies in cages, would have put a stamp of approval on her immoral and reprehensible actions and help legitimize the terror that Trump is inflicting on immigrants and communities of color,\u201d Ms. Hampton said in a statement. \u201cSo I\u2019m cancelling my attendance and encourage other speakers to do the same.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to BuzzFeed News on Monday afternoon, a spokesperson for Fortune defended Ms. Nielsen\u2019s participation and said the former DHS secretary would be asked the necessary questions.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the most powerful women in business, who also happen to be some of the most powerful women in the world, have strong views about how the U.S. Administration has handled its immigration policy,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWe sought out an opportunity to bring the woman who was effectively responsible for that policy to ask her tough questions publicly and on stage about that policy. We brought in Amna Nawaz from PBS NewsHour to do the interview with the clear understanding that this would be a no-holds-barred interview, and that there would be an opportunity for our MPW members to ask questions, as well. That\u2019s how we practice live journalism.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
