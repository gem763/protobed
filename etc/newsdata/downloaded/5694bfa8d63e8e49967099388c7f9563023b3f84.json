From 1968 to 1988, Republicans won the popular vote five out of six times. In the seven elections since, Republicans have won the popular vote once. Democrats have become risk takers because they feel pressure from a revitalized left. By some estimates, the percentage of Americans who have taken to the streets since Trump\u2019s election exceeds the share that did so at the height of protests against the Vietnam War. And this activist surge has given the left power in Congress. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has almost twice as many followers on Twitter, and almost six times as many on Instagram, as Pelosi does.\n\nFinally, Democrats have become risk takers because Trump has shattered the norms that once constrained political action. He\u2019s shown that brazenness works. In so doing, he\u2019s encouraged Democrats to be as brazen in expanding democracy\u2014by eliminating the electoral college and letting prisoners vote\u2014as Trump and his allies have been in restricting and undermining it. He\u2019s encouraged Democrats to be as brazen in defending the rule of law as he has been in defying it.\n\nIt is telling that Pelosi has embraced impeachment at the very moment that Warren\u2014who tells her audiences, \u201cYou can\u2019t be afraid\u201d\u2014surges in front of Joe Biden in early-state polls. Democrats have become, for the first time in a generation, a daring party. This is more than the audacity of hope. It\u2019s the audacity of desperation, too.", "description": "", "authors": ["Peter Beinart", "Theatlantic.Com Ideas Archive The-Democrats-Era-Of-Caution-Is-Over"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
