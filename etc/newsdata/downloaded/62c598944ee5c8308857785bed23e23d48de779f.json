The politician, Eva Glawischnig-Piesczek, a former leader of Austria\u2019s Green Party, argued that Facebook needed to delete the material in the country and limit worldwide access.\n\nThe decision is a blow to big internet platforms like Facebook, placing more responsibility on them to patrol their sites for content ruled illegal.\n\nThe case has been closely watched because of its potential ripple effects for regulating internet content. The enforcement of defamation, libel and privacy laws varies from country to country, with language and behavior that is allowed in one nation prohibited in another. The court\u2019s decision highlights the difficulty of creating uniform standards to govern an inherently borderless web and then enforcing them.", "description": "Comments posted on the social network about an Austrian politician became a battle over the reach of European defamation laws on the internet.", "authors": ["Adam Satariano"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/02/business/3eufacebook/3eufacebook-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
