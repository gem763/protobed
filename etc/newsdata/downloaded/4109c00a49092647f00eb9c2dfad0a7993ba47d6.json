He told the Des Moines Register that he hasn't been able to clean it up because it's still seeping in.\n\nThe waste is coming from a neighboring meat locker, where blood and tissue from slaughtered animals was washed down a drain. Officials say a clog or break in the pipe sent the waste into Lestina's basement through a floor drain.\n\nA state environmental specialist traced the waste to Dahl's Custom Meat Locker and says the company is now pumping its into a large tank.\n\nThe Lestina family has temporarily moved in with a relative.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Des Moines Register, http://www.desmoinesregister.com", "description": "Blood may be thicker than water, but it'll still flood your basement.
