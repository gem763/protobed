I don't know. If I stay it will be good for MLS because the whole world will watch it. If I don't stay, nobody will remember what MLS is.'\n\nA member of the LA Galaxy coaching staff tries to get between Ibrahimovic and the fan\n\nThe legendary striker smiles as he walks away, while another member of staff is stopped (left)\n\nHe was then questioned about the gesture he made to an LAFC fan as he walked from the field, responding: 'They said something.\n\n'Not being disrespectful but this is like training for me. The stadium is too small for me. I'm used to playing in front of 80,000. This is a walk in the park.'\n\nThere was also a controversial VAR call during the match, in which an apparent offside goal was given in favour of LAFC. In response, Ibrahimovic said: 'What was he [the VAR official] doing upstairs? Drinking coffee with Magic Johnson?'\n\nIbrahimovic has yet to confirm details of his future and whether he will be hanging up his boots at the end of the 2019 season, which for Galaxy came on Thursday night.\n\nThe ex-Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain, Juventus and Inter Milan striker has been linked with a move back to Europe, but nothing has yet been decided.\n\nIbrahimovic scored what could turn out to be his last ever goal as a professional footballer\n\nZlatan was likely holding back news of his future so as not to disrupt his team's attempts to win the MLS Cup this season.\n\nThey headed into Thursday's conference semi-final against LAFC with high hopes, but were eventually downed 5-3.\n\nIbrahimovic did get on the scoresheet to level things up at 2-2 in the second half, but Adama Diomande scored a brace - to add to Carlos Vela's in the first half - to take LAFC through to the Western Conference finals, where they will play Seattle Sounders.\n\nAtlanta United will face Toronto in the Eastern Conference final, before the winners meet in the MLS Cup final on November 10.", "description": "In a moment perhaps typical of his colourful career, Ibrahimovic - obviously disappointed at his team's 5-3 semi-final defeat in LA - took exception to one fan's gloating on his way off.", "authors": ["Ben Nagle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/07/20168578-0-image-a-6_1571986039159.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
