A Quinnipiac University poll published Thursday showed him with less than 1 percent support.\n\nRyan had last appeared alongside fellow candidates on the debate stage in July, and did not meet the necessary thresholds to take part in the September and October forums.\n\nIn an earlier post Friday morning, Trump also targeted former Democratic presidential contender Eric Swalwell, a California congressman who ended his campaign in July.\n\n\u201cAnother big dropout of the Presidential race was, along with 0% Tim Ryan, 0% @RepSwalwell. Such talk and bravado from both, and nothing to show,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cThey stood for nothing, and the voters couldn\u2019t stand by them. Obnoxious and greedy politicians never make it in the end!\u201d\n\nSwalwell has remained a vocal critic of the president in his capacity as a member of the House Intelligence Committee, one of the three congressional panels leading House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/97/2c/787a21ff4ed0a9638b63749d43bc/191025-donald-trump-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
