And right now, as Halloween approaches, is the perfect time to plan a visit.\n\nThe Lockwood-Mathews Mansion Museum in Norwalk, Conn., is open year-round, but has special events around Halloween.

(Photo: Full Moon/Edge of Hell)\n\nAccording to an article from the Smithsonian, haunted houses originated, in some format, in London in the early 19th century. At the time, the public was exposed to new forms of entertainment \u2013 exhibits of the creepier variety.\n\nIn 1802, the article said, Marie Tussaud put on a display of decapitated wax figures of French notables including Marie Antoinette, King Louis XVI, Robespierre and Marat.\n\nThey were eerily true figures, since Tussaud had created death masks for the real people after they faced the guillotine. The display was called \"Chamber of Horrors,\" a name that has stuck around, according to National Geographic.\n\nAs time progressed, the eerie attractions began to evolve around the world. At The Grand Guignol in France, performance art became gory under the leadership of Max Maurey in the early 20th century.\n\n\"He (Maurey) measured the success of a play by the number of people who fainted during its performance, and, to attract publicity, hired a house doctor to treat the more fainthearted spectators,\" the theater's website stated.\n\nAnd in the United States, during the Great Depression, parents began arranging haunted houses. It started as a way to keep their sons off the streets during the holiday that could become quite rowdy.\n\nOver time, it was integrated into the culture of Halloween and popularized by Disney, according to the Smithsonian.\n\nWinchester Mystery House in San Jose, Calif., has a history of reported paranormal activity. The property and mansion have been claimed by many to be haunted by the ghosts of those killed with Winchester rifles. (Photo: Winchester Mystery House)\n\nHaunted or manufactured horror?\n\nWhat you decide to endure as a visitor splits in a categorical sense. There are haunted houses specifically designed to scare visitors, and those in which something sinister lurks of its own accord.\n\nSome of the haunted houses open to visitors have been home to reported paranormal activity for decades.\n\nTake the Winchester Mystery House in San Jose, California, for example, which is open year-round.\n\nThe 160-room mansion built by Sarah Winchester, heiress to the Winchester Repeating Arms fortune, was built with odd features including doors that open into walls and staircases that lead to the ceiling. But the mystery doesn't stop there.\n\n\"Guests, employees and even paranormal investigators have experienced strange phenomena including hearing footsteps, voices, cold spots,\" Walter Magnuson, general manager of Winchester Mystery House, said.\n\nThere have even been reported sightings of the \"Wheelbarrow Ghost,\" whom they believe was a worker on the estate, Magnuson said.\n\nStatesville Haunted Prison in Lockport, Ill., is a special kind of gruesome thrill. (Photo: Statesville Haunted Prison)\n\nOn the other hand, attractions like Statesville Haunted Prison in Lockport, Illinois, have been specifically designed to horrify anyone who enters.\n\nThe (fictional) haunted prison, open through Nov. 2, is not intended for \"children or the weak,\" general manager Kaity Siegel-Grimmenga said.\n\n\"Statesville takes you through the twisted chambers of the darkest creatures ever imprisoned,\" she explained.\n\nThe tour, which lasts for about an hour, features more than 175 live \"prisoners\" in 40 rooms, \"attacking you at every step.\"\n\nHaunted houses carry varying characteristics, monsters and themes, and some rotate what theme the attraction carries, sometimes even yearly.\n\nAs for which kind is spookier, that's up to the visitor.\n\nFollow Morgan Hines on Twitter: @MorganEmHines.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/2019/10/18/haunted-houses-variations-how-they-came-and-some-recs/3912402002/", "description": "Pitch dark halls, creepy noises intermingling with shrieks of horror:\u00a0Characteristics of a time tested\u00a0Halloween tradition, the haunted house.", "authors": ["Morgan Hines", "Published A.M.
