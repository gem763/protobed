Expect a free-flowing game with plenty of chances for both teams.\n\nThe pressure will be on Frank Lampard despite the odds being against him \u2013 he will not want to begin the season without a home win in four games at Stamford Bridge. If N\u2019Golo Kante is fit, he will play, but that is a big \u2018if\u2019.\n\nIf Kante does not play, Roberto Firmino will have a big impact on the game with Chelsea playing without a natural bridge between their defence and midfield \u2013 exactly the space in which the Brazilian does his best work.\n\nChelsea 1-2 Liverpool\n\nOdds\n\nChelsea 27/10\n\nDraw 11/4\n\nLiverpool EVS\n\nWhen is it?\n\nKick off at Stamford Bridge is at 4.30pm on Sunday September 22.\n\nHow can I watch it?\n\nSky Sports will be showing the game on their Main Event and Premier League channels, with coverage starting at 4pm.\n\nThe match can also be live streamed by Sky customers using the Sky Go app on mobile devices or PC.\n\nLatest updates\n\nA once fierce and fiery rivalry, one that pitted Frank Lampard against Steven Gerrard, has lost it's spark.
