Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan vowed to \u201ccrush the heads of the terrorists\u201d if they didn\u2019t withdraw from an unspecified safe zone within the cease-fire period. Redur Khalil, a spokesman for the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, told the Associated Press that the SDF had agreed only to the American agreement, not the Turkish one.\n\nBesides, there was no geographic limit to the \u201csafe zone\u201d spelled out in the U.S.-Turkey deal; if the Kurds withdrew from the 75-mile strip between the towns of Ras al-Ayn and Tal Abyad, where the Turks had concentrated their assault in mid-October, Erdo\u011fan could still claim there were terrorists who needed crushing elsewhere on his border; he has previously said he wanted the Kurds out of a 260-mile stretch of that frontier, more than three times the length the Americans had in mind.\n\n\u201cWe never used a map,\u201d said James Jeffrey, the Trump administration\u2019s Syria and counter-ISIS envoy, in congressional testimony yesterday. \u201cThis sounds like a sloppy way to do things; it actually worked.\u201d The Turks hadn\u2019t launched a new offensive; the commander of the SDF wrote to Vice President Mike Pence to say that his forces had left \u201cthe relevant area of operations.\u201d\n\nRead: The forever war fought by America\u2019s allies\n\nMeanwhile, the Kurds and the Turks were also maneuvering for support from their international backers. Despite accusations that the United States had abandoned the Kurds, they seemed to have no intention of abandoning the United States. \u201cWe want peace \u2026 And we will stick to the United States forever,\u201d the Syrian Kurdish leader Ilham Ahmed, a co-president of the Syrian Democratic Council, told reporters through a translator on Capitol Hill this week. She had come on an emergency visit to push for support for the Syrian Kurds, as a bipartisan group of lawmakers readied sanctions against Turkey and Senator Lindsey Graham hinted that policy changes might be coming from the White House. Graham, who is close to Trump, had condemned his Syria pullout; Defense Secretary Mark Esper told reporters there was a chance some troops could stay in the country to protect oil fields.\n\nThe Turkish government, for its part, was courting Russia, having been roundly condemned by American and European officials whom Erdo\u011fan duly dismissed as backing terrorists. The end of the cease-fire coincided almost exactly with a planned meeting between Erdo\u011fan and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin, whose forces are already patrolling some areas in northern Syria that the Americans have left.
