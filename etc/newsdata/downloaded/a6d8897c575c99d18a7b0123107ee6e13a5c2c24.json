The lawyers also take issue with allegations that Bitfinex was stalling on its court-ordered document production requirements.\n\n\u201cOAG\u2019s [Office of Attorney General] allegations concerning delay are in all events misleading, and unfairly attack the motives of the Respondents and their counsel,\u201d the letter notes.\n\nThe cryptocurrency exchange has been battling legal action for the past six-months, after the NYAG\u2019s office said in April that Bitfinex lost access to $850 million held by third-party payment processor Crypto Capital, and covered up the losses by borrowing from Tether\u2018s reserves.\n\nIn response, Bitfinex raised $1 billion in 10 days by selling LEO tokens in an initial exchange offering (IEO) back in May. The exchange said it hoped the money would alleviate concerns of its financial stability and potentially cover the loss of assets frozen during investigations into Crypto Capital.\n\nJust this weekend, a new class action lawsuit alleged Bitfinex and Tether caused the cryptocurrency market trillions of dollars worth of damage as a result of using Tether\u2018s stablecoin to manipulate the Bitcoin market \u2014 but it\u2019s still unclear whether those claims hold any weight.\n\nH/T CoinDesk", "description": "Cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex is dead set on holding on to its documents despite objections from the office of the New York Attorney General (NYAG).", "authors": ["Yessi Bello Perez", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/hardfork?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FUntitled-design-93.jpg&signature=f0b84f6f8dacc5f976bfabc63884bca1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
