Sorry, too, that I never went out with them, because they\u2019re only just up the road from where I live.\n\nBritain is being ruined, bit by bit, and at an accelerating rate by politically correct ideologues and SJW boot boys while a complacent mainstream media looks on nervously, afraid to take a stand in case the snowflakes among its readership disapprove.", "description": "James Delingpole writes: Chris Packham, the joyless, dead-eyed, animal rights campaigner is happy because a \u00a0200-year old hunt has been bullied into extinction.", "authors": ["James Delingpole"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-465271538-e1570725408591-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
