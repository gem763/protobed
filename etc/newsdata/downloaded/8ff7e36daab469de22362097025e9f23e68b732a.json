Kraft is accused of doing so twice on consecutive days in January.\n\nThe spa crackdown began being disclosed Feb. 19 at a media briefing at the Martin County Sheriff's Office where Sheriff William Snyder said his agency targeted four spas in Martin County.\n\nNFL POWER RANKINGS: New teams enter top 10 following losses by Cowboys, Chargers\n\n49ERS SEND STATEMENT: 'You want idiots to sound like idiots'\n\nInvestigators were led to Orchids of Asia Day Spa in neighboring Palm Beach County, where covert surveillance cameras were installed after investigators got a \"sneak-and-peek\" warrant.\n\nA judge in May ruled video evidence in Kraft\u2019s case should be excluded, but prosecutors appealed that ruling.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit filed Oct. 1, Kraft\u2019s attorneys sent a records request later in May to the State Attorney\u2019s Office for 29 \u201ccategories of documents and communications relating to the Jupiter Police Department\u2019s investigation of the Spa and resulting criminal charges.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit alleges prosecutors in September stated they already handed over \u201cresponsive, non-exempt public records\u201d during the discovery process. Additional \u201cresponsive documents and communications are exempt.\u201d\n\nThe suit alleges public records given to Kraft by prosecutors don\u2019t include some email correspondence, but Jupiter police already provided some of that when responding to another records request.\n\n\u201cThis glaring omission in the public records provided by the State Attorney\u2019s Office suggests that it has improperly excluded countless other responsive, non-exempt documents and communications in an effort to hide evidence from Mr. Kraft,\u201d the lawsuit states.\n\nThe lawsuit states the records are non-exempt public records that should have been provided.\n\nKraft wants a hearing on the matter.", "description": "Attorneys for New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft filed a lawsuit, alleging prosecutors haven\u2019t turned over some records in Jupiter sex spa case.", "authors": ["Will Greenlee", "Published A.M.
