Revenue for the first nine months of the year in Hong Kong, however, rose 7%.\n\n\"Obviously the economy is getting impacted by two things - the U.S.-China trade dispute and the protests,\" said Chief Financial Officer Ewen Stevenson.\n\nThe bank is particularly monitoring its portfolio of small business customers who may be feeling the strain, he added.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Sumeet Chatterjee in Hong Kong and Lawrence White in London; Additional reporting by Alun John; Editing by Christopher Cushing and Clarence Fernandez)", "description": "HONG KONG/LONDON (Reuters) - HSBC Holdings Plc dropped its 2020 profit target, reported a sharp fall in earnings and warned of a costly restructuring, as interim Chief Executive Noel Quinn seeks to tackle its problems head-on in his bid for the full-time role.
