A PCA statement did not specify an amount.\n\nMason argued in the South Korean case that its investors suffered damages as a result of government influence over the decision of the country\u2019s largest pension fund, the National Pension Service (NPS), which approved the $8 billion merger of Samsung affiliates Samsung C&T (028260.KS) and Cheil Industries in 2015.\n\nThe merger was at the center of a corruption scandal involving South Korean politicians and business leaders, leading to the impeachment of former President Park Geun-hye and arrest of Samsung Group heir Jay Y.
