A typical full time UAW worker has already lost roughly $7,000 in wages, according to the Anderson Economic Group.\n\nRead More", "description": "The United Auto Workers' national council voted Thursday to recommend its rank and file members ratify a tentative agreement with General Motors.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore", "Vanessa Yurkevich", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191017134845-uaw-picket-signs-1016-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
