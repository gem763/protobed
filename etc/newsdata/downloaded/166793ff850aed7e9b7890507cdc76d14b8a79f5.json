Carelessness at both ends of the pitch, and from VAR, combined to inflict familiar pain.\n\nAndy Robertson was adjudged to have fouled Callej\u00f3n and Dries Mertens converted the resulting penalty through the despairing grasp of Adri\u00e1n. It certainly looked a foul to the naked eye \u2013 and to the two belonging to German referee Felix Brych \u2013 with the Liverpool left-back hanging out a leg into the run of the Napoli midfielder. And it certainly looked a dive by Callej\u00f3n on review. VAR decreed otherwise. Not a clear and obvious error, apparently. \u201cThe game-changer,\u201d said Klopp. In the desperate push for an equaliser Virgil van Dijk played a hasty back-pass straight to Fernando Llorente and the former Tottenham striker sealed Liverpool\u2019s fate by prodding home his first Napoli goal.\n\nNapoli v Liverpool: Champions League \u2013 live! Read more\n\nKlopp had every right to lament the VAR rule book but the late defensive lapses and the failure to capitalise on several excellent openings also stymied Liverpool\u2019s improvement in Naples. They were here with a point to prove having produced the worst performance of their campaign here last October. That was the first of three away defeats in the group stage and the Champions League still made its way back to Anfield so there will be no hand-wringing over this setback. Once again, however, Carlo Ancelotti and Napoli served up a frustrating night.\n\nAncelotti outfoxed Liverpool last season with two \u201cNo 6s\u201d and a central defender, Nikola Maksimovic, at right-back. This time the coach who has won and lost Champions League finals against Liverpool opted for a more offensive approach, with Hirving Lozano partnering Mertens up front and his captain, Lorenzo Insigne, the match-winner at San Paolo last season, targeting Trent Alexander-Arnold down the Napoli left. It made for an open and highly entertaining contest between two teams willing to commit forward in numbers at the earliest opportunity. That it remained goalless so long stemmed in no small part to the quality of the four central defenders on display.\n\nChelsea v Valencia: Champions League \u2013 live! Read more\n\nKalidou Koulibaly is to Napoli what Van Dijk is to Liverpool and the hosts\u2019 defensive rock was the game\u2019s dominant force in the first half as he halted dangerous raids from Roberto Firmino and Mohamed Salah. The timing and power of his challenges brought regular roars of approval from the home crowd. With Fabinho equally impressive in central midfield Liverpool frequently created space in which their front three usually wreak havoc. Koulibaly, Kostas Manolas and their fellow defenders were having none of it, however, and Alex Meret had only one save to make from Sadio Man\u00e9 before the break.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mohamed Salah struggled to have an impact on the game.

The Liverpool keeper parried the midfielder\u2019s powerful shot at full stretch and repeated the trick when the rebound gave Fabi\u00e1n a second bite. Lozano headed home from Adri\u00e1n\u2019s second save but was clearly offside and his celebrations were correctly short-lived.\n\nThe game continued to flow both ways. James Milner skied over after Salah had escaped Koulibaly\u2019s attentions for the first time and teed up the midfielder on the edge of the area. Milner almost returned the favour when Liverpool broke dangerously through Jordan Henderson and Man\u00e9 but, with Salah lurking unmarked at the back post, his low cross was cut out by the sliding M\u00e1rio Rui. Firmino headed the subsequent corner from Salah just wide.\n\nRoss Barkley\u2019s penalty miss costs Chelsea as Valencia win opener Read more\n\nNeapolitan heads were in hands early in the second half after Adri\u00e1n produced a stunning save to prevent Mertens making the breakthrough. Liverpool were prised open when Insigne released M\u00e1rio Rui down the left \u2013 Alexander-Arnold received little protection all night \u2013 and the home full-back floated a delightful cross to the back post that evaded Van Dijk and Mertens met with a flying volley. The Belgium international was imagining his goal celebration when Adri\u00e1n somehow tipped over a shot that was destined for the top corner at close range. Mertens was left in disbelief instead.\n\nLiverpool should have capitalised when Man\u00e9 beat Insigne to a clearance from a Napoli corner and led a two versus one break deep into the home half. Salah was begging for the ball inside. Man\u00e9 delayed, delayed and eventually overhit the pass into his unmarked teammate. Unlike at Burnley, it was Man\u00e9 offering apologies this time.\n\nSalah did get his chance to beat Meret moments later when Manolas miscued an attempted clearance from Koulibaly\u2019s header. The ball dropped invitingly for the Egyptian, who swept a left-footed shot towards the bottom corner only for the Napoli goalkeeper to make a superb finger-tip save.\n\nLiverpool took control against increasingly chaotic hosts as the game entered the closing stages and looked the more likely victor until Mertens invited Callej\u00f3n to attack Robertson.
