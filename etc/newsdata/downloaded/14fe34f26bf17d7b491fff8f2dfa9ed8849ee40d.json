So it was for me when I picked up The Power of Chowa by Akemi Tanaka (Headline, \u00a312.99) at the beginning of October. Lifestyle guides based on Japanese philosophies and culture have been everywhere for the past decade but if you took Marie Kondo\u2019s controversial advice earlier this year and threw away all your books, then perhaps you have a little room for this one.\n\nAs it is written in Japanese, chowa is a word consisting of two symbols. The first, cho, means \u201csearch\u201d. The second, wa, means \u201cbalance\u201d. So, at its simplest chowa means a search for balance. A striving for harmony.\n\nTanaka grew up in Japan but now lives in London, where she teaches Japanese culture and etiquette. She is descended from a family of 15th-century samurai and their historical sense of valour and chivalry punctuates her work. What makes chowa seem so relevant for now, however, is that it isn\u2019t just about personal improvement. It\u2019s also about what each of us can give to the world.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIn The Power of Chowa Tanaka tackles sustainability, climate change and the #MeToo movement. She asks how we can bring about positive changes in our wider communities. And she walks the talk. In 2011, she was given a \u201cPoints of Light\u201d award by the British government for her charity work in aid of the orphans of the 2011 tsunami. If you\u2019re not ready to change the world, the chowa philosophy can be easily applied at home. Tanaka divides her exploration of chowa into three parts: finding your own balance, living in harmony with others, and balancing what\u2019s most important. At the beginning of October, I chose a chapter from each section to live by for a few days.\n\nThe first was \u201cFinding our style\u201d and it concentrated on clothes. Why do we dress the way we do? How do our clothes make us feel? What do they say about us? Tanaka talks of wearing a kimono that once belonged to her grandmother. The design incorporates a dragonfly. The dragonfly is revered in martial arts for having a 360-degree field of vision \u2013 a valuable asset for any samurai. Tanaka writes: \u201cWhenever I feel that I need to ready myself for an important event, one in which I have to be at my most alert, I wear this kimono. It helps me feel rooted and stable, a little like my grandmother is protecting me.\u201d\n\nWhenever I feel that I need to ready myself for an important event, one in which I have to be at my most alert, I wear this kimono. It helps me feel rooted and stable, a little like my grandmother is protecting me\n\nI don\u2019t have any hand-me-downs from my mother or grandmothers, alas. I\u2019m at least half a metre too tall for that. But as I read about Tanaka\u2019s dragonfly kimono, the power of symbolism in clothing was being echoed in the news. It was a week in which my Facebook and Instagram feeds were full of people proudly wearing the newly delivered spider brooches they\u2019d ordered in honour of Lady Hale, first woman justice of the supreme court, who delivered that court\u2019s blistering judgment on Boris Johnson\u2019s prorogation of parliament. Her spider brooch, which seemed to be a nod to Sir Walter Scott\u2019s couplet, \u201cOh what a tangled web we weave / When first we practice to deceive\u201d, quickly spawned a thousand memes and a lucrative line of T-shirts. Judging by my friends\u2019 posts, the symbolism of the spider was helping them feel better about the tangled situation in Westminster.\n\nThinking of Tanaka\u2019s dragonfly and Lady Hale\u2019s spider, I dug out my own lucky brooch: a lobster embroidered in sapphire blue thread with tiny pearl beads for eyes. Pinning it on to a jumper always makes me smile. It sparks conversation, even if a lot of the time, people ask if I\u2019m a Scorpio when they see it. \u201cStyle is sharing what you love with others,\u201d says Tanaka. \u201cWhen we start to lead with what we feel makes us different from others \u2013 even with what we feel makes us unique \u2013 this can actually help us find our tribe\u2026\u201d\n\nMy lobster brooch is hardly daring but I think Tanaka is right that little flashes of personality in our clothing are important when it comes to welcoming the right people into our lives. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that my sister\u2019s decision to dye her hair bright pink coincided with her embarking on a new career in mental health care for young people. As Tanaka puts it: \u201cWhen we lead with what makes us different, we send a powerful outward sign of inner commitment to others: that we will accept what makes other people different too.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019ll be a while before you see me with primary coloured hair, but my wardrobe contained other opportunities to get chowa. Regarding living in harmony with others, in \u201cFinding Our Balance with Nature\u201d, Tanaka introduces the concept of Mottainai, which translates as \u201cno waste\u201d.\n\n\u201cHow would a society in which we always repaired or replaced items, rather than buying new ones, work in practice?\u201d Tanaka asks.\n\nMy neighbourhood seems to be moving in the right direction. Taking my favourite boots to be reheeled for the fifth winter running, I fell into conversation with Danny the cobbler, who reported that business is booming. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t just throwing shoes away like they used to.\u201d Maybe it\u2019s economic uncertainty but maybe it\u2019s a change of priorities. New isn\u2019t always better. There is something wonderful about reheeled shoes that don\u2019t have to be broken in. Wabi-sabi \u2013 finding beauty in imperfection and even in decay \u2013 is part of the chowa way of things too.\n\nWhen we lead with what makes us different, we send a powerful outward sign of inner commitment to others: that we will accept what makes other people different too\n\nIn the very last chapter of her book, \u201cTreasuring Every Meeting\u201d, which forms part of the section on balancing what\u2019s most important, Tanaka describes the famous Japanese tea ceremony, which she herself practises as a \u201cmasterclass in mindfulness and gratitude\u201d.\n\nTanaka also introduces the concept of ichi-go, ichi-e. One time, one meeting. \u201cThis short phrase encourages us to appreciate each moment as it happens ... We don\u2019t know what tomorrow will bring. In the age of the samurai, the tea ceremony was practised with the knowledge that anyone in attendance, particularly samurai, could leave the room never to return.\u201d\n\nOn the day I read about the tea ceremony, I received the news that a friend\u2019s father had died. As I remembered the quiet, kind man who was endlessly forbearing as we teenagers sprawled about his home, it brought to mind a wider loss. I am of the age where many of my contemporaries are saying goodbye to their parents. The generation above us is thinning out and fading away. Thirty years after our parents shuttled us around rural Gloucestershire to 18th birthday parties, we are finally becoming \u201cthe grown-ups\u201d. And sometimes that\u2019s scary.\n\nAs one might expect, Tanaka has chowa wisdom for the autumn of life too. \u201cLiving our lives mindful of chowa teaches us that the search for balance is an active one\u2026 You may feel like there\u2019s nothing you can do about growing older\u2026 We worry about what we are going to do with the rest of our lives, and about what we will leave behind. But we need to remember that, as we grow older, we never stop learning. We grow into acceptance\u2026 We grow into fearlessness\u2026 We grow closer to one another.\u201d We realise that there\u2019s just this one time.\n\nWith Tanaka\u2019s words in mind, I made a plan right then to meet up with another childhood friend ASAP. The Japanese tea ceremony is a ritual of unparalleled elegance. Sharing a cuppa in a south London cafe doesn\u2019t have quite the same class, but it has the same intention of reaffirming friendship and connection.\n\nSlowing down, noticing beauty and creating a little beauty of your own. Thinking about how your actions affect those around you. Seeking harmony. They\u2019re all worthwhile goals. Though it draws on the ancient and arcane, The Power of Chowa feels like a good guide for this moment in time, when bad manners seem to be everywhere and taking more care of the planet is an emergency. Following Tanaka\u2019s wisdom is an easy way to start making life feel just a little more balanced.", "description": "One of the truly great pleasures in life, for me at least, is picking up a book and unexpectedly discovering between its pages the exact wisdom or comfort you need at that very moment.
