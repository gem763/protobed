They were super-secret. The first hearing, in which the witness was former Ukraine special envoy Kurt Volker, was held in what is known as a SCIF, which stands for sensitive compartmented information facility. It is a room in the Capitol, built to be impervious to electronic surveillance so that lawmakers can discuss the nation\u2019s most important secrets without fear of discovery.\n\nThe second hearing, in which intelligence community inspector general Michael Atkinson testified, was also held in the SCIF.\n\nWere highly classified matters discussed at the Volker and Atkinson hearings? Apparently not. Neither interview was classified. And even if some classified information were involved, it would be astonishing for Democrats to believe they could attempt to remove the president on the basis of information that is not available to the public.\n\nThe secrecy, decreed by House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff, has taken Republicans by surprise. Some are now speaking out about it.", "description": "", "authors": ["Byron York", "Washingtonexaminer.Com Opinion Columnists End-Impeachment-Secrecy"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
