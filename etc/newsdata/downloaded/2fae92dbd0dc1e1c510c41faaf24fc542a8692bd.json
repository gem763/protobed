On Tuesday, the White House said that it was ending all cooperation with the inquiry, an attempt to stem the political damage caused by a saga Mr Giuliani helped set in motion.\n\nOn Wednesday, two associates who helped on his Ukrainian inquiries were arrested trying to flee the US and charged with campaign finance violations. By the end of the week, Mr Giuliani was fending off speculation that he was in prosecutors\u2019 crosshairs, while Mr Trump distanced himself from the scandal.\n\nSo it is a surprise when Mr Giuliani\u2019s call comes through, even though it is pre-arranged. He gives one caveat to his willingness to be grilled, saying the two arrested men are largely off limits, given \u201cattorney-client privilege\u201d.\n\nTrump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani leaves the Civil Court in Manhattan in march this year - Polaris / eyevine More\n\nMr Giuliani, the former New York mayor turned arch Trump defender, begins by spelling out his familiar claims over Ukraine \u2013 the ones that ultimately, and inadvertently, led to impeachment.\n\nSince spring, he\u2019s been the leading promoter of the theory that Mr Biden, as vice president, lobbied to remove a Ukrainian prosecutor investigating the company that employed his son.\n\nThe drive, coming after years as a Trump acolyte, has seen Mr Giuliani\u2019s public persona morph from \u201cAmerica\u2019s Mayor\u201d, when he steered New York through the aftermath of 9/11, into something much more partisan.\n\nBut what of his motives. Surely it is not just a happy coincidence that Mr Biden is a leading candidate at the 2020 election? Is Mr Giuliani shouting about this now because it politically benefits the president?\n\nDonald Trump with Rudy Giuliani in new York in 2015 More\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s totally false! I started doing this before Biden was a candidate.\u201d He says it was only when some Ukrainians approached him with the information in November 2018 that he took it up. But that was only a year ago, when Biden was topping the polls and expected to run?", "description": "As a man at the very heart of Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment crisis, it should be no surprise that Rudy Giuliani can be a little prickly. \u201cI can talk about almost everything,\u201d he cheerily begins his interview with The Sunday Telegraph, the first with a British outlet since the scandal erupted.
