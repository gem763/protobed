Look to the Northeast for a rich one most likely to land you a great job. For great bang for your buck, consider the City University of New York.\n\nThese are some of the conclusions of this year\u2019s Wall Street Journal/Times Higher Education College Rankings, which reveal a rich array of options for students whether they\u2019re most focused on the academic environment, extracurricular engagement, career opportunities or return on investment.\n\nFour Ivy League schools rank among the top five. Harvard University stands atop the overall list, followed by its Cambridge neighbor, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nYale University and the University of Pennsylvania are next, with the California Institute of Technology and Princeton University tied for fifth.\n\nEXPLORE THE FULL RANKINGS You can filter the WSJ/THE full rankings or customize them to focus on your own priorities. VIEW Interactive\n\n(You can sort the complete rankings by a variety of measures and reweight the main contributing factors to reflect what\u2019s most important to you.)\n\nSchools that fared the best in this year\u2019s ranking generally are wealthy institutions able to support robust research operations, low student-faculty ratios and generous financial aid. Their graduates tend to land high-paying jobs that allow them to pay down student loans. But those schools are all over the map in terms of how engaged students say they feel inside and outside the classroom, and in the diversity of the student body and school staff.\n\nThe top-ranked schools show neither size nor locality matters when it comes to quality, with similarly ranked schools ranging from roughly 2,600 undergraduates (Wellesley College, in Massachusetts, No. 24) to 32,000 (the University of California, Los Angeles, No. 25). Urban schools such as the University of Chicago (No. 14) and Columbia University (No. 15) landed near rural powerhouses like Dartmouth College (No. 12) and Williams College (No. 21).\n\nThe WSJ/THE rankings emphasize how well a college will prepare students for life after graduation. The overall ranking is based on 15 factors across four main categories: Forty percent of each school\u2019s overall score comes from student outcomes, including measures of graduate salaries and debt burdens, 30% from the school\u2019s academic resources, 20% from how well it engages its students and 10% from its diversity.\n\nThe rankings this year take into account roughly 174,000 responses from students to survey questions including whether they feel inspired and motivated by their classmates, whether they think their college is worth what they and their families are paying, and if they\u2019d choose the same school if they had to start all over again.\n\nThis year\u2019s rankings come out in the wake of a scandal in which many wealthy parents paid to fraudulently raise their students\u2019 test scores or got them into schools by faking their athletic accomplishments\u2014raising questions about the fairness of a process presumed to be based on merit.\n\nThe Top Ten These schools achieved the highest overall scores in the Wall Street Journal/Times Higher Education College Rankings Harvard University Massachusetts Institute of Technology Yale University University of Pennsylvania California Institute of Technology Princeton University Brown University Stanford University Cornell University Duke University\n\nThe rankings also land as a debate over the role, cost and value of a four-year diploma continues to rage. A college education still pays off, with the wage premium over high-school graduates near an all-time high. But the wealth-generating power a four-year degree is undercut by the staggering increase in college costs in recent decades, and heavy student-debt burdens can blunt earnings for some. And since nearly 40% of students won\u2019t graduate from college in six years, let alone four, and student debt continues to climb, deciding where to go has become increasingly fraught with risk.\n\n\u201cYoung people today are facing a situation where the stakes are higher,\u201d says economist William Emmons of the St. Louis Federal Reserve. \u201cBack in the day when college was free and there weren\u2019t many college graduates in the market, you could major in the proverbial basket weaving and still get a decent job. But today that\u2019s probably not as likely.\u201d\n\nMr. Emmons\u2019s advice to families considering a college degree: Sharpen your pencils. Leverage the available data. Treat college like the significant, and potentially risky, investment it is.\n\nOutcomes, resources and value\n\nThese are the fourth annual WSJ/THE rankings, and while the overall approach and much of the underlying methodology have remained constant, this year\u2019s rankings aren\u2019t directly comparable to those of past years because of two changes. The approach to measuring student debt shifted to highlight how much the average graduate will owe, as opposed to the likelihood they\u2019ll default on that total. And the rankings now incorporate a more comprehensive degree-completion metric that better assesses the chance that any entering student will make it through to commencement.\n\nTop Schools for Resources The schools that ranked highest for resources, based on academic spending, student-faculty ratios and research output California Institute of Technology Harvard University Massachusetts Institute of Technology Princeton University Brown University Vanderbilt University Rice University Northwestern University Columbia University University of Pennsylvania\n\nAt the heart of the rankings are outcomes: How much value does the school add to its students\u2019 future financial lives? Which colleges can open doors with name recognition, and which have a good record of placing graduates into high-paying jobs while limiting debt and allowing students to complete their degrees quickly?\n\nThat subset of the ranking is topped by Harvard and Princeton (tied at No. 1), followed by Yale and Duke University (tied at No. 3), and Penn and Stanford University (tied at No. 5). Harvard, Princeton and Duke leave students who participate in federal financial-aid programs with the second-, third- and fourth-lowest amount of student debt in the country, respectively. Cornell University\u2019s ascension into the top 10 overall ranking, at No. 9, was due in part to the updated and more comprehensive graduation-rate measure used this year.\n\nTeaching\u2014truly investing in students\u2019 intellectual development, with engaging, hands-on projects and individualized attention\u2014is an expensive proposition. The WSJ/THE rankings look at student-faculty ratios, academic spending per student and research output to measure how well equipped an institution is to provide that comprehensive instruction. The takeaway: Money matters. All but four schools ranked in the top 25 overall are also among the 25 most well-resourced. Schools able to do more with less include UCLA, which is 25th overall but ranked No. 124 in resources, the University of California, San Diego (37th overall and No. 169 in resources) and the University of Florida (63rd overall and No. 343 in resources).\n\nJust How Hard Is It to Get Into an Ivy? Nationally top-ranked Harvard accepted a record-low 4.5% of applicants for the current academic year. Acceptance rates topped 10% at only one Ivy League school: Brown Penn Dartmouth Cornell Harvard Columbia Princeton Yale 6.6% 7.4% 7.9% 10.6% 4.5% 5.1% 5.8% 5.9% Brown Penn Dartmouth Harvard Cornell Columbia Princeton Yale 6.6% 7.4% 7.9% 4.5% 10.6% 5.1% 5.8% 5.9% Brown Penn Dartmouth Cornell Harvard Columbia Princeton Yale 6.6% 7.4% 7.9% 10.6% 4.5% 5.1% 5.8% 5.9% Harvard Columbia Princeton Yale 4.5% 5.1% 5.8% 5.9% Brown Penn Dartmouth Cornell 6.6% 7.4% 7.9% 10.6%\n\nThe rankings also measure the best value among the top 250 schools overall, by dividing each school\u2019s overall score by its net price. Here campuses from the City University of New York system took three of the top four spots. Public schools hold 15 of the top 20. Number one is Berea College, a private liberal-arts college in Kentucky, where students hold down campus jobs and pay no tuition.\n\nEngagement and diversity\n\nSurprisingly, schools with solid outcomes don\u2019t necessarily leave students feeling warm and fuzzy about their experience on campus, and often that\u2019s because they may not feel like they are part of a community.\n\nTop Schools for Student Outcomes The schools ranked highest for graduation rate, teaching reputation, graduate salaries and student debt Harvard University Princeton University Duke University Yale University University of Pennsylvania Stanford University Cornell University California Institute of Technology Johns Hopkins University University of Chicago Dartmouth College\n\nThe rankings base their engagement measure on how connected students feel to their school, each other and the outside world. Ball State University, which didn\u2019t crack the top 600 overall, earned the No. 16 spot on our measure of engagement. Princeton, meanwhile, which is No. 5 overall, came it at No. 498 on engagement.\n\nMany schools with engaged student bodies have strong spiritual missions. Seven of the schools that scored in the top 10 in that category have a religious affiliation. They include the top two for engagement, Dordt University and Cedarville University, both of which rank below 400 overall, Samford University (No. 170 overall), the University of Notre Dame (No. 32), Brigham Young University-Provo (No. 143), Baylor University (No. 167) and Oral Roberts University, which ranks below 600 overall.\n\nAn important part of the learning experience for college students is being exposed to ideas and people they wouldn\u2019t otherwise encounter. The WSJ/THE rankings\u2019 environment metric takes into account the share of the student population that\u2019s international, as well as student and faculty racial and ethnic diversity, and socioeconomic diversity among students. The West Coast dominates here, home to nine schools in the top 10 for diversity. Public institutions also outperform on this measure, with 21 schools in the top 25.\n\nThe rankings also unveil some hidden gems: Alverno College in Milwaukee tied with Stanford for students reporting that they are inspired by their classmates, while the University of Wyoming and Louisiana Tech University both matched Princeton for students saying their college experience was worth the expense.\n\nBelow Sticker Price The percentage of first-time, full-time freshmen who received insitutional grants, and the average institutional grant as a percentage of tuition and fees 90 % Percentage who received grants 80 70 60 Average percentage of tuition and fees 50 40 2007\u2013 \u201908 2008\u2013 \u201909 2009\u2013 \u201910 2010\u2013 \u201911 2011\u2013 \u201912 2012\u2013 \u201913 2013\u2013 \u201914 2014\u2013 \u201915 2015\u2013 \u201916 2016\u2013 \u201917 2017\u2013 \u201918 2018\u2013 \u201919* Academic year 90 % Percentage who received grants 80 70 60 Average percentage of tuition and fees 50 40 2007\u2013 \u201908 2008\u2013 \u201909 2009\u2013 \u201910 2010\u2013 \u201911 2011\u2013 \u201912 2012\u2013 \u201913 2013\u2013 \u201914 2014\u2013 \u201915 2015\u2013 \u201916 2016\u2013 \u201917 2017\u2013 \u201918 2018\u2013 \u201919* Academic year 90 % Percentage who received grants 80 70 60 Average percentage of tuition and fees 50 40 2007\u2013 \u201908 2008\u2013 \u201909 2009\u2013 \u201910 2010\u2013 \u201911 2011\u2013 \u201912 2012\u2013 \u201913 2013\u2013 \u201914 2014\u2013 \u201915 2015\u2013 \u201916 2016\u2013 \u201917 2017\u2013 \u201918 2018\u2013 \u201919* Academic year 90 % Percentage who received grants 80 70 60 Average percentage of tuition and fees 50 40 2008\u2013 \u201909 2010\u2013 \u201911 2012\u2013 \u201913 2014\u2013 \u201915 2016\u2013 \u201917 2018\u2013 \u201919* Academic year\n\nNo school, of course, is best for everyone. Some students may flourish in a large institution with a big sports culture, while others value a more intimate setting with robust arts offerings. Urban or rural, liberal arts or research-heavy, each school has unique characteristics worth exploring.\n\nShare Your Thoughts What do you think about college rankings as a means for finding a quality college experience? Join the conversation below.\n\nThe list of 801 colleges and universities in the WSJ/THE rankings is intended to serve as a starting point for families considering their options and comes with one important caveat: Research shows again and again that what matters in the end isn\u2019t so much where you go to college that counts, but how you go. What you major in, how hard you study, where you intern and what connections and relationships you build with classmates and professors can trump the name of the institution on a diploma.\n\nMs. Korn is a Wall Street Journal reporter in New York.
