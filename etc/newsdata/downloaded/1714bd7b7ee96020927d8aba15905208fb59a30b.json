Smith labels Antonio Brown as 'phony'; Brown renews desire to rejoin Patriots", "language": "en", "text": "Noted ESPN host Stephen A. Smith labeled troubled wide receiver Antonio Brown as \u201cphony\u201d after the latter asked the New England Patriots to re-sign him. Brown drew Smith\u2019s ire after the wide receiver, through Instagram Live, called the Patriots to let him earn his salary on the field as they will pay him anyway. Smith, during an episode of ESPN\u2019s First Take on Thursday, slammed Smith for making such a claim because his grievance against the Patriots is yet to be decided.\n\nAccording to Smith, the first word that comes to his mind when thinking about Brown is \u201cphony\u201d for claiming in an earlier ESPN interview that he doesn\u2019t need football and the money. \u201cSo now you\u2019re talking about money and football. Really? Now that you\u2019re not playing,\u201d Smith said. Brown\u2019s tenure with the Patriots was short-lived as he was cut 11 days after the team due to legal troubles. After the Oakland Raiders cut him before the start of the season, the Patriots signed him to a one-year deal worth $15 million.\n\nBrown again expresses interest in returning to Patriots\n\nIn another post on Instagram, Brown again expressed his desire to return to the Patriots\u2019 fold. Brown posted a photo of X-Men character Wolverine while holding and touching a picture frame. In the picture frame is a photo of Brown wearing his No. 17 jersey with the Patriots.

Howe said there\u2019s absolutely no chance for a reunion between the Patriots and Brown, based on what transpired on the day that the team released the 31-year-old wideout.\n\nBrown recently filed grievance vs Patriots, Raiders\n\nBrown recently filed grievance against the Raiders and the Patriots to claim around $40 million in unpaid salaries and bonuses.\n\nFrom the Raiders, Brown was trying to recoup one week's salary worth $860,294, guaranteed money worth $29 million, and a $1 million signing bonus. The troubled wideout also challenged the $215,000 fine imposed on him for violating several team rules. Brown also wants the Patriots to cough up around $64,000 for his Week 1 salary and his guaranteed base salary of $1.025 million. He also wants Patriots CEO Robert Kraft to pay his $9 million signing bonus.\n\nEarlier, sources disclosed that Kraft wouldn\u2019t pay Brown after the wide receiver criticized him on social media for his arrest in a spa in Florida. Despite cutting Brown, the Patriots are left with a dead salary cap hit of $5.5 million this season and $4.5 million in 2020 from his one-year deal.", "description": "In another post on Instagram, Brown again expressed his desire to return to the Patriots.", "authors": ["Oliver Vandervoort", "Zeegee Cecilio", "Read More On The Same Topic Zeegee Cecilio", "Bengals", "Green", "Potential Patriots Trade Target", "Is Ready For Anything Before Deadline", "Ex-Patriots' Tight End Ben Watson Calls Tom Brady", "Ultimate Competitor", "Patriots Rumor"], "top_image": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2019/10/11/os/b_1200x630/smith-slammed-brown-during-an-episode-of-espns-first-take-on-thursday-image-credit-blxrr-highlightsyoutube_2337383.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
