Analysts, however, argue that there is limited scope to spending that money.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India said Monday the central bank will transfer 1.76 trillion Indian rupees (about $24.6 billion) as dividend to New Delhi for the year that ended on June 30, 2019. That was higher than what the market had been expecting.\n\nThe RBI follows a 12-month period that runs from July to June and pays an annual dividend to the government based on its profits. Dividend is a sum of money paid annually by a company or a bank to its shareholders out of its profits.\n\nLast year, the RBI board formed a committee to look into how much the central bank should hold in its reserves amid a push from the government to access the surplus for stimulus packages.\n\nThis week's move from the central bank could provide Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government with some breathing room. However, the move by the government to dip into central bank reserves in order to fund fiscal deficits has received wide criticisms.\n\nOn one hand, India needs policies to help prop up growth, which has slowed considerably in recent quarters. On the other hand, it needs to maintain the 3.3% fiscal deficit target set for the current year \u2014 or risk denting investor confidence in India.\n\nThe government had budgeted for around 900 billion rupees as dividend from the RBI for the year ending March 31, 2020, Citi analysts wrote in a note on Monday.\n\nTaking into account the interim dividend that the central bank has already paid, the government is set to make additional gains of about 576 billion rupees, or approximately 0.3% of the GDP, according to calculations done by the Citi analysts. They explained that Monday's announcement is a one-time \"excess capital\" and removes the possibility of such large transfers over the next several years.\n\nIn early July, India's former Finance Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg said that the government expects 900 billion rupees as dividend from the RBI in the current fiscal year, according to local media reports.", "description": "The Reserve Bank of India's decision to transfer $24.6 billion to the government may not spur new stimulus measures, experts say.", "authors": ["Saheli Roy Choudhury"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105984031-1561361830393gettyimages-120719501.jpeg?v=1566967148"}
