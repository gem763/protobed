What was he going to do if Jimmy pulled out his Apple Music? After fans waited all night for Kanye\u2019s new album, Jesus Is King, he finally tweeted at around 1 a.m. ET, saying that they were fixing mixes on three songs: \u201cWater,\u201d \u201cFollow God,\u201d and \u201cEverything We Need.\u201d \u201cWe are not going to sleep until this album is out!\u201d he added. Better not! To paraphrase Tanisha Thomas from Bad Girls Club, \u201cI ain\u2019t get no sleep \u2019cause of Kanye? Kanye not gon\u2019 get no sleep \u2019cause of me.\u201d\n\nTo my fans\n\n\n\nThank you for being loyal & patient\n\n\n\nWe are specifically fixing mixes on \u201cEverything We Need\u201d \u201cFollow God\u201d & \u201cWater\u201d\n\n\n\nWe not going to sleep until this album is out! \u2014 ye (@kanyewest) October 25, 2019\n\nFor the rest of his appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live! Kanye spoke about his relationship to God as a father, as a musician, and as a millionaire. \u201cI\u2019m just a Christian everything,\u201d he says. On Friday night, Kanye will allegedly be back in Brooklyn to perform a song from Jesus Is King on Kimmel.
