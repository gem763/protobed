If you go to 80 per cent of the games you get priority in buying tickets,\u201d Coelho told Reuters.\n\n\u201cIf I am a member and I pay 139 reais a month then I get a discount. There are around four games a month and so tickets are just 35 reais each match.\u201d\n\nModern arenas built for the 2014 World Cup held in Brazil have made going to the games a more enjoyable experience and the decision to ban away fans from local derbies in Sao Paulo, where three of the four teams with the biggest attendances are based, has made hooliganism less of a concern.\n\nA decision to allow clubs to play up to five \u201chome\u201d games a year in an alternative city of their choice has also led to big attendances in places where fans are not accustomed to seeing the top teams in action.\n\nFLAMENGO FORM\n\nOther experts highlighted the increasingly competitive form of Flamengo, arguably the biggest club in Brazil and one leading the league after a pre-season spending spree.\n\nFlamengo, who have also qualified for semi-finals of the Copa Libertadores for the first time since the early 1980s, have a league-leading average attendance of 47,477 this season at the Maracana stadium.\n\nAlmost 66,000 people watched them beat Palmeiras last weekend.\n\nCoelho said it was early to celebrate and that Brazilian football still has a long way to go to match the big leagues in Europe. The average attendance is still well below that of England, Germany, Spain and Italy.\n\nFlamengo\u2019s average this season would still only put them eighth out of England\u2019s top clubs and third in Scotland.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always spoken about fans deserting the stadium but they were never at the stadiums,\u201d\u201d Coelho said. \u201cThe culture in Brazil has always been to go to the big games and not bother about the less important ones.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t get carried away with this but might not be the end either. I think that this is spurred on by four of the biggest clubs discovering formulas that work. The challenge now is to get fans going to all the games and not just the big ones.\u201d", "description": "The game is slow and beset by fouls, every match is on TV, and all the best young players have left - but if attendances are any measure, Brazilian football is enjoying a renaissance.", "authors": ["Andrew Downie", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1426325488&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF832H3"}
