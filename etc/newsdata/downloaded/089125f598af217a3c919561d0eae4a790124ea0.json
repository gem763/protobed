It is unsure whether China\u2019s increased pork purchases from the US farms would suffice to improve the outcome of the upcoming US-China meeting, but it sure won\u2019t cause any harm.\n\n\n\nBack to the equity markets, the S&P500 (-0.84%) fell the most in a month. The Dow Jones closed 0.53% lower, as Nasdaq dived 1.56%. US futures were mixed in Asia.\n\n\n\nEquities in Japan traded in the red, as the Japanese yen rallied to 107.00 against the US dollar on a safe-haven rush.\n\n\n\nHang Seng (-0.95%) and Shanghai\u2019s Composite (-0.57%) fell, as well. News that China\u2019s startup boom may be dwindling due to drying venture capital pools amid heightened trade tensions between the US and China may have further demoralized investors, on top of rising anxiety that Chinese Communist Party\u2019s 70th anniversary celebrations on October 1st may tear Hong Kong and China further apart and fuel violence over the coming weekend.\n\n\n\nThe US dollar recovered a part of Tuesday\u2019s losses in Asia, but its gains remained limited. The New Zealand dollar was the only gainer against the greenback among the G10 currencies after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) kept its official cash rate unchanged at 1% as expected.\n\n\n\nDeveloped countries\u2019 sovereign yields fell, as risk-averse investors moved the capital to less risky government bonds. The US 10-year yield crashed below 1.63%, as gold rallied to $1535 an ounce.\n\n\n\nOil prices tumbled on the back of a dampened market mood amid Trump\u2019s impeachment inquiry and news that Saudi made better-than-expected progress in restoring output in the world\u2019s biggest oil production plants. WTI crude is preparing to challenge the 200-day moving average, at $56.40 a barrel. A further fall toward the $55 mark is now on the cards.\n\n\n\nThe FTSE 100 closed below the 7300p mark on Tuesday. Energy and mining stocks were the worst-performing industries in London and should follow up on Asian session losses as investors in London walk-in at the Wednesday open.\n\n\n\nThe FTSE is expected to open 17 points lower at 7274p.\n\n\n\nThe pound sterling, on the other hand, advanced to the 1.25 mark against the US dollar after the Supreme Court decided that Boris Johnson\u2019s suspension of Parliament was unlawful and allowed British MPs to reconvene immediately. The Parliament will resume today. But we are forced to note that the court decision didn\u2019t inspire the pound-bulls that much. Gains in sterling remained timid, as the quick fix to prevent a no-deal Brexit by the end of October or bringing Parliament back wouldn\u2019t solve the core Brexit problem.\n\n\n\nAlthough there has been no progress in Brexit talks this week as Johnson met key European names on the occasion of UN General Assembly, the political frame in the UK is a touch better than what it was following Boris Johnson\u2019s election as Prime Minister. Parliament is back, and Johnson has his hands tied with a legal ban to crash the country out of the European Union if there is not a satisfactory deal by October 31st. Such a deal is unlikely.\n\n\n\nThen, what happens? A snap general election appears to be the most plausible scenario to overcome the deadlock among British policymakers. Highly cautious, Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn wants the election to happen just after the October 31st deadline, to avert the risk of a potential no-deal exit if Johnson happened to find a loophole to get around the legislation that forbids him to seal a no-deal Brexit with the EU. \u2018We can\u2019t trust Johnson not to crash out with no deal,\u2019 Corbyn said.\n\n\n\nTuesday\u2019s price action gave a rapid insight into the upside potential in sterling. It appears that the thick layer of offers above the 1.25 mark against the US dollar will stand strong against a further positive attempt, if there is no concrete progress in Brexit talks, or if the US dollar doesn\u2019t take another dive due to the overheating political scene across the Pacific amid Trump\u2019s impeachment talks.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpening calls\n\n\n\nto open 17 points lower at 7274\n\n\n\nto open 60 points lower at 12282\n\nDisclaimer: The information and comments provided herein under no circumstances are to be considered an offer or solicitation to invest and nothing herein should be construed as investment advice.
