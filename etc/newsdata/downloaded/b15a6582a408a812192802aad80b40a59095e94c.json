'I don't know that you're not an openly heroin user. You see how that works? Think before you write.'\n\nNevertheless, his publicist Harlan Boll stated Taylor was survived by his longtime partner Robert Fortney.\n\nHe was also briefly married to Las Vegas showgirl Rusty Rowe.\n\nPrivate life: Taylor was referred to as openly gay late in his career, though he disputed the designation.

Lowe in 1990.\n\n'I knew I was a ham in those hallways because you had to wear a black suit and black knickers. And you'd all have to go under the catacombs to get to the Senate office building, the House office building and Supreme Court to get a document for the congressman and the senator. But I went straight through the rotunda with all the tourists.\n\n'I would say, \"Paging Senator Bilbo,\" who was hot at the time. He was the one in the papers. I was so hammy even then.

I was dying like hell on Merv Griffin's show. The jokes were dumb, and I tore the five by eight cards, threw them up in the air and it became confetti,' he explained in a 2011 interview with Classic Television Showbiz.\n\n'I knocked over his desk, walked up the aisle, went to Sardi's and said, \"Well, that's the end of my television career.\" I went home that night. Their switchboard had lit up. They said, \"Get the guy that went crazy!\" And that is how the confetti started.'\n\nLater in life, Taylor would appear as himself in Wayne's World 2 and the first three Jacka** films.\n\nHe also appeared on the cult sketch comedy series The Kids In The Hall, Will & Grace, and The Suite Life Of Zack & Cody.", "description": "Prop comedian Rip Taylor died Sunday in Beverly Hills at 84.
