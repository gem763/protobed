Staffers are also studying proposals that would allow cryptocurrencies to be counted toward international reserves, now near a three-decade low at $7.9 billion.\n\nU.S. sanctions against Nicolas Maduro\u2019s authoritarian regime have largely isolated Venezuela from the global financial system, exacerbating one of world\u2019s most severe economic crises and forcing officials to use a patchwork of methods to move money around. While Maduro\u2019s plans to start the world\u2019s first sovereign crypto largely failed, the continued efforts to use digital currencies shows how desperate the government is to come up with a way to skirt the restrictions.\n\nPress officials for the central bank and PDVSA didn\u2019t reply to requests for comment.\n\nIt isn\u2019t clear how PDVSA came to own Bitcoin and Ethereum, or the value of its holdings. But the oil producer has struggled to get paid by customers via conventional channels because major banks are hesitant to do business with a sanctioned entity. Last month, the company received most of a $700 million payment in Chinese yuan after the parties struggled to find financial institutions that would facilitate a transaction.\n\nPDVSA may be hesitant to sell its cryptocurrencies on the open market because it would require the company to register with an exchange and subject itself to due diligence. Instead, it wants the central bank, which officials at the oil company believe is less exposed to potential blocks, to use the crypto to pay entities PDVSA owes money to.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum use decentralized, online ledgers known as blockchain to verify and record transactions. In some cases that allows for relatively anonymous transfers without the need for a middleman. Few banks touch digital tokens because of the know-your-client and money laundering issues that arise and cause compliance problems.\n\nCryptocurrencies have staged a comeback this year following 2018\u2019s rout, thanks to expectations of greater institutional adoption and Facebook Inc.\u2019s plan to launch a coin, but remain quite volatile. While Bitcoin has plummeted almost 20% in the past four days, it\u2019s still up more than 130% this year.\n\nIn order to shield itself from the effects of further sanctions, Venezuela\u2019s government has also been considering the possibility of switching to a Russian-operated international payments messaging system as an alternative to the SWIFT system that most financial institutions use.\n\n--With assistance from Ben Bartenstein, Fabiola Zerpa and Olga Kharif.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Alex Vasquez in Caracas Office at avasquez45@bloomberg.net;Patricia Laya in Caracas at playa2@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Daniel Cancel at dcancel@bloomberg.net, ;David Papadopoulos at papadopoulos@bloomberg.net, Brendan Walsh, Dave Liedtka\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Venezuela\u2019s central bank is running internal tests to determine whether it can hold cryptocurrencies in its coffers, according to four people with direct knowledge of the matter.The efforts come at the behest of state-run Petroleos de Venezuela SA, which is seeking to send Bitcoin and", "authors": ["Alex Vasquez", "Patricia Laya"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/SvMuNO78wwCheo272G0Rqw--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_technology_68/c4ce9e11f1e3d464a7cad1f6eeb35513", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
