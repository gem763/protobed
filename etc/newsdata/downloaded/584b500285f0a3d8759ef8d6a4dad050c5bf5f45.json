A recent Gallup poll found that 58 percent of Democrats prioritize vanquishing Trump when making their primary decisions; only 39 percent say issues matter most.

Polls show him to be the most competitive Democrat versus Trump. As Biden\u2019s wife, Jill, recently told primary voters: \u201cI know that not all of you are committed to my husband. . .but I want you to think about your candidate, his or her electability, and who\u2019s going to win this race.\u201d Forty-nine percent of Democrats say Biden has the best chance to defeat Trump; just 12 percent and 6 percent respectively give the nod to Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersLuther Campbell changes his tune on Kamala Harris Sanders spokeswoman says forthcoming immigration plan shaped by DACA recipients Bernie spokeswoman previews Bernie's immigration plan MORE and Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Ann WarrenLuther Campbell changes his tune on Kamala Harris The Hill's Morning Report - US coastline readies for Hurricane Dorian to make landfall Democrats to duke it out for top climate candidate title MORE\n\nAlthough Democrats prioritize winning, it may matter more to Republicans who beats Trump and what that would mean. The Democratic race is quickly becoming a three-person contest among Biden, Warren, and Sanders. Others may emerge, but the passage of time makes this extremely unlikely. The three contenders have different strengths. Biden stresses electability; Warren and Sanders say the next president should pursue major structural changes.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThese messages resonate with different audiences. Warren and Sanders have significant leads among young voters and those who label themselves either very liberal or liberal. Biden has large advantages among voters aged sixty-five and older and among African-Americans.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s profound political weakness makes the 2020 Democratic nomination especially valuable. Today, only 29 percent say they will definitely vote to reelect Trump; 41 percent definitely will not do so.\n\nWho becomes president matters. As Alexander Hamilton once said, \u201cEvery vital question of state will be merged into the question, \u2018Who will be the next President?\u2019\u201d\n\nFor Republicans, Hamilton\u2019s query has particular relevance. If it\u2019s a President Warren or a President Sanders, GOP opposition will quickly coalesce. Trump has been quick to brand both as socialists, saying: \u201cHere in the United States, we are alarmed by the new calls to adopt socialism in our country.\u201d\n\nMoreover, he has trademarked Representatives Alexander Ocasio-Cortez (D-Mass.) , Ayanna Pressley Ayanna PressleyTrump lashes out at the media, Democrats in Labor Day tweets Before we destroy their future, let's give them the right to vote Only a President Biden would rid us of the Trump era MORE (D-N.Y.)

That means they are endorsing Socialism, hate of Israel, and the USA! Not good for Democrats!\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNational surveys show a relatively close race. Biden beats Trump by 7 points; Sanders, 5; and Warren and Trump are tied. But an inside look at the polling shows Sanders and Warren doing less well than Biden among independents, Midwesterners and non-college educated voters. Sanders beats Trump by 8 points among independents; Midwesterners, +2 points; and noncollege educated, +1 point. Warren does worse: independents, +1 point; Midwesterners, -3 points; noncollege educated, -8 points. Biden fares far better: independents, +8-points; Midwesterners, +5 points; and noncollege educated, + 3-points.\n\nEach of these constituencies was crucial to Trump\u2019s 2016 win. He beat Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonThe Hill's Morning Report - US coastline readies for Hurricane Dorian to make landfall Swing-seat Democrats oppose impeachment, handing Pelosi leverage Labor Day jitters on both sides of America's political divide MORE by 5 points among noncollege educated voters; 4 points among independents; and won the crucial Midwestern states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio and Iowa.\n\nThe smaller Warren and Sanders margins among these crucial voters point to a razor close finish. Such a result would cause Republicans to see it as a rejection of Trump, not the party\u2019s conservative policies. Unlike 2012, there would be no intraparty reflection. Instead, Republicans would denounce either Sanders or Warren as modern-day socialists.\n\nBut a Biden win \u2013 thanks to those crucial independents, Midwesterners and noncollege voters \u2013 is unlikely to produce immediate Republican opposition. Biden has never been tagged as a socialist, and his moderation is in line with another popular Democrat: Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaLabor Day jitters on both sides of America's political divide Only a President Biden would rid us of the Trump era Comey's classified misconduct and the media's flawed coverage of it MORE. Under a Biden presidency, Republicans would be more likely to undergo a period of self-examination. Moderate Republicans could find their hitherto silent voices, and Donald Trump would fade even more quickly into oblivion.\n\nJohn Kenneth White is a professor of politics at The Catholic University of America.
