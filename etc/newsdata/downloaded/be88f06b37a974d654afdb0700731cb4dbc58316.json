The movie is bringing back everyone from Jesse Pinkman to Mike Ehrmantraut to Skinny Pete and Badger but the whole thing begs one kind of important question\u2014what even happened in the end of Breaking Bad, anyway?\n\nThe series ended all the way back in 2013. We've gotten so many Westeros political history factoids and Succession raps to clutter our minds in the meantime that, uh, it's almost hard to remember what happened in that final season. There was a train robbery, right? And Jesse was trapped in a hole? And then Walt rescued him with a robot machine gun or something?\n\nWell, worry not, everybody! Aaron Paul graciously swung by Jimmy Kimmel to recap all five seasons of Breaking Bad for us before we dive into El Camino\u2014and did it all in under three minutes. Just watch:\n\n\"So there's this chemistry teacher named Walt who gets cancer. His wife, Skyler, is pregnant, and his son, Walt Jr., really loves breakfast,\" Paul begins, before launching into how Walt meets Jesse and starts cooking meth in a Winnebago while Jesse \"says 'Bitch!' a lot.\"\n\nFrom there, Paul covers everything from how Jesse falls \"in love with Jessica Jones\" to \"the scary chicken man\" to Marie's love of the color purple and how they killed that fly that one time, until \"Hank figures out Walt is actually Heisenberg while taking a shit.\" OK, uh, maybe this isn't the most helpful recap, but it's only two-and-a-half minutes long. What did you expect?\n\n\"Spoiler alert,\" Paul continues. \"Hank dies, Mike dies, Lydia dies, my new girlfriend dies, I get kidnapped by neo-Nazis, the Nazis die because Walt kills them with a cool robot gun in the trunk of his car because, again, 'Science, bitch,' then Walt dies while I drive away in an El Camino which is also the name of the movie where this all picks up.\"\n\nGet it? Got it? Good. El Camino hits Netflix Friday, October 11, hopefully with at least a little bit of ghostly Walter White action. Until then, watch Paul's recap above.", "description": "Let Jesse Pinkman catch you up before 'El Camino' hits Netflix on Friday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d9f43da8bf00600098ed2b0/lede/1570722322734-Screen-Shot-2019-10-10-at-114506-AM.png?crop=0.8163xw:0.8725xh;0.1073xw,0.0244xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
