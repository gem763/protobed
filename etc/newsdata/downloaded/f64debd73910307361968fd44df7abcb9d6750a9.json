We anticipate an increase in production in the fourth quarter as we recommence the mining of a higher-grade skarn zone, after infill drilling was carried out during the third quarter. In addition, we plan to increase the production rate from the Aurora zone as more levels are developed. We remain on target to achieve full-year guidance at Bj\u00f6rkdal.\u201d\n\nMr. Duffy continued, \u201cAt Costerfield, we produced 3,103 ounces of saleable gold and 402 tonnes of saleable antimony, as persisting poor ground conditions in the Brunswick lode limited the production rate and lowered the grade due to significant dilution from overbreak. The metallurgy of the ore has also been problematic with significantly lower than planned gold recoveries for the quarter, although antimony recoveries were as planned. With Youle production gradually coming online in the fourth quarter, we anticipate an increase in production compared to the third quarter as there will be less Brunswick ore through the mill. Furthermore, an initial test of approximately 1,600 tonnes of Youle development ore was processed through the mill with early indications showing comparable, if not better than, recoveries seen in the previously mined Cuffley lode.\u201d\n\nMr. Duffy continued, \u201cDespite the positive developments we expect at both sites during the fourth quarter and beyond, the aforementioned production and recovery issues related to the Brunswick deposit will require an update to our 2019 production and unit costs. We have not increased our total operational cost at both sites, although due to the significant drop in production forecast from Costerfield, expected cash costs and all-in costs at the Costerfield mine, and therefore on a consolidated basis, have been increased. Separately, due to lower than expected capital spend for the year, the upper limit of capital guidance at both operating sites have been lowered by US$2 million. Details are shown further below in this press release.\u201d\n\nMr. Duffy continued, \u201cThe poor gold recoveries and lower grades due to dilution in the Brunswick lode are expected to continue to impact Costerfield\u2019s production for the first six months of 2020. However, as the Youle lode ramps up this becomes less relevant and from the third quarter of 2020, it is anticipated that the Youle lode will be the sole feed source for the Costerfield mine.\u201d\n\nMr. Duffy concluded, \u201cMandalay fully anticipates Costerfield to be revitalized with the ramp up at Youle which we expect to generate positive momentum into 2020. At Bj\u00f6rkdal, the Company intends to build on its third quarter production and focus on targeting higher-grade underground skarn material and ramping up Aurora production for increased overall gold production.\u201d\n\nSaleable production for the quarter ended September 30, 2019:\n\nIn the third quarter of 2019, the Company produced a total of 14,983 ounces of gold and 402 tonnes of antimony, representing a total of 16,625 ounces of gold equivalent, versus 13,442 ounces of gold and 505 tonnes of antimony in the third quarter of 2018, representing a total of 16,874 ounces of gold equivalent.\n\n\n\nProduction at Bj\u00f6rkdal was 11,880 ounces of gold in the third quarter of 2019, as compared to 8,504 ounces of gold in the third quarter of 2018.\n\n\n\nProduction at Costerfield was 3,103 ounces of gold and 402 tonnes of antimony in the third quarter of 2019, versus 4,938 ounces gold and 505 tonnes antimony in the third quarter of 2018.\n\nSaleable production for the nine months ended September 30, 2019:\n\nThe Company produced a total of 51,017 ounces gold and 1,348 tonnes antimony, representing a total of 58,065 ounces of gold equivalent production, versus 51,899 ounces gold and 1,613 tonnes of antimony in the corresponding nine months of 2018, representing a total of 62,395 ounces of gold equivalent.\n\n\n\nProduction at Bj\u00f6rkdal was 40,508 ounces gold.\n\n\n\nProduction at Costerfield was 10,509 ounces gold and 1,348 tonnes antimony.\n\nTable 1 \u2013 Third Quarter and Nine Month Saleable Production for 2019 and 2018\n\nMetal Source Three months\n\nended\n\nSeptember 30\n\n2019 Three months\n\nended\n\nSeptember 30\n\n2018 Nine months\n\nended\n\nSeptember 30\n\n2019 Nine months\n\nended\n\nSeptember 30\n\n2018 Gold (oz) Bj\u00f6rkdal 11,880 8,504 40,508 35,237 Costerfield 3,103 4,938 10,509 16,662 Total 14,983 13,442 51,017 51,899 Antimony (t) Costerfield 402 505 1,348 1,613 Average quarterly prices: Gold US$/oz 1,473 1,213 Antimony US$/t 6,015 8,252 Au Eq.(1) (oz) Bj\u00f6rkdal 11,880 8,504 40,508 35,237 Costerfield 4,745 8,370 17,557 27,158 Total 16,625 16,874 58,065 62,395\n\nQuarterly gold equivalent ounces (\u201cAu Eq. oz\u201d) produced is calculated by multiplying the saleable quantities of gold (\u201cAu\u201d), and antimony (\u201cSb\u201d) in the period by the respective average market prices of the commodities in the period, adding the two amounts to get a \u201ctotal contained value based on market price\u201d, and then dividing that total contained value by the average market price of Au in the period. Average Au price in the period is calculated as the average of the daily LME PM fixes in the period, with price on weekend days and holidays taken of the last business day; average Sb price in the period is calculated as the average of the daily average of the high and low Rotterdam warehouse prices for all days in the period, with price on weekend days and holidays taken from the last business day.

In addition to the factors noted above, the revised guidance reflects updated metal prices as there has been a significant decline in the price of antimony, and a significant increase in the price of gold since the initial announcement of the original guidance on January 16, 2019. These changes negatively impact projected consolidated gold equivalent production relative to the original guidance. As a result, the tables below present (i) revised 2019 guidance reflecting assumed metal prices of Au$1,396/oz and Sb$6,682/t, (ii) 2019 guidance as originally presented (based on the metal prices of Au$1,200/oz and Sb$8,200/t), and (iii) the original 2019 guidance adjusted to reflect assumed metal prices of Au$1,396/oz and Sb$6,682/t.\n\nTable 3 \u2013 Revised 2019 Full-Year Guidance\n\n2019E Bj\u00f6rkdal Gold produced (oz) 50,000 \u2013 56,000 Cash cost(1) per oz gold produced $800 \u2013 $950 All-in cost(1) per oz gold produced $1,030 \u2013 $1,180 Capital expenditures $18M \u2013 $20M Costerfield Gold produced (oz) 13,000 \u2013 17,000 Antimony produced (t) 2,000 \u2013 2,300 Gold equivalent(2) (oz) 23,000 \u2013 28,000 Cash cost(1) per oz gold eq. produced $1,300 \u2013 $1,450 All-in cost(1) per oz gold eq. produced $1,700 \u2013 $1,850 Capital expenditures $21M \u2013 $23M Consolidated Gold equivalent(2) produced (oz) 72,000 \u2013 84,000 Average cash cost(3) per oz gold eq. $975 \u2013 $1,125 Average all-in cost(3) per oz gold eq. $1,325 \u2013 $1,500 Capital expenditures $39M \u2013 $43M\n\nCash cost and all-in cost are non-IFRS measures.
