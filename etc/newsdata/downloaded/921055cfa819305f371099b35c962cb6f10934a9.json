I\u2019ve been to two World Cups and been lucky enough to win two.\u201d\n\nFranks is one of a host of big names to be missing the first Rugby World Cup in Asia.\n\nEngland discarded former captains Dylan Hartley and Chris Robshaw. Robshaw led England at the 2015 World Cup, and has grudgingly accepted over the past year his international career is over. Hartley hasn\u2019t given up though. He was dropped for that 2015 tournament but became new coach Eddie Jones\u2019 right hand man until the end of last year when he injured his knee. He hasn\u2019t played since, being stuck on 97 test caps.\n\n\u201cWhen the World Cup squad was announced, it was almost like I\u2019d died, friends getting in touch and seeing if I was OK,\u201d he says. \u201cFor four years we have talked about winning the World Cup with Eddie, and I have led that group, been a part of that journey, so to fall at the final hurdle \u2026 I wake up most nights thinking about it. It doesn\u2019t sit well with me, but I have come to terms with it.\u201d\n\nScrumhalf Danny Care (84 caps), fullback Mike Brown (72 caps), and British Lions center Ben Te\u2019o (20 caps) were also surplus to requirements for England. Brown and Te\u2019o had an off-field dustup in camp, and Brown didn\u2019t know if that affected their non-selections.\n\nFrance also discarded experienced backs, including Morgan Parra (71 caps), Mathieu Bastareaud (54 caps), Teddy Thomas (16 caps), and Geoffrey Doumayrou (13 caps).\n\nParra, Bastareaud, and Doumayrou were involved as recently as the Six Nations.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not bitter at all,\u201d Parra says. \u201cI believe in destiny enormously.\u201d\n\nLike Parra, Bastareaud played in the last two World Cups. He reacted to his omission by retiring from test rugby and switching from center to No. 8.\n\nAt least there was consolation for hooker Tatafu Polota-Nau after missing out on a third World Cup. Australia gave him a 90th and farewell test against Samoa this month.\n\n\u201cI feel very fortunate,\u201d Polota-Nau says.\n\nSome players made themselves unavailable for personal reasons, such as New Zealand flanker Liam Squire and Scotland lock Richie Gray, a British Lion and veteran of two World Cups. Australia coach Michael Cheika would have liked the option to pick 2.04-meter (6-foot-8) lock Will Skelton for another World Cup. To secure selection Skelton needed to sign to play Super Rugby next year, but he declined and instead extended his contract at English champion Saracens.\n\nThe depth of Ireland\u2019s squad was evident by coach Joe Schmidt\u2019s decision to leave at home five of the 23 who earned the first home win over the All Blacks last November.\n\nLock Devin Toner and scrumhalf Kieran Marmion were starters, and Jack McGrath, Andrew Porter, and Jordi Murphy were backups in that milestone match.\n\nToner\u2019s omission was met with the most disbelief. He even received sympathy from World Rugby vice chairman Agustin Pichot.\n\nInjuries made Schmidt\u2019s decision easier to leave out flanker Sean O\u2019Brien and Dan Leavy, much like injuries in the final weeks ruled out Wales stars Taulupe Faletau and Gareth Anscombe. Props Rob Evans and Samson Lee also had injury issues.\n\nArgentina omitte No. 8 Facundo Isa, prop Ramiro Herrera, and wings Santiago Cordero and Juan Imhoff, who all featured at the last World Cup. Isa, Herrera, and Cordero were involved in the recent Rugby Championship. But the Pumas prioritized home-based players, and only three overseas players made it.\n\n\u201cOf course, it hurts, but nothing is given,\u201d Imhoff says. \u201cI did not expect to be selected merely on my name. I did not meet the expectations of the coach.\u201d\n\nInjury robbed two who would have appeared in a fifth World Cup. Only Samoa wing Brian Lima and Italy flanker Mauro Bergamasco have been to five, and Italy captain Sergio Parisse will join them on Sunday.\n\nBut Georgia fullback Merab Kvirikashvili and Uruguay lock Rodrigo Capo Ortega hoped to join them. The 35-year-old Kvirikashvili played in all four of Georgia\u2019s World Cup wins, but injuries prevented him from appearing this year.\n\nCapo Ortega, Uruguay\u2019s greatest player, appeared in the 2003 World Cup then concentrated on his club career at Castres. His only appearances for Uruguay in this decade were to help the Teros win World Cup qualifiers in 2014 and 2018. A herniated disc has ruled him out.\n\nInjury also cost Ray Barkwill. The starting hooker suffered nerve damage while helping Canada qualify last November in France, and retired reluctantly in April.\n\nAkihito Yamada was on the wing the day Japan shocked the Springboks in 2015, and hoped to appear in his home World Cup. But Yamada hasn\u2019t played for Japan since last November. He\u2019s told the selectors that though he\u2019s going to Lyon on a short-term deal, he\u2019s available if there are injuries.\n\nHe\u2019s hopeful for a phone call.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The phone call was short. \"I don't have long conversations with a lot of people,\" Owen Franks says with a rueful laugh.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Foster Niumata"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
