Pro-Trump groups staged protests outside the freshman Democrat\u2019s office and at some of his public events \u2014 including a town hall here in October \u2014 to rally local support in New York\u2019s 22nd Congressional District.\n\nMany of those who have picketed, including Mount Vernon, N.Y. resident Gilda Ward, have focused squarely on Democrats\u2019 impeachment push. And it doesn\u2019t matter to them that Brindisi, one of the most vulnerable freshmen, remains one of seven holdouts in his caucus who oppose the impeachment inquiry.\n\nIf he did come out in favor, Ward predicts, \u201cIt would be a death knell.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am totally opposed to any kind of impeachment,\u201d she said in an interview after attending a Brindisi town hall. \u201cIt really bothers me, and it bothers many of us who voted for Trump.\u201d\n\nTenney \u2014 an enthusiastic Trump supporter who appeared alongside the president and his family at campaign events in 2018 \u2014 plans to once again embrace the president. The former congresswoman said that since announcing her campaign in late September, she\u2019s gotten calls from Republican friends who say Trump is happy she\u2019s running again.\n\nBrindisi\u2019s campaign is eager to zero in on his House opponent and avoid the presidential politics.\n\n\u201cThis district has long turned the page on Claudia Tenney, who delivered for late night TV more than she ever did our district,\u201d said Luke Jackson, a Brindisi campaign spokesperson.\n\nRepublicans are betting that if Trump remains popular with the GOP base, he could significantly ramp up turnout \u2014 clawing back seats that were lost in the 2018 wipeout.\n\nThat includes the district where Tenney and Brindisi will battle it out next year. Trump won nearly 160,000 votes in the district in 2016. Turnout plummeted two years later when Tenney got less than 124,000 votes.\n\nGOP campaign operatives are looking at the same math for Trump-backed districts across the country that are now held by Democrats.\n\nYoung said in an interview he is working to find Trump voters who stayed home in 2018 through a \u201cdata deep dive\u201d as he plans his rematch against Axne. He added that he senses an energy from voters in his Des Moines-based district that are frustrated by Democrats\u2019 \u201cobsession with trying to remove the president.\u201d\n\nTrump won nearly 193,000 votes in Iowa's 3rd District in 2016. Young won just under 168,000 when he lost to Axne by 2 points two years later. Activists on both sides are motivated, Young said, but he argued Democrats neared their high-water mark in 2018. Axne came close to matching Hillary Clinton's 2016 vote total but Young won far fewer votes than Trump.\n\n\u201cIn November 2018, the Democrats had high voter turnout, almost presidential levels,\u201d Young said. \u201cI think to some extent they may have peaked or are getting close to peaking, but Republicans have so much more room to grow.\u201d\n\nIn the midterms, dozens of Democratic candidates outperformed Clinton in their districts. But it\u2019s not clear if they achieved those margins because Trump voters stayed home. Those candidates likely owe their victories in part to two other factors: their ability to persuade Trump voters to back a Democrat for Congress as well as their skill at turning out Democratic voters who typically sit out the midterms.\n\nRob Simms, a top strategist for Handel, who is seeking a rematch with McBath in suburban Atlanta, blames her loss on high Democratic turnout caused by Democrat Stacey Abram's narrow loss for governor.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats, really the Abrams campaign, did a tremendous job at bringing out voters who would not typically vote in an off year elections,\u201d said Simms, a former executive director of the National Republican Congressional Committee. Georgia will be more of a battleground in 2020, he said, and Republicans will be ready.\n\nBut particularly in suburban districts with highly-educated voters like Georgia's 6th, the momentum is moving away from the GOP and there may be a large chunk of persuadable voters up for grabs. Mitt Romney won the seat by 24 points in 2012 but Trump carried it by 1 point.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

The Georgia Democrat outraised Handel nearly 2 to 1 in the last quarter, and has a fundraising war chest of $1.3 million, compared to Handel\u2019s roughly $630,000. Handel also has to clear a GOP primary before she can challenge McBath again.\n\nMeanwhile, few ousted GOP lawmakers seem eager to try again in districts that Hillary Clinton carried in 2016. (Former California Republican David Valadao is a rare exception, as he tries to reclaim his Central Valley-based district that Trump lost by 15 points.)\n\nTwo Republicans who once represented suburban districts are running again in different, more GOP-friendly spots, an indication that they still view the climate as unfavorable in their old seats.\n\nRepublican Pete Sessions who lost a Dallas-area district is now running 100 miles south in Waco. And Darrell Issa, who retired in 2018 from a Clinton-won seat, is running in a neighboring San Diego district held by embattled GOP Rep. Duncan Hunter.\n\nStill, Republican strategists see a path back to the House majority through the 31 Democratic-held seats that Trump won in 2016.\n\n\u201cThe dynamics in \u201920 are going to be much different,\u201d Simms said of GOP chances in suburban Georgia. \u201cWe have an incumbent president. We have an incumbent senator who\u2019s going to be on top of the ticket. Their campaigns are already organized and functioning and working in the state today.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/83/52/59274ddf4e8cb52fc28a7c5c7be7/191025-tenney-trump-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
