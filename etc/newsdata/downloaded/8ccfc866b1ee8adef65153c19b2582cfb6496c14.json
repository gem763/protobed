Neumann will become a \u201cboard observer,\u201d WeWork said, and SoftBank Chief Operating Officer Marcelo Claure will become WeWork\u2019s executive chairman.\n\nSoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son said that he still believes WeWork is \u201cat the forefront\u201d of a revolution in the way people work. \u201cSoftBank has decided to double down on the company by providing a significant capital infusion and operational support. We remain committed to WeWork, its employees, its member customers and landlords,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nWeWork has been scrambling for cash since its attempt to enter the stock market floundered last month, a stunning fall from grace for a company that has until recently been considered one of the most highly valued start-ups in the U.S.\n\nThe deal throws WeWork a lifeline as it attempts to turn around a money-losing business model that had repelled potential Wall Street investors. But it comes at a steep cost for SoftBank, which already owns one-third of WeWork and has sunk $10 billion into the company.\n\nSoftBank\u2019s takeover values WeWork at $8 billion, a fraction of the $47 billion valuation SoftBank had assigned the company in its last round of financing in January.\n\nThe contours of the deal mean SoftBank now has more money invested in WeWork than the company is worth.\n\n\u201cThis is where the math gets confusing because they\u2019ve put in more money than the valuation of the company,\u201d said Larry Perkins, founder and CEO of SierraConstellation Partners, a management advisory firm that specializes in helping companies navigate difficult turnarounds. \u201cThat would be the question going forward: Is this good money after bad money or a preservation of their investment?\u201d\n\nSoftBank will pay Neumann $1 billion for his shares in the company and extend him $500 million in credit to help him repay a loan from J.P. Morgan., the Journal reported. SoftBank also will pay Neumann a $185 million consulting fee.\n\nNeumann stepped down as CEO under pressure last month, but he retained a controlling share of the company, making his approval necessary for any deal. He will step down from WeWork\u2019s board of directors but retain a small stake in the company.\n\n\u201cHe gets a golden helicopter that lets him get out of this, and that is just remarkable,\u201d Perkins said.\n\nThe SoftBank deal eases WeWork\u2019s immediate cash crunch, but the company faces a long road ahead to address its deeper challenges, namely finding ways to curtail its staggering spending.\n\nWeWork mostly makes money by leasing buildings and subdividing them into office space that it sublets on a short-term, flexible basis.\n\nSince the failed IPO, WeWork has taken steps to shore up that core business and move away from the meandering direction it had taken under Neumann.\n\nNeuman, who grew up partly in a kibbutz, had dazzled private investors with his vision of creating workspaces that foster communality and cater to the overall well-being of its members. The company launched side businesses including a fitness company called \u201cRise by We\u201d and the co-living rental company \u201cWeLive.\u201d\n\nThose projects now appear on the chopping block. Last week, WeWork announced it would close WeGrow, its newly launched Manhattan elementary school. Days later, the company scrapped a deal with a top Seattle real estate firm for a building that would combine its WeWork offices spaces with its WeLive communal apartment rentals.\n\nWeWork, which has locations in 111 cities around the world, is also slowing its expansion plans. Last week, the company canceled plans to lease space in U.S. Steel Tower, Pittsburgh\u2019s tallest building.\n\nBut the company could face an uphill battle to curb costs related its future lease obligations, which amounted to $47.2 billion as of June 30. Most of its leases don\u2019t have provisions to let the company out of them early, and the average initial term of its U.S. leases is 15 years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge liability. There\u2019s a very blunt option called bankruptcy that I\u2019m sure everyone wants to avoid. It would be a last resort, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s an option that is on the table if they can\u2019t get out of leases peacefully,\u201d Perkins said.\n\nWeWork had faced few palatable options since pulling out of the IPO, which the company had been counting on to raise $9 billion in stock and related debt financing.\n\nThe company decided to accept SoftBank\u2019s over a high-risk debt-financing proposal from J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, +1.00% , which had been the lead underwriter of the failed IPO.\n\nWeWork was sitting on $2.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of June, but it burned through nearly $199 million in the first six months of the year just operating its business.\n\nOn top of that, WeWork spent $2.36 billion on new leases and other investments, an amount that had been offset by $3.43 billion raised though venture capital and high-yield debt. The person familiar with the negotiations said WeWork had been on track to run out of cash by the end of November without the new financing.\n\nMarketWatch contributed to this report.", "description": "WeWork said late Tuesday it has accepted a financial rescue package that hands control of the company to its top investor and pushes aside co-founder Adam...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR807_neuman_ZG_20190922172931.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
