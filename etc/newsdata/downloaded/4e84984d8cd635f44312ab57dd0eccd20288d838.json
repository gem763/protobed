Britain\u2019s biggest shops are unfairly keeping millions of pounds in home delivery charges when customers return unwanted items\n\nAccording to the Consumer Contracts Regulations, introduced in 2014, customers who return items should get a refund for the price of the goods and the standard postage costs they paid for home delivery.\n\nLawyers say the original delivery fee should be handed back automatically as part of any refund if the items are returned within a set period. Yet our research found many shops hold on to the cash - typically around \u00a33 per delivery - unless you ask for it.\n\nOften your rights are buried in the smallprint on retailers\u2019 websites. Then customers are made to jump through hoops to get the money they\u2019re owed, such as filling in extra forms or making phone calls.\n\nAccording to figures from retail experts Mintel, around one in five people will do some Christmas shopping online this year. It\u2019s good news for retailers as online shopping is cheaper for them, cutting the cost of staffing, lighting and heating High Street stores.\n\nBut four in ten items of clothing bought online are now sent back, according to accountancy firm KPMG, and one in ten electrical items. This is partly due to a new trend of ordering several items to try - then returning ones you don\u2019t want.\n\nMany shoppers will also be returning planned gifts after having second thoughts. For big shops, many of which offer free returns, that means a lot of time and money wasted on packaging and posting.\n\nHOW TO CLAIM YOUR CASH Check if the retailer automatically refunds delivery costs.\n\nIf it does, you just need to send your items back within 14 days.\n\nIf it doesn\u2019t, it may have a form online you can fill in. You may need to call customer service for one. If the shop refuses, write to complain, quoting the Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013.\n\nAs a last resort, take your complaint to Trading Standards. Call Citizens Advice for guidance on 03454 04 05 06.\n\nThe press office for online clothes shop Asos, which made \u00a31.4 billion in sales in the past financial year, says it does refund its \u00a33 postage charge if a shopper asks. But when Money Mail contacted its customer services, an email came back saying the fees were a \u2018non-refundable cost\u2019 and made no mention of the law.\n\nBoohoo, which took revenues of \u00a3127 million in the six months to August, says customers must ask for the \u00a33.99 standard delivery fee.\n\nLingerie store Bravissimo\u2019s says customers only get back the \u00a33.95 for standard postage if they call or email first.\n\nTopshop, owned by Sir Philip Green\u2019s Arcadia Group, does not automatically refund original postage costs under its 14-day postal returns policy.\n\nWhen you send something back, Topshop pays the return postage costs. But it does not, as standard, return the \u00a34 home delivery fee it charged when you originally bought the item.\n\nCustomers can demand this \u00a34 back if they fill in a form. However, Topshop told Money Mail that if you do this, it will no longer cover the cost of sending the goods back. This means you\u2019re unlikely to save money overall.\n\nHouse of Fraser\u2019s terms and conditions stated it will refund customers\u2019 postage in vouchers \u2014 but the department store said this was incorrect and that customers would get a full refund in the same way they paid. M&S and John Lewis say they refund postage costs without quibble.\n\nAll the retailers declined to reveal what proportion of shoppers who return items get their original delivery fees back.\n\nRunning returns: Four in ten items of clothing bought online are now sent back, according to accountancy firm KPMG, and one in ten electrical items\n\nExperts say most shoppers fail to claim because they are unaware of their rights or do not have time. In the UK, some 1.38 billion items were returned last year, says consultancy Clear Returns.\n\nIt means shops could be sitting on \u00a34.1 billion of postage fees. Carys Murphy, solicitor at law firm Slater and Gordon, says: \u2018The onus should be on online retailers to refund the original delivery charge once they are in receipt of the returned goods.\n\n\u2018Forcing a customer to fill in a separate form or make a call in order to get payment is not reflected in the regulations or in government guidance. Quite frankly, this appears to be an attempt by online retailers to justify avoiding paying consumers money they are entitled to.\u2019\n\nThe Consumer Contracts Regulations 2014 state that if you return items bought over the phone or internet within 14 days of receiving them, you should receive a full refund. There does not have to be anything wrong with the goods: it\u2019s enough simply to have changed your mind.\n\nThe rules state that as well as a refund for the item, customers should get back their original, standard delivery costs if they return the whole order at once.\n\nExperts say most shoppers fail to claim because they are unaware of their rights or do not have time\n\nShops are not obliged to refund the extra you might have paid for one-day or express delivery.\n\nSteph Barnett, 51, from St Albans, has claimed back around \u00a3100 over the past year by battling some of Britain\u2019s biggest online retailers for refunds of her postage fees. She has successfully fought Boohoo, Asos, Very.co.uk and Pretty Little Thing for refunds ranging from \u00a31 to \u00a33.95.\n\nThe telesales worker says: \u2018Shops must be sitting on millions and millions of pounds of customers\u2019 cash. They are already saving so much money by encouraging us to shop online. Online shopping should be a pleasurable experience, not fighting for your money back.\u2019\n\nThe Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, which oversees the rules, says: \u2018The Consumer Contracts Regulations apply regardless of whether or not a consumer has filled in a form.\n\n\u2018If businesses fail to comply with the rules, the consumer can claim a breach of the contract, and trading standards can apply for a court order requiring compliance.\u2019 A Topshop spokesman says: \u2018As Topshop offers free delivery on orders over \u00a350, some three-quarters of customers do not pay for the original delivery.\u2019\n\nAn Asos spokesman says: \u2018The overwhelming majority of Asos orders have free delivery.\n\n\u2018But we are also happy, of course, to refund the original cost of delivery if applicable.\u2019\n\nA Boohoo spokesman says: \u2018Customer satisfaction is our utmost priority and Boohoo regrets that the customer had to ask for the refund.\u2019\n\nA Very.co.uk spokesman said it was fully compliant with the rules.
