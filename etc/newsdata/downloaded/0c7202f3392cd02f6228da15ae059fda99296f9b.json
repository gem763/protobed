I think it\u2019s like the holy grail of the entertainment industry,\u2019 Shakira told Zane Lowe on Apple Music\u2019s Beats 1.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a sports event, but it has a huge relevance for us artists, and I think it\u2019s going to be fantastic. And I\u2019m going to be celebrating my birthday with 100 million people. A small party.
