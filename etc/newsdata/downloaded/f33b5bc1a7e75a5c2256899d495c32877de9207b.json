Many saw the extradition bill as a glaring example of the erosion of civil liberties and rights promised under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s government promised this past week to formally withdraw the bill, but that failed to appease the demonstrators, who have widened their demands to include calls for direct elections for the city\u2019s leaders and an independent probe into alleged police brutality against protesters.\n\nThe unrest has become the biggest challenge to Beijing\u2019s rule since Hong Kong\u2019s return from Britain. Beijing and the entirely state-controlled media have portrayed the protests as an effort by criminals to split the territory from China, backed by hostile foreigners.\n\nProtesters on Sunday urged Washington to pass a bill, known as the Hong Kong Democratic and Human Rights Act, to support their cause. The bill proposes sanctions against Hong Kong and Chinese officials found to suppress democracy and human rights in the city, and could also affect Hong Kong\u2019s preferential trade status with the U.S.\n\nA group of protesters sang \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d before handing over an appeal letter to a U.S. Consulate official.\n\nJust before the rally ended, violence erupted after riot police detained several people and cleared a crowd from the nearby Central subway station. Angry protesters smashed glass windows, sprayed graffiti and started a fire at one at the station\u2019s exits.\n\nThe government said protesters also set street fires and blocked traffic at some thoroughfares. In the type of cat-and-mouse battle that has characterized the summer-long protests, riot police pursued groups of protesters down streets, but they kept regrouping.\n\nPolice fired multiple rounds of tear gas in the Causeway Bay shopping area after protesters heckled them and refused to leave. They also searched dozens of young people on the street and inside subway stations.\n\nAt the Mong Kok police station, clashes took place for a third straight night. Police fired projectiles at an angry crowd that was shining laser beams, and several people were detained.\n\nThe U.S. State Department said in a travel advisory Friday that Beijing has undertaken a propaganda campaign \u201cfalsely accusing the United States of fomenting unrest in Hong Kong.\u201d It said U.S. citizens and embassy staff were targeted and urged them to exercise increased caution.\n\nSome American legislators are pressing Trump to take a tougher stand on Hong Kong. But the president has suggested that it\u2019s a matter for China to handle, though he also has said that no violence should be used. Political analysts suggest that Trump\u2019s response has been muted because he doesn\u2019t want to disrupt talks with China over their tariff war.\n\nU.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement Wednesday that Hong Kong residents deserve real autonomy and freedom from fear. She urged an end to police violence against protesters and said Congress looks forward to \u201cswiftly advancing\u201d the Hong Kong bill.\n\nThe protests are an embarrassment to China\u2019s ruling Communist Party ahead of the Oct. 1 celebration of its 70th anniversary in power.\n\nSeparately, well-known Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong said in a statement through his lawyer that he was detained at the city\u2019s airport early Friday for breaching bail conditions. Wong, a leader of Hong Kong\u2019s 2014 pro-democracy protest movement, was among several people detained last month and was charged with inciting people to join a protest in June.\n\nWong had just returned from Taiwan, where he gave speeches on Hong Kong\u2019s protests, and is due to visit Germany and the U.S. He said a court had approved his overseas trips.\n\nHe described his detention as a procedural hiccup and said he expected to be released Monday. His prosecution comes less than two months after his release from prison for a two-month sentence related to the 2014 protests.", "description": "Thousands of demonstrators in Hong Kong urged President Donald Trump to \u201cliberate\u201d the semiautonomous Chinese territory during a peaceful march to the U.S....", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ887_hkprot_ZG_20190908170309.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
