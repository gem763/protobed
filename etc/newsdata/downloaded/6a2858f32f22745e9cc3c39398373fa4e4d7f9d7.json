Morrison, who has positioned himself as a ridgy-didge mate to Trump, said Australia would do whatever it could to get to the (barrel) bottom of the situation.\n\nCiting White House sources, CNN now reports Trump has blamed Turnbull and former UK Prime Minister Theresa May for not acting to tamp down Downer\u2019s complaint in the first place:\n\nNot only did he view the two new leaders as more cooperative to his position, he blamed both of their predecessors \u2014 Theresa May and Malcolm Turnbull \u2014 as partly responsible for the entire investigation, believing that under their leadership it was allowed to sprout, people familiar with his thinking said.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first sign of conflict between Trump and Turnbull \u2013 their first phone conversation did not go well \u2013 but it\u2019s the first suggestion that Trump thought Turnbull was actively working against him.\n\nFun times over in Washington D.C., for sure.
