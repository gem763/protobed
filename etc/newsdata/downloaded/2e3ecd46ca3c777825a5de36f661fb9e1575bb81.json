My time has come to an end. I\u00b4m excited for my next chapter in life whatever that may be.\"\n\nBurgess was lured to the Rabbitohs by co-owner and Hollywood actor Russell Crowe in 2009 and helped the team break their 43-year NRL championship drought in 2014.\n\nHis dominant performance in the season-ending Grand Final, in which he played with a broken cheekbone and eye socket, earned him the Clive Churchill medal as the championship match's best player.\n\nHaving started out in the Super League for Bradford Bulls, Burgess brought his brothers Tom, George and Luke along for his Australian adventure and in 2013 all four represented the Rabbitohs in the same team.\n\nBurgess made the switch to rugby union to represent England at the 2015 World Cup and earned five caps for Stuart Lancaster's side.\n\nHis selection was controversial, however, drawing criticism from pundits after England were knocked out of the pool phase of their home World Cup.\n\nHe returned to rugby league and the Rabbitohs for the 2016 NRL season where he remained a favourite.\n\n\"His leadership and capabilities on the field match the man he is off it,\" said Rabbitohs coach Wayne Bennett.\n\n\"I thought it was a real blow to the game when he left to play rugby union but I\u00b4m glad he saw the light and came back.\n\n\"I\u00b4m glad to have played a small role in his career and I feel blessed that he has been part of mine. I know he has made the right decision.\"\n\n(Reporting by Ian Ransom; Editing by Peter Rutherford)", "description": "MELBOURNE, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Dual code international Sam Burgess has retired from Australia's National Rugby League due to complications with a chronic...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
