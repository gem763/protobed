Inventories at those farms reached 44.4551 million animals in September, up 0.6% from the previous month, while September sow herds climbed 3.7% from August to 6.1047 million head.\n\nChina had pig inventories of 428 million animals by end of 2018, according to official data.\n\nMajor producing provinces including Henan, Shandong, and Liaoning also saw a considerable pick-up in pig inventories in September compared with the previous month, Yang added.\n\nProduction and sales of pig feed have also rebounded strongly, Yang added, with output of hog feed up 10% in September from the previous month.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Hallie Gu and Shivani Singh; Editing by Kenneth Maxwell)", "description": "China's hog production capacity should bottom out before the end of 2019 after outbreaks of African swine fever decimated the world's biggest pig herd, an official said on Thursday, forecasting a return to usual pig numbers in 2020.
