No matter what, life never stops for anyone. There is always another sunrise and sunset. In this process, things that we leave behind are often forgotten. What we don't realise is how important they were to us. It could a part of your personality or a tangible object that meant a lot to you but as time passed, you got rid of it and never looked back. So we made people look back and asked them things they wish they had kept they got rid of years ago.\n\n1. My love for cooking\n\n\"I, in my initial years of career, had an immense love for cooking and used to cook and experiment a lot. Not only it used to gratify my soul but it also polished my cooking skills. However, I had to get rid of it because my work life gave me no time to do the same.\"\n\nUnsplash\n\nDon't Miss 420 SHARES 3.3 K SHARES 222 SHARES 205 SHARES\n\n2. The soft me\n\n\"One of the first things I realised as soon as I gained consciousness of this world was that I am too soft and people are not appreciative of the same. You'll be pulled down for being too nice. So I had to turn into a diplomat.\"\n\nUnsplash\n\n3. A lot of my clothes\n\n\"Why would you throw clothes you really love wearing? I only threw them because I thought they are out of fashion but fashion comes back people.\"\n\nUnsplash\n\n4. My first love\n\n\"As naive as I was back then, I didn't realise I had the best man in my life. However, due to external influences, I got rid of him and never got a man like him ever.\"\n\nUnsplash\n\n5. My job\n\n\"A job I was actually happy in but left in order to earn more money. Thirst for money makes you do a lot of shit.\"\n\nUnsplash\n\n6. My home in search of a job.\n\n\"I always dreamed of living away from home and smelling real freedom. But now that I've been away from home for the past 10 years, I know it's not as fancy as I thought it'd be. I'd do anything go back home now.\"\n\nUnsplash\n\n7. My high school friends\n\n\"Back in my school days I thought they spread a rumour about me which offended me.\"\n\nUnsplash\n\n8. My love for music\n\n\"Things like music that are dear to you should never be ridden of. Just because my parents never supported my career in music, I eventually stopped listening to it.\"\n\nUnsplash\n\n9. Expectations\n\n\"My mom once politely told me that expectations will only kill you but she never told me that there is no substitute to it. We must keep expectations from some people as it helps in strengthening the bond.\"\n\nUnsplash\n\n10. Old messages\n\n\"People only who know how important conversations are would relate to it.\"\n\nUnsplash\n\n11. My long hair\n\n\"I miss them. They were just not easy to handle so I thought chopping them off would be the best.\"\n\nUnsplash\n\n12. Trusting people easily\n\n\"The ability to trust that initial heartbreaks took away from me. I wish love would only come to you when you know what it is.\"\n\nUnsplash", "description": "There is no one way of living a fulfilling life considering we all have different journeys and face different sets of struggles.
