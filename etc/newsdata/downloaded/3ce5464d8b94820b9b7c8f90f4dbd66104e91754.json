How unsanitary is the Yarra these days?,' questioned one person.\n\n'My partner used to work on the Yarra. He saw a few seals that had travelled upstream and they all had eye damage/were blind and had to be put down,' another answered.\n\n'I'm really hoping the Yarra is cleaner now and life is good for this guy.'\n\nAnother wrote: 'Poor thing. Not gonna survive unless it gets a little crazy.'\n\nAs one seagull flies close to the water's surface, a large seal launches out of the water and gobbles the bird up\n\nThe seal thrashes around in the water as it eats the seagull while its feathered friends quickly fly away\n\nSome people claimed the seal was Salvatore, a 200kg-plus fur seal who made the Yarra River his home in 2017.\n\nHe was initially discovered in 2014 after he was seen eating a massive fish in South Yarra.\n\nMelbourne's Zoo's Marine Response Unit was called a few months later after they found him wasting away under a pier.\n\nHe had box tape wrapped around his neck, which had cut deep into his skin, and had to be sedated with a dart gun.\n\nThe box tape was successfully removed from his neck, which left distinctive scars, and he was administered antibiotics and pain relief before being released.\n\n", "description": "A cheeky seal has been caught hunting seagulls flying too close to the surface of Melbourne's Yarra River.", "authors": ["Thomas Duff For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/06/19572734-0-image-a-2_1570770581726.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
