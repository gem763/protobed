But walking outside under the fierce summer sun \u2013 even if it\u2019s to run a quick errand \u2013 can be taxing: We sweat, we get exhausted, we burn and we expose ourselves to dangerous UV rays. In Asian countries, many people have a convenient tool at their disposal: They\u2019ll often use umbrellas to shield them from the sun\u2019s powerful rays.\n\nIn the US, Australia and the UK, even though most people own an umbrella to keep them dry when it\u2019s raining, almost no one uses one for sun protection. Yet at one time, trendsetting American women did use umbrellas for sun protection.\n\nAs a historian of technology, I\u2019m interested in why some technologies are readily accepted by some groups but not by others. Unlike an expensive technology that may be very challenging to learn how to use \u2013 such as a car with a manual transmission \u2013 the umbrella is cheap, readily accessible and easy to use.\n\nSo why did the sun umbrella fall out of favor in the west? And can we \u2013 both women and men \u2013 ever be convinced to carry an umbrella when it\u2019s hot and sunny, not just when it\u2019s wet?\n\nFrom status symbol to tool of the masses\n\nThe umbrella was actually invented to protect people from the sun.\n\nThe origin of the word \u201cparasol\u201d comes from the French \u201cpara,\u201d for \u201cstop,\u201d and \u201csol,\u201d for sun. And \u201cumbrella\u201d originates from the Latin \u201cumbra,\u201d which means \u201cshade\u201d or \u201cshadow.\u201d\n\nThousands of years ago, servants in Mesopotamia, Egypt, China and India wielded large umbrellas to shade rulers from the sun. Umbrellas made for individual use didn\u2019t appear in Europe until the late 17th and early 18th centuries, and they were deployed to ward off both the sun and the rain. Fashionable, wealthy women primarily used them, a reflection of the umbrella\u2019s high cost and the status it denoted.\n\nBy the 1850s, the introduction of folding metal ribs and lighter materials, like silk, reduced the weight and cost of the umbrella, transforming it into an essential component of the wardrobes of middle-class and upper-class women.", "description": "Many of us apply sunscreen when we go to the beach.
