Doing the tango and that.\n\n\u201cIt worries me big-time. And having to have an intense look on my face instead of pulling a stupid grin.\n\n\u201cI like smiling. So I\u2019m not looking forward to the ones where you have to look serious or be manly. That\u2019s not something that comes easily. I\u2019ve never had a smouldering look.\n\nAfter a rocky start, South Shields-born Chris has been improving every week and danced the quickstep with pro partner Karen Hauer, 37, last night.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nAnd last week, he earned praise from judges Craig Revel Horwood, Bruno Tonioli, Shirley Ballas and Motsi Mabuse for his Charleston.\n\nBut Chris \u2013 who is married to Rosie and has three-year-old son Robin \u2013 says he is just enjoying the ride as he does not expect to be in the competition for much longer.\n\n(Image: BBC/Guy Levy)\n\n(Image: BBC/Guy Levy)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nHe said: \u201cSince we started this thing and I saw how bloody good everyone is, the only person I\u2019ve been competing against is myself.\n\n\u201cI never thought I\u2019d get to the fifth week. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d enjoy it as much as I have. I knew it would be fun. But it has taken me by surprise how fun it is.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: The comic says he struggles being sultry and is worried his time on the BBC hit will come to an end when he\u2019s faced with the Tango and other raunchy routines", "authors": ["Janine Yaqoob", "Image", "Pa", "Bbc Guy Levy"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20654839.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Chris-Ramsay.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
