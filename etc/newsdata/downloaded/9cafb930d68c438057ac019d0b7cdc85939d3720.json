(Photo by Dylan Buell/Getty Images)\n\nBoxer Patrick Day is still in a coma following a knockout on Saturday night, and Charles Conwell, the man who delivered that knockout, is riddled with guilt.\n\nConwell was Day\u2019s opponent, and while he expressed concern for Day in an interview right after Day was taken out of the ring on a stretcher, he expanded on his feelings in an emotional letter he wrote to Day and posted on social media.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\u201cThis is my last time speaking on the situation because of this being a sensitive topic not only for his family and friends but for myself and the sport of boxing. \u201cDear Patrick Day, \u201cI never meant for this to happen to you. All I ever wanted to do was win. If I could take it all back I would no one deserves for this to happen to them. I replay the fight over and over in my head thinking what if this never happened and why did it happen to you. I can\u2019t stop thinking about it myself I prayed for you so many times and shedded so many tears because I couldn\u2019t even imagine how my family and friends would feel. I see you everywhere I go and all I hear is wonderful things about you. I thought about quitting boxing but I know that\u2019s not what you would want I know that you were a fighter at heart so I decided not to but to fight and win a world title because that\u2019s what you wanted and that\u2019s what I want so I\u2019ll use you as motivation every day and make sure I always leave it all in the ring every time. #ChampPatrickDay With Compassion, Charles Conwell\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nConwell is obviously devastated that Day is in a coma due to injuries he sustained during their fight, but vowed to fight on. Day\u2019s trainer Joseph Higgins believes that Patrick would want Conwell to fight on instead of quitting the sport. Higgins opened up a Twitter account on Monday specifically to tweet at Conwell, and to offer him some comfort.\n\nHello Charles, I am Patrick Day\u2019s trainer Joe Higgins. I just wanted you to know that we do understand what you must be going thru as well. As devastated as we are we realize you are equally devastated. We know if it was the other way around we would be just as distraught. \u2014 joseph higgins (@josephh61578929) October 15, 2019\n\nThank you for your kind words. Patrick was born across the street from me so our relationship is special. He would have wanted you to continue. I\u2019m am rooting for you to reach your dream, the same one he had. God Bless your Team and we will keep you in our prayers as well. \u2014 joseph higgins (@josephh61578929) October 15, 2019\n\nI too am distraught because I feel responsible but do realize there is no fault. Stay strong and please don\u2019t think we blame you. \u2014 joseph higgins (@josephh61578929) October 15, 2019\n\nBest wishes going forward and please continue to pray for Patrick. You guys are warriors, but humble and that\u2019s what makes you special. \u2014 joseph higgins (@josephh61578929) October 15, 2019\n\nHiggins\u2019 response to Conwell\u2019s poignant letter only drives home the point that boxing is a dangerous sport, and what happened to Day could happen to Conwell or to any boxer. Because of that reality there is forgiveness within the community, even when guilt is inevitable.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Charles Conwell admits he almost quit boxing in emotional letter he wrote to Patrick Day, who is still in a coma following Saturday's bout with Conwell.", "authors": ["Liz Roscher"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/cwfbShpejP_YofsQG8zR_Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xOM3DchI6UNlKHt.l7xxLA--~B/aD0zMDU4O3c9NDU4NztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/918a9510-ef63-11e9-be63-05ee27d22f4c", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
