She told Rubenstein that her late husband Martin Ginsburg initially suggested she take up exercise after she completed chemotherapy for colon cancer in 1999.\n\n\"He said, 'We must do something to purge yourself of [the cancer],'\" she recalled.\n\nThat's when Ginsburg met her long-time trainer, Bryant Johnson, who published the book \"The RBG Workout\" in 2017, and is still her trainer to this day.\n\nJohnson told CNBC Make It in 2018 that exercise seems to be a welcome respite from the rest of Ginsburg's day, which is why she feels re-energized afterwards. \"She's just working out,\" he said. \"It gives her brain time to rest and recharge.\"\n\nAlthough their sessions are a mental break, they're physically quite demanding.\n\nGinsburg typically does a combination of cardio and strength training exercises, such as planks and push-ups, and they will plan the hour-long routines months ahead of time, Johnson told CNBC Make It.\n\nGiven Ginsburg's demanding schedule and night owl tendencies, their sessions usually take place at night. \"She can come in there with only one hour of sleep, or two hours of sleep, and she is still committed to doing the work out,\" Johnson said.\n\nAnother thing Ginsburg is committed to? Her job. In late August, Ginsburg was treated for a tumor on her pancreas, but she reiterated to Rubenstein that she intends to stay on the court \"as long as I'm healthy and mentally agile.\"\n\nLike this story?
