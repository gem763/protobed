That\u2019s what I normally do already, but I think that against players like Dayana, even more.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the Czech Republic\u2019s Karolina Muchova fought back from a set down in her round robin opener to beat American Alison Riske 2-6 6-2 7-5.\n\nMuchova, who converted six of 13 break points, was 3-1 down in the deciding set before clawing her way back into the tie to keep her semi-final hopes alive.\n\nMeanwhile, American third seed Madison Keys overcame fifth seed Petra Martic of Croatia 6-3 6-4.", "description": "Kiki Bertens topped her round robin group in convincing fashion with a 6-4 6-3 victory over Dayana Yastremska to become the first player to qualify for the semi-finals of the WTA Elite Trophy in Zhuhai, China on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
