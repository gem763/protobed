As the tribes on the left and the right line up behind their respective woman and man, Pelosi vis-\u00e0-vis Trump, it\u2019s worth considering, even at this nascent stage, how we got here. And by this I don\u2019t mean how we got to a controversial phone call with Ukraine. Or Mueller. Or Trump. Or Biden.\n\nI mean how our politics got this broken. How the next weeks and months are likely to present wildly different interpretations of the same set of facts or call transcript. How it\u2019s highly likely that both President Donald Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi emerge claiming victory from the ensuing political circus, when what they want is diametrically opposed. How most ordinary Americans will feel that they are left holding the bag, having had political oxygen taken away from the big issues they care about, like paychecks and health care, and wondering what\u2019s happened to our politics and if it\u2019s always been this way or has changed (for the worse, of course).\n\nIt's worse, according to Princeton scholar Nolan McCarty. In his new and informative book, Polarization: What Everyone Needs To Know, McCarty documents how political polarization has swelled to unprecedented levels in America over the last 40 years, resulting in a toxic brew of legislative gridlock, extreme special interests and toxic partisan rancor. One might visualize polarization in American politics as a giant U-curve, which bottomed out following the world wars and began climbing again around the middle-to-late 1970s, with continuous increases ever since so that now the right side of the U far surpasses the left side.\n\nImportantly, the extreme polarization is mostly manifested by our political elites as opposed to ordinary people, and the data suggest they may be instigating it instead of responding to the electorate\u2019s demands.\n\nAccording to McCarty, as a broad trend, politicians have taken more extreme political views in each subsequent Congress, including how they vote and what bills they co-sponsor, with the slide to more extreme positions being most pronounced on the right (conservatives getting more conservative), although his data stop short of the dynamics in 2019 wherein the left seems to be racing full-steam towards socialism.\n\nThe trends in increased polarization are relatively consistent between the House and the Senate, and are reflected across the American political elite apparatus, including judges, state legislatures and media outlets (which can be seen when turning on Fox News or MSNBC).\n\nWhat\u2019s happening with ordinary Americans is less clear. For example, there\u2019s evidence to suggest that most Americans are exhausted by politics and tend to hold relatively moderated views on controversial issues ranging from abortion to gun control, though more divergent views on economic issues. Other evidence shows that the more one knows about politics, the more extreme issues one tends to take, suggesting that the moderated middle is the result of being ill-informed as opposed to reasonable, or at least holding a grab bag of political views that doesn\u2019t sort into either party.\n\nMcCarty unpacks many theories as to why polarization in America among elites has been increasing since the 1970s, including the rise in income inequality, the southern realignment from Democrat to Republican following the civil rights movement, and the rise of partisan and social media. At its root, it appears to be a very complex phenomenon, for which there is no single driver, but rather a confluence of forces. In this way, polarization is then best thought of as a cancer in our politics, which we all know is there and is very problematic, but its multitudinous and at times still mysterious causes make it difficult to avoid and eradicate.\n\nUnfortunately, the obvious solutions \u2014 at least as far as those presented in the book \u2014 are slim. For example, often discussed solutions for extreme partisanship such as redrawing Congressional districts or limiting donations from political action committees, are unlikely to make much of a difference to the problem of polarization, according to the research presented by McCarty. There may be some hope with broader institutional reform \u2014 making political parties stronger to wrangle in extreme members \u2014 allowing for more PAC contributions, not less, which ironically have tended to be a moderating force \u2014 and yes, even strengthening regional news, which tends to be less polarized. But here there\u2019s much more thought to be done.\n\nAll of which is to provide some context as to where we find ourselves and the impending impeachment proceedings. Any thought that the political tension of the Trump era would come to a head, to be resolved one way or another based on impeachment, is to fundamentally misunderstand the political times in which we find ourselves. Polarization continued unabated following Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. The political division we are seeing is rooted much deeper. This isn\u2019t to say that impeachment would not have political implications, surely it would, but only that it will not bring us together as a country or restore well-functioning politics.\n\n{\"unitName\":\"dfpPosition1\",\"display\":\"mobile\",\"isMobile\":false} hidden ad unit\n\nWhat most people can feel in the air \u2014 that we have never been more politically divided \u2014 is confirmed by the empirical evidence and will be on full display in the coming weeks. What began as a small climb up the rock of polarization has turned into a sheer and gigantic cliff, and we have never been so high off the ground. The people to look for are those who offer a rope for gently lowering back down, not those who beckon us to come higher still.\n\nAbby M.
