We'll see what happens if war starts again, but for now, we don't want to provoke or do anything that will adversely affect the negotiations,\" he told Reuters.\n\nChevron objected to a June request by Thailand's energy ministry to pay the full decommissioning costs of around US$2 billion for infrastructure in the Erawan gas field, including still usable assets it will transfer free of charge to Thai state oil firm PTT Exploration and Production Pcl when its concessions expire in April 2022.\n\nThe company argued that under the terms of its initial contracts from 1971, it was only liable for infrastructure deemed no longer usable.\n\nThe dispute has implications for France's Total SA and Japan's Mitsui & Co, which also have stakes in soon-expiring offshore energy concessions in the Gulf of Thailand.\n\nMinistry officials estimated the decommissioning costs for some 50 assets in the Bongkot field, operated by PTTEP and Total, are worth around US$1 billion.\n\nIn the Erawan field, Chevron and Mitsui & Co operate some 200 assets, estimated to cost around US$2 billion to remove.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [BANGKOK] Thailand's energy ministry said on Tuesday it had set a March target to resolve a US$2 billion dispute with US oil and gas major Chevron Corp and would make the \"utmost effort\" to reach a deal after the company halted arbitration. .
