It was shut\u201d.\n\nAs with much of his humour, there was some affection lying beneath the scorn, and have to say I like north Wales. I like it so much that I was perfectly happy to be perched on a little hill above the very nicely refurbished Llandudno seafront watching the \u201croad stage\u201d of the Rally Wales GB, the British round of the World Rally Championship (WRC). This involves the drivers spanking their racing Toyota Aygos, Ford Focuses, Skoda Fabias and Citroens C3s round the town, all sideways drifting, squealing tyres and bubbling burbling engines. I don\u2019t know if there is a Welsh word for that peculiarly miserable species of drizzle which the Scots call \u201cdreich\u201d, but we spectators were subjected to it a horrible dose of it. I hardly noticed, so much fun was I having. No, really.\n\nThe forest stages are even more exciting, because there is an even greater danger of someone\u2019s car attacking a tree. And the bit where you get to see the teams of mechanics descending on the cars for a service like just so many Amazonian killer ants was also a joy. I had to wonder why it takes my garage all morning to change the oil and filters on my Skoda, but I could watch the Citroen team virtually rebuild a rally C3 Aircross in half an hour. But all the time I was much more perplexed by the stray fact I\u2019d picked up, in a trip organised for me by Citroen (proper disclosure there) that the Citroen C3 Aircross, a paragon of consumer value and green values under normal circumstances, does about four miles per gallon when in full rally prep form.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

In future, Citroen says, it would like to see some rally stages conducted in electrified, zero-carbon silence, the raucous metallic mechanical symphony replaced by cars running in near silence. One option is for shorter stages to be run using only electric power, others run with petrol/electric hybrids and others with the traditional fossil-fuel powered designs.\n\nCitroen racing team director Pierre Budar is clear that it is something Citroen would like to see, but he has his concerns: \u201cComponents will have to be the same for everybody, at least for the beginning. Developing our own system would be very costly.\u201d\n\nHe adds that, with the extra weight of the batteries, the company will need to save weight elsewhere in its rally C3 Aircross cars, but in any case \u201cwe have to develop a car now\u201d, and \u201cwe will decide when Citroen knows what the regulations are\u201d. Given the lead time and the eventual retirement of this generation of the Citroen C3 model, decisions need to be made soon.\n\nBudar sees a petrol-electric hybrid as a \u201cgood proposition\u201d because it would at least retain some of that evocative growl from an internal combustion engine.\n\nThe broader aim is for the electrification of rallying to begin with the 2022 WRC, with additional costs for all the teams, whether shared or not. Earlier this year Citroen boss Linda Jackson said the company would have to reconsider staying in WRC if the current rules didn\u2019t move with the times: \u201cBecause everything is changing and I don\u2019t see how I can continue to support something that is without any reflection of what\u2019s going on in society.\u201d\n\nIt would certainly be a loss to have Citroen abandon WRC, for them as well as the fans. Their driver Sebastien Ogier \u2013 who took bronze in Wales \u2013 is in second position in the overall drivers\u2019 standings, with two more rallies, this weekend\u2019s Rally Catalunya in Spain and next month\u2019s Rally Australia to run. They should be exhilarating, even without the drizzle.\n\nSearch for used cars", "description": "I remember the old Les Dawson joke all too well. \u201cI went to Rhyl once.
