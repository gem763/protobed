I knew I was too old to be afraid of the dark, but I hated climbing the stairs of my childhood home in Harrogate, North Yorks. Why? Because I often felt the presence of a ghost.\n\nIt was just there, watching, and it made my whole body tingle with fear. But I didn\u2019t just sense it \u2013 I could see it too.\n\nI remember being seven years old and walking out of my bedroom into the hall. A dark cloud breezed past the doorway and down the stairs, before vanishing.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d I shouted down the dark stairwell.\n\nMy voice echoed into the empty space, I was alone on the top-floor landing. However, I wasn\u2019t alone in the Edwardian terraced house.\n\nI didn\u2019t mention it to my parents or my three older sisters. In fact, we never talked about the spooky goings-on.\n\n(Image: Daily Express)\n\nMy parents were more concerned about making their B&B a success \u2013 and a ghost wasn\u2019t good for business.\n\nHowever, our resident ghoul certainly scared a few of our guests. One man came down to breakfast ashen-faced.\n\n\u201cI woke up in the middle of the night and felt someone sitting on the bed,\u201d he \u00adstuttered. \u201cWhen I turned on the light there was an indent in the covers. Do you have a ghost?\u201d\n\nMum and Dad tried to laugh it off.\n\nI was brought up Catholic and went to church every week, so talking about the dead didn\u2019t feel right. But my religious upbringing didn\u2019t stop me from having these eerie experiences.\n\nI remember lying in bed one night on the top floor when I felt the ghost a few feet away. I pulled the covers over my head and whispered the Lord\u2019s Prayer.\n\n(Image: Daily Express)\n\nI sensed the presence leave, but then I heard an almighty crash in the bathroom across the hall. I was too scared to investigate but in the morning I found my father\u2019s heavy glass ashtray on the floor, unbroken.\n\nHad the ghost thrown the ashtray? I don\u2019t know, but my young mind thought it had.\n\nWhile I like to think the ghost didn\u2019t wish me harm, one incident suggests otherwise. I was in the shower room with my sister Susan when suddenly she screamed.\n\nThe shower room was covered in mirrored tiles and a ceiling tile fell down right above me.\n\nJust in time, Susan pushed me out of the way and the jagged glass cut her arm. I shudder to think what might have happened if she hadn\u2019t been there.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nMy parents never talked about any of this but they made some changes. They turned the bedroom where the guest felt the ghost sit on the bed into a dining room.\n\nI also remember a priest coming round and flicking holy water into the corners of each room. Things calmed down, but I still occasionally encountered the ghost on the stairs.\n\nWhen I was eight, we left the B&B for a hotel in another part of \u00adHarrogate. The new place was light, bright and definitely not haunted.\n\nBut I never spoke to my family about my experiences until recently, when I met my sister Jane, now 53, for a coffee.\n\nWe were talking about the ghostly theme of my first novel, The Winter\u2019s Sleep, which was inspired by my childhood.\n\n\u201cYou know the B&B in Harrogate was haunted, don\u2019t you?\u201d she said. I nodded, thrilled she remembered the spooky events too.\n\nThen my sister added: \u201cMum found out that a young girl died in the room where the ghost sat on the beds. That\u2019s why she changed it.\u201d\n\nI was so grateful that my sister shared this information. The mystery of the ghost\u2019s identity had been solved, and I hope she\u2019s now resting in peace.", "description": "Writer Monica Cafferky\u2018s childhood encounter with a ghost in her B&B home sparked a lifelong interest in the paranormal", "authors": ["Monica Cafferky", "Image", "Daily Express"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20761424.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_1-Monica-Cafferky-stairs-c-Michelle-GordonAJPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
