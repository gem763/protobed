Specific Apple Watch models are able to connect via 4G LTE, enabling you to go on a run or an errand without needing to carry your phone.\n\nSo far, three models of the Apple Watch support this feature:\n\nThese models tend to cost more than the base models that only support Wi-Fi and GPS connectivity (up to $100 more, depending on the smartwatch model you\u2019re looking for). Additionally, you\u2019ll have to pay a monthly fee to your carrier in order to use the LTE connectivity.\n\nActivate your Apple Watch on an LTE network\n\nThe first step is to open up the Watch app on your iPhone; it\u2019s where you manage everything that has to do with your smartwatch. Scroll down and tap on \u201cCellular\u201d and then tap on \u201cSet up Cellular.\u201d\n\nWhat you see next \u2014 and how much you pay \u2014 will vary depending on your carrier. Since I\u2019m a Verizon customer, it asked me to sign in with my phone number, then verify that I want to add the Apple Watch to my plan.\n\nThe carrier you use can depend on the model of your Watch. (Here\u2019s Apple\u2019s list of supported carriers.) According to Apple, your phone and Apple Watch must be on the same carrier. However, the Apple Watch supports up to five cellular plans, so you can switch carriers with a reasonable amount of confidence.\n\nHere\u2019s what it could cost with some of the major carriers:\n\nIf you have a connected device data plan (a flat fee for a set amount of data per month) with Verizon, adding an Apple Watch costs $5 per month as well as a $30 activation fee when you add it to your plan. You can activate the Apple Watch on a single device plan that offers 1GB of data for $10 per month. If you have an unlimited phone plan, it costs $10 more per month.\n\nT-Mobile charges $10 per month to add an Apple Watch to your plan, and the carrier may charge you a $20 fee for activation. This price seems to be consistent no matter which plan you have at T-Mobile.\n\nAT&T charges $10 per month to add an Apple Watch to your plan whether you have an unlimited plan or are just going to connect a single device. It may charge you up to $45 to activate the Watch.\n\nSprint doesn\u2019t offer standalone plans for the Apple Watch, so you\u2019ll have to be enrolled in a data plan for your phone. It costs $10 per month to add a cellular-enabled Apple Watch to your Sprint plan.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve successfully added the Apple Watch to your mobile plan, you can switch the cellular function on or off by swiping upward on the home screen of the Apple Watch, then tapping the top left option that looks like a radio tower. It will turn green when cellular is activated, indicating that you\u2019re now free to leave your phone at home without worrying about missing out on a notification.", "description": "Certain Apple Watch models with LTE connectivity allow you to receive all of your messages and calls without needing your phone nearby.
