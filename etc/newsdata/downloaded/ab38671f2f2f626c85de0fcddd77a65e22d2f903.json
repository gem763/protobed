REUTERS/Ringo Chiu\n\nIn \"She Said,\" Twohey and Kantor explain that Bloom represented former Fox contributor and attorney Tamara Holder in her sexual assault case against Fox executive Francisco Cortes, who she said trapped her in his office and tried to force her to perform oral sex.\n\nBloom helped Holder attain a settlement for more than $2.5 million, but Holder later told the reporters that Bloom didn't explain just how ironclad the terms of the settlement were. Holder wanted to speak out about what had happened to her, but if articles were published, she would lose much of the $2.5 million.\n\n\"She did not care about me. She cared about the money,\" Holder later told Twohey, explaining that Bloom fired her and walked away with $1 million after Holder voiced her concerns. In \"She Said,\" Bloom denies that she pressured Holder, and says she walks through settlements line-by-line with her clients.\n\nRead more: The career of Lisa Bloom: How Gloria Allred's daughter ended up defending Harvey Weinstein and came to regret it\n\nOn Twitter, after the memo sent from Bloom to Weinstein leaked, another one of her former clients spoke out: Kathy Griffin. Bloom represented Griffin after the comedian posted a picture of her holding up a prop of President Donald Trump's severed head.\n\nIn her thread, Griffin explains that Bloom called a press conference days after the photo blew up online, during which Griffin felt more like a prop in \"an infomercial for her firm in her office.\" The comedian also said Bloom invited reporters from Entertainment Tonight, who interviewed Bloom while Griffin was in her office with Bloom's husband, who held the door shut.\n\nGriffin also said that conservative bloggers showed up to the press conference and harassed her, and that Bloom then charged her $40,000 for representation and advocacy, which Griffin asked to be returned - Bloom refused.", "description": "The new book \"She Said\" from the New York Times reporters who broke the Harvey Weinstein sex scandal explores how feminist lawyer Lisa Bloom operates.", "authors": ["Kat Tenbarge"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7cf433f4fc24221f260c38-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
