The number of employed people over 60 rose by a whopping 397,000, the biggest rise since statistics began in 1982. The reason is that the government created a lot of temporary public-sector jobs like park attendants and janitors and implemented the scheme in February rather than March, as is usual.\n\nThe government hiked the budget for the scheme from W634.9 billion to W821.9 billion, and increased eligible participants from 510,000 last year to 610,000 this year (US$1=W1,133).\n\nThese jobs usually pay W300,000 a month for two or three hours of work a day.", "description": "Employment up But Figures Deceptive", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/03/14/2019031401773_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-14"}
