Edith, famously, was plagued with just about every misfortune interwar Britain could throw at her as a young woman \u201ccoming into\u201d society, while Cora was mostly relegated to mom purgatory in favor of the family\u2019s feistier (and more quotable) women. The new Downton movie, in theaters today, managed to shift the dynamics a little bit: Edith is now happily married \u2014 and pregnant! \u2014 to a nice chap with an ever nicer title, while Cora continues to exude her signature quiet confidence to boost up the success of her daughters.\n\nStill, when Vulture spoke with McGovern and Carmichael earlier this week in a Manhattan hotel suite, the women were candid about how far their characters have (and haven\u2019t) come with their differing levels of powers, and how that\u2019s affected their outlook on the roles. And, in a lighter topic, we also discussed Maggie Smith\u2019s favorite GIF, which is not what you\u2019d expect.\n\nLaura, were you pleased that absolutely nothing bad happened to Edith in the movie?\n\n\ufeffLaura Carmichael: A very strong \u201cyes.\u201d [Laughs.] That was my fear of going back into the world of Downton. Don\u2019t spoil her happy ending! I\u2019m so happy she was in a good place. There\u2019s still a struggle she\u2019s going through, with her husband potentially leaving for a year. But it\u2019s not at the level of Edith\u2019s problems in the past.\n\nI worried you might get Matthew\u2019ed during your driving scene.\n\n\ufeffElizabeth McGovern: Oh dear God, imagine?\n\nLC: Thankfully, she\u2019s very happy.\n\nEM: Remember that season where you had to learn how to drive a tractor?\n\nLC: I still can\u2019t drive. I had lessons and I can drive, so that\u2019s me legitimately driving that car. But I don\u2019t have a license or anything.\n\nEM: You had the right to be nervous then!\n\nAnd there\u2019s no sisterly drama between Edith and Mary, either. How times have changed.\n\n\ufeffLC: They\u2019re still a little bit rusty, and they tease each other. They know how much they push each other, but they\u2019re very content with their lives. They\u2019re living apart, which definitely helps.\n\nEM: It takes the pressure off the rivalry.\n\nIt\u2019s just so perfect that Edith outranks everyone in the family now. Marchioness is such a great title.\n\n\ufeffLC: I\u2019m always a bit nervous saying that word in front of Julian Fellowes, because he\u2019ll be like, That\u2019s not how you pronounce it! I love, of course, that she outranks them. But what\u2019s nice is that doesn\u2019t affect them in any way. In the practical sense, they\u2019re quite modern, but they do have new rules and responsibilities that go along with living in a gigantic castle. A Marchioness is high up there in the ranking.\n\nEM: She\u2019s above Earl, but below Duchess. There\u2019s not a lot of Marchionesses anymore, the Duchesses are a dime a dozen.\n\nSomething I always found interesting with your characters throughout Downton is that, despite both of them being within a family of high rank, they persistently had little to no power compared to everyone else \u2014 Edith was always treated with contempt until her marriage, while Cora didn\u2019t really have much to do except be dutiful mother and wife, since the Dowager Countess was the family\u2019s matriarch. Did that start to affect your psyches after awhile?\n\n\ufeffEM: The most singular thing that always strikes me is that neither of them really take the lead. Cora literally has no power whatsoever. She has no power even over their own money. It\u2019s quite straining that and it goes across generations \u2014 when Cora\u2019s children grow up and when Mary marries, Mary then completely takes over the running of her mother\u2019s house. Cora very graciously steps aside. It\u2019s a really interesting challenge for me, because it feels like I have absolutely no control or power, or really a role, in any way. Which is kind of a challenge to play. But it\u2019s very real. The Dowager herself technically stepped aside when Cora came into the marriage, but she lives on the property in a separate home and is always present. I imagine today that if my two girls grew up and I was expected to step aside while they ran my own house, that would be a really serious adjustment for me. But it\u2019s also interesting how Edith has a whole storyline now that she\u2019s achieved this power, but still feels utterly powerless in her life. There\u2019s nothing she has any control over.\n\nLC: You see in the film how Edith misses London. There\u2019s a scene where Bertie tells her, You must spend more time in London.\n\nEM: He was picking up on her frustration.\n\nLC: It\u2019s a great moment of understanding. Edith has definitely had an interesting change. Julian managed to show these changes for women in a way that made sense for their characters. Edith started off as the most traditional girl in the beginning, and just wanted to be married and have things come her way, and things never came her way. That forced her frustration into a bit of action, and that made sense for her. I always felt that Cora\u2019s separateness came because she\u2019s an American as well. She\u2019s not playing the same game as Violet and Robert are playing.\n\nEM: I don\u2019t know. Even if she were playing the game, it\u2019s not much that she can do. I always feel such a relief to step out of the period when we\u2019re done filming because it\u2019s like, God, I have a voice and have some control! Even though I\u2019m just playing a part, I find that this feeling of being straight-jacketed is really palpable. In no way, even in my most sentimental moment, do I actually want to live in that period.\n\nDo you think your characters feel the same way as you about their power?\n\nEM: I don\u2019t think Cora particularly feels that way, because she would have no other expectations for herself, ever. That\u2019s just how I feel. She deals with it very gracefully, and maybe she\u2019s a bit relieved that it\u2019s not really her responsibility. In her subtle way, she does insert herself. For instance, in the film, she talks on Edith\u2019s behalf to the Queen and rearranges Bertie to stay home and be with his pregnant wife. She knows how to work the system when she needs to. She doesn\u2019t stamp her feet. She does take a firm line when it\u2019s important.\n\nLC: The fun thing about playing someone in the aristocracy is everyone has an innate sense of confidence and power walking into a room. I enjoy that because it\u2019s definitely not my personality.\n\nEM: The confidence of being born into it.\n\nLC: You can complain about anything, but there\u2019s a sense of knowing you\u2019re important. When Edith writes a letter to the Times, it\u2019s immediately published because she\u2019s the Earl\u2019s daughter. I always quite enjoyed that, even with the frustration of Edith being held back a bit by her gender and misfortune.\n\nTo celebrate the Dowager Countess not dying in the film, can you tell me your favorite Maggie Smith story?\n\n\ufeffLC: She always makes us laugh. We howl.\n\nEM: What she says backstage is arguably funnier than what she says on camera. She\u2019s always uncomfortable in her wigs and costumes. I remember one time she had a high neckline on a dress, and she kept yanking at it, and she goes, Now I know why the French invented the guillotine.\n\nLC: There\u2019s this one cat GIF that really makes her laugh. Whenever she got tired she would tell us, Show me that cat again. After a while I started collecting GIFs in a folder of my phone called \u201cFunny Photos for Mags.\u201d She doesn\u2019t have an iPhone.\n\nWhat\u2019s the GIF she loves so much?\n\nLC: [Long pause.] It\u2019s kind of rude. It\u2019s a cat with its mouth totally agape with the caption, Lesbians eat WHAT? She thought it was the funniest thing she\u2019d ever seen.", "description": "Vulture interview Elizabeth McGovern and Laura Carmichael from the Downton Abbey movie, about how much their characters have grown within the Crawley family.", "authors": ["Devon Ivie"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/16/16-laura-carmichael-elizabeth-mcgovern-chat-room-silo.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
