No medal. No more winning streak.\n\nThe U.S. reign atop international basketball has ended \u2014 this time, thwarted by France at the World Cup.\n\nFor the first time since 2006, the U.S. sent NBA players to a major international tournament and won\u2019t win gold. Evan Fournier scored 22 points, Rudy Gobert had 21 points and 16 rebounds and France beat the U.S. 89-79 in the World Cup quarterfinals on Wednesday, rallying from a seven-point fourth-quarter deficit to pull off the upset.\n\n\u201cAny loss hurts,\u201d U.S. coach Gregg Popovich said. \u201cAnd in this situation, it hurts more. But life goes on. This is very important and we would have loved to have won \u2026 but we\u2019re all grown, we all have families and lives and life goes on.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. had won 58 consecutive tournament games in FIBA and Olympic competition, starting with the bronze-medal game at the 2006 world championships and continuing through every FIBA Americas, World Cup and Olympics event since. It was bidding to become the first nation to win three consecutive World Cups, after winning three straight Olympic golds in that span.\n\nThe best the Americans can do now in China is finish fifth, and they\u2019re assured of their worst finish in a big tournament with NBA players since placing sixth at the 2002 world championships. They\u2019re going home with a berth in the 2020 Olympics secured but no medal.\n\nDonovan Mitchell scored 29 points for the U.S., all of them coming in the first three quarters. The Americans came up scoreless on six consecutive possessions down the stretch, the drought that allowed the French to take control of a back-and-forth game for the final time.\n\n\u201cJust got to take it like a man at this point,\u201d U.S guard Kemba Walker said. \u201cWe lost. There\u2019s nothing we can do. We competed. We\u2019ve been competing since day one that we got to training camp. But we gave it everything we\u2019ve got. I know we\u2019re Team USA and things of that nature and they\u2019ve been winning for a lot of years, but you know, we didn\u2019t get a chance to pull it off.\u201d\n\nNando De Colo scored 18 for France. The French held the U.S. to 4 for 15 shooting in the fourth quarter \u2014 and benefited from the Americans going 4 for 11 from the foul line in the final 10 minutes.\n\n\u201cWe came here to win gold,\u201d Gobert said. \u201cWe knew it wasn\u2019t going to be easy. A lot of people counted us out, but we got the win.\u201d\n\nGobert said beating the Americans wasn\u2019t the goal \u2014 winning gold is.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean anything if you don\u2019t win in the end,\u201d Gobert said.\n\nFrance was up 10 early in the second half. The U.S. went on a 31-14 run over the next 10 minutes to go up by seven. And then the French responded with a 15-2 run over the next five minutes, going up 82-76 on a long jumper by Frank Ntilikina with 2:05 left.\n\nMitchell had a chance to get the U.S. within two with about a minute left, driving against Gobert \u2014 but the Utah center read what the Utah guard was going to do perfectly, swatting the try away.\n\n\u201cWe beat the U.S., and that\u2019s huge, but we haven\u2019t won anything yet,\u201d France\u2019s Nicolas Batum said.\n\nFrance had been 0-9 against the U.S. in major international play, most of those outcomes one-sided affairs. But the last meeting between the nations was only a 100-97 U.S. win at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics three years ago, and France returned three players \u2014 Gobert, De Colo and Batum \u2014 who got minutes in that game.\n\nNone of the U.S. players who played that afternoon in Rio is on this year\u2019s World Cup team.\n\nFrance outrebounded the U.S. 21-12 in the first half, Gobert found his way to the line 10 times in the game\u2019s first 20 minutes and the Americans went into the break trailing 45-39. The U.S. had trailed for 8:25 in their first five games combined \u2014 and trailed for 11:24 in the first half alone on Wednesday.\n\nFournier\u2019s layup with 7:33 left in the third gave France a 53-43 lead, and that\u2019s when Mitchell got going.\n\nHe had 14 points in the third quarter, and his dunk with 2:40 left pulled the U.S. into a 60-60 tie. Marcus Smart made three free throws after getting fouled by Gobert to put the U.S. back on top, and the Americans took a 66-63 lead into the fourth.\n\nBut they couldn\u2019t finish it off.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, you\u2019ve got to tip your cap to them,\u201d U.S. guard Joe Harris said. \u201cThey outplayed us. They deserved to win. We certainly didn\u2019t deserve to win that game.\u201d\n\nTIP-INS\n\nFrance: Gobert played the first 12:26. The longest he went before getting his first break in a Jazz game last season was 11:30. \u2026 Ntilikina scored 11 for France. \u2026 The U.S. didn\u2019t turn the ball over at a very high rate \u2014 11 times \u2014 but France converted those giveaways into 22 points.\n\nU.S.: Smart scored 11 and Walker had 10 for the U.S. \u2026 Before Mitchell\u2019s offensive outburst Wednesday, the previous single-game scoring high for any U.S. player at this World Cup was Jaylen Brown\u2019s 20-point game against Japan in the opening group round. \u2026 Jayson Tatum (sprained left ankle) missed his fourth consecutive game.\n\nLAUDING FRANCE\n\nPopovich had the highest praise for France and coach Vincent Collet. \u201cIt\u2019s the best French team I\u2019ve seen, because they play on both ends of the court,\u201d Popovich said.\n\nOLYMPIC BERTHS\n\nAustralia\u2019s win over the Czech Republic in the other quarterfinal on Wednesday gave France something else to celebrate \u2014 an Olympic berth. Spain and France are assured of being the top two World Cup finishers from Europe, earning them automatic spots into the field for the 2020 Tokyo Games.\n\nOthers qualified so far: the U.S., Nigeria, Iran, Australia, Argentina and Japan. The last four spots in the 12-team field will be decided next year.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nFrance: Faces Argentina in semifinals at Beijing on Friday.\n\nU.S.: Faces Serbia in consolation round at Dongguan on Thursday.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "For the first time since 2006, the U.S. sent NBA players to a major international tournament and won't win gold.
