Some of them even took part in the commemorative parachute jumps.\n\n\"This was terrifyingly thrilling,\" 97-year-old veteran Sandy Cortman told Dutch TV after his jump. \"I won't be doing this again tomorrow.\"\n\n(Reporting by Bart Meijer; Editing by Ros Russell)", "description": "EDE, Netherlands (Reuters) - Operation Market Garden, the ultimately failed attempt to liberate the north of the Netherlands from Nazi Germany in September 1944, was commemorated by veterans and royalty in the Netherlands on Saturday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/apple-touch-icon.png", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
