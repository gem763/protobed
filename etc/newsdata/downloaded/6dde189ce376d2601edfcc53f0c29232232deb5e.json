China to add pork, soybeans to tariff exemption list ahead of talks", "language": "en", "text": "As Democrats on stage at the presidential debate took their shots at Donald Trump\u2019s trade strategy with China, it looks as though it has begun producing some results. In a surprise move, Beijing announced that it would roll back tariffs on key agricultural products ahead of next week\u2019s initial trade talks. China had targeted pork and soybeans in order to put pressure on Trump through his rural voter base, but appear to have reversed course:\n\nChina will exempt some agricultural products from additional tariffs on U.S. goods, China\u2019s official Xinhua News Agency said Friday, in the latest sign of easing Sino-U.S. tensions before a new rounds of talks aimed at curbing a bruising trade war. \u2026 \u201cChina supports relevant enterprises buying certain amounts of soybeans, pork and other agricultural products from today in accordance with market principles and WTO rules,\u201d Xinhua said, adding that the Customs Tariff Commission of China\u2019s State Council would exclude additional tariffs on those items. China has \u201cbroad prospects\u201d for importing high-quality U.S. agricultural goods, Xinhua reported, citing unnamed authorities.\n\nPart of this is motivated not so much by trade pressures but domestic problems at home. As Reuters notes, a swine-flu epidemic has forced domestic pork prices to skyrocket. China can\u2019t produce enough to meet demand, and the last thing they need right now is more unrest at home to go along with the uprising in Hong Kong.\n\nHowever, extending that to soybeans might be more of a trade-war blink:\n\nChina is also expected to step up purchases of soybeans, historically the most valuable U.S. farm export which China has largely avoided buying since the trade war began last year. Before the announcement of additional tariff exemptions, Chinese firms bought at least 10 boatloads of U.S. soybeans on Thursday, the country\u2019s most significant purchases since at least June.\n\nOne has to wonder whether that reflects production problems at home, too. Either way, it will make American farmers happy, while at the same time taking the pressure off American negotiators. China\u2019s concessions now go deep into the heart of their leverage in those talks.\n\nThis follows a grudging concession by Trump yesterday that he might consider an interim trade agreement to ease tensions, but he\u2019d prefer to wait for a full settlement:\n\nThe president told reporters he would like to ink a full agreement with the world\u2019s second largest economy. However, he left the door open to striking a limited deal with Beijing. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to do the deal, let\u2019s get it done,\u201d he told reporters as he left for a congressional Republican retreat in Baltimore. \u201cA lot of people are talking about it, I see a lot of analysts are saying an interim deal \u2014 meaning we\u2019ll do pieces of it, the easy ones first. But there\u2019s no easy or hard. There\u2019s a deal or there\u2019s not a deal. But it\u2019s something we would consider, I guess.\u201d Trump\u2019s statements add to confusion sparked earlier in the day about what the White House would accept in its ongoing negotiations with China. U.S. stock indexes initially climbed on a report that the Trump administration talked about crafting an interim agreement. A White House official then said the U.S. is \u201cabsolutely not\u201d considering such a deal, causing markets to give up some of those gains. Asked to clarify if Trump\u2019s position had changed from earlier in the day, White House spokesman Judd Deere emphasized the president\u2019s comment that he would prefer a complete agreement.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump delayed the next round of tariffs from October 1 to October 15, calling it a \u201cgesture of goodwill.\u201d The move allows Xi Jinping to celebrate the communist government\u2019s 70th anniversary without the hike as context, but more practically allows a little more time for negotiations. That also puts a damper on the \u201cinterim\u201d idea, as it would still likely lead to significant tariff increases on goods outside whatever partial pact is made.\n\nThe concessions on pork and soybeans are significant, much more so than a two-week delay in tariffs. It signals that China can\u2019t afford to deal with a lengthy trade war, especially not this year. They may not like it, but they still need to trade in order to feed their massive population, and China might have to get used to fully opening their markets and complying with agreements to do so.", "description": "Pork and beans.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/trump-xi-handshake.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
