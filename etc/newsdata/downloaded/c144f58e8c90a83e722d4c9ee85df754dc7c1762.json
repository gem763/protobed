Career experts across the board have named lack of explanation as one of the biggest mistakes that applicants make in their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.\n\n\"Lack of measurements and results in the file is my biggest r\u00e9sum\u00e9 pet peeve,\" executive r\u00e9sum\u00e9 writer and career strategist Adrienne Tom previously told Business Insider. \"Without any measurements of success, the file is lacking proof of skill.\"\n\nBe specific, and include plenty of data.

Including the numbers that back up your success is key, Tina Nicolai, executive career coach and founder of R\u00e9sum\u00e9 Writers' Ink, previously told Business Insider.\n\nBe as specific as possible. Write, \"Helped grow revenue by 500% to $1 million in 12 month period by doing X\" instead of \"Helped grow revenue,\" Nicolai said.\n\n\"Employers need numbers to be able to fully evaluate the scope of your bandwidth,\" Nicolai said. \"No position is exempt from measuring results. And metrics help employers determine if a person is capable of leading a team, managing clients, or growing the business.\"\n\nThis extends to job interviews as well, Diaz said. She recommended discussing your previous roles with other people, so you can practice giving concrete examples of your achievements and explaining what your job meant beyond the title and the company.\n\n\"People might not take the time to think about the impact of the work they've done,\" Diaz said. \"I want to understand scope of impact more than just job titles.\"", "description": "To get a job at\u00a0Amazon, it's not enough to work at name-brand companies like the New York Times or Google.
