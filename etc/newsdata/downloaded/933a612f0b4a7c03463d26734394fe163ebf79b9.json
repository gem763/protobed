Arsineh Houspian\n\nMr Berriman said the amount of funding required would depend on how long the case ran for, but he was in discussion with \"massive global funds\" with the resources to fund it until the end, even if it was drawn out.\n\n\"I'd be surprised if [the court case] isn't launched in the next couple of months,\" he said.\n\n\"The world has changed since early 2018 when Google unlawfully shut down Unlockd. There is ACCC investigations, US Senate enquiries, fines being handed down globally everywhere \u2013 the world (and regulators) have come around to the fact that anti-trust behaviour is not only bad for business, but the wider community and ultimately consumers and future innovation.\"", "description": "Unlockd founder Matt Berriman has not given up on his fight against tech giant Google.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3308%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_84%2C$y_137/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/98ab1477366a0ac74e548300b925597db0592118", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
