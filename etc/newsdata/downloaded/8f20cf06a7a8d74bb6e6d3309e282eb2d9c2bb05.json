So if they're watching perhaps they'll make us another one.\"\n\nDuring the interview Anne also spoke about the negative coverage of her in the newspapers, saying she didn't believe she fit the \"fairy story princess\" label.\n\nShe said: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult, I always think, to take an intelligent interest and wear a grin.\u201d\n\nSpeaking about her brother Prince Charles, she added: \u201cBut men can be more serious \u2013 they\u2019re allowed to be.\n\n\u201cWomen aren\u2019t supposed to be funny either.\u201d", "description": "The Queen was visiting Australia with her family, including daughter Princess Anne, when three cheeky students came up and presented her with the bizarre gift", "authors": ["Zoe Forsey", "Image", "Getty Images", "Popperfoto Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20666369.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Royal-Tour-Of-Australia.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
