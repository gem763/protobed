The enigmatic former All-Star was as forthright as he\u2019s ever been, and his takes were hotter than a blowtorch.\n\nIt is worth a listen if only for the story about the time he boxed Ray Allen in the weight room, shortly after Paul Pierce vs. Patrick O\u2019Bryant and Glen \u201cBig Baby\u201d Davis vs. Tony Allen served as the undercard. Rondo compared the chemistry and competition on his 2008 NBA champion Boston Celtics to his current Lakers team, which he \u201cabsolutely\u201d believes should be expected to win the championship. But that is only the beginning of an hour-long trip inside the mind of a player whose career has made a wild journey that began with extraordinary genius on a perennial contender in Boston and rode the wave of an enigmatic journeyman before landing with his greatest rivals as the \u201cold head\u201d to another star-laden squad.\n\nRondo called Game 7 of the 2010 Finals \u201cthe most frustrating loss I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d adding: \u201cS---, I would\u2019ve been Finals MVP if we\u2019d won it.\u201d He believes the referees cheated the Celtics out of a victory against the Miami Heat when he posted 44 points, 10 assists and eight rebounds opposite LeBron James in Game 2 of the 2012 Eastern Conference finals. Retirement is on his mind, maybe even after this season if the Lakers can take the title, and then he wants to pursue a career as a coach and/or general manager. In 14 seasons, he has seen halftime transform from a chance to focus on in-game adjustments to a branding opportunity, with the entire team on their phones, plus the evolution of defensive schemes, the 3-pointer and point guards whose green light to shoot 28 times a game makes it almost impossible for him to keep up with younger guys like Damian Lillard, Russell Westbrook and Stephen Curry.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nStory continues\n\nAs far as player empowerment goes, Rondo supports it, with at least one exception: Kevin Durant.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a big fan of stacking teams,\u201d Rondo told Hill. \u201cWhat dude did to join them, I don\u2019t like that at all. That\u2019s just the competitor I am.\u201d\n\nHe conceded that his Celtics were pretty stacked with Pierce, Allen and Kevin Garnett (\u201cthe most unselfish teammate I\u2019ve ever played with\u201d), but does not think his Lakers fit that bill.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just LeBron and AD [Anthony Davis],\u201d he added. \u201cThe rest of us, we\u2019re role players.\u201d\n\nBut enough about the current NBA landscape. Rondo was at his best when Hill steered the conversation into territory that he has almost never covered publicly, digging deep enough to discover that the uber-competitive point guard recently got suspended two games from coaching his son\u2019s Mitey-Mite youth football team for cussing out a referee at the end of a game.\n\n\u201cHe was stalling us,\u201d Rondo told the former ESPN personality turned multimedia star. \u201cThey didn\u2019t put the football down. They were taking their time to put the football down. Instead of getting the play off, they ran the clock out on us, but that\u2019s neither here nor there. I\u2019m back now, and we\u2019ve got the playoffs on Oct. 26. I did my time. I\u2019m ready to get back at it.\u201d\n\nRajon Rondo enters his second season on the Los Angeles Lakers. (Reuters)\n\nThen came Rondo\u2019s hottest takes:\n\nHill: Spades or Connect 4? Rondo: \u201cSpades.\u201d Hill: Paul Pierce or Dwyane Wade? Rondo: \u201cP squared. Absolutely.\u201d\n\n(Wade infamously dislocated Rondo\u2019s elbow in Game 3 of the 2011 Eastern Conference semifinals, leading Rondo to call Wade a dirty player. Rondo says the two squashed their beef before teaming up on the Chicago Bulls, although they had their moments then, too.)\n\nHill: Would you rather have dinner with Rick Carlisle or Chris Paul? Rondo: \u201cChris Paul. It is what it is. If you\u2019re going to give me them two, I\u2019m going to go with him and figure something out. Damn sure not [good] with Rick.\u201d\n\n(Again, Rondo has a longstanding beef with Paul that culminated in a physical altercation last season that may have begun with Rondo spitting in Paul\u2019s face. So, for Rondo to put his feud with Paul below Carlisle \u2014 the Dallas Mavericks coach with whom he constantly butted heads before being benched in the playoffs \u2014 is really quite something.)\n\nHill: LeBron or Jordan? Rondo: \u201cLeBron. KG used to kill me, but I mean, to be honest, I didn\u2019t really watch Jordan growing up. I didn\u2019t really watch basketball at all growing up. With the expectations that came in with LeBron, he\u2019s exceeded every expectation. He\u2019s killed it, from every statistical category there is, and not too many people can do that. To have that kind of pressure on you from the age of 12 and still be the most elite in the world at 33.\u201d Hill: \u201cPower\u201d or \u201cThe Wire\u201d? Rondo: \u201cPower.\u201d Hill: Biggie or Pac? Rondo: \u201cPac.\u201d\n\nIf the coaching or GM thing does not work out for Rondo in retirement, these hot takes would serve him well as a commentator.\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nBen Rohrbach is a staff writer for Yahoo Sports.
