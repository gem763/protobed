For the first time, China is now spending more money than any other nation, according to one closely watched funding metric.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s rise is due to decades of focused reform and strong investment, which is clearly paying off with powerful results and which is set to continue,\u201d said Phil Baty, chief knowledge officer of Times Higher Education, a London-based magazine that produced the global rankings and last week published its fourth annual ranking of U.S. universities in partnership with The Wall Street Journal.\n\nTimes Higher Education World University Rankings 2020 Note: Similar rankings indicate a tie Times Higher Education\n\nThe 16th annual global rankings are weighted toward research with academic citations and perceptions of reputation by other scholars carrying the significant heft. Universities from 92 countries are counted.\n\nThe University of Cambridge fell one spot to No. 3 and the U.S. took the next six spots with Stanford University coming in fourth, followed by Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Princeton, Harvard, Yale and the University of Chicago. Imperial College London rounded out the top 10.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Did you go to college abroad? Which one?

The U.K. was home to 28 of the top 200 institutions, and Germany is home to 23.\n\nBut the balance of power continues to shift toward Asia in general and China in particular. The number of top 200 universities in Asia grew by two to 24. China had seven in the top 200, the same as last year, led by Tsinghua University at No. 23 and Peking University at 24.\n\nThe tilt toward China is easier to see over a longer stretch. The U.S. has lost nine universities from the world top 400 list in five years, while at the same time, China has gained five.\n\nDecline in U.S. performance over the past five years is largely due to disinvestment in public universities, which have seen a 5% drop in institutional income over that time. The University of Pittsburgh has dropped 34 places, Rutgers has fallen 45, the University of Massachusetts has dropped 69 places and University of California, Riverside fell 84 places.\n\nIndiana University jumped 78 places over the same five-year period, the greatest gain of any university.\n\nOver the past five years private U.S. universities have seen institutional income rise by 24%. Private universities ranked in the top 200 that shot up at least 13 spots over the past year include: The University of Notre Dame (157), Boston University (61), Case Western Reserve University (119) and Tufts University (139).\n\nIn the category of institutional income per academic staff member, a measure of the level of financial resources at the disposal of an institution for academic purposes, Chinese universities are now better off than their U.S. counterparts.\n\n\u201cThe U.S.\u2019s historical dominance of higher education and research is waning, while China is rising,\u201d Mr. Baty said.\n\nTimes Higher Education\u2019s data supplier reviews millions of published research pages and citations to evaluate the schools. The magazine uses factors such as learning environment, research volume and international outlook to assess schools. The organization also surveyed thousands of academics.\n\nTimes Higher Education was sold in 2005 by News Corp , parent of The Wall Street Journal owner Dow Jones & Co. Times Higher Education has a business relationship with The Wall Street Journal to develop college rankings.\n\nWrite to Douglas Belkin at doug.belkin@wsj.com", "description": "The University of Oxford topped a list of the best universities in the world for the fourth straight year.
