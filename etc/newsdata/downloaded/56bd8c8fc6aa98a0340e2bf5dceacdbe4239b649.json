I didn\u2019t serve well,\u2019 said Murray.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Mentally, in a lot of the matches I\u2019ve played since I came back, when I\u2019ve gotten ahead, I haven\u2019t had that killer instinct. Before, when I got ahead, I felt like I played well from in front, whereas I haven\u2019t been doing that so much recently.\u2019\n\nMurray is on standby for a dash home to his pregnant wife Kim, who is expecting their third child in the coming weeks, and he was keen to pay tribute to her for the support she\u2019s provided during the toughest spell of his career.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s been a number of times in the last two years that I had stopped,\u2019 Murray told The Telegraph. \u2018I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t want to do this any more\u201d. But Kim, she was always trying to keep me going, and trying to help get me back on the court, stay motivated, and always happy for me to go and train and go away and stuff.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s times when you don\u2019t notice it as much, but now I\u2019m through the other side of it I realise at the time as well how difficult that is for everyone around you. Sometimes you\u2019re probably selfish and are thinking just about yourself, and \u201cGod I\u2019m in this much pain\u201d, but also there\u2019s a lot of people around you that are going through that as well and there\u2019s obviously lots of conversations that I\u2019m not part of that my family is having with my team and stuff.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFurther showering praise onto his wife, he continued: \u2018Through most of my career it\u2019s been like that, just very understanding of everything that I\u2019ve done, like going away for training blocks in Miami after a really long year and things like that.\n\nAndy Murray is happy with his recovery as a whole (Picture: AFP via Getty Images)\n\n\u2018It might not seem like much but we don\u2019t get to see each other all of the time and it does make a big difference when you don\u2019t have that, like, drama in your personal life and lots of things going on away from the court.\n\n\u2018She has been brilliant like that, allowed me to pursue my career and been unbelievably supportive of me doing that, so I\u2019ve been very lucky. I think my family are just happy seeing me back on the court pain free again. It\u2019s been an amazing few months, really.\u2019\n\nMurray will draw a close to his ATP season after this week at the European Open, although he is still expected to represent Great Britain at the Davis Cup next month, and ends a four-tournament stint feeling satisfied at how his hip is holding up.\n\nHe has, however, experienced some elbow pain and is keen to get some rest before the year\u2019s close.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Right now I feel happy, I have no issues with my hip and I\u2019m able to do what I have always done, maybe not quite to the level as what I did in my mid twenties but I\u2019m at a level where I\u2019m pretty competitive with most players,\u2019 said Murray.\n\n\u2018This is my fourth tournament in a row and the end of the season is coming at quite a good time for me, my elbow is a bit sore. I made some good progress in the past month but I need time to recover from that as well because there has been quite a big shift in load for me.\n\nAndy Murray will face Cuevas or Dellion next in Antwerp (Picture: AFP via Getty Images)\n\n\u2018I am still improving physically but my body does need to get used to playing matches. The most I have played is still three matches in a week. At this level you need to be playing five or six in a short space of time\u2019\n\nLooking ahead to the 2020 season, he added: \u2018I would rather give myself more breaks and play a lighter schedule. To be fair I don\u2019t think I overplayed much in my career, although I probably trained too much.\n\n\u2018I think over the last few months the body is starting to understand what it has to do again. It\u2019s easier psychologically than when you are younger because back then my whole life was based on whether I won tennis matches, you still get miserable when losing but it\u2019s not everything.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMurray will take on a South American next, with Uruguay\u2019s Pablo Cuevas taking on Bolivia\u2019s Hugo Dellion on Wednesday for the chance to take on the three-time Grand Slam champion and former world No. 1.\n\nMORE: Roger Federer announces plans to compete at Tokyo Olympics in 2020\n\nMORE: Nadal gains significant rankings boost from Djokovic as Medvedev passes Federer in London race", "description": "Andy Murray got off to a winning start in Antwerp but 'wasn't that happy' with his performance and hopes to rediscover his 'killer instinct', which he feels has been lacking since his return from hip surgery.", "authors": ["George Bellshaw"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1176014090_1571208815.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
