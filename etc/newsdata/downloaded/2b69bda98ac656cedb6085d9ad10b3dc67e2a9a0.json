It is aligned with CAG\u2019s vision to offer passengers a seamless omni-channel retail experience and new retail-tainment initiatives leveraging smart technologies,\u201d said CAG\u2019s executive vice president (commercial) Lim Peck Hoon.\n\n\u201cLotte also demonstrated a keen understanding of the market environment with a sound business plan supported by a competitive financial bid and backed up by solid business fundamentals.\u201d\n\nAn evaluation process for the tender closed on 26 August. CAG said the tender drew interest from top travel retailers with international operations and experience.\n\nThe tender was Changi Airport\u2019s most significant leasing exercise ever. The last round of tenders were conducted for the liquor and tobacco as well as the perfumes and cosmetics concessions in 2013.\n\n\u201cThe transition towards the start of the new concession will be planned carefully with both the incoming and outgoing tenants. Renovation works in the stores will be conducted in phases to ensure that customers continue to enjoy a high standard of service,\u201d said the CAG.\n\nRelated story:\n\nDFS job cuts expose Singapore\u2019s sensitivity as growth lags", "description": "SINGAPORE \u2014 Changi Airport Group (CAG) has awarded its liquor and tobacco concession tender to South Korean company Lotte Duty Free, which will start operations from 9 June next year.", "authors": ["Staff Writer", "Editorial Team"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/tPZ04jIlC7AtlkDrlWXxMg--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/d18f9110-f634-11e9-9ff4-8260c742a8b3", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
