REUTERS/Pavel Mikheyev\n\nThe group, which controls Kaspi Bank, the third largest bank in Kazakhstan where it is a leader in payment systems and e-commerce, said in September it planned to sell existing shares in the form of global depository receipts (GDRs).\n\nBut the group said on Monday it was postponing the listing because of \u201cunfavourable and uncertain market conditions, particularly in the technology sector\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve come to the decision that the timing is not the best at the current moment for an IPO,\u201d Mikheil Lomtadze, chairman of Kaspi.kz\u2019s management board, said in a statement.\n\nA source familiar with the matter the pulling of the IPO in serviced-office operator WeWork, backed by technology investor Softbank, did not offer an encouraging backdrop.\n\n\u201cThat had an impact on tech stocks last week, and investors are looking at tech stocks with a bit more circumspection as a result,\u201d the source said.\n\nIt has been a tough year for IPOs globally, and in Europe in particular where volumes are at their lowest in seven years, despite a recent rise in activity with offerings in Germany\u2019s TeamViewer, Sweden\u2019s EQT and France\u2019s Varallia.\n\nKaspi.kz would have been the first London listing since the summer. Market participants were watching it to see if uncertainty about the Oct. 31 deadline for Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union would deter deals.\n\nA second source familiar with the matter said of the Kaspi.kr cancellation that It was \u201cvery disappointing but I wouldn\u2019t blame Brexit or market volatility.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is obviously a disagreement on price. There were intensive discussions over the weekend between the global coordinators and the vendor, and the vendor decided they were not happy with the price,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother IPO hopeful, Africa\u2019s Helios Towers, is in the market for a London listing.\n\nShareholders who had planned to sell down stakes in Kaspi.kz\u2019s listing included Baring Vostok funds, Goldman Sachs, Kaspi.kz Chairman Vyacheslav Kim and Lomtadze.\n\nMorgan Stanley, UBS, Citigroup and Credit Suisse were acting as joint global coordinators on the offering, along with Renaissance Capital as joint bookrunner.", "description": "Kazakh financial group Kaspi.kz said on Monday it was postponing a London listing due to market conditions, reviving concerns about initial public offerings (IPOs) in Europe.", "authors": ["Simon Jessop", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1438028027&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF960MB", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
