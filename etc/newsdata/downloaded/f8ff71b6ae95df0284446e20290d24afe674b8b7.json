But its high winds, rain and tidal storm surge were still worsening a national catastrophe.\n\nThe eye of the storm was 45 miles north of Freeport, the nation\u2019s second-largest city, with maximum winds of 115 mph. It was grinding forward at 1 mph.\n\nMinnis said Tuesday that relief and rapid assessment teams were standing by to be deployed to Abaco and Grand Bahama as soon as possible.\n\nFears grew overnight that the initial toll of five confirmed dead and 21 injured announced by Minnis on Monday could grow substantially.\n\n\u201cI caution Bahamians everywhere that chances that we find more persons dead, those chances are real,\u201d Dames said Tuesday. \u201cI can\u2019t see any way out of it.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, U.S. Coast Guard helicopters evacuated the injured from the Marsh Harbour clinic on devastated Great Abaco to Nassau for urgent care. The British Royal Navy dispatched an auxiliary aid ship, the RFA Mounts Bay.\n\nThe U.S. Agency for International Development said Tuesday it had deployed a Disaster Assistance Response Team to work with local authorities, humanitarian organizations, the U.S. Coast Guard and the U.S. Embassy to assess damage, identify needs and deliver assistance. USAID said it had begun to mobilize plastic sheeting, hygiene kits, water buckets and chain saws.\n\n[\u2018Pray for us\u2019: Dorian snapping trees, tearing off roofs in the Bahamas]\n\nOn Monday, government officials warned that rescue efforts were being largely suspended until conditions improved. Larger-scale relief operations were being prepared for after the storm passes.\n\nBut responders were conducting targeted rescues. On the Facebook page of the prime minister\u2019s office, the government asked people stranded on Grand Bahama, home to Freeport, to send their GPS locations via WhatsApp.\n\n\u201cFreeport gospel chapel multipurpose building,\u201d one user posted.\n\n\u201cHi stuck by grand central 4way in plz send help holding on to a wall,\u201d posted another.\n\nDorian\u2019s eyewall, the most powerful part of the storm, spent 38 straight hours on Grand Bahama from Sunday evening to Tuesday morning, according to a review of radar imagery by The Post\u2019s Capital Weather Gang. That\u2019s equivalent to a strong tornado and a flash flood at the same time, lasting more than a day and a half.\n\nHealth Minister Duane Sands described the injured as \u201cchildren, adults, male, female.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome with very, very serious injuries,\u201d he said. \u201cSome requiring emergency neurosurgery, brain surgery. We\u2019ve had lacerations, partial amputations. We\u2019ve had a number of broken bones.\u201d\n\n[Bahamians prepare for Dorian; some evacuate ahead of hurricane\u2019s arrival]\n\nDorian hit the Bahamas on Sunday as a Category 5 hurricane. It tore off roofs and snapped trees in the Abaco islands, flooded towns and ripped up power lines.\n\nThe airport in Freeport was reduced to a river of rushing tidewaters.\n\nTidal surges were projected to reach up to 23 feet above normal, overwhelming low-lying cays and islands. Severe flooding and power and phone outages extended beyond the strike zone to as far south as Nassau, the capital.\n\nQueen Elizabeth, the head of state of the Bahamas, said Tuesday she was \u201cshocked and saddened to learn of the devastation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe send our sincere condolences to the families and friends of those who have lost their lives,\u201d she said in a statement. She expressed gratitude for the emergency services and volunteers supporting the rescue and recovery.\n\nFaiola reported from Miami.
