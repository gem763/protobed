Investors will be looking for positive free cash flow, a forecast for profit or any signs that Tesla is on a path to profitability, or at least that demand is still strong for Tesla\u2019s cars.\n\nAfter Tesla announced its third-quarter delivery total, formerly bullish JMP Group analysts downgraded the stock to \u201chold\u201d and said it was \u201cthe first time since covering the stock that we found ourselves wondering whether demand growth for (Tesla\u2019s) cars might be leveling off.\u201d\n\nChief Executive Elon Musk will attempt to counter that notion while attempting to get production started in China and prepping for the launch of the Model Y. An RBC analyst believes Tesla might move up that mid-SUV \u2014 which is expected to start production late next year \u2014 to help jolt growth.\n\nFull preview: Tesla is about to show investors if it\u2019s back on the road to profitability\n\nBoeing BA, -6.79% , which was the biggest contributor to the S&P 500\u2019s earnings decline in the second quarter, will have to answer questions about reports on Friday saying it misled regulators about 737 Max safety long before two deadly crashes. While Boeing is expected to be back in the black this time around, it hasn\u2019t escaped the Max controversy: The aircraft manufacturer is expected to report a 40% drop in profit and a 22% decline in sales.\n\nHere are other key themes to watch for in the week ahead.\n\nTech titans\n\nTwo tech stalwarts of the Dow are set to report next week: Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -1.63% on Wednesday and Intel Corp. INTC, -0.96% on Thursday.\n\nMicrosoft is expected to ride the wave of its Azure cloud-computing business to another big quarter of growth. Analysts model 11% overall growth for the company, led by a 22% increase in the intelligent cloud segment. Intel\u2019s report will show how customers are dealing with the potential for tariffs to affect PCs in December and whether they\u2019ve been moving up orders to get ahead of that deadline. Such a move could impact Intel in a number of ways, according to Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi, who\u2019s interested to learn if supply constraints have returned and whether the company will issue a conservative forecast for the holiday quarter.\n\nRounding out the Dow\n\nCaterpillar Inc.\u2019s CAT, -0.25% Wednesday morning report will give a glimpse into what William Blair analyst Lawrence De Maria calls a \u201cplummeting\u201d market for construction equipment in North America. \u201cIt is one of the first capital-goods companies to report, and as a bellwether, the company typically sets the tone for the season, which is unlikely to be positive,\u201d he wrote.\n\nCaterpillar earnings: Expect weakness on China tensions and global economic slowdown\n\nA more aggressive promotional landscape likely helped Verizon Communications Inc. VZ, +1.06% report a big quarter of new subscribers, according to Guggenheim\u2019s Mike McCormack, who models 387,000 phone additions. The company posts results on Friday morning.\n\nOther Dow components on the docket for the week are Travelers Cos. Inc. TRV, +0.63%, United Technologies Corp. UTX, -0.99%, Procter & Gamble Co. PG, +0.72%, and McDonald\u2019s Corp. MCD, +0.80%, which all report on Tuesday. Dow Inc. DOW, +0.31%, Visa Inc. V, -1.25%, and 3M Co. MMM, -0.27% are set to deliver results on Thursday.\n\nLooking to the holidays\n\nHoliday-season forecasts will be big areas of focus for eBay Inc. EBAY, -0.69% and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -1.68%, the two e-commerce giants on this week\u2019s slate. For Amazon, a crucial question is how the company\u2019s push for free one-day shipping will affect operating profits heading into the crucial quarter. EBay will be looking to show that everything is under control after the company\u2019s chief executive stepped down a month ago amid a disagreement with the company\u2019s board.\n\nFor more: EBay CEO leaves amid activist fight to spin off ... wait, haven\u2019t we already done this?\n\nEBay is in the process of reviewing its business units amid pressure from activists who want the company to spin off non-core segments like Classifieds and StubHub.\n\n\u201cWe expect to hear more details on the outcome of the operating review at earnings, as eBay noted in March it intends to announce the findings and targets from the review at an event in the fall,\u201d Wedbush analyst Ygal Arounian wrote in an earnings preview.\n\nEBay is on the docket for Wednesday afternoon, while Amazon follows a day later. United Parcel Services Inc.\u2019s UPS, -0.88% Tuesday morning report could also provide a window into what to expect for holiday shipments.\n\nSocial standing\n\nSnap Inc. SNAP, -1.89% will look to keep its streak of user growth alive on Tuesday afternoon, this time relying on upgrades to its Android app, rather than the popular \u201cage filters\u201d that drove a bulk of Snap\u2019s user additions three months back. Analysts expect the company to sport its third-straight quarter of daily-active-user growth\u2014even if it likely won\u2019t be at the level of the 13 million new users Snap picked up last time around.\n\nSnap earnings: Riding the Android redesign to grow its user base\n\nUser growth is expected to come down for Twitter TWTR, -1.57% as well, while still remaining in positive territory. The consensus forecast models about 3 million new monetizable daily active users for the quarter, compared with 5 million three months back. The key questions for Twitter on Thursday morning are whether the company\u2019s desktop-site changes are helping users better find content that interests them and whether new ad products are still showing traction with advertisers.\n\nSee also: Chipotle earnings\u2014Avocado prices are moderating and sales of carne asada are strong", "description": "Prepare for an earnings onslaught in the week ahead, headlined by Tesla Inc., Boeing Co. and a flurry of big tech names.", "authors": ["Emily Bary"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HC905_tesla0_ZG_20190129130423.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
