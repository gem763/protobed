REUTERS/Thomas Peter\n\nTheir city has been gripped by months of anti-government protests, and their company is feeling the wrath of China\u2019s aviation regulator after some staff members took part or expressed support.\n\nSince an Aug.9 directive by the Civil Aviation Authority of China (CAAC) that called for the suspension of staff who supported or participated in the demonstrations, the regulator has rejected some entire crew lists without explanation, two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\n\nThe rejections have forced Cathay to scramble, pulling pilots and flight attendants off standby while it investigates social media accounts in an effort to determine which crew member has been deemed a security threat, one of the sources said.\n\nOther disruptions have come in the form of a huge jump in the number of plane inspections upon landing, four pilots said.\n\nThe flexing of regulatory muscle has contributed to a climate of fear within the airline, with employees telling Reuters they felt Cathay\u2019s longer-term future as an independent company was highly uncertain and subject to Beijing\u2019s whims.\n\nThe CAAC\u2019s labelling of employees who support the protest as a security risk and its demand that they be suspended from flying over mainland airspace has been a de facto career killer.\n\nAround three quarters of Cathay flights use mainland airspace and due to the directive, 30 rank-and-file staff, including eight pilots and 18 flight attendants, have been fired or resigned under pressure, according to the Hong Kong Cabin Crew Federation.\n\nCathay CEO Rupert Hogg and his top deputy also resigned in August amid the mounting regulatory scrutiny on the 73-year-old airline, one of the region\u2019s most high-profile brands that draws on Hong Kong\u2019s British heritage.\n\n\u201cThings changed very quickly,\u201d said Jeremy Tam, a pro-democracy lawmaker and pilot who resigned from the airline after the CAAC directive, likening the atmosphere to a political trial. \u201cThe threat is huge and it\u2019s almost like zero to 100 in two seconds.\u201d\n\nReuters talked to 14 current and former employees for this article. Nearly all declined to be identified for fear of being fired or due to the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nThe CAAC did not respond Reuters requests for comment on the rejections of crew lists or the increase in plane checks.Cathay said in a statement it must comply with all regulatory requirements. \u201cQuite simply, this is our licence to operate; there is no ground for compromise,\u201d it said.\n\nThe airline declined to comment on the number of employee departures, but said any terminations took into account factors such as a person\u2019s ability to perform their role.\n\nDEMERIT SYSTEM\n\nAviation regulators around the world conduct occasional plane inspections at airports to ensure an airline is in compliance with safety regulations.\n\nBut after the CAAC\u2019s Aug. 9 directive, the once-infrequent inspections occurred almost daily and included the new and unusual step of checking phones owned by crew for anti-China photos and messages, the pilots said, adding that this had led to flight delays.\n\nThe step-up in checks has increased the likelihood of regulators finding minor issues to write up, which pilots said had included dirt on the plane\u2019s exterior and scratches on a fire extinguisher.\n\nInfractions can have outsized consequences under the CAAC\u2019s strict demerit points system, they said, noting the regulator could force Cathay to reduce its number of flights, cut destinations or in a worst-case scenario, revoke the airline\u2019s right to fly to mainland China.\n\nManagement has urged staff to do their utmost to avoid infractions.\n\n\u201cIt is nothing less than the survival of the airline at stake,\u201d said a senior employee. \u201cManagement have made that abundantly clear at meetings.\u201d\n\nExecutives are particularly sensitive after seven incidents outside mainland China in the past two months in which pre-flight checks found emergency oxygen bottles for crew were depleted.\n\nThe CAAC is more public than many regulatory peers about disclosing safety violations, warnings and punishments.\n\nIn 2017, Emirates was banned from expanding its operations for six months following two safety incidents, while flag carrier Air China Ltd was ordered last year to cut Boeing Co 737 flights by 10% after a emergency descent linked to a pilot smoking an e-cigarette in the cockpit.\n\nCathay declined to provide information on its points under the CAAC system but said it wanted to emphasise that there had been no impact on its flight services into mainland China.\n\nThe pilots said the high frequency of airplane checks, which one described as \u201cvery intimidatory\u201d, was starting to recede.\n\nA THOUSAND CUTS\n\nEmployees are also feeling pressure from other regulatory bodies.\n\nLast week, ahead of China\u2019s National Day on Oct.1, immigration officers at some mainland airports requested photos of crew with the Chinese flag, said a pilot at regional arm Cathay Dragon who flies to the mainland regularly.\n\nHe said to his knowledge, most pilots - many of whom are expats from Western countries - had refused but Hong Kong cabin crew were \u201ctoo nervous to say no\u201d given the scrutiny on their actions by the company and the Chinese government.\n\n\u201cEveryone is walking on eggshells in China,\u201d the pilot said.\n\nCathay did not respond to a request for comment, while China\u2019s Ministry of Public Security, which oversees immigration, did not respond to a request for comment during a week of public holidays.\n\nThere has been no let-up in the widespread, sometimes violent, unrest that has beset Hong Kong. Triggered by a now-withdrawn extradition bill, it has morphed into an outpouring of opposition to the former British colony\u2019s Beijing-backed government.\n\nThe crisis has also meant a sharp drop in travel demand to Hong Kong, putting more pressure on Cathay.\n\nCathay\u2019s overall passenger numbers were down 11.3% in August. Flights at Cathay Dragon, which does most of Cathay\u2019s mainland flying, were on average 60-65% full in September, down from the usual 80%, according to estimates from two pilots.\n\nThe pilots said while the sharp drop in demand was in some ways similar in scale to that weathered by Cathay during the SARS epidemic and the global financial crisis, there were key differences that felt more threatening to the company\u2019s future.\n\nSome state-controlled firms such as China CITIC Bank International and Huarong International have told employees to avoid flying with Cathay, and it has been attacked by Chinese state news organisations as well as by many mainland consumers on social media.\n\nCAAC\u2019s Aug.9 statement which called staff who supported the protests a security risk has also put Cathay\u2019s reputation as one of the world\u2019s safest airlines under a cloud it does not deserve, employees said.\n\nPeople take part in a students' march on the campus of the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) in solidarity with the student protester who was shot by a police officer on October 1, the CUHK students who were arrested in anti-government protests, and the pro-democracy movement, in Sha Tin, Hong Kong, China, October 3, 2019. REUTERS/Susana Vera\n\nMany acknowledged the new management team, which oversees around 33,000 employees, has few palatable options in dealing with the situation given the sway Beijing holds over the airline\u2019s operations.\n\nBut they lamented the loss of freedom of speech and sense of job security, saying employees are afraid to speak about anything even vaguely political or voice support for protests on social media for fear of being reported by colleagues under a whistleblower policy.\n\n\u201cIt has become a Hong Kong company with mainland employment terms,\u201d a pilot at Cathay Dragon said. \u201cThe risk is death by a thousand cuts.\u201d", "description": "Staff at Cathay Pacific Airways, Hong Kong's flagship airline, are on edge.", "authors": ["Jamie Freed", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436562188&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF920HJ"}
