She was welcomed with singing from staff and a bunch of flowers, a hug and drawings from young girls.\n\nAt ActionAid she discussed violence against women and girls with representatives from various organisations and then visited a local school to meet girls aged between 12 and 16.\n\n\n\n\n\n'PHARMACY-IN-A-BOX'\n\nWhile Meghan and Archie have stayed in South Africa, Harry has also visited Botswana, Angola and finally Malawi, where on Tuesday he visited the Mauwa Health Centre.\n\nCrowds gathered outside the remote clinic, which serves 23,000 people, hoping to catch a glimpse of Harry as he met Health Minister Jappie Mhango, local officials and aid workers.\n\nOn a tour of the clinic, he was shown its 'pharmacy-in-a-box' - a low-cost, solar-powered, air-conditioned storage facility for medicines.\n\nEmmanuel Moses, the officer in charge of the health centre, said shortages of drugs had previously meant the clinic had to refer even minor cases elsewhere, but with the pharmacy it could now do much more to help.\n\nThe pharmacy, funded by the British and U.S. governments, is one of 353 across Malawi that health workers say have reduced theft and wastage of medicines.\n\nHarry, who is sixth in line to the British throne and has been visiting southern Africa for two decades for holidays and conservation work, will rejoin his family in Johannesburg on Tuesday evening.\n\nOn Wednesday the couple will tour a township and meet Nelson Mandela's widow, Graca Machel. They will also attend a business reception and meet President Cyril Ramaphosa before flying back to London on Wednesday evening.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Emma Rumney in JOHANNESBURG and Frank Phiri in MAUWA; Editing by Gareth Jones)", "description": "JOHANNESBURG/MAUWA, Malawi (Reuters) - Meghan, wife of Britain's Prince Harry, said on Tuesday that empowering women through education could be transformational for communities during a visit to Johannesburg University in South Africa.
