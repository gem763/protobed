From the \u201cDeclaration on Euthanasia and Physician-Assisted Suicide:\u201d\n\nThe WMA reiterates its strong commitment to the principles of medical ethics and that utmost respect has to be maintained for human life. Therefore, the WMA is firmly opposed to euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide.\n\nThe WMA also supports medical conscience rights to refuse all complicity and participation in killing patients in jurisdictions where it is legal \u2014 contrary to advocacy among prominent bioethicists and a pernicious court ruling in Ontario, Canada:\n\nNo physician should be forced to participate in euthanasia or assisted suicide, nor should any physician be obliged to make referral decisions to this end.\n\nOne of the crucial roles of professional associations is to maintain strong ethical boundaries. Hopefully, the WMA\u2019s unequivocal stand will encourage other medical/nursing professional organizations to withstand the increasing pressure from George Soros-funded activists to abandon their sick patients to the lethal jab and prescription.", "description": "One of the crucial roles of professional associations is to maintain strong ethical boundaries.", "authors": ["Wesley J.
