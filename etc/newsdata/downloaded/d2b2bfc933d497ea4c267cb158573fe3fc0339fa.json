We\u2019re a laughing stock abroad\u2019\n\nIn the foothills of the Pennines, the market town of Ramsbottom was busy with afternoon shoppers when news broke of a looming general election. Teacups clattered, eyes rolled and heads shook wearily in a town that voted 53% for leave in June 2016.\n\n\u201cMy brother lives in Germany and they think England is a total joke. We\u2019re a laughing stock abroad,\u201d said Deb Metcalf, 52, after the lunchtime rush in the town\u2019s bakery. Metcalf said she was fed up that Brexit had not been delivered and that some \u2013 including this area\u2019s Labour MP, James Frith \u2013 were arguing for a second referendum. \u201cIt would be a massive slap in the country\u2019s face. I know a lot of people are peed off with him because he\u2019s gone against everyone\u2019s wishes.\u201d\n\nIn Alternative Arrangements, a flower shop down the road, 72-year-old Anne said Brexit was \u201cmaking people depressed\u201d and that a pre-Christmas poll would drive people up the wall. \u201cIn eight months\u2019 time this will have taken as long as the first world war \u2013 that was on for four years and three months,\u201d she said, clutching her shopping bags. \u201cIt\u2019s quite frankly doing my head in.\u201d\n\nIt is leave-voting Labour seats like Bury North that will be high on the Tories\u2019 target list in the coming weeks. In a marginal seat that has swapped from blue to red twice in its 35-year history, Frith was elected two years ago with a majority of 4,375. Speaking after Labour\u2019s backing for an election on Tuesday, Frith acknowledged it was not \u201ctop of everyone\u2019s Christmas list\u201d but that voters understood the parliamentary deadlock and that a national poll was \u201cinevitable, sooner or later\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Olchon Lang in his gallery; he believes voter turnout will be poor in a winter poll.

Possibly it will sway the electorate to the young people.\u201d\n\nNonsense, said Elizabeth Benson, 69, and her husband Alan, 79. \u201cBring it on \u2013 that\u2019s what I think. We will be voting for the Tories and we want out,\u201d said Elizabeth. \u201cIt\u2019s a disaster but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s Boris\u2019s fault \u2013 it\u2019s parliament. Whatever he tries to do they\u2019re stopping him.\u201d\n\nJosh Halliday\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jamie Bourn: \u2018I voted remain, but I think it\u2019s time to leave\u2019. Photograph: James Drew Turner/The Guardian\n\nChingford: \u2018We\u2019ll carry on going around in circles without an election\u2019\n\nFor 33-year-old Jamie Bourn, who works in a homewares shop in Chingford, north-east London, an election can\u2019t come quickly enough. \u201cI think we\u2019ll just carry on going around in circles like we are now if we don\u2019t have an election,\u201d he said on Tuesday afternoon, following the announcement that Labour would back a pre-Christmas poll.\n\n\u201cI voted remain \u2013 I thought we were getting along nicely in the EU \u2013 but I think it\u2019s time to leave. That\u2019s what everyone voted for. It\u2019s not something I agree with, but it was a decision made by the majority of the public.\u201d\n\nHomes and Gardens, a few minutes from Chingford station, has seen a few heated debates about Brexit over the past three years, says Bourn, \u201cbut that hasn\u2019t happened so much lately because people are fed up with it\u201d.\n\nThe store is in the parliamentary constituency of Chingford and Woodford Green, which has been represented by the former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith since 1992. It voted 50.1% to 49.9% to remain in the EU referendum and is relatively marginal. (Duncan Smith\u2019s majority fell from 8,400 to 2,400 in the 2017 election.)\n\nBourn would probably vote Conservative in the forthcoming vote. \u201cIf I had to pick between Boris and Jeremy, it would definitely be Boris,\u201d he said. \u201cI won\u2019t go into it too much, but some of the things [Corbyn] says and does don\u2019t sit right with me.\u201d\n\nThe opposition candidate in the seat is the economist Faiza Shaheen, who is seen as a rising star of the Labour left. Belinda Buckley, a speech and language therapist, said she would vote Labour, though she thought the party had failed to take a clear line on Brexit. \u201cPeople are saying this is the time when [Duncan Smith] is most likely to be ousted. Great. Good riddance,\u201d she said.\n\nOverall, as a remain voter, Buckley is disheartened. \u201cI think it\u2019s extremely clever what [the Conservatives] are doing and I think Labour and the Lib Dems are so behind on being able to put forward a coherent argument that actually connects with people.\u201d\n\nMortgage broker Dee Safer, 46, said that the uncertainty caused by the present situation had had a big impact on his business. \u201cI just want [Brexit] done and out of the way,\u201d he said.\n\nSafer, who voted leave in the EU referendum, didn\u2019t have strong opinions about Duncan Smith \u2013 \u201cHe\u2019s all right. He came in and wanted to use my loo once\u201d \u2013 but said he would back the Conservatives in the election, and expected them to win.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d very surprised if they were calling a general election and weren\u2019t confident they were going to win,\u201d he said. \u201cThis area is full of old Tories, so I can\u2019t see Labour winning here.\u201d\n\nMary Jenkins, 87 \u2013 another Tory supporter who voted to leave the EU \u2013 said the debate around Brexit had been dragging on too long. \u201cIn the end it gets boring,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has taken up a lot of my time because I live on my own and I put the TV on to see what\u2019s on the news and you get hypnotised by it.\u201d\n\nHer message to politicians: \u201cGet on with it before I kick the bucket.\u201d\n\nFrances Perraudin", "description": "Voters in Labour seat of Bury North and Tory seat of Chingford split over merits of pre-Christmas poll", "authors": ["Josh Halliday", "Frances Perraudin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0aeba6b3445afc78a3334d297a66cdbb41bb7c56/0_223_6720_4035/master/6720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=842291e848350ef035baaa3fb72180e4", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
