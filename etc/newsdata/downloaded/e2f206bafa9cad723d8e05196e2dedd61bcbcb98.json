The flash drop remained unexplained and was all the more striking given the Bitcoin network\u2019s record-breaking string of new all-time high hash rates throughout the summer.\n\nJust days before, Cointelegraph had reported that Bitcoin\u2019s hash rate had passed a record 102 quintillion hashes in a historic milestone.\n\nA higher hash rate means greater competition among miners to validate new blocks. It also increases the number of resources needed for performing a 51% attack, making the network more secure.\n\nBitcoin Cash makes massive gains today\n\nIn sync with Bitcoin\u2019s sudden price boost yesterday, altcoin markets also entered the green zone, with BCH recording a massive gain of more than 15% on the day as of press time.", "description": "A Redditor spotted a Bitcoin Cash miner that apparently now controls more than 50% of its hash rate and asks to de-list BCH", "authors": ["Joeri Cant"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy9hMmNjZGM3NjliYmJmNDc0MGI3MWNlYTNlZjQ0YTk2Mi5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
