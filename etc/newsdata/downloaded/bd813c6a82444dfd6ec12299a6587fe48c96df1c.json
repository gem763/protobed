(Steve Marcus/Reuters)\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Joe Biden\u2019s campaign was quick to condemn President Trump\u2019s Thursday claim that China should investigate the Biden family\u2019s business dealings, saying the administration is now spiraling.\n\n\u201cNow, with his administration in free-fall, Donald Trump is flailing and melting down on national television, desperately clutching for conspiracy theories that have been debunked and dismissed by independent, credible news organizations,\u201d Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager and communications director, Kate Bedingfield said.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump doubled down on his claim that Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, engaged in \u201ccrooked\u201d business dealings with Ukraine and China.\n\n\u201cI would think that if they were honest about it they\u2019d start a major investigation into the Bidens,\u201d Trump told a gaggle of reporters at the White House when asked if Ukraine should look into the allegations of corruption.\n\nDuring a July 25 phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump asked Zelensky to help his administration investigate allegations that the former vice president used his position to help Ukrainian natural-gas company Burisma Holdings avoid a corruption probe soon after his son was appointed to its board of directors.\n\nThe accusation that Trump withheld military aid from Ukraine pending the country\u2019s investigation into the Bidens has become a focal point in House Democrats\u2019 formal impeachment inquiry.\n\nTrump also accused Hunter Biden on Thursday of flying on Air Force Two in 2013 with his father, then the vice president, in order to obtain $1.5 billion from China for his private equity fund.\n\n\u201cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens,\u201d Trump added. \u201cHe got kicked out of the Navy. All of the sudden he\u2019s getting billions of dollars. You know what they call that? They call that a payoff.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs Joe Biden forcefully said last night, the defining characteristic of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency is the ongoing abuse of power,\u201d Bedingfield said in response to the president\u2019s claim. \u201cWhat Donald Trump just said on the South Lawn of the White House was this election\u2019s equivalent of his infamous \u2018Russia, if you\u2019re listening\u2019 moment from 2016 \u2014 a grotesque choice of lies over truth and self over the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt could not be more transparent: Donald Trump is terrified that Joe Biden will beat him like a drum,\u201d she concluded.\n\nTrump made a remark during the 2016 campaign that he said was meant as a joke, appealing to Russia to locate his opponent Hillary Clinton\u2019s tens of thousands of emails from her controversial private server.\n\n\u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,\u201d Trump said at the time. \u201cI think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.\u201d", "description": "Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's campaign was quick to condemn President Trump's Thursday claim that China should investigate the Biden family's business dealings, saying the administration is now spiraling.", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle", "Andrew C.
