Our calendars are full of diwali parties and other social commitments, shopping trips and just spending quality time with friends. All of that is okay, but Diwali in my childhood (and I bet yours too) was something entirely different, compared to how it is celebrated now. Earlier, it was the coming together of families, spreading happiness, eating lots of mithai and bursting crackers, in whatever limited means we had. Clearly, I miss the simpler times. Now, the focus is on aimlessly spending money on gifts and parties.\n\nAnd since my nostalgia is so deeply tied to Diwali, I decided to list down some of the most beautiful Diwali memories that are etched in my heart and playing on my mind. One thing is for sure, these are all things you will relate to!\n\n1. Instead of domestic help, staff and cleaning companies, mom would get the entire family to start cleaning the house 15 days prior to Diwali.\n\nReddit\n\n2. The time when the entire family would go shopping together and every family member would get one new outfit each!\n\nUnsplash\n\n3. And we would wake up super early in the morning on Diwali, take a bath, wear our new outfit and run around the house showing it to everyone!\n\nInstagram\n\nDon't Miss 3.8 K SHARES 7.3 K SHARES 159 SHARES 1.6 K SHARES 105 SHARES\n\n4. Our parents would try to feed us dry fruits, but we'd only eat ladoos and kaju katli.\n\nPexels\n\n5. It was super fascinating to see mumma make rangoli, and we would protect her intricate design, making sure no one walked over it.\n\nPexels\n\n6. All of us brothers and sisters, would run around the house switching on all the lights in every room, lighting diyas all around and decorating the house with flowers.\n\nUnsplash\n\n7. Then in the evening, daddy would drive us to buy crackers!\n\nPexels\n\n8. It was fun to attempt to draw our names with a phuljhadi.\n\nPexels\n\n9. Or dance around the chakri.\n\nPexels\n\n10. And enjoy how beautiful an anar looked!\n\nPexels\n\n11. Finally, going off to sleep, counting down days for when Diwali would come next.\n\nPexels", "description": "Diwali for us is bigger and grander now.
