Any impact on production by the short walk-off was likely to be recuperated in subsequent days, the union told Reuters.\n\nCopper producer Antofagasta Plc said on Wednesday protests in Chile could cut its production by about 5,000 tonnes, equivalent to less than 3% of third quarter output, due to delays in supplies and travel disruptions for workers.\n\nAnglo American said its flagship Los Bronces mine, just outside Santiago, had been forced to \u201cadjust operations\u201d given the unrest and disruptions to the country\u00b4s transport networks, but said the mine continued to operate normally.\n\nTeck told Reuters in a statement that \u201cthere had been no material impact to Teck\u00b4s operations in Chile due to recent protests.\u201d\n\nThe International Copper Study Group (ICSG) said on Wednesday the copper market would see a surplus of 281,000 tonnes in 2020.\n\n\u201cTaking into account such forecasts, the strike in Chile is unlikely to have any significant effect on the copper market,\u201d said Anton Berlin, head of marketing at Russia\u2019s Norilsk Nickel.\n\nBut Jimena Blanco, Head of Latin America research at consultancy Verisk Maplecroft, said it was \u201ca matter of time\u201d before the knock-on effects along the supply chain had a negative impact on the mining industry.\n\n\u201cFor example, yesterday\u2019s strike by the port workers\u2019 union affected 20 of the country\u2019s maritime facilities, including key mining export ones in Antofagasta and Iquique,\u201d she said.", "description": "Chile's Codelco, the world's top copper miner, said it had resumed normal operations after its unionized workers struck a deal with government officials late Wednesday to end a day-long walk-off amid a week of raucous protests throughout Chile.", "authors": ["Fabian Cambero", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
