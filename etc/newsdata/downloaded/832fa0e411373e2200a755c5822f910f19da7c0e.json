Go, enjoy it, it's an absolutely fantastic place. We've got a team that's worth supporting and celebrating so there's plenty of things to go and enjoy.\n\n'Just don't embarrass yourself or anyone else by drinking to excess and behaving in a way where you will see yourself on film or in print the next day.'\n\nHe added: 'When we have a drunken group who behave poorly, that affects the way police regard all England fans.\n\n'We have had incidents where thoroughly decent England fans who are just there to see the match have been subject to some fairly robust policing.\n\n'In Portugal, some fans just queuing to get in were batoned and that's probably out of the frustration local police build up when they see people behaving in a drunken and anti-social manner.\n\n'And it's no guarantee the people who caused the problems are the ones who are going to suffer for their actions.'", "description": "Almost 3,800 Three Lions fans have bought tickets for Friday night's Euro 2020 qualifier against the Czech Republic, with more expected to travel.
