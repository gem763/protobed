She had entered Botham Jean's apartment last year thinking it was her own and shot the man twice.\n\nAfter sentencing, Judge Kemp, a devout Christian, left the courtroom and came back with a copy of the Bible. She presented the Bible to the convicted murderer. Click here to watch the video.\n\n\"You can have [my Bible]. I have three or four more at home. This is the one I use every day. This is your job for the next month. Right here. John: 3:16. And this is where you start, \"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life,\" the judge told the former police officer.\n\n\u201cHe has a purpose for you. This will strengthen you. You just need a tiny mustard seed of faith. You start with this,\" she continued.\n\nAnd then the convicted killer and the judge embraced.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not because I\u2019m good. It\u2019s because I believe in Christ. I\u2019m not so good. You haven\u2019t done as much as you think you have, and you can be forgiven. You did something bad in one moment in time. What you do now matters.\u201d\n\nIt was a quite extraordinary moment.\n\nBut the Freedom From Religion Foundation filed a formal complaint with the Texas State Commission on Judicial Conduct alleging Judge Kemp violated the law.\n\n\u201cIt violates the constitutional separation between state and church for a sitting judge to promote personal religious beliefs while acting in her official capacity,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cShe was in a government courtroom, dressed in a judicial robe, with all of the imprimatur of the state, including armed law enforcement officers, preaching to someone who was quite literally a captive audience. Delivering Bibles, Bible studies and personal witness as a judge is an abuse of power.\u201d\n\nFirst Liberty Institute, a law firm that specializes in religious liberty cases, condemned the Freedom From Religion Foundation's cold-hearted hate.\n\n\u201cFFRF is protesting Judge Kemp rather than joining the rest of the nation celebrating the compassion and mercy Judge Kemp demonstrated,\" First Liberty's Hiram Sasser told Starnes Media. \"We should all be thankful the law allows Judge Kemp\u2019s actions and we stand with her and will gladly lead the charge in defending her noble and legal actions.\u201d\n\nJudge Kemp demonstrated to the nation that while actions have consequences, there is also a path to redemption.\n\nJudge Kemp was blessed with the wisdom of Solomon. She applied the rule of law and afterwards, she administered grace and compassion.\n\nWe could use a heckuva lot more of that in America these days.", "description": "The Freedom From Religion Foundation is on the war path .10/07/2019 15:53:25PM EST.", "authors": ["Todd Starnes", "Guy Benson", "Cortney O'Brien", "Julio Rosas", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/57/a7a051b8-13bf-4f28-8bb1-ec7f87342a40.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
