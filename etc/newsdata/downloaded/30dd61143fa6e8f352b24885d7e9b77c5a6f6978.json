I mean be kind to everyone. Doesn't matter.\"\n\nOn Instagram, Witherspoon replied with the word \"Exactly\" accompanied by a bullseye emoji. Foxx said: \"Thank uuu very much for that!!!! Soooo needed and Necessary.\" Garner chimed in with: \"Ellen! You are amazing! \u2665\ufe0f\"\n\nSinger Lenny Kravitz offered: \"Let Love Rule!\", Kendall Jenner contributed a flurry of exclamation marks and love heart emojis, and actress Kristen Bell added her voice.\n\nBell's The Good Place co-star Jameela Jamil also praised the talk show host for her \"incredibly strong\" handling of the controversy.\n\nBut the British actress then rowed back after being bombarded by comments from critics of the former president.\n\nIt was pointed out by some Twitter users that she was 23 when he left office - but she explained that she had been though so much that she hadn't been aware of many things that went on at the time.\n\n\"I'm really lucky that as young as 28 I even had a chance to get my mental health back and have some time and space in my life to be able to start learning, and it's been a journey,\" she said in a video.\n\n\"I'm way behind and I'm not embarrassed of that, and you can't make me feel ashamed of it, because I'm actually trying.\"\n\nDeGeneres said she and her wife Portia had been invited to watch the Dallas Cowboys play the Green Bay Packers on Sunday by Cowboys executive vice president Charlotte Jones.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
