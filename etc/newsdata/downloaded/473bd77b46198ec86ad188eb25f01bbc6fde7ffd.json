So having these long fibers, the cells attach to the fibers and they form protein junctions, and then they grow along the length of the fiber.'\n\nWhile the method had brought researchers closer to creating a lab-grown meat that convincingly parrots its organic counterpart, there are still many hurdles before it ends up on consumers' dinner plates.\n\nResearchers hope to use the technique to replicate different meat like prosciutto (pictured above) and have reported success in testing the lab-grown tissue against the real thing\n\nAmong them, are the cost of producing the meat which relies on animal serums that promote cell growth which are difficult to manufacture.\n\nAdditionally, researchers have not been able to actually consume the meat that they grow in the lab due to safety concerns.\n\nRegardless of the obvious hurdles between researchers and mass production of lab-grown meat using the method, they say incremental progress like there's could help ultimately ween reliance on animal farming and reduce humans' environmental footprint.\n\n'Moving forward, the goals are nutritional content, taste, texture, and affordable pricing. The long-range goal is reducing the environmental footprint of food,' said Parker.", "description": "Much like its cotton candy-creating kin, the machine spins at high speeds - 30,000 rotations per minute - to create a type of gelatin scaffold  on which animal cells can grow and become a type of tissue.", "authors": ["James Pero For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/20/20052534-0-image-a-14_1571774384035.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
