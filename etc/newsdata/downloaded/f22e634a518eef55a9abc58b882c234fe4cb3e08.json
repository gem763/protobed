Multiple witnesses can corroborate that,\" he wrote on Facebook.\n\n\"I am and will always strive to be a true ambassador to this beautiful rainbow nation and the sport that I love.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the \"Langebaan Four\" and their legal representation are considering a civil suit against Etzebeth while the South African Police Service are looking into an attempted murder charge, according the SAHRC.\n\nAccording to Jones, community members claim Etzebeth and his friends, who call themselves the \"wolf gang pack,\" \"'terrorize\" communities along the west coast.\n\nSA Rugby has vowed to cooperate fully with investigations and promised to \"take appropriate action once the legal investigation and process have concluded\".\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "South Africa's rights watchdog on Friday filed legal papers against Springboks World Cup star Eben Etzebeth who has been accused of racial abuse and assault.
