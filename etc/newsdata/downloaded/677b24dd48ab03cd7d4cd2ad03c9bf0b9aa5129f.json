Captain David Traill's failure to follow the procedure set down in the pilot's checklist was 'inexplicable' a fatal accident inquiry found\n\nThe inquiry concluded the crash happened after the helicopter's engines flamed out sequentially while it was airborne, as a result of fuel starvation due to depletion of the contents of the supply tank.\n\nThe accident was caused by Captain Traill's failure to ensure that at least one of the fuel transfer pump switches was set to on, the inquiry found.\n\nIn his determination, Sheriff Principal Craig Turnbull said the central issue was why the pilot allowed the supply tanks to deplete to the point that they did when there was more than sufficient usable fuel available to him in the main tank to allow the helicopter to return to its base.\n\nPhoto shows helicopter G-SPAO on 1 December 2013 - SPA image taken on the roof of the Clutha Vaults Bar in Glasgow on 1 December 2013. 10 people died when the Police helicopter crashed into a crowded bar in the city centre\n\nThe report found both the fuel transfer pump switches were in the off position when the low fuel warnings were triggered.\n\nIt said that had one or both of them been switched back on by Captain Traill at that point in time, the helicopter would not have crashed - however they were left off.\n\nMr Turnbull's determination found there was enough time between the first and second engine flame-outs for Captain Traill to have switched on the fuel transfer pumps.\n\nThe pilot and two crew members on the helicopter, Pc Tony Collins, 43, and Pc Kirsty Nelis, 36, were killed along with seven customers in the Clutha bar - Gary Arthur, 48, Joe Cusker, 59, Colin Gibson, 33, Robert Jenkins, 61, John McGarrigle, 58, Samuel McGhee, 56, and Mark O'Prey, 44\n\nTop row: Helicopter pilot David Trail with police officers Kirsty Nelis and Tony Collins.
