That is why I am seeking a General Election in December,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cBut, in case Parliament resists this too, I would also urge EU Member States to make clear that a further extension after 31 January is not possible,\u201d he begged.\n\n\u201cThis is plenty of time to ratify our deal. It will avoid this Parliament simply extending our membership again and again, distracting from the good conduct of the business of the European Union, and corroding public trust in politics in the UK,\u201d he concluded.\n\nHowever, Johnson\u2019s letter offers little practical incentive for the EU \u2014 which would rather like to keep hold of the United Kingdom, its rich fishing waters, and its exorbitant contributions to the EU budget \u2014 to comply, assuring the bloc that \u201cwe will of course not seek to deliberately disrupt the EU\u2019s business\u201d.\n\nThis seems a strange concession to make to the bloc after it sabotaged his plans to deliver Brexit on October 31st, given a promise to use Britain\u2019s veto power etc. as an EU member to \u201cdisrupt the EU\u2019s business\u201d is one of the few ways he might be able to them to deliver the clean break his own country\u2019s MPs will not agree to.\n\nThe British people voted to Leave the European Union well over three years ago in June 2016.\n\nAttorney General Geoffrey Cox: Parliament is \"dead\" and \"has no moral right to sit\" https://t.co/LYciRZKJgi \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 25, 2019\n\nFollow Jack Montgomery on Twitter: @JackBMontgomery", "description": "Boris Johnson wrote to EU Council chief Donald Tusk to formally accept a third Brexit delay and beg the bloc not to delay again in 2020.", "authors": ["Jack Montgomery"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/boris-cummings-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
