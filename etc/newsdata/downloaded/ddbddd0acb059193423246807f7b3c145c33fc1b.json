Now, they are in a crisis\n\nDustin George-Miller of Tottenham blog Cartilage Free Captain, offers his view on the problems in north London.\n\nHow did it go wrong so quickly? Just four months ago, Tottenham Hotspur were on top of the world, playing in their first ever Champions League final.\n\nToday they sit ninth in the table with 11 points from eight matches, already 13 points adrift of leaders Liverpool.\n\nTottenham are coming off of a humiliating 7-2 Champions League home loss to Bayern Munich and an equally concerning 3-0 defeat at Brighton.\n\nTottenham do not look the same team under Mauricio Pochettino as they did last season\n\nTheir swagger under Mauricio Pochettino is gone, replaced by a stodgy midfield diamond, lackluster attack, and a leaky, aging defence. Spurs haven't won away from home in the league since January.\n\nThere is talk of discord within the squad, with players who once praised Pochettino now unhappy with the Argentine's tactics and feeling betrayed at not securing a transfer out.\n\nThis Spurs team, once one of the happiest and most unified in the league, now has deep fissures that feel almost irreparable. Pochettino, who has been hailed as one of the best managers in Europe, now has supporters wondering if he'll make it to Christmas.\n\nSupporters are concerned after successive humblings against Bayern Munich and Brighton\n\nTOTTENHAM'S LAST 6 RESULTS IN ALL COMPETITIONS Brighton 3-0 Tottenham Tottenham 2-7 Bayern Munich Tottenham 2-1 Southampton Colchester 0-0 (4-3) Tottenham Leicester 2-1 Tottenham Olympiacos 2-2 Tottenham\n\nPochettino saw this coming. He spent much of the summer reaffirming his commitment to the club amid exit rumors, but also referenced the need for bravery, a 'painful' rebuild and the start of a new 'chapter'. More recently he bemoaned players 'different agendas' after the League Cup loss to Colchester.\n\nIn hindsight, it's clear he was asking Spurs chairman Daniel Levy for a dramatic squad refresh. Pochettino prefers working with young players, and the Spurs squad has stayed mostly static as the players have gotten older. This is in stark contrast to their top four competitors.\n\nSince the spring of 2016, Liverpool have almost completely turned over their roster. Spurs are still relying on eight of their 11 starters from when they played at Anfield in April 2016.\n\nBut while Levy did sign players this summer, breaking the club transfer record for Tanguy Ndombele and securing Giovani Lo Celso, Ryan Sessegnon, and Jack Clarke, he was less successful with the outgoings.\n\nChristian Eriksen was desperate to leave for Real Madrid and will feel betrayed by the club\n\nDanny Rose, Serge Aurier, Eric Dier, and Victor Wanyama were all linked away from the club, but either had no takers or had moves collapse. Not one club bid the \u00a325m release clause for Toby Alderweireld. Christian Eriksen was desperate to leave for Real Madrid, but his affections were not returned.\n\nAll this, plus the failure to sign a single player in the previous 18 months, has led to the current malaise, and it is of Tottenham's own making. It's ironic that in the first full season at Spurs' new stadium, when everything should be coalescing, things are now falling apart.\n\nBut what can be done? The solution comes down to a choice between two diametrically opposed paths: sack Pochettino, or back him.\n\nFiring Pochettino and appointing a new manager \u2013 Massimiliano Allegri and Jose Mourinho have both been mooted by fans \u2013 would be the simplest, most direct solution. It is also what most clubs would do in this situation.\n\nIt would be risky, but do Tottenham be brave and bring in Max Allergi or Jose Mourinho?\n\nThere are certainly positive outcomes that can come from firing your underachieving manager who has lost the dressing room \u2013 just ask Chelsea \u2013 and there is a vocal segment of Spurs supporters who are loudly advocating for this outcome. Most managers have a shelf life at a club; perhaps Pochettino has reached his sell-by date.\n\nHowever, it would be a risky move. The energy provided by a new manager may give a short-term jolt, pushing Spurs back into top four contention this season, but it would do little to address the underlying issues at the club. The want-away players (and others) may still angle for an exit, potentially leaving Tottenham bereft of its biggest stars, and without Pochettino to guide them.\n\nThe murmurs coming from club sources indicate Spurs are taking the opposite approach. The suggestion is Pochettino has 'credit in the bank' with both supporters and Levy, and that the January 2020 transfer window could be unusually active for Tottenham, with both incoming and outgoing players.\n\nThere is already talk of a January fire sale, with several players leaving and more coming in. But there are 16 matches left before the window opens, and it's unclear if Levy will have the patience to stay the course if the poor results continue.\n\nPochettino has credit in bank with Daniel Levy, but his patience will run thin if results continue\n\nIf sacking Pochettino is like changing a car's driver, this would be akin to giving Pochettino the freedom to rebuild the engine. It's not without its own risks. Backing Pochettino is likely to be protracted, messy, and painful.\n\nIt might result in fan favorite players departing, or the club sliding out of the top four. It could also be the thing that best sets Tottenham up for future success.\n\nSir Alex Ferguson used to talk about how he would upend his Manchester United sides every four years to keep things fresh.\n\nSpurs were not afforded that luxury but have the opportunity now. Standing by the manager and facilitating a major overhaul of the squad would certainly be brave, as would firing the man who took the club to a Champions League final. With Tottenham nearing a crisis point, Spurs' leadership needs to show bravery one way or the other.", "description": "TOTTENHAM FAN'S VIEW: How did it go wrong so quickly?
