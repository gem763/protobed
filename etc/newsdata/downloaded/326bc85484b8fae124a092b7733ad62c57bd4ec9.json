And on this Emmy night, all those elements came together in one glorious moment: Billy Porter\u2019s win as best actor in a drama for \u201cPose,\u201d the first openly gay actor to win the award.\n\nBut Porter\u2019s speech wasn\u2019t the only knock-your-socks-off moment. Michelle Williams gave the audience an eloquent and impassioned lesson on the importance of equal pay for women, especially women of color.\n\nAnd Patricia Arquette paid tearful tribute to her late transgender sister, issuing a rousing call for better treatment of transgender people.\n\nSome key moments of Emmys 2019:\n\nPHOEBE RULES\n\nIf you didn\u2019t know Phoebe Waller-Bridge before, well, you certainly do now.\n\nFirst, the British writer-actress of \u201cFleabag\u201d won for writing on a comedy series, telling the crowd that she found writing \u201creally hard and painful\u201d - but that she did it for the awards. She got to repeat the joke when she won best actress in a comedy, a huge upset over prohibitive favorite Julia Louis-Dreyfus for the last season of \u201cVeep.\u201d\n\nAnd then Waller-Bridge, 34, made it up to the stage yet again when her show won for outstanding comedy series, again besting \u201cVeep.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is getting ridiculous!\u201d she exulted. In true Britspeak, she called her show\u2019s journey to success \u201cabsolutely mental.\u201d She was pretty entertaining when she presented an award with funnyman Bill Hader, too - all in all, a massive night, as the Brits would say.\n\nA MEMORY BOTH POWERFUL AND EMPOWERING\n\nAlex Borstein, winning her second consecutive Emmy for \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\u201d started out in predictably humorous mode, making a racy underwear joke.\n\nThen she made a dramatic pivot to a poignant and harrowing memory about her grandmother, a Holocaust survivor, who during the war had been in line \u201cto be shot into a pit.\u201d\n\nShe said her grandmother had asked a guard, \u201cWhat happens if I step out of line?\u201d and the guard had replied that he didn\u2019t have the heart to shoot her, \u201cbut somebody will.\u201d\n\nShe did - and they didn\u2019t. \u201cAnd for that, I am here,\u201d Borstein said. \u201cAnd for that, my children are here.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo step out of line, ladies!\u201d she told the crowd, to cheers.\n\nFAR FROM THE BRONX\n\nWhen Jharrel Jerome won his Emmy for \u201cWhen They See Us,\u201d he said he felt like he \u201cshould just be back home in the Bronx right now chilling, waiting for my mom\u2019s cooking or something.\u201d But, said the 21-year-old, \u201cI\u2019m here in front of my inspirations.\u201d\n\nHe thanked, of course, director Ava DuVernay, and his \u201cbeautiful mother,\u201d who actively cheered him on from the audience. But he saved his most important thanks \u201cfor the men we know as the Exonerated Five.\u201d And all five stood up and cheered from their seats: Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Yusef Salaam, Raymond Santana, and Korey Wise, the man Jerome played onscreen.\n\nThe four-part Netflix series tells story of the Central Park Five, black and Latino teenagers from Harlem who were coerced into confessing to a rape they didn\u2019t commit.\n\nA SISTER REMEMBERED\n\nWhen Patricia Arquette won an Oscar in 2015, she made a plea for pay equality. On this Emmy night, rights for transgender people was on her mind, and for a very personal reason.\n\nAccepting her award for \u201cThe Act,\u201d Arquette said she was still in mourning over the death of her sister, Alexis Arquette, who died at age of 47 in 2016.\n\nAlexis, who was transgender, died from a heart attack and battled HIV for 29 years, according to her death certificate.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sad that I lost my sister Alexis, and that trans people are still being persecuted,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s get rid of this bias that we have everywhere. They\u2019re human beings and let\u2019s give them jobs.\u201d\n\nIn the audience, transgender actress and activist Laverne Cox stood and cheered. Cox was carrying a purse that bore a message: \u201cOct. 8, Title VII, Supreme Court,\u201d it said, referring to an upcoming court decision on workplace discrimination and LGBTQ rights.\n\nPASSIONATE ABOUT EQUAL PAY\n\nIt was actress Michelle Williams who raised the flag for equal pay, with an eloquent speech that was one of the most effective of the night.\n\nAccepting the award for \u201cFosse/Verdon,\u201d she called the honor \u201can acknowledgment of what is possible when a woman is trusted to discern her own needs, feel safe enough to voice them, and respected enough that they\u2019ll be heard.\u201d\n\nShe explained that when she\u2019d needed anything to help her better play dancer Gwen Verdon - more dance classes, more voice lessons, a different wig - she heard \u201cyes,\u201d not \u201cno,\u201d even though they cost money.\n\nShe also thanked the FX network and Fox 21 studios \u201cfor paying me equally, because they understood that when you put value into a person it empowers that person to get in touch with their own inherent value.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then where do they put that value? They put it into their work,\u201d she continued, pointing out that a woman of color makes 52 cents on the dollar compared to her white, male counterpart.\n\nSo when that woman \u201ctells you what she needs in order to do her job, listen to her, believe her,\u201d Williams said. \u201cBecause one day she might stand in front of you and say thank you for allowing her to succeed because of her workplace environment and not in spite of it.\u201d\n\nThe remarks won cheers not only in the room, but on social media. \u201cMichelle Williams just took us to the church of women\u2019s equality,\u201d wrote actress Kerry Washington on Twitter.\n\nLOVE, Y\u2019ALL!\n\nIt was obvious that it was Billy Porter\u2019s night the moment he sauntered into the Emmy Awards in a huge, lopsided black cowboy hat, a sparkling striped black-and-silver suit, and platform shoes.\n\nPorter has emerged as a huge red carpet star of late. But this time, the \u201cPose\u201d actor matched his carpet prowess with a huge Emmy victory, becoming the first openly gay actor to win best actor in a drama.\n\n\u201cThe category is love, y\u2019all!\u201d he crowed to the audience upon arriving onstage.\n\nHe then met the historical moment by quoting James Baldwin. \u201cIt took many years of vomiting up the filth I was taught about myself and halfway believed before I could walk around this Earth like I had a right to be here,\u201d went the powerful quote. \u201cI have the right. You have the right. We all have the right!\u201d\n\nAs he did years ago when his won his Tony, Porter paid tribute to his mother, Clorinda, saying \u201cthere\u2019s no stronger, more resilient woman who has graced this earth.\u201d\n\nHe also thanked his show\u2019s co-creator, Ryan Murphy: \u201cRyan Murphy, you saw me! You believed in us.\u201d\n\nHe added that \u201cWe as artists are the people that get to change the molecular structure of the hearts and minds of the people who live on this planet. Please don\u2019t ever stop doing that.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Emmy night is always a chaotic mix of the humorous, the emotional and the inspirational, mixed with some major sequins and glitter.
