I had a few stares from the lads and they just all laughed it off, but I was, like, I am being serious, if we don't turn up, we are going home.\"\n\nThe All Blacks, going for their third straight title, start as firm favourites against an Ireland team who are yet to hit their stride in Japan.\n\nHowever, both teams are mindful of the fact that Ireland have won two of their last three games against the world's top-ranked side, after 2016's 40-29 win in Chicago and a 16-9 victory in Dublin last year.\n\nConor Murray and World Player of the Year Johnny Sexton, one of the world's most settled and formidable half-back pairings, lead Irish hopes against a youthful New Zealand back line.\n\nBeauden Barrett remains at fullback behind fly-half Richie Mo'unga in Hansen's double playmaker ploy, while Jack Goodhue comes into the centres and Sevu Reece and George Bridge are on the wings.\n\n\"It's a little bit surreal, it's a little bit 'I can't believe it's finally here'. This time four years ago I was a spectator like you guys and it's not a great place to be,\" said Sexton, who missed Ireland's 2015 quarter-final - a 43-20 defeat to Argentina -- with a groin strain.\n\n\"So I'm really looking forward to going out there on the biggest stage and trying to show what we can do against the best team in the world, a team that hasn't lost for two World Cups.\"\n\nSATURDAY, OCTOBER 19\n\nEngland v Australia, Oita - 09:15\n\nNew Zealand v Ireland, Tokyo - 12:15\n\nSUNDAY, OCTOBER 20\n\nWales v France, Oita - 09:15\n\nJapan v South Africa, Tokyo - 12:15", "description": "England take on Australia and defending champions New Zealand play Ireland as the Rugby World Cup in Japan suddenly gets serious.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6020/925cf36cfd274726a65cc16a18428b76.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
