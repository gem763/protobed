We can\u2019t believe it\u2019s 2019 and this is real life \u2014 somebody pinch us. That\u2019s the general vibe at BH90210 this week, too. Somebody pinch them \u2014 it\u2019s 2019!\n\nThe gang keeps acting like they\u2019ve been frozen in the \u201990s and reemerged, Encino Man style, only to find the world strange and different, i.e., on-set sex is all intimacy coaches and consent forms. Shannen can\u2019t even eat a banana without getting HR called on her. Ian and head writer Anna continue to court each other using buzzy phrases like \u201cNetflix and chill,\u201d though neither of them seem to know exactly what it means. BAG skateboards everywhere and then laments, \u201cI miss the \u201990s.\u201d Gab speaks for us when she replies, \u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d\n\nPost-fire, production is shut down, and thank the angels (we\u2019re talking to you, Scott Scanlon) for that, because now everyone\u2019s got some time to make a list of their enemies in hopes that they can out the arsonist who destroyed the reboot set. Kudos to the writers\u2019 room for sifting through celeb-gossip message boards to include real feuds (Ian versus Dancing with the Stars\u2019 Cheryl Burke, Ian versus Ivanka Trump, Shannen versus Paris Hilton, Shannen versus the creator of the I Hate Brenda newsletters, BAG versus Vanilla Ice) alongside intriguing maybe-made-up feuds that we couldn\u2019t substantiate overnight (Jennie versus Christina Aguilera, Jennie versus Cole Hauser, Gabby versus her Surreal Life co-star Corey Feldman, and Shannen versus male comedians Jerry Seinfeld [whom Shannen stalked!?] and Mike Myers [wtf, someone bring us the receipts!]). It\u2019s worth noting, however, that there is no mention of Shannen\u2019s feud with Alyssa Milano on the set of another Aaron Spelling original, or Jennie\u2019s falling out with castmate and former BFF Tiffani Thiessen. (We are not counting Ian name checking the cast of Saved by the Bell.)\n\nWhile production is stalled, everyone gets QT with their cuties. Jennie has taken to drinking beer and watching golf with her bodyguard boyfriend. She and Ian double-date with their new love interests and everyone keeps insisting that everyone is \u201csuch a cute couple,\u201d despite the fact that Jennie seems slightly hung up on Jason. Gab sweats when Christine asks her to backdate a consent form from Fox so she\u2019s protected from being #Metoo\u2019d, but Gab feels overwhelmed by the suggestion. We call baloney. Gab is the president of the actors\u2019 union so she would be hep to this kinda shet, but her resistance proves to be more about a queer paper trail, since writing it down makes it real. Gab is still living in the theoretical even though she knows and we know that not only did she and Christine get it in, but she liked it.\n\nOnce we find out that the balmy Mr. Belvedere from the convention is the fire starter (more on that later), we can finally get back on set to shoot the very first scene of the reboot: a David-Donna love scene. Jason has totally thrown himself into his work, which means he\u2019s once again donning a scarf. He\u2019s also actively avoiding his real life, where his wife, Camille, is a person who drinks kamikazes and is pregnant with another man\u2019s child. Maybe Jason\u2019s not that good of a director. Please just make Ms. Tori Spelling feel comfortable during her sex scene, JP. After all these years, she is panicked about that age-old Hollywood question: \u201cIs it better if BAG gets hard, or if he doesn\u2019t?\u201d\n\nBy the way, Tori Spelling is using her Donna Voice, and to be honest we didn\u2019t know it was different until this mental mindfuck of a show showed us. The way Donna says, \u201cI love you, David\u201d has us downright damp. Tori may be feeling butterflies for BAG due to their on-camera smooshing, but BAG is preoccupied with his newly discovered Beautiful Boy son, who is making coffee runs and tying up cables on set as a PA. BAG is concerned with whether he\u2019ll be able to evolve into more of a DAD and less of a BAG. It might all be for naught, though, since a stranger with a badge who was \u2014 wow guys, really? \u2014 maybe racially profiled by Gab stole BB\u2019s water bottle for a DNA test. Expect another Maury moment in the season finale.\n\nLast but certainly not least, it\u2019s the couple we are most invested in: Shannen and her green screen. This episode marks the first time Shannen appears to be on location for 90 percent of her scenes. She has ditched the green screen and has now taken up with an assortment of snacks. (Don\u2019t worry if you weren\u2019t keeping track, we were: banana, chips and guac, pickle, tequila, cheese sandwich.) Most of Shannen\u2019s dialogue is snarky commentary or non-sequitur asides, which is to say the script was already written and they let her come in to riff. She\u2019s Don Rickles. She\u2019s the Migos. She\u2019s the motherfucking Genie in Aladdin.\n\nAnd that brings us to this couple: Damian and Anne, your weekly recappers. This episode, we were just 90210-lovin\u2019 best friends, side by side, screaming into each other\u2019s mouths when we thought we had figured out the whodunit exactly one beat ahead of Tori Spelling falling down the stairs. \u201cWe called it,\u201d Anne screamed. Damian, mid-celery bite in the aforementioned tuna melt, hollered \u201cJAMIE WALTERS!\u201d It had to be the former 90210 co-star who played Ray Pruit, singer of \u201cHow Do You Talk to an Angel?\u201d and apparently now a real-life firefighter. It all made sorta-sense: Jamie\u2019s acting career was derailed by fans\u2019 negative reaction to his character pushing Donna down a flight of stairs \u2014 and this was before social media, tweeps \u2014 so of course he would be a perfect villain for BH90210. We figured this was Tori\u2019s mea culpa for Aaron Spelling unceremoniously firing Jamie (he reportedly did get a million dollars, so he fine). Anyway, we were hyped, but then we were bamboozled. It wasn\u2019t him after all, but who cares? This is a great opportunity for Jennie Garth to sing \u201cHow Do You Talk to an Angel?\u201d into a Stella Artois! The Jamie Walters appearance was [*chef\u2019s kiss*] truly thrilling. Tori Spelling has been calling all the cameos and nods to the show of yore \u201cfan candy,\u201d and we love her forever for it.\n\nIt\u2019s 2019 and this penultimate episode of BH90210 has given us so many gifts: Tori got her boner from BAG, BAG admitted to the gang that he is the father, Gab announced she\u2019s gay undecided, Ian got the girl, and Shannen got her blood sugar up. But going into the finale, this couple needs to know where things stand with Jason and Jennie. Jason was considering leaving Camille, but Jennie was the one who told him to stay. And it\u2019s Jennie who urges him to go to the hospital when his wife is in an ambulance. Will there be a showdown at the hospital? Could their will-they-won\u2019t-they be the season-one cliffhanger? More importantly, will Joe E. Tata show his face?!? Whatever shenanigans come next week, this little queer duo is praying to you, Scott Scanlon, for a season-two order so we can keep partying like it\u2019s 9-0-2-1-0.\n\nPeaches\n\n\u2022 We audibly gasped at the callback to Kelly, Donna, and Brenda\u2019s Robert Palmer trio.\n\n\u2022 The Ted Casablanca\u2013style E! news show gave us all the feels. We miss you, Ted.\n\n\u2022 Kelly and Steve\u2019s relationship was one of our favorites, so it was great seeing Jennie and Ian in a scene together.\n\n\u2022 The biggest guffaw of the night came from Shannen asking in earnest, \u201cSiri, how many seasons of 90210 were there?\u201d\n\nPits\n\n\u2022 Jennie drinking beers for a boy is bad news.\n\n\u2022 Instead of backing up Emily V, the Robert Palmer girls back up David Silver\u2019s slow jam \u201cKeep it Together\u201d during BAG\u2019s Peach Pit After Dark fantasy.\n\n\u2022 We call fowl on Shannen\u2019s new scene partner, The Rooster.\n\n\u2022 Our math shows that there\u2019s only one episode left but two principal characters who have yet to get a dream sequence (Ian and Shannen). It seems inevitable that Ian will get the gig since he signed on first, but that won\u2019t keep us from holding out hope for Shannen.", "description": "The gang keeps acting like they\u2019ve been frozen in the \u201990s and re-emerged, Encino Man style, to a strange new world.
