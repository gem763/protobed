The role reflected this.\n\n'The consensus view from political opponents and commentators is that working to improve businesses' understanding of the cares and concerns of people is somehow incompatible with my role as an MSP.\n\n'So if I am asked to choose between Holyrood and this role, then I choose the Parliament I have dedicated the last nine years to, eight as party leader, a decision Tulchan supports. '\n\nShe said Tulchan Communications had behaved with 'utmost integrity' and she is 'sorry not to be working with them at this time'.\n\nSenior partner with the firm, Andrew Grant, said: 'We share Ruth's decision not to proceed with her role with us.\n\n'It is a great shame as we believe that she would have encouraged business to be bolder in addressing the issues of concern to their stakeholders.'\n\nScottish Labour MSP Neil Findlay plans to lodge a Member's Bill in the Scottish Parliament to ban MSPs from having second jobs\n\nScottish Labour MSP Neil Findlay, who plans to lodge a Member's Bill in the Scottish Parliament to ban MSPs from having second jobs, said: 'After a week of refusing to budge, Ruth Davidson has finally reflected on the widespread anger which has been expressed across the Parliament and among the public at large. This is to be welcomed.\n\n'There is a clear conflict of interest in an elected representative working for a company which lobbies politicians on behalf of corporate interests.'\n\nHe claims accepting the job did 'lasting damage' to the Scottish Parliament's reputation and gives 'a strong impression of politicians on the make'.\n\nMr Findlay added: 'If it is true that the parliamentary authorities approved Davidson's job with a lobbying firm, then it just demonstrates that the rules are not fit for purpose.'\n\nSNP MSP Gordon MacDonald said: 'If she is to claw back any respect at all, Ruth Davidson must publish all material and advice she has received regarding this role.'", "description": "The former Scottish Conservatives leader  was set to be appointed senior adviser to PR firm Tulchan Communications, for which she would have been paid \u00a350,000 for 25 days' work a year.", "authors": ["Danyal Hussain For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/16/20334762-0-image-a-68_1572365750712.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
