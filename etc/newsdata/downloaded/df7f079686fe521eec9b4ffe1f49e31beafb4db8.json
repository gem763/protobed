If they can get away with it, Donald Trump and the Republican Party are going to stage a coup to nullify the Constitution and the election. And if you\u2019re rolling your eyes right now, you are the na\u00efve one, and you\u2019d better wake up.\n\nThis isn\u2019t exactly a plan. It\u2019s foolish to say that Trump thinks ahead about anything. The late journalist Wayne Barrett said many true things about Trump, but the truest ever was when he observed that Trump says whatever will get him through the next 10 minutes. Those press conferences he gives outside the White House are impromptu performances in which he trots out whatever lie he thinks will sound good. I\u2019d use the word \u201cimprovisation,\u201d but that word has positive associations with masterful jazz artists. Trump isn\u2019t that. He\u2019s a 3-year-old child at a piano whose response to everyone in the house yelling \u201cStop!\u201d is to bang-play louder.\n\nEven so, he stumbles into planting a seed here and there, like when he muses\u2014sorry, \u201cjokes\u201d\u2014about serving three or four terms. And the people around him of course are more strategic and are thinking ahead. And they\u2019re all saying and doing and writing things right now that will, if the opportunity presents itself, pave the way for Trump to burn the Constitution.", "description": "With this man in office and with an authoritarian political party behind him, as we inch closer to justice, we also inch closer to our worst nightmare.", "authors": ["Michael Tomasky", "Special Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_675,w_1200,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570918692/191013-tomasky-impeachment-hero-ptk_cekdrj", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
