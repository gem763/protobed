Despite a 17-10 vote in their favour, supporters of the Momentum boss were unable to reach the two-thirds majority needed to overrule the chair.\n\nHowever, Saturday\u2019s meeting of the NEC at 10am in Brighton will require only a simple majority to pass the Lansman motion.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

We just can\u2019t afford to go into an election with a deputy leader set on wrecking Labour\u2019s chances.\n\n\u201cLabour members overwhelmingly want a deputy leadership election, but our outdated rulebook won\u2019t let it happen. You need 20 per cent of Labour MPs to trigger an election, and they just won\u2019t let the members have a fair and open election.\u201d\n\nFormer Labour leader Ed Miliband said: \"The move to abolish the deputy leader post without warning or debate is undemocratic, wrong and should not happen.\n\n\"Those who came up with the idea for the eve of Labour conference have taken leave of their senses.\u201d", "description": "Opponents of\u00a0Labour\u2019s deputy leader Tom Watson have made a dramatic move to unseat him on the eve of the party\u2019s annual conference in Brighton.
