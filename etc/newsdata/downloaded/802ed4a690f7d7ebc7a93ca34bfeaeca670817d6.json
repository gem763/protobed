For years the civil libertarians have been warning us that the intelligence community posed a threat to democracy, as we know it in these United States. Every so often they would point to some excess of the FBI or the CIA and tell us that the lights were going out in democratic America. Does not The Washington Post run atop its front page the maudlin line, \u201cDemocracy Dies in Darkness\u201d?\n\nWell, the darkness descended upon Donald Trump the moment he decided to run for president. The FBI and CIA, in cahoots with Mrs. Hillary Clinton and those popularizing the infamous \u201cdossier\u201d she financed, threw a blanket of darkness over his campaign.\n\nLate last week we learned that what had been a Justice Department administrative review had suddenly become much more serious. It has become a criminal inquiry. That means the Justice Department believes there is sufficient evidence that a crime has been committed. Now the prosecutor in charge, John H. Durham, will have the power to subpoena witnesses\u2019 testimony and documents. He can convene a grand jury and file criminal charges. My guess is that he has already convened a grand jury. Mr. Durham and Attorney General William Barr have been looking into the origins of the Obama administration\u2019s spying on President Trump. Just how did it begin? And who exactly started it? They are clearly unsettled by the answers they have found so far.\n\nMy colleague George Neumayr and I have been studying the Obama administration\u2019s spying on Mr. Trump for over three years. While most of the mainstream media searched desperately for a smoking gun carried by one of Mr. Trump\u2019s people or even by the president himself, we looked elsewhere. We looked at the politicized atmosphere within the FBI and the CIA. We even looked at British intelligence. No one else seemed interested, but we found evidence of criminal misbehavior by the former head of CIA, John Brennan, the former head of national intelligence James Clapper, and former head of the FBI, James B. Comey.\n\nOn March 23, 2018, we published the following lines, \u201cWhile Brennan\u2019s recklessness is obviously of no interest to the media, it is provoking increasing concern among government investigators, who are looking at a range of his abuses \u2014 from leaks to perjury to the outsourcing of spying on Trump to foreigners under the guise of \u2018intelligence-sharing.\u2019\u201d And we went on, \u201cA member of the intelligence community tells [us] that he was approached by FBI investigators inquiring about Brennan\u2019s improprieties at the CIA. He was startled to hear them venting aloud about Brennan\u2019s practice of using British intelligence officials to spy on the Trump campaign, including American contractors hired by the British who were working from the 12th floor of a building in Crystal City, Virginia, and an NSA building in San Antonio, Texas. Brennan, they fumed, was using British intelligence agents so that he could deny, if asked, that he had spied on the Trump campaign.\u201d\n\nNow if you will remember, President Trump claimed that the Obama administration had bugged Trump Tower. The chattering class raged about this claim for months. But we now know that Mr. Trump was right. Mr. Comey had sitting on his desk FISA warrants on Carter Page, Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn that gave him the power to reach into Trump Tower and intercept their communications. Seized with Trump Derangement Syndrome, the three stooges \u2014 Mr. Brennan, Mr. Clapper and Mr. Comey \u2014 had convinced themselves that Mr. Trump, a sui generis American businessman known for his patriotism, was a plant for the Russians.\n\nPsychologists would call such a far-fetched notion a case of projection. It was Mr. Brennan, after all, who famously voted for Gus Hall, the Soviet plant who ran for president in the 1970s.\n\nThe most perverse irony in all of this is that the American officials who bleated the loudest about \u201cmalicious actors interfering in the election\u201d presided over a government that actually did. It was members of the U.S. government who spied upon Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and sought to sabotage it through entrapment schemes and criminal leaks. It was Mr. Brennan who turned to foreigners for dirt on Mr. Trump to throw the election. They failed, but not for lack of trying. Just ask Harry Reid, who has noted Mr. Brennan\u2019s \u201culterior motive\u201d for briefing him on Crossfire Hurricane before Election Day.\n\nIn the coming days, we will learn much more about this audacious mischief, first through the report of Inspector General Michael Horowitz detailing FISA abuses, then through Mr. Durham\u2019s findings, which could result in a raft of indictments. Brace for impact, lefties. It is going to be a bumpy year ahead.\n\n\u2022 R. Emmett Tyrrell Jr. is founder and editor in chief of The American Spectator.
