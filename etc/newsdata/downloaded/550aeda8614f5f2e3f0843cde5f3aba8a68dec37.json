Emerging in its place is newly unearthed evidence suggesting another foreign effort to influence the 2016 election \u2014 this time, in favor of the Democrats.\n\nUkraine\u2019s top prosecutor divulged in an interview aired Wednesday on Hill.TV that he has opened an investigation into whether his country\u2019s law enforcement apparatus intentionally leaked financial records during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign about then-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort Paul John ManafortUkraine scandal shows that foreign influence is a bipartisan affair Let's get real: Democrats were first to enlist Ukraine in US elections Graham: Trump should be 'as transparent as possible' about Ukraine call MORE in an effort to sway the election in favor of Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonMcConnell hits Pelosi for having 'crumbled' to liberal pressure Poll: Biden leads 2020 Democrats by 2 points as Warren surges Hillary Clinton backs impeachment inquiry into Trump MORE.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe leak of the so-called black ledger files to U.S. media prompted Manafort\u2019s resignation from the Trump campaign and gave rise to one of the key allegations in the Russia collusion probe that has dogged Trump for the last two and a half years.\n\nUkraine Prosecutor General Yurii Lutsenko\u2019s probe was prompted by a Ukrainian parliamentarian's release of a tape recording purporting to quote a top law enforcement official as saying his agency leaked the Manafort financial records to help Clinton's campaign.\n\nThe parliamentarian also secured a court ruling that the leak amounted to \u201can illegal intrusion into the American election campaign,\u201d Lutsenko told me. Lutsenko said the tape recording is a serious enough allegation to warrant opening a probe, and one of his concerns is that the Ukrainian law enforcement agency involved had frequent contact with the Obama administration\u2019s U.S. Embassy in Kiev at the time.\n\n\u201cToday we will launch a criminal investigation about this and we will give legal assessment of this information,\u201d Lutsenko told me.\n\nLutsenko, before becoming prosecutor general, was a major activist against Russia\u2019s influence in his country during the tenure of Moscow-allied former President Viktor Yanukovych. He became chief prosecutor in 2016 as part of anti-corruption reforms instituted by current President Petro Poroshenko, an ally of the U.S. and Western countries.\n\nUnlike the breathless start to the Russia collusion allegations \u2014 in which politicians and news media alike declared a Watergate-sized crisis before the evidence was fully investigated \u2014 the Ukraine revelations deserve to be investigated before being accepted.\n\nAfter all, Ukraine is dogged by rampant corruption. It is a frequent target of Russian President Vladimir Putin Vladimir Vladimirovich PutinHillary Clinton backs impeachment inquiry into Trump Election meddling has become the new normal of US diplomacy Maher: Republicans 'right' to say Democrats 'never got over Trump's behavior' MORE\u2019s dirty tricks. And it is a country that, just last year, faked a journalist's death for one day, reportedly to thwart an assassination plot.\n\nBut the chief prosecutor, a member of parliament and a court seemingly have enough weight to warrant serious scrutiny of their allegations and an analysis of the audio tape.\n\nFurthermore, the mystery of how the Manafort black ledger files got leaked to American media has never been solved. They surfaced two years after the FBI investigated Manafort over his Ukraine business activities but declined to move forward in 2014 for lack of evidence.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWe now have strong evidence that retired British spy Christopher Steele began his quest in what ultimately became the infamous Russia collusion dossier with a series of conversations with top Justice Department official Bruce Ohr between December 2015 and February 2016 about securing evidence against Manafort.\n\nWe know the FBI set up shop in the U.S. embassy in Kiev to assist its Ukraine\u2013Manafort inquiry \u2014 a common practice on foreign-based probes \u2014 while using Steele as an informant at the start of its Russia probe. And we know Clinton\u2019s campaign was using a law firm to pay an opposition research firm for Steele\u2019s work in an effort to stop Trump from winning the presidency, at the same time Steele was aiding the FBI.\n\nThose intersections, coupled with the new allegations by Ukraine\u2019s top prosecutor, are reason enough to warrant a serious, thorough investigation.\n\nIf Ukraine law enforcement figures who worked frequently with the U.S. Embassy did leak the Manafort documents in an effort to influence the American election for Clinton, the public deserves to know who knew what, and when.\n\nLutsenko\u2019s interview with Hill.TV raises another troubling dynamic: The U.S. Embassy and the chief Ukrainian prosecutor, who America entrusts with fighting corruption inside an allied country, currently have a dysfunctional relationship.\n\nIn our interview, Lutsenko accused the Obama-era U.S. Embassy in 2016 of interfering in his ability to prosecute corruption cases, saying the U.S. ambassador gave him a list of defendants that he would not be allowed to pursue and then refused to cooperate in an early investigation into the alleged misappropriation of U.S. aid in Ukraine.\n\nLutsenko provided me with a letter from the embassy, supporting part of his story by showing that a U.S. official did in fact ask him to stand down on the misappropriation-of-funds case. \u201cWe are gravely concerned about this investigation for which we see no basis,\u201d an embassy official named George Kent wrote to the prosecutor\u2019s office.\n\nThe State Department on Wednesday issued a statement declaring that it no longer financially supports Lutsenko\u2019s office in its anti-corruption mission and considers his allegation about the do-not-prosecute list \u201can outright fabrication.\u201d\n\nMy reporting, however, indicates Lutsenko isn\u2019t the only person complaining about the U.S. Embassy in Kiev.\n\nLast year, when he served as House Rules Committee chairman, Rep.
