Since the last World Cup, the holders have scored 267 tries in 49 Tests, armed with attacking invention only Japan are able to rival.\n\nThe All Blacks have failed to score a try in only two of those games, against the 2017 British & Irish Lions in the second Test and in Dublin last November when Ireland defeated them 16-9. The common denominator was Ireland\u2019s Andy Farrell, the defence coach jettisoned by England after the 2015 World Cup, who is again plotting the downfall this weekend of a side last defeated at a Rugby World Cup in the 2007 quarter-final against France.\n\nHomeward bound: The lesser known lights who shone in World Cup pool stages Read more\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, you will have to ask him,\u201d said the All Blacks attack coach, Ian Foster, when asked how Farrell managed to find ways of stalling New Zealand\u2019s turbo-charged engine. \u201cHe does a job based on what he sees and so do we. We are assuming based on past behaviour that they will come up with a plan that they think is good enough to beat us. Will that involve some special plays? Probably.\u201d\n\nMake that definitely. \u201cWe have some new stuff that we have not done before,\u201d the Ireland prop Cian Healy said. \u201cWe have beaten them a couple of times in the last few years but this is a World Cup quarter-final. It is different.\u201d Asked if it was the biggest match of his career, he replied: \u201cDefinitely. It is a do-or-die game. We all understand that.\u201d\n\nIt took Ireland 111 years to defeat the All Blacks but they have won two of their past three Tests against a side aiming to win a third successive World Cup. Their coach, Joe Schmidt, who is standing down after the tournament, came up with a set-piece play last November that the New Zealander had borrowed from the All Blacks and does not want this phase of his career to be ended by his compatriots.\n\n\u201cI am sure Ireland will be primed and ready,\u201d Foster said. \u201cWe were beaten by a good team last November, but that was a different time, a different place. Is it relevant? We don\u2019t get stuck in the past: it is more about the excitement of the challenges in front of us. This is a week we have been preparing for a long time. It is where you really test yourself.\u201d\n\nIreland suffered a blow this week when their centre Bundee Aki was suspended for three weeks after being sent off last week against Samoa for a high tackle. They are waiting for the written report from the disciplinary panel before deciding whether to appeal, but on past precedent this tournament their chance of success would be remote.\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\n\n\n\u201cBundee is nowhere near a dirty player and he was upset about the decision, rightfully so,\u201d said the Ireland forwards coach, Simon Easterby. \u201cUntil we have seen the report and know how the panel came to that decision, we cannot make any further comment while preparing for the match on the basis that he will to be available.\u201d\n\nEasterby said that the key to success in their first World Cup meeting against New Zealand since 1995, when Jonah Lomu announced himself on the world stage with two tries in Johannesburg, would again be defence against a side adept at the counter-attack that is averaging 5.4 tries a match in the last four years.\n\n\u201cWe will need to be on the money without the ball,\u201d said Easterby. \u201cThey have so many threats across the park that you cannot switch off for a minute. We cannot afford to give them any soft turnover opportunities and will have to be fully on our game.\u201d", "description": "The Ireland prop Cian Healy says the quarter-final against the All Blacks is the biggest match of his career", "authors": ["Paul Rees"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd1d0ba768a9b9aeef8bc75417548ef8e792135f/98_502_2889_1734/master/2889.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c65a16104a3cf62cdc5a0e0063e36038", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
