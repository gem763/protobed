But he said that the agency expects to spend a further $200,000 sealing the skylight with a waterproof membrane. That work is under way.\n\nThe skylight is made up of dozens of glass panels that run for 355 feet along the soaring building\u2019s spine. It is powered by a complex mechanical system with 120 motors, which must move in sync when the skylight opens and closes.\n\nA worker Thursday on the skylight at the Oculus, which is made up of dozens of glass panels that run for 355 feet along the soaring building\u2019s spine.

Officials believe that the system malfunctioned during such an opening on Sept. 11, 2018, ripping a rubber seal that runs along the length of the roof.\n\nThat rip led to a series of leaks in which water dripped onto the white marble concourse, where tourists and shoppers mingle with commuters streaming between stations on the New York City subway and the PATH rail system.\n\nIn May, officials said they hoped to fix the skylight in time for this year\u2019s Sept. 11 anniversary. But the skylight remained closed this year for the first time since the building opened in 2016.\n\nThe architect who designed the Oculus, Santiago Calatrava, initially proposed that the entire roof pivot open. But as costs for the building soared past their $2 billion budget, Port Authority officials scaled back the design to a skylight, which cost $32 million.\n\nThe Port Authority spokesman said Thursday that the agency is conducting an engineering analysis with a view to repairing the skylight. \u201cWhile that analysis is on-going, we are taking prudent steps to better protect the skylight with a more durable barrier system,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Oculus was built in the aftermath of the terror attacks on the World Trade Center. It is positioned at an angle so that the skylight captures the sun each year during the hours when the planes struck the twin towers and the buildings collapsed.", "description": "Officials are scrambling to waterproof the leaky skylight at the World Trade Center Oculus transit hub before winter, with additional outlays of $200,000 expected.", "authors": ["Paul Berger", "Paul.Berger Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108981/social", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
