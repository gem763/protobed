Sandys/The Washington Post)\n\nWashington Capitals defenseman Michal Kempny is considered doubtful to play in Wednesday\u2019s season opener in St. Louis, Coach Todd Reirden said Saturday. Kempny, who had surgery for a torn left hamstring in April, has been on the ice for all of training camp, but he hasn\u2019t played in any exhibition games and remains in a noncontact jersey.\n\nReirden said the team hasn\u2019t considered starting the season with Kempny on long-term injured reserve, which would require him to miss at least the first 10 games, and he didn\u2019t rule him out for Washington\u2019s second or third games, a back-to-back at the New York Islanders on Friday and then home against the Carolina Hurricanes on Oct. 5.\n\n\u201cRight now, it\u2019s highly likely that he will not be playing in that [season] opener and then from there that can change the very next day,\u201d Reirden said.\n\n[Capitals trim roster to 28 with latest training camp cuts]\n\nReirden said earlier in the week that the team has increased Kempny\u2019s workload throughout training camp, and Kempny passed his skate conditioning test after practice Saturday. As for what the team is waiting for to allow Kempny to experience contact in practice, Reirden said it is \"a timeline that\u2019s set that he has to go through different protocols to get to where he needs to be to be 100 percent, and he\u2019s not there yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s coming along really well for that injury,\u201d Reirden said. \u201cThat\u2019s a long-term one, so he\u2019s right on schedule and doing great with it. In a perfect world, if we could have gotten him into one exhibition game and then Game 1, then that would\u2019ve been already ahead of schedule. But he\u2019s doing fine and continues to every day get more comfortable.\u201d\n\nKempny had six goals and 19 assists in 71 games last season, skating more than 19 minutes per game on the top pairing with John Carlson. Reirden listed Martin Fehervary, Christian Djoos and Jonas Siegenthaler as options to skate on Carlson\u2019s left to start the season; Fehervary practiced in that spot Saturday. The Capitals drafted Fehervary in the second round last year, and the 19-year-old has yet to make his NHL debut.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a young, up-and-coming guy who\u2019s similar to Kempny in terms of how he plays,\u201d Reirden said. \"We\u2019ve seen Christian Djoos with his ability to make plays offensively from that side. And then Siegenthaler is a guy for us that is a big body that can skate well and can defend against top guys. So we\u2019ve got a couple really good options, and we\u2019ll take at some different combinations tomorrow and see how that goes.\u201d\n\nIn other injury news, captain Alex Ovechkin didn\u2019t practice Saturday because of what the team is calling \u201clower-body maintenance,\u201d and he won\u2019t play in Sunday\u2019s preseason finale at Carolina, though he\u2019s still expected to be ready for the season opener. Forward Liam O\u2019Brien suffered an upper-body injury in a fight Friday night in St. Louis, and while he missed practice Saturday, Reirden indicated that O\u2019Brien will skate Sunday. He won\u2019t be in the lineup for the exhibition finale against the Hurricanes.\n\nRead more:\n\nDmitry Orlov is waiting for his partner on the Capitals\u2019 blue line to be determined\n\nFor Chandler Stephenson, the stakes are high in preseason\u2019s final week\n\nThe future might be arriving fast for Capitals goalie Ilya Samsonov", "description": "\u201cRight now, it\u2019s highly likely that he will not be playing in that [season] opener and then from there that can change the very next day,\u201d Coach Todd Reirden said.", "authors": ["Isabelle Khurshudyan", "Reporter Covering The Washington Capitals", "September At Pm", "Isabelle Khurshudyan Covers The Washington Capitals.
