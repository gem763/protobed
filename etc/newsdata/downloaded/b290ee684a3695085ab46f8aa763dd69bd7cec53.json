THANK YOU TO ALL WHO SHOWED UP AND SHOWED OUT!!\" he wrote on Instagram. \"NOW WATCH ME WORK!!\"\n\nReal Housewives of New York star Bethenny Frankel also put her charity, BStrong, to work in the relief efforts, providing critical supplies, medical support and evacuation assistance.\n\n\"The damage is incomprehensible, and thanks to you, our warehouse is filling up and we are working to send 2k lbs of relief to Sandy Point in South Abacos, Florida tomorrow. Please donate,\" wrote Frankel. \"This is not the boy (or skinnygirl) who cried wolf, this is a wolf. This damage is worse than what I witnessed in Puerto Rico from #HurricaneMaria.\n\n\"I am here to come and help get these efforts rolling, and am thankful that we will be on the ground to continue this important work.

I know it's rough at these times. You guys hang in there. Hang in there. Help is on the way,\" he said. \"Everybody here in South Florida, we ain't just going to pray for you. We're going to go out and do some things and help you rebuild. That's what it's all about.\n\n\"I am half Bahamian, half Jamaican, the rest American, so we gotta do what we gotta do to help our people in these times. So everybody, y'all pitch in. Make phone calls, send money, send donations... Do do what you gotta do. We're going to have to go over there and rebuild the Bahamas. Just like we gotta rebuild Puerto Rico.\"\n\nMeanwhile, other stars are being criticized for what some are calling their \"tone deaf\" responses to the storm \u2014 in particular Modern Family actress Sofia Vergara, who tweeted a photo of her with friends and family members on a private jet with the caption \"Bye bye Dorian!!\"\n\nEarlier, Vergara had also posted a shot of her and a friend in bathing suits holding drinks with the caption, \"Waiting for Dorian.\"\n\n\"I am a fan. But the waiting for Dorian comment was not funny,\" wrote one commenter. \"That caption sounds insensitive, wrote another. \"People are not gonna like it.\"", "description": "Stars are pledging money and aid after Dorian caused unprecedented destruction.", "authors": ["Jennifer Van Evra Is A Vancouver-Based Journalist", "Digital Producer For Q.
