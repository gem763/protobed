They have removed themselves from the national grid and installed solar panels, hydropower and a wind turbine. Even the tap water comes directly from a nearby spring.\n\nBy night, there are no power-guzzling TVs or games consoles. Rather, the 17 come together for communal wood-cooked dinners in the shared central farmhouse. Afterwards, they gather around the fire for conversation and games. An upstairs room has been converted for producing wine.\n\n\u201cSome people say it\u2019s back-to-basics but I think it\u2019s back to the future,\u201d says Nick, who originally comes from Birmingham but has lived here for three years. \u201cPeople are waking up to just how much damage we are doing to the Earth \u2013 and they are looking to places like this to show a better way.\u201d\n\nSo successful has the community been, indeed, that it has inspired the Welsh government to create a unique planning law with the explicit aim of encouraging others to build similar low impact dwellings, homesteads and communities. More of which shortly.\n\nYet, for now, there is bad news: this particular Good Life could soon be brought to an abrupt end.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The world needs more places like this, not fewer. But we will do everything we can to save it.\u201d\n\nMore than 100 people have lived at Brithdir Mawr in its 25-year existence \u2013 some for decades; others mere months \u2013 and, arriving here on a sunny September day, it\u2019s easy to see the appeal.\n\nTucked five minutes down a dirt road in the foothills of the Preseli Mountains, the commune sits amid lush green slopes and mature woodland of birch, ash and alder. The soundtrack is birds singing, wood chopping and children playing on rope swings. Ducks walk lazily about, undisturbed by the community\u2019s two dogs. No-one here locks their doors. Many of the eight or nine dwellings don\u2019t even have locks.\n\n\u201cThree months ago I was living in Slough,\u201d says Lea Trainer with an air of disbelief as we sit on a garden bench drinking herbal tea made with spring water. \u201cI was working 12-hour days, just trying to keep up with rent, breathing in Heathrow fumes. Now, I wake up every morning to this.\u201d\n\nThe 35-year-old, who came here with his family, waves his arms around: \u201cIt\u2019s the best decision we ever made,\u201d he enthuses. \u201cWe already feel healthier, calmer, less fatigued. I actually get to see my kids during the day \u2013 how many dads can say that?\u201d\n\nLater that night, as we sit by a log fire in the family\u2019s small cottage (kitchen, lounge, a single shared bedroom), I suggest the foursome \u2013that\u2019s Lea, wife Kirsty, 33, and their children Brianna, 8, and Frankie, 7 \u2013 don\u2019t seem like your average commune-dwellers. He was previously a building project manager, while she was a PA. Their oldest child, Scott, is 18 and in the army.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re definitely not typical but that\u2019s the point,\u201d says Kirsty. \u201cYou don't have to wear tie-dye or have dreadlocks to be at home at Brithdir. You just have to understand there are better ways of living than the horrible nine-to-five \u2013 for both you and the planet.\u201d\n\nShe prods the fire. \u201cThe joy here is you're forced to slow down and appreciate what matters: your family, nature, good food. I don\u2019t want to sound all cringe but that connectedness is important.\u201d\n\nThey moved after Kirsty, who home-schools the two children, brought the pair here for a week-long educational trip in January. \u201cThey were texting me about coppicing and stone walling and bird-spotting while I was at work,\u201d says Lea. \u201cI don\u2019t know what an epiphany is but I think I had one. When I came to pick them up, I said: 'Let\u2019s come back as a family'.\u201d\n\nAfter that second visit in March, they applied to move into the site\u2019s only vacant cottage. The rest of the commune approved.\n\nThe evenings, too, have a certain magic here. Dinner is announced by that day\u2019s cook blowing a horn. Residents sit around a vast oak table and tuck into curries, broths and soups mopped up with home-made bread. On the night I stay, ratatouille is served with potatoes and salad. \u201cEverything you\u2019re eating is grown right here,\u201d Ann Andrews-Mason tells me. \u201cApart from the butter. We can't make that. Yet.\"\n\nThe mass gathering \u2013 which this evening includes four volunteers staying at the commune for a week of work \u2013 somehow has the strange feeling of Christmas. \u201cI get that,\u201d says Lea. \u201cWhen you produce your own food, eating it becomes a celebration. Dinner becomes an event every night.\u201d\n\nIt is a way of life well known to student Grace French.\n\nAlthough she no longer lives on site, the 19-year-old was born here \u2013 in the room next to where we speak \u2013 and stayed until she was 16.\n\nWhen she talks of her childhood, it is of mud pies, camp fires, outdoor swimming. \u201cI suppose it was pretty unique,\u201d she nods. \u201cBut I never knew anything different. I enjoyed it. Until I became a teenager, maybe.\u201d\n\nAnd then? \u201cI was on my phone a lot,\u201d she says. \u201cThe lack of reception could get annoying.\u201d\n\nCertainly, life here has its challenges.\n\nRent is around \u00a3200 a month so most residents work part-time jobs in nearby Newport village as well as labouring on site. Electricity supplies can be unpredictable and sometimes go down. And decision-making, even for minor things like changing the cleaning rota, can drag on for weeks.\n\n\u201cYou put proposals to a weekly meeting,\u201d explains Lea. \u201cThen they get discussed, amended, considered, taken forwarded, amended again, then, eventually, there\u2019s a final vote. And all you did was suggest something like tidying the wellies more often.\u201d\n\nProbably the community\u2019s finest hour was inspiring a historic change to Welsh planning law which has made it easier for others to set up similar off-grid homes and communities.\n\nThat achievement dates back to Brithdir\u2019s creation in 1994.\n\nOxford University graduates Julian Orbach and wife Emma bought the farm and land as a place to live out their ideals of simplicity and spirituality. But, as others joined them, a number of low-impact wooden buildings were constructed without planning permission.\n\nWhen they were seen by the local authority in 1998 \u2013 an official in a low-flying plane spotted a solar panel glistening in the sun \u2013 the residents were ordered to pull the buildings down.\n\nThe discovery was described at the time as a \u201clost tribe\u201d being found in Wales. Several newspapers, including this one, dispatched reporters to the scene. Many were confounded to find the place signposted and common knowledge in the area. \u201cIt's quite surreal to hear you're part of a lost tribe,\u201d muses Tony Haigh, a Cambridge University maths graduate turned gardener who has lived here for 21 years. \u201cEspecially when you only live five minutes from a main road.\"\n\nEither way, a decade-long legal battle to retain the buildings ensued with the community arguing that, because the wooden structures allowed people to live self-sufficiently, while having almost zero environmental impact, they should be allowed to stay.\n\nThe Welsh government, with one eye on the need to reduce the country's ecological footprint, eventually agreed: in 2008, it passed the One Planet Development law allowing the building of low impact homes in protected planning areas as long as they provided their own energy and water.\n\nMore than 40 such developments have been approved across the country since.\n\n\u201cWe always knew we were in the right,\u201d says Tony. \u201cI could never understand what these officials hoped to achieve by trying to move us. But then what does officialdom ever hope to achieve?\u201d\n\nThe 69-year-old \u2013 originally from London \u2013 is the collective\u2019s longest current resident: \u201cI just like this way of life,\u201d he says. \u201cI like the community, the peace, being active every day. I\u2019ve never wanted anything else.\u201d\n\nHaving been here so long, he is confident Brithdir Mewr can now win its new fight for survival, too.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019d have to carry me out, anyway,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is my home \u2013 I won\u2019t be leaving quietly.\u201d\n\nFor the time being, the 17 residents are hoping things don\u2019t quite come to that.\n\nThey have been given until early 2020 to show they can raise the money and will, this week, kick start a crowdfund campaign. It will be launched with an onsite party featuring - but of course - circle dancers.\n\nIf that initial fundraising goes well, they then plan to open a community share scheme offering anyone anywhere in the world the opportunity to invest in the set-up. The idea from there is that, if they raise enough to buy the land, they will then generate future income by setting up a range of onsite social enterprises including a Welsh language school, a farming retreat and a holiday campsite.\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be easy,\u201d admits Lea, who is leading on the scheme. \u201cBut we have to try. We live in a time when governments everywhere are declaring climate emergencies because of the environmental damage our societies are causing the Earth, so it makes no sense to let Brithdir fail. The world needs what we are doing. It needs our 25 years\u2019 experience in doing it. It would be a tragedy to lose this place.\u201d", "description": "One of the best things about living in the remote eco-commune of Brithdir Mawr, says Nick Ward, is the fact his home has no toilet.
