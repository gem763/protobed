There\u2019s lots of discussions going on,\" he said on the BBC's Andrew Marr show.\n\nStarmer told the BBC that the Labour party is poised to back a second amendment as well, arguing that Johnson's deal should be considered by the British public.\n\n\"Whether it\u2019s this deal or any future deal it\u2019s got to go back, so the public can say, \u2018do you want to leave on these terms?\u2019 If so then we do. If not, we remain,\" Starmer said.\n\nLabour shadow chancellor John McDonnell also said a second referendum amendment was inevitable and said that the people should have a say on the deal.\n\nRaab called the Labour party plans to back a second referendum \"a breach of faith with the voters\".\n\nRead more: Brexit Guide: Where are we now?", "description": "Boris Johnson said he would introduce legislation on Brexit this week in Parliament.
