Fellow right-hander Zack Greinke will start for Houston.\n\nIn the first World Series where road teams have won the first six games, the Astros will try for their second title in three seasons while the Nationals seek the first crown in their franchise\u2019s 50-year history.\n\nIt would also be the first World Series title for Washington since 1924.", "description": "Houston (AFP) \u2013 Stephen Strasburg baffled Houston\u2019s batters as the Washington Nationals routed the Astros 7-2 Tuesday, forcing a one-game", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/29/22abf7_washington-pitcher-stephen-strasburg-baffled-houston-nationals-level-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
