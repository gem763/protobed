In other research, 42 percent believe that physical objects can hold spiritual energy, and 29 percent claim they\u2019ve made contact with a dead person.\n\nThe scientific community says the laws of physics discredit ghost stories \u2014 crediting such \u201csightings\u201d to the power of suggestion, hallucinations or other more common, reasonable explanations. Still, for believers, their spine-tingling clashes with \u201cthe other side\u201d are absolutely real.\n\nIn the spirit of Halloween as it nears, we revisit the believe-it-or-not ghost stories that kept us awake in 2019, providing updates wherever possible.\n\nThe Hobo Hill home in Jefferson City, Mo., is allegedly haunted by hundreds of spirits. (Photo: Courtesy of Aaron Clark)\n\nAfter relocating from their Jefferson City, Mo. home because they were convinced it belonged to \u201chundreds of spirits,\u201d a couple is now renting out the apparently haunted property on Airbnb.\n\nIn October 2017, Aaron and Erin Clark bought the 5,000-square-foot house, called \u201cHobo Hill,\u201d so-named for the masses of homeless people that historically occupied the land. A few months after moving in, they claim, there were strange occurrences \u2014 displaced noises, footsteps and shadowy figures. \u201cEvery night at 11:15 p.m., I heard the same sound in the attic,\u201d Aaron tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cIt was as though someone dropped a heavy box and was dragging it across the floor.\u201d\n\nThe couple\u2019s daughter, then 7, also began sleepwalking. \u201cShe walked with a shuffle and a tilted head, and spoke in tongues \u2014 the stuff of horror movies,\u201d says Aaron. \u201cOne night, I found her sobbing at her bedroom window. Then, she turned around with the creepiest, widest smile, like she was possessed.\u201d\n\nThe energy in the house was aggressive, says Aaron, a former police officer, even scaring the family\u2019s pet pit bull, who refused to approach the stairs. \u201cEvery time I was in the basement, I felt like someone was jumping on my back,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd people who visited my attic felt a touch on their shoulder.\u201d\n\nThe most profound evidence of a haunting: The couple kept seeing a man wearing a suit and a top hat near the stairway. \u201cWe saw him out of the corner of our eye and then he would vanish,\u201d says Aaron. They were desperate to cleanse their home, consulting a priest for holy water and hiring paranormal investigators, who claimed hundreds of spirits lived in the basement.\n\n\u201cAfter seven months, we had enough,\u201d Aaron tells Yahoo Lifestyle. To prevent another family from experiencing the same disturbances, the couple now rents the property through Evolve, a vacation rental platform that lists the home on Airbnb and other websites, attracting brave and curious visitors. \u201cGuests have seen shadow people, orbs and one group was too scared to spend the night, checking out at midnight.\u201d\n\nThe property was featured in an August episode of the Travel Channel\u2019s The Dead Files.\n\nNow the family has found peace in a new home and rarely visits, except for Erin\u2019s mother, who is the caretaker. She claims that an invisible force knocked her off a stepladder while painting and while cleaning and that she heard footsteps in the attic. \u201cMy daughter calls it \u2018the scary house,\u2019\u201d says Aaron.\n\nBarmen allege thirsty ghosts showed up for last call\n\nIn July, two months after the opening of Milner\u2019s Gate brewery in Idaho, two barmen captured what they believe to be ghostly patrons showing up for last call. In YouTube security footage, four barstools move out from under the bar, as if pulled by someone \u2014 or something \u2014 taking a seat. A second video, filmed days later, showed a ghostly light \u201cdancing\u201d in front of the bar.\n\nGeneral manager Chris Erke tells Yahoo Lifestyle that the Freemasons, a secret, worldwide fraternity, once met with regularity on the property. The timing, he says, was ironic.\n\n\u201cWe found a clock that was stopped at the 11th hour, and our staff decided to continue a Freemasonry tradition in which every morning and night at 11, we ring a bell for a fallen member,\u201d says Erke. Both ghostly episodes were recorded at 10:59 p.m.\n\nSince the video, employees have heard voices and scraping sounds that mimic stools dragged on the floor. \u201cMy friend saw a man in a top hat standing behind me,\u201d bartender Brian Rambur tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cAnd once, late at night, we heard a female voice say, \u2018Hello?\u2019 like she wanted service.\u201d Recently, he claims, two frying baskets hanging over a cold kitchen stove did backward flips onto the floor.\n\nThe men believe their bar holds meaning for spirits and say paranormal experts have identified one as James, whose voice was heard on tape during an investigation.\n\nGhost hunters play ball with spirit of dead girl\n\n\n\n\n\nParanormal investigators in Ireland say they played with the spirit of a little girl during a ghost hunt at a private home.\n\nAccording to Sharon Rectory\u2019s Facebook page, a double murder took place at the residence in the 1700s, and Paranormal Investigators Ireland also believe a little girl who witnessed the crimes was killed. Hoping to engage the spirit, whose voice can allegedly be heard throughout the home, they brought a child\u2019s ball to the property.\n\nGhost hunter Kerry Malone tells Yahoo Lifestyle that while the family who resides in the home is lovely, there is a \u201cheavy\u201d and \u201chostile\u201d energy in the space. \u201cNormally when we get to a location, the team disperses to set up equipment for the investigation,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, in Sharon Rectory, we agreed that no team member should ever be alone for their own safety.\u201d\n\nAfter placing the ball at the top of the stairs, the crew watched it bounce down the steps on the live footage. When they rushed to the stairs, they felt a \u201cthreatening presence.\u201d\n\nEmma Tully, 30, whose parents have lived in the home for 22 years, tells Yahoo Lifestyle that after her parents moved into the home, \u201cDoors slammed and pictures fell off the wall.\u201d Even now, after periods of silence, \u201call hell breaks loose.\u201d\n\nAccording to psychic mediums who have visited the home, the spirit girl\u2019s age is estimated as 8. Tully says there is a \u201cdemonic energy\u201d attached to the girl\u2019s spirit and visitors are always cautioned.\n\n\u201cThe girl has been seen by many in the house, including my sister Victoria and mother,\u201d says Tully. \u201cOn many occasions, we have all heard a young girl talking in the house when no one [else] was there. Both myself and my mother have been called \u2018Mama\u2019 by something unseen. This happens quite a lot.\u201d\n\nOther spirits who allegedly live in the home, says Tully, are \u201cthe Blue Lady,\u201d the spirit of a former occupant, and \u201cthe Tall Man,\u201d whom Tully describes as a threatening, seven-foot-tall shadow figure \u201cwho appears at night and stands at the end of your bed.\u201d She also alleges that her family has been restrained in their beds \u201cby an unseen force.\u201d\n\nTully resides in a guest house on the property with her husband and two children, while her parents stay in the main home. The most common question asked of Tully is, of course: Why haven\u2019t her parents moved out? Tully says her parents learned about the severity of the haunting after purchasing the home. \u201cThey spent their life savings here so they can\u2019t just leave,\u201d she says. \u201cMy parents don\u2019t want to be scared in their own home \u2014 they\u2019ve been through a lot.\u201d\n\nGhost children play in \u201cOne of America\u2019s most haunted homes\u201d\n\nIn April, Baton Rouge couple Brandon and Taryn Hunt reportedly visited Myrtle\u2019s Plantation in St. Francisville, La., known as \u201cOne of America\u2019s most haunted homes.\u201d The 1800s bed-and-breakfast is allegedly haunted by a \u201cslave girl\u201d named Chloe, first photographed in 1992. The couple filmed on the property and, during a playback, saw what resembled three pairs of translucent feet walking across the floor.\n\n\u201cWe were freaking out when we saw the video. It was totally surprising. We didn't know what it was or what to expect, or how that could have happened,\u201d Brandon said, according to the Daily Mail.\n\nHester Eby of Myrtle\u2019s Plantation tells Yahoo Lifestyle that children have died on the property from yellow fever, poisoning or natural death. \u201cThere are spirits here \u2014 our ghost children sometimes play with or touch guests to wake them up, but nothing here means harm,\u201d she says.\n\nWhen young souls are afoot, flowery fragrances, allegedly worn by their mothers, can be detected in the house. \u201cThe spirits are where the heart is,\u201d says Eby, adding that rainy weather can draw them out.\n\n\u201cIn the South, we welcome spirits,\u201d she tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cWe\u2019re glad when guests can capture them on video.\u201d\n\nInvisible energy yanks sleeping baby\u2019s leg\n\n\n\n\n\nRob and Becky Moss of Oxford, Mich., turned on their baby monitor this summer to see a white object floating around their 1-year-old son as he slept in his crib. \u201cI said, \u2018Rob look at this orb,\u2019\u201d Becky tells Yahoo Lifestyle. Filming the monitor with a cell phone, the couple watched the orb approach the boy. Suddenly, his leg and lower body were lifted into the air, as though he were being yanked.\n\nThe video, nearly two minutes long, shows the toddler sitting up, seemingly disturbed by the motion, before falling back toward the mattress. When the Mosses walking into their son\u2019s bedroom, he was sleeping and stirring awake. \u201cI was holding the monitor and we could see the orb on the screen, but not in the room,\u201d Becky tells Yahoo Lifestyle.\n\nBecky says their son has no medical condition that would cause his body to jerk upward in his sleep. There have not been disturbances since \u2014 or so they believe \u2014 however, Becky says that a few weeks later, while watching the living room camera monitor, she saw an orb drop from the ceiling and make a sharp left, headed toward the bedrooms.\n\n\u201cSomething might be in our house but we aren\u2019t fearful and it doesn\u2019t seem negative,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople have told us to use sage and hire a ghost team, but we don\u2019t want to stir up more activity.\u201d\n\nMarket Basket employee claimed elderly ghost appeared in grocery store\n\nOne evening in March, former Market Basket baker Christiania Bush was icing a cake at the Wilmington, Mass., branch of the New England supermarket chain, when she looked up and saw a ghost-like woman.\n\nBush, a ghost skeptic, described the figure to Today. \"She was old. She had short curly grandma hair, like every grandmother's haircut. And she [was] in this white dressing gown and had a white hair cap and she wasn\u2019t wearing shoes. I thought it was really strange she wasn't wearing shoes.\"\n\nIn a split second, she says, the woman evaporated. \"And when I turned around to bring the cake back to the counter, I saw the lady in the background \u2014 she was staring right at me,\u201d Bush told Today. \u201cI looked down for a second because it didn\u2019t register and when I looked back she was gone.\"\n\nBush posted her sighting to Instagram, asking, \u201cThis is going to sound really strange\u2026 but has anyone seen a ghost in the Wilmington Market Basket?\u201d The post created ghost hysteria, with rumors reaching the Wilmington Police Department, who shared a Facebook video featuring comical \u201cproof\u201d of the haunting (above).\n\nEventually, Market Basket corporate officials released a statement: \u201cAs far as we know all of our stores are ghost-free. But if there\u2019s anything to it, she\u2019s probably attracted to our Victorian-era prices.\u201d\n\nBush, who no longer works at Market Basket, tells Yahoo Lifestyle that the figure, which stood 15 feet away in the frozen aisle, disappeared when she briefly looked away. \u201cI have never experienced anything like this,\u201d she says. \u201c...I definitely saw her.\u201d\n\nSince Bush\u2019s departure, she\u2019s heard rumors of \u201cweird stuff\u201d occurring at the store, however, no one has stepped forward with proof. Representatives of Market Basket did not respond to Yahoo Lifestyle\u2019s request for further comment.\n\nWoman faints during haunted tour when touched by a \u201cghost orb\u201d\n\nSpirit Orb or Just a bug? People speculating after Video surfaces showing a woman faint after being touched by a mysterious flying object at The Zak Bagans\u2019 Haunted museum. Watch @News3LV tonight at 6:00 for more on this supernatural story. \ud83d\udc7b @hauntedmuseum @Zak_Bagans pic.twitter.com/X1GfqsbVbi \u2014 Gabby Hart (@GabbyNews3LV) June 24, 2019\n\nZak Bagans\u2019s Haunted Museum in Las Vegas regularly draws ghost believers. According to the museum\u2019s website, the 1938 building houses freaky artifacts such as a wine cabinet that contains a \u201cmalicious spirit\u201d that allegedly inspired the 2012 film The Possession, while a \u201cblack-cloaked figure\u201d has been occasionally seen on tours.\n\nIn June, a woman visiting got so spooked by an alleged \u201cghost orb\u201d that she fainted to the ground in security footage.\n\nTour guide Earle Brown told news station KSNV in June, \"A spirit orb, spirits can manifest in these orbs of light. A lot of times, when spirits touch you, they can drain your energy and it can happen quite quickly. When that happens, you literally can go down.\"\n\nBrown also said he doubted the object was a bug, due to its speed and movement.\n\nBagans, the star of Travel Channel\u2019s Ghost Adventures, who reportedly just purchased the Los Angeles home where two people were murdered by Charles Manson\u2019s followers, tells Yahoo Lifestyle that guests often get spooked during tours.\n\n\u201cThis is actually a very common event at the museum,\u201d says Bagans. \u201cA week later, another woman got touched by a ball of light and had the same effect of being knocked off balance and falling, which was also captured on video.\u201d\n\nBaby monitor captures ghost near crib after scratches appear on child\n\nWhen a 1-year-old girl in Michigan woke up with purple scratches on her face, her parents checked the baby monitor and reportedly viewed a ghostly presence walking by the crib, startling their daughter, Lily.\n\n\u201cIt was chilling,\u201d father Joshua Higgins told WXYZ. \u201cIt was literally a chill down your spine. Like that \u2018what if\u2019 factor \u2014 Is this what I just saw?\u2019\u201d\n\nHeather Brough, Lily\u2019s mom, said, \"It\u2019s almost like she sees something that we don\u2019t.\u201d She added that whatever allegedly scratched their daughter came for her, too. \u201cIt scares us that it could do something else,\" Brough told WXYZ. \"I mean, there was a morning I woke up and I felt like someone\u2019s hands were around my neck.\"\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, Brough has heard \u201cscreaming, stomping and laughing\u201d in the home. \u201cThere have been times where me and my fianc\u00e9 would wake up in the morning and I would hear an angry male voice \u2014 like someone had stubbed their toe,\u201d she reportedly said. The couple lives in a guest house belonging to Higgins\u2019 parents, reported People.\n\nThe couple could not be reached by Yahoo Lifestyle for comment.\n\nMom records \u201cDobby\u201d ghost figure hobbling down her driveway\n\nOne of the creepiest moments of 2019 comes courtesy of a Colorado mom whose home security camera caught a ghostly figure hobbling down her driveway late one evening.\n\nIn June, Vivian Gomez shared the 11-second video, seen by 16 million viewers, on Facebook. It featured a small white figure exiting her house, casting a shadow on the fence, and flapping its arms like a chicken as it waddled down the driveway.\n\n\u201cSo I woke up Sunday morning and saw this on my camera and am trying to figure out\u2026 what the heck??\u201d Gomez wrote. \u201cFirst I saw the shadow walking from my front door then I saw this thing \u2026 has anyone else seen this on their cameras?? The other two cameras didn\u2019t pick it up for some reason.\u201d\n\nSkeptics cast the figure as Gomez\u2019s 9-year-old son sleepwalking or dancing with underwear on his head. A majority said it resembled \u201cDobby,\u201d an elf from the film Harry Potter, or an alien-ghost hybrid.\u201cThis wasn\u2019t altered or photoshopped and no trick photography,\u201d Gomez wrote on Facebook.\n\nGomez did not return Yahoo Lifestyle\u2019s requests for comment. When speaking to Inside Edition, Gomez said the figure was not her son Bobby. \"No\u2026 I wouldn't let him out at dark by himself,\u201d she said.\n\nThe mother\u2019s camera only recorded 10 seconds of footage, she told the website, but she believes the entity disappeared into a field across the street.\n\nMom terrified to turn on baby monitor when \u2018ghost woman\u2019 visits daughter\n\nView photos Los Angeles mom Natalie Wallace saw a pink-and-purple figure standing over her sleeping daughter's crib. (Photo: Courtesy of Natalie Wallace) More\n\nIn June, Los Angeles mom Natalie Wallace checked her Cocoon Cam baby monitor, recording her sleeping six-month-old baby, and saw weird splotches on the screen. While the cam\u2019s motion detector creates colored images indicating movement, Ruby was sleeping motionless, says Wallace.\n\n\u201cI joked to my husband, \u2018What if it\u2019s ghosts?\u2019\u201d Wallace tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cI said aloud, \u2018Spirits, if you\u2019re here, give us a sign.\u2019 And three red lines appeared on the screen.\u201d\n\nThe next evening, Wallace\u2019s husband replayed footage of their napping daughter and saw a pink-and-purple figure, shaped like a woman, floating over the bassinet. Other frames showed a group of human-like shapes watching over the sleeping baby.\n\nGary McMath, marketing chief at Cocoon, told the Wall Street Journal that poor installation likely generated the mysterious figures. \u201cWhen the camera is properly installed, the computer vision would focus on the baby\u2019s motions \u2014 waking, sleeping, even breathing,\u201d he said.\n\nMcMath also said curtain movement can create the splotches (though, as the WSJ states, there were no curtains in the baby\u2019s room). \u201cWe have gotten a few calls/emails asking about similar phenomena,\u201d he said.\n\nA company spokesperson tells Yahoo Lifestyle, \u201cOur product, Cocoon Cam, is intended for monitoring children when sleeping to ensure their safety and wellbeing. There are no other intended purposes for Cocoon Cam beyond this prescribed usage.\u201d\n\nWallace, however, suspects that her home is haunted, which she says she confirmed with a medium. \u201cShe said the female figure is one of my grandmothers, who is benevolent,\u201d she tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cThe others are all connected to the home in some way.\u201d\n\nSince Wallace\u2019s images went viral in a local Facebook mom group, she\u2019s (politely) asked any spirits to leave and has considered calling a ghost-hunting group to investigate. \u201cI haven\u2019t turned on the baby monitor all summer,\u201d she admits. \u201cBut I\u2019m ready to look again.\u201d\n\nWoman claims ghost got into bed with her sleeping father\n\nMy dad has been feeling his sheets being messed with and someone sitting on his bed in the night so he set up a camera. This is what he saw. I\u2019m freaked tf out. @Zak_Bagans pic.twitter.com/JJHv4dxqcB \u2014 shy \ud83e\udd40 (@shyannrachael) April 21, 2019\n\nA 24-year-old woman caused panic in April by tweeting footage of her father allegedly sleeping with a ghost. \u201cMy dad has been feeling his sheets being messed with and someone sitting on his bed in the night so he set up a camera,\u201d wrote Shyann Rachael. \u201cThis is what he saw. I\u2019m freaked tf out.\u201d\n\nShe wrote, \u201cLook really closely to the sheets lifting in the beginning on the left of the screen. That wasn\u2019t him! He was dead asleep. And if you look really closely something shoots out of the sheet when it drops to the right and then disappears. It\u2019s gray and kinda looks like a head!??\u201d\n\nIn Rachael\u2019s footage, while her father sleeps, his covers are disturbed as if someone is getting into bed with him. Then, a figure appears to sit up and disappears, while blankets settle back down on the bed.\n\nRachael did not return Yahoo Lifestyle\u2019s requests for comment. But she tweeted that her father used a motion-activated home security camera to capture his strange bedmate.\n\nWhen asked how long her parents have lived in the home, Rachael answered, \u201cLike 10 years but my parents collect antiques and weird old sh*t, so I think they brought something into the house with an attachment.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "Remember the Hobo Hill House?
