They can also free up capital, thus increasing liquidity within a given market as traders look to use their capital elsewhere.\n\nIt\u2019s an investment strategy of using borrowed money for the use of various financial tools to increase the potential return of an investment.\n\nIt\u2019s also an efficient use of trading capital, valued by professionals because it allows them to trade large positions without committing 100 percent of their capital to a risky spot position.\n\nFor example, a trader that wanted to buy a thousand tokens at $1 apiece would only require a $100 of trading capital, depending on the leverage used, thereby leaving the remaining $900 available for additional trades.\n\nWhy leverage matters for bitcoin\n\nOften touted as the most liquid cryptocurrency asset available, BTC benefits from leverage and margin trading activity by allowing investors and traders to lock in a position while maintaining a portfolio of other cryptos. It also provides professionals and retail investors with additional tools to capture value in the crypto market. In effect, greater demand on the asset class vastly improves the potential for more accurate value capture through organic price discovery.\n\nParticipating in a live panel discussion at Invest: ASIA in Singapore, Lennix Lai, financial market director at OKEx told Coindesk:\n\n\u201cIf you can only buy or sell particular underlying tokens of bitcoin and you don\u2019t have the capability to short, basically speculate in another direction, then the market would be a lot more volatile because it would be entirely driven by sentiment.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor example, you can view bitcoin as being much more volatile before CME Futures were introduced \u2026 so we should have more financial instruments like options to assist further in the price discovery process in relation to volatility,\u201d he said.\n\nGreater access to capital means greater liquidity, without actually increasing the number of traders in a given market. It provides a means for increasing capital inflow without attracting any new money.\n\nAnd while the total market capitalization of the crypto market has been on the slide alongside declining total volume, the pressures from a bear market can be offset through leverage and margin trading.\n\nWhat\u2019s the risk?\n\nOf course, the rewards don\u2019t come without inherent risks, as a loss can lead to the liquidation of a trader\u2019s capital and force spot prices lower. Such an event recently took place in BTC\u2019s futures market on Sept. 24 triggering a \u201clong squeeze\u201c.\n\nIf the cryptocurrency underlying a trade moves in the opposite direction to what was expected, leverage can greatly amplify the potential losses. To manage the risk associated, traders usually implement a strict trading style that includes the use of stop orders and limit orders designed to curb potential losses.\n\nAlso speaking on the panel in Singapore, Sunny Ray, head of global business development at the Kraken crypto exchange, explained how exchanges protect themselves from that risk:\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s a lot of volatility in the market, if the value of the asset drops below 20 or 30 percent, there is something called a margin call that takes place where a company will actually liquidate the customer\u2019s assets to cover some of those losses.\u201d\n\nThere are currently eight major exchanges that offer the ability to leverage crypto, with several others offering margin trading accounts such as Kraken, Binance and Deribitm, while Bakkt\u2019s release of its futures product on Sept. 23 adds to the opportunities for more authentic price discoveries.\n\nDisclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency at the time of writing.\n\nBitcoin image via Shutterstock", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.coindesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bitcoin.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
