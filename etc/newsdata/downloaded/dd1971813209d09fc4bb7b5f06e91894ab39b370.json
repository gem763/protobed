We don't put these ideas of the future because we know it doesn't exist. We know that every moment exists - this moment that we have and that we share,' he said.\n\n'If we stay in this open, loving place, this unconditional place, then yes, of course. But you can never tell. We just know that what we feel is real.\n\n'How can you not love this woman? I look at her sometimes and I just can't stop staring at her. I stare for hours.'\n\nSpirit Hacking: Shamanic Keys to Reclaim Your Personal Power, Transform Yourself, and Light Up the World is now on book stands.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Princess Martha Louise of Norway traveled to Venice Beach, California to celebrate the release of boyfriend Shaman Durek's new book, Spirit Hacking, on Tuesday night.", "authors": ["Sandra Clark For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/17/19795976-0-image-a-2_1571241853038.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
