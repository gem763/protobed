The Straits Times\n\nFood is a point of pride for many countries, especially Malaysia.\n\nSo it is understandable that Malaysians are now triggered by the fact that they were not included in a global list of 50 best places for street food \u2013 and Singapore was number one.\n\nPublished in September by CEOWorld magazine, the \u201cWorld\u2019s 50 Best Cities For Street Food-Obsessed Travellers\u201d ranking has left both Malaysians and Singaporeans confused, especially after it was highlighted by travel site TripZilla on Monday (Oct 21).\n\nAlso among the top five were common foodie haunts Bangkok, Hong Kong, Ho Chi Minh and Mumbai. Tokyo and Taipei came in at 19th and 25th respectively.\n\nWhile Singapore and Malaysia\u2019s longstanding food rivalry is not new, Malaysians seem to have taken extra offence that the Lion City \u2013 where selling food on the streets is illegal \u2013 is now number one for its supposed street food.\n\nAccording to CEOWorld, the ranking is based on a survey of 92,000 business travellers and 1,400 corporate travel agents across 86 countries from July to September.\n\nThe 50 cities that were selected had appeared more than once on other similar lists, CEOWorld said. In addition, data was also collected from Google Maps, crowd source database Numbeo, and Unicef.\n\nThe magazine said that the cities were ranked based on four parameters: number of street food vendors, affordability, number of street food experiences and food hygiene. Screengrab for CEOWorld\n\nNeedless to say, netizens were livid in the comments section of Tripzilla\u2019s Facebook post about the ranking. One Facebook user said there was something \u201cvery wrong\u201d with the list, while another demanded an explanation.\n\nOne netizen complained that the survey respondents \u2013 business travellers -were \u201ca crowd not really known for sitting by sweltering roadsides to get some proper street grub\u201d.\n\nAnother netizen argued that Malaysian foods are fresher, cheaper and have more variety \u2013 parameters included in the CEOWorld survey \u2013 as compared to Singapore\u2019s.\n\nMany Singaporeans were also rallying to the side of Malaysians, reasoning that Singapore does not even have street food, since it is illegal to sell food by the street in the country.\n\nOne person asked: \u201cWhat exactly is Singapore street food?\u201d\n\nThere were also many people who were just flat out confused by the list, asking where street food can be found in Singapore.\n\nBut this is not the first time that Malaysia\u2019s delicious street food has been left out while Singapore\u2019s cuisine was celebrated.\n\nEarlier this year, Netflix released a street food series that picked street hawkers from \u201cthe world\u2019s most colourful cities\u201c, including Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines. Malaysia was also excluded from the series.\n\nNetflix said then that Singapore had a \u201crich diversity of ethnic groups\u201d, resulting in a street food culture \u201cunlike any other place in the world\u201d \u2013 much to the ire of Malaysian netizens who argued that their hawker heritage was older and richer than Singapore\u2019s.\n\nBusiness Insider has reached out to CEOWorld for comment on why Malaysia was not included in its ranking.\n\nRead Also:", "description": "Business Insider - Malaysians are saying that there is \"something very wrong\" with the list, which is based on a survey of 92,000 business travellers..
