Viral Press\n\nWith over 20,000 employees, it operates in 16 countries and sends almost 20 million people on holiday each year \u2013 with revenues approaching \u00a310bn.\n\nBut it faces bankruptcy if an extra \u00a3200m in financing cannot be found to cover potential losses during the winter.\n\nThe largest shareholder in Thomas Cook, with 18 per cent of the equity, is the Chinese conglomerate Fosun. In return for injecting \u00a3450m, it is due to take 75 per cent of the company\u2019s tour operating and retail travel business.\n\nMeanwhile a consortium of lenders, led by RBS, would pump in an additional \u00a3450m in return for a 75 per cent stake in Thomas Cook Airlines.\n\nBut late on Thursday, the banks demanded that Thomas Cook arrange an extra \u00a3200m financing facility to see the firm through what is expected to be an extremely tough winter for the UK travel industry.\n\nThomas Cook has been unable to find an outside investor, and the government has refused to underwrite the deal.\n\nThe foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr: \u201cWe don't systematically step in with the taxpayers' money when businesses are going under unless there's a good strategic national interest.\u201d\n\nThe shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long Bailey, insisted: \u201cThe government must consider stepping in and taking an equity stake to avoid this crisis.\"\n\nManuel Cortes, general secretary of the Transport Salaried Staffs\u2019 Association (TSSA), which represents a number of head-office and travel agency staff at Thomas Cook, said: \u201cIt is incumbent upon the government to act if required and save this iconic cornerstone of the British high street and the thousands of jobs that go with it.\u201d\n\nTalks between the holiday firm, the banks and Fosun continued through Sunday at the City of London offices of a law firm, Latham & Watkins.\n\nWhile one insider close to the negotiations indicated it was a \u201cgood sign\u201d that the talks had continued for so long, as it signified a deal could be close, the meeting ended at 5.30pm.\n\nPeter Fankhauser, chief executive of the Thomas Cook Group, declined to comment as he left the building.\n\nMeanwhile, Thomas Cook continued to offer cheap holidays for the remainder of the summer season. One-week packages including flights, transfers and accommodation to Greece or Turkey were available for travel in early October for under \u00a3200.\n\nAt resorts across Europe \u2013 and in the Caribbean and US \u2013 Thomas Cook holidaymakers were wondering when they would fly home.\n\nThe government has vowed to repatriate the estimated 150,000 British travellers on holiday with Thomas Cook if the firm closes.\n\nThe Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is organising an airlift involving dozens of aircraft chartered from a range of airlines \u2013 reportedly including an Airbus A380 \u201cSuperJumbo\u201d belonging to Malaysia Airlines.\n\nBut it is the passengers who have yet to travel who face the greatest stress. They are powerless, and anyone who books an alternative flight to gain certainty risks losing money if Thomas Cook reaches a deal and continues as normal.\n\nUntil the fate of the company is settled, they must plan to head for the airport as normal \u2013 and hope that they do not get a text message or email in the early hours of Monday morning announcing their dream trip has been cancelled.", "description": "Hours before their flights to the sun are due to take off, thousands of Thomas Cook\u00a0customers still do not know if they will be travelling on Monday morning.
