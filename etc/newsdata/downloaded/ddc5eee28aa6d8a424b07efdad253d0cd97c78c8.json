Cummings still not back to work after medical procedure", "language": "en", "text": "ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) \u2014 U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings, of Baltimore, hasn't returned to work after having a medical procedure that he said would only keep him away for about a week.\n\nThe Baltimore Sun reports the Democratic House Oversight and Reform Committee chair is a key figure in the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.\n\nHe missed two roll call votes Thursday, the first day back following a two-week recess. He previously released a statement saying he'd be back by the time the session resumed. The 68-year-old hasn't taken part in a roll call vote since Sept. 11.\n\nThe procedure already caused Cummings to miss a September hearing on Washington, D.C., statehood. His statement didn't detail the procedure. He previously was treated for heart and knee issues. His office has declined to comment.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Baltimore Sun, http://www.baltimoresun.com", "description": "U.S. Rep.
