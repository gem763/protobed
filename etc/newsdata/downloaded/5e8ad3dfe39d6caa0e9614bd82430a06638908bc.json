He struck out eight and improved to 8-0 in 12 career ALDS appearances - he\u2019s 14-7 overall in postseason play.\n\nHe cracked up when told Cash used his performance to turn his name into a verb.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty great compliment,\u201d Verlander said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what else to say, other than that.\u201d\n\nTampa Bay got its only hit off Verlander when Brandon Lowe singled to start the fifth. Verlander ended his day by striking out the side in the seventh, pounding his fist into his glove as he walked off the mound after fanning Lowe.\n\nManager AJ Hinch was asked about Verlander\u2019s knack for getting stronger late in games.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got an incredible instinct for the moment,\u201d he said. \u201cHe leaves some gas in his gas tank at the end of his outings \u2026 like a good sprinter, like at the finish line, he\u2019s going to win. He\u2019s going to win the race at the end of his outings.\u201d\n\nRays starter Tyler Glasnow had given up just three singles when he walked Josh Reddick on four pitches to begin the fifth. He struck out George Springer, but Altuve then tagged him for a two-run homer, lining a fastball into the left field seats.\n\n\u201cI just left that pitch up and it was a two-run home run,\u201d Glasnow said. \u201cHindsight, I would go back and change some things, but can\u2019t do anything about it now.\u201d\n\nThe sellout crowd of 43,360, which included Astros Hall of Famers Nolan Ryan and Craig Biggio, erupted into deafening cheers and fans twirled bright orange towels as Altuve trotted around the bases, a huge grin plastered on his face.\n\nAltuve has homered in Game 1 of the ALDS for three straight years - including three against Boston in the 2017 opener - and the small-but-powerful second baseman now has nine home runs in 33 career postseason games.\n\n\u201cJust breaking through with the big swing for Jose doesn\u2019t surprise me,\u201d Hinch said. \u201cIt\u2019s like clockwork, every ALDS it seems like he busts out with a really good game.\u201d\n\nGame 2 is Saturday when Gerrit Cole, who has won 16 straight decisions and led the majors in strikeouts, starts against Tampa Bay\u2019s Blake Snell.\n\nAltuve\u2019s homer touched off a four-run inning. Brendan McKay took over for Glasnow and allowed a single to Michael Brantley before Alex Bregman knocked one off the wall in left for a double.\n\nChaz Roe relieved with two outs and Yuli Gurriel hit a high popup to shallow right field that Lowe chased from second base as right fielder Austin Meadows also dashed in. Lowe looked to have it, so Meadows pulled up - but the ball glanced off Lowe\u2019s glove for an error that allowed two runs to score to push the lead to 4-0.\n\n\u201cI have to catch it plain and simple,\u201d Lowe said. \u201cI called it and I dropped it. Next time I just have to keep going for it and make a play on it.\u201d\n\nThe Astros added two more runs in the seventh after Bregman walked and stole second base. AL Rookie of the Year candidate Yordan Alvarez and Gurriel followed with RBI doubles to make it 6-0.\n\nTampa Bay hit four home runs in its wild-card win Wednesday at Oakland, but did nothing until Verlander left. Pinch-hitter Eric Sogard had an RBI single of Ryan Pressly with two outs in the eighth and scored on a double by Meadows to cut the lead to 6-2.\n\nGlasnow, who came to the Rays in last year\u2019s trade for Chris Archer that also netted Meadows, looked strong early and Houston\u2019s powerful offense had trouble stringing anything together off him until Altuve\u2019s shot. The Astros loaded the bases with two outs in the third, but the big right-hander struck out Alvarez to end the threat.\n\nThe 26-year-old Glasnow, who was making his playoff debut had missed almost four months with a strained right forearm before his return on Sept. 8, seemed to run out of gas in the fifth. He allowed four hits and two runs with five strikeouts in 4 1/3 innings.\n\nYandy D\u00edaz, who starred with two homers and three hits in the wild-card game, was 0 for 4 with a strikeout.\n\nTHEY SAID IT\n\nBregman on the crowd chanting MVP each time he stepped to the plate: \u201cI get the chills a little bit. It\u2019s been a fun year, and I just want to continue to win games and be able to help this team any way I can.\u201d\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCole is a Cy Young award contender after setting a team record by winning his last 16 decisions and topping the AL with a career-best 2.50 ERA. His career-high 326 strikeouts were the most in the majors and set a franchise record that had stood since 1979 when J.R. Richard fanned 313.\n\nSnell, who won the Cy Young in 2018, is happy to be healthy for the postseason after sitting out from July 22-Sept. 17 after arthroscopic surgery to remove bone chips in his left elbow. Snell didn\u2019t get out of the third inning in any of his three September starts, but believes he\u2019ll be able to go quite a bit longer on Saturday.\n\n\u201cI feel very good,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ll be able to go five strong innings, if I\u2019m in the zone and attacking like I should be.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Asked what went wrong for his Tampa Bay Rays, manager Kevin Cash invented a word.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kristie Rieken"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/04/alds_rays_astros_baseball_33842_c0-157-3760-2349_s1770x1032.jpg?a1abf2296f3f337d7bf5db54f0090f305461f89e", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
