The prosecutor\u2019s office had oversight of investigations into the oligarch who owned the company.\n\nAs The New York Times reported this spring, no evidence has surfaced that the former vice president intentionally tried to help his son by pressing for the prosecutor\u2019s dismissal.\n\nIn fact, some of the vice president\u2019s former associates said he never did anything to deter other efforts to go after the oligarch, Mykola Zlochevsky. Those efforts included a push by Obama administration officials for the United States to support criminal investigations by Ukrainian and British authorities, and possibly for the United States to start its own investigation, into the energy company, Burisma Holdings, and its owner, Mr. Zlochevsky, for possible money laundering and abuse of office.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Us Politics Biden-Ukraine-Trump.Html"], "top_image": ""}
