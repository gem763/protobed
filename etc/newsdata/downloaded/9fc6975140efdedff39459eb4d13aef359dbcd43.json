Heart UK is urging Ministers to introduce blood tests to prevent thousands of needless deaths every year caused by familial hypercholesterolaemia, or FH. The simple blood test proved life-saving for biology teacher Rebecca McKenzie, from Cornwall (pictured with her three children and husband, Will)\n\nNewborns are already given a \u2018heel prick\u2019 test at this time, which screens for a range of potentially serious disorders including cystic fibrosis and thyroid disease.\n\nHeart UK wants the cholesterol test to be carried out at the same time, or else when children receive the MMR jab at 11 months.\n\nProf Hughes says: \u2018The damage caused to arteries from cholesterol begins immediately, so early treatment is essential.\u2019\n\nStatins \u2013 drugs that lower cholesterol \u2013 may be given from as early as ten years old.\n\nA diagnostic test may have saved John and Amanda Wingett the heartache of losing their daughter Rianna, 11, to the condition.\n\nRianna, from Essex, collapsed shortly after finishing a school cross-country run in November 2009. She died despite the frantic efforts of paramedics.\n\nA post-mortem later revealed catastrophically high cholesterol levels \u2013 four times the normal adult amount.\n\nThe schoolgirl, it was discovered, had inherited two copies of the FH faulty gene \u2013 one from each parent \u2013 making her body unable to effectively filter cholesterol from her bloodstream.\n\nNeither of her parents knew they carried the faulty gene. Yet a simple blood test would have detected the condition, prompting life-saving treatment.\n\nStatins, given to millions of people with heart disease, can reduce the amount of cholesterol produced, and are highly effective. Another drug called lomitapide can halve cholesterol levels in those with the most severe form of FH.\n\nIn other cases, a treatment called apheresis, which involves twice-weekly trips to hospital, can filter cholesterol out of the body using a machine.\n\nA diagnostic test may have saved John and Amanda Wingett the heartache of losing their daughter Rianna (above), 11, to the condition. Rianna, from Essex, collapsed shortly after finishing a school cross-country run in November 2009. She died despite the frantic efforts of paramedics\n\nAt present, FH is usually picked up in adults during routine cholesterol testing, or after a patient suffers a heart attack.\n\nA very high cholesterol level is one indicator, and patients may then be offered DNA tests. If FH is discovered, direct relatives, including children, should be screened. But reports show huge discrepancies across the UK due to lack of access to genetic testing centres.\n\nProf Hughes explains: \u2018Many people are unaware of their high cholesterol for years as it\u2019s often symptomless. In the meantime, heart damage builds up, and other family members may be unknowingly affected too.\u2019\n\nAt present, even with treatment, FH shortens life expectancy by about 20 years. Testing children and starting treatment earlier could spare thousands of unnecessary deaths, say experts.\n\nA recent screening programme, involving more than 10,000 babies, picked up twice as many at-risk children than was predicted.\n\nResearchers from several London hospitals successfully identified FH in 40 of the children. Their parents were also tested, prompting yet more diagnoses.\n\nThe simple blood test proved life-saving for biology teacher Rebecca McKenzie and her three children.\n\nStatins (file image), given to millions of people with heart disease, can reduce the amount of cholesterol produced, and are highly effective. Another drug called lomitapide can halve cholesterol levels in those with the most severe form of FH\n\n\u2018Six years ago, I enrolled my son Harrison, who was 11 months at the time, in a medical trial which involved testing him for FH,\u2019 says Rebecca, 41. \u2018I had never heard of it \u2013 I was given a leaflet about it when Harrison went for his MMR jab so I thought, \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\n\u2018The result showed he had the genetic mutation for FH, and his cholesterol level was higher than average for his age.\u2019\n\nThe shock news sparked a series of tests for Rebecca, husband Will, and the rest of the family \u2013 with troubling results. Rebecca and her daughters Lucy, now nine, and Emily, 11, also had the condition. In fact, Lucy\u2019s cholesterol levels were three times higher than normal.\n\n\u2018It was very worrying,\u2019 admits Rebecca, from Redruth, Cornwall. \u2018If she had got to 25 undiagnosed, there would have been considerable build-up in her coronary arteries.\u2019\n\nRebecca and her daughters now take a daily pill \u2013 a statin for the girls and another drug called PCSK9 inhibitor for Rebecca \u2013 and they have also cut down on foods such as ice cream, cheese and chocolate.\n\nSix years on, Emily\u2019s and Rebecca\u2019s levels are considered low. Although Lucy\u2019s levels have been reduced by 60 per cent, they are still high and she needs close monitoring. Meanwhile, Harrison, now seven, is too still young for the pills but it is likely he will have to take them in the future.\n\nOffering all children the test at birth is a \u2018no-brainer\u2019, according to Rebecca. \u2018There isn\u2019t a history of heart disease in my immediate family, so it\u2019s unlikely I would have known,\u2019 she says. \u2018That test saved my children\u2019s lives, and mine too.\u2019", "description": "A simple blood test for the inherited condition familial hypercholesterolaemia proved life-saving for biology teacher Rebecca McKenzie, from Redruth, Cornwall, and her three children (pictured).", "authors": ["Eve Simmons For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/17/19337726-0-image-a-80_1570294349380.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
