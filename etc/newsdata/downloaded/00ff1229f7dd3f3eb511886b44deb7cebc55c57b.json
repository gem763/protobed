Queen was found by animal rescue officers living behind a dumpster and had several medical issues that prevented her from being adopted right away.\n\nAfter more than 400 days at the Great Plains SPCA, Poore was frustrated that this \u201clovable\u201d dog still couldn\u2019t get adopted.\n\n\u201cFor the last year, I\u2019ve been trying to think of creative, out-of-the-box ideas,\u201d Poore tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t figure out why we couldn\u2019t get Queen adopted.\u201d\n\nDay in and day out, Poore would return to the SPCA to find Queen still there. After noticing that Queen was beginning to decline from her extensive shelter stay, the 45-year-old knew it was time to do something big to find Queen a home.\n\nHis solution: to move out of his home until Queen could find hers.\n\nPoore asked the Great Plains SPCA CEO, Tam Singer if he could move into the animal shelter with Queen and document the experience to help find her a suitable family. As crazy as the idea seemed, Singer signed off on the plan immediately, calling it \u201cfantastic.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has the ability to make individual dogs matter. He\u2019s helped so many of our dogs and dogs all over Kansas,\u201d Singer tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cMore than anything, it highlights not only the plight of Queen but so many other dogs. It\u2019s magnificent.\u201d\n\nView photos Scott Poore poses with Queen, a 3-year-old terrier mix, in their room at the Great Plains SPCA in Kansas City.

Queen and Poore currently share a room that measures 8 feet by 5 feet. So far, he says she\u2019s a great roommate \u2014 except for when she wakes him up \u201cevery hour on the hour\u201d when he\u2019s trying to sleep.\n\n\u201cQueen loves having people around. She is so lovable and affectionate,\u201d Poore says laughing. \u201cShe gets up in the middle of the night and wants to play with the tennis ball or play tug-of-war.\u201d\n\nMany people online are shocked at the great lengths Poore is willing to go to get Queen adopted\u2014 but locals aren\u2019t. After feeling unfulfilled personally and professionally, Poore quit his job in 2015 and began volunteering at local animal shelters full time. Since then, he\u2019s become a well-known animal advocate in the Kansas City area working exclusively with pets that have been in shelters the longest.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re kind of the forgotten animal in that shelter,\u201d Poore tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cThey don\u2019t have anyone advocating for them. It\u2019s easy to get a 4-year-old lab adopted.\u201d\n\nPoore even started a clothing line called Mission Driven so he could sustain volunteering at the animal shelters full time, free of charge. But this bold campaign may be his craziest \u2014 and most successful \u2014 one yet, garnering attention nationwide after documenting his stay at the shelter on Facebook.\n\nAs Poore\u2019s campaign for Queen garners thousands of views online, he hopes that people learn that animal shelters are full of amazing pets that \u201cjust desperately want one thing: to be loved.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a misconception that shelter dogs and cats are broken. You may find that some of them are damaged, but they are by no means broken. They\u2019re just not as fortunate as the dogs that we brought home as pups,\u201d says Poore.\n\nWhile the shelter has yet to officially find Queen a \u201cforever home,\u201d Singer and Poore report that they\u2019ve had some promising candidates come through the shelter. Poore insists that his own home \u2014 where he already has a \u201cvery special\u201d dog \u2014isn\u2019t the right place, but he knows that one is right around the corner.", "description": "When a dog named Queen at his local shelter couldn't get adopted for over a year, Scott Poore decided to move in with her until she could move out.", "authors": ["Paulina Cachero"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0lYrLbXva1qU1lqrTboLsg--~B/aD05NjA7dz05NjA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/3d33af50-db1e-11e9-beef-d2e27a63ff81", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
