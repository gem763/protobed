Thirty people were later charged.\n\n\u201cWe have tried petitions, lobbying and marches, and now time is running out,\u201d Australian activist Jane Morton said.\n\nAustralia\u2019s conservative government has resisted adopting new environmental standards and backed lucrative coal exports.\n\nProtests occurred in 60 cities around the world, including New Delhi, Cape Town, Paris, Vienna, Madrid and Toronto.\n\nAt New York\u2019s Battery Park, some 200 demonstrators took part in a \u201cfuneral march\u201d to Wall Street, where protesters threw fake blood over the financial district\u2019s famous bronze statue of a bull.\n\n\u201cWe need imagery like this in order to get people\u2019s attention,\u201d 29-year-old James Comiskey told AFP, as he carried a cardboard coffin in the procession.\n\nPolice arrested around a dozen people who staged a sit-in by the bull.\n\nCampaigners in Dublin wheeled in a pink yacht and parked it outside the office of Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar.\n\n\u201cWe are running out of time,\u201d Dutch protester Shirleen Chin told AFP in Amsterdam.\n\nDutch police said they arrested 90 people after Extinction Rebellion members occupied a bridge outside the famed Rijksmuseum art gallery.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Burn capitalism!\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe movement is partially credited with pushing the UK government in June to become the first in the Europe Union to commit itself to a net-zero target for harmful emissions by 2050.\n\nExtinction Rebellion is demanding governments reach that target by 2025, as well as holding \u201ccitizens assemblies\u201d to decide on policies to achieve that aim.\n\nThe parliament in Norway, not an EU member, in June adopted a target of 2030.\n\nThere has been less movement in other parts of Europe or the most impacted cities of Asia.\n\nAnd not everyone out on the streets was impressed with the campaign.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re taking it out on everyday people trying to go about their business. They should go after big people,\u201d London taxi driver Dave Chandler told AFP.\n\nExtinction Rebellion counters that emergencies like the one heating up the climate demands action from everyone across the world.\n\nHundreds barricaded themselves inside a Paris shopping center for hours over the weekend.\n\nGroups unfurled banners with slogans such as \u201cBurn capitalism, not petrol\u201d above Paris restaurants and fashion boutiques.\n\nAnd hundreds brought blankets and sleeping bags to one of the main roundabouts in central Berlin which police expect to be shut down for many days.\n\nExtinction Rebellion\u2019s tactics in Australia prompted senior conservative politicians to call for protesters\u2019 welfare payments to be cut.\n\nSydney assistant police commissioner Mick Willing accused protesters of putting themselves and others at risk, warning that such disruptive protests in the future would \u201cnot be tolerated\u201d.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Climate protesters from Sydney to New York blocked roads Monday, sparking mass arrests, as they started two weeks of civil disobedience demanding immediate action to save the Earth from \"extinction.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Climate.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
