He was prepared to use force to make it happen, and did in fact end up using force. Stop right there, Trump yelled \u2014 and let me join you in your demand that the Kurds cleanse themselves from the border region, with the killing to resume presumably without objection from the White House if the Kurds don\u2019t comply within five days.\n\nNot only did we side with him, we did it after he\u2019d snubbed the United States repeatedly this year. \u201cIn essence,\u201d writes Eli Lake, \u201cAmerica has agreed to let Turkey solve its Syrian refugee problem by creating a new Kurdish refugee problem.\u201d And it agreed to this at a moment when it had every reason to bear Erdogan a grudge:\n\nThen there is the message this sends to Erdogan himself. The Turkish leader has humiliated Trump and the U.S. in recent weeks and months. He went ahead with the purchase of a Russian S-400 air defense system this summer, over several U.S. objections, and has faced no sanctions. He ordered his military to violate an earlier safe-haven agreement that to which Turkey had previously agreed. His forces fired artillery on a U.S. outpost last week. And he has metaphorically \u2014 and literally, according to the BBC \u2014 thrown Trump\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t be a tough guy\u201d letter into the trash.\n\nLake didn\u2019t even mention the notorious episode from 2017 when Erdogan\u2019s goons stomped American protesters while the Turkish leader was visiting D.C., leaving one demonstrator with brain damage. Trump didn\u2019t care. If Turkey wanted a Kurd-free northern Syria then a Kurd-free northern Syria is what it would get, with America\u2019s blessing.\n\nAll of that \u2014 and Erdogan\u2019s still whining about the letter.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s letter, which did not go hand in hand with political and diplomatic courtesy, has appeared in the media,\u201d Erdogan said Friday during a news conference about the Syria-Turkey cease-fire deal, according to a translation. \u201cOf course we haven\u2019t forgotten it. It would not be right for us to forget it.\u201d\u2026 \u201cFor our relationship, there\u2019s no point to dwell on this letter,\u201d Erdogan told reporters on Friday. \u201cThis is not a priority for us, but when the time comes, we would like it to be known that we will take the necessary steps.\u201d\n\nMaybe this comes with the territory of being a strongman. Sure, Erdogan just pantsed America by getting the president to endorse his ethnic cleansing operation, but many Turks read Trump\u2019s letter. They saw his disrespect towards Erdogan, and by extension towards Turkey, firsthand. A strongman is obliged to avenge a sense of national grievance and to occasionally remind his subjects that he doesn\u2019t treat disrespect lightly. Erdogan\u2019s just checking the box and filing this away as something he can cite opportunistically the next time he makes life difficult for the United States. (\u201cRemember Trump\u2019s letter?\u201d)\n\nIn the meantime, Turkish diplomats are laughing at the president:\n\nIt was inevitable once Trump and Erdogan made their bargain that the president would be stuck defending it with every rhetorical device available to him. One device is to minimize the damage Turkey\u2019s already done to the Kurds, comparing the invasion to a schoolyard fight in which you have to let the kids swing a little before breaking them up. Another device is to simply accept the Turks\u2019 explanation of events at face value so that Americans can be assured that they\u2019re honoring their end of the deal:\n\nJust spoke to President @RTErdogan of Turkey. He told me there was minor sniper and mortar fire that was quickly eliminated. He very much wants the ceasefire, or pause, to work. Likewise, the Kurds want it, and the ultimate solution, to happen. Too bad there wasn\u2019t\u2026.. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 18, 2019\n\n\u2026.I have just been notified that some European Nations are now willing, for the first time, to take the ISIS Fighters that came from their nations. This is good news, but should have been done after WE captured them. Anyway, big progress being made!!!! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 18, 2019\n\nAs a response to this, watch the \u201cFox & Friends\u201d clip below from this morning featuring Griff Jenkins, who\u2019s talking to sources in Syria. Jenkins appears to doubt whether there\u2019s been any ceasefire at all and blames the continued assault on Turkish proxies, specifically the Free Syrian Army. It may be that Erdogan has agreed to hold back regular Turkish military forces for five days while quietly authorizing irregular forces to continue the advance, assuring Trump that he can\u2019t control them and claiming that in any case there\u2019s not much shooting happening anyway. Meanwhile, a spokesman for Kurdish forces has told the media that it can\u2019t and won\u2019t comply with Trump\u2019s deal by withdrawing from the border area until Turkey stops bombing the town of Ras al-Ayn, which is where most of the fighting in Jenkins\u2019s report is happening. For his part, Erdogan warned today that if the Kurds aren\u2019t gone when the ceasefire expires in four days the invasion will resume. It might be a hairy 96 hours.\n\nOn top of all that, WaPo is reporting that ISIS attacks have picked up in northern Syria as jihadis try to capitalize on the chaos to reestablish themselves. Erdogan and Putin are set to meet on Tuesday to try to figure some of this out. Stay tuned.", "description": "\"When the time comes, we would like it to be known that we will take the necessary steps.\u201d", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/e-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
