It\u2019s held together by duct-tape and twine, but it spits fire, looks cool, and goes really, really fast.\n\nAnd I almost refused to review it once I started playing it, but we\u2019ll get into that later.\n\nBorderlands 3 feels like a tight, gonzo shooter. The controls are responsive and intuitive. As far as shooters go, once you dial in the aiming options you\u2019re comfortable with it feels as good as anything out there. Each weapon feels unique and the combination of aesthetic differences and clever use of your controller\u2019s vibration function really lends to the total immersion. You\u2019ll end up tapping the \u201cswitch weapon\u201d button and instantly knowing what your character is holding just by how it \u201cfeels\u201d when you fire it.\n\nThe best thing about Borderlands 3 is that it\u2019s the perfect game for people who like to play alone sometimes, with friends online sometimes, and with their buddy (or, in my case, fiancee) sitting on the couch next to them. You can always jump in and out of each other\u2019s games without any muss or fuss. Up to 4 people online or 2 offline in split-screen mode can play through the entire story mode and several other game modes. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re at different places in the campaign, or what respective levels you and your friends\u2019 characters are, you can play together. It\u2019s brilliant.\n\nMy only beef with game-play lies in the god awful freezing issue that happens in split-screen mode whenever a player brings up or interacts with a menu. If you\u2019re shooting and your partner uses a menu it causes your screen to freeze for a few seconds. This also happened in Borderlands 2 and the Pre-Sequel. It\u2019s not a deal-breaker by any means, but it\u2019s incredibly immersion-breaking.\n\nAnd immersion is important because the story behind Borderlands 3 is huge \u2013 there\u2019s lore shoved into every nook and cranny of the universe.\n\nYou can enjoy the crap out of Borderlands with the sound turned down and the subtitles turned off, if you\u2019re so inclined. It\u2019s a great shooter, has great inventory and menu management systems, and it\u2019s frickin\u2019 gorgeous. But where it truly shines is in the clever, nuanced writing and heartfelt examinations on humanity that make up its campaign story.\n\nYour character is a Vault Hunter. That\u2019s a Borderlands way of saying \u201cadventurer who seeks treasure.\u201d The character you choose has their own backstory, hours worth of quips and reaction dialogue, and a unique skill tree that allows them to utilize special powers, gadgets, devices, or magic that only they can use. The four characters are very different from one another, and all are fun to play.\n\nOf course, the non-binary robot Beastmaster, FL4K, is my favorite. FL4K uses they/them pronouns and seems intentionally written to represent the queer struggle of non-binary humans. Gearbox has always focused on making mostly inclusive games that go out of their way to show love and support to the LGBTQPIA+ community.\n\nBut I main the Gunner, Moze (her special ability summons a giant mecha with customizable guns that she can pilot for a few minutes at a time). Rounding out the list are the Siren (a badass, take-no-guff magical warrior) and a secret agent who can summon an attack drone, a digital clone, or a giant force field. Each one is worth playing just to see their unique NPC interactions and unfolding backstories.\n\nThe game\u2018s voice acting is top-notch. Borderlands 2 was nominated for several awards for its cast and I assume Borderlands 3 will be too. Veteran fans might cringe a tiny bit at some of the replacements (Claptrap), but even those are well-done and the new cast members do the franchise justice.\n\nBut the most important \u201ccharacter\u201d in the Borderlands universe isn\u2019t a person, it\u2019s the series\u2019 trademark humor. Gearbox\u2019s writers have always managed to make Borderlands raunchy, but self-aware. It straddles the line between Grand Theft Auto\u2019s \u201cI just don\u2019t give a\u2026\u201d sense of humor and Saints Row\u2019s delightful nonsense. I absolutely love most of it. It\u2019s dark without trying to be edgelord-esque and surprisingly heartfelt.\n\nThere are plenty of laugh out loud moments and the vast array of \u201cgood\u201d characters are diverse, well-written, and full of heart. You spend the majority of the game caught between different NPC\u2019s motivations, sometimes changing targets or goals in mid-quest simply because fate is fickle and lovers become enemies \u2013 I won\u2019t spoil anything, but you\u2019ll attend to many an NPCs interpersonal relationships throughout the course of the game.\n\nBorderlands 3\u2019s central theme is about how power, or the lack of, drives how we treat one another. There\u2019s a deep, meaningful story that plays out beneath the potty jokes and hyper-sexual undercurrent. It\u2019s a tale of redemption, inner-strength, and realizing that love and loyalty are the strongest \u201cpowers\u201d or \u201cweapons\u201d in our arsenal.\n\nBorderlands 3 is a beautiful story full of diversity and humor. But it\u2019s also an ableist nightmare. Dozens upon dozens of characters in the franchise are disabled. But not all are equal. Characters who are born \u201cnormal,\u201d that end up disabled \u2013 amputees, for example \u2013 are typically portrayed as deep, meaningful characters. Characters who are born \u201cdifferent\u201d \u2013 people with dwarfism, for example \u2013 are portrayed as cannon-fodder, psychotic, mindless, or evil. This isn\u2019t a hard and fast rule, but to be honest I\u2019m gobsmacked by the sheer ridiculousness of it.\n\nLet\u2019s take the game\u2018s first boss, Shiv, for example:\n\nUnlike one of the main villains, who has a cybernetic robot arm, Shiv\u2019s disability isn\u2019t a superpower he gained through some injury or accident that makes him stronger: it\u2019s a mockery. He\u2019s the first (and thus weakest) boss in the game. I felt a little gross seeing his splash screen, but that\u2019s nothing compared to the \u201ctinks.\u201d\n\nPrevious Borderlands games had an enemy unit called \u201cmidgets.\u201d They\u2019re about half the height of other enemy units and, typically, a bit more powerful. This makes it doubly hard to kill them: one, they\u2019re tough and two, you\u2019re not used to aiming so low. In the heat of battle, it\u2019s a bit of a pain to take them out because it requires an adjustment.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem: there are no good \u201cmidgets\u201d in the Borderlands universe (at least not featured prominently enough as to be memorable by comparison). That means a Google search for \u201cBorderlands midgets\u201d brings up a litany of message board results about how much people \u201chate\u201d the \u201clittle\u201d enemies.\n\nAmid a decade of complaints, Gearbox didn\u2019t choose to remove them or include sympathetic, positive representations of people with dwarfism to balance the mindless representation \u2013 no, the company didn\u2019t give players with dwarfism a way to see themselves represented in a video game positively. Instead they changed the unit\u2019s name from \u201cmidgets\u201d to \u201ctinks.\u201d This sucks, it\u2019s awful, and it does not pass the substitution test.\n\nWhether you call them by socially acceptable terms (is \u201ctink\u201d even that?) or denigrating ones (such as \u201cmidget\u201d), the problem remains the same. If someone made a game where all of the representations of people of a specific race or sexuality were psychotic enemies, and there were thousands of them to kill, there\u2019d likely be more outrage.\n\nIn the words of Peter Dinklage:\n\nLaughing at dwarfism is the last acceptable prejudice \u2013 but don\u2019t seek my approval for your intolerance.\n\nI struggled with the decision to post this review because here\u2019s the deal: Borderlands 3 is on my shortlist for 2019\u2019s game of the year, it\u2019s fantastic. But the ableist bullshit that\u2019s hardcoded into the franchise\u2019s DNA is becoming a deal-breaker.\n\nLet me be clear: nobody cares that they made a game where anyone, regardless of who they are or how tall they are, can be an enemy. Everyone can be an enemy in the Borderlands world, that\u2019s great. I\u2019m upset that only certain people can be sympathetic characters and the franchise goes out of its way to be ableist in its depictions of good and evil.\n\nI want to love this game. Aside from the glaring ableism, it\u2019s full of heart and soul and the writers obviously care deeply for the world they\u2019ve created \u2013 even making it a diverse and welcoming place for most people. The wonderful writing and obvious efforts towards inclusivity is why I ultimately chose to complete my review. There\u2019s a lot of good here.\n\nI just don\u2019t get how \u201ctinks\u201d and \u201cShiv\u201d and other ableist crap made it into the game. It distracts from something that, otherwise, would be a beacon for the industry.\n\nRead next: Someone got Doom running on a McDonald's cash register", "description": "", "authors": ["Tristan Greene"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2Fbl3feat.jpg&signature=64ddf0d5eb27733e785af99bac10c5b4", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
