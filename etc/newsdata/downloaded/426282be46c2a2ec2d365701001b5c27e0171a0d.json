His study, which was debunked and found to be fraudulent, was retracted by The Lancet after publication. Wakefield was subsequently stripped of his medical license.\n\nThe numbers that matter: The Selz Foundation currently funds about 75% of the Informed Consent Action Network (ICAN) and donated $100,000 \u2014 83% of the charity\u2019s funding \u2014 the year it was established, per the Post.\n\nLisa Selz serves as the network's president, while its founder Del Bigtree \"promotes the idea that government officials have colluded with the pharmaceutical industry to cover up grievous harms\" from drugs found in vaccines, the Post reports.\n\nThe bottom line: ICAN is currently the best-funded organization that amplifies concerns about vaccines, largely thanks to the Selz's funding, the Post reports.\n\nGo deeper: Measles outbreak this year has been worst of the century", "description": "The current measles outbreak is the worst of the century.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/sakQ5_zsVQrb7gaMevr9H34GthQ=/0x575:5460x3646/1920x1080/2019/06/19/1560962421748.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-19"}
