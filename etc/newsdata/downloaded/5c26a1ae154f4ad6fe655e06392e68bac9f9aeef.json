The service will let customers rent or buy movies, much in the same way Apple\u2019s iTunes Store and Amazon\u2019s Prime Video have operated for years.\n\nAMC Theaters on Demand, as it will be called, will launch tomorrow as an online store with approximately 2,000 films available, with new releases to be added after a standard theatrical run. Unlike the direct-to-consumer subscription streaming services that companies like Disney, Apple, Comcast (NBCUniversal), and AT&T (WarnerMedia) are preparing to launch, AMC\u2019s is specifically video-on-demand (VOD).\n\nStudios like Disney, Warner Bros., Universal Pictures, Sony Pictures, and Paramount have all entered deals with the theater chain to sell and rent movies \u2014 both new releases and older titles \u2014 once their theater run ends. Each film will cost between $3 and $5.99 to rent, and $9.99 to $19.99 to purchase.\n\nAMC will charge between $3 and $5.99 to rent and $9.99 and $19.99 to purchase\n\nThe idea behind AMC Theaters on Demand is to bolster the chain\u2019s main business venture: theater attendance. The company wants to capitalize on its AMC Stubs members, including its A-List subscribers that now pay around $20 a month for general access to new films, a model that was spurred by now-defunct MoviePass.\n\nYet there are also more than 20 million households who subscribe to AMC\u2019s more general Stubs loyalty program, according to the Times. Offering those members additional benefits, including a free digital version of a movie they paid to see in theaters, is one way to introduce more people to AMC\u2019s Theaters on Demand service, while also encouraging those same consumers to actually go to a theater showing.\n\nMore than 6 million tickets for Disney\u2019s The Lion King were purchased through the Stubs program, the Times adds. Those people \u201cwill all get a personalized message from AMC saying that they can now enjoy it at home through AMC Theaters On Demand,\u201d when the movie is digitally released on Tuesday, according to Elizabeth Frank, AMC\u2019s chief content officer. Although it\u2019s a new practice for AMC, other theater chains have practiced it. Cineplex, one of the top theater chains in Canada, has offered a similar program for years. AMC is the first major American chain to offer the program, though.\n\nThe streaming service comes at an interesting time for AMC and other Hollywood studios. The theater chain has butt heads with Netflix over carrying the latter\u2019s original films, including Martin Scorsese\u2019s most recent movie, The Irishman. Netflix, and often times other companies like Amazon, don\u2019t want to comply with AMC\u2019s 12-week theatrical window policy. The rule states that Netflix (and other streaming services) can\u2019t stream a film until it\u2019s played for 12-weeks exclusively in theaters. Netflix has never agreed to the terms, and has used smaller theater chains to play its movies in theaters for shorter windows, ranging from a few days to a few weeks.\n\nLaunching a video-on-demand streaming service with major studios\u2019 backing helps AMC get into the digital market while also ensuring its ongoing relationships with the five major studios, as well as the value of a ticket stub, remains intact.", "description": "AMC Theaters, the largest movie theater chain in the US, is launching an on-demand streaming service, according to The New York Times.
