I accept that my language was wholly inappropriate to express my disagreement with the decision and sincerely regret the manner in which I did so,\" read a statement issued on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nLast month, Mashile ruled that Moyo's June axing was unlawful.\n\nAddressing media on Friday, Manuel said Old Mutual had been hamstrung by Judge Mashile's ruling, which barred the firm from appointing a new CEO.\n\n\"If you take a board imbued with the responsibility and accountability and you get that overturned by a single individual who happens to wear a robe, I think you have a bit of a difficulty,\" Manuel said during a press conference.\n\nIt was the first time that Manuel and the board had publicly spoken out about the ongoing legal battle with Moyo.\n\nDiscomfort 'understandable'\n\n\"My unguarded observation, although withdrawn, has understandably caused discomfort, for which I apologise unreservedly, to the honourable judge presiding and to my fellow South Africans,\" he said.\n\nOld Mutual is appealing the court's ruling that it should reinstate Moyo.\n\nMoyo has twice been served notice of termination of employment by the financial services firm. His first termination came in June, with Old Mutual citing a conflict of interest which led to a breakdown of trust between the parties. The dismissal led to a bruising legal battle which saw the company preventing Moyo from returning to his old job despite the court ruling.\n\nThe company in August issued Moyo with a further notice of termination. According to Old Mutual, Moyo has not legally challenged the second axing and it should be considered valid.", "description": "Old Mutual chair Trevor Manuel has apologised for his \"inappropriate\" remark about a judge who delivered a ruling against the company in litigation involving its axed CEO Peter Moyo.", "authors": ["Sibongile Khunalo"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8746/461b3fb5c0a44e47bfdab29440280cb0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
