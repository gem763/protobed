Ilhan Omar (D-MN) said Americans don\u2019t like being reminded that \u201cwe have been a villain\u201d with respect to the U.S. government\u2019s foreign policy.\n\nA partial transcript is as follows:\n\nSAMANTHA BEE: Representative Omar is doing work. She\u2019s trying to end our drone wars, trying to get us to stop supporting dictators, and speaking out against how we aren\u2019t taking refugees in. You know, audaciously suggesting American actions be in line with American morals.\n\nREP. ILHAN OMAR: We\u2019re very comfortable being the hero in every story. We are not comfortable anytime somebody reminds us we have been a villain. It\u2019s my job to make sure we can end this story as a hero.\n\nBEE: Why is that important to you?\n\nOMAR: When I escaped war at the age of eight, lived in a refugee camp for four years, I know what destruction looks like. Now, I\u2019m a member of Congress. I am, in so many ways, the American story.\n\nBEE: Oh, what a great movie that would be. I wonder which white person they\u2019ll cast to play the hero.\n\nOMAR: Maybe Dakota Fanning?\n\nBEE: She\u2019d be great.", "description": "Ilhan Omar said Americans don't like being reminded that \"we have been a villain\" with respect to the U.S. government's foreign policy.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1177079053-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
