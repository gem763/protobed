Fortnite raked in $2.4 billion in revenue in 2018, more than any other single title, according to Nielsen data.\n\nAfter the runaway successes of those games, gaming giant Electronic Arts launched the similarly-themed Apex Legends earlier this year.\n\nThe mobile version of Activision's long-running \"Call of Duty\" franchise was also launched on Oct. 1, and has already racked up 125 million unique downloads and generated more than $28 million in gross player spending, according to app data website SensorTower.\n\nSpending on Fortnite has fallen 23% since the launch of Call of Duty, the website's data also showed.
