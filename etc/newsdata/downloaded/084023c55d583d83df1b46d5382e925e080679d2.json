As French military and intelligence services scrambled to the scene, another theory quickly emerged: that AF1611 had been shot down by a surface-to-air missile fired from a French navy vessel.\n\nFor 51 years, evidence pointing to the plane being shot down has been a military secret. This year, as passengers\u2019 families gather in Nice to remember their loved ones, as they have done for the last 50 years, they are still waiting for the French government to declassify documents and discover the truth.\n\n\u201cWe think we know anyway, but we need to hear it,\u201d Margaret O\u2019Connor, 71, told the Guardian. \u201cWe don\u2019t understand how they can keep it a secret after 51 years.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Arthur O\u2019Connor with his daughter Margaret and wife, Kathleen.

It\u2019s like a splinter that never goes away.\n\n\u201cIt was the cold war and a very different era when the crash happened, so I can understand why they classified it at the time. But now, half a century later, they have to put us through this every September. I just want it to stop.\u201d\n\nThe Caravelle was over the Mediterranean where a military exercise was taking place when air traffic control received a distress call then a final communication from the plane: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do. We\u2019re going to crash if this happens.\u201d\n\nAfterwards, documents and photographs that could have shed light on the crash disappeared. The 11 September page in the log book for a French navy vessel in the area, Le Suffren, was torn out. Families were told the black box flight recorder was damaged; all previous flight data was recoverable but the recording of AF1611 was unreadable. Wreckage brought up from the sea bed was immediately confiscated by France\u2019s military authorities.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Wreckage from the crash was confiscated.

The Caravelle was shot down. We brought down a civil aircraft instead of the programmed target,\u201d Laty said.\n\nAn official inquiry, however, concluded a fire had started in the plane toilet. Today, a new eight-year investigation by gendarmes who seized previously unseen evidence has reportedly found otherwise.\n\nSt\u00e9phane Nesa, one of two lawyers representing passengers\u2019 families, said the fire theory was nonsense. \u201cThis has been discredited for 45 years. It is completely and technically impossible,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe investigating judge has written to the government asking them to lift the \u2018defence secret\u2019 classification, but it has been over a year and we have had no response. The longer the government continues in this way, the more we feel they don\u2019t want to establish the truth more than 50 years after the facts.\u201d\n\nNesa added: \u201cThere were 95 people on that plane who died including children. Their families don\u2019t want money, they want to know the truth.\u201d\n\nMathieu Paoli, 75, and his brothers Louis, 72 ,and Jacques, 81, lost their mother Toussainte, 59, and father Ange-Marie, 60, in the crash.\n\n\u201cThe investigating judge has said he is practically certain to almost 100% that the plane was hit by a missile. Now we are waiting,\u201d Mathieu said.\n\n\u201cSome people ask us, what are you looking for, you will never know. I tell them, our parents are at the bottom of the sea and we cannot do our grieving without knowing exactly what happened to them.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Wreckage is recovered from the crash. Photograph: Dalmas/Sipa/REX/Shutterstock\n\nThe O\u2019Connor sisters say they rarely speak of the accident, but it is a wound that reopens every anniversary.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always there,\u201d Serena said. \u201cI was too small at the time to remember much about our father, but I remember the realisation that we were on our own. Our mother, who died 15 years ago, was left widowed in her early 40s with four children. She never talked about it, but it always played on her mind. She was heartbroken.\u201d\n\nMargaret added: \u201cWhile he was away he wrote postcards to each of us and they kept coming for about three weeks afterwards \u2026 It\u2019s strange that with so many people on the plane whose families have been pushing to know the truth and all this time later we still don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nThe French defence ministry did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s requests for information except to say it was for the armed forces minister, Florence Parly, to decide on declassification.\n\nOn Tuesday, 24 hours before the anniversary, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, wrote to the Paoli brothers saying he hoped the affair would be declassified and that he had asked Parly to begin the process of releasing documents related to the crash.\n\nFor Mathieu Paoli, establishing the truth remains his life\u2019s mission.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want money, we don\u2019t want to blame anyone, we don\u2019t even want a sorry \u2026 We are waiting to hear the truth. We have waited for 51 years.\u201d", "description": "Relatives of the 95 people who died believe it was hit by missile and hope documents confirming this will soon be declassified", "authors": ["Kim Willsher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1793eac17f1e8590722f774850fa7159028470f7/47_857_3855_2313/master/3855.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=125ae6ee5cbb7140c8b328fe45c1f91f", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
