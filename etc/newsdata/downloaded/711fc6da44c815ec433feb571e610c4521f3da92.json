But it's a strange case that involves copyright lawyers, a petulant developer, and a behind-the-scenes look into how tech titans like Facebook, Spotify, and Netflix make the sausage.\n\nIt all starts with a developer named Azer Ko\u00e7ulu, who wrote a piece of code called Kik, an extension for the popular programming language Node.js. Ko\u00e7ulu put his Kik module up on NPM, essentially an App Store for Node.js programmers, as a free download for developers to work into their apps at their leisure.\n\nThe other Kik\n\nKik, the popular social network of the same name, took notice and sent Ko\u00e7ulu an email requesting that he change the name of his module. By Ko\u00e7ulu's own admission in a blog post, Kik's initial request was reasonable. Still, Ko\u00e7ulu wouldn't budge.\n\n\"When I started coding Kik, didn't know there is a company with same name. And I didn't want to let a company force me to change the name of it,\" Ko\u00e7ulu writes.\n\nKo\u00e7ulu also told Business Insider that Kik then \"threatened\" him after his initial refusal, sending him an email saying:\n\nWe don't mean to be a dick about it, but it's a registered Trademark in most countries around the world and if you actually release an open source project called kik, our trademark lawyers are going to be banging on your door and taking down your accounts and stuff like that\n\nAfter Ko\u00e7ulu refused to change the name, Kik reached out to NPM, and Ko\u00e7ulu says that CEO Isaac Schlueter took away his ownership of the module in question without asking.\n\nThen, Ko\u00e7ulu announced in that blog entry that he was removing his Kik from NPM entirely \u2014 as well as all of his other code.\n\nKik creator Ted Livingston. Michael Seto/Business Insider Ignition\n\nThis might not have been a big deal in itself, except Ko\u00e7ulu is also the person who created a popular NPM module called \"npm left-pad.\" It's 11 lines long and doesn't actually do anything complicated, but it's been downloaded over 575,000 times.\n\nAnd when it vanished, developers on Reddit, Twitter, and elsewhere definitely took notice.\n\nA house of cards\n\nThis is where things get sticky.\n\nA module like npm left-pad is basically a shortcut so a developer doesn't have to write a whole bunch of basic code from scratch. If a developer calls on an NPM module, it's basically shorthand for \"put this code in later,\" and a software compiler will just download the code when the time is right.\n\nMost of the time, this works just fine. But sometimes, software ends up relying on what's essentially a house of cards: One Node.js module calls on another, calls on another, calls on another. Again, usually it works fine \u2014 right up until npm left-pad is taken offline.\n\nReuters/Fabrizio Bensch\n\nBoom \u2014 down went the house of cards. Popular software projects like Babel, which helps Facebook, Netflix, and Spotify run code faster, and React, which helps developers build better interfaces, were suddenly broken and no more work could be done with them. Overall, over a thousand software projects were affected, according to the npm blog.\n\nFixing the problem would require that programmers sift through all of those dependencies, making sure that absolutely nothing relied on that one 11-line bit of code.\n\nAnd so, after a mass outcry from developers all over the world, NPM was forced to \"un-un-publish\" the code in question, handing it over to a new owner.\n\nIn a series of Twitter posts, NPM CTO Laurie Voss says that the company wasn't totally comfortable handing over what's still Ko\u00e7ulu's intellectual property, but much of the software industry had ground to a halt over the issue.\n\nAll told, the storm is over, and npm left-pad is back online. But the wounds are still deeply felt: \"Have We Forgotten How To Program,\" asks one blog entry urging developers to rethink how they build their apps.\n\nKo\u00e7ulu told Business Insider, \"Although I feel very sorry for interrupting people's work, I did it for the benefit of the community in long term. NPM's monopoly won't be dictated to the free software community anymore.\"", "description": "It all starts with a developer named Azer Ko\u00e7ulu, who wrote a piece of code called Kik, an extension for the popular programming language Node.js.", "authors": ["Matt Weinberger"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/56f32f4291058424008b86b8-480-240.jpg", "published_at": "2016-03-23"}
