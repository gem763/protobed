Unfortunately, floods in 2006 closed down its use and since has stood standstill instead as a tourist attraction rather than a functional route.\n\nBut it hasn't been forgotten, and on Wednesday it received a reward for its architectural prowess - the 2019 National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark of the Year.\n\nSEE: When you manage a hotel that is a train on a bridge in Kruger, dreaming up crazy ideas are the norm\n\nAwarded by the South African Institution of Civil Engineering (SAICE), a plaque was unveiled at Dolphin's Point overlooking the historic bridge, reported the George Herald. The bridge was designed by then-Transnet and the resident engineer was NK Prette-John.\n\nThis accolade could help boost tourism in the area, though it is advised not to walk on the bridge due to safety concerns.\n\nThe award is granted to landmarks that are over a hundred years old, still in existence and has made a notable contribution to the welfare and economy of a community. They should also be reasonably accessible to the public and have a well-recorded history.\n\nThrough the awards, recognition is given to the engineers as well as provide a platform for the preservation of these landmarks.\n\nWATCH: The V&A's new 55 ton swing bridge, with 50 second full rotation - officially open\n\nThe Kaaimansrivier Railway Bridge.
