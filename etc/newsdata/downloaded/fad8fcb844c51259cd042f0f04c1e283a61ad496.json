It follows a similar Microsoft statement not naming the targets.\n\nThe threat group, dubbed \u201cPhosphorous,\u201d attempted to hack into accounts associated with Trump\u2019s reelection campaign, sources familiar with the matter said Friday.\n\nEarlier, Microsoft issued a press release describing the alleged Iran-linked attacks.

In the wake of the Russiagate affair, cybersecurity professionals have advised against attributing cyberattacks to state actors, warning that both the origin and the telltale signs of the nationals involved could be masked or even planted to fool the target. This has not stopped companies like CrowdStrike, who\u2019ve made their reputation on such attributions.\n\nAlso on rt.com CIA wrote code 'to impersonate' Russia\u2019s Kaspersky Lab anti-virus company, WikiLeaks says\n\nDETAILS TO FOLLOW", "description": "A hacking group allegedly linked to Tehran targeted US President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection campaign but was \"unsuccessful,\" claims a Reuters report citing sources.
