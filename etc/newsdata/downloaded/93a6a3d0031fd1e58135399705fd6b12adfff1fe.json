It\u2019s not.\n\nDogged by uneasiness over trade frictions and weak global growth, the American economy\u2019s growth inched lower over the summer. Gross domestic product \u2013 the broadest measure of goods and services produced in the economy \u2013 grew at a 1.9 percent annual rate for the third quarter, according to preliminary data released by the Commerce Department on Wednesday\u2026. The year started out with a surge, but the pace of growth declined in the spring and again over the period that spanned July, August and September.\n\nTo be sure, 1.9% growth isn\u2019t awful. In fact, this morning\u2019s figure is a bit better than projections headed into the announcement.\n\nThe GDP figure is, however, down a little from the second quarter, which was down from the first quarter. What\u2019s more, growth in the third quarter of 2019 is down a full percentage point from growth over the same three-month period from last year.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, this morning\u2019s figures \u2013 which will be revised in the coming months \u2013 suggest the president will again fail to produce annual growth between 4% and 6%, which is what he inexplicably promised during the 2016 campaign.\n\nIndeed, Candidate Trump repeatedly lambasted Barack Obama for being \u201cthe first president in modern history not to have a single year of 3% growth.\u201d And yet, here we are: in Trump\u2019s first year, growth reached 2.3%; in his second year it reached 2.5%; and barring an extraordinary and unexpected shift, economic growth will almost certainly fall short of 3% again in the Republican\u2019s third year.\n\nMaking matters slightly worse, U.S. job growth has slowed since Trump took office.\n\nAs for the image above, the chart shows GDP numbers by quarter since the Great Recession began. The red columns show the economy under the Bush and Trump administrations; the blue columns show the economy under the Obama administration.", "description": "Remember when Candidate Trump promised to produce annual economic growth between 4% and 6%?
