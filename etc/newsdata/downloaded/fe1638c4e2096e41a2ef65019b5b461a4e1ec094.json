But the scent of money has drawn gangs and hyperviolent cartels that have hung bodies from bridges and cowed police forces, and the rising violence is threatening the newfound prosperity. A recent U.S. warning that it could withdraw orchard inspectors sent a shiver through the $2.4 billion-a-year export industry.\n\nSome growers are taking up arms. At the checkpoint in San Juan Parangaricutiro, the vigilantes are calm but attentive. They say their crop is worth fighting for.\n\n\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for avocados, I would have to leave to find work, maybe go to the United States or somewhere else,\u201d said one of guards, Pedro de la Guante, whose small avocado orchard earns him far more than he would get from any other legal \u2013 or illegal \u2013 crop.\n\nCrashing the wedding party:David's Bridal wants to remake itself after bankruptcy\n\nIt's not retirement; it's unemployment:Don't forget that if you're reluctant to save\n\nThis Oct. 3, 2019 photo shows mounds of dirt and rock placed there by vigilantes in a zigzag pattern on the highway leading in from Jalisco, on the outskirts of Tepalcatepec, Michoacan state, Mexico.

While the agency didn\u2019t specify what happened, local authorities say a gang robbed the truck the inspectors were traveling in at gunpoint.\n\n\u201cFor future situations that result in a security breach, or demonstrate an imminent physical threat to the well-being of APHIS personnel, we will immediately suspend program activities,\u201d the USDA wrote in a letter, referring to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.\n\nSuch a move could block shipments and devastate the industry that supplies U.S. consumers hungry for guacamole and avocado toast. It was only in 1997 that the U.S. lifted a ban on Mexican avocados that had been in place since 1914 to prevent a range of weevils, scabs and pests from entering U.S. orchards.\n\nThis Oct. 2, 2019 photo shows a sculpture of an avocado at the town's entrance in Ziracuaretiro, Michoacan state, Mexico. (Photo: Marco Ugarte, AP)\n\nTrump declares 'big success' in Syria: Lifts sanctions on Turkey\n\nThe Michoacan-based Avocado Growers and Packers Association published the warning letter from the USDA \u2013 an unusual move that some in Uruapan interpreted as a gesture aimed at making criminals aware they risk killing off the state\u2019s biggest money-making industry if U.S. inspectors stop approving exports. Neither the avocado association nor the USDA responded to requests for comment.\n\nThe police chief in a town in western Mexico\u2019s avocado belt described what life is like with the Viagras cartel. The chief asked that his name not be used. The Viagras are so thoroughly present that he doesn\u2019t venture into nearby Uruapan without a phalanx of armed bodyguards. The Michoacan-based cartel derives its unusual name from their founders\u2019 habit of combing so much gel into their hair that it stands up on end.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve done everything \u2013 extortions, protection payments. They\u2019ve flown drones over us,\u201d said the chief. \u201cThey come in and want to set up (drug) laboratories in the orchards.\u201d\n\nIn this Oct. 3, 2019 photo, police stand guard on the outskirts of Tepalcatepec, Michoacan state, Mexico. (Photo: Marco Ugarte, AP)\n\nUK police: 39 people have been found dead in a truck container in southeast England\n\nBut the Viagras are now also the hunted. The vicious Jalisco New Generation cartel is trying to move into Michoacan on several fronts. In August, the cartel hung nine bodies from an overpass in Uruapan, and left 10 more corpses hacked up or dumped by the road. On the overpass they hung a banner saying: \u201cBe a Patriot, Kill a Viagra.\u201d\n\nFarther south, in the hotter, lime-growing region of Michoacan, Jalisco cartel gunmen ambushed and killed 13 state police officers in mid-October. The attack so terrified police that when they went to collect the dead officers\u2019 burned vehicles, they worked so hastily they left behind a crushed, charred, bullet-perforated skull.\n\nCartels, police and vigilantes alike are spooked by the Jalisco cartel onslaught.\n\nIn the cattle-ranching town of Tepalcatepec, which lies on the border with Jalisco state, heavily armed vigilantes \u2013 apparently in the employ of a local gang \u2013 mount a 24-hour guard in a sniper post atop a hill guarding against incursions by the Jalisco cartel. One vigilante with an assault rifle slung over his shoulder, who refused to give his name, came down from the hilltop to scare away a news photographer. \u201cClear out of here! Don\u2019t you know you have a .50-caliber (rifle) aimed at your head?\u201d\n\nIn this Oct. 3, 2019 photo, a vigilante walks down from a sniper post where he guards against thieves and drug cartel extortionists, on the outskirts of Tepalcatepec, in Mexico's state of Michoacan, the heartland of world production of the fruit locals call \"green gold.\" (Photo: Marco Ugarte, AP)\n\nAs in much of Michoacan, the violence is largely hidden by a wave of apparent prosperity brought by fruit: miles of chain-link fencing enclose seemingly endless groves of avocado trees with limbs hanging heavy with the harvest. New packing plants seemingly go up overnight.\n\nBut Hipolito Mora, who founded the state\u2019s civilian armed self-defense movement in 2013, said appearances are deceptive. The new fruit packing plants had already been robbed at gunpoint three times in one week by thieves who apparently knew exactly when they would have cash on hand to pay farmers.\n\n\u201cIf the business owners were to close their plants, the region\u2019s economy would come crashing down,\u201d said Mora, who is also a lime grower.\n\nMexico supplies about 43% of world avocado exports, almost all from Michoacan. The USDA has a near-permanent delegation of inspectors posted in Mexico.\n\nIn this Oct. 2, 2019 photo, a worker wipes his hands while filling crates with avocados at a packing warehouse in Ziracuaretiro, Michoacan. (Photo: Marco Ugarte, AP)\n\nA few weeks after the incident with the USDA inspectors, an avocado orchard manager and a worker were kidnapped at gunpoint in Ziracuaretiro, allegedly by municipal police. Seven officers are under investigation in the case, and the Ziracuaretiro police department was essentially disbanded.\n\nToday, heavily armed state police patrol Ziracuaretiro and Mayor Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez Baca is worried. He has seven town policemen in jail, illegal loggers felling pine trees in his township and a potential economic crisis on his hands.\n\n\u201cThis has everyone worried,\u201d Rodriguez Baca said of the U.S. warning and violence in his town. \u201cIf they close the door on us in the United States, everything would come crashing down.\u201d\n\nIn this Oct. 3, 2019 photo, a family on a motorcycle courses between mounds of dirt and rocks on the outskirts of Tepalcatepec, Michoacan state, Mexico. (Photo: Marco Ugarte, AP)\n\nHis township shows the shortcomings of state and federal anti-crime strategies, in which police, the army and National Guard often come into troubled towns, make a show of force for a few weeks and then leave. State police had been assigned to patrol Ziracuaretiro earlier this year, before the U.S. inspectors were assaulted, but were withdrawn in July to attend another hot spot.\n\nAvocado growers are feeling scared, alone and caught in the middle.\n\nCarlos Mart\u00ednez is a third-generation avocado grower whose 6-acre grove in Ziracuaretiro can produce as much as 50 tons of avocados in a good year, worth about $100,000.\n\n\u201cIt is a question of crime and that affects us as third parties, and our customers,\u201d Mart\u00ednez said. \u201cWe just wake up each morning hoping it doesn\u2019t happen to us.\u201d\n\nMart\u00ednez hasn\u2019t had any shipments of avocados stolen yet \u2013 a common complaint in Michoacan \u2013 but he said thieves often steal avocados from the orchards. He, like most growers, had to put up chain-link fences and hire a guard. But it is the fear of kidnapping or the phone call demanding protection payments that worry him most.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t answer phone calls from numbers I don\u2019t know,\u201d Mart\u00ednez said.\n\nIn San Juan Parangaricutiro, De la Guante is an example of how avocados have lifted many in Michoac\u00e1n out of poverty.\n\nHe was an itinerant farmworker before he planted avocados on 2.4 acres of sandy land 11 years ago. That relatively small plot now yields as much as 10 tons of avocados. This year he was lucky to sell in August, when prices were high, at 40 pesos ($2) a kilogram. That means De la Guante earned at least $15,000 this year.\n\nAdriana Villica\u00f1a, a professor at Univa Catholic University in Uruapan, said the avocado boom has lifted thousands out of poverty.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of women working at packing plants, and a majority of them describe themselves as single mothers or single,\u201d Villica\u00f1a said.\n\nIn this Oct. 2, 2019 photo, a farmhand tends to an avocado sapling at an orchard near San Juan Parangaricutiro, Michoacan state, Mexico. (Photo: Marco Ugarte, AP)\n\nHowever, the rising tide hasn\u2019t lifted all boats. The region\u2019s 15,000 or so avocado pickers earn an attractive wage for the region, but the job is seasonal and the physical demands of climbing trees with long poles to get the avocados mean few can work beyond age 45.\n\nVillica\u00f1a, who also sits on the Uruapan citizen\u2019s safety advisory board, says the region\u2019s crime problem will be worse if the avocado industry collapses.\n\n\u201cIf there were no avocados, where are they going to work?\u201d Villica\u00f1a asked. \u201cThe most likely things is that they would hire themselves out to work for the criminals.\u201d\n\nPeople paid much more for gas in California last year: The governor wants an investigation\n\nMark Zuckerberg appears before Congress again: Here's why\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/10/23/avocado-industry-viagras-cartel-taking-notice-money-stream/4071161002/", "description": "From small-scale avocado growers armed with AR-15 rifles to vigilantes manning sniper posts, violence is surrounding the avocado industry.", "authors": ["Mark Stevenson", "Associated Press", "Published P.M.
