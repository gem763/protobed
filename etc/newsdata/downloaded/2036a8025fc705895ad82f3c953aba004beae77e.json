This month it sealed a deal to buy a majority stake in Hobart International Airport. It is the owner of ports, shopping malls, and plays in the energy space as well as healthcare. It splashed out (with its partners) $1.1 billion for cancer care player Icon Group in 2017.\n\nWith interest rates possibly headed to zero and talk of quantitative easing, QIC is investigating how to boost its returns, said Katrina King, the company's head of research and product innovation.\n\n\"It is about looking at alternative sectors, like looking within real estate and embracing, for example, the healthcare precinct, which would traditionally not be defined into real estate,\" the fixed income expert said.\n\n\"You can look at other things like build to rent, student accommodation \u2013 areas that are not exploited in terms of returns like other traditional sectors.\"\n\nBig data and new opportunities\n\nQIC, like many fund managers, has pursued separate investment themes but this new healthcare initiative will be the first time that a single core investment theme is shared across of all QIC\u2019s different business lines.\n\nMr Frawley said trends such as cost consolidation, big data, new tech and digital mean there are opportunities for institutional investors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQIC looked at buying private hospitals owner Healthscope, now owned by Brookfield Asset Management. It was not approached about a tie-up by underbidder BGH Group (which linked itself to AustSuper).\n\nMr Frawley said Healthscope was a great example of how the firm is leveraging its capabilities across infrastructure, private equity and real estate.\n\n\"Getting those three teams working together on these sorts of things, that is what we're trying to achieve going forward,\" he said.\n\nWith private equity expected returns much higher than those from real estate, Mr Frawley admitted it is not easy to coalesce these needs.\n\nMatching healthcare and real estate\n\nQIC is looking to transform its large scale shopping malls into town centre spaces that would include healthcare precincts, aged care operators or day hospitals as tenants, he said.\n\nPE-owned Nexus Day Hospital fits the bill, but Mr Frawley declined to say if it was poised to buy the asset.\n\nMs King pointed to the large volume of medical data - that by 2020 will double every 73 days. Each person will have over one million gigabytes of health data, equal to 300 million books, which needs to be stored, creating an investment opportunity in specialised storage of medical data, she added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHealthcare investments are on the rise: last year, disclosed deal values in the space rose 11 per cent to $US447 billion, while deal volume increased by almost 20 per cent year over year to 316 transactions, according to Bain & Co.\n\nIn Australia, 60 per cent of shopping centres increased their formal health and wellness floor space over the past three years to match the increased consumption of health spending.\n\n\"I think in future the tenancy mix will change fairly dramatically, we are already starting to see this, like healthcare services being part of the services around town centres,\" Mr Frawley said.\n\n\u201cSome of our big town centres have large land yet to be developed around them, and there is an opportunity for us to provide those sort of necessary and important services on site.\"\n\nThe former head of BlackRock Australia added that this gives people a better experience, pointing to the \"pretty ordinary experience\" of going to a large hospital due to lack of beds and long waiting lists.", "description": "The Queensland government-owned fund manager says healthcare naturally fits the nature of capital systems like superannuation.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4485%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_506%2C$y_231/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/416dcc7cb14b7e50b150b513b7125cee3a44c5c5", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
