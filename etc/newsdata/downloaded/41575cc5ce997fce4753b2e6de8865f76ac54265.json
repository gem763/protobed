Will anything be as good? (Photo: Getty Images)\n\nLooks like Google is getting ready for a serious dive back into wearables. Both Reuters and CNBC are reporting that Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, has made an offer to acquire Fitbit. Yes, that Fitbit.\n\nAccording to Reuters, which initially broke the news, negotiations aren\u2019t locked down quite yet \u2014 and, it\u2019s unclear how much Alphabet is willing to plunk down on the deal. That said, CNBC is reporting Fitbit stock has jumped up 27 per cent since news broke, bringing shares up 10 per cent for 2019 and boosting its market cap by more than $409 million to $2 billion total.\n\nGizmodo reached out to Alphabet and Fitbit, but both companies declined to comment.\n\nThe news isn\u2019t super surprising if you\u2019ve been paying attention to the fitness tracker and smartwatch space in recent years. While Fitbit reigned supreme when it came to fitness trackers \u2014 so much so that the word \u201cFitbit\u201d is colloquial shorthand for the entire product category \u2014 it\u2019s stumbled a bit when it comes to smartwatches.\n\nIt paid the big bucks for Pebble back in 2017, but the Ionic, its first smartwatch, was somewhat lacklustre. And while Fitbit found greater success with its second smartwatch, the Versa, Reuters reported last month that Fitbit was mulling a sale following a cut to its 2019 revenue forecast, due partially to disappointing Versa Lite Edition sales.\n\nMeanwhile, Google has been quietly beefing up its smartwatch cred. Earlier this year, it bought $58 million worth of Fossil\u2019s tech, as well as a portion of its research and development team.\n\nBefore this month\u2019s Made by Google event, there were plenty of rumours swirling around that Google would finally make good on the long-awaited Pixel Watch. That ultimately didn\u2019t happen, but Google did make a lot of noise about \u201cambient computing\u201d \u2014 the idea that you should be able to access Google services wherever you are \u2014 at the event itself. A smartwatch slots neatly into those ambitions.\n\nAt this point, however, Google trails far behind competitors like Apple and Samsung when it comes to smartwatch software. Despite many improvements last year and Qualcomm finally updating to the Snapdragon Wear 3100 chip, Wear OS is still not great. It\u2019s not as if Fitbit OS is that robust either, but Fitbit has something that Daddy Google definitely wants: Lots and lots of fitness data.\n\nSure Apple has a lot of data thanks to its Apple Watch \u2014 and it\u2019ll definitely get more via its upcoming health studies \u2014 but Fitbit\u2019s been in the game much longer. Also, as of the end of 2018, the company had 27.6 million active users.\n\nOn top of a loyal user base, that\u2019s also a lot of data spanning demographics, health metrics like heart rate and sleep data, as well as more sensitive information like when you had your last period or your last sexual encounter. Added to the fact that Fitbit recently added voice assistant capabilities via Alexa on the Versa 2, it\u2019s not hard to imagine swapping that for Google Assistant.\n\nThough there have been reports a Pixel Watch may end up being a hybrid-analogue, it\u2019d possibly be easier for Google to build off Fitbit\u2019s \u2014 and Pebble\u2019s \u2014 tech, than to build a Pixel Watch from the ground up on a platform that no one truly seems to love. (Sorry Wear OS, dems the breaks.)\n\nWe\u2019ll have to wait and see how this all shakes out, but if Alphabet really does end up buying Fitbit, the Pixel Watch might end up looking a little more familiar than initially thought.", "description": "Looks like Google is getting ready for a serious dive back into wearables.
