It\u2019s coming November 2019 to early adopters of its $130 Founder\u2019s Edition and perhaps its similar $130 Premiere Edition, and to the rest of us in 2020.\n\nUnlike traditional consoles, like the Xbox One and PS4 Pro, Stadia doesn\u2019t live in a box. Google says that when the service launches later in 2019, games will be quickly accessible through the Chrome browser on a variety of devices, including desktops, laptops, and Pixel phones to start. If you like gaming on a TV, you\u2019ll need a Chromecast Ultra. So far, the only Stadia accessory that Google has announced for sale is its Stadia controller, which has a capture button and Google Assistant functionality. But it said that other USB-powered controllers will work, as well.\n\nWe\u2019ve got an early guide to how Stadia works, we\u2019re keeping a running list of all the games announced so far \u2014 and you can find all the updates we\u2019re tracking in our StoryStream below.", "description": "Google has announced Stadia, a new cloud gaming platform powered by its vast internet infrastructure around the world.
