Mass marches in Hong Kong opposing legislation on easing extraditions to China began peacefully in June, but have since widened into a broader movement against Beijing\u2019s increasing grip and frequently boils into violence.\n\nThe People\u2019s Daily commentary suggests a lack of support from Chinese officials for HKEX to take over LSE, adding another hurdle for the Hong Kong company to overcome. The paper also took a jab at protests in the former British colony, saying the demonstrations have reduced the city\u2019s international allure.\n\nThe Chinese newspaper questioned the resistance of some parties in Hong Kong in leveraging on the mainland\u2019s economic clout.\n\n\u201cSome people in Hong Kong still have a negative view toward integrating into the development of the nation as they don\u2019t see what opportunities it brings to Hong Kong,\u201d according to the commentary. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t only show how short-sighted it is from an economic perspective, but also how narrow-minded from a political perspective.\u201d\n\nA spokesman with HKEX said there is no immediate comment on the People\u2019s Daily\u2019s article.\n\nHKEX Holds Out Prospect of Going Hostile in $37 Billion LSE Bid\n\nLSE on Friday rejected the takeover proposal from its Asian rival, saying the bid had \u201cfundamental flaws.\u201d The board of the British bourse said HKEX\u2019s approach on Wednesday had problems in its \u201cstrategy, deliverability, form of consideration and value.\u201d\n\nHKEX is ready to make the case for the 29.6 billion-pound ($37 billion) takeover directly to investors. HKEX said on Friday that LSE shareholders \u201cshould have the opportunity to analyze\u201d the proposal in detail.\n\n(Updates with commentary in 4th paragraph.)\n\n--With assistance from Kiuyan Wong and Alfred Liu.\n\nTo contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Ken Wang in Beijing at ywang1690@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Shamim Adam at sadam2@bloomberg.net, Niluksi Koswanage\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- London Stock Exchange Group Plc\u2019s rejection of a takeover proposal from Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. shows that there are doubts around the world over Hong Kong\u2019s development potential, according to a People\u2019s Daily commentary.LSE\u2019s letter to HKEX, which says its partnership with", "authors": ["Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/qsxlC1ZsTnjgHuXdXwmb8g--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/2338a7ebc449641e5f6fff386791ee79", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
