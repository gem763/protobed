A jury awarded the Maryland man $800,000\n\n'In response, the Caucasian female employee activated her handheld radio device and called park security,' Mims\u2019s lawsuit states.\n\nAccording to a lawsuit obtained by the Washington Post, Mims was with his son at Hurricane Harbor when the child ran off.\n\nMims said he had taken his shirt off while at the water park, and went searching other areas of Six Flags when he noticed his son was nowhere in sight.\n\nHe said as he ran through Six Flags looking for the boy a couple of security guards told him that it was against park rules not to have a shirt on. The frantic father said he explained what was going on and they let him continue searching.\n\nMims eventually found his son safe and well playing arcade games. He said he called his wife, who had his shirt in her bag, and told her where to meet them.\n\n'You don't know what crazy people are going to do out here,' Mims told the Washington Post. 'Everything flashes through your mind at that time. You're worried.'\n\nHe added: 'I'm nervous, afraid and scared because I can't find my child. Not one time did anyone say, \"Is something wrong? Do you need any help?\"'\n\nThe Maryland father said his son went missing in the park and he was trying to find him\n\nHe told the Post that the call the security guard made for backup was racially motivated.\n\nMims said two more security guards approached him and told him to leave the park. Mims said he again tried explaining what happened and told them that his wife was on the way with his shirt.\n\n'Man, I told you, I\u2019m waiting for my wife,' Mims, in court filings, recalled telling security. 'I don\u2019t understand, I\u2019ve spent all this money \u2014 almost $400 \u2014 to get into this park, and now you are telling me I have to leave because I don\u2019t have a shirt on?'\n\nMims said he used an expletive and that's when one of the security guards placed his hand on his mace and told the father to leave.\n\nMims, according to his lawsuit, responded: 'What are you doing? Are you really about to mace me right in front of my son because I told you I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on?'\n\nMims said the guards again told him to leave so he started walking towards the exit.\n\nHe said once they stepped outside the park's gate, one of the security guards told him he was under arrest for disorderly conduct and grabbed his arm.\n\nMims said before the incident he was at Hurricane Harbor, a water park, with his son and he had taken his shirt off\n\nMims, who says the attack was racially motivated, was awarded $800,000 by a Maryland jury\n\nMims said he yanked his arm away, and that's when several guards threw him to the ground and allegedly beat him. He said he was bruised during the alleged attack. One photo shows swelling above his eye.\n\n'This beat down is unacceptable,\u201d Mims' lawyer Donald Huskey said.\n\nMims said he knows he broke park rules by not having a shirt on and by cursing, but he doesn't think he should have been attacked as he was trying to leave.\n\n'I could see if I was fighting with someone or not compliant, but I was leaving,' Mims said. 'I broke the rules. That\u2019s my bad, but that doesn\u2019t mean you need to slam my face into the ground.'\n\nThe Daily Record reports the jury returned the verdict Friday for Mims. His attorney, Governor Jackson III, said Monday that Mims and his wife feel vindicated after the verdict.\n\nSix Flags attorney David Skomba says the defense plans to challenge the verdict and request a new trial.", "description": "Nicholaus Mims had claimed in a lawsuit against Six Flags that he was thrown to the ground and handcuffed by guards while walking to his car on Father's Day in 2018.", "authors": ["Jerry Barmash For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/15/20329416-0-image-a-4_1572361269688.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
