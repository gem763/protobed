Customers were told the following: that the already pathetic rate of interest they are getting on their savings is being slashed yet further.\n\nFor example, on a \u201cbonus savings\u201d account that has less than \u00a325,000 invested you shall soon be paid just 0.4%, down from a puny 0.6%.\n\nA cash ISA will pay, from mid-December, 0.55%, down from 0.85%.\n\nEven by the standards of banks, the statement I got after requesting an explanation doesn\u2019t do much to reassure.\n\n\u201cOur savings range is designed to support customers and encourage good savings habits\u2026 there are a number of different factors that influence the interest rates of savings accounts, and each provider will have their own reasons for the products they offer and the associated interest rates. Our savings accounts are competitive and cater for the different needs of savers.\u201d\n\nCompetitive? Different needs? Who thinks this stuff up?\n\nWhile there is much talk of interest rates going negative in the wake of a no-deal Brexit, they haven\u2019t yet. First Direct, owned by the mighty HSBC, is jumping the gun.\n\nEven if the move on savings is financially necessary, which I doubt, I\u2019ve yet to receive a similar note telling me my mortgage has also been cut.\n\nAssuming the Bank of England does lower interest rates in the run-up to Christmas, we can expect big banks to do the same.\n\nFirst Direct has already jumped. On the upside, I guess you could say the likely flood of money into equities from people seeking a decent return will at least protect the FTSE. It\u2019s still a poor show from First Direct, which used to be one of our most trusted bank brands.", "description": "The email from First Direct was badged \u201cimportant information\u201d.
