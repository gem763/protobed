The Trump administration abandoned a multi-nation nuclear deal last year and has intensified pressure on Iran\u2019s economy in a campaign to roll back Tehran\u2019s military activities in the region.\n\nTehran signaled its intent Thursday to breach key tenants of the nuclear deal, after Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Javad Zarif on Thursday sent a letter to the European Union\u2019s foreign-policy chief, Federica Mogherini, outlining those steps.\n\nSpeaking to reporters Saturday, the spokesman for Iran\u2019s Atomic Energy Organization, Behrouz Kamalvandi, provided more detail of how the Islamic Republic was pushing past limits of the deal.\n\nMr. Kamavandi said it had begun feeding the small numbers of more advanced centrifuges installed under the deal with uranium as of Friday. Instead of turning the output back into natural uranium\u2014as mandated under the nuclear deal\u2014Mr. Kamavandi said Iran would add the enriched uranium produced to their uranium stockpile.\n\n\u201cAs long as the other side do not fulfil their commitments, we should not be expected to do so either,\u201d Mr. Kamalvandi said. \u201cOur stockpile will go high from now on.\u201d\n\nMr. Kamalvandi warned Iran\u2019s enriched uranium stockpile would see \u201ca very high jump\u201d 20 days from now. \u201cThe clock is ticking,\u201d he said.\n\nIran has already exceeded the deal\u2019s 300-kilogram limit on its stockpile of enriched uranium and the latest breach doesn\u2019t substantially change its ability to produce a nuclear weapon in the near term.\n\nBut Mr. Kamalvandi said Iran would take further steps within one month to reinstall and test its more advanced IR2-M centrifuges, which were developed before the nuclear deal. That step would significantly shorten breakout time, or how long it would take Tehran to produce enough fissile material for one nuclear bomb.\n\nDavid Albright, a former weapons inspector who is president of the Institute for Science and International Security in Washington D.C., said it could take Iran three months to install all Iran\u2019s roughly 1,000 IR-2M centrifuges. That means it would take Iran time to fire up its enriched uranium production.\n\nSince starting to breach the deal\u2019s constraints in July, Tehran has sought to strike a balance between reducing its compliance enough to put pressure on Europe and the U.S. without closing the door to diplomacy.\n\nThe latest breach comes after the Trump administration appeared to dismiss efforts led by France to throw Tehran a possible $15 billion economic lifeline in return for its full compliance with the nuclear accord. French officials say the initiative is still alive and the French and U.S. presidents discussed Iran on Thursday.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper said on Saturday he wasn\u2019t surprised by Iran\u2019s announcement. \u201cIt\u2019s no surprise that the Iranians are going to pursue what the Iranians have always been pursuing,\u201d he said at a joint press conference with French Defense Minister Florence Parly in Paris.\n\nIn another potentially damaging development to French attempts to mend fences between Tehran and Washington, satellite images show an Iranian oil tanker released last month by Gibraltar had moved to the immediate vicinity of Tartus in Syria. The vessel, called Adrian Darya 1, was freed by Gibraltar after Iran pledged it would not deliver its oil to the regime of Bashar al-Assad.\n\n\u201cAnyone who said the Adrian Darya-1 wasn\u2019t headed to Syria is in denial,\u201d U.S. national security adviser John Bolton said in a tweet late Friday. \u201cWe can talk, but Iran\u2019s not getting any sanctions relief until it stops lying.\u201d\n\nIAEA director general Cornel Feruta left for Tehran on Saturday for meetings with senior Iranian officials, the agency said. He will see Mr. Zarif and the head of Iran\u2019s atomic agency on Sunday, Iranian officials said.\n\nThe visit comes ahead of the regular quarterly IAEA board meeting on Monday where Iran\u2019s nuclear activities will be discussed.\n\nMr. Feruta\u2019s Tehran trip comes after The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that Iran was stifling the agency\u2019s probe of Iran\u2019s activities at the Turquz Abad site in Tehran. Western diplomats say the agency has found radioactive material at the now-shuttered site and that Iran had refused to respond to the agency\u2019s questions about the site. Mr. Feruta is expected to press the matter in Tehran, western officials said.\n\nMr. Kamalvandi pledged that Iran wouldn\u2019t interfere with the IAEA\u2019s \u201csupervision and access.\u201d\n\nThe brinkmanship over the deal has added to already high tensions between Iran and the U.S. that includes attacks on commercial ships in the Persian Gulf. On Saturday, the Iranian coast guard detained a foreign tug boat accused of smuggling 283,900 liters of gasoil in the Persian Gulf. The nationality of the ship was not disclosed but twelve nationals of the Philippines were arrested, according to Iran\u2019s state news agency IRNA, citing Hossein Dehaki, the commander of maritime guards of Hormozgan province bordering the Strait of Hormuz.\n\n\u2014Noemie Bisserbe in Paris and Benoit Faucon in London contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Isabel Coles at isabel.coles@wsj.com and Laurence Norman at laurence.norman@wsj.com", "description": "Iran said it had accelerated its nuclear research work and threatened to take fresh steps within a month that could allow it to expand its stockpile of enriched uranium, a material that can be used to fuel a nuclear weapon.", "authors": ["Aresu Eqbali In Tehran", "Isabel Coles In Beirut", "Laurence Norman In Brussels", "Isabel Coles", "Laurence Norman", "Isabel.Coles Wsj.Com", "Laurence.Norman Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105028/social", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
