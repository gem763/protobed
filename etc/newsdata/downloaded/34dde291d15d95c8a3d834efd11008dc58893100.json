This week, we\u2019re featuring music producer and record label owner 3lau.\n\nJustin Blau, otherwise known as 3lau, is sitting with The Verge on the floor of a green room trailer at a festival. We\u2019re directly behind the main stage, and the trailer\u2019s wood-paneled walls are vibrating from the act currently playing. Blau himself is about to step on stage, but is letting us rummage through his briefcase beforehand, which contains all the things he needs to perform live.\n\nKnown for his melodic-leaning dance songs, along with other endeavors \u2014 like blockchain-powered festival OMF and non-profit record label Blume \u2014 Blau\u2019s reach extends far beyond music itself. And he\u2019s always forward-thinking. In the past year he\u2019s collaborated with the likes of HYO from Girls\u2019 Generation, worked on a track with Ninja for the gamer\u2019s NINJAWERKS Vol. 1 compilation, and put out several lush and pop-forward singles on his own imprint, like \u201cTouch\u201d and \u201cWould You Understand.\u201d He has two albums planned for early 2020. On top of that, as evidenced by where we\u2019re talking with Blau, he maintains a constant touring schedule.\n\nIt\u2019s a lot for one person to juggle, but as we see in his bag, Blau\u2019s able to do it all through being a very meticulous person. \u201cWow,\u201d he says in admiration after The Verge has arranged his array of cables on the trailer\u2019s carpet. \u201cIt looks really pretty. You guys did a great job, and I\u2019m very detail-oriented.\u201d\n\nYou have a briefcase?\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of interesting things in here! You\u2019re skeptical!\n\nNo! It\u2019s just unexpected.\n\nI just come to the show like this. Business. It is a Tumi. I do love Tumi. My luggage is also Tumi. I use this because I already have a backpack. If you see my full luggage setup, the briefcase makes more sense. It fits perfectly on one side of my luggage. I\u2019m super efficient about how I pack.\n\nAnd here I have my DJ controller.\n\nWhoa! That\u2019s the perfect size for your bag, and I love the color.\n\nThank you. It\u2019s custom iridescent red.\n\nDoes it glow under black light?\n\nIt does. Part of the Ultraviolet idea. It\u2019s made by a company called Livid. They\u2019ve actually discontinued it, which is a nightmare for me because I only have two. If they break I\u2019m literally screwed. I\u2019ll have to reprogram one or ideally have somebody else design one. It\u2019s basically a MIDI controller for Ableton. I\u2019ve always DJed with Ableton. Everyone is like, well why don\u2019t you DJ with CDJs? And the reason why is because when was in college I couldn\u2019t afford CDJs. I learned on Ableton. A CDJ setup is like, four grand, and there were no clubs for me to go check it out. And this little thing is $500.\n\nIt was a way more affordable alternative. I stole Ableton at the time, totally did not buy it. But now I own Ableton and am a real licensor.\n\nI had the APC 40 back in the day and this [Livid controller] was the replacement. It\u2019s more customizable. There\u2019s a lot more I can do with it. I can create my own custom MIDI scripts. It\u2019s really cool.\n\nLivid knew that I was using it from photos and they reached out to me and said they wanted to make me a custom one. My first one was black and they powder coated it this red. It\u2019s one of a kind. And it\u2019s discontinued. So this is my pride.\n\nLet\u2019s see what else you\u2019ve got in here.\n\nMy backpack has my production laptop, and adapters, my headphones, all that stuff. This bag has the stuff I need live.\n\nThis is a good one. An extra battery.\n\nDoes that charge your laptop too?\n\nYes. It\u2019s a newer Mophie. I love them. This battery can charge the laptop and the phone. I usually travel with three of them because on an international flight if there isn\u2019t an outlet when my laptop dies, I know I have batteries I can use. Ideally that will eventually change. But international flights don\u2019t always have adapters, and that\u2019s why I travel with three.\n\nDongles. More dongles. And more cables. I keep extras because it\u2019s so easy to lose them.\n\nAnd then the trusty old earplugs. And a splitter. A splitter is especially good at festivals if I\u2019m hanging out with another artist and we\u2019re showing each other new music. It can be loud, and there can be a lot of people in the green room.\n\nWhat do you use this laptop for?\n\nSo this is just the DJ laptop. Way less ports, which is why I have those extra dongles. Disaster. This is the 13 inch, and then I have a 15 inch as well.\n\nWhat phone is this?\n\nThe iPhone X. Worst phone ever.\n\nWhy?\n\nWell, actually the software update fixed a lot of problems. The Wi-Fi used to fucking close for no reason.\n\nIs there a particular reason why you have an iPhone?\n\nThe ease of connecting everything. Because I\u2019m all Mac it makes life easy. I communicate with everybody on iMessage.\n\nAnd these earplugs and earbuds?\n\nI have Westone custom earplugs because this is the first company that somebody told me about. At the time I ordered, it was like, $50 per extra mold. I got three molds and I\u2019ve only lost one over the past eight years or so. I\u2019m proud of that. I did lose one of the db filters, but you can order those on Amazon.\n\nIf you\u2019re at festivals enough, it\u2019s something to consider. Honestly, I\u2019ll also use the dead plugs on airplanes sometimes, and it just cuts everything, even babies\u2019 cries. It\u2019s the best kind of earplug.\n\nAnd then I have portable little Beats. I don\u2019t particularly love them, but they\u2019re great for when I\u2019m in the green room and on the laptop. It\u2019s nice to bring this little bag instead of the big headphones. I normally have the Bose QCs when I\u2019m on airplanes.\n\nWhat about these USBs?\n\nThese are fan songs that I probably haven\u2019t listened to yet.\n\nPeople gave you those?\n\nRight. A lot fans give them to me and I say, listen, here\u2019s my personal email, I promise I\u2019ll check it but I\u2019m sure I\u2019m going to lose the USB. Those are two of the maybe 50 that I\u2019ve kept. I have no idea what\u2019s on them. Once a month I try to go through my demo folder and listen to as much as I can. And in some cases I wind up working with some of these artists.\n\nWhere did you get your wallet?\n\nIt\u2019s my Margiela wallet. I ordered it online from a website called SSense where I order a lot of my clothes from.\n\nMatthew Reeves: It\u2019s sale season!\n\nYou know! I see the Y3 shoes over there. I see it.\n\nDani Deahl: Matt is one of Rick Owens\u2019 primary photographers.\n\nWait, what? Hold up. No way! Oh my god. I normally have a Rick zip-up sweatshirt vest. But it\u2019s so hot so I\u2019m not wearing it now. I got it when I was in the Rick Owens store in Tokyo. He\u2019s got a sculpture of himself in there that\u2019s crazy.\n\nWhy do you have a Sharpie?\n\nThere\u2019s always a fan that wants me to sign something. Signing someone\u2019s phone is the most common request believe it or not. They want me to sign their phone cases. Some people let me sign straight on their phone. Hats are the second most common.\n\nI think I know where the $2 bills are from.\n\nThey are from Steve... Two Dollar Hollar. Steve Reisman is a very successful entertainment lawyer. He gives all his favorite artists $2 bills whenever he sees them. He\u2019s just loaded up with them all the time. He\u2019s really close with Drake and a lot of big artists, and I\u2019m honored that I\u2019m a friend of his. I use the $2 bills for valet tips. I keep every $2 bill I\u2019ve gotten from him in my car.\n\n[Places card down] We\u2019ll put that in there just for fun.\n\nWhat is it?\n\nIt\u2019s for a blockchain-powered festival I threw last year called OMF.\n\nAnd last, the Listerine strips.\n\nListerine strips are always on my rider. It\u2019s more efficient than gum. I don\u2019t want to carry a pack of gum in my pocket, but I want that because it\u2019s small. I wear tight jeans. It\u2019s as simple as that. And if I forget and they get washed, it just dissolves and smells really good. That happens all the time.", "description": "Known for his melodic-leaning dance songs, along with other endeavors \u2014 like blockchain-powered festival OMF and non-profit record label Blume \u2014 Blau\u2019s reach extends far beyond music itself.
