Democrats have been particularly vocal in opposing the move, but both the House and Senate Interior appropriations bills for next year lack funding for the relocation.\n\nPendley\u2019s timeline also lands as the downsides of agency relocations are coming into sharper focus.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture similarly announced it would move its two research agencies to Kansas City, but internal memos obtained by The Hill showed one of those agencies, the Economic Research Service, was delaying or canceling many of its projects and reports after losing nearly 80 percent of its staff.\n\nPendley said BLM would consider delayed move dates for employees with extenuating circumstances and also laid out options for those who do not wish to move, including retirement or help moving elsewhere within Interior.\n\n\u201cIf you wish to continue working in the Washington, D.C., area, we will help you identify positions in the BLM or the Department,\u201d he said.\n\nBLM has also requested the ability to approve early retirement requests and give out \u201cvoluntary separation incentive payments\u201d to those who leave the department.\n\nBut it\u2019s not entirely clear how BLM will cover the costs of the incentive payments. Interior is planning to fund the move with about $5 million leftover in this year\u2019s budget, but recently acknowledged that a lack of additional funding from Congress could jeopardize bonus payments to staffers.\n\n\u201cThe department intends to give BLM employees their legally authorized compensation and incentives, but ultimately it is up to Congress to decide if they want to deny these benefits to our employees,\" an Interior spokesperson said in September.", "description": "The Bureau of Land Management\u2019s (BLM) controversial move out west could\u00a0begin within as little as five months, according to an email sent by the agency\u2019s acting director William Pendley.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/interior_091619gn2_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
