But French economist Gabriel Zucman, an early proponent of the tax, argues otherwise.\n\nZucman, now author of the book \u201cThe Triumph of Injustice: How the Rich Dodge Taxes and How to Make Them Pay,\u201d joined The Final Round on Friday to discuss the profound effect the tax system has on American economic inequality, and how a wealth tax could change that.\n\n\u2018The tax system is critically important\u2019 to eradicating economic inequality\n\nOn Monday, Senator Elizabeth Warren unveiled an education plan that would dramatically increase federal funding for public schools over the next decade, siphoning money raised from her proposed wealth tax to cover the plan\u2019s $450 billion cost. It is one of many proposals developed by the Massachusetts senator that depend almost wholly upon the success of her controversial wealth tax, which would impose a 2% annual tax on household net worth between $50 million and $1 billion.\n\nZucman said he believes such a tax could also be a solution to economic inequality exacerbated by the current U.S. tax system.\n\n\u201cFinancial deregulation; the collapse of the minimum wage; higher college costs; the declining role of unions. All of these things have mattered a lot [to American economic inequality],\u201d Zucman said. \u201cBut, when you try to look at the income and the wealth of the very rich, the tax system is critically important. The U.S. used to have the most progressive tax system in the world, with top marginal income tax rates of more than 90% in the post-World War II decades, to estate tax rates to of close to 80% from the 1930s to the 1980s, and then you had a dramatic change in the 1980s. The top marginal income tax rate was reduced to 28%, and today, in 2018, for the first time in the last hundred years, billionaires have paid a lower tax rate \u2013 all taxes included \u2013 than the middle class and the working class. They pay 23% of their income in taxes; the rest of the population pays in between 25% and 30% of their income in taxes.\u201d\n\nU.S. Democratic presidential candidate Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) responds to a question during a forum held by gun safety organizations the Giffords group and March For Our Lives in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S. October 2, 2019.

That tax alone would double the effective tax rate of billionaires, from 23% today to 46%,\u201d says Zucman. \u201cSecond, it would generate a lot of tax revenue \u2013 about $2.6 trillion over the next ten years. That\u2019s money that can be used for childcare, for healthcare, for student debt relief, which would make it possible for the rest of the population to see their income grow more, and to see their wealth grow. So, it cannot fix all the problems; but just a small wealth tax on a tiny fraction of the population, because inequality has increased so much and there is so much wealth at the top, it can go some way towards addressing inequality.\u201d\n\nA combination photo shows L-R: Bill Gates in Washington on April 18, 2016, Warren Buffett, in New York on September 8, 2015 and Jeff Bezos in New York on December 2, 2014 respectively.

Today, they pay 23% of their income in taxes, which means their wealth mechanically grows. Wealth generates income; income stays at a high rate...there\u2019s no barrier. The snowball gets bigger and bigger...the solution is lowering taxes for the working class, but much higher taxes for the very, very rich \u2013 just like the U.S. used to do for most of the 20th century.\u201d", "description": "Senator Elizabeth Warren's controversial wealth tax could provide the solution for America's economic inequality, according to French economist Gabriel Zucman.", "authors": ["Olivia Balsamo"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/rdBMBn3oVgG_WtbqcvhZXQ--~B/aD0zNjUyO3c9NTMwNTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/ebada2d0-f76a-11e9-bf7f-72d8c8adb322", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
