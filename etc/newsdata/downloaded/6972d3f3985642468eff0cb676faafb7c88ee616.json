Photo: Netflix\n\nWhen asked, the way one sometimes is, I\u2019ll admit that I\u2019m a kind of a Ringo. It isn\u2019t an entirely accurate comparison, but it\u2019s as close as I can get within the rubric of the Beatles. I\u2019m probably a Charlotte too, but that\u2019s not quite right either. I\u2019m less judgy than she is, for sure, and I\u2019m more squeamish than prudish. I\u2019m a Capricorn, technically, but the thicket of flourishing astrology memes leaves me feeling confused rather than seen. When I was younger, I thought of myself as kind of a Woody Allen type, but you can\u2019t really say that anymore. (Or rather, you can, but it means something different now.) I\u2019m also easily pegged as a Hufflepuff, but I\u2019m also also an adult, so that\u2019s not always a dignified point of reference.\n\nThis year I learned that what I really am is a Speckle.\n\nIf you don\u2019t know the reference, \u201cSpeckle\u201d is a character from the animated series Tuca & Bertie (canceled too soon by Netflix, but hopefully still to live on elsewhere). If you haven\u2019t seen the show \u2014 which is great and only ten episodes long \u2014 it follows the lives of best friends Tuca, an anthropomorphic toucan voiced by Tiffany Haddish, and Bertie, an anthropomorphic songbird voiced by Ali Wong. The show tenderly and hilariously explores issues centered on women\u2019s friendships, female ambition, sexual harassment, and mental illness.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Speckle. Speckle is Bertie\u2019s boyfriend. He\u2019s a robin, also anthropomorphic. He\u2019s an architect. But, most prominently, Speckle is very nice.\n\nAs a person who is also often described, above all other traits, as \u201cnice,\u201d I feel a deep kinship with this sweet birdman. Lots of TV characters are presented as \u201cnice,\u201d but many of them are also annoying and selfish and rarely learn from their behavior. Ross Geller from Friends. Ted Mosby from How I Met Your Mother. Zachary Scrubbs from Scrubs (I think that was his name). They\u2019re all kind of blandly nice without having any specific nice quality that I relate to or try to embody. And, more importantly, they aren\u2019t messed up in ways that feel familiar, either.\n\nVoiced by an exceptionally earnest-sounding Steven Yeun, Speckle models niceness in ways that I recognize and aspire to, but also in ways that frustrate me about myself. He is excited by the domestic elements of his monogamous romantic relationship. He legitimately enjoys and takes an interest in his partner\u2019s important but complicated friendships. He has tried sexual things outside of his comfort zone for the sake of his partner (now-ex, in my situation) and then attempted to stay calm when she starts crying even though it was her idea. Is that too much information? I won\u2019t go any further except to say: When Speckle showed Bertie the porn he watches, and it prominently features performers cooing gentle affirmations to one another (\u201cI love you. I\u2019m so glad we moved in together,\u201d and, \u201cI love that you can be honest with me\u201d), I knew it was a joke, but I still thought, It would be nice if that kind of porn existed.\n\nBut just as importantly, Speckle had a set of nice-person flaws that you don\u2019t often see depicted onscreen. The problems attributed to \u201cnice guys\u201d tend to be things like neuroses or shyness, which have not been my problems and aren\u2019t Speckle\u2019s. Speckle has almost too easy a time getting by. He thrives at work, getting out of his job as much, if not more, than he puts into it. Simply for having the idea to reinforce a window with the kind of wooden frame a child would draw, he is dubbed the Bad Boy of Architecture. (\u201cI get to be called that because I\u2019m such a good boy,\u201d he tells Bertie later.) He receives an award for drawing a plume of smoke escaping a chimney.\n\nBertie is also advancing professionally, but through an arduous gauntlet of sexism, and while Speckle collects accolade after accolade, blissfully unconcerned that he didn\u2019t have his phone with him, Bertie is in the throes of a panic attack in a supermarket, her boyfriend unreachable. Speckle\u2019s ease of professional navigation stops him from empathizing with Bertie when her path to advancement is thornier, and her fulfillment is scarcer. When I saw that I cringed, as moments of my own blithe dude privilege hit me right in the beak, a series of brief instances of me assuring girlfriends past (and wife present/future) that things would be okay because \u2026 I don\u2019t know \u2026 things seem okay to me.\n\nSpeckle\u2019s problem isn\u2019t getting in his own head, it\u2019s his difficulty getting into someone else\u2019s. Bertie has so much she\u2019s up against, between the sexism she faces at work, her mental illness, and her desire for creative fulfillment through baking. When things get bad, she withdraws, fearful of sharing her anxieties with her partner. And Speckle isn\u2019t always the best at drawing things out of Bertie. He blithely tries to plan for the future with her, but has trouble understanding why she isn\u2019t fully onboard with his vision. Speckle tries to respect and support Bertie\u2019s ambition and autonomy while struggling to assert his own needs, including his need to know what his partner is going through.\n\nIt\u2019s rare to see a (bird)man on TV navigate the delicate straits between saying \u201cyou\u2019ll be fine\u201d and contorting himself into an emotional support structure, twisting and cramping in an effort to accommodate a partner\u2019s opaque needs. It\u2019s a very modern problem. How do you show support to an independent (bird)woman while respecting her space and making sure you aren\u2019t just pushing your own feelings aside, mortgaging present happiness for a blissful future that may never come? How do you ask for concessions from someone the world already drains of so much?\n\nIn the season (and hopefully not series) finale, when Speckle tells Bertie that he can\u2019t chase her anymore and she needs to let him in on what\u2019s upsetting her, I felt weirdly proud of the way he outlined boundaries and foregrounded his own needs. And I felt a pang of memory, thinking back to relationships I\u2019ve been in where I couldn\u2019t do the same, situations where I kept accommodating a partner, prioritizing their happiness ahead of mine, and feeling like an idiot when we eventually broke up.\n\nBut a proud as I was to see Speckle put Speckle first, I was vastly more relieved when he and Bertie got back together. It validated my need to believe that you can be gentle but also firm, that you can grow and evolve into both a sensitive partner and an advocate for yourself. You don\u2019t \u2014 as I used to fear \u2014 have to be an asshole to create space for yourself in a relationship.\n\nSo here\u2019s to Speckle, for proving that sometimes the best way to be a bad boy is to be a good boy.\n\nJosh Gondelman\u2019s new book, Nice Try: Stories of Best Intentions and Mixed Results, will be available on September 17.", "description": "The cancellation of Netflix\u2019s Tuca & Bertie has deprived us of so much, including TV\u2019s best depiction of a nice person and all his nice-person flaws: Bertie\u2019s boyfriend Speckle, voiced by Steven Yeun.", "authors": ["Josh Gondelman"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/12/12-speckle-tuca-and-bertie.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
