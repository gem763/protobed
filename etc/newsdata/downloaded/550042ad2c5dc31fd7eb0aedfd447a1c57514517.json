I can\u2019t think of another momentous decision by a commander-in-chief that was instantly recognizable as a disaster for which the president was entirely to blame.\n\nEven if you think the Iraq War was a catastrophic blunder, it wasn\u2019t immediately and universally recognizable as such. And President Bush could point to support from both parties in Congress, his advisers, the intelligence community, and even his predecessor. The Bay of Pigs was backed by the Pentagon and CIA. The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution passed Congress, unanimously in the House and 88\u20132 in the Senate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut here the cheese stands alone.\n\nAnd yet, in another sense, this all feels so familiar. How many times has Trump made a glandular, impulsive decision without heed to the facts, the consequences, or the advice of his own hand-picked advisers? Then, when criticism mounts, he and his defenders grab a sloppy paint pot of ideological buzzwords and campaign slogans in an attempt to camouflage the move as part of some grand theoretical framework or electoral mandate.\n\nTrump and the handful of surrogates willing to defend this grotesquerie are quite comfortable arguing about \u201cendless wars\u201d and \u201cTrump\u2019s mandate\u201d as an abstract matter. I think they\u2019re wrong in nearly every particular. But even engaging in debate on those terms is a gift to the president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTalk of \u201crealism,\u201d \u201cAmerica First,\u201d and \u201cendless war\u201d is a rhetorical safe harbor that works well on Twitter and cable news because it gives the impression that this is a serious conflict of philosophical perspectives. Even if you agree with all of that stuff, the fact remains that this was a scandalously incompetent and reckless action. Fighting about the \u201cpolicy\u201d lets Trump off the hook for the bungled implementation. It\u2019s like Democrats defending the botched Bay of Pigs operation by invoking the Monroe Doctrine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump may indeed have campaigned on getting out of Syria. He didn\u2019t campaign on potentially freeing thousands of Islamic State fighters, greenlighting ethnic cleansing, or empowering Syrian president Bashar al-Assad and Russian president Vladimir Putin.\n\nA serious policy of disengagement from the Middle East would require working with our allies in the region and elsewhere. It would involve intense planning by the Pentagon and State Department. And, most importantly, it would necessitate tough negotiations with the Turks to minimize our betrayal of a people who lost some 11,000 troops fighting at our side.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump went a different way. According to reporting by Jennifer Griffin of Fox News \u2014 not normally a target of Trump\u2019s \u201cfake news\u201d broadsides \u2014 Trump \u201cwent off script from what his national [security] team gave him as talking points for his phone conversation with the Turkish president.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an instant, Trump blew up months of negotiations with Turkey to establish a Kurdish safe zone that would both satisfy Turkey\u2019s concerns and make sure the Islamic State wasn\u2019t given a lifeline.\n\nWhether Trump was trying to ingratiate himself with Erdogan \u2014 he does like strong men \u2014 or was intimidated by the Turkish despot remains unknown. Either way, in a phone call last week he in effect encouraged Erdogan to go for it. Within days, the Turks rolled across the border. Arab militias began the initial stages of what could turn into ethnic cleansing. When the Kurds begged for air cover, Trump ordered our planes to stay on the tarmac. Already, there are videos \u2014 authenticated by U.S. officials \u2014 of roadside executions of Kurds. The Turks have even rained artillery around an American outpost, requiring a full U.S. retreat from northern Syria and forcing Kurdish forces to ally themselves with the Syrian government.\n\nAfter the call, Trump claimed that Erdogan promised to take responsibility for guarding Islamic State prisoners. The Turkish government quickly announced there was no such commitment. The Turks might be lying, though Trump\u2019s silence suggests they aren\u2019t. Either way, they put one over on the self-proclaimed world\u2019s greatest negotiator.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe cycle wouldn\u2019t be complete without Trump doing his best to humiliate his defenders, desperately trying to squeeze square facts into the round holes of some theory. The same week he said we must disengage from the Middle East and its conflicts, he sent thousands more American troops to Saudi Arabia. He said he opposed Turkey\u2019s incursion, but he instructed his United Nations ambassador to vote with Russia to block condemnation of it. He\u2019d said the Turks were making a mistake, but tweeted, \u201cLet them\u201d fight. And now, he\u2019s approving sanctions on Turkey for the \u201cdestabilizing actions in northeast Syria\u201d he greenlit. He might as well put the sanctions on himself.\n\nThese events aren\u2019t the result of a serious policy of American withdrawal from \u201cendless wars,\u201d they\u2019re the inevitable and familiar byproduct of a president simply winging it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u00a9 2019 Tribune Content Agency, LLC", "description": "In pulling American troops out of Northern Syria, Trump once again showed that he is making up his foreign policy as he goes along.", "authors": ["Jonah Goldberg", "Kevin D.
