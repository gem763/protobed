Police said in their charge-sheet the murder was carried out on the orders of the principal.\n\n\u201cThe judgement proves that no one is above the law,\u201d public prosecutor Hafez Ahmed told reporters after the court verdict.\n\nHe said the defence lawyers had tried unsuccessfully to establish that Jahan had committed suicide.\n\nDefence lawyer Giasuddin Nannu said all the convicts will challenge the verdict in the High Court.\n\nJahan\u2019s death sparked public outrage and mass demonstrations calling for her killers to be punished. She had faced pressure to withdraw a complaint to police in March accusing the school principal of attempted rape, her family said.\n\nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina had met her family and vowed to bring the killers to justice.\n\nTwo female classmates and two local leaders of her party were among those convicted.\n\nAfter the murder, the government instructed some 27,000 educational institutions to form committees to prevent sexual assaults.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t forget her for a moment. I still feel the pain that she went through,\u201d mother Shirin Akhtar said as she burst into tears at her home following the verdict.\n\nJahan\u2019s brother, Mahmudul Hasan Noman, demanded that the death sentences be carried out swiftly and sought protection for his family against reprisals.\n\n\u201cWe live in fear. We were threatened even today in the courtroom,\u201d Noman said.\n\nBangladesh has seen a dramatic rise in the number of rape cases in recent months, with 217 women and children raped in September, the highest in any single month since 2010, according to a report published by Bangladesh Mahila Parishad, a women\u2019s rights group.\n\nMany more cases go unreported because women fear being stigmatised. Rights activists attribute the increasing number of rapes to a lack of awareness, a culture of impunity, moral decadence, and people of influence protecting suspected rapists for political reasons.\n\nEven when survivors file a complaint, prosecution is very rare and takes years to conclude.\n\n\u201cThis verdict has set an example. It shows that with utmost sincerity we can ensure justice within our existing system,\u201d said the group\u2019s head, Ayesha Khanam.", "description": "The principal of a religious school in Bangladesh was among 16 people sentenced to death on Thursday for the murder of a teenage girl who refused to withdraw a complaint of sexual harassment against him, the public prosecutor said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
