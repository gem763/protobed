Players all across the country are urged to check their tickets as soon as possible.\"\n\nHowever, despite being able to buy anything their heart desires there are some downsides to winning a huge amount of money on the lottery.\n\nHere are the previous jackpot winners whose lives have been blighted by the curse of the lottery.\n\nColin and Christine Weir\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe couple were the previous biggest winners of the Euromillions draw.\n\nThey scooped the massive \u00a3161million jackpot back in 2001.\n\nBut, despite being married for 38 years, the couple were not immune to the lottery curse.\n\nThey announced their separation earlier this year and have now divorced.\n\nChrstine and Colin, from Largs in North Ayrshire, had been \"living apart for some time\" before they made it official and divorced.\n\nA statement released on behalf of the couple said: \"It is with deep regret that Chris and Colin confirm they have been living apart for some time.\"\n\nCallie Rogers\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nCallie was the youngest ever winner of the lottery when she won \u00a31.8million back in 2003 when she was aged 16.\n\nNow in her 30s, Callie has some words of warning to those who find themselves lucky enough to bag the winning ticket.\n\nGenerous Callie gave \u00a3500,000 of her win away to family and friends but also blew \u00a318,000 on boob jobs, \u00a330,000 on clothes and \u00a3250,000 on cocaine binges.\n\nWith the money gone, Callie is now a busy working mum of three - and says she is much happier.\n\nShe added: \"Not knowing who liked me for me, and having all the stress of all the money, I just wanted to go back to having a normal life. I still struggle with trust issues.\"\n\n(Image: REX/Shutterstock)\n\n(Image: North News and Pictures)\n\nBut even with her money gone, Callie was not immune to the lottery curse.\n\nShe was attacked after a night out and left with two black eyes, a 'burst' nose, blurred vision, two cracked ribs and swollen lips.\n\nPoor Callie also suffered from breathing difficulties following the unprovoked and 'cowardly' attack at her then boyfriend's home.\n\nHer injuries were so severe, Callie avoided her own children because she didn't want to scare them with her damaged face.\n\nCallie's attackers have now been jailed but she still suffers from panic attacks after her ordeal.\n\nMichael Carroll\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: Press Association)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nMichael, now 35, is arguably the most famous victim of the lottery 'curse'.\n\nAt just 19 when he won a massive \u00a39.7million in 2002, Michael became known as the 'lottery lout' as he burned through his winnings.\n\nHe bought flash cars and partied hard.\n\nMichael even installed a banger racing track in the grounds of his six-bedroom mansion in Norfolk.\n\nDrugs, jewellery and new homes meant within 10 years all the money was gone.\n\nDubbed the 'King of Chavs' Michael's life is now very different to when he had millions in the bank.\n\nUp at 6am every day, he now works for a coal mechant's firm and earns just \u00a310 an hour lugging heavy bags of fuel and chopping logs for up to 12 hours a day.\n\nAdrian and Gillian Bayford\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nLife couldn't have looked better for Adrian and Gillian Bayford when they scooped a huge \u00a3148million win in 2012.\n\nBut fast forward seven years and their lives are very different, with many saying they have been blighted by the 'curse'\n\nLess than a year after their big win the couple had separated.\n\nGillian has even faced assault charges after being accused by her ex-boyfriend, Gavin Innes.\n\nThere was insufficient evidence for the case to proceed and she has since branded him a \"gold digger\".\n\n(Image: Gavin Innes)\n\n(Image: SWNS)\n\nAnd six years to the day after her big win, Gillian married convicted fraudster, Brian Deans, 37, in a lavish ceremony in Fife.\n\nGillian's ex-husband hasn't fared much better than his wife.\n\nAdrian has had two failed relationships since his divorce from Gillian.\n\nHe was left by his stable girl fiancee, Samantha Burbridge, 30, in 2017, and then dumped by waitress Lisa Kemp after she found message to an ex on his phone.\n\nJane Park\n\n(Image: David Johnstone/Sunday Mirror)\n\nWhen she netted her \u00a31milion Euromillions win, Jane immediately quit her job as an admin temp.\n\nBut, like Callie, the now 23-year-old says life was much easier before she came into money.\n\nEarlier this year, Jane was so desperate to meet Mr Right she offered potential boyfriends \u00a360,000 a year to date her.\n\nUnhappy with her looks, she has also spent thousands on cosmetic surgery, which she says has \"ruined my life\".\n\nJane said: \"At times it feels like winning the lottery has ruined my life.\n\n\"I thought it would make it 10 times better but it\u2019s made it 10 times worse.\"\n\nRoger and Laura Griffiths\n\n(Image: Ross Parry Agency-Leeds)\n\nBack in 2005, IT manager Roger and his teacher wife, Laura, scooped \u00a31.8million on the lottery.\n\nThey quit their jobs straight away and spent \u00a3800,000 on a luxury barn conversion in North Yorkshire,\n\nRoger also re-formed his old university band and spent \u00a325,000 on making an album.\n\nThey did invest some of the money in property and a beauty salon but during the recession the value plummeted and they were left with nothing.\n\nBoth blame each other for losing their fortune and they eventually split in 2013.\n\nJohn McGuinness\n\n(Image: Daily Record)\n\nEarning just \u00a3150 a week as a hospital porter, John was delighted to win \u00a310million in 1997.\n\nStill living at home with his parents in their council house, John took to spending his new found wealth with ease.\n\nHe gave \u00a33million to his family, \u00a3750,000 to his ex-wife and splashed the cash on flash cars and luxury holidays.\n\nHowever, it was his love of football that eventually ended his life as in the rich lane.\n\nA huge Livingston Football Club fan, John ploughed \u00a34million into the club but it went into administration and he was liable for the debt.\n\nNow struggling to pay for food, John lives as a virtual recluse.\n\nJohn Roberts\n\n(Image: Press Association)\n\nJust three years after netting a massive \u00a33.1million in 1998, John was left with nothing.\n\nThe security guard spent his winnings on luxury holidays, houses, cars and a string of failed investments.\n\nThere are rumours John is now forced to live on handouts from pals and family.\n\nJason and Victoria Jones\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nFor newlyweds, Jason and Victoria's win couldn't have come at a better time.\n\nMarried for only a month when they scooped the \u00a32.3million jackpot in 2004.\n\nTwelve years later, Jason and Victoria say their win ruined their lives.\n\nAfter buying a lavish home, a \u00a370,000 sports car and a property portfolio in Wiltshire, it seemed nothing could go wrong.\n\nBut when Victoria became pals with businessman, Mike Clare, who sold Dreams bed chain for \u00a3222million in 2008, she split with her husband of just four years.\n\nShe said: \"The stress it gives you in life and even 12 years down the line, I\u2019m still classed as a lottery winner and it\u2019s horrible.\n\n\"It ruins your life. People treat you differently \u2013 it\u2019s just not a nice thing.\"", "description": "Someone in Britain has been lucky enough to win the massive \u00a3170million Euromillons jackpot - but as these past winners show, it's not all good news", "authors": ["Jane Lavender", "Image", "Afp Getty Images", "Pa", "Rex Shutterstock", "North News", "Pictures", "Press Association", "Gavin Innes", "Swns"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20449617.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Euromillions.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
