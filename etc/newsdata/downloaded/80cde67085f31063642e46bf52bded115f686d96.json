(Picture: Paul Michael Hughes/Guinness World Records)\n\nCrowned in the Guinness World Records 2020 Edition, the fresh record-holder began collecting Transformers figurines for his son about eight years ago.\n\nSince then he\u2019s amassed a collection worth over \u00a350,000, with the Bumblebees and Optimus Primes quickly taking over his office space and family home in Manchester.\n\nSo, Louis \u2013 Transformers, eh? When did you start collecting Transformers and\u2026why?\n\nI started about eight years ago. My son was three and I was thinking about a toy franchise to get him into so I could buy gifts for Christmas. I used to love Transformers when I was young and so I looked at the current toy range and it brought back waves of nostalgia.\n\nI bought a load of figures for my son, but then I bought a few for me too, as desk ornaments at work.\n\nThe collection has taken over his office and home (Picture: Paul Michael Hughes/Guinness World Records)\n\nI just kept researching different ranges over the last 30 years and got more excited about the newer lines, particularly those aimed at adult collectors and so the collecting habit was started\u2026\n\nWhat do you collect? Are we talking just figurines?\n\nIt\u2019s mostly the toy range, from all over the world and across the full 35 years of Transformers. My favourites are the Japanese exclusives as they have several collectible series that are really cool. I also have a lot of books, comics and magazines.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow many items do you have?\n\nIn total, I recorded 2,111 for the World Record, but after I submitted I found about another 50 more.\n\nWow! Where do you keep them all?\n\nAs I was collecting them, I was storing them at work. At first they started to fill my desk, then they spread to other desks, then they decorated our meeting rooms, finally I started filling the store cupboards.\n\nA few years later when we moved office, I had to ship them home and break the news to my wife, who hadn\u2019t realised quite how many I had. At home they filled our basement and attic rooms!\n\nHow much money have you spent on your collection over the years?\n\nJust a couple of items\u2026 (Picture: Paul Michael Hughes/Guinness World Records)\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say. I was collecting solidly for about five-and-a-half years. Some months I was spending more than \u00a31,000 a month on Transformers. So on average I\u2019m guessing around \u00a350,000.\n\nI\u2019ve bought several box sets at around \u00a3300. The most on a single figure was about \u00a3350, but it came from Japan and I ended up paying a further \u00a3100 on import duty/fees!\n\nHow do you keep track of them?\n\nUp until the World Record, I didn\u2019t keep any record of them. I bought most of them through eBay so I could look at my purchase history to check, but for years I had a very good memory of what I\u2019d bought and what I was still looking for.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI now have a full inventory which I had to create to submit to Guinness World Records \u2013 that took a while to put together!\n\nHow did the record title come about?\n\nRandomly one day at work, my business partner asked me what the current world record was. Up until that point I\u2019d never considered it at all, so I just investigated and found out that nobody had claimed a record for Transformers so I thought I\u2019d apply.\n\nWhere do you get most of your items?\n\nMostly from eBay. I used to go to collectors conventions and I\u2019d buy several from there. For the newer figures, there are various online specialists and some Japanese sellers where I\u2019d get a lot of my imported figures from.\n\nEveryone loves a Transformer (Picture: David Livingston/WireImage)\n\nDo you have a prized possession out of your collection?\n\nI actually prefer the newer figures to the originals.\n\nThe engineering has improved massively over the years and some of the newer series are incredibly detailed and the Japanese figures are very manga/Gundam-inspired.\n\nI have a few third party figures that look incredible \u2013 one is a new version of Beast Wars Lio Convoy, which is visually stunning in robot and beast mode.\n\nAnother set, are Takara originals of a Sega Megadrive (which transforms into a Megatron) and a Sony Playstation 1 (which transforms into Optimus Prime). I\u2019m a big gamer too so I love these.\n\nWould you ever sell your items?\n\nYes! Now they\u2019re home they eat up a lot of space and seem wasted being in storage. I\u2019m planning on selling many of the more valuable boxed ones and keeping the open figures for display.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat do your friends and family make of your massive collection?\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nI\u2019ve had a mixed reaction. At first, a few family members thought I was a bit strange. Lots of my friends think it\u2019s cool.\n\nI\u2019d say it\u2019s probably cool and strange, if I\u2019m honest. Having a World Record has now validated the obsession.\n\nWhat is it about collecting that brings you joy?\n\nI\u2019ve had a few collections over the years. There\u2019s a few things that attract me to collecting \u2013 I love the deep dive into something, researching and finding out about things and then tracking them down.\n\nI love the nostalgia element and re-discovering things from my past or things of value that are often forgotten.\n\nI love technology and beautiful design or clever engineering, so these are all things that have spurred on my collecting and once I start, I like to have it all!\n\nDare we ask, what comes next?\n\nI only made it into the GWR book this year, but I stopped collecting Transformers a couple of years ago now and since then I\u2019ve been collecting vintage video games and original arcade machine hardware.\n\nI\u2019m trying to stop that habit before it gets too far as arcade machines take up a lot of space. I\u2019m hoping to have a collecting free couple of years before I get enticed into something new\u2026\n\nLouis\u2019 record features in the Guinness World Records 2020 Edition, out now.\n\nI\u2019m Your Biggest Fan is a weekly series that deep dives into the world of fandoms, via the people who worship the hardest.
