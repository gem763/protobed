We\u2019ve all been guilty of saying something similarly dumb, and most of us have probably been subjected to some good-natured ribbing over it. Hayes didn\u2019t appreciate the ribbing, though, and took to Twitter a few days later to blast the entire conservative movement:\n\nThese days, conservatism is a movement deeply paranoid and pessimistic about its own appeal, increasingly retreating behind counter-majoritarian institutions: the senate, the courts, the electoral college. \u2014 Chris Hayes (@chrislhayes) September 1, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd so they are increasingly focused, as a matter of tactical and tribal fidelity, on ways to uphold minority rule. It\u2019s a sad place for a movement to be. \u2014 Chris Hayes (@chrislhayes) September 1, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nI certainly agree that the Republican party needs to focus on broadening its appeal. But here\u2019s the catch: Hayes\u2019s armchair psychoanalysis notwithstanding, he is just plain wrong about the Constitution. And by that I do not mean that his breezy, clever-sounding point is actually a tautological non-sequitur. I mean that his underlying reasoning is false.\n\nHere\u2019s his full original assertion:\n\nThe weirdest thing about the Electoral College is the fact that if it wasn\u2019t specifically in the Constitution for the presidency, it would be unconstitutional. Here\u2019s what I mean by that. Starting in the 1960s, the Supreme Court started developing a jurisprudence of one person, one vote. The idea is that each individual vote has to carry roughly the same amount of weight as each other individual vote, which is a pretty intuitive concept, but is not a reality. There are all sorts of crazy representational systems that were created that would not give one person one vote, and that would disenfranchise certain minorities.\n\nIf Hayes hadn\u2019t been so glib, he might have said that the Electoral College runs contrary to the spirit of the Constitution. But, as I said, that is not true, either.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s one-man-one-vote rule applies to state legislative elections and the House of Representatives, which makes sense in the constitutional scheme. The House of Representatives is the national institution of representation in our government. But our system is not wholly national. Here\u2019s James Madison in Federalist No. 39:\n\nThe House of Representatives will derive its powers from the people of America; and the people will be represented in the same proportion, and on the same principle, as they are in the legislature of a particular State. So far the government is NATIONAL, not FEDERAL. The Senate, on the other hand, will derive its powers from the States, as political and coequal societies; and these will be represented on the principle of equality in the Senate, as they now are in the existing Congress. So far the government is FEDERAL, not NATIONAL. The executive power will be derived from a very compound source. The immediate election of the President is to be made by the States in their political characters. The votes allotted to them are in a compound ratio, which considers them partly as distinct and coequal societies, partly as unequal members of the same society.\n\nFor these reasons, as well as others, Madison concludes, \u201cThe proposed Constitution . . . is, in strictness, neither a national nor a federal Constitution, but a composition of both.\u201d\n\nSo, Hayes is right in a very narrow sense: Neither the Senate nor the Electoral College would make any sense in a strictly national government where the states no longer had any sovereign function. At the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, this is what Madison wanted, more or less: to strip the states of their power in national affairs. But it just could not pass muster, and the Convention embraced the compromise pushed by small-state delegates: a compound republic embracing both national and federal modes.", "description": "Last week, conservatives in the Twitterverse had a good chuckle at the expense of MSNBC host Chris Hayes for something he said about the Electoral College on his show.\u201cThe weirdest thing about the Electoral College,\u201d he offered, \u201cis the fact that if it wasn't specifically in the Constitution for", "authors": ["Jay Cost"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/XHUiK48cJ0p13tbx2BUvpA--~B/aD01OTc7dz0xMDIzO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/5a2a908fcc59f8c928d388f269c1f930"}
