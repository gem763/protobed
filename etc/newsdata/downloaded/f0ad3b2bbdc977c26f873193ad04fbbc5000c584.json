(Picture: Getty Images)\n\nChristmas is just a couple of months away and that means that it\u2019s only a matter of time before the John Lewis Christmas ad makes its way on to our screens.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be the festive season of course without the retail giants tugging at our heartstrings \u2013 or making us laugh \u2013 in their bid for festive good cheer, and while we wait patiently speculation is of course rife as to who\u2019ll be singing the ad\u2019s song this year.\n\nLast year it was a Sir Elton John classic, but this year the bookies have their eyes on someone very different indeed, with Lewis Capaldi tipped for the job.\n\nCould the Someone You Loved singer be in line for a brush with John Lewis?\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know\u2026\n\nIs Lewis Capaldi singing the John Lewis Christmas advert song?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s not yet been confirmed who will be singing the song that accompanies this year\u2019s John Lewis Christmas ad.\n\nHowever the bookies have installed Lewis Capaldi as the favourite for the job.\n\nThe Scottish singer is currently just 2/5 to grace the ad with his vocals, according to Betway \u2013 who have him way ahead of second favourite Ed Sheeran in the betting.\n\n\u2018The release of the John Lewis Christmas advert marks the start of the festive season and each year the retailer aims to win over the hearts of the nation,\u2019 said Betway\u2019s Alan Alger,\n\n\u2018It\u2019ll be difficult to top last year\u2019s The Boy and the Piano which featured the legendary Elton John. Although Lewis Capaldi and Ed Sheeran are front runners, originality in advertising is key and we might see a Christmas surprise from the retailer!\u2019\n\nCapaldi\u2019s fans seem to be sold on the idea too.\n\nIf Lewis were to do the ad, it would be the latest success for the singer, who\u2019s been celebrating this week after reaching number one in the US.\n\nWho else is tipped for the John Lewis Christmas ad?\n\nEd Sheeran has also been tipped as a possibility (Picture: Rex Shutterstock)\n\nThe current odds look a little like this:\n\nLewis Capaldi 2/5\n\nEd Sheeran 9/4\n\nSam Smith 4/1\n\nLily Allen 7/1\n\nElbow 8/1\n\nTom Odell 10/1\n\nJorja Smith 16/1\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen is the John Lewis Christmas advert released?\n\nThat\u2019s yet to be confirmed \u2013 with the retailer always keeping the details a closely guarded secret.\n\nHowever in recent years the ad has made its debut on screens in early-to-mid November \u2013 with last year\u2019s effort, The Boy And The Piano, not being released until 15 November.\n\nSo we\u2019ll just have to hang in there a little bit longer\u2026\n\nGot a showbiz story?
