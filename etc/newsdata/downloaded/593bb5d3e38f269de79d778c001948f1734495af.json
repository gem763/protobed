It\u2019s a retro throwback RPG that draws on the work of Junji Ito, a Japanese horror manga artist, and H.P. Lovecraft, creator of Cthulhu and all things Eldritch.\n\nThe game is set in a small seaside Japanese town just as the \u201cOld Gods are reawakening, clawing their way back into a world that\u2019s spiraling into madness\u201d. It features a series of branching stories helmed by five playable characters, and gameplay involves turn-based combat and \u201cunravel[ing] puzzles and mysteries through spells that sacrifice sanity\u201d.\n\nPerhaps the most impressive thing about World of Horror, however, is that Kozminski created the entire game in MS Paint.\n\nUsually, game developers save themselves the horror of creating complex works in such a dated program by using custom animation software. Not Kozminski, who told Engadget that he specifically chose MS Paint for its limitations.\n\n\u201cCreating art in Paint is actually really inspiring and somehow relaxing. The limits of the program really force you to get creative with it, which is a huge thing. I guess 1-bit black-and-white art is the closest I can get to simulate that comic book feel, too.\u201d\n\nDemos of the game have been floating around since 2017, but Kozminski\u2019s profession and program of choice seem to have mostly flown under the radar until the Engadget profile. The fact that this is the brainchild of a dental hygienist, a merciless driller of teeth, who is also patient enough to create an entire game in MS Paint is truly the stuff of nightmares. (Just look at this tweet from Kozminski.)\n\nIt\u2019s slated to hit PlayStation 4, Switch and Steam later this year (hopefully in time for spoopy season). In the meantime, you can download a demo here.\n\n[Engadget]", "description": "The secret life of one Polish dentist apparently involves coding a horror game in MS Paint....", "authors": ["Ryan F.
