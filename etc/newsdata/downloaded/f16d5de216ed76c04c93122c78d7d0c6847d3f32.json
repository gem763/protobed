REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nIn the first Democratic presidential debate since Trump announced the withdrawal, the 12 candidates on the stage were united in painting the Republican president as reckless and a danger to American interests around the world.\n\nBut some, including leading progressive candidate Elizabeth Warren, said if they were president they would also seek to end the U.S. military presence in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cI think that we ought to get out of the Middle East,\u201d said Warren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should have troops in the Middle East.\u201d\n\nWarren, whose electoral platform is dominated by domestic policy fixes, did not say how she would differ from Trump in her handling of the Syria situation. But she slammed the president foreign policy approach as erratic.\n\n\u201cHe has sucked up to dictators, he has made impulsive decisions that often his own team doesn\u2019t understand,\u201d Warren said. \u201cHe has cut and run on our allies, and he has enriched himself at the expense of the United States of America.\u201d\n\nFellow progressive Bernie Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, criticized Trump for first signalling the withdrawal in a tweet.\n\n\u201cWhat he has done is wreck our ability to do foreign policy, to do military policy, because nobody in the world will believe this pathological liar,\u201d he said.\n\nENDLESS WARS\n\nTrump has defended his reversal of longstanding U.S. policy in Syria as part of a plan to withdraw the United States from \u201cendless\u201d wars in the region. But critics, including senior figures in his own Republican Party, cast it as a betrayal of the Kurds, loyal allies who lost thousands of fighters in battle against Islamic State.\n\nThe abrupt withdrawal from northern Syria cleared the way for a Turkish cross-border assault on Kurdish militia, forcing 160,000 people from their homes, according to the United Nations, and raising fears of a revival of Islamic militancy.\n\nIt also allowed President Bashar al-Assad and his ally, Russia, to push into territory held by the Kurds, giving them a foothold in the biggest remaining swathe of Syria that had been beyond their grasp through much of its eight-year-old war.\n\nTrump has since ordered almost all troops pulled out of the country.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden, who has touted his long experience in foreign policy as a key strength of his candidacy, said if he was president he would have protected the Kurds.\n\n\u201cIt has been the most shameful thing that any president has done in modern history in terms of foreign policy,\u201d he said.\n\nHe would send in \u201cair cover\u201d to protect American troops and make it clear they were not being pulled out, Biden said.\n\n\u201cOur commanders across the board, former and present, are ashamed of what\u2019s happening here,\u201d he said.\n\nVETERANS\n\nHawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard took a different view. A veteran of the Iraq war, Gabbard has defined her campaign around ending America\u2019s overseas conflicts, but has come in for criticism for meeting Assad and defending his regime.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump has the blood of the Kurds on his hand, but so do many of the politicians in our country from both parties who have supported this ongoing regime change war in Syria that started in 2011, along with many in the mainstream media who have been championing and cheerleading this regime change war,\u201d\n\nshe said.\n\nGabbard was confronted by Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who served in the U.S. Navy Reserve in Afghanistan and who has urged Congress to repeal a law passed days after Sept. 11, 2001, that paved the way for the campaigns against al Qaeda and Taliban militants.\n\n\u201cThe slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of American presence, it\u2019s a consequence of a withdrawal and the betrayal by this president of American allies and American values,\u201d said Buttigieg.\n\nBrian Katulis, a senior fellow on national security at the Center for American Progress, a liberal thinktank in Washington, said the candidates were not offering a clear alternative to Trump when it came to tough foreign policy issues including how to deal with terrorism.\n\n\u201cInstead, we have a Democratic field that has leaned towards the slogans of \u2018end endless wars\u2019 without offering much clarity about what they would actually do as president.\u201d", "description": "Democratic presidential hopefuls denounced President Donald Trump's decision to pull U.S. troops back from northern Syria, saying in an Ohio debate on Tuesday he had endangered America's longtime Kurdish allies while empowering foes Russia and Syria.", "authors": ["Simon Lewis", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441384356&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F0GB", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
