Exhibit A is that Tuesday\u2019s edition carried a front-page article asserting that the \u201cAllegation Reopens the Debate Over Kavanaugh.\u201d\n\nIn political and journalistic terms, that amounts to giving a giant middle finger to the world. The Times is going rogue.\n\nThe choice might be admirable if the facts weren\u2019t so damn inconvenient. Because they are, the paper is revealing itself to be more arrogant than honest and more wedded to its activist agenda than the truth.\n\nThe whole country knows the Times screwed up big time, but the propaganda sheet formerly known as the Gray Lady is oblivious to what others think. Grown fat and lazy by the hosannas and dollars of people who hate President Trump, it operates inside a bubble of its own.\n\nAbove all, the incident demonstrates that editor Dean Baquet has abandoned the news business and now behaves as a hard-core leftist with a printing press and website. Defying the late Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan\u2019s warning that \u201cyou are entitled to your own opinion but not your own facts,\u201d Baquet apparently believes he is powerful enough to create his own facts.\n\nSadly, given the Times\u2019 influence, that might be true in some circumstances. But not on the Kavanaugh story. It\u2019s too big, too well known and too important to be reduced to a single vision distorted by partisan bigotry.\n\nThat\u2019s what makes Baquet decision to keep digging so weird. He\u2019s wracked up a string of screwups in his tenure and now stakes his tattered credibility on the moonshot chance that there is a basis for the latest Kavanaugh claim.\n\nThe disgraceful episode started with the publication of a piece in Sunday\u2019s review section that was designed to promote a book by Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly titled \u201cThe Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation.\u201d The Sunday excerpts focused on the experiences of Deborah Ramirez, a Yale classmate of Kavanaugh\u2019s 35 years ago whose charge against him was raised during his confirmation hearings.\n\nConsistent with the Times\u2019 fetish for identity politics, the article contrasted the background of the two, with an emphasis on Ramirez\u2019s Hispanic and working-class heritage. We are told she was so deprived, she had to make do with an \u201cabove-ground pool\u201d in her backyard.\n\nKavanaugh, naturally, was depicted as the privileged white son of educated parents whose family had a second home on the Maryland seashore. He was, the authors declare, \u201csurrounded by the sons of powerful Washington professionals and politicians.\u201d\n\nThis is exactly what it smells like \u2014 a setup of stereotypes. The authors suggest that the clash of class and culture is why the FBI didn\u2019t try very hard to corroborate Ramirez\u2019s claim that Kavanaugh \u201cpulled down his pants and thrust his penis at her\u201d during a \u201cdrunken dormitory party.\u201d\n\nIn truth, they are fundamentally wrong about the probe into Ramirez\u2019s charge. As The Wall Street Journal\u2019s editorial page points out, citing the agency\u2019s final report, the FBI interviewed Ramirez, two supposed eyewitnesses and others without turning up any \u201csubstantiating evidence\u201d of the claim involving Kavanaugh. The Journal says a third alleged eyewitness declined to be interviewed.\n\nBut the authors didn\u2019t get the result they wanted, so the outcome must have been rigged along class and race lines. That\u2019s their view of America here, there and everywhere.\n\nNonetheless, the long Ramirez story itself seems to be only a run-up to the real point of the excerpts. The \u201cnews\u201d comes in the 11th paragraph, where the authors say they \u201cuncovered a previously unreported story about Mr. Kavanaugh in his freshman year that echoes Ms. Ramirez\u2019s allegation.\u201d\n\nHa, now they got him. It\u2019s a pattern, see?\n\nThey write that \u201cA classmate, Max Stier, saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student.\u201d\n\nNotice the language. They don\u2019t say Stier \u201csays he saw.\u201d They say he \u201csaw\u201d Kavanaugh with his pants down, as if it\u2019s accepted fact. The description drips with bias.\n\nWe also know now the authors ignored key facts that might cast the alleged incident in a very different light.\n\nFor one thing, Stier, whom the book describes as the head of a nonprofit and \u201ca respected thought leader on federal government management issues,\u201d worked as a defense lawyer for Bill Clinton during his impeachment case.\n\nThat puts him on the opposite side of Kavanaugh, who worked for independent counsel Kenneth Starr. Those facts could go to Stier\u2019s motivation and should have been disclosed.\n\nMoreover, the Sunday excerpts were edited in ways that neglected other key facts, especially that \u201cthe female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s how the Times framed its correction, as if that, too, is ho-hum. It\u2019s gigantic.\n\nSo gigantic that, in real journalism, if the supposed victim of an \u201cincident\u201d does not recall the \u201cincident,\u201d it\u2019s reasonable to wonder whether it actually happened. But not at Dean Baquet\u2019s New York Times.\n\nThere the \u201cincident\u201d that might never have happened becomes the \u201callegation\u201d that is reopening the Kavanaugh confirmation debate.\n\nThis is extra-thin gruel and hyping it on the front page might one day be a case study in the annals of the Times\u2019 collapse. But for now, the paper is running hard with the \u201callegation\u201d and is getting support \u2014 and reader clicks \u2014 because Trump-hating Democrats, including some presidential candidates, seized on the coverage to call for Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment.\n\nThey won\u2019t get their way, thanks to GOP control of the Senate and public disgust with Washington cannibalism, but merely calling for it unfairly tarnishes Kavanaugh and the court.\n\nThen again, that seems to be exactly what the Times aims to achieve.\n\nThis is not journalism. It\u2019s dirty politics that dishonors the paper\u2019s grand tradition by allowing such naked partisanship in its news pages. It also sets a terrible example for other media organizations and young journalists.\n\nThere is little consolation that the book authors are throwing their Times editors under the bus for the way the excerpts were handled. Or that one of the authors, Pogrebin, belatedly confessed that she wrote the \u201cpenis\u201d tweet that was deleted, with the paper calling it \u201coffensive.\u201d\n\nThese are minor differences among teammates in the larger enterprise of changing America to fit their left-wing politics. The Times is just their battering ram.\n\nAnd so the most important lesson is the most disheartening: The Kavanaugh smear demonstrates that the Times is not ready to self-correct.\n\nNor has it hit rock bottom. Until it does, it will continue to inflict enormous damage on innocent individuals, vital institutions and the fabric of America.", "description": "Exhibit A is that Tuesday\u2019s edition of The New York Times carried a front-page article asserting that the \u201cAllegation Reopens the Debate Over Kavanaugh.\u201d In political and journalistic terms, that amounts to giving a giant middle finger to the world.
