If we and other countries stopped profiteering by exporting liquefied natural gas (LNG) to the developing world, the argument goes, we would all shift rapidly to renewables and the world would have averted a climate catastrophe. If only it were so simple. Australia can be a climate champion by developing and exporting renewables, LNG, liquid hydrogen and an essential emissions-reduction technology \u2013 carbon capture and storage (CCS).\n\nThe latest energy demand and supply outlook for members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum examines a business-as-usual case and another in which APEC members achieve the commitments they made in the Paris Climate Agreement to limit global temperature rises to no more than two degrees Celsius. Under the business-as-usual case \u2013 the path APEC is currently on \u2013 members spectacularly fail to meet their Paris commitments. And remember, those commitments are likely to fall well short of what\u2019s actually needed to limit global temperature rises to less than 2 per cent \u2013 itself a terrible scenario for humankind and species protection.\n\nSince APEC members include China and rapidly growing countries of southeast Asia such as Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia, it is not surprising that APEC\u2019s energy demand is projected to increase sharply between now and 2050. A big contributor to that increase will be the demand for air-conditioned living space as both living standards and temperatures continue to rise.\n\nTry telling the people and the governments of those countries that they will just have to sweat it out because they have a responsibility to save the planet that the developed world has badly damaged. In the business-as-usual case, renewable energy supply increases faster than any other conventional source but is forecast to represent only 13 per cent of total energy supply by 2050.\n\nThe APEC analysis shows that the Paris commitments simply cannot be met without two major shifts \u2013 accelerating the substitution of gas for coal in electricity generation and the deployment of CCS in most APEC economies from 2030 onwards. Gas-fired power stations emit much less carbon per unit of electricity generated than coal-fired plants. By facilitating the displacement of coal-fired capacity with gas plants, Australia can be a strong contributor to the decarbonisation of electricity generation in the APEC region.\n\nBut that won\u2019t be enough. The APEC report describes the application of CCS to fossil fuels (including gas) and biomass power plants not as an optional extra but as \u201cparamount.\u201d Sixteen of the 21 APEC economies have carbon-dioxide storage potential. Australia\u2019s CSIRO continues its leading work on CCS technology and Western Australia\u2019s Gorgon CCS project has begun operating, joining 20 other projects operating or under construction around the world. It is now the largest commercial-scale CCS project in the world, putting Australia in a leadership position upon which it could build.", "description": "Only more Australian gas and carbon capture technology will allow Asia to hit its Paris targets, writes Craig Emerson.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_54/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/88a9a61c8f975b0561043c60cfa87b611da9b14b", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
