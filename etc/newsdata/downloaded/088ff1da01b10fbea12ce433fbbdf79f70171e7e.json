(AP) \u2014 For the first time in over a month, Kansas State walked off the field with a win.\n\nSkylar Thompson accounted for two touchdowns and sparked a late game-winning drive to lead the Wildcats to a 24-17 victory over TCU on Saturday and their first Big 12 Conference win of the season.\n\nWith eight minutes to play and the game tied 17-17, Thompson had a 61-yard run during an 11-play, 95-yard drive, capped by his 3-yard touchdown run with 2:45 to play.\n\n\"I knew it was just a matter of time because we were finally getting in a rhythm offensively,\" Thompson said. \"It was a great play call, but they gave us the look we were expecting on that touchdown and we executed the play.\"\n\nTCU drove to the Kansas State 37 on the ensuing series, but couldn't convert on fourth-and-11.\n\n\"Just the toughness and resolve because he got hit a lot and he always just kept coming back,\" Kansas State coach Chris Klieman said of Thompson.\n\nThompson threw for 172 yards, including a 21-yard touchdown pass to Nick Lenners in the first quarter. It was Lenners first career touchdown reception.\n\n\"It was unbelievable,\" Lenners said. It was everything I've ever dreamed of.\"\n\nThe Wildcats (4-2, 1-2) finished with only 266 yards of offense and was stifled most of the game. One of their scores came off a blocked punt in the first quarter, and they were unable to connect on numerous long passes down the field.\n\n\"I mean, we practice what they do and then we react to whatever else they do,\" TCU cornerback Julius Lewis said. \"We've got to keep working.\"\n\nMax Duggan ran for 115 yards and a touchdown and added 132 yards passing for TCU (3-3, 1-2), which lost their second straight conference game. Duggan had only 46 career yards rushing coming into the contest. Duggan's 46-yard touchdown run tied the game at 17-17 midway through the third quarter.\n\nSewo Olonilua and Darius Anderson each added 56 yards rushing for the Horned Frogs.\n\n\"Winning is hard,\" TCU coach Gary Patterson said. \"Especially going on the road, and this year we have a lot of road games.\"\n\nWINNING WAYS\n\nKansas State is over .500 six games into the season for the first time since 2014 when they started the year 8-2.\n\nBACK IN MANHATTAN\n\nFormer Kansas State quarterback Alex Delton played only one drive for TCU. He was 2-of-2 passing for six yards in his return.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nTCU: This was a game that felt like the Horned Frogs should've won. They have lost two straight and will be in for a tough matchup next week against No. 15 Texas.\n\nKansas State: The Wildcats scratched and clawed for their first win since beating Mississippi State on Sept. 14. They will need to carry this momentum into next week when they face fifth-ranked Oklahoma.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nTCU hosts Texas on Saturday.\n\nKansas State ends a three-game home stand against Oklahoma on Saturday.\n\n____\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
