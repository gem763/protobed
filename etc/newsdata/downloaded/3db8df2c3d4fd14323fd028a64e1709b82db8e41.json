Forecasters expect economic growth will slow to 1.7% in 2020 and will be 1.9% in 2021.\n\nBy contrast, the White House said in July it expected the economy would grow 3.2% this year. It predicted expansions of 3.1% in 2020, and 3% in each of the following four years.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no visibility to 3% right now,\u201d said Brian Bethune, an economist at Tufts University, citing trade uncertainty, economic weakness in Europe and the 2020 U.S. presidential election.\n\nYear-over-year growth in the fourth quarter of 2018 was 2.5% and 2.8% for 2017. That performance fell short of the 3% growth rate President Trump targeted with his policies of tax cuts, deregulation and a tougher trade stance.\n\nThe White House\u2019s 2020 budget projects much stronger growth than many independent forecasters, who see the economy slowing as the effects of fiscal stimulus measures wane. Gross domestic product grew at a 2% annual rate in the second quarter of this year and 3.1% in the first quarter.\n\nThe White House said Thursday morning that it stands by its economic growth projections. \u201cAre these the same economists who preached that slow and stagnant growth was the new normal?\u201d spokesman Judd Deere said in an email.\n\nHe added that \u201cdespite headwinds from severe monetary tightening and a global recession, President Trump\u2019s agenda has created the strongest economy we\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d with robust job creation, rising wages and high consumer confidence.\n\nNational Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow said last week that employment growth and productivity gains during the past two years, which he attributed to the administration\u2019s economic policies, have bolstered economic growth.\n\n\u201cThe economy\u2019s potential is now moving above 3% for the first time in probably 20 years plus,\u201d he said Friday in an interview with CNBC.\n\nMr. Trump has attacked Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and the central bank\u2019s monetary policy in recent months, calling for lower rates to spur the economy. He described the second-quarter growth rate as \u201cnot bad considering we have the very heavy weight of the Federal Reserve anchor wrapped around our neck.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Trump called for rates below zero for the first time.\n\nNonetheless, the 3% growth target was based on short-term interest rates rising. In early 2018, the White House predicted that GDP growth in 2019 would be 3.2% and 3.1% in 2020, even as it expected three-month Treasury bill rates would average 2.3% in 2019 and 2.9% in 2020.\n\nThe three-month Treasury bill moves closely with the Fed\u2019s benchmark federal-funds rate, which is currently in a range between 2% and 2.25%. The yield on the three-month bill stood at 1.95% on Thursday morning.\n\nIn the latest survey, only three economists out of 60 expected the quarterly growth rate to hit 3% or higher at any point this year or next.\n\nMany economists see powerful forces restraining U.S. economic growth, such as an aging population and choppy advances in productivity.\n\nEconomists\u2019 expectations in the latest Wall Street Journal survey are broadly in line with those of Fed officials, who expect the economy to grow 2.1% in 2019. They forecast expansion of 2% in 2020 and 1.8% in 2021.\n\nFor economists surveyed, the most significant factor creating uncertainty for U.S. businesses and consumers is the trade dispute with China. When asked about the biggest downside risk they see for the economy, 61.5% of economists cited trade, tariffs or exports. They also estimated the likelihood of a recession in the near term was rising. The average probability of a recession in the next 12 months was 34.8% in the September survey, up from 17.7% a year ago.\n\nThe Journal\u2019s survey of 60 business, financial and academic economists was conducted Sept. 6-10. Not every forecaster answered every question.\n\n\u2014Kate Davidson contributed to this article.\n\nShare Your Thoughts Do you think the U.S. economy can hit the Trump administration\u2019s target for 3% year-over-year GDP growth?
