Make room on that fainting couch, folks, I\u2019m feeling a little lightheaded!\n\nElizabeth Warren would have us believe that in the early 1970s a woman could lose her job due to her pregnancy and\u2014brace yourself\u2014her supervisor or employer wouldn\u2019t have documented that as the reason her employment ended. A public school board could record in its minutes that a woman\u2019s continued employment was supported unanimously before members were aware of her pregnancy, but that would not prevent the school\u2019s principal from firing her when he later learned about it.\n\nThat\u2019s the situation in which Warren claims she found herself after her first year of teaching. She claims she was discriminated against by her male employer and, to the surprise of relatively few, there are still those who refuse to believe her account. Undocumented pregnancy discrimination. Have you ever heard of such a thing?!", "description": "The principal fired Warren for being pregnant but kept no record.
