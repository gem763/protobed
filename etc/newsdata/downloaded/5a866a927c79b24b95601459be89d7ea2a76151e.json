I think it was something that a lot of people expected from us from the start but it is just amazing to be here among all these people. It\u2019s just incredible,\u201d he said, when asked if he was ready to be the \u201ctoast of Manchester\u201d.\n\nMartin spoke about the influences on his cooking, which include the celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay and the celebrated Copenhagen restaurant Noma, where he started as an intern in 2016.\n\nMana, Manchester: \u2018Yakitori eel, wood ants and spruce cutlery\u2019 \u2013 restaurant review | Grace Dent Read more\n\nIn a review for the Guardian in August, the critic Grace Dent noted the extent of Noma\u2019s influence on the Manchester restaurant, saying Martin\u2019s \u201ctutorship by [Noma chef] Ren\u00e9 Redzepi is clearly present in a million tiny ways\u201d.\n\nDent wrote: \u201cThe name doesn\u2019t exactly throw guests off the scent, either. However, Mana loves Noma like Oasis loved the Beatles. Positively, jubilantly, and creating their own buzz in the process. This, as compared with the way in which Glaswegian cover band No-Way-Sis loved Oasis, by honking their way through Supersonic and hoping people were too pissed to notice.\u201d\n\nMartin had an open kitchen installed in the restaurant and referred to it in his remarks on Monday. \u201cWe wanted a kitchen to be aesthetically pleasing in the dining room, so we made it that and I suppose we changed the way the kitchen works quite a lot but it works very well for us,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Michelin Guide\u2019s inspectors said his \u201cvision really comes through in his cooking; it is intriguing, it is original and it is very exciting\u201d.\n\nThe lack of a Michelin star has caused some consternation in Manchester. Simon Shaw, who owns El Gato Negro in the city centre, told the Caterer on Monday: \u201cFor a city like Manchester that has a strong tourism trade, or for a city looking to build one, a Michelin star definitely has value, it elevates not just the restaurant\u2019s profile but that of the town or city.\n\n\u201cFrom a chef\u2019s perspective it\u2019s the pinnacle of success. There are certainly restaurants in Manchester deserving of one, it\u2019s a crime Manchester has missed out in recent years.\u201d\n\nOther establishments awarded a star on Monday included three in the Lake District: Cottage in the Woods, Allium at Askham Hall and Old Stamp House. The Lecture Room, at Sketch in London, was the only UK restaurant to be awarded three Michelin stars at the ceremony.", "description": "Mana ends city\u2019s \u2018ludicrous\u2019 exclusion from prestigious guide to eating out", "authors": ["Kevin Rawlinson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b0663f89b6da9531fa7f7a5f5f4cb5b66043fa3/0_341_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=46f2924dfee0ff9d31486abfacce5add", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
