The powerhouse who used to look invincible looked beaten up by the end of Saturday night.\n\nGolovkin held on to regain one of his old middleweight titles, edging Sergiy Derevyanchenko in a unanimous decision to take the IBF championship at Madison Square Garden.\n\nGolovkin knocked down Derevyanchenko in the first round, opened a cut near his right eye in the second, and then held on from there in a fight where the long-time 160-pound ruler absorbed plenty of the type of punishing shots he used to deliver.\n\n\"This was a tough fight,\" Golovkin said. \"I need a little bit more. I need to still get stronger in my camp. Just more serious. I need to work hard. I need a little bit more focus.\"\n\nBut the 37-year-old did just enough to win 115-112 on two cards and 114-113 on the other, claiming the belt that was vacated by Canelo Alvarez, who handed Golovkin (40-1-1, 35 KOs) his only loss.", "description": "Gennadiy Golovkin is a champion again, though just barely.", "authors": ["Telegraph Sport", "Gareth A Davies"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/boxing/2019/10/06/TELEMMGLPICT000212160268-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq7HJb7Q8i_einS_BXBxlZV26YzhIvUEUDsLmHNi1h8Fw.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
