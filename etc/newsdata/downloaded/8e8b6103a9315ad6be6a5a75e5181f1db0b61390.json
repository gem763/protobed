Women and children were put aboard lorries (pictured) in Kobane to take them to safety away from the fighting\n\nBrandishing their AK-47 and M16 rifles in the air, the self-styled Syrian National Army (SNA) \u2013 a mishmash of troops from various Syrian opposition groups \u2013 paraded victoriously through the streets of Ras al-Ayn\n\nTurkey's president Recep Tayyip Erdogan claims the military action is to remove the Kurdish-led forces \u2013 whom he considers to be terrorists \u2013 from the border area and create a 'safe zone' so up to two million Syrian refugees can be returned.\n\nThe move came after Donald Trump announced the US was withdrawing its troops from the area, leaving the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) \u2013 its main ally in the battle on IS \u2013 without American military support.\n\nIt has also led to fears of a resurgence in IS activities.\n\nRather than deploying its own forces, Turkey has sent in the rebel army and supported them with airstrikes and artillery.\n\nA US official said yesterday that human rights violations had been carried out by the rebels, who have vowed to kill 'pigs' and 'infidels', and paraded their Kurdish captives in front of cameras before executing them.\n\nTurkey's president Recep Tayyip Erdogan claims the military action is to remove the Kurdish-led forces \u2013 whom he considers to be terrorists \u2013 from the border area and create a 'safe zone' so up to two million Syrian refugees can be returned\n\nHe said: 'They took a relatively peaceful situation and turned it into this absolute mess.\n\n'They could have used Turkish, regular troops, instead they decided to use these thugs, bandits and pirates that should be wiped off the face of the Earth.'\n\nHeavy fighting continued across northern Syria yesterday as Mr Erdogan \u2013 a key Nato ally \u2013 coldly rejected rising pressure from the West for a ceasefire.\n\nHe said Turkey's operation would end when Ankara completes its goal to establish the so-called 'safe zone' from the Mediterranean to the Iraq border.\n\nThe move by Turkey (pictured, a Turkish-backed fighter) came after Donald Trump announced the US was withdrawing its troops from the area, leaving the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) \u2013 its main ally in the battle on IS \u2013 without American military support\n\nHe told a weekly meeting of his ruling AK Party: 'We informed the US, EU and Russia before the operation began that... we want this terrorist organisation to be removed from our borders.\n\n'When the zone from Manbij to Iraq is cleared, this operation will be over. But until that point, no power can stop us.' President Erdogan's claims to have captured the town of Ras al-Ayn were cast into doubt yesterday after Kurdish forces mounted a desperate fightback using tunnels, berms and trenches.\n\nRebels hold British IS 'matchmaker' A notorious IS recruiter who tried to lure girls to Syria is being held in a rebel \u2018safe house\u2019 after escaping from a detention camp. Tooba Gondal, known as the \u2018matchmaker\u2019, is with ex-Irish soldier Lisa Smith in a village near the border town of Tel Abyad. They were among 950 IS wives and children who escaped Ain Issa camp on Sunday. They were picked up by rebel fighters who are likely to hand them over to Turkey. From there they could be sent back to the UK and Ireland. Miss Gondal\u2019s family told the Telegraph they last heard from her on Tuesday and she had told them she was safe with her two young children and being well fed somewhere near the border. Speaking at his home in Ilford, east London, her father Mohamed said: \u2018We spoke to her yesterday over text message. She let us know she was out of the camp and in a safe place.\u2019 Miss Gondal, 25, groomed dozens of jihadi brides including east London schoolgirl Shamima Begum. Fellow recruiter Miss Smith, 37, who quit the Irish Defence Force in 2011 after converting to Islam, is with her two-year-old daughter.\n\nAnd, as Russia works to become the new power broker in the region following the US withdrawal, it was reported that Syrian and Russian forces had entered Kobane following a deal struck between the Kurds and the Syrian government in the wake of Turkey's incursion.\n\nFive buses carrying troops waving flags in celebration were seen driving through the town.\n\nHundreds of civilians are feared to have been killed in the fighting and at least 160,000 have fled the area, according to the UN.\n\nRussia says it is working to prevent a conflict between advancing Turkish and Syrian government forces. The Kurds have had to turn to the Syrian government and its Russian allies to prevent being overrun by the SNA.\n\nThe rebel army is made up of numerous factions opposed to Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, some of which received Western funding and training in the past.\n\nBut Middle East expert Aymenn al-Tamimi, of Swansea University, said the US and UK had created issues by also supporting the Kurdish-led SDF.\n\n'It was pretty disastrous from the start. There was a problem empowering these guys at the same time. The problem being the two forces are opposed to each other', he said.\n\nnDONALD Trump last night defended his troop withdrawal, saying his soldiers were no longer in harm's way and Russia should 'handle' IS. The US President said his decision was 'strategically brilliant' for America.\n\nHe also said the Kurds he abandoned were 'much safer now' and were 'no angels' anyway because of their association with terrorist groups in the past.\n\nAdditional reporting by Baderkhan Ahmad.", "description": "Women and children were put aboard lorries (pictured) in Kobane to take them to safety away from the fighting.", "authors": ["Larisa Brown On The Turkey-Syria Border For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/23/19810036-0-image-a-21_1571263945755.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
