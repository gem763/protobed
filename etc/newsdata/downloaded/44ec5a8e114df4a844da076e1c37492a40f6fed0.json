Morrisons has the dinner for you.\n\nAs the supermarket giant has just unveiled a new 'Roulette-style' pizza, where some random slices contain a very spicy surprise.\n\nAnyone brave enough to try their luck on the 10\" trick or treat pizza may be met with the fiery heat of ghost chilli, the seventh hottest chilli in the world that measures over one million units on the Scoville heat scale - that's 200 times spicier than Tabasco sauce.\n\nAnd as well as an array of ghost-chilli topped slices, there's also one extra fiery 'Devils' slice - filled with Scotch bonnet chillies that measure between 100,000 to 350,000 on the scale.\n\nIn fact, the chilli heat is apparently so \u2018hellish\u2019 that the pizza comes with a warning label.\n\nAll other slices hidden amongst the \u2018roulette wheel\u2019 are covered with slightly cooler tangy ingredients, including jalape\u00f1o pepperoni and spicy chicken and cheese, with some slices hot and some not.\n\nSetting you back \u00a33, or two for \u00a35, the 10\u201d pizza is available from all Morrisons pizza counters across the country from today, but only until the 11th November.\n\nShezad Mahmood, Pizza Buyer at Morrisons said: \u201cThe aim is to give customers the ultimate trick or treat. The question is will our customers be prepared to roll the dice and face heaven or hell in a slice?\u201d", "description": "Some slices in Morrisons' new trick or treat pizza contain a very spicy surprise...", "authors": ["Molly Holt"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20665310.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Morrisons-Spicy-Roulette-Pizza-30.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
