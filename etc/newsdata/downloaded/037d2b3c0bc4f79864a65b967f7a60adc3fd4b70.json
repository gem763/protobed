In return, the manufacturers have promised to create more jobs.\n\nSince it was implemented in 2012, the MIDP has grown to support 112 000 jobs. As a result, the industry now contributes an estimated 6.9% to the country\u2019s GDP.\n\nWhile this success should be lauded, the reality is that this approach hasn\u2019t been all smooth sailing. One major issue has been the fact that the programme hasn\u2019t resulted in the intended goal of manufacturing 1 million vehicles a year. In 2017, only 600 000 vehicles were made locally, while only 800 000 are forecast for next year.\n\nAdded to this, Trade and Industry Minister Ebrahim Patel recently said that transformation had been painfully slow in the vehicle manufacturing sector, and that more needed to be done.\n\nThere are also critics who have complained that manufacturers have been overly incentivised and that their revenues aren\u2019t sufficiently trickling down to the communities in which they operate.\n\nTime for a rethink?\n\nThe MIDP officially ends next year, and government is planning to replace it with another incentive programme.\n\nHowever, this changeover presents an opportunity to think more deeply about how to unleash growth opportunities.\n\nThe automotive sector is much bigger than just its manufacturing component because there are literally thousands of independent workshops dotted across the country, which service the ever-growing aftermarket segment.\n\nThis is a segment that offers an even bigger potential for growth, especially when you consider that there are more than 12 million cars (and rising) on South Africa\u2019s roads.\n\nThe automotive sector is much bigger than just its manufacturing component because there are literally thousands of independent workshops dotted across the country, which service the ever-growing aftermarket segment.\n\nAll cars at all stages of their life cycle need servicing and repairs. And this is where the workshops in our suburbs, townships, cities and towns play a crucial role.\n\nThese workshops, which are small or medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), aren\u2019t just good for our cars, they\u2019re also good for our economy. Research from the World Bank has shown that countries that have a high number and high participation rate of SMEs are economically more productive and have lower levels of inequality.\n\nSouth Africa is the most unequal nation in the world. One main reason for this is that big companies have dominated many sectors \u2013 especially the automotive space \u2013 for too long. If government wants to truly unleash our automotive sector, it needs to pay more attention to how it can also empower smaller workshops.\n\nMotor vehicles are integral to our daily lives, and it\u2019s fair to believe there is scope for the sector to contribute more than just 7% to the economy.\n\nThere have already been some positive steps in the right direction when it comes to creating a more level playing field. Earlier this year, the Competition Commission announced that a proposed new motor code would ultimately become incorporated in the Competition Act\u2019s guideline for the automotive sector.\n\nThis has been a significant development because parts of the code seek to do away with the likes of \u201cembedded\u201d motor and service plans in South Africa that unfairly void car owners\u2019 warranties if they decide to repair or service their cars at an independent mechanic of their choice.\n\nOther aspects of the code have sought to prevent vehicle manufacturers from locking car owners into using their original parts, which are typically priced at a premium. Importantly, the code has emphasised the creation of greater black participation in the maintenance and service segments of the market.\n\nThese critical issues have been raised by consumer advocacy groups like Right to Repair SA, and will be keenly watched by our industry. Furthermore, it will be interesting to see which parts of the code will be included in the Competition Act\u2019s guidelines as this will be extremely telling in terms of government\u2019s commitment to a fairer and more equal economy in the automotive sector.\n\nWhat is clear, though, is that we\u2019re at a unique juncture now to start thinking more holistically about the automotive sector in the country.\n\nMotor vehicles are integral to our daily lives, and it\u2019s fair to believe there is scope for the sector to contribute more than just 7% to the economy.\n\nBut we can only achieve this if we start levelling the playing field and focusing more on SMEs.", "description": "It\u2019s no secret that the automotive manufacturing sector is crucial to government\u2019s plans to grow the economy.", "authors": ["Filum Ho"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9439/af8366f00b99405cb75ffae042bd5f69.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
