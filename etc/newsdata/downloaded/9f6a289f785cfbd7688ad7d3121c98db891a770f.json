The team collaborated with the other U.S. search and rescue groups, local emergency operations center and the Bahamian Police, who Gainesville Fire Rescue chief Jeff Lane says provided them with their missions and logistical support.\n\n\u201c[They] basically said we\u2019re going where the damage is the worst and the resources are the least. That\u2019s how they ended up at Marsh Harbour, which was in the eye of the hurricane on Sept 1,\u201d Lane explains.\n\nLane says the team is trained to deal with covering large areas, rapidly searching for survivors and extricating them from debris. Given the extent of Dorian\u2019s impact, however, their work mostly involved helping find and identify the storm\u2019s victims, as well as assisting with providing humanitarian aid for survivors in need of first aid, water, and direction to emergency facilities.\n\nThis photo shows destruction from Hurricane Dorian at Marsh Harbour in Great Abaco Island, the Bahamas, Wednesday, Sept. 4, 2019. Al Diaz\u2014Miami Herald via AP\n\nOn Sept. 1 Dorian made landfall on the Bahamas as a category 5 hurricane, with up to 185 mph winds. The storm completely devastated the Abaco Islands and Grand Bahama. According to Prime Minister Hubert Minnis, 43 people have been confirmed dead. As of Friday however, 1,500 people are still missing.\n\nHillhouse tells TIME that the team helped recover 10 bodies, describing that as a relatively low number because of how bad conditions were.\n\n\u201cI think the amount of devastation played into [our search efforts],\u201d he says. \u201cThere are so many structures that were destroyed, it wasn\u2019t as simple as just going inside\u2026 some [bodies] we had to get to, we had to tunnel through debris to be able to reach them.\u201d\n\nHillhouse tells TIME that certain areas in Marsh Harbour were so hard hit that there were no remaining buildings. While his team has worked on other search and rescue missions in Florida and Mexico, he says nothing compares to what they saw there. \u201c[It] was the worst natural disaster I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Hillhouse says, placing the devastation at \u201csomewhere in the 90th percentile.\u201d\n\nHe believes allegedly lax building codes in the area likely contributed to the storm\u2019s impact. According to Lane, the areas where the team focused their work included a Haitian immigrant community left basically uninhabitable following the hurricane. Grand Abaco resident Brian Symonette previously told TIME that Haitian survivors were taking refuge in the few buildings in Marsh Harbour which did weather the storm. (He added that many were fearful of leaving the island with other evacuees, worried they would face deportation.)\n\nA man collects his belongings before going to the port in Marsh Harbour, Bahamas to evacuate on September 10, 2019.

They thanked the team for \u201cbringing closure,\u201d he explained, which kept them all committed amid the grim work.\n\nThe team arrived on Saturday, Sept. 7 and returned on Tuesday, Sept. 11 a few days ahead of schedule after they were warned of a new weather front moving towards the islands this weekend.\n\nHillhouse says that, from what he has seen, recovery will take some time. When they are able, though, he says the team is ready to return and continue providing assistance.\n\n\u201cI think the recovery process will be slow,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have a lot of NGOs coming into assist, but just from an emergency management standpoint, you [will] have a very hard time with the debris removal plan because there is a lot of it. Myself and my team wishes them the best and we can\u2019t wait to go back and help.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an honor and privilege to be able to help in a small way,\u201d Chief Lane said. \u201cWere a small team helping a small area that has been really really hard hit; they\u2019ve been able to provide critical assistance to an area that was in great need so it\u2019s been our honor.\u201d\n\nWrite to Gina Martinez at gina.martinez@time.com.", "description": "Volunteers from Gainesville Fire Rescue assisted in recovery efforts in the Bahamas' Abaco Islands after Hurricane Dorian's devastation", "authors": ["Gina Martinez"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/great-abaco.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
