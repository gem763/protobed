Witnesses said that those responsible for the assault were associated with pro-Beijing triads that have been blamed for previous violence against protesters.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, a 19-year-old man was also hospitalised after being stabbed in the abdomen while handing out pro-democracy flyers in Tai Po, a district in northern Hong Kong.\n\nPolitically motivated attacks and vandalism have been on the rise as the situation continues to escalate in what is now the twentieth consecutive week of protests.\n\nProtesters are now vandalising and destroying shops, banks, and businesses associated with mainland China.\n\nAs moderate, peaceful marchers branched off from the more radical, black-clad frontline protesters near Tsim Sha Tsui police station, violence flared.\n\nRiot police fired tear gas and water cannon, drenching Hong Kong's biggest mosque with blue dye in what they said was an accident Credit: Kyle Lam/Bloomberg More\n\nProtesters threw molotov cocktails and set fire to makeshift barricades, while riot police charged with batons and fired volleys of tear gas and rubber bullets.\n\nThroughout the afternoon a water cannon truck chased protesters down Nathan Road, one of the city's busiest shopping thoroughfares, leaving it streaked with blue dye from the vehicle's turrets.\n\nThe dye, used to identify protesters, also contains a painful pepper solution.\n\nThe entrance to the city's biggest mosque was painted blue when the truck fired at a handful of people outside. Police said hitting the building was an accident.\n\nVivek Mahbubani, a Hong Kong-born comedian, stood with a group of friends on Nathan Road, handing out water and egg tarts to marchers.\n\n\u201cPeople passing by today shared our smiles and instead of feeling worried when passing.
