Isakson to Back Movement to Condemn Democrat Impeachment Practices", "language": "en", "text": "Sen. Johnny Isakson\u2019s (R-GA) office told Breitbart News in an exclusive comment Friday that the senator plans to cosponsor Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Mitch McConnell\u2019s (R-KY) resolution to condemn the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry practices.\n\nGraham and McConnell introduced a resolution Thursday night to condemn House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s (D-CA) secretive impeachment inquiry proceedings.\n\nGraham announced Friday that the resolution had gained 50 cosponsors across the Senate Republican conference; three senators have yet to cosponsor the resolution.\n\nA spokesperson for Isakson told Breitbart News:\n\nAfter careful consideration, Senator Isakson will join his Senate colleagues in cosponsoring the McConnell-Graham resolution. He has said all along that wants to make sure he\u2019s doing his part as a member of the Senate to ensure a fair process. He will continue to carefully monitor all the information available should the matter come before the Senate for consideration before his retirement on Dec. 31.\n\nOnly Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), and Mitt Romney (R-UT) have yet to cosponsor the bill.\n\nGraham said Thursday that the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry serves as a way for Democrats to drive down President Donald Trump\u2019s polling numbers and amounts to a dangerous precedent for future presidents.\n\nGraham said that the \u201cprocess is dangerous to the future of the presidency because if you can drive down a president\u2019s poll numbers by having proceedings where you selectively leak information, where the president who\u2019s the subject of all of this, pretty much shut out of it, God help future presidents.\u201d\n\nGraham said Thursday that the \u201cgrowing\u201d list of Republicans joining the resolutions \u201cis a strong way to show that\u201d Republicans are fighting back against impeachment.", "description": "Sen.
