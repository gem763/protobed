He decided to go forward with his legal action after authorities confirmed that the Bangor project would lose money, he said.\n\nTrump committed an unconstitutional abuse of power by shifting money previously approved by Congress, Ferguson said.\n\nThe U.S. Pacific Fleet of ballistic missile submarines is located at the Bangor base.\n\nThe $89 million was intended to build a pier, maintenance facility and berthing for two vessels that escort and provide security for submarines.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Washington state's attorney general sued President Donald Trump on Thursday over his plan to shift more than $3.6 billion in military construction funding to help build a border wall.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/19/trump_lawyer-investigation_45465_c0-229-5472-3419_s1770x1032.jpg?6f9ce78ee1a3a25672569ab4bf84dc3559d8855e", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
