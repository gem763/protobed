Who hasn\u2019t been rejected by an auto bhaiyya? But, the auto rickshaw is not a means of transport we associate with the rich and famous. They ride around in their luxury Range Rovers literally looking down their noses--considering how high SUVs are--at us mere mortals.\n\n\n\nBut, the humble auto rickshaw got the royal seal of approval by none other than Prince William and his wife Kate Middleton. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who are on a five-day tour of Pakistan, arrived at a dinner hosted for them by the British High Commission in Islamabad in a swanky, pimped up auto rickshaw.\n\n#PrinceWilliam & #KateMiddleton arrived today evening at Pakistan Monument in #Islamabad, in a specially decorated beautiful auto rickshaw. pic.twitter.com/5ltT2a8VsS \u2014 Sanjay Jha (@SanjayJha) October 15, 2019\n\nLook at those colours! That auto rickshaw is a literal representation of how colourful and fun South Asian culture can be. It\u2019s bright and shiny with flashy pictures of birds.\n\nThe best part is the fact that the auto driver is not your basic bhaiyya. He is fully dressed in a proper suit with his pristine white socks showing. Then, out come Prince William and Kate Middleton dressed to the nines. He is dressed in a bandhgala style black sherwani while his wife is in a shiny, emerald green gown.\n\nWe also love the fact that Prince William opened the auto rickshaw door on his own. There was no pomp or splendour there. If they were looking to make an entrance, they definitely did.\n\nNot the first privileged people to make autos their ride\n\nMelba Pria, former Mexican ambassador to India, made headlines when she chose an auto rickshaw to be her personal vehicle while in the country.\n\nHonestly, it just makes more sense to have an auto as a private vehicle. Considering how crowded the streets of cities and towns in India--and Asia in general--are, it\u2019s much faster to zip around in an auto. They\u2019re also small so parking will be less of an issue. The biggest bonus? Considering most auto rickshaws run on CNG, they\u2019re also environmentally friendly!\n\nHow many of us have found ourselves hailing an auto when Ubers aren\u2019t available or are overcharging us thanks to surge pricing? We\u2019ve done it when fully dressed for a wedding or for a night out dancing too. We\u2019d strut down the streets in our finery and heels, hail an auto and pray to the Gods that our carefully coiffed hair doesn\u2019t get ruined by the wind.\n\nTo be fair to the Duchess of Cambridge, she came out of that auto in Islamabad with not a hair out of place. Autos for the win!\n\n\n\n", "description": "The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prince William and Kate Middleton, arrive at a dinner hosted by the British High Commission in Islamabad in an auto rickshaw.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://im.idiva.com/content/2019/Oct/iDiva_Prince-William-and-Kate-Middleton-Arrive-in-an-Auto_Social_5da81a7847e12.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
