FOREX-Dollar holds gains as trade hopes rise, impeachment risk ebbs\n\n* Dollar holds steep overnight gains\n\n* Impeachment risk recedes, Trump stokes trade-deal optimism\n\n* Sterling nurses losses as Brexit outlook clouds\n\n* Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh\n\n\n\nBy Tom Westbrook\n\nSINGAPORE, Sept 26 (Reuters) - The dollar found broad\n\nsupport on Thursday as investors welcomed U.S. President Donald\n\nTrump's hints of progress toward a trade deal with China and\n\ndiscounted the prospect of an impeachment probe making much\n\nheadway in the short term.\n\nThe dollar index posted its sharpest daily gain in\n\nthree months overnight and held steady in Asian trade.\n\nThe greenback also held gains on the euro and pound,\n\nsteadying near two-week highs. A euro EUR=EBS bought $1.0951\n\nat 0105 GMT. The dollar hovered near a three-week high against\n\nthe Australian dollar, which bought $0.6749 AUD=D3 .\n\n\"It's a pretty decent move really,\" said Nick Twidale\n\nco-founder of Sydney-based trade finance provider Xchainge, who\n\nsaid it was driven by optimism for a U.S.-China trade deal and\n\nmarkets' shifting the prospect of impeachment to the long-term.\n\n\"Markets shrug these things off very, very quickly and we\n\nmove on to the next stuff. As it moves on, it's going to be\n\ninteresting, but we have to go back to the fundamentals and\n\nfundamentals are going to push the dollar higher over time.\"\n\nSterling GBP=D3 nursed losses at $1.2359, after dropping\n\nmore than 1% overnight as investors priced in many more months\n\nof Brexit and election risk.\n\nThe greenback had been sold when U.S. House of\n\nRepresentatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the Democratic-led\n\nchamber was launching an impeachment inquiry over Trump's\n\nhandling of a call to Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\n\nA summary of the call subsequently released by the\n\nadministration showed Trump pressed Zelenskiy to investigate\n\nformer Vice President Joe Biden - Trump's leading Democratic\n\nrival - but did not show Trump threatening to withhold aid.\n\nThe House inquiry could trigger a trial in the Senate on\n\nwhether to remove Trump from office, though that is seen as\n\nunlikely to succeed because Republicans control the Senate.\n\nTrump also on Wednesday stoked hopes for a trade deal by\n\ntelling reporters in New York that the U.S. and China were\n\nhaving \"good conversations\" and that an agreement \"could happen\n\nsooner than you think\". \"This was enough to turn the risk tide,\" said Michael\n\nMcCarthy, chief market strategist at brokerage CMC Markets in\n\nSydney of the president's comments.\n\nIt set trade-exposed risk currencies such as the New Zealand\n\ndollar NZD=D3 and the Aussie drifting higher, though the\n\nstrong dollar capped gains to below 0.1%.\n\nSigns of a rebound in the U.S. housing market on Wednesday,\n\nwhen data showed August sales of new single-family homes rose\n\nmore than expected, further buttressed the dollar. Few\n\nmarket-moving data releases are scheduled on Thursday.\n\nAgainst a basket of currencies the dollar held\n\naround 98.959, just below a two-week peak. The safe-haven yen\n\nsteadied at 107.71 per dollar.\n\nThe Chinese yuan CNH= was flat in offshore trade at 7.1278\n\nafter falling 0.3% overnight.\n\n\n\n(\n\nEditing by Jacqueline Wong)\n\n", "description": "FOREX-Dollar holds gains as trade hopes rise, impeachment risk ebbs", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEE9A19C_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
