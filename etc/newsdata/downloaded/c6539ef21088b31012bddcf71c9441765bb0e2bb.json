It would not be surprising to see a non-Christian religious leader participating. But what\u2019s problematic for me as an evangelical is how Trump\u2019s ceremony is helping to mainstream this heretical movement.\n\nAD\n\nThe prosperity gospel \u2014 the idea that God dispenses material wealth and health based on what we \u201cdecree\u201d \u2014 is not just fluff. It\u2019s also not just another branch of Pentecostalism, a tradition that emphasizes the continuation of the gifts of healing, prophecy and tongues. It\u2019s another religion.\n\nAD\n\nIn terms of religion, this inauguration exhibits the confluence of two major currents of indigenous American spirituality.\n\nOne stream is represented by Norman Vincent Peale\u2019s longtime bestseller \u201cThe Power of Positive Thinking\u201d (1952). The famous Manhattan pastor is Trump\u2019s tenuous connection to Christianity, having heard the preacher frequently in his youth. For Peale and his protege, the late Robert Schuller of Crystal Cathedral fame, the gospel of Christ\u2019s death for human sin and resurrection for justification and everlasting life was transformed into a \u201cfeel-good\u201d therapy. Self-esteem was the true salvation.\n\nAD\n\nAnother stream is represented by the most famous TV preachers, especially those associated with the Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN). Kenneth Copeland, Joyce Meyer, Benny Hinn, T. D. Jakes, Joel Osteen and Paula White are the stars of this movement, known as Word of Faith.\n\nAD\n\nThe headwater for both streams is New Thought, formulated especially by Phineas Quimby, a late 19th-century mesmerist whose mind-cures attracted Mary Baker Eddy, founder of Christian Science. The basic idea of his \u201cgnostic medicine\u201d was that we\u2019re sick only because we think bad thoughts. Illness and death are an illusion.\n\nHarvard\u2019s William James took note of the phenomenon in his 1902 classic, \u201cThe Varieties of Religious Experience.\u201d He described it as \u201can optimistic scheme of life\u201d rooted in Emerson and \u201cspiritism,\u201d suggesting that even \u201cHinduism has contributed a strain.\u201d \u201cBut the most characteristic feature of the mind-cure movement is an inspiration much more direct,\u201d he surmised. \u201cThe leaders in this faith have had an intuitive belief in the all-saving power of healthy-minded attitudes as such \u2026\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe Word of Faith movement was largely the brainchild of E.W. Kenyon (1867-1948), who blended Quimby\u2019s Emersonian transcendentalism with his more evangelical \u201cVictorious Life\u201d beliefs. \u201cI know that I am healed,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbecause [God] said that I am healed and it makes no difference what the symptoms may be in my body.\u201d Kenyon shaped many of the distinctive Word of Faith teachings, including the central idea of \u201cpositive confession.\u201d \u201cWhat I confess, I possess,\u201d he said \u2014 in other words, \u201cname it, claim it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAs a student of Kenyon, Kenneth Hagin, revered as \u201cgranddaddy\u201d in Word of Faith circles, gave the faith-healing movement its theological core. It included odd teachings about us all being \u201clittle gods.\u201d Those who are born again, Hagin said, \u201care as much the incarnation [of God] as Jesus of Nazareth.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t have a God living in you,\u201d says Hagin\u2019s student Kenneth Copeland. \u201cYou are one.\u201d Creflo Dollar adds, \u201c[The] only human part of you is the flesh you\u2019re wearing.\u201d\n\nThe positive-thinking movement appealed to urbane movers-and-shakers. Peale and Schuller were counselors to CEOs and U.S. presidents. Word of Faith has been more popular among rural sections of the Bible Belt, where faith healers have had a long and successful history. But in the 1980s, the two streams blended publicly, with Copeland, Hinn and Schuller showing up regularly together on TBN.\n\nAD\n\nIn the 1950s, American theologian Reinhold Niebuhr described Peale\u2019s message as a false gospel: \u201cThe basic sin of this cult is its egocentricity,\u201d he said. \u201cIt puts \u2018self\u2019 instead of the cross at the center of the picture.\u201d The Word of Faith teachings, conveyed from Quimby via Kenyon and Hagin, are similarly centered on not making God a supporting actor in our life movie.\n\nAD\n\nTelevangelist White has a lot in common with Trump, besides being fans of Osteen. Both are in their third marriage and have endured decades of moral and financial scandal. According to family values spokesman James Dobson, another Trump adviser, White \u201cpersonally led [Trump] to Christ.\u201d\n\nLike her mentor, T. D. Jakes, White adheres closely to the Word of Faith teachings. Besides throwing out doctrines like the Trinity and confusing ourselves with God, the movement teaches that Jesus went to the cross not to bring forgiveness of our sins but to get us out of financial debt, not to reconcile us to God but to give us the power to claim our prosperity, not to remove the curse of death, injustice and bondage to ourselves but to give us our best life now. White says emphatically that Jesus is \u201cnot the only begotten Son of God,\u201d just the first. We\u2019re all divine and have the power to speak worlds into existence.\n\nAD\n\nSo if you\u2019re still a wreck, that\u2019s your fault. Negative thinking. You\u2019re the creator, so why not be a successful one? White puts it this way in a television TBN program: \u201cThere is creative power in your mouth right now. God spoke and created the universe; you have creative power to speak life and death! If you believe God, you can create anything in your life.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOf course, to be a \u201clittle god,\u201d you have to do your part, often involving a financial commitment. It\u2019s what they call \u201cseed faith.\u201d White even gives her viewers the words to tell themselves: \u201cSo I\u2019m going to activate my miracle by my obedience right now. I\u2019m going to get up and go to the phone.\u201d When you do that, she says, and \u201cput a demand on the anointing,\u201d you\u2019re \u201cgoing to make God get off His ivory throne.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you miss this moment! If you miss your moment, you miss your miracle!\u201d When Jesus raised Lazarus, according to the old King James Version, \u201chis face was bound with a napkin.\u201d It\u2019s taken from John 11:44, so for everyone who sends $1144 (get it?), White said, she would send a napkin she blessed.\n\nSome representatives, like Osteen, offer an easy-listening version that seems as harmless as a fortune cookie. It\u2019s when he tries to interpret the Bible that he gets into trouble, as in his latest book, \u201cThe Power of I Am.\u201d \u201cRomans 4 says to \u2018call the things that are not as though they were,\u2019\u201d he says, but the biblical passage is actually referring to God.\n\nAD\n\nBut it\u2019s not really about God. In fact, one gets the impression that God isn\u2019t necessary at all in the system. God set up these spiritual laws and if you know the secrets, you\u2019re in charge of your destiny. You \u201crelease wealth,\u201d as they often put it, by commanding it to come to you. \u201cAnyone who tells you to deny yourself is from Satan,\u201d White told a television TBN audience in 2007. Oops. It was Jesus who said \u201canyone who would come after me\u201d must \u201cdeny himself and take up his cross and follow me\u201d (Matthew 16:24).\n\nAD\n\nMost evangelical pastors I know would shake their heads at all of this. Southern Baptist leader Russell Moore tweeted, \u201cPaula White is a charlatan and recognized as a heretic by every orthodox Christian, of whatever tribe.\u201d Yet increasingly one wonders whether modified versions of the prosperity gospel \u2014 religion as personal therapy for our best life now \u2014 has become more mainstream than we realize.\n\nThanks to the First Amendment, Christian orthodoxy has never been a test for public office. But it is striking that Trump has surrounded himself with cadre of prosperity evangelists who cheerfully attack basic Christian doctrines. The focus of this unity is a gospel that is about as diametrically opposed to the biblical one as you can imagine.\n\nAD\n\nSince \u201cevangelical\u201d comes from the word \u201cgospel,\u201d that should make more of a difference to those who wear the label than it does at the moment. The prosperity gospel may be our nation\u2019s new civil religion. It doesn\u2019t offend anyone (but picky Christians). It tells us everything we want to hear and nothing that we need to hear most.\n\nWant more stories about faith?
