Dallas Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott ended his preseason holdout by agreeing to a new six-year contract worth $90 million ($50 million of which is guaranteed), while Los Angeles Rams quarterback Jared Goff landed a four-year, $134 million contract extension that includes an NFL record $110 million in guaranteed money.\n\nWhile Goff's new deal is a record-setter (NFL contracts are famously not fully guaranteed, which means players can be cut before the end of a deal without receiving any non-guaranteed money) and it will pay him an average annual salary of $33.5 million, the deal still does not make the 24-year-old Rams quarterback the NFL's highest-paid player. That fiscal honor still belongs to Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson, 30, who signed a four-year deal in April 2019 that pays him $35 million per season.\n\nMeanwhile, Elliott's new deal makes him the NFL's highest-paid NFL running back ever, he's still not even the highest-paid player on his own team. That would be Cowboys defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence (more on that, below).", "description": "From Seattle's Russell Wilson to Green Bay's Aaron Rodgers, these are each NFL team's highest-paid players, according to their average annual salary.", "authors": ["Tom Huddleston Jr."], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106116870-1567802402259nflrodgersmack.jpg?v=1567802427", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
