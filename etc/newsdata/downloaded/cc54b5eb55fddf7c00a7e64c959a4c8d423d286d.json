That month, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) requested that the agency watchdog expand its ongoing probe to include Daniel Jorjani, the agency\u2019s principal deputy solicitor. He also called on the Department of Justice to investigate whether Jorjani lied to Congress about his involvement during a May confirmation hearing.\n\nMark Greenblatt, the agency\u2019s inspector general, confirmed the expanded scope of the probe in a pair of letters sent Friday to Wyden and Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.), who also requested an investigation.\n\n\u201cOur on-going review will holistically examine the expanded FOIA process, including the involvement of senior officials,\u201d Greenblatt wrote.\n\nJorjani\u2019s nomination could come to the Senate floor for a final vote next week. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Thursday filed cloture to advance the nomination. Wyden previously promised to try to block the vote over his concerns that Jorjani perjured himself.\n\nResponding to Friday\u2019s news, Wyden said that \u201cthese are not normal times\u201d and it comes as \u201cno surprise\u201d that another Trump nominee is under investigation.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s Interior is corrupt to its core, starting at the top,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cDaniel Jorjani is another in a long list of unqualified industry insiders and has no business working in the Interior Department. McConnell cannot ignore these serious allegations. He should cancel the vote.\u201d\n\nAn Interior spokesperson said in an email that the agency is continuing to work with the inspector general on its ongoing review.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that Senator Wyden continues to resort to misguided attacks on one of the most qualified candidates to ever be nominated for the solicitor position at the Department of the Interior,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWe appreciate Senator McConnell\u2019s willingness to bring his nomination to a vote, so the Department can finally have a Senate-confirmed Solicitor in place.\u201d\n\nLate last year, before resigning under a cloud of ethics scandals, former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke signed an order that put Jorjani, a loyal political appointee, in charge of the agency\u2019s FOIA program. Jorjani once told colleagues that \u201cat the end of the day, our job is to protect the Secretary\u201d from ethics probes and bad press.\n\nAt his May confirmation hearing, Jorjani \u2015 the \u201cchief FOIA officer,\u201d per Zinke\u2019s order \u2015 was asked who oversees FOIA requests to the agency.\n\n\u201cI, myself, don\u2019t review FOIAs or make determinations,\u201d Jorjani said. In a subsequent written response to Wyden, Jorjani said he \u201ctypically did not review records prior to their release under the FOIA.\u201d\n\nPublic records suggest he\u2019s been heavily involved. Documents released by environmental group Earthjustice indicate Jorjani was not only aware of the \u201cawareness review\u201d policy at Interior, but often examined documents before they went out. CQ Roll Call reported in June that Interior political appointees \u201cregularly delayed the release of government records\u201d and in some cases withheld them altogether.", "description": "Daniel Jorjani, the nominee to be the agency\u2019s top lawyer, has been accused of lying to Congress about the agency\u2019s controversial public records policy.", "authors": ["Environment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ccb3d162400003200259c3f.png?cache=qm1y4xm2wd&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
