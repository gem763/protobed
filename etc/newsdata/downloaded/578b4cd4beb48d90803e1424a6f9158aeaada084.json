Many current customers paid for some or all of the trip by credit card. In this situation, the card issuer will be expected to provide a full refund, whether for a package holiday (flights and accommodation bought in the same transaction) or any other purchase.\n\nPeople who paid for a package holiday with a debit card should make a claim under the Atol scheme, which is administered by the CAA.\n\nFor other trips, such as flight-only purchases paid for by debit card, the the first place to seek a remedy is the card issuer. Although there is no legal requirement for debit card issuers to pay out if the supplier collapses, the voluntary \u201cchargeback\u201d scheme should help you out.", "description": "The giant travel company, Thomas Cook, is in a race against time to make a deal with its creditors over a refinancing package.
