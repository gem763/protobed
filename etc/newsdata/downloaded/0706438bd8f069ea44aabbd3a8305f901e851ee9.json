Nationwide stage 2 load shedding has been implemented from 9:00 to 23:00.\n\nThe utility blamed the constraints on a broken coal conveyor belt at Medupi power station in Limpopo, as well as boiler tube leaks at five electricity generating units. There have also been delays in returning units that were on planned maintenance to service, and it is struggling with low diesel supplies to fuel its open cycle gas turbines.\n\n\u201cEskom has become an empty shell that is completely incapable of delivering in its mandate to deliver reliable and sustained provision of electricity. They simply cannot keep the lights on,\u201d the DA said in a statement on Wednesday. The party warned Eskom against using \"rolling blackouts as a bargaining tool for more money\".\n\n\u201cIt would seem as though the embattled utility was more concerned about funding Eskom\u2019s deteriorating operations than the actual job of making it a profitable, efficient and stable energy producer.\u201d\n\nEskom, which does not make a profit from selling electricity to users at current prices, has filed a lawsuit against the National Energy Regulator of South Africa to challenge a decision to grant it a tariff increase below what it was asking for.\n\nThe utility, which has about R450bn in debt, says Nersa's latest price determination has left it with a shortfall of R102bn. The regulator in March extended tariff increases of 9.41%, 8.1% and 5.22% to Eskom over three years. But Eskom wanted 17.1% for 2019/20, 15.4% for 2020/21 and 15.5% for 2021/22.\n\nThe DA on Wednesday noted that Eskom would also be expecting a substantial bailout in Finance Minister Tito Mboweni\u2019s in the upcoming medium-term budget policy statement.\n\nR1 billion a day\n\nThe DA said experts estimate that each stage of the rolling blackouts costs the country about R1 billion per stage per day, the DA said. Also, it may have an impact on matric exams which started on Monday.\n\n\u201cEskom\u2019s monopoly on the production of energy needs to be broken as it hampers economic growth and education. However, the ANC government would rather see the country plunge into darkness than to put its pride aside to bring on board Independent Power Producers to stabilise and diversify the grid.\u201d\n\nThe DA said it would take its plan to fix Eskom \u201cto the Union Buildings\u201d in the coming days.", "description": "Less than a month ago, the DA warned of a growing risk of load shedding, which Eskom denied at the time.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8687/74b3659acc0a48b9a720221da003144c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
