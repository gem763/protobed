The Saturday Night Live actor was seen smiling as he spent time with his yoga instructor wife Hilaria as well as two of their kids\n\nThe Extra guest star was in a black coat over grey sweatpants and black-and-white sneakers with oversized black glasses on.\n\nThe beauty is several months pregnant with her fifth child with Alec.\n\nShe held hands with her eldest daughter Carmen who seemed to be in her pajamas along with a green puffy jacket and rainboots.\n\nRomeo was strapped into a stroller.\n\nAlec and Hilaria are having a baby girl.\n\nThe happy couple are currently expecting their fifth child together, and in an Instagram video posted by Hilaria on Saturday, it has been revealed they are set to welcome another daughter into their brood.\n\nHands full but loving it: His spouse was also in a great mood as she held onto one of her dogs, a puppy\n\nIn the video, the couple's four children - Carmen, six, Rafael, four, Leonardo, three, and Romeo, 16 months - are led into a room by their parents, where they each receive their own baby doll swaddled in a white blanket.\n\nHilaria, 35, then encourages the tots to open up the blanket to reveal the sex of their unborn sibling. Carmen - the couple's oldest child, and currently the only girl of the bunch - is then seen excitedly saying 'It's a girl!' as she notices the baby is wearing pink.\n\nAnd the six year old is no doubt thrilled to finally be getting a baby sister after welcoming three younger brothers, as she previously told her parents she didn't want them to have another boy.\n\nErrands: They enjoyed a a coffee at Mad Man Espresso in Manhattan then bundled up for a walk down a street as the cool fall air could be felt. Next it was a trip to Doggystyle Grooming\n\nSpeaking earlier this year, Hilaria said: 'When I told Carmen I was pregnant with another boy, she came to me and said, \"Mommy, how about you have another girl then you can have another boy?\" And I told her it doesn't work that way.'\n\nAsked what she'll do if she has another boy, she added: 'I would keep on trying ... I'm serious.' Hilaria and Alec, 61, announced they are expecting a fifth child together last month, five months after the health and wellness expert announced she had tragically suffered a miscarriage.\n\nShe wrote on Instagram: 'It is still very early ... but we have learned that there is a little person inside of me. The sound of this strong heart makes me so happy - especially because of the loss we experienced in the spring.\n\nA family of six... for now: Together they have Carmen, six, Rafael, four, Leonardo, three, and Romeo, 16 months; Hilaria is expecting their fifth child\n\n'We want to share this news as we are excited and don't want to hide the pregnancy.\n\n'These first few months are tough with exhaustion and nausea ... and I don't want to have to pretend that I feel ok.\n\n'My one request is that the media not send paparazzi to follow me or buy independent paparazzi photos, hence encouraging them. I want to remain peaceful during this very early time in my pregnancy and getting chased around by cameras is not in the doctor's orders.'\n\nBaldwin finds talking about her pregnancy 'so liberating'.\n\nAll dressed up for fun: The lovebirds are arm in arm on October 7 in New York City\n\n'The one thing that's been liberating is I told people my first trimester.\n\n'It was so stressful for me to have to keep it a secret on top of everything when you don't feel well, and it's like everyone is telling you to not say anything.'\n\nHilaria says there was 'no reason' for her to keep her pregnancy a secret after being so open about her prior miscarriage, and says part of her decision came as she doesn't want to be 'ashamed' if she miscarries again.", "description": "They enjoyed a a coffee at Mad Man Espresso in Manhattan then bundled up for a walk down a street as the cool fall air could be felt.
