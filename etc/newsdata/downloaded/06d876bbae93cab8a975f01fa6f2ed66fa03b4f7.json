But Morales, who is seeking a fourth term, still declared victory and told supporters at the presidential palace that \u201cthe people again imposed their will.\u201d\n\nThe Andean country\u2019s top electoral authority said that with 83% of the vote counted from Sunday\u2019s election, Morales was in first with 45.3%, followed by former President Carlos Mesa with 38.2% for second place in the field of nine candidates.\n\nA special electoral mission from the Organization of American States said it was closely monitoring the election and requested information from the Supreme Electoral Tribunal after the transmission of preliminary results was halted.\n\nIf the results hold, Morales and Mesa will face off in a December ballot in which Morales could be vulnerable to a united opposition.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a runoff,\u201d Mesa told supporters shortly after the first results were announced. He said his coalition had scored \u201can unquestionable triumph,\u201d and called on others parties to join him for a \u201cdefinitive triumph\u201d in the second round.\n\nMorales, 59, a native Aymara from Bolivia\u2019s highlands, came to prominence leading social protests and rose to power as the country\u2019 first indigenous president in 2006. Since then, he coasted to two re-election victories and presided over more than a decade of business-boosting economic growth in South America\u2019s poorest country. Following a boom in commodities prices, Morales paved roads, sent Bolivia\u2019s first satellite to space and curbed inflation. Stadiums, markets, schools, state enterprises and even a village bear his name.\n\nBeing forced into a runoff \u201cis a sharp blow to Morales, whose political success has been impressive and who seemed confident of a first-round win,\u201d said Michael Shifter, head of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based think tank. \u201cMorales\u2019 failure to achieve a first-round victory reflects growing concern about a slowing economy, corruption scandals and his determination to pursue a fourth term in defiance of a national referendum and the Bolivian constitution. Many Bolivians are simply weary. If re-elected, Evo will be in office nearly two decades.\u201d\n\nMesa is a 66-year-old historian who as vice president rose to Bolivia\u2019s top office when his predecessor resigned the presidency in 2003 amid widespread protests. Mesa then stepped aside himself in 2005 amid renewed demonstrations led by Morales, who was then leader of the coca growers union.\n\n\u201cIn a second round the question will be if the opposition can unite behind one candidate,\u201d said Christopher Sabatini, a lecturer at the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University in New York and a senior research fellow at Chatham House. \u201cIn that case Evo may try to divide the opposition and use state resources to guarantee his victory.\u201d\n\nTo avoid a runoff and win outright in Bolivia, Morales would have needed to get 50% of the votes plus one or have 40% and finish 10 percentage points ahead of the nearest challenger.\n\nBolivians also elected all 166 congressional seats. Morales\u2019 Movement Toward Socialism party lost seats although it retained a majority in Congress.\n\nVoting, which was mandatory, was mostly calm, though police said they arrested more than 100 people for violating the country\u2019s rigid election-day rules against drinking, large gatherings or casual driving.\n\nMorales voted early in the coca-growing region of El Chapare, where residents threw flower petals at him and he said he remained confident of his chances.\n\nIn his years in office, he has allied himself with a leftist bloc of Latin American leaders and used revenues from the Andean country\u2019s natural gas and minerals to redistribute wealth among the masses and lift millions out of poverty. Surrounded by nations reeling from economic crises, Bolivia under Morales remains a rare example of stability and growth. The economy has grown by an annual average of about 4.5%, well above the regional average, and the International Monetary Fund predicts it will grow at 4% this year.\n\nMorales, the son of Aymara Indian shepherds, has also been credited for battling racial inequalities.\n\nMany Bolivians, such as vendor Celestino Aguirre still identify with \u201cEvo,\u201d as he\u2019s widely known, saying people shouldn\u2019t criticize him so much. \u201cIt\u2019s not against Evo, it\u2019s against me, against the poor people, against the humble.\u201d\n\nBut Morales also has faced growing dissatisfaction even among his indigenous supporters. Some are frustrated by corruption scandals linked to his administration \u2014 though not Morales himself \u2014 and many by his refusal to accept a referendum on limiting presidential terms. While Bolivians voted to maintain term limits in 2016, the country\u2019s top court, which is seen by critics as friendly to the president, ruled that limits would violate Morales\u2019 political rights as a citizen.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking of a real change because I think that Evo Morales has done what he had to do and should leave by the front door,\u201d said Nicol\u00e1s Choque, a car washer.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Luis Andres Henao in Buenos Aires, Argentina, contributed to this report.", "description": "LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) \u2014 President Evo Morales came out ahead in the first round of Bolivia's presidential election, but he appears to have failed to get", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/20/85ab3b_bolivia-elections-58912-bolivian-president-evo-morales-speaks-supporters-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
