However, the driver can select some mild regenerative braking at the press of a button.\n\nWhether Mini\u2019s Nurburgring attack will create a new challenge among EV manufacturers remains to be seen.\n\nNo doubt Tesla \u2014 which is desperately trying to beat the time recently set by the Porsche Taycan \u2014 will be up for the challenge.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM NEWS.COM.AU", "description": "Well,not regular brakes.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/mini.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
