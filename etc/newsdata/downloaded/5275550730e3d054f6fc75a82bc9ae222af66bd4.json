[Re-recording hits is] kind of scary sometimes so I don\u2019t want to disappoint people, I\u2019ve kept the melody so if somebody knows the tune they can sing along if they want.\n\n'Don't you know us at all?': Phil scoffed, insisting he would be downing the shot in one\n\nGrimacing: Holly wasn't a fan of the shot, but managed to give it a go\n\n'We've slowed it down and put it in a different key, so it\u2019s a little darker.'\n\nRick retired in 1993, just six years after he first made it big, but insists he has zero regrets about bowing out of the spotlight at the time.\n\nOn leaving the music industry, Rick said: 'Pop music is intense, either you put everything in it and give all your life to it or you don't have hits...\n\n'I had enough after four or five years. There's a moment where it ended for sure, I was going to Heathrow to go to New York I had just had enough.\n\n'I stopped the car and had a bit of a tear in my eye and said I can't do this now.'", "description": "Rick Astley got the party going during Wednesday's edition of This Morning when he made Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield do shots with him.", "authors": ["Kate Thomas For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/13/20376678-0-image-a-41_1572443683282.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
