He went on to invite guesses. The tweet reads:\n\n\u201cTRON will partner with a hundred billion USD megacorporation next week. It will not only benefit $TRX but all TRC10&20 tokens including $BTT & $WIN etc. It will broadly distribute TRON Dapps and tokens to billions of customers. TBA. Make a guess?\u201d\n\nSun\u2019s tweet comes at a time when Tron, in sync with the entire crypto market, is experiencing a huge boost in price, showing a massive gain of more than 14% on the day.\n\nAt the beginning of September Justin Sun was accused by crypto market commentator Josh Rager of buying 5,000 to 6,000 Twitter followers per day. Rager said at the time:\n\n\u201cLooks like you're still buying 5,000 to 6,000 followers per day. My favorite stat is how you went from losing net-negative followers per month to gaining 5k followers daily like clock work in late 2018.\u201d\n\nRager did not stop there, and added: \u201cYou're such a meme. I feel sorry for Tron investors.\u201d\n\nLunch with Buffet\n\nIn June, Justin won a charity auction on eBay to have lunch with Warren Buffett, the billionaire CEO of Berkshire Hathaway and a notorious crypto skeptic. Sun\u2019s winning bid was around $4.5 million, the highest bid ever in the event\u2019s 20-year history. However, the Tron CEO was forced to postpone due to medical reasons and recently announced that he would reschedule his charity lunch with Buffett \u201cvery soon.\u201d", "description": "The master of hype and CEO of Tron, Justin Sun, announced that Tron will be partnering with a $100 billion megacorporation no later than next week", "authors": ["Joeri Cant"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy83NzI0Yjg4YWUwODEyODU3ZThmMTllZmI4ZGUzMzFmZi5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
