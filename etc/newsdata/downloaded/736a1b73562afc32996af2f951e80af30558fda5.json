Gavin Newsom signed a controversial bill Wednesday, known as AB 5, after months of uproar from businesses and gig companies like Uber and Lyft. The bill will require businesses to hire workers as employees, not independent contractors, with some exceptions. That will give hundreds of thousands of California workers basic labor rights for the first time.\n\nAnd despite an aggressive lobbying campaign, Uber and Lyft are not exempt.\n\nSenators voted 29-11 in favor of AB 5 last week, and the state assembly approved their amendments to the bill.\n\n\u201cI am now in a position to earn a living wage,\u201d driver Anette Rivero, a member of Rideshare Drivers United, said in a statement to Vox on Wednesday. \u201cInstead of spending over 50 hours a week on the road, I will be able to spend time with my four children and complete my college degree.\u201d\n\nThe new law will crack down on a business model championed and cherished by Silicon Valley \u2014 a striking turn of events for the celebrated tech industry. Uber, Lyft, and other app-based gig companies rely on hundreds of thousands of independent contractors to give rides, deliver food, and complete other tasks.\n\nReclassifying them as employees would change everything.\n\nGig workers would get labor protections and benefits that all employees get, such as unemployment insurance, health care subsidies, paid parental leave, overtime pay, workers\u2019 compensation, paid rest breaks, and a guaranteed $12 minimum hourly wage. And, perhaps more importantly, they could unionize.\n\nThe added cost of these benefits is why gig companies are so desperate for a compromise. They didn\u2019t get one. But that doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t keep trying.\n\n\u201cOur state\u2019s political leadership missed an important opportunity to support the overwhelming majority of rideshare drivers who want a thoughtful solution that balances flexibility with an earnings standard and benefits,\u201d an Lyft spokesperson told Vox last week after the senate vote. \u201cThe fact that there were more than 50 industries carved out of AB5 is very telling. We are fully prepared to take this issue to the voters of California to preserve the freedom and access drivers and riders want and need.\u201d\n\nLyft, Uber, and DoorDash have warned that they were each ready to spend $30 million on a ballot initiative to overturn AB 5. California labor unions, which support AB 5, have vowed to fight back.\n\nThe tussle between labor unions and Uber \u2014 one of Silicon Valley\u2019s most beloved investments \u2014 was perhaps the most consequential legislative battle taking place in the country. Newsom\u2019s endorsement of AB 5 was stunning loss for the tech industry and a remarkable victory for labor unions. And the bill\u2019s passage will likely open the door for other Democratic-controlled states to do the same.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s AB 5 bill, explained\n\nThe California bill, known as AB 5, expands a groundbreaking California Supreme Court decision last year known as Dynamex. The ruling and the bill instruct businesses to use the so-called ABC test to figure out whether a worker is an employee. To hire an independent contractor, businesses must prove that the worker a) is free from the company\u2019s control, b) is doing work that isn\u2019t central to the company\u2019s business, and c) has an independent business in that industry. If they don\u2019t meet all three of those conditions, then they have to be classified as employees.\n\nThat is a much clearer \u2014 and stricter \u2014 standard of proof than the vague guidelines under federal law. And it\u2019s one of the biggest challenges yet to the profit model of Uber, Instacart, Postmates, and other tech companies that rely on a small army of independent contractors. Uber likely will have to reclassify tens of thousands of drivers in California as employees, something Uber drivers have been fighting for in court, unsuccessfully, for years.\n\nSince the bill passed the state assembly in May, California businesses had been panicking over the possibility of it passing. The state\u2019s Chamber of Commerce and dozens of industry groups lobbied for exemptions, and a long list of professions was excluded from the bill: doctors, dentists, lawyers, architects, insurance agents, accountants, engineers, financial advisers, real estate agents, and hairstylists who rent booths at salons.\n\nUber and Lyft, in particular, had been lobbying for an exemption to the bill in the Senate. They\u2019ve even begged in public for a compromise. The companies hoped to keep treating drivers as contractors, and in exchange, they promised to set a minimum pay rate for drivers while they\u2019re picking up and dropping off passengers, create a company-backed fund for benefits like paid time off, and establish an association for drivers to advocate for further improvements.\n\nDrivers who had been organizing in support of AB 5 hit back with their own messaging, saying nothing in the law would stop the companies from offering schedule flexibility to employees.\n\nThat didn\u2019t stop Uber and Lyft from ramping up their campaign to get an exemption. In recent weeks, Uber and Lyft had been emailing drivers and passengers in California, begging them to contact their lawmakers to urge them to compromise.\n\n\u201cHelp protect rideshare in California,\u201d read one message sent to Lyft customers on Aug. 28. They were never able to strike a deal.\n\nRide-hailing apps have done everything to keep drivers as contractors\n\nWhen Uber drivers went on strike across the world in May, much of their frustration had to do with their lack of power as independent contractors.\n\nUber\u2019s profit model, like that of other companies in the gig economy, depends on all the money saved from skirting US labor laws.\n\nBy classifying drivers as independent contractors instead of employees, Uber hasn\u2019t needed to pay certain taxes, benefits, overtime, or minimum wages to tens of thousands of drivers. As self-employed contractors, drivers haven\u2019t had a legal right to form labor unions or negotiate contracts.\n\nUntil now.\n\nUber drivers have spent more than six years fighting the company in court, saying they\u2019ve been intentionally misclassified. They argued that drivers should be considered employees because the company has so much control over their workday, including strict rules on their vehicle conditions, what rides they can take, and which routes to use.\n\nOver the years, Uber has refused to reclassify drivers, maintaining that drivers are not employees because they set their own schedules and provide their own cars.\n\nHowever, in May, Uber settled the main court case with 13,600 Uber drivers, agreeing to pay them $20 million but without changing their status as independent contractors. The other 350,000 drivers who were part of the initial class-action lawsuit had signed mandatory arbitration agreements, so a federal judge is requiring them to pursue their cases in a private forum, where they are less likely to win their case.\n\nBut it will be hard for Uber to pass the ABC test that will soon become law; driving people around in cars is a central part of the company\u2019s business. Any challenge to the drivers\u2019 status as contractors threatens Uber\u2019s bottom line, which is another reason the bill is so significant.\n\nUber has been upfront with investors about the risk of a labor revolt. In a recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Uber acknowledged that giving drivers the same legal rights as employees would \u201cfundamentally change\u201d the company\u2019s financial model:\n\nIf, as a result of legislation or judicial decisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees ... we would incur significant additional expenses for compensating Drivers, potentially including expenses associated with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, social security contributions, taxes, and penalties.\n\nSo it\u2019s unsurprising that Uber is not happy about a law that would force the company to hire drivers as employees.\n\nAs employees, gig workers would have a safety net for the first time ever. The changes from the law will also reportedly benefit the state of California, which estimates that it loses $7 billion in tax revenue each year from companies that misclassify employees. California has the largest state economy in the country and is home to the Silicon Valley tech industry \u2014 which means its lawmakers have outsize influence in national politics. The law could lead other states to take similar action.\n\n\u201cHere we are in a great economy and yet most working people have no money saved,\u201d Caitlin Vega, legislative director for the California Labor Federation, told me at the time when the bill first passed the state assembly. \u201c[Companies] are doing this because they can; they\u2019ve gotten away with it.\u201d\n\nFor a while, it was unclear whether Newsom would sign AB 5 without a carveout for gig companies. That changed on Labor Day.\n\n\u201cEmployers shirk responsibility to safety net programs like workers\u2019 compensation and unemployment insurance. Taxpayers are left to foot the bill,\u201d Newsom wrote in an op-ed piece published Monday in the Sacramento Bee.\n\nThe governor\u2019s support for AB 5 cemented Uber\u2019s defeat on the issue.", "description": "Senate lawmakers passed a controversial bill, known as AB 5, after months of uproar from businesses and gig companies such as Uber and Lyft.
