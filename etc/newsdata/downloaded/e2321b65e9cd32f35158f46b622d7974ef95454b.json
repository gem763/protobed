So we\u2019re all clear, this is Myles Garrett:\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nCleveland's Myles Garrett says an anonymous fan tried to sucker punch him. (Getty Images)\n\nIs he the largest player in the NFL? No. But he\u2019s listed at 6-foot-4, 272 pounds, and he has roughly 5 percent body fat. Maybe 6 percent if he\u2019s eaten a cheeseburger recently. And he runs a 40-yard dash as fast as some running backs.\n\nNow that we\u2019ve gotten that visual, let\u2019s turn back to impetus for this post.\n\nGarrett tweeted the following on Wednesday afternoon:\n\nA \u201cfan\u201d hopped out his car to take a picture with me and then punched me in my face. Hm, put your legs into it might have actually made me flinch. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe \u2014 Myles \"Flash\" Garrett \u26a1\ufe0f (@MylesLGarrett) October 16, 2019\n\n\u201cA \u2018fan\u2019 hopped out his car to take a picture with me and then punched me in my face,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHm, put your legs into it might have actually made me flinch.\u201d\n\nWhen someone said they were sorry that happened to him, Garrett explained a bit more about what happened:\n\n\u201cWas in my car, flagged me down for a picture and I cracked the window enough for the camera to get my face. Took the pic and [then] gave me a pillow tap.\u201d\n\nCompounding the dummy-ness was that police have managed to identify the puncher as a 24-year-old Strongsville man through his license plate, according to cleveland.com.\n\nWhoever you are, Dummy of the Day, you have truly earned the award. As well as a trip to the police station, most likely.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "What kind of fool does something like this?", "authors": ["Shalise Manza Young"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/KR7DaT8YldSAAM8M.HxKNw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD05NjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/NnPCvaB3UdJ0ZWM.Rki9bw--~B/aD0yNzAwO3c9MzYwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/05afcc30-f05e-11e9-afdb-299c11dfc312", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
