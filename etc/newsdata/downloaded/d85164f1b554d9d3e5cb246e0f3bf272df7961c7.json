Green Party Leader Andrew Weaver has announced he will be stepping down as party leader and will not run for re-election in the riding of Oak Bay-Gordon Head in the 2021 provincial election.\n\nWeaver says he will stay on as party leader until a replacement is found.\n\n\"The decision not to run for re-election has not been easy for me,\" he said.\n\n\"I feel a deep responsibility and pride for the role the B.C. Greens have played in getting the province back on track to meet its climate commitments and to reframe climate change as an economic opportunity \u2014 instead of a purely environmental catastrophe.\"\n\nThe announcement does not immediately change the balance of power in the province, where the three-member Green Party caucus currently supports the minority NDP government through a confidence and supply agreement.\n\nThe NDP holds 41 seats, the Greens three and the Liberals 42 seats.

Members of the Green Party say they respect his decision and it will be business as usual at the legislature. 1:17\n\nIn an interview with CBC in December 2018, Weaver said he found his role of providing sober second thought and oversight to the government rewarding. He also hinted at the heavy workload involved in the position.\n\nWeaver told the assembled media in Victoria on Monday morning that he'd been thinking about his future in politics since the summer, and denied that a recent health issue had anything to do with his decision.\n\nOn Sept. 16, Weaver tweeted that he had suddenly taken ill with labyrinthitis, an inner-ear disorder that can induce dizziness, nausea and loss of hearing.\n\nWeaver said he has no intentions of running federally.\n\nUnder Weaver, the B.C.
