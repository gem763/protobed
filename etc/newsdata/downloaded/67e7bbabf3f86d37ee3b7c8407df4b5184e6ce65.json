Democratic leaders are incoherent on the subject, with Jerry Nadler crowing that he\u2019s proceeding with a formal impeachment inquiry and Steny Hoyer insisting that a formal impeachment inquiry doesn\u2019t exist. It\u2019s Schrodinger\u2019s impeachment! Trump now exists in a quantum state where he both is and isn\u2019t the subject of an impeachment investigation.\n\nPelosi couldn\u2019t hide her irritation at Democrats\u2019 predicament in her press conference this morning, flashing annoyance more than once as you\u2019ll see below. The presser ended with her whining that reporters should go bother Mitch McConnell about America\u2019s problem with gun violence instead of hassling her with questions about a topic on which she has nothing new to offer. This has become a bona fide liability for the party (albeit temporarily), as Ed noted in his post earlier, with the Democratic faithful glum at the cynicism of its leaders\u2019 doublespeak and discouraged by their lack of nerve. I think Pelosi believed the left\u2019s interest in impeachment would fade over the course of the summer as interest in the presidential race rose. But Nadler appears to have surprised her by taking a greater interest in it than she anticipated and Dem backbenchers have come under pressure back home to take a stand.\n\nResult: It looks now like the base won\u2019t fully abandon impeachment until primary voting begins next year, at which point rolling a political grenade into America\u2019s electoral tent would be too risky to justify. That means five more months of her having to lamely dodge questions like these from reporters and aggravating lefties in the process. If only she could just tell the truth \u2014 the \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d is nothing more than a taxpayer-funded oppo research operation, with the fruits of Nadler\u2019s investigation to be weaponized not in an impeachment proceeding but by the Democratic nominee next fall. It must be maddening for Pelosi to have lefties asking her \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you doing anything to stop Trump?\u201d when House Dems are doing exactly what she thinks is the best way to stop him. Find his dirty laundry, air it, then beat him at the polls. That\u2019s the only way to actually oust him. He could go on a multistate killing spree and McConnell\u2019s Republican caucus still wouldn\u2019t vote to remove him from office as part of an impeachment proceeding.\n\nMaybe the sheer cynicism of Democrats\u2019 dissembling on impeachment is an asset to them at this point insofar as it\u2019s bound to cause lefties to lose interest. Pelosi\u2019s obviously not going to pull the trigger; she doesn\u2019t even want to answer questions on the subject; how many hints does she need to drop to progressives to get off her back and move on already? They can be mad at her if they want. She rules with an iron fist, and if her strategy of forgoing impeachment in order to beat Trump next fall pays off, no liberal will hold her tactics against her in hindsight.\n\n\n\n", "description": "\"I have said what I'm going to say on the subject.
