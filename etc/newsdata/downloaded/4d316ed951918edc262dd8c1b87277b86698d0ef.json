Human Rights Council despite strong opposition", "language": "en", "text": "Oct. 18 (UPI) \u2014 Venezuela has won a seat on the U.N. Human Rights Council, attracting the condemnation of human rights organizations and the United States.\n\nA total of 14 countries were voted into the 47-seat influential council on Thursday, with Venezuela and Brazil winning the two seats allocated for Latin American and Caribbean states, beating out Costa Rica.\n\nOf the 193 ballots cast, Brazil received 153 and Venezuela got 105 to Costa Rica\u2019s 96, according to the U.N. General Assembly.\n\n\u201cVictory at the U.N.!\u201d embattled Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro tweeted following the announcement. \u201cWith 105 votes in favor, Venezuela enters the United Nations Human Rights Council as a free and sovereign country. Above the threats, our Bolivarian Diplomacy of Peace and the free self-determination of the peoples triumphed. Long live the country!\u201d\n\nVenezuela won a two-year seat despite over 50 countries deeming Maduro to be the illegitimate ruler of the South American nation, which has experienced a mass exodus of citizens in recent years due to its crushing economic situation and human rights abuses that the United States blames on the Maduro regime.\n\nKelly Craft, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, condemned Venezuela\u2019s inclusion on the council as \u201can embarrassment to the United Nations and a tragedy for the people of Venezuela.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat one of the world\u2019s worst human-rights abusers would be granted a seat on a body that is supposed to defend human rights is utterly appalling,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cThe people of Venezuela should rest assured that Maduro cannot hide behind the cloak of an illegitimate body like the Human Rights Council.\u201d\n\nVenezuela\u2019s inclusion on Thursday is \u201cironclad proof\u201d that the council is broken and further reinforces the Trump administration\u2019s 2018 decision to withdraw from the committee, she said.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said the countries who cast their secret ballots for Venezuela\u2019s inclusion dealt \u201ca harsh blow\u201d to the cause of international human rights.\n\n\u201cThe election to the Human Rights Council of Maduro\u2019s representative is a farce that further undermines the council\u2019s already frail credibility,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nFollowing the vote, UN Watch, a nonprofit organization that monitors the intergovernmental organization, began a petition to expel Maduro from the council, citing extrajudicial killings, torture, the jailing of political prisoners and other human rights violations committed by the regime.\n\n\u201cElecting the oppressive Venezuelan regime of Nicolas Maduro to a human rights council is like making a pyromaniac into the town fire chief,\u201d UN Watch Executive Director Hillel Neuer said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s absurd, immoral and offensive.\u201d\n\nThe Geneva-based U.N. monitor, which campaigned in 2010 to have Libya removed from the council, said three other newly elected nations \u2014 Mauritania, Libya and Sudan \u2014 all had poor human rights records.\n\n\u201cSadly, today, the U.N. General Assembly disregarded its own rules by electing regimes that violate the human rights of their own citizens, and which consistently vote the wrong way on U.N. initiatives to protect the human rights of others,\u201d Neuer said.\n\nVenezuela\u2019s inclusion follows U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet releasing a report in July that documents \u201cgrave violations\u201d of economic, social, civil, political and cultural rights committed in the country.\n\nThe United States has been leading a campaign of sanctions and diplomatic pressure on the Maduro regime to step down after his re-election was deemed illegitimate last year by the opposition-controlled Venezuelan National Assembly.\n\nLast month, 15 Latin American countries applied sanctions against the Maduro regime, charging it of money laundering, illegal drug trafficking, terrorism and committing human rights violations.", "description": "Oct. 18 (UPI) \u2014 Venezuela has won a seat on the U.N.
