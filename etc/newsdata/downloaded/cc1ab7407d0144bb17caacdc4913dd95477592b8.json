The Tibetans, ethnically and religiously distinct from the Han Chinese, have attempted to liberate themselves from communism unsuccessfully for decades. Chen Quanguo, Xinjiang\u2019s current top Communist Party official, moved there after brutally crushing Buddhist movements in Tibet.\n\n\u201cAnyone who attempts to split any region from China will perish, with their bodies smashed and bones ground to powder,\u201d the Chinese Foreign Ministry quoted Xi as stating in Nepal, where he landed this weekend following a meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Chennai. \u201cAny external forces that support the splitting of China can only be regarded as delusional by the Chinese people.\u201d\n\nPrior to Xi arriving in India, Indian authorities arrested at least nine ethnic Tibetan exiles, some but not all confirmed as activists, to prevent them from freely speaking out against the abuses of the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nXinhua, the Chinese state news agency, modified Xi\u2019s remarks to sound less violent.\n\n\u201cAnyone attempting separatist activities in any part of China will be crushed and any external force backing such attempts will be deemed by the Chinese people as pipe-dreaming,\u201d Xinhua quoted Xi as saying.\n\nThe state propaganda agency emphasized Xi\u2019s comments calling for deeper trade cooperation with Nepal. The article did not mention China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), its global domination plan through predatory lending and infrastructure development, but Xi did reportedly mention projects that belong to the BRI, such as China\u2019s proposal to \u201cupgrade\u201d Nepal\u2019s highways and train systems and the \u201cTrans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network.\u201d\n\nXi\u2019s threat to turn the bones of people seeking freedom into dust follow an alarming speech on the morbid anniversary of Communist Party rule in China on October 1.\n\n\u201cWe must uphold the principles of \u2018Peaceful Reunification\u2019 and \u2018One Country, Two Systems,\u2019 maintain lasting prosperity and stability in Hong Kong and Macao, promote the peaceful development of cross-Strait relations, unite all Chinese sons and daughters, and continue to strive for the motherland\u2019s complete reunification,\u201d Xi said following his march in a parade featuring multiple gigantic floats featuring his likeness, eclipsing the image of Mao Zedong hanging above Tiananmen Square.\n\n\u201cOne Country, Two Systems\u201d is an agreement between China and Hong Kong that bans Hong Kong from seeking independence but bans China from imposing communism. Xi\u2019s insistent attempts at violating the policy have triggered a wave of protests in the city that just entered its 20th week. Xi has called for Taiwan to allow itself to be annexed and governed like Hong Kong, an offer the sovereign nation has repeatedly rejected.\n\nXi\u2019s call to \u201cunite all Chinese sons and daughters\u201d also included the imposition of his rule on ethnic Han Chinese people outside of \u201cmainland China.\u201d Chinese operatives have repeatedly used violence to silence dissent in free countries such as Australia and New Zealand and Xi has imposed himself using the military in the South China Sea, illegally squatting in territory belonging to Taiwan, Brunei, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Malaysia.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s President Tsai Ing-wen responded to Xi\u2019s National Day speech during the celebrations honoring the establishing of a free Taiwan last week.\n\n\u201cWe are witnessing China\u2019s rise and expansion, as they challenge free, democratic values and the global order through a combination of authoritarianism, nationalism, and economic might,\u201d Tsai said. \u201cAs the strategic forefront of the Indo-Pacific region, Taiwan has become the first line of defense for democratic values.\u201d\n\n\u201cChina is encroaching on us through their sharp power, but as a crucial member of the region, we know that Taiwan must fulfill its responsibilities to the international community. We will not act provocatively or rashly; rather, we will work with like-minded countries to ensure that the peaceful and stable cross-strait status quo is not unilaterally altered,\u201d she added.\n\nProtests continued against Xi in Hong Kong this weekend, undeterred by his threat to crush them. Protesters have made five demands of their government: the full withdrawal of a bill that would allow extradition to China; freedom for political prisoners; an independent investigation into police brutality; direct election of lawmakers; and an end to being called \u201crioters.\u201d Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam promised to push the legislature to withdraw the extradition bill but has ignored the other demands. This month, she imposed a ban on face coverings in the region, as protesters often need gas masks to protect from the police\u2019s use of tear gas to injure protesters.\n\nThousands took the streets on Saturday and Sunday wearing masks. Some, as protest leader Joshua Wong noted in a photo on Twitter, covered their faces with masks of Xi Jinping, directly challenging the head of the Party.\n\nPresident Xi, 5 demands, not one less! pic.twitter.com/eZxwSlZ6oi \u2014 Joshua Wong \u9ec3\u4e4b\u92d2 \ud83d\ude37 (@joshuawongcf) October 13, 2019\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "Chinese dictator Xi Jinping threatened anti-communist dissidents with a gruesome death in remarks Sunday during a visit to Nepal.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/on-tour-Xi-Jinping-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
