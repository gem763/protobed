That prohibition has served several presidents well since the stormy tenure of Henry Kissinger, who is the only person to have served as both national security adviser and secretary of State. When Donald Trump last week decided against giving the national security adviser title to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the president wisely abided by the Kissinger rule.\n\nBut in his selection Wednesday of lawyer Robert O\u2019Brien, who has most recently served as hostage negotiator at the State Department, Trump might have broken a second, even more important, rule. Presidents should worry at least as much about a weak national security adviser as a strong one. O\u2019Brien could end up growing into the role, but with an irregular president, a lower public profile and limited national security policymaking experience, he will have to work hard to avoid the frustrations and failures of his weak predecessors.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nPower in Washington doesn\u2019t just come from one\u2019s position on the organizational chart. In sizing up a national security adviser\u2014whether one new to the job or a few years in\u2014we should ask a series of questions. Is the person close to the president, personally, politically or ideologically? Does he or she have a deep well of trust with Cabinet colleagues and the wider national security community? Does the adviser know well both the levers of government and those serving in it?\n\nFew have a perfect score of \u201cyeses\u201d on this questionnaire, but history since Kissinger\u2019s reign suggests that national security advisers struggle when the answer to too many of those questions is \u201cno.\u201d Even as those in government worry about the power hungry, they generally understand what to do with them: either fall in line, outflank them or wait patiently for them to overshoot and fall on their faces. Those inside government, however, tend to have a harder time when officials in positions of authority lack the power to do the job. When a leader struggles to keep up or stay on task, everyone\u2019s days get longer, and their jobs get harder. Nowhere is that truer than in national security, a business that attracts people who respect authority and expect order.\n\nWhen a weaker national security adviser\u2014whose job, after all, is coordination\u2014struggles to manage the process and the president, Washington becomes disorderly.\n\nThe misbegotten tenure of Robert \u201cBud\u201d McFarlane, who became President Ronald Reagan\u2019s third national security adviser in October 1983, is particularly instructive. A retired Marine colonel who had served as a military aide to Kissinger, McFarlane aspired if not to his former boss\u2019 fame (or infamy), than at least his accomplishments. Reagan\u2019s first pick for national security adviser had resigned amid controversy, and the president grew tired of the fighting between his second pick and others on the National Security Council. When McFarlane was chosen, he thought his moment to make history had arrived.\n\nBut the job never lived up to McFarlane\u2019s expectations; he had little stature in the system, authority with his colleagues or relationship with the president. Reagan had downgraded the national security adviser position to avoid the drama of Richard Nixon\u2019s White House and instead delegated more authority to Cabinet members at the agencies. But when it came to the civil war in Lebanon, the Cold War and other issues, Secretary of State George Shultz and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger fought to the point of a paralysis, which Reagan\u2014who had little interest in the details\u2014and McFarlane could rarely break.\n\nAfter more than two years in office, an exhausted McFarlane quit, reportedly telling friends that he had grown tired of \u201ctrying to move all these elephants around.\u201d But the trampling was done: Without the power to manage up, McFarlane had struggled to manage at all. In the resulting disarray, several strong-willed aides on the NSC pursued a scheme, with the knowledge of McFarlane and his successor, to sell arms to Iran and funnel the proceeds to those battling the government in Nicaragua. The Iran-Contra affair nearly brought down the Reagan presidency and left McFarlane, who later pleaded guilty for his role in the controversy before being pardoned, despondent. In 1987, he attempted to kill himself and survived.\n\nNone of McFarlane\u2019s successors fell as far, but many have struggled with a hard job all the same. Tony Lake, who as Kissinger\u2019s special assistant had learned up close about the damage an overbearing national security adviser could do, was so concerned about being too strong in the role that he struggled for almost two years to find a way to help a reluctant President Bill Clinton respond to the war in Bosnia. Condoleezza Rice, who was considered almost as close as family to George W. Bush, never effectively mediated the quarrels between Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of State Colin Powell and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. Although former Marine commandant James Jones looked like a national security adviser when Barack Obama gave him the job, he struggled to catch a rhythm with the new president and his young staff, and to bridge the tensions with the Pentagon over the war in Afghanistan.\n\nWhile O\u2019Brien is not a longtime Washington insider, most in Washington would agree with what Trump said Wednesday, \u201cHe\u2019s a very talented man.\u201d The former Army reservist has been active in Republican foreign policy circles and is close to his predecessor, John Bolton, having served with him in the Bush administration. A lawyer who worked on initiatives to promote the rule of law in Afghanistan, O\u2019Brien seems to have built productive relationships with Trump and Pompeo, while working to secure the release of hostages around the world.\n\nBut whether the new adviser, whom Trump reportedly believes \u201clooks the part,\u201d is up to moving around the elephants, including an unmanageable president who thinks the job is \u201ceasy,\u201d is still to be seen. A quick review of the national security adviser questionnaire above, applied to O\u2019Brien, results in either \u201cnoes\u201d or affirmative answers quickly qualified with more questions: Yes, he has a relationship with the president, but how close could it be? Such qualifiers leave some doubt about O\u2019Brien\u2019s chances in an already disorderly Washington, where the second rule of national security advisers seems to have been broken once again.", "description": "A lesson for Robert O\u2019Brien: When the person in that role lacks authority, disorder follows.", "authors": ["Michael Kruse", "John Gans"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/f3/4e/f277f9ca4973af9ab221ec7a718b/190919-gans-obrientrump-ap.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
