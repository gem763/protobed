A new government would be returned just weeks before the new January 31 Brexit deadline.\n\nShadow Justice Secretary Richard Burgon declared \"we believe we're going to win it\" as he proclaimed: \"We want to get Boris Johnson out by Christmas!\"\n\nBut no matter what happens Boris Johnson won't be the shortest-serving PM in history - as he will have outlasted George Canning's 119 days in 1827.\n\nThe change comes at a crucial time as MPs vote tonight on a Bill by Boris Johnson to trigger a general election on December 12.\n\nCrucially Labour have not yet explicitly confirmed that they will back the Bill, there are still wranglings over the date and Mr Corbyn faces an angry Labour revolt.\n\nBut while Labour may bring amendments over the date or votes for 16-year-olds tonight, the party is not expected to wreck the bid for an election.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nBut even without Labour support, the Bill was already expected to pass due to some agreement between the Tories, Lib Dems and SNP.\n\nIf it is backed by Labour's leader, it will be almost impossible for the Bill to fail even if there is a huge Labour rebellion.\n\nDozens of Labour MPs could rebel if they are whipped to back an election. Some 38 voted directly against holding a general election last night.\n\nAnd a string of prominent Tories were also furious at Boris Johnson's decision to push ahead with an election instead of trying to pass his Brexit deal in Parliament.\n\nBut if the Tory and Labour front benches were to unite in tonight's vote an election would be guaranteed.\n\nJeremy Corbyn declared today: \"We're going to go out there with the biggest campaign this party has ever mounted.\n\n\"Totally united. Totally determined and I'm looking forward to going to every part of this country with my wonderful shadow cabinet team here and all the fantastic Labour activists to give a message of hope where there isn't one with this government.\"\n\nMr Corbyn refused to confirm if Labour would still bring amendments to the Bill - which could push to extend votes to EU citizens or 16-year-olds.\n\nHe told the BBC: \"There'll be a parliamentary process this afternoon, we're going out to fight an election campaign and I can't wait to get out there, on every town and village in this country, with a message of real hope where this government offers nothing.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images Europe)\n\nLabour's decision came after months of internal wrangling in the party.\n\nJeremy Corbyn and his closest aides back an election. But many Labour MPs fear they\u2019ll suffer at the ballot box for their Brexit stance - which involves first negotiating a deal but then having a referendum on it.\n\nCrucially Labour had said it wouldn't back an election until no-deal Brexit is off the table.\n\nPreviously this meant delaying Brexit until January, which has now happened. But there was confusion as Mr Corbyn then said it included the threat of a no-deal Brexit in 2021 that's tied up in Boris Johnson's plans.\n\nMr Corbyn was also publicly sceptical ahead of time - saying a December 12 election could disenfranchise students at the end of term and \"it will be dark before 4pm\".\n\nBut he did signal Labour could back a December 9 election because it wouldn't disenfranchise students.\n\nAnd Labour had faced being bounced into an election anyway after the SNP and Lib Dems agreed to back it.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThe breakthrough came at today's meeting of the shadow cabinet at 9.30am.\n\nAccording to a statement released by his office, Mr Corbyn told his top team: \"I have consistently said that we are ready for an election and our support is subject to a No Deal Brexit being off the table.\n\n\"We have now heard from the EU that the extension of Article 50 to January 31 has been confirmed, so for the next three months, our condition of taking No Deal off the table has now been met.\n\n\"We will now launch the most ambitious and radical campaign for real change our country has ever seen.\"\n\nShadow Justice Secretary Richard Burgon told Sky News: \"We've avoided a no deal Brexit. That's been taken off the table because the EU have extended the deadline to January 31.\n\n\"That means Boris Johnson, who is deeply untrustworthy, can't therefore push us out on a no-deal Brexit during a general election campaign.\n\n\"So Jeremy has made it clear, John McDonnell's made it clear, the team has decided we will be backing a general election because we can't leave these Tories in power any longer.\n\n\"They've done so much damage across the country in terms of austerity and public services, and we've got a manifesto of hope that will deliver a better society for everyone in our country.\n\n\"So we're up for the fight and we believe we're going to win it. We believe we can make Boris Johnson the shortest-serving Prime Minister.\"\n\nBoris Johnson's Brexit deal explained Boris Johnson finally agreed a Brexit deal with the EU on 17 October 2019, though it still needs approval by MPs and is now on ice. The 64-page list of amendments keeps a transition period up to 31 December 2020 and the \u00a339bn divorce bill. But it scraps the Irish backstop, an insurance policy designed at preventing a hard border between Northern Ireland the Republic. In the backstop's place would effectively be 'two borders' in a hybrid system: Northern Ireland and Britain would share a legal customs territory - technically forcing customs checks on goods crossing the 310-mile border with the Republic. But in practice, to avoid checks at the border, the checks will instead happen when goods reach Northern Ireland on the island of Ireland. Critics say this puts a customs border across the Irish Sea - more of this below. Northern Ireland and the Republic would share some EU single market rules - forcing checks on manufactured and agricultural products crossing the Irish Sea. The Northern Ireland Assembly - known as Stormont - will get a vote every four years on whether to let EU law continue. But this vote could be passed by a simple majority - denying the DUP a veto on staying under EU laws long-term. Meanwhile commitments on workers' rights are deprioritised - moved to the non-legally-binding Political Declaration for agreement later.

Amendments are then expected in a two-hour flurry before final votes after 7pm. The Bill would then go to the House of Lords.\n\nIn order the pass the Bill, Boris Johnson will need a 'simple majority' of at least half of MPs voting. That's, at most, 320 MPs.\n\nLabour MP Stella Creasy hit out furiously at the tight timetable - which will also compress warring amendments into a single combined vote. MPs could still vote the timetable down, throwing the day into disarray.\n\nWhen will a general election be held?\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nBoris Johnson wanted an election on Thursday 12 December. But the Lib Dems wanted Monday 9 December.\n\nReports suggested they would reach a compromise date in between.\n\nTory minister Brandon Lewis said December 9 is too early because Parliament would have to dissolve this week - in order to have a 25 working day countdown.\n\n\"That wouldn\u2019t give us time to get this Bill through and a couple of small pieces of legislation we need to do including some budgetary issues for Northern Ireland,\" he said. \"December 12 means we can dissolve next week and have time to get that legislation properly through Parliament.\"\n\nLib Dem MP Chuka Umunna said \"we're not going to accept the 12th\" but left the door open to a compromise in between. Labour's Barry Gardiner said December 9 \"certainly would\" be better than December 12.\n\nCan EU citizens vote in a general election?\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nNo.\n\nEU citizens living in the UK can register to vote, and can vote in the following:\n\nEuropean Parliament elections (though you have to fill out a form called UC1 to prove you're not also voting in another country).\n\n(though you have to fill out a form called UC1 to prove you're not also voting in another country). Council elections\n\nPolice and Crime Commissioners\n\nLondon mayoral and Assembly\n\nNorthern Ireland and Welsh Assemblies and Scottish Parliament\n\nBut EU citizens cannot vote in UK Parliament elections - a general election - unless they are citizens of the Republic of Ireland, Cyprus or Malta. For more information click here.\n\nWhen is the register to vote deadline?\n\nIt is always 12 working days before polling day. So if there's an election on December 12, it will be on November 26.\n\nWill the general election vote pass tonight?\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nIf Labour back it, yes. Even if they don't it will probably pass, as long as the SNP and Lib Dems reach an agreement over a date.\n\nParliament has 288 Tory MPs, 35 SNP MPs and 19 Lib Dems - more than enough to get the 320 votes for a majority, even if 20 or so rebel.\n\nThat means Boris Johnson wouldn't need Labour or the other smaller parties like Plaid Cymru, Greens or Independents to get it through.\n\nMany of the 21 expelled ex-Tories also backed an election on Monday night, including former Cabinet bigwigs David Gauke, Amber Rudd and Greg Clark.\n\nSo who'll vote against an election? On Monday night, only 70 MPs felt strongly enough to actively oppose one rather than abstaining (sitting out the vote).\n\nThey included 38 Labour MPs, 5 from The Independent Group for Change, 4 Plaid Cymru and 4 Independents.\n\nThe others were Lib Dems who'll now change their tune, but not all of them. Heidi Allen said: \"As it stands, Parliament is not permitted to amend this bill today - that\u2019s an executive power grab by any measure and I won\u2019t support it.\"\n\nAnd several Tories voiced their disquiet...\n\nAre all Tories happy and in support?\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nNo.\n\nA string of Tories lashed out last night at the government for pushing ahead with an election - and canning Boris Johnson's Brexit deal until afterwards.\n\nAs it stands, the Withdrawal Agreement Bill has passed its first hurdle, is ready to be debated in Parliament, and the EU has given us plenty of time to pass it.\n\nBut it'll have to start from scratch with precious little time if Boris Johnson wins a December election. And if he loses it'll be canned completely.\n\nTory MP Simon Hoare fumed: \"What are we to say to constituents about the fact we may be able to find time for a five to six-week general election campaign and then the rigmarole of forming a Government - and yet not for bringing back the withdrawal Bill?\"\n\nTory MP Damian Green added: \"The sensible course of action - which, frankly, voters on all sides would expect of us - is to [debate and pass the Brexit deal Bill].\"\n\nTory Alex Chalk added: \"Surely the proportionate and sensible thing is to offer the House more time. If it does not vote for it, the Government will take their course, but surely they should at least try.\"\n\nWill there be amendments?\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThere can be but they'll be rushed and could be ruled out of scope for the Bill.\n\nSome will want to add radical changes like votes for EU citizens in the UK (currently barred from general elections) or votes for 16-year-olds.\n\nBut it's not clear this will pass because the Lib Dems - despite backing these reforms - suggested they'll abstain in the name of getting an election passed quickly.\n\nA Lib Dem source said: \"Let's be frank about the politics of this. If there are those kinds of amendments to this Bill, it doesn't go through.\"\n\nWhat does this mean for Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal?\n\n(Image: Inknown)\n\nThe deal is still active and agreed with the EU.\n\nBut the Bill that puts it into law (which passed an initial vote last week) will be parked until after an election, when it'd have to be brought back from scratch.\n\nIt'll be easy to bring back and pass if Boris Johnson wins a majority, and if he doesn't get a majority it's a different story. So the PM is gambling it all on winning the house.\n\nEx-Chancellor Philip Hammond - who was booted out of the Tories - raged at the decision to drop the Bill in favour of an election.\n\nHe said: \"The idea that now we would use our precious time to halt all of this process for five or six weeks and go out and have a general election frankly appals me.\n\n\"I think the Government is trying to create a narrative that Parliament is blocking Brexit and therefore we need an election. But that is simply untrue.\"", "description": "The first December general election since 1923 is now almost guaranteed to be triggered tonight as an ally declared \"we want to get Boris Johnson out by Christmas\"", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Image", "Pa", "Getty Images Europe", "Afp Getty Images", "Reuters", "Inknown"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20747827.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Brexit.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
