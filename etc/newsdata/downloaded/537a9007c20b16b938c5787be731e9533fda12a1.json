The tech giant\u2019s stock hit a record high during intra-day trading on Friday.\n\nSince Jan. 1 the stock has climbed almost 49%; shares were trading at $235.35 in afternoon trading Friday. It\u2019s a major rebound after hitting record highs around August of 2018. However, there\u2019s a reason to believe that investors might have overlooked a clue which would have boosted the stock.\n\n\u201cApple is interesting,\u201d says Alicia Levine, chief strategist at BNY Mellon. \u201cApple had its bear market last year, and if you look at the Street, most of the analysts do not have a buy on this stock, which traditionally is a setup for a stock moving higher. I think technically this stock looks really good.\u201d\n\nEssaye says the fact that Apple has been rallying could be a good sign for the U.S.-China trade talks.\n\n\u201cIf the market were nervous, then all of a sudden things would just fall apart like it did in July \u2013 clearly Apple would not be at new highs,\u201d Sevens Report Founder Tom Essaye said on Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cThe First Trade.\u201d Essaye went on to say, \u201cPeople were soured on the stock and they\u2019re doing a nice transition into more of a subscription-based business, moving a little bit away from hardware. It caught people by surprise but I think it generally is a positive anecdotal point on China trade that we get some sort of skinny deal out of it.\u201d\n\nWith progress being made in Washington during U.S. China trade talks, there may be more room for Apple\u2019s stock to climb even more.\n\nRead more:\n\nApple Watch Series 5 brings a completely reinvented screen\n\nApple's iPhone 11 is the best phone Apple has ever produced\n\nApple\u2019s move to make new Mac Pros in the US a smart one\n\nThese new Apple iPhones are already sold out in China on launch day\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "The underlying signs that may have signaled Apple's stock would climb.", "authors": ["Nick Monte"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/qpVrLWdLPdMccn2CcU6NhQ--~B/aD0zMzM1O3c9NTAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/bc44d570-ec4f-11e9-bf62-6bf2352ee96b", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
