Students were required to remain where they were once the president arrived on campus, and just a small select handful of honor students were permitted inside the forum. Everybody else had to remain in their dorm rooms or watch the forum remotely.\n\n\"I\u2019m not upset about [Trump] coming on campus, I\u2019m upset about not being able to come and attend the event,\" Luis de La Mora, a 19-year-old sophomore at Benedict, told ABC News, adding that he was disappointed that weren\u2019t more accommodations made for the students.\n\n\"Only the most exclusive kind of people are allowed to go in,\" de la Mora said. \"For me it feels a little exploitative to say this is such a progressive move, since this is the first time Trump would be visiting an HBCU, at least our little HBCU. It\u2019s supposed to be a shining moment when the world is paying attention to our little institution, but our students don\u2019t really get to do anything about it.\"\n\nIn a press conference on Friday, Benjamin told reporters he was concerned about the low amount of students who were able to attend the forum.\n\n\"I think every time you have the opportunity to expose more young people to public service, to politics, to new ideas, I think we need to avail ourselves to them,\" Benjamin said.\" I wish more had the opportunity to participate today.\"\n\nPHOTO: A supporter of President Donald Trump, right, clashes with an anti-Trump protester, left, outside the president's appearance at a criminal justice forum on Friday, Oct. 25, 2019, in Columbia, S.C.

Kamala Harris, D-Calif., announced that she would no longer be attending the forum. She withdrew late Friday citing a lack of access for students and voiced frustration that the Bipartisan Justice Center would celebrate the president, who has recently doubled down on his longtime comments calling for the execution of black teenagers known as the Central Park 5. Moreover, the award to Trump was the same award given to Harris in 2016.\n\nAs friction grew over Trump\u2019s honor, as well as his presence on campus, it was announced that the 20/20 Bipartisan Justice group would step aside from their sponsorship of the forum.\n\nIn a statement to ABC News Benjamin said that Benedict College had taken \"full operational control\" of the candidate forum.\n\n\"We\u2019ve been trying to work earnestly and in the long term interests of Benedict College,\" Benjamin said.\n\nThen -- amid the ongoing forum -- Harris, an HBCU graduate herself, announced that she would now be re-attending the event due to the fact that the sponsor was \"removed.\"\n\nAfter she agreed to rejoin, she thanked Benjamin in her speech for his leadership and his re-branding of the forum.\n\n\"Let\u2019s just deal with the elephant in the room which is the events of the last 24-48 hours,\" Harris said. \"Mayor Benjamin called me and told me that it was shifting and it was going to change ... that it was only right and a reflection of this most honorable institution that it would be opened to students, this event, that it would not be a paid event and that everyone would be able to participate,\" Harris said.\n\nBut the Bipartisan Justice group\u2019s representatives -- and their social media presence worldwide -- were still saying they were sponsoring the forum, which fueled confusion and speculation that 20/20 had not dropped out completely.", "description": "A planned series of events that took place at Benedict College in Columbia, South Carolina, this weekend has led to political fallout as the school co-hosted the Second Step Presidential Justice Forum and welcomed the 20/20 Bipartisan Justice Center as well as city Mayor Stephen Benjamin.
