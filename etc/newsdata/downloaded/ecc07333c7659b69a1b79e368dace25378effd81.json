Virtual TV bundles, like Sling TV or Hulu Live, offer live channel lineups like those found on cable and satellite services, but delivered over the internet, and usually for a fraction of the price.\n\n\"The more these streaming services like Disney Plus launch, the easier and easier it gets for you to want to reduce your spending on linear TV,\" Rich Greenfield of LightShed Partners, a telecom, media and technology research firm, told Business Insider. \"I think it could actually help the vMVPDs because they're the only cheaper solutions out there.\"\n\nHulu and YouTube's live-TV services are the ones to watch\n\nAnalysts at Credit Suisse forecasted in June that the pace of cord-cutting would reach new heights in 2019, but virtual pay-TV packages would continue to grow.\n\nDuring a tough 2019 for satellite TV's streaming offspring, including Dish Network's Sling TV and AT&T's AT&T TV Now (formerly DirecTV Now), Hulu and YouTube's live-TV platforms have been leading the way in subscriber growth.\n\nA June report by UBS forecasted that Hulu would dominate the streaming-TV market by 2022, followed by YouTube TV.\n\nRead more: Wall Street analysts forecast a major power shift in the streaming TV market, with Hulu and YouTube surging while others falter\n\nGreenfield thinks Hulu Live and YouTube TV are most likely to benefit from the cord-cutting that's spurred on by the boost in SVOD services. \"Those are the two to keep an eye on,\" he said.\n\nDisney, which has control of Hulu, also has the option to bundle Disney Plus with Hulu Live. It previously announced a bundle that includes ad-supported on-demand version of Hulu, Disney Plus, and ESPN Plus for $13 per month.\n\nNot all streaming-TV bundles will benefit equally\n\nViewers aren't expected to suddenly flock to the streaming-TV bundles that have been struggling this year, like AT&T TV Now and Sling TV.\n\nBut those packages could see a boost if they find ways to leverage the new SVOD platforms in their services, like bundling them with their live channels the way AT&T TV Now does with HBO, and Sling TV does with Showtime and other premium services.\n\nThe analysts at UBS forecasted in September that AT&T TV Now would continue bleeding subscribers into 2020, as it cut back on deep discounts in an attempt to become profitable. But it's not expected to lose as many as it did this year.\n\nRead more: AT&T is losing TV subscribers faster than its rivals, but cord-cutting is hitting the entire pay-TV industry hard\n\nSling TV, which posted meager growth this year, is expected to add fewer subscribers each year than the year before, through 2022, according to the Credit Suisse report.\n\nOther kinds of streaming services could also boost cord-cutting. Ad-supported offerings like The Roku Channel and free linear TV services like Viacom's Pluto TV have been gaining ground in 2019. None of those services are true replacements for a standard live-TV packages today.\n\n\"While the proliferation of SVOD platforms has been the focus, we also expect the growth of free linear TV services to add pressure to traditional TV viewership and increase cord cutting,\" John Hodulik, analyst at UBS, wrote in a September note to investors.\n\nRead more: Pluto TV's CEO explains how he grew its audience by 50% in 7 months with help from big new partners like the NFL and Comcast\n\nAs Greenfield pointed out, the cord-cutting upside for virtual-TV bundles depends to a degree on being able to keep prices low.\n\nHulu Live and YouTube TV both hiked prices earlier this year to keep up with rising programming costs, as did most of their competitors. Hulu Live now starts at $45 per month, and YouTube TV charges $50. The average cable or satellite bill in the US, meanwhile, tops $100.\n\nThose services, which are owned by companies that don't break out their financials, are taking losses because they charge so little. YouTube TV, backed by Alphabet, can afford it. Hulu, backed by Disney, might be able to too.\n\nEveryone else will have to decide how much they really want to be in the linear-TV game.\n\n\"Do we lose a couple of them over the next couple of years?\" Greenfield said. \"Do we see consolidation among subscribers in the space?\"", "description": "New SVOD services like Apple TV Plus and Disney Plus could toss the internet's pay-TV bundles a lifeline, according to some Wall Street analysts.", "authors": ["Ashley Rodriguez"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5c7f33382628983c836c69b3?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
