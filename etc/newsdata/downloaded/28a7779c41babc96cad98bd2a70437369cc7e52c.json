Ryan Anson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe New York Times in October initially reported on some of Blakely's allegations against Drummond. Her story and those of others at Google sparked huge employee protests last year over the company's treatment of sexual-misconduct allegations. It forced CEO Sundar Pichai to reveal that 48 people had been fired from Google over such allegations.\n\nThat Times story cast new light on Google's generally permissive culture around relationships, resulting in some lurid accounts of several male executives abusing their power.\n\nEric Schmidt, the former Google chairman, once kept a mistress as a company consultant, The Times said. The Android chief Andy Rubin reportedly received a $90 million payoff after he was accused of sexual misconduct. It was widely reported in 2014 that the Google cofounder Sergey Brin split from his wife and had an affair with a younger coworker. And Richard DeVaul, formerly a Google X director, offered a prospective employee a back rub during what she thought was a job interview, she told The Times. DeVaul subsequently resigned.\n\nThis begins to look like a pattern, not least because Google hasn't punished many of these high-profile men.\n\nSchmidt didn't resign from Alphabet's board until May of this year \u2014 and there was no suggestion it was related to any of the accusations against him. Google invested in Rubin's subsequent company, Playground Global, after he left the firm. Drummond is one of the most senior and highest-paid executives at Alphabet, earning even more than Pichai. Brin has become more elusive at internal events but has spoken at all-hands meetings this summer and remains on the firm's board.\n\nRead more: The Google exec at the center of explosive #MeToo allegations is one of the highest-paid at the firm, earning $47 million\n\nA Twitter account for the Google protesters commented on Blakely's story: \"This is a powerful first person account about the long term effects of #metoo and the systemic culture of treating people like objects at the highest levels of Google. This hurts all of us \u2014 of all genders and at all levels of the company.\"\n\nGoogle did respond to last year's protests by overhauling its policies on sexual misconduct, ending forced arbitration, increasing training for executives, and improving reporting tools.\n\nBut the latest shocking claims from Blakely, the trickling departure of the Google Walkout organizers, new workplace-discussion rules that could prevent similar protests from bubbling up in the future, and the fact that women remain severely outnumbered in the highest echelons of the company \u2014 only two of its 10 board members are women \u2014 suggest cultural change has a long way to go.\n\nContact this reporter at sghosh@businessinsider.com.", "description": "Google has had a permissive culture around relationships for years, which has benefited mostly male senior execs.", "authors": ["Shona Ghosh"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d4867ef100a24795a1b82d2?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-08-29"}
