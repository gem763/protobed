During the silence some obviously drunk idiot started singing the German national anthem. Very, very bad taste. Another guy shouts \"halt die Fresse\" (shut up). Audience laughs and applauds, Gnabry smiles. I did, too. #GERARG \u2014 Uwe (@uweplus) October 9, 2019\n\nIt led to the hastag #haltdiefresse (#shutup) to trend on social media, while German comedian Oliver Pocher even took to Twitter after the incident to \u201cthank\u201d Gnabry for his response - despite the clear potential for it to be interpreted as disrespectful to the Halle victims.\n\nDer WICHTIGSTE MOMENT dieses L\u00e4nderspiels!
