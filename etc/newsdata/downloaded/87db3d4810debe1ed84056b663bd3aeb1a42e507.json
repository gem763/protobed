Photo: Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nA few long years ago, Donald Trump overcame 16 other Republican candidates \u2014 and the unified opposition of the GOP Establishment \u2014 to win his party\u2019s nomination. He then overcame the most well-funded presidential candidate in history, and the unified opposition of respectable Beltway elites, to win a lease on the White House.\n\nThese events gave a lot of people a strong incentive to view the mogul as a political savant. After all, if Trump were merely who he appeared to be \u2014 a pathological narcissist acting on a combination of pure impulse and the banal insight that a lot of GOP primary voters dislike immigrants \u2014 what would that say about the competence of those who failed to stop him? Surely, for all his eccentricities and liabilities, the man was a savvier tactician than he let on. The president\u2019s Twitter tantrums may read like the ravings of an emotionally labile Fox News grandpa, but they were actually savvy bids to distract the media from his true malfeasance. And it may look like America\u2019s entire political class was so inept, and its republic so broken, that a senescent sociopath could win the presidency on the strength of partisan polarization, white racism, and the widespread misconception that The Apprentice was a documentary. But Trump was actually a (very unstable) genius playing 12-dimensional Yahtzee.\n\nThis theory is much less popular today than it was when Trump took office. For most observers, 33 months of watching the president score own goals has been sufficient to dispel the fiction that he knows exactly what he\u2019s doing. But if any grudging admirers of Trump\u2019s strategic prowess remain, the president\u2019s decision to abet a Turkish invasion of northeastern Syria this week should make them see the inconveniently stupid truth. Naming the single dumbest thing Trump has done as president, in terms of his own political interest, is an intimidating task given the cornucopia of contenders for that title. But his decision to abandon America\u2019s Kurdish allies in Syria this week has to be pretty high up on the list.\n\nTo review: Trump entered Sunday enmeshed in a fight over impeachment. To prevent the House\u2019s investigation of his blatantly corrupt dealings with Ukraine from threatening his presidency, the White House aimed to portray the inquiry as a partisan witch hunt. The overriding goal was to maintain low-information swing voters\u2019 aversion to impeachment. To do that, the GOP needed to send a clear message \u2014 only far-left Democrats believe Donald Trump has been dangerously misusing the powers of his office or undermining our national security. As long as Republicans maintained a unified front, independents would view the whole inquiry as a partisan food fight and blame the instigators. Meanwhile, the RNC could mine a fundraising bonus from the GOP base\u2019s freshly inflamed siege mentality. With a little message discipline, they could turn this whole episode into a net positive.\n\nThen Trump hopped on the phone with Recep Tayyip Erdogan. And without consulting the Pentagon, the State Department, or leaders of his own party, the president gave his Turkish counterpart permission to wage war on America\u2019s Kurdish allies in northeastern Syria.\n\nThere are very few things Trump could do to provoke loud criticism from his allies in Congress or on the Christian right. In abandoning the Kurds to their fate, he chose to do one of them. Before Trump took Erdogan\u2019s call, Lindsey Graham was incessantly broadcasting the (insane) message that congressional Democrats were destroying the Constitution by conducting oversight of the executive branch. Since bombs started falling on Kurdish border towns, Graham has been broadcasting the message that Trump is exercising executive authority in a way that brings shame on America and jeopardizes its national security.\n\nPray for our Kurdish allies who have been shamelessly abandoned by the Trump Administration. This move ensures the reemergence of ISIS. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 9, 2019\n\nAnd many of Trump\u2019s other Republican allies have echoed Graham\u2019s sentiments, thereby sending the meta-message that this president is misusing power in a manner so severe even staunch conservatives can\u2019t help but speak out.\n\nThe Evangelical right has forgiven Trump for a wide variety of deadly sins, but the movement is deeply invested in the fate of Syria\u2019s Christian minority, which could fare worse under the rule of Turkey\u2019s Islamist government than it currently does under the Kurds\u2019 secular leadership. On Monday, televangelist Pat Robertson sorrowfully informed his faithful that if Trump allowed the Turkish invasion to proceed, he would be \u201cin danger of losing the mandate of heaven.\u201d As of this writing, it is unclear whether God is now an undecided voter. But Trump does appear to be at risk of losing the mandate of Franklin Graham.\n\nMeanwhile, the upside for Trump here is difficult to discern. Sure, a large swath of the American public is sick of forever wars. But the president isn\u2019t actually bringing our troops home from Syria; he\u2019s merely relocating 50 U.S. service members. Trump may believe this symbolic gesture is sufficient to convey the impression that he is fulfilling a campaign promise to draw down America\u2019s military commitments, but if he thinks this half-hearted gesture towards paleoconservatism is more politically beneficial than interviews like this are damaging, he is almost certainly mistaken.\n\nI just spoke to a distraught US Special Forces soldier who is among the 1000 or so US troops in Syria tonight who is serving alongside the SDF Kurdish forces. It was one of the hardest phone calls I have ever taken.\n\n\n\n\"I am ashamed for the first time in my career.\" \u2014 Jennifer Griffin (@JenGriffinFNC) October 9, 2019\n\nThe danger for Trump here is not that his betrayal of the Kurds will persuade a critical mass of GOP senators to vote for his removal from office. Lindsey Graham is still interspersing his prayers for the Kurds with demagogic defenses of Trump\u2019s corruption, and there are still nowhere near enough votes in the upper chamber to evict Trump from the White House. But the impeachment push doesn\u2019t need to succeed to damage the president\u2019s reelection hopes. And against all odds, Trump has managed to manufacture one of the few circumstances in which devout Republicans will loudly endorse the broad premise of Nancy Pelosi\u2019s inquiry: that Trump is using presidential power in ways that shock the conscience of patriotic Americans, no matter their partisan allegiance.\n\nWhich seems ill advised given that public opinion was already moving in favor of impeachment before this week\u2019s events got underway.\n\nBy itself, all this would be more than adequate proof that our president is a lucky idiot who is bad at politics. But Trump\u2019s new Syria policy has an additional dimension of stupidity. It jeopardizes one of his few (putative) nonpartisan accomplishments as president.\n\nTrump may or may not deserve credit for the decline of ISIS over the past three years, but the fact that he presided over that decline was sufficient for him to declare himself a great slayer of terrorists without mainstream fact-checkers complaining. In clearing the way for a war between Turkey and the Kurds, Trump may well have forfeited that right. Kurdish forces have been guarding 1,200 ISIS prisoners. The burgeoning conflict threatens to divert forces from that prison camp and provide the ISIS fighters with a prime opportunity for a jailbreak.\n\nRemarkably, Trump does not deny this. The president\u2019s official position is that his decision to withdraw 50 U.S. service members from one region of Syria does, in fact, come with a significant risk of reviving ISIS, but this is an acceptable risk because he made sure to relocate two of the 1,200 terrorists in advance \u2014 and the rest will probably just descend on Europe anyway.\n\nIn case the Kurds or Turkey lose control, the United States has already taken the 2 ISIS militants tied to beheadings in Syria, known as the Beetles, out of that country and into a secure location controlled by the U.S. They are the worst of the worst! \u2014 Donald J.
