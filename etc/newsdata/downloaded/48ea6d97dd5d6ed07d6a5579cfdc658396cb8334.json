Mikko Koskinen made 49 saves for Edmonton (6-1-0) in his third win of the season.\n\nRyan Nugent-Hopkins, Ethan Bear and former Flyer Brandon Manning each scored their first goal of 2019-20.\n\nJakub Voracek scored twice for Philadelphia (2-2-1) and assisted on Oskar Lindblom\u2019s goal.\n\nIt was a tough night for Flyers goalie Carter Hart, who allowed four goals on 14 shots. He was pulled in the second period after Nugent-Hopkins\u2019 power-play goal and replaced by Brian Elliott.\n\nThe loss extended Philadelphia\u2019s skid to three games and marked the end of a road trip that included three games in five days.\n\nEdmonton got off to a quick start as Draisaitl scored his fifth of the season 1:13 in, beating Hart with a hard snap shot over the blocker.\n\nThe Flyers tied it with the man advantage when Voracek buried the puck off a big rebound from Claude Giroux\u2019s shot. But the Oilers responded just more than seven minutes later as Bear jumped into the rush and took a feed from James Neal, beating Hart with a wrist shot to give Edmonton a 2-1 lead.\n\nThe Flyers pressed hard for an equalizer in the second period, but Koskinen came up with a plethora of big saves. His two biggest stops came on Sean Couturier\u2019s one-timer from the slot and a stick save against a wide-open Shayne Gostisbehere in front.\n\nThe goalie\u2019s strong play sparked the Oilers in the second. After being dominated during the first half of the period, Edmonton broke loose with three goals in less than four minutes to take complete control.\n\nMcDavid outmuscled Flyers defenseman Justin Braun to make it 3-1 at the 12:34 mark, then Nugent-Hopkins and Draisaitl scored power-play goals 1:54 apart to give Edmonton a 5-1 cushion late in the period.\n\nMcDavid added his fifth point of the game in the third with a nice drop pass to Manning, who fired a one-timer past Elliott.\n\nLindblom tipped in a drive from Voracek for his third goal of the season with 4:40 remaining. Voracek added his second power-play goal of the game with 2:18 to go.\n\nEdmonton\u2019s special teams have been a big key to its strong start. The Oilers were 2 for 2 with the man advantage and are 10 for 22 in seven games.\n\nNOTES: The Oilers paid tribute to former coach Ted Green, who died last week at 79. \u2026 McDavid\u2019s previous five-point games came against Toronto in February 2016 and Tampa Bay in February 2018. \u2026 Manning dressed for the first time this season after being a healthy scratch for the first six games. \u2026 Oscar Klefbom\u2019s assist on McDavid\u2019s second-period goal was the 100th of his NHL career.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nFlyers: Host the Dallas Stars on Saturday night.\n\nOilers: Host the Detroit Red Wings on Friday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Connor McDavid had a goal and four assists, Leon Draisaitl added two goals and one assist, and the Edmonton Oilers' dynamic duo continued their sizzling start to the season Wednesday night in a 6-3 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/17/aptopix_flyers_oilers_hockey_79569_c0-230-5032-3165_s1200x700.jpg?3ebf14190a8bb5976cd07ed871b92df1a2047108", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
