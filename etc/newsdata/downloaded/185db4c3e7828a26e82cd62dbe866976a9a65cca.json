There\u2019s nothing good about them,\u2019\u201d Max said.\n\n\u201cThey just sit around doing nothing all day,\u201d he added.\n\nAt that point Matthew decided he had had enough and decided to pull Max out of the school.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve gotta teach kids to be happy and positive and it\u2019s all well and good to be concerned about the environment and wanting to teach kids good practices and basically not be grubs and throw litter around and this sort of thing, but you don\u2019t have to be a greenie to do that,\u201d he said.\n\nSwedish Populist Leader: Climate Kid Greta Thunberg a Product of PR Agency https://t.co/CliUmeY0yd \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 27, 2019\n\nIn response, a spokesperson for the New South Wales Department of Education issued a statement saying \u201cstudying controversial issues is acceptable for educational purposes.\u201d\n\nLast month, psychologists in Great Britain warned that a growing number of children are being treated for an overwhelming terror of environmental doom, a condition being referred to as \u201ceco-anxiety.\u201d\n\n\u201cProtests by groups such as Extinction Rebellion, the recent fires in the Amazon and apocalyptic warnings by the teenage activist Greta Thunberg have prompted a \u2018tsunami\u2019 of young people seeking help,\u201d the Telegraph newspaper reported.\n\n\u201cA lot of parents are coming into therapy asking for help with the children and it has escalated a lot this summer,\u201d said psychotherapist Caroline Hickman of the Climate Psychology Alliance (CPA).\n\n\u201cThe symptoms are the same [as clinical anxiety], the feelings are the same, but the cause is different,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fear is of environmental doom \u2014 that we\u2019re all going to die.\u201d\n\nThe Climate Psychology Alliance said psychiatric drugs have been administered to some children complaining of fear of environmental collapse and the group is now pushing for official recognition of eco-anxiety as a psychological condition.\n\nClimate Wunderkind Greta Slammed for Wearing Far-Left Extremist Antifa Shirt https://t.co/rOTNhr2PaR \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) July 31, 2019\n\nAs activists attempt to enlist more young people as eco-warriors, it is no surprise that children are suffering psychologically as a result, since they do not possess the critical thinking skills necessary to separate the facts from the hype. When they hear that the world is ending or that human civilization has only ten years to exist, their natural inclination is to believe it.\n\nMs Hickman said that parents should learn to use gentler language in talking to their children about global warming.\n\n\u201cWhat you don\u2019t want is that child to collapse in a well of depression saying \u2018what\u2019s the point in going to university,\u2019 or \u2018what\u2019s the point of doing my exams,\u2019 which I have heard children say,\u201d Hickman said.\n\nBrexit Party MEP Parodies Greta at London Rally, Tells Anti-Brexit MPs \u2018You Have Stolen My Dreams!\u2019 https://t.co/icVxAqBivW \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 30, 2019\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "An Australian man has pulled his son out of a local school for for teaching alarmist climate change theory as a scientific fact.", "authors": ["Thomas D.
