Unlike every other well-established party in New York, the candidates it supports run on just one ballot line.\n\nBut, ironically, the party's official status makes it easier for candidates it doesn\u2019t back to occasionally steal the line. Enrolled members can force a primary by collecting the signatures of only 5 percent of the party\u2019s members in a district. And since enrollment in the Greens is still relatively low, a major party contender can often do that by collecting just a handful of signatures.\n\nThat means a candidate could theoretically have a few friends switch enrollment to the Green Party and have enough support to win that line. Something like that seems to have happened in Troy in June\u2019s primaries \u2014 Democrat Rodney Wiltshire outpolled C.J. Chapman, an actual Green Party member, 30-to-19 and won the line. Republican Carmella Mantello won the party\u2019s nomination for City Council president.\n\nIn 2016, Republican state Sen. George Amedore (R-Rotterdam) defeated Democrat Sara Niccoli in the party\u2019s primary after Green enrollment in Hunter suddenly surged, and the town's members backed Amedore 39-to-0.\n\n\u201cJust here in the Capital District alone, we\u2019ve had dozens of [opportunities to ballot] where Democrats and Republicans have tried to steal our lines over the past few years,\u201d LaVenia said. \u201cIt seems to us after we door-knocked a considerable amount in Troy that the Republican Party in Troy has re-registered people in the Green Party for the sole purpose of winning the line.\u201d\n\nAnd the maneuvers like that, he thinks, can create confusion and hinder the growth of independent third parties.\n\n\u201cWe think that it\u2019s more democratic to run on one line,\u201d LaVenia said. \u201cThese other parties besides the Greens are not, to us, really parties. They\u2019re kind of cross-endorsement machines for the Democrats and Republicans.\u201d", "description": "Ironically, the party's official status makes it easier for candidates it doesn\u2019t back to occasionally steal the line.", "authors": ["Bill Mahoney"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/de/8b/071a35804d4dac3247f4da49ff68/ive-voted-stickers.png", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
