University applications are coming up and predicted grades are being finalised. In terms of subjects, I'm most worried about my three IB higher-level subjects, especially maths.\n\n\n\nJoy Pamnani, 15, Po Leung Kuk Ngan Po Ling College\n\nTo be honest, I'm not looking forward to the new school year at all! I'm starting Form Four and the pressure is already on - I'll have more homework, tougher examinations and extra tutorial lessons.\n\n\n\nAlex Chan Yiu-fai, 17, University College London\n\nAs a student heading to university, I'm most worried about finding the correct balance between my social life and studies. Everything's back to square one, meaning I'll need to re-establish social links in the new environment. I'll also have to get used to working hard and coping with the academic expectations. Balancing everything will be challenging.\n\n\n\nMinal Daswani, 17, Island School\n\nI'm worried about not being able to lift my predicted grades and get into the university I want to. I'm also worried about not being able to manage the workload in the new school year.\n\n\n\nCoco Ma Hiu-lam, 16, St Paul's Co-educational College\n\nThis will be my first year of the IB exams and I am going to need to prepare a lot and be ready for the different challenges ahead. I've heard from my friends that IB is really difficult and complicated, and that I won't have enough time to rest. So I'm worried about my time management. I tend to put off doing things, so I'm scared I won't be able to meet my deadlines.\n\nTell us what your worries are in the comment box below\n\nIn the next Talking Points, we'll be discussing what is wrong with liberal studies.\n\nOther conversations:\n\n- What do you think about e-learning?\n\n- How can we eliminate the problem of caged homes and subdivided flats in Hong Kong?\n\n- \"If I were gay/lesbian, I would like to tell the world ...\"\n\n- Things I wish to know in life that I never learn about in school\n\n- What I wish I could tell my parents\n\n- The school rule I would change if I were the principal\n\n- How should schools start their Monday morning assembly?\n\n- What's wrong with Liberal Studies?", "description": "Hate it when you can't talk back?
