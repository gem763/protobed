I hope they catch Aids and die.'\n\nChin up: Alexa failed to raise a smile as her famous friends had fun, with both Poppy and Sara cracking radiant smiles around her\n\nFamily affair: Noel and Sara have been married since 2011 and have two sons together, Donovan, 11, and Sonny, eight\n\nLast month, Noel branded his younger fan base 'f***ing idiots' for demanding to hear Oasis songs during his live shows with current band High Flying Birds.\n\nThe 52-year old has released three albums and numerous singles under the High Flying Birds moniker since abruptly disbanding the iconic Brit Pop band he led with younger brother Liam in 2009.\n\nAnd he admits he\u2019s frustrated with repeated demands for Oasis classics from fans who were too young to remember the group during their 90s heyday, and have only connected with them through a recent feature length documentary about their meteoric rise.\n\n'When I play those songs it is an incredible thing since the documentary Supersonic came out,' he explained during a recent interview with SiriusXM in the United States.\n\nLove: Noel and Sara first met at a club in Ibiza in 2000, before he and his first wife Meg Matthews divorced in 2001\n\nLoving family: The couple live in Hampshire with their two children, with Noel spending much of his time with his highly successful band High Flying Birds\n\n'It has reinvigorated a whole new fan base. Sadly they all do turn up to the gigs dressed as Liam with four pairs of sunglasses on, rolling around going \"I\u2019m mad for it.\"\n\n'The new stuff that I am doing, they f****ing hate it. Which makes me want to do it more.'\n\nHe added: 'You little f***ing idiot, you are only 15. What the f***! You were only ten when the band broke up. F*** off.'\n\nGallagher walked away from Oasis following a hugely successful 15-year career with the band, during which they released seven albums and cemented themselves as one of the most influential bands of their generation.\n\nBut the musician's fractious relationship with lead singer Liam, also a successful solo artist in his own right, forced the band's sudden split - resulting in the cancellation of two festival appearances.\n\nPosting a statement at the time, he wrote: 'It is with some sadness and great relief... I quit Oasis tonight.\n\n'People will write and say what they like, but I simply could not go on working with Liam a day longer.'\n\nThe singer has since been embroiled in a war of words with his brother, whose opinions of Noel and Sara are frequently aired across social media.\n\nFuel was added to the siblings' decade-long feud last month when Noel slammed his brother's upcoming documentary, telling Variety: 'Every time I see that c***'s face. I want to take out a McDonald's with a machine gun.", "description": "They met almost 20 years ago in a nightclub in Ibiza.", "authors": ["Harry Howard For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/08/20119340-0-image-a-10_1571903736442.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
