He\u2019s been making flashy franchise blockbusters (save for 2015\u2019s The Man From U.N.C.L.E., which deserves justice) like Sherlock Holmes and King Arthur, but now he\u2019s going back to the gritty crime-comedy genre that made him with The Gentlemen. Matthew McConaughey stars as Mickey Pearson, an American expat in London who is running a very successful weed-selling operation. When other rogues in the city learn that Mickey is trying to cash out, a skirmish to usurp his territory breaks out. That means hostile encounters with a gangster (Henry Golding), and expository narration from a shady-looking Hugh Grant. And because this is a Guy Ritchie production, there are also a hundred other ensemble characters, including Charlie Hunnam, Michelle Dockery, Jeremy Strong, Eddie Marsan, Colin Farrell, and more. The Gentlemen arrives in theaters \u201csoon.\u201d\n\nRelated", "description": "Matthew McConaughey, Hugh Grant, Charlie Hunnam, Henry Golding, many more fast-talking British men, and Michelle Dockery star in Guy Ritchie\u2019s new crime comedy, The Gentlemen.", "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/02/02-the-gentlemen.w1200.h630.jpg"}
