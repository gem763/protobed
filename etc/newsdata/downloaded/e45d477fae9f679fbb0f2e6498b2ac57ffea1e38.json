Mandatory Credit: Stan Szeto-USA TODAY Sports\n\n(Reuters) - American Josef Newgarden clinched the 2019 IndyCar Series title by finishing eighth in the final race of the season in Monterey, California on Sunday.\n\nNeeding to place fourth or better in the Grand Prix of Monterey at the Laguna Seca road course to be certain of the championship, Newgarden did not manage that but the pieces of the puzzle fell into place for the 28-year-old from Tennessee.\n\nThe Team Penske driver, who won four races this year, also won the 2017 championship. He won four races that season too.\n\nNewgarden, fellow American Alexander Rossi, Frenchman Simon Pagenaud and New Zealander Scott Dixon all went into Sunday\u2019s race with a chance of capturing the season-long points race.\n\nAmerican teenager Colton Herta won the race from Australian Will Power, while Dixon placed third, Pagenaud fourth and Rossi sixth.\n\n\u201cI tried to be as smart as I could today,\u201d an emotional Newgarden said after climbing out of the cockpit and hugging his pit crew, as well as his mother and his fiancee.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to throw it away at the end, do something silly. I\u2019m so happy, I was crying the whole (last) lap. I\u2019m glad it\u2019s over.\n\n\u201cI was so nervous to mess this up today. I haven\u2019t slept the last two weeks. I feel I\u2019m going to be able to sleep tonight.\u201d", "description": "American Josef Newgarden clinched the 2019 IndyCar Series title by finishing eighth in the final race of the season in Monterey, California on Sunday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190922&t=2&i=1432765997&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8L0WR-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
