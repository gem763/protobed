It has, for example, reinforced security on its southern border and set up checkpoints on highways leading north, dispatching 21,600 police and troops across the nation in the effort.\n\nSo far in 2019, the US Border Patrol has arrested more than 400,000 migrants from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras for crossing the border illegally. But only 4,300 Mexicans were caught doing so.\n\nIt\u2019s all strong evidence that, far from ignoring or rejecting Trump\u2019s efforts to jawbone them into doing something to stop the flood of illegals, America\u2019s most important southern neighbor is listening to him. Recall that Mexico stepped up actions to control the migrants in a bid to avoid tariffs Trump had threatened to impose.", "description": "", "authors": ["Jonathan Tobin", "Nypost.Com Trumps-Starting-To-Win-Big-On-Controlling-The-Southern-Border"], "top_image": ""}
