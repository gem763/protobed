Al Green, D-Texas, one of the first lawmakers who called for President Trump's impeachment, expressed his fears on Saturday that if Democrats don't pursue his ousting, Trump \"will get reelected.\" Green was asked on MSNBC about how unpopular impeachment was among voters. MSNBC correspondent Phillip Mena pressed him with recent polling numbers from Quinnipiac showing 66 percent of voters were against impeachment -- including 38 percent of Democrats and 70 percent of independents. \"Are you concerned that impeachment talk may actually help the president's reelection?\" Mena asked. \"I'm concerned that if we don't impeach the president, he will get reelected,\" Green responded. \"If we don't impeach him, he will say that he has been vindicated, he will say the Democrats had an overwhelming majority in the House and they didn't take up impeachment. he will say that we had a constitutional duty to do it if it was there and we didn't. He will say that he has been vindicated.\"", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/vCBAeXa1EBaheBM5R3F2qA--~B/aD02OTI2O3c9OTAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/marie_claire_447/eb0899d0ca49cf08c9982ae85eba4cbb", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
