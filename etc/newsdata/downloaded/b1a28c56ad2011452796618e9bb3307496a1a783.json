The demonstrations appeared to be set off by videos circulating online alleging government corruption. Protests also took place in Alexandria, Suez, Damietta.\n\nThough small compared with those during the Arab Spring, the protests were significant because they defied a vast government effort overseen by Mr. Sisi to stamp out political dissent since he took power after a military coup in 2013.\n\nUnauthorized street protests are now illegal in Egypt. Security forces killed more than 1,000 people and arrested tens of thousands of others in the aftermath of the 2013 coup, meaning that any demonstrations come with high personal risk for those demonstrating.\n\nThe protesters in Cairo chanted \u201cLeave!\u201d and \u201cThe people demand the fall of the regime!\u201d Police fired tear gas to disperse one group of protesters.\n\nAt least 56 people were arrested, according to the Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights, a human-rights group that released a list of names of those detained.\n\nThe unrest followed new allegations of corruption against Mr. Sisi that have created a storm of online criticism of his government.\n\nA man who identified himself as a former government contractor called for the protests, accusing Mr. Sisi of graft in a series of online videos posted from self-imposed exile in Spain to his Facebook page. Mohamed Ali, who also works as an actor, accused Mr. Sisi of building lavish palaces for himself and wasting public funds on projects like a luxury hotel near Cairo.\n\nProtesters shout slogans during a rare anti-government protest in Cairo in the early hours of Saturday.

The claims in the videos and Mr. Ali\u2019s identity couldn\u2019t be independently verified.\n\nMr. Sisi denied wrongdoing and dismissed Mr. Ali\u2019s accusations as untrue in a speech at a hastily-organized conference last week. \u201cI swear to God, these are lies and slander,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the videos generated a renewed debate around allegations of corruption in Egypt\u2019s military-dominated economy, which includes billions spent on megaprojects like a new administrative capital under construction in the desert outside Cairo. According to Twitter, more than a million tweets appeared on the site this week calling for the removal of Mr. Sisi and supporting the call for protests.\n\n\u201cWe have wealth that could feed 100 million Egyptians and more but your president does not know how to manage it,\u201d said Mr. Ali in one video. Mr. Ali couldn\u2019t be reached immediately for comment.\n\nEarlier this year, a majority of Egyptian voters approved constitutional changes that would allow President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi to remain in power until 2030, following a referendum in which people campaigning against the changes were arrested.\n\nThe opposition has said the outcome of the vote was undermined by the government\u2019s use of state institutions to ensure passage of the changes. Voters said they were offered cash and food to participate in the referendum.\n\nIn one video, Mr. Ali urged Egyptians to take to the streets and called on Egypt\u2019s defense minister Mohamed Zaki to arrest Mr. Sisi.\n\nHundreds heeded Mr. Ali\u2019s call, descending to the streets of major cities following a nationally televised soccer match.\n\nEgyptian officials made no public statements in response to the protests. Earlier on Friday, Mr. Sisi flew to New York where he is set to attend the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly.\n\nThe Egyptian protests emerged as new democratic movements gather strength across North Africa after demonstrations forced out the longtime autocratic leaders of Sudan and Algeria earlier this year.\n\nLiving standards have dropped for most Egyptians in recent years as Mr. Sisi\u2019s government devalued Egypt\u2019s currency and raised the price of basic goods and services like fuel, electricity, and subway tickets.\n\nThe changes are part of austerity called for under a $12 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund agreed upon in 2016. The economy is growing at a rate of 5.4% but poverty is also on the rise, with 32.5% of Egyptians now living in what the government describes as extreme poverty, up from 27.8% in 2015.\n\nMr. Sisi\u2019s government has also expanded the role of the military and other security services in the economy, putting pressure on the private sector and generating resentment from ordinary Egyptians who see themselves as left out of any growth in the economy.\n\nWrite to Jared Malsin at jared.malsin@wsj.com", "description": "Egyptian authorities made dozens of arrests after hundreds of people took to the streets of Cairo and other cities overnight in the first significant antigovernment protests in years.", "authors": ["Jared Malsin", "Amira El-Fekki", "Jared.Malsin Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109586/social", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
