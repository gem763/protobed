We are leaving on 31 October, no ifs or buts.\u201d\n\nThe so-called rebel alliance will aim to take control of the Commons order paper from 3pm on Wednesday, to pass a Bill just 2 pages long, with 5 clauses, and 1 schedule.\n\nIf it can clear all its Commons stages on Wednesday, it will leave Thursday \u2013 and possibly Friday and through the weekend \u2013 for a rockier path through the Lords.\n\nThe aim is for the bill to have gained royal assent by Sunday night to be assured the law is in place before Mr Johnson prorogues parliament as early as Monday.\n\nMr Johnson can also avoid the Bill\u2019s requirements in the highly-unlikely event that MPs vote for a crash-out Brexit in October.", "description": "Boris Johnson would be forced to delay Brexit if he has failed to strike a fresh deal by 19 October, under a rebel Bill aimed at blocking a crash-out from the EU.
