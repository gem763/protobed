It also drew attention because of the actions of another student, 21-year-old Riley Howell, who tackled Terrell, enabling authorities who arrived on the scene to disarm him, according to police.\n\nHowell, 21, who was mortally wounded and died in the incident, is credited with saving many others in the UNC Charlotte classroom that held about 50 students.\n\nDefence attorney Michael Kabakoff, who represented Terrell, told the court that his client suffered from developmental disabilities and other ailments.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not the worst of the worst,\u201d he said, arguing for his client\u2019s life, the Observer reported.\n\nTerrell told the court, \u201cIf I could go back in time, I would back out of it,\u201d news media reported. \u201cI am so sorry. I made a mistake.\u201d\n\nTerrell was sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole by Mecklenburg Superior Court Judge Robert Bell, media reported.\n\nNeither the district attorney nor Terrell\u2019s lawyer were immediately available to Reuters early Friday.", "description": "A gunman who killed two university students and wounded four in a mass shooting in North Carolina in April pleaded guilty to murder in a Charlotte court on Thursday, in a deal sparing him the death penalty, the Charlotte Observer and ABC News reported.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
