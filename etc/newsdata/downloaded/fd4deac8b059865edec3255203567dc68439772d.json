Nike stores in China actually removed their Houston Rockets merchandise from their shelves to join the Chinese government in protest against the Rockets general manager\u2019s seven-word tweet, which read: \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nAnd some of the NBA\u2019s biggest players and owners, who routinely exercise their freedom to criticize this country, lose their voices when it comes to the freedom and rights of the people of China. In siding with the Chinese Communist Party and silencing free speech, the NBA is acting like a wholly owned subsidiary of the authoritarian regime.\n\nA progressive corporate culture that willfully ignores the abuse of human rights is not progressive; it is repressive.", "description": "Vice President Pence on Thursday criticized some NBA players and some corporate sponsors for not speaking out against abuses committed by the Chinese government.", "authors": ["Eugene Scott", "Reporter Covering Identity Politics For The Fix"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/HQmzM2gf7HbEC288WTx_NiUa-6E=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HNIYBHXWQYI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
