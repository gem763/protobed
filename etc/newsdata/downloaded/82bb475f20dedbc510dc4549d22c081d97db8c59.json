So why does Boris Johnson think he can succeed a third time?\n\nCertainly he\u2019ll have to do much better than Theresa May who was forced out of the job as PM after failing three times to get her Brexit deal approved by MPs.\n\nSignificantly, Mrs May\u2019s failure was also triggered by her decision to call a General Election three years before one was due. It saw her Commons majority wiped out.\n\nHe\u2019s already lost two Commons votes in his attempt to force an early election to \u2018get Brexit done\u2019. So why does Boris Johnson think he can succeed a third time?\n\nThe brutal truth is that Mrs May\u2019s setback in 2017 is the principal reason why we are in this mess.\n\nOf course, snap elections are not always a mistake. But in recent history, prime ministers have been very wary about going to the polls.\n\nThe most egregious example is Gordon Brown, who critics said \u2018bottled out\u2019 of going to the country in 2007 when he was streets ahead of David Cameron\u2019s Tories and could have extended his Commons majority.\n\nBut he dithered. His reputation never recovered and he was beaten by Cameron three years later.\n\nJohnson has a simple choice. Remain a prime minister shackled by a working Commons majority of minus 45 and be impotent \u2013 unable to get Brexit done. Or call a General Election in the hope that voters will punish the Brexit-blockers and give his Tories a working majority.\n\nWith typical Boris braggadocio, he is confident he can soar to victory where Mrs May flopped.\n\nMoreover, he is convinced Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s feeble fence-sitting on Brexit and his dismal failure to tackle repellent anti-Semitism in the Labour Party has shattered the folk-hero status that saw \u2018Oh, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019 run Mrs May close in 2017.\n\nJohnson\u2019s decision to try to force an election is a triumph for the gambling instincts of his chief adviser Dominic Cummings over more cautious Cabinet voices.\n\nAll this said, the PM is constrained by the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act.\n\nUntil 2010, when the Act was cobbled together by the Cameron-led government to keep the Lib Dems in coalition, prime ministers always had the freedom to call an election pretty much whenever it suited them.\n\nBut now, elections are fixed every five years \u2013 the next is due on May 5, 2022 \u2013 unless two thirds of MPs vote for an earlier date. Johnson has tried and failed twice to achieve this. Without a Commons majority, he has been stymied for one reason alone \u2013 Labour\u2019s refusal to agree to one, because they are so far behind in the opinion polls and terrified of losing.\n\nThat said, Labour is split over the issue. Some Corbyn allies such as Richard Burgon have voiced support for an early election. But most Labour MPs are against the idea, fearing it would be political suicide.\n\nMeanwhile, a force that cannot be ignored are the Scottish Nationalists. They have been champing at the bit for an election in the hope of increasing their numbers in Westminster and reinforcing their demands for a second independence referendum north of the border.\n\nBut yesterday, the SNP appeared to rebuff Johnson\u2019s early election gambit. That could cost them dear.\n\nJohnson is convinced Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s feeble fence-sitting on Brexit and his dismal failure to tackle repellent anti-Semitism in the Labour Party has shattered the folk-hero status that saw \u2018Oh, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019 run Mrs May close in 2017\n\nFor their part, Jo Swinson\u2019s Lib Dems also poured cold water on Johnson\u2019s plan. The Opposition parties seem to have made the cynical calculation that ending the nation\u2019s Brexit agony is less important than keeping Johnson dangling from the political equivalent of a zipwire.\n\nAnd, as ever, there is the Nigel Farage factor. His Brexit Party\u2019s best hope of winning seats is to be able to say the Tories have betrayed voters by failing to honour their pledge to the 17.4 million Leave voters.\n\nThese are very, very high stakes.\n\nThere is no denying that a December election could lead to Boris Johnson being turfed out of No 10.\n\nBut ploughing on in the hope of getting a Brexit deal through Parliament is just as perilous. It would mean an election could not take place until January at the earliest, and by then, despite his characteristic sunny disposition, Boris Johnson could be in danger of running out of steam.\n\nHis high ratings suggest that voters do not blame him for failing to meet his October 31 Brexit deadline. But their patience will run out eventually.", "description": "He's already lost two Commons votes in his attempt to force an early election to 'get Brexit done'.
