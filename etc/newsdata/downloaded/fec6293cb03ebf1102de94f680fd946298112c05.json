An estimated 500 horses a month are processed at the facility.\n\nThe distressing footage has caused a political shockwave, with at least one federal senator calling for the national government to intervene in the industry, which is usually managed by state authorities.\n\nMeanwhile, Lee Freedman, one of Australia's most decorated horse trainers over the past 30 years, said he was \u201cbroken hearted\u201d at the report, and suggested the future of the sport itself was at risk.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t make real changes the court of public opinion will bury racing,\" he said.\n\nThe Australian horse racing industry is worth one billion dollars. ABC investigative reporter Caro Meldrum-Hanna said about 300 racehorses went through the Queensland abattoir in just 22 days. The horses had won combined prize money of almost $5 million before their owners decided they\u2019d outlived their usefulness.", "description": "A hidden camera investigation has exposed horrific abuse of racehorses at an Australian abattoir, sparking calls for government intervention and a possible ban on horse racing.", "authors": ["Giovanni Torre", "Joe Burgis", "Christian Calgie", "Eilis O'Hanlon"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/18/TELEMMGLPICT000213375622-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqVO8OdLnLtEoUkP93e8x7iSrw-km9v5JW3Y89ZAx--DM.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
