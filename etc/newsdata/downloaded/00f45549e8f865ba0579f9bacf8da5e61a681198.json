Jane actress, 56, talks about her troubled childhood with two alcoholic parents and claimed that her mother allowed her to be raped at 15 \u2014 even profiting from it.\n\nSawyer recounted how Moore\u2019s mother brought her to bars as a young teen \u201cso that men will notice them.\u201d One night, when Moore was 15, she came home and an older man they knew was waiting for her in their apartment and raped her.\n\nIt was after the sexual assault that Moore learned that her mother had given her rapist the key to their home. That was with the man said to Moore, \u201cHow does it feel to be whored by your mother for $500?\u201d\n\nMoore, who called it \u201ca devastating betrayal\u201d in the book, still has a hard time accepting it. Asked by Sawyer if she believes her mother \u201csold her,\u201d the star searched for the right words.\n\n\u201cI think...\u201d she started to say and then trailed off. \u201cIn my deep heart, no. I don\u2019t think it was a straightforward transaction. But she still did give him the access and put me in harm\u2019s way.\u201d\n\nMoore\u2019s mother, Virginia Guynes, was a teen when she had her. She and the man Moore believed was her biological father, Dan Guynes, moved constantly throughout her childhood, which was plagued with debt, her parents\u2019 addiction, infidelity and constant fighting.\n\nMoore\u2019s mother attempted suicide \u201cmany, many times,\u201d she said. The first time, when Moore was 12, she pulled the pills out of her mother\u2019s mouth to save her.\n\nAlong the way, Moore learned that Dan wasn\u2019t her biological father, leading her to feel like she \u201cwasn\u2019t wanted\u201d by her real dad. Not long after, Dan left, making Moore responsible for her unstable mother. That\u2019s when the bar trips began and the rape occurred. Moore dropped out of high school not long after the assault, moved to L.A. and pursued a career in Hollywood.\n\nHer troubles followed, she said in the interview. During her first role \u2014 on General Hospital \u2014 she developed a problem with alcohol and cocaine. During one of her early and prominent roles \u2014 in 1985\u2019s St. Elmo\u2019s Fire \u2014 she was ordered to go to rehab by the director and producer as her addiction worsened. The character she played in the film, Jules, also had drug problems.\n\n\u201cI mean \u2014 the irony certainly was not lost on me,\u201d she said, calling the trip to rehab in her 20s \u201ca profound gift that they gave me.\u201d\n\nMoore was sober for almost 20 years before she started drinking again \u2014 after meeting third husband Ashton Kutcher. After that marriage had fallen apart, she was just 102 pounds when she suffered a drug-induced seizure while partying with her daughter\u2019s friends and was rushed to the hospital. Not long after, amid estrangement from her three children, she went to treatment to get sober again.\n\n\"I think the thing, if I were to look back, I would say I blinded myself and I lost myself,\" Moore said.\n\nMoore\u2019s interview with Sawyer continues on GMA on Tuesday and Wednesday. Her book Inside Out comes out Tuesday.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:\n\nWant daily pop culture news delivered to your inbox?
