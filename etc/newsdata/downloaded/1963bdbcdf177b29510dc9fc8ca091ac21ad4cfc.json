Residents, their heads bowed, could be seen walking solemnly through Yen Thanh\u2019s rain-soaked streets.\n\nSituated in a remote stretch of Vietnam\u2019s Nghe An province, Yen Thanh is where many of the 39 people found dead in the back of a lorry 6,000 miles away in Essex are believed to have started their tragic journey. The district now finds itself at the epicentre of a global police inquiry into the smuggling ring thought to be responsible for the UK\u2019s biggest murder investigation since the 7/7 London bombings.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hoang Thi Thuong, wife of Nguyen Dinh Tu, a Vietnamese man suspected to be among the victims. Photograph: Nguyen Huy Kham/Reuters\n\nOne Catholic priest, Fr Anthony Dang Huu Nam, is among those who have started the macabre task of collating contact details for all the victims\u2019 families. \u201cThe whole district is covered in sorrow,\u201d Nam said. \u201cThis is a catastrophe for our community.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday night, at the family house of Nguyen Dinh Tu in Phu Xuan, one of the people suspected to have died in the lorry, mourners streamed in and out all day to pay their respects. Inside the house, a dozen women sat on the floor on mats, their eyes red from crying.\n\nTu, the youngest of five brothers and sisters, left home for Europe in March, paying 70m dong (\u00a32,350) to get to Romania, the Observer understands. After working in Romania for some months, he went to Germany and then decided to go to the UK, where his father in law lives, to earn more money.\n\nTu\u2019s father-in-law helped him contact people smugglers who said they could help him get to England \u2013 for a cost of \u00a311,000. He made it to France but his family said they lost contact with him on 22 October. That was the last they heard from him. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard anything from my son,\u201d Nguyen Dinh Sat said.\n\nPlay Video 0:50 Vietnamese community leader says majority of lorry victims were probably from Vietnam - video\n\nThe scale of the tragedy emerged last Wednesday on a bleak industrial estate in Grays at 1.40am when a call was made to paramedics alerting them to a grisly discovery.\n\nYet, four days on, major gaps in our knowledge remain. How the 31 men and eight women came to be in the truck is not yet known. Neither is exactly where all of the victims came from. Police are still desperately trying to track down the driver who delivered the trailer to the Belgian port in Zeebrugge before it was ferried on Tuesday afternoon across the channel to Purfleet in Essex.\n\nBelgian authorities have been tasked with \u201ctracking the route of the container\u201d and apprehending anyone responsible for \u201ccollaborating with the transport.\u201d CCTV at Zeebrugge tracked the sought-after lorry as it arrived at the terminal with reports indicating it was filmed 10 times at the port.\n\nOn Saturday Dirk de Fauw, mayor of Bruges and chair of the port of Zeebrugge, confirmed no breakthrough had been made but was aware some of the suspected victims had been spotted in the country shortly before the tragedy.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A relative looks at an image of Bui Thi Nhung. Photograph: Nguyen Huy Kham/Reuters\n\nAmong them was Vietnamese teenager Bui Thi Nhung, whose Facebook page showed her sightseeing in Brussels on 18 October, before she told friends she was making her way to France and onto the UK where she had relatives.\n\nOn 21 October, two days before the doomed truck was discovered, a friend asked the 19-year-old how her journey was going. \u201cAlmost spring,\u201d Nhung responded, using a term in Vietnamese meaning she had almost reached her destination.\n\nThe teenager then went quiet. On Saturday dozens of worried relatives gathered in the family\u2019s modest courtyard home where her distraught mother lies bedbound from anxiety.\n\n\u201cWe are waiting and hoping it\u2019s not her among the victims, but it\u2019s very likely. We pray for her everyday. There were two people from my village travelling in that group,\u201d said Hoang Thi Linh, Nhung\u2019s cousin.\n\nDespite an initial statement from Essex police that the 39 victims were Chinese, emerging evidence suggests it is increasingly likely that the majority of victims were from Vietnam.\n\nPlay Video 1:03 Essex lorry deaths: 'We cannot speculate about the nationality of the deceased,' say police \u2013 video\n\nEssex police revealed on Saturday that detectives had met the Vietnamese ambassador and were \u201cengaging\u201d with the UK\u2019s Vietnamese community to try to identify victims, though could not rule out other nationalities among the dead.\n\nPrevious similar tragedies suggest the identification process will take many more days. So far the only families to have gone public with their concerns about missing loved-ones are those of Pham Thi Tra My, a 26-year-old woman, and Nguyen Dinh Luong, 20.\n\nOn Friday the family of Pham revealed they had paid \u00a330,000 for her to travel to the UK, but were increasingly fearful she was sealed inside the refrigerated container when she finally arrived. A sequence of messages stated: \u201cI\u2019m sorry Mum. My path abroad has not succeeded. Mum, I love you so much. I\u2019m dying because I can\u2019t breathe.\u201d\n\nLuong earlier this month told family that he planned to travel to Britain from France. His father has described receiving a call several days ago from a Vietnamese individual saying that \u201csomething unexpected happened\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Nguyen Dinh Luong and Pham Thi Tra are believed to have been among the victims.

Tu\u2019s wife, Hoang Thi Thuong, said she still owed money to the people smugglers who had offered to get him to Britain, although some reports yesterday said those responsible were handing out refunds to families of the dead.\n\n\u201cI have a big debt to pay, no hope, and no energy to do anything,\u201d she told Reuters. Tu and Nhung had joined the huge numbers fleeing one of Vietnam\u2019s poorest provinces. According to a recent report by the Pacific Links Foundation, a US-based anti-trafficking organisation, more victims are trafficked from Nghe An than anywhere else in Vietnam to be exploited in Europe.\n\n\u201cNghe An is a top source province for labour or guest workers moving overseas,\u201d said the report. Analysing the province\u2019s demographics, it found 58% of the population \u2013 1.8 million out of 3.1 million people \u2013 are eligible as \u201clabour resources\u201d and that many families in Nghe An have close relatives who work overseas, including a significant number of parents whose children are then left in the care of extended family\n\nFor those who remain in the town, located 180 miles south of Hanoi, it remains to be a seen whether last week\u2019s tragedy will slow the exodus. For now, they can only pray. \u201cI will hold a ceremony to pray for them tonight,\u201d said Nam.", "description": "Relatives of those thought to have perished in Essex face a terrible wait for news", "authors": ["Mark Townsend"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b4e7ff68f0a4bdc3cbcf5659df034d93b53ae2d/0_52_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=95ec0e5de2cfc475a5ebbfa18da5a5f5", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
