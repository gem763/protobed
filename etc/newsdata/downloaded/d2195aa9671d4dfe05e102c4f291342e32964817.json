It grows incredibly quickly -- and up to 8 meters (26 feet) high -- making it a sustainable building material that has endured for centuries.\n\nThe poles were once used to build huts and small-scale projects, though bamboo grids stretching hundreds of meters into the air alongside modern high-rises are now a common sight.\n\nThe merging of old and new is a central theme in \u00d3 and Machado's bamboo projects. And Macao, with its blend of Portuguese and Chinese history, offers a rich palate for them to work with.\n\nPreserving Macao's bamboo tradition through sculptural works\n\nThe first Portuguese settlers arrived in Macao in the 1500s and it soon became an important hub along Portugal's Asian trading route. Portuguese influences can be seen in the European architecture and the distinctive blue and white tiles that the merchants imported on their ships. Chinese influences are also apparent, especially in the A-Ma Temple, built in 1488, one of the city's oldest buildings.\n\nIn 2005, the city's historical center was added to the World Heritage List as a place of outstanding universal value -- an accolade it owes, in part, to bamboo.\n\nEvery year, residents build a bamboo-shed theater outside the A-Ma Temple to pray for the safety of fishermen at sea. It's a tradition that has endured in this port city for more than 100 years -- one that captured the attention of the two architects, who live next door.\n\nBamboo has long been used for construction in China.

In that time he has erected hundreds of skeleton frames with his bare hands, instinctively judging the correct length of the bamboo poles and how they should be assembled. Over the years, he's worked on commemorative arches, swimming sheds and buildings that stretch up dozens of stories.\n\nHis knowledge can only be passed down through intensive physical training, but in recent years there have been few candidates willing to learn.\n\n\"Young people are not interested in this field because it is dangerous, working in high elevation above the ground, and it is hard labor under the strong sun,\" says Chio. \"We are old and have to retire, but we want to take our industry global to spread our culture and crafts.\"\n\nThere are fewer than 50 bamboo experts left in Macao, Chio says. This statistic alarmed the Impromptu Projects team, which has closely observed the scaffolders as they work.\n\nChio says there have been too few candidates who are willing to learn the technique of bamboo scaffolding.

Using 3D models, the bamboo artisans set about recreating their vision, lifting and tying each pole by hand.\n\nWorkers climb onto slender poles woven into web-like walls and platforms to construct the city's buildings.
