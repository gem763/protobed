She was meeting with the visiting Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte.\n\nArdern told RNZ that it was important New Zealanders faced up to uncomfortable realities around Cook\u2019s arrival in New Zealand, and she had already spent two days in Gisborne over the weekend. Ardern said her decision not to attend today\u2019s commemoration should not be read as political move. \u201cThere are things that need to be talked about when we talk about the 250th anniversary. Never before has the story fully been told of the loss of life when Cook arrived,\u201d Ardern said.\n\n\u201cThis is the chance to talk about the reality of New Zealand\u2019s history, to acknowledge it, to be open about it. That might attract some protests but that is all part of the conversation.\u201d\n\nPeople in Gisborne expressed mixed emotions about the arrival of the replica Endeavour.\n\n\u201cHe killed some of our ancestors. Why it is even coming here? Publicising this man, when this place was already discovered - it\u2019s hard,\u201d one woman told the New Zealand Herald.", "description": "Replica of the Endeavour sails coastline as part of flotilla that has been met with a mix of celebration and grief", "authors": ["Eleanor Ainge Roy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2da0c308acc9bbd1a7e9793d4c7ac04eaa70eaac/510_0_2946_1767/master/2946.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bd469e8c35e12d3483aff016f5eea5ab", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
