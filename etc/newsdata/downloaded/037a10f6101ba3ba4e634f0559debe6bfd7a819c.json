I say it again: if you try to frame our operation there as an invasion, our task is simple: we will open the doors and send 3.6 million migrants to you,' Erdogan told the parliament in Ankara last Thursday as his bombardments began on northern Syria.\n\nMillions crossed into Turkey during the Syrian Civil War, fleeing President Bashar al-Assad and ISIS, and Erdogan has outlined a controversial 'safe zone' to repatriate those migrants.\n\nOrban told private broadcaster HirTV: 'The next weeks will decide what Turkey does with these people ... It can steer them in two directions: take them back to Syria or set them off towards Europe.\n\n'If Turkey chooses the latter, these people will arrive at Hungary's southern border in huge masses,' Orban said, adding that the EU, while criticising Ankara, should provide more funds to Turkey to help rebuild Syrian towns.\n\nThe EU relies on Turkey to curb the arrival of refugees into the continent following a 2016 agreement to seal off the Aegean route after more than a million people entered the bloc.\n\nHungarian forces erecting Orban's border fence at the height of the migrant crisis in 2015\n\nOrban, who has often been at loggerheads with Brussels over some of his policies affecting migrants, said currently there were about 90,000 people on the Balkans migration route and their ranks could swell to 100,000 shortly.\n\nOrban's nationalist government has forged close relations with Turkey, China and some ex-Soviet states in Middle Asia as part of an eastern opening initiative.\n\nErdogan is due to come to Budapest for a visit early next month.", "description": "Turkey, which hosts 3.6 million Syrian refugees, threatened to 'open the gates' to allow them into Europe if the EU portrayed Turkey's incursion into northeast Syria negatively.", "authors": ["Ross Ibbetson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/11/19832106-0-image-a-47_1571308128354.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
