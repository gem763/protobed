The placid woman on the end of the phone tell us she is \u201chere to tolerate you\u201d and your problems. One man (played by satirist Mark Humphries himself) complains that \u201cthe whole charade has gone too far\u201d, noting that Greta Thunberg is now even \u201cspeaking in front of a mock UN.\u201d Upon hearing that it was in fact the \u201creal UN\u201d she was addressing, the man proceeds to faint, dropping his phone on the way down.\n\nThe video draws attention to the criticism Greta Thunberg has received over the last month, mocking the online trolling culture which allows keyboard warriors to hide behind fake profile pictures on social media. It also amusingly tackles the fabricated solutions many offer on how to live more sustainably, when complaining that environmentalists don\u2019t practice what they preach (\u201cif she\u2019s so concerned about renewable energy, how come she doesn\u2019t wear one of those baseball caps with the solar panels and the fan on the front?\u201d).\n\nThe video has since been shared on Twitter by the likes of actor Mark Ruffalo and even Greta Thunberg herself, who wrote: \u201cHang in there! Help is available.\u201d\n\nWhat do people dislike about Greta Thunberg?\n\nEver since her poignant speech at the UN last month, a select number of people have taken umbrage with the Swedish teen, calling her message negative and demoralising. British TV presenter Piers Morgan wrote in a tweet, \u201cshe\u2019s got just very, very angry about climate change, abused loads of adults & terrified millions of children.\u201d\n\nIn the same vein, British political donor Arron Banks even went as far as to joke about the possibility of Greta\u2019s yacht to the US sinking in a freak accident, while American conservative commentator Dinesh D\u2019Souza even compared the 16-year-old to Nazi propaganda. His words were, \u201cChildren\u2014notably Nordic white girls with braids and red cheeks\u2014were often used in Nazi propaganda,\u201d including a photo in the tweet of the teen alongside a woman in Nazi-style clothing.\n\nThis blast of criticism prompted the media to respond with a flurry of articles. The Financial Times wrote a feature on \u201cWhy middle-aged men hate Greta Thunberg\u201d, while the Independent took the line \u201cGreta Thunberg faces the vitriol of men because she's a 16-year-old girl who isn't being sexualised.\u201d\n\nClearly, ABC Australia decided to take a different approach, with the generous offer of a dedicated helpline for those with hilariously unsubstantiated claims about the teen activist.", "description": "An Australian news outlet has taken a more humorous approach to the recent criticism of the teen activist.", "authors": ["Maeve Campbell"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/22/47/40/1000x563_cmsv2_b5eeef82-3b6a-5879-b47f-8699155ff7a9-4224740.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
