Mertens and Sabalenka defeated Victoria Azarenka and Ash Barty 7-5, 7-5 on Sunday at Arthur Ashe Stadium to win the U.S. Open women\u2019s doubles championship. Mertens and Sabalenka lost only one set in the tournament and won their first Grand Slam title as a team. The fourth-seeded team faced only one other seeded team on their way to the title.\n\n\u201cFrom the start of the season, start of the year actually, we were like, we\u2019re going to play together,\u201d Mertens said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t think we would achieve this big thing.\u201d\n\nMertens was defeated in singles play in the quarterfinals by eventual champion Bianca Andreescu.\n\n\u201cEven if we lose singles, and it\u2019s always tough, we still committed to play doubles,\u201d Mertens said. \u201cOf course in a Grand Slam you want to win, you want to win matches. You want to win this title. So we\u2019re just 100 percent committed to both. Of course, singles is a priority still.\u201d\n\nBIG DRAW\n\nThe US Open set an attendance record for the event with 737,872 fans over the two weeks of the main draw. Arthur Ashe Stadium sold out 23 of 24 sessions.\n\nJUNIOR ACHEIVERS\n\nMaria Camila Osorio Serrano found out winning a championship has its perks. The U.S. Open juniors champion walked into the media room and asked, \u201cAc\u00e1 se ha sentado Federer?\u201d\n\nYes, Roger Federer did sit in that same seat.\n\nSerrano took the junior singles title with a 6-1, 6-0 victory over Alexandra Yepifanova.\n\nAsked her celebratory plans, the 17-year-old out of Colombia quipped, \u201cparty.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m kidding. I\u2019m not 18 yet,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cI need to be 21. I need to wait a little bit. Maybe when I get back to Colombia. Party.\u201d\n\nJonas Forejtek of the Czech Republic won the other junior championship on Saturday with a 6-7 (4), 6-0, 6-2 victory over Emilio Nava.\n\nWHEELCHAIR WINNERS\n\nAlfie Hewett won his second straight wheelchair men\u2019s title with a 7-6 (9), 7-6 (5) victory over Stephane Houdet. The 48-year-old Houdet became the oldest male to play in a Grand Slam singles final.\n\nDiede de Groot beat Yui Kamiji 4-6, 6-1, 6-4 to win the women\u2019s wheelchair Open championship.\n\nRATINGS WINNER\n\nBianca Andreescu\u2019s win over Serena Williams in the U.S. Open women\u2019s final gave ESPN its highest rating ever for the event. The 2.7 rating was up 13 percent from last year. ESPN has had exclusivity and aired the entire tournament since 2015.
