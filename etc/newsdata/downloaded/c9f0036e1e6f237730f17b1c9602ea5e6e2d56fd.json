September 2019 came within a day of matching that distinction.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Sept. 12, a trifling 0.03 inches boosted the total at the airport to 0.11, matching 2005\u2019s figure. After that, suspense built, as hour followed hour, day followed day, sometimes clear, sometimes cloudy. But not rainy.\n\nAs the end of the month drew ever closer, the record seemed within our grasp.
