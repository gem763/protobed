(NOAA)\n\nBill Lapenta helped to predict and prepare for some of nature\u2019s most dangerous phenomena at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, heading the national center that monitors hurricanes, ocean conditions and more. Yet, it was a weather phenomenon that may have caused his drowning Monday, as he was caught in rough surf with a heightened risk of rip currents along a North Carolina beach in Duck.\n\nNews that the prominent D.C.-area scientist died earlier this week, after being pulled unresponsive from hazardous waters, has shaken a scientific community that colleagues say loved and looked up to Lapenta \u2014 as both a top scientist driven to perfect the numbers behind NOAA\u2019s analyses and a leader who cared first and foremost about people.\n\n\u201cThe tragic loss of Bill Lapenta has left the weather community, myself included, in a state of shock,\u201d wrote Neil Jacobs, the acting head of NOAA in an email to colleagues. \u201cBill was not only a dedicated coworker, but he was a great friend and fearless leader.\u201d\n\nThe National Weather Service, a division of NOAA, had warned Monday of dangerous rip currents along North Carolina beaches \u2014 propelled by wind and Atlantic swells from distant but powerful Hurricane Lorenzo \u2014 that could pull swimmers out from the shore. Local officials say the cause of Lapenta\u2019s death remains unknown but added that surf conditions and a rip current probably played a role.\n\nFor colleague Kim Klockow, a NOAA affiliate at the University of Oklahoma, the tragedy was a sober reminder for those in Lapenta\u2019s line of work: \u201cWe\u2019re just as vulnerable as everyone else.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe may have all this knowledge and all the ability to forecast, and at the end of the day we have to do the exact same thing \u2014 to prepare and hope for the best \u2014 that anyone does,\u201d Klockow said. \u201cAnd that is humbling.\u201d\n\nAuthorities responded Monday afternoon to a report of a swimmer \u201cno longer visible from the beach,\u201d according to a statement from the town of Duck. Lifeguards pulled 58-year-old Lapenta out of the ocean within minutes. Emergency responders began CPR and other measures, but Lapenta was soon pronounced dead.\n\nRed flags did not fly on Duck\u2019s beach until a day later, a town spokeswoman told the Weather Channel. The National Weather Service\u2019s map of surf zone deaths, which includes data through early September, records seven people killed in rip currents in North Carolina earlier this year, out of 42 around the country.\n\nWord of Lapenta\u2019s death spread quickly among those familiar with his career at NASA and then NOAA starting in 2008. In NOAA\u2019s Office of Weather and Air Quality, where Lapenta spent the last several months as acting director, Gina Eosco gathered with colleagues Tuesday for a wrenching hour of tributes to the boss they\u2019d laughed with at a staff retreat just a few days before.\n\n\u201cAny stage of grief, I think we had it in the room,\u201d Eosco told The Post.\n\nEosco remembered a man who made a point of meeting one-on-one with every member of his new office \u2014 a leader who truly listened to what his colleagues said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d know it because a couple weeks later he would mention it again,\u201d Eosco said. \u201cAnd he would go, \u2018I\u2019m still thinking about that. I\u2019ve got ideas. We\u2019ll meet next week.\u2019 \u201d\n\nLouis Uccellini, director of the National Weather Service, highlighted Lapenta\u2019s tenure as the director of NOAA\u2019s National Centers for Environmental Prediction in Maryland, as well as his leading role in developing a better system for modeling U.S. weather and climate.\n\nUccellini also pointed to Lapenta\u2019s many roles beyond scientist: those of \u201can amazing partner and collaborator, an energetic mentor, and a devoted husband and father,\u201d Uccellini stated.\n\nLapenta\u2019s family said in a statement they are \u201cdevastated\u201d but also \u201coverwhelmed by the outpouring of love and support\u201d that has come their way.\n\nThe mourning for Lapenta extends beyond his co-workers to others in the atmospheric science community: The American Meteorological Society called him \u201ca champion for the Weather, Water, & Climate Enterprise,\u201d while the Weather Channel\u2019s Rick Knabb remembered Lapenta\u2019s kindness and willingness to collaborate.\n\nThat penchant for working with others meant that Lapenta transitioned easily into his new role at the Office of Weather and Air Quality, Eosco said. Lapenta came into the job passionate about the modeling system he\u2019d been hard at work spearheading but also eager to learn about Eosco\u2019s human-centered work as a social scientist. At last week\u2019s retreat, Eosco recalled, Lapenta marveled that he was busier than ever.\n\nHe looked around at his new staff, she said, before declaring, \u201cAnd I love it.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nUSDA relocation has delayed key studies and millions in funding, employees say\n\nIn all-staff email, NOAA chief praises scientists after agency\u2019s defense of incorrect Trump tweet\n\nFollowing Washington\u2019s hottest October day on record, cooler air is on the way", "description": "One of the top federal weather forecasters in the United States died in rough seas off the coast of North Carolina on Monday.", "authors": ["Hannah Knowles", "General Assignment Reporter", "Jason Samenow", "Editor", "Writer Covering Weather", "October At Am", "Hannah Knowles Is A Reporter On The General Assignment Team.
