So what does \u2018boketto\u2019 mean?\n\nMark Radcliffe and Paul Langley are sipping tea in central Manchester. The former is the much-loved radio star; the latter is something of a mystery. \u201cGood, the less said the better,\u201d Langley says from behind his spectacles and pot of Earl Grey. However, I do know he once made an EP in an outfit called Rack-It! \u201cThat was with Martyn Walsh from Inspiral Carpets,\u201d he laughs. \u201cHe said, \u2018You wanna do a track called Sex on Acid \u2013 that\u2019ll annoy people.\u2019 And it did.\u201d\n\nRadcliffe and Langley are, they tell me, \u201csoon to be legendary\u201d. This will be in the guise of UNE, the name they have given themselves. The pair have made Lost, an album of lovely, plaintive electronica over which Radcliffe sings. They met five years ago in the Builder\u2019s Arms in Knutsford, Cheshire. Radcliffe, new to the area, asked locals which pub was dog-friendly. This led to dog-walk encounters with Langley, and the pair were soon bantering over pints, about music and Manchester City.\n\nWhen I heard Paul's music, I thought: 'This is surprisingly good'\n\nOne day Langley mentioned the fact he made electronic music, and Radcliffe groaned. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it would be any good,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause he\u2019s such a clown. But his hidden shallows turned out to be hidden depths. When I heard it, I thought, \u2018This is surprisingly good.\u2019\u201d\n\nRadcliffe was reading Lost in Translation, Ella Frances Sanders\u2019 illustrated compendium of untranslatable words from around the world. He wondered if it was possible to write a song called Boketto, which means \u201cto gaze vacantly into the distance without thinking\u201d in Japanese. \u201cSo I\u2019d give Paul the idea and the picture from the book. He\u2019d write music and I\u2019d go away and write words.\u201d The pair were surprised at how effectively this created what Radcliffe calls \u201celectronic pop songs, but very warm and dreamlike\u201d.\n\nMark Radcliffe \u2018surprised\u2019 to lose BBC show during cancer Read more\n\nRadcliffe hopes UNE aren\u2019t seen as \u201csome radio bloke having a dabble\u201d. He was, after all, in bands before becoming a DJ. \u201cI\u2019ve never really seen a divide between the two. Sometimes it helps and sometimes it doesn\u2019t because radio people think, \u2018We can\u2019t play that \u2013 it\u2019s Mark.\u2019 I just hope we get the same chance as everyone else.\u201d\n\nOver the years, his DJing has coexisted with playing in the not-yet-legendary pirate folkies Galleon Blast, spoof combo the Shirehorses, and Dr Feelgood-inspired Mark Radcliffe and the Big Figures. Early on, he even played drums in Skrewdriver, before singer Ian Donaldson became known as a white supremacist. \u201cThere were never any obvious signs of that while I was in them,\u201d says the avowedly anti-racist DJ. \u201cHe did wear jackboots, though. God, I\u2019m making this worse, aren\u2019t I?\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, UNE\u2019s press release calls Langley a \u201cHa\u00e7ienda DJ-booth fixture\u201d. Langley laughs. \u201cMy brother was actually the DJ. But I carried his record box around the world.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018I don\u2019t pay my licence fee to hear scummy northerners\u2019 \u2026 Mark Radcliffe with \u2018Lard\u2019 Riley in their breakfast show days. Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian\n\nRadcliffe\u2019s radio career began in 1979 when, at the age of 21, Manchester\u2019s Piccadilly Radio asked him to present Transmissions, a show about the music exploding in the city, triggered by Joy Division and Factory Records. \u201cI thought, \u2018How hard can that be?\u2019 I tried to be Manchester\u2019s John Peel, telling people what we were playing in a manic depressive voice.\u201d\n\nIn 1997, he found himself (alongside ex-Fall guitarist Marc \u201cLard\u201d Riley) briefly hosting Radio 1\u2019s flagship breakfast show. \u201cIt was the biggest show in Europe \u2013 until we took it over,\u201d he chuckles. Their anarchic, edgy, Mancunian humour didn\u2019t always travel. \u201cI\u2019ve never forgotten the focus-group woman in Guildford who said, \u2018I don\u2019t pay my licence fee to hear scummy northerners.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut his radio persona \u2013 self-effacing, ordinary bloke lost in music \u2013 works because it\u2019s real. Langley roars at the tale Radcliffe tells of the time he and Lard were in David Bowie\u2019s dressing room with the star asking where \u201cHeroes\u201d should go on the setlist. \u201cI\u2019m thinking, \u2018Is this really happening?\u2019\u201d Radcliffe hoots. \u201cDon\u2019t ask us, Dave!\u201d\n\nIn August last year, Radcliffe was diagnosed with cancer. As Langley ferried his mate around during treatment, the pair became even closer. Radcliffe is now cancer-free and doesn\u2019t want to spend his life worrying that it will come back. After well-received performances at Bluedot and Kendal Calling festivals, there will be more gigs, although the pair have yet to master the demands of being electronic gods.\n\n\u201cOne night,\u201d says Radcliffe, \u201cinstead of singing, \u2018The distant clatter of a thunderstorm\u2019, I sang, \u2018The distant clatter of a leprechaun.\u2019 You can see the trouble we\u2019ve got.\u201d", "description": "The DJ has made an album inspired by untranslatable words, recorded with a bloke he met in the pub called Paul Langley.
