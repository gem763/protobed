Sure, when you started out popping off for 15 minute jogs after work it might\u2019ve been fine to throw on your dad\u2019s faded Nirvana T-shirt. Or just chuck on a vest top.\n\nBut these items will not cut it for more serious running. As the weather starts to take a turn and colder winds rush in, it\u2019s crucial to find the perfect running top that keeps you warm but doesn\u2019t leave you sweating after a few minutes of hill sprints.\n\nThe fabric must be light, breathable and ideally, tight-fitting so as not to leave any space for cold air. Depending on the weather, you may also want to seek out something with a built-in hood.\n\nAgain, this must be lightweight so it doesn\u2019t weigh you down. Sometimes, if the sun is shining and you\u2019re venturing outdoors, a crop top might be more appropriate.\n\nWe tested the running tops in various conditions, from warm afternoon jogs to sweaty treadmill sprints. It was also crucial to see how these tops fared in poor weather, from rainy mornings to windy nights. Some are more suited to others, but of course personal preference also has a role to play.\n\nFrom the long-sleeved saviours to the perfect tank tees, read on for our pick of the best running tops.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

The material is thin enough to keep you cool in moments of sunshine and the short cap sleeves allow your arms to breathe. But the length of the top \u2013 it can be pulled down quite far so that it almost covers your glutes \u2013 will warm you up during chillier periods. You could even consider tucking it into your leggings for extra heat. But the standout element of this top is its anti-odour technology that will actually prevent you from smelling after even the sweatiest of runs.\n\nBuy now\n\nPerff Studio shake it out crop top: \u00a360, Perff\n\nThis is a particularly stylish running top that might not suit all tastes but is unbelievably comfortable to run in given how soft and stretchy it is. The fit is so close to your body, it almost makes you feel like you\u2019re wearing nothing at all. The mesh low back offers plenty of ventilation \u2013 though you might want to consider your choice of sports bra if you want to keep the back bare as it does dip rather low. The fabric is quick-drying too, it\u2019s an all-round winner so long as you like the unique design.\n\nBuy now\n\nSweaty Betty kenza crop gym vest: \u00a340, Sweaty Betty\n\nThis is a simple no-frills running top that will be suited to those who prefer to exercise in high-waisted leggings. It won\u2019t double up as a sports bra, though, so be sure to wear one underneath to ensure maximum comfort. The sweat-wicking and quick drying fabric makes it an ideal choice in terms of practicality, while the style side of things is somewhat simple. There is no brash branding or pattern aside from a small logo on the front and \u201cSweaty Betty\u201d embossed in black text on the back. If you choose this one, we suggest you honour the simplicity by keeping the rest of your outfit all-black. Even the trainers, if you can.\n\nBuy now\n\nNike women\u2019s mesh running tank: \u00a323.97, Nike\n\nThis running top is made from a unique crocheted mesh material. The look is more athletic than athleisure, with a racerback design created to match the back of your sports bra. It also uses the label\u2019s \u201cdri-fit\u201d technology, which is specially to keep runners cool and is very quick-drying. Not that it impacts how well you can run, but another perk of this top is that it is part of Nike\u2019s rebel capsule collection, which features garments that champion female autonomy and ambition.\n\nBuy now\n\nAdidas by Stella Mccartney essential mesh-panel performance T-shirt: \u00a370, Matches\n\nThis is a deeply flattering running top. So flattering, in fact, that you\u2019ll almost certainly want to keep on wearing it even after you\u2019ve finished your run. The sleeves are a little longer than the standard short-sleeved top, providing that little bit of extra coverage. Meanwhile, mesh panelling is carefully placed along the shoulders, hem and back, creating a flattering silhouette in addition to keeping you cool. It is white, though, so you\u2019re better off avoiding running through any muddied fields when you\u2019re wearing it in case you take a tumble and wind up staining your lovely top. If mud runs are your thing, this is not the top for you.\n\nBuy now\n\nVarley buckley tank: \u00a352, Varley\n\nSometimes you really just want to run in something that is loose and airy \u2013 this is the top for those moments. Varley is one of the first activewear brands that became popular in the UK on Instagram. It hails from Australia but quickly became famed on the \u2018gram for its python print sport sets. This soft and slouchy top is a much more classic option from the brand that is ideal for casual park jogs on a warm day. There\u2019s a keyhole-shaped cut-out at the back to provide a bit of extra breathing room, and the sleeves hang low, giving you room to show off the print of your sports bra. The pale grey shade is also incredibly versatile and easy to wear.\n\nBuy now\n\nUnder Armour long-sleeve hoodie: \u00a355, Under Armour\n\nNobody really wants to go running outside when it\u2019s raining, but if you\u2019re training for a long race it will be an inevitable necessity. At least it will if you live in the UK. The solution? Because a hooded sweatshirt would be far too clunky and running with an umbrella would look ridiculous, you need to find a long-sleeved hooded top like this one. It\u2019s very light and features a funnel neck that fits snugly around your face and effectively prevents you from getting soaked. The material also conveniently wicks sweat and doesn\u2019t cling to your body as you run. For a really cold run, you could wear another, more tight-fitting top underneath. But you could just as easily pair this with a sports bra and be okay. Go with your gut.\n\nBuy now\n\nPE Nation lead force embroidered cotton-jersey tank: \u00a380, Net A Porter\n\nThe simple P.E Nation jersey tank top might not have the bells and whistles of some of the other options mentioned here, but it gets the job done just as efficiently. Given the soft cotton fabric and the round neck, think of this as an upgrade from the old Nirvana top. Yes, it\u2019s just as comforting and loose, but it\u2019s sleeveless and probably a little stretchier. The arms are also cut low to provide ventilation, which you might need a little more with this top given there\u2019s no mesh panelling on quick dry fabric involved.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Women's running tops\n\nIt has to be Lululemon for the win. While the length of the T-shirt can become annoying at times, the seamless design, breathable material and tight fit truly ticks the boxes in terms of a good running top. The American company is leading the way in the athleisure sector for a reason.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
