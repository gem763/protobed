Instead of these threats, the government should enshrine people\u2019s rights to stay in law so they are protected and not put at risk by failings in a bureaucratic process \u2013 as the Home Affairs Committee has recommended.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that the government have not learned the lessons from the Windrush scandal, which showed how easily individuals can fall through gaps in the system through no fault of their own, and how easily lives can be destroyed if the government gets this wrong.\u201d\n\nChristine Jardine, the Lib Dem home affairs spokesperson, said it was clear that Boris Johnson had no intention of automatically guaranteeing the rights of EU citizens.\n\nShe said: \u201cNo one seriously believes the Home Office will have granted settled status to all 3.6 million EU citizens by the Conservatives\u2019 arbitrary December 2020 deadline.\n\n\u201cThousands will inevitably be left effectively undocumented \u2013 and now the government is saying it will deport them. That is totally unacceptable.\u201d\n\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cEU citizens are our friends, family and neighbours and we want them to stay.\n\n\u201cThe EU settlement scheme is a free and easy way for EU citizens to get the UK immigration status they need.\n\n\u201cWe have received 2 million applications and are looking for reasons to grant status, not refuse, and EU citizens have until at least December 2020 to apply.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always been clear that where they have reasonable grounds for missing the deadline, they\u2019ll be given a further opportunity to apply.\u201d", "description": "A Conservative minister sparked alarm among EU nationals after appearing to suggest\u00a0thousands of people without settled status\u00a0could be deported after Brexit.
