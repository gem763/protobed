A teenager was sentenced to four years for manslaughter.\n\nPat said: \u201cHugging Mark was so special, feeling his heart beat and knowing we\u2019d done the right thing in the middle of a horrendous situation.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\u201cAdam would\u2019ve been a lovely dad, so seeing that Mark and Caroline had managed to become parents because of Adam was especially touching.\u201d\n\nMark could empathise with the couple\u2019s pain after losing a younger brother in a road accident a few years earlier.\n\nHe also learned how Adam\u2019s organs saved four other lives \u2013 his lungs went to a 66-year-old man, his heart to a 53-year-old, his liver to a 54-year-old and one of his kidneys went to a boy aged six.\n\nAll recipients sent letters of thanks \u2013 but, unlike Mark, none had met up with Pat and Dave.\n\nThe couple told Mark they had set up a charity \u2013 Every Action Has Consequences \u2013 in Adam\u2019s memory.\n\nIt provides \u00adinformation to young people on binge-drinking, violence and anger-management.\n\n\u201cIt seemed obvious that all of us saw this as an opportunity to make the world a better place and I pledged I\u2019d do anything I could to help,\u201d Mark said.\n\n\u201cMeeting Dave and Pat for the first time was the most heartbreaking but also life-affirming moment ever.\n\n\"Their son had saved my life and they made that happen through their \u00adultimate altruism.\n\n\u201cBut I also realised the massive hole they now had in their family.\n\n\u201cI showed Dave and Pat a photo of our 12-month-old daughter Emily, telling them how that wouldn\u2019t have been possible without Adam\u2019s organs.\n\n\u201cStraightaway they showed me a photo of their new grandson, also named Adam, who was the same age as Emily. In that moment I knew this might be the start of something really special.\n\n\u201cThat night I sat at my computer and started writing a list of all the challenges I would take on, to raise money for charity and awareness of organ donation.\u201d\n\nMark has climbed Snowdon, taken part in Transplant Games three times, hiked the Yorkshire Three Peaks, scaled 3,195ft Ben Lomond \u2013 and over six days trekked the 88-mile length of Hadrian\u2019s Wall.\n\nPat, and Caroline\u2019s father John, joined Mark on Hadrian\u2019s Wall \u2013 raising over \u00a31,750 for Kidney Care UK \u2013 while Dave provided en-route support.\n\nMark went on: \u201cDuring those eight days of wind, rain and all the elements you can think of, we chatted endlessly about Adam, about our own \u00adhappiness, our loves and dreams.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s during those times that you really bond and we knew from then on we\u2019d be friends for life, closer than any of us could have imagined.\u201d\n\nMark has joined a string of charity groups and completed a number of other walks and climbs.\n\nA black tie dinner in Harrogate topped \u00a311,000 and in total he has raised more than \u00a315,000 for Kidney Care UK, the Donor Family Network and the \u00adHarrogate Dialysis Unit.\n\nMark finds his new energy and vigour a joy after a 25-year battle to control his type 1 diabetes with daily insulin injections and his diet.\n\nBy his mid-30s he was experiencing complications with his sight, bladder and stomach \u2013 and was put on the transplant waiting list after suffering kidney failure.\n\nHe said: \u201cWaiting for that all-important call saying a compatible pancreas and kidney had been found was horrific, knowing I would die without them \u2013 and mine and \u00adCaroline\u2019s dreams of having family would be gone.\u201d\n\nThen, in the summer of 2009, Mark got the call that changed his life.\n\nCaroline, a biomedical scientist, drove him from their home in \u00adHarrogate, North Yorks, to Manchester Royal Infirmary, where he had the eight-hour transplants.\n\nTwo weeks later he was home.\n\nHe admitted: \u201cI was filled with a massive sense of joy and gratitude, but also of guilt, that someone else had to die for me to live.\u201d\n\nIt was months later that Caroline conceived \u2013 and Emily was born in September 2010.\n\nIn 2015 the couple adopted baby daughter Ellie.\n\nMark used to be a corporate manager with RBS but is now a motivational speaker, giving talks to charities and local interest groups. And Adam remains a constant inspiration.\n\nHe added: \u201cNot only have the new organs given to me by the Rogers family given me a new lease of life, they have defined and shaped who I am, what I do.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got countless more projects and challenges ahead of me and with Dave and Pat alongside me, I know there\u2019s nothing we can\u2019t achieve.\u201d\n\nFind out more about Every Action Has Consequences here\n\nMark is fundraising for Kidney Care UK.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Super-fundraiser Mark Smith has a bucket list of challenges after a vital double transplant from donor Adam Rogers - and a special friendship with Adam's parents", "authors": ["Matt Barbour", "Image", "Copyright Nik Pickard", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20655555.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PROD-Adam-Rogers-killed-by-single-punch.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
