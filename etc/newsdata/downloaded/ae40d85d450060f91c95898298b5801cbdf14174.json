(Tami Chappell/Reuters)\n\nThere\u2019s no good reason to end a time-honored fan tradition that is, by any conceivable standard, benign.\n\nIt took a prolonged rebuild and a few managerial changes, but the Atlanta Braves are back atop the National League East, a division they had dominated for almost two decades. There is no Glavine, Smoltz, or Maddux on Atlanta\u2019s 2019 roster, but they might not need one \u2014 fueled by a potent lineup featuring veterans such as Freddie Freeman and Josh Donaldson and talented upstarts such as Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr., Braves baseball is back. It\u2019s fun to watch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe environment at Atlanta\u2019s SunTrust Park mirrors the youthful verve of the team. Catch a Braves game in Atlanta and you\u2019ll see it \u2014 the fans are raucous, serenading the players with a chant that accompanies every high-leverage situation, \u201cchopping\u201d a sea of foam tomahawks in concert as they go. And the players feed off of their energy.\n\nThe postseason provides the requisite pretext for an otherwise athletically illiterate pundit class to dip its toes into the world of professional baseball. So, naturally, the \u201ctomahawk chop\u201d chant has of late drawn the ire of those wont to have their ire drawn. Amid a growing swell of Twitter outrage, a reporter with the St. Louis Dispatch asked St. Louis Cardinals rookie pitcher and Cherokee Nation member Ryan Helsley what he thought of the chant. Helsley, who had just pitched against the Braves in the National League Division Series, said that he found the chant to be \u201ca misrepresentation of the Cherokee people or Native Americans in general,\u201d one that \u201cdepicts them in this kind of caveman-type people way who aren\u2019t intellectual.\u201d He lamented that Natives are \u201cused as mascots\u201d by the Braves and other teams.\n\nWhile some in the press have since disseminated Helsley\u2019s view as if it were representative of all Native peoples, among Native Americans themselves there has long been a diversity of opinion on the merits of Native iconography and mascots. Indeed, the lack of consensus among tribes and Native people on the issue continues to stymie the efforts of activists who want to eliminate all Native-themed mascots from the sports world. To take but one example of the frequently surprising results pollsters get when they ask self-identified Natives about the issue, a Wolvereye poll from earlier this year found that the adjective such respondents most commonly associated with the Washington Redskins\u2019 team name \u2014a brand far more fraught and controversial than that of the Braves \u2014 was \u201cproud.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is an activist to do with that result? One response \u2014 a tack that will no doubt be used again \u2014 has been to dismiss the Wolvereye findings out of hand because respondents weren\u2019t required to demonstrate tribal citizenship to pollsters. It\u2019s nevertheless worth noting that Wolvereye\u2019s findings are congruent with those of a rigorous 2016 Washington Post poll of Native peoples on the Redskins controversy, which found that nine in ten Natives surveyed were not offended by the team name.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAre we to believe that the same Native Americans would be more outraged by a foam tomahawk?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe origins of Atlanta\u2019s tomahawk-chop chant are innocuous enough \u2014 two-sport star and former Florida State Seminole Deion Sanders brought it to Atlanta when he played outfield for the Braves in the early 1990s. The foam tomahawks and associated cheer quickly took hold among Braves fans, eager to baptize the chant as a local tradition. The Braves were not and are not the only team in sports to makes use of the chant; fans of the NFL\u2019s Kansas City Chiefs fans regularly \u201cchop,\u201d as do the Florida State Seminoles, who have been granted the express permission of the Seminole Tribe to partake in the chant and other such rituals.\n\nBut perhaps it\u2019s the mere fact of Native imagery that ought to stir our consciences against the tomahawk chop. To borrow the retort du jour, why should any people at all be a mascot? Context worth considering: The Boston Celtics employ a caricature of an Irishman as their logo. The Notre Dame Fighting Irish use a leprechaun as their mascot. It would seem strange to suggest that the Irish people have not suffered sufficient historical hardship to activate the strict moralizing scrutiny of the press corps. Mother Jones could, I\u2019m sure, find an Irishman who feels that the \u201cFighting Irish\u201d team name reinforces old stereotypes about the Irish people and their supposed proclivity to drunken violence. Will the Fighting Irish and the Celtics have to rid themselves of their branding next? The Minnesota Vikings are named after the Scandinavian warriors of old, who raped and pillaged foreign lands. Should they find a new name, too?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI do not mean to rank the historical suffering of the above groups \u2014 the relative paucity of discrimination historically felt by Scandinavian-Americans is not lost on me \u2014 but only to observe the nuance of history. Most Native peoples underwent horrible ordeals of exclusion, displacement, and genocide in the first few hundred years of the American experiment. Their experience, of course, was not homogeneous; some Choctaw and Chickasaw Indians, for instance, owned slaves years after the conclusion of the Civil War. And while the Irish were not subject to the same genocidal horror as their Native peers, they faced challenges all their own. The historian Arthur D. Schlesinger Sr. once called anti-Catholicism \u201cthe deepest bias in the history of the American people.\u201d Irish Catholics were subject to vicious discrimination upon arriving on American shores. Did they have it worse than American Indians? Taken as a group, probably not. But they still suffered, and there are doubtless Irish Americans living today who could levy the same complaints about the Celtics and Notre Dame that Ryan Helsley did about the Braves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe key point to remember is that most fans \u2014 even, as the case of the Redskins shows, those who are \u201csupposed\u201d to be offended \u2014 don\u2019t associate the Braves or the Celtics or the Vikings or the Fighting Irish with the historical injustices those teams\u2019 names could be said to invoke. They honor the fighting spirit of warriors of all stripes \u2014 Native American, Irish, and Scandinavian alike. That there will always be a few who take offense is not a compelling reason for the Braves or any of those other teams to rebrand. So, please, Atlanta, don\u2019t eliminate the tomahawk, abandon the hashtag, or stifle a time-honored chant that is, by any conceivable standard, benign.
