In fact, it has happened in this administration. As I pointed out less than two years ago, then-Eighth Circuit nominee Steve Grasz endured the same \u201cNot Qualified\u201d rating for supposed \u201cbias and lack of open-mindedness\u201d based on a 1999 law review article about partial-birth abortion that took a position the Supreme Court would ultimately adopt in Gonzales v. Carhart (2007).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ABA has a history of taking liberal positions on issues including abortion, the death penalty, same-sex marriage, affirmative action, and the Second Amendment. The organization\u2019s ideological bias has long tainted its ratings of judicial nominees. An entire book on the subject was written as early as 1965, Joel B. Grossman\u2019s Lawyers and Judges: The ABA and the Politics of Judicial Selection. A 2006 Wall Street Journal editorial condemned the ABA\u2019s \u201clong history of . . . ideological sandbagging.\u201d A 2012 Political Research Quarterly study found \u201cstrong evidence of systematic bias in favor of Democratic nominees.\u201d Senator Ted Cruz pointed out at Wednesday\u2019s hearing that eight of the 15 members of the ABA\u2019s Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, which evaluates nominees, have together contributed at least $60,000 to Democratic candidates and related organizations, and donations to the campaigns of presidential nominees have gone exclusively to Democrats: Five members donated to Barack Obama\u2019s campaign, three to that of Hillary Clinton, and none to the last three Republican nominees.\n\nConsider just a few examples of the ABA giving lower ratings to nominees whose qualifications were extensive:\n\nFour members of the standing committee voted to give Judge Robert Bork a \u201cNot Qualified\u201d rating for the Supreme Court.\n\nThe following conservative nominees received a minority \u201cNot Qualified\u201d rating from the ABA and went on to be among the nation\u2019s most distinguished jurists: Richard A. Posner (7th Cir., nominated 1981) Frank H. Easterbrook (7th Cir., nominated 1984) J. Harvie Wilkinson (4th Cir., nominated 1984) Edith H. Jones (5th Cir., nominated 1985) Alex Kozinski (9th Cir., nominated 1985) Laurence H. Silberman (D.C. Cir., nominated 1985) John T. Noonan (9th Cir., nominated 1985) Stephen F. Williams (D.C. Cir., nominated 1986) Jerry E. Smith (5th Cir., nominated 1987) J. Michael Luttig (4th Cir., nominated 1991) Carlos T. Bea (9th Cir., nominated 2003) William H. Pryor (11th Cir., nominated 2003) Thomas Hardiman (W.D. Pa., nominated 2003)\n\n\n\nAlthough the ABA standing committee purports to give special consideration to females and minorities, a 2014 Journal of Law and Courts study of ABA ratings found that \u201cminority and female nominees are more likely than whites and males to receive lower ratings\u201d and additionally that judges receiving a majority \u201cNot Qualified\u201d rating are no more likely to be reversed than others rated higher. In short, as a predictor of judicial performance, ABA ratings have completely failed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe entire rating process, cloaked in a policy of confidentiality, lacks in transparency what it manifests in bias. In less than three years, the ABA has already rated eight of President Trump\u2019s judicial nominees \u201cNot Qualified,\u201d twice as many as received that rating during President Clinton\u2019s entire eight years in office. In addition to what happened to nominee \u2014 fortunately now Judge \u2014 Steve Grasz, consider two other Trump nominees:\n\nThen Oklahoma District Court nominee Charles Goodwin was rated \u201cNot Qualified,\u201d despite five years of service to that jurisdiction as a magistrate judge (four at the time of nomination) during which he had disposed of civil cases at a substantially higher rate than the national average, issuing approximately 350 opinions and additionally presiding over approximately 500 felony proceedings and disposing of over 1,000 misdemeanor cases. The ABA had the temerity to say the nominee raised \u201cconcerns about the timely and efficient administration of justice.\u201d\n\nThen Eighth Circuit nominee Jonathan Kobes was rated \u201cNot Qualified\u201d despite graduating from Harvard Law School and clerking for the chief judge of the court to which he was nominated, Roger Wollman. He had tried six cases to verdict, which is six more than President Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, Elena Kagan, and his Ninth Circuit nominee, Goodwin Liu, both of whom received unanimous \u201cWell Qualified\u201d ratings. For that matter, Kagan had never argued a case before any court at the time Obama had earlier nominated her to be solicitor general, or when President Clinton nominated her for the D.C. Circuit in 1999. For that earlier judicial nomination, the ABA had rated Kagan \u201cQualified.\u201d\n\nSo Sarah Pitlyk is in good company. A graduate of Yale Law School who had clerked for Brett Kavanaugh on the D.C. Circuit, she has more litigation experience than either Kagan or Liu at the time of their respective circuit court nominations \u2014 or, to take another district court nominee, Alison Nathan, who received an ABA rating of \u201cQualified\u201d after Obama nominated her to the Southern District of New York.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike any other political organization, the ABA has the right to assess judicial nominees and offer its opinion, pro or con. But it has earned no right to a special role in the process, or to have their ratings taken all that seriously.", "description": "The ABA\u2019s ideological bias has long tainted its ratings of judicial nominees.
