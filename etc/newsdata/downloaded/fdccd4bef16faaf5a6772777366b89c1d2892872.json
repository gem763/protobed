His coach, Mario Ledesma, has described Saturday\u2019s pool clash as his country\u2019s World Cup final.\n\nFor England, it has to be just another day at the Tokyo branch office. They must tread an awkward line between matching the intensity born of Argentina\u2019s predicament, and not being drawn into all-out war.\n\nEddie Jones may have used some colourful adjectives to foreshadow the action but the pragmatist in every coach knows today\u2019s bottom line. England have every player fit and a record of nine straight wins against their opponents. This is a stepping stone, no more, for any nation with serious ambitions to win in Japan.\n\nEngland players were put through their paces in training ahead of the Pool C game in Tokyo\n\nArgentina are a step up from any team England have played to here, but inferior to those England hope to face the rest of the way. France are up next, then in all likelihood Australia and, it is to be hoped, New Zealand in the semi-final. Making Argentina an obstacle to be overcome. A big, bruising, lumpy obstacle, yes, but not one that should trouble potential World Cup winners.\n\nArgentina are fighting for their lives because, two games ago, they lost to the first good team they played: France. It was a close match, but not one blessed with enormous quality. Certainly, if England are as ready as Jones insists, there was little to suggest an upset in Tokyo\u2019s western suburbs today.\n\nEngland\u2019s coach, wisely, did not focus on that aspect of what he had seen. Rather, he played up Argentina\u2019s performance in a 23-21 defeat, saying they were the better team and all the statistics confirmed that. The fact remains, however, that Argentina went 20-3 down until an incredible revival and famed French flakiness saw them score 18 points unopposed. Ultimately, however, Camille Lopez won the game with a drop goal that just about crept over. So, yes, it was tight.\n\nEddie Jones's side have got off to a strong start, seeing off Tonga and USA with ease in Japan\n\nYet Argentina have dropped Nicolas Sanchez, top scorer at the 2015 Rugby World Cup, for this match, following a poor display against Tonga. It is the first time he has been excluded from their 23 in three years, and hardly the action of a coach who has been entirely comfortable with what he has seen so far.\n\nUnlike Jones. He knows everything is falling into place for England, who have key players back from injury and no fresh casualties replacing them in the treatment room. The weather aside \u2014 it is predicted to be 33 degrees and humid in the stadium today, for what is a 5pm kick-off local time \u2014 he is aware that the only negative for England might come if they are drawn into an unnatural game, by viewing Argentina\u2019s challenging circumstances as their own.\n\nArgentina must win, and therefore hit an uncommon level of performance to remain live in this World Cup. England must just do their job. \u2018This weekend is our final,\u2019 said Petti. England hope to play a real one, next month.\n\n\u2018My father\u2019s motto was \u201cfight fire with fire\u201d,\u2019 said the comedian, Harry Hill. \u2018That\u2019s probably why they threw him out of the Fire Brigade.\u2019 Equally, fighting fire with fire would be the worst way to go for England. They must match the heightened intensity of Argentina without losing discipline. There can be no citings, no red cards, no unnecessary sideshows. Stick to the gameplan \u2014 England are naturally physical and combatively strong as it is \u2014 and victory can be expected. Surrender that focus and invite a random factor.\n\nJones must ensure his players keep their cool when facing Argentina on Saturday\n\n\u2018You have to be smart about that,\u2019 said Jones. \u2018Rugby is a tough physical game and we have seen already at the World Cup that passion and pride come out in the toughness with which you play.\n\n'But there must also be emotional control. Mentally, we are in a good position and we cannot be seduced by Argentina\u2019s state. They always play with a lot of pride and passion and it will be multiplied by the fact they are in a game that is very important to them. It will be a test of each team\u2019s courage out there.\n\n'When you have passion and pride it tends to multiply your strengths, but also your weaknesses. So we want to multiply our strengths, and attack their weaknesses.\u2019\n\nThe Pumas are in need of a win after losing in a tight contest to France in Pool C\n\nKey to that will be matching Argentina\u2019s scrum, with both sides considering it their weapon. When Jones spoke of brutality and courage it was no doubt the 16-man sumo bout he had in mind. When he reeled off the areas in which Argentina excelled, scrum was his first thought. So England need to place Argentina under pressure in the area they are considered to be strongest; to sap them psychologically with so much at stake.\n\nIt was 2003 when Argentina last went home after the pool stage \u2014 England did so as recently as 2015, although as they were already at home at least they didn\u2019t have far to travel \u2014 so this is a nation that rises to the occasion in tournament conditions. Even so, by their own admission, they are underdogs. A win would constitute one of the greatest results, and one of the greatest comebacks, in Argentine rugby history. For England it represents just another step on the road to Yokohama next month.\n\nIf they can maintain that focus, that certainty of purpose, that sense of brutal detachment, England will win. And if they cannot? Their tournament is going to end sooner, rather than later.", "description": "MARTIN SAMUEL IN TOKYO: 'We go big, or we go home,' said Argentina lock Guido Petti.
