I always remember him telling me that story. She was just so thrilled to get the compliment from her husband.\"\n\nMr Thomas opened his own couture business in Lowndes Street, Belgravia, in 1969 and made many of the Queen's outfits under his own label.\n\n(Image: Tim Graham Photo Library via Get)\n\nHe also made pieces for other royal women, and in 1973 he was awarded a Royal Warrant as dressmaker.\n\nThe Queen is always perfectly dressed and her use of block colours and pretty pattern has worked for decades.\n\nBut not all the royals are quite as successful when it comes to fashion.\n\nDuring the programme the experts discuss Sarah Ferguson, with one person describing her as the \"worst dresser of all time\".\n\nIngrid said: \u201cThe worst dresser of all time was definitely Fergie.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"She looked great in her own clothes, in jeans and t-shirts but she was just a disaster in the fashion of the 80s because it was just too much for her.\n\n\"It was too frilly, there were too many bows. She said so herself.\u201d\n\nHowever Emily Andrews claims that Fergie has got much better as she has got older, and know hows exactly what suits her.\n\nShe said: \"As an older woman now she has got her style absolutely on point.\n\n\"She\u2019s got really good legs, she always wears dresses or pleated skirts, a top and a blazer and she\u2019s got that lovely red hair.\"", "description": "The Queen and Prince Philip have been married for more than 70 years, and she has described him as her \"constant strength and guide\"", "authors": ["Zoe Forsey", "Image", "Wireimage", "Paris Match Via Getty Images", "Tim Graham Photo Library Via Get", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article19111439.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_HRH-Queen-Elizabeth-II-and-Prince-Philip-Vacation-at-Balmoral-August-16-2005.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
