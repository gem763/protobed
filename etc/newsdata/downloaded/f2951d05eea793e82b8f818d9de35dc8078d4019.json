AP Photo/John Bazemore, Pool\n\nIn a 2013 interview with the Washington Post, Jimmy Carter called himself \"extremely lucky\" and credited his active lifestyle and healthy diet to his wife Rosalynn. \"She is a strict dietitian and a very good cook,\" said Carter. \"She makes all our family meals.\"\n\nHe went on to explain that while he can no longer run, he finds other ways to stay active: \"I was an avid runner until I was 80 and my knees gave out,\" Carter said. \"I have two new knees, and those have worked well. Now I swim regularly at home and when I travel. I'm active around the house, and with painting and woodworking.\"\n\nA Washington Post interview done last year noted that the couple walks every day, \"often down Church Street, the main drag through Plains, Georgia, where they have been walking since the 1920s.\"\n\nJimmy and Rosalynn also enjoy riding around on their matching Trikke machines \u2014 a type of three-wheeled scooter the former president says \"gives you a workout all the way from your ankles up to your shoulders\" \u2014 for up to two and a half miles a day.", "description": "Jimmy Carter is turning 95 on October 1 and he shows no signs of stopping.
