The commission has confirmed this because I asked them myself,\" Wits said.\n\n\"The only one who I can imagine they are connected with is Kevin Wakeford (CEO of Armaments Corporation of South Africa). The reason I say that is because on Wednesday, he was granted right to cross-examine Mr Agrizzi.\"\n\nHe said that according to Agrizzi: \"Jared Watson was sitting there in the background when Kevin was there.\"\n\nHe added: \"I've even received an email from the commission last week saying they've received nothing - no documents, no affidavits, nothing.\"\n\nApplications\n\nThis week, Wakeford was granted permission to cross-examine Agrizzi.\n\nWakeford was among those who allegedly benefited from Bosasa, Agrizzi said in his testimony.\n\nWits said some government officials had also applied to cross-examine Agrizzi.\n\nThe commission's acting secretary, KB Shabalala, said the commission was still looking into matters concerning the applications.\n\n\"There may be some applications for leave to cross-examine that were delivered to the commission early this year, which may not yet have been disposed of, but that will be because the commission is still investigating certain issues arising from or connected with either those applications, or with witnesses' responses to those applications.\n\n\"This is because, generally speaking, when the commission has received an application by an implicated person for leave to cross-examine a witness, it provides a copy of that application to the witness and asks the witness to respond or comment.\n\n\"If the witness delivers an affidavit in response, a copy of that affidavit gets sent to the implicated person to consider and, if necessary, deliver a replying affidavit, whereafter the papers are studied to determine what issues, if any, require further investigation before the application may be argued before the chairperson and decided by him,\" Shabalala told News24.\n\nShe added that the commission aimed to, as far as possible, ensure fairness for all parties concerned.\n\nRelations have become strained between the Watson family and Agrizzi since his testimony at the commission.\n\nAfter Watson died in a car crash on the R21 outside OR Tambo International Airport in August, Jared Watson essentially accused Agrizzi of being involved in Watson's \"murder\", according to News24.\n\nNews24 previously reported that Agrizzi had since asked the Sowetan newspaper to retract the story and issue an apology.", "description": "Jared Watson, the nephew of deceased Bosasa boss Gavin Watson, says the family is frustrated because the judicial commission of inquiry into state capture has not yet granted implicated persons permission to cross-examine certain witnesses.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7695/b07b73f8ea84415f8914854687949cae.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
