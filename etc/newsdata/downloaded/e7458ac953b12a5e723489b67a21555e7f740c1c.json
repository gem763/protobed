The Bergamo side remain third, two points behind Juve, with Lazio in sixth place.\n\n\u201cThere was a loss of focus on our part, but it\u2019s hard to neutralise a team like Lazio at home,\u201d said Atalanta coach Gian Piero Gasperini, who was furious with both penalties awarded.\n\n\u201cWith penalties, nobody can understand a thing nowadays.\n\n\u201cImmobile went for a walk, felt someone touch him slightly and dived. I\u2019ve seen it again and it\u2019s obvious to me.\n\n\u201cEven more, on the second penalty, Immobile put his foot in front of De Roon. That\u2019s not a penalty either.\n\n\u201cWe lost the Italian Cup final here (last season) on a similar incident.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Zapata out \u2013\n\nStar Atalanta striker Duvan Zapata was sidelined with an injury suffered on international duty with fellow Colombian Luis Muriel taking his place.\n\nThe forward bagged a first-half double as Lazio struggled initially in a rematch of last season\u2019s Italian Cup final which the Romans won.\n\nMuriel put the visitors ahead on 23 minutes when Robin Gosens played the Colombian in on goal.\n\nHe scored his second five minutes later from a free-kick, with Alejandro Gomez netting the third eight minutes before the break.\n\nBut the visitors lost momentum after the break.\n\nImmobile got one back from the spot after being brought down by Jose Luis Palomino and then combined with Correa for their second.\n\nImmobile earned a late penalty after a Marten de Roon foul, celebrating wildly after converting to grab a dramatic point before Lazio\u2019s Europa League trip to Celtic next week.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m losing years of my life kicking penalties in the 90th minute,\u201d said 29-year-old Immobile, after scoring his third league goal from the spot this season.\n\n\u201cThis result gives us confidence because coming back from three goals down gives an extra boost.\u201d\n\nPolish striker Milik scored in either half as Napoli got back to winning ways at the Stadio San Paolo with a 2-0 victory, after a goalless draw at Torino before the international break, to stay fourth, one point behind Atalanta, before their Champions League trip to Salzburg.\n\nThe Serie A runners-up could thank goalkeeper Alex Meret early on for a triple save to deny Verona\u2019s Darko Lazovic, Matteo Pessina and Mattia Zaccagni after quarter of an hour.\n\nThe breakthrough came eight minutes before the break with Milik finishing off a Fabian Ruiz cross for his first goal of the season.\n\nAnd the Polish international got the second when he got his foot to a Lorenzo Insigne free-kick on 67 minutes.\n\nVerona drop to 13th place after their third loss of the season.", "description": "Milan (AFP) \u2013 Serie A leading scorer Ciro Immobile\u2019s late brace of penalties helped Lazio wipe out a three-goal deficit in a thrilling 3-3", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/e341a4_napoli-polish-arkadiusz-milik-scored-his-goals-season-immobile-seals-thrilling-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
