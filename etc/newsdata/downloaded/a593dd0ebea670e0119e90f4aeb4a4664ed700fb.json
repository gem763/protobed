Here\u2019s how his plan would work.", "language": "en", "text": "He says his long-shot plan \u2014 it lacks the support of key players \u2014 would grant disenfranchised Washington the voting representation in Congress that residents long for.\n\nWhile the capital is his principal concern, Krucoff says his proposal would represent a big win for Maryland. He likens the acquisition of most of Washington and its 700,000 residents to Maryland being selected for an Amazon headquarters. (Maryland\u2019s bid for the online giant didn\u2019t make it to the final round in 2018.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWashington has \u201cgot a huge economy, we\u2019re really well off, we\u2019re a beautiful place with tons and tons of culture,\u201d said Krucoff, naming Rock Creek Park, Washington National Cathedral, theaters, restaurants, universities and other attractions.\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re also of a political like mind, for the most part\u201d with Maryland, he said, in that Democrats heavily outnumber Republicans in the District, just as they do in Maryland.\n\nKrucoff, 52, is hoping to tap into Washington\u2019s zeal for voting rights. He filed Tuesday to run as an independent for the District\u2019s nonvoting seat in the House. And he said his No. 1 campaign issue is getting current Washington residents full representation in Congress, using the Douglass County, Maryland, plan.\n\nAD\n\nThe District\u2019s latest effort in the direction of full representation was displayed Thursday during a packed House Oversight and Reform Committee hearing on Democratic Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton\u2019s bill to make Washington the nation\u2019s 51st state. Her bill would create a new \u201cState of Washington, Douglass Commonwealth.\u201d Like Krucoff\u2019s proposal, the new entity would honor Frederick Douglass. He was born a slave in Maryland, escaped to freedom and became an abolitionist and newspaper publisher in Washington and New York.\n\nAD\n\nEither proposal would carve out a section of Washington \u2014 essentially where the monuments and the Mall are \u2014 to remain under federal control as \u201cthe seat of the government of the United States\u201d as directed in the U.S. Constitution.\n\nKrucoff does not oppose the statehood push, saying \u201c51st statehood is much, much better for us than the status quo.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut, Krucoff said, it\u2019s politically simpler for Washington to share in Maryland\u2019s representation than to create a new state with two new U.S. senators. District voters would likely elect two Democrats to the Senate, a nonstarter for the Republican Party.\n\n\u201cI would argue [statehood] has not succeeded,\u201d he said.\n\nKrucoff attended Thursday\u2019s hearing wearing a light purple dress shirt he said symbolizes his efforts to unite blue Democrats and red Republicans around a common theme: representation for all.\n\nAD\n\nNorton\u2019s legislation has 220 co-sponsors \u2014 more than half the House. They include every Maryland congressman except Rep. Andy Harris, the delegation\u2019s only Republican.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI have said around the country that one of the greatest blots on our democracy is having 700,000 of our citizens unable to be fully represented in the Congress of the United States,\u201d House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer, the Southern Maryland Democrat, said in a statement submitted at the hearing.\n\nIn the Senate \u2014 where the Republican leadership is unlikely to consider Norton\u2019s bill \u2014 Democratic Maryland Sens. Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen are co-sponsors of the statehood bill.\n\nIn fact, no lawmaker has come out publicly for Krucoff\u2019s plan, which would require approval in Congress and in Maryland. Based on precedent, Krucoff believes his proposal would need the approval of the General Assembly and of Maryland voters in a statewide referendum.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNorton declined to comment on Krucoff\u2019s proposal, which is formally called \u201cretrocession\u201d because it involves returning a territory to a governmental entity. Maryland gave land on its southern border to create the District.\n\n\u201cRetrocession has no constituency in Maryland or the District,\u201d she wrote earlier this year in a letter to The Washington Post.\n\nKrucoff filed with the Federal Election Commission to run against Norton. He will need to collect 3,000 signatures following the Washington primary in June to get on the ballot.\n\nKrucoff notes the 23rd Amendment specifies how the District participates in the electoral college vote for president, giving Washington three electors. But he said the amendment language may offer flexibility not to have the electors. Alternatively, he said: \u201cIf no one lives in the area, then there is no one to elect the electors in the first place.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKrucoff said he advised Maryland Republican Gov. Larry Hogan of his plan at a reception during a 2018 convention, saying: \u201cI\u2019d like you to think about creating Douglass County, Maryland.\u201d The governor smiled and nodded, Krucoff said. Hogan\u2019s office had no comment on the meeting, a spokesman said last week.\n\nVariations of Krucoff\u2019s proposal have a long history.\n\nVirginia, as well as Maryland, donated land along the banks of the Potomac for the federal capital in the 1780s. By 1846, residents of Alexandria had grown irritated over being disfranchised, and political control of that area returned to Virginia. Residents on the other side of the Potomac River, in what had once been Maryland, remained under federal jurisdiction.\n\nAD\n\nIn the 1990s, Republicans talked about returning to Maryland most of the district, except for an area that includes Capitol Hill, the White House, the monuments and the federal agencies. And in 1992, the late Maryland Gov. William Donald Schaefer, a Democrat, said he would welcome the District back to the state. But few in Maryland or the District seemed interested.\n\nDistrict politicians \u2014 then and now \u2014 overwhelmingly support statehood.\n\nAnd so for now, Douglass County remains as mythical as Narnia or Middle-earth.\n\nKrucoff is undeterred.\n\n\u201cThis is a long campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there will be movement toward this in due course.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Baltimore Sun\n\nAD", "description": "David Krucoff\u2019s long-shot vision would grant disenfranchised Washington the voting representation in Congress that residents long for.", "authors": ["Jeff Barker"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/RUq_WfuHE-aF-79sYycSfPd_T64=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MLPMH4HBGMI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
