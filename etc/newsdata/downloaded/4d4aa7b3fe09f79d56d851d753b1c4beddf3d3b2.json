Secureworks said the group recently registered at least 20 new website addresses to use in phishing campaigns targeting 60 universities in the U.S., Australia, U.K., Canada, Hong Kong and Switzerland.\n\nThe latest campaign is similar to efforts mounted last summer by the same group, Secureworks reported: hackers compromise university resources and then leverage that access to send legitimately looking \u201clibrary-themed\u201d phishing emails to targets with the aim of stealing their user credentials.\n\nThe emails contain links to websites under the hacking group\u2019s control that have been spoofed to resemble the actual login pages for services associated with the targeted universities, Secureworks reported. Recipients who visit the bogus sites and subsequently input their credentials thus provide their passwords to the hacking group, effectively putting their data at risk of being pilfered.\n\n\u201cThis campaign is aimed at accessing academic research that can be applied for economic and other benefits, and is a direct response to sanctions and an exodus of academic talent from Iran to countries where they are able to participate in and benefit from open and collaborative academic research,\u201d Allison Wikoff, a senior security researcher at Secureworks, told ZDNet.\n\nSecureworks has released a list of the web addresses associated with the campaign, to \u201cprovide broader awareness of the threat group\u2019s campaigns and curtail its activities,\u201d but cautioned that some remain in use and may contain malicious content.\n\nThe same campaign has targeted a total of at least 380 universities in over 30 countries since first being discovered, the company reported.\n\n\u201cMany universities have been targeted multiple times. The threat actors have not changed their operations despite law enforcement activity, multiple public disclosures and takedown activity,\u201d Secureworks said in a blog post reporting its findings.\n\nThe Justice Department declined to comment\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
