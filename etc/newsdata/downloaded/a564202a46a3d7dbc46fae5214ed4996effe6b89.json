Scary and thrilling, of course; they\u2019re filled with dead people! But also oases of calm, respectful silence, often deserted, except on Sunday mornings. It\u2019s little surprise that they have fascinated writers and provided settings for a multitude of books.\n\nI grew up in a town bordered by three large municipal cemeteries and took bits of all of them for the graveyard that is the main setting for my novel Things Can Only Get Better. It\u2019s set in 1996, when Arthur, who is in his 70s, is so grief-stricken by the death of his wife Molly that he refuses to leave her graveside, eventually moving into and fixing up a derelict chapel and becoming a sort of unofficial caretaker.\n\nLike the necropolises of my youth, Arthur\u2019s graveyard is a magnet for local children, specifically a group of girls with no hope or ambition, and nothing expected of them other than to leave school and get pregnant.\n\nEspecially when the cemeteries are surrounded by closely packed housing estates and edged with busy roads, stepping through their gates is like entering a borderland between worlds, neither this life nor the next.\n\nHere are some of my favourite books exploring this liminal territory.\n\n1. The Graveyard Book by Neil Gaiman\n\nIt stands to reason, for those of a certain bent, that cemeteries, being the resting places of the dead, will be home to ghosts. The spirits who haunt Neil Gaiman\u2019s 2008 children\u2019s book are benign, taking in and looking after Nobody \u201cBod\u201d Owens, the only survivor of his family\u2019s massacre at the hands of a serial killer called Jack. There are supernatural menaces to be overcome, but ultimately the real evil is done by the living.\n\n2. Pet Sematary by Stephen King\n\nGraveyards are fertile ground for horror, usually through their desecration or disrespectful treatment. King\u2019s 1983 take on the undead genre sees a family buying a remote house with its own pet burial ground that does a nicely creepy line in bringing family pets \u2013 and people \u2013 back to life, but horribly changed. Which, presumably, they never mentioned at Purple Bricks.\n\n3. A Fine and Private Place by Peter S Beagle\n\nMore haunting than haunted, Beagle\u2019s moving 1960 fantasy novel follows Jonathan Rebeck, a former pharmacist who has dropped out of ordinary life and lives, penniless and homeless, in the fictional Yorkchester cemetery, where a friendly raven supplies him with food stolen from picnic baskets. Able to speak with the dead, Rebeck plays matchmaker between the ghosts of a young teacher and a bookshop worker, then has to fight to keep their spirits together when the threat arises that one of their bodies will be moved.\n\n4. Lincoln in the Bardo by George Saunders\n\nHere the spirits of the dead inhabit the \u201cbardo\u201d of the title, a sort of halfway house between death and resurrection based on the Tibetan notion of rebirth, which is tethered to Oak Hill Cemetery. This houses the crypt of Willie, son of Abraham Lincoln who has died aged 11. The US president\u2019s grief threatens to keep his son in the limbo of the cemetery for ever. Unlike the first three books, which are resoundingly \u201cgenre\u201d, Saunders\u2019 novel won the 2017 Booker prize so is devoutly \u201cliterary\u201d. However, it\u2019s so good we won\u2019t hold that against it.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Misnomered \u2026 the Merry cemetery in S\u0103p\u00e2n\u021ba, Romania. Photograph: Bogdan Cristel/Reuters\n\n5. Death: A Graveside Companion by Joanna Ebenstein\n\nA wonderful rough guide to death, to help us navigate that awfully big adventure. Through a series of essays by different writers, the cultural attitudes to death across the world are examined, and there are a wealth of illustrations of artefacts from prehistoric to modern times.\n\n6. The Shadow of the Wind by Carlos Ruiz Zaf\u00f3n\n\nIt isn\u2019t only people that go to cemeteries to moulder and eventually be forgotten. It\u2019s books, too, as suggested in Ruiz Zaf\u00f3n\u2019s bestseller. In the aftermath of the Spanish civil war, a young boy is inducted into the secrets of the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, where the memories of abandoned, lost narratives are carefully curated. A cemetery in abstract terms, perhaps, but with some correlation with traditional graveyards, where the etched words on gravestones prevent the names of the dead from slipping from the world entirely.\n\n7. Falling Angels by Tracy Chevalier\n\nThe follow-up to Chevalier\u2019s breakout novel, Girl With a Pearl Earring, Falling Angels immerses itself in the Victorian obsession with death and taste for grand necropolises. It follows the fortunes of two families bound together by the friendship between the daughters of the houses. The girls have their own obsession with the local graveyard that houses the two families\u2019 adjacent plots. As the Victorian era gives way to the Edwardian, and a new world in a new century, sexual mores are challenged and the certainties of life and death, as reflected in the grand London graveyard, are upended.\n\n8. 199 Cemeteries to See Before You Die by Loren Rhoads\n\nWhereas the Ebenstein book is a meditation on death, this is more a road map to some of the best graveyards around the world. From the southern gothic of Savannah\u2019s Bonaventure cemetery to the celebrity-stuffed P\u00e8re Lachaise in Paris, Rhoads takes you on a world tour of final resting places, introduces you to their most famous residents, and offers a wealth of enticing history and sharp details, such as the brightly coloured, hand-carved wooden gravestones in Romania\u2019s surely somewhat misnomered Merry cemetery.\n\nWill my cat eat my eyeballs? How Caitlin Doughty teaches kids about death Read more\n\n9. Fun Home by Alison Bechdel\n\nBetween us shuffling off this mortal coil and being buried, cremated or otherwise laid to rest, there is the business of preparation and funerals, brilliantly depicted in Bechdel\u2019s bestselling 2006 graphic novel. The story details her own upbringing with her rather tyrannical father, a third-generation funeral director. The non-linear narrative entwines the business of death with both Bechdel and her father\u2019s personal journeys with their sexualities, and the aftermath of his death.\n\n10. Her Fearful Symmetry by Audrey Niffenegger\n\nAs part of her research for this 2009 novel, Niffenegger, author of The Time Traveler\u2019s Wife, took a job as a tour guide at London\u2019s Highgate cemetery. That\u2019s the job she gives to Robert, who is the lover of first Elspeth, who dies of leukaemia, and Valentina, who is the daughter of Elspeth\u2019s twin sister and who is herself half of a set of identical twins, with Julia. Like the more remote corners of your favourite graveyard, it\u2019s a tangled plot, but a beautiful one.\n\n\u2022 Things Can Only Get Better by David M Barnett is published by Trapeze Books (\u00a38.99) on 14 November.", "description": "Perfect sites for Halloween stories, cemeteries have also provided fine settings for Neil Gaiman, Stephen King and many more", "authors": ["David Barnett"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/709aafad34bdfffa3bee93f147d841cd8e3f0d2e/0_221_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=62b8257b0170b959f90e6c96b27b805a", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
