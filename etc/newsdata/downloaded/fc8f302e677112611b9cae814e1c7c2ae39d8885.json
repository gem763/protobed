Rose's fellow Briton Paul Casey was one of the few players to publicly turn down an opportunity to play in the event.\n\nAt the time he told reporters: \"There were a lot of questions. Do I want to go to Saudi? That was the main question. There are a lot of places in the world that I have played and continue to go to which you could question....some human rights violations that governments have committed...I thought I'd sit this one out.\"\n\nAn proposed exhibition tennis match between Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal was scheduled for last December but later canceled because of injury to the Spaniard.\n\nKhan defends Jeddah boxing bout\n\nAlso in January, Juventus beat AC Milan 1-0 in the Italian Super Cup in Jeddah, the same city which played host to British boxer Amir Khan's lucrative fight against Billy Dib.\n\nKhan was forced to defend his decision to fight in Saudi Arabia for a reported $8.5 million after Amnesty International described the kingdom's human rights record as \"abysmal,\" while warning of the ruling party overseeing a \"sweeping crackdown against its critics.\"\n\nThe British fighter told reporters: \"Maybe now they are changing to make it that new place where people can enjoy themselves and it's fair for women.

They're creating the idea that Saudi Arabia is not dissimilar to the UAE.\"\n\nThe announcement of the world's newest and richest race comes just 10 months after the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, with a United Nations report claiming there was \"sufficient credible evidence\" that the crown prince bore responsibility for the killing\n\nThe Washington Post columnist died after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2018 with Saudi officials -- after initial denials -- claiming it was the work of rogue operators.\n\nAsked whether the sporting push was a reaction to the Khashoggi murder and a need for a better global image, Coogle added: \"It's hard to show causality on that as Saudi Arabia was doing that before Khashoggi. With the negative attention around his killing, the only way to tackle that is to do bigger and bolder events with big reforms. They were doing stuff like this before but it's possible that sped it up.\"", "description": "Saudi Arabia is to stage the richest horse race in history next year with a $20 million prize pot up for grabs in the latest venture to attract world-class sporting events to the nation.", "authors": ["Matt Majendie", "For Cnn"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190809114807-saudi-arabia-horse-racing-richest-race-super-tease.jpg"}
