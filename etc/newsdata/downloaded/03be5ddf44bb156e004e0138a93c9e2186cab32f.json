And he also appears to have squared off the Democratic Unionist party after a series of intensive behind-the-scenes negotiations.\n\nThe domestic reception really matters, because whatever they think of the details, there is little incentive for the EU27 to engage unless they believe Johnson could secure a majority in parliament, as May failed three times to do.\n\nIs this all a charade? Does Johnson really want a deal?\n\nHe does want a deal \u2013 as does his key aide Dominic Cummings, despite his reputation as a master of chaos. It is the cleanest route out of the bind the prime minister has found himself in, with the Benn Act making a no-deal Brexit much more difficult and Labour refusing to support a general election.\n\nIf he could get a deal through parliament by 19 October it would release him from the obligations of the Benn law and he could fight an election as the man who \u201cgot Brexit done\u201d against all the odds.\n\nBut the Vote Leave crew who are driving the Brexit bus in Downing Street have long had clear red lines for a deal, albeit different ones to May\u2019s.\n\nJohnson believes keeping the UK in the EU customs union indefinitely would prevent the UK from launching off into the buccaneering, free-trading future he likes to envisage. Ultimately, that was always going to have to mean customs checks of some kind, somewhere on the island of Ireland.\n\nIn return, he (and crucially the DUP) appears to have conceded that Northern Ireland will stick with EU rules on manufacturing and farm goods for at least four years, implying a border in the Irish Sea.\n\nQuick guide Why is the Irish border a stumbling block for Brexit? Show Hide Counties and customs Inside the EU, both Ireland and Northern Ireland are part of the single market and customs union so share the same regulations and standards, allowing a soft or invisible border between the two.\n\nBritain\u2019s exit from the EU \u2013 taking Northern Ireland with it \u2013 risks a return to a hard or policed border. The only way to avoid this post-Brexit is for regulations on both sides to remain more or less the same in key areas including food, animal welfare, medicines and product safety. The 'backstop' in Theresa May's Withdrawal Agreement was intended to address this - stating that if no future trade agreement could be reached between the EU and the UK, then rules and regulations would stay as they are. This has been rejected by Brexit supporters as a 'trap' to keep the UK in the EU's customs union, which would prevent the UK striking its own independent trade deals. There are an estimated 72m road vehicle crossings a year between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and about 14% of those crossings are consignments of goods, some of which may cross the border several times before they reach a consumer. Brexit supporters say this can be managed by doing checks on goods away from the border, but critics say it will be difficult to police this without any physical infrastructure like border posts of cameras, which could raise tensions in the divided communities of Ireland.

But No 10 is feeling considerably less confident about winning court battles, after the supreme court ruled the suspension of parliament was unlawful \u2013 so there has been a growing sense that a delay would in the end be inevitable if no deal was forthcoming.\n\nHowever, Johnson\u2019s colleagues believe breaking his \u201cdo or die\u201d pledge to leave on 31 October would be less fatal than they feared, because voters are increasingly seeing the PM as the man battling to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d in the face of resistance.\n\nThey believe Lady Hale and her spider brooch, and the furore over Johnson\u2019s endless use of the phrase \u201csurrender bill\u201d, only help to cement that impression in the public\u2019s mind.\n\nSo if there is no deal are we heading for a \u2018people v parliament\u2019 general election?\n\nYes and no: Johnson would certainly fight that election on a platform of getting on with Brexit in the face of resistance from \u201cremoaners\u201d, those Priti Patel called the \u201cnorth London metropolitan liberal elite\u201d.\n\nHe could either go full throttle with a no-deal platform, in the hope of neutralising the Brexit party, or hold out the prospect of a deal if the electorate gave him a fresh mandate (though that did not go well for May).\n\nBut with the public sick and tired of hearing about Brexit, the Conservatives know they also need to talk about domestic policy. And they emerge from this party conference having staked out a clear patch of populist territory \u2013 anti-establishment, pro-public services, rightwing on crime.", "description": "A deal is preferred option but if EU rejects offer then it is full steam ahead towards no deal", "authors": ["Heather Stewart"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/574065ea9f9c557a66febcb9fefb16b4f3aaf429/0_205_5873_3524/master/5873.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=225f37e3b563f361038cd94842ac6c42"}
