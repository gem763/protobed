There is a need for price consolidation before gold prices pick up.\"\n\nSpot gold was barely changed at $1,494.05 per ounce as of 0400 GMT, after a 0.6% drop on Wednesday. However, U.S. gold futures were down 1% at $1,501.40 per ounce.\n\nCentral banks globally are facing increasing pressure to dole out monetary support for flagging economies as the U.S.-China trade dispute hits global economic growth.\n\nLower interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding gold, and weighs on the dollar.\n\n\"Gold looks vulnerable. If the Fed is right to proceed with caution \u2014 meaning the global environment is not as dire as stimulus-hungry markets seem to envision \u2014 that implies less scope for overall easing,\" said Ilya Spivak, a senior currency strategist at DailyFx.\n\nA close below $1,480 would set the stage for a retest of the $1,400 level initially and may then pave the way for a deeper pullback, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bank of Japan kept monetary policy steady but said it would re-examine economic and price developments more thoroughly at its next policy meeting, amid growing risks to the country's fragile economic recovery.\n\nSpot gold is poised to break a support at $1,488 per ounce and fall to the next support at $1,446, according to Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao.\n\nAmong other precious metals, silver dropped 0.3% to $17.68 per ounce, and platinum slipped 0.2% to $928.73.
