Both courtesy of Blanton Museum of Art, The University of Texas at Austin, Gift of Gilberto C\u00e1rdenas, 2017.\n\nThe Latinx poster art of 70s LA was incredibly diverse, often inspired by the Chicano civil rights movement and ancient art from the Americas. One woman who kickstarted the movement is Sister Karen Boccalero, a nun and artist who had a dream of creating a community arts institution for Latinx art. In 1972, she founded Self Help Graphics, a graphic arts studio in East LA, which has been bringing a DIY ethos to poster art for over 40 years.\n\n\n\nNow, some of the studio\u2019s most iconic works are going on view as part of Arte Sin Fronteras: Prints from the Self Help Graphics Studio, a group exhibition opening October 27 at the Blanton Museum of Art in Austin. The artworks challenge traditional gender roles, give a voice to Chicanx and Latinx queer identities, and visualize migration and life at the US Mexico border.\n\nThough most of the works are from the 1980s and 1990s, Self Help Graphics has worked with Latinx artists for 40 years, through artist residencies, teaching and training opportunities, and outreach to the community. The studio helped promote the voices of its artists during the Chicano civil rights movements in the 1970s, but it also connected the diaspora with their cultural roots. This wasn\u2019t just through prints the studio has also created historic murals in the neighborhoods of east LA, and commissioned avant-garde performances by local artists.\n\nCoinciding with Hispanic Heritage Month, the exhibition features over 70 works created between 1978 and 1997, drawn from a gift of around 350 prints given to the museum by Dr. Gilberto C\u00e1rdenas. These prints are what the museum\u2019s director Simone Wicha calls \u201cvibrant expressions of Latinx identity at a critical moment in history.\u201d Here, co-curators Florencia Bazzano and Christian Wurst walk us through six key pieces in the exhibition.\n\nYreina D. Cerv\u00e1ntez, Danza Ocelotl, 1983, screenprint with glitter, 35 1/6 x 23 1/16 in., Blanton Museum of Art, The University of Texas at Austin, Gift of Gilberto C\u00e1rdenas, 2017.\n\nDanza Ocelotl by Yreina D. Cerv\u00e1ntez, 1983\n\n\u201cThis work is a great example of how the studio has given a voice to the artists in the community. It was part of the first atelier in 1983. Cerv\u00e1ntez is an artist who worked at Self Help Graphics and the Barrio Mobile Art Studio for many years and now is a professor at UC Santa Cruz. The program provided a collaborative community and training in printmaking that helped her shape her style. She has also participated in several Ateliers since then.\n\nBarrio Flag by Manuel Cruz.\n\nBarrio Flag by Manuel Cruz\n\n\u201cCruz was a well-known muralist in Los Angeles. Barrio Flag is after a now-lost mural he painted in East LA back in 1993, as Self Help gave him the opportunity to make works that could disseminate to a wide audience, and not be subjected the whims of building owners and land developers.\u201d\n\nRoberto Guti\u00e9rrez, Cesar E. Chavez Avenida, 1994, screenprint, 23 15/16 x 26 1/8 in., Blanton Museum of Art, The University of Texas at Austin, Gift of Gilberto C\u00e1rdenas, 2017.\n\nCesar E. Chavez Avenida by Robert Guti\u00e9rrez, 1994\n\n\u201cIn this piece, the artist is commemorating the change of the neighborhood\u2019s main avenue from \u2018Brooklyn\u2019 to \u2018Cesar E. Chavez\u2019 Avenue in 1994. During the 1960s, this part of the city transformed from a predominantly Jewish to a Mexican American community and Cesar E. Chavez was a prominent Chicano civil rights leader. In the 1960s, co-founding what is now the United Farm Workers with Dolores Huerta, also, Self Help Graphics had its studio on that street.\u201d\n\nJos\u00e9 Alpuche, El Espiritu Azteca, 1995, screenprint, 26 x 20 in., Blanton Museum of Art, The University of Texas at Austin, Gift of Gilberto C\u00e1rdenas, 2019.\n\nEl Espiritu Azteca by Jos\u00e9 Alpuche, 1995\n\n\"El Espiritu Azteca is a perfect example of how Chicanx artists are inspired by Mesoamerican myths and histories. These pre-Hispanic traditions evinced a sense of pride in the achievements made by the artists\u2019 ethnic and cultural forebears. The Aztec figure depicted in this print represents a warrior and archer sometimes identified by the name Ilhuicamina. In one ancient Mesoamerican myth, the warrior was challenged to shoot the sun with an arrow to win the hand of his beloved thus creating the sunset. Alpuche also references the work of Jes\u00fas Helguera, an academic painter who illustrated inexpensive Mexican calendars, helping disseminate ancient myths and folkloric scenes among Mexican Americans.\u201d\n\nPatssi Valdez, L.A./T.J. 1987, screenprint, 26 3/16 x 19 15/16 in., Blanton Museum of Art, The University of Texas at Austin, Gift of Gilberto C\u00e1rdenas, 2017.\n\nL.A./T.J. by Patssi Valdez, 1987\n\n\u201cPatssi Valdez\u2019s print is referencing two cities closely tied to her identity\u2014Los Angeles and Tijuana. A photographic portrait of the artist is split in two hovers over the cityscape. As an American-born citizen with Mexican ancestry, she is constantly pulled towards the border.\u201d\n\nTeddy Sandoval, Angel Baby, 1995, screenprint, 44 x 30 in., Blanton Museum of Art, The University of Texas at Austin, Gift of Gilberto C\u00e1rdenas, 2017.\n\nAngel Baby by Teddy Sandoval, 1995\n\n\u201cTeddy Sandoval was a gay Latino artist working in Los Angeles. He employed symbols from his Chicano background to address issues of sexual and ethnic identity. He\u2019s also confronting issues that were affecting his community like the AIDS crisis. In Angel Baby, Sandoval presents a boxer as a guardian angel meant to protect against violence, AIDS, war and discrimination of all kinds.\u201d\n\nArte Sin Fronteras: Prints from the Self Help Graphics Studio runs until January 12 at the Blanton Museum of Art in Austin, Texas.", "description": "A new show explores the work that came out of East LA's Self Help Graphics Studio.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5daf45c6c80f3b000a3010fc/lede/1571772962812-arte-sin-fronteras.jpeg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
