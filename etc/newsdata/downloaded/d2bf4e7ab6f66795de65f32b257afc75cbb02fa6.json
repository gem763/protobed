And I think the more we talk about it in society, the more we can destigmatize this serious disease.\u201d\n\nLater in the segment, after he broke down the president\u2019s other \u201cbeef\u201d with the Taliban, the Noah said it\u2019s \u201cpossible that the war in Afghanistan will continue now because Trump has put a photo opportunity above peace, which according to WebMD is a classic symptom of a pussy ass bitch.\u201d", "description": "Teigen\u2019s response to the president calling her a \u201cfilthy mouthed wife\u201d was \u201ctoo vulgar\u201d for most TV news broadcast, but \u201cluckily, we\u2019re not the news,\u201d the host said Monday night.", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1438,w_2556,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568082064/TN_byg6ja", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
