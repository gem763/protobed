And I am a Christian who cares for the Earth as God\u2019s Creation; and for the world\u2019s poorest peoples whose experience of injustice draws a special love from God.\n\n(Image: SWNS)\n\n(Image: Dan Kitwood)\n\n\u201cI come to the Treasury to challenge these practices and to demand radical change in them. In particular the proposal of the Climate Change Committee that UKEF works towards zero emissions by 2050 is far too late.\n\n\"Greta Thunberg stated to the United Nations on 23rd September that the CO2 budget for giving a 67% chance of staying within 1.5 degrees C will be entirely gone by 2028 at current emissions levels.\u201d\n\nAs well as their emission centered demands, Extinction Rebellion are calling on the Government declare a climate and ecological emergency.\n\nThey also want to see the Government create and be led by the decisions of a Citizens' Assembly on climate and ecological justice.", "description": "At open ceremony attended by 1,000 people the climate change activists told of plans to force the Government to act with their demonstrations", "authors": ["Milo Boyd", "Image", "Pa", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Reuters", "Swns", "Dan Kitwood"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20527202.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Extinction-Rebellion-protests.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
