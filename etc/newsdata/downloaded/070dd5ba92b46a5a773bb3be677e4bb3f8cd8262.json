Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) \u2015 and she thinks she might get fired if she steps another toe out of line.\n\nDuring a break in a radio interview on \u201cAmerica First With Sebastian Gorka\u201d on Tuesday night, Pirro \u2015 who had ostensibly not understood that they were still live on YouTube \u2015 made a number of grievances about Fox News to show host Gorka, a former aide to President Donald Trump.\n\nShe also had a beef about the network\u2019s restrictions on her, complaining that she\u2019d need to \u201csee if they\u2019d let me\u201d when asked if she\u2019d join Gorka for a live studio interview.\n\n\u201cYou know Fox reviews everything. They\u2019re unbelievable,\u201d she said.\n\nShe went on to vent about restrictions on her new book, saying, \u201cThey\u2019re still saying you cannot do Bill O\u2019Reilly, you cannot do Newsmax.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know what? They suspended me. And I\u2019m not going to get fired. You know I\u2019m worried that that suspension was the basis to tee up for anything I do wrong, they\u2019ll fire me,\u201d she added, before she was interrupted by Gorka telling her to stand by. \u201cWe are back in 90 seconds,\u201d he said.\n\nPirro\u2019s program disappeared from the Fox News lineup in March following her accusation that the hijab worn by Omar, who is Muslim, may be \u201cantithetical to the Constitution.\u201d Her comments were condemned by the network. Neither Pirro nor the network ever publicly confirmed the suspension, and there was no mention of the controversy when Pirro returned two weeks later.\n\nFox News did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding Pirro\u2019s Tuesday night interview.\n\nThe radio version of the interview, excluding Pirro\u2019s revelations, was uploaded to Gorka\u2019s YouTube channel.", "description": "The Fox News host also aired concerns she may be fired if she does anything else wrong.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6f2a03240000fd0c733b45.jpeg?cache=wtb0t8aktw&ops=1778_1000"}
