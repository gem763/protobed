They are going to be calling the shots, which is extremely concerning.\n\n\u2018They just don\u2019t have much in the way of workers\u2019 rights it \u2018s just not in the American vocabulary particularly \u2013 they don\u2019t have holidays they don\u2019t have maternity leave\u2019.\n\nThe report by the Socialists and Democrats European group says the scrapping of labour laws coupled with pressure to loosen up the economy for a trade deal could see the widening of the UK\u2019s gender pay gap widen \u2013 despite it already being the fourth worst in the EU.\n\nIf Brexit goes badly, the economic fallout could see more and more women taking on the role of unpaid carers as public services are put under pressure.\n\nThis could see the country\u2019s gender pension gap widen beyond the current 40 per cent, according to the publication set to be presented at London\u2019s Europe house tomorrow.\n\nFormer MEP Mary Honeyball says austerity is likely to get \u2018much worse\u2019 after Brexit (Picture: WENN.com)\n\nIt says women are \u2018not on the agenda of Brexit\u2019 and that gender equality was not mentioned once in the Withdrawal Act 2018.\n\nThe report adds: \u2018Throughout the past three years, there has been little to no Government attention or action in response to the mounting evidence that women will be the ones to bear the brunt of Brexit, from their rights and prosperity to the slowing progress of gender equality.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the findings, the Prime Minister has refused to rule out scrapping the EU\u2019s Pregnant Workers\u2019 Directive, which entitles UK women to pre-birth appointments, maternity leave and protection against replacement and discrimination.\n\nWomen in the UK are also expected to lose out on upcoming EU protections including 40 per cent gender quotas on company boards and the Work-Life Balance Directive, which helps parents share the burden of childcare.\n\nMs Honeyball has little faith in Boris Johnson reinstating the same standards once the country begins life outside the EU.\n\nShe said: \u2018He\u2019s done away with the level playing field. Theresa May\u2019s agreement, for all its faults, did say the UK would be told there would be a level playing field on these issues.\u2019\n\nThe report says women in the UK make up three-in-four of the UK\u2019s part-time workers, partly due to childcare responsibilities.\n\nIt says they are at a highest risk of an \u2018erorison of rights\u2019 currently protected by the EU\u2019s Agency and Part Time Workers directives, which are not guaranteed to be replaced.\n\nMs Honeyball added: \u2018I think always you need a lot of pressure to get governments to legislate on women\u2019s rights, it never just happens, and if you take away the European Union and you have a right-wing government it\u2019s going to be very hard to make happen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It\u2019s going to be heard to make happen with a left-wing government too.\u2019\n\nAs the majority of public service users, recipients of benefits, public sector workers and unpaid carers, the report says women will be hit the hardest by post-Brexit austerity.\n\nMs Honeyball added: \u2018I do honestly think resources will be tight for everything.\n\n\u2018Women wont get pay rises, there wont be any increases in maternity leave or any protection at work.\n\nThey are also expected to be impacted more by sudden price hikes for household goods, as the main \u2018shock absorbers\u2019 of family poverty.\u2019\n\n\u2018Life changing and life saving\u2019 services for women are expected to lose out on funding at a time when \u2018rates of female-targeted violence in the UK are among the worst in Europe and violence against women is on the rise\u2019.\n\nThe Black, Asian, Minority Ethnic and disabled women will be disproportionately affected by cuts services, according to the report.\n\nMs Honeyball added: \u2018If you think austerity is bad now, it will get much worse.\u2019\n\nThe Department for Exiting the European Union has been approached for comment.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
