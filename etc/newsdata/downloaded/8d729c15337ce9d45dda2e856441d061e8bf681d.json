Why? Because the last 7 recessions were all preceded by an inverted yield curve. The yield curve we are referencing is the difference between the yield and the yield.\n\nIndeed, toward the end of August this yield curve did go briefly into negative territory for a few days. Does that mean a recession is ahead? Only time will tell. However, looking at today, we put in a bullish engulfing candle on a daily timeframe (in positive territory).\n\nUS10Y-US02Y Daily Chart\n\n10 Year T Note Futures Chart\n\nThe main reason for the bid was that the back end (longer term) bonds sold off at a faster rate than the front end (shorter term) bonds.\n\nBonds and yields are inversely related. Therefore, yields rose faster in the back end than in the front end causing the yield curve to rise.\n\nWest Texas Oil Daily Chart\n\nWill the yield curve turn negative again soon? Obviously, there is no way to tell, but let\u2019s look at another instrument with a similar pattern and see what happened:\n\nFall of 2018,\n\nTraded lower in a channel from near $77.50 to near $55.00\n\nPut in a head and shoulders REVERSAL bottom down to $42.23\n\nStalled at the neckline of the 32.8% retracement of the entire move lower, near $55.00\n\nBroke the neckline at roughly $55.00.\n\nTraded higher within a channel to the 61.8% retracement of the previous move, and horizontal resistance, near $64.00.\n\nUS10Y-US02Y Daily Chart\n\nSummer of 2019, Yield Curve\n\nTraded lower in a channel from near 0.25 down to 0.00\n\nCurrently putting in the right shoulder of a possible head and shoulders REVERSAL bottom down near -0.05.\n\nStalling at neckline at 0.041%\n\nBidding up towards the 38.2% retracement level of the entire move lower, near 0.086.\n\nIf the 38.2% retracement level gets taken out, the yield curve could bid up to the 61.8% retracement of the previous move, and horizontal resistance, near 0.15/0.17\n\nCould the current yield curve follow the same pattern as crude did in the fall of 2018? Maybe. But planning a trade and being ready for the possible outcomes are just as important as executing the trade!\n\nOriginal Post", "description": "Bonds Analysis by City Index (Joe Perry) covering: Crude Oil WTI Futures, United States 2-Year, United States 10-Year.
