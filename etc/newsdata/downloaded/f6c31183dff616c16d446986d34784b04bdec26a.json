Deep State. Shameful!\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\n\u201cIs there such a thing as a two-sided witch hunt?\u201d Kimmel asked. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t know, was there a group of witches that hunted down regular people?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe President is melting down like a creamsicle in July,\u201d the host added. \u201cHe\u2019s threatening to sue Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff. Who is he going to get to sue them? All his lawyers are either in jail\u2014or going there.\u201d\n\nThen, Kimmel moved on to Trump\u2019s unlikely feud with Fox News. As The New York Times reported over the weekend, the president personally called Fox CEO Suzanne Scott to complain that the network was not being sufficiently deferential to him.\n\n\u201cHe really is the snowiest, flakiest snowflake there ever has been, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Kimmel said. \u201cYou could ski on Donald Trump!\u201d\n\nMonday was also Kimmel\u2019s first episode since anchor Shepard Smith abruptly left Fox News after 23 years with the network. \u201cShepard Smith was one of the only reasons they were able to use the word \u2018news\u2019 after Fox with a straight face,\u201d the host added.\n\nFrom there, Kimmel premiered his new promo for Trump\u2019s potential Fox News competitor channel, complete with shows like \u201cBroads on a Couch,\u201d \u201cNugent at Noon\u201d and \u201cKillin\u2019 Time with O.J. Simpson.\u201d", "description": "The host also said that departing anchor Shepard Smith \u201cwas one of the only reasons they were able to use the word \u2018news\u2019 after Fox with a straight face.\u201d", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1435,w_2551,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571113192/JK_55_xsrdun", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
