Let me tell you what I mean. 99.9% of all money laundering crimes go unprosecuted. I testified before the U.S. Senate about this, and the person who cited that statistic, other than Senator Chuck Grasley, was the ex-Treasury official. And I thought that can\u2019t be right. But I researched it and indeed it\u2019s true.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe financial services industry is spending $20 billion a year on AML [anti-money-laundering] and KYC [Know Your Customer checks],\u201d she added, \u201cso I would ask you: is it even working? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s working.\u201d\n\nFrom the perspective of AML, she said, when it comes to \u201cmoving to a decentralized system, I think we\u2019re kidding ourselves if we think that\u2019s going to change too much.\u201d\n\nLegitimate restrictions\n\nHaun and Bass discussed the need to trace the flow of funds to combat illicit activities more broadly and the extent to which this justifies restricting the peer-to-peer flow of value transfer.\n\nBass noted that having a centralized financial system provides governments with greater leverage when it comes to bad sovereign actors, a power that cryptocurrency could diminish:\n\n\u201cISIS had $2 billion, it\u2019s a widely known secret that it\u2019s held in Turkish banks and run by legitimate businessmen who decide to launder money. If the US is looking to sanction bad sovereign actions, we can actually make it really difficult for them to move significant amounts of capital today or do business with US banks.\u201d\n\nHaun responded that to the extent that one can accept that a given government\u2019s authority is being exercised in good faith and for legitimate ends, this holds true:\n\n\u201cBut I would also say, at what cost do you do that? You have 2 billion people in the world today who are unbanked, who have zero access to financial services.\u201d\n\nAs previously reported, Haun has recently argued that the United States blocking Facebook\u2019s Libra digital currency will have national security implications.", "description": "The prosecutor for the Silk Road case says that the fiat-dominated financial system is inept at tackling the very thing it purports to worry about when it comes...", "authors": ["Marie Huillet"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvYjIyOTZiYjUxZDAzZDI4NGY4MzQ2ODIwYmJlYWYzNjEuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
