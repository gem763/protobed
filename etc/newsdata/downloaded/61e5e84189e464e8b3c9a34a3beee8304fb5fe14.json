And I thought mistakenly, as it happened, that they had heard about how famous I was in Trinidad and Tobago television, you know?\u2019 he recalled.\n\n\u2018Absolutely stupidly. And then they said, we\u2019re looking for black reporters on the BBC. I have no problem with that,\u2019 he added on the Chris Evans Virgin Radio Breakfast Show.\n\n\u2018But I have a problem with the whole business of positive discrimination, where it affects me. I didn\u2019t want to be the person who was chosen as the black reporter because somebody from a board wanted black reporters. I felt that I could do some things on my own merit and I wanted to do it.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrevor went on to describe his jump to ITV, revealing he was offered a job quickly and wanted time to think about it.\n\nThe 80-year-old recalled one of his colleagues telling him: \u2018Silly man, pick up a phone call now,\u2019 with him going on to spend years at ITN.\n\nTrevor went on to work at ITN for years (Picture: PA Archive)\n\nDespite the reporter coming into contact with all kinds of stars and famous figures throughout his career, he previously revealed that he\u2019s only been left starstruck once.\n\n\u2018I was very over-awed by going into the Oval Office in the West Wing,\u2019 he previously said on Good Morning Britain.\n\nTrevor had an iconic spot on News At Ten (Picture: BBC)\n\n\u2018 [George] Bush Jr did that [for me] and he was very kind and generous and he said to me, \u201cI\u2019ve given you this privilege which none of the White House correspondents got.\u201d\n\n\u2018And I said, \u201cOh Mr President I\u2019m terribly sorry, I hope that doesn\u2019t get you into any trouble\u201d, he said, \u201cNo, no I can deal with them\u201d.\u2019\n\nComing in at a close second, Sir Trevor described his meeting with Nelson Mandela as a \u2018terribly emotional moment\u2019.\n\nMetro.co.uk has contacted the BBC for comment.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
