(Picture: Getty)\n\nIf you\u2019ve got a calm AND loving pet, they could earn up to \u00a350 an hour by comforting people who struggle with conditions like anxiety and stress.\n\nBark.com has launched a new Comfort Pet category, which will include reptiles, birds, cats, dogs and farm animals, after research shows that interacting with animals improves wellbeing.\n\nMembers of the public will be able to hire a pet of their choice for a minimum of an hour, to help with their symptoms at home or at work.\n\nAll owners have to do is sign their pets up to be a part of the Comfort Pet service.\n\nThe service has launched following research which shows that animal assisted therapy alleviates a number of physical and mental conditions, such as high blood pressure, stress, depression, anxiety, and behavioural problems.\n\nThe Comfort Pet service is aimed at all ages, and, depending on the pet owner, can include home and office visits, or onsite visits where participants travel to the pet\u2019s location. Participants can also opt for group or one-to-one sessions, depending on the capability of the Comfort Pet and its owner.\n\nCats are more than welcome! (Picture: Shutterstock)\n\nAny species of pet can be signed up to the new service, including, but not limited to, birds, snakes, lizards, llamas, goats, dogs, cats, horses and rabbits. The trend for emotional support animals has increased rapidly over the last year, although these are not currently legally recognised like service animals such as Guide Dogs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nComfort Pet providers can expect to earn up to \u00a350 an hour, however the owner decides how much they charge.\n\nThe owner must be present during the comfort sessions, and must be able to demonstrate they have full control of their pet at all times.\n\nIt\u2019s a good idea for the comfort pet and its owner to meet with the participants first to agree what will be covered in the session and to ensure that the pet is comfortable with the environment.\n\nBark.com also recommends a contract is written up which agrees the terms of the pet and participant\u2019s interactions, including what is deemed as inappropriate behaviour by both parties and that both parties take full responsibility for their behaviour.\n\nKai Feller, co-founder of Bark.com said: \u2018We are a country of animal lovers, and with research proving the health benefits of interacting with them, and a host of amazing pets out there, it made sense to expand our current therapy offering with Comfort Pets.\n\n\u2018Many people appreciate and understand the benefits of spending time with animals, but for some it\u2019s not always possible. We also want to make sure we offer a wide variety of pets, in part so the service can be completely tailored to each individual that uses it, but also to combat the rise in animal allergies in the UK.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Everyone should be able to benefit from spending time with their very own Comfort Pet, no matter their circumstances.\u2019\n\nMORE: Little girl tells dad she\u2019s \u2018done\u2019 with sausages after he told her where they come from\n\nMORE: Biscuit-obsessed couple have Lotus Biscoff-themed wedding with melted spread fountain and mini jars as favours\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Bark.com is looking for animals to comfort people with anxiety for up to \u00a350 an hour.", "authors": ["Hattie Gladwell"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_90166475_1571288706.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
