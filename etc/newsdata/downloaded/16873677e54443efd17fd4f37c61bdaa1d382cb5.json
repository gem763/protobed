The shutoff could begin when winds peak early Wednesday and last through mid-Thursday.\n\n\u201cThis is shaping up to be one of the most severe dry wind events we\u2019ve seen in our territory in recent years,\u201d Michael Lewis, senior vice president of PG&E Electric Operations, said in the statement. \u201cIt could take several days to fully restore power after the weather passes and safety inspections are completed.\u201d\n\nPG&E and other California utilities have been taking aggressive measures to keep equipment from sparking blazes after power lines ignited catastrophic fires in 2017 and 2018. For PG&E, the stakes are especially high. It already faces an estimated $30 billion in wildfire liabilities. Another major blaze sparked by its equipment could upend the company\u2019s restructuring plans.\n\nThe National Weather Service has posted red flag warnings in parts of six western states, meaning the fire danger is high. In California, the warnings ring the Bay Area including Napa County, where the Tubbs fire killed at least 22 and destroyed more than 5,600 structures in October 2017.\n\nA low-pressure system sweeping in from the north will pass east of the region, driving winds off the Sierra Nevada mountains that become hotter and drier as they approach the Pacific Ocean. It\u2019s a common weather pattern this time of year, and September and October are historically the height of California\u2019s fire season.\n\n\u201cThe worst of it could very well be tomorrow, but some threat continues probably through Thursday,\u201d said Marc Chenard, a senior branch forecaster with the U.S. Weather Prediction Center.\n\nThe risk of fire will also be high Thursday in portions of Southern (NYSE: ) California, which has suffered its own deadly blazes in recent years.\n\nPG&E\u2019s service warning includes parts of California\u2019s most populous areas, including Santa Clara County\u2019s almost 2 million people and Alameda County\u2019s 1.7 million residents, according to state data.\n\nThe company began proactively cutting electricity last year to head off fire risk, and this would be the biggest shutoff to date based on the number of counties potentially affected.", "description": "PG&E Warns of Huge Power Shutoff as California Becomes Tinderbox", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picaf13cd6a9cc4d763436d9f115acf2920.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
