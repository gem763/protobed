Now it\u2019s defying them.", "language": "en", "text": "The toy aisle is catching up to the idea that not all kids want to play within the pink and blue boundaries of gender-specific playthings.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mattel launched its first line of what it calls \u201cgender-inclusive dolls,\u201d where the figures in both form and fashion are not coded as stereotypically male or female. The dolls come with a kit that includes wigs with long and short hairstyles and clothing options like skirts, jeans, leggings and denim jackets.\n\nThe six dolls in Mattel\u2019s new \u201cCreatable World\u201d line also come in different skin tones. Each kit retails for $30.\n\n\u201cWe never talked to a kid who didn\u2019t flip from joy when they saw the doll,\u201d said Monica Dreger, who oversees research of new toys as Mattel\u2019s vice president of global consumer insights. The doll \"was relatable and self-expressive. Kids saw an open canvas and felt they were in charge of their play.\u201d\n\nThe new line was roughly two years in the making and comes as the company recognized that both kids and the culture at large were moving toward gender neutrality. Dreger, who described her job as a \u201cpsychologist of consumers,\u201d said one particular trend was emerging among kids about two years ago.\n\n\n\nThe Mattel toy company on Sept. 25 launched the Creatable World\u2122 customizable doll line that allows children to create what the company calls \"gender inclusive\" dolls.\n\n\u201cOne of the things they pushed back on a lot was labeling. It was this big, huge force, almost like, if you\u2019re constricting them, they really pushed away,\u201d Dreger said. \u201cWhen you take away the labels, it becomes for everybody.\u201d\n\nTrans and gender-fluid kids said they felt they could see themselves in the doll, while cisgender kids told researchers the doll reminded them of their friends, Dreger said.\n\nMore important, she hopes the doll puts an end to a story she heard throughout the two years of research and development.\n\n\u201cSome kids said birthdays and Christmas were their worst days because they didn\u2019t feel it was acceptable to ask for what they wanted,\u201d as was often the case for young boys who wanted a doll, Dreger said.\n\nThe Creatable World dolls are a departure from some of Mattel\u2019s best-known creations. The iconic Barbie doll has been criticized for idealizing a narrow view of femininity and promoting unrealistic beauty standards. Even as the dolls were tweaked to be more representative of modern women (being a fashionista and an astrophysicist are no longer mutually exclusive in Barbie\u2019s world), they weren\u2019t peer-like; the most popular toys marketed to grade-school-age children are usually adults or baby dolls.\n\n[Top travel toys and games for 2019]\n\nMattel\u2019s new line of dolls, meanwhile, more closely resemble the company\u2019s pre-adolescent target market: there\u2019s no makeup, facial hair, bosoms or broad shoulders to be found. The aging down of the doll makes it easier to achieve a gender-neutral appearance, but Dreger said it was also important for kids to have a doll who they could relate to like a friend.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not aspirational, it\u2019s a way they can imagine themselves,\u201d Dreger said. \u201cA slightly cooler version of themselves.\u201d\n\nBut while few parents would object to buying a doll that wears a trendy leather jacket instead of a fairy-tale ballgown, Dreger admits that not all of the adults in the 250-family research pool were as receptive as their kids were to a doll that couldn\u2019t be neatly labeled \u201cboy\u201d or \u201cgirl.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany parents saw the doll for what it was, and a lot of parents do feel there\u2019s a need for the gender-neutral toys. Where the confusion lies is before some parents saw the doll,\u201d Dreger said. She noted Mattel drew from seven cities around the country that were a mix of progressive areas to deeply conservative ones, where there may be less visibility for concepts like non-binary or fluid. \u201cA lot of parents had a hard time and confused identity and sexuality \u2014 and felt they had to explain it to their kids.\u201d\n\nThe other sticking point was social stigma. \u201cParents said, \u2018I think this is cool, and I like the idea, but what will my neighbors think?\u2019 \u201d\n\nDreger said even among the most conservative groups, the concerns ultimately dissolved when they actually saw the doll. Dreger recalled one mother, a hairdresser from \u201ca pretty conservative state,\u201d who was struggling with understanding her young son\u2019s transition. Looking at the doll made her feel less alone because it signaled to her that there were other kids out there like her son.\n\n\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t make this doll for just one person,\u201d Dreger recalls the woman saying.\n\n[Merriam-Webster adds non-binary pronoun \u2018they\u2019 to dictionary]\n\nMattel is the first toy manufacturer of its size to create a line of dolls that aren\u2019t specifically gendered but gender-neutral toys, and kid\u2019s products are becoming an increasingly visible part of the market targeted at young consumers (or the adults who buy for them).\n\nIn 2015, Target said its stores would end labeling toys and bedding as specifically \u201cgirl\u201d or \u201cboy.\u201d Two years later, Amazon removed \u201cboys\u201d and \u201cgirls\u201d from its toy search categories. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post). While the move to sell toys and market beyond traditional gender binaries is still growing in the United States, countries such as Sweden have had non-gendered toys and classroom setups for years.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say Mattel isn\u2019t expecting pushback; Dreger knows some people will view an intentionally gender inclusive doll as a political statement. But she sees resistance to the idea as affirmation that the company has created the right toy at the right time.\n\n\u201cIt shows me that we\u2019re exactly where we need to be. If there was no pushback to something that right now is a hot topic means we\u2019re either not authentic, or we\u2019re too late,\u201d Dreger said. \u201cThe kids are behind it. We know we\u2019re on time for them.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAn acclaimed French chef is suing over a lost Michelin star.
