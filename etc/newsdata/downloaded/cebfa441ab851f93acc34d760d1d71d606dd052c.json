The only person responsible for rape is the rapist and if schools aren\u2019t teaching this, it is a serious problem that needs to be rectified immediately.\n\n\u201cGood quality sex education has an essential role to play to tackling the culture that allows sexual violence and coercion to thrive. Schools also have a responsibility to ensure that children feel safe and supported to speak out if they are a victim of sexual abuse.\n\n\"Many victims of rape and other forms of sexual abuse are under 18, so it is vital that from an early age, students are taught age appropriate sex education which incorporates healthy relationships, sexual health, the meaning of consent, and rights over their own bodies.\"\n\nA study found one in seven young Australians think a man can force a woman to have sex if she initiated it but then changed her mind.\n\nThe National Community Attitudes towards Violence against Women Survey Youth Report, published back in May, found many young people have troubling views about sexual consent and abusive relationships.\n\nIt found one in three men believe women who say they were raped actually had consensual sex and later regretted it. One in five young men were found to believe that domestic violence is a normal reaction to stress.\n\nIn the UK, a majority of men think a woman is more likely to be sexually harassed or assaulted if she wears revealing clothes, according to an exclusive survey conducted for The Independent. It found 55 per cent of men believed that \u201cthe more revealing the clothes a woman wears, the more likely it is that she will be harassed or assaulted\u201d.\n\nThe research by polling company D-CYFOR found men are markedly more likely to hold this view than women \u2013 with 41 per cent of female respondents subscribing to the view that revealing clothing invites unwanted sexual advances.\n\nDublin Rape Crisis Centre, which runs a free 24-hour helpline for people who have been sexually assaulted, said the findings illustrated how deeply entrenched victim-blaming is in society.\n\nNoeline Blackwell, head of the centre, said: \u201cThere is an assumption \u2013 not borne out by any evidence \u2013 that the way a woman dresses is likely to lead to rape or sexual assault.\n\n\u201cWe know that people are raped wearing a variety of clothing. The idea that a woman who goes out scantily clad will be pounced on is the most common myth across generations. They could be in their jeans, school uniform, or pyjamas.\u201d\n\nThe school and the teacher has been contacted for comment.", "description": "An Australian teacher is being investigated after appearing to tell her pupils a rape victim\u2019s choice of clothing is partly responsible for assault.
