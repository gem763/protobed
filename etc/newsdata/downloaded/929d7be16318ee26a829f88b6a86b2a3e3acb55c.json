Pending the appeal process, the law remains in place.\"\n\n\"The ruling was over a lawsuit filed this year by a group of Republican governors and state attorneys general,\" per the N.Y. Times.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Reed O\u2019Connor in Fort Worth, a George W. Bush appointee, wrote that the individual mandate requiring people to have health insurance \"can no longer be sustained as an exercise of Congress\u2019s tax power.\"\n\nThe big picture: This was an amazingly broad ruling. The judge didn't just strike down everything that's related to the individual mandate. He struck down everything, period.\n\nThat includes the parts that everyone likes, like the expansion of Medicaid, young adults staying on their parents' plans \u2014 and, of course, coverage of pre-existing conditions.\n\nNothing happens right away. The ruling will be appealed, there's no injunction to shut down the law right now, and the Trump administration is making it clear the law stays in place for now.\n\nWhy it matters: You should take this ruling seriously. It's getting a lot of criticism from legal experts, including ACA critics, and it could be overturned \u2014 but it won't definitely be overturned. This really could end with the ACA being wiped out.\n\nThe ACA has already survived two near-death experiences with the Supreme Court \u2014 over the mandate in 2012 and subsidies in 2015.\n\nBut that was before the Kavanaugh Court. If this ruling gets that far, the justices could say the ruling went too far and overturn it.\n\nBut there\u2019s no guarantee that a more conservative court won\u2019t just let the law die.\n\nPolitical fallout: This could be a nightmare for Republicans in suburbs and swing states.", "description": "This really could end with the Affordable Care Act being wiped out.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/zqDEVTuFTln8QrMIEaba3Yd-n-Y=/0x369:4488x2894/1920x1080/2018/12/15/1544887394645.jpg", "published_at": "2018-12-15"}
