The book also suggests the Peacock Network wasn\u2019t truthful regarding knowledge of alleged sexual misconduct by former \u201cToday\u201d co-host Matt Lauer.\n\nFarrow reported that Weinstein leveraged information regarding Lauer to keep NBC off his back. Farrow\u2019s former NBC News producer Rich McHugh, who is a key figure of the book, also penned a recent Vanity Fair column that said NBC News Chairman Andy Lack, and his top deputy Noah Oppenheim, breached \u201cjournalistic integrity\u201d when they put the kibosh on the Weinstein story.\n\n\u201cMounting reports show that NBC News executives \u2013 namely Noah Oppenheim \u2013 failed to hold sexual abusers accountable, failed to combat a toxic culture across newsrooms, and that the network\u2019s so-called investigation into its culture was little more than a sham to provide cover for executives,\u201d Thomas said.\n\nMIKA BRZEZINSKI PUBLICLY SUPPORTED NEWS VET BROKAW AMID MISCONDUCT CLAIMS, PRIVATELY APOLOGIZED\n\nNBC famously told Farrow that his reporting on Weinstein wasn\u2019t fit to print, so he took it to The New Yorker where it won the Pulitzer Prize and helped launch the #MeToo movement. \u201cCatch and Kill\u201d details Farrow\u2019s side of the story and features additional accusations against NBC News bigwigs.\n\n\u201cAdditional reports that MSNBC executive Phil Griffin showed staff graphic images of Access Hollywood personality Maria Menounos prove that this toxic culture is an epidemic that extends across nearly all newsrooms and networks at the company,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cTaken together, these initial reports demonstrate that NBC\u2019s current leadership is either unable or unwilling to take appropriate steps to combat the culture of sexual abuse at the networks.\u201d\n\nAfter the Weinstein and Lauer bombshells were reported in 2017, NBC refused to hire an outside investigator to determine who knew about Lauer\u2019s sexual misconduct and whether NBC executives looked the other way. NBC relied on in-house general counsel Kim Harris despite widespread calls for an outside law firm to conduct the review.\n\nNBC eventually declared that management was completely oblivious to Lauer\u2019s behavior and Harris\u2019 high-powered colleagues were cleared by the network. Lack and Oppenheim remain atop NBC News.\n\n\u201cThe DNC must stand with survivors and pull the upcoming democratic presidential primary debate from MSNBC until Comcast takes clear steps to clean house at NBC News.\" \u2014 UltraViolet co-founder Shaunna Thomas\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe UltraViolet founder said the ongoing issues \u201ccan only be solved by significant structural and cultural changes at MSNBC, NBC News and its parent company, Comcast,\u201d and called on the DNC to stand with women and force necessary changes.\n\n\u201cThe DNC must stand with survivors and pull the upcoming democratic presidential primary debate from MSNBC until Comcast takes clear steps to clean house at NBC News,\u201d Thomas said.\n\nMSNBC and NBC News did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nUltraViolet bills itself as \u201ca powerful and rapidly growing community of people mobilized to fight sexism and create a more inclusive world that accurately represents all women, from politics and government to media and pop culture.\u201d", "description": "A prominent women\u2019s group has called on the DNC to pull its upcoming debate from MSNBC unless NBC News \u201ccleans house\u201d and launches an independent investigation into \u201callegations of a culture of sexual abuse\u201d at the network.", "authors": ["Brian Flood", "Ultraviolet Co-Founder Shaunna Thomas", "Brian Flood Covers The Media For Fox News.
