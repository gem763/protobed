It was a questionable penalty from the Jets safety, given that he only made contact on Mayfield with his hands and arms (pushing him to the ground). Also, Adams was in stride and in his next step after Mayfield released the ball down the field.\n\nIt was a bit of a dubious call, only exacerbating Adams\u2019 angst when he sounded off in a tweet Wednesday night that featured some profanity.\n\nFormer New York Jets cornerback Antonio Cromartie, who was selected to the Pro Bowl four times, said that the penalty on Adams wasn\u2019t just the wrong call but so to was the ensuing fine.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just ridiculous.
