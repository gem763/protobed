It was Kiera Walsh, Tessa Wullaert and Lee Geum-Min who took the limelight from the traditional stars.\n\nDespite Manchester City having almost their entire squad called up for international duty, it was Birmingham City who felt the damage as they missed their star player Lucy Staniforth, who picked up an injury in England\u2019s friendly against Portugal on Tuesday. Birmingham still have yet to score a game in the WSL this season.\n\nManchester City\u2019s Janine Beckie looked very promising from the start, making a lot of chances on the right-hand side. It was the resulting corner from her saved shot that would put Manchester City ahead. England international Walsh struck the ball hard on her right foot from 25 yards out firing it into the bottom right-hand corner after a big deflection, giving City a 1-0 lead.", "description": "Manchester City will now top the Women\u2019s Super League (WSL) table after a confident 3-0 win over Birmingham City at the Academy Stadium, maintaining their perfect start to the season with seven consecutive wins in all competitions and not a WSL goal conceded.", "authors": ["Sophie Penney", "Jason Burt", "Oliver Brown"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000212824880-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqGGw_fvcmF0SUFCNAbmVvB_rcho2t05IAB_9aUX5SIZw.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
