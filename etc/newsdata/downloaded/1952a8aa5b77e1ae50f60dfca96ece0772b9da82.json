They want parliamentarians to be able to scrutinize the government in the run-up to Brexit, including its strategy for negotiating a deal and its efforts to prepare for a no-deal scenario.\n\nWith appeals against both judgments now launched, the U.K.'s Supreme Court will have to adjudicate on whether MPs must be recalled or not. Here's POLITICO's guide to what the judgments mean and what happens next:\n\nWhat did the Scottish court say?\n\nScotland\u2019s Court of Session, the nation\u2019s highest civil court, ruled that Johnson's decision to suspend parliament between September 9 and October 14 \u201cwas motivated by the improper purpose of stymying Parliament and that it, and what has followed from it, is unlawful.\u201d\n\nThe judgment asserts, in effect, that the prime minister misled the queen when advising her to prorogue the legislature. \"The Court will accordingly make an Order declaring that the Prime Minister's advice to HM the Queen and the prorogation which followed thereon was unlawful and is thus null and of no effect,\" the judgment reads.\n\nAnti-Brexit politicians and campaigners have hailed the ruling as \u201chistoric\u201d and are demanding that parliament reconvene within the next 24 hours.\n\nThey say Scotland\u2019s Court of Session is the highest court in the U.K. to have ruled on the matter, and that parliament should therefore be able to sit again until such time as the Supreme Court, which is expected to hear the government's appeal next week, may rule otherwise.\n\nDominic Grieve, a former Tory MP who now sits as an independent, says that if parliament resumes its activity in the next few hours MPs could go a step further and vote to cancel the three-week parliamentary recess linked to the party conference season. That would give extra time for debate ahead of the crunch European Council summit on October 17 and 18.\n\nSo that's settled?\n\nNot so fast. The government is appealing the Court of Session's ruling. And it has also been buoyed by a contradictory ruling from the High Court of England and Wales in London. Three judges ruled that the prime minister\u2019s decision to shut down parliament is \u201cpolitical in nature\u201d and not a matter for the courts.\n\nAccording to the House of Commons speaker\u2019s office, any decision to recall parliament \u201cis a matter for the government.\u201d\n\nThe claimants in this case, led by the pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, had argued that Johnson\u2019s real reason for shutting down parliament was to impede MPs from scrutinizing the government on Brexit.\n\nBut the High Court judges said Wednesday that even if that were to be true, it would not be a matter for the courts to rule on. A prime minister can suspend parliament for a number of different reasons, \u201cwhich may, depending on the facts and circumstances, extend to obtaining a political advantage,\u201d they said, adding that \u201cthere is no statute, law or convention which requires parliament to sit in constant session.\u201d\n\nAnd in the full judgment, they point out that prorogation has been used in the past by governments to gain legislative and hence political advantage. So even if the suspension is in reality designed to advance the government's political agenda regarding Brexit and not \u2014 as ministers say \u2014 to give time to prepare a fresh legislative program, it would still be legal. \"That is not territory in which a court can enter with judicial review,\" the judges argue.\n\nWill parliament be recalled?\n\nNot for now. According to the House of Commons speaker\u2019s office, any decision to recall parliament \u201cis a matter for the government.\u201d But it looks unlikely that the government will act before the Supreme Court rules on the cases \u2014 despite pressure from opposition MPs who want to get back to work on the green benches.\n\nA hearing in the Supreme Court that will consider the High Court and Court of Session judgments (and a related case launched in Northern Ireland) is due to take place on September 17.\n\nWhat does this mean for Brexit?\n\nMPs concerned about the U.K. crashing out of the EU on October 31 without a deal argue that extra parliamentary time is needed in order to prevent that scenario.\n\nBefore parliament was suspended on Monday, opposition MPs managed to pass legislation forcing the prime minister to request an extension if no deal has been agreed by October 19. But they worry the government may find a loophole that allows Johnson to drag Britain out of the EU without a deal and against the will of the majority of the House of Commons.\n\nThe five-week suspension gives Johnson breathing space and an opportunity to discuss his plans with EU leaders without being held accountable by parliament, where he does not have a majority in either of the chambers.\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO\u2019s premium Brexit service for professionals: Brexit Pro.
