I think people who were watching would say, \u2018Hey it\u2019s understandable. His father just passed away.\u2019 I didn\u2019t want that, I wanted to play better than I had ever played before.\u201d\n\nHe did just that, throwing for 311 yards and four touchdowns in the first half alone on an emotional night that featured a respectful ovation from the usually hostile Raiders crowd.\n\nFavre finished the game 22 for 30 for 399 yards - 3 shy of his career best at the time - then embraced his wife, Deanna, on the field in the fourth quarter before flying back home to Mississippi after the game.\n\nThe game left a lasting impact on NFL fans everywhere, especially those in Wisconsin who were die-hard Packers supporters. That included one 14-year-old high school freshman in Pewaukee, Wisconsin, who would become a star of his own one day.\n\n\u201cI remember it extremely well. I mean I don\u2019t know the stats, but I\u2019m pretty sure that back in the state of Wisconsin there was probably 100 percent of televisions turned into that game,\u201d Houston Texans defensive lineman J.J. Watt said. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to explain what it felt like, I was young, so it\u2019s not like I really understood everything that was going on. But even I could tell that something special was happening that night. \u2026 Favre was just chucking the ball up and it ending up in the Packers\u2019 hands. It was a magical, special thing to watch and the emotions that you saw out of him and his family, it was cool to watch.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a look at how that memorable game affected each team in subsequent seasons:\n\nGREEN BAY\n\nThe performance was one of the last great moments in Favre\u2019s career in Green Bay that had featured a Super Bowl title following the 1996 season, another trip to the title game the following season and three MVP awards.\n\nThe Packers lost in overtime in the division round of the playoffs that season when Philadelphia converted a fourth-and-26 in the closing minutes to set up the game-tying field goal.\n\nFavre threw four interceptions in a wild-card loss at home the following season.\n\nGreen Bay then drafted Aaron Rodgers in the first round in 2005 and Favre\u2019s tenure in Green Bay ended when he threw an interception in overtime that set up the game-winning field goal for the Giants in an NFC title game win at Lambeau Field.\n\nOAKLAND\n\nThe loss compounded the mistake late owner Al Davis made back in 1991 when he disregarded his scouts and drafted Todd Marinovich instead of Favre.\n\nThe 2003 season started a long run of losing after the team had won three straight AFC West titles and gone to the Super Bowl following the 2002 season in the only run of success following the move back to Oakland in 1995.\n\nCoach Bill Callahan was fired after the season. The Raiders didn\u2019t post a winning record or playoff berth again until 2016.\n\nMEMORABLE GAMES\n\n1968: These interconference foes have met only 13 times ever and the only other memorable one was the first - a matchup in the second Super Bowl.\n\nOakland won the AFL that year and it gave Davis a chance to deliver a blow to commissioner Pete Rozelle and the NFL. Davis was named commissioner of the AFL in 1966 and sought to bring down the more established league. Instead, AFL owners decided to merge with the NFL and the deal left Rozelle as commissioner. Davis went back to the Raiders to run the team.\n\nHis chance at revenge was quickly snuffed out by the Packers in Vince Lombardi\u2019s final game as coach in Green Bay.\n\nBart Starr threw a 62-yard TD pass to Boyd Dowler to give the Packers a 13-0 lead in the second quarter and they were never threatened. Herb Adderley\u2019s interception return for a TD against Daryle Lamonica made it 33-7 and the Packers won their second straight Super Bowl with a 33-14 victory.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Kristie Rieken in Houston contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Brett Favre played in plenty of meaningful games with 24 playoff starts, five appearances in the conference title game and two trips to the Super Bowl on the way to the Hall of Fame.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Josh Dubow"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/15/game_of_the_week_analysis_football_04196_c0-61-1459-912_s1200x700.jpg?a15d859ccefe9df030b0d5b7e61d8583a2363a96", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
