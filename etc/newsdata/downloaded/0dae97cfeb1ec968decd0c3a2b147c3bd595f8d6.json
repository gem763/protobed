Be clear on what your complaint is\n\nBefore you pick up the phone or start drafting an email to the company in question, you need to be totally clear in your own mind exactly what your complaint is. Write down your issue (or issues) in concise bullet points so you can express yourself clearly when the hold music finally stops and you get a real person on the end of the line. If you\u2019re not sure exactly what your point is, they certainly won\u2019t be.\n\nRemember: the moment you lose your temper you\u2019ve lost the battle. Take deep breaths, stay calm and stay rational.\n\n2. Know what result you\u2019re hoping to achieve\n\nAs well as being clear on the specifics of your complaint, have in your head what solution would be acceptable to you. There is little use in complaining if there\u2019s nothing that can be done about it and no possible compensation that you would deem acceptable. (Unless you just want to get it off your chest, which is, of course, reason enough.)", "description": "Go forth and make a fuss!
