Temperature (top left) did not cause any changes\n\nThe lead researcher Professor Will Dixon said: 'Weather has been thought to affect symptoms in patients with arthritis since Hippocrates [2,000 years ago].\n\n'Around three quarters of people living with arthritis believe their pain is affected by the weather.\n\n'Yet, despite much research examining the existence and nature of this relationship, there remains no scientific consensus.\n\n'The analysis showed on a damp and windy days with low pressure the chances of experiencing more pain, compared to an average day, was around 20 per cent.\n\n'This would mean, if your chances of a painful day on an average weather day were five in 100, they would increase to six in 100 on a damp and windy day.'\n\nHOW DOES WEATHER INCREASE PAIN? The study by University of Manchester did not assess why pain may increase depending on the weather. It is thought a drop in atmospheric pressure may cause already inflamed tissue, such as the tendons, muscles, bone and scar tissue, to expand, leading to increased pain. Dr Terence Starz, rheumatologist at University of Pennsylvania Medical Center in Pittsburgh believes at least some of the increased pain comes from decreased activity, the Arthritis Foundation reports. He said: 'We know that physical activity relieves arthritis pain. And when the weather is unpleasant, people tend to hole up inside. That inactivity can lead to more pain.' He added: 'The mind-body connection is strong. If warm sunny weather makes you feel better psychologically, you\u2019ll probably feel better physically as well.'\n\nThe correlations remained even when accounting for mood and physical inactivity - other factors thought to be detrimental to pain levels.\n\nProfessor Dixon said the findings, published in the journal Digital Medicine, are 'important' for two reasons.\n\n'Given we can forecast the weather, it may be possible to develop a pain forecast knowing the relationship between weather and pain,' he said.\n\n'The dataset will also provide information to scientists interested in understanding the mechanisms of pain, which could ultimately open the door to new treatments.'\n\nHumid days were the most likely to be painful, whereas dry days were the least likely, according to the analysis.\n\nLow pressure and higher wind speed were also linked to more painful days, although to a lesser extent than humidity.\n\nThe NHS states that episodes of painful arthritis can be affected by the weather. But there is no scientific consensus.\n\nProfessor Dixon said: 'Our study did not examine the mechanism by which weather influences pain.\n\n'Other researchers have suggested why different aspects of the weather may influence pain but few have been conclusively proven.\n\n'Pressure has been suggested to have a direct effect on joints and their altered anatomy in patients with arthritis.'\n\nPeople with arthritis are more likely to feel pain on humid, windy days, a study suggests\n\nSelf-reported data from 2,658 people was provided for the study, funded by Versus Arthritis and called 'Cloudy with a chance of Pain'.\n\nThe group had a range of different health issues, predominantly arthritis, but also neuropathic pain.\n\nFor around six months, the participants provided daily data on a smartphone app for pain levels on most days.\n\nThe researchers acknowledged that the changes in pain could have been for various reasons \u2013 not specifically related to their arthritis.\n\n'However the symptoms recorded, including fatigue and stiffness, are all too common in people with the condition,' Professor Dixon said.\n\nIt's hoped the findings will help the staggering 10million patients in the UK and 31million in the US with arthritis and similar joint conditions to track and predict their pain.\n\nDr Stephen Simpson, of Versus Arthritis, said: 'We know of the 10million people in the UK with arthritis, over half experience life-altering pain every day.\n\n'Supporting effective ways of self-managing pain can make all the difference for people with arthritis.'\n\nHe added that it can 'help them to get and stay in work, to be full members of the community and simply to belong'.\n\nDr Simpson said the research will help scientists 'understand the bigger picture of the complexity of pain'.", "description": "Researchers led by Manchester University tracked 2,658 people with mainly musculoskeletal conditions to see if the weather had an impact on their aches and pains.", "authors": ["Vanessa Chalmers Health Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/00/20108416-0-image-a-27_1571872397858.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
