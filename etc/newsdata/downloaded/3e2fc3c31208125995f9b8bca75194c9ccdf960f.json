Schiff said Sunday that his panel has reached an agreement to secure testimony from the anonymous whistleblower whose detailed complaint launched an impeachment investigation into President Trump.\n\nThe announcement from Schiff came on the same day that Tom Bossert, a former Trump homeland security adviser, delivered a rebuke of the president, saying in an interview on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that he was \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d by the implications of Trump\u2019s recently reported actions.\n\nThose comments come as members of Congress return to their districts for a two-week recess, during which they will either have to make the case for Trump\u2019s impeachment or defend him to voters amid mounting questions about his conduct.\n\nIn appearances over the weekend, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) offered a preview of the Democratic message, casting the impeachment inquiry as a somber task that she chose to endorse only as a last resort.\n\n\u201cI have handled this with great care, with great moderation, with great attention to what we knew was a fact or what was an allegation,\u201d Pelosi said Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin. \u201cThis is very bad news for our country, because if as it seems to be, our president engaged in something that is so far beyond what our founders had in mind.\u201d\n\nWhile privately favoring a rapid probe confined to the Ukraine allegations, Pelosi said Saturday that the investigation would last \u201cas long as the Intelligence Committee follows the facts.\u201d\n\nIn an appearance on ABC News\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d Schiff (D-Calif.) echoed Pelosi\u2019s message. He also said he expected the Intelligence Committee to hear from the whistleblower \u201cvery soon\u201d pending a security clearance from acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get the unfiltered testimony of that whistleblower,\u201d Schiff said, noting that Maguire said in a hearing Thursday that he would allow the whistleblower to testify privately without constraints.\n\nOne of the whistleblower\u2019s attorneys, Mark Zaid, said in a statement that bipartisan negotiations in both chambers are ongoing \u201cand we understand all agree that protecting whistleblower\u2019s identity is paramount.\u201d He added that no date or time for the testimony has been set.\n\nMost Republican lawmakers and White House aides, meanwhile, continued to voice support for the president, even as they faced particularly tough grilling by hosts on the morning news shows over their efforts to discredit the unidentified whistleblower and keep the focus on former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) pointed to an initial finding by the intelligence community inspector general stating that while the complaint was credible, the whistleblower had an \u201carguable political bias.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe had no firsthand knowledge. . . . And, second, he has a political bias,\u2019\u2019 Jordan said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cThat should tell us something about this guy who came forward with this claim.\u2019\u2019\n\nHost Jake Tapper repeatedly pushed back against Jordan\u2019s assertions. \u201cThere is no evidence of that,\u201d he said in response to Jordan\u2019s claim of political bias, noting that the language used by the inspector general in describing the whistleblower \u201ccould mean that he interned for John McCain 20 years ago. We have no idea what it means.\u201d\n\nWhite House senior adviser Stephen Miller went even further in an at-times heated interview on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d\n\nMiller dodged several questions from host Chris Wallace about allegations surrounding the president\u2019s actions, such as Trump\u2019s decision to use not the federal government but rather his personal attorney, Rudolph W. Giuliani, to obtain information on the Bidens\u2019 activities in Ukraine.\n\nHe also declined to answer when asked by Wallace to outline how, in his view, the Bidens broke any laws. And he disputed the use of the word \u201cwhistleblower\u201d to describe the person who sounded the alarm about Trump\u2019s actions, arguing that the complaint was a \u201cpartisan hit job\u201d by a \u201cdeep-state operative\u201d \u2014 even though Maguire said in congressional testimony last week that he thinks the whistleblower \u201cis operating in good faith and has followed the law.\u201d\n\nAs both sides sparred, Trump largely stayed out of public view. The president spent the weekend playing golf at his club in Sterling, Va., and occasionally attacking Democrats and the news media online. On Sunday morning, he sent more than 20 tweets and retweets slamming Fox News Channel host Ed Henry\u2019s performance during a segment with conservative commentator Mark Levin.\n\nLater Sunday, Trump tweeted that he wants Schiff \u201cquestioned at the highest level for Fraud & Treason\u201d for his remarks at last week\u2019s hearing where Maguire testified. And Trump demanded to meet the whistleblower as well as the person\u2019s sources.\n\n\u201cIn addition, I want to meet not only my accuser, who presented SECOND & THIRD HAND INFORMATION, but also the person who illegally gave this information, which was largely incorrect, to the \u2018Whistleblower,\u2019 \u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cWas this person SPYING on the U.S. President? Big Consequences!\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats last week began an impeachment inquiry into Trump\u2019s actions after the release of the whistleblower complaint as well as a rough transcript of a July phone call in which Trump repeatedly urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden, who is leading in polls for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nHunter Biden served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine\u2019s largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment. The former vice president\u2019s son was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation.\n\nAs vice president, Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases. At the time, the investigation into Burisma was dormant, according to former Ukrainian and U.S. officials.\n\nTrump\u2019s handling of the matter appears to have alarmed voters. An ABC News-Ipsos poll released Sunday showed that 63 percent of adults say it is a serious problem that Trump pushed Zelensky to look at Hunter Biden.\n\nHowever, less than half of the public, 43 percent, said Trump\u2019s action was \u201cvery serious.\u201d And just about half of Americans said they are \u201cnot surprised at all\u201d to hear of Trump\u2019s actions.\n\nAmong those expressing concern Sunday was Bossert, a rare official with ties to Trump to take on the president.\n\nBossert said he was \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d by the implications of Trump\u2019s call to Zelensky and strongly criticized the president for seemingly furthering an unfounded theory that cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike played a role in shielding emails sent by Trump\u2019s 2016 Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, and circulating allegations of Russian hacking.\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community has concluded that the Russians did hack Democratic sources in an effort to swing the election to Trump.\n\n\u201cThat conspiracy theory has got to go,\u201d Bossert said on ABC News\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d explaining that Trump was motivated to spread the \u201ccompletely debunked\u201d theory because he had \u201cnot gotten his pound of flesh yet\u201d over accusations that he had Russian help in winning the 2016 election. \u201cThey have to stop with that. It cannot continue to be repeated in our discourse. . . . If he continues to focus on that white whale, it\u2019s going to bring him down.\u201d\n\nBut Bossert said he was not convinced that Trump had leveraged U.S. aid to Ukraine for political dirt, noting that the president had other potential legitimate reasons to withhold the aid.\n\nBoth sides continued to dig in as scrutiny of the president intensified.\n\nDemocrats argued that the documents released by the Trump administration last week reveal that the president was misusing his office.\n\nRep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said the president\u2019s call clearly showed an abuse of power that justified impeachment proceedings. In an appearance on \u201cState of the Union,\u201d he referenced \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d saying Trump used a \u201chigh-pressure tactic\u2019\u2019 by asking for an investigation of the Bidens.\n\n\u201cIt was an offer that the Ukrainian president could not refuse,\u2019\u2019 Jeffries said.\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, escalated their attacks on the whistleblower and dismissed the individual\u2019s claims as invalid.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t get a parking ticket conviction based on hearsay,\u201d Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said Sunday in an interview on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cDonald Trump is still an American. Every American deserves to confront their accuser. So this is a sham as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d\n\nIn a combative appearance on \u201cThis Week,\u201d Giuliani was asked at one point whether he would cooperate with the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s probe. Giuliani initially said he would not unless its leadership changed, calling Schiff \u201cillegitimate\u201d and accusing him of having \u201cprejudged the case.\u201d\n\nBut Giuliani then backtracked and said he would \u201cconsider it,\u201d based on the direction of Trump. \u201cIf he decides that he wants me to testify, of course I\u2019ll testify,\u201d he said.\n\nSchiff disputed Giuliani\u2019s characterization of his role, telling host George Stephanopoulos: \u201cMy role here is to do the investigation, to make sure the facts come out. What we have seen already is damning.\u201d\n\nGiuliani was somewhat more subdued in a separate appearance on Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cSunday Morning Futures,\u201d during which host Maria Bartiromo pressed him on criticism from some Republicans that his frequent television appearances were not helping the president.\n\n\u201cWhat am I supposed to do, keep silent?\u201d Giuliani asked.\n\nScott Clement and Christopher Rowland contributed to this report.", "description": "The announcement in the impeachment inquiry came on the same day that former adviser Tom Bossert said he was \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d by President Trump\u2019s reported actions.", "authors": ["Felicia Sonmez", "National Reporter On The Washington Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "Mike Debonis", "Congressional Reporter Covering The House Of Representatives", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/gqMxkH3Kpyk16D4bZw3B3RPrOWQ=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZC4WR3HC4EI6TJXIQ5M4LR7WBA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
