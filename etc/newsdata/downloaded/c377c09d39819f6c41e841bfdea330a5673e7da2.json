Among the most drastic changes was switching the card, now known as Green from Amex, from a charge card to a credit card. That means that for the first time, card holders won\u2019t have to pay off their entire balance every month.\n\nThe company also revamped the rewards categories for the card and upped the annual fee.\n\nRead more: This credit card will let you earn rewards to pay off your student loans \u2014 but is it a good deal?\n\n\u201cAmex themselves seemed to admit in their press release that the 50-year-old Green Card had gotten a little dated and needed a refresh for a new generation,\u201d said Ted Rossman, industry analyst at CreditCards.com.\n\nThe reconfigured Green Card is emblematic of the changes occurring across the credit-card industry. Here are some of the ways Amex\u2019s announcement are indicative of today\u2019s payment landscape:\n\nConsumers \u2014 and credit-card companies \u2014 want more flexibility in their wallets\n\nBecause the card was previously a charge card, Green Card holders used to have to pay their full balance off each month or incur a hefty penalty. Now, the card functions like a typical credit card \u2014 any remaining balance left at the end of each payment cycle will accrue interest.\n\nThe annual percentage rate on the card is now variable between 16.99% and 23.99%, depending on a person\u2019s creditworthiness. Card holders who make one or more late payments or have a payment returned will be assessed a penalty APR of 29.99%.\n\n\u201cThe knee-jerk reaction would be to say credit cards encourage consumers to carry expensive balances more than charge cards, but I think it goes deeper than that,\u201d Rossman said. \u201cToday\u2019s consumers desire flexibility.\u201d\n\nThe rise in personal loans, repayment plans and special financing exemplify this. Combining credit cards with personal loans is particularly attractive to young adults, Rossman said, because they\u2019re wary of open-ended debt thanks largely to the pressures they face from student loans.\n\n\u201cCharge cards run against this trend because they\u2019re more restrictive,\u201d Rossman said. \u201cThey\u2019re falling by the wayside as a result.\u201d\n\nAlso see: 4 biggest mistakes most people make with credit-card rewards\n\nMillennials and Gen-Z are now the target audience for credit cards\n\nOne look at the rewards categories is all it takes to know that the new Green Card is not your parents\u2019 Amex:\n\n\u2022 3x points on travel, including flights, hotels, tours, car rentals, ride shares, buses and subways\n\n\u2022 3x points at restaurants worldwide\n\n\u2022 Up to $100 in statement credits per calendar year for the purchase of CLEAR membership, which allows travelers to get through lines faster at airports, arenas, stadiums and Hertz rental car locations\n\n\u2022 Up to $100 in statement credits per calendar year towards purchases with LoungeBuddy, which allows travelers to access airport lounges around the world\n\n\u2022 Up to $100 in statement credits towards purchases with luggage retailer Away, through Jan. 15, 2020\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing more cards earning 3 to 4 points per dollar on these kinds of spending categories, which are very millennial-friendly indeed,\u201d said Sara Rathner, credit cards expert at NerdWallet.\n\nThe rewards categories aren\u2019t the only ways that Amex is attempting to appeal to younger consumers with the revamped card. The card will also be the first from Amex to integrate with Venmo and PayPal PYPL, +2.17% so that card holders can split the bill with friends and family when they use the Green Card for a group expense.\n\nAdditionally, the physical card itself will be made primarily from \u201creclaimed\u201d plastic collected from beaches, islands and other coastal communities, as part of Amex\u2019s broader sustainability initiatives.\n\n\u201cWe hope Green from Amex will serve as a daily reminder to our Card Members to do their part to back our oceans and consider how they can reduce the use of plastic in their own lives,\u201d Rachel Stocks, executive vice president of global premium products and benefits at American Express, said in the company\u2019s announcement.\n\nCredit cards are becoming more like subscription products\n\nThe Green Card will now come with an annual fee of $150, significantly higher than the previous fee of $95.\n\nFees like these are becoming increasingly common. During the company\u2019s earnings call last week, Amex CEO and Chairman Steve Squeri noted that 70% of the cards the company issued over this year had an annual fee, which he said provided the company with \u201crecurring subscription-like revenues.\u201d\n\nWhen you combine the annual fees with the interchange fees credit-card companies earn from merchants every time a customer swipes their card, \u201cthat\u2019s a solid return even before factoring in the interest that many card holders pay,\u201d Rossman said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Here\u2019s everything Apple isn\u2019t telling you about its new credit card\n\nMore and more consumers have learned how to \u201cgame\u201d credit cards to earn the most in rewards without paying much or anything in interest. Implementing or raising annual fees is one way that credit-card companies can claw back some of the money they lose as a result.\n\nRising annual fees though mean that consumers must do more leg work to ensure they\u2019re truly better off signing up for a given card. As Rathner noted on the Green Card, other credit cards reward customers at similar rates for dining out or travel with lower fees. \u201cWhenever a consumer considers a new credit card, they should ignore the hype and really think about what they can get for the price they\u2019ll pay,\u201d she said.", "description": "Amex\u2019s Green Card got a makeover and switched from being a charge card to a credit card.", "authors": ["Jacob Passy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU032_greenc_MG_20191025113940.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
