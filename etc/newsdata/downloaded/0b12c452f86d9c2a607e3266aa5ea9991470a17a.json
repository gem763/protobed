The influence of this twisted view appears in the distortions, both subtle and blatant, in the 1619 essay by Hannah-Jones.\n\nIt\u2019s worth delving into these in some detail. They reveal what makes the 1619 project not just an an effort to shine a light on a terrible part of our past but a much more ambitious, ideologically driven attempt to redefine our history.\n\nThere is much truth in the Hannah-Jones essay, and much to learn from it. One of her central points, that African Americans have been great American freedom fighters and are more American in this sense \u2014 and in their tenure in America \u2014 than many European Americans, is profoundly true, and movingly expressed.\n\nYet if you are advancing what purports to be a more accurate history, you shouldn\u2019t distort the record and elide inconvenient facts.", "description": "Today on the homepage, I return to the '1619 project.'", "authors": ["Rich Lowry", "Andrew C.
