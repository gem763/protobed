(Photo: Courtesy of Jessie Jean's Historic 25th)\n\n\n\n\n\nA homeless man was photographed changing a single mom\u2019s flat tire and his sweet favor is getting recognition online.\n\nOn September 23, Anna Davidson, the owner of Jessie Jean\u2019s Historic 25th cafe in Ogden, Utah, posted a Facebook photo her husband snapped from their apartment above the establishment they have run for 20 years. The image has received more than 2,000 reactions.\n\n\u201cLooked out the window to see this happening. This is Chuck...he's homeless and works his a** off helping every day in the cafe. This is \u2018one of those people\u2019 that get labeled. Ya know the ones everyone wants outta sight, outta mind.. I didn't see anyone else out helping this young lady, just Chuck...the homeless guy...thank you Chuck.\u201d She wrote the hashtags #findthekind and #kindnessmatters.\u201d\n\nCharles Logan, a.k.a., Chuck is a local homeless man and former convict who visits the restaurant every day with his wife Crystal. Chuck has been a staple at the establishment since April when the couple caught word of Jessie Jean\u2019s \u201cPay It Forward\u201d meals, a program Davidson launched during the government shut-down in December.\n\n\u201cWe have about 5,000 government workers living in Ogden so when they couldn\u2019t work, it was traumatic,\u201d Davidson tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cWe figured, \u2018If we\u2019re going to lose our business, we may as well help people on our way out.\u201d The owners advertised a special for $2 coffee and beignets and with local donations, continued the program, which attracted some homeless people.\n\nDavidson says not everyone in her community has supported her invitation to the homeless community. \u201cI was like, \u2018f*** that,\u2019\u201d she tells Yahoo Lifestyle. She continued the program seven days a week, inspired to break stereotypes about people in need. Customers have the option of adding a \u201cPay it forward\u201d meal on their bills, to be served the following day.\n\n\u201cI felt like the universe was telling me to do this,\u201d says Davidson.\n\nIn exchange for his help around the restaurant \u2014 sweeping, sanitizing, and doing the dishes \u2014 Chuck receives meals. \u201cHe\u2019s a safety net around here,\u201d says Davidson. Her goal for Chuck is that he lands housing and a full-time job. She also hopes to stop the stigmatization of homeless people.\n\nShuree Michelle, the recipient of Chuck\u2019s gesture, says when her tire blew in the middle of road, no one stopped to assist her. \u201cOut comes this guy and he asked if I had a spare tire and a jack,\u201d she tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cHe didn\u2019t hesitate to help \u2014 it was very sweet.\u201d Shuree says she gave him a $10 for his troubles.\n\nChuck says he was \u201csupposed\u201d to help that day, telling Yahoo Lifestyle, \u201cTreat people as they would like to be treated, with respect.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\n\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "Chuck, a homeless man in Utah, was photographed changing a single mom's tire.", "authors": ["Elise Sol\u00e9"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/XNxs3Tc6L0U6abHIFAGTIQ--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTA4MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/6e0b5400-e7af-11e9-bf75-c5cce5243fb6", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
