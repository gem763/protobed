Hopefully it\u2019s a good lesson for other people as well,\u201d added Marsh, whose blunder could open the door for Marcus Stoinis in Brisbane.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s a game of cricket. Sometimes you get beaten, sometimes you get out, and you can\u2019t be punching walls.\u201d\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "All-rounder Mitchell Marsh is set to miss the opening Test against Pakistan after fracturing his right hand punching a wall, with Australian coach Justin Langer branding him \"an idiot\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/AR-190919692-1.jpgMaxW780imageVersion16by9NCS_modifiedexif-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
