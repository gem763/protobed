Maybe you wondered it when you heard that cover of \u201cYellow\u201d in Crazy Rich Asians or read that Tina Turner herself is a fan of the band. Well, the band has a perfectly reasonable explanation: Chris Martin & Co. have been working, for the last 100 years in fact, on a project called Everyday Life, they write in a letter to fans. If you thought a title couldn\u2019t express an arena-rock band\u2019s hope in humanity, just wait \u2014 it\u2019s actually a double album, with one record called Sunrise and one called Sunset. \u201cIt is sort of how we feel about things,\u201d the band writes of their first full-length since 2015\u2019s A Head Full of Dreams. Coldplay is also teasing the November 22 release with old-timey, 1919-themed art of the band, like a poster fittingly found on the \u201cYellow\u201d line in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. As if that all wasn\u2019t enough, on November 22, 1919, the longest annular solar eclipse in over 250 years occurred, sticking with the sun motif. So if you can\u2019t tell by now: Coldplay is back, same as ever.\n\nColdplay's 'November 22, 1919' teaser poster was found at the Paulista metro station in S\u00e3o Paulo....
