The discord pits hawkish northern European members of the eurozone against dovish southern Europeans.\n\nUnlike the earlier euro area conflict where Greece, Italy and Spain were debtors who had to follow the orders of their north European creditors, this time the southerners are winning the battle. After all, it was an Italian, outgoing President Mario Draghi, who pushed the ECB into quantitative easing and negative interest rates, unorthodox means to counter sluggish growth and limp inflation.\n\nFrance straddles the north and south, but French President Emmanuel Macron is not going along with Germany\u2019s reactionary economic and monetary policy. He blocked the appointment of Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann to succeed Draghi, and instead got the job for his compatriot, IMF Chair Christine Lagarde, bringing a dove to the helm of the central bank.\n\nDraghi, for his part, doubled down on his strategy as he was headed out the door. In the ECB\u2019s September , he pushed through a reduction of the interest rate on bank deposits moving it further into negative territory. He also relaunched the bank\u2019s asset-buying program.\n\nThe bond-buying program is what triggered Lautenschl\u00e4ger\u2019s resignation, throwing a wrench into the delicate personnel dance to keep the ECB board balanced. As well it's caused a slump in the , which has yet to recover.\n\nEUR/USD 60 Minute Chart\n\nEuro finance ministers had pretty well decided to replace Beno\u00eet C\u0153ur\u00e9, whose term expires in December, with Fabio Panetta, senior deputy governor of the Banca d\u2019Italia.\n\nThus France and Italy would maintain representation on the board. Germany, too, as the largest economy in the EU, feels entitled to representation, so Lautenschl\u00e4ger\u2019s replacement will have to be German.\n\nGiven the ongoing gender disparity at the ECB\u2014Lautenschl\u00e4ger is the only woman on the 25-member governing council, and Lagarde\u2019s arrival hardly makes the case for parity\u2014the preference would be for a German woman.\n\nThat choice will signal how willing EU leaders are to tamp down this brewing crisis. Germany has a chance to back down and nurse its wounds until it is in a stronger position again by appointing someone more dovish.\n\nOf course, in Germany, that's a relative term. Claudia Buch, Vice President at the Bundesbank, would probably fall into the hawkish camp. She succeeded Lautenschl\u00e4ger in that position in 2014 when the latter went to the ECB and has worked side by side with uber-hawk Weidmann since then.\n\nBuch had been a member of the German Council of Economic Experts (historically known as the Five Wise Men) for two years and was tipped as a possible candidate for the ECB board seat that eventually went to Lautenschl\u00e4ger.\n\nIsabel Schnabel, a Bonn professor who joined the Council of Economic Experts as Buch was leaving, is also mentioned as a possible candidate. She might be somewhat more dovish than Buch, but she has also been critical of ECB monetary policy. A third potential female candidate is Elga Bartsch, who is currently head of macro research at Blackrock after a career at Morgan Stanley.\n\nAll three women have doctorates in economics and would bring a different perspective from Lautensch\u00e4ger's to the ECB. Her background is in banking supervision (she headed the ECB\u2019s Supervisory Board for years).\n\nAt the very least, their positions on monetary policy could be more nuanced. (For the record, potential male candidates include think tank director Marcel Fratzcher, finance ministry official J\u00f6rg Kukies, and Frankfurt professor Volker Wieland.)\n\nThe ECB\u2019s new chief economist, former Central Bank of Ireland Governor Philip Lane, is considered more dovish than his Dutch predecessor Peter Praet while Italy's Panetta, as a southern European, is by definition on the dovish spectrum.\n\nDovish or not, the newly constituted executive board will have to deal with growing opposition in Germany\u2014not only among monetary officials, but among bankers and even the public\u2014to the ECB\u2019s accommodative monetary policy. Lagarde will need all the diplomatic skills attributed to her to span this growing rift between the north and the south.", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by Investing.com (Darrell Delamaide/Investing.com) covering: EUR/USD.
