Hoping for the same luck with Week 8! USA TODAY\n\nThe New England Patriots are parting with Michael Bennett after suspending the defensive end for their latest game.\n\nThe Patriots are trading Bennett to the Dallas Cowboys in exchange for a conditional seventh-round draft pick, ESPN's Adam Schefter and Jordan Schultz reported.\n\nBennett was suspended by the team last Tuesday for one week after he had a disagreement with defensive line coach Bret Bielema.\n\n\"It is what it is, man,\" Bennett said Wednesday when asked about his current feelings about playing on the Patriots. \"It's up to the team [about the possibility of being traded], how they feel about it. I like playing here.\"\n\nNFL trade deadline: Seven deals that teams should make in 2019\n\nA three-time Pro Bowl selection, Bennett was acquired by the Patriots in March but had seen his role on the team dwindle as the season progressed. He participated in just 11 defensive snaps in the Patriots' Week 6 win over the New York Giants.\n\nBennett has recorded 5 tackles and 2 1/2 sacks so far this season.\n\nIn Dallas, Bennett likely will serve as a backup to defensive ends DeMarcus Lawrence and Robert Quinn while also contributing on the inside during sub packages. He could also help fill in for Tyrone Crawford, who was placed on injured reserve with a hip ailment.\n\nBennett will be reunited with Cowboys defensive passing game coordinator Kris Richard after the two worked together on the Seattle Seahawks. Richard served as defensive coordinator from 2015-17, the three years in which Bennett was selected to the Pro Bowl.\n\nThe NFL's trade deadline is on Oct. 29.\n\nFollow Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz on Twitter @MikeMSchwartz.", "description": "The Patriots are moving on from Michael Bennett by sending the defensive end to the Cowboys after his one week suspension from the team.", "authors": ["Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz", "Published P.M.
