(Photo: Getty stock image)\n\nFor many people, getting the perfect Instagram shot has become a staple while on vacation. But one woman's quest to take the perfect photo put her in danger \u2014 and a cruise line responded by kicking her off the ship.\n\nThe New York Times reports that an unnamed woman aboard a Royal Caribbean cruise liner climbed onto a balcony to take a picture, with the help of a friend. While she was apparently unharmed, the cruise line has a strict policy about customers climbing onto railings. So when a third passenger, Peter Blosic, took another picture of the dangerous escapade and showed it to the ship employees, the crew kicked the two friends off the ship, and they're now banned for life.\n\n\"Earlier this week on the Allure of the Seas a guest was observed recklessly and dangerously posing for a photo by standing on her stateroom balcony railing with the help of her companion,\" Royal Caribbean said in a statement provided to CNN. \"Security was notified and the guests were later debarked in Falmouth, Jamaica as a result of their actions and are now banned for life from sailing with Royal Caribbean.\"\n\nRoyal Caribbean didn't immediately respond to Yahoo's request for comment. The incident happened aboard the Allure of the Seas cruise ship en route to Labadee, Haiti, according to the Times.\n\nAnd while this incident may not have been a strict \"selfie\" \u2014 it sounds like the woman had the help of a friend to capture her photo \u2014 there have been plenty of other injuries and even fatalities that have resulted from efforts to take the perfect shots.\n\nIn May, a college student died while taking a selfie atop an Oregon cliff. And a study cited by the Times found that more than 250 people across the globe have died in selfie-related accidents since 2011.\n\nRelated: 75-Year-Old Cruise Passenger Jumped Ship Between Portugal, Spain\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "A woman climbed onto a cruise ship railing for a perfect shot \u2014 and got a lifelong ban from Royal Caribbean.", "authors": ["Meghan Demaria"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/pqiwv.ZXaFmJJSZHBfvgLg--~B/aD0yNzQ2O3c9NDEyNztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/a9d67c10-f350-11e9-89ff-382c826c70d2", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
