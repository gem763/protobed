It could be a couple of poor performances and the lead\u2019s gone. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so special to win the league.\u201d\n\nLiverpool host Arsenal in a fourth-round League Cup encounter on Wednesday before resuming their Premier League campaign at promoted Aston Villa on Saturday.", "description": "Last season's triumphant Champions League campaign has given Liverpool the confidence and belief they can win the Premier League this season, midfielder James Milner has said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446076170&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S09G", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
