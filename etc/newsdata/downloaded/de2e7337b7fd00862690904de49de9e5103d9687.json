That is, assuming the candidate prepared for the event.\n\nCNN devoted seven hours to some of the Democrats running for their party\u2019s presidential nomination. It turned out to be one long in-kind donation to the re-election of President Trump. I was able to dip in and out of a couple of the candidate\u2019s interviews and oh, boy. What an experience that turned out to be. The candidates are hell-bent to out-crazy one another when it comes to grandiose ideas about saving the planet. There is no idea too outlandish for them and no limit to taxpayer money they are willing to commit to it.\n\nJoe Biden was first up during the prime time hours \u2013 7:00 P.M. Central Time. His host was Anderson Cooper. The lesser candidates went first in the late afternoon time slots with host Wolf Blitzer. The three candidates with an actual shot at the Democrat nomination \u2013 Biden, Sanders, and Warren \u2013 were among those in prime time. Biden went first because I assume he had an early bedtime to get to.\n\nThings took an awkward turn when Cooper questioned Biden about a fundraiser scheduled for Thursday co-hosted by Andrew Goldman, a co-founder of Western LNG. LNG is liquified natural gas. Natural gas is brought to us by the fossil fuel industry. Liquefied natural gas is natural gas that has been cooled down to liquid form to make it easy and safe for non-pressurized storage or transport. Western LNG, according to the company\u2019s website is a Houston-based energy company that delivers affordable Canadian natural gas to overseas markets.\n\nUncle Joe feigned ignorance, or maybe it isn\u2019t an act, and when Anderson Cooper explained Goldman\u2019s tie to the fossil fuel industry, Biden said he\u2019d look into that. He said he\u2019d been assured that Goldman wasn\u2019t an energy sector executive.\n\nThe former vice president told the CNN host Anderson Cooper that Mr. Goldman was not listed as an executive in fossil fuel company filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201cThat\u2019s what we look at,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Biden said. Mr. Cooper, who seemed apprised in advance of the issue raised by the audience member, pressed Mr. Biden, saying Mr. Goldman \u201chas a company called Western LNG\u201d that announced it was building an offshore terminal in western Canada to export natural gas. \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t realize he does that,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Biden replied. \u201cI\u2019m going to look at what you just told me and find out if that\u2019s accurate.\u2019\n\nA senior adviser to Biden\u2019s campaign, Symone D. Sanders, quickly tweeted out that Cooper had it wrong and Goldman isn\u2019t an executive in the company.\n\nWhat @andersoncooper just said about VP Biden's fundraiser is factually incorrect. Andrew Goldman isn't a fossil fuel executive. He's not involved in the day to day operation. He's not on the board of the company, nor the board of the portfolio company. \u2014 Symone D. Sanders (@SymoneDSanders) September 5, 2019\n\nThat\u2019s an interesting take from the campaign. Looking at the website, under the \u201cAbout\u201d tab, Andrew Goldman is described as a founder of the company. His background is described as one in finance and investment. Are we to believe that he simply founded a company using his background in investments in the energy sector and then just faded into the background? Maybe but that doesn\u2019t sound logical.\n\nThere is this little nugget on that website page, too. He\u2019s no stranger to Biden.\n\nPrior to founding De Cordova Goldman Holdings, Mr. Goldman served as an advisor to Senator Joseph R. Biden III until his inauguration as Vice President of the United States in early 2009.\n\nIt all just sounds fishy. It sounds like Team Biden got caught trying to dance around the perimeters of the agreement all the Democrat candidates signed onto, a No Fossil Fuel Money pledge.\n\nDavid Turnbull, a spokesman for the group Oil Change U.S., which is involved in the \u201cNo Fossil Fuel Money\u201d pledge that Mr. Biden and other candidates have signed, said that while the fund-raiser with Mr. Goldman \u201cmay not technically violate the \u2018No Fossil Fuel Money\u2019 pledge as we have defined it, it pretty clearly goes against the spirit of the pledge.\u201d \u201cWe defined the rules of the pledge with the intent of making it easier for candidates to live up to it, not to provide loopholes for candidates to exploit in order to keep raising funding from fossil fuel related sources,\u201d Mr. Turnbull said.\n\nAt the end of Biden\u2019s segment of the televised event, Anderson Cooper tried one last time to get a straight answer out of Biden about his relationship with Goldman as a fundraiser. He threw his staff under the bus.\n\nAt the end of Mr. Biden\u2019s segment during the climate forum, which included 10 top Democratic presidential candidates, Mr. Cooper returned to the topic to clarify that Mr. Goldman \u201ccurrently doesn\u2019t have day to day responsibilities\u201d in the gas exporter. Mr. Biden said his campaign vets every contribution. \u201cWhat I was told by my staff is that he did not have any responsibility related to the company,\u201d he said, referring to Mr. Goldman. \u201cHe was not on the board, he was not involved at all in the operation of the company at all. But if that turns out to be true, then I will not in any way accept his help.\u201d\n\nSymone Sanders played clean-up on Twitter. Here\u2019s the clip of the final attempt by Cooper to get an answer from Biden.\n\nAt the end of VP Biden\u2019s time on stage, Anderson Cooper clarified that Andrew Goldman is in fact NOT a fossil fuel exec. pic.twitter.com/Ryn7zxQFiM \u2014 Symone D. Sanders (@SymoneDSanders) September 5, 2019\n\nJoe\u2019s going to have to get better on his feet than that when he gets blindsided by a question. He is still a bad candidate, even after decades of serving in elected office. He truly is the Hillary Clinton of 2020.", "description": "Awkward", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/JoeBiden.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
