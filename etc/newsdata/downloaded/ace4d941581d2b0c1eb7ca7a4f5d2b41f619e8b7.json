She founded an institute compiling data on gender bias in 2004.\n\nShe called on filmmakers to immediately go back to their ongoing projects and \u201ccross out a bunch of names of ensemble characters and supporting characters and make them female.\u201d\n\nDirector and actress Olivia Wilde said Davis \u201cwas ahead of the #TimesUp conversation by about 20 years.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe really bangs the drum on this issue\u2026 She\u2019s the real deal,\u201d Wilde told AFP.\n\nWertmuller, 91, finally received an honorary Oscar more than four decades after she became the first woman nominated for best director.\n\nShe collected the statuette flanked by fellow Italian screen legends Sophia Loren and Isabella Rossellini, who translated Wertmuller\u2019s call for the award to be given a new, more feminine name.\n\n\u201cShe would like to call it \u2018Anna.\u2019 Women in the room, please scream, \u2018We want Anna, a female Oscar!\u2019\u201d said Rossellini.\n\nThe origin of the nickname \u201cOscar\u201d is unclear, but is thought to derive from the statuette\u2019s likeness to a male relative of an early Academy member.\n\n\u2013 \u2018About time\u2019 \u2013\n\nStars at the glitzy ceremony in Hollywood\u2019s Ray Dolby Ballroom included Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks, Quentin Tarantino, Eddie Murphy, Scarlett Johansson and Jennifer Lopez.\n\n\u201cLast of the Mohicans\u201d star Wes Studi became the first Native American actor to receive an Oscar.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d simply like to say \u2014 it\u2019s about time,\u201d said Studi, to a raucous ovation. \u201cIt\u2019s been a wild and wonderful ride,\u201d he added.\n\nStudi was introduced by Joy Harjo, the first Native American US poet laureate, and actor Christian Bale, who called it a \u201clong overdue moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cToo few opportunities in film, on both sides of the camera, have gone to native or indigenous artists \u2014 we are a room full of people who can change that,\u201d said Bale, who starred with Studi in 2017\u2019s \u201cHostiles.\u201d\n\nThe #OscarsSoWhite protests surrounding the 2016 Oscars drew attention to the awards\u2019 diversity issues.\n\nStudi\u2019s award comes almost half a century after Marlon Brando declined his best actor Oscar for \u201cThe Godfather\u201d in protest at the movie industry\u2019s treatment of Native Americans.\n\nCanadian indigenous musician Buffy Sainte-Marie shared a best original song Oscar in 1982.\n\nThe night kicked off with an honorary Oscar for David Lynch, the surrealist auteur who has been nominated three times for best director but never won.\n\nRegarded as one of the greatest American filmmakers of his generation, Lynch is the enigmatic director of cult classics such as \u201cBlue Velvet\u201d and \u201cMulholland Drive,\u201d as well as television\u2019s \u201cTwin Peaks.\u201d\n\nHe was introduced by Laura Dern and Kyle MacLachlan, who have both acted in several of his films.\n\nThe pair paid tribute to Lynch as a \u201cmodern Renaissance man.\u201d\n\n\u201cDavid is a man who dares to invent and to create and challenge himself, every single day,\u201d said Dern.\n\nThe honorary Oscars are handed out every year to honor lifetime achievement, and were spun off into a separate event in 2009 to declutter the main show\u2019s packed schedule.", "description": "Los Angeles (AFP) \u2013 Hollywood\u2019s female filmmakers set out plans to achieve gender equality Sunday as actress Geena Davis and director Lina", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/28/9c1114_lina-wertmuller-91-finally-received-an-honorary-oscar-decades-she-woman-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
