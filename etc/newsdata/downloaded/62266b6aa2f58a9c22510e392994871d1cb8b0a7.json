The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has identified at least 18 confirmed deaths and 1,080 probable cases across 48 states and the U.S. Virgin Islands as of last Tuesday. Most patients identified vaped THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, according to the CDC. Seventeen percent said they exclusively used nicotine.\n\nE-cigarettes have exploded in popularity over the past few years, particularly among teens. Critics of the product have argued that flavored e-cigarettes made by companies like Juul are designed to appeal to teens directly.\n\nWith usage rising to a level the FDA has called an \"epidemic\" and heightened scrutiny, the Trump administration is readying a federal ban on flavored e-cigarettes. Michigan, San Francisco, and Boulder, Colorado, have banned flavored e-cigarettes. Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire and former New York mayor, pledged $160 million to help enact similar restrictions around the country.\n\nWalmart said in September it will stop selling e-cigarettes in its Walmart and Sam's Clubs location, citing \"regulatory complexity.\" Rite Aid in April said it would stop selling e-cigarettes in all stores.\n\nRetailers have been increasingly taking action to regulate the sale of controversial products before federal regulation has been enacted.\n\nWalmart, Walgreens and Rite Aid earlier this year announced plans to raise the minimum age to buy tobacco to 21, after a dozen states had already done so through legislation.\n\nOfficials at Kroger and Walgreens confirmed both companies will continue to sell tobacco products in their stores.", "description": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has identified at least 18 confirmed deaths due to a mysterious vaping disease.
