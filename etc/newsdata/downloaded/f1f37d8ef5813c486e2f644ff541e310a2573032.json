It\u2019s time we introduced a guarantee on cash.\u2019\n\nPersonal finance expert Martyn James, of Resolver, added: \u2018It is a sign of the immense impact Barclays\u2019 decision will have that people, who felt they were pressured into switching their card accounts to the bank, might now struggle to get hold of their cash.\n\nAccess to cash is absolutely crucial \u2013 and the failure to allow people to get hold of vital payments like pensions or benefits can have potentially life-changing consequences.\u2019\n\nPensioners have become more reliant on basic cash services at the Post Office because of the closure of thousands of bank branches around the country.\n\nMore than 3,312 high street bank and building society branches closed their doors between January 2015 and August this year.\n\nAt least 481 were Barclays branches, according to Which? magazine.\n\nLetters sent by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) telling users they must switch to a bank do not mention that Barclays will not allow its customers to withdraw cash at the Post Office from January [File photo]\n\nIn the face of government pressure, many pensioners have refused to close their Post Office card accounts \u2013 saying they do not trust banks.\n\nFather-of-two Roland Howes, a retired manufacturing engineer in his 70s, who lives in Clanfield, Hampshire, has had his card account since he retired in 2005.\n\nHe said: \u2018I want as little to do with banks as possible, I want to keep my Post Office card.
