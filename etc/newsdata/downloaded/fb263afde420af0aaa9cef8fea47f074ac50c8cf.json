Perhaps the most emphatic flash sign comes with the college demographic. According to the latest Axios/College Reaction poll, 76% of college students support impeachment. That number has soared from just 52% in late May.\n\nHoming in on support for impeachment across parties italicizes the upward trend. In our latest polling, here's how each party comes down on impeachment:\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent support for impeachment (by party)\n\n\u2022 Democrats: 97% of Democratic students approve of the impeachment inquiry of President Trump.\n\n\u2022 GOP: 22% of Republican students approve of impeachment.\n\n\u2022 Independents: 76% of Independent students approve of impeachment.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the story comes into starker relief when we compare this week's numbers to late May.\n\n\n\n\n\nCollege students - May vs. October\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 28th October 8th Net +/-\n\n\n\n\n\nDems 71% 97% +26\n\nIndependents 44% 76% +32%\n\nGOP 16% 22% +6%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe biggest movement is among Independents, who now support impeachment as much as Democrats did 3 months ago. Democratic students have shifted to a near-unanimous chorus in support of impeachment. And while Republican students don't support the inquiry at comparable rates, even their support has ticked up 6 percentage-points.\n\nHere's how students' support for impeachment fits with the broader public, as defined by 538's impeachment support model:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollege students vs. General Public\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents General public\n\n\n\n\n\nDems 97% 84%\n\nIndependents 76% 45%\n\nGOP 22% 14%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the party sub-currents swirl and ultimately settle, we'll understand how likely impeachment (and possible removal) actually is. The number to watch will be what percentage of Republicans and Independents across age brackets convert gentle apprehension into active support for impeachment.\n\n\n\n\n\nKey findings:\n\n\n\n\n\nAxios/College Reaction Poll | October 8th-10th | n=850 | m.o.e: +/- 3.3%\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 76% of college students approve of impeachment of President Trump\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 22% of Republican students approve of impeachment of President Trump\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 76% of Independent students approve of impeachment of President Trump\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 97% of Democratic students approve of impeachment of President Trump\n\n\n\n\n\nMethodology:\n\nData in this report are generated from a poll conducted between October 8th-10th, 2019.
