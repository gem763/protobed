The downtown district is pictured in Nashville\n\n(Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence fell by the most in nine months in September, far more than expected, as Americans' economic outlooks darkened in the face of the U.S.-China trade war, according to a private sector report released on Tuesday.\n\nThe Conference Board, an industry group, said its index of consumer attitudes fell to 125.1, from an downwardly revised 134.2 the month before.\n\nThe 49 economists polled by Reuters had expected a reading of 133.5. September's reading marked the largest shortfall relative to Wall Street's expectations since 2010.\n\n\"The escalation in trade and tariff tensions in late August appears to have rattled consumers,\" Lynn Franco, Senior Director of Economic Indicators at The Conference Board, said in a statement.\n\nThe reading for the month prior was revised down to 134.2 from 135.1.\n\nThe expectations index \u2013 based on consumers\u2019 short-term outlook for income, business and labor market conditions \u2013 declined to 95.8 in September from 106.4 last month.", "description": "U.S. consumer confidence plunges in September", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8N1B2_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
