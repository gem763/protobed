Photograph: Supplied\n\nIn a report released this week, he said their use was \u201cinherently traumatic\u201d and not consistent with the \u201cobjects and guiding principles of the youth justice system\u201d.\n\nSpit hoods have been used at the Adelaide Youth Training Centre (AYTC) since 2014 and their use has been recorded since 2016. Between October 2016 and June 2019 they were used on 57 occasions against 22 kids. One-third of all reported uses of spit hoods were against the one child, who was placed in a spit hood 19 times in nine months.\n\nLines said the hoods were also in breach of international rules around the treatment of prisoners and increased the risk of potentially fatal asphyxiation because children were often pinned in a prone position by several adults to get the hood on their head. The use of spit hoods has been linked to deaths in custody in the UK and United States.\n\nLines reviewed the CCTV of 12 incidents where spit hoods were applied, during which children aged between 12 and 17 were restrained by a number of adult staff members.\n\nIn one case, a 13-year-old girl was pinned to the floor by five staff members who put a spit hood on her head and handcuffed her hands behind her back, after she refused to go to bed.\n\nIn another, 12 staff members went into a cell of a 17-year-old boy, which was not covered by CCTV, and emerged four minutes later with the boy handcuffed and wearing a spit hood. Both the boy and one staff member were later taken to hospital for assessment.\n\nIn every case but one, the child was forced to the floor at some point during the interaction.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Five workers hold a 13-year-old child to the floor as a spit hood is applied.\n\n\u201cChildren thrash about at the sight of the implement; some appear to be taken by surprise as it passes over their eyes; many appear to be crying when it is finally removed,\u201d Lines said.\n\n\u201cHaving reviewed the footage supplied to my investigation, I have no doubt that the application of a spit hood is an inherently traumatic event for the child or young person involved.\u201d\n\nOther states require that staff wear safety goggles and disposable surgical masks when handling detainees to mitigate the risk of contracting a blood-borne disease.\n\nDeaths by prone restraint: family who lost two brothers plead for action Read more\n\nThe SA Department of Human Services, which manages the facility, accepted in-principle recommendations to phase out spit hoods but said that removing them as an option was \u201cproblematic at this time\u201d in \u201ca very specific and limited set of circumstances where other methods such as personal protective equipment are not viable or available\u201d.\n\nIt did not accept a recommendation that legislation governing the management of youth justice facilities should be amended to prohibit or significantly restrict the use of force.\n\nTwo-thirds of the detainees at AYTC are Indigenous.
