From this self-determined position, the president has lobbed numerous theories to preempt the complaint\u2019s potentially damning contents.\n\nTrump Whistleblower Saga Threatens to Blow Up 2020 Campaign\n\nOn Friday, Trump tweeted his first public response to the complaint, claiming that the whistleblower\u2014who is likely someone in the United States intelligence community, but remains anonymous\u2014is \u201chighly partisan.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Radical Left Democrats and their Fake News Media partners, headed up again by Little Adam Schiff, and batting Zero for 21 against me, are at it again! They think I may have had a \u2018dicey\u2019 conversation with a certain foreign leader based on a \u2018highly partisan\u2019 whistleblowers,\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nA day later, Trump addressed the complaint in person for the first time. During an Oval Office appearance alongside Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, whose state visit came at an inopportune time, Trump repeated the partisan claim, and tacked on a familiar criticism of the press, asserting that the national interest in his attempt to muster opposition research from a foreign government somehow stemmed from backlash The New York Times received for its handling of new allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know the identity of the whistleblower, I just hear it\u2019s a partisan person, meaning it comes out from another party, but I don\u2019t have any idea\u2014I can say that it was a totally appropriate conversation, it was actually a beautiful conversation,\u201d Trump said in the Oval Office. \u201c... You know the press has had a very bad week with Justice Kavanaugh, and all of those ridiculous charges, and all of the mistakes made at The New York Times and other places. ... So keep playing it up because you\u2019re going to look really bad when it falls.\u201d\n\nWhen asked by reporters if he had mentioned Biden during his conversation with the Ukrainian president, Trump said he didn\u2019t want to talk about \u201cany conversation, other than to say... great conversation, totally appropriate conversation,\u201d adding, \u201ckeep asking questions and build it up to as big as possible so you can have a bigger downfall.\u201d\n\nThe next day, Trump raised the stakes.\n\n\u201cIt appears that an American spy in one of our intelligence agencies may have been spying on our own president. The complaint suggests that this intel agent was listening in on Trump\u2019s conversation,\u201d Trump tweeted on Saturday, quoting Fox News commentator Gregg Jarrett.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump took the baton from more Fox News commentators, who have focused on the younger Biden\u2019s work in Ukraine. \u201cThe real story involves Hunter Biden going around the world and collecting large payments from foreign governments and foreign oligarchs,\u201d Trump tweeted, quoting Peter Schweizer and Laura Ingraham. \u201cHunter made a fortune in Ukraine and in China. He knew nothing about Energy, or anything else.\u201d\n\nLater that same day, Trump pounced on reports that the whistleblower did not directly hear the call. \u201cNow the Fake News Media says I \u2018pressured the Ukrainian President at least 8 times during my telephone call with him,\u2019\u201d the president tweeted. \u201cThis supposedly comes from a so-called \u2018whistleblower\u2019 who they say doesn\u2019t even have a first hand account of what was said.\u201d\n\nAs a new week began, and interest in the Ukrainian call had only intensified, Trump pivoted to questioning the whistleblower\u2019s motivations, implying they may be working for a foreign entity. \u201cIs he on our Country\u2019s side. Where does he come from,\u201d Trump tweeted on Monday. \u201cIs this all about Schiff & the Democrats again after years of being wrong?\u201d\n\nThe Democrats appeared to respond on Tuesday by announcing that the House of Representatives would move forward with an official impeachment inquiry. \u201cThe president must be held accountable. No one is above the law,\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in announcing the monumental move.", "description": "Jonathan Ernst/ReutersSince news broke Friday of a whistleblower complaint over President Trump asking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate corruption allegations against his political rival, Trump has mounted the best defense: a strong offense.
