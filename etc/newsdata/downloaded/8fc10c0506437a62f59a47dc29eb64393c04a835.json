The source noted that a Senate confirmation hearing would be bruising for Cuccinelli but \"he, [White House adviser] Steve Miller and Trump are all in sync on a number of key policies.\n\n\"They have been trying to clear the way for a while,\" the source said.\n\nIf Trump doesn\u2019t go with Cuccinelli, the source said Trump may go with former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach -- another hardliner who has long been floated for a possible administration position but is currently running for the U.S. Senate.\n\nOne administration official told Fox News on Saturday that Cuccinelli was in \u201cgood standing\u201d for the position.\n\n\u201cKen has been very effective on the regulatory side and he has proven to be a team player who will do every media hit no matter how small or how hostile,\u201d the official said. \u201cKen is someone who hands-down supports and defends the work of the president and the administration.\u201d\n\nTrump may face some resistance from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who has in the past indicated his \"lack of enthusiasm\" for Cuccinelli. That could make getting Cuccinelli confirmed difficult. Cuccinelli was previously president of the Senate Conservatives Fund, which seeks to push more conservative Senate candidates and was therefore often critical of McConnell and his allies.\n\n\"I've not spoken to [Trump] about any of them. I have expressed my, shall I say, lack of enthusiasm for one of them ... Ken Cuccinelli,\" McConnell told reporters in April when Cuccinelli was floated to replace former DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, according to The Hill.\n\nA Cuccinelli pick would also face significant opposition from Senate Democrats. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., declared Cuccinelli \"unfit\" to lead USCIS in August after old remarks emerged of the former Virginia attorney general calling illegal immigrants \"foreign invaders.\"\n\nHowever, a Cuccinelli pick would be welcomed by many conservatives, particularly those focused on immigration and who didn't warm to McAleenan. As head of USCIS since the summer -- an often overlooked agency that deals with bureaucratic issues to do with green card applications and citizenship requests -- Cuccinneli put a hardline stamp on the agency with policies that picked up national attention.\n\nTRUMP ANNOUNCES ACTING HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY MCALEENAN TO LEAVE POST\n\nPerhaps the most striking of those changes was the \u201cpublic charge\u201d rule that toughened and clarified guidance for officials as to when they should deny green cards to immigrants deemed likely to rely on government welfare.\n\nThe rule defined public charge as an immigrant who receives one or more designated benefits for more than 12 months within a 36-month period. It also expanded the number of benefits that could be considered. On Friday, however, the rule was dealt a setback when a federal judge issued a nationwide injunction blocking it from being implemented.\n\n\u201cAn objective judiciary will see that this rule lies squarely within long-held existing law,\u201d Cuccinelli said in response.\n\nIn addition to public charge, Cuccinelli has also pushed a number of significant, and often controversial, changes. Buzzfeed News reported last month that he sought the power to publicize information about migrants being prosecuted for certain crimes. His agency has also tightened rules for awarding work permits to immigrants allowed into the U.S. for humanitarian reasons and has also cut the two-day window between detention and interview to one.\n\nHe has also not shied away from the media glare and from wading into controversies when defending the administration, something that may endear him to the president.\n\nIn August, in defending the public charge rule, he faced questions from reporters that the public charge rule was not in keeping with Emma Lazarus\u2019 \u201cThe New Colossus\u201d -- a sonnet added to the bottom of the Statue of Liberty that has become known for the line: \u201cgive me your tired and poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free...\u201d\n\nAsked separately about the poem\u2019s reference to \u201cwretched refuse,\u201d Cuccinelli commented that the poem was \"referring back to people coming from Europe where they had class-based societies where people were considered wretched if they weren\u2019t in the right class.\" That remark sparked controversy from figures from 2020 hopeful Beto O\u2019Rourke to pop singer Rihanna.\n\nCuccinelli has used his Twitter account (which he operates himself) to challenge the executive of Montgomery County, Md., to a debate over \u201csanctuary city\u201d policies after a series of sex crimes allegedly perpetrated by illegal immigrants.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll defend children and crime victims, Elrich can defend rapists and murders who shouldn\u2019t even be in this country,\u201d he said.\n\nHe has also supported the use of \u201cillegal aliens\u201d to refer to illegal immigrants in U.S. law, even as McAleenan shied away from that term. Measures like that have earned him a reputation that has endeared him to groups in favor of tougher restrictions on immigration.\n\n\"The choice is clear, he must elevate Ken Cuccinelli,\" RJ Hauman, government relations director at the restrictionist Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), told Politico. \"The president understands that the opposition seeks to stop his efforts to secure the border and restore control over our nation\u2019s immigration system through court orders and injunctions. What better force to stop this than the former attorney general of Virginia and one of the most skilled appellate lawyers in the country?\"\n\nFox News' Leland Vittert contributed to this report.", "description": "U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Acting Director Ken Cuccinelli is being seen as a likely replacement for outgoing Department of Homeland Security Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan, sources tell Fox News -- a move that would be welcomed by immigration hardliners.", "authors": ["Adam Shaw"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Ken-Cuccinelli-AP.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
