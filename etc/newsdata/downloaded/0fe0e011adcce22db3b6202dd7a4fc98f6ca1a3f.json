However, yesterday\u2019s data makes clear that slowdown in demand is now fully global and the US may see a further deceleration in months ahead.\n\nToday\u2019s data may provide a clue to the strength of employment demand in the US economy, but the market will really focus on tomorrow ISM Non-Manufacturing report which not only provides the best forecast for monthly Non-Farm payrolls figures due Friday but also will show the state of the service sector which makes up more than 70% of the US economy.\n\nIf tomorrow\u2019s ISM data also misses its mark the sell-off in risk is likely to accelerate hard with potentially falling to the 107.00 level before the end of the week. For now, however, FX majors will likely remain within ranges with USD/JPY testing 107.50 support while tests the 1,0900 level once again as markets try to determine just how severe the global slowdown has become.", "description": "Forex Analysis by Boris Schlossberg covering: EUR/USD, USD/JPY, XAU/USD, DAX.
