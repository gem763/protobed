It wasn\u2019t fair for conservatives to do that to Kyle Kashuv. And it\u2019s certainly not fair for climate activists and the media to do it to Greta Thunberg, who isn\u2019t a Harvard-bound 17 year-old, but a 16 year-old dealing with a myriad of mental health issues that have a documented history of obstructing her daily life.\n\nNo, Greta Thunberg\u2019s mom isn\u2019t making her prepubescent daughter pose naked in men\u2019s magazines. No serious reader could even come close to concluding that I\u2019m saying propping up the girl as a political tool is remotely as bad as doing so for sexual purposes. But is it irresponsible, and for similar reasons, to shove a particularly vulnerable child into the spotlight while knowing the risks of fame? Yes, it is, and it\u2019s sad that Marcotte refuses to evaluate that concern for what it\u2019s really worth.", "description": "", "authors": ["Tiana Lowe", "Washingtonexaminer.Com Opinion Im-Not-Sexist-Or-Sorry-For-Opposing-The-Media-Exploitation-Of-Greta-Thunberg"], "top_image": ""}
