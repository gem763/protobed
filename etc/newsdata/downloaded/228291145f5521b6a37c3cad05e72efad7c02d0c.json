The convenience of multiplayer, especially \u2013 of being able to snap off a controller and hand it over to a new friend you\u2019ve made in the pub or at a party \u2013 is quietly revolutionary in a gaming era dominated by impersonal online play.\n\nBut let\u2019s be honest: you\u2019re not spending much time in the pub or at parties these days, are you? Perhaps your gaming time is mostly stolen, on train journeys or commutes, in bed before passing out while the kids are sleeping. Perhaps you, like me, are currently trying to sneak in a bit of Link\u2019s Awakening while breastfeeding a week-old baby. I know so many parents, myself included, for whom the Switch was a godsend \u2013 it gave us our games back, at a time in life when it\u2019s increasingly difficult to find time for them.\n\nIt might seem strange to bring out a version of the console that lacks its flagship feature: the Switch Lite can\u2019t output to a TV. But it\u2019s a response to how people actually use it. The Switch\u2019s home-or-on-the-go functionality and Joy-Con features might be supremely cool, but quite a lot of players don\u2019t end up using them much. It is for those players that the Switch Lite exists.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Luigi\u2019s Mansion 3, one of this year\u2019s titles available for Switch Lite.

It is light enough to hold up for an hour or two without getting numb pinkies or tired hands, which makes up for the fact that there\u2019s no kickstand to prop it comfortably on a plane tray-table while you play. It is a simple, purpose-built, attractive-looking games machine, and of course it comes with one of the more exciting and varied selections of games around. Nintendo consoles are never the place to look for slick shooters or cutting-edge visuals, but nothing rivals their games for style, fun and creativity, and the Switch\u2019s 2,500-strong game library includes Overwatch, Fortnite and Doom alongside the company\u2019s own and a huge variety of indie games.\n\nSome games won\u2019t work with the Lite, such as mad cardboard invention laboratory Nintendo Labo and party grab-bag 1-2-Switch. Basically, anything that requires you to detach the controllers is out. And for multiplayer, each person would need their own Switch Lite to play, as you can\u2019t detach the controllers to hunt Pok\u00e9mon together or face off in Mario Kart. But that still leaves you with the great majority of Switch games that are worth playing by yourself, including this year\u2019s new Pok\u00e9mon (Sword and Shield), Zelda: Link\u2019s Awakening, Luigi\u2019s Mansion 3, Astral Chain and Fire Emblem \u2013 not to mention all of the marvellous multi-platform independent games (Hollow Knight, Into the Breach and Undertale, to name but three).\n\nIf you already own a Switch, it\u2019s easy to set up all your games and data on the Switch Lite \u2013 though the secondary console will need an internet connection to verify your downloaded purchases. You can get around this by using game carts rather than downloads, but you still need to transfer saves if you want to use both consoles, a process that is hardly seamless. Having two Nintendo Switches is definitely an indulgence, anyway. The Lite is more appealing as a replacement, if you can live without detachable Joy-Cons and TV output, or as a cheaper way to introduce your kids to the many joys of the Switch. As a purpose-built portable games machine, it\u2019s the finest (and prettiest) option around.\n\n\u2022 Nintendo Switch Lite is out now, priced \u00a3199.99", "description": "Nintendo\u2019s stripped-down version does away with the TV output in favour of pure portability \u2013 but the company\u2019s formidable games library remains at your fingertips", "authors": ["Keza Macdonald"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37252f90042469bebd4744ff916e3c52b635ece2/150_1083_5861_3516/master/5861.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=49891b546b2e7355b35a93c4a9497777", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
