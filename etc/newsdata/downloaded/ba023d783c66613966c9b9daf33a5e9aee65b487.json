Prosecutors expected 21 athletes from five different sports to be involved.\n\nFive years ago, Duerr was banned for two years after being sent home from the Sochi Games for failing a doping test. He returned to the circuit in an attempt to qualify for the Nordic worlds in Austria, but all his results since February 2014 have now been declared invalid.\n\nDuerr\u2019s former teammates Max Hauke and Dominik Baldauf and cyclists Georg Preidler and Stefan Denifl have all been banned for four years for their alleged involvement in the doping ring.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Austrian former cross-country skier Johannes Duerr, who was expelled from the 2014 Sochi Olympics for the use of EPO, has been banned for life for his alleged role in a doping network in recent years.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
