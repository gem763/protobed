(The Guardian had it 116-112 for Fury.)\n\nTyson Fury defeats Otto Wallin by unanimous decision \u2013 live! Read more\n\nThe central crisis arose in the third round when Wallin, a largely unknown Swede who went off as a more than 10-1 underdog, connected with a left hand flush on Fury\u2019s right eye that opened up a wide gash and immediately began streaming blood. After the bell the Nevada Athletic Commission confirmed on ringside TV monitors the cut was the result of a punch and not an accidental clash of heads, meaning the 28-year-old Wallin could be declared the winner by technical knockout at any time if the ringside doctor ruled the wound too severe for Fury to continue.\n\nThe Gypsy King navigated a series of hairy moments over the next several rounds as the emboldened Wallin targeted the wound, but Fury imposed his will on the fading underdog from the seventh and made it to the final bell in front of 8,249 spectators at T-Mobile Arena.\n\n\u201cIt is all heart and determination,\u201d said Fury, who landed 179 of 651 blows (28%) according to Compubox\u2019s punch statistics, compared to 127 of 334 (38%) for Wallin. \u201cIf I can keep going I will keep going. He\u2019s a tough guy. I hit him with some chin shots and some body shots, and he kept coming. He [was] undefeated, but tonight I was the man.\u201d\n\nFury (29-0-1, 20 KOs) was slow out of the gate from the opening bell, perhaps content to get rounds in after a two-round destruction of Tom Schwarz his last time out in June. Wallin managed pockets of success in the first two rounds by cutting the distance and finding ways inside the seven-inch reach advantage of Fury, who briefly switched to a southpaw stance in the second.\n\nBy the third Fury started to find his range and tempo, setting up the right hand with feints and scoring consistently with it. But Wallin opened the first and worse of two cuts over Fury\u2019s right eye toward the end of the round, heightening the drama and putting the favorite\u2019s unbeaten record in legitimate peril.\n\nWallin (20-1 with 1 NC, 13 KOs) attacked his wounded prey over the next two rounds sensing his chance, targeting the cut and landing blows at a far higher rate than any recent Fury opponent. Meanwhile, Fury\u2019s attack was stunted as he fought of the back foot and instinctively pawed at the worsening gash. The Swede enjoyed another strong round in the sixth, during which referee Tony Weeks stopped the action to have the ringside physician closely inspect Fury\u2019s cut before allowing the fight to continue.\n\n\u201cI tried to hit it even more,\u201d Wallin said afterward. \u201cI know it was a punch that did it. I was happy that he was cut, but I wish I could have put more pressure on it.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tyson Fury survived a stiff test from Otto Wallin on Saturday night.

He kept the pressure ramped up over the next few rounds, backing up the gassed Wallin with an uppercut at the end of the ninth that left him saved by the bell.\n\nThe Swede appeared to be ready to go in the 11th as Fury poured on the punishment with a series of thudding body shots. But just when it seemed Fury would coast to the finish line, Wallin managed to hurt his opponent with a perfectly timed left hand early in the final round that left the bigger man holding on as the cut spewed blood.\n\n\u201cI did everything I could, I tried my best and Tyson is a great champion,\u201d Wallin said. \u201cIt tells me that no one can question my heart or question that I am a good fighter.\u201d\n\nFury, who ended Wladimir Klitschko\u2019s decade-long title reign four years ago only to surrender all the belts during a 31-month layoff where he underwent public bouts with drugs and mental illness, continues to market himself as the \u201clineal heavyweight champion\u201d, having never lost his titles in the ring. The actual title belts belong to Wilder, who\u2019s owned the WBC\u2019s version of the championship since 2015, and Andy Ruiz Jr, who captured the WBA, WBO and IBF straps with a shocking upset of Anthony Joshua in June.\n\nFury has reportedly already signed an agreement with Wilder for a rematch of their epic split draw from last year, but the scheduled 22 February date will likely be postponed to allow for his cut to fully heal.\n\n\u201cDeontay Wilder, I want you next, bum! It is all preparation,\u201d Fury said. \u201cI had a long time out of the ring, [but] next is the big boy, the big \u2018Bronze Bomber\u2019 on February 22nd.\u201d", "description": "A bloodied Tyson Fury outpointed Otto Wallin on Saturday night in Las Vegas to stay on course for a hotly anticipated rematch with Deontay Wilder", "authors": ["Bryan Armen Graham"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1257c39cc1487914c74c5e7f292d7e1bcf5ae77/0_47_3974_2385/master/3974.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7c110f41a77f34abff587ff0e1efde2d", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
