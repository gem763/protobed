So many images are airbrushed, filtered, or taken in a way to hide imperfections\u2014all of which create a kind of distorted view of reality. Well, Demi Lovato is here to keep it real, and her newest pic is everything.\n\nDemi just posted a bikini photo on Instagram, proudly showing off her cellulite. And guess what? She looks amazing. Taken from behind, the pic shows the \"Sober\" singer's booty front and center, while she gives the camera a seriously fierce look.\n\nBut, in the caption, Demi opened up about how she was actually really nervous about posting the pic. \"This is my biggest fear. A photo of me in a bikini unedited. And guess what, it\u2019s CELLULIT!!!!\" she wrote. \"I\u2019m just literally sooooo tired of being ashamed of my body, editing it (yes the other bikini pics were edited\u2014and I hate that I did that but it\u2019s the truth) so that others think I\u2019m THEIR idea of what beautiful is, but it\u2019s just not me.\"\n\n\"This is what I got,\" she continued. \"I want this new chapter in my life to be about being authentic to who I am rather than trying to meet someone else\u2019s standards. So here\u2019s me, unashamed, unafraid and proud to own a body that has fought through so much and will continue to amaze me when I hopefully give birth one day.\"\n\nDemi also said that she feels \"great\" to be back to work \"while not stressing myself with a strenuous workout schedule before 14 hour days, or depriving myself from a real birthday cake rather than opting for watermelon & whip cream with candles because I was terrified of REAL cake and was miserable on some crazy diet sh*t.\"\n\nSince posting the picture, Demi's gotten a ton of praise from other people, including fellow celebrities like Amy Schumer (who shared Demi\u2019s post on her Instagram Story with the message \"@demilovato is the truth\") and Ashley Graham (who also shared it on her Instagram Story with the message \"I love Demi\"). Plenty of others praised Demi in the comments. \"Look at me like that again\u2026 love yaself,\" wrote Bachelor in Paradise star Mike Johnson. \"You look even better without the editing,\" commented Ronda Rousey.\n\nDemi ended on this shout-it-from-the-rooftops note: \"Anyway, here\u2019s me, RAW, REAL! And I love me. And you should love you too!\" Demi then said that she\u2019s \"not stoked on my appearance BUT I am appreciative of it and sometimes that\u2019s the best I can do. I hope to inspire someone to appreciate their body today too.\"\n\nAnd she already has. Some of Demi's followers responded to her Instagram by posting bikini pics\u2014celebrating every single \"imperfection\"\u2014of their own.\n\nView photos Photo credit: Instagram / Demi Lovato More\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "\"This is my biggest fear.\"", "authors": ["Korin Miller"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/oM0A.7YZsKpNvnVHs2xdOg--~B/aD03MTk7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/hearst_womens_health_52/4a4f990d37638b1d120ff492b8339592", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
