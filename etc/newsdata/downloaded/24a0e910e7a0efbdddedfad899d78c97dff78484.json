Yas queen! And yas queen with you.\n\nWhat? Why are you talking so weirdly? Beyonc\u00e9, I am not worthy to receive you but only say the word and I shall be healed.\n\nSeriously, what\u2019s going on? Wait, hasn\u2019t it started yet?\n\nHasn\u2019t what started yet? The Beyonc\u00e9 mass.\n\nWhat Beyonc\u00e9 mass? O Lord Beyonc\u00e9, holy mother, almighty, everlasting Beyonc\u00e9. Through Blue Ivy thou didst redeem us from sin, giving her \u2026\n\nThis is getting creepy now. Join us in praise: the First Presbyterian Church of Brooklyn and Harlem\u2019s St James Presbyterian are holding Beyonc\u00e9 masses, building upon last April\u2019s inaugural Beyonc\u00e9 mass held in San Francisco\u2019s Grace Cathedral. We must worship Beyonc\u00e9, the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and the majesty, for all that is in the heavens and in the earth is hers.\n\nWorship her? Oh fine, not actually worship, but the mass is an exploration of Christian themes through her art. That takes place in a church.\n\nIs this real? Yes, it\u2019s real. The masses are the brainchild of the Rev Yolanda Norton who, inspired by Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cphysical and emotional and spiritual struggles\u201d, put together a service that uses her story and songs as an alternative to traditional Christian worship.\n\nSo what happens? According to reports, the mass is made up of black female officiants, dancers and singers, and uses sermons and scripture readings to meditate on race and gender among African Americans.\n\nAnd people actually go to this? In droves. The San Francisco mass drew a crowd of 900 to a service that usually only attracts 50. To put it another way, Beyonc\u00e9 is officially 18 times more popular than Jesus.\n\nShould we really be using church services to celebrate Beyonc\u00e9, though? Of course we should. Why wouldn\u2019t we?\n\nBecause she once advocated an irresponsible crash diet? Jesus fasted for 40 days and 40 nights.\n\nFrom Mutya to Beyonc\u00e9: who is the best girl band member of all time? Read more\n\nBecause she has a history of taking huge sums of money from unsavoury characters? Remember that time she got paid $2m to play a concert for Colonel Gaddafi\u2019s son? Oh, come on. Getting rich at any cost is basically the entire point of all religion. Grow up.\n\nFine, OK, you win. Contemporary pop musicians are completely deserving of their own mass. That\u2019s right. And don\u2019t you forget it.\n\nSo does this mean we can also go to Kanye West\u2019s \u201cSunday Services\u201d now? Oh, God, absolutely not. I might be spiritual, but I\u2019m not stupid.\n\nDo say: \u201cBeyonc\u00e9 is the new religion.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t say: \u201cJoin us next week for the inaugural divine Pussycat Dolls liturgy.\u201d", "description": "A service using the star\u2019s story, songs and spiritual struggles has New Yorkers crazy in love after wowing worshippers in San Francisco", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0df6ddcb766413d322bf06394ef9f536dd4f8949/0_151_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=75761c8d816a903686c5696bf126eff2", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
