REUTERS/Mike Blake\n\nWarnerMedia executives want \u201cCirce\u201d to unleash a different power: attracting young viewers to the company\u2019s belated entry in the streaming-video war.\n\nHBO Max, which will be HBO plus movies, original shows, and TV classics such \u201cFriends,\u201d will be available starting this spring to 10 million AT&T customers who are also HBO subscribers in the United States at no extra charge, according to AT&T Chief Operating Officer John Stankey, who disclosed the figures for the first time in an interview with Reuters.\n\nThese are a portion of the customers that currently pay for an AT&T-owned product such as DirecTV or AT&T wireless phone service.\n\nBy 2025, AT&T aims to reach about 80 million global subscribers, with about 50 million in the United States, a source briefed on the plans told Reuters. They are ambitious targets that would be consistent with Netflix Inc\u2019s (NFLX.O) early progress, and in the mid-range of Disney+, Walt Disney Co\u2019s (DIS.N) Netflix rival, set to launch on Nov. 12.\n\nWarnerMedia hopes this service will get a boost in 2021 when it launches an advertising-supported option at a lower cost, insiders said.\n\nAfter it launches the ad-supported option, the company will add live programming on HBO Max.\n\nA long-term goal for HBO Max is to help AT&T retain wireless subscribers, according to executives, and also allow the company to pair wireless and DirecTV satellite data to learn more about consumers \u2014 and in turn, charge higher rates to advertisers.\n\nAs one of the final entries in the streaming wars, HBO Max faces a tough competitive landscape. Although the Warner Brothers archive includes thousands of films and TV series like \u201cThe Shining\u201d and \u201cScooby-Doo,\u201d it does not have the same brand awareness as Disney properties like Pixar or Marvel.\n\nPrice could also be an obstacle: HBO Max is likely to cost slightly more than the $14.99 the company charges for HBO \u2014 significantly more than competing services from Apple Inc (AAPL.O) ($4.99) and Disney ($6.99), and slightly higher than the standard $12.99 Netflix plan.\n\nSelling HBO Max by piggybacking off the entrenched HBO service has its own challenges. Stankey wants to convert HBO\u2019s 35 million U.S. subscriber base, which includes the 10 million customers AT&T controls, to HBO Max. Doing so involves renegotiating deals with current pay TV providers, who may be wary of helping AT&T snatch their video customers.\n\nAnd while AT&T executives believe that HBO Max could reduce churn on its cell phone business to boost profits, the link may not be that clear.\n\n\u201cAT&T hasn\u2019t seen any more improvement (in churn) with wireless/video bundling than Verizon has seen without it,\u201d said MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett.\n\nPATH TO GROWTH\n\nAT&T, saddled with $162 billion in debt, faces a litany of challenges. Activist investor Elliott Management has expressed skepticism about Stankey, considered the heir apparent to CEO Randall Stephenson.\n\nElliott is pressuring AT&T to justify its $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner \u2014 now called WarnerMedia \u2014 which it finalized in February, and to consider unwinding its $48.5 billion purchase of DirecTV, which has rapidly bled subscribers.\n\n\u201cThe success of HBO Max is built on the ability for the company to rationalize why (the companies that AT&T bought) all belong together,\u201d said Stankey earlier this month.\n\nWarnerMedia will announce HBO Max pricing and details on Oct. 29. In interviews with Reuters, Stankey and Robert Greenblatt, chairman of WarnerMedia Entertainment and Direct-to-Consumer, spelled out a plan to aggressively expand HBO\u2019s base.\n\nThe key to that growth is to continue providing content in the style of HBO \u2014 the company defines that as \u201cquality\u201d; industry watchers invariably say \u201csexy\u201d or \u201cedgy\u201d \u2014 to its current over-40 viewers, while expanding to a younger audience that is used to streaming content and does not want to pay for cable.\n\n\u201cWe know there\u2019s 75 million people in the range from two to young adults that are available to us as potential new subscribers that aren\u2019t part of the HBO universe already,\u201d said Greenblatt.\n\nThat focus explains the investment in shows like \u201cCirce\u201d; a \u201cGremlins\u201d animated series; and a reboot of \u201cGossip Girl\u201d that will appeal to the under-40 crowd.\n\nWarnerMedia is also investing in children\u2019s content and will feature \u201cSesame Street\u201d on HBO Max.\n\nEven as it expands beyond traditional HBO programming, executives want to position the new service as something different from Netflix, which AT&T\u2019s Stephenson likened to Walmart at a 2018 investor conference. They use a variety of euphemisms to make that distinction: from \u201cthoughtfully curated\u201d to \u201cNot a Walmart\u201d to \u201cPremium.\u201d They bristle at \u201cgeneral interest.\u201d\n\nAnother opportunity to expand is by promoting HBO Max to DirecTV customers who do not already subscribe to HBO. \u201cWe didn\u2019t buy DirecTV because we love satellite,\u201d said Stankey. \u201cWe bought DirecTV because we love the customer base and the customer base could be migrated into more on-demand-oriented products and services.\u201d\n\nFILE PHOTO: HBO logo is on display during an Apple event in San Francisco, California, U.S., March 9, 2015. REUTERS/Robert Galbraith/File Photo\n\nStankey also hinted at the possibility of bundling HBO Max with AT&T wireless subscriptions. T-Mobile gives away Netflix to some customers, and Verizon is providing a free year of Disney+ to some customers.\n\nOn Tuesday Stankey, Greenblatt and others will reveal their plans to investors, on the same stage where Warner Brothers shot actress Judy Garland\u2019s comeback film \u201cA Star is Born.\u201d\n\nTheir performance will help determine AT&T\u2019s future.", "description": "In the bestselling novel \"Circe\" -- optioned by WarnerMedia for its forthcoming HBO Max streaming service -- the daughter of the Greek god Helios tames wild beasts and menaces the gods.", "authors": ["Helen Coster", "Kenneth Li", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444819089&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O0ON", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
