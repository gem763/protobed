Respondents were nearly evenly split in their preferences between Pence and Trump, with nearly 40% preferring either option.\n\nThe amount of support for Pence is atypical: Usually, voters are not especially opinionated when it comes to vice presidents. Previous polling from Gallup has shown that Pence has higher net favorability \u2014 the percentage point difference between favorability and unfavorability \u2014 than Trump, while the previous two administrations were characterized by higher favorability for the president.\n\nTrump has GOP backing, but even Republicans have doubt\n\nAmong respondents who plan to vote in their state's Republican primary or caucus, more had faith in Trump than Pence. Sixty-one percent of Republican voters thought Trump would make a better president than Pence, while 23.3% thought the opposite. Just under 16% said they didn't know. (The majority of Democrats, on the other hand, thought Pence would outperform Trump in the role.)\n\nThough most Republicans prefer Trump, 61% \u2014 under two-thirds \u2014 is a lukewarm majority from a sitting president's own party.\n\nSince the beginning of his presidency, Trump has maintained a high level of approval from Republicans, at a rate hovering consistently between 87 and 90%. Insider's poll suggests that his party's loyalty might not be as steadfast as previously thought.\n\nRead more:\n\nJust 30% of Americans say they oppose impeaching President Trump, according to a new Insider poll\n\nTrump is reportedly calling Mitch McConnell up to 3 times a day and raging about GOP senators he views as disloyal\n\nTrump called his vice president 'Mike Pounce' and the internet blew up with memes\n\nSurveyMonkey Audience polls from a national sample balanced by census data of age and gender.
