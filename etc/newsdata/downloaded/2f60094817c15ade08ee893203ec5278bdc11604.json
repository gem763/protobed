Most of the group was detained and put on a bus back to Tapachula, while about 150 migrants returned by foot, witnesses said.\n\nJOE GIUDICE\u2019S SHOCKING TRANSFORMATION REVEALED AFTER HE\u2019S RELEASED FROM ICE CUSTODY\n\nThe abrupt halt of the caravan stood in stark contrast to last year when waves of U.S.-bound caravans \u2013 including one of at least 7,000 people \u2013 drew widespread media coverage while immigration officials on both sides of the border struggled to stem the flow.\n\nUnder pressure from Washington, the government has been taking a tougher stance in dealing with migrants, and many Mexicans are being less welcoming.\n\nPresident Trump, who frequently described the caravans an \u201cinvasion,\u201d brokered a deal with Mexico in June, promising to avert tariffs on imports if Mexico clamped down on U.S.-bound migration.\n\nSalva Lacruz, from the Fray Mat\u00edas de C\u00f3rdova Human Rights Center in Tapachula, called the roundup on Sunday a \"human hunt\" and noted officials waited until the migrants had tired out before forcing them into vans.\n\nSending the migrants back south was an \"exercise in cruelty,\" Lacruz said, saying the migrants have come to Mexico because \"they need international protection.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMexico's export-driven economy is highly dependent on commerce with the U.S., and the government has become far less hospitable to migrants.\n\nMexico has offered refugees the possibility of obtaining work and residency permits to stay in southern Mexico, far from the U.S. border. But those asylum permits are slow-coming in an overstretched immigration system.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "A caravan of roughly 2,000 migrants bound for the United States early Saturday was halted by Mexican authorities only a few hours into their journey, according to witnesses cited by Reuters.", "authors": ["Bradford Betz", "Bradford Betz Is An Editor For Fox News.
