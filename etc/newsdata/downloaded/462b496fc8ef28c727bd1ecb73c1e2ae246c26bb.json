The film comes from Matt Reeves, whose credits include Cloverfield and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.\n\nA new knight rises: what will Robert Pattinson make of Batman's poisoned chalice Read more\n\nThe 30-year-old daughter of Lenny Kravitz and Lisa Bonet reportedly went through a rigorous testing process that saw her compete alongside Ana de Armas, Ella Balinska and Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez. After Kravitz tested last week with Pattinson, she secured the part.\n\nThe Batman is being billed as a more grounded take on the character.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very much a point of view-driven, noir Batman tale,\u201d Reeves said to the Hollywood Reporter earlier this year. \u201cIt\u2019s told very squarely on his shoulders, and I hope it\u2019s going to be a story that will be thrilling but also emotional. It\u2019s more Batman in his detective mode than we\u2019ve seen in the films. The comics have a history of that. He\u2019s supposed to be the world\u2019s greatest detective, and that\u2019s not necessarily been a part of what the movies have been.\u201d\n\nThe cast is also set to include Jeffrey Wright as Commissioner Gordon while Jonah Hill is also in talks for an unspecified villain role. Kravitz\u2019s credits include the Divergent series and Mad Max: Fury Road. She will next be seen in Hulu\u2019s reimagined take on High Fidelity.\n\nSources suggest The Batman will begin production late this year or early 2020 with a summer 2021 release date confirmed. The casting news follows the record-breaking box office success of Joker, which has made $548m worldwide since its 4 October release.", "description": "The Big Little Lies star landed the role of Selina Kyle in a new take on the DC superhero", "authors": ["Guardian Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a69a2165a9590bce7ec9f06744caf47da35e33ca/0_221_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c34ee3207846230ccf2a9261420cae6b", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
