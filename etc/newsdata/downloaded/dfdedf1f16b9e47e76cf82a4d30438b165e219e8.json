Chinese State-Run Paper Singles Out Navarro for Trade `Lies'\n\n(Bloomberg) -- The Chinese Communist Party\u2019s flagship newspaper took aim at one of Washington\u2019s most prominent China hawks, calling recent comments by Peter Navarro unconstructive \u201clies\u201d that hinder the progress of trade talks.\n\nNavarro, an adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump, repeated accusations he\u2019s previously termed China\u2019s \u201cseven deadly sins\u201d during a Sunday interview with Yahoo (NASDAQ: ) Finance -- including alleged cyberattacks, forced technology transfers and currency manipulation. He also said China is taking on the \u201cfull burden\u201d of U.S. tariffs on its products.\n\n\u201cAll these preposterous comments are not constructive at all, and go against the larger direction of the two sides taking real action to create favorable conditions for the negotiations,\u201d Beijing\u2019s state-run People\u2019s Daily wrote in a commentary Tuesday. Navarro intended to \u201cthrow cold water on international markets,\u201d it said.\n\nThose \u201cirresponsible\u201d comments should stop, and the U.S. should show \u201csincerity\u201d and \u201caction\u201d to create condition for the negotiations, the paper said.\n\nChina and the U.S. will hold face-to-face trade negotiations in Washington in the coming weeks, after a deterioration in relations last month left global investors reeling amid increasing evidence the conflict is harming both nations. The U.S. Agriculture Department\u2019s undersecretary for trade, Ted McKinney, also used provocative language on Monday, calling Chinese President Xi Jinping a \u201ccommunist zealot.\"\n\n\u201cIt is important for both China and the United States to grasp the opportunity of stabilizing bilateral trade and economic ties,\u201d the People\u2019s Daily commentary said, adding that the two countries should work together in the direction set by their leaders.", "description": "Chinese State-Run Paper Singles Out Navarro for Trade `Lies'", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEEAE0DC_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
