It will replace it with a system that includes the total number of viewers, including those watching on mobile devices.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nNexstar is the owner of Tribune Media and operates about 200 stations in 115 markets, including affiliates of ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC. Tim Busch, president of the company\u2019s broadcasting unit, said it has been working with media firm Comscore to give advertisers audience measures across TV, digital, mobile and streaming-video outlets.\n\nThe move could be key in a period where more people are streaming on smart devices. Many TV-station owners, in fact, have shown interest in forgoing traditional ratings in place of a broader measure that includes mobile viewers, according to Variety.\n\nThe TVB, a trade organization that represents more than 800 TV stations and TV broadcast groups, said it began inquiring about using viewer impressions as a base for making advertising deals.

When a company says \u2018I want to reach your viewers,\u2019 \u2026 we are of service to the advertiser to the fullest extent of what we can provide.\u201d\n\nFACEBOOK PUTS PRICE ON ITS NEW PORTAL TV\n\nMedia-measurement company Neilson said in a statement it supports local stations opting to use total impressions: \u201cWith the increase of cross-platform campaigns, stations are looking to impressions rather than percentages for comparability across platforms.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\n\"Nielsen has always provided clients with impressions and they are the foundation for all of our calculations. That said, ratings, reach and frequency will still have a strong place in the planning and programming processes.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "\u201cWe wanted to sell all platforms, indiscriminately of where our viewers are found,\u201d Tim Busch, president of the company\u2019s broadcasting unit, said.", "authors": ["Shawn M.
