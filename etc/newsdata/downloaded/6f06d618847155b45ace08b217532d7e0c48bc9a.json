Mike DeWine\u2019s administration identified a number of causes for the lack of broadband availability to include outdated tax codes, missed funding opportunities, maps that incorrectly show where service is available and bureaucratic red tape.\n\nThose that responded to a request for information told state officials no best practice strategy exists among states for introducing broadband in underserved areas, but states that have had success have been more aggressive in their approach than Ohio.\n\nThe report said valuable rights of way along limited-access highways maintained by the Ohio Department of Transportation could be leveraged to expand broadband availability. Increased private investment in such projects and Ohio\u2019s efforts to become a leader in developing \u201csmart\u201d transportation corridors that require robust internet access may provide additional momentum.\n\nDeWine said his administration is committed to making sure broadband is part of the state\u2019s overall infrastructure strategy.\n\n\u201cThis report provides interesting insight into opportunities Ohio can take advantage of as we develop plans to improve and expand broadband across the state,\u201d DeWine said in a statement.\n\nRepublican Lt. Gov. Jon Husted, director of the state\u2019s InnovateOhio technology initiative, is spearheading development of a new statewide broadband strategy based on the report\u2019s findings.\n\n\u201cWe received a lot of very helpful feedback as part of this process, which we can now use as we craft a statewide broadband strategy,\u201d Husted said in a statement. \u201cExpanding access to and quality of broadband in our state is a quality of life issue, an economic issue, and a health and safety issue, which is why our administration is determined to get our strategy right.\u201d\n\nThe request for information asked broadband providers which highway corridors would be of interest if the state makes them available for private use. The 1 million Ohioans without high-speed internet live in about 300,000 households. But the report also said it may take a variety of approaches to succeed at getting affordable, reliable internet service into all communities.\n\nTransportation Director Jack Marchbanks said his department will be fully engaged.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s connecting children to information at school or connecting smart vehicles to infrastructure, access to broadband is vital in the 21st Century,\u201d Marchbanks said. \u201cODOT has always played a role in helping connect our state and this is just another opportunity to do that.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "About 1 million Ohioans, mostly in Appalachia, lack high-speed internet service and the state's highway corridors may hold the key to addressing the stubborn problem, a report released Wednesday concluded.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/28/voter_rolls_ohio_14713_c0-125-3000-1874_s1770x1032.jpg?f52fad753beb582a85b1710fc9f6c2ec1ddbd99f", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
