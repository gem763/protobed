Hey, he has had a bad week or two \u2014 terrible reads on manufacturing and yawning talk of impeachment. But investors would be wise to not suck up too much of Trump\u2019s economic hopium.\n\n\u201cBreaking News: Unemployment Rate, at 3.5%, drops to a 50 YEAR LOW. Wow America, lets impeach your President (even though he did nothing wrong!),\u201d Trump tweeted just moments after the new jobs figures hit the newswires on Friday.\n\nBut going beneath the hood of the latest on jobs from the U.S. Labor Department, you find a U.S. economy slowing down perhaps faster than most investors appreciate. For starters, private payrolls \u2014 which excludes government hiring \u2014 rose by 114,000, slightly missing Wall Street estimates. Morgan Stanley economist Robert Rosener astutely points out that August and July payrolls are now reported to have increased by 122,000 \u2014 that brings the three-month private payroll growth number down to 119,000 from 135,000.\n\nRosener says the jobs growth trend has \u201cslowed noticeably.\u201d Keep in mind this slowdown has come prior to the full effect of Trump\u2019s tariffs on China hitting companies \u2014 that\u2019s probably lurking for October and into year end.\n\nBlame the spreading effects of that U.S. trade war with China on Corporate America, blame seasonal distortions or workforce demographic shifts. Whatever the case, the fact is the U.S. economy is losing momentum \u2014 as seen by several recent jobs reports \u2014 and is not nearly as robust as team Trump suggests or as implied by a 3.5% unemployment rate.\n\nThe weakness in private payrolls in September bled into average hourly earnings, too. Average hourly earnings fell 0.4% on the month, also coming in a shade below Wall Street forecasts. The miss on average hourly earnings brought the year-over-year average down to 2.89% growth, the lowest since July 2018.\n\nNearing recession\n\nUBS\u2019 macro team appear to be the only bunch on the Street that are keeping it real on the economy right now.\n\n\u201cWe have been expecting the economy to slow to near-recession in response to the tariffs and their particular effects on manufacturing, energy, and retail sectors, which were already faltering. This week\u2019s data suggests that the weakening in activity is coming sooner and may be greater than we have been expecting,\u201d says UBS economist Samuel Coffin.\n\nInvestors would be wise to heed that call from UBS. Some certainly have already done so \u2014 a strong bid post the jobs report has continued in the safe-haven 10-year Treasury and various consumer staples stock such as Coca-Cola.\n\nTrump should give UBS a perfect call, too, to get a sense on what is really going on out there in the economy \u2014 mostly because of his own masterful work.\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
