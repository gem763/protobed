Bernard Sanders, who has recovered from a heart attack on the campaign trail and returned to public life \u2014 appearing Saturday at a major rally in New York City where he earned the ready endorsement of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The Vermont independent and New York Democrat then celebrated progressive values and socialism before an enthusiastic crowd of 25,000.\n\nBut wait. Let\u2019s suppose Mr. Sanders and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez joined forces and she became his running mate in the 2020 presidential race. Can you imagine the glowing press, the giddy commentary the endless photo-ops of the brave septuagenarian and the 30-something who could in theory shake up the political world?\n\nUh, no.\n\nAt 30, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez is not old enough to take the vice presidential office. Like the presidential candidate, a vice presidential hopeful must be at least 35, as stipulated by the Constitution.\n\nBut wait again. There\u2019s also filmmaker Michael Moore waiting in the wings. He also endorsed Mr. Sanders, and, at 65, is old enough to be a veep.\n\nSo you never know. Maybe we\u2019ll see SANDERS/MOORE 2020 on a bumper sticker somewhere, After all, one of the bestselling bumper stickers at the moment is one which reads \u201cANY FUNCTIONING ADULT 2020.\u201d\n\nPELOSI\u2019S UNFAVORABILITY RATINGS\n\nSome analysts have pointed out that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s favorability ratings are rising during the impeachment inquiry, inching up from say, 37% to 39%. Amazing. \u201cFavorability increases\u201d \u2014 it makes for a nice headline. What the clever analysts don\u2019t say is that quite often, the majority or near majority of respondents in many of these polls actually disapprove of the job Mrs. Pelosi is doing. Citing popularity as opposed to unpopularity is a convenient and canny device.\n\nAnd some numbers: A Politico/Morning Consult voter poll found Mrs. Pelosi with a 51% unfavorability rating.\n\nThat includes 83% of Republicans, 55% of independents and 21% of Democrats. Among those who voted for Mr. Trump the number is 87%; among those who voted for former President Barack Obama, it\u2019s 31%. The poll of 1,993 registered U.S. voters was conducted Oct. 11-13.\n\nMeanwhile, a Georgetown University poll of 1,011 voters conducted Oct. 6-10 finds Mrs. Pelosi with a 52% unfavorability rating; that includes 43% who \u201cstrongly\u201d disapprove. Intriguing demographic breakdowns were not included in this survey.\n\nFinally, a Fox News poll found the House speaker with a 48% unfavorable rating; 80% of Republicans, 58% of independents and 19% of Democrats agreed. So did 75% of conservatives, 44% of moderates \u2014 and even 20% of liberals.\n\nTHE MARVEL OF TRUMP ENERGY\n\nIf you marvel of President Trump\u2019s sustained level of energy, you\u2019re not alone. Those close to Mr. Trump also shake their heads in wonder.\n\n\u201cHe has been in office for three years. He has sustained an energy and a momentum that we have never seen,\u201d Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel tells Fox News.\n\n\u201cHis supporters are with him 100%. Wages are up. Unemployment is at a record low. You\u2019ve got jobs coming back. People know that he went out and promised these things to the American people. Now he is delivering, their lives are better and they are going to do everything they can to reelect him. His energy is so strong and it just keeps growing. It\u2019s amazing,\u201d Mrs. McDaniel said.\n\nVOTERS: YEAH, THEY\u2019RE AFTER TRUMP\n\nA straightforward poll reveals a little something Republicans have been mulling for quite some time:\n\n\u201cJust over half of voters still believe in the likelihood of an illegal high-level effort to stop the Trump presidency,\u201d says a new Rasmussen Reports national survey.\n\nIt found that 51% of likely U.S. voters think it\u2019s likely senior law enforcement officials broke the law in an effort to prevent President Trump from winning the presidency. That includes 34% who say it\u2019s \u201cvery likely.\u201d\n\nAbout a third say the prospects are unlikely. The survey of 1,000 likely voters was conducted Oct. 9-10.\n\nA PRODUCTIVE PARTNERSHIP\n\nThe National Park Service and the Netherlands Embassy are combining forces to restore the 127-foot high Netherlands Carillon, located near Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia.\n\n\u201cThe carillon is a symbol of Dutch gratitude to the American people for helping liberate the Netherlands during World War II,\u201d the parks folks advise.\n\nOver time, each of the 50 bronze bells \u2014 which weigh a combined 30 tons \u2014 will be removed, cleaned, repaired and reinstalled. Work on the carillon \u2014 which was dedicated in 1960 \u2014 begins Monday. On hand for the big occasion: Andre Haspels, Dutch ambassador to the U.S., and George Washington Memorial Parkway Superintendent Charles Cuvelier.\n\nMUST-SEE TRUMP TV\n\nProgramming of note: Fox News prime-time kingpin Sean Hannity will present an interview with President Trump to air at 9 p.m. EDT Monday.\n\nThis exchange will originate from the White House. Mr. Trump is expected to discuss the latest complexities on the impeachment inquiry, the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates and the cease-fire in Syria, along with other news of the day.\n\nPOLL DU JOUR\n\n\u2022 81% of Americans overall are concerned about the partisan division between Republicans and Democrats increasing; 83% of Republicans and 88% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 78% overall say the division between the parties is increasing; 85% of Republicans and 78% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 73% overall say Republicans and Democrats can\u2019t agree on \u201cbasic facts\u201d; 77% of Republicans and 72% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 55% overall say there is a \u201cgreat deal\u201d of difference between what each party stands for; 74% of Republicans and 59% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 37% overall say there is a \u201cfair amount\u201d of difference; 24% of Republicans and 38% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 7% overall say there is \u201chardy any\u201d difference; 2% of Republicans and 3% of Democrats agree.\n\nSource: A Pew Research Center poll of 9,895 U.S. adults conducted Sept. 3-15 and released OCT. 10. THE PARTY BREAKDOWNS DID NOT INCLUDE THOSE WHO ONLY \u201cLEAN\u201d TOWARD ONE PARTY AND THE POLL DID NOT BREAK OUT INDEPENDENTS.\n\n\u2022 Helpful information to [email protected]\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
