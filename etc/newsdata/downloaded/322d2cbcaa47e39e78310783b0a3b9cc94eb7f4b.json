A sea of yellow-shirted fans in the \u201cKing\u2019s Court\u201d will rise in unison and chant as he takes the mound, and when he gets to two strikes on any hitter, and will cheer deliriously anytime No. 34 can record a strikeout against playoff-chasing Oakland.\n\nAfter 15 seasons and more time spent on the injured list than on the mound in recent years, there may not be many suitors for a 33-year-old pitcher with decreased velocity and more than 2,700 career innings on his right arm. Hernandez is 1-7 in 14 starts this season with a 6.51 ERA.\n\nThe face of the franchise for so long, his contract with the Mariners expires after the season and both sides seem ready to go their own way.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to retire yet,\u201d Hernandez said after his last start. \u201cI think I can go out there and compete against anybody. It was a tough year with my shoulder. But if I get healthy, I can compete.\u201d\n\nREST UP\n\nThe NL East champion Braves have shut down Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr. for the remainder of the regular season after the All-Star outfielder made an early exit this week because of tightness in his left hip. Atlanta manager Brian Snitker said the decision is largely precautionary, and Acu\u00f1a can continue to throw and hit while sitting out the final four games.\n\nAcu\u00f1a has 41 homers, 101 RBIs and 37 stolen bases. He\u2019s also scored a NL-high 127 runs. The Braves start the NL Division Series on Oct. 3 at SunTrust Park - their opponent hasn\u2019t been determined yet.\n\nCALLING IT A DAY\n\nReds broadcaster Marty Brennaman wraps up his long career in the booth when Cincinnati hosts Milwaukee at Great American Ball Park. He\u2019s retiring after this season, his 46th with the Reds.\n\nThe 77-year-old broadcaster known for his pull-no-punch descriptions and his \u201cthis one belongs to the Reds\u201d sign-off isn\u2019t going on the season-ending road trip to Pittsburgh.\n\n\u201cThursday will be the hardest day of my life, I think,\u201d Brennaman said earlier this week, \u201cI think that will be a tough one.\u201d\n\nCHECK HIM\n\nThe Cardinals will see how pitcher Michael Wacha is feeling, a day after he was pulled from a start at Arizona in the second inning because of tightness in his right shoulder. Manager Mike Shildt said more would be known during an off day for the NL Central leaders.\n\nWacha has pitched well recently, but is 0-3 in 10 starts since rejoining the rotation in early August.\n\nThe Cardinals host the Cubs this weekend, trying to hold their 1 1/2-game division lead over Milwaukee.\n\nLAST DANCE?\n\nHard-throwing Zack Wheeler (11-7, 3.99 ERA) makes what could be his final appearance for the Mets when he starts at home against Miami. The 29-year-old righty can become a free agent after the season.\n\nWheeler was a premier prospect when New York acquired him from the San Francisco Giants for Carlos Beltran in July 2011 and has spent his entire major league career with the Mets, missing two full seasons following Tommy John surgery. But he\u2019s bounced back to win 23 games and throw nearly 370 innings over the past two years.\n\n\u201cEverybody wants this guy, I\u2019m sure,\u201d manager Mickey Callaway said. \u201cSo we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A look at what's happening around the majors Thursday:", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/26/mariners_orioles_baseball_18324_c0-97-2333-1457_s1770x1032.jpg?fff7e0ac793adb7554da80709978c76b501424ba", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
