We are trying to take this in stages,\" he said.\n\nIs this 'think-again Thursday'?\n\nBoris Johnson believes there should be a general election this winter to break the Brexit deadlock.\n\nThere's not much point, he believes, in talking to Labour because they are never going to help him out.\n\nBut are we now arriving at \"think-again Thursday\"? A growing number of influential Tories are saying: \"Hang on, winter election, not such a good idea.\"\n\nIt's not even clear Mr Johnson could trigger one.\n\nThere are more and more Tories saying: \"Perhaps we should have another go at bringing the bill back and trying to get it through the Commons.\"\n\nThat's because Mr Johnson did get a majority on the broad principles of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill.\n\nAnd perhaps, some say, if you love-bombed Labour MPs who might be tempted to vote for it, you would get it through.", "description": "Most EU leaders favour a three-month delay - but France is sceptical about it, the BBC understands.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/16F0D/production/_109356939_mediaitem109356937.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
