Data is processed in aggregate at about 10^14 bps, according to Smith.\n\nThe key problem is that current network stacks are much slower, capable of delivering about 10^10 to 10^11bps application throughputs, which are in low gigabit-per-second ranges.\n\nDARPA wants to solve a particular challenge in distributed computing since it depends heavily on communication between computing nodes. The lack of significantly faster NICs is also becoming a challenge for AI in deep neural network training and image classification.\n\nBut what DARPA wants from FastNICs isn't a small task and would require an overhaul of the whole network stack.\n\n\"Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice,\" DARPA notes in the tender document.\n\nUnder FastNICs, DARPA will select a challenge application and give it hardware and software support. The hardware development side of the project will require researchers to demonstrate 10tbps network interface hardware using existing or road-mapped technology. And the hardware needs to be able to attach to servers using standard interfaces.\n\n\"There is a lot of expense and complexity involved in building a network stack \u2013 from maximizing connections across hardware and software to reworking the application interfaces,\" explained Smith.\n\n\"Strong commercial incentives focused on cautious incremental technology advances across multiple, independent market silos have dissuaded anyone from addressing the stack as a whole,\" he added.\n\nDARPA's key areas of interest are distributed machine learning and sensors for things like UAVs and self-driving cars. Faster network interfaces would help all cores in a cluster of computers continue working towards a single purpose as they do, but faster.\n\n\"Recent research has shown that by speeding up the network support, the entire distributed machine-learning system can operate more quickly,\" said Smith.\n\n\"With machine learning, the methods typically used involve moving data around, which creates delays. However, if you can move data more quickly between machines with a successful FastNICs result then you should be able to shrink the performance gap.\"", "description": "DARPA is asking for help to create the super-fast network interface card that industry has so far failed to produce.", "authors": ["Liam Tung"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/27/d50a8024-5d53-4a9f-a496-f78b8850ba73/thumbnail/770x578/f60eab4c100c6fcb206ce1a3be817cb4/datacentermanistock-1060784838.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
