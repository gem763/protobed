Catalonia\u2019s pragmatist professor", "language": "en", "text": "Barcelona (AFP) \u2013 An inscrutable pragmatist with an affable nature, Oriol Junqueras is a key figure in the Catalan separatist movement who has taken the fall for a failed independence bid that sparked Spain\u2019s worst political crisis in decades.\n\nA professor-turned-politician, Junqueras was on Monday sentenced to 13 years behind bars for his role in the separatist push which included a secession referendum on October 1, 2017 that was banned by Madrid.\n\nA lifelong supporter of Catalan independence, Junqueras has been propelled into the spotlight as a result of the trial, which saw him convicted of sedition and misuse of public funds.\n\nAs regional vice president at the time, Junqueras was the most senior figure of 12 defendants to be put on the stand after Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont fled abroad to avoid prosecution.\n\nBut this 50-year-old father-of-two chose to stay, and has since spent nearly two years behind bars in pre-trial detention.\n\nDescribed in his own words as a \u201cpolitical prisoner\u201d \u2014 a claim fiercely contested by Spain \u2014 Junqueras has come a long way since entering politics some 12 years ago.\n\n\u201cI am being prosecuted for my ideas and not for my actions,\u201d he told the court in February.\n\nDespite being locked up, he has managed to retain his status within the movement and even win election to both the Spanish and the European parliaments.\n\n\u2013 An early start \u2013\n\nBorn in Barcelona on April 11, 1969 to a teacher father and a mother who was a nurse, Junqueras was educated at a religious Italian school.\n\nAlthough he remains discreet about his childhood, he told Catalan daily La Vanguardia in 2012 that he began supporting independence when he was just eight.\n\nA polyglot who speaks Spanish, Catalan, English and Italian, he once did some research at the Vatican and met the man who would later become pope Benedict XVI, his close friend Raul Murcia told AFP.\n\nWith a doctorate in history, he taught at the Autonomous University of Barcelona and first became known to the public by hosting history programmes on Catalan radio and television.\n\nIn 2007, he moved from university classroom to politics, serving as a local councillor, then becoming a European MP in 2009 and, two years later, being elected mayor of Sant Vicenc dels Horts, his hometown near Barcelona.\n\nIn the same year, he took over as head of the leftwing pro-independence Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC).\n\nAt the time, the party was struggling with heavy electoral losses and riven with dissent, but within a few years, he had turned it into the leading pro-independence party in Catalonia.\n\nAnd from prison, he has kept up his work, meeting senior political figures and steering the party on a moderate line favouring dialogue with Madrid, to appeal to those Catalans who oppose separation from Spain \u2014 just over half of them.\n\n\u201cHe has told us: I\u2019m facing a very hard sentence but we must not give up our politics, we mustn\u2019t give up dialogue,\u201d said ERC lawmaker Gabriel Rufian.\n\n\u201cIt might sound a bit over the top, but we have a Mandela.\u201d\n\n\u2013 A friarly aspect \u2013\n\nKnown for his affability and described as a \u201cteddy bear\u201d by Catalan socialist leader Miquel Iceta, Junqueras became the region\u2019s vice-president in January 2016 and was charged with organising the banned October referendum.\n\nSpeaking on condition of anonymity, a former member of his office described him as \u201cvery prudent, very rigorous\u201d.\n\nA committed Catholic with an ample waistline and a neat beard, Junqueras has something of \u201ca Franciscan appearance\u201d, according to Catalan writer Sergi Pamies.\n\nAnd Enric Millo, Madrid\u2019s representative in Catalonia during the 2017 crisis, took the analogy further, saying he \u201ctalks really well, almost like a priest\u201d.\n\nBut he had another side to him, a \u201cdual nature\u201d, Millo said: \u201cAll of a sudden, when it comes to act, he draws the knife,\u201d describing him as a person who was \u201cready to give everything\u201d.\n\nColumnist Joaquim Coll said despite his \u201cgood-natured, almost clerical rhetoric\u201d, Junqueras was \u201ca fundamentalist\u201d when it came to independence, describing him as \u201cnot a very trustworthy person\u201d.\n\nAlthough clearly a man who commands loyalty, Junqueras has a reputation for sidestepping difficult questions, and to many, he remains inscrutable \u2014 even those in the dock with him.\n\n\u201cI still question who Oriol Junqueras really is,\u201d admitted co-defendant Santi Vila in his recently-published book, who himself was fined for his role in the 2017 succession bid.", "description": "Barcelona (AFP) \u2013 An inscrutable pragmatist with an affable nature, Oriol Junqueras is a key figure in the Catalan
