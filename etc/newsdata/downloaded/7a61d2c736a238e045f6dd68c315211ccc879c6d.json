We\u2019ve been calling and accurately since early 2018 and continue to focus a good portion of our efforts in studying these incredible setups. Let\u2019s have a little fun and start with two charts from near July 20, 2019, to help our followers understand what we\u2019ve been expecting.\n\nThis first monthly silver chart highlights what we believed would be the approximate wave structure of the silver price advance going forward. We did not attempt to accurately time these peaks of valleys, we simply used our Fibonacci Price Amplitude Arcs to allow price to tell us where these peaks may form. From those levels, we used our best \u201cguess\u201d to identify the trough bottoms.\n\nYou can see a \u201cStarted Here\u201d line near the bottom of this chart. This highlights where we created this chart and where the price was when we first posted it in our research (near $16.39). As of today, the price of Silver is near $18.75 and climbing. We\u2019ve drawn in the missing data on this chart and highlighted the endpoint with a \u201cNOW Here!\u201d message. Once the price of silver breaks above that BLUE Fibonacci Price Amplitude Arc, it should rally up to $23 to $25 before finding new resistance.\n\nMonthly Silver\n\nThis next silver weekly chart was shared with our members near July 25, 2019. Pay very close attention to the arrows we drew on the chart at that time. Guess what the price of silver actually did after this chart was shared with our readers? Yup, silver shot up to $19.75 in early September, rotated back to the $17.50 level near the middle of September, and is starting a new rally towards the $23 to $25+ level right now. Does that look familiar to you on this chart (below)?\n\nWeekly Silver\n\nIf this seems amazing to you because we were able to see these moves so accurately into the future and had such a keen insight into the future metals price rotation \u2013 don\u2019t be alarmed. Our proprietary research tools are second to none. Our team of researchers have more than 54 years of experience in the markets and have studied almost all types of price theory, technical analysis, and other types of market price, technical, and fundamental analysis techniques. We put our skills to the test every day in order to help our clients find and execute the best trades.\n\nWhat's Next?\n\nWell, the charts above actually show you what\u2019s next. The charts below highlight new triggers that we believe will drive the current rally in silver even higher.\n\nTake notice of the HEAVY MAGENTA Fibonacci Price Amplitude Arc. The reason we highlight this MAGENTA level and the GREEN level in heavier line drawn is because these levels tend to become the major price inflection points within the arcs. In other words, these levels are where the price will either stall/reverse or breakout of a trend and possibly explode into a bigger price trend. The current Magenta line has just been crossed and the price is already exploding to the upside. If this continues as we expect, this Weekly Custom Metals Index could rally another 25% higher \u2013 which would put gold well above $1800 per ounce and silver well above $24 per ounce.\n\nWeekly Metals\n\nThis last silver daily chart is our silver cycle chart. It shows that we expect silver to reach levels above $23 to $25 before early November 2019. That means silver could rally 20~25% from current levels within the next 30+ days to reach our current upside targets.
