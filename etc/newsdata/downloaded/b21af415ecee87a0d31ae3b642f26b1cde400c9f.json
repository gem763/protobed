In parliament, \u201ccollaborators\u201d with the European Union, who will force Britain to \u201csurrender\u201d. Behind them, shadowy financial backers such as George Soros, singled out by Jacob Rees-Mogg as \u201cremoaner funder-in-chief\u201d. In the universities and the media, the promoters of \u201ccultural Marxism\u201d, an alien ideology that must be rooted out, according to Suella Braverman. And above all, an unaccountable liberal elite that stands in the way of the hopes and aspirations of the British people.\n\nOnce these claims were mostly to be found on the far right \u2013 but the current Tory leadership has placed them at the heart of mainstream discourse. Consider the new home secretary, Priti Patel, who casually caricatured the politicians opposed to her as the \u201cnorth London metropolitan liberal elite\u201d in a conference speech that drew outrage from some quarters and passionate defence \u2013 or rushed excuses \u2013 from others. Her choice of words, as many pointed out, echoed a classic antisemitic trope: \u201cnorth London\u201d is often a shorthand for Jews; \u201cmetropolitan liberal elite\u201d isn\u2019t far off from \u201crootless cosmopolitans\u201d.\n\nThe destination is a revived hard-right populism, narrow in focus, pumped-up, aggressive\n\nBut there is more to what the Tories are doing than offensive language \u2013 and the road map to it can be found in Patel\u2019s cartoonishly hardline performance. The destination is a revived hard-right populism, narrow in focus, pumped-up, aggressive, that will define the Conservatives long after Brexit.\n\nThose whose \u201cwill\u201d the Tories intend to enact are \u201chardworking, honest, law-abiding people whose needs are humble, whose expectations are modest and whose demands of their government are simple\u201d. Patel\u2019s policy proposals, such as they were, consist largely of signalling. It\u2019s not clear how an \u201cAustralian points-based immigration system\u201d differs from the UK\u2019s current points-based immigration system \u2013 but it\u2019s a good shorthand for immigration controls that police incomers by wealth and ethnicity and mete out savage treatment to unwanted refugees.\n\nCounty lines drug dealing, singled out for a crackdown, involves horrific exploitation and abuse but also \u2013 conveniently for rightwing press and politicians \u2013 fits a racialised image of crime-ridden inner cities infecting more respectable areas. Promises of tougher sentences, combined with more powers and weapons for police, add to the mood music.\n\nPlay Video Priti Patel says she will end free movement of people \u2013 video\n\nThe message is clear: the Conservatives will protect the people \u2013 from the criminals and immigrants who would do them harm, and the elite liberals who would enable it.\n\nAt a moment of crisis and with an election looming, the Tories are pinning their hopes on a replay of the populist authoritarianism that won Margaret Thatcher the 1979 election. Patel\u2019s declaration that the Tories are \u201cthe party of law and order again\u201d suggests that their campaigning on domestic policy will be simple and brutal: tougher criminal sentences and tougher borders; measures to keep ordinary British citizens safe that the unpatriotic Labour leadership is unwilling to take.\n\nIn fact Patel directly invoked Thatcher, who \u201cknew that if you made the British people your compass, if you took time to understand their lives and priorities, then your direction would always be true\u201d. In admiring tones, Patel described Thatcher\u2019s understanding of ordinary common sense: \u201can honest day\u2019s work for an honest day\u2019s pay, live within your means, pay your bills on time, and support the police\u201d.\n\nThe Conservatives may wish to emulate past glories, but they face radically different circumstances. The political theorist Stuart Hall was one of the few analysts on the left to recognise from the outset that Thatcherism represented a profound shift in the terms on which British politics were conducted. For Hall, it was a new form of rightwing populism that drew on familiar themes \u2013 law and order, race and immigration, discipline in schools \u2013 but assembled them in a new way that spoke directly to what millions of people experienced in their daily lives.\n\nIn the 1970s, according to Hall, what people were frustrated by was a postwar social democracy that had run into serious economic trouble, a Labour party caught between representing working-class interests and policing workers on behalf of capital. It was easy to turn people against \u201csocialism\u201d and promise a restoration of order at a time when socialism, for many people, was synonymous with stagnation and an overbearing state bureaucracy.\n\nBut 2019 is not 1979. The Conservatives want to tap into voters\u2019 fears and frustrations once again, but now they cannot name the real causes \u2013 because they are the cause.\n\nUnlike the 1970s, we are not nearing the end of 30 years of relatively prosperous social democracy. Instead, we are finishing a decade in which Conservative-led governments have destroyed public services in order to preserve an economic ideology that was revealed to be bankrupt by the crash of 2008.\n\nPeople\u2019s lived experience of Britain today is of a country that is physically and socially fraying at the seams: one of budget cuts, youth centre closures, hospital waiting lists, food banks, soaring homelessness, holes in the road. Councils \u2013 Tory-run councils \u2013 have gone bankrupt. In so many walks of life, people right now are likely to be feeling that the safety net in which they once trusted has been ripped away.\n\nA journey in search of the north London metropolitan elite Read more\n\nBut for the Conservatives to acknowledge this would mean acknowledging their own responsibility. So instead blame must be directed elsewhere: criminals, immigrants, anyone standing in the way of \u201cgetting Brexit done\u201d. The Conservatives have no option but to engage in this pantomime authoritarianism, because they simply don\u2019t have anything else to offer. For a party gearing up to fight a general election in the next few months, it was striking that they had almost no policies to announce at their party conference last week.\n\nThis may be a pale imitation of Thatcherism\u2019s authoritarian turn, but it has the potential to be even more vicious. Populism doesn\u2019t just need a \u201cpeople\u201d to speak for, it needs an enemy \u2013 and Patel and her party are happy to name it, however reckless their language.\n\nWhile commentators debate their intentions \u2013 do they mean to invoke these poisonous tropes? \u2013 the real question is not about their choice of words. All this talk is in the service of something more forceful than language: it constructs a shifting and shapeless category of people who stand accused of working against the interests and security of the nation. That is violent imagery, and the Conservatives seem at the very least indifferent to the kind of emotions it will stir up, or the people who might be willing to act on them. Its effects will likely be longer-lasting and harder to remove than the current government.\n\n\u2022 Daniel Trilling is editor of New Humanist and author of Lights in the Distance: Exile and Refuge at the Borders of Europe", "description": "The hard-right rhetoric is an imitation of Thatcher\u2019s populism \u2013 but it has the potential to be even more vicious, says Daniel Trilling, editor of New Humanist", "authors": ["Daniel Trilling"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/052b91de81d0c99092f3454dab7ba217b2ac6790/0_125_2745_1647/master/2745.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=ab1632a85ecbc707343ba7ead82511d6", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
