Shape Created with Sketch. 40 books to read before you die 1/40 Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen It is a fact universally acknowledged that every list of great books must include Pride and Prejudice. Don\u2019t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart expos\u00e9 of the marriage market in Georgian England. For every lucky Elizabeth, who tames the haughty, handsome Mr. Darcy and learns to know herself in the process, there\u2019s a Charlotte, resigned to life with a driveling buffoon for want of a pretty face. 2/40 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 \u00be, Sue Townsend Read this one when you\u2019re decrepit enough, and chances are you\u2019ll die laughing. No-one has lampooned the self-absorption, delusions of grandeur and sexual frustration of adolescence as brilliantly as Susan Townsend, and no one ever will. Beyond the majestically majestic poetry and the pimples, there\u2019s also a sharp satire of Thatcherist Britain. 3/40 Catch 22, Joseph Heller It\u2019s not often an idiom coined in a novel becomes a catch-phrase, but Joseph Heller managed it with his madcap, savage and hilarious tour de force. War is the ultimate dead-end for logic, and this novel explores all its absurdities as we follow US bombardier pilot Captain John Yossarian. While Heller drew on his own experience as a WWII pilot, it was the McCarthyism of the fifties that fueled the book\u2019s glorious rage. 4/40 Tess of the d\u2019Urbervilles, Thomas Hardy A good 125 years before #metoo, Thomas Hardy skewered the sexual hypocrisy of the Victorian age in this melodramatic but immensely moving novel. Tess is a na\u00efve girl from a poor family who is raped by a wealthy land-owner. After the death of her baby, she tries to build a new life, but the \u201cshame\u201d of her past casts a long shadow. Read this if you want to understand the rotten culture at the root of victim-blaming. 5/40 Things fall apart, Chinua Achebe A classic expos\u00e9 of colonialism, Achebe\u2019s novel explores what happens to a Nigerian village when European missionaries arrive. The main character, warrior-like Okonkwo, embodies the traditional values that are ultimately doomed. By the time Achebe was born in 1930, missionaries had been settled in his village for decades. He wrote in English and took the title of his novel from a Yeats poem, but wove Igbo proverbs throughout this lyrical work. 6/40 1984, George Orwell The ultimate piece of dystopian fiction, 1984 was so prescient that it\u2019s become a clich\u00e9. But forget TV\u2019s Big Brother or the trite travesty of Room 101: the original has lost none of its furious force. Orwell was interested in the mechanics of totalitarianism, imagining a society that took the paranoid surveillance of the Soviets to chilling conclusions. Our hero, Winston, tries to resist a grey world where a screen watches your every move, but bravery is ultimately futile when the state worms its way inside your mind. 7/40 To kill a Mockingbird, Harper Lee A timeless plea for justice in the setting of America\u2019s racist South during the depression years, Lee\u2019s novel caused a sensation. Her device was simple but incendiary: look at the world through the eyes of a six-year-old, in this case, Jean Louise Finch, whose father is a lawyer defending a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Lee hoped for nothing but \u201ca quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers\u201d: she won the Pulitzer and a place on the curriculum. 8/40 Great Expectations, Charles Dickens Dickens was the social conscience of the Victorian age, but don\u2019t let that put you off. Great Expectations is the roiling tale of the orphaned Pip, the lovely Estella, and the thwarted Miss Havisham. First written in serial form, you barely have time to recover from one cliffhanger before the next one beckons, all told in Dickens\u2019 luxuriant, humorous, heartfelt prose. 9/40 The God of Small Things, Arundhati Roy Roy won the 1997 Booker Prize with her debut novel, a powerful intergenerational tale of love that crosses caste lines in southern India, and the appalling consequences for those who break the taboos dictating \u201cwho should be loved, and how. And how much\u201d. Sex, death, religion, the ambivalent pull of motherhood: it\u2019s all there in this beautiful and haunting book. 10/40 Wolf Hall, Hilary Mantel In an astonishing act of literary ventriloquism, Mantel inhabits a fictionalised version of Thomas Cromwell, a working-class boy who rose through his own fierce intelligence to be a key player in the treacherous world of Tudor politics. Historical fiction so immersive you can smell the fear and ambition. 11/40 The Code of the Woosters, PG Wodehouse If you haven\u2019t read PG Wodehouse in a hot bath with a snifter of whisky and ideally a rubber duck for company, you haven\u2019t lived. Wallow in this sublimely silly tale of the ultimate comic double act: bumbling aristocrat Bertie Wooster and his omniscient butler, Jeeves. A sheer joy to read that also manages to satirise British fascist leader Oswald Mosley as a querulous grump in black shorts. 12/40 Frankenstein, Mary Shelley Shelley was just 18 when she wrote Frankenstein as part of a challenge with her future husband, Percy Shelley, and Lord Byron, to concoct the best horror story. Put down the green face paint: Frankenstein\u2019s monster is a complex creation who yearns for sympathy and companionship. Some 200 years after it was first published, the gothic tale feels more relevant than ever as genetic science pushes the boundaries of what it means to create life. 13/40 Lord of the Flies, William Golding Anyone who has ever suspected that children are primitive little beasties will nod sagely as they read Golding\u2019s classic. His theory is this: maroon a bunch of schoolboys on an island, and watch how quickly the trappings of decent behaviour fall away. Never has a broken pair of spectacles seemed so sinister, or civilisation so fragile. 14/40 Midnight's Children, Salman Rushdie The protagonist of Rushdie\u2019s most celebrated novel is born at the exact moment India gains independence. He\u2019s also born with superpowers, and he\u2019s not the only one. In an audacious and poetic piece of magical realism, Rushdie tells the story of India\u2019s blood-soaked resurgence via a swathe of children born at midnight with uncanny abilities. 15/40 Jane Eyre, Charlotte Bronte You will need a cold, dead heart not to be moved by one of literature\u2019s steeliest heroines. From the institutional cruelty of her boarding school, the \u201csmall, plain\u201d Jane Eyre becomes a governess who demands a right to think and feel. Not many love stories take in a mad woman in the attic and a spot of therapeutic disfigurement, but this one somehow carries it off with mythic aplomb 16/40 Middlemarch, George Eliot This is a richly satisfying slow burn of a novel that follows the lives and loves of the inhabitants of a small town in England through the years 1829\u201332. The acerbic wit and timeless truth of its observations mark this out as a work of genius; but at the time the author, Mary Anne Evans, had to turn to a male pen name to be taken seriously. 17/40 Secret History, Donna Tartt Stick another log on the fire and curl up with this dark, peculiar and quite brilliant literary murder tale. A group of classics students become entranced by Greek mythology - and then take it up a level. Remember, kids: never try your own delirious Dionysian ritual at home. 18/40 Americanah, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie A subtle and engrossing look at racial identity, through the story of a charismatic young Nigerian woman who leaves her comfortable Lagos home for a world of struggles in the United States. Capturing both the hard-scrabble life of US immigrants and the brash divisions of a rising Nigeria, Adichie crosses continents with all her usual depth of feeling and lightness of touch. 19/40 Cold Comfort Farm, Stella Gibbons An absolute unadulterated comic joy of a novel. Stella Gibbons neatly pokes fun at sentimental navel-gazing with her zesty heroine Flora, who is more interested in basic hygiene than histrionics. In other words, if you\u2019ve \u201cseen something nasty in the woodshed,\u201d just shut the door. 20/40 Beloved, Toni Morrison Dedicated to the \u201cSixty Million and more\u201d Africans and their descendants who died as a result of the slave trade, this is a cultural milestone and a Pulitzer-winning tour de force. Morrison was inspired by the real-life story of an enslaved woman who killed her own daughter rather than see her return to slavery. In her plot, the murdered child returns to haunt a black community, suggesting the inescapable taint of America\u2019s history. 21/40 Brideshead Revisited, Evelyn Waugh Evelyn Waugh bottles the intoxicating vapour of a vanished era in this novel about middle-class Charles Ryder, who meets upper-class Sebastian Flyte at Oxford University in the 1920s. Scrap the wartime prologue, and Charles\u2019s entire relationship with Sebastian\u2019s sister Julia (Dear Evelyn, thank you for your latest manuscript, a few suggested cuts\u2026) and you\u2019re looking at one of the most affecting love affairs in the English language. 22/40 Dune, Frank Herbert You can almost feel your mouth dry with thirst as you enter the world of Frank Herbert\u2019s Dune and encounter the desert planet of Arrakis, with its giant sandworms and mind-altering spice. It\u2019s the setting for an epic saga of warring feudal houses, but it\u2019s as much eco-parable as thrilling adventure story. Rarely has a fictional world been so completely realised. 23/40 Wuthering Heights, Emily Bronte Will there ever be a novel that burns with more passionate intensity than Wuthering Heights? The forces that bring together its fierce heroine Catherine Earnshaw and cruel hero Heathcliff are violent and untameable, yet rooted in a childhood devotion to one another, when Heathcliff obeyed Cathy\u2019s every command. It\u2019s impossible to imagine this novel ever provoking quiet slumbers; Emily Bronte\u2019s vision of nature blazes with poetry. 24/40 The Great Gatsby, F Scott Fitzgerald The savage reviews that greeted F Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s third novel \u2013 \u201cno more than a glorified anecdote\u201d; \u201cfor the season only\u201d \u2013 failed to recognise something truly great; a near-perfect distillation of the hope, ambition, cynicism and desire at the heart of the American Dream. Other novels capture the allure of the invented self, from Stendhal\u2019s The Red and the Black to Thomas Mann\u2019s Confessions of Felix Krull, but Fitzgerald\u2019s enigmatic Jay Gatsby casts a shadow that reaches to Mad Men\u2019s Don Draper and beyond. 25/40 A Clockwork Orange, Anthony Burgess From the moment we meet Alex and his three droogs in the Korova milkbar, drinking moloko with vellocet or synthemesc and wondering whether to chat up the devotchkas at the counter or tolchock some old veck in an alley, it\u2019s clear that normal novelistic conventions do not apply. Anthony Burgess\u2019s slim volume about a violent near-future where aversion therapy is used on feral youth who speak Nadsat and commit rape and murder, is a dystopian masterpiece. 26/40 Lolita, Vladimir Nabokov Banned from entering the UK in its year of publication, 1955, Vladimir Nabokov\u2019s astonishingly skilful and enduringly controversial work of fiction introduces us to literary professor and self-confessed hebephile Humbert Humbert, the perhaps unreliable narrator of the novel. He marries widow Charlotte Haze only to get access to her daughter, 12-year-old Dolores, nicknamed Lo by her mother, or as Humbert calls her \u201cLolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.\u201d Cloaking his abuse in the allusive language of idealised love does not lessen Humbert\u2019s crimes, but allows Nabokov to skewer him where he hides. 27/40 Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Philip K Dick Here be Roy Baty, Rick Deckard and Rachael Rosen \u2013 the novel that inspired Blade Runner is stranger even than the film it became. Back in an age before artificial intelligence could teach itself to play chess in a few hours better than any grandmaster that ever lived, Philip K Dick was using the concept of android life to explore what it meant to be human, and what it is to be left behind on a compromised planet. That he could do it in 250 pages that set the mind spinning and engage the emotions with every page-turn make this a rare science-fiction indeed. 28/40 Heart of Darkness, Joseph Conrad Inspired by Conrad\u2019s own experiences of captaining a trading steamer up the Congo River, Heart of Darkness is part adventure, part psychological voyage into the unknown, as the narrator Marlow relays the story of his journey into the jungle to meet the mysterious ivory trader Mr Kurtz. Although debate continues to rage about whether the novel and its attitude to Africa and colonialism is racist, it\u2019s deeply involving and demands to be read. 29/40 Dracula, Bram Stoker Whatever passed between Irish theatre manager Bram Stoker and the Hungarian traveller and writer \u00c1rmin V\u00e1mb\u00e9ry when they met in London and talked of the Carpathian Mountains, it incubated in the Gothic imagination of Stoker into a work that has had an incalculable influence on Western culture. It\u2019s not hard to read the Count as a shadowy sexual figure surprising straitlaced Victorian England in their beds, but in Stoker\u2019s hands he\u2019s also bloody creepy. 30/40 The Catcher in the Rye, J D Salinger It only takes one sentence, written in the first person, for Salinger\u2019s Holden Caulfield to announce himself in all his teenage nihilism, sneering at you for wanting to know his biographical details \u201cand all that David Copperfield kind of crap\u201d. The Catcher in the Rye is the quintessential novel of the adolescent experience, captured in deathless prose. 31/40 The Big Sleep, Raymond Chandler Dashiel Hammett may have been harder boiled, his plots more intricate but, wow, does Raymond Chandler have style. The push and pull at the start of The Big Sleep between private detective Philip Marlowe, in his powder-blue suit and dark blue shirt, and Miss Carmen Sternwood, with her \u201clittle sharp predatory teeth\u201d and lashes that she lowers and raises like a theatre curtain, sets the tone for a story of bad girls and bad men. 32/40 Vanity Fair, William Makepeace Thackeray All the teeming life of 19th century London is here in Thackeray\u2019s masterpiece, right down to the curry houses frequented by Jos Sedley, who has gained a taste for the hot stuff as an officer in the East India Trading Company. But it is Becky Sharp, one of literature\u2019s great characters, who gives this novel its enduring fascination. As a woman on the make, Becky is the perfect blend of wit, cunning and cold-hearted ruthlessness. Try as film and TV might to humanise and make excuses for her, Becky needs victims to thrive! And she\u2019s all the more compelling for that. 33/40 The Bell Jar, Sylvia Plath The only novel written by the poet Sylvia Plath is a semi-autobiographical account of a descent into depression that the book\u2019s narrator Esther Greenwood describes as like being trapped under a bell jar \u2013 used to create a vacuum in scientific experiments \u2013 struggling to breathe. Almost every word is arresting, and the way that Plath captures the vivid life happening around Esther, news events, magazine parties, accentuates the deadening illness that drives her towards suicidal feelings. Plath herself would commit suicide one month after the novel\u2019s publication in 1963. 34/40 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Roald Dahl Harry Potter may be more popular, but Willy Wonka is altogether weirder. From the overwhelming poverty experienced by Charlie Bucket and his family, to the spoilt, greedy, brattish children who join Charlie on his trip to Willy Wonka\u2019s phantasmagorical sweet factory there is nothing artificially sweetened in Roald Dahl\u2019s startling work of fantasy. 35/40 Anna Karenina, Leo Tolstoy Andrew Davies\u2019s recent TV adaptation of War and Peace reminded those of us who can\u2019t quite face returning to the novel\u2019s monstrous demands just how brilliantly Tolstoy delineates affairs of the heart, even if the war passages will always be a struggle. In Anna Karenina \u2013 enormous, too! \u2013the great Russian novelist captures the erotic charge between the married Anna and the bachelor Vronsky, then drags his heroine through society\u2019s scorn as their affair takes shape, without ever suggesting we move from her side. 36/40 Dangerous Liaisons, Pierre Choderlos de Laclos The most deliciously wicked experience in literature, this epistolary novel introduces us to the Marquise de Merteuil and Vicomte de Valmont, who play cruel games of sexual conquest on their unwitting victims. The Marquise\u2019s justification for her behaviour \u2013 \u201cI, who was born to revenge my sex and master yours\u201d \u2013 will strike a chord in the #metoo era, but emotions, even love, intrude, to the point where Laclos\u2019s amorality becomes untenable. Sexy but very, very bad. 37/40 100 Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia Marquez The energy and enchantment of Garcia Marquez\u2019s story of seven generations of the Buendia family in a small town in Colombia continue to enthrall half a century on. Hauntings and premonitions allied to a journalistic eye for detail and a poetic sensibility make Marquez\u2019s magical realism unique. 38/40 The Trial, Frank Kafka \u201cSomeone must have been telling lies about Josef K\u2026\u201d So begins Kafka\u2019s nightmarish tale of a man trapped in an unfathomable bureaucratic process after being arrested by two agents from an unidentified office for a crime they\u2019re not allowed to tell him about. Foreshadowing the antisemitism of Nazi-occupied Europe, as well as the methods of the Stasi, KGB, and StB, it\u2019s an unsettling, at times bewildering, tale with chilling resonance. 39/40 Rebecca, Daphne du Maurier The second Mrs de Winter is the narrator of Du Maurier\u2019s marvellously gothic tale about a young woman who replaces the deceased Rebecca as wife to the wealthy Maxim de Winter and mistress of the Manderley estate. There she meets the housekeeper Mrs Danvers, formerly devoted to Rebecca, who proceeds to torment her. As atmospheric, psychological horror it just gets darker and darker. 40/40 The Leopard, Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa Published posthumously in 1958, Tomasi di Lampedusa\u2019s novel is set in 19th century Sicily, where revolution is in the air. The imposing Prince Don Fabrizio presides over a town close to Palermo during the last days of an old world in which class stratifications are stable and understood. Garibaldi\u2019s forces have taken the island and a new world will follow. It\u2019s a deep and poetic meditation on political change and the characters that it produces. 1/40 Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen It is a fact universally acknowledged that every list of great books must include Pride and Prejudice. Don\u2019t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart expos\u00e9 of the marriage market in Georgian England. For every lucky Elizabeth, who tames the haughty, handsome Mr. Darcy and learns to know herself in the process, there\u2019s a Charlotte, resigned to life with a driveling buffoon for want of a pretty face. 2/40 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 \u00be, Sue Townsend Read this one when you\u2019re decrepit enough, and chances are you\u2019ll die laughing. No-one has lampooned the self-absorption, delusions of grandeur and sexual frustration of adolescence as brilliantly as Susan Townsend, and no one ever will. Beyond the majestically majestic poetry and the pimples, there\u2019s also a sharp satire of Thatcherist Britain. 3/40 Catch 22, Joseph Heller It\u2019s not often an idiom coined in a novel becomes a catch-phrase, but Joseph Heller managed it with his madcap, savage and hilarious tour de force. War is the ultimate dead-end for logic, and this novel explores all its absurdities as we follow US bombardier pilot Captain John Yossarian. While Heller drew on his own experience as a WWII pilot, it was the McCarthyism of the fifties that fueled the book\u2019s glorious rage. 4/40 Tess of the d\u2019Urbervilles, Thomas Hardy A good 125 years before #metoo, Thomas Hardy skewered the sexual hypocrisy of the Victorian age in this melodramatic but immensely moving novel. Tess is a na\u00efve girl from a poor family who is raped by a wealthy land-owner. After the death of her baby, she tries to build a new life, but the \u201cshame\u201d of her past casts a long shadow. Read this if you want to understand the rotten culture at the root of victim-blaming. 5/40 Things fall apart, Chinua Achebe A classic expos\u00e9 of colonialism, Achebe\u2019s novel explores what happens to a Nigerian village when European missionaries arrive. The main character, warrior-like Okonkwo, embodies the traditional values that are ultimately doomed. By the time Achebe was born in 1930, missionaries had been settled in his village for decades. He wrote in English and took the title of his novel from a Yeats poem, but wove Igbo proverbs throughout this lyrical work. 6/40 1984, George Orwell The ultimate piece of dystopian fiction, 1984 was so prescient that it\u2019s become a clich\u00e9.

Her device was simple but incendiary: look at the world through the eyes of a six-year-old, in this case, Jean Louise Finch, whose father is a lawyer defending a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Lee hoped for nothing but \u201ca quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers\u201d: she won the Pulitzer and a place on the curriculum. 8/40 Great Expectations, Charles Dickens Dickens was the social conscience of the Victorian age, but don\u2019t let that put you off.

First written in serial form, you barely have time to recover from one cliffhanger before the next one beckons, all told in Dickens\u2019 luxuriant, humorous, heartfelt prose. 9/40 The God of Small Things, Arundhati Roy Roy won the 1997 Booker Prize with her debut novel, a powerful intergenerational tale of love that crosses caste lines in southern India, and the appalling consequences for those who break the taboos dictating \u201cwho should be loved, and how.

Historical fiction so immersive you can smell the fear and ambition. 11/40 The Code of the Woosters, PG Wodehouse If you haven\u2019t read PG Wodehouse in a hot bath with a snifter of whisky and ideally a rubber duck for company, you haven\u2019t lived. Wallow in this sublimely silly tale of the ultimate comic double act: bumbling aristocrat Bertie Wooster and his omniscient butler, Jeeves. A sheer joy to read that also manages to satirise British fascist leader Oswald Mosley as a querulous grump in black shorts. 12/40 Frankenstein, Mary Shelley Shelley was just 18 when she wrote Frankenstein as part of a challenge with her future husband, Percy Shelley, and Lord Byron, to concoct the best horror story.

Capturing both the hard-scrabble life of US immigrants and the brash divisions of a rising Nigeria, Adichie crosses continents with all her usual depth of feeling and lightness of touch. 19/40 Cold Comfort Farm, Stella Gibbons An absolute unadulterated comic joy of a novel.

Other novels capture the allure of the invented self, from Stendhal\u2019s The Red and the Black to Thomas Mann\u2019s Confessions of Felix Krull, but Fitzgerald\u2019s enigmatic Jay Gatsby casts a shadow that reaches to Mad Men\u2019s Don Draper and beyond. 25/40 A Clockwork Orange, Anthony Burgess From the moment we meet Alex and his three droogs in the Korova milkbar, drinking moloko with vellocet or synthemesc and wondering whether to chat up the devotchkas at the counter or tolchock some old veck in an alley, it\u2019s clear that normal novelistic conventions do not apply. Anthony Burgess\u2019s slim volume about a violent near-future where aversion therapy is used on feral youth who speak Nadsat and commit rape and murder, is a dystopian masterpiece. 26/40 Lolita, Vladimir Nabokov Banned from entering the UK in its year of publication, 1955, Vladimir Nabokov\u2019s astonishingly skilful and enduringly controversial work of fiction introduces us to literary professor and self-confessed hebephile Humbert Humbert, the perhaps unreliable narrator of the novel. He marries widow Charlotte Haze only to get access to her daughter, 12-year-old Dolores, nicknamed Lo by her mother, or as Humbert calls her \u201cLolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.\u201d Cloaking his abuse in the allusive language of idealised love does not lessen Humbert\u2019s crimes, but allows Nabokov to skewer him where he hides. 27/40 Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Philip K Dick Here be Roy Baty, Rick Deckard and Rachael Rosen \u2013 the novel that inspired Blade Runner is stranger even than the film it became. Back in an age before artificial intelligence could teach itself to play chess in a few hours better than any grandmaster that ever lived, Philip K Dick was using the concept of android life to explore what it meant to be human, and what it is to be left behind on a compromised planet. That he could do it in 250 pages that set the mind spinning and engage the emotions with every page-turn make this a rare science-fiction indeed. 28/40 Heart of Darkness, Joseph Conrad Inspired by Conrad\u2019s own experiences of captaining a trading steamer up the Congo River, Heart of Darkness is part adventure, part psychological voyage into the unknown, as the narrator Marlow relays the story of his journey into the jungle to meet the mysterious ivory trader Mr Kurtz. Although debate continues to rage about whether the novel and its attitude to Africa and colonialism is racist, it\u2019s deeply involving and demands to be read. 29/40 Dracula, Bram Stoker Whatever passed between Irish theatre manager Bram Stoker and the Hungarian traveller and writer \u00c1rmin V\u00e1mb\u00e9ry when they met in London and talked of the Carpathian Mountains, it incubated in the Gothic imagination of Stoker into a work that has had an incalculable influence on Western culture. It\u2019s not hard to read the Count as a shadowy sexual figure surprising straitlaced Victorian England in their beds, but in Stoker\u2019s hands he\u2019s also bloody creepy. 30/40 The Catcher in the Rye, J D Salinger It only takes one sentence, written in the first person, for Salinger\u2019s Holden Caulfield to announce himself in all his teenage nihilism, sneering at you for wanting to know his biographical details \u201cand all that David Copperfield kind of crap\u201d. The Catcher in the Rye is the quintessential novel of the adolescent experience, captured in deathless prose. 31/40 The Big Sleep, Raymond Chandler Dashiel Hammett may have been harder boiled, his plots more intricate but, wow, does Raymond Chandler have style. The push and pull at the start of The Big Sleep between private detective Philip Marlowe, in his powder-blue suit and dark blue shirt, and Miss Carmen Sternwood, with her \u201clittle sharp predatory teeth\u201d and lashes that she lowers and raises like a theatre curtain, sets the tone for a story of bad girls and bad men. 32/40 Vanity Fair, William Makepeace Thackeray All the teeming life of 19th century London is here in Thackeray\u2019s masterpiece, right down to the curry houses frequented by Jos Sedley, who has gained a taste for the hot stuff as an officer in the East India Trading Company. But it is Becky Sharp, one of literature\u2019s great characters, who gives this novel its enduring fascination. As a woman on the make, Becky is the perfect blend of wit, cunning and cold-hearted ruthlessness. Try as film and TV might to humanise and make excuses for her, Becky needs victims to thrive! And she\u2019s all the more compelling for that. 33/40 The Bell Jar, Sylvia Plath The only novel written by the poet Sylvia Plath is a semi-autobiographical account of a descent into depression that the book\u2019s narrator Esther Greenwood describes as like being trapped under a bell jar \u2013 used to create a vacuum in scientific experiments \u2013 struggling to breathe. Almost every word is arresting, and the way that Plath captures the vivid life happening around Esther, news events, magazine parties, accentuates the deadening illness that drives her towards suicidal feelings. Plath herself would commit suicide one month after the novel\u2019s publication in 1963. 34/40 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Roald Dahl Harry Potter may be more popular, but Willy Wonka is altogether weirder. From the overwhelming poverty experienced by Charlie Bucket and his family, to the spoilt, greedy, brattish children who join Charlie on his trip to Willy Wonka\u2019s phantasmagorical sweet factory there is nothing artificially sweetened in Roald Dahl\u2019s startling work of fantasy. 35/40 Anna Karenina, Leo Tolstoy Andrew Davies\u2019s recent TV adaptation of War and Peace reminded those of us who can\u2019t quite face returning to the novel\u2019s monstrous demands just how brilliantly Tolstoy delineates affairs of the heart, even if the war passages will always be a struggle. In Anna Karenina \u2013 enormous, too! \u2013the great Russian novelist captures the erotic charge between the married Anna and the bachelor Vronsky, then drags his heroine through society\u2019s scorn as their affair takes shape, without ever suggesting we move from her side. 36/40 Dangerous Liaisons, Pierre Choderlos de Laclos The most deliciously wicked experience in literature, this epistolary novel introduces us to the Marquise de Merteuil and Vicomte de Valmont, who play cruel games of sexual conquest on their unwitting victims. The Marquise\u2019s justification for her behaviour \u2013 \u201cI, who was born to revenge my sex and master yours\u201d \u2013 will strike a chord in the #metoo era, but emotions, even love, intrude, to the point where Laclos\u2019s amorality becomes untenable. Sexy but very, very bad. 37/40 100 Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia Marquez The energy and enchantment of Garcia Marquez\u2019s story of seven generations of the Buendia family in a small town in Colombia continue to enthrall half a century on. Hauntings and premonitions allied to a journalistic eye for detail and a poetic sensibility make Marquez\u2019s magical realism unique. 38/40 The Trial, Frank Kafka \u201cSomeone must have been telling lies about Josef K\u2026\u201d So begins Kafka\u2019s nightmarish tale of a man trapped in an unfathomable bureaucratic process after being arrested by two agents from an unidentified office for a crime they\u2019re not allowed to tell him about. Foreshadowing the antisemitism of Nazi-occupied Europe, as well as the methods of the Stasi, KGB, and StB, it\u2019s an unsettling, at times bewildering, tale with chilling resonance. 39/40 Rebecca, Daphne du Maurier The second Mrs de Winter is the narrator of Du Maurier\u2019s marvellously gothic tale about a young woman who replaces the deceased Rebecca as wife to the wealthy Maxim de Winter and mistress of the Manderley estate. There she meets the housekeeper Mrs Danvers, formerly devoted to Rebecca, who proceeds to torment her. As atmospheric, psychological horror it just gets darker and darker. 40/40 The Leopard, Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa Published posthumously in 1958, Tomasi di Lampedusa\u2019s novel is set in 19th century Sicily, where revolution is in the air. The imposing Prince Don Fabrizio presides over a town close to Palermo during the last days of an old world in which class stratifications are stable and understood. Garibaldi\u2019s forces have taken the island and a new world will follow. It\u2019s a deep and poetic meditation on political change and the characters that it produces.\n\nSpeaking about the existing TV show, Atwood said she\u2019s \u201cgiven them lots of ways of how\u201d the writers can advance the character of Offred.\n\nThe audiobook for The Testaments will be narrated by Dowd, who plays Aunt Lydia in the TV show.\n\nThe book will be released on 10 September.", "description": "Hulu is developing a TV show\u00a0of Margaret Atwood\u2019s Handmaid\u2019s Tale sequel. New book The Testaments will take place 15 years after Offred\u2019s final scene in the original novel, which was released in 1985.", "authors": ["Jacob Stolworthy"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/09/12/handmaids-tale.png"}
