A vote on the deal will be held in the House of Commons this Saturday, Johnson said.\n\nIt remains unclear whether lawmakers will back the deal. The previous deal reached with EU leaders, negotiated by Johnson's predecessor Theresa May, was voted down three times by the House of Commons, forcing the UK to seek an extension to the original Brexit deadline of March 31 this year. May's deal was criticized heavily on all sides of the political spectrum, with some arguing it left the UK too closely aligned with the EU, and others saying that it failed to protect workers' rights and would damage the economy.\n\n(MORE: Leaked 'no-deal' Brexit report warns of civil unrest and food supply disruptions)\n\nThe main difference between Johnson's deal and the previous one negotiated by May involves the future of Northern Ireland, which has been a sticking point in the negotiations of the past three years.\n\nJeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, which has the second highest number of lawmakers in the House of Commons, described the new deal as \"worse than Theresa May's\" and called for the British public to have a \"final say\" on the outcome of the negotiations, in a general election or another referendum.\n\nPHOTO: European Union chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier gives a press briefing on the sidelines of Brexit negotiation in Brussels, Belgium, Oct. 17, 2019.

The best way to get Brexit sorted is to give the people the final say in a public vote.\u201d\n\nThe current Brexit deadline stands at October 31 of this year, more than three years after the UK voted to leave the EU in a referendum in June 2016.\n\n(MORE: Churchill\u2019s grandson and 20 other MPs expelled from the Conservative Party for voting against hard Brexit)\n\nJohnson's task of securing the consent of Parliament is further complicated as he has lost the ruling Conservative Party's majority in Parliament, having expelled 21 lawmakers from the party for voting against his plans to leave the EU without a deal on October 31.\n\nThis means Johnson will have to secure the votes of other political parties in order to pass the Brexit deal.\n\nIf Parliament rejects Johnson's deal on Saturday, the prime minister may be forced to ask the EU for another extension to the Brexit deadline. In early September lawmakers voted 327 to 299 in favor of a law that will force the prime minister to ask for an extension to the Brexit deadline if a deal has not been passed. Critics say that leaving the EU without a deal will be hugely damaging to the UK economy.\n\nJohnson has previously said he would rather be \"dead in a ditch\" than delay Brexit once again, and has repeatedly stated that the UK will leave the EU with or without a deal at the end of this month.", "description": "UK and EU agree to 'great' Brexit deal, Prime Minister Johnson says originally appeared on abcnews.go.comThe United Kingdom and European Union have agreed on a new Brexit deal, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced Thursday morning.\"We\u2019ve got a great new deal that takes back control,\"", "authors": ["Guy Davies"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_Dherm9CEXnPZHksNISaMQ--~B/aD01NTg7dz05OTI7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/gma/us.abcnews.gma.com/boris-johnson_hpMain_20191017-061330_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
