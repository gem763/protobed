(Elizabeth Frantz/Reuters)\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke drew a comparison between 1930s Nazi Germany and America under the Trump administration during a Wednesday interview Wednesday with the Washington Post.\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s comments came after Costa pressed him over his ability to reach across the aisle to work with Republicans after making intensely disparaging comments about them on the campaign trail.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that speaking the truth and calling things by their right names is in any way disqualifying in being able to do work going forward. I think sooner rather than later, a majority of Americans \u2014 including Republicans \u2014 are going to see Trump for who he is, and this administration for what it\u2019s done,\u201d O\u2019Rourke told the Washington Post\u2019s Robert Costa when challenged.\n\n\u201cOutside of the Third Reich, give me another example of a Western leader who has called one people of one faith inherently defective, or dangerous, or disqualified from being successful in that country,\u201d he continued. \u201c . . . How did a modern country, well educated, a source of innovation and ingenuity, and a source of moral leadership in the world, descend into that level of barbarity, producing a shame that lives with every single German to this day?\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke also sparred with Meghan McCain in July over his characterization of a Trump rally in North Carolina as an \u201cimpromptu Nuremberg rally.\u201d\n\nThe former Texas Congressman has also gone after conservatives over gun rights and religious freedom in recent weeks. In September\u2019s Democratic debate, O\u2019Rourke advocated for assault weapon confiscation, infamously saying \u201cHell, yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15.\u201d And during an \u201cEquality Town Hall\u201d hosted by CNN on October 10, O\u2019Rourke implied that religious institutions could lose their tax-exempt status for opposing same-sex marriage.\n\nA profile of New York Representative Max Rose published in New York Magazine on October 11 showed the freshman Democrat taking aim at O\u2019Rourke for his radical policy proposals.\n\n\u201cWhen you win you get to help people, and when you lose you get to be a social-media rock star. So I don\u2019t think Beto is cool, and I don\u2019t think losing is cool,\u201d Rose said. \u201cLosing is not as cool as he thinks it is.\u201d", "description": "O\u2019Rourke\u2019s comments came after Costa pressed him over his ability to work with Republicans after making intensely disparaging comments about them.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Kevin D.
