And though the US negotiators said they were willing to come back in two weeks, the North Koreans made no such statement.\n\nThe talks were the first detailed discussion between the two countries since Trump and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un, walked away from a summit meeting in Hanoi in February.\n\nThe outcome at the weekend was hardly surprising. Despite Trump's frequent optimistic statements about his relationship with Kim and what he has termed Kim's \"beautiful letters\" to him, the North has accelerated its testing of missiles and added to its stockpile of nuclear fuel.\n\nOne objective of the new talks, according to some administration officials, was to test new proposals that would amount to a temporary freeze of nuclear activity, so that the North's capability did not increase while the talks drag on. Trump's failure to negotiate a freeze when he first met Kim in Singapore in June 2018 \u2014 the first meeting between a US president and a North Korean leader \u2014 is considered by many experts to be a key flaw in his negotiating approach.\n\nA Vox report suggested the US negotiating team would call for a three-year suspension of United Nations sanctions on North Korean coal and textiles in return for closing a major nuclear site and halting some types of fuel production.\n\nIt is not clear if the new talks even broached these or other proposals in any detail. The State Department's chief negotiator, Stephen Biegun, has said little about the specifics of US proposals, other than making it clear they involved a more step-by-step approach to denuclearisation than the all-or-nothing strategy Trump had used.\n\nIn recent days, one of Trump's former national security advisers, John Bolton, delivered a stinging appraisal of Trump's approach without ever naming the president, who fired him a month ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBolton said he believed that Kim had no intention of ever giving up his weapons, a statement largely in accord with years of US intelligence estimates dating to before Trump was elected.\n\nBolton added that there was little use in the negotiations. Bolton was excluded from the talks at the end of his time in office, apparently because Trump believed Bolton's hawkish views were more likely to lead to a conflict than to a negotiated settlement.\n\n\"I don't think the North Koreans will ever voluntarily give up enough\" to make the negotiations fruitful, Bolton said last week at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \"There is no basis to trust any promise that regime makes.\"\n\nTrump's theory has been that the issue can be solved only by direct meetings between the leaders of the two nations, since decades of lower-level talks either broke down or resulted in agreements that fractured within a few years.\n\nThe most notable success came from a 1994 agreement struck by the Clinton administration, more than a decade before the North tested its first nuclear device. Even that agreement fell apart soon after George W. Bush was inaugurated, after the United States and South Korea caught the North secretly pursuing uranium enrichment, one of the two pathways to building a nuclear weapon.\n\nEvery effort that followed collapsed more quickly.\n\nKim, sensing Trump's desire for summit meetings that attract intense coverage, may be betting that Trump needs a breakthrough before next year's presidential election. As a result, he may be testing to see how little of his program he can give up in return for the Trump administration agreeing to lift the onerous sanctions that have squeezed North Korea's export revenues for the past three years.\n\nIn Hanoi, Kim proposed closing down the country's main nuclear production facility at Yongbyon in return for an end to those sanctions. Trump, while tempted to accept the deal, was persuaded otherwise by Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that he would be accused of leaving the North with production facilities outside of the Yongbyon plant, and with an arsenal of 30 to 60 weapons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe two leaders walked away from Hanoi, Kim's negotiators were fired, and talks were in abeyance until the new team arrived in Stockholm at the weekend.\n\nIt is possible they will resume soon, after this initial testing of the waters.\n\nBut in an essay posted on the Foreign Affairs website, Ankit Panda and Vipin Narang, two North Korea experts, note that \"Pyongyang has set a very clear deadline \u2014 the end of this calendar year \u2014 for getting negotiations back on track and for the United States to moderate its position.\"\n\nAfter that, they suggest, Kim could be back to intense testing, betting that Trump would not risk a conflict in the middle of a presidential campaign.\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "The breakdown of talks in Stockholm was the latest indication that President Donald Trump's signature diplomatic initiative has stalled.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3593%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_156%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/33b8c5ce076b4a2615ea53cf7b7d5f2b7ff1c795", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
