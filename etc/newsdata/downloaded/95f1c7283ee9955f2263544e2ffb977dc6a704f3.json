Both the film and the book deal heavily with questions of faith in God during a time of crisis, as well as one\u2019s Second Amendment rights.\n\nDOLLY PARTON, CHRISTIAN DUO FOR KING & COUNTRY TEAM UP ON SONG 'GOD ONLY KNOWS': GOD 'LOVES US'\n\n\u201cAfter an innocent trip to the store ends in rioting and chaos, father of five, Rick (Kevin Sorbo) rushes home desperate to gather his family and find safety,\" the film\u2019s official synopsis reads. \"His plans are dashed when the very same armed men suddenly appear, led by the ruthless Jack (Brian Bosworth). Caught in the deadly crossfire, the children are forced to seek shelter in the surrounding woods.\"\n\nThe synopsis continues: \u201cAlone and vulnerable, the children's faith and family bonds are pushed to the limit, especially those of the eldest daughter, Sophie (Mollee Gray), who questions the morality of gun ownership but soon learns that in God all things are good, including her family\u2019s Second Amendment right to defend themselves. It is now up to the children to reclaim their home, find their parents and put an end to Jack's rampage.\u201d\n\nSURVIVALIST BEAR GRYLLS SHARES HOW TO 'BE STILL WITH GOD' IN DEVOTIONAL BOOK\n\nIn the trailer for the film, civil unrest seems to explode in the family\u2019s small town, prompting a hasty retreat to the safety of the woods. The film deals heavily with the concept of outlawing guns and, as the movie posits, leaving only outlaws armed and dangerous in the U.S.\n\nUnfortunately for those hoping to see \u201cThe Reliant\u201d in theaters, the window to do so is very limited. According to the film\u2019s website, it will only be in theaters for one night on Oct. 24, 2019 in select theaters across the country.\n\nThe film was launched by way of an Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign started by Johnston. A second campaign was launched after principle production ended in 2016 to help with post-production costs. On the second campaign\u2019s page, Johnston warns Americans about the potential for the events in this movie to become a reality.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cWe are one terrorist attack away from giving up our right to keep-and-bear-arms,\u201d he writes. \u201cWith our government corporately willing to spurn the Constitution in so many ways, the Second Amendment is practically meaningless to our leaders. We need to reach the culture with this important message of the moral foundation for our natural right to defend ourselves.\u201d", "description": "Kevin Sorbo stars in a faith-based, politically driven action film\u00a0that\u2019s set for a one-night-only theatrical debut.", "authors": ["Tyler Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Reliant3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
