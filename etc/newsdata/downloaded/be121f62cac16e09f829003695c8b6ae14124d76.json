They've got our passports and told us they have not been paid by Thomas Cook.\n\n\"We're the only Thomas Cook passengers here, and they're not taking any more. We're not sure if they [the hotel] wants extra money.\n\n\"My nan fears if she's stranded in Cyprus she will run out of the medication she must take daily. She has her medication until Wednesday - even a delay of one day is trouble.\"\n\nThe family have been given no information about whether flights home will go ahead.\n\nMr Walker said he fears he will not be able to enjoy his brother's wedding because of the uncertainty.\n\nHe said: \"We feel left in the dark - the hotel doesn't know what's going on, there's no Thomas Cook rep and Thomas Cook haven't contacted us.\n\n\"I am going to have to make phone calls on my brother's wedding day tomorrow and get it sorted out. It's going to ruin the day because I'm going to be on the phone when I should be enjoying myself.\"\n\nImage copyright Leanne Jones Image caption Leanne Jones, with her partner, Andy and young sons, Harrington (bottom left) and Hudson (top left), fears \u00a3800 worth of Thomas Cook vouchers are now worthless\n\nBack in the UK, mum Leanne Jones has been forced to tell her children that their planned trip to Disneyland in June has been cancelled.\n\nMs Jones, from Milton Keynes, said she feels \"rubbish\" after learning \u00a3800 worth of Thomas Cook gift vouchers saved for her two young sons' first foreign holiday are worthless.\n\nMs Jones said the family were \u00a3150 off meeting the \u00a32300 cost of the trip after separately putting money into a holiday fund.\n\nShe said she and her partner, Andy, held off booking the holiday until they had the necessary funds.\n\nShe said: \"Every birthday and Christmas over the last two years I've been saving to take my two young children [Harrington and Hudson] on their first holiday abroad - Disneyland Paris was the plan.\n\n\"We just thought it would be magical for them.\n\n\"I stand to lose all the money from the vouchers and my children will no longer get their holiday. After speaking with Atol [A scheme that protects most air package holidays sold by businesses based in the UK] I've learned my vouchers are not covered and there is nothing anyone can do to help.\n\n\" I'm going to have to start saving again - I have no other option. We'll have to wait another two years.\"\n\nThe Civil Aviation Authority, which runs the Atol scheme, has been contacted for comment about the status of gift vouchers.\n\nImage copyright BBC News Image caption Zoe Sheehan and husband Stefan fear missing her father's memorial service after their Thomas Cook flights were cancelled\n\nFor Zoe Sheehan, 36, from Wales, the travel giant's collapse means she and her husband may miss a family memorial service in Gran Canaria.\n\nMrs Sheehan and Stefan, 28, spent months planning the trip to scatter her father's ashes.\n\nThey are now searching for new flights but do not know when they will be reimbursed for the old ones as there is no word from their travel insurer.\n\nThe couple drove to Gatwick in the early hours of Monday in the hope they could book alternative flights.\n\nMrs Sheehan said: \"I won't stop trying until my last breath. We're shopping around now for flights, but they're so expensive.\n\n\"We had planned this [trip] for months. We have insurance and we have paperwork for his ashes.\n\nShe added: \"It's really important not just for us two, but our two children and my mother.\n\n\"The kids are coming down with their Nan and they're just crying. I was crying earlier.\"\n\nAdvice for travellers or family members concerned about relatives abroad can be found here.", "description": "Customers tell of fears of being stranded abroad with unpaid hotel bills following the collapse.", "authors": ["Mary O'Connor", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/108E3/production/_108911876_de29.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
