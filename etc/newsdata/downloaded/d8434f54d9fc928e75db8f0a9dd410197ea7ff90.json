His appearance is especially anticipated since text messages and other witness testimony place him at the center of a foreign policy dialogue with Ukraine that officials feared circumvented normal channels and that is now at the center of the House impeachment inquiry of Trump.\n\nPart of that effort involved pushing Ukraine to commit to politically charged investigations sought by Trump, including into a gas company connected to the son of Democratic rival Joe Biden.\n\nIn prepared remarks obtained by The Associated Press, Sondland aimed to untether himself from any effort by the Republican president or Giuliani to have a political rival investigated, joining other current and former administration officials who have communicated to Congress misgivings about the Trump administration\u2019s backchannel dealings with Ukraine.\n\nBut Sondland\u2019s pivotal role in the dialogue, including discussions about a quid pro quo in which Ukraine\u2019s leader would get a coveted White House visit in exchange for satisfying Trump\u2019s push for corruption-related investigations, may make those assertions tough for House Democrats to accept.\n\nSondland will say that he was disappointed by a May 23 White House meeting with Trump, who spurned calls by the ambassador and others to arrange a phone call and White House visit for the new Ukraine leader, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The president was skeptical that Ukraine was serious about reform and anti-corruption and instead of arranging the meeting his envoys wanted directed them to talk to Giuliani, Sondland will say.\n\n\u201cOur view was that the men and women of the State Department, not the President\u2019s personal lawyer, should take responsibility for all aspects of U.S. foreign policy towards Ukraine,\u201d Sondland will say.\n\nThe envoys, he will say, had a choice: They could abandon the goal of a White House meeting with Zelenskiy, something they saw as important in fostering U.S.-Ukraine relations, or they could do as Trump asked and work with Giuliani. Though he will say that the ambassadors chose the latter, he insists that he did not know \u201cuntil much later\u201d that Giuliani intended to push for a probe of Biden \u201cor to involve Ukrainians, directly or indirectly, in the President\u2019s 2020 reelection campaign.\u201d\n\nWhen the phone call finally did occur, on July 25, Trump repeatedly prodded Zelenskiy to investigate Biden at the same time that the U.S. was withholding hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid from Ukraine. Sondland will stress that he was not on the call, that he did not receive a transcript until the White House released a rough version last month, and that none of the summaries he reviewed mentioned Biden.\n\n\u201cLet me state clearly: Inviting a foreign government to undertake investigations for the purpose of influencing an upcoming U.S. election would be wrong,\u201d Sondland will say. \u201cWithholding foreign aid in order to pressure a foreign government to take such steps would be wrong. I did not and would not ever participate in such undertakings.\n\nSondland, whose name surfaced in a whistleblower complaint in August that helped spur the impeachment inquiry, is certain to be asked about text messages that show him working with two other diplomats to navigate the interests of Trump and Giuliani. The messages show the diplomats discussing an arrangement in which Ukraine\u2019s leader would be offered a White House visit in exchange for a public statement by Ukraine committing to undertake investigations into the 2016 U.S. presidential election and into Burisma, the gas company. He will insist that he did not know until recently that Hunter Biden sat on the board of Burisma, the gas company at issue.\n\nOne text exchange that has attracted particular attention involves one diplomat, William \u201cBill\u201d Taylor, telling Sondland he thought it was \u201ccrazy\u201d to withhold military aid from Ukraine \u201cfor help with a political campaign.\u201d Sondland replied that Trump had been clear about his intentions and that there was no quid pro quo.\n\nNow, Sondland is prepared to tell lawmakers that Trump told him by phone before he sent the text that there was no quid pro quo and that he was simply parroting those reassurances to Taylor.\n\n\u201cI asked the President: \u2018What do you want from Ukraine?'\u201d Sondland will say. \u201cThe President responded, \u2018Nothing. There is no quid pro quo.\u2019 The President repeated: \u2018no quid pro quo\u2019 multiple times. This was a very short call. And I recall the President was in a bad mood.\n\nSondland will be testifying three days after Fiona Hill, a former White House aide, said that his actions so unnerved then-national security adviser John Bolton that Bolton said he was not part of \u201cwhatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up\u201d \u2014 a reference to White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. But Sondland will say that neither Hill nor Bolton personally raised concerns about the Ukraine work directly with him.\n\nHouse lawmakers have been hearing over the last two weeks from other diplomats and administration officials, including from the State Department. The most recent was Michael McKinley, a career service officer and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2019s de facto chief of staff, who testified that the Trump administration\u2019s politicization of foreign policy contributed to his resignation.\n\n____\n\nFollow Eric Tucker on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The U.S. ambassador to the European Union distanced himself on Thursday from President Donald Trump, planning to tell House impeachment", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/17/5e6c9f_trump-impeachment-44907-gordon-sondland-us-ambassador-european-union-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
