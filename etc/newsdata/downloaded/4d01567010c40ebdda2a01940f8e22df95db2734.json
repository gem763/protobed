The homeless people in these scenes didn\u2019t grow up saying, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to become an addict and live on the street.\u201d Clearly, several things went wrong over the course of their lives.\n\nFor many living on the streets, the path to homelessness started early, with childhood trauma and adverse experiences.\n\nFor example, in Santa Clara County, just south of San Francisco, 78 percent of homeless adults grew up in a household with a person with drug or alcohol dependence; 65 percent endured psychological abuse as a child; and 37.5 percent experienced homelessness as children.\n\nConsidering that Federal Department of Education statistics show that nearly 1.4 million students attending public school experienced homelessness in the 2016-17 school year, 27 percent more children than in 2010-11, the alarm bells should be ringing everywhere.\n\nThis Administration needs to address the rising numbers of \u201cstreet homeless,\u201d but even greater attention needs to be directed toward helping homeless children because the consequences of their homelessness are profound.\n\nBy the time a homeless child is eight years old, one in three has a major mental disorder.\n\nHomeless children have twice the rate of learning disabilities and three times the rate of emotional and behavioral problems. This makes them twice as likely to repeat a grade compared to non-homeless children.\n\nHomeless children are sick at twice the rate of other children and have five times the rate of diarrhea and stomach problems \u2013 not surprising given that homeless children are twice as likely to go hungry and half experience anxiety, depression, or withdrawal. Consequently, many homeless children have great difficulty learning in school.\n\nWithout appropriate interventions, a homeless child beset with overwhelming challenges easily becomes an addicted, mentally ill, and seemingly unemployable homeless adult.\n\nThe rising tide of children facing homelessness today will become a tsunami tomorrow unless we get to the source of the problem.\n\nThe federal Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s one-size-fits-all, faulty-evidence-based policy called \u201cHousing First\u201d is at the eye of this hurricane.\n\nUnder Housing First, rolled out under the previous administration with the promise to \u201cend homelessness,\u201d aims to provide the homeless with housing for life, without any accountability, incentives, or requirement to change behavior.\n\nGiven that the data that shows that 50+ percent of homeless parents are struggling with addiction, and a similar proportion with mental illness, this policy risks exposing their children to additional trauma, and to poor role modeling.\n\nHUD policy discriminates against families by limiting what constitutes a homeless family. Many family\u2013focused non-profits have been forced to close, while others have had to radically change service models to fit HUD\u2019s no-sobriety, no-accountability requirements.\n\nDespite a $1 billion increase in HUD homelessness spending since the 2010-11 school year, homelessness among children is increasing and shows no signs of abating. HUD\u2019s Housing First policy has ignored what is in the best interest of children and isn\u2019t helping adults either, with homelessness at crisis levels.\n\nHUD argues that this crisis is due to a lack of affordable housing and over-regulation, taking the focus off the failures of its decade-long, \u2018ending homelessness\u2019 policy.\n\nIn his 2020 budget, President Trump focused on reforming ineffective policymaking at federal agencies, proposing to hire evaluation officers to bolster evidence-based policymaking.\n\nPresident Trump now needs to force HUD to change direction completely and return Housing First to its original purpose as a targeted solution for the severely-addicted and mentally ill homeless.\n\nIn addition, he should request that the White House Council of Economic Advisors evaluate HUD\u2019s research claiming that Housing First is evidence-based for all populations, including families, children, and youth.\n\nHe should force HUD to adopt the Department of Education\u2019s definition of homelessness, accounting for children staying in motels and sleeping on people\u2019s floors or couches, so that the growing number of homeless women and children are not hidden from public policy or funding.\n\nHe should designate the Administration for Children and Families within the Department of Health and Human Services as the agency responsible for homeless families. ACF is much more in tune with the needs of homeless families and children.\n\nAnd Mr. Trump should create partnerships with churches, the private sector and philanthropy to support the many programs across the country that have demonstrated results in creating self-sufficient individuals and families.\n\nContinuing to support failed homeless policy will guarantee that the homeless crisis metastasizes into a national catastrophe.\n\nMr. President, please stop the hemorrhaging now.\n\nLance Izumi is senior director of the Center for Education at the Pacific Research Institute.\n\nMichele Steeb is the former CEO of Saint John\u2019s Program for Real Change, a Sacramento, California-based residential program that supports women and children struggling with homelessness, mental illness and addiction to become self-sustaining. Due to their sobriety accountability and work requirements, Saint John\u2019s has lost millions of dollars in public funding. The Program has successfully served over 30,000 women and children since its inception in 1985.", "description": "Editor's Note: This piece was coauthored by\u00a0Michele Steeb, the former .09/14/2019 1:28:03AM EST.", "authors": ["Lance Izumi", "Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa", "Katie Pavlich"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/176/710ea37d-9a62-488f-b54e-49b9980b61b7.png", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
