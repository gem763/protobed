She is even selling \"rise and shine\" merchandise now. (Photo: Tommaso Boddi, Getty Images for Netflix)\n\nYou've heard of the \"mom voice,\" right?\n\nYou know, that high-pitched, so-dang-proud, squeeze-their-guts-out voice that moms make when we are talking to our babies.\n\nWell, Kylie Jenner used hers when singing \"Rise and Shine\" to wake her 1-year-old daughter Stormi \u2013 and let's just say it has taken the internet by storm.\n\nIt is probably the most ridiculous thing on the internet right now, but here we are.\n\nThe clip surfaced after Jenner shared a video on YouTube of herself giving a tour of her Kylie Cosmetics office.\n\nAll was well and quiet, until Twitter got a hold of it.\n\n\"Riiiiiiseee and shiiiiiine,\" Jenner sings in her best a capella as she walks into Stormi's room.\n\ni can\u2019t stop watching this i\u2019m dying pic.twitter.com/J916bNRMIa \u2014 \u02da\u2727benjamjn (@kylie_gender) October 14, 2019\n\nThis tweet alone as been viewed more than 14.5 million times. Then of course, the memes came.\n\nwst\n\nKris Jenner is prolly out there looking for a music producer for Kylie lolpic.twitter.com/UP1mpL8zHz \u2014 westhingy (@wsthingy) October 18, 2019\n\ndid i make another rise and shine by @KylieJenner tik tok? maybe... pic.twitter.com/ZWUJPTYK57 \u2014 ellie (@_ellieee14) October 17, 2019\n\nMy ex waking me up to tell me it\u2019s over pic.twitter.com/xmkPmvChfE \u2014 Nick Lehmann (@NickStopTalking) October 17, 2019\n\nSo there's that.\n\nBut here comes the best part: Jenner is OWNING it to the point that the youngest \"self-made\" billionaire is now selling \"Rise and Shine\" merchandise.\n\nAt least she is taking it in stride. After Twitter erupted, Jenner immediately took to Instagram with a meme of her own, a reference to the \"Teletubbies\" sun baby.\n\n\"No caption needed,\" she wrote.\n\nThen, Jenner hit us with this adorable video of Stormi listening to a \"Rise and Shine\" remix.\n\nStormi appears to love it right up until she realizes that it is mommy singing and not her daddy, rapper Travis Scott.\n\n\"Daddy sing?\" Stormi asks Jenner.\n\n\"Oh you want daddy singing? I'm not good enough?\" Jenner says.\n\nHmmmmm, not really. Sorry, mama.\n\nAll we can hope for now is that Ariana Grande really turns this into a hit and moms everywhere can wake up their babies to the beautiful sounds of Jenner's voice.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/parenting/2019/10/18/kylie-jenner-singing-rise-and-shine-meme-merchandise-shop/4020666002/", "description": "It was an innocent moment when Kylie Jenner sang \"Rise and Shine\" to wake up her 1-year-old daughter Stormi.
