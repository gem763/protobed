All internationally traded securities issuers are urged to use ISIN numbering. Unlike a ticker symbol, which varies depending on particular securities listed on a specific exchange, an ISIN code is fixed for a certain security and consists of 12 characters.\n\nUwe Meyer, the executive director at ANNA, stated that standardized reference data will help to build a trusted token market, noting that ISINs are issued in more than 200 jurisdictions over the globe to enable cross-border trading and improved transparency.\n\nEuropean companies release Bitcoin bond in a first for ISINs in crypto\n\nIn July, Luxembourg-based Argento, a securitization firm, partnered with London Block Exchange to issue a Bitcoin-denominated bond. The financial product, which is regulated under the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, became available via Bloomberg Terminal and was reportedly the first crypto product to have its own ISIN code.", "description": "The Association of National Numbering Agencies will assess the adoption of numbering standards for digital assets", "authors": ["Helen Partz"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy80Nzg2ZGJkYWJmOTAzZGUwMzcyMzY4YTQ4NjA3MTU0Yi5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
