It is now easier than ever to plunge into aloofness and depression, thanks to the challenges of our times, and the lack of mental and emotional apparatus to deal with them.\n\nLittle signs and indications keep popping up, but people keep on ignoring them until things take a turn for the worse - 'love yourself' is restricted to being a quote on phone wallpapers, as most of us grapple with ways to actually believe in it and implement it. People should understand that they have no control over the circumstances but they have total control over who they are and how their lives should be.\n\nHumans of Bombay recently shared the story of a Mumbai girl - Priyamvada Mangal - who was on the verge of losing herself, but instead took a step back and chose to liberate herself. She decided to leave behind the negative thoughts by taking one decision that made her feel better about herself.\n\nFacebook\n\nAfter her post graduation she was devastated because of a breakup. Leaving her family and friends behind, she decided to embark on a solo trip, and that trip made her feel free and liberated, she even found answers and peace within herself.\n\nDon't Miss 229 SHARES 318 SHARES 171 SHARES\n\nRead her post here:\n\n\u201cDuring my Vipassana course in 2012, I came across a Chinese lady with a shiny, clean shaven head. She looked so cute and badass - I wondered whether I could ever pull off something like that, because I really loved how it looked. Somehow though, I had the fear that if I did it, people would look at me in a different way - my boyfriend, family and friends.\n\nCut to 2017, after my post graduation when I was devastated because of a break up. It was one of those times where you go through insecurity and wonder, \u2018what\u2019s wrong with me?\u2019. It was during this time that I went for a solo trip to Himachal and really began to soul search and look for answers. When I got to the McLeod Ganj Mountains, I got off the bus and headed straight to the nearest barber - I asked him to shave all my hair off. He looked at me in disbelief because I had really long, thick, beautiful hair - but on my insistence, he went on to do it. For the next few days, I was in the mountains, meditating, just by myself and I experienced a high like never before - I felt free and liberated.\n\nIt changed my life - I found answers and peace within me. Shaving my head wasn\u2019t a haphazard decision that I took over night - it was something I needed to do for ME. It symbolized leaving my old thoughts, grudges, negative and self-destructive patterns behind. For me, those days of soul searching were the most precious - I looked in the mirror and loved myself. I found myself beautiful and didn\u2019t need any external validation for it. I left the mountains, a new person and then came back home to a mixed reaction. People asked me if I was a lesbian, I had a disease or if someone had passed away - but it didn\u2019t phase me\u2026I was too busy in love with myself to really bother!\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the biggest answer she got during her journey, she spoke about being comfortable with pain and how we should not hold onto the past. Holding on to the past means holding onto a ghost and the truth is right there, but we choose not to see it and that is to let it all go.\n\n'Sometimes pain is comfortable. We stay in a particular situation or go back to the past, only because it\u2019s comfortable - but to hold onto the past, is to hold on to a ghost and the truth is right there, but we choose not to see it and that is to let it all go. Accept, embrace and let it pass, but more importantly love yourself FIERCELY through it all, because that\u2019s when you need it the most,\u201d she said.\n\nSo many of us look at ourselves through other people's lenses - what they think about us, how they would perceive our actions. We stifle our desires and dreams to fit into someone else's idea of happy and ideal. This ultimately makes us unhappy and we feel trapped.\n\nSo, whether it's taking a solo trip or shaving your head off or getting a tattoo or ending a relationship or quitting an overly demanding job, do it - do what makes you feel happy, and what feels right to you.", "description": "Amidst the noise of the traffic, the stress of work life and fast pace of life - we have forgotten to take care of ourselves.
