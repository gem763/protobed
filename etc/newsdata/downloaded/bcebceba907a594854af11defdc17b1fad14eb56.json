Morgan Stanley analysts projected a $264 million third-quarter hit to Goldman's shares in The We Company.\n\nFurther, during its late-September earnings report, the investment bank Jefferies announced a much bigger $146 million hit to earnings stemming from WeWork.\n\nRead more: An expert who studies venture capital says the WeWork 'smackdown' won't change the way the industry works \u2014 but he's telling investors how they can avoid the same mistake\n\nGoldman fell as much as 3.5% on Tuesday after releasing its third-quarter report. The bank posted a decline in investment-banking revenue and missed analysts estimates for quarterly earnings per share. Goldman's profits were dragged down by numerous poorly performing investments apart from its stake in WeWork, including bets on Uber and Tradeweb.\n\nAt the same time, WeWork bonds tumbled to record lows as the firm is reportedly eyeing a risky refinancing package from JPMorgan. Though the deal would secure cash that WeWork was previously expecting to take in from its initial public offering, the firm still faces murky financial prospects following its slashed valuation.\n\nGoldman Sachs traded at $205.29 a share as of 12:30 p.m. ET on Tuesday, up roughly 23% year-to-date.\n\nThe investment bank has 11 \"buy\" ratings, 12 \"hold\" ratings, and two \"sell\" ratings from analysts, with a consensus price target of $235.76, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nNow read more markets coverage from Markets Insider and Business Insider:\n\nWells Fargo posts earnings miss driven by $1.6 billion expense linked to scandals\n\nCitigroup posts strong trading results amid layoffs, beats profit estimates\n\nElite law firm Irell & Manella \u2014 where partners make more than $3 million a year \u2014 is seeing turbulence and departures after merger talks with a rival firm fell apart\n\nMarkets Insider", "description": "Goldman Sachs recorded an $80 million hit from its investment in WeWork, the bank's CFO said on an earnings call.
