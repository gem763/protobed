On Tuesday, we saw the indexes down quite handily in the final hour of trading, as the software stocks were weak most of the day, allowing the bears to tug the bulls over the line, but then we rallied and the tug of war went back to the center.\n\nThe one thing that changed on Thursday was that for the first time we saw the S&P 500 rally almost 6 points and breadth was negative. It wasn't negative by that much at minus 230 issues, but negative breadth, if it continues, will change the indicators, so there was a slight change on Thursday.\n\nI also find it interesting that we got overbought this week, and the Overbought/Oversold Oscillator tends to reflect the movement in the Russell 2000 rather closely. Would it surprise you that the Russell 2000 has closed at 1550 three days this week, with one day at 1552? That's the overbought condition hard at work.\n\nWe are working the overbought condition off, but so far the Oscillator has not moved enough to fuss.", "description": "As bulls gain rope vs. the bears, surprises such as Amazon's earnings fire off....TXN", "authors": ["Helene Meisler", "Tape Bombs Are Latest Weapon In Market'S Tug Of War", "As Bulls Gain Rope Vs.
