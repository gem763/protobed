During the runway presentation, a series of four models wore collegiate-style hoodies, emblazoned with the names of schools and colleges where mass shootings have occurred: Stoneman Douglas, Columbine, Virginia Tech and Sandy Hook.\n\nThe hoodies also appeared distressed, with tears and holes that many on social media took to resemble bullet holes.\n\nOn his Instagram, Owens shared a photo of the collection\u2019s show notes, which are commonly used to explain a designer\u2019s inspiration and the reasoning behind the collection.\n\n\u201cSometimes life can be painfully ironic. Like the irony of dying violently in a place you considered to be a safe, controlled environment, like school,\u201d the note says. \u201c\u2018Samsara\u2019 is the cycle we must transcend to reach Nirvana.\u201d\n\nIn a statement sent to TIME, Bstroy\u2019s co-founder Grams said that he and Owens are using their platform to shed light on important issues \u2014 in this instance specifically, the statement says, they hoped to go deeper than the \u201csurface layer\u201d conversations on gun violence in schools.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to make a comment on gun violence and the type of gun violence that needs preventative attention and what its origins are,\u201d the statement read of their newest designs, \u201cwhile also empowering the survivors of tragedy through storytelling in the clothes.\u201d\n\nThey did not immediately respond to a follow-up question as to whether Bstroy had consulted with any survivors of the shootings named on the hoodies.\n\nBstroy recently appeared in a New York Times profile highlighting trendsetters in the streetwear industry. \u201cWe are making violent statements,\u201d the designers told the Times. \u201cThat\u2019s for you to know who we are, so we can have a voice in the market. But eventually that voice will say things that everyone can wear.\u201d\n\nThe spring 2020 collection also included two T-shirts with the slogan \u201cBSTROY COMBAT SCHOOL.\u201d Three other shirts featured what appear to be gun violence-themed tabloid newspaper covers. One model was also styled as though bleeding from a wound at his throat.\n\nThe Times profile noted that gun motifs, and commentary on gun violence, has also featured in the label\u2019s previous collections, citing \u201cgraphic T-shirts that nod to preppy interests like tennis and fencing, but with the sports gear replaced by guns.\u201d\n\nFashion designers have long incorporated provocative, politicized messaging and imagery into their clothes. In an August profile in The Face, Bstory cite their debut 2013 fashion show, which they presented in an Atlanta subway station, as an example of this. They said in that show they wanted to highlight what they say as the city\u2019s failing public transportation system and what \u201cthey attribute to the Repub\u00adli\u00adcan state\u2019s desire to keep black peo\u00adple in the inner city.\u201d\n\nCriticism of the designs has mounted after the label shared the collection on social media.\n\nDelaney Tarr, a survivor of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school shooting in Parkland and March for Our Lives co-founder, called the hoodies \u201cdisgusting\u201d and \u201cunacceptable\u201d in a tweet.\n\n\u201cThis is just absolutely horrific,\u201d an account dedicated to Victoria Soto, a teacher killed in the shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school, tweeted. \u201cA company is make light of our pain and other\u2019s pain for fashion.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder what scenario could somebody think this was a good idea?\u201d added Fred Guttenberg, father of Parkland victim Jamie Guttenberg. Parkland survivor Cameron Kasky echoed these sentiments in an Instagram comment, noting incredulously that \u201cthere were multiple people who thought this was a good idea.\u201d\n\nSurvivors, loved ones, and those with connections to all four shootings have been among those leaving incensed comments.\n\n\u201cThere are so many ways to use fashion and clothing to make sociopolitical commentary\u2014this isn\u2019t it. How do you think the parents who saw their children\u2019s clothing with bullet holes through them feel seeing this?,\u201d one comment read.\n\n\u201cThe dudes who are gonna be wearing this hoodie aren\u2019t activists who wanna spread awareness. They\u2019re just tryna flex. It\u2019s all materialism, no activism,\u201d another person commented.\n\nIn the statement to TIME, Grams noted that the hoodies \u201d were initially intended to be just for the show,\u201d but that in light of the response the brand is now considering putting them for sale. Similar garments currently for sale on the label\u2019s website are listed at $210.\n\n\u201cSomething interesting happens when making a statement so loud about something so obviously sensitive,\u201d Grams said to TIME, acknowledging the backlash. \u201cPeople get the opportunity to form their opinions before they get all the information\u2026 People seem to want to release hateful energy as a default, rather than waiting to hear an explanation.\n\n\u201cOur image as young black males has not been traditionally awarded credit for introducing avant-garde ideas, [and] many people have assumed our message to be lazy just because of what they\u2019ve been taught about black men,\u201d he continues. \u201cThese hoodies were made with all of these intentions in mind. To explore all of these societal issues\u2026 [and] the different ways that we relate to each other and the dated ideas that still shape the assumptions we make about each other.\u201d\n\n\u201cArt\u2019s job is to wring emotion out,\u201d Grams concludes. \u201cWhat we do with it after is subjective and on us.\u201d\n\nWrite to Josiah Bates at josiah.bates@time.com.", "description": "During the label's spring 2020 runway presentation, models wore hoodies emblazoned with the names of schools where mass shootings occurred.", "authors": ["Josiah Bates"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/marjory-stoneman-douglas-report.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
