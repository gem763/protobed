Now they can probably survive without them, Gates said in an interview with Bloomberg Television.\n\n\u201cThe tax benefits there should be shifted into things that are more limiting, like energy storage, offshore wind -- which still has a huge premium price,\u201d said Gates, who co-chairs a global group of business, political and scientific leaders formed in 2018 to push for investments to help the world adapt to climate change.\n\nU.S. states including New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts see proposed offshore wind farms in the Atlantic Ocean as crucial ingredients to phase out fossil fuels and fight climate change. But the costs of building wind farms at sea are still nearly twice as high as on land. Energy storage, meanwhile, is key to allowing wind and solar plants to dispatch power even when the sun sets and breezes go slack. But big batteries remain expensive, too.\n\n\u201cThe progress in solar and wind is very helpful,\u201d Gates said. \u201cBut the sun doesn\u2019t shine 24 hours a day.\u201d\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Christopher Martin in New York at cmartin11@bloomberg.net;Erik Schatzker in New York at eschatzker@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Lynn Doan at ldoan6@bloomberg.net, Joe Ryan, Steven Frank\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- It\u2019s time wind and solar passed their subsidies along to emerging technologies that need them more, Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates says.After decades of government incentives, wind and solar have been deployed widely enough for manufacturers and developers to become increasingly", "authors": ["Christopher Martin", "Erik Schatzker"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/br5zZ5YZndMvMPG0jJkWBA--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/ea723ba167fa4224625ac9e01b86b120", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
