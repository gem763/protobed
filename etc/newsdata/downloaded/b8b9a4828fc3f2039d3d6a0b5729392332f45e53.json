Higher risk loan-to-value deals got more expensive over the same period.\n\nTwo-year fixed 95 per cent LTV deals rose by 0.03 per cent to 3.26 per cent and the five-year average rate at 95 per cent LTV nudged up 0.01 per cent to 3.64 per cent.\n\nCook added: 'With the historic two-year fixes coming to an end this month, this may perhaps explain further why lenders are focusing on the lower-LTV tiers when competing on margins.\n\n'Not only do mortgage providers need to compete for new business, but they also need to keep an eye on retaining their existing borrowers, keeping in touch with competitors' mortgage rates to ensure that current customers consider their existing borrower products as their first option to remortgage.'\n\n>> Read our regularly updated 'what next for mortgages?' guide by clicking here", "description": "Some 850,000 homeowners will see fixed rate deals end in the next six months, according to Compare the Market.
