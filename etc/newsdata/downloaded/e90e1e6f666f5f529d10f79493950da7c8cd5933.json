There are various schools of thought on how much money you'll need to live comfortably during retirement. No matter what that figure is, it's essential to be proactive about saving if you want to reach your retirement goals.\n\nWhile many people save for retirement in employer-sponsored plans like 401(k)s and 403(b)s, they're not always an option. But good news: There are lots of other ways to build up that nest egg. Here's how you can reach your retirement savings goals, even if you don't have a 401(k).\n\nKey Takeaways A lot of people have 401(k)s at work, but there are other ways to save for retirement if you don't have access to one.\n\nIndividual retirement accounts (IRAs) are easy to set up and manage, and they offer valuable tax advantages.\n\nYou can also save (and grow) your money in a brokerage account, annuity, real estate, and small business.\n\nIndividual Retirement Accounts (IRAs)\n\nIRAs are tax-advantaged accounts that hold investments you choose. There are two main types of IRAs: traditional and Roth. The biggest difference between the two is when you pay your taxes.\n\nWith traditional IRAs, you get to deduct your contributions the year you make them. Then, when you start taking out money during retirement, those withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.\n\nRoth IRAs work the opposite. You don't get a tax break when you add money to the account. But qualified withdrawals\u2014those made after age 59 1/2 and when it's been at least five years since you first contributed to a Roth\u2014are tax-free. And you can withdraw your contributions at any time, for any reason, with no taxes or penalties.\n\nThe biggest drawback to saving in a traditional or Roth IRA is the low contribution limit. And if you make too much money, you can't contribute at all to a Roth.\n\nFor 2019, you can stash up to $6,000, or $7,000 if you're age 50 or older. Still, if you max out your IRA every year, you could end up with a tidy sum by the time you reach retirement. Of course, the sooner you start, the better.\n\nBrokerage Accounts\n\nOf course, higher-risk investments like individual stocks have the potential to earn more than low-risk investments like CDs\u2014but you could lose money. Bonds, CDs, and money market funds are more conservative, but they provide stability to a portfolio that is beneficial in the long run. The trick is to find a balance that you're comfortable with, and that will help you reach your savings goals.\n\nBe sure to pay attention to fees. Even tiny differences in fees can have a huge impact on your nest egg over time.\n\nThere's no standard formula for deciding how much of your money to put in high-risk, high-reward investments. In general, however, most people taper off the risk as they get closer to retirement, when they would have fewer years to recover from large losses. Still, people are living longer today, so just because you're in your 60s doesn't mean you need to sell your stocks.\n\nTax-Deferred Annuities\n\nAnnuities offer another way to reach your retirement savings goal. Offered through insurance companies, annuities provide tax deferral coupled with varied investment opportunities. Annuities are available with:\n\nA fixed interest rate\n\nAn indexed interest rate, based on the performance of a specific index\n\nA variable rate, tied to market performance\n\nThe money you stash in an annuity grows tax-deferred but becomes taxable once you withdraw money in retirement. In addition to tax deferral, annuities can provide a guaranteed income stream for a certain number of years or for a lifetime.\n\nAnnuities aren't appropriate for every investor. They're only backed by the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company, and there's no guaranteed investment performance. Also, annuities tend to be expensive\u2014meaning, you might end up paying a lot in fees.\n\nIt pays to be cautious if you're considering an annuity. \u201cAnnuities are contracts with life insurance companies, and there is a long history of manipulative insurance agents selling annuities for the large commissions they earn, rather than for the benefit of the investor,\" says James B. Twining, CFP\u00ae, founder and CEO of Financial Plan, Inc., in Bellingham, Wash.\n\n\"These commission-based annuities are typically more expensive than other collective equity securities such as mutual funds and ETFs. It is not unusual to find annuities with total annual costs in excess of 4% per year\u2014a tremendous headwind that results in poor performance net of expenses.\u201d\n\nReal Estate Investments\n\nAnother way to save for retirement is an investment in real estate. If you have an IRA or brokerage account, you may already have access to the real estate sector through a mutual fund or an ETF.\n\n\u201cThe best option for investors is to buy into a fund that itself invests in real estate investment trusts (REITs) around the world,\u201d says Mark Hebner of Index Fund Advisors in Irvine, Calif.\n\n\u201cREITs are extremely cost-effective, transparent, and liquid. Gaining access to REITs through a mutual fund allows investors to gain global diversification in real estate in a cost-effective way.\u201d\n\nOutside of REITs, you can buy real estate outright to generate an income stream during your retirement years. If you invest in a multi-family home, for instance, you can live in one section and rent out the other. This effectively reduces your total living expenses while paying down the mortgage.\n\nLater, you can decide to continue to rent out the property\u2014and receive a steady income from rents. Alternatively, you can sell the (ideally appreciated) home and use the proceeds for living expenses or other investments.\n\nInvest in a Small Business\n\nAnother option to help you reach your retirement goals is to invest in a small business. A small business investment doesn't necessarily mean becoming a business owner. If you don't want to drive the ship, you can invest in an established company as a silent partner.\n\nWhether you choose entrepreneurship or investing, small business profits are not capped and the potential return on investment is higher than other alternatives. Of course, these investments carry with them a great deal of risk. There's no guarantee that the time or money you invest in a small business will generate a substantial return over time.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWhen a 401(k) is not an option, you still have a number of ways to invest for your post-work years. It's always a good idea to work with a trusted financial advisor, especially if you opt for any higher-risk investments.", "description": "Retirement planning is tricky, especially if you don't have a 401(k).
