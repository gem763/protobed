Gulfstream's new G700, with an expected debut in 2022, will be capable of flying 7500 nautical miles (13,890km) and cruising at just under the speed of sound.\n\nThe $US76 million Gulfstream G700 will be able to travel at just under the speed of sound. Bloomberg\n\nThe G700 has \"the tallest, widest, longest cabin in our industry\", Gulfstream president Mark Burns said at a private jet conference late on Monday in Las Vegas.\n\nGulfstream, a unit of General Dynamics, is betting that the $US76 million ($111 million) G700 will entice the world's wealthiest flyers with the bigger cabin and an upgraded range. The launch customer is Qatar Airways, which has ordered 10 aircraft for its charter service Qatar Executive.\n\nBut buyer unease is mounting in the luxury jet market. A slowdown in orders could cause deliveries to begin flagging in 2021, according to a study by Honeywell International. While an array of new aircraft models is expected to boost shipments this year and next, longer-term threats are emerging from the US-China trade war, the UK's looming break from the European Union, and a shaky global economy.", "description": "Gulfstream's new $111 million G700, with an expected debut in 2022, will be capable of flying 13,890km and cruising at just under the speed of sound.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2648%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_68/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e6015c45f478f53c15271d82a20d9fc5e322a03f", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
