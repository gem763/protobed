I don\u2019t know what is happening, we cannot score even one goal in two games.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to say something, sorry to the fans, we will keep fighting for sure. We will come back but at the moment we are in a difficult situation.\n\n\u201cThe whole season has been not good, so keep going, keep fighting, and let\u2019s see what happens in the next games.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, former United defender Gary Neville blamed the club\u2019s transfer policy for their current struggles.\n\n\u201cAway from home, they\u2019re not set up to win in a sense of the mentality. They let games drift, I think they play OK in games, but they\u2019re not ruthless, they\u2019re not clinical,\u201d Neville told Sky Sports.\n\n\u201cThe quality is not right, the depth of their squad is not good enough and they have taken a step back.\n\n\u201cTheir recruitment has been bad now and woeful. They need five or six top players into that squad, and are going to cost a lot.\n\n\u201cThey (club board) have cocked this up over many years. They cocked it up, they are responsible for this, with poor recruitment and selection of managers.\u201d", "description": "Newcastle (United Kingdom) (AFP) \u2013 David de Gea apologised to Manchester United supporters after his troubled side slumped to a dismal 1-0 defeat at", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/06/cc82a2_manchester-united-goalkeeper-david-de-gea-apologised-loss-newcastle-de-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
