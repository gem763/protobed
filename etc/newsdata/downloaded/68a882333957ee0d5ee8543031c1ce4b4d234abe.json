Certainly the last few years we improved a hell of a lot,\" he said.\n\n\"We planned to win trophies and we haven't managed to do that but I'd certainly like to think I've contributed a little bit in improving the club.\n\n\"Obviously this year was a disaster, I guess. Injuries, off-field [incidents] \u2013 all sorts of little things that you can never write in a fairytale ending. Sometimes that's just life, it throws curve balls.\n\n\"It was very hard to take and disappointing to finish on that note but I'd like to think I've given my everything for the last six years.\"\n\nWiddop will represent England in the World Nines, although it will be a first, having not played in the NRL Nines for the Dragons.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/2ea290d397c26bdc41addb75603dd6f4", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
