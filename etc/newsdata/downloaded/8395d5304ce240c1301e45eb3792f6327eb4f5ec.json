The Kurds in recent days struck a deal with the Syrian government and Russia to help them against the Turks.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got a lot of sand over there,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo there\u2019s a lot of sand that they can play with.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur soldiers are not in harm\u2019s way. As they shouldn\u2019t be,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the Kurds are much safer right now. But the Kurds know how to fight and, as I said, they\u2019re not angels.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s characterization of the state of play in Syria encountered criticism from Republicans on Capitol Hill on Wednesday in the latest display of how his decision to pull U.S. troops from the area has drawn bipartisan condemnation.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., told reporters he didn\u2019t know what could be done to undo the harm that has resulted from the withdrawal.\n\n\u201cThere are some mistakes that are not easy to reverse. And there are some that are irreversible,\u201d said Rubio, who was a Trump rival for the GOP presidential nomination in 2016.\n\nSen. Mitt Romney of Utah, the GOP\u2019s 2012 presidential nominee, said Turkey is \u201cgoing into Syria and wiping out our friends\u201d and \u201cthat\u2019s shame on us for having taken the decision.\u201d\n\nTrump, in his Oval Office remarks, said U.S. troops are \u201clargely out\u201d of the area.\n\nHowever, a U.S. official familiar with planning for the withdrawal of the approximately 1,000 troops in northeastern Syria said that while the soldiers are consolidating onto two main bases, they have not yet begun flying out of Syria in significant numbers. Military equipment is being gathered and flown out, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the withdrawal, which poses big security risks.\n\nTrump downplayed the crisis that followed his decision to pull out of Syria, which critics say amounted to giving Turkey a green light to invade Syria\u2019s northeast, where it has been attacking Kurdish fighters whom Turkey views as terrorists.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not between Turkey and the United States, like a lot of stupid people would like you to believe,\u201d Trump said, adding that he\u2019s more than willing to let adversaries fight it out in that area of the Middle East.\n\nAs for the Kurds, whom Trump has been criticized for abandoning, he said, \u201cSyria\u2019s friendly with the Kurds. The Kurds are very well protected. Plus, they know how to fight. And, by the way, they\u2019re no angels.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, he said, \u201cOur soldiers are not in harm\u2019s way, as they shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d\n\nHe answered reporters\u2019 questions as he met at the White House with Italian President Sergio Mattarella.\n\nTurkey launched a military operation against Kurdish fighters allied with the United States after Trump pulled troops from the region earlier this month. His decision was strongly condemned in the U.S. \u2014 including by usual Republican allies in Congress \u2014 and around the world as contributing to regional instability and the abandonment of an ally.\n\nHe noted that Syria was getting \u201csome help with Russia and that\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Russia wants to get involved with Syria, that\u2019s really up to them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not our border. We shouldn\u2019t be losing lives over it.\u201d\n\nTrump imposed new sanctions on Turkey this week in an attempt to force President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to end his assault. Trump is also sending a delegation led by Vice President Mike Pence to Turkey to meet with Erdogan in an attempt to help negotiate a cease-fire.\n\nTrump said the U.S. shouldn\u2019t be involved in \u201cendless wars\u201d in the Middle East and \u201cit\u2019s time for us to come home.\u201d\n\nThe president said that if Syria wants to fight over land that doesn\u2019t belong to the U.S., \u201cthat\u2019s up to them and Turkey.\u201d\n\nEven as Trump defended his removal of U.S. troops from northeastern Syria, he praised his decision to send more troops and military equipment to Saudi Arabia to help the kingdom defend against Iran.\n\nTrump said the U.S. is sending missiles and \u201cgreat power\u201d to the Saudis, and \u201cthey\u2019re paying for that.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP writer Ellen Knickmeyer contributed.", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump declared Wednesday that Turkey's attacks in Syria against Kurdish fighters who fought alongside American soldiers", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/16/b4a6c3_trump-18367-donald-trump-president-donald-trump-speaks-meeting-italian-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
