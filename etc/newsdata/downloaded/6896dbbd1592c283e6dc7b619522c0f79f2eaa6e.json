Stanton played in only 18 regular-season games this year because of injury problems. He returned in mid-September and hit a couple homers as the Yankees wrapped up their 103-win campaign.\n\nNow it\u2019s on to an American League Division Series against Minnesota that will feature the most prolific home run-hitting teams in baseball history. The Twins edged the Yankees by one, finishing with a record 307.\n\nThere is certainly some history between these two teams - and it\u2019s mostly been unpleasant for Minnesota. The Twins have been eliminated by the Yankees in five of Minnesota\u2019s last six postseason appearances.\n\nThe other Division Series matchup that\u2019s already set in stone is Atlanta vs. St. Louis.\n\nAfter eight seasons with the Marlins, Stanton arrived in New York last year and finally made his postseason debut, although it was a fairly short one. The Yankees won the wild card game and then lost to Boston in the ALDS. Stanton had one extra-base hit - a homer - in five postseason games.\n\nHe has hit three homers in his injury-plagued 2019, but now October offers a second chance to shine.\n\nElsewhere around the majors:\n\nHOSTING\n\nThe Nationals shrugged off a poor start this year and won 93 games, earning a chance to host the National League wild card game against Milwaukee. Washington won its final eight games of the regular season.\n\nThe Nats will try to reverse their trend of postseason disappointments. Washington hosted winner-take-all Game 5s in the Division Series in 2012, 2016 and 2017 and lost all three of those to the Cardinals, Dodgers and Cubs.\n\nMilwaukee had a chance to win the NL Central after winning 18 of 20 games from Sept. 6-26. But the Brewers were swept in their final three-game series at Colorado and settled for the second wild card.\n\nHIGHLIGHT\n\nThe Seattle Mariners missed the postseason for an 18th straight year, but their fans did get to participate in an emotional moment this week when they showed their appreciation for longtime ace F\u00e9lix Hern\u00e1ndez.\n\nHern\u00e1ndez had tears in his eyes when he left the mound Thursday in the sixth inning against Oakland. He says he\u2019d like to keep pitching, but he\u2019s unlikely to be back with Seattle, and Mariners fans did a fine job paying tribute.\n\nLINE OF THE WEEK\n\nThe night before Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s goodbye, the Mariners hosted Houston, and Astros starter Zack Greinke nearly made a different kind of history.\n\nGreinke came within two outs of pitching the third no-hitter by Houston this year. He lost his chance when Seattle\u2019s Austin Nola singled in the ninth inning. Greinke ended up allowing two hits and a walk in 8 1/3 scoreless innings, striking out nine.\n\nHouston nearly became the first team to throw three no-hitters in a season. Justin Verlander pitched one Sept. 1, and the Astros had a combined no-hitter Aug. 3.\n\nThe Mariners were on the losing end of that combined no-hitter, as well as another combined effort by the Los Angeles Angels on July 12. They narrowly avoided becoming the first team to be no-hit three times in a year.\n\n___\n\nFollow Noah Trister at https://twitter.com/noahtrister\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The New York Yankees hit 306 home runs this year with minimal contributions from Giancarlo Stanton.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Noah Trister"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/28/yankees_rangers_baseball_05213_c0-281-3868-2536_s1770x1032.jpg?ad4ac7c2290bce3cda2f9ea66bfaf6a8d8549364", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
