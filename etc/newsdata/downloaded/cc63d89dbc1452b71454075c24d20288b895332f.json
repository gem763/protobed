Purchasing the collector\u2019s edition of the original game back in 2004, where these three rare in-game companions were a bonus, was a fluke. Now I\u2019ve brought them into World of Warcraft Classic. Since the cuddly trio are the only exclusive pets spawnable in World of Warcraft Classic, I can\u2019t help being just a little proud.\n\nMy normal attitude toward exclusive in-game items is \u201ceh.\u201d Limited edition mounts, pets, and equipment are nice and flashy, but there will come a day when I am no longer playing a game, and any cosmetic items my character has in their possession will be nothing more than data stored on a server, waiting to be wiped. World of Warcraft is no different.\n\nJust because the series has clung to me for 15 years and shows no signs of loosening its grip does not mean the time will not come when it\u2019s all behind me. However, the game\u2019s longstanding importance in my life has endeared the pets from the first collector\u2019s edition to me more than most.\n\nFrom around the game\u2019s launch in 2004 until Blizzard created a dedicated pet menu in September of 2012, every new World of Warcraft character I created was born with a gift voucher in their inventory. Opening that voucher would initiate a \u201cWelcome to Warcraft\u201d quest. Turning in the quest allowed me to select from one of three pets \u2014 the panda, Mini diablo, or a zergling from StarCraft.\n\nI\u2019d receive an item used to spawn whichever pet I chose, which would follow my character around during their Azerothian adventures. World of Warcraft Classic rolls back the clock to before the game\u2019s pet panel. The gift voucher is back. Once again, every new character makes the choice.\n\nWhat\u2019s different in the rough-and-tumble world of vanilla WoW redux is that there are no other exclusive collector\u2019s items in the game. Murky, the exclusive pet from Blizzcon 2005, is not in the game. There wouldn\u2019t be new collector\u2019s edition pets until the Netherwhelp included in 2007\u2019s The Burning Crusade expansion.\n\nEven the digital flying mounts included with the special collector\u2019s edition version of World of Warcraft Classic can only be spawned in the modern version of the game, since there was no flying until 2007.\n\nSeeing a player running around in Classic with Diablo, the panda, or the zergling is a sure sign that they\u2019ve either been playing World of Warcraft since the very beginning or spent a whole lot of money on eBay. While running around Westfall the other day I ran into a player with a panda while I had Diablo out. We hugged each other\u2019s pets. It was a beautiful.\n\nWhat\u2019s fun is I never meant to purchase the Collector\u2019s Edition of World of Warcraft. When the game launched in 2004 I wasn\u2019t all that interested in playing. I had fooled around in the beta and did not like the game. I found it boring.\n\nIt was my girlfriend at the time who fell in love with the game. I picked up the regular edition on a whim when it came out. I think one of my co-workers at the time was playing.\n\nI created a little female gnome and my then-girlfriend all but pushed me out of the chair, taking my place at the keyboard. I was forced to run to the store to get another copy of the game, and by that point all my local GameStop had left was a single Collector\u2019s Edition.\n\nThe rest is panda, zergling, and adorable-lord-of-evil history.", "description": "I never intended to have tiny Diablo, zergling, and Panda pets following me around World of Warcraft.
