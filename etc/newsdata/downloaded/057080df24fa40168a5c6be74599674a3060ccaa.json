This time it was a whistleblower from the IRS who was making some vague claims about audits of either President Trump\u2019s or Vice President Pence\u2019s tax returns.\n\nNEW: An IRS official has filed a whistleblower complaint reporting that he was told at least one Treasury Department political appointee attempted to improperly interfere with the annual audit of the president or vice president\u2019s tax returns https://t.co/v5Hp2FktrB \u2014 Yashar Ali \ud83d\udc18 (@yashar) October 3, 2019\n\nSo the same bureaucrats who targeted Tea Party groups now have a gripe with President Trump? Shocking. Here we go again. Another so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u201d without firsthand information.https://t.co/QBIpahuGwT \u2014 Rep. Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan) October 3, 2019\n\nWe kept an eye on it, but by Friday the story had just sort of evaporated. It did produce, however, a great thread from UndercoverDC editor Tracy Beanz:\n\nI have to write this thread. Stick with me here. There\u2019s a new \u201cwhistleblower\u201d, this time from the *gasp* IRS! Already, reports indicate they have hearsay, and already, reports indicate that a member of a committee knew of the supposed complaint a month ago. I\u2019m about to (cont) \u2014 Tracy Beanz (@tracybeanz) October 3, 2019\n\nthread out a number of different things and I hope you will stick with me and wait until the end. In case you haven\u2019t noticed, all of our career, corrupt, politicians are STUNNED that Donald J. Trump has remained a law abiding citizen his ENTIRE LIFE. \u2014 Tracy Beanz (@tracybeanz) October 3, 2019\n\nThey\u2019ve dug through literally EVERYTHING at this point- businesses, relationships, taxes, affiliations, his kids and theirs \u2013 EVERYTHING \u2013 and even a corrupt team of prosecutors spending millions of our tax dollars couldn\u2019t find one SINGLE THING to charge him with. NOT ONE. \u2014 Tracy Beanz (@tracybeanz) October 3, 2019\n\nThey even spent THREE YEARS attempting to ENTRAP him into a crime, and failed miserably. They indicted Michael Flynn on a ham sandwich, and still couldn\u2019t get a SINGLE SOLITARY thing on Trump. \u2014 Tracy Beanz (@tracybeanz) October 3, 2019\n\nThey went so far as to convince someone who worked for him to plead guilty to something THAT WAS NOT EVEN A CRIME (Cohen- campaign finance) to try to taint him. Nothing has worked. The only thing they even came REMOTELY close with, (and even that is weak as heck) \u2014 Tracy Beanz (@tracybeanz) October 3, 2019\n\nwas the infidelity, but guess what?! WE. DON\u2019T. CARE. So, they have to think the American people are complete morons to believe that NOW after three years, we are going to believe that two \u201cwhistleblowers\u201d coming forward in a period of a few weeks\u2026 \u2014 Tracy Beanz (@tracybeanz) October 3, 2019\n\nafter the former corrupt CIA director and a former turncoat sellout told the ENTIRE WORLD that they were planning this would make us blink. Remember when Maddow was all excited about Trumps tax returns? She opened them on live TV and she was all excited, only to find out \u2014 Tracy Beanz (@tracybeanz) October 3, 2019\n\nthat our President\u2026 paid more taxes than most of the folks in Congress, a presidential candidate who preaches socialism, AND HER OWN NETWORK. At this point you would have to be completely brainwashed to believe that any of this is actually substantive. Right \u2013 ALL OF A SUDDEN \u2014 Tracy Beanz (@tracybeanz) October 3, 2019\n\nat the EXACT SAME TIME all of these supposed \u201cnoble arbiters of truth whistleblowers\u201d are coming forward with their claims of horrific wrongdoing by the President and his team. This is utter ridiculousness. They are faking polls, they are literally fabricating things out of thin \u2014 Tracy Beanz (@tracybeanz) October 3, 2019\n\nair, they are calling for his first amendment rights to be revoked, the death penalty, solitary confinement, the list goes on and on and on\u2026 Want to know why? Because the American CITIZEN is ruining their gravy train, totalitarian plan for domination, \u2014 Tracy Beanz (@tracybeanz) October 3, 2019\n\nand they are scared shitless. In addition to that, and as I\u2019ve said many times before \u2013 they would NEVER do this if they thought they were safe. Never in a GAZILLION years. Every single dirty politician is out there accusing Trump of the crimes they themselves \u2014 Tracy Beanz (@tracybeanz) October 3, 2019\n\ncommitted, and it\u2019s gotten so bad for them that they are now LITERALLY GASLIGHTING people who still watch their irrelevant networks. They tried illegal immigration for votes, that didn\u2019t work. They\u2019ve lost the minority vote and the black vote because these groups are doing better \u2014 Tracy Beanz (@tracybeanz) October 3, 2019\n\nthan ever before under our \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d president who is \u201cliterally Hitler\u201d and NOTHING ELSE IS WORKING. They tried beating us in the streets, using their programmed celebrities against us, hijacking music and comedy, boycotts, doxxing, attacking CHILDREN, \u2014 Tracy Beanz (@tracybeanz) October 3, 2019\n\nand NOTHING IS WORKING. Indictments are coming. There are few reasons for this freak out outside of the obvious and this is one. Three years is long enough to have gotten rid of most of the traitors on staff making decisions and another FOUR YEARS of Washington DC cleanup by \u2014 Tracy Beanz (@tracybeanz) October 3, 2019\n\na law and order, red, white, and blue, AMERICA LOVING PRESIDENT?! They are FINISHED. What you are witnessing is the last gasps of a dying snake that had its head chopped off, flailing around trying to figure out how to save itself. The problem? We are holding its head. \u2014 Tracy Beanz (@tracybeanz) October 3, 2019\n\nStay strong. Watch for REAL news and information. Inform yourselves. Vote like your life depended on it (it does). Take a victory lap. Because in this battle of good vs. evil, good is winning, and good? It\u2019s all of you. God bless Donald J. Trump and may God bless all of you. pic.twitter.com/hf82IIrpAV \u2014 Tracy Beanz (@tracybeanz) October 3, 2019\n\nBoom.\n\nThank you Tracy! I\u2019m praying you are right! \u2014 LWinter (@LilLubbie) October 3, 2019\n\nWe think she\u2019s right about plenty of things, although we doubt indictments are coming soon. We\u2019ve been waiting for that for years.\n\nI agree \ud83d\udcaf. God is with us and our President. Keep praying Patriots, our Country is at stake.\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 \u2014 Nancy Q Wellthenwaritis (@NancymkQ) October 4, 2019\n\nWell said Tracy\u2026and very true\u2026God Bless President Trump for everything he has put up with from these evil deranged lunatics, and God Bless all American loving patriots willing to fight alongside him in this epic battle ! \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 \u2014 #LisaB\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@kookoobird7) October 4, 2019\n\n#wethepeople say: we are talking about the same IRS who willfully targeted Christian and conservative nonprofits as well individuals. Second hand hearsay. These people are against freedom and seek to remove your freedoms as much as possible as quickly as possible. \u2014 Gwell (@Gwell1984) October 4, 2019\n\nI suspect there will be more or these so called whistle blowers \u2013 it\u2019s all BS, but it will confuse the general public especially all those who just get drive by news..if they get multiple of these going it could just clog things up. It ruining it for TRUE whistle blowers..sad \u2014 N Smith \ud83d\udc8e (@lobsterboy98) October 4, 2019\n\nWell said Tracy , it\u2019s hard to keep our hopes up during these times , but this gives me a little faith that every single one will be held accountable! \u2014 Angela (@acmom62) October 4, 2019\n\nThis thread is as good as it gets. \ud83d\ude0d\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83d\udc4d \u2014 John (@john_jjsjr) October 4, 2019\n\nI haven't heard a word about a blue wave this election cycle. \u2014 michael\u274c (@hebaisgood) October 4, 2019\n\nThis\u2026.
