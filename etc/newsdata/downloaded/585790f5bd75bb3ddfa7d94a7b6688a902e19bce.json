How much more enjoyable would that be with the World Cup?\u2019\n\nGatland laughed, before saying: \u2018I\u2019m not sure the WRU would let me take the World Cup back to New Zealand.\u2019\n\nThe Japan Rugby Football Union have opened talks with head coach Jamie Joseph about a new contract.\n\nJoseph\u2019s team inspired the nation with their run to the quarter-finals and the coach has been linked with a return to New Zealand.
