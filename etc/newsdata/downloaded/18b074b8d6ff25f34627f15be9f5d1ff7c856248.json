In this article, we look at what to expect at the meeting, as well as how the is setting up leading into the event.\n\nWhen is the Mini Budget Speech?\n\nThe Medium-Term Budget Policy Speech (MTBPS) will take place on the 30th of October 2019 as confirmed by National Treasury (on Tuesday the 22nd of October 2019). The date is a shift from the meeting previously scheduled for the 23rd of October 2019, moved in lieu of accommodating international work commitments of the Minister of Finance, Tito Mboweni and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.\n\nWhat to expect from the MTBPS?\n\nThe MTBPS will update February\u2019s budget, outlining the policy framework for 2020, highlighting any adjustments to be recommended to parliament relative to current expenditure plans.\n\nNational Treasury continues to realize tax shortfalls, despite recent efforts to increase collections. Economic conditions remain depressed, placing a drag on both corporate income tax as well as VAT revenue. The forecast for economic growth in 2019 is expected to remain at around 0.6% for the current financial year.\n\nWhile collections have been weak, State-Owned Enterprises, particularly Eskom (and to lessor but still large extent SAA and SABC) continue to be an increasing draw on South Africa\u2019s fiscus. Mr Mboweni is likely to have to revise the budget deficit estimate of 4.5% (communicated at the last meeting) to around 6% for 2019.\n\nEskom\n\nEskom continues to be a hindrance and a threat to the domestic economy as it draws more and more funds from the country\u2019s fiscus. In February\u2019s budget speech, it was announced that Eskom would receive R69bn in bailout funds over the course of three years. Since the meeting, Treasury has had to allocate an additional R59bn over the course of two years for Eskom to run as a going concern.\n\nEskom was granted the right for tariff increases of 9.4%m 8.1% and 5.2% for 2019/2020, 2020/21 and 2021/2022 periods respectively. However, the ailing power utility had requested 17.1%, 15.4% and 15.5% tariff increase over the next three years to help the State-Owned Enterprise (SOE) address it\u2019s increasing debt obligations.\n\nMr. Tito Mboweni will need to address the Eskom worrisome debt burden and guide towards any further provisioning, provisioning which has nearly doubled in the six months which followed the last address. Furthermore, the president has suggested that the meeting will provide further plans relating\n\nA rating downgrade?\n\nMoody\u2019s Investor relations, the last major rating agency to hold South Africa\u2019s local credit rating at investment grade and is set to update its credit review on South Africa shortly after the MTBPS. Fiscal consolidation remains of the utmost importance and the rating agency will be looking to see efforts towards improving revenue collection whilst containing expenditure. There has also been the suggestion from president Cyril Ramaphosa that the MTBPS will offer further information regarding the turnaround strategy at Eskom (as well as SAA and SABC).\n\nMoody\u2019s has recently reaffirmed South Africa\u2019s local currency credit rating at one notch above sub-investment grade with a stable outlook. Failing any disastrous surprises, it is expected that South Africa debt will remain at investment grade upon review, with a minor chance of a downgrade to the outlook from stable to negative.\n\n\n\nContinue reading", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by Shaun Murison covering: USD/ZAR.
