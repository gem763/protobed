Netflix alone spent nearly $2 billion on advertising last year.\n\nNetflix has been involved in several of these disputes, since the streaming giant is considered the incumbent to beat.\n\nIn May, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings confirmed that Netflix would not be part of Apple's plans to sell subscriptions to other streaming services through Apple TV.\n\nAmazon and Disney are also at odds. On Thursday, The Journal reported that Amazon's Fire TV has not yet struck a deal to carry Disney's streaming service Disney+ because Amazon \"is pushing for the right to sell a percentage of the ad inventory on other Disney apps.\"\n\nYes, but: Tensions between streaming device-makers and programmers are longstanding. Amazon stopped selling the Apple TV set-top box and Google Chromecast dongle in 2017 for a little while amid disputes with both giants. Amazon also pulled YouTube from its touchscreen device for some time that year.\n\nThe big picture: The streaming wars have also caused competitors to rethink their board structures.
