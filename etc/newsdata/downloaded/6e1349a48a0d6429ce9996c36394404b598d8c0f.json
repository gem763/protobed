In March, after an Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max crashed, killing 157 people, the plane was grounded worldwide.\n\nAccording to written testimony, Muilenburg will tell the Senate commerce committee: \u201cWe have learned and are still learning from these accidents, Mr Chairman. We know we made mistakes and got some things wrong.\u201d\n\nMuilenburg\u2019s testimony, made public on Monday, said the company had made improvements to the now-grounded 737 Max airplane \u201cthat will ensure that accidents like these never happen again\u201d. He added: \u201cWe also know we can and must do better.\u201d\n\nMuilenburg, who was stripped of his title as Boeing chairman by the board earlier this month, will also testify before the House of Representatives transportation and infrastructure committee on Wednesday.\n\nThe grounding of the 737 Max has forced US airlines to cancel flights up to January and February and has also affected European carriers such as Ryanair, which cut 30,000 flights and will fly 5 million fewer passengers than planned next year. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is not expected to approve the 737 Max\u2019s use until December at the earliest.\n\nMuilenberg will tell the Senate he has flown on two demonstration flights testing the improvements made to the 737 Max. \u201cWhen the 737 Max returns to service, it will be one of the safest airplanes ever to fly,\u201d he said in his written testimony.\n\nHe conceded getting the plane back in the air \u201chas taken longer than we originally expected, but we\u2019re committed to getting it right, and return-to-service timing is completely dependent on answering each and every question from the FAA\u201d.\n\nHe added \u201cregulators should approve the return of the Max to the skies only after they have applied the most rigorous scrutiny, and are completely satisfied as to the plane\u2019s safety. The flying public deserves nothing less.\u201d\n\nMuilenberg also expressed \u201cdeepest sympathies to the families and loved ones\u201d of those killed. He visited the Indonesian embassy in Washington on Monday to meet with the country\u2019s ambassador, offer condolences and pay respects to those lost on the flight.\n\nLion Air crash report 'criticises design, maintenance and pilot error' Read more\n\nRoger Wicker, the chairman of the Senate commerce committee, told Reuters last week the 737 Max \u201cwon\u2019t fly unless 99.9% of the American public and American policymakers are convinced that it\u2019s absolutely safe\u201d.\n\nIndonesian investigators reported last week that problems with Boeing\u2019s design, the airline\u2019s maintenance of the jet and pilot errors contributed to the Lion Air crash.\n\nMuilenburg noted both crashes involved the repeated activation of a flight control software function known as MCAS after it received faulty sensor input.\n\nn up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\nBoeing\u2019s development of that software has come under criticism from lawmakers and the company is adding safeguards to the system. Muilenburg said the changes would \u201celiminate the possibility of even extremely unlikely risks that are unrelated to the accident\u201d.\n\nBoeing has admitted few mistakes since the two fatal crashes. Earlier this month, the FAA questioned why Boeing withheld instant messages from a former pilot for months that raised questions about MCAS.\n\nRepresentative Peter DeFazio, who chairs the House panel, has one main question for Boeing at Wednesday\u2019s hearing: \u201cHow the hell did this happen?\u201d", "description": "Dennis Muilenburg will appear before Congress on anniversary of first of two crashes", "authors": ["Julia Kollewe"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f66e50b5e568f6f019beae949b0dea8499c61e07/0_64_3682_2209/master/3682.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=65c165d2534c614887f89b4c9325424c", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
