If you watched his nationally televised press conference, Trump\u2019s shrill, eye-popping hissy fit scanned like the end of a long, coke-fueled bender where the itchy, frenzied paranoia is dry-humping the last ragged gasps of the earlier party-powder fun.\n\nBetween calling Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) a panoply of Trumpish insults (and for the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee to be held for treason), engaging in his usual hatred of the press, talking about Mike Pompeo\u2019s intimate undergarments, and quite obviously scaring the shit out of Finnish President Sauli Niinisto\u2014who looked like he was the very unwilling star of an ISIS hostage video\u2014Trump spent the day rapidly decompensating, and it was a hideous spectacle. All the Maximum Leader pronunciamentos won\u2019t change the reality that Donald John Trump, 45th president of the United States, has lost his shit.\n\nIn private, Republicans are in the deepest despair of the Trump era. They\u2019ve got that hang-dog, dick-in-the-dirt fatalism of men destined to die in a meaningless battle in a pointless war. They\u2019ve abandoned all pretense of recapturing the House, their political fortunes in the states are crashing and burning, and the stock market bubble they kept up as a shield against the downsides of Trump\u2014\u201cbut muh 401(k)!\u201d\u2014is popping.", "description": "That press conference was terrifying.
