In his opening poem, \u201cDrunktown\u201d Skeets lays it out plainly: \u201cMen around here only touch when they fuck in a backseat / go for the foul with thirty seconds left / hug their sons after high school graduation / open a keg / stab my uncle forty-seven times behind a liquor store.\u201d (The cover of Eyes Bottle Dark is filled by a beautiful but haunting image that Richard Avedon shot of Skeets\u2019s uncle, who was found murdered in 1979.) By directly confronting a legacy of violence, he refuses to let it impede his journey.\n\nThe experiences and resulting feelings Skeets shares about his time in Gallup can feel disarmingly universal\u2014a young heart attempting to grasp love (\u201cClouds in his throat / six months\u2019 worth. / He bodies into me / half cosmos, half coyote,\u201d Skeets writes in \u201cVirginity\u201d), watching porn in \u201cGasoline Ceremony,\u201d playing with childhood friends, drinking with them as the years pass by, saying goodbye too soon as they keep ticking away in \u201cDear Brother.\u201d But Skeets\u2019s writing is also hyper-specific, forged out of the experience of growing up a gay Din\u00e9 man in a rural community with extractive coal operations at every turn. In a recent interview with Ligeia Magazine, Skeets posed a question that defines his project: \u201cHow do I find beauty in brutality and brutality in beauty?\u201d\n\nFor all its beguiling lyricism, this is a work determined to point out the contrast-filled moments that define Skeets\u2019s life experience, many of them brought on by a colonizing force that sits on the outskirts of the work, lurking always but never explicitly present in body. In \u201cGlory,\u201d Skeets imbues the plainness of police scanner chatter casually profiling a suspect with the beauty of descriptive language: \u201cNative American male. Early twenties. About 6\u20192\u201d, 190 pounds. / Has the evening for a face.\u201d Similarly, the three-poem series \u201cIn The Fields\u201d details how understanding the land and the creatures that inhabit it requires not just perspective, but also space for thought. In the fields are memories of lust giving way to love; also present are the lingering ghosts of relatives and strangers who have long passed on, invisible reminders of the danger that constantly lurks at the periphery.\n\nThe shadowy brand of violence evoked in Eyes Bottle Dark is at once mundane and shocking. \u201cThe Indian Capital of the World\u201d\u2014among the most stylistically jarring of Skeets\u2019s pieces\u2014lays out quote after quote from news coverage, detailing incessant anonymous fatal tragedies. Quoting from an article by Lower Brule Sioux citizen, writer, and leftist organizer Nick Estes, Skeets shows how the media and the police stop seeing the people in the news clippings as people. They are bodies. They are background noise more than interruptions, the mere toll of life in Gallup. To believe these characterizations, Skeet shows, is to believe that the loss of hundreds, if not thousands, of lives is inevitable. Skeets drops the headlines down the page, one after another, clustering closer and closer until they overlap with one another, crushing meaning with their combined weight.\n\nAs Skeets makes clear, there is another assault underway\u2014on the land that the Din\u00e9 have shepherded for generations. In \u201cLet There Be Coal,\u201d Skeets lines up the coal industry, one of Navajo Nation\u2019s most substantial economic drivers. He does so not by calling forth scenes of executives plotting in the boardroom, but by showing what forced financial dependency looks like to people who only know the mines as a means of survival, and to fathers who only know physicality as the expression of masculinity: \u201cA boy busting up coal in Window Rock asks his dad, \u2018When do we leave for / the next one?\u2019 / His dad sits his coffee down to hit the boy. \u2018Coal doesn\u2019t bust itself.\u2019\u201d", "description": "In his new book, a Din\u00e9 poet challenges the perception of a Native community.", "authors": ["Nick Martin"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/c521c16af6baf0bf6f269e60fd94cf8e9c14b804.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
