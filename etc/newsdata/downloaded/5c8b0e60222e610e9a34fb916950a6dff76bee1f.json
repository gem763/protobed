But Metro Pacific will retain control of the business by virtue of voting rights attached to the preferred shares it owns, he added.\n\nA planned IPO for the business, Metro Pacific Hospital Holdings, has been postponed as a result of the deal.\n\nSingapore state fund Temasek and buyout firm CVC had also been in the running to buy into the hospital group, sources familiar with the matter had said previously.\n\n\u201cThe Philippines has a very, very young population and as they grow, the rising disposable income is growing so fast that more and more people in the middle class are demanding private healthcare,\u201d Ashish Shastry, KKR\u2019s co-head of Asia Pacific Private Equity, told Reuters.\n\nHe added that KKR could use its experience in healthcare businesses in China, India and the United States to help the hospital group.\n\nThe funds will enable the unit to hit its new target of expanding to 30 hospitals with 5,000 beds before 2030, Augusto Palisoc, president of the healthcare group, said in a statement. It currently has 14 hospitals and around 3,200 beds.\n\nMetro Pacific, which has interests in power, water and other sectors, is a unit of First Pacific Co Ltd (0142.HK), which is owned by Indonesian tycoon Anthoni Salim.\n\nBank of America Merrill Lynch and UBS were the financial advisors to Metro Pacific and GIC on the deal, which is expected to close by the year-end.", "description": "A KKR-led consortium said it will invest $685 million in the largest hospital group in the Philippines, seeking to capitalize on growing demand for private healthcare in Southeast Asia.", "authors": ["Neil Jerome Morales", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
