The Kamala Harris Show was running late.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019ll be here in just a second,\u201d vowed the official at the microphone, a councilwoman from this city of 27,000 in upstate South Carolina. Warm-up speakers are the norm on a candidate tour like this, though coming in from the 95-degree heat, everyone packed into the Westside Community Center was already warm enough. As we waited for the guest of honor, you could feel our host, Councilwoman Beatrice Thompson, doing her best to vamp.\n\nIn my world, the theater, timing is everything. The last impulse you want to foster in an audience is restlessness. So, to me, the wait from the announcement of \u201cKamala Harris!\u201d \u2014 pronounced correctly as COMMA-la \u2014 through the dozen or so minutes that ticked by before she entered via a side door seemed interminable.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to be with you,\u201d Harris exclaimed at last, bounding onto a platform decked out in American and Palmetto State flags, beaming a thousand-watt smile and seeking to recoup the sympathetic energy of an audience 300 strong by declaring, \u201cI truly intend on winning the election!\u201d\n\nPolitical campaigns are all about seducing audiences. So why shouldn\u2019t someone like me be out here, reviewing the art \u2014 or artlessness \u2014 of the seduction? Presidential contenders do not win merely by trumpeting their achievements and policies. No, their instrument has to resound with some other, ineffable qualities. Although the laws of attraction vary from voter to voter, it seems that we look in the early days of a presidential race for connections, in some of the same ways casting directors use their antennae to winnow down auditioning actors. We want someone who feels right for the part.\n\nSo I had traveled to South Carolina in late spring to follow the senator on a two-day swing through the northern part of the state, to see how her audition played. I was taking the analytical eye I have cultivated in 17 years as The Washington Post\u2019s chief theater critic and applying it to the performance skills of a few Democratic candidates.\n\nI was seeking to evaluate how those running for president strive to be that person \u2014 what aspects of style, humor, oratorical skill, emotional accessibility and physical presence they demonstrate \u2014 for the mission of persuading voters to find them worthy. Actors invest huge amounts in the service of making scripted words sound like their own. Politicians do much the same thing, except the character they seek to project is themselves, or, more to the point, the best parts of themselves.\n\n[Could Pete Buttigieg become the first millennial president?]\n\nChoosing to start with Harris was an easy call. On the television screen, she exudes star power. You could imagine her playing a lawyer on a prestige TV series. On the retail-campaign stump, her natural charm and exuberance are on display, qualities that become even more apparent in more intimate settings, such as a visit, after the Anderson event, to a women\u2019s group in the elegant mini-mansion of a wealthy supporter in Greenville. Telling a story about her own mother\u2019s stock answer to her daughter\u2019s complaints \u2014 \u201cWhat are you going to do about it?\u201d \u2014 Harris warmed the assembled women with her empowering reply: \u201cSo I decided to run for president.\u201d\n\n\n\nPresident Barack Obama has praised Harris for her smarts and her toughness. Harris, alongside Obama and former California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, displays a natural charm and exuberance. (Eric Risberg/AP File)\n\nThe unadorned production Harris takes from venue to venue has at its core a person seeking to project warmth, strength and a common touch. The people who introduce her at her events in South Carolina, where she runs third or fourth in polls at present, are local people, not celebrities, and she rarely fails to mention that her campaign manager is her sister, Maya Harris, a lawyer and political analyst for MSNBC. Her strength is conveyed readily, by her backstory: The essential biographical framework at a Kamala Harris stop is her government experience outside Washington, as onetime district attorney in San Francisco and as California\u2019s attorney general. It seems no accident that she will often invoke the verb \u201cprosecute,\u201d both to convey her intention to pursue her policy goals to fruition and to remind audiences of her \u201cLaw and Order\u201d bona fides. (When was the last time a president was a former prosecutor? It appears you have to go all the way back to William Howard Taft.)\n\nSubtext is everything in drama: What a character says is subordinate to what an audience intuits. With Harris, the visceral impression is of a pleaser \u2014 she is an inveterate dispenser of thank-yous to inquiring voters during Q&As \u2014 whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9 suggests a toughness.\n\n\u201cIt was the way she interrogated Barr,\u201d said Ernest McManus, a Vietnam vet and retired maintenance mechanic, an admirer who had come to hear her in Anderson. He was referring to Harris\u2019s big media moment in May: the grilling to which she subjected Attorney General William P. Barr as he appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee to answer questions about the Mueller report.\n\n\u201cShe showed that leadership quality,\u201d McManus added. \u201cShe can stand up to any man.\u201d\n\nHarris questions attorney general nominee William P. Barr during a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee in Washington in January 2018.

The president gets under Harris\u2019s skin so thoroughly that she can barely bring herself to acknowledge him. During the Harris show, Donald Trump is He Who Must Not Be Named. Not once in two days did I hear her mention it, even though her remarks boil with contempt for his policies: He is always \u201cthat guy in the White House\u201d or \u201cthis commander in chief.\u201d Her crowds feed on this not-so-subliminal disdain.\n\n[How Andrew Yang made a place for himself in the Democratic field]\n\nWhat Harris does with her aura of authority is key to her campaign style, and I would wager that, as she becomes more relaxed at commanding a room, the presentation will become even more powerful. Watching her in a series of formats, which also included a televised hour before a live MSNBC audience in Spartanburg with Lawrence O\u2019Donnell, you got earfuls of the same rhetoric from stop to stop. That is in the nature of retail politics, too. But you also began to see what aspects of laying out her case Harris excels at and where her performance might still be considered a work in progress.\n\nFor one thing, the candidate lapses into long-winded replies to questioners, too frequently couched in Washington buzzwords. \u201cThis is an inflection moment in the history of our country,\u201d she declares often, as eyes in the crowds wander to their smartphones. Harris is more effective when the pitch shifts to everyday vernacular, as when she cites bread-and-butter issues, such as the lack of adequate pay for teachers, and then dismisses objections to righting the wrong by saying: \u201cI\u2019m kind of done with that.\u201d Her audiences giggle delightedly, because the convention stated so casually in this context is unexpected. You could talk to this person, you think, over coffee, or the back fence.\n\n\n\nHarris (D-Calif.), with her husband, Douglas Emhoff, at the Kenter Canyon Elementary School in Los Angeles in 2016, the year she was elected to the U.S. Senate. (Nick Ut/AP)\n\nCarol Smith, a Democrat from nearby Clemson, contemplated Harris\u2019s visceral appeal as she waited with her friend Libba Kellner to hear the candidate in Anderson. \u201cI would love a woman,\u201d she said, \u201cand I would like someone who can beat [Trump]. And I do like youth and energy. But,\u201d she added, \u201cI don\u2019t want someone who\u2019s just \u2018likable.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cLikable\u201d is indeed a loaded term, especially if you recall how often it was weaponized against Hillary Clinton in 2016. Still, candidates seek in myriad ways to get you to like them. When children are called on in the Q&A portions of Harris\u2019s appearances, she will shower them with praise for their courage to speak up. (It can come across as patronizing.) In her best moments of audience interaction, she moves to the lip of the stage and stares intently at questioners, letting them finish their inquiries before responding.\n\n[Are Amy and Beto O\u2019Rourke the future of politics?]\n\nBut navigating personality politics is not Harris\u2019s forte, as she noted in her 2018 agenda-setting memoir, \u201cThe Truths We Hold.\u201d \u201cThis process didn\u2019t come naturally to me,\u201d she wrote of her California campaigns. \u201cI was always more than happy to talk about the work to be done. But voters wanted to hear about more than just policy. They wanted to know about me personally \u2014 who I was, what my life had been, the experiences that had shaped me.\n\n\u201c . . . But I\u2019d been raised not to talk about myself. I\u2019d been raised with the belief that there was something narcissistic about doing so. Something vain.\u201d\n\nAt a Harris event, you find yourself mentally willing her to include more applause lines, like the unequivocal declaration that gets her best response in South Carolina: \u201cOn Day One, we\u2019re going to repeal that tax bill!\u201d In these moments, she looks comfortable alone on the stage \u2014 more at home, in fact, than she had when she appeared at the town hall on O\u2019Donnell\u2019s MSNBC show, \u201cThe Last Word,\u201d from the campus of Wofford College in Spartanburg. Though the questioning was friendly, Harris seemed a bit too aware of the cameras: Her overuse of hand gestures, to embroider her responses, felt unnatural. Hamlet refers to it, when instructing the Players, as \u201csawing the air.\u201d Harris might consider laying aside the saw.\n\n\n\nWhen Harris, with Lawrence O'Donnell of MSNBC, laughs, it allows audiences to see her beyond her role as a prosecutor. (Liz Nemeth/MSNBC/NBCUPhotoBank via Getty Images)\n\nOne of her more endearing oratorical habits is she can\u2019t get out a laugh line before laughing herself, even in the retelling of the same humorous anecdote at every stop. Is it nerves or a fear the audience will not find it funny? In any case, Harris\u2019s reflexive laughter is humanizing; it pierces the prosecutor\u2019s armor, makes her seem a bit more like the rest of us.\n\n[Amy Klobuchar\u2019s complicated political inheritance]\n\nAt the end of her South Carolina swing, in Greenville\u2019s West End Community Development Center, 500 prospective voters patiently waited for Harris to appear. When she did so \u2014 30 minutes past the starting time of the event \u2014 she still managed to look fresh, businesslike in a no-nonsense pantsuit. The size of the crowd seemed to invigorate her, although interestingly, the script the campaign sought to follow held little interest for the spectators. Billed as a forum to talk about education issues, the event only barely touched on school concerns.\n\n\u201cWill you take care of Lindsey Graham and send him out?\u201d an audience member blurted out at one point. Another woman wanted to know how the local protests against the administration in which she participated could have more impact.\n\n\u201cI want to thank you for your activism,\u201d Harris responded. \u201cI know it\u2019s not easy for you.\u201d\n\nWas the former prosecutor failing to take full advantage of the anger in the room? Or was this calming persona calculated to make the best long-term use of it? It remains to be seen whether voters will decide to make the qualities Harris is seeking to project \u2014 dogged and at the same time empathic \u2014 those of a recurring character.\n\n\n\n\"I was always more than happy to talk about the work to be done. But voters wanted to hear about more than just policy,\" Harris said in her memoir. \"They wanted to know about me personally \u2014 who I was, what my life had been, the experiences that had shaped me.\" (Liz Nemeth/MSNBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images)\n\nStory by Peter Marks.
