It was loud enough already, but somehow the sound reached another level. From 2-0 down, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid had come back to draw 2-2 with Juventus, Diego Simeone screaming down on the touchline, supporters shouting all around him. It had been quite a way to start the European season \u2013 and it was almost taken from them, too, when Cristiano Ronaldo flashed a shot just wide deep into injury time.\n\nOne hundred and 10 days later, the Champions League returned to the Metropolitano. Only one player remained from the night that Liverpool won their sixth European Cup here and the early signs were that Trippier might enjoy this night rather more than that one. Yes, he had Cristiano Ronaldo in front of him, but \u2026 well, that wasn\u2019t entirely true: most of the time he had Ronaldo behind him. For all the cliches about Atl\u00e9tico, Trippier\u2019s duties at his new club are far from solely defensive. Diego Simeone\u2019s full-backs are pushed very high and very wide, sought out early and often.\n\n\u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda double helps PSG ease to win against Real Madrid Read more\n\nWithin five minutes, there had been four crosses already \u2013 two from Trippier, two from Renan Lodi on the other side \u2013 and that pattern continued. While Lodi ran at Juventus, Trippier tended to sneak in behind Alex Sandro, an eye always on the passing line that could reach him.\n\nTogether, they saw a lot of the ball as Atl\u00e9tico carried the weight of the game, Thomas Partey leading them out from deep, Diego Costa running, and Koke providing that moment of pause in possession that made sense of it all.\n\nTwice Jos\u00e9 Gim\u00e9nez leapt for headers and a cross that the Englishman stood up found Jo\u00e3o Felix close in by the far post, only for Wojciech Szczesny to save.\n\nIn truth, though, that was a simple enough stop and there were few real chances. A Ronaldo shot bounced a little awkwardly but didn\u2019t concern Jan Oblak, Gim\u00e9nez headed away Miralem Pjanic\u2019s effort, and Blaise Matuidi scuffed his shot horribly, laughed at by thousands.\n\nThe one genuine save of the first half came from Szczesny, when Jo\u00e3o Felix started a superb run 20 yards inside his own half. At one point he had five opponents around him in a circle but he turned, slowed, started again, and progressed into the area, working just enough space to release a shot with his toe. The former Arsenal keeper was down sharply to his left. From the corner, Gim\u00e9nez\u2019s header came close.\n\nIlkay G\u00fcndogan lights up Manchester City\u2019s easy win over Shakhtar Donetsk Read more\n\nAnd then a goal came, just two minutes into the second half. Trippier slotted the ball into Costa but he lost out and there, from just outside his own area, Leonardo Bonucci bent a long, long pass up the left with the outside of his boot. Suddenly, Gonzalo Higua\u00edn was racing away. Ronaldo was running through the middle to join him. And Juan Cuadrado was heading up the right. As Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s players dashed back, Higua\u00edn slowed, and played it behind the returning reinforcements to the Colombian, who cut back and struck a superb left-footed shot, bending into the top corner past the striped shirts.\n\nDanilo wasted the chance to make it two, his shot harmless when a pass to Ronaldo, alone at the far post, might have been deadly. Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s next move should have been, and they paid for it almost immediately. A wonderful exchange between Koke, Stefan Savic and Trippier worked the game\u2019s clearest opportunity for Gim\u00e9nez, via five, sharp first-time passes, but he was forced to reach back a little for the ball and the shot from close range flew over the crossbar.\n\nThere was only time for the referee to go down, hit in the face by a wild Sami Khedira hack, before Cuadrado and Ronaldo sent Sandro away. His cross was perfect, an invitation that Matuidi accepted, heading past Oblak. Hope returned fast, Savic heading in from Koke\u2019s free-kick to set up the finale and turn the noise up loud.", "description": "Atl\u00e9tico Madrid were 2-0 down against Juventus but Stefan Savic scored and then H\u00e9ctor Herrera completed the comeback in the last minute to make it 2-2", "authors": ["Sid Lowe"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3867f9fc8348e63baddfdb12aa117eb984f9cc60/0_131_2269_1361/master/2269.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=15e7d02c42176387ccf2949e7d56e8ab", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
