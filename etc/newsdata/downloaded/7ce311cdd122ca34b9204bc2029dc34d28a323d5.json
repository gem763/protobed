The fishermen then push dowel-like wooden corks into the wounds to prevent their blood from spilling into the cove,\u201d the Dolphin Project describes on its website.\n\nThe 2019/2020 hunting season in Taiji will aim to kill 1,749 of the cetaceans, including 6 species of dolphin and 3 species of whale.\n\nJapan notified the U.S. on Dec. 26, 2018, that it had decided to withdraw from the International Whaling Commission in order to pursue commercial whaling. Their decision went into effect on June 29 of this year, according to a memorandum from the Embassy of Japan.\n\nThe official reason Japan has given for the annual hunt is to use the dolphins for meat, but Dolphin Project says there are other reasons as well.\n\n\u201cFrom the fishermen\u2019s perspective, the dolphins eat too much fish, and the fishermen are simply killing the competition\u2026It is about eradicating as many dolphins as possible in order to make the oceans\u2019 fish available to themselves.\u201d\n\nThe Japanese embassy did not immediately reply for ABC News' request for comment.", "description": "Dolphin hunting season has commenced in the small village of Taiji, Japan, with a quota to kill more than 1,400 dolphins and 300 whales.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/dolphin-nc-er-190902_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
