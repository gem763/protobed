A Koinex request demands the RBI force its banking partner to unfreeze its account.\n\nPerhaps the most curious aspect of the situation is that the RBI has reportedly now denied locking Koinex\u2019 account while claiming it hadn\u2019t directed the firm\u2019s bank to do so, either.\n\nThese denials come despite confirmation from a cyberpolice senior inspector that the seized funds were unable to be accessed due to a frozen bank account.\n\nSo, while India\u2019s lawmakers have repeatedly taken steps to ban cryptocurrency under the guise of protecting citizens from poor investments, it\u2019s likely this sticky situation is deliciously ironic to Bitcoin fans \u2014 and rightly so.", "description": "India's central bank has denied locking the account, despite a senior police inspector confirming funds converted from Bitcoin are frozen.", "authors": ["David Canellis", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/hardfork?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2018%2F10%2Fblockchain-committee-india-2-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-regulation.jpg&signature=6d0a0ff213b2a5160e35f22384042bf3", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
