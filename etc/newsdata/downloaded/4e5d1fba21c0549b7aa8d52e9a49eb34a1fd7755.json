Before the opening of Hong Kong International Airport on Lantau Island, the city\u2019s Kai Tak airport was right next to Kowloon City. As the rent in that area was cheaper than in commercial hubs like Causeway Bay, Tsim Sha Tsui or Mong Kok, many Thai businesses settled there.\n\n5 Thai restaurants in HK's Kowloon City you should try for an authentic taste of Thailand\n\nDuring the 1970s and 80s, some Hongkongers, especially those who lived in the infamous Kowloon Walled City (now Kowloon Walled City Park), married women who had migrated here from Thailand. It\u2019s not surprising that many of these migrants, unfamiliar with Hong Kong, made a living by using the skills that were unique to them \u2013 cooking traditional Thai food.\n\nIn fact, the founder of one of the best known Thai restaurants in Hong Kong, Wong Chun Chun Thai, was also a Thai bride.\n\nAs Kowloon City\u2019s reputation for having tasty, authentic Thai food grew, more restaurants opened in the area serving the cuisine. There are now dozens to choose from, but here are five that are simply too good to miss.\n\nFrom Thai to pizza: 5 places to eat for HK$50 in Causeway Bay\n\nHot Basil\n\nThis restaurant has the best lunch menus you can find anywhere in the city. Lunch includes a main course, drink, and a dessert \u2013 all for less than HK$50! The dishes are also very filling. The spicy minced pork rice looks amazing and tastes incredible, and I\u2019d love to know how the chef makes it.\n\nCheong Fat Thai Noodle House\n\nCheong Fat Thai Noodle House is well-known for its boat noodles, a traditional dish that dates back to the days when people who worked on boats would sell small portions of noodles together with a strongly flavoured home-made soup. This street food staple usually contains pork, beef, meatballs \u2013 and pig\u2019s liver. Try it \u2013 you won\u2019t regret it.\n\nThai boat noodles are a traditional dish and a street food staple.

The Thai curry is not too spicy and is mixed with coconut milk for a lovely creamy taste. No matter what you eat the curry with \u2013 rice or Thai roti bread \u2013 it\u2019s delicious. You might even be tempted to go home with a takeaway box for later!\n\nSiamsiri Thai Food\n\nThis eatery offers some of the best Thai-style meat dishes in Kowloon City. From roast pork neck to seafood, the dishes are always bursting with flavour. The roast pork is just right \u2013 soft and tender \u2013 while the beef dishes are packed with flavour. The seafood dishes come with a variety of sauces and seasonings, and best of all, you get to choose the spice level \u2013 how much heat can you handle?\n\nWhat should school canteens sell? Students name what they want to see on the menu\n\nNam Wan Shop\n\nWhat sets this place apart from the others on this list is the fact that it\u2019s takeaway only. Go ahead and order the satay: it is grilled on the spot. And even though everything is made absolutely fresh, you can pick up your order within 10 minutes, while it\u2019s still piping hot and delicious. I also really like the grilled pork neck, which comes paired with a Thai sweet and sour sauce \u2013 it\u2019s a winner!\n\nEdited by Ingrid Piper", "description": "Kowloon City is famous for its huge range of restaurants serving this Southeast Asia cuisine, so we narrowed down the best choices for you", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/c409caf0-f496-11e9-87ad-fce8e65242a6imagehires181938.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
