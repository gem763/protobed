To avoid the preppy aesthetic, we recommend avoiding anything too bulky or bland, but at the same time choosing the colour carefully to complement the rest of your wardrobe.\n\nPracticality is another issue. Ideally your backpack should be as useful for a busy work day as it is a quick trip to the shops or a long walk. For that reason, it also needs to protect your belongings from the elements, as well as protecting your back and posture.\n\nWith this in mind, we tried backpacks small and large, minimalist and bold, expensive and thrifty, to find the best available right now. We put both the bags and our backs through their paces, only including those that didn\u2019t leave us aching after use.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

Thankfully they live up to their reputation. The no.2 edition of the backpack is surprisingly roomy and feels extremely sturdy, making it perfect for everything from work to a night away. It also comes with two side pockets and one on the front, large enough to easily stash away your phone, purse and keys, and thanks to the double-wax finish you can feel safe in knowing that your valuables are protected from the worst weather. It doesn\u2019t hurt that it goes with everything.\n\nBuy now\n\nDr. Martens mini leather backpack: \u00a3109, Dr. Martens\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for something sleek and understated, this is the backpack for you. Made from Dr. Martens\u2019 trademark durable 100 per cent leather, it fastens with a buckle at the front and adjusts at the straps. Versatile and secure, it might not fit in all the essentials for a school or work day, but still feels surprisingly roomy. Perfect for days out.\n\nBuy now\n\nTopshop blaze mustard backpack: \u00a320, Topshop\n\nWe\u2019re a big fan of Topshop\u2019s accessories, which reach the perfect balance of quality and price. This mustard faux croc-leather backpack is bold and on trend, but not the most practical entry on the list (we couldn\u2019t fit in our laptop and it doesn\u2019t feel sturdy enough to weigh down for a long day at the office). Nevertheless, it makes the perfect autumnal addition to your wardrobe, and kept our tester\u2019s belongings safe and dry in a misjudged day out in constant rain.\n\nBuy now\n\nHype black splatter explorer backpack: \u00a334.99, Hype\n\nThis backpack reminded us of our favourite school bag in the best possible way. It was one of the comfiest on the list, with padding in the straps and back of the bag. Despite having such a high capacity (it can contain up to 18 litres), it never felt painful or like the bag was in danger of ripping. It\u2019s surprisingly budget friendly for such a high quality bag and while Hype offers a range of designs from minimalist to OTT, our tester\u2019s favourite was the black splatter pattern, which complements most outfits without standing out too much.\n\nBuy now\n\nLifeventure kibo 25 RFiD travel backpack: \u00a339.99, Lifeventure\n\nLifeventure has combined its 25 years of travel experience with the latest technology to create the perfect travel backpack. The brand\u2019s \u201cruco-dry eco plus hydrophobic treatment\u201d means it\u2019s totally waterproof, it offers two bottle pockets and a padded 13\u201d laptop section, and \u2013 most impressively \u2013 there\u2019s a hidden radio-frequency identification (RFiD) protected pocket, blocking any personal information such as credit cards or identification from being picked up by airport RFID readers. Deceptively big, it also holds up to 25 litres of your belongings. At such a low price for all its unique features, it\u2019s a must-have for any frequent flyers.\n\nBuy now\n\nHunter original nylon backpack: \u00a355, Hunter\n\nJust like its famous wellies, Hunter\u2019s backpacks are designed to last you for years to come. While it\u2019s coated in water-resistant nylon to protect your belongings from light rain, it also features a padded mesh back panel to avoid the dreaded sweaty back situation. Available in a range of shades, our tester loved the military red option, which adds a pop of colour to dark autumn wardrobes.\n\nBuy now\n\nMuji water repellent mini rucksack: \u00a319.95, Muji\n\nSmall backpacks are a wardrobe must-have, especially when they\u2019re as practical as this one. It\u2019s coated in a water-repellent polyester, holding up well in the bad weather. The front pocket is easy to access and big enough to hold your phone and, depending on the size, your purse. While it comes in three shades, we liked the light beige \u2013 it even stays surprisingly clean thanks to the waterproof coating.\n\nBuy now\n\nEastpak padded pak'r: \u00a338.50, Eastpak\n\nBackpacks are Eastpak\u2019s speciality but our tester\u2019s favourite was the brand\u2019s classic, the padded pak\u2019r. The main compartment is roomy, with a handy 13\u201d pocket for your laptop and a bigger than average front pocket. It feels comfortable and sturdy on your back and also comes with a two year warranty. An added bonus is that it\u2019s 100 per cent vegan.\n\nBuy now\n\nHerschel Supply retreat backpack: \u00a380, Herschel Supply Co\n\nPractical yet cute, this backpack fits in even the bulkiest of items. The laptop sleeve is larger than found in most backpacks, measuring at 15 inches, and is fleece-lined to ensure the safety of your device. It also feels very secure, with both a drawcord cinch closure and two buckle straps. However, our favourite feature was the internal media pocket, which fixes your headphones into place to make it easier to safely listen to your music while out and about.\n\nBuy now\n\nMi-Pac nylon day pack leopard: \u00a329.99, Mi-Pac\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to stand out with your backpack, Mi-Pac has you sorted. We were immediately drawn to this bag\u2019s leopard print fastening, but were soon drawn in by its other features. It\u2019s fully lined with slick nylon, meaning no leaks throughout the day. The double zip-and-clip fastening is secure, and the logo badge is reflective for added safety during the dark winter months.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Backpacks for women\n\nOur favourite was the kanken no.2 \u2013 Fjallraven\u2019s backpacks are classics for a reason. However, if you\u2019re looking for something a bit more purse-friendly, we loved Mi-Pac\u2019s nylon day pack, and the kibo 25 RFiD travel backpack is unbeatable for frequent travellers.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
