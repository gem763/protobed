Aides have considered having the whistleblower testify from a separate location via a video hookup in which the camera would obscure the whistleblower\u2019s image and alter his voice, possibly with modification technology. They also are talking about having the whistleblower sit behind a screen or partition. A third option being floated includes audio-only testimony.\n\nOne congressional official told the newspaper that House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) does \u201cnot want to burn his identity.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are lots of different protocols and procedures we\u2019re looking into to find out what works and doesn\u2019t work to protect the identity of the whistleblower,\u201d said another Post source. \u201cThat is paramount.\u201d\n\nThough House Intel Democrats are considering unprecedented measures to conceal the so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u2019s\u201d identity, the Senate Intelligence Committee, overseen by Sens. Richard Burr (R-NC) and Mark R. Warner (D-VA), are not mulling similar measures.\n\nThe Post continues:\n\nThe off-campus meetings probably will be in a secure room provided by the executive branch, according to one of these individuals. The meetings could take place \u201cwithin the next couple of weeks,\u201d but no date has been set, one official said.\n\nThe report comes as House Democrats move expeditiously with their formal impeachment inquiry against the president for suggesting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky look into allegations of corruption against former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.\n\nBoth Trump and Zelensky have denied the allegations and the White House, in a nod to transparency, released a transcript of the foreign leaders\u2019 call to demonstrate no wrongdoing occurred.", "description": "House Democrats are reportedly considering masking the identity of a partisan CIA officer behind a \"whistleblower\" complaint from Republicans.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/whistleblower-placeholder-Getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
