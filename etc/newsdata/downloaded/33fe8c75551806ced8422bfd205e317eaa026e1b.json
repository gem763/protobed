Add Interest\n\n\u201cI think the president knows the argument that can be made against him, and he\u2019s scared,\u201d Pelosi, D-Calif., told ABC News Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos in an interview in her ceremonial office in the U.S. Capitol to be broadcast Thursday morning on \"Good Morning America.\"\n\n\u201cAnd so he\u2019s trying to divert attention from that to where [he\u2019s] standing in the way of legislation,\u201d she said.\n\nABC News\n\nShortly before Pelosi sat for the interview with Stephanopoulos, the president dismissed the inquiry with an expletive and tweeted advice to Democrats to choose \u201ca better candidate\u201d than Hillary Clinton in 2020.\n\n\"The Do Nothing Democrats should be focused on building up our Country, not wasting everyone\u2019s time and energy on [B***S***], which is what they have been doing ever since I got overwhelmingly elected in 2016, 223-306,\" Trump tweeted, referring to the electoral vote. \"Get a better candidate this time, you\u2019ll need it!\"\n\n\u201cYou say he\u2019s scared \u2026 Did you hear the fear in his voice when you spoke with him on the phone last week?\u201d Stephanopoulos asked about a Sept. 24 conversation Pelosi had with Trump hours before she launched the formal impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cI saw the surprise in his voice that he didn\u2019t understand that I thought what he did was wrong,\u201d Pelosi said, referring to Trump's call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. \u201cThat he was undermining our national security, that he was undermining our Constitution by his actions and he was undermining the integrity of our elections. He just didn\u2019t see it.\u201d\n\nTrump also dismissed Pelosi\u2019s challenge to work toward bipartisan agreement to lower prescription drug costs and overhaul a trade agreement with Mexico and Canada \u2013 despite the Democrats\u2019 newly launched impeachment inquiry.\n\nNancy Pelosi just said that she is interested in lowering prescription drug prices & working on the desperately needed USMCA. She is incapable of working on either. It is just camouflage for trying to win an election through impeachment. The Do Nothing Democrats are stuck in mud! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 2, 2019\n\nABC News\n\n\u201cBut now he\u2019s calling you the \u2018Do Nothing Democrats,\u2019 says you can\u2019t do it?\u201d Stephanopoulos asked.\n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t we do it? It\u2019s up to him,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cThat was our pledge during the campaign, \u2018For the People,\u2019 we would lower the cost of prescription drugs. I think that the president wants to do that. So, I hope that he would cooperate. He does want the U.S., Mexico, Canada free trade agreement. So do we -- when we have assurances that there will be enforceability for America\u2019s workers and America\u2019s farmers. And we\u2019re close. We\u2019re on a path to yes,\u201d she said.\n\nMore from the exclusive interview will be broadcast on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" on Thursday.", "description": "Speaker Nancy Pelosi tells ABC News' George Stephanopoulos that President Donald Trump is \u201cscared\u201d of the impeachment inquiry amid whistleblower complaint.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/pelosi-01-abc-jt-191002_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
