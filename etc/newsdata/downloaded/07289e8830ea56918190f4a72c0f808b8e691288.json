It was surrounded in the end by friends, MSNBC hosts. It\u2019s in a better place now \u2015 a Park Slope gym.\u201d\n\nThe NY Post with the brutal front page. pic.twitter.com/ZOHm3APMhh \u2014 Maury Brown (@BizballMaury) September 21, 2019\n\nAnnouncing his dropout, the mayor conceded, \u201cIt\u2019s clearly not my time.\u201d He said he would return his full focus to his mayoral duties (he was elected to a second four-year term in November 2017).\n\nThe Post offered a sardonic overview of his longshot White House campaign, which began in May.\n\n\u201cWhether it was in the empty churches of South Carolina, the sun-kissed empty deserts of Nevada or begging someone, anyone, to talk to de Blasio at the Iowa State Fair, the campaign always gave 100% \u2015 and always polled at 1%,\u201d the paper said. \u201d\u2018Can\u2019t\u2019 was never part of its vocabulary. Neither was \u2018won\u2019t,\u2019 \u2018please stop,\u2019 or \u2018this is a dumb idea.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn a CNN poll released last month, de Blasio had actually polled below 1%, being buried by more than a dozen other hopefuls in a field that consistently has been led by former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nAsked about what the polls have shown in a CNN interview just before he exited the race, de Blasio downplayed their significance and gauged the nomination race as still up in the air.\n\nHe said has not seen \u201ca sense among Democratic voters that they are secure in where they want to go.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe vast majority of Democratic voters are going to make their decision late.\u201d\n\nRelated...\n\nBill de Blasio Says Bernie Sanders Would Have Beat Trump In 2016\n\nBill De Blasio Heckled By Protester During CNN Town Hall Over Eric Garner Case\n\nBill De Blasio Drops Out Of Presidential Race\n\nLove HuffPost?
