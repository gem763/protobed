So we can see where he is coming from,\" Bolsonaro said.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRADE TENSIONS\n\nFernandez, a trade protectionist, has vowed to reconsider his country's membership in Mercosur. Bolsonaro, in turn, has said Argentina should be left out of Mercosur if it blocks trade liberalization proposed by Brazil.\n\nOn Monday, Bolsonaro said his government would wait to see what position Fernandez takes once he assumes the presidency in December.\n\n\"Let's see how he behaves,\" Bolsonaro said, adding: \"I hope Argentina does not change its course on trade.\"\n\nForeign policy and trade experts say the two economies are too interdependent to entirely break up Mercosur.\n\nThe greater threat may be to a trade deal between Mercosur and the European Union, which has taken two decades to negotiate and faces resistance in European countries.\n\n\"The relationship between Argentina and Brazil will, at best, be cold for the next three years,\" said Welber Barral, a Brasilia-based consultant and former trade secretary.\n\nHe said, however, that industrial groups on both sides will try to \"appease\" the governments in an effort to insulate their exports and the EU-Mercosur agreement.\n\nFernandez has said he wants to renegotiate parts of the EU agreement that do not suit Argentina, which could delay its ratification with lengthy new rounds of talks.\n\nBrazil is heading in the other direction and wants to reduce Mercosur's common external tariff and allow its members to negotiate new trade deals.\n\nIn the past, Brazil and Argentina's differences could be resolved because they saw eye-to-eye ideologically, but now Brasilia plans to negotiate more aggressively within Mercosur, government officials told Reuters, on condition of anonymity.\n\nBrazil has no plan to abandon the trade bloc at present due to the Peronist return to power in Argentina, but that option has not been totally discarded, they said.\n\nMaking matters less predictable, one member of the diplomatic community noted that Brazil's Foreign Ministry, which has traditionally avoided ideological battles, is now run by a diplomat who cast the result of the Argentine election in apocalyptic terms.\n\n\"The forces of evil are celebrating. The forces of democracy are lamenting for Argentina, Mercosur and all of South America,\" Brazil's Foreign Minister Ernesto Araujo wrote on Twitter.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Anthony Boadle and Lisandra Paraguassu; Editing by Brad Haynes, Alistair Bell and David Gregorio)", "description": "The election of leftist Alberto Fernandez in Argentina, who Brazil's right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro has called a \"red bandit,\" sets the stage for a run-in between South America's two biggest economies that could derail their Mercosur trade bloc.
