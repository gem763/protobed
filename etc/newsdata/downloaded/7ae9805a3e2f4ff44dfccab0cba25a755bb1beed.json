This compares with the annual US fee of $119.\n\nThe service was introduced yesterday (10) with unlimited nationwide free shipping with maximum 48-hour delivery time in over 90 Brazilian municipalities and a catalog of over 500,000 products.\n\nOther features of Brazil's version of the Prime subscription include gaming platform Twitch as well as the video and music streaming products. E-books and magazines from local publishers are also part of the bundle.\n\nThe launch is seen as the biggest move of the US giant since it arrived in Brazil in 2012, where it started with the sale of books and gradually expanded the scope of the platform to include electronics, clothing and sporting goods.\n\nEarlier this year, the company also started to take its first steps towards evolving its artificial intelligence-enabled voice assistant Alexa in Brazil.", "description": "The online giant continues to expand its operation in the country with the paid subscription service, launched at a fraction of the fees charged in the US.", "authors": ["Angelica Mari"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/06/06/050a2d6b-1465-41aa-9f77-46885d85b6e0/thumbnail/770x578/2450e6e74d09be3e71639fbbc2355d74/jamesmartincnet.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
