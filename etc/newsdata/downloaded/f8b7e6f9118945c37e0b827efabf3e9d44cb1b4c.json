Finalizing the last stage before its grand opening, Buyaladdin has received its operating license in the United States. This was part of the operation as we continue to conduct our beta tests. The team of developers had completed Buyaladdin\u2019s alpha tests at the end of August and have ongoing beta tests of the application through the whole month of September.\n\nBuyaladdin integrated more than 50 major retailers worldwide to offer customers an extensive variety of high-quality products. Some of these shopping malls include Amazon, eBay, Rakuten, Coupang, and Lazada. Buyaladdin will also be able to support a variety of cryptocurrencies on its payment system including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and ABBC Coin.\n\nAnother unique feature of Buyaladdin is the customers\u2019 ability to send user recommendations based on their location. This would assure that users will be updated on the most popular items in their region. Users can also save items for future purchases in their \u2018wishlist\u2019 and complete an instant membership in any retailers through the \u2018quick join\u2019 in-app feature.\n\nBuyaladdin is set to start off with around 100 million users, and that number is predicted to balloon in no time. The project will grow by accumulating more crypto-asset holders and targeting the billions of people who cannot access or benefit from the existing financial system. Using the Buyaladdin platform doesn\u2019t require you to have a bank account; all you would need is a crypto wallet. More developments within the project are expected to take place in the future as ABBC continues with its plan of revolutionizing the e-commerce sector.\n\nAside from the crypto payment system, Buyaladdin also has an in-app mileage feature. Users who will purchase items on the app through fiat payment methods can gain mileage points which they can redeem for various in-app perks. This fiat mileage feature makes Buyaladdin suitable for all types of customers: both crypto and non-crypto shoppers globally.\n\nOnce all preparations are completed and the beta testing concluded, the Buyaladdin platform will be available to the public in November 2019. Users will then be able to make online purchases among famous shopping malls all around the world through Buyaladdin. Users will have the exclusive privilege of purchasing their products using cryptocurrency. This is the latest edition of ABBC\u2019s plan to reshape and revolutionize the e-commerce industry by trailblazing the idea of cryptocurrency being integrated into its payment system\n\nThe ABBC team, together with its global partners and well-experienced developers, have worked tirelessly to develop this platform that will connect the world of cryptocurrency and e-commerce. All supporters and followers are appreciated for continuous support as ABBC aims to deliver ambitious projects.\n\nKeep an eye out for additional shopping features and shopping mall options that will be integrated into the Buyaladdin platform.", "description": "Long since the live demonstration of Buyaladdin in New York on July 16, 2019, there has been massive media coverage and buildup surrounding the new crypto shopp...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy9hMzE3ZDFmYTk2OWM4NjZhZWRjMmVmNjI5OTk0MDg0Zi5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
