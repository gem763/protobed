On the complex\u2019s security books, however, the man allegedly was logged as a visitor to Bolsonaro.\n\nAD\n\nFollowing the report, the right-wing president \u2014 who has previously denied any involvement in Franco\u2019s killing \u2014 erupted in a livestream on Facebook. Amid more than 20 minutes of freewheeling attacks against the \u201cfoul, low-life, immoral media,\u201d he denied any wrongdoing and accused the press and rival politicians of trying to undermine his government.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI had no reason to kill anyone in Rio de Janeiro,\u201d he said, filming the video at 4 a.m. in the Middle East, where he has spent this week on a diplomatic trip. \u201cThis will not stick.\u201d\n\nWith his voice breaking at times, Bolsonaro threatened to take away the broadcasting license for Globo, the media organization that first reported the alleged ties between him and the men charged with murdering Franco.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t lose it,\" he said on the livestream, at one point a tear trickling down his cheek. \u201cI\u2019m the president of the republic.\u201d\n\nQuestions had already circulated about connections between the president and the two men charged with Franco\u2019s murder: Ronnie Lessa, 48, a retired officer who allegedly fired the bullets that killed Franco, and \u00c9lcio Vieira de Queiroz, 46, who had allegedly driven Lessa to the scene of the murder.\n\nAD\n\nBefore Bolsonaro\u2019s election in 2018, the president and Lessa both lived in the same upscale condominium in Rio de Janeiro. Their children had once dated, according to police reports. In March, scandal erupted when a photo of de Queiroz and Bolsonaro emerged on social media, showing the two men in a friendly embrace.\n\nAD\n\nBolsonaro had denied knowing both men personally, and police had previously discarded connections between the president and the suspects. But Tuesday night\u2019s reports dragged Bolsonaro yet again into the infamous killing.\n\nA doorman at Bolsonaro\u2019s gated community told Jornal Nacional, a well-respected TV news program, that on March 14, 2018 \u2014 the day of Franco\u2019s murder \u2014 de Queiroz identified himself as a visitor to Bolsonaro\u2019s residence. When the doorman called that house to confirm, a man he had identified as \u201cMr. Jair\u201d said to allow the visitor through.\n\nAD\n\nThe doorman kept watching de Quieroz\u2019s car on security cameras and saw that the vehicle was heading to Lessa\u2019s home inside the complex instead. So he called the apartment back. Yet \u201cMr. Jair\u201d said that he knew where de Quieroz was going, and to let him continue, the TV news program reported.\n\nAD\n\nBolsonaro was in the country\u2019s capital of Brasilia that day for two plenary votes, the report said. Prosecutors say they are searching for audio recordings of those phone calls to identify who the doorman talked to that day \u2014 and who was in Bolsonaro\u2019s home.\n\nLater that evening, as Franco was in a car heading home, two other vehicles pulled up to hers. Someone began firing at the councilwoman, who died almost instantly. Nine police-issue bullets lodged into her body.\n\nFranco, who was 38, had been elected in 2016 as the only black woman on Rio de Janeiro\u2019s 51-person city council. A left-wing lesbian activist and champion for the rights of Afro-Brazilians, she emerged as a powerful critic of Brazil\u2019s security forces \u2014 and a voice for the civilians who had been killed in a crackdown on poor neighborhoods, much like the one she was raised in.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFollowing her death, her name became a worldwide symbol of the fight against racial oppression. Crowds around the globe protested her murder with the chant, \u201cMarielle Presente\u201d: Marielle is Here.\n\nAll the while, Bolsonaro remained nearly silent on the matter as he ascended to the presidency, taking office in January after a campaign that polarized the South American country. And his critics noticed.\n\n\u201cThe execution of Marielle, and the election of the current president, revealed to the world that we are racist, that we are sexist, misogynist, LGBT-phobic,\u201d Franco\u2019s surviving partner, M\u00f4nica Ben\u00edcio, told the New York Times earlier this year.\n\nBrazilian officials took nearly a year to unravel the case, finally charging the two alleged hit men in March. But further details \u2014 namely, who ordered the murder and why \u2014 remained unanswered.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn his video early on Wednesday morning, Bolsonaro also pointed fingers at the Wilson Witzel, the governor of Rio de Janeiro state, accusing him of leaking details of an investigation by Rio\u2019s police.\n\nWitzel denied those charges outright. \u201cI\u2019m being unfairly attacked,\u201d he said in an emailed statement to Bloomberg News. \u201cYet I\u2019ll continue to seek balance and common sense in personal and institutional relations.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s lawyer, Fredrick Wassef, also appeared on TV to deny the new claims about Bolsonaro.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lie, a typo, something,\u201d Wassef said. \u201cI say with absolute certainty and challenge anyone to prove otherwise. It is a lie, a fraud, a scam, to attack the president of the republic.\"\n\nAD", "description": "The Brazilian president responded in outrage to the accusations, speaking live on social media from the middle of the night in the Middle East.", "authors": ["Teo Armus", "Reporter On The Morning Mix Team"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/lluEfOtjQhvGlm3ksYRIuGQF8vQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XSUSHPHW4YI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
