Nir Hauser, the chief technology officer at VineSight, which uses artificial intelligence to track misinformation, said the original tweet received an initial boost from accounts that behaved like bots, a type of software that can be set up to push messages on social media.\n\nAfter briefly suspending the instigating account, which operates under the handle @suemo54 and the name \u201cSue Moore,\u201d Twitter said Thursday that it would not remove the posts because they do not violate the company\u2019s policies.\n\nThat did not sit well with O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign.\n\nThe letters were sent to top executives at Twitter, Facebook and Google, companies that together wield vast power over the online ecosystem, shaping how their users communicate, think and vote.\n\nThe technology and publishing giants, O\u2019Malley Dillon wrote, are \u201cbeing used every day to proliferate misinformation, and corporate leadership is failing in its duty to protect our country from these attacks. In 2016, Silicon Valley\u2019s flagrant inaction called into question the very results of our presidential election; and if they don\u2019t do better in 2020, we may lose our democracy forever.\u201d\n\nThe communications, which were provided to The Washington Post, testify to the sense of alarm among some Democrats that not enough has been done to immunize the country\u2019s information landscape from the sort of attacks perpetrated by Russia in the lead-up to the 2016 election, attacks that prosecutors and intelligence officials say were designed to help elect Trump.\n\nAnd the letters illustrate the campaigns\u2019 increasing willingness to go toe-to-toe with the platforms. In July, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii), another Democratic contender for president, filed a federal lawsuit against Google, claiming that the company denied her free speech when it temporarily suspended her advertising account following the first Democratic debate. The legal claim is believed to mark the first time a presidential candidate has sued a technology giant.\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign did not go that far. But it put the tech companies on notice about objections to the way they construe their role as referees of political discourse.\n\n\u201cThis is your job, not ours,\u201d wrote O\u2019Malley Dillon, who was a deputy campaign manager for President Barack Obama\u2019s reelection effort in 2012.\n\nShe made several requests, including that the companies do more to take down fake accounts and shed light on which political posts are gaining attention on their platforms and why.\n\nEach of the companies has made attempts to clean up the material it broadcasts to the public. Among the steps over the past several years have been tightening standards for political advertising and testing tools for fact-checking content.\n\nThere have also been notable setbacks. Google on Tuesday agreed to pay $170 million to settle claims that it illegally collected data about children as they watched videos on YouTube in order to more effectively target them with ads.\n\nNotably not among the recipients of the letters from O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign manager was the federal government, which this week dispatched representatives from the Department of Homeland Security, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the FBI to huddle with major technology companies \u2014 including the three criticized by the O\u2019Rourke campaign \u2014 at Facebook\u2019s headquarters in Silicon Valley. It was the first meeting of its size involving government and industry, and it came at a time when the appetite for regulating Silicon Valley titans appears to be growing in Washington.\n\nGoogle and Twitter representatives declined to comment on the letters. Facebook didn\u2019t return a request for comment.\n\nO\u2019Rourke has not been the only Democratic presidential candidate subject to smears on social media. In June, Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s eldest son, shared \u2014 and then removed \u2014 a tweet falsely claiming that Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) was not genuinely a black American because her father is Jamaican.\n\nTwitter disallows abuse, harassment and threats of violence, among other types of behavior laid out in its rules. The company also says it monitors for ma\u00adnipu\u00adla\u00adtion and acts when it detects large-scale inauthentic behavior.\n\nAccording to analysis by VineSight, none of the accounts that simply retweeted the original post about O\u2019Rourke were verified on Twitter. That doesn\u2019t factor in the users who amplified the tweet and added their own commentary, such as Shaffer and Gorka.\n\nJoshua Tucker, a professor of politics and co-director of New York University\u2019s Social Media and Political Participation lab, said platforms may run into trouble by seeking to remain politically neutral if the volume of false content disproportionately targets one party, as it did with Democrats before the 2016 election.\n\nRemoving an equal amount of anti-Democratic and anti-Republican content, he said, \u201cis actually only a nonbiased action if the supply of \u2018fake news\u2019 is roughly equal in terms of favoring or disparaging each party.\u201d\n\nTony Romm and Ellen Nakashima contributed to this report.", "description": "Letters addressed to Twitter, Facebook and Google come after a conspiracy theory targeting the Democratic presidential candidate spread on social media this week.", "authors": ["Isaac Stanley-Becker", "National Political Reporter", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/-lRFIdtwo9L4v04KRcKpUKgwBFU=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/L5UARYWQV4I6TDA4PSHOPBNYKU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
