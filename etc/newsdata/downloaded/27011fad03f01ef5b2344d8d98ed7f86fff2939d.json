The equation is simple: without cash, the budget cannot be properly implemented.\u201d\n\nBy the end of September, member states had paid just 70 percent of the total assessment for the regular budget \u2013 129 out of 193 have paid their regular annual dues. There is about $1.4 billion outstanding. The U.S. is one of the countries that has not yet paid its full dues.\n\nThe U.S. pays 22 percent of the United Nations\u2019 annual budget. According to Reuters, the U.S. government still owes $381 million for prior budgets and $674 million for the 2019 regular budget.\n\nPresident Trump has been critical of the amount that the U.S. pays to the United Nations.\n\nGuterres noted that, as a result of the shortfall, budget implementation is not being driven by program planning, but rather by the availability of cash at hand.\n\nUnless actions are taken, the body risks a default that could disrupt operations globally, the spokesperson said, including reduced travel, conferences and purchases of goods. It also may not be able to pay vendors and staffers.\n\nHad Guterres not taken steps to cut spending this year, the annual meeting in New York would not have been able to take place last month, he said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "About 129 out of 193 members have paid their regular annual dues.", "authors": ["Brittany De Lea"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/UN-iStock.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
