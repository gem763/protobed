Tel Aviv University Professor Israel Finkelstein told Haaretz that the walls were repaired during the later period of Roman rule in the first century A.D.\n\nARCHAEOLOGISTS SHED NEW LIGHT ON BIBLICAL SITE LINKED TO THE ARK OF THE COVENANT\n\nFinkelstein and his fellow researchers suggest that the site could be the famous Biblical town, or village, of Emmaus. According to Christian tradition, Jesus appeared to two of his apostles on the road to Emmaus after his crucifixion and resurrection.\n\nIn Luke 24:13-35 Emmaus is described as being about 7 miles from Jerusalem. This corresponds with the distance between Kiriath-Jearim, Abu Ghosh and Jerusalem.\n\nEmmaus is also described in ancient histories as being a fortified town west of Jerusalem. The Kiriath-Jearim site is west of Jerusalem.\n\n1,600-YEAR-OLD BIBLICAL MOSAIC DISCOVERED IN ISRAEL, SHEDS LIGHT ON ANCIENT JUDAISM\n\nKiriath-Jearim is also mentioned in the Bible as one of the places where the Ark of the Covenant stood. Last year Finkelstein and his fellow researchers reported that the site of Kiriath-Jearim is the hill on the outskirts of Abu Ghosh.\n\nThe latest research is described in a forthcoming paper published in the journal \u201cNew Studies in the Archaeology of Jerusalem and its Region.\u201d\n\nOther locations, however, have also been suggested as the site of Emmaus, such as the ancient Byzantine town of Emmaus Nicopolis and the modern village of Motza, according to Haaretz.\n\nISRAELI SOLDIERS DISCOVER 3,000-YEAR-OLD BIBLICAL-ERA WATCHTOWER\n\nThe dig at Kiriath-Jearim is a joint project of Tel Aviv University and the College de France, supported by the Shmunis family in San Francisco. Finkelstein, who leads the project with Thomas Romer and Christophe Nicolle of the College de France, told Fox News that the latest discoveries offer a fascinating glimpse into the site\u2019s role in the ancient world.\n\n\u201cThe finds at Kiriath-Jearim hint at its long-term role as guarding the approach to Jerusalem,\u201d he explained, via email. \u201cThis can be seen in the Iron Age, Hellenistic and early Roman periods. The Hellenistic and Roman period remains shed light on the much-debated issue of the location of the New Testament\u2019s Emmaus.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe prominent Israeli archaeologist is renowned for taking an \u201cevidence-based\u201d approach to his research, which acknowledges the complexity of Biblical texts. \u201cReading the Bible, it is important to distinguish historical facts from the ideological/theological stances of the authors,\u201d he told Fox News in 2017.\n\nFollow James Rogers on Twitter @jamesjrogers", "description": "Archaeologists in Israel may have discovered the Biblical town of Emmaus, which is linked to Jesus\u2019 resurrection and the Ark of the Covenant.", "authors": ["James Rogers"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/KiriathJearim2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
