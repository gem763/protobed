No. Should I have raised my voice and yelled at him? No. However, when my 75 lb. Doberman is jumping up in my face with his mouth open, I do, as a dog parent, have to show him that this behaviour is unacceptable. But I want to make it known, REGARDLESS of what my dog does, I should not have acted that way towards him,\u201d she wrote in-part.\n\nHouts also said that in her \u201cheart\u201d she knows \u201cthat I am a great dog mom\u201d.\n\nAt the time, Peta condemned Houts\u2019 behaviour, writing on Twitter: \u201cDogs deserve respect. If you can\u2019t treat dogs with kindness and instead hit them, don\u2019t get one. Attention YouTube, please remove Brooke Houts from your platform.\u201d\n\nThe LAPD will reportedly reopen the case if new evidence is presented.\n\nThe Independent has contacted the LAPD for comment.", "description": "YouTube star Brooke Houts will not be charged with animal abuse\u00a0following a police investigation into footage of her pushing and slapping her Doberman.", "authors": ["Chelsea Ritschel"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/03/19/screen-shot-2019-09-03-at-2.33.29-pm.png"}
