Me and my boyfriend were upstairs and the dog was downstairs. I thought the dog looked cute just sat there by himself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The dog had followed a man on to the bus and the driver assumed it was his. The driver told us we couldn\u2019t go anywhere until it was sorted.\n\nGrandad\u2019s priceless reaction as watch he bought for \u00a335 is worth \u00a340,000\n\n\u2018He seemed stressed because he needed to carry on driving but he wanted to help.\u2019\n\nThey added: \u2018The dog kept sitting on my knee while I was stroking him so I don\u2019t think he was too scared.\u2019\n\nThe passenger said the driver tried calling several vets but all of them had closed for the day.\n\nLuckily he was reunited with his owner (Picture: North News / NNP)\n\nHe then eventually left the dog at an Arriva shop so that he could carry on driving, but planned on coming back to take him home at the end of his shift.\n\nFortunately passengers from the bus managed to get in touch with Alfie\u2019s owner and he was collected the same day.\n\nReview after Met officer's son walked free for killing two in drug-driving crash\n\nA spokesperson from Arriva said: \u2018We get some unusual passengers on our buses from time to time, but this dog was paw-fectly well-behaved.\n\n\u2018Our new furry friend joined us at the Darlington travel shop while the driver finished his shift.\n\n\u2018Thankfully, dog and owner have been reunited and we\u2019ll look forward to seeing them both on our services in the future.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
