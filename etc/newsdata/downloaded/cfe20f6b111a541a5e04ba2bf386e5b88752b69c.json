But the precise location from which they originated has remained uncertain.\n\nNow a new study suggests modern humans\u2019 ancestral homeland was in modern-day Botswana, just south of the Zambezi River.\n\nResearchers narrowed in on that area using genetic analysis.\n\nThis finding supports the theory that our modern human ancestors migrated out of Africa, rather than evolving in different pockets around the world simultaneously.\n\nSome anthropologists are skeptical of the new findings, however.\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nA group of researchers say they\u2019ve pinpointed the ancestral homeland of all humans alive today: modern-day Botswana.\n\nIn a new study published in the journal Nature, scientists analyzed mitochondrial DNA \u2013 genetic information that gets passed down the female line \u2013 from more than 1,200 people across myriad populations in Africa. By examining which genes were preserved in people\u2019s DNA over time, the anthropologists determined that anatomically modern humans emerged in what was once a lush wetland in Botswana, south of the Zambezi River.\n\nThough scientists agree that modern humans (Homo sapiens sapiens) arose in Africa around 200,000 years ago, they\u2019ve remained uncertain about exactly where on the continent that evolutionary milestone occurred. The new study offers an answer to that question and also undermines the idea that our ancestors emerged in East Africa, as limited fossil evidence suggests.\n\nThe anthropologist Vanessa Hayes, the senior author of the new paper, said in a press conference that the findings suggested \u201ceveryone walking around today\u201d could trace their mitochondrial DNA back to this \u201chuman homeland.\u201d\n\nA vast wetland cradled our human ancestors\n\nTo trace the geographic origin of our ancestors, Hayes and her colleagues examined mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from people living in southern Africa, such as the Khoisan.\n\nmtDNA, which is passed down the maternal line, is often used to trace human ancestry because it isn\u2019t mixed with paternal DNA. That means it changes less over time and leaves a clearer link to distant relatives.\n\nWhen it comes to mtDNA, modern humans all share a group of genes called the L macro-haplogroup. This L-branch is split into two subgroups: L1-6 and L0. The latter can be found in the peoples of southern Africa, and that\u2019s what Hayes\u2019 team analyzed. Eva Chan, a coauthor of the study, said this was the \u201cby far the largest L0 study to date.\u201d\n\nBy pulling on that genetic string, the researchers were able to figure out that every person alive today descended from a woman who lived in modern-day Botswana about 200,000 years ago.\n\nThe region this ancestor came from, called the Makgadikgadi-Okavango paleo-wetland, was near the modern Okavango Delta and peppered with lakes and greenery.\n\ncaption Okavango Delta in modern-day Botswana is similar to the lush wetland that nourished our human ancestors. source Via Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe team\u2019s analysis, which also included reconstructions of what the area\u2019s climate was like at the time, revealed that Homo sapiens sapiens lived in this homeland for about 70,000 years. Then, as the climate changed, our ancestors dispersed in two waves: First, a group spread northeast 130,000 years ago, then others left in a second migration to the southwest 110,000 years ago.\n\nAccording to Hayes, these migrating groups likely followed herds of animals out of the region.\n\nThis timeline runs counter to the one some scientists have created based on fossil evidence, however. The oldest-ever specimens of anatomically modern humans \u2013 skulls and other fossils dating back 195,000 years \u2013 were found in Ethiopia, which led many anthropologists to think of eastern Africa (rather than southern Africa, as the new study suggests) as the birthplace of our modern ancestors.\n\nThe new genetic analysis also offers credence to the idea that all modern humans evolved in one place in Africa before migrating to current-day Europe, Asia, and Australia \u2013 what\u2019s known as the \u201cOut of Africa\u201d hypothesis \u2013 rather than evolving separately in multiple places around the world at the same time.\n\ncaption A 2017 map of Homo sapiens\u2019 dispersal routes out of Africa indicates the origin point of our modern ancestors as being in East Africa, not southern Africa. source Katerina Douka and Michelle O\u2019Reilly/Flickr\n\nAccording to the study authors, the two-wave migration out of Botswana \u201cpaved the way for modern humans to later migrate out of Africa, and ultimately across the world.\u201d\n\nAn anthropologist questions the findings, however\n\nBut the anthropologist Ryan Raaum, who researches African population genetics at Lehman College, thinks the new study has a significant flaw. According to Raaum, the researchers didn\u2019t go back far back enough on the genetic timeline.\n\nThough Hayes\u2019 research pinpointed where the L0 haplogroup originated, he said, the mitochondrial DNA of most people in the world can be traced back to the L1-6 subgroup of the L-branch, not L0. So to find a \u201csingle origin\u201d for our species, Raaum said, researchers should find a genetic predecessor who lived before the genetic split between L0 and L1-6 occurred.\n\n\u201cWhere I get a little lost in the weeds is when they expand out to argue that these data indicate a southern African origin for anatomically modern humans,\u201d he told Business Insider. \u201cThe data do not.\u201d\n\ncaption The anthropologist Vanessa Hayes learns how to make fire with Ju\u01c0\u2019hoansi hunters in Namibia. Some of these hunters offered DNA samples for her study. source Chris Bennett, Evolving Picture, Sydney, Australia\n\nRaaum added that he didn\u2019t like the phrase \u201cancestral homeland\u201d in general, since modern humans likely had multiple homelands scattered around the African continent.\n\n\u201cI increasingly think that there probably wasn\u2019t a single population in which modern humans evolved. If that is the case, there is no \u2018homeland,'\u201d he said.\n\nThe researchers said they\u2019d need more DNA to make further conclusions\n\nAnother issue with Hayes\u2019 team\u2019s findings is that an mtDNA analysis examines only maternal DNA.\n\nTwo parts of the cell carry DNA: the nucleus, where most of our genetic material resides, and the mitochondria. Nuclear DNA (nDNA) is inherited from both parents and is what passes along the Y chromosome; mitochondrial DNA, on the other hand, is passed down from only the mother.\n\nnDNA is rare in the fossil record, which is why studies like Hayes\u2019 often don\u2019t examine it. But that means such research can\u2019t examine the entire genome of our ancestral populations.\n\nIn 2014, anthropologists pinpointed the oldest known modern-human lineage based on Y chromosome data. This population was at most 160,000 years old and in central western Africa. So every person alive today likely descended from a man who lived in a different part of the continent than the homeland Hayes and her colleagues suggest.\n\nHayes noted that a full genome analysis could yield different results: \u201cThere could be other origins and other lineages \u2013 it\u2019s a possibility,\u201d she said during the press conference.\n\nBut whether or not Botswana was the cradle of life for everyone alive today, the new research certainly suggests this part of Africa was an oasis for our ancestors \u2013 a significant addition to our understanding of human evolution.\n\n\u201cPeople want know where they came from,\u201d Hayes said.", "description": "Business Insider - Modern humans emerged in Africa around 200,000 years ago.
