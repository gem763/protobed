Mott Children's Hospital, said parents often questioned whether they were doing the right thing for their children.\n\n\"Unfortunately the first place many parents go for advice is the internet, social media or friends - not a medical provider.\n\n\"There is a lot of conflicting information on the web that isn't vetted or accurate.\"\n\nShe added: \"There's a wealth of research on how effective 'time outs' can be in reducing problematic behaviour, when they are used appropriately.\n\n\"It's a parenting strategy that's often misunderstood and misused.\"\n\nDr Knight said the key to using \"time outs\" were:\n\ncalmness\n\nconsistency\n\npositive environment\n\nplanning of the process beforehand\n\nmaking both parents and children understand it\n\navoid shouting\n\nDr Helen Barrett, a retired developmental psychologist, said a consistent message was important when disciplining children.\n\n\"Although there are parents who do use the 'naughty step', we have moved away from the idea that kids need to be punished.\n\n\"It always depends on the children - some find it humiliating.\n\n\"And it depends who you're doing it in front of. That can be more devastating,\" she said.\n\nDr Barrett said there were alternatives, for example children being sent to their rooms or asked to sit still.\n\nShe said the most effective parenting was being \"warm and authoritative, not authoritarian.\"\n\nThe NHS offers some tips and advice on dealing with behaviour problems in children.", "description": "If used appropriately, they can be effective in reducing problem behaviour, a US study suggests.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1325E/production/_108803487_gettyimages-896019492.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
