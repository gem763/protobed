But there are clear signs that a legal text is close to being ready.\n\nThe aim would be to present the draft to national delegations on Wednesday morning, an EU diplomat said. The pound surged, climbing as much as 1.2% to $1.2756, the highest level in nearly four months.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson will still need to secure the agreement of the U.K. Parliament. Negotiators have approached, and even managed to strike, a Brexit deal before -- only to see it shot down in London. Any concession Johnson makes to secure a deal in Brussels risks incurring the opposition of the Democratic Unionist Party, whose support will be vital for any agreement to pass.\n\nAll time stamps below are Brussels time (CET).\n\nKey developments:\n\nEU, U.K. negotiators said to be closing in on draft Brexit dealPound traders are gearing up for a nail-biting finish to BrexitJohnson still needs to persuade his Northern Irish allies\n\nSplits in Tory Ranks Over Deal Proposal (11:45 p.m.)\n\nIn a sign of trouble ahead for Johnson, the Sun reports that two senior members of his Conservative Party, Iain Duncan Smith and Owen Paterson, are unhappy with the compromises the prime minister is said to be making over Northern Ireland. Duncan Smith is a former Tory leader, and Paterson was Northern Ireland Secretary. \u201cWhen would any other country ever give up part of its territory as part of trade talks?\u201c Paterson told the newspaper in an interview.\n\nThe danger for Johnson is that once some Brexit-backers start to oppose the deal, it will be harder for others not to join them.\n\nDUP: \u2018Gaps Remain\u2019 on Proposed Deal (10:15 p.m.)\n\nJohnson spent around 90 minutes this evening speaking to Arlene Foster, leader of his Democratic Unionist Party allies, along with Nigel Dodds, who leads their contingent in Parliament. They issued a brief statement afterward: \u201cWe respect the fact negotiations are ongoing therefore cannot give a detailed commentary but it would be fair to indicate gaps remain and further work is required.\u201d\n\nThe Northern Ireland-Only Backstop (9:45 p.m.)\n\nAn EU diplomat, speaking privately, said that the two sides were working on the basis of the old, Northern Ireland-only backstop. Michel Barnier has previously said that the further negotiators move from this off-the-shelf legal text, the longer and more complicated negotiations will be.\n\nThe diplomat said there\u2019s a chance the two sides won\u2019t conclude the talks tonight, but they could still make sufficient progress for a \u201cconcept\u201d of a legal text to be presented at the summit. This would not be a fully ready deal, but its main principles would be clearly outlined, according to the official.\n\nIn that case, it is possible that the leaders will decide that negotiations can continue after the summit. But some fear that a delay would kill the momentum currently in the talks.\n\nAnother Push For a Second Referendum (9:30 p.m.)\n\nThe anti-Brexit Liberal Democrats are pushing for any deal to be put back to the public in another referendum. They\u2019ve put down a motion to go before Parliament on Oct. 22, calling for one. On its own, that vote wouldn\u2019t do the job, but it would demonstrate the level of support in Parliament for the idea. \u201cWe cannot predict from one day to the next what will happen in Parliament,\u201c Tom Brake, one of the MPs behind the move, said. \u201cWe need to be ready for all eventualities and to press the people\u2019s vote case at every turn.\u201d\n\nDUP Cautious About Potential Deal (7:30 p.m.)\n\nDemocratic Unionist Party leader Arlene Foster has given a wary reaction to the developments, emphasizing that any deal must not threaten the unity of the U.K. We need \u201ca deal that respects Northern Ireland\u2019s constitutional position as per the Belfast Agreement within the United Kingdom and indeed respects the economic integrity of the U.K. single market,\u201d she said in an interview with RTE.\n\nFoster suggested the idea of a Northern Ireland-only backstop plan, which has been mooted, won\u2019t be acceptable. \u201cI think that things are very far off the mark in terms of all of that,\u201d she said.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut Foster said she expected to engage in further discussions with Johnson later on Tuesday and would be working with the government to try to achieve a deal.\n\nDavis: Time to Back Johnson\u2019s Deal (7:15 p.m.)\n\nFormer Brexit Secretary David Davis has urged his Conservative colleagues to back any deal Johnson can reach. Talking to Sky News, he said his message to the \u201cSpartans\u201d -- the Tory MPs who have so far refused to back any deal, taking their name from ancient Greek warriors who refused to surrender -- was to remember that \u201cthe Spartans lost!\u201d\n\nBaker: \u2018Optimistic\u2019 Johnson Will Get \u2018Tolerable\u2019 Deal (7 p.m.)\n\nSteve Baker, chairman of the pro-Brexit European Research Group, and a man who refused to vote for Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal, has left Downing Street after talks on what Johnson is trying to achieve. He sounded like he was minded to support the prime minister, something that raises significantly the chances of a deal passing Parliament. \u201cI\u2019m happy to say it was a very constructive conversation,\u201d Baker told reporters, \u201cand I\u2019m optimistic it is possible to reach a tolerable deal which I\u2019ll be able to vote for.\u201d\n\nEU Envoys To Meet Wednesday Afternoon (6:30 p.m.)\n\nAmbassadors from the 27 remaining EU governments will be briefed by European Commission negotiators at 2 p.m. on Wednesday.\n\nThis could be the moment when we find out officially whether Johnson has a deal to take to the summit of leaders on Thursday.\n\nVaradkar: Gaps Remain as Talks Make Progress (5:30 p.m.)\n\nIrish premier Leo Varadkar said Brexit talks have made \u201cprogress,\u201d and are moving in the right direction, but as of a few hours ago, significant gaps still remain between the EU position and that of the U.K. The key difference remains on plans for customs checks on the island of Ireland.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Dublin, Varadkar said the situation may have developed in the last few hours and he would be briefed this evening on developments.\n\nNegotiators Closing In on Draft Brexit Deal (4:30 p.m.)\n\nA dramatic breakthrough in negotiations could come within hours after a productive day of intensive talks in Brussels so far. The British side submitted revised proposals for a deal which appear to have unlocked progress.\n\nThe U.K\u2019s plans are shrouded in secrecy but the focus is on Northern Ireland\u2019s relationship to the EU\u2019s customs union and the degree to which checks on goods crossing the Irish border can be eliminated. That border has been the scene of violence for decades until the late 1990s and both sides are committed to protecting the peace, which border posts could undermine.\n\nTwo EU officials suggested that the U.K. had accepted that customs checks would have to take place on goods traveling between Great Britain and Northern Ireland -- in other words between two parts of the U.K. -- rather than at the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.\n\nThat\u2019s something that Theresa May ruled out, and Boris Johnson\u2019s Northern Irish allies in the Democratic Unionist Party has previously said they cannot support. This means getting a deal on these lines through a vote in Britain\u2019s Parliament could be difficult.\n\nSaturday Sitting Will Depend on Talks: Rees-Mogg (3:15 p.m.)\n\nLeader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg said it still hasn\u2019t been decided if the U.K. Parliament should meet on Saturday, and events at the summit of EU leaders on Thursday and Friday will determine if it does.\n\n\u201cThe events that might require a Saturday sitting have not yet reached their fruition,\u201d Rees-Mogg told the House of Commons. \u201cIt will only happen if we have something, subject to what happens in European Council, to debate on Saturday.\u201d\n\nHe said Parliament meeting on a Saturday for only the fourth time in 70 years would be necessary to fulfill the terms of the Benn Act, which requires Boris Johnson to write to the EU to request an extension if a Brexit agreement has not been reached by then. Chris Leslie, a Labour MP who backed the legislation, said it does not need Parliament to meet for the law to be obeyed.\n\nFinnish PM Says U.K. Making \u2018Real Effort\u2019 (1:45 p.m.)\n\nFinnish Prime Minister Antti Rinne said an extension to Brexit may come up at the EU leaders\u2019 summit at the end of the week and there are grounds to consider it.\n\nRinne, whose views are significant because his country holds the rotating presidency of the bloc, also said it\u2019s possible an extra summit on Brexit will be needed before the end of the month. \u201cIt makes sense to try to reach a common view until the last moment,\u201d Rinne told reporters in Helsinki.\n\n\u201cFor the first time during this process I have a feeling the U.K. is making a real effort,\u201d he said. \u201cBritain\u2019s actions have shown it is seeking a deal to avoid a hard Brexit.\u201d\n\nJohnson, Macron Had \u2018Constructive\u2019 Brexit Call (12:48 p.m.)\n\nBoris Johnson discussed Brexit with French President Emmanuel Macron in a 20 minute phone call, Johnson\u2019s spokesman, James Slack, told reporters in London.\n\n\u201cIt was constructive. I would say it was a good discussion,\u201d Slack said, without giving further details of the discussion.\n\nThe U.K. is working hard to reach a deal with the bloc as time runs short before Thursday\u2019s summit of EU leaders in Brussels, Slack said.\n\nThe Pound Pares Earlier Gains (12:25 p.m.)\n\nAfter rallying on Barnier\u2019s comments that a deal is possible this week, the pound pared some of its gains, as details emerged from the meeting of EU ministers in Luxembourg, in which remaining sticking points were highlighted.\n\nIt was still up by 0.3% against the dollar as of 12:20 p.m in Brussels, amid cautious optimism that an accord is within grasp. The whipsaw between positive and skeptical headlines pushed one-week volatility to its highest since July 2016.\n\nFrance Says U.K. Made Serious Brexit Proposal (12:14 p.m.)\n\nThe French government believes that the U.K. presented a \u201cserious proposal\u201d to exit the EU, though it\u2019s too early to say if there will be a deal by the European summit later this week.\n\nThe situation regarding Brexit must be clear before the EU leaders meet on Thursday in Brussels, about two weeks prior to the Oct. 31 deadline for the U.K.\u2019s exit from the bloc, a French presidency official said during a briefing with reporters in Paris.\n\nJPMorgan Says Pare Back No-Deal Brexit Protection (12:12 p.m.)\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. credit strategists are so confident that the U.K. will avoid crashing out of the EU without a deal this month that they recommend closing Brexit hedges on no-deal exposed borrowers such as Lloyds Banking Group Plc and ITV Plc.\n\nCoveney Says \u201cToday is a Key Day\u201d (12:00 p.m.)\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t the time for optimism or pessimism,\u201d Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney told reporters in Luxembourg after the meeting with his EU counterparts and Barnier. \u201cThe negotiating teams have made progress but it\u2019s been slow,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThis is difficult, but it is possible,\u201d according to Coveney, who reiterated that EU leaders aren\u2019t willing to negotiate on a legal text. Such text must be finalized by negotiating teams.\n\n\u201cToday is a key day,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to raise expectations, but later on today or this evening, but if there is going to be a positive report that is needed in EU capitals tomorrow in advance of the EU Summit, well clearly, a big step forward needs to happen today.\u201d\n\nBarnier\u2019s Cautious Optimism (11:35 a.m.)\n\nBarnier was cautiously optimistic about the prospect of a Brexit deal during his meeting in Luxembourg with EU ministers, according to a national official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. A breakthrough is possible as soon as today, in which case the matter would be to EU leaders when they meet Oct. 17-18, according to the official.\n\nWhile the sticking points remain the same, Barnier\u2019s optimism reflects U.K. willingness to address EU concerns, said the official. Barnier himself, walking by reporters in a hallway in Luxembourg, told them the search for a Brexit agreement is an \u201congoing process.\u201d\n\nBarnier Sees Chances of Significant Progress (11:05 a.m.)\n\nHere\u2019s a bit more from Barnier\u2019s discussion with EU ministers in Luxembourg. \u201cNot all that U.K. has been saying in the last days is totally unacceptable,\u201d the chief negotiator said, according to one of the people in the meeting. \u201cThey have moved in our direction on key points and that\u2019s why I think we still can make significant progress today,\u201d he said, according to the official.\n\nRees-Mogg: Parliament Would Approve Deal (10:45 a.m.)\n\nJacob Rees-Mogg, the U.K. minister in charge of steering legislation through the House of Commons, said that if Johnson secures a deal with the EU, it could be ratified by Parliament very quickly. \u201cThe votes are there,\u201d Rees-Mogg told LBC radio.\n\nFor any deal to pass, the issue of the Irish border would need to be solved in order to guarantee the support of the Democratic Unionist Party, which has 10 crucial votes in the legislature.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what is being discussed in Brussels,\u201d Rees-Mogg told LBC. \u201cBasically, I am trusting Boris Johnson because he has been a Brexiteer before the term Brexiteer existed.\u201d\n\nBarclay: Deal is \u201cVery Much\u201d Possible (10:45 a.m.)\n\n\u201cTalks are ongoing and we need to give them space,\u201d U.K. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay told reporters in Luxembourg. He added that a \u201cdeal is very much possible.\u201d\n\nMerkel Promises to Work to \u2018Last Minute\u2019 (10:40 a.m.)\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel says Brexit talks are like \u201csquaring the circle,\u201d but she will continue to work for a deal until the \u201clast minute.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very, very complicated,\u201d Merkel said in a speech in Berlin at an industrial conference. \u201cWe\u2019ll work on it until the last minute.\u201d\n\nText Ready for Summit? (10:30 a.m.)\n\nBarnier has told EU ministers that there is a chance the two sides could have a consolidated legal text ready by Thursday\u2019s summit, according to two officials present at the meeting. The two sides are closing in on an agreement on the Stormont lock and customs checks in Northern Ireland.\n\nBarnier cautioned that the talks could still go one of three ways: conclude, reach a deadlock, or need to continue after the summit. He plans to debrief the bloc\u2019s envoys in Brussels on Wednesday about the outcome of the discussions.\n\nU.K. Carmakers call for EU deal (10 a.m.)\n\nAfter spending more than 500 million pounds ($628 million) preparing for Brexit, British carmakers made a last-ditch call to the government to reach a deal. Crashing out of the EU would threaten jobs and the industry\u2019s long-term survival, the Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders said on Tuesday.\n\nU.K. Submits New Proposals (9:55 a.m.)\n\nThe U.K. submitted new proposals to EU negotiators on Monday clarifying its plan for customs rules for Northern Ireland, two officials said.\n\nBarnier had told diplomats on Sunday that the U.K.\u2019s plans were too complex and risked opening up the European single market to fraud. Monday\u2019s proposals were aimed at responding to that, the officials said.\n\nFrance Says a Deal Is Up to the U.K. (9:30 a.m.)\n\nFrance\u2019s Europe minister, Amelie de Montchalin, said she is still hopeful of a Brexit deal -- but the onus is on the U.K. to bring forward its proposals. The complexity of what was being requested for the Irish border and the short time available make things difficult, she said.\n\n\u201cAn agreement is possible, but it has to be a balanced deal for everyone,\u201d she said.\n\nU.K. to Submit New Proposals (9:20 a.m.)\n\nThe U.K. will bring forward new proposals today, RTE\u2019s Europe\u2019s editor Tony Connelly reported, citing two unidentified people familiar with the matter. It is not clear if they are revised version of the current British plans being discussed -- which involve keeping Northern Ireland in both the EU and U.K.\u2019s customs zones -- or a different plan, Connelly added.\n\nLate Night Talks (9:15 a.m.)\n\nIn a sign of how intensive the Brexit negotiations have become, they didn\u2019t break up until about 11:30 p.m. on Monday, officials with knowledge of the talks said. They have already resumed in Brussels on Tuesday morning, they said.\n\nGerman Minister Not Sure Deal Is Close (9:10 a.m.)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not quite sure a deal is close but we\u2019re doing our best to find a good deal,\u201d Germany\u2019s Europe Minister Michael Roth told reporters in Luxembourg. \u201cA hard Brexit would be a disaster, not just for the U.K., but also for the 27.\u201d\n\nRoth said Germany was \u201cextremely flexible\u201d but that the integrity of the single market and the Good Friday Agreement, which brought peace to Northern Ireland after decades of violence, were key.\n\nDutch Minister Says Proposal Needs More Work (8:56 a.m.)\n\nThe foreign minister from the Netherlands told reporters that the U.K. offer indicates progress, but more work needs to be done.\n\n\u201cThe U.K. proposal contains some steps forward but doesn\u2019t yet guarantee that the single market will be protected,\u201d Dutch Foreign Minister Stef Blok told reporters in Luxembourg. \u201cThere have been intensive talks and they\u2019re still going on, but let\u2019s use the remaining time until Oct. 31.\u201d\n\nPound Gains After Barnier Comments (8:50 a.m.)\n\nThe pound jumped on Barnier\u2019s comments, rising as much as 0.7% to $1.2698, close to the three-month high touched last week after leaders said they could see a \u201cpathway\u201d to a potential Brexit deal. Hedge funds and asset managers have been paring their bets on a weaker pound, according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n\nBarnier Says Brexit Deal Difficult, Possible (8:35 a.m)\n\nEU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said a Brexit deal is possible this week but talks remain tough. \u201cEven if an agreement will be difficult -- more and more difficult to be frank -- it will still be possible this week,\u201d Barnier told reporters in Luxembourg.\n\n\u201cReaching an agreement is still possible. Obviously, any agreement must work for everyone, the whole of the U.K. and the whole of the EU,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that it\u2019s high time to \u201cturn good intentions into a legal text.\u201d\n\nEarlier:\n\nBoris Johnson\u2019s Brexit Deal On Knife Edge as EU Needs More TimeJohnson Has a Big Brexit Problem: His Northern Irish FriendsThe Brexit Threat to World Markets Remains Too Huge to Ignore\n\n--With assistance from Thomas Penny, John Ainger, Jessica Shankleman, Patrick Donahue, Kitty Donaldson, Vassilis Karamanis, Helene Fouquet, Leo Laikola, Jonathan Stearns, Robert Hutton and Greg Ritchie.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Ian Wishart in Brussels at iwishart@bloomberg.net;Nikos Chrysoloras in Brussels at nchrysoloras@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ben Sills at bsills@bloomberg.net, Edward Evans, Tim Ross\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Sign up to our\u00a0Brexit\u00a0Bulletin, follow us @Brexit\u00a0and\u00a0subscribe to our podcast.U.K. and European Union negotiators are closing in on a draft Brexit deal amid optimism there could be a breakthrough before the end of Tuesday, two EU officials said.They cautioned talks haven\u2019t yet finished", "authors": ["Ian Wishart", "Nikos Chrysoloras"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/qWtPMaF.4TQ1JOnywk_iXg--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/e77dd1c32d48aafe8044dac6a37563fb", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
