AFR\n\nThe acquisition of the Bundaberg macadamia orchards is part of efforts by Finasucre to diversify its activities away from sugar, where its financial results have been hit by poor sugar prices. In Australia, it also grows broccolini, raspberries, blueberries and sweet potatoes.\n\nAccording to its annual report, its Australian macadamia nut business enjoyed a good harvest and contributed $4.4 million to the company\u2019s turnover.\n\n\"The profitability of this activity is significant and we will continue\n\nwith its development by investing in existing orchards,\" the company said.\n\nThe family's history traces back to Count Maurice Lippens, a Belgian businessman, politician, colonial civil servant and lawyer who served as governor-general of the Belgian Congo in the early 1920s and later had business interests with Congolese companies producing cane sugar.\n\nFinasucre's chairman is Count Paul Lippens and its managing director, Olivier Lippens.
