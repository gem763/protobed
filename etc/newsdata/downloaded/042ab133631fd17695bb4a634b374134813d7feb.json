Another MVP could be headed to the Bay Area in due time, however.\n\nESPN's Ramona Shelburne reported Monday on The Jump that the Warriors \"have always been the big threat\" to sign Milwaukee Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo when he becomes a free agent in 2021.\n\nShelburne acknowledged the difficulties Golden State will have if it makes a genuine pursuit. The team is projected to have the third-biggest payroll ($156.7 million) in 2021-22, per Spotrac. Shams Charania of The Athletic and Stadium reported the NBA is expecting a $125 million salary cap and $151 million luxury tax that season.\n\nIn order for the Warriors to sign Antetokounmpo, he'd either have to take a contract well below market value, or the team would need to trade Klay Thompson ($38 million salary), D'Angelo Russell ($30 million) or Draymond Green ($24 million).\n\nThere's also the question about whether Giannis would want to join the Warriors. In an interview with Bleacher Report's Howard Beck last December, he didn't think playing on a superteam was a requirement to contend for a title:\n\n\"You don't have to have a lot of [stars]. I definitely think that, because I think we have great pieces in this team, and every guy in this team knows what his role is and is having fun and is enjoying his role. And that comes from the coach. You know, if the coach gives you confidence, gives you the green light and tells you what your role is and you accept it as a player, and you're happy with it, that's big for every team. I don't think anybody on this team wants to do more, wants to do less.\"\n\nHis opinion could change if the Bucks fall short of an NBA Finals appearance in either of the next two years.\n\nComments Durant gave to WSJ. Magazine's J.R. Moehringer could also be instructive for stars that might consider signing with the Warriors.\n\n\"As time went on, I started to realize I'm just different from the rest of the guys,\" the 10-time All-Star said. \"It's not a bad thing. Just my circumstances and how I came up in the league. And on top of that, the media always looked at it like KD and the Warriors. So it's like nobody could get a full acceptance of me there.\"\n\nSpurning Golden State to sign with the Brooklyn Nets felt like a concerted effort by Durant to reshape the narrative on this portion of his career.\n\nAntetokounmpo is eligible for a supermax extension in 2020, with ESPN's Bobby Marks projecting the 24-year-old can earn $247 million over five years. Bucks general manager Jon Horst confirmed the obvious when he said last week at a team town hall event that Milwaukee will offer the supermax at its earliest opportunity.\n\n\n\nThe idea of Durant leaving the Oklahoma City Thunder for the Warriors once seemed unthinkable until it happened.\n\nShould Antetokounmpo turn down the Bucks' supermax, all bets could be off regarding his next move.", "description": "The  Golden State Warriors  were unable to re-sign  Kevin Durant  this offseason.
