If you highlight new taxes, it\u2019s less popular. But if you highlight job creation or the air-pollution benefits, it\u2019s more popular.\u201d\n\nShe added that many climate policies are especially favored now because the public tends to take views opposite those of the sitting president, a concept known as thermostatic public opinion. \u201cWith Trump being president, you\u2019re going to find people want more environmental protection now than when Obama was in power,\u201d she said.\n\nRead: The unprecedented surge in fear about climate change\n\nThese results also align with the results of conservative-leaning surveys. The American Action Network, an advocacy group tied to the House GOP, recently asked Americans in 30 congressional districts\u2014including 12 \u201cbattleground\u201d districts and 10 Trump-supporting districts\u2014if they liked the idea of a \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d that would move the United States \u201cfrom an economy built on fossil fuels to one driven by clean energy.\u201d\n\nShockingly, the idea was more popular than not, with 48 percent of respondents in support and 7 percent undecided. Only when pollsters told people that a Green New Deal could cost $93 trillion did support for the idea collapse. But according to the GOP group\u2019s own math, a Green New Deal that focused only on climate change could cost only $13 trillion.\n\nResults from the new YouGov Blue/Data for Progress poll find majority support for spending along those lines, though the poll never uses the term \u201cGreen New Deal.\u201d Here are the five climate policies with the most support:\n\n1. A national recycling program for commodities\n\nDuring World War II, the federal government encouraged Americans to save and pool commodities\u2014including paper, steel, and rubber\u2014so they could be recycled and turned into new ships, planes, and guns. Sanders proposes launching a similar program today for clean energy. It would seek to reduce the cost and blunt the environmental impact of the huge buildout of wind turbines, solar panels, and batteries that he proposes.\n\nThe idea is overwhelmingly popular, with 64 percent of registered voters in support and only 16 percent opposed. Americans of every race, age, and religion overwhelmingly support the idea. So do six in ten white men, and a majority of self-described Born-Again Christians.\n\nData for progress/yougov\n\n2. $1.3 trillion to weatherize every home and office building in the United States\n\nAt least three different Democratic climate plans\u2014proposed by Senator Amy Klobuchar, Governor Jay Inslee, and Senator Sanders\u2014have promised to boost federal spending on weatherizing homes and buildings. Sanders\u2019s plan calls for more than $2 trillion in grants to help families improve their homes\u2019 energy efficiency.", "description": "Most registered voters are in favor of spending trillions on weatherized buildings and renewable-energy infrastructure.", "authors": ["Robinson Meyer"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/RTX73V1L/facebook.jpg?1570471874", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
