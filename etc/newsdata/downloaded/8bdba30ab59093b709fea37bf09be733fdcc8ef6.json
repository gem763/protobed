Let them love who they love, be proud of it, and not let such a minor thing be a deciding factor in whether or not they\u2019re cut out to do their job? As it turns out -- nope! Apparently we\u2019re still struggling to reckon with the idea of queer actors having a presence in popcorn movies. And Kristen Stewart claims to have proof of it.\n\nIn her latest cover story for Harper\u2019s Bazaar UK, the C\u00e9sar-winning actor relayed stories of how her queerness intersected with the kind of roles big Hollywood producers thought she could play. \"I have fully been told, 'If you just like, do yourself a favour and don\u2019t go out holding your girlfriend\u2019s hand in public, you might get a Marvel movie\u2019,\u201d she told the magazine\u2019s Contributing Editor Sophie Elmhirst. \"I don\u2019t want to work with people like that,\u201d she added. \u201cLiterally, life is a huge popularity contest.\"\n\nThink K-Stew, famed graduate of one of the biggest young adult movie franchise spin-offs on the planet, is capable of getting whatever role she wants? Well, you\u2019d be right: on paper, she\u2019s more than qualified to slip into the shoes of just about any character you could imagine. But as her comments suggest, there are barriers that exist that stop people from being attached to big-budget projects with lots at stake. While we assume that we live in a liberated cultural landscape, where diversity is a key selling point, there\u2019s plenty of evidence that suggests that this only works on the industry sidelines.\n\nThe big players and money-makers are distinctly one-dimensional: the \u2018Marvels\u2019 of the world seem to favour predominantly heteronormative narratives, or queerness in small doses. Sure, we\u2019re yet to see how Tessa Thompson\u2019s Valkyrie -- a character in the studio\u2019s Thor franchise -- fares as the series\u2019 first out LGBTQ+ superhero, but considering their track record of trying and failing in the past, we\u2019re hoping they give Tessa the chance to decide her character\u2019s life trajectory a little.\n\nStill, we don\u2019t think such fickle attitudes matter much to Kristen, who\u2019s got a much wider, pleasant perspective on the world right now. \"I just think we\u2019re all kind of getting to a place where -- I don\u2019t know, evolution\u2019s a weird thing -- we\u2019re all becoming incredibly ambiguous,\" she told Harper\u2019s Bazaar UK. \"And it\u2019s this really gorgeous thing.\"", "description": "What\u2019s a girl gotta do?
