Shares climbed 5.2 per cent, or 38.6p, to 788.6p.\n\nStock Watch - Pressure Technologies Engineering group Pressure Technologies has won a contract worth more than \u00a33million from EDF Energy to work on nuclear power plants. It will supply nitrogen storage at plants at Heysham, Torness and Hartlepool. Its cylinders, made by its Sheffield subsidiary Chesterfield Special Cylinders (CSC), will be supplied to EDF by mid-2020. Boss Chris Walters said: \u2018This represents the largest order in CSC\u2019s history outside the defence sector.\u2019 Shares rose 9.2 per cent, or 9p, to 106.5p.\n\nMining titan BHP was proving less of a hit with its shareholders, however. Major investors Standard Life Aberdeen is pushing it to drop its membership of controversial lobbying groups at its annual meeting next week.\n\nBHP is currently a member of several powerful groups which lobby for the fossil fuels industry, and have been blamed for obstructing the progress of measures designed to minimise harm to the environment.\n\nInvestors vote next week on whether BHP should quit these organisations. The company has told all investors to vote against the resolution, arguing that the lobbying bodies still have a role to play in shaping the future of the industry.\n\nStandard Life Aberdeen owns around 5 per cent of BHP\u2019s shares, which slipped 0.4 per cent, or 7.4p, to 1664p.\n\nThe London Stock Exchange was edging back up, after Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing dropped its bid for the group on Tuesday. Shares climbed 3.3 per cent, or 228p, to 7248p.\n\nAnd Hargreaves Lansdown nudged up ahead of its shareholder meeting today after broker Liberum started its coverage on the investment platform with a \u2018buy\u2019 rating.\n\nHargreaves\u2019 shares, battered over the summer as it suffered from the fallout of its relationship with troubled stockpicker Neil Woodford, rose 2.5 per cent, or 45p, to 1816.5p.\n\nQuilter was the other investment platform which won a \u2018buy\u2019 rating from Liberum, and was up 1 per cent, or 1.2p, to 127.45p.\n\nIntegrafin (up 0.3 per cent, or 1p, to 356.5p) and Nucleus (flat at 145p) were slapped with a \u2018hold\u2019 label by the broker, while Liberum recommended investors sell AJ Bell.\n\nShares in the platform, which listed just last year, have already more than doubled, but Liberum said the stock\u2019s value is now \u2018hard to justify\u2019. Shares were down 2.7 per cent, or 10p, to 363p.\n\nHollywood Bowl talent director Melanie Dickinson has cashed in some stock after the company\u2019s strike on Tuesday, when it raised profit forecasts.\n\nDickinson, who actually heads the human resources department, sold 200,000 shares at 225p, pocketing a healthy \u00a3450,000. The stock climbed 1.3 per cent, or 3p, to 227p.\n\nFund manager Liontrust had some satisfying numbers for shareholders as it saw \u00a3642million of inflows into its funds in the third quarter.
