He\u2019s not managed to get any jobs after graduation, he\u2019s reliant on his parents to get by, and he\u2019s exceedingly unlucky in love. Then, to top it all off, a mysterious white gas starts killing people all over Seoul while he\u2019s trying to impress his crush at his Grandmother\u2019s birthday party. If you\u2019re scared of heights this movie might be more horror than comedy, as Yong-Nam and Eui-Ju leap, climb and plummet from buildings in spectacular and hilarious style.\n\nWhy you should watch it: A comedy movie based around an unlucky-in-love rock climber who has to escape killer gas with his crush, what\u2019s not to love?\n\nI\u2019m Livin\u2019 It - Hing Fan Wong\n\nA movie about diverging paths, the human condition and the disparity between the rich and poor; our lead Bowen (played by Aaron Kwok) spends his nights in a 24-hour fast-food restaurant with nowhere else to go. There he meets fellow impoverished \u201croommates\u201d who find themselves in similar predicaments when it comes to finding a home and securing their futures.

From Bong Joon-ho\u2019s The Host to Steven Spielberg\u2019s Jaws we\u2019re drawn to the terrifying storylines where humans are no longer the planet\u2019s apex predator. The Pool is no exception, when an art director falls asleep relaxing in an exceptionally deep pool and he wakes up to find the water draining away. When it quickly becomes clear he can\u2019t climb out he starts shouting for help. Then, a crocodile shows up.\n\nWhy you should watch it: The tag line alone is reason enough to give this claustrophobic monster movie a try: \u201c6 metres deep. 2 humans. 1 beast. 0 ways out\u201d.\n\nEurope Raiders - Jingle Ma\n\nTony Chiu-Wai Leung Yan Tang\u2019s bounty hunters go head-to-head trying to track down a shadowy surveillance programme known as the \u201cHand of God\u201d created by the world\u2019s top hacker.\n\nWhy you should watch it: Over the top, bombastic, pick your jaw up off the floor action and set pieces that would make the Fast and the Furious movies say \u201ctone it down a little bit\u201d. A roller coaster of fun that should be experienced on a big screen.\n\nRainbow\u2019s Sunset - Joel Lamangan\n\nRamon, a retired politician with a big, loving family, comes out as gay in his senior years to take care of the love of his life Fredo. As his family come to terms with this entirely new dynamic, Ramon must learn how to deal with losing Fredo to cancer, his new relationships with his family and how to live as an openly gay man.\n\nWhy should you watch it: An eye-opening window into topics LGBT+ films often struggle to cover and a much praised performance by the late Eddie Garcia.\n\nMoney - Park Noo-ri\n\nA high-octane tale of stocks, betrayal and crime, Money follows rookie stockbroker Il-Hyun as he bites off more than he can chew to follow his dream of becoming filthy rich. After being approached by a mysterious equity genius named Ticket, Il-Hyun goes from nobody, to millionaire, to person of interest in no time at all.\n\nWhy you should watch it: One part crime drama, one part action, one part Wolf of Wall Street-esque thriller \u2013 Money looks like it will pin audiences to their seats.\n\nNina Wu - Midi Z\n\nTaiwanese psychological drama Nina Wu revolves around a bit-part actor\u2019s rise to stardom and the trauma she experiences along the way. Shot with eye-watering, over saturated and stunningly framed shots, Nina Wu looks captivating, disorientating and uncomfortable to watch all at the same time.\n\nWhy you should watch it: The star of the movie, Wu Ke-Xi, is also the screenwriter \u2013 her #MeToo tale shines a spotlight on the industry and the damage it does to women with stark honesty.\n\nThe Crossing - Bai Xue\n\nA coming of age drama wrapped around a crime thriller, Peipei has dreams of seeing snow in Japan with her best friend.

More powerful than fists\u201d.\n\nSamurai Season\n\nFor the first time LEAFF is screening a collection of samurai classics. This, you could argue, would take this list of 10 films to 14\u2026 But, when are you going to get another chance to see Toshiro Mifune\u2019s legendary fight in The Sword of Doom or Tatsuya Nakadai in Harakiri on the big screen?\n\nWhy you should see them: They really don\u2019t make samurai movies like this anymore \u2013 step back in time and marvel at the Lone Wolf and Cub movies and see a more modern take on the tale of the 13 Assassins.\n\nLondon East Asia Film Festival 2019 runs from 24 October to 3 November.
