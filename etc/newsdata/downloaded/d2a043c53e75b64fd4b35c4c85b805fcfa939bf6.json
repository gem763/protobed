However, Which? said it stood by its research.\n\nWhich? said its research was based on an online survey completed by more than 4,000 of its members, who were asked to estimate how long they were kept waiting while passing through security on their most recent visit to a UK airport.\n\nIts information on Manchester was based on 278 responses received in regards to Terminal 1, 229 on Terminal 2 and 168 on Terminal 3.\n\nThe consumer group said the airport appears to have downgraded its waiting time targets from getting 95 per cent of passengers through security in less than eight minutes in 2017, to getting 92 per cent through within 15 minutes today.\n\nThe study ranked Belfast International as the worst small airport for security queues, with a typical wait time of 22 minutes. Southampton and London Southend were found to be best for passengers with average waiting times of 5.2 minutes.\n\nLast month Which? claimed Belfast International had been rated the UK's worst airport - with passengers frustrated by problems including long queues, crowded terminals and expensive parking charges.\n\nRory Boland, Which? Travel Editor, said: \u201cNever-ending queues through security are a pain at the best of times, but if you are left waiting for hours on end you could find your flight has left without you.\n\n\u201cTo add insult to injury, if this happens you are unlikely to qualify for compensation as the time it takes to get through security is out of the airline\u2019s control.\n\n\u201cAirlines will rarely delay a flight due to long queues at security so it\u2019s important to arrive at the airport in plenty of time, especially if you are flying from Manchester or Belfast.\u201d\n\nA Manchester Airports Group (MAG) spokesperson said: \"We monitor actual waiting time performance in security on a daily basis. For most of the last year the average waiting time at Manchester Airport was around two minutes.\n\n\"Even in peak season, the maximum average waiting time in any month was five minutes and six seconds, in July 2019.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, at London Stansted, in August 2019, 98.5% of passengers got through security in less than 10 minutes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are working hard to reduce waiting times further by investing even more in facilities, staffing levels and training in our security areas.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the Airport Operators Association, a trade boy which represents more than 50 UK airports and airfield, said: \"Which?'s self-selecting survey does not reflect the experience of the millions of passengers travelling through UK airports every year.\n\n\"As data from both our regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, and the Department for Transport show, the majority of the public believes that airports get the balance right at security, delivering to the highest standards both for their safety and their travel experience.\n\n\"Nevertheless, airports continuously invest to improve our passengers' experience of airport security and as a result, 85 per cent of passengers were satisfied or very satisfied with their security experience in 2018 according to the Department for Transport.\"", "description": "Manchester Airport has been named as the worst for waiting times through security at the UK's largest airports, following a Which?", "authors": ["Jessica Carpani", "William Hague"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/14/TELEMMGLPICT000213014490-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
