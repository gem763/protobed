Sportsmail had a chat with the 72-year-old to find out.\n\nUnder-fire Mauricio Pochettino must start to 'get inside players' heads, says Harry Redknapp\n\nThe smiles have disappeared at Tottenham, just four months after making a European final\n\nScenes of full-time dejection have become common place for Tottenham fans this season\n\n'Yeah, absolutely, that is not going to happen,' says Redknapp. He's resolute and confident in his answer, without a second's hesitation. He's just been asked whether Spurs will soon part ways with Mauricio Pochettino.\n\nThe Argentine, monitored by both Real Madrid and Manchester United in the summer, appears to be a man on the edge.\n\nWith just one win in their last six matches, big questions are being asked of Spurs. A 7-2 demolition by Bayern Munich and a 3-0 loss to Brighton have hardly helped matters.\n\nRedknapp is sympathetic, of sorts. 'I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve overachieved. They should be finishing in the top three with that squad, that\u2019s where they should be, there\u2019s no doubt about that in my opinion.\n\nRedknapp places huge emphasis on the players, saying Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola would struggle to manage teams lower down the division\n\n'But to get to a Champions League final was great for them. It was great to see them reach the final.\n\n'At the start of the year I really thought Spurs would push Man City and Liverpool a lot, lot closer. Tottenham have got a great team, with Harry Kane, Dele Alli, Son \u2013 I thought this could be their year.\n\n'But it\u2019s been a disappointing start for them for sure and they need to turn it around quickly, but I still think they\u2019ll finish third.'\n\nSeveral times in the summer Pochettino cut a frustrated figure, making little effort to shield his annoyance at a perceived lack of spending. This, despite the \u00a365million arrival of record signing Tanguy Ndombele.\n\n'But they\u2019ve got the best stadium in the country, the best training ground. It\u2019s all in place,' reasons Redknapp.\n\n'They\u2019ve got a great group of players. It\u2019s some squad, if you go through it, I don\u2019t care what anybody says I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot between that squad and Liverpool\u2019s and Man City\u2019s squad, I really don\u2019t.\n\nSportsmail caught up with Redknapp during the McDonalds Fun Football initiative\n\nRedknapp imparted his wisdom to deliver the 2,000,000th hour of the programme\n\n'You\u2019re as good as your players. Graham Taylor once said \u201cyour manager is never as good as you think he is and he\u2019s never as bad as you think he is, he\u2019s somewhere in between\u201d and that is football management.\n\n'If you put Pochettino, or you put Pep [Guardiola] or [Jurgen] Klopp and let them go and manage Brighton or manage Norwich or Sheffield United, they\u2019re not gonna go and put them in the top six, it doesn\u2019t work that way.\n\n'It\u2019s about the players. He [Pochettino] has got the good players but at the moment there\u2019s been hiccups \u2013 one of two of them are not playing to their real potential or as good as they can.'\n\nSo, where to go from here? Fans, understandably, are getting restless. The team they followed to sunny Madrid a mere four months ago is now being shown up by relegation candidates, currently finding themselves just four points above the drop zone.\n\n'It\u2019s his [Pochettino's] job now \u2013 it\u2019s not about coaching or getting on the training pitch with systems and that \u2013 it\u2019s about getting in their heads and convincing them how good they are again and getting a good spirit and atmosphere around the place and start winning some matches,' Redknapp offers, in simple terms.\n\nBut what of the man himself? Redknapp is still hugely respected in the football world, regularly called upon for his opinions and insight. Is his time on the touchline completely over?\n\nRedknapp reveals Liverpool were the club he always wanted, and backs them for the title\n\nWith his familiar chuckle, Redknapp jokes Sportsmail's reporter would have as much chance as him of being offered a potential Spurs caretaker roll, should Pochettino decide to walk away. 'I\u2019m a realist, one thing I\u2019ve never done is live in cuckoo land,' he adds.\n\nIt's been a long career that's seen Redknapp at the helm of nine different clubs over a 34-year span, including a short spell with the Jordan national team.\n\nLooking back, however, was there a team he always wanted to call his own?\n\n'If I had one club I\u2019d love to have managed it would have been Liverpool. I loved them.\n\n'I can see them winning the league this year. Give them the title and give it to them now. I\u2019ve had a big bet and I think the bookmakers should pay me out!'\n\nHarry Redknapp was speaking at a McDonald\u2019s Fun Football Session where he helped deliver the 2,000,000th hour of the Fun Football programme.
