But it\u2019s even worse when you arrive in your new home, open up a box, and find that your printer has shattered all the wine glasses it was packed with.\n\nSo to ease the moving drama, we\u2019ve assembled some of our favourite tips for packing an efficient, secure, and (mostly) unbreakable moving box.\n\nFirst, stay organised. Keep each box contained to one room of the house (no more printers packed with wine glasses!) this will also make unpacking much easier. Also be sure to put the heaviest object on the bottom of the box, so nothing gets crushed.\n\nTo handle your fragile goods, make some DIY packing peanuts, stuff t-shirts into any loose spaces, and place drinking glasses or light bulbs inside of socks for security. (If you haven\u2019t packed your thick winter socks yet, that\u2019s even safer.)\n\nThe video above has these tips plus a few more for stacking plates, wrapping up clothes on hangers, and quickly finding the end of the tape roll.", "description": "Moving is a long, arduous process.
