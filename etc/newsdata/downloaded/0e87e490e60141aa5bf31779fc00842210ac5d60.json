REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday he would not tie a much-anticipated trade deal with China to his publicly stated desire for Beijing to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a potential rival in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nSpeaking to reporters before departing the White House, Trump said negotiations to end the U.S. trade war with China were separate from any investigation into Biden, who Trump has accused of foreign corruption.\n\n\u201cOne thing has nothing to do with the other,\u201d the Republican president said when asked whether he would be more likely to make a deal with China if it investigated Biden. \u201cI want to do a trade deal with China, but only if it\u2019s good for our country.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday Trump publicly urged Beijing to investigate Biden, a Democrat, again raising concerns that he has invited foreign interference in the U.S. presidential election. Last week Trump released a transcript of a call where he asked Ukraine\u2019s president to also look into Biden, a request that has triggered a congressional inquiry into whether he should be impeached.\n\nTrump confirmed on Friday he would send a letter to House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi requesting that the chamber hold a full vote to formally approve the inquiry, a move that could slow the process down.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday he would not tie a much-anticipated trade deal with China to his publicly stated desire for Beijing to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a potential rival in the 2020 presidential election.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1437079571&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9318L", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
