The New England Patriots signed Brown on Saturday hours after he was released from the Oakland Raiders.\n\nBrown\u2019s tumultuous short stint with the Raiders wasn\u2019t enough to drive the Patriots away. Brown demanded his release after getting fined, which voided $29 million in guaranteed money he would have received in Oakland. It appeared to be the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back for Brown, at least.\n\nREAD MORE ABOUT THE ANTONIO BROWN SAGA\n\nBelichick was asked why he was confident that Brown wouldn\u2019t be the same disruption in the Patriots\u2019 locker room as he was with the Raiders or the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\n\u201cI wasn't in either one of those places so I can't really comment on what did or didn't happen there,\u201d Belichick said bluntly, according to NBC Sports Boston.\n\nWhen Belichick was pressed again about Brown\u2019s behavior, the six-time Super Bowl-winning head coach invoked the team\u2019s acquisition of Randy Moss.\n\nROB GRONKOWSKI CONFIDENT NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS CAN HANDLE ANTONIO BROWN\n\n\u201cIt's the same thing you guys [the media] said about Randy Moss when we brought him in,\u201d he said.\n\nThe comparisons between Brown and Moss have been made.\n\nThe Minnesota Vikings traded Moss to the Oakland Raiders in March 2005. He openly expressed his unhappiness in Oakland during his two seasons there. He was then traded to the Patriots prior to the 2007 season. Moss caught a career-high 23 touchdown passes and the Patriots went 16-0 in the regular season before falling to the New York Giants in the playoffs.\n\nUnlike Moss, Brown never played a down for the Raiders before he was let go.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBrown\u2019s drama was the talk of the offseason and his arrival in New England definitely makes the Patriots one of the favorites to win the Super Bowl \u2026 again.", "description": "This is not Bill Belichick\u2019s first rodeo.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is An Editor For Fox News.
