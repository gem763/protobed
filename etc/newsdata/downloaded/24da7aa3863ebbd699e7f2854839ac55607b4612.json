After a month of backlash to having Kara Ross, hostess of the Trump fundraiser that shook Equinox members across the nation, on the board of the CFDA, and about two years of anxiety about Harvey Weinstein\u2019s ex-wife Georgina Chapman\u2019s board seat, they\u2019ve become emeritus board members. Mimi So and Marcus Wainwright have also vacated their seats to become emeritus members. In their place? Well, that\u2019s the exciting part. Four designers of color will be filling the board seats: Maria Cornejo, Carly Cushnie, Virgil Abloh, and Kerby Jean-Raymond. Tom Ford, the chairman on the CFDA, confirmed the changes last week.\n\nFord told WWD that he was \u201crearranging the board so that it is more diverse in age and more diverse in every way \u2026 Lots of people voiced a concern that the board, and the CFDA, was not diverse enough.\u201d That\u2019s true. Before the four new appointees took their seats, only five board members were people of color. With Mimi So\u2019s exit, there are now eight. So, the diversity of the CFDA has almost doubled in the past week.\n\nWWD reported that Ford informed the four exiting members of their \u201cstatus change\u201d last month, and they responded \u201cpositively.\u201d Ford and CFDA CEO Steven Kolb had met to decide who should leave and who should take their places. \u201cWe talked about how many slots we need to free up to make it more diverse, and what sort of diversity was missing,\u201d Ford said. \u201cIf we wanted to bring these people in, where is there an overlap of voice, meaning people with the same types of collections or of the same age? So that\u2019s how that was decided.\u201d\n\nFord says Ross\u2019s exit has \u201cnothing to do with her political views or her [husband\u2019s] fundraiser for Trump.\u201d Apparently, it was planned months ago. \u201cAs you know, there were so many calls for people within the industry for us to remove her from the board, which is totally wrong. It is not democratic, it is not what this country is about. To have done that would have been the same kind of censorship that our current administration tries to do with the press \u2014 tries to manipulate, in a sense, real freedom of speech. We never do that, and that is not at all what this was.\u201d\n\nWell, at least four designers who champion innovation, diversity, and sustainability have a seat at the table now.", "description": "The CFDA, American fashion\u2019s governing body chaired by Tom Ford, has appointed four new designers to the board: Maria Cornejo, Carly Cushnie, Kerby Jean-Raymond, and Virgil Abloh.", "authors": ["Sarah Spellings"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/03/3-cfda-final.w1200.h630.jpg"}
