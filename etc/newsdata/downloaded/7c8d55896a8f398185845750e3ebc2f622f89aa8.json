REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz\n\nThe Solomons\u2019 decision to switch diplomatic ties drew immediate criticism from the United States, and has even sparked calls by protesters in one major island province to seek independence from the rest of the archipelago.\n\nThe prime minister\u2019s office said in a statement to Reuters that it could not confirm who would represent the Solomon Islands in New York.\n\nSogavare\u2019s grip on power could also be tested if he left the country, due to a parliamentary system that relies on maintaining alliances to retain power.\n\nA parliamentary source said that Foreign Affairs Minister Jeremiah Manele had been prepped to lead the delegation.\n\n\u201cThe government is not stable enough for him to leave,\u201d the source said, referring to the prime minister.\n\nThe island delegation is scheduled to leave as early as Friday. The general assembly opened on Sept. 17, and the high-level general debate starts on Sept. 24.\n\nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence had directly liaised with Sogavare in recent months, and Taiwan supporters had wanted to stall the island government\u2019s diplomatic decision until after the U.N. meetings, where Sogavare could potentially form closer ties with the United States.\n\nPence has now declined to meet the leader in response to the island nation\u2019s decision on Monday to sever its long-standing ties to Taiwan.\n\nWhile the United States upholds the \u201cone-China\u201d policy recognising Beijing and not Taipei, it assists Taiwan, which includes significant sales of arms to the island.\n\nThe small but strategically located archipelago and site of fierce fighting in World War II had been assessing its Taiwan alliance since Sogavare took control after a general election in April.\n\nThe issue has divided loyalties in the former British protectorate, an archipelago of just over 600,000 people.\n\nThe United States retains strong support in the Malaita province, which provides a large voting bloc in parliament.\n\nPro-Taiwan residents in Malaita this week asked the Solomon Islands government to grant the province independence, according to a letter of demand seen by Reuters.\n\n\u201cAny Malaitan who fail(s) to support our demand for independence is not welcome in Malaita province until he or she shows his or her support for our cause to become independent from Solomon Islands government to manage our own affairs,\u201d the letter said.", "description": "Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare may miss the United Nations General Assembly in New York, two parliamentary sources said, amid rising tension in the Pacific nation over its decision to sever ties with Taiwan and align with Beijing.", "authors": ["Jonathan Barrett", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190919&t=2&i=1431519811&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I0G7", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
