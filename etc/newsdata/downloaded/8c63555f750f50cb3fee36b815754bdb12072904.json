After starter Kenta Maeda got through a strong inning-plus, a revolving assortment of relievers allowed five runs in a 6-1 loss to the Washington Nationals on Monday that tied the NL Division Series at 2.\n\n\u201cThe result certainly wasn\u2019t what we would have hoped for, but as far as kind of the process, I loved it,\u201d Roberts said.\n\nPedro B\u00e1ez gave up a three-run home run to Ryan Zimmerman in the fifth that busted open the game, and his teammates couldn\u2019t crack Nationals ace Max Scherzer to close out the series.\n\nInstead, the Dodgers will turn to Walker Buehler in a winner-take-all Game 5 on Wednesday back in Los Angeles and hope the young right-hander can continue his yearlong success in the biggest of pressure situations thus far. Buehler tossed six scoreless innings to beat the Nationals in Game 1, and Roberts said Clayton Kershaw is ready to follow in relief.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited,\u201d Buehler said. \u201cI think the thing that\u2019s kind of lost in playoff baseball is that it\u2019s really fun. And I think the pressure and things like that, if you spin it in your head the right way it can make it more fun.\u201d\n\nWith Los Angeles up 2-1 in the series, all options potentially were available for Roberts on Monday, including Kershaw, who memorably closed out the Game 5 in 2017 in Washington to send the Dodgers to the NL Championship Series. After Hill walked four in 2 2/3 innings, Roberts turned to Maeda, Julio Ur\u00edas, B\u00e1ez, Ross Stripling and Dustin May with less than favorable results.\n\nMaeda struck out two in 1 1/3 innings, then came out as pinch-hitter A.J. Pollock struck out for the 10th time in 12 playoff at-bats. Roberts was limited with how much he could use Maeda after an appearance in Game 3 Sunday.\n\nRoberts didn\u2019t like what he saw from Ur\u00edas in giving up three hits in the fifth and was confident about his decision to yank him for B\u00e1ez with Zimmerman up and two on.\n\n\u201cI just felt that Pedro was a better matchup considering where he was at as far as freshness and I just liked him in that spot, I really did,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cSo the thought was for Pedro to continue to get out of it and continue on.\u201d\n\nB\u00e1ez promptly served up the 97 mph fastball that Zimmerman sent over the center-field fence.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same thing I\u2019ve been doing all year is trying to go in there, trying to come in with the mentality of trying to get the out, try to do my job,\u201d B\u00e1ez said through an interpreter. \u201cUnfortunately today he was able to get that high fastball and make good contact.\u201d\n\nBetween the third and fifth innings, Dodgers pitchers allowed more runs than they had in any of the first three games of the series. Stripling then had a wild pitch that helped the Nationals tack on another run in the sixth, and the Dodgers came up empty after loading the bases with one out in the seventh against Scherzer, who struck out seven and allowed one run in the victory.\n\n\u201cScherzer pitched really well,\u201d Dodgers catcher Will Smith said. \u201cHe had his slider going, his change-up to the lefties and he was mixing his fastball in pretty good. He was just making pitches all night.\u201d\n\nAbsent a solo home run by Justin Turner in the first, the lack of clutch hitting couldn\u2019t dig the Dodgers out of the deep hole their pitchers put them in. That included two fruitless innings against a Washington bullpen imploded a day earlier.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Rich Hill isn't sure how the course of history could have differed for the Los Angeles Dodgers if he recorded one more out.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Stephen Whyno"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/07/nlds_dodgers_nationals_baseball_94295_c0-147-3525-2202_s1770x1032.jpg?3913425a55cc96b5c72c4c347c1ffc1430137daf", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
