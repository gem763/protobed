According to app researcher Jane Mancun Wong, the company is currently testing out this feature in one of the app\u2019s test builds.\n\nScreenshots posted in Wong\u2019s tweet indicates once you snap a photo from the stories camera option, it\u2019ll let you post it to your stories, stories visible to only close friends, and stories for a group. Plus, you\u2019ll be able to create a new group and post your story there too.\n\nInstagram is testing Group Story pic.twitter.com/zNKaV19kYA \u2014 Jane Manchun Wong (@wongmjane) October 5, 2019\n\nThis can be quite useful if you have groups with specific shared interests on Instagram. You can post stories related to that topic just to your group instead of sharing it with a wider range of people.\n\nLast month, Facebook closed down its group stories feature just after nine months of its introduction. However, it can find a valuable place in a more photo-friendly platform.\n\nAt the moment, there\u2019s no word on when this feature will be available for users. We\u2019ll keep an eye out for you, and update you the moment it releases.", "description": "", "authors": ["Ivan Mehta"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FInstagrammock.jpg&signature=d99571df3fbf1cd432bd8273c9da71cd", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
