The final amount of intended raise, valuation and price per share offering have not been decided at this stage.\n\nThe filing shows the Hangzhou, China-based bitcoin miner maker lost $45.8 million for the six months ending June 30, 2019, on net revenue of $42.1 million, compared to $178.9 million profit on net revenue of $1.947 billion for the first half of 2018.\n\nCanaan said net income in full year 2018 was $8.3 million on net revenue of $394 million, as the bitcoin price plunged in the second half of 2018 from above $6,000 to around $3,000, causing many bitcoin miners to be unprofitable to operate.\n\nThe filing marks the third attempt of Canaan in its efforts to go public, after its first and second trial in mainland China and Hong Kong, respectively, both fell through due to market uncertainties.\n\nChinese media this month pegged Canaan\u2019s valuation at between $2 billion and $3 billion, with 126 million shares to be issued.\n\nThe company started considering giving it another go in either mainland China or the U.S. earlier this year and has reportedly filed a draft prospectus confidentially with the SEC in July. But a formal F-1 form was not made public until today.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price jump this year has caused the demand for bitcoin mining equipment to outstrip the supply available from several major miner makers, which subsequently led to surging sales for leading manufacturers such as Bitmain, Canaan, and MicroBT. For instance, MicroBT, the maker of WhatsMiner, expects $400 million in revenue just for the third quarter of 2019.\n\nBitmain, on the other hand, is also reportedly seeking to go public in the U.S. after its long-anticipated IPO failed in Hong Kong as the local exchange and regulators remained uncertain on its sustainability.\n\nCanaan co-chairman Kong Jianping image courtesy to Poolin event\n\nCanaan earnings results via Edgar", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.coindesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/AIFvpOmnazoEHY_C3Taw18bx2bk6AL.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
