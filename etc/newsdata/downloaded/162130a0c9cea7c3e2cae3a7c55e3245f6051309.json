The popular car accounts for two-thirds of Sunderland\u2019s output.\n\nDe Ficchy added Thursday that the company\u2019s recent decision to stop night shifts was not linked to Brexit, but was due to the need to optimise production of the three models it builds \u2014 which comprise the Juke, the Qashqai sport utility vehicle and the Leaf electric car.\n\n\u201cIt is important to have some clear discussions about the future and about the situation in which we have to operate, which we have with Brexit,\u201d added De Ficchy.\n\n\u201cThere has been many speculations about the current uncertainty. I wish to clarify the Nissan position about that.\n\n\u201cWe have been working together in Europe to define all the risks associated with Brexit coming in and we think we are all really well prepared.\n\n\u201cI think from an operational point of view we have worked in order to prepare for all the different scenarios.\u201d\n\nNissan has repeatedly called upon the UK government to spell out the nature of the future post-Brexit trading relationship between London and the continent.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Seismic\u2019 effect \u2013\n\nThe European auto industry warned last month of catastrophic effects of a no-deal Brexit, arguing it would have a \u201cseismic\u201d impact on car-making.\n\nIn a rare joint statement, chiefs from 23 auto business associations across Europe joined forces to caution against a brutal exit from the bloc by Britain, where giants BMW, Peugeot PSA and Nissan have factories.\n\nThanks to the EU\u2019s single market, automakers have supply chains that criss-cross the Channel and Britain is the destination of around 10 percent of vehicles assembled on the continent, according to industry data.\n\nBritain\u2019s largely foreign-owned car sector, which has repeatedly warned over the impact of Brexit, also faces shockwaves from a Chinese economic slowdown \u2014 and from Beijing\u2019s trade war with the United States.\n\nSales are also hitting the skids on weak demand for high-polluting diesel models amid a broader UK government push for cleaner transport.", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 The head of Nissan in Europe warned Thursday that a chaotic no-deal Brexit would threaten the Japanese car giant\u2019s future in", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/10/e777b7_no-deal-brexit-throw-spanner-in-works-no-deal-brexit-risks-nissan-future-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
