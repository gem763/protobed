The chart shows higher lows in August and October, and roughly the same highs in July, September and into October until today. INTC opened above all these highs and has continued to surge upwards Friday.\n\nINTC is above both the rising 50-day moving average line and the rising 200-day line. The 50-day average line is in the process of moving above the 200-day average for what is commonly called a bullish golden cross. This mathematical/mechanical buy signal can work well in trending markets.\n\nThe daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has been making a similar triangle-like pattern since May but a decisive turn higher could come today if volume is heavy enough.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator has been above the zero line before this breakout and the two moving averages are turning up for a fresh buy signal.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of INTC, below, we can see that prices have been above the rising 40-week moving average line for a number of weeks. The rally today when it is plotted on this chart will be a new high for the recent move up.\n\nThe weekly OBV line will probably make a new high for the move up and tells us that buyers of INTC have been more aggressive.\n\nThe weekly MACD oscillator moved above the zero line in late September and today's price strength will continue that buy signal.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of INTC, below, the price gap of today is filled in. The upside breakout is still very visible and a longer term price target of $68 is being projected.\n\nBottom line strategy: INTC has clearly broken out on the upside. If not already long, traders could do some buying this morning and do any additional buying on any intraday dip of around $1 or so. Risk a close below $51 now and the $68-$70 area is our first upside price target.", "description": "Let's look closely at the charts and indicators....INTC", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Intel Is Breaking Out On The Upside", "Buy Or Add To Longs", "Let'S Look Closely At The Charts", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Guy Ortmann", "Jim Collins", "Gary Berman", "Bob Lang", "Carolyn Boroden"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/b2a54cae-1fe5-11e9-82b4-256c5015b433.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
