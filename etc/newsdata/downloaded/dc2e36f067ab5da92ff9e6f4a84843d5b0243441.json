And what is tantamount to a post IPO crash isn\u2019t lost on one early investor.\n\n\u201cUber has lost its mojo,\u201d early Uber investor Bradley Tusk of Tusk Ventures said on Yahoo Finance\u2019s The First Trade. Tusk \u2014 a longtime confidant of Uber founder and board member Travis Kalanick \u2014 confirmed that he continues to be a shareholder in Uber. But depending on how third quarter earnings shake out, he may look to sell some \u2014 or all \u2014 of his shares once the IPO lockup period expires on Nov. 6.\n\nTusk says that investors have started to question Uber\u2019s innovation and whether it could be the Amazon of transportation. Losing that belief in Uber is critical at a time when achieving profitability is incredibly unlikely.\n\nThe logo for Uber appears above a trading post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Friday, Aug. 16, 2019.

The fresh pink slips come as Uber tries to unlock efficiencies in a business hemorrhaging scary amounts of cash.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s assembly passed a bill \u2014 Assembly Bill 5 - this week that may require Uber and Lyft to classify its drivers as employees rather than independent contractors. Doing so could materially raise the cost of doing business for ride-sharing giants that are already posting hefty losses.\n\nUber\u2019s stock is down 27% from where it priced its IPO in early May.\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-host of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
