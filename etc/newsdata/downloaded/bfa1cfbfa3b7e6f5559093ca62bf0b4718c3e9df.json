They are almost fully automated, one-button computer operated,\u201d Allwright said.\n\nBeside sails, some firms have designed huge kites that pull cargo ships, though just a few operators have adopted the system.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Opportunity\u2019 \u2013\n\nAnother option is to use \u201cFlettner rotors\u201d like those built by Norsepower of Finland, employing a technology developed by German engineers in the 1920s.\n\nThe tall columns are installed on a ship and set spinning, creating lift that propels a ship forward when they catch a perpendicular wind.\n\nVille Paakkari, a Norsepower representative at the London conference, said the columns can be installed in just a few hours, and can cut fuel consumption by five to 10 percent.\n\n\u201cThe investment pays off in three to eight years,\u201d he told participants.\n\nSo far, Norsepower\u2019s rotors are used on just two cargo ships and the Viking Grace ferry between Finland and Sweden.\n\nBut wind advocates say tighter pollution rules \u2014 potentially including more widespread taxes on carbon emissions \u2014 will force shipping firms to clean up their act.\n\n\u201cPeople only change when they are forced to,\u201d Van Peteghem said.\n\n\u201cWe need to find solutions so that what shipowners consider a constraint today will become an opportunity, and make them want to change,\u201d he said.", "description": "Paris (AFP) \u2013 Global shipping firms under pressure to cut carbon emissions are experimenting with an age-old technology: sails to harness ocean", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/21/db19ec_hydrogen-powered-energy-observer-boat-on-thames-river-in-london-on-2019-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
