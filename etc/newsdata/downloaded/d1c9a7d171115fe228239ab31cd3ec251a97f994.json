This is so easy to fix.\n\n\"Forty per cent of hospitals don't give anybody toast at all as they think that if they make toast they will burn the hospital down because of health and safety, but that's just an excuse not to do it.\n\n\"Nobody has done that. We have never heard of a fire set off by a toaster. They have many more dangerous machines in hospitals than toasters.\n\n\"We need to change attitudes,\u201d she told the Dorchester Literary Festival in Dorset.\n\nNurses at Barnet Hospital in north London previously told a patient who requested toast that they couldn't make it for her because it was a fire risk.\n\nIn August, Prime Minister Boris Johnson vowed to tackle the matter, saying such changes could improve patients\u2019 experience in hospital.", "description": "Hungry patients are being denied toast at NHS hospitals because of fears over \"health and safety,\" Prue Leith has warned.", "authors": ["Laura Donnelly", "Health Editor", "Rebecca Ryan", "Marcus Fysh", "Michael Deacon", "Juliet Samuel"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/01/TELEMMGLPICT000122827991-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqaRL1kC4G7DT9ZsZm6Pe3PehAFAI_f6ud569StXyOKH0.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
