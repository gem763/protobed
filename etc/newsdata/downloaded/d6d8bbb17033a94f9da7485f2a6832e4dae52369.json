Wearing a Disney costume\n\nAdults are prohibited from wearing costumes of Disney characters at all theme parks to ensure that guests receive a genuine interaction with Disney cast members only. This rule also ensures that the many children who visit Disney will remain safe. Exceptions exist for special holidays or events, but wearing a costume on a normal day will get you kicked out.\n\n\u201cDisney Bounding,\u201d which is the act of wearing attire that is reminiscent to the Disney character is the safer option for adult park goers. Alternatively, a \u201cCharacter Couture\u201d makeover at Disney is another way fans can dabble in festive fun\u2014which includes hair and makeup.\n\n9. Bringing prohibited items\n\nDisney theme parks have an extensive list of prohibited items that they don\u2019t want to allow in. This includes illegal narcotics, alcoholic beverages, firearms, self-defense gear, flammable objects, folding chairs, selfie sticks and much more. A full list of no-go items can be found on Disney\u2019s website.\n\n8. Spreading ashes\n\nBelieve it or not, Disney World and Disneyland is said to be a popular spot for spreading a loved one\u2019s ashes\u2014but you absolutely shouldn\u2019t do so! Guests who are caught sprinkling the remainder of grandma on Disney grounds will be escorted off property, according to a Disney spokesperson who spoke with the Wall Street Journal.\n\n7. Public indecency\n\nDisney property is meant to be as family-friendly as possible. For this reason, Disney has a dress code that requires guests to not wear super tight or revealing clothing. Attire or behavior that demonstrates profane gestures are also prohibited.\n\n6. Cutting lines\n\nNobody likes a line-cutter\u2014that includes the \u201chouse of mouse.\u201d Not only are you not allowed to skip ahead, but you\u2019re also not supposed to save spots for others on line. The only methods of line jumping that are allowed include Disney\u2019s FastPass+ or Rider Switch.\n\n\u201cIf a child does not meet the height requirement or a guest does not wish to board a particular attraction, no problem! With Rider Switch, one adult can wait with the non-rider (or riders) while the rest of the party enjoys the attraction. When the other adult returns, they can supervise the non-riding guests, and the waiting adult can board the attraction without having to wait in the regular line again!\u201d - Disney\u2019s Rider Switch policy for guests who are visiting the theme park with small children.\n\n5. Feeding the animals\n\nWhether you are visiting Disney\u2019s Animal Kingdom or see critters throughout other theme parks or resorts, you\u2019re not allowed to feed them. Doing so disrupts their diet and encourages animals to return, which can cause a dangerous swarm.\n\n4. Trespassing on rides, attractions or the backstage\n\nIt might be tempting to uncover the secrets of Disney, but you shouldn\u2019t let that curiosity to lead you astray. Trespassing in any form will get you in trouble.
