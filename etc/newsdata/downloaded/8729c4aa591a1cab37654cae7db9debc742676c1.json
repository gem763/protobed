So we're just we're just responding in kind from the history that our our people have really put into helping one another.\"\n\nHe said it's not just Beauval that's rallying behind the family either, but that the community of Buffalo Narrows and Jans Bay have also shown support.\n\n\"Even if they don't know them directly or they're not related it doesn't matter,\" he said. \"They just want to really help out any way they can.\"\n\nThe Saskatchewan Health Authority has confirmed a paramedic with Meadow Lake EMS died in a fatal collision while responding to call near Beauval, Sask. on Oct. 25, 2019.

On Saturday morning, Saskatoon's ambulance service, Medavie Health Services West, took to Facebook to share their support.\n\n\"Our thoughts and prayers go out to the management and staff of Meadow Lake Ambulance, and to all of those affected by the tragic crash that occurred last night,\" the Facebook post said.\n\nTraffic restrictions were in place for several hours as police investigated the crash but they appear to have been lifted as of Saturday morning according to Saskatchewan's Highway hotline.\n\n'Long-time' since paramedic death in the line of duty in Saskatchewan\n\nKelly Prime, paramedic chief and president of the Paramedic Services Chiefs of Saskatchewan, said the organization will be working with the paramedic's family to determine how he will be honoured by the paramedic community.\n\nPrime said news of the death is hitting everyone hard, as it's been some time since a paramedic died on the job in Saskatchewan.\n\n\"It's something that I certainly don't want to happen again, but the realization is that it could happen at any moment because paramedics across this province put their lives on the line in rain, snow or shine to respond to the health needs of the people of this province.\"\n\nHe said he's been in consistent communication with his fellow chiefs, frontline EMS and the SHA about how to support the paramedics, dispatchers and communities affected while making sure paramedics continue to serve the province, saying having help in place for those who need it is critical.\n\n\"We have a duty to continue to provide service and we need to be at our best. And when we're affected like this, we are human, and not all the time, can we put that that brave face on and continue to do our job,\" he said.", "description": "Saskatchewan's EMS family is mourning one of its own after a paramedic based in Meadow Lake was killed in a two-vehicle collision that also took the lives of two other people on Friday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5155715.1568051318!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/rcmp-cruiser.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
