Nothing works. This is not a state. Salaries are very low, prices are very high. We don\u2019t even have work these days,\u201d said Cherine Shawa, 32, an interior architect, in Beirut.\n\nThe anti-government protests, fuelled by crippling economic conditions and anger at perceived government corruption, have fanned out across the country since Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to say to our leaders \u2018leave\u2019. We have no hope in them but we\u2019re hopeful that these protests will bring change,\u201d Hanan Takkouche, in her 40s and among a group of women in the capital.\n\n\u201cThey came to fill their pockets. They\u2019re all crooks and thieves,\u201d she added.\n\nRAMPANT CORRUPTION\n\nEnding rampant corruption is a central demand of the protesters, who say the country\u2019s leaders have used their positions to enrich themselves for decades through favourable deals and kickbacks.\n\nMany blamed the ruling elite for driving their children out of Lebanon because they failed to build a country that could provide jobs.\n\nThe mounting unrest has piled pressure on Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri to deliver a package of badly needed reforms to bring the country\u2019s crumbling economy, which has one of the world\u2019s highest debt levels, back from the brink.\n\nHariri, who is leading a coalition government mired by sectarian and political rivalries, gave his feuding government partners a 72-hour deadline on Friday to agree reforms that could ward off crisis, hinting he may otherwise resign.\n\nDemonstrators take part in an anti-government protest in Tripoli, Lebanon October 20, 2019.

The Maronite Christian Lebanese Forces party has said its four ministers would withdraw from the government.\n\nArmy troops and security forces deployed across the country and blocked roads leading to the presidential palace, which protesters had tried to reach on Thursday.\n\nBanks said they would remain closed on Monday, the start of the working week, and the country\u2019s main labour union announced a general strike, threatening further paralysis.\n\nGRIM OUTLOOK\n\nIf Hariri, a Sunni Muslim who is traditionally backed by the West and Sunni Gulf Arab allies, resigns it would be harder for the various parties that make up the ruling coalition to form a new cabinet.\n\nA new cabinet would also likely see Iranian-backed Hezbollah and its allies more in control, a shift that would make it nearly impossible for international donors or Gulf Arab countries at odds with Iran to offer aid or investments.\n\n\u201cWe want all of them to go, from the president to the prime minister and ministers,\u201d said unemployed Hanan Sinno as she protested in Beirut.\n\nHezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has thrown his powerful Shi\u2019ite group\u2019s weight behind the current government, saying the country\u2019s deep economic crisis means precious time should not be wasted forming a new one.\n\nWithout a foreign funding boost, officials and economists predict a currency devaluation or a debt default within months.\n\nThe IMF said last week that Lebanon\u2019s crisis requires tough austerity measures such as tax hikes and levies on fuel, steps the country\u2019s politicians have publicly vowed not to take.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nThe mounting unrest was triggered in part by a proposed fee on WhatsApp calls, a measure quickly scrapped but that was seen by many as the latest government attempt to squeeze citizens receiving little in return from the state.\n\nLebanon\u2019s economy registered just 0.3 percent growth last year. The IMF said the reforms were needed to stem a ballooning deficit and public debt it forecasts to reach 155 percent of GDP by year-end.", "description": "Massive protests swelled across Lebanon on Sunday in an unprecedented show of dissent against its ruling elite as hundreds of thousands converged to demand the overthrow of a system they see as riddled with corruption and cronyism.", "authors": ["Eric Knecht", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191020&t=2&i=1443002575&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9J0F9", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
