The document also shows that the company intends to pay Binance more:\n\n\u201c[Blockstack] will pay three additional incremental payments of 833,333 each, on the first, second and third anniversaries of the Services Agreement\u2019s effective date provided the Stacks Token is continuously listed on Binance prior to each such date. In addition, the Company will pay Binance a USD $100,000 payment for Binance\u2019s marketing services.\u201d\n\nThe payment is not a listing fee, per Binance\n\nThe filing follows an Oct. 23 announcement from Binance, which stated that the exchange did not charge a listing fee for adding Blockstack\u2019s token to its platform.\n\nWhen asked to clarify the apparent contradiction between the SEC filing and its announcement, a Binance spokesperson told Cointelegraph that the $250,000 payment received by the exchange is not a listing fee, and was rather a marketing fee that is Blockstack\u2019s idea:\n\n\u201cA long term payment fee is an incentive proposed by Blockstack for Binance to keep the token listed on the exchange. This is a new payment fee proposed by Blockstack.\u201d\n\nBinance also provided a comment from Blockstack PBC CEO Muneeb Ali, who explained that the standard agreement includes a listing fee referred to as the \u201cTechnical Integration Fee.\u201d This fee was $0 in this instance, which is what Binance stated in its announcement. Ali continued:\n\n\u201cThe \u2018Long-term Payment\u2019 is something new that is not part of Binance standard agreements and it was an idea that I had and I proposed it to them. This long-term payment is meant to watch out for the Blockstack ecosystem by incentivizing Binance to list Stacks over many years and aligns well with our long-term focus. The marketing fee is a joint marketing campaign that we plan to run later on, again that is not a \u2018listing fee\u2019 but a marketing campaign that we plan to launch in the near future.\u201d\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported earlier this month, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao announced that all the listing fees cashed in by the exchange would be donated to charity. Binance will not only donate such fees to charitable causes but will also allow developers to name the amount they pay, without demanding a minimum fee.", "description": "An SEC document reveals that major cryptocurrency exchange Binance received a $250,000 \u201clong-term payment\u201d to list Blockstack", "authors": ["Adrian Zmudzinski"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvZGNiN2Q0MmExOTYwMDU3NjQxMzAxNzc5ZDZlZmFiNTguanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
