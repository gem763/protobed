But since almost everyone sometimes prefers market mechanisms to state interventions, and sometimes prefer state interventions to market mechanisms, the conversation quickly gets confusing. Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher were neoliberals. Bill Clinton is often seen as a neoliberal. Barack Obama is sometimes considered a neoliberal. Elizabeth Warren is occasionally called a neoliberal.\n\nA label that can describe everyone doesn\u2019t usefully describe anyone. In recent years, neoliberal has reemerged as political slander, meaning something like \u201ccorporatist sellout Democrat.\u201d Kean Birch, author of an intellectual history of neoliberalism, argues that the term has collapsed into incoherence, with too many people using it to describe too many things for the conversation to remain constructive. Jon Chait argues that the word neoliberal has become an all-purpose insult, \u201can attempt to win an argument with an epithet.\u201d\n\nI think we need the term neoliberalism. At its most useful, neoliberalism describes what happens when capitalism mutates from an economic system to a governing and even moral philosophy. That\u2019s a more pervasive and destructive phenomenon than we tend to realize, and the idea of neoliberalism is the closest we have for a word that describes it.\n\nBut for that reason, I\u2019ve become more frustrated with the lazy ways the term is tossed around \u2014 and, particularly, how it becomes an all-purpose explanation for any political outcome someone doesn\u2019t like.\n\nFarhad Manjoo\u2019s latest column in the New York Times is an example. Manjoo argues that \u201cBarack Obama\u2019s biggest mistake rhymes with \u2018schneo-liberalism.\u2019\u201d But his examples, for the most part, have less to do with Obama administration ideology than congressional vote counting.\n\nThis is confusion with an agenda. If, say, the stimulus was too small because Obama was a market-fetishizing neoliberal rather than a far-sighted leftist, simply replacing him with a leftist will solve the problem.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t the problem.\n\nWhy wasn\u2019t the stimulus bigger?\n\nObama and his administration were market-oriented progressives. They were, and are, well to the right of Bernie Sanders. But they were well to the left of what Congress was willing to pass on literally any day of the Obama presidency.\n\nTake Manjoo\u2019s first example: the stimulus. He writes:\n\nBy the time Obama took office, job losses had accelerated so quickly that his advisers calculated the country would need $1.7 trillion in additional spending to get back to full employment. A handful of advisers favored a very large government stimulus of $1.2 trillion; some outside economists \u2014 Paul Krugman, Joseph Stiglitz, James Galbraith \u2014 also favored going to a trillion. But Obama\u2019s closest advisers declined to push Congress for anything more than $800 billion, which they projected would reduce unemployment to below 8 percent by the 2010 midterms.\n\nThe argument here took place between Christina Romer, who led Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisors, and Larry Summers, who directed the National Economic Council. In an early memo presenting various goals for the stimulus, Romer listed, as her shock-and-awe option, a stimulus that would \u201celiminate the output gap by 2011\u2013Q1,\u201d which she estimated would require a \u201cpackage costing about $1.8 trillion over two years.\u201d\n\nObama never saw that option. In the final memo Summers crafted, it was deleted as politically impossible. But here\u2019s the thing: Summers and Romer are both, in the popular definition of the term, neoliberals. They\u2019re both economists who believe strongly in markets. Krugman and Stiglitz are also lumped in as neoliberals. Correctly calculating the size of the output gap wasn\u2019t a question that divided neoliberals from leftists. The disagreement was political. Congressional leaders had told the Obama administration that the price tag had to fall under $1 trillion if the package was to have any hope of passing, and the administration listened.\n\nYou can argue, as a political judgment, that they shouldn\u2019t have listened. But the Obama administration didn\u2019t want a repeat of the TARP experience, where Congress voted down the bill and sent markets reeling. The economy was far weaker by the time Obama took office, and the fear was that another shock would prove catastrophic. They believed, wrongly, that if the downturn deepened and more stimulus was needed, Congress would approve it.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re at the barber and they don\u2019t cut your hair short enough, you can always ask them to go a little further,\u201d Jared Bernstein, a left-leaning economist who served in the Obama administration, told me in 2011. \u201cThat\u2019s sort of how I thought about stimulus policy. I don\u2019t think we could have done more in February of 2009 based on political and implementation constraints. But I probably didn\u2019t recognize how hard it would be to go back to the barbershop.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth remembering that even the $787 billion stimulus barely passed, and the three Republicans who provided the crucial votes insisted on $30 billion in cuts and a substantial shift from direct spending to tax breaks. In 2011, with the recession grinding on, the Obama administration proposed another $447 billion in stimulus but Congress ignored the request.\n\nThe idea that a $1.8 trillion stimulus was possible is fantasy, and the reason for that was Congress, not neoliberalism.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t Obama do more on inequality?\n\nThe stimulus isn\u2019t Manjoo\u2019s only example. Take this passage:\n\nIt is true that Obama succeeded in passing a groundbreaking universal health care law. It\u2019s also true that over the course of his presidency, inequality grew, and Obama did little to stop it. While much of the rest of the country struggled to get by, the wealthy got wealthier and multimillionaires and billionaires achieved greater political and cultural power.\n\nIn 2013, Obama called inequality \u201cthe defining challenge of our time\u201d and proposed a raft of policies for curbing it. Remember the Buffett tax? Or closing the carried-interest loophole? Obama\u2019s 2015 budget included $1.3 trillion in tax increases on the wealthy and corporations, and it intended to spend those funds, in part, on universal pre-k. That budget went nowhere in Congress. The blockage wasn\u2019t a neoliberal ideology that considered soaring inequality just or beneficial. It was Republicans.\n\nYou can argue, fairly, that the Obama administration\u2019s proposed solutions would not have driven America toward anything even approaching economic equality. I\u2019d agree with that critique, but it doesn\u2019t explain how a yet larger package would\u2019ve had more success in John Boehner\u2019s House.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act is a more interesting example. Manjoo writes:\n\nObama\u2019s biggest ideas were neoliberal: The Affordable Care Act, his greatest domestic policy achievement, improved access to health care by altering private health-insurance markets.\n\nI think it\u2019s correct to see the ACA as a neoliberal approach to expanding health insurance coverage. But the particular reason that Democrats embraced it wasn\u2019t because most of them preferred it to all possible alternatives. I covered that process extensively, and literally no Democrats I spoke to framed the ACA as their ideal policy. But, after decades of watching health reform fail in Congress, Democrats saw Mitt Romney\u2019s reforms succeed in Massachusetts and decided to copy them at the national level in a bid for Republican support.\n\nIt\u2019s worth remembering that this was the strategy favored by, among others, Sen. Ted Kennedy, who brought John McDonough, who\u2019d worked on the Massachusetts plan, to the Senate as his top health care adviser. The idea that a Romney-style approach would garner Republican votes proved wrong, though the idea that it could pass proved right. Even here, though, the plan was pushed far to the right during congressional negotiations, with Sen. Ben Nelson, among others, killing the public option, and Sen. Joe Lieberman knifing the proposal to expand Medicare to age 55.\n\nIdeology matters. But it\u2019s not all that matters.\n\nThe Obama administration made plenty of mistakes, some of them purely ideological. They bought into the deficit-hysteria of 2010-2011 in a genuinely damaging way. Their housing policy was weak, and while the politics of housing were much harder than is now remembered \u2014 it was the administration\u2019s tepid HARP proposal that led to the Tea Party revolt \u2014 the administration should\u2019ve put their back into passing \u201ccramdown\u201d and used more TARP money directly on homeowners.\n\nThere are places where a left president would\u2019ve differed dramatically from Obama, starting with personnel. A leftist wouldn\u2019t have nominated Timothy Geithner as treasury secretary, kept Ben Bernanke on at the Federal Reserve, or been as personally conciliatory toward Wall Street. Manjoo also mentions deploying antitrust laws to break up Google and Facebook and Amazon, though he admits that he, like virtually everyone else during the Obama era, loudly opposed anything of the kind.\n\nBut you can\u2019t blame everything on neoliberalism. If the Obama administration had been able to get what it wanted, there would have been far more stimulus, a public option in Obamacare, larger subsidies for health insurance, higher taxes on the rich and corporations, hundreds of billions more in infrastructure investment and social spending, universal pre-k, a cap-and-trade plan to curb climate change, comprehensive immigration reform, and much more.\n\nThe agenda the Obama administration passed isn\u2019t the agenda it wanted. The agenda the Obama administration passed is the agenda they could pass. It was congressional Republicans (and, sometimes, Democrats), not neoliberalism, that curbed their ambitions. It\u2019d be interesting to compare an idealized neoliberal agenda to an idealized left agenda, but you can\u2019t do that by looking at the few policies that survived the filibuster.\n\nManjoo waves this away. \u201cIf he\u2019d been in the mood to press the case, Obama might have found widespread public appetite for the sort of aggressive, interventionist restructuring of the American economy that Franklin D. Roosevelt conjured with the New Deal,\u201d he writes.\n\nEven ignoring the actual evidence we have on public opinion, the fact is that FDR entered office years into the Great Depression, and the agony of the suffering swept him in alongside a massive Democratic wave. Unemployment was above 20 percent when Roosevelt took office, rather than 7.8 percent, as was true for Obama. That misery didn\u2019t just hand Roosevelt the White House in 1932, it gave Democrats 313 House seats to the GOP\u2019s 113, and 59 Senate seats to the GOP\u2019s 36. It was those huge congressional majorities, operating in a time of less polarization and far more economic suffering, that made Roosevelt\u2019s agenda possible.\n\nThat\u2019s not to argue that Obama shared Roosevelt\u2019s outlook or would have mimicked his administration even if he could have. I genuinely have no idea what Obama would\u2019ve done if he took office in the midst of 23 percent unemployment and nearly total control of Congress, just as I don\u2019t know what Roosevelt would\u2019ve done if he took office with 7.8 percent unemployment and slimmer majorities. But the case that the two men\u2019s records were separated primarily by ideology and ambition is thin.\n\nThe right question, the wrong conclusion\n\nToward the end of his column, Manjoo poses a question. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of returning to this history now, a decade later?\u201d he asks. His answer:\n\nThink of it as a cautionary tale \u2014 a story that ought to rank at the top of mind for a Democratic electorate that is now choosing between Obama\u2019s vice president and progressives like Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren, who had pushed Obama, during the recovery, to adopt policies with more egalitarian economic effects ... not only did Obama\u2019s policy ideas produce lackluster economic results (at least in that they failed to hit their stated goals), they failed politically, too. The sluggish recovery in Obama\u2019s first years led to a huge loss for Democrats in the 2010 midterms.\n\nManjoo has the right idea here and the wrong conclusion. This is a cautionary tale. The results of the Obama administration\u2019s legislative failures were catastrophic in both human and political terms. But replace the Obama administration with a further left administration in Manjoo\u2019s story. What changes, exactly? How would President Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren have changed Sen. Joe Lieberman and Ben Nelson\u2019s minds on the public option? How would they have gotten the Republican votes they needed in the Senate to support more stimulus spending?\n\nThese are questions not of neoliberalism versus leftism but of political strategy and institutional constraint. Many on the left are, like Manjoo, loading neoliberalism with a weight it cannot bear. Condemning neoliberalism becomes a way of hiding from the harsh strictures of America\u2019s polarized, paralyzed political process, in which geography and gerrymandering gives Republicans a constant congressional advantage and Fox News spins an alternative reality on the daily.\n\nThe truth is that Obama-style liberals and Sanders-style leftists face a similar problem: both are well to the left of the median member of Congress, and both want to pass agendas far more ambitious than anything Congress has done in decades. How do they do it?\n\nThe hard choices here were underscored by another piece the New York Times published on Wednesday, profiling Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s efforts to modulate her approach to better fit the constraints of the institution in which she serves:\n\nAfter nearly nine months, with her eyes now wide open to the downsides of her revolutionary reputation and social media fame, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has tempered her brash, institution-be-damned style with something different: a careful political calculus that adheres more closely to the unwritten rules of Washington she once disdained. \u201cI think I have more of a context of what it takes to do this job and survive on a day-to-day basis in a culture that is inherently hostile to people like me,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said in an interview.\n\nOcasio-Cortez isn\u2019t losing her ideological fire. She\u2019s adapting to the institution that surrounds her. She\u2019d like a policy and political approach well to the left of what exists now. But if she\u2019s going to get anything done, she needs to find ways to work with the members who are already there, members who are to her right ideologically but whose votes are necessary if she\u2019s going to pass anything.\n\nThere are real differences between neoliberals and leftists, and those debates are healthy to have. But the fundamental constraint on Democratic administrations is not how far left they are, but how far left Congress is. If Bernie Sanders is elected president in 2020 but he\u2019s facing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, he\u2019s going to end up passing a more compromised policy agenda than if, say, Michael Bennet wins the presidency and Democrats take back the Senate. That\u2019s not because Bennet is to Sanders\u2019s left, but because it\u2019s Congress, not the president, that writes and passes laws.\n\n\u201cOnly now, in the age of Sanders and Warren and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, are we beginning to relearn the lessons of the past,\u201d writes Manjoo.\n\nUnfortunately, I\u2019m not sure we are learning them. If you look back on the Obama administration\u2019s shortcomings and see a purely ideological story, then you\u2019ve missed the political institutions that not only constrained him, but will act with as much or more force against Sanders, Warren, or AOC.", "description": "Congress, not neoliberalism, hamstrung Obama\u2019s presidency.", "authors": ["Ezra Klein", "Dylan Scott", "Eliza Barclay", "Brian Resnick", "Li Zhou", "Constance Grady", "Katelyn Burns", "Stavros Agorakis", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ujqKv-C9P3GwMXW2z_xHMsV_3UY=/0x135:3000x1706/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19216895/98907805.jpg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
