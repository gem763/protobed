Damon Lindelof created this semi-adaptation of the famed graphic novel by Alan Moore, though Deadline has previously reported that \u201cthe project is not an adaptation of the 12 issues of the comic but an original story that remixes them.\u201d In the new trailer for this remix tape we see Regina King, who plays a doctor named Erika Murphy; Jeremy Irons as Ozymandias (alias Adrian Veidt in the graphic novel); Don Johnson as a very Don Johnson\u2013type law-enforcement officer; and a whole lot of Rorschachs. The heroes, anti-heroes, and villains (and even some anti-villains) will bring all of their moral ambiguity to HBO beginning October 20.\n\nRelated", "description": "Regina King and Don Johnson star in the first trailer for HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Watchmen\u201d series, based on the graphic novel by Alan Moore and adapted by Damon Lindelof.", "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/05/08/08-watchmen-new.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
