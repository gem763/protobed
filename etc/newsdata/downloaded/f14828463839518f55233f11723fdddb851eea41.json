Most mornings in Australia begin with news from America \u2013 the bid to buy Greenland, adjustments to a weather map hand-drawn with a Sharpie or another self-aggrandising tweet. Our headlines and news bulletins, like headlines and news bulletins everywhere, are full of Trump.\n\nAs a political reporter for most of the last 30 years I have also endured many long and rambling political press conferences with Australian prime ministers and world leaders.\n\nBut watching a full presidential Trump press conference while visiting the US this week I realised how much the reporting of Trump necessarily edits and parses his words, to force it into sequential paragraphs or impose meaning where it is difficult to detect.\n\nThe press conference I tuned into by chance from my New York hotel room was held in Otay Mesa, California, and concerned a renovated section of the wall on the Mexican border.\n\nI joined as the president was explaining at length how powerful the concrete was. Very powerful, it turns out. It was unlike any wall ever built, incorporating the most advanced \u201cconcrete technology\u201d. It was so exceptional that would-be wall-builders from three unnamed countries had visited to learn from it.\n\nThere were inner tubes in the wall that were also filled with concrete, poured in via funnels, and also \u201crebars\u201d so the wall would withstand anyone attempting to cut through it with a blowtorch.\n\nThe wall went very deep and could not be burrowed under. Prototypes had been tested by 20 \u201cworld-class mountain climbers \u2013 That\u2019s all they do, they love to climb mountains\u201d, who had been unable to scale it.\n\nIt was also \u201cwired, so that we will know if somebody is trying to break through\u201d, although one of the attending officials declined a presidential invitation to discuss this wiring further, saying, \u201cSir, there could be some merit in not discussing it\u201d, which the president said was a \u201cvery good answer\u201d.\n\nThe wall was \u201camazing\u201d, \u201cworld class\u201d, \u201cvirtually impenetrable\u201d and also \u201ca good, strong rust colour\u201d that could later be painted. It was designed to absorb heat, so it was \u201chot enough to fry an egg on\u201d. There were no eggs to hand, but the president did sign his name on it and spoke for so long the TV feed eventually cut away, promising to return if news was ever made.\n\nPhotograph: Reuters More\n\nIn writing about this not-especially-important or unusual press conference I\u2019ve run into what US reporters must encounter every day\n\nHe did, at one point, concede that would-be immigrants, unable to scale, burrow, blow torch or risk being burned, could always walk around the incomplete structure, but that would require them walking a long way. This seemed to me to be an important point, but the monologue quickly returned to the concrete.\n\nIn writing about this not-especially-important or unusual press conference I\u2019ve run into what US reporters must encounter every day. I\u2019ve edited skittering, half-finished sentences to present them in some kind of consequential order and repeated remarks that made little sense.\n\nIn most circumstances, presenting information in as intelligible a form as possible is what we are trained for. But the shock I felt hearing half an hour of unfiltered meanderings from the president of the United States made me wonder whether the editing does our readers a disservice.", "description": "Despite being subjected to a daily diet of Trump headlines, I was unprepared for the president\u2019s alarming incoherenceNot normal: Donald Trump addresses the press at Otay Mesa, California.
