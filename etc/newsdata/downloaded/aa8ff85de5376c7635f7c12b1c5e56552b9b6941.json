Advocates of the high-capacity magazine bill believe the measure could help curb the destructive power of mass shooters.\n\nMEETINGS AT WHITE HOUSE\n\nTrump and Republican leaders from the House and Senate met at the White House on Tuesday afternoon. House Republican whip Steve Scalise, the No. 2 Republican in the chamber, later told reporters he did not know if Trump and Congress would ultimately come to an agreement on gun legislation.\n\nMcConnell reiterated on Tuesday that he would wait for the White House to propose gun legislation that Trump would sign. On Monday, Trump stressed the need to protect gun owner rights.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nWith a majority of voters favoring background check legislation, Democrats are hoping to underscore the sharp differences between them and Republicans at a time when, according to a new Gallup poll, nearly half of Americans worry that they or a family member could become victims of a mass shooting.\n\n\u201cThis is a representative democracy and the people want it, and we have to perform our offices on the assumption - whether it is true or not - that everyone else in our political system will do their jobs,\u201d said Representative Jamie Raskin, a House Judiciary Democrat.\n\nStaff-level discussions between Congress and the White House during the August break focused on red-flag legislation and proposals to close loopholes in current background checks that exempt internet sales and private gun sales, including those that take place at gun shows.\n\nHouse Democrats, who are also nearing a majority of support for an assault weapons ban, expect the bills to clear the committee and the full House.", "description": "U.S. Democrats in Congress, looking to heighten their profile on the hot-button issue of gun control, moved forward on Tuesday with new measures aimed at curbing gun violence, after President Donald Trump huddled with Republican leaders.", "authors": ["David Morgan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428398554&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF891R3", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
