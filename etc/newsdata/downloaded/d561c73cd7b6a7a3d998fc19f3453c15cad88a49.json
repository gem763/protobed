So let's wait and find out what happened before we jump to conclusions.'\n\nMinister of State for Foreign Affairs Abdel al-Jubeir denied that Saudi Arabia was responsible for the missile strike on an Iranian oil tanker (pictured)\n\nHe said: 'We did not engage in such behaviour at all. This is not how we operate and that's not how we did it in the past.' Pictured is the Sabiti oil tanker in the Red Sea\n\nA supertanker called Sabiti, owned by The National Iran Oil Company, was struck by two missiles 60 miles from the port of Jeddah at around 5am on Friday.\n\nIranian state-run television said the oil tanker was hit on Friday by missiles but denied reports they came from Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe explosions badly damaged two tanks on board the vessel, causing them to leak into the Red Sea.\n\n'Experts believe it was a terrorist attack,' a source told Iranian news agency ISNA.\n\nThe blasts follow a series of attacks on tankers belonging to Saudi Arabia and its allies and on Saudi oil facilities which have been blamed on Iran.\n\nForeign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said only that it was carried out by those committing 'dangerous adventurism.'\n\nMousavi said that the Sabiti was struck twice in the span of a half hour and an investigation was underway.\n\nIranian state-run television said the oil tanker was hit on Friday by missiles but denied reports they came from Saudi Arabia\n\nThe explosions badly damaged two tanks on board the vessel, causing them to leak into the Red Sea. 'Experts believe it was a terrorist attack,' a source told Iranian news agency ISNA\n\nHe added that Iranian tankers have been targeted by 'damaging activities' over recent months in the Red Sea, without elaborating.\n\nBefore Friday the Sabiti had not activated its transmitter for 57 days, when it was in the port of Bandar Abbas, but it suddenly began broadcasting its location again shortly after the blasts were reported.\n\nData shows the tanker is fully laden with 1million barrels of oil and is now heading back to the Persian Gulf with a destination of Larak, an island in the Strait of Hormuz.\n\nIt is unclear what the tanker's initial destination was. Iranian vessels often turn off their trackers to avoid US sanctions on oil exports.", "description": "Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Abdel al-Jubeir said: 'We did not engage in such behaviour at all.'
