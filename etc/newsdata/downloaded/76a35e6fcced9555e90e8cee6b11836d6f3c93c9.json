I find that the Nifty 50 has finally come out of its short-term uptrend zone, and have broken this short-term trend which it started to maintain since September 4th to 9th, 2019 in an hourly time frame; look ready to move downward once again.\n\nIndia's retail inflation rate increased to a 10-month high in August but stayed below the central bank's 4% medium-term target, strengthening expectations that there will be another interest rate cut next month. The next decision from the RBI's monetary policy committee (MPC) is due on Oct. 4. Retail food prices, which make up nearly half of India's inflation basket, increased 2.99% in August year-on-year, compared with a revised 2.36% in July, while prices of services such as education, health and entertainment climbed between 5.54% and 7.84%.\n\nHopes of progressing trade talks kept risk appetite up, after U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday he preferred a comprehensive trade deal with China but did not rule out the possibility of an interim pact, even as he said an \"easy\" agreement would not be possible. The two sides have been making conciliatory gestures ahead of the talks, lowering the temperature between them and cheering investors.\n\nEuropean Central Bank chief Mario Draghi pledged indefinite stimulus on Thursday to revive an ailing euro zone economy. The bigger-than-expected stimulus will increase pressure on the U.S. Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan to ease policy next week to support a world economy increasingly characterized by low growth and protectionist threats to free trade.\n\nFinally, I conclude that the growing stimulatory support by some Central Banks of the world look evident enough to define the quantum of fear of global economic slowdown; and the efforts made to resolve Sino-U.S. trade tussle are the part and parcel of the efforts made to remove this growing slowdown fear, but this tariff tool has already made a lot of damage at the global level which is yet to show its real impact on global equity indices. No doubt that if, the closes below the level of 10,863 on September 13th, 2019; it will definitely be an advent of steeper downward trend ahead.
