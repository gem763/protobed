Buttigieg graduated in 2004. He majored in history and literature, while Zuckerberg famously dropped out of the school in his sophomore year.\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s comments on advising the Buttigieg campaign came as the social media platform announced a presidential spending tracker, which will allow users on the site to see what regions candidates are targeting and if an ad ran on Facebook, Instagram, or Messenger.\n\nThe news also comes on the heels of what many have called Buttigieg\u2019s best debate performance of the 2020 campaign season, with the normally stoic mayor showing rare outward fire by pointedly challenging Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., on her health care plan and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, of Texas, on gun control.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I don't mind being a little professorial at times,\" Buttigieg acknowledged in a conversation with reporters last month. He added, \"Sometimes I think I'm misread because I'm laid-back. I'm misread as being bloodless.\"\n\nButtigieg\u2019s debate performance saw him get a big boost in the polls, with a recent USA Today/Suffolk poll of Iowa caucus-goers showing him surpassing Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders for third place behind Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nFox News\u2019 Hillary Vaughn and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wanted to make clear on Monday that while he did advise 2020 Democratic presidential contender Pete Buttigieg on some campaign hires, the move \u201cshouldn\u2019t be taken as an endorsement.\u201d", "authors": ["Andrew O'Reilly"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/20/694940094001_6096274944001_6096273430001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
