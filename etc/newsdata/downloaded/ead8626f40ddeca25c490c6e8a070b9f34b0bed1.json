The House overwhelmingly backed a resolution condemning Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, a move that cleared the way for Turkey's invasion.\n\nDemocratic leaders, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, stormed out of an afternoon meeting at the White House on Syria claiming the president does not have a plan contain ISIS. White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham described the move as \"baffling, but not surprising.\"\n\nDuring an earlier East Room press conference with Italian President Sergio Mattarella, Trump welcomed reports that Russian troops had entered regions once occupied by a small number of U.S. special forces \u2013 a stance that ran counter to the views of many lawmakers who expressed concern about Russia's involvement.\n\n\"Frankly, if Russia is going to help the Kurds that\u2019s a good thing,\" Trump said.\n\n'Not angels'\n\nIn this Oct. 7, 2019, file photo, Turkish-backed forces from the Free Syrian Army stand in formation during preparations for an incursion targeting Syrian Kurdish fighters, near Azaz town, north Syria. More\n\nThe president's latest remarks came days after he appeared to diminish the U.S.-Kurd alliance by saying the group is \"fighting for their land\" and noting that the Kurds had not fought with Allied powers in World War II. Trump said one group of Kurds, the Kurdistan Workers' Party, was \"more of a terrorist threat\" than ISIS.\n\n\"They're not angels,\" Trump said Wednesday.\n\nThe U.S. considers the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or the PKK, a terrorist organization. The U.S. allied with what Turkey has described as an offshoot of that group, the People\u2019s Protection Units, or YPG, to fight ISIS in Syria.\n\nAlliance: Trump downplays ties to Kurds: 'They didn't help us in the Second World War'\n\nHouse action: House will vote on resolution condemning Trump over Syria, Turkey\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got a lot of sand over there,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of sand that they can play with.\u201d\n\nThe president has repeatedly framed his decision in Syria as part of his broader pledge to withdraw U.S. troops from foreign entanglements.\n\nBut U.S. troops remained in Syria on Wednesday despite Trump\u2019s statement that they\u2019d been withdrawn, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to speak publicly. The military continues to close outposts in Syria housing U.S. commandos, the official said. The military has concerns for their safety because militias supported by Turkey are viewed as a potential threat in Syria to American troops, who are being evacuated by aircraft and convoys.\n\nIt's not clear how many of the 1,000 service members Trump intends to withdraw from Syria will return to the United States versus being redeployed to other countries in the region.\n\nGraham on Trump: 'Outrageously dangerous'\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., gives a statement after closed-door briefing on Iran in the auditorium of the Capitol Visitors Center in Washington, May 21, 2019.
