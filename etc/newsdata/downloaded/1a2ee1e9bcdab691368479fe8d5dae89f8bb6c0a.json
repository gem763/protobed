If he thinks it's okay to emit far more emissions than our campaign is emitting, we're going to hold him to account for his hypocrisy,\" he said.\n\nWatch: Andrew Scheer calls Justin Trudeau a 'hypocrite' for having 2 campaign planes; Trudeau points to carbon offsets\n\nAndrew Scheer calls Justin Trudeau a \"complete hypocrite\" for having two campaign planes, while Trudeau says unlike the Conservatives, his party bought carbon credits for their planes and buses, following Wednesday's TVA debate. 1:08\n\n\"It's always the same with this guy. He's always very quick at giving lessons and lectures and sermons about how everyone else should live their lives, but when it comes to his own personal behaviour, he's a complete hypocrite.\"\n\nA Conservative party spokesman, Simon Jefferies, said in an email to CBC News the Conservatives are not purchasing carbon offsets for their plane.", "description": "The Conservatives are calling Justin Trudeau a 'carbon hypocrite' for flying two planes during the 40-day election campaign, emitting double the carbon emissions of other campaigns.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5303361.1569879375!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/fedelxn-liberals-20190927.jpg"}
