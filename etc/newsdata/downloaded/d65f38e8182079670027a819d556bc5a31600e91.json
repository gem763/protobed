Scott Applewhite/AP Photo Congress Republicans and Democrats hammer Trump's judicial nominee Steven Menashi faced criticism for refusing to answer questions and his controversial writings.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats on Wednesday castigated President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to the powerful Second Circuit Court of Appeals for dodging their questions as well as his prior controversial writings.\n\nSenate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) in particular chided Steven Menashi for not being more forthcoming during his confirmation hearing after the nominee wouldn\u2019t provide specifics on how or if he helped shape Trump\u2019s immigration policy. Menashi is currently associate counsel to the president.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIn the weeks leading up to his confirmation hearing, liberal judicial groups railed against Menashi for his earlier writings, highlighting his comments on \u201cethnonationalism.\u201d\n\nGraham criticized Menashi for his editorial in the New York Sun on trial lawyers that the senator said suggested that such lawyers took advantage of the public.\n\n\u201cYou said something about trial lawyers that I particularly don\u2019t like,\u201d said Graham, who asked Menashi if he had ever represented a client in court. Graham cited his own experience as a plaintiff\u2019s lawyer and said that he \u201cdidn\u2019t have time to do frivolous lawsuits.\u201d\n\nMenashi responded that the editorial was written before he went to law school and \u201cshould not be seen as representative of [his] views as an attorney.\u201d\n\nGraham further questioned Menashi\u2019s writings, referring to an article he wrote for the University of Pennsylvania Journal of International Law about ethnonationalism and the State of Israel and asked whether he understood \u201cwhy we respect other people\u2019s faiths in America.\u201d\n\nMenashi said he merely intended to point out \u201cthat many states that are well known as liberal democracies have a linguistic or ethnic basis\u201d and that \u201cIsrael was not out of the norm.\u201d\n\nSome of the most heated moments in the hearing took place when senators grilled Menashi about his work for the White House. Menashi, for the most part, refused to provide many details.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just asking if you have worked or advised on the administration\u2019s policy of separating families at the border,\u201d asked Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the committee\u2019s ranking member. \u201cI\u2019m not asking what, just whether you\u2019ve done it.\u201d\n\nGraham even came to Feinstein\u2019s defense after Menashi responded briefly to similar questions from Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein questions Steven Menashi. | J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo\n\n\u201cMr. Menashi we\u2019re not going to do this, you\u2019re not going to answer his questions and not answer hers,\u201d Graham said.\n\nAfter Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) described the hearing as a \u201cworthless exercise,\u201d Graham advised Menashi to be more forthcoming and said that Democrats were only asking him questions about narrow subject matters.\n\nSen. John Kennedy (R-La.) also voiced frustration with Menashi after the senator asked a hypothetical question about school shootings and social media, as well as his views on the Bill of Rights.\n\n\u201cCounsel, you\u2019re a really smart guy but I wish you\u2019d be more forthcoming,\u201d Kennedy told Menashi. \u201cThis isn\u2019t supposed to be a game, we\u2019re supposed to try to understand not how you\u2019re going to rule but how you\u2019re going to think.\u201d\n\nWhen Menashi offered to be more open, Kennedy said he was out of time and Menashi \u201ctook a lot of it by not answering my questions.\u201d\n\nFollowing his confirmation hearing, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) lambasted Menashi, citing a \"long, disturbing record,\" called his views \"outside the judicial mainstream\" and criticized his work as a lawyer at the Department of Education under Secretary Betsy DeVos.\n\n\"As the top lawyer at the Department of Education, he played a critical role in executing Secretary DeVos\u2019s agenda to make it harder for campus sexual assault victims to seek justice, provide federal funding to schools that discriminate against LGBTQ students, roll back civil rights investigations, and undermine critical protections for student borrowers who were defrauded by their institutions,\" Schumer and Gillibrand in a joint statement.\n\nBoth Schumer and Gillibrand did not return blue slips for Menashi's nomination.\n\nMenashi had a few Republican allies during his confirmation hearing. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) introduced the nominee and praised him for his credentials, which include a degree from Stanford Law School and a stint clerking for Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito. Hawley expressed sympathy for the media scrutiny Menashi faced over his writings.\n\nPrior to his hearing, CNN reported that as a student at Dartmouth, Menashi criticized \u201cTake Back the Night\u201d marches that intend to draw awareness to and stop sexual violence against women.\n\nIn his writings, Menashi said that such marches \u201ccharge the majority of male students with complicity in rape and sexual violence (every man's a potential rapist, they say; it's part of the patriarchal culture),\u201d and argued there\u2019s \u201cno similar leeway for men.\"\n\nMSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow also highlighted his article on ethnonationalism.\n\nThe Judicial Crisis Network, a conservative judicial group, came to Menashi\u2019s defense. Prior to the hearing, Carrie Severino, the group\u2019s chief counsel said Menashi will be \u201can outstanding judge\u201d and expressed confidence he would be confirmed.\n\n", "description": "Steven Menashi faced criticism for refusing to answer questions and his controversial writings.", "authors": ["Marianne Levine"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/79/f3/183ea9bb436b8807d8b30f81371c/190911-steven-menashi-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
