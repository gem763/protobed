It\u2019s known for championing innovation and fostering start-up ecosystems by bringing start-ups and investors together and for building bridges between regions and global markets. Its content typically blends global oversight and expertise with local insights to ensure its relevance to local players.\n\nWiT is making its African debut with three Foundation Sponsors: Travelstart, Wego and Cleartrip.\n\nWiT Africa, to be held at the Belmond Mount Nelson Hotel, is expected to attract up to 200 delegates who can expect to learn about how rapid digitisation is creating choice and affordability for a diverse set of customers, and how they must adapt.\n\n", "description": "WiT (Web in Travel) is bringing its event to Africa with the launch of WiT Africa in Cape Town in May 28, 2020.", "authors": ["Compiled Carin Smith"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7260/f30c5e745e344c0f864ae67cb2bfc7cf.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
