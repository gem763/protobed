The AMRAAM missile, for example, is 335 pounds and 12 feet long.\n\n\"With its advanced sensor, guidance and propulsion systems packed into a much smaller airframe, this new weapon represents a significant leap forward in air-to-air missile development,\" Bussing said.\n\nRead more: Russia's new high-altitude drone just flew for the first time, and they want to arm it with one ton of bombs\n\nThe missile's guidance and sensor systems allow it to \"detect and track moving or stationary targets at any time of day and in challenging weather conditions,\" according to the release.\n\nThe Peregrine combines \"the autonomy of AMRAAM [Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile]\" with the maneuverability of the 9X Sidewinder missile, Noyes told Insider. The three weapons together, he said, provide warfighters with \"just an incredibly potent and catastrophic capability against the enemy.\"\n\nThe Peregrine incorporates already available materials, military off-the-shelf components, and additive manufacturing processes, making it a low-cost option for militaries facing increased air threats, particularly missiles and UAVs.\n\nNoyes praised the Peregrine's ability to \"autonomously track and destroy a target,\" saying, \"The ability of this new seeker is just incredible for all weather, day and night.\"\n\nThe Peregrine's small size, combined with its high-performance propulsion system, allows airfighters to fire more rounds, faster, as well \u2014 enabling it to \"overwhelm the enemy with affordable mass.\"\n\nAs Defense News points out, the Peregrine announcement dovetails with a Raytheon executive's comments about the proliferation of counter-drone technology, indicating that the company's focus on defeating drones won't stop any time soon.", "description": "Raytheon unveiled its Peregrine air-to-air missile, capable of hitting drones, missiles, or enemy aircraft with stunning precision.", "authors": ["Ellen Ioanes"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7fe6e32e22af1e08335865-960-480.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
