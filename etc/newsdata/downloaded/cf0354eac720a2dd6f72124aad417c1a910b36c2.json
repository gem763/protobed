But everyone should feel responsible. Arsenal lose 12 to 15 points per season by set pieces. That should stop.\n\n\u2018If you want to play for the first couple of places you have to sort it out, you have to find a way.\n\n\u2018As a player you want to have that feeling, you have to sprint back, now I see a couple of players jogging back, and there\u2019s danger there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t feel that in the team. \u2018If you have a very strong coach, and you are in midfield and you see danger somewhere, you sprint for your life, because you know if you don\u2019t do it you get punished.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve had [Arsene] Wenger, Louis van Gaal, [Alex] Ferguson, I had so many coaches, and their main quality was to be clear.\n\n\u2018If I\u2019m really honest\u2026someone sent me a video last week of him [Emery] trying to explain something, and I couldn\u2019t really figure out if he was saying, \u2018calm, calm\u2019 or \u2018come, come.\u2019 \u2018That is very important, you have to be clear, you have to be the leader and the leader needs to be clear towards his players.\u2019\n\nMORE: Arsenal star reveals the secret to Nicolas Pepe\u2019s free-kick prowess\n\nMORE: Mesut Ozil sends message to Arsenal fans after latest Unai Emery snub", "description": "Arsenal's management group of Raul Sanllehi, Vinai Venkatesham and technical director Edu remain happy with Unai Emery's progress and are unlikely to make a managerial change mid-way through the season,...", "authors": ["Metro Sport Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1164749031_1571987382.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
