Photograph: YONHAP/EPA\n\nTokyo Olympic organisers said they had no plans to restrict public use of the flag during the Games, noting that it was widely used in Japan and claiming it did not have any political connotations.\n\nThe kyokujitsuki flag, used by Japanese imperial navy in campaigns around Asia and the Pacific before and during the second world war, features a red disc and 16 rays extending outwards, and was adopted by the maritime self-defence forces in 1954.\n\nJapan\u2019s foreign ministry said this week it would update its explanation of the flag in response to South Korea\u2019s campaign. The ministry\u2019s website currently describes it as an integral part of Japanese culture, adding that it is \u201cwidely accepted in the international community\u201d.\n\n'We have to get along': Japan's Korean residents at sharp end of diplomatic row Read more\n\nThe row comes amid a dramatic deterioration in ties between the north-east Asian neighbours.\n\nThe dispute began after a South Korean supreme court ruling last year ordering Japanese companies to compensate Koreans forced to work in Japanese mines and factories when the Korean peninsula was a Japanese colony.\n\nJapan insists that all compensation claims were settled by a postwar peace treaty.\n\nThe court ruling triggered a trade spat that has since spread to tourism and, now, the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nJapanese athletes have long been identified by their national flag the Hinomaru \u2013 a red disc on a white background \u2013 but South Koreans have voiced concern that spectators will display the rising sun at event venues next summer.\n\nThis is not the first time that conflicting narratives of the flag\u2019s historical significance have affected bilateral relations. Last year, Japan pulled out of an international fleet review hosted by South Korea after Seoul insisted that the ensign be removed from its vessels.\n\nJapan withdrew an invitation to South Korea to take part in a similar naval event this month, with Tokyo acknowledging that the countries had yet to \u201ccreate an environment that is sufficient\u201d to invite South Korean ships.\n\nOriginally flown by feudal warlords, the rising sun symbol was adopted by the Japanese imperial army in 1870 and became the navy ensign in 1889. While it is commonly used by Japanese far-right activists, it is also used on commercial products and is the corporate logo of the liberal Asahi newspaper.\n\nThe Olympic Charter states: \u201cNo kind of demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any Olympic sites, venues or other areas.\u201d So far the IOC has said only that it would address potential violations of the charter at next year\u2019s Games on a case-by-case basis.", "description": "MPs voice outcry as Tokyo 2020 organisers say they have no plans to restrict use of flag that Seoul says has militaristic roots", "authors": ["Justin Mccurry"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f43f794e25b7bc168b44799387bc7799d5f25c40/0_199_3287_1972/master/3287.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d85839166c9515df1517153a33b1efac", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
