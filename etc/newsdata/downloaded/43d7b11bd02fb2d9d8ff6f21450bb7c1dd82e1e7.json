We fight, we took risks and we were rewarded with the goal,\u201d said Pochettino.\n\nDoubts continue to grow over the Argentine\u2019s ability to turn the tide in his sixth season in charge.\n\nHowever, Pochettino believes his side have taken the first step in restoring their confidence after the 7-2 mauling by Bayern earlier this month.\n\n\u201cAfter Bayern Munich it is normal we were with our confidence on the floor,\u201d added Pochettino.\n\n\u201cIt was so important the way we achieved the point in the end. We were fighting and showed character. In this type of situation the most important thing is the character you need to show.\n\n\u201cFor me it is the first step to build our confidence again.\u201d\n\nJust like at Brighton a fortnight ago, Tottenham were behind within the first few minutes.\n\nDaryl Janmaat got in behind Danny Rose and crossed for Doucoure to apply the finish.\n\n\u2013 Impotent Spurs \u2013\n\nAfter his exertions in a World Cup qualifier in North Korea for South Korea in midweek, Pochettino left Son Heung-min and club-record signing Tanguy Ndombele on the bench.\n\nBut Son\u2019s spark was badly missed from an impotent Spurs before the break.\n\nIndeed the hosts were fortunate to be just 1-0 down at half-time as Vertonghen somehow escaped conceding a penalty for bringing down Deulofeu despite a VAR review.\n\nSon was introduced for Davinson Sanchez at the break as Pochettino switched formation and he instantly offered more pace and directness to the Spurs\u2019 attack.\n\nHis powerful drive from a narrow angle was tipped onto the bar by Foster on 50 minutes.\n\nBut in Tottenham\u2019s search for an equaliser they were leaving huge gaps for the visitors to exploit on the counter-attack and Sanchez Flores\u2019s men lived to regret not at least doubling their advantage with a host of good chances.\n\nAt the other end, just as Tottenham seemed to be running out of ideas, Watford gifted them an equaliser when Foster collided with his own defender in Femenia and spilled the ball into the path of Alli, who swept the ball into an empty net for his first goal since January.\n\nDuring an anxious wait as the goal was reviewed, confusion reigned as the big screen inside the ground even said it had been ruled out before the referee finally awarded the goal.", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 Watford manager Quique Sanchez Flores complained that VAR is not \u201cobjective\u201d after Dele Alli\u2019s controversial late", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/9d2c6f_dele-alli-scored-late-equaliser-tottenham-in-draw-watford-watford-angered-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
