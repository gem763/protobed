Nicholas Kamm/Getty Images\n\nPresident Donald Trump may well have committed a new campaign finance crime if he, as reported, pressured Ukraine into providing dirt on a political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, and Biden\u2019s son Hunter. Unfortunately, special counsel Robert Mueller may have stymied any future DOJ\u2019s ability to enforce that law when he gave Trump\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr. a pass earlier this year on similar conduct. If Trump has again sought foreign assistance in an election, Mueller\u2019s decision not to enforce the law last time around is partly to blame for the president acting with total impunity along with an accompanying decay of democratic norms.\n\nThe current charges are serious. The Wall Street Journal reported over the weekend that \u201cPresident Trump in a July phone call repeatedly pressured the president of Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden \u2019s son, according to people familiar with the matter, urging Volodymyr Zelensky about eight times to work with Rudy Giuliani on a probe that could hamper Mr. Trump\u2019s potential 2020 opponent.\u201d And in describing the conversation with Zelensky to the press on Sunday, Trump suggested he asked for dirt not just on Biden\u2019s son but on Biden himself. \u201cThe conversation I had was largely congratulatory. It was largely corruption\u2014all of the corruption taking place,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt was largely the fact that we don\u2019t want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThe revelations come after a mysterious whistleblower complaint from someone in the intelligence community last month who reportedly claimed that Trump made \u201cpromises\u201d to a foreign leader. As the New York Times further reported, Trump\u2019s \u201cinterest over the summer in a Ukrainian investigation into Mr. Biden \u2026 coincided with his administration\u2019s decision to hold up $250 million in security aid to Ukraine.\u201d That money was eventually released earlier this month after congressional pressure from both sides of the aisle.\n\nPutting aside whether Trump made promises in order to get Biden-related dirt, or whether his conduct counts as extortion or bribery, there is a good argument that if the facts as reported are true, Trump committed a new campaign finance crime. (Trump has already been directly implicated in Michael Cohen\u2019s campaign finance offense related to the Stormy Daniels payment, for which the president\u2019s former lawyer is currently serving prison time). The case against this sort of behavior as a campaign finance crime was much stronger, though, before Mueller issued his report investigating foreign interference in the 2016 elections and refused to prosecute Trump Jr.\n\nFederal law makes it a crime for any person to \u201csolicit\u201d any \u201cthing of value\u201d from a foreign national. Could Trump pressing Ukraine\u2019s president to help his candidacy by investigating a political rival qualify as a crime under the statute?\n\nThe identical issue came up with Trump. Jr.\u2019s Trump Tower meeting during the 2016 election. As readers may recall, during that presidential campaign, Trump Jr. got an email from his friend Rob Goldstone stating that the \u201cCrown prosecutor of Russia\u201d had \u201coffered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.\u201d This \u201chigh level and sensitive information\u201d was being presented as \u201cpart of Russia and its government\u2019s support for Mr. Trump.\u201d Trump Jr. replied almost immediately, \u201cIf it\u2019s what you say I love it especially later in the summer.\u201d The subsequent meeting, held on June 9, 2016, included Trump Jr.; Trump\u2019s campaign manager Paul Manafort; the president\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner; Goldstone; and a number of Russians connected with the Russian government.\n\nOne of the things Mueller investigated was whether the meeting violated the federal law against soliciting foreign assistance in an election. Mueller in his report acknowledged that under court and Federal Election Commission precedent, opposition research can count as a \u201cthing of value\u201d for federal campaign finance purposes. He nonetheless declined to prosecute Trump Jr. for four reasons.\n\nFirst, Mueller said that did not find enough admissible evidence that Trump Jr. or other Trump campaign officials acted \u201cwillfully.\u201d To make a campaign finance violation a crime, one must know one is committing a crime. Trump Jr. would not sit down for a voluntary interview with Mueller and the special counsel regrettably did not subpoena Trump Jr. to testify to get at his mental state, but Mueller determined \u201cthe government has not obtained admissible evidence\u201d that was likely to prove Trump Jr.\u2019s willfulness \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Second, Mueller defined the law narrowly to require greater proof of \u201ccoordination\u201d before a solicitation could be found. Third, he said he wasn\u2019t sure that the value of the information was at least $25,000, the necessary threshold to make it a crime. Fourth and finally, Mueller said that prosecuting Trump Jr. could raise free speech questions. As I noted at the time, the First Amendment defense is bogus:\n\nThe main First Amendment argument is that a ban on soliciting foreign political contributions is overly broad and could apply any time a foreign individual gives any information to a political campaign. But Trump Jr. was a major campaign official meeting with representatives from a foreign government that were offering \u201cdirt\u201d on the campaign\u2019s opponent. As I [have written], \u201cTo let someone off the hook who solicited \u2018very high level and sensitive information\u2019 from a hostile government because there may be cases in which information from a foreign source does not raise the same danger to our national security and right of self-government is to turn the First Amendment into a tool to kill American democracy.\u201d Further, even if Mueller believed there were First Amendment questions in play, he should have left that for the courts to decide given the strong national security interests at stake here. Mueller offered no First Amendment argument in his report. He merely flagged the issue and never provided any analysis to back up the First Amendment claim. I\u2019m afraid that this flagging of the issue does more harm than good. Mueller has now given campaigns credible reason to believe they can accept help from foreign governments because they may have a constitutional right to do so. That\u2019s even more troubling for what it says about 2020 than what it says about 2016.\n\nAnd now here we are in the 2020 election season with Trump and Ukraine. Thinking of the four concerns raised by Mueller, the first three elements do not save the president in this case. As to willfulness, there\u2019s no way the president does not know that the solicitation of foreign opposition research constitutes a crime following the Mueller probe. He was even pressed on this by George Stephanopoulos last year and said he might accept such research again, which resulted in the head of the Federal Election Commission releasing a statement to once again clarify that, yes, this would be a crime. We will likely have a recording and a transcript of the Ukraine call, so evidence of the solicitation itself will be easy to find if it exists. Third, Biden is the leading Democratic presidential candidate who has a good chance of running directly against Trump in the 2020 election; of course any \u201cdirt\u201d on Biden would be worth more than $25,000.\n\nSo this leaves the First Amendment defense. Thanks to Mueller, Trump can plausibly claim he has a First Amendment right to go to a foreign government to solicit\u2014even potentially extort\u2014valuable information against political opponents. If the First Amendment protected this conduct from Trump, why even hold elections?\n\nUltimately, the best legal argument is that Trump committed a campaign finance crime if he solicited dirt on Biden and his son, as appears to be the case, regardless of whether there was any quid pro quo. But Mueller, despite expressing concern about potential foreign interference in the 2020 elections in his recent testimony before the House Judiciary Committee, may have given Trump a green light through his own report.\n\nKarl Marx once wrote that history repeats itself, first as tragedy then as farce. In this case, I think it is the opposite. The Trump Tower meeting was a farce.
