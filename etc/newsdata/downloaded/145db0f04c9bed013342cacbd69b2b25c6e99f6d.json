With recent appointments of key personnel, the ambitious exchange is poised and ready to continue the implementation of their global expansion initiatives.\n\nSouth Korea marks the fifth stop on their global agenda, with the BiKi team attending D.Fine at Korea Blockchain Week. This was followed by another global meet-up, which was co-hosted together with Chain Partners Inc., recognized as one of the most reputable firms in the Korean blockchain industry with steady media coverage, venture capital backing, a global network, and a record of rapid product engineering. Leveraging on their strong industry connections and vast network in Korea, Chain Partners CEO Charles Pyo and Head of Advisory Jackson Ra worked closely together with the BiKi team to produce a full-house turnout packed with esteemed VC panelists and industry specialists.\n\nThe staggering lineup of panelists, which included the biggest names in the Korean Blockchain VC space, was invited to join in the \u201cInvestment Insights\u201d discussion. That such established Korean VC firms such as Block Crafters Capital, Block Patch, BlockTower Capital and RocketFuel were drawn to participate in the BiKi event, is a testament to the young exchange\u2019s growing influence in the industry. The firms will also be partnering with BiKi to seek out high-potential project listings and increase the exchange\u2019s database of users, while simultaneously boosting BiKi\u2019s presence in Korea.\n\nThe topic \u201cWhat\u2019s to Come in 2020: Major Shifts in the Crypto Investment Space\u201d garnered diverse responses from the insightful panel:\n\n\u201cThere are too many blockchain protocols out there and most of them have already \u2018printed the cash\u2019 to sustain themselves through the next cycle. Currently right now the market perspective is really \u2018heavy\u2019 on Bitcoin. With regards to the right blockchain for putting d\u2019Apps on top of, it should be a free-for-all. Anyone can choose what\u2019s best for them. At this point I don\u2019t think it really matters. D\u2019App developers should, however, be proactive to being inter-operable when there is a clear winner. \u201c \u2013 Joony Koo, Founding Member of Block Crafters \u201cThe thing is, the community around ETH is still very strong and with DevCon in Osaka next week, I see that a lot of people are still very interested in what\u2019s being discussed there. All my friends from NY are going to Osaka, so in that sense, the power of the community is very strong. But that being said, my personal opinion, not BlockTower\u2019s opinion, is that ETH is sort of centralized in a sense because Vitalik is considered to be the manager by almost everyone in the community. Vitalik is not a Havard Business School grad or a manager. People think he\u2019s managing but he isn\u2019t functioning as a manager. The community is strong but I have concerns about the way things work.\u201d \u2013 Steve Lee, Head of Asia for BlockTower Capital\n\n\u201cThe market has learned their lesson \u2013 we\u2019re not so easily fooled anymore by simple statements like \u201cwe are the next ETH\u201d. In the coming months we should see something significant coming out, and I think before the news comes out, a lot of our friends here will have that in our pockets.\u201d \u2013 Ethan Ng, BiKi.com Southeast Asia CEO \u201cChain Partners is looking forward to 2020 as we and our network around us continue to develop products, strategies, and the crypto investment ecosystem in Korea.\u201d \u2013Charles Pyo, tech entrepreneur and CEO and Co-Founder of Chain Partners, expressing optimism about the industry\n\nMeanwhile, Dennis Hui, BiKi Business Development Director, has headed over to the sixth global stop in Malta at Delta Summit, to present on BiKi\u2019s augmented roles as a fourth-generation exchange, which is apart from being just a medium of exchange. This is followed by another meetup which will only include BiKi\u2019s exclusive partners, as this time, the focus will solely be on cementing media, project and VC relationships in Malta.\n\nTargeting growth expansion goals of 200 \u2013 300%, the exchange is certainly living up to expectations. Next up on the agenda is Devcon in Osaka and Blockchain Life in Moscow, where the team will once again branch out to globalize the BiKi brand, and that includes organizing signature events at every global stop. From the Toronto Futurist VIP lunch, where industry luminaries such as Brock Pierce were in attendance, to the massive Ce La Vi afterparty in Singapore, BiKi\u2019s global meetups are certainly events not to be missed!\n\nAbout BiKi.com\n\nHeadquartered in Singapore, BiKi.com is a global cryptocurrency exchange ranked Top 20 on CoinMarketCap.
