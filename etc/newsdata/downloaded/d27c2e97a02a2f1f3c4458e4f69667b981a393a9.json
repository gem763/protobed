The strategy analyzes digital currency-related conversations, processing 850 million tweets every day by means of machine learning and natural language processing technology.\n\nOpening trades on positive sentiment signals only\n\nWhen parsing through social media messages, the tool scans each tweet individually to single out tweets related to a specific cryptocurrency and uses a filter to assess the relevance of the data and to remove spam and bots. Sentiment is measured on a per coin basis to guarantee that the assessment properly reflects positive and negative conversations on Twitter for a particular coin.\n\nThe TIE\u2019s Long-Only CopyPortfolio is a bullish sentiment-driven strategy that considers long positions only with a minimum of three holdings, which eventually opens trades based on positive sentiment signals on Twitter. Joshua Frank, co-founder and CEO of The Tie, said:\n\n\u201cAll you need to do is click one button and you can copy these sophisticated trading strategies trusted by some of the world's leading hedge funds and institutional investors.\u201d\n\nCrypto indices and \u201chuman-free\u201d tools gain traction\n\nEarlier today, the world's second-largest stock exchange, Nasdaq, listed the AI-powered CIX100 index created by crypto data provider Cryptoindex, which uses a neural network algorithm to analyze data for the top 100 cryptocurrencies, taking into account over 200 factors.
