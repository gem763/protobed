The Bachelor's Tim Robards (pictured) posed with his raunchy cover for DNA magazine from 13 years ago on Tuesday\n\nThe raunchy cover shows Tim slightly pulling down some very tight briefs and channelling his inner surfer with a shell necklace and messy mop of hair.\n\n'The funniest part about this old DNA cover is not my hair, it\u2019s knowing my 80 yr old Granny went and bought it from a news agency in Newcastle,' Tim captioned the post.\n\nSpeaking to DNA Magazine in August this year, Tim said he had a deep connection to the LGBTQI community of Sydney.\n\nIcon? Tim recently said he had a 'very strong connection to the gay world' and 'became the face of Mardi Gras' as he also modeled for the festival's poster\n\n'Back then I had a very strong connection to the gay world. I also did a shoot for the Mardi Gras poster with a mirror ball, and I kind of became the face of Mardi Gras,' he told the publication.\n\nThe reality star-turned-actor was also asked if he 'copped any flack' for being a straight man who appeared on the cover of a gay magazine.\n\n'Not really, most of my Sydney mates were all pretty understanding. Maybe the shot with the pink mirror ball might have... but I think anyone, straight or gay, would cop a bit for that!' Tim explained.\n\n'Everyone was good and I was happy with my own sexuality back then.'\n\nConfidence is key: Tim said he didn't 'cop any flack' as a straight man who appeared in a gay magazine. He explained that he was 'happy with his own sexuality'\n\nIn 2013's season of The Bachelor, Tim chose Anna Heinrich, 32, as the winning contestant and the couple married in 2018.\n\nAnna surprised her husband with a romantic river cruise in Paris to celebrate his 37th birthday earlier this month.\n\nLast year, Tim joined the cast of Neighbours in a guest role as Pierce Grayson before being made a regular cast member in February.", "description": "Tim Robards rose to fame on the first season of The Bachelor Australia.", "authors": ["Shive Prema For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/08/19729508-0-image-a-4_1571126312517.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
