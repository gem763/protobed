Elizabeth Warren and her far-left vision for the nation.\n\nAn Iowa State University/ Civiqs poll released last week placed him second behind Ms. Warren in Iowa, where a strong showing could help him ease concerns over his experience as the mayor of a relatively small Midwest city and over whether the nation is prepared to elect a 37-year-old openly gay man to the White House.\n\nJeff Link, an Iowa-based Democratic strategist, said the Buttigieg camp\u2019s decision to set up a shop in Dallas County as well as in nearby Ankeny, where he is the only 2020 Democrat with a campaign office, suggests he is taking inspiration from former President Barack Obama, who overcame questions about his experience in 2008 partly by expanding the electorate.\n\n\u201cThe suburbs are kind of a target-rich environment for people who didn\u2019t caucus, and the Obama campaign knew if traditional caucus attendees were the only ones who showed up they would lose to Hillary [Clinton],\u201d Mr. Link said. \u201cSo they had to change the makeup of the electorate, and they did it by going to the suburbs.\u201d\n\nExit polls in 2008 found that more than 40% of voters were first-time caucus-goers.\n\n\u201cIt kind of seems Buttigieg is taking a page out of that book,\u201d Mr. Link said of the strategy. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to just rely on traditional caucus-goers.\u201d\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, Dallas County is swimming with potential new caucus voters.\n\nThe county added more than 24,000 people over the last decade, according to the U.S. Census, which found more than eight in 10 people living there are white and half have college degrees. The $87,700 median household income is $26,000 more than the statewide average.\n\n\u201cIt probably suits the profile of a Buttigieg voter pretty well,\u201d Mr. Link said. \u201cThere is a likelihood of new voters out there because I think there are independents who before 2016 may have skewed Republican that are part of the shift going on not just in Iowa but across the country away from Trump and towards an alternative to Trump.\u201d\n\nLike Ankeny to its east, the county is emblematic of the suburbs across the country that used to be reliably Republican, but would up powering the Democratic takeover of the U.S. House in the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nThat included Rep. Cindy Axne, who flipped control of the GOP-held seat in Iowa\u2019s 3rd Congressional District. In the Iowa Statehouse, Democrats also picked up seats in the area.\n\nBen Halle, a spokesman for the Buttigieg Iowa operation, said opening the office is part of a statewide effort to reach caucuses-goers in every corner of the state.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen tremendous grassroots support for Pete in Dallas County with supporters hosting their own house meetings, knocking on doors, and recruiting their own networks to join the campaign,\u201d Mr. Halle said \u201cWe\u2019ve got organizers based in Dallas County that are dedicated to organizing communities there, and our field office will serve as a home base for our organizers and our supporters to continue to build our movement.\u201d\n\nThe rise of Mr. Buttigieg has coincided with the fall of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, whose uninspiring campaign has prompted his supporters to rethink their choices.\n\nThat has provided an opening for Mr. Buttigieg to present himself as a more viable moderate alternative to Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and her far-left vision.\n\nHe has started to more directly make the case by taking aim at Ms. Warren\u2019s support for Medicare for All, challenging the Massachusetts Democrat to be more forthcoming about how she plans to pay for the program and arguing that people should be able to keep their private insurance if they are happy with it.\n\nMr. Buttigieg\u2019s message could hit home with fiscally conservative and socially liberal voters living in the Iowa suburbs who feel alienated in the current polarized political environment, according to Bryce Smith, chairman of the Dallas County Democrats who said his research has found Mr. Buttigieg is the first candidate to open a pre-caucus office in the area.\n\nMr. Smith said some voters in the area are less interested in backing a candidate running on far-left promises of dramatic change than they are in supporting a candidate who is promising to unite the nation and restore a sense of normalcy to the office.\n\n\u201cA lot of parents don\u2019t see [Mr. Trump] as a role model for their kids,\u201d Mr. Smith said, contrasting that to Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s \u201cMidwest style.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople can tell that he is not from the coast and that I think resonates with some people in the heartland and they say he understands where I come from and he will remember that at the decision table,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of those other candidates have more of a hurdle to get over when it comes to explaining their position and how they make an impact on middle America.\u201d\n\nMr. Smith said Democratic Party registration has jumped 25% since 2014, while Republican registration has increased 2% over that time.\n\nMr. Couvillion said Mr. Obama in 2008 and Jimmy Carter in 1976 proved that from time to time in politics, candidates are rewarded for the sort of outside-the-box thinking that the Buttigieg team is deploying.\n\n\u201cThose are two examples of people who didn\u2019t play the traditional Democratic game and won the nomination,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
