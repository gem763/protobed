REUTERS/Zach Fagenson\n\nThe compromise deal was agreed by consensus at the Universal Postal Union\u2019s emergency congress after two days of talks, with delegates standing to applaud.\n\nThe Trump administration served notice last October that it would leave in 12 months unless fee rates were changed so that importing countries did not lose money from distributing mail and packages from countries including China in the age of e-commerce.\n\nUnder the agreement, high-volume importers of mail and packages would be allowed to begin imposing \u201cself-declared rates\u201d for distributing foreign mail from January 2021. There is a five-year period for phasing in new fees.\n\nCountries with more than 75,000 tonnes in post imported annually - mainly the United States - may apply their self-declared new rates from July 2020, UPU officials said.\n\n\u201cWe will begin our self-declared rates at the end of June next year. This is exactly what we wanted and planned for,\u201d White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, who led the U.S. delegation, told a Geneva news conference.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll buy less Chinese stuff, buy more from other countries, we will make more in America and the market will be free of distortions,\u201d he said, crediting President Donald Trump.\n\nNavarro said that the current system meant the U.S. Postal Service was effectively spending $300 million to $500 million to subsidize the cost of delivering imports, including goods mailed to the United States from China.\n\n\u201cChina is certainly going to pay more for the privilege of shipping to our market,\u201d he said.\n\nThe \u201chistoric victory\u201d was clinched in negotiations among 34 countries including China, he told reporters.\n\nChina\u2019s delegation backed the deal, telling the talks: \u201cFor China we have always been actively working with all the members and trying to find a positive solution and compromise in the spirit of UPU.\u201d\n\nUPU Director-General Bishar Hussein warned on Tuesday that any U.S. departure from the 193-member agency would be a \u201cnightmare scenario\u201d, with delivery of global mail disrupted and U.S. stamps no longer being recognized abroad.\n\nHussein, speaking to reporters on Wednesday, welcomed the deal as preserving unity but conceded it would mean higher postal rates for some.\n\n\u201cToday what I witnessed is a historical moment where we averted possible exit of one of our member countries. I can tell you it was very tense,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOnce a country declares their rate, exporting countries will have to factor that cost, it means that cost will be transferred to the person sending that item ... When you are in a country and you buy items overseas, the end-customer will definitely have to pay a higher price.\u201d", "description": "The U.N. agency linking postal systems worldwide on Wednesday agreed to reform its fee structure under a proposal by the United States that averted the Trump administration leaving the global network but may mean many consumers pay more.", "authors": ["Stephanie Nebehay", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433907625&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O1MH", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
