(Carlos Barria/Reuters)\n\nMichael Pillsbury, the director for Chinese strategy at the D.C.-based Hudson Institute think tank and one of President Trump\u2019s advisers on China, told The Financial Times that he\u2019d asked Chinese officials about Hunter Biden\u2019s dealings in the country and gotten \u201cquite a bit of background\u201d in response.\n\nPillsbury, whom President Trump once called \u201cprobably the leading authority on China,\u201d first claimed on-air with Fox Business Channel\u2019s Lou Dobbs that he brought up Hunter Biden during a visit to Beijing last week.\n\n\u201cI have never seen them get so secretive in my life,\u201d he said. \u201cThey would discuss ICBM warheads rather than talk about what Hunter Biden was doing in China with Vice President Biden. That is a big area now where the Chinese know they don\u2019t want any American probe into what happened with Hunter Biden.\u201d\n\nThe Times then reported that Pillsbury had confirmed the story to its reporter, and quoted him as saying he\u2019d gotten \u201cquite a bit of background\u201d on the younger Biden\u2019s dealings from his Chinese contacts. Last week President Trump said in a press conference that \u201cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens.\u201d\n\nPillsbury later backtracked, telling C-Span that he hadn\u2019t \u201cspoken to the Financial Times for a month.\u201d But Demetri Sevastopulo, the Times\u2018s Washington bureau chief, subsequently took to Twitter to post a picture of an email exchange with Pillsbury from yesterday.\n\nApparently Mike (@mikepillsbury) denied on C-Span that he told me this (https://t.co/xlKuY17OUk).
