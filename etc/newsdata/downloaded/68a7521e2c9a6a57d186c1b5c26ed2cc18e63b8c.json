The movie is based on a 2015 article from New York magazine titled \u201cThe Hustlers At Scores\u201d and J-Lo put in the work to make sure she looked like a professional.\n\n\u201cIt was a really scary thing for me to do,\u201d she explained in a new interview with Evening Standard Magazine.\n\nJENNIFER LOPEZ EXPLAINS WHY WEDDING PLANS WITH A-ROD ARE ON HOLD FOR A WHILE\n\nIn particular, the star was referencing a scene in the movie in which she had to dance--with hardly any clothing on--in front of a crowd.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m used to being on stage in sexy costumes, but I have three layers of tights and fishnets and a bodysuit,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cIt was a brand-new feeling to come out practically naked, in front of all those men \u2014 300 extras hooting and hollering \u2014 and dance for money.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cThere\u2019s something liberating and empowering about it, but you\u2019re really out there, physically, emotionally and psychologically.\u201d\n\nJENNIFER LOPEZ REMINDS FANS SHE'S 'FOREVER YOUNG' WHILE IN ST.
