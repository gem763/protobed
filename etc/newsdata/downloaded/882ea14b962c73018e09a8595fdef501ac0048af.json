I start out on my back, but eventually collapse over to my side by the middle of the night.\n\nWhat to know: Saatva, which has been around for eight years, was one of the first online, innerspring mattress companies. They offer three versions: soft, luxury firm, and firm. In each, an organic cotton pillow top \u2014 some people call it \u201cEuro-style,\u201d or \u201chotel-style\u201d \u2014 covers a top layer of eco-friendly memory foam, which sits on a level of individually wrapped coils above another layer of recycled steel coils, then a poly foam base.\n\nHow I slept: Because of my generally sore back, I was tasked with testing some of the firm mattresses out there. Side-sleepers, the company told me, are said to prefer the Luxury Firm. So I got it, and my first impression was how sturdy the bed felt. But lying down, I immediately noticed how incredibly bouncy the double layer of coils makes the Luxury Firm. I can certainly see why side-sleepers would like the pressure-relief it offers, but I decided to swap it for the Firm, hoping it would focus support on my lumbar region. Which it very much did. You feel more on top of it, because of the steel springs, but you still have the contoured shape of the raised pillow top. I move around at night, shape-shifting from my back to my side to stomach, but the firmness of this mattress never created a sunken, stuck feeling, which I\u2019ve found happening with memory foam. Instead, the supported feeling of this bed (which still manages to be pretty plush) kept my lower back from collapsing in, making my spine feel more aligned overall.\n\nThe fine print: Saatva allows customers a 120-day trial run, as well as a full return or exchange. The mattress is covered by a 15-year warranty. All sizes are available in two heights \u2014 a \u201cCustom Slim\u201d 11.5\u201d and a \u201cPremier Luxury\u201d 14.5\u201d \u2014 and give the same level of support. The company offers free white-glove delivery and mattress removal.\n\nThe tl;dr: Saatva\u2019s firmest option is a true firm, making it a good choice for those in need of back support. Plus: Saatva uses organic and eco-friendly materials, so while all the mattresses listed here are certifiably safe, there are fewer chemicals in Saatva\u2019s.\n\nThe Leesa Mattress $846 (was $995, now 15% off) $846 at Leesa Buy with code: STRATEGIST\n\nThe tester: Maxine Builder, writer\n\nHow I sleep: I am a stomach-sleeper who prefers a plush mattress that cradles my body. However, I share a bed with a back-sleeper who prefers a firm mattress with little-to-no give.\n\nWhat to know: Leesa is one of the OG mattress-in-a-box companies \u2014 it\u2019s been selling an all-foam mattress since 2014 \u2014 and according to Sleepopolis, it\u2019s a solid option for back- and side-sleepers. In August, Leesa reformulated its basic mattress for the first time, replacing its top layer of trademarked Avena foam (a latex alternative) with a layer of what\u2019s called \u201cLSA200 foam technology.\u201d According to Jamie Diamonstein, one of Leesa\u2019s co-founders, the new foam has improved \u201cpushback,\u201d meaning it better fills in the gaps around your body when you lie down. \u201cThe goal was to enhance the pressure relief of the body through this technology,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve created a foam that responds to the shape and the sleeping position of your body, then it pushes back and balances your body out.\u201d\n\nHow I slept: I used a sleep tracker for five nights while testing this mattress, and every night I fell into a deep sleep quickly and stayed there. The mattress felt soft and plush, but I never sank down into it. My partner, who is so enamored with sleeping on hard surfaces that he sometimes naps on a yoga mat on our hardwood floor, raved about the pressure relief and comfort he felt from the foam filling in the small of his back while he slept.\n\nThe fine print: Standard shipping is free, though Leesa also offers white-glove delivery for an additional $100. For an additional $50, the two-person team will also dispose of your old mattress and box spring. You have 100 days to try your Leesa mattress; if you don\u2019t like it, the company will coordinate a pickup from your home, then refund the full purchase price.\n\nThe tl;dr: This is a foam mattress, but a substantial one that offers excellent pressure relief. It should suit all kinds of sleepers and is a good mattress for anyone who doesn\u2019t want to overthink it.\n\nThe Aviya Mattress $899 (was $1,099, now 18% off) $899 at Aviya Buy with code: STRAT200\n\nThe tester: Lori Keong, writer\n\nHow I sleep: I am not loyal to any one position, so my ideal mattress is a jack-of-all-trades with support for my back, but which is also cushy enough to let me comfortably flop around on my stomach and side.\n\nWhat to know: Aviya does things the old-school way and ships its mattress without compressing it in a box first. The mattress itself is a hybrid model with three layers of high-density foam over a coiled innerspring system. It offers three options for firmness: plush, luxury firm (Aviya\u2019s most popular style and the one I tested), and firm. It\u2019s possible you\u2019ve already unwittingly slept on one, as a couple of popular (but undisclosed) hotel chains use the Aviya Luxury Firm bed. That may be because Sleep Advisor, Sleepopolis, and Real Mattress Reviews gave it a near perfect all-around score for comfort, materials, and support.\n\nHow I slept: Flopping down, I was immediately taken by how plush yet delightfully bouncy this mattress was. The innersprings are a big plus, but they\u2019re buried far beneath the layers of foam. I was amazed at just how propped-up and aligned my body felt while supine, yet how comfortably I slept thanks to the padding of the quilted foam top. Which shouldn\u2019t bother back-sleepers, I\u2019d think, because of the lack of give in this mattress \u2014 there is virtually no sinkage, which I tested by dropping two ten-pound weights on top of it. But the plush top still lends itself well to dozing on your side or stomach, too. I\u2019d even go so far as to say that sleeping on this changed my perception of what soft-but-supportive means.\n\nThe fine print: Aviya provides free shipping, which includes in-the-door delivery through a third-party service. However, that might not cover getting the mattress upstairs in a walk-up apartment (it didn\u2019t at my Brooklyn brownstone), so customers living in cities should ask ahead of time. Mattress setup and removal are available for an additional fee, and Aviya will set this up during a two-hour window, Mondays through Fridays only.\n\nThe tl;dr: The Aviya is supportive but soft, and is another can\u2019t-go-wrong choice for those who don\u2019t want to overthink it, but know that they\u2019d prefer an innerspring system.\n\nThe tester: Margaret Rhodes, senior editor\n\nHow I sleep: I\u2019m a stomach-sleeper \u2014 I often can\u2019t fall asleep at all unless I\u2019m fully prostrate \u2014 but often wake up on my side, and I like a mattress that feels fluffy without having too much give.\n\nWhat to know: If you\u2019re reading this, what don\u2019t you know about Casper? It wasn\u2019t the first mattress-in-a-box company to launch, but it quickly became the most prominent, thanks to factors like shiny branding and venture capital funding. The original premise of Casper was that one mattress could make everyone happy. The company has abandoned this Goldilocksian ideal and made two other models (read on for those), but this is the original: a four-layer foam construction, with firmer support around the shoulders and hips in the newest update.\n\nHow I slept: I owned a Casper before this project (as did several other Strategists) so my evaluation is actually based on a year\u2019s worth of sleep. And it was great. I didn\u2019t have any sleep complaints before, but graduating from my Ikea mattress to the Casper was like flipping a light-switch. It\u2019s definitely a foam mattress, and for some people (like Liza Corsillo, writer and editor), that makes it feel hot. It also makes some people call it a soft mattress (Karen Iorio Adelson, Strat writer). I found it to be squarely in the middle, with absolutely no painful give around the back, but cushy enough that collapsing into it at the end of the day felt like a reward. (Lori also had one and liked it.) Casper has become the de facto mattress, the one bought by people who don\u2019t shop obsessively and who say, \u201cI just have a Casper.\u201d But, honestly, the ubiquity is deserved.\n\nThe fine print: You get the standard (with mattress start-ups, at least) 100 days to decide if you like your Casper. Free shipping and returns come with that, and the company says they try to donate returned mattresses when possible.\n\nThe tl;dr: As a company, Casper is a well-oiled machine that makes delivery a cinch and offers other high-quality products along with the mattress, which is convenient if you want new, say, pillows. As for the mattress, it skews just a tad softer, and hot-sleepers don\u2019t always love the foam. For everyone else, you can\u2019t go wrong.\n\nThe tester: Lauren Ro, writer\n\nHow I sleep: I mostly sleep on my back, but also switch to my side during the night. I prefer a mattress that\u2019s on the firmer side.\n\nWhat to know: Tuft & Needle launched early, in 2012, and was just acquired earlier this year by Serta Simmons. Tuft & Needle offers only two options, the original mattress and the Mint, an upgraded version of the original. The original has just two layers of material: a 7-inch support layer of dense foam as the base and a 3-inch top comfort layer of proprietary Adaptive Foam infused with a \u201ccooling gel\u201d and graphite to keep sleepers cool. Its simplicity may explain its lower price \u2014 it\u2019s a couple hundred dollars less than other foam competitors \u2014 but its appeal is meant to be broad and is aimed at a wide range of sleeping preferences and body weights.\n\nHow I slept: Right off the bat, the mattress felt substantial. The textured fabric cover felt plush to the touch, and when I pressed my open hand down on the mattress, it bounced back with a friendly spring. Lying on the Tuft & Needle for the first time, I immediately felt embraced. Sleeping on my back, I felt supported and cocooned at the same time, and when I turned to my side, the transition felt natural. The company calls its in-house T & N Adaptive foam \u201csoft and comfy while still being bouncy and supportive,\u201d and I completely agree. While I may revert to a coil-spring mattress eventually, I can see myself keeping the Tuft & Needle for a long time. My husband also really likes it, and he\u2019s a back- and stomach-sleeper whose temperature runs a little hotter than mine. It\u2019s a solid introduction to a compressed mattress-in-a-box.\n\nThe fine print: Shipping is free, and if you don\u2019t like it after a 100-day trial, the brand offers a full refund and free removal to a charity of your choice. It also comes with a ten-year warranty.\n\nThe tl;dr: Another crowd pleaser for anyone who\u2019s happy with foam, Tuft & Needle is a very smart choice for anyone looking to spend a bit less.", "description": "To review the best online mattresses, we slept on them ourselves: Casper, Tuft & Needle, Purple, Leesa, Saatva, Zinus, Helix, Tomorrow, Cocoon, Wink, and more.", "authors": ["The Editors"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/strategist/2018/11/13/waveMattress-gallery-04.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-28"}
