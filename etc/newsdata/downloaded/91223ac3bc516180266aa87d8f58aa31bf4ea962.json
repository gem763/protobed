Add Uber as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Uber news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nIn one such case earlier this year, a 23-year-old woman was murdered after she got into a vehicle thinking it was the Uber she requested.\n\nUber announced the feature in a tweet and in a blog post, along with four other measures meant to boost safety. Uber did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for further comment Thursday.\n\n\"To make sure you get in the right car, you'll now be able to choose to receive a unique four-digit PIN to verbally provide to your driver. The driver will only be able to start your trip in the app once the correct PIN has been entered,\" Uber wrote on its website.\n\nAlastair Pike/AFP/Getty Images, FILE\n\nIn addition to the PIN system, Uber also announced a text message-to-911 feature, a notification that tells riders whether drop-off points are near bike lanes, the ability to report a problem to Uber while en route, and real-time ID checks for drivers. The real-time ID checks expand on a previous initiative, and this time will prompt drivers to \"perform a random series of basic movements -- blinking, smiling and/or a head turn -- to add another layer of security to the system,\" according to the blog post.\n\nIntroducing Verify Your Ride with PIN \u2014 a new safety feature we're launching soon.

We trust people, and you can't,\" she added. \"You have to change the way that the laws are to make it safer because that's our nature. We automatically assume that we're safe.\"\n\nSeymour Josephson, Samantha's father, added: \"We grow up teaching our kids not to get into cars with strangers. And what do we do? We get into cars with strangers.\"", "description": "The announcement comes six months after a woman was murdered after getting into a vehicle thinking it was her Uber.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Business/uber-car-gty-jt-190926_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
