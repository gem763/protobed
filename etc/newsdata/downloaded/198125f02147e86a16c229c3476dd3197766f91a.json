If it wasn\u2019t for my partner grabbing the dog quickly it could have been a lot worse.\n\n\u201cIt was terrifying and blood was pouring from my daughter\u2019s head. She was petrified and we called an ambulance straight away.\n\n\u201cHarmony-Rose had to go into theatre the next day and had five stitches on the main cut and one each on the other smaller ones.\n\nMiss Richards admits she is at a loss to explain exactly why the dog turned on her daughter.\n\nShe said: \u201cWe don\u2019t know what happened. The police suggested maybe there were fireworks but we didn\u2019t hear any.\n\n\u201cOnce the attack was over, Rocky acted like nothing had happened. It was really strange.\n\n\u201cRocky has always got on really well with Harmony-Rose. They often played together and he would cuddle up to her.\n\n\u201cNow she is scared to be near any dogs, even my mum\u2019s Jack Russell and Chihuahua.\n\n\u201cThe police said it was a good job the dog didn\u2019t attack my four-month-old daughter as she could even have been killed because she is so small.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear what will happen to Rocky now.\n\nMiss Richards said: \u201cHe is still in the possession of the police and they will decide what to do. They are still investigating.\n\n\u201cHe could be put down but, if not, he will be returned to my uncle\u2019s but he will need to be muzzled and will not be allowed to live with children under 16 years.\u201d\n\nMiss Richards admits lessons have been learnt but insists there was no way of anticipating such a horrific attack.\n\nShe said: \u201cPeople may criticise us but we never had a problem with Rocky before. But now we realise it is best not to have larger dogs around small children even if they seem okay.\n\n\u201cWe certainly won\u2019t have another dog in the house but I hope my daughter doesn\u2019t develop a phobia.\u201d\n\nHumberside Police has confirmed they are still investigating the attack.\n\nA spokeswoman said: \u201cAn investigation has been launched after a one-year-old girl suffered cuts to the head after being bitten by a family pet.\n\n\u201cWe were called to an address in Ravenser Close, Hull, at shortly after 6pm on Saturday. The child was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary and has since been discharged.\n\n\u201cThe dog has been seized and remains in the care of dog wardens, pending the outcome of the investigation.\u201d", "description": "Harmony-Rose needed a total of seven stitches in her head after the terrifying unprovoked attack at home", "authors": ["James Campbell"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20760149.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Harmony-Rose.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
