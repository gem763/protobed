The final FBI report, compiled by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, did not drop the hammer on Trump in the way his opponents had hoped \u2013 but, crucially, it did not exonerate him.\n\nSpeaking after Barr offered his own positive spin on the report, Mueller said \u201cIf we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so.\u201d Trump is still festering about those findings, despite his repeated Tweets about there being \u201cNO COLLUSION\u201d.\n\nNO COLLUSION, NO OBSTRUCTION, TOTAL EXONERATION. DEMOCRAT WITCH HUNT! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 27, 2019\n\nAll of this begs the question: is Morrison\u2019s government prepared to help out Barr\u2019s inquiry, potentially outlining the actions of its own diplomat in the process?\n\nThe answer is yes.\n\n\u201cThe Australian Government has always been ready to assist and cooperate with efforts that help shed further light on the matters under investigation,\u201d a federal government spokesperson confirmed this morning to the ABC.\n\n\u201cThe PM confirmed this readiness once again in conversation with the President.\u201d\n\nRock and roll.
