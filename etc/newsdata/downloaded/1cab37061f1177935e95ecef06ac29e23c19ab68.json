Zoe Lofgren (D., Calif.) at a hearing on Capitol Hill following the announcement. \u201cThis is going to be tied up in court for the foreseeable future.\u201d\n\nEPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said that the action will provide certainty for auto makers as they prepare to comply with stronger standards designed to cut air pollution.\n\n\u201cMost auto makers can\u2019t comply with the trajectory of the current standards,\u201d Mr. Wheeler said at a press conference.\n\nIn the press conference, Ms. Chao called the standards set by the Obama administration unattainable and said they made the price of new cars unaffordable for some families.\n\n\u201cThe rule will not force auto makers to spend billions of dollars developing cars that consumers do not want to buy or drive,\u201d she said.\n\nThe 230-page rule released Thursday lays out the legal basis for the Trump administration\u2019s power to rescind California\u2019s own standard-setting authority as part of its broader effort to lay out fuel-economy standards for new cars and light-duty vehicles made for sale from 2021 to 2026. The federal agency granted that authority in the form of a waiver under the Clean Air Act in January 2013.\n\nCalifornia has long had the authority to set its own rules on limiting air pollutants from cars, but the Trump administration believes such requirements should be set by the federal government.\n\nCalifornia has already taken legal action to block the White House\u2019s efforts to take away its waiver to set its own standards, and top state officials threatened more lawsuits on Wednesday.\n\nFederal officials said they are still working on additional rules that will give auto makers the full scope of requirements and expect to release those details later this year.\n\nRescinding the California waiver would fulfill a longstanding goal of the administration to curb California\u2019s influence over the car industry with its ability to set more stringent emissions rules than federal mandates.\n\nIn July, four car companies\u2014 Ford Motor Co. , Honda Motor Co. , Volkswagen AG and BMW AG \u2014signed an agreement with California to meet tougher emission requirements than those proposed by the Trump administration.\n\nIn previewing the planned action, Mr. Trump tweeted Wednesday: \u201cAuto makers should seize this opportunity because without this alternative to California, you will be out of business.\u201d\n\nWrite to Katy Stech Ferek at katherine.stech@wsj.com", "description": "The Trump administration took a step toward loosening emissions rules for vehicles sold in the U.S. by moving to strip California\u2019s ability to set its own tougher requirements, which officials said will give drivers access to cheaper, safer cars.", "authors": ["Katy Stech Ferek", "Katy.Stech Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108659/social", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
