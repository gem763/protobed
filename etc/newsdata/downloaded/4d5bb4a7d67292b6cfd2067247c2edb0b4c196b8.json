Japanese markets were closed for a holiday.\n\nPresident Donald Trump agreed Friday to put off planned tariff hikes this week on Chinese goods in a fight over Beijing's trade surplus and technology plans. In exchange, he said China would buy American farm goods. But the two sides reported no progress on basic disputes that sparked the 15-month-old fight that threatens global economic growth.\n\nFriday's truce \"has simply temporarily halted the escalation in China-U.S. trade tensions,\" said Philip Wee and Eugene Leow of DBS Group in a report.\n\n\"Longer-term concerns remain that the trade war may widen from tariffs towards impeding investment flows,\" they said. The truce \"could also see the Trump administration turning its tariff war towards the Eurozone.\"\n\nThe Shanghai Composite Index rose 1.4% to 3,014.73 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng advanced 1% to 26,578.41. Seoul's Kospi added 1.4% to 2,073.93.\n\nSydney's S&P-ASX 200 gained 0.7% to 6,654.10.
