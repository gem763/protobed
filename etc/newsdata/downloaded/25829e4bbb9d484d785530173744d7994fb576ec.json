Here's where to find them.", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE Even vegetarians can rejoice over these new types of meat hitting the market. Here's why. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nPlant-based protein continues to go more mainstream, making it easier to maintain a vegan or meat-free lifestyle.\n\nTwo weeks after Red Robin became the largest restaurant chain to serve The Impossible Burger and Burger King announced the pilot of the Impossible Whopper in St. Louis, two more restaurants announced Monday that they are joining the growing plant-based foods movement.\n\nBlaze Pizza is adding a vegan Spicy Chorizo topping at its 300-plus restaurants nationwide Tuesday. Then on April 25, Del Taco will become the first national Mexican fast-food chain to offer plant-based meat across all 580 locations with two new meatless tacos, officials told USA TODAY.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with USA TODAY, Del Taco President and CEO John Cappasola said the California-based company partnered with Beyond Meat to develop the protein that includes the restaurant's signature seasoning.\n\n\u201cIt provides vegans and vegetarians or anyone wanting to cut down red meat consumption with more variety and convenience than they have today,\u201d Cappasola said. \u201cYou can have a taco experience without feeling like you\u2019re sacrificing.\u201d\n\nDel Taco is releasing its new Beyond Taco and Beyond Avocado Taco April 25. Both include a plant-based meat developed with Beyond Meat.

Taco Bell began its test in Dallas earlier this month.\n\nBagel chains Einstein Bros., Noah's New York Bagels and Bruegger's Bagels added Daiya's dairy-free \"Plain Cream Cheeze-Style Spread\" at restaurants nationwide in February.\n\nBlaze Pizza is launching a new Spicy Chorizo vegan topping. (Photo: Blaze Pizza)\n\nThe latest meat-free additions\n\nDel Taco partnered with El Segundo, California-based Beyond Meat, while Blaze Pizza partnered with an unnamed third-party supplier to develop the new products.\n\n\u201cI wanted to create a vegan topping that pizza lovers would enjoy regardless of their dietary preferences,\u201d Blaze Executive Chef Brad Kent said. \u201cSince there wasn\u2019t anything on the market that was flavorful or spicy enough for us, I started developing the recipe by bringing in over 20 different chilies and other spices.\u201d\n\nThe chorizo was tested in several restaurants earlier this year, Kent said.\n\n\"We knew we had a hit on our hands when meat-eating guests, and team members, started ordering it as the stand-alone protein on their pizzas,\" he said.\n\nDel Taco tested its new Beyond Taco and Beyond Avocado Taco in Southern California and Oklahoma locations and saw \u201ctremendous consumer demand that drove increases in our sales and our traffic,\u201d Cappasola said.\n\nThe two tacos contain the Beyond Meat but the Beyond Avocado is the \"completely vegan product,\" Cappasola said, because it has a slice of avocado instead of cheese.\n\nThe tacos will cost $2.49 each and customers with the Del Taco app can try one for free starting April 25 when they enter promo code \u201cBeyond\u201d into the app. No purchase necessary and the offer is valid for seven days at participating restaurants.\n\nThe demand for plant-based products is growing as more people want to reduce meat consumption because of health concerns, said Ethan Brown, Beyond Meat's founder and CEO.\n\n\"We are about accessibility and meeting people where they\u2019re at in their journey \u2013 whether you're a hardcore carnivore or a strict vegan, you should be able to have our tacos, enjoy what you're eating and feel great afterward,\" Brown said.\n\nCLOSE A Change.org petition has seen an influx of signatures since Burger King started testing its plant-based Whopper. Time\n\nPlant-based foods not just a trend\n\nAccording to a June 2018 Nielsen report, while only 6% of Americans said they follow a strictly vegetarian lifestyle and 3% a strictly vegan lifestyle, 39% of Americans said they were trying to eat more plant-based products.\n\nTo Michele Simon, executive director of the Plant Based Foods Association, the growth of plant-based products in restaurants and stores isn't a trend, but a movement.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking of a mainstreaming of this way of eating,\" Simon said, adding meat and dairy alternatives are growing in popularity. \u201cYou can\u2019t get more mainstream than Burger King and Carl\u2019s Jr.\u201d\n\nThat has led some to question when McDonald's will announce plans for a meatless burger in the U.S.\n\nUpscale at 7-Eleven?Slurpee move over. 7-Eleven tries upscale with fresh tacos, on-tap kombucha, craft beer\n\nThe global fast-food giant already has vegan burgers in other countries, including the McVegan, which it added to menus in Sweden and Finland in 2017, and the McAloo Tikki from India. The Indian veggie burger was available in November as part of a rotating menu at McDonald's global headquarters restaurant in Chicago.\n\nA 5-year-old Change.org petition asking McDonald's to add a vegan option that was endorsed by talk show host Ellen DeGeneres in 2014 started recirculating last week.\n\nAuthor Kathy Freston, who started the petition, updated it after Burger King's announcement. She wrote on April 10: \"As 160,000-plus consumers strong, let's turn up the pressure on McDonald's by telling them that if Burger King can do it, a meatless burger is no longer 'impossible.'\"\n\nWhen asked if McDonald's had any plans to add a vegan burger or a comment on the petition, McDonald's spokeswoman Andrea Abate said that the company didn't have a comment.\n\nSimon thinks it's a matter of time before McDonald's and competitors expand their menus.\n\n\u201cMajor fast-food chains are realizing that they have to respond to this growing consumer demand,\" she said.\n\nApril freebies: Your monthly guide to food specials, meal deals and more\n\nMeat-free and plant-based diets: These diets are gaining popularity.
