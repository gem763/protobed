Press freedom is vital. Time to also stand up for freedom to protest, protections for whistleblowers, and other vital democratic rights.\u201d\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison has pushed back on the campaign. \u201cMy government will always believe in the freedom of the press \u2014 it\u2019s an important part of our freedoms as a liberal democracy,\u201d he told the Sydney Morning Herald on Sunday.\n\n\u201cI also believe in the rule of law and that no one is above it, including me or anyone else, any journalist. The rule of law has to be applied evenly and fairly in protection of our broader freedoms, and so I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s, I would hope, looking for a leave pass on those things.\u201d\n\nAttorney-General Christian Porter told the paper there were some \u201csensible\u201d changes to be considered but objected to exemptions from metadata laws. \u201cSome of the demands, I\u2019ve got to say, are right at the outer edge of workability,\u201d he said.\n\nLabor has backed the campaign, with Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese calling for the Government to rule out prosecutions for News Corp and ABC journalists raided by the Australian Federal Police earlier this year.\n\n\u201cUnlike the Morrison Government, Labor believes in freedom of the press and the public\u2019s right to know,\u201d shadow attorney-general Mark Dreyfus wrote on Twitter.\n\n\u201cLabor believes journalists should not be prosecuted, or face going to jail, simply for doing their jobs.\u201d\n\nLabor Senator Kristina Keneally wrote, \u201cScott Morrison and his senior ministers treat \u2018press freedom\u2019 as if it were an inconvenience rather than as an essential pillar of our democracy. Labor believes a strong and independent media is vital to holding governments and opposition parties to account.\u201d\n\nGreens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said voters and taxpayers deserved to know what their government was up to. \u201cThis problem, this secrecy, this overreach from the Government is not just an attack on the media or whistleblowers, it\u2019s an attack on every Australian,\u201d she told reporters in Canberra on Monday.\n\nOne Nation leader Pauline Hanson said she didn\u2019t think the campaign would resonate with the public, although \u201cI think it should\u201d.\n\nSpeaking to the Nine Network, Ms Hanson said journalistic credentials needed to be tightened, raising the prospect of a licensing system. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got to be very careful who we define as being a journalist,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cPeople who write a book could be classified as a journalist or those people that blog on Facebook. But I believe that people must be accountable to the public whoever they are, what position they are in.\u201d\n\n\u2014 with AAP", "description": "The front pages of every major newspaper across Australia have been blacked out today in an unprecedented show of unity for press freedom.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/91da395716102cada13b3532e542fd19?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
