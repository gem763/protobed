Four others, including two children, were also injured by a tornado in the same area.\n\nOne resident there told NHK: \u201cWhen the winds suddenly hit, they blew the roof off my house. The noise was awful. One of my three children was injured but is now in a hospital.\u201d\n\nEven before the typhoon hit, strong winds brought havoc to areas such as Chiba, near Tokyo Credit: Katsuya Miyagawa/Kyodo News More\n\nThe typhoon had been brewing over the Pacific Ocean with recorded winds of more than 145 mph. Authorities issued warnings that with gusts likely to exceed that figure, some houses were at risk of being blown down.\n\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency warned of as much as 30 inches of rain in the 24-hour period until midnight on Saturday.\n\nTelevision footage showed images of damage to roofs and walls of buildings in storm-hit spots across Japan. More than 16,000 homes, mainly along the Pacific coastline, were without electricity.\n\nSome residential areas along the coast in Shizuoka were also reported as being submerged up to around knee height in tidal surges. The approaching typhoon caused rivers to overflow in the area, with reports of at least one person swept away, and widespread landslide warnings also in place.\n\nThree people were missing in Gunma Prefecture after a landslide swept through six houses.\n\nThe weather system passed directly over Tokyo, one of seven regions subject to the non-compulsory evacuation orders - and where a 5.7 magnitude earthquake hit just ahead of the typhoon's arrival. Around 17,000 Self-Defence Forces personnel were on standby across the country for potential deployment on rescue operations.\n\nEven as the typhoon moved away from the capital late on Saturday, one expert warned of further flooding as several surrounding prefectures began releasing water from dams, letting it flow downstream.\n\n\"The situation is now worse than this evening,\" Nobuyuki Tsuchiya, director of the Japan Riverfront Research Centre, told Reuters. About 1.5 million people in Tokyo live below sea level.\n\nJapan's national rugby team waded through floodwater to reach the pitch for practice, with a decision still to be made on Sunday's matches Credit: Japan Rugby Football Union/Reuters More", "description": "At least six million people were told to evacuate their homes as Super Typhoon Hagibis smashed into Japan on Saturday, triggering mudslides, flooding and the heaviest rain and winds in 60 years.
