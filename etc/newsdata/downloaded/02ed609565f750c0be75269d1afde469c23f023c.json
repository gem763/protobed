The last time Comex gold settled consistently in $1,400 territory was between June 20 and Aug. 6.\n\nInvesting.com has a \u201cNeutral\u201d call on gold futures in its Daily Technical Outlook, projecting a top-end resistance of $1,530.75 and bottom-most support of $1,496.70.\n\nIn my own analysis from two weeks ago, I opined that gold will be content to reach for the tree-tops on its way up, rather than head for the stars.\n\nMy theory was that, instead of trying to set a monumental milestone like a record high, gold will try to consolidate in the $1,500 territory for now.\n\nFed Could Cut Again Before Year-End\n\nIn a follow-up article a week later, I wrote that gold would have likely floundered briefly after the Fed\u2019s second rate cut of a quarter-percentage point on Sept. 18, which would have disappointed longs.\n\nYet, the yellow metal could outperform in the fourth quarter, to finish the year in the high $1,600 bracket or more if the Fed returns to a more resolute easing mode in its October and December meetings.\n\nIf that momentum carries into 2020, gold could even break the all-time highs above $1,900 that it achieved in U.S. dollars back in 2011. Gold has already hit record highs in every currency that matters this year, bar the greenback.\n\nTD\u2019s outlook is almost similar, where it projects more U.S. rate cuts well into 2020, given the weak economic conditions it forecasts and the Fed\u2019s tendency to formulate \u201cpolicy-by-the-numbers ... which suggests dovish action.\u201d\n\nSome, like Windsor Brokers' analyst Slobodan Drvenica, still predict that gold could break under $1,500 in the near-term.\n\nSaid Drvenica:", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by Investing.com (Barani Krishnan/Investing.com) covering: XAU/USD, Gold Futures.
