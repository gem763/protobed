Boeing said the separation of the two roles will allow Muilenburg to focus on getting the Max back to service. Lead director David Calhoun will serve as non-executive chairman.\n\n\"That's the first crack,\" Nader, who was speaking on CNBC, said of splitting the chairman and CEO.\n\nBoeing was not immediately available to respond to CNBC's request for comment on Nader's remarks.\n\nShares of Boeing were fell by about almost 5% in morning trading, following Friday's revelations of 2016 messages that called into question the safety of the 737 Max jet's flight control system. Boeing said Sunday it understands the concerns over the test pilot's leaked messages and it's continuing to investigate what they meant.\n\nIt's not the first time that Nader has called for a sweeping change in executives. In April, Nader called for Muilenburg and his team's resignation.\n\n\"Your mismanagement is replete with documentation. Management was criminally negligent, 346 lives of passengers and crew were lost. You and your team should forfeit your compensation and should resign forthwith,\" he wrote in an open letter published on his website.", "description": "\"They're dug in so much that they now have a career conflict of interest with the wellbeing of Boeing in the future,\" Nader says of Boeing execs.", "authors": ["Jessica Bursztynsky"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/101810974-171750872.jpg?v=1404394172", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
