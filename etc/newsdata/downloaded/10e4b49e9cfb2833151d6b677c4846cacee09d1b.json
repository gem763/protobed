The increases have been expected since February, KTUU-TV reported Tuesday.\n\nNew regulations increased the number of tiers in the Pioneer Home care system from three to five. The tiers are based on residents\u2019 levels of need. The highest tier previously priced at about $6,800 per month and has increased to $15,000 monthly, officials said.\n\nEight residents left some of the six Alaska Pioneer Homes after the rate increases went into effect, said the state Department of Health and Social Services.\n\n\u201cWith this rate change, elders who have the ability to pay the increased rates will not be asked to subsidize services that others receive,\u201d the department said in a published statement. \u201cAll funds stay in the Alaska Pioneer Homes to meet the needs of the residents.\u201d\n\nThe department previously covered the difference between what residents paid and the actual cost, while the new rate covers the full cost. In the previous fiscal year beginning in July 2018, the state subsidized every Pioneer Home resident at a cost of nearly $34.6 million, the department said.\n\nAnchorage Pioneer Home resident Verna Espenshade, who must pay more than $400 in additional monthly rent, said she believes residents\u2019 objections were not fully considered.\n\n\u201cNow they say I have to go on welfare, I have to apply for assistance,\u201d Espenshade said. \u201cI could have paid my rent at the rate it was and still had a little bit left over.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: KTUU-TV, http://www.ktuu.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Expected rate increases in an Alaska assisted living facility system have prompted the departure of some residents, officials said.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": ""}
