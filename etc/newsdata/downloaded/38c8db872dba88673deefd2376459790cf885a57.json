Thirty Division I schools, predominantly white institutions, rake in about $100 million annually \u2014 largely because of their black star athletes. Hill is fed up, which is why she\u2019s urging athletes to make an intentional move to historically black colleges or universities (HBCUs). The shift, she argues, \u201cwould boost HBCU revenues and endowments,\u201d \u201cstimulate the economy of the black communities in which many of these schools are embedded,\u201d \u201camplify the power of black coaches\u201d and \u201cbring the benefits of black labor back to black people.\u201d\n\nThat certainly sounds fair. I, too, want black people to see returns on their own labor, but the way she suggests that happens isn\u2019t going to work. The NCAA is a cash cow that exploits all athletes \u2014 blacks and whites alike. If black athletes choose to segregate themselves so that HBCUs can reap the benefits of their talent, the HBCU wins. Of course, the athlete still loses. To remedy this system of exploitation, athletes should be paid. They certainly deserve it.\n\nThe NCAA argues that, in not paying its athletes, it\u2019s trying to protect the integrity of their\u2019 educations. Here\u2019s the thing: almost none of the athletes who are good enough to bring in revenue to an institution have the time to prioritize their education above their athletic status. And there isn\u2019t an inverse relationship between receiving a paycheck and doing homework. Many student athletes (like me) have to take jobs on top of their academic and athletic commitments in order to fund themselves, which is, by no means, letting them \u201cprioritize education.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also not hard to find examples of scandals the NCAA has endured over how little it lets its students focus on school. Most notably, it allowed UNC to award 18 years worth of degrees in fraudulent majors. Who majored in and attended these fake classes, you ask? Student-athletes.\n\nIn the 2016-2017 school year, NCAA revenue reached $1 billion for the first time, of which 90% was made off of March Madness through ticket sales and television contracts. The NCAA gave $560.3 million back to its 1,100 members\u2014essentially every college in the U.S. that has athletic programs. But the players who drive this revenue don\u2019t receive nearly as much as they bring in.\n\nSome argue that student-athletes receive upwards of $125,000 over four years through benefits that take the form of scholarships, housing expenses, meals, access to trainers, and the like. But this is a very generous estimate, and even then it doesn\u2019t justify the NCAA profit margin.\n\nThe average student-athlete spends 35-40 hours a week engaged in their sport to some capacity, primarily with mandatory practice time, but also with exercises like treatment and recovery. That\u2019s nearly the hourly expectation of a full-time job. And since they aren\u2019t paid, they\u2019re understandably attracted by all the perks of the elite institutions, the impeccable facilities and the large supportive fan bases. Of course, HBCUs don\u2019t have much to offer these high-level athletes in comparison. Hill even quoted freshman defensive end for the University of Oregon Kayvon Thibodeaux in saying, \u201cNobody wants to eat McDonald\u2019s when you can get filet mignon.\u201d And why should they?\n\nBut if universities started signing paychecks, it\u2019d be a different story.\n\nInstead of expecting black athletes to bite the bullet and go to schools they aren\u2019t drawn to out of moral obligation, HBCUs could start enticing black athletes to their schools through pay. And if elite institutions were to lose money, they\u2019d have good reason to buck the NCAA\u2019s amateurism rules, too. If every school eventually goes to a pay-for-play model, the market for black athletes would become extremely competitive. Yes, perhaps they\u2019d still choose to go to the elite schools, but they also wouldn\u2019t find themselves penniless if they chose otherwise.\n\nAs it stands now, HBCUs have very little to offer star athletes. But it doesn\u2019t have to be this way, and we don\u2019t need to guilt them into segregating themselves to prove a point. Do them one better\u2014give them money to buy groceries when they\u2019re off the court.\n\nNatalie Dowzicky is a researcher a Washington D.C. think tank and a Young Voices contributor.
