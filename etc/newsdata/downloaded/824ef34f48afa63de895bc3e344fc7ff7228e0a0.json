Now They Plan to Sue.", "language": "en", "text": "The new law is intended to remove some of the legal barriers to bringing civil and criminal charges against perpetrators of child sexual abuse. But critics say it does little to help put pedophiles behind bars, which would protect children most.\n\nThough the law moves the statute of limitations for pressing criminal charges for child sex abuse by five years, giving child victims until age 28 to press felony charges and until 25 to press misdemeanor charges, it can take decades for adults to come to terms with abuse they experienced as children.\n\nFor this reason, many other states have altogether eliminated statutes of limitations for bringing criminal charges against perpetrators of child sex abuse, though the changes are not retroactive and only affect cases going forward , said Ms. Hamilton of Child U.S.A.\n\nIn that sense, the Child Victims Act \u201cis a victory for perpetrators,\u201d she said. \u201cThey might be sued and named publicly, so the world will learn they are perpetrators. But they won\u2019t be behind bars.\u201d\n\nThe women who want to sue Mr. Copperman know that he won\u2019t go to jail, and they say it\u2019s not really money that they seek.\n\nLynn Barnett Seigerman, 5 2, a project manager in San Diego, said she was abused by Mr. Copperman at her annual physicals every year when she was a teenager.\n\n\u201cI want my day in court,\u201d she said. \u201cI want justice to be served, and I don\u2019t think it was. I want him to pay, not necessarily monetarily \u2014 I want him to feel the shame that I felt.\u201d\n\nRoni Caryn Rabin is a science and health reporter at The Times.
