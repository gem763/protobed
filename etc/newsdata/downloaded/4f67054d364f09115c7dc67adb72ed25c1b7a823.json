(Rifle deaths 5 year total: 1,582. Knife Deaths year 2017 total: 1,591). Fact 3 of 9: According to Justice Department statistics: We know rifles are rarely used in murders and less than 27% of mass shooters used a rifle of any type. Fact 4 of 9: According to Justice Department statistics: Using the latest Published data FY2017 on mass shootings in public places, the weapon most of the shooters used was a handgun 87%. Note: The figures for Fact 3 and 4 add up to more than 100% because some shooters used both type of weapons). Fact 5 of 9: Liberal's definition of \u201cGun control: The theory that people who are willing to ignore laws against rape, torture, kidnapping, theft, and murder will MAGICALLY obey a law which prohibits them from owning a firearm.\u201d Fact 6 of 9: Everyone knows that Chicago has just a little bit of a problem with gun violence, which is really weird considering the fact the city has such strict gun control measures in place? After all, isn\u2019t strict gun control supposed to prevent criminals from possessing firearms and doing acts of bloody violence? That\u2019s what the left tells us repeatedly, but it\u2019s obviously not true. Let\u2019s hope these folks start using a little common sense and open their eyes to the fact their strict gun control laws aren\u2019t hindering criminals from doing evil, but are instead, leaving citizens open and vulnerable, easy victims for the picking. Fact 7 of 9: A survivor of the Luby's mass shooting in Texas was speaking before a house committee on behalf of gun rights. Her parents had been killed, so those sponsoring the bill had to treat her with a measure of respect. A Democratic sponsor of the bill said he was sorry for her loss, but that she certainly couldn't need an AK 47 to protect her home from burglars. She agreed, and stated that we need AK 47's to protect ourselves from enemies of the Constitution, trying to steal our liberties, such as lawmakers like him. You could have heard a pin drop. Fact 8 of 9: Governments have disarmed and executed over 262 million of their own people in the 20th Century..but please tell me again why Governments should be the only one with guns ? Fact 9 of 9: On April 19th, 1775, 700 British regulars detached from the garrison of Boston under Lt. Col. Francis Smith marched to Lexington and Concord on a mission to confiscate arms from the English colonists. The attempt sparked a revolution. Let that sink in Democrats! Final Thought: When the government tells you that you don't need your guns, that's when you need your guns the most!", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/m/social/images/social_default_logo-1481777.png", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
