The end of production (at least for now) of EA Sports\u2019 beloved franchise came as Ed O\u2019Bannon, a former UCLA basketball player, was on the way to winning a class-action lawsuit against the NCAA in 2014, along with other legal battles in 2013.\n\nO\u2019Bannon argued, and the courts agreed, that the NCAA not paying athletes for the use of their likenesses was a violation of federal antitrust law. The NCAA Football games used players\u2019 likenesses, but NCAA rules kept EA from naming players or paying them.\n\nA judge\u2019s ruling gave schools the option to set up trusts to pay football and basketball players after their college careers were over, and it prevented the NCAA from banning full cost-of-attendance scholarships. But it didn\u2019t actually require schools to pay players anything they already weren\u2019t, for the video game or anything else.\n\nSports fans and gamers often blame O\u2019Bannon for the loss of the game.\n\nHe wrote in his 2018 book that one of the most common bits of feedback he heard from people about his case was, \u201cDude, you\u2019re messing up the video games!\u201d\n\nThat is a common sentiment. Some of the most prominent people in college sports have shared it, including ESPN analyst Kirk Herbstreit, who said in 2016 that O\u2019Bannon \u201cruined that for all of us\u201d and \u201ctook that game away from us.\u201d\n\nHold up, though. It wasn\u2019t O\u2019Bannon\u2019s idea to create a game that illegally used people\u2019s images.\n\nElectronic Arts made the game, choosing to use barely modified likenesses of real people. O\u2019Bannon discovered this while seeing his own image in a basketball video game, something he\u2019d never agreed to.\n\nThe NCAA office licensed out its name to the video game-maker who\u2019d been doing this for decades, hence the name NCAA Football and not College Football 14 or whatever.\n\nIndividual schools licensed their logos, uniforms, and stadiums, usually through one big agency that handled those deals for a bunch of colleges, but players had no way to license anything.\n\nAfter the O\u2019Bannon case (and even before it went to trial), everyone was cool with the game continuing \u2014 except the NCAA.\n\nEA said in a court filing it was fine paying players for their inclusion. The company is known for paying out the ears to license the most realistic components of its sports games. It recently bought the rights to the Champions League for FIFA 19 for an undisclosed, but surely huge, amount, even though gamers were previously able to play with an identically formatted \u201cChampions Cup.\u201d\n\n\u201cConsider EA\u2019s slogan for its sports video games,\u201d O\u2019Bannon wrote. \u201c\u2018It\u2019s in the game.\u2019 Why is that? Because the most realistic games are the kinds of games that sell the best.\u201d\n\nCollege games were a bit different than pro games, in that real-life players weren\u2019t quite as important. But still, imagine a version of Madden without real players. Sales would nosedive, so EA wants to use the most lifelike players it legally can.\n\nThe NCAA was always the obstacle, because it saw the O\u2019Bannon case as a threat to its entire amateurism model.\n\nThe NCAA\u2019s top lawyer, Donald Remy, made that clear when the NCAA announced it was settling a class-action video game case brought by players in \u201814 (emphasis added):\n\nThe plaintiffs in the O\u2019Bannon lawsuit are not seeking monetary damages. Instead, they are asking the judge in the case to prevent the NCAA from enforcing its rules so future Division I football and men\u2019s basketball student-athletes can receive compensation during their time in college for group licensing of their names, images, or likenesses. The plaintiffs claim that such compensation should include payment for their appearance in games that are broadcast live. As a result, in addition to challenging the NCAA rules, the plaintiffs are seeking to erode copyright law and First Amendment protections afforded to those games and broadcasts.\n\nO\u2019Bannon made the NCAA worry that if it sanctioned video games and let players get paid for being in them, it would open the door to athletes getting paid for other stuff.\n\nIf the NCAA would let players and EA negotiate over licensing, they would. Then the schools could make their own deals as usual, and the game could return. We\u2019d all have more fun, and everyone involved would make money.\n\nAs O\u2019Bannon said in his book:\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that we never asked EA to stop making college sports games. Just the opposite, actually \u2014 we love EA Sports college games and wish EA still made them. All we asked for is that EA pursue what it really wanted to do: negotiate with us to use our identities. So, no, my lawsuit hasn\u2019t stopped EA from publishing college sports video games. EA is simply afraid of the NCAA, which could decide not to allow the licensing of team and university intellectual property. If the NCAA told EA it could pay college athletes without retribution by the NCAA, we would see these college games. It\u2019s really that simple.\n\nO\u2019Bannon\u2019s lawyers said the same thing around the time EA stopped making the game.\n\nIf the NCAA got out of the way, the players and EA would both make money. The game-makers are ready to dive back in. But the NCAA thinks letting players get paid for their likenesses would hurt the legal case against letting athletes be paid at all.\n\nThe NCAA still hasn\u2019t budged on letting players be paid for their likenesses. Were that to happen, the game could return.\n\nBlue Society Color Mark Sign up for the newsletter The Read Option A daily-ish mini-column on the college football thing of the day, with some other stuff too.
