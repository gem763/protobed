Williams fumbled on the next play, with Duke taking over at its own 6 with 2:55 left.\n\nDuke gained one first down before an 18-yard conversion on fourth down allowed it to keep possession. A North Carolina personal foul accounted in another Duke fourth down at the North Carolina 32 and a facemask call put the ball inside the red zone before the final sequence.\n\nEarlier, Duke (4-4, 2-3) went ahead after Jalen Alexander returned an interception to the North Carolina 7. On the next snap, Harris ran in for a touchdown for a 17-14 edge.\n\nThat gave Duke 14 points in a 20-second span of game time.\n\nNorth Carolina pulled even at 17-17 on a 34-yard field goal from Ruggles later in the third quarter.\n\nRuggles had lost his starting kicking role after a six-overtime loss a week earlier at Virginia Tech, but he was called upon in the second half.\n\nNorth Carolina quarterback Sam Howell completed 10 of 26 passes for 227 yards with two touchdowns with two interceptions. He has multiple touchdown passes in all eight games.\n\nDuke quarterback Quentin Harris was 22-for-39 for 229 yards.\n\nNorth Carolina receiver Beau Corrales made a 29-yard touchdown catch over Duke cornerback Leonard Johnson in the first quarter. Corrales has a touchdown in four straight games.\n\nDuke reached the North Carolina 1 late in the first quarter, but after a penalty settled for AJ Reed's 23-yard field goal to open the scoring.\n\nThe Blue Devils moved into North Carolina territory twice in the second quarter, but both possessions ended in turnovers. Harris lost the ball on a fumble and later was intercepted by Dominique Ross.\n\nNorth Carolina scored in four plays on the first possession of the second half, capped by Howell's 47-yard pass to Dazz Newsome for a 14-3 lead.\n\nDuke countered on Scott Bracey's 11-yard touchdown pass from Harris.\n\n--Field Level Media", "description": "North Carolina's Chazz Surratt intercepted a trick-play pass at the 1-yard  line with 14 seconds remaining to thwart visiting Duke's final drive in a  20-17...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
