Here\u2019s how NBC News Chairman Andy Lack put it in a memo to staff earlier this month: \u201cAfter seven months, without one victim or witness on the record, he simply didn\u2019t have a story that met our standard for broadcast nor that of any major news organization. Not willing to accept that standard and not wanting to get beaten by the New York Times, he asked to take his story to an outlet he claimed was ready to publish right away.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter those seven months, Farrow took his Weinstein reporting to the New Yorker, which published his investigation less than two months later. He shared a Pulitzer Prize with Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey of the New York Times, who published their Weinstein story days before the New Yorker.\n\nAs Maddow teed up the statement on her show, she said, \u201cI think this might be an unprecedented statement from them.\u201d It makes sense that the suits would cook up something special for Maddow. She, after all, is the face of MSNBC, a go-to moderator of high-profile Democratic debates and a talent capable of holding her own in competition with Fox News.\n\nIn recent weeks, Maddow has turned her talents on her employer. In \u201cCatch and Kill,\u201d Farrow writes that at several key points in his reporting, NBC News officials told him to \u201cpause\u201d his reporting or \u201cgive it a rest.\u201d The logic behind those commands wasn\u2019t always clear, though Farrow\u2019s supervisors returned time and again to concerns that his reporting would interfere with hush contracts that women had signed with Weinstein \u2014 so-called tortious interference. Serious journalism outfits cackle at legal threats so hollow.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn her show, Maddow reported, \u201cAs to whether or not Ronan Farrow was told to hit pause on any new reporting at a time when NBC didn\u2019t think there was enough to go to air with, we have independently confirmed that NBC News did that. That that did happen. He was told to pause his reporting.\u201d\n\nTo chew through such issues, Maddow welcomed a relevant guest: Farrow himself. Right there on MSNBC, Farrow charged that NBC News President Noah Oppenheim ordered him and his producer \u201con six occasions\u201d to halt their reporting. On eight occasions, said the guest, the head of NBC News\u2019s investigative group issued that instruction. \u201cThat eventually escalated to ordering us to cancel interviews,\u201d said Farrow.\n\nHe continued: \u201cAnd, look, you can judge for yourself. It\u2019s laid out in the book, whether what we had was enough. We had a tape of Weinstein admitting to sexual assault. We had multiple named women in every version of this story. But that actually is not the point. The order to stop was un-journalistic.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTurning to the new NBC News statement, Maddow said, \u201cI will say, inside the building, that expression of profound disappointment that the story didn\u2019t get broken here is meaningful to me because I feel like I\u2019ve been waiting to hear that.\u201d The anguish among NBC News journalists over the Weinstein failure \u2014 as well as NBC News\u2019s fumbling of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d scoop \u2014 was \u201cimpossible for me to overstate.\"\n\nFarrow\u2019s presence on the set was news unto itself. As he\u2019s made the rounds promoting his book, Farrow had chatted with every major network save NBC, until Maddow invited him on air. The move communicated Maddow\u2019s consistency on this topic: Not long after Farrow\u2019s original New Yorker story was published, he also appeared on Maddow\u2019s show, where he said that \u201cthere were multiple determinations\u201d that his Weinstein story \u201cwas reportable at NBC.\u201d That led to a moment of grand commotion at the top of NBC News. Farrow writes in his book that right after the interview, MSNBC President Phil Griffin was on the phone with Maddow, \u201chis raised voice audible even at a distance.\u201d Oppenheim dialed up Farrow himself: \u201cI cannot account for Rachel Maddow\u2019s behavior,\u201d he said.\n\nGood! Because Maddow\u2019s behavior aligns with the public interest.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn addition to pressuring her supervisors on the Weinstein disaster, Maddow has pursued the other prong of \u201cCatch and Kill\u201d \u2014 that the sexual harassment situation with Matt Lauer was more extensive than NBC News officials have acknowledged. Multiple women had raised such allegations against Lauer and received payouts to keep quiet about them, Farrow reports in his book. Current NBC News management holds otherwise: \u201cThe first moment we learned of it was the night of November 27, 2017, and he was fired in 24 hours. Any suggestion that we knew prior to that evening or tried to cover up any aspect of Lauer\u2019s conduct is absolutely false and offensive,\u201d wrote Lack in a recent memo to staff. NBCUniversal conducted a probe of the situation finding \u201cno claims or settlements associated with allegations of inappropriate conduct by Lauer before he was fired.\u201d Lauer has denied any coercive behavior. On the question of the alleged Lauer complainants, Oppenheim in a recent memo told colleagues that following a review of Farrow\u2019s book, \u201cThe only three examples we can find that Farrow alleges are Lauer-related before 2017, with even minimal detail, involve employees who by their own admission made no complaint to management, and whose departure agreements were unrelated to Lauer and completely routine.\u201d\n\nFormer NBC News employee Megyn Kelly called upon the network to release women from their nondisclosure agreements to clear the air, if indeed there was nothing to hide. Maddow appears to have procured something approaching that outcome. She read a statement from NBCUniversal on her Friday night show: \u201cAny former NBC News employee who believes that they cannot disclose their experience with sexual harassment as a result of a confidentiality or non-disparagement provision in the separation agreement should contact NBCUniversal and we will release them from that perceived obligation.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the announcement will prompt some more revelations, prolonging a scandal that NBCUniversal bosses have wanted to dispatch for years now. In May 2018, NBCUniversal General Counsel Kimberley Harris fielded calls from investigative journalists at the network for an independent review of the Lauer situation, with one claiming that such a step would make the mess \u201cgo away quicker,\u201d according to Farrow\u2019s book.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWell if the press would stop covering it, it will go away,\u201d responded Harris.\n\nSomeone in the meeting responded, \u201cBut we are the press.\u201d\n\nRead more from Erik Wemple:\n\nAD", "description": "MSNBC host torches network on her own show.", "authors": ["Erik Wemple", "Media Critic With A Focus On The Ups", "Downs", "Downs Of The Cable-News Industry.", "Media Critic"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/0WUSul3KdIyTxQE_9NASJ29N-lk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6AKRYWXYIUI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
