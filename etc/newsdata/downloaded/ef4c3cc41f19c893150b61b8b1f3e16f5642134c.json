Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.\" Shutterstock / sasha2109\n\nSo the government hasn\u2019t released all its documents about what will happen after a no-deal Brexit, explaining they don\u2019t want to alarm us. This is why they announce \u201cWe can\u2019t publish the full results of our own report, because it would upset the British public, who might then decide they don\u2019t want Brexit, which would be undemocratic because it\u2019s what the British public wants\u201d.\n\nThey released the milder parts, that tell us \u201cWe expect shortages of basic foods that have been available since 1860, with likely outbreaks of typhoid, and crossing the channel to Boulogne will involve more paperwork than when France was occupied by the Nazis, but we should think of this in the same way as if someone poured thousands of scorpions into our living room. Instead of moaning about the problems, let\u2019s consider all the opportunities.\u201d\n\nThis deep sense of the democratic will is what drives politicians like Iain Duncan Smith, who make speeches denouncing any delay to a no-deal Brexit, and that go \u201cIn the referendum, the British people, 17.4 million \u2013 which is the greatest number ever, no mathematician has ever been able to think of a bigger number, a number so vast it is intensely sexually exciting, oooooooo 17.4 million, wurrrrr, look at it, come here you humungous minx of a number \u2013 voted quite explicitly to pay \u00a335 for a tomato.\u201d\n\nEven so, opponents of a no-deal Brexit shouldn\u2019t worry, as there will soon be an election that could stop it happening. This must be why many people opposed to a no-deal Brexit see the ideal tactic as creating as massive an argument as possible with their own side, to give themselves the best chance of losing.\n\nFor example Labour deputy leader Tom Watson demanded for years that Labour supports a second referendum. Now Labour does support a second referendum, so he\u2019s demanding Labour supports it taking place before the election.\n\nThis is a fun game, and maybe Jeremy Corbyn should agree to that as well, then Tom Watson could demand the referendum wasn\u2019t about Article 50, but to revoke Article 40, concerning the sale of spring onions.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats have done even better. They insisted on another referendum, so now Labour has agreed they don\u2019t want one at all, but instead demand we cancel the result of the last one without another vote.\n\nThat should work, as it\u2019s unlikely anyone who voted Leave might get cross about that in any way.\n\nBut even if Labour adopted the same policy, the Liberal Democrats would announce we should backdate our membership of the EU to the 12th century, signing a fishing agreement with King Louis VI, and voting for the Olympics to be held in Prussia.\n\nSome people\u2019s vote campaigners have attacked Labour for saying they would have an option to Leave on the ballot paper. This is an excellent point, as the choices should be Remain, Remain or to satisfy the extremists, Remain.\n\nClearly Labour have made a mess of this over the last couple of years, coming up with policies such as \u201cwe support a single market customs market operating on the outskirts of Mansfield market, subject to VAR if the defender is in line with the off stump.\u201d\n\nOr \u201cwe do support a referendum, but the question on the ballot paper must be written in ancient Inuit so no one knows which side they\u2019re voting for\u201d.\n\nBut now, with an election a few weeks away, maybe there should be some agreement between the parties opposed to all this.\n\nSo the Green Party have announced they will stand in marginal seats, such as Stroud, where Labour won last time by 44 per cent to 43 per cent. The Greens on the other hand managed two per cent.\n\nThis is a splendid idea, because if the vote is split, the Conservative wins, and the most crazed government for centuries gets in and hands the country to the most crazed US president in centuries (who doesn\u2019t believe in global warming and thinks the oil companies are too soft when it comes to oil), then the Green cause will be boosted because with a bit of luck they\u2019ll have jumped from two per cent to two and a half per cent in sodding Stroud.\n\nSurely the sensible approach here is to divide the anti-no deal Brexit vote a bit more, maybe they should stand three Green parties, one that proposes local councils collect cardboard on Wednesdays, one that says Thursdays and one that says they enjoy the New Forest but prefer the Isle of Wight.\n\nEven so, Labour could seek ways of maximising the anti no-deal vote, possibly offering a government post to Caroline Lucas, or promising a reform of the electoral system. But it will be much more fun if each side carries on squealing at each other, then we can all concentrate on enjoying the scorpions.", "description": "This is becoming joyfully unpredictable.
