She is bruised too from the impact.\n\n(Image: Geoff Davies)\n\n\"She was wearing a black designer coat, and I keep thinking if the firework had hit her any further up her whole coat would have gone up in flames.\n\n\"In hospital, the doctors told us Emily's burns are superficial and have hit her nerve endings so she's been given strong painkillers.\n\n\"When it happened Emily had a panic attack.\n\n\"The shock must have kicked in around 11pm last night as near enough on the hour, every hour, she was throwing up.\"\n\nThe mum said her daughter, who is now at home, but struggling to walk due to her injuries, is due back in hospital tomorrow when doctors will be able to assess her recovery time.\n\n(Image: handout from Emily's Mum)\n\nThe family has also reported the incident to Merseyside Police.\n\nNatalie and her husband are now hoping those who threw the firework will be caught.\n\nShe said: \"Emily has already said she is never going to that park again.\n\n\"It's scary to think this could have all been 100 times worse, it just doesn't even bear thinking about.\n\n\"It could have been her face.\"", "description": "Emily Godfrey was left screaming in agony as she was leaving Webster Park in\u00a0Kirkby when a group of yobs hurled a firework at her", "authors": ["Catherine Murphy", "Image", "Geoff Davies", "Handout Emily'S Mum"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20738603.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GDP_LEC_271019burngirl_003JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
