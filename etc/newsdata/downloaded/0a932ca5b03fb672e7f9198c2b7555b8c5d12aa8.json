Daniel Smith said in a statement.\n\n\"They make bicycle travel easier and more efficient, and they provide an option for people who want to ride a bicycle but might not otherwise do so because of physical fitness, age, disability, or convenience, especially at high altitudes or in hilly or strenuous terrain,\" he continued.\n\nA pro-biking advocacy group called People for Bikes has been pushing to include e-bikes in various government rules, saying e-bikes make it easier for people with physical limitations to enjoy the benefits of biking.\n\nBut the National Parks Conservation Association, a group that advocates for preservation of public lands, raised concern the policy skirted public input and doesn't consider the impact to other people on the trail.\n\nBrian Melley/AP Photo\n\n\"E-bikes have a place on national parks\u2019 roads and motorized trails. But this announcement disregards well-established policies for how visitors can enjoyably and safely experience the backcountry in national parks,\" Kristen Brengel, Senior Vice President at the National Parks Conservation Association, said in a statement.\n\n\"For generations we\u2019ve agreed that there are some places so special that they should be protected for visitors to enjoy away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. This new policy carelessly ignores those longstanding protections for backcountry areas,\" she continued.\n\nInterior Secretary David Bernhardt asked agencies like the National Park Service and Fish and Wildlife Service to develop rules to formalize the policy.", "description": "Visitors to national parks and other public lands could soon see a new form of transportation on many trails: electric bicycles.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/e-bikes-03-as-ap-190830_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
