English Football Association chairman Greg Clarke called the match \u201cone of the most appalling nights I\u2019ve seen in football.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBulgarian supporters seemingly targeted England player Tyrone Mings, who made his international debut Monday, and his other black teammates Raheem Sterling and Marcus Rashford.\n\n\u201cHey, did you hear that?\u201d questioned Mings in the first half, bringing the racist chants to the attention of the linesman and England manager Gareth Southgate.\n\n\u201cPlease be under no mistake the game will be suspended and may be abandoned if the racist behavior continues,\u201d said a stadium announcement following the first stoppage at the 27th minute with England already ahead, 2-0.\n\nThe match resumed after a three-minute pause as more announcements played over the public address system warning the match could be abandoned if the racist behavior continued.\n\n\u201cThere are genuine difficulties in managing situations where the potential for such incidents is a real possibility \u2014 there are no easy solutions,\u201d said Piara Powar, executive director of Football Against Racism in Europe. \u201cThis match reflected the very real reality in some parts of Europe with populist right-wing agendas and widespread attacks on minorities.\u201d\n\nSouthgate complained to officials about more racist behavior in the 42nd minute, and the match was again halted for three minutes. According to UEFA\u2019s three-step racism protocol, after a second warning, England was entitled to walk off the pitch if the abuse continued, but instead decided during halftime, with the score 4-0, to finish the match. Bulgarian captain Ivelin Popov spent much of intermission appealing to home fans to stop their jeers of English players, according to the Guardian.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe were told by the officials that 500 people in the corner who caused a lot of trouble has been thrown out at halftime,\u201d Clarke, the English FA chairman, told the Guardian. \u201cThey said that after that there were isolated examples of racist behavior, not massed examples, and the protocol deals with massed examples of racist behavior. They\u2019ll have to collect more information from live footage of the game.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy that Gareth was in control from our side. He got the players together when the first incident happened. Then, when the second incident happened the referee said, \u2018Do you want to carry on?\u2019 He said, \u2018There are only four minutes to half-time, let\u2019s get to the break and review it.\u2019 He sat down with the players; they wanted to get out there and play.\u201d\n\nEngland fans could be heard chanting \u201cwho put the ball in the racists net?\u201d after Sterling scored for England.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEngland fans chant \u201cWho put the ball in the racists\u2019 net?\u201d after Raheem Sterling scores for England in a game soured by racist chanting.\n\n\n\nFollow our live blog here:https://t.co/Yk2kflsoRV\n\n\n\npic.twitter.com/55CkstDSXZ \u2014 The Telegraph (@Telegraph) October 14, 2019\n\nIn Britain, the racism was widely condemned on Tuesday both in Parliament, on social media and on the front pages of the British tabloids.\n\n\u201cFootball\u2019s night of shame. England stand tall against the racists,\u201d read the front page of the Daily Mirror. \u201cBulgar off, you racists,\u201d wrote The Sun.\n\n\u201cThe vile racism we saw and heard last night has no place in football or anywhere else. Fully support Gareth Southgate & the team for rising above it. Need to see strong swift action from UEFA,\u201d tweeted British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\n\nSpeaking in Parliament on Tuesday, lawmaker Rosena Allin-Khan said: \u201cUEFA has a duty to act here, the world is watching. A fine is not enough, so I am asking our Government to ensure that we are backing up the FA to seek the harshest possible punishment.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nLawmaker David Lammy also expressed anger and concern over the treatment of England\u2019s players, tweeting: \u201cMonkey chants and Nazis salutes from Bulgarian fans is utterly deplorable. England players should not have to put up with this kind of vile abuse. @UEFA must act and kick them out international football altogether.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAfter the match, Bulgaria manager Krasimir Balakov claimed he did not hear the racist taunts while Bulgarian goalkeeper Plamen Iliev said he believed the home fans in the stadium \u201cbehaved well\u201d and that England players \u201coverreacted a bit.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 5 Live after the game, Mings said he could hear the racist abuse \u201cas clear as day\u201d but added that it was a \u201cgreat night\u201d for him as a player making his debut for England.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t affect me too much. I feel more sorry for those people who feel they have to have those opinions,\u201d he added.\n\nMarcus Rashford took to Twitter to thank fans for their \u201cbrilliant support\u201d while adding that the game was \u201cnot an easy situation to play in.\u201d\n\nNot an easy situation to play in and not one which should be happening in 2019. Proud we rose above it to take three points but this needs stamping out. pic.twitter.com/jTnUGOa8z2 \u2014 Marcus Rashford (@MarcusRashford) October 14, 2019\n\nSterling also took to Twitter to reprimand the behavior of the Bulgarian fans, writing that he felt sorry for the country to be \u201crepresented by such idiots in their stadium.\u201d Sterling has been a frequent target of racists on British soil. A past study by FARE that included sending observers to matches across Europe to investigate and report claims of racism found that English fans are also among the world\u2019s worst behaved spectators.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDespite the antagonistic atmosphere, England\u2019s players were widely hailed by fans at home and abroad for their handling of the abuse and their decision to continue playing in Sofia.\n\n\u201cOne thing is certain: the England team can be hugely proud of their grace under pressure. There was something majestic about those red shirts, still abused periodically but determined to see this through. Football carried on. But this cannot be allowed to pass,\u201d The Guardian\u2019s chief sportswriter penned on Tuesday, in a piece titled \u201cEngland\u2019s vile and disturbing night in Sofia will live long in sporting infamy.\u201d\n\nBogage reported from Washington.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The EURO 2020 qualifier was paused twice by officials in a bid to gain control of the racist chants and behavior of supporters.", "authors": ["Jennifer Hassan", "Social Media Editor For The Foreign Desk", "Jacob Bogage", "National Sports Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/gbwrJRRfjKvCRfzLiEOSjwLc0mM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XTOLY6XOUUI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
