Its market capitalization of $47.6 billion on Friday put it just behind e-commerce leader Alibaba, social networking behemoth Tencent and food delivery titan Meituan in China. Baidu, the search equivalent of Google in China, has fallen off the top-three club, ending a decade of unshakable dominance of Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent (the \"BAT\") on the Chinese internet.\n\nThe story of Pinduoduo comes down to growing internet penetration and the rise of social commerce. Pinduoduo, which is known for selling ultra-cheap products, is particularly popular with price-sensitive residents in small towns and rural regions, a market relatively underserved by online retail pioneers Alibaba and JD.com . However, Pinduoduo has set about targeting more urban consumers by heavily subsidizing big-ticket items such as iPhones.\n\nIts seamless integration with WeChat, the ubiquitous messaging app owned by Pinduoduo investor Tencent, contributes to adaptability among a less tech-savvy population. WeChat users can access Pinduoduo via the messenger's built-in lite app, skipping app downloads; they also get deals from group-buying, thus the name Pinduoduo, which means \"shop more together\" in Chinese.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, Pinduoduo founder and chief executive Colin Huang, a 39-year-old former Google engineer of few words, gave a 45-minute speech at the company's anniversary, according to a summary published by local tech media Late News. He announced that Pinduoduo has surpassed JD.com in gross merchandise volume, or the total dollar value of goods sold. It's unclear whether the companies use the same set of metrics for GMV, for instance, whether the figure includes refunded items.\n\nWhile its rivalry with JD.com is nuanced as both companies are backed by Tencent, Pinduoduo's competition against Alibaba is more blatant. In his missive to staff, Huang acknowledged that Pinduoduo is \"standing on a giant's shoulders,\" hinting at Alibaba's sheer size. When it comes to fighting the impending battle during the upcoming Single's Day shopping festival (11/11), the founder sounded poised. \"Pinduoduo should not feel pressured. The one who should is our peer.\"\n\nAlso worth your attention\n\n82% of Chinese adults used digital payments in 2018, up about 5%; among those living in rural China, 72% made transactions via online banking, telephone banking, the point-of-sale system, ATM or other digital channels, said a new report released by the People's Bank of China. Beijing's push for rural areas to go cash-free is in part what gives rise to such flourishing e-commerce businesses as Pinduoduo.\n\nup about 5%; among those living in rural China, 72% made transactions via online banking, telephone banking, the point-of-sale system, ATM or other digital channels, said a new report released by the People's Bank of China.

Few things move the bitcoin market like President Xi Jinping's endorsement of blockchain. Speaking at a politburo meeting on Thursday, Xi called for China to \"take blockchain as an important breakthrough to achieve independence of core technologies\" (in Chinese). Bitcoin price soared more than 10% in response. But as industry experts cautioned, when China, where crypto exchanges are banned, speaks of \"blockchain\" it usually means the encrypted technology that not only undergirds cryptocurrencies but can revolutionize a whole range of sectors like finance, manufacturing and agriculture. Expect all corners of Chinese society to capitalize on the blockchain concept with even greater force.\n\nXi: Blockchain, Blockchain, Blockchain (undertone is not Bitcoin as usual) Market: pumped Bitcoin 13% \ud83d\ude36\ud83d\ude36\ud83d\ude36 More reads below - pic.twitter.com/RayGwbtKkv \u2014 Dovey \u4ee5\u5fb7\u670d\u4eba Wan \ud83d\udddd \ud83e\udd96 (@DoveyWan) October 25, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Welcome back to TechCrunch\u2019s China roundup, a digest of the latest events that happened at major Chinese tech companies and what they mean to tech founders and executives around the world.
