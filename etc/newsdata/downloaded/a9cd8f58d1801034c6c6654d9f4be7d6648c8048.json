When Tommy Berry was still in primary school, wishing the years away so he could become a jockey.\n\nNearly 20 years have passed. Dreams have come true. Ambitions have been realised. Their relationship has endured. But success hasn\u2019t changed either man. Hickman recalled a moment just a few years ago which he said typified Berry\u2019s work ethic and loyalty.\n\n\u201cTommy has always been there for us,\u2019\u2019 Hickman said.\n\nStream over 50 sports live & anytime on your TV or favourite device with KAYO SPORTS.

He has never forgotten his roots \u2013 his Mum and Dad make sure of that.\u2019\u2019\n\nBerry also remembers that morning six years ago and, in particular, the promise he had made to Hickman earlier that week.\n\n\u201cI had told Greg I would be at trackwork that morning and felt it was important to be there for him,\u2019\u2019 Berry said. \u201cGreg is always at the track early in the mornings, doing the hard yards, so there is no excuse for me.\n\n\u201cOnly last Friday night, I was best man at my cousin\u2019s wedding and I got home at 2am. My wife, Sharnee, said you better not go to trackwork that morning and I said I wouldn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cBut when Sharnee woke up, I wasn\u2019t there. I had woken at 4am, got up and went to ride trackwork for Chris Waller.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to impress anyone, but I don\u2019t want to let anyone down. Trainers expect you to be there and very rarely, even if I\u2019m sick, do I not turn up for trackwork.\n\n\u201cMy job (Saturday) is to try and win an Everest so I need to be as fit as I can.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a routine person, anyway, I want to get to trackwork. It\u2019s just the way I am and the way my parents brought me up.\u2019\u2019\n\nPerhaps, it is destiny that the two men find themselves joining forces for what could be the biggest moment of their racing careers with Pierata in the $14 million The TAB Everest (1200m) at Royal Randwick on Saturday.\n\nPierata, who will come out of the inside barrier, is one of the early favourites for The Everest with TAB Fixed Odds listing him at $5.50 behind only Arcadia Queen at $4.20 and Santa Ana Lane at $4.60.\n\nThe Hickman-trained Pierata has been in spectacular form this spring, finishing a very close second to Redzel when resuming in the Concorde Stakes before powering past Classique Legend and Redzel to win The Shorts.\n\nHickman has given Pierata four weeks between runs to ensure he is fresh and ready for The Everest. The trainer\u2019s preparation has been meticulously planned for the big race.\n\nThis has been like a second coming for Pierata as the outstanding five-year-old was going to be retired to stud after securing his Group 1 win in the All Aged Stakes back in April before the decision was made to put him back into work for another season, primarily to target The Everest.\n\nBefore the spring, Pierata had won seven of his 19 starts and more than $3 million prizemoney but Hickman is also convinced the five-year-old is an even better horse now.\n\n\u201cPierata was always an immature colt and you can\u2019t make something into what they are not,\u2019\u2019 Hickman said.\n\n\u201cBut this horse has done a super job to do what he has done, winning those races in Queensland as a three-year-old including the Magic Millions Guineas was a tremendous effort when he was so immature.\n\n\u201cHe developed again as a four-year-old although he was still nowhere near the finished article. He weighed 480kg when he won the All Aged in the autumn and he was 526kg when I weighed him earlier this week.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the difference in him now, he\u2019s bigger and stronger but he\u2019s still a lovely horse to deal with, he\u2019s got a great attitude.\u2019\u2019\n\nPierata comes from a sire lineage of champions from Octagonal to Lonhro and Pierro.\n\nThose three were champion racehorses and each shared another common trait \u2013 a remarkably relaxed demeanour.\n\nHickman saw plenty of Lonhro and particularly Octagonal when he used to work at Crown Lodge for Hall of Fame trainer John Hawkes, and said Pierata shares a very similar disposition to those great horses.\n\n\u201cPierata is very calm and professional, he\u2019s a marvellous horse to work with,\u2019\u2019 Hickman said.\n\n\u201cThere was one morning at trackwork I was out with Darren Beadman and even he said Pierata looks like Lonhro which was a pretty good compliment for my horse.\u2019\u2019\n\nBerry agreed Pierata has returned a superior racehorse this spring.\n\n\u201cPierata feels like a different horse this preparation,\u2019\u2019 Berry said. \u201cHis action is a lot cleaner, he strides out a lot better, he\u2019s bigger and stronger, he\u2019s matured into a really nice horse.\n\n\u201cHe used to get a bit agitated in the mounting yard and behind the barriers but he now takes everything in his stride.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad they made the decision to bring him back for one more season. It would have been a shame if he went to stud with his best racing still ahead of him.\u2019\u2019\n\nBerry said if Pierata can win the richest race on turf, it would be one of the more satisfying moments of his celebrated career.\n\n\u201cIt would mean a great deal to me to win it for Greg,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\n\u201cHe is someone I\u2019ve grown up with and I\u2019ve seen him go through some great times and some really tough times. He\u2019s had his ups and downs.\n\n\u201cA lot of Pierata\u2019s owners have been with Greg for many years and they are a terrific bunch of people. I\u2019ve been riding for them since I was 34kg!\n\n\u201cI know Greg has done everything possible to have Pierata right for the day. Greg will turn this horse out in superb order for The Everest.\u2019\u2019\n\nDespite the extraordinary hype leading into The Everest, Hickman has also kept everything in perspective.\n\n\u201cThe horse and jockey will give it everything and if we can get a bit of luck in running, then we won\u2019t be far away,\u2019\u2019 Hickman said.\n\n\u201cIf we win, that would be incredible. I don\u2019t think it will change my life but it would make things a lot easier, monetary-wise.\n\n\u201cThe way I look at it, a lot of people in racing devote their lives to this sport and don\u2019t get a horse as good as this.\n\n\u201cI have had some nice horses in my stable over the years but Pierata has been the best. I\u2019ve been very lucky. As a mate of mine said the just the other day, I started off broke and I\u2019m just trying to improve on it.\u2019\u2019", "description": "They share a mutual respect and friendship that was forged in those days when both were dreamers.", "authors": ["Ray Thomas"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/fc9d5ce9d87436b75b0242055df03fe8?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
